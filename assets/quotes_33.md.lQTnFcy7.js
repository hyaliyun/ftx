Consistency  The patrols usually consist of a van with male crew accompanied by chador-clad females that stand at busy public places e.g. shopping centers, squares and subway stations to pry, intercept and detain bad-hijabs. They are driven to a correctional facility or police station, lectured on how to dress and almost always released on the same day after their fathers, husbands or brothers go to the station to get them released. In 2013's Iranian Mother's Day, the patrols rewarded flowers to women for wearing chador (the preferred hijab style). = Controversy = Delica van parked in front of Mellat Park, Tehran A matter of controversy in Iran, some officials and authorities state that based on their interpretation of Iranian police as an Islamic religious police, the Guidance Patrols serve to fulfill the requisites enjoining what is right and forbidding what is wrong and are demanded by the people. Others oppose their existence on the grounds that the police should respect citizens' freedom and dignity, and enforce the law, not sharia. They have also been criticized for being un-Islamic, most importantly because performing the requisites is haraam (forbidden) when it leads to sedition. It is also argued that the notion is a mutual obligation (including remonstrating officials by the people as well) limited to one side. The guidance patrol has also harassed trans women for lack of gender conformity.https://www.rferl.org/a/iran-transgender/28931543.html When an Iranian trans woman was beaten in April 2018, police refused to help her.https://www.pinknews.co.uk/2018/05/21/irans-transgender-community-are- being-beaten-and-disowned-in-spite-of-legal-protections/ On 27 December 2017, Brig.

Built in 1872, it is an elaborate and sophisticated example of Second Empire architecture, built by Columbus Smith, a prominent international lawyer. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1989. The property has been used for many years as an elder care facility, and is one of the oldest such facilities in continuous operation in the state. Description and history Shard Villa stands in a rural area of northwestern Salisbury, just west of the junction of Shard Villa and Columbus Smith Roads. Standing on over , a portion of a once larger country estate, are a cluster of buildings, including the main house, carriage barn, dairy barn, horse barn, and smokehouse. On a height of land north of the house stands a mausoleum, the family burial site of Columbus Smith and members of his family. The house is a 2-1/2 story limestone structure, with a full third floor under its mansard roof. Its most prominent feature is the three-story mansarded tower at the center of the east-facing front facade, topped by a low balustrade and featuring projecting small round windows in the flared mansard roof. Windows are paired round-arch one-over-one sash, with elaborate moulded surrounds that only slightly break the facade's symmetry. The interior has elaborate woodwork and fixtures, and is decorated with murals painted by Italian artist Sergio Pezzoli. A 20th-century brick ell extends behind the original main block. with The property was developed as a country estate beginning in 1872 by Columbus Smith, a lawyer renowned at the time for his experience in international inheritance law. It was the first major commission of Burlington architect Warren Thayer, with exterior detailing by Clinton G. Smith, another prominent regional builder-architect. The estate was landscaped by Robert Morris Copeland, an early landscape architect, although only some elements of his original design now survive. The house design is similar to Plate 19 of Woodward and Thompson's Woodward's National Architect, published in 1869. The interior murals were commissioned by Smith in 1886, with the artist, Sergio Pezzoli, brought over from Italy to live in the villa while creating them. The name of the villa derives from Columbus Smith's first major international client, the family of Frances Mary Shard, a Vermont native who married a wealthy Englishman, and whose only surviving heirs were a family from nearby Ripton. In 1922, the property was adapted for use as an elderly care facility, at which time the brick addition was made to the rear of the main house.

Plot Enteng Kabisote (Vic Sotto) has been living the comfortable life even without his other companions: Aiza (Aiza Seguerra), who is living in a faraway town; his wife Faye (Pauleen Luna) still in Encantasia; and Amy (Ruby Rodriguez) and her husband gone. But he was torn between his son Benok (Oyo Boy Sotto) and his pampered grandson (Alonzo Muhlach). He argues with Benok over who is right to raise his own son and goes to Bohol to tour it, meeting a member of \\"Abangers\\" who has the power of iron. He approaches a hotel attendant Georgia (Ryza Cenon) and Nicomaine (Maine Mendoza) and thinks the tour guide Richard (Alden Richards) is a handsome man, but disappointed, he continues the tour. Three old triplets (Jose Manalo), (Wally Bayola) and (Paolo Ballesteros) run a factory until the workers go into a strike and are exiled as punishment. Kwak Kwak (Epy Quizon) is one of those so-called OEWs that is banished by the leaders, hatches a plan to eliminate the Abangers and eventually Enteng so that his vengeance will be complete. He has sidekicks with duckfaces and other of his minions who are also Encantados who were exiles. Enteng was given a powered suit by the Abangers when they meet, but Kwak Kwak and his minions attacks and captures him and the group. They are put in stasis when Enteng pleads with the scientist to renege. The group later faces and defeats Kwak Kwak and his minions. The closing scenes depict what happened to the Abangers: one (Jerald Napoles) has owned a gym, another (Sinon Lloresca) became a comedy bar owner; another (Cacai Bautista) built a fortune teller shop in Makati that caters to the elite; the three Lolas became Eat Bulaga!'s characters (a nod from Kalyeserye's Explorer sisters); and the tour guide built his own shop.

This is the third installment of the Sarkar franchise and the continuation to the events of Sarkar Raj. The film stars Amitabh Bachchan again in the titular lead role along with Ronit Roy, Parag Tyagi, Jackie Shroff, Manoj Bajpayee, Amit Sadh and Yami Gautam. The film was released worldwide on 12 May 2017. The film deals with Sarkar's internal conflict and his palace-politics with top-level officials, and powerbrokers within the Maharashtra government, involving internal rivalry and intrigue. Amitabh Bachchan sang the Ganpati Arti track, and Marathi dialogues. Plot A businessman named Deven Gandhi (Bajrangbali Singh) approaches Subhash Nagre \\"Sarkar\\" (Amitabh Bachchan) for a real estate project over a large slum in Dharavi Mumbai. Sarkar suggests that Gandhi should offer appropriate compensation and relocate the slum dwellers. Gandhi deems that too expensive and would rather offer a smaller commission to Sarkar to force the relocation. Sarkar refuses and, when Gandhi insists that he will go to another power bastion, Sarkar asserts that he will not let Gandhi go ahead. Gandhi reports back to his Dubai-based boss Vallya (Jackie Shroff). They join hands with a rival opposition leader named Govind Deshpande (Manoj Bajpai) and plot to oust Sarkar. Sarkar's wife (Supriya Pathak) pleads with him to permit their grandson Shivaji \\"Chiku\\" (Amit Sadh) to join him. Sarkar hesitates: the boy is hot-headed and volatile like his father Vishnu, but ultimately lets him come. Chiku immediately clashes with Gokul (Sarkar's longtime loyal right-hand man) (Ronit Roy) over various matters including whether or not to eliminate Deshpande. It is implied that Chiku's girlfriend Annu (Yami Gautam) is using him to get to Sarkar because Sarkar had ordered the elimination of her father. Meanwhile, Gandhi approaches Gokul with the proposition to help him or Chiku would become the next Sarkar and Gokul will remain a servant. Deshpande plots with Gandhi and Vallya to instigate mill workers against Sarkar. Chiku is on the warpath to attack Deshpande. Sarkar tries to calculate who is behind everything. One day, Deshpande is hotly pursued and killed and Sarkar, who has long held a reputation for bumping off opposition, is blamed. Sarkar notes that whoever did this is determined and cunning and will stop at nothing. When assassins open fire on Sarkar at the Ganpati Visarjan festival, it becomes clear that Sarkar's inner circle has been breached. Chiku shows Sarkar the video of Gandhi meeting Gokul and, separately, Gokul remonstrates and says that Chiku, used by the wily Annu and his own vengeance for his father, is behind everything. Sarkar expels Chiku whereupon Chiku joins Gandhi. Vallya orders a bomb blast at the mill. Gokul reports that it was executed by Chiku, (who is now out to destroy Sarkar, and Gandhi. Around this time Sarkar's wife passes away, so Gokul beseeches Sarkar to give the order to kill Chiku. Chiku is shot at but he escapes. Gokul begins hunting him down. Gokul is, presumably, shot dead by Chiku, and Sarkar swears vengeance. Vallya arrives in India to meet Sarkar. He points out that Chiku is too inexperienced to become Sarkar and is therefore useless, and offers to help Sarkar eliminate Chiku. Sarkar discloses that Chiku was dispatched to infiltrate Gandhi by none other than Sarkar himself. He, also, reveals that it was he who ordered Gokul's killing. Annu discovers that it was Gandhi who killed her father, not Sarkar, and she shoots Gandhi, killing him. Hindsight reveals that; differences with Annu had been cleared and she was taken into confidence, and Gokul had turned to Gandhi and played a part in the mill agitation and the slum development in order to sideline Chiku, eventually hoping to become Sarkar. The objective of this hidden plan was to draw out Vallya. Chiku walks in, there is a gunshot, and Vallya is killed. With their adversaries now dead, Sarkar and Chiku sip tea while Sarkar educates the inexperienced Chiku on palace politics.

The depot is located on the west side of the line from Woodlesford, and is south of Leeds railway station. The site has been used to stable trains since the 1860s.  History  Having housed steam locomotives since opening in May 1868, the introduction of diesels in the 1950s led to steam and diesel being serviced side-by-side. However, by 1977 a new two-road diesel maintenance facility had replaced the original brick sheds, so that in 1978 Holbeck was typically host to up to 20 diesel locomotives on weekdays, and up to 30 at weekends, and around this time locomotives allocated here were outstationed at Skipton as well as being used for duties around Leeds City station. However there were changes in the way that British Rail was working, so that the allocation from 1977 of 18 Class 47s, 39 Class 45s, 3 Class 31s and 11 Class 08 shunters had changed by 1985 when Holbeck had no allocated locomotives with Leeds being provided with shunters and HSTs allocated to Neville Hill located on the other side of Leeds City station. Around 1987, Holbeck had an allocation of Class 08 shunters, and Classes 31, 45 and 47 could also usually be seen at the depot. By 1989, the depot had an allocation of ten Class 08 shunters, which, due to the downturn in freight operations in the area, were transferred away in February 1990.

Munro Coast Guard Headquarters Building is the current headquarters of the United States Coast Guard and is located in Washington, D.C. on the west campus of the historic St. Elizabeths Hospital. The building is named in honor of Douglas Albert Munro and was completed in 2013.  History  = Previous headquarters of the U.S. Coast Guard = By the time of its foundation in 1915, U.S. Coast Guard headquarters shared space with its parent agency, United States Department of Treasury. In the same year, the U.S. Coast Guard moved to Munsey Trust Building, which was home up until 1919. In 1921 Bond Building became new building for headquarters. By the 1930s, U.S. Coast Guard Headquarters units were split into three venues ‚Äì Treasury Annex, the Wilkins Building and the Liberty Loan Building. In 1942, U.S. Coast Guard Headquarters consolidated those offices into the Southern Railway Building. Between 1963 and 1971 U.S. Coast Guard Headquarters units occupied 800 Independence Avenue Southwest along with Federal Aviation Agency. In early 1960s and in early 1970s agency also occupied 1300 E Street Northwest. In 1970 U.S. Coast Guard Headquarters moved into Nassif Building along with its new parent agency United States Department of Transportation. Last building to be headquarters was Transpoint Building, leased by General Services Administration since 1979 from Laszlo N. Tauber & Associates, which constructed the building in 1973 (building also served as headquarters for Naval Sea Systems Command between 2013 and 2015). Initially, in the 1990s, U.S. Coast Guard Headquarters units planned to relocate to 1200 New Jersey Avenue Southeast along with the U.S. Department of Transportation, but as the U.S. Coast Guard was transferred to United States Department of Homeland Security, plans were scrapped. = Construction and tenure = Construction of the U.S. Coast Guard Headquarters Building in 2010 In 2004, the Coast Guard began exploring its need for a new headquarters facility. The General Services Administration, the Office of Management and Budget, and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security determined that it would be more cost-effective for the Coast Guard to move to a secure, federally owned site than to find a replacement lease for Transpoint Building. By 2006, a new U.S. Coast Guard Headquarters Building on the campus of the historic St. Elizabeths Hospital was proposed in the 2006 federal budget, although, construction of the building began in 2009 after receiving funding by American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. Budgeted at $646.2 million, it was the largest GSA project at the time. The building was officially opened on July 29, 2013. From August 2013 to November 2013, U.S. Coast Guard Headquarters units relocated to the new building. Earlier in July 2013, An act to designate the Douglas A. Munro Coast Guard Headquarters Building was introduced and passed in the United States House of Representatives, officially naming the building the Douglas A. Munro Coast Guard Headquarters Building. In autumn 2015, the Coast Guard's Marine Safety Center (MSC), Personnel Service Center (PSC), Hearing Office, Legal Division, National Pollution Funds Center, Recruiting Command, Marine Safety Center, and Base National Capital Region moved from various offices in Arlington County, Virginia to the Headquarters Building.

It includes a substantially complete water-powered 19th-century grist mill dating back to 1820, with a later sawmill added about 1870. It is one of the few surviving water-powered mills in the state, and is believed to be the only one featuring both a sawmill and grist (grain) mill. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1992. Description and history The Hayward and Kibby Mill complex is located on the north side of Tunbridge village, occupying on the south side of the First Branch White River. The complex includes a multi- component mill structure, a water power canal and dam, a former blacksmith shop, and the Mill Covered Bridge, which spans the river just below the dam and north of the surviving mill buildings. The mill building has as its core a 1-1/2 story brick structure, built about 1820 as a gristmill, to which a larger wood-frame sawmill was added about 1870. Across Spring Street from the mill is a 1-1/2 story brick building, built about 1803 as a blacksmith's shop, and since significantly altered to serve as a residence. That shop stands between the river and the stone-lined canal which provides water to the mill from the dam, a 1928 concrete replacement for the original dam, which was washed away by a flood in 1927. The mill interior includes operable 19th- century equipment, which can be powered by a turbine installed in the first half of the 20th century. with The mill stands on a site that has seen industrial activity since the 1780s, which was seen as advantageous due to the cascade created by a topographic constriction in the river flow at this point. The first mill was built by Elias Curtis, who also leased part of his water rights to Samuel Bement, who built the blacksmithy. Construction of the brick gristmill is of uncertain date: it fits stylistically into the period about 1820, but may have been built in the 1830s, when other village buildings were built using bricks from a nearby brickyard. The covered bridge was built in the 1880s, and was individually listed on the National Register in 1974.

Education Lustig received an A.B. degree, magna cum laude, from the Section of Biochemistry, Molecular and Cell Biology from Cornell University in 1985. He received an M.S. degree in Biochemistry from the University of Missouri in 1991 and a PhD degree from Marc Kirschner‚Äôs laboratory in the Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics at the University of California, San Francisco in 1997. Lustig carried out postdoctoral research in the Department of Cell Biology at Harvard Medical School in 1997. Scientific contributions Lustig has published 25 original research articles and 4 book chapters and is an inventor of 8 patents. In 1993, Lustig and Andrew Shiau cloned the first member of a novel class of Purinergic receptors activated by extracellular ATP, a gene family that includes important drug targets. In 1993, Lustig and Bruce Conklin invented the first of a series of G-protein chimeras that are still widely used by the pharmaceutical and biotech industry for drug screening. In 1996, Lustig and Marc Kirschner invented a paracrine signaling assay and used it to identify Xnr1, which is part of a cell signaling pathway generating left-right asymmetry. In 1997, Lustig and Randy King invented an in vitro expression cloning technology used to isolate substrates of kinases and proteases. In 1997, Lustig invented a functional genomics approach to gene discovery and used it to identify a new member of the T-box family of transcription factors (Xombi aka VegT). In 1999 and 2000, Lustig and colleagues showed that bile acids are physiological ligands for the farnesoid X receptor (FXR), invented synthetic liver X receptor (LXR) agonists, and demonstrated that both FXR and LXR ligands regulate cholesterol transport. Entrepreneurial career Lustig served as a research director at the biotechnology company Tularik, Inc. from 1997 to 2001, before it being acquired by Amgen in 2004. Tularik went public in December 1999 and is credited with helping to start the biotechnology stock bubble of 2000. Lustig, Randy King, Pratik Shah and Peter Schultz founded the pharmaceutical company Kalypsys, Inc. in 2001. The company was a pioneer in using high throughput screening (HTS) for phenotypic drug screens. The company raised over $170M in venture capital funding. The HTS part of the business was sold to Panasonic in 2006. In 2007, Lustig, Chris Petersen, and Andrew Martin founded the research marketplace Assay Depot (later Scientist.com). The company launched its first public marketplace in September 2008. By 2020, the company operated private marketplaces for most of the world‚Äôs major pharmaceutical companies and US National Institutes of Health (NIH).

Featuring classic Star Wars characters Luke Skywalker, Princess Leia, Han Solo, Chewbacca, , and R2-D2, the first six issues adapt the May 1977 film Star Wars. The series chronicled their subsequent adventures for 107 issues and three annuals, including a six-issue adaptation of the 1980 sequel film The Empire Strikes Back in 1980‚Äì1981. In 2019, the series was revived for a single issue. Development and publication Star Wars creator George Lucas initially approached Warren Publications and DC Comics to publish a Star Wars comic book prior to the film's release as a means of publicity. Charles Lippincott, Lucasfilm's publicity supervisor, approached publisher Stan Lee at Marvel Comics in 1975 about the project, but Lee declined to consider such a proposal until the film was completed. Writer Roy Thomas met Lippincott around this same time, and was asked to write the comic at Lucas's request, based on his work on Conan the Barbarian. Thomas decided to accept the commission when Lippincott showed him a production sketch of the Cantina sequence, convincing him that the project was a space opera along the lines of Planet Comics. Stan Lee was persuaded to greenlight the project in a second meeting arranged by Thomas in 1976, reportedly when he heard that Alec Guinness would be involved. Lucas also requested artist Howard Chaykin, who was allowed to visit Lucasfilm's offices on the Universal Studios Lot to gather reference art. Issue #1 of Star Wars was released for sale on April 12, 1977, and Marvel published the series from 1977 to 1986, lasting 107 issues and three annuals. According to former Marvel Editor-In-Chief Jim Shooter, the strong sales of Star Wars comics saved Marvel financially in 1977 and 1978. Since movie tie-in comics rarely sold well at that time, Lee negotiated a publishing arrangement which gave no royalties to Lucasfilm until the series' sales exceeded 100,000. At that point, legal arrangements could be revisited. The comic gave Marvel much-needed income during a time when the comic industry suffered generally because of rising newsprint costs and a declining number of retail outlets like traditional newsstands and mom-and-pop stores‚Äîuntil the direct market concept established itself in the late 1970s. The series was one of the industry's top selling titles in 1979 and 1980, with the 100,000 copy sales quota being surpassed, allowing Lippincott to renegotiate the royalty arrangements. Issues #1‚Äì6 featured an adaptation of the events of Star Wars by Roy Thomas and Howard Chaykin. Original stories began appearing as of issue #7 (January 1978) by the same creative team. Thomas continued the series with a Seven Samurai-style storyline focusing on Han Solo and Chewbacca, after being told not to use Darth Vader, cover the Clone Wars, or develop a romance between Luke Skywalker and Princess Leia. Lippincott told Thomas that Lucas disliked his new green rabbit character, Jaxxon. This and the \\"sacred cow\\" status that the franchise had obtained led to Thomas's departure. Writer Archie Goodwin and artist Carmine Infantino took over the series as of #11 (May 1978). While generally following a single serialized storyline, the series occasionally included stories which take place before the events of the films, such as issue #17 (November 1978) featuring Luke Skywalker on Tatooine, and #24 (June 1979) with Obi-Wan Kenobi. In 1979, Goodwin visited Lucasfilm's Los Angeles offices to collect contact prints and other reference for a six- issue adaptation of the 1980 sequel film The Empire Strikes Back by artists Al Williamson and Carlos Garzon. Williamson was offered the job at Lucasfilm's specific request, as Lucas had an appreciation of his EC Comics and Flash Gordon work. The adaptation was released as a paperback book, a magazine (Marvel Super Special #16), an oversized tabloid edition, and as issues #39‚Äì44 (September 1980‚ÄìFebruary 1981) of the series. According to Ted Edwards, \\"The artwork reached a new high, with Williamson penciling and Carlos Garzon inking likenesses of the characters that had an accuracy never before seen in the series.\\" As Goodwin made his departure, Louise Simonson joined as editor. She hired her husband, Walt Simonson, as penciler beginning with issue #49, and Tom Palmer as inker. He was joined by writer David Michelinie starting with issue #51 (September 1981). The creative team was prevented from developing Luke's Jedi training or his relationships with Leia and Vader, or using Han, Jabba, Boba Fett, Obi-Wan, and Yoda. An unused John Carter, Warlord of Mars story, which had sat in inventory after Marvel had cancelled that series, was rewritten and redrawn, and published in Star Wars #53 (November 1981). Walt Simonson left the series after issue #66, shortly followed by Michelinie. Ron Frenz became the regular artist starting with #71 (May 1983) and Jo Duffy, who had written #24, returned as writer. Together, they formed a backstory leading to Return of the Jedi. Marvel's adaptation of the film (October 1983‚ÄìJanuary 1984) appeared in a separate four-issue limited series as well as in Marvel Super Special #27 and in a mass market paperback. Starting in 1984, the series was primarily written by Duffy. Art for the final year and a half of the series was by Cynthia Martin. The post-Return of the Jedi years focus on the characters during peacetime. Plot After the Rebel Alliance secures the Death Star plans and destroys the Imperial battle station, Han Solo and Chewbacca depart Yavin to repay Jabba the Hut, but space pirate Crimson Jack steals their reward money. The despondent duo is hired to protect some farmers from a gang. On their way back to Yavin, Jack captures the Millennium Falcon. He also holds Princess Leia captive; she was in the process of following Luke Skywalker to a water planet that he was scoping out as a possible Rebel base. Han and Leia lead Jack to Luke, who has crash-landed and learned that, since the time of the Galactic Republic, the planet's denizens have been using jamming devices to bring down ships for salvage. Annoyed by the jamming frequencies, native sea serpents revolt and attack; the conflict escalates when the governor increases the frequency to bring down Jack's cruiser. The Falcon crew picks up Luke and destroys the jamming device. Jack attacks Han, but the smuggler defeats the pirate. The Falcon crew discovers the wreckage of a House of Tagge ship, which the Empire has made to look like a Rebel attack. They take shelter on the Wheel, a neutral gambling station. Its administrator detains Leia, and Han and Chewie are forced to fight in gladiator battles. Luke, Leia, and the droids escape in a small craft; Darth Vader arrives and almost captures them, but Han disables his Star Destroyer's tractor beam. Luke and Leia return to the base on Yavin, where they thwart the attacks of the Tagge family. Jabba catches Han at one of his hideouts, but ship-eating mites force the crime lord to take refuge on the Falcon‚Äîin exchange for cancelling the smuggler's debt. After returning Jabba to Tatooine, Han and Chewie run into Luke in the Mos Eisley cantina, where the latter was recruiting pilots. After witnessing a test of the Tagges' freezing superweapon, the rebels follow them in the Falcon. Luke fights Baron Orman Tagge in a lightsaber duel and destroys the superweapon. Orman is assumed dead, but actually kept alive by Vader. Domina Tagge, a member of a peaceful planet, comes to Yavin and asks Luke to serve as a Rebel representative. Acting as an Imperial representative, Vader blames Orman's apparent death on Luke, causing Domina to turn on him. She determines that the pair will duel for the planet's favor, but plans for both to die. Orman, whom Vader causes to take his appearance, attempts to kill Luke, but is himself slain. Meanwhile, Jabba discovers Crimson Jack's ruined cruiser and restores the bounty on Han. The Rebellion takes refuge on Hoth, but is driven out by the Empire. Obi-Wan Kenobi's Force spirit guides Luke to Jedi Master Yoda, who trains him. Meanwhile, Han is captured by Vader and frozen in carbonite in a plot to bait Luke. Against the wishes of his teachers, Luke goes to help his friends by facing Vader, who has a stunning revelation for him. Chewbacca and new ally Lando Calrissian set out after bounty hunter Boba Fett, who intends to deliver the cryopreserved Han to Jabba. While Vader continues to search for Luke, the latter investigates a Star Destroyer whose crew has been debilitated by the Crimson Forever, a virus emanating from a mysterious jewel; Luke is afflicted as well. Lando and Chewbacca encounter Leia at a temporary Rebel base on Golrath; she explains Luke's situation. This prompts Chewie to recount a recent adventure in which Han returned two similar jewels to a temple in the Red Nebula. Leia, Lando, and Chewbacca head to the nebula and discover a Tagge ship whose crew has also succumbed to the illness. Aboard, Domina Tagge reveals that she hired bounty hunters to steal the jewels from the temple, but the Empire took one and people began to succumb to the fever. Domina brings the other jewel to the derelict Star Destroyer, saving all the infected survivors. Leia leads a scouting expedition to determine if a forest planet will be suitable for a permanent Rebel base. The Rebellion's power is drained by intelligent hoojibs, who reveal that a flying monster has prevented them from using their usual source of energy. The Rebels drive out the monster, and the hoojibs invite them to stay. Meanwhile, Lando returns to Cloud City, which seems to be empty until he is attacked by a deranged Lobot. Then, an Imperial bomb squad lands to disarm explosives planted by ugnaughts. Meanwhile, Luke and a female pilot, Shira, leave to check on Lando as he has not reported in. Lando battles stormtroopers, and one of the bombs goes off. Lando calls a truce with an Imperial officer, who helps him fix Lobot. The cyborg then uses his cybernetic implants to disconnect the bombs. The officer kicks Lando off the platform, and Lobot uses a jet pack to save him. On the planet surface, they are picked up by a boat of ugnaughts and transported back to the platform; Luke arrives and uses the Force to make it appear that the rest of the bombs explode to scare away the Imperials. Leia leads a procedure to hide the Rebel fleet inside the system's sun using a shield generator, then departs for the planet's surface to investigate the arrival of Imperial ships. R2-D2 detects a malfunction in the generators, and he and find that the entire crew has been knocked unconscious by circuit fumes. The droids use a jet pack to connect an energy cable from one of the cruisers to the shield generator, saving the fleet. Meanwhile, Luke, Lando, and Chewbacca visit a space market to purchase four refurbished TIE fighters. Shira and Luke use them to raid an Imperial armada, but Luke returns to the base to discover that he killed Shira. Luke infiltrates a data vault, where he finds evidence that Shira was selected by Vader to infiltrate the Rebellion and kill Luke; Vader keeps Shira alive in a bacta tank on his Star Destroyer. Using the evidence from the Imperial vault, Luke is acquitted of Shira's murder. The Rebels discover that the rock material of their former base on Golrath records its surroundings. The Imperials soon make the same discovery, and Leia infiltrates the base to destroy it. The Rebels learn that one of Boba Fett's associates was cut out of the reward for Han and may be willing to provide intel. Leia follows a lead that Dengar may be on Mandalore, and discovers a caravan of Imperial slavers. She runs into a Mandalorian warrior named Fenn, who keeps Dengar in a cage. Dengar tricks Leia into freeing him in exchange for intel, but he signals Imperials, who bring her to the chief slaver. Fenn rescues Leia and recaptures Dengar. Meanwhile, Lando and Chewie obtain a lead on Bossk's location, which matches that of Luke's lead on IG-88. Luke runs into some pirates he knows, while Lando says he found Han; it turns out to be one of the pirates frozen in a similar carbonite block. Bossk and IG-88 try to freeze Luke, Lando, and the other pirates, until Chewie arrives to help them. Luke, Leia, Chewbacca, Lando and the droids run a couple of missions for the Rebellion while others continue the search for Han. Then, Luke and Leia receive a transmission from Wedge Antilles, who has been missing since the Battle of Hoth, and they go to rescue him. A search for two missing Bothan spies turns up intel for the Empire's second Death Star, which the Rebels work together to destroy, as Luke confronts Vader, who ends up overthrowing the Emperor, bringing relative peace to the galaxy. Legacy According to Ryder Windham, the comic was not acknowledged by Lucasfilm while planning new stories because little story control had been enforced during its creation. Elements were sometimes referenced, such as the Wheel in a 2003 issue of Star Wars: Republic. In April 2014, the licensed Star Wars spin-offs released up to that point were rebranded by Lucasfilm as Star Wars Legends and declared non-canon to the official film franchise in order to create a blank slate for the sequel trilogy. Alex Ross created a realistic reimagining of the first issue's cover as a variant cover for the first issue of Marvel's 2015 self-titled Star Wars series. Jaxxon the rabbit appears on a cover of the aforementioned series and in the current Star Wars Adventures series. While in the original comic Vader learns Luke Skywalker's name personally, a crossover story between 2015's Star Wars and Darth Vader reveals that Fett gave Vader this intel. The droid-hating cyborg bounty hunter Beilert Valance from the original Marvel comic entered the modern Star Wars canon in the comic Han Solo: Imperial Cadet (2018), and appears in the series Target Vader (2019) and Bounty Hunters (2020). Other publications * A limited-edition Return of the Jedi series, composed of four issues available as the standard versions, the Direct Market ones, the Canadian-priced editions and the six two-book \\"bagged\\" editions, was also released. (In the ordering of the regular series, this mini-series took place between issues #80 and #81.) * A Star Wars: Droids was released, with two eight-book versions (standard and Direct Market), and the three-issue Canadian version. The series was also reprinted in Great Britain. * A Star Wars: Ewoks series was published, and it had fourteen standard issues and fourteen Direct Market ones, seven Canadian issues, was reprinted in Star Comics Magazine #1‚Äì4 and many British magazines, and was translated into German as Die Ewoks Comic- Magazin. * The adaptation of A New Hope was rereleased with new colorations, first by Dark Horse Comics in 1994 (colored by Pamela Rambo) as part of its Classic Star Wars reprint series, and later by Marvel in 2015 (colored by Chris Sotomayor).

It is a direct-to-video sequel of the 1993 American action film Hard Target and stars Scott Adkins, Robert Knepper, Ann Truong, Rhona Mitra, and Temuera Morrison. It continues the human hunt theme in the jungles of Myanmar and Thailand. It is available on DVD, Blu-Ray and Digital HD.Hard Target 2 IMDb Plot Professional MMA fighter Wes Baylor takes on Jonny Sutherland in a match at the MGM Grand. Upset with the judges' score, Baylor tries to knock Sutherland out and accidentally kills him. Overwhelmed with guilt, Baylor enters self- imposed exile in Thailand. Six months later, Baylor is still haunted by the death of Sutherland and competes in underground fight clubs. A man, Aldrich, watches Baylor fight, and offers him $1 million for a private one-off match in Myanmar. Upon arrival, Baylor is informed that he will be the victim of a lethal hunt organized by Aldrich. Baylor is given a water bottle and money belt which, unbeknown to him, has a GPS tracker hidden inside. The hunting party consists of Sofia, bullfighter Esparto, game designer Landon, Maduka, Jacob \\"Texas\\" Zimling, Zimling's son Tobias, Aldrich's right-hand man Madden, and Aldrich himself. In addition, the party is accompanied by a group of corrupt Myanmar Army soldiers. Maduka hunts Baylor with a sniper rifle at a waterfall, but Baylor goes underwater, sneaks up on Maduka, and kills him. While fleeing from them, Baylor comes across a local woman named Tha, who helps him get to the border. As the hunt continues, Aldrich gives the hunters motorcycles equipped with guns and rocket launchers. Baylor fights them and commandeers a motorcycle, leaving Tha alone. Zimling and Tobias attempt to kill Tha, but Tobias has a brief change of heart and flees. Tha then kills Zimling, while Baylor fights Sofia. After knocking her unconscious, he regroups with Tha and they run away. The two go to Tha's house to treat wounds, where Baylor learns something strange about Tha and her village. After running towards the border, Tha and Baylor come across a field full of landmines. Aldrich and the party arrive at the edge of the minefield, having tracked Baylor via the GPS. Tobias, angered by the death of his father, enters the minefield and dies by triggering it. The explosion gives Baylor and Tha enough time to hide in a cave, where Tha finds her missing brother, who is revealed as a previous target of Aldrich's group. He had managed to evade the hunting group's detection and hide. In the morning, Tha and her brother run away, leaving Baylor behind. Tha and her brother are captured, and Baylor rescues them by capturing Landon. Tha then kills Sofia. Meanwhile, Landon is killed by Aldrich for recording all of the events, which was forbidden. Baylor, Tha, and her brother all reach the border and wonder how Aldrich continuously captures them. They find the tracker in the money belt. Baylor takes on the soldiers working for Aldrich and remaining hunters alone while Tha and her brother hide. Esparto goes after Tha and her brother and is killed. Meanwhile, Baylor runs away with the boat from the army camp and heads towards the border. Pursued by the army, Baylor manages to reach the border bridge, where he faces Aldrich and Madden in a final showdown. Finally, Tha uses the money belt to bribe the Army General into killing Aldrich. Having survived the ordeal, Baylor returns to Thailand with Tha to teach children Taekwondo.

It lies within the city walls and has been occupied since at least the Roman period. Etymology Known as \\"Bichill\\" by 1334, the name was also recorded as \\"Bychehill Lomelyth\\", \\"Lomelyth\\" being a reference to the gate in the walls now called Victoria Bar. The name may be derived from the \\"Biche Doughter\\" tower on the walls. Geography The district lies within the York city walls, covering the south-western area of the city's core. It slopes down, gently, to the River Ouse. Until the mid-18th century, a stream divided the area, running from Scarcroft Hill eastwards to the moat of the Old Baile. This was significant enough to act as the boundary between the two parishes of St Mary Bishophill Junior and Senior. The main road running through Bishophill is Bishophill Senior, which becomes Cromwell Road. The city walls border the area to the south and east. The riverside area is now characterised by City of York Council as a \\"quiet residential area with modern warehouse-style residential buildings\\", while the streets away from the river are described as a \\"charming network of terraced streets\\" and \\"a tranquil haven with a very strong sense of identity\\". The area's green spaces run along the ramparts of the city walls. The riverside buildings are at high risk of flooding, and so their ground floors are not in residential or commercial use. History Baile Hill and the city walls The area was probably occupied in the pre-Roman period, and a few artifacts of the period have been found nearby, outside the present walls. In the Roman era, it was the site of the principal civil built-up area of Eboracum, which later became a colonia. The site had defences and some stone buildings, remains of which have been excavated in the churchyard of the former St Mary Bishophill Senior. George Pace suggested that the church may have been on the site of a Romano-British cathedral, but there is no evidence for this. Following the Roman withdrawal, the history of the area is obscure until the construction of St Mary Bishophill Junior in the 10th-century, a large stone building for the period. Following the Norman Conquest, Baile Hill was built up at the south of the Bishophill area, with one of the city's two castles atop. A bailey with earth ramparts lay to its north west; the castle may also have had its own mill. However, after Clifford's Tower on the other bank of the River Ouse was rebuilt in stone, the castle was allowed to decay, some of its defences being incorporated into the city walls. By the 14th- century, the current line of the city walls had been developed, and in the 15th-century, the site was handed over to the city corporation and used for sports. Meanwhile, wharves were developed along the riverside, notably Queen's Staith, which opened in 1660, and warehouses were built. Over time, more houses were constructed in the area; the most significant was Buckingham House, home of Lord Fairfax. In 1667, the Friends' Burial Ground was created, and Ann Middleton's Hospital was founded in 1659. The Old Rectory A small number of buildings from the late Mediaeval period and 17th-century survive in Bishophill; aside from St Mary Bishophill Junior, and the walls, these include 29 Trinity Lane, Cransfields on St Martin's Lane, Old Rectory on Victor Street. Other important early buildings were demolished in the 20th-century. The Old Warehouse on Skeldergate, dating from the 17th-century, was demolished in 1970, and the Plumbers' Arms, built about 1575, was rebuilt as the Cock and Bottle in 1964. The early-18th century was a period of decline for the area; several houses were demolished and replaced with orchards. This changed in 1756, when the City Corporation began designating building plots, the first at the north side of Bishophill Junior. In 1765, the architect John Carr built his own house on Skeldergate, which survived until 1945. 56 Skeldergate was built in the 1770s, probably by Carr, and survives. A gaol was built in the 1800s on what is now Cromwell Road; the Skeldergate Postern in the city wall was demolished to provide better access, but the public outcry led to the start of preservation efforts, and instead of further demolition, a new archway was constructed. Access to the area was further improved by the construction of Victoria Bar gate in the walls in 1838, and the replacement of the Skeldergate ferry with Skeldergate Bridge. Woods Mill Quay Development of the area continued through the 19th-century, with the second half of the century seeing much of the remaining open area covered with small terrace housing. Notable buildings of the period include the warehouses on Queen's Staith and the Bonding Warehouse on Skeldergate. The large Emperor's Wharf was devoted to the transshipment of timber but, by the end of the century, seagoing ships docked further downstream. Away from the river, the former sawmill at 52 Skeldergate and the Golden Ball pub are key survivals. A community cooperative took over the Golden Ball in 2012, as the owners sought to retire. Many 19th-century churches survive, including the former Victoria Bar Primitive Methodist Chapel, Wesley Chapel on Priory Street, and St Columba's Presbyterian Church. The Golden Ball pub In the twentieth century, slum clearance took place in the area, many smaller properties being replaced by low-rise flats and maisonettes. Plans to erect a multi-storey car park in the centre of the district were opposed by a newly-formed residents' association and were subsequently abandoned.

MRVSEC provided special education services to public school districts in and around Scott County Minnesota during its 45-year existence. CSEC was originally formed as a vocational cooperative by three public school districts: Eastern Carver County Schools (known as Chaska Public Schools at that time), Shakopee Public Schools, and Waconia Public Schools. During the early 1980s, CSEC merged with the Minnesota River Valley Special Education Cooperative (MRVSEC), which had provided special education services to the public school districts in the greater Carver County Minnesota area since its formation in 1969. CSEC provided Career and Technical Education, Alternative Education, Adult Basic Education, and Special Education prior to its merger with MRVSEC and the formation of the SouthWest Metro Educational Cooperative in 2013.

It will form part of a new 400 MW interconnector between Denmark and Germany. Location In 2010 the Danish Energy Agency pointed to the site as one of the most attractive for a Danish offshore wind farm. In addition to favorable wind conditions and a depth ranging from 16 m to 25 m, Kriegers Flak will also be located next to the German offshore wind farm ‚Ä≥EnBW Baltic 2‚Ä≥. Kriegers Flak will take advantage of this and be connected both to the Danish grid as well as to the 288 MW ‚Ä≥EnBW Baltic 2‚Ä≥ which is connected via the 48 MW ‚Ä≥EnBW Baltic 1‚Ä≥ to the German grid. The wind farm will consist of two partitions, a western of 200 MW covering and an eastern of 400 MW covering ; a sand dredging area separates the two areas. Combined Grid Solution The Kriegers Flak Combined Grid Solution, a serial connection of offshore wind farms into the power grids of two different countries will be the first of its kind. This has the advantage that up to the capacity of the connection the produced power can be transmitted to the country with the highest demand and price, improving the economy of the wind farms. Secondly, the connection between Denmark and Germany can act as an interconnector, so power can be transmitted from one country to the other, also in absence of power production from the wind farms themselves. This improves the overall reliability of the power grids in both countries and can also reduce the overall price of the electricity. The combined solution was scheduled to be direct current, but the offshore converter turned out to be prohibitively expensive, and alternating current (AC) was chosen instead. Like the 150 kV cables connecting the ‚Ä≥EnBW Baltic 2‚Ä≥, ‚Ä≥Baltic 1‚Ä≥ and Germany, the 170kV cables connecting Kriegers Flak to ‚Ä≥Baltic 2‚Ä≥ and the 220kV to Denmark will be relatively short and thus using AC which is more economical. However, Germany is part of the synchronous grid of Continental Europe, while Kriegers Flak will connect to eastern Denmark, which is synchronized with the Nordic grid. As such, the non-synchronous connection requires a paired, back-to-back HVDC converter substation, to be located in Bentwisch, Germany, which already hosts the converter substation for the Kontek interconnector. The transmission capacity will be 400 MW, with the converter substation being delivered by ABB for around 140M US$. Thus, when Kriegers Flak operates at its full 600 MW capacity at least one third of the produced power must be transmitted to Denmark. The 220 kV cables to Kriegers Flak will be constructed and operated by Energinet.dk, with a planned spending of 3.5 billion DKK and planned commissioning by the end of 2018. The cable will reach Denmark at R√∏dvig on Zealand. Tender The result of a call for tenders for the construction of the wind farm was expected to be published by the end of 2016. By November 2015 seven companies and consortia had been prequalified to bid on the project; an unusually high number of bidders. The tender was won by Vattenfall in November 2016 at a fixed-price of ‚Ç¨49.90/MWh ($/MWh) with no adjustment for inflation, for 30 TWh (corresponding to 50,000 full-load hours for 600 MW, or about 11 years), without the cost of the unusual transmission project. , it is the lowest price for offshore wind. The price is 58% lower than the cap price of ‚Ç¨0.12 (90 √∏re) per kWh set in 2012. Build cost is estimated at ‚Ç¨1.1bn-‚Ç¨1.3bn ($1.19bn-$1.4bn). The turbines will be delivered by Siemens Gamesa, each yielding 8.4 MW. The low price was achieved by optimizing several aspects of the process, including the long- standing policy of authorities to prepare shovel ready projects with all necessary permissions. This method was also used in the previous low price record at Borssele where the price is ‚Ç¨72.70/MWh (‚Ç¨87/MWh with transmission). The method contrasts with the British way of tender, where applicants must perform preparatory work. Construction The construction site for the onshore substation in R√∏dvig in 2018 May 2018 saw installation of the three offshore converter stations that will transmit the electricity from the wind turbines to the onshore substations in Denmark and Germany and in November 2018 its dual electric connection to the offshore station of EnBW Baltic 2 was successfully tested.

At the time of its closing, which was captured in the film, Last Call at Maud's, it was claimed to be the oldest lesbian bar in the United States. Its history, documented in the film and other media, spanned almost a quarter century of LGBT events. History =1960s= Maud's was opened in 1966 by Rikki Streicher, a San Francisco lesbian and gay rights activist who would later go on to open another women's bar, Amelia's, and become a co-founder of the Gay Games. It was originally called \\"The Study\\", and later \\"Maud's Study.\\" As women were not allowed to be employed as bartenders in California until 1971, Streicher hired male bartenders and tended bar herself. Streicher stated about the creation of Maud's \\"I've always felt that bars were the most honest, open, free place that women could go,\\" and that she founded Maud's with a \\"no labels\\" policy, welcoming women who did not fit the butch/fem dress and manners code preferred by some other lesbian bars.\\"Heather Cassell, Maud's and Amelia's Made Space for Women,\\" Bay Area Reporter, 3 November 2010, in Citywide Historic Context Statement for LGBTQ History In 1967, the Haight-Ashbury became the center of the hippie movement's Summer of Love, bringing in new cultural mores with a new generation of lesbian and bisexual women, some of whom became regulars at Maud's. One patron of the bar was legendary singer Janis Joplin, who would visit Maud's with her lover Jae Whitaker. Other notable patrons of that era were Del Martin and Phyllis Lyon, poet Judy Grahn, and academic and activist Sally Gearhart. Maud's, said historian Nan Alamilla Boyd, was a \\"clubhouse, community center and bar\\" that served to \\"bridge the gap between San Francisco's lesbian community and its hippie generation.\\" In her memoir Making Butch, Sue-Ellen Case describes her first visit to Maud's in 1966: > I pushed open its plain black door to discover two dimly light rooms. The > long bar occupied the first room. It was illuminated by various neon ads for > beers, the warm, orange light from the juke box, and the garish surround of > the pinball machine. The other room afforded a central view of the pool > table, with its low-hanging lamp and a few tables along the walls.

As other lesbian bars in the San Francisco Bay Area created their own teams, bars competed against each other on public playgrounds, while fans gathered to root for their teams, and the winning bar hosted drinks for everyone afterwards. Pool tournaments were another social activity that bar patrons participated in.Deborah Goleman Wolf ,The Lesbian Community: With an Afterword, 1980 University of California Press, 1980, p. 103 Maud's also hosted variety shows, poetry readings, and a bowling team.Bonnie Zimmerman Encyclopedia of Lesbian Histories and Cultures, Routledge,Aug 21, 2013, p. 665 Writer Judy Grahn recalls how, during the 1970s movement of second wave feminism, she tried to bridge the gap between old- school lesbians and a newer more politicized generation by putting a political bookrack in Maud's to generate discussion: \\"While we hoped that people would sober up and turn the bar into a place of political discussion and interaction, instead, everything heated up socially as more and more women came out and joined the lesbian subculture.\\" Despite the plethora of lesbian bars and the 70's wave of gay and feminist liberation, Maud's bartender and later bar manager Susan Fahey remembers that the bar was once closed by an undercover police officer who saw a woman touching another woman's neck and recalls that as late as 1976, she would flick the lights on and off to warn patrons that the police were coming and to make sure no touching was going on. The Briggs Initiative, which would have prevented gay people from teaching in public schools, the election of Harvey Milk as the city's first gay supervisor and his subsequent assassination, and the 1978 attack on Peg's Place by off- duty members of the San Francisco Police were all issues that affected the San Francisco gay community, and the lesbian patrons of Maud's, during that time.We thought the world we built would be forever: An Interview with Lenn Keller By Adrienne Skye Roberts, San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, Open Space, June 12, 2012 =1980s= In the 1980s, as the AIDS crisis devastated the gay community of San Francisco, more gay and lesbian bar patrons began to adopt a 'clean and sober' lifestyle and look for other ways to meet each other.Last Call at Maud's, Paris Poirier, 1993.

Democratic politician Carole Migden began her political career when she decided to run for city supervisor during a conversation at Maud's. Then, in 1989, after twenty-three years in business, owner Rikki Streicher announced that the bar would close. In addition to the trend towards sobriety, and the growing availability of establishments and organizations where women could meet, Maud's once free- wheeling, countercultural clientele \\"had gotten more middle class, moved to the suburbs, and bought houses.\\" and business had deteriorated as a result. Depictions in culture and media On September 9, 1989, Maud's served its last drink. The event was documented in Paris Poirier's 1993 film Last Call at Maud's, which featured interviews with Streicher, bar manager Susan Fahey, and some of the bartenders, as well as patrons Del Martin, Phyllis Lyon, Judy Grahn, and Sallie Gearhard, and others. The film blends their reminiscences of Maud's with vintage footage to look at Maud's in the context of the history of lesbian bars from the 1940s through the 1980s. Patrons, known as \\"Maudies\\", reflect on the fun they had, the secretive and outlaw nature of lesbian bars, the bars' role in women's and LGBT history, and their capacity to change lives.Rebecca M.

It's as if the cultural moment and the tiny bar stand off, each alternately throwing down a card across the notion of history, each card changing the game. \\"Martha Baer, 'Last Call At Maud's, Village Voice, 1993 In 1979, Sue Ellen Case wrote a play about Mauds called Jo: A Lesbian History Play, which was staged at the Julian Theater in San Francisco.City Arts Monthly, 1980, p. 30Sue Ellen Case, \\"Making Butch\\", in Butch/femme: Inside Lesbian Gender, edited by Sally Munt, Cherry Smyth, Cassell, 1998, p. 39 In the 1990s, Case wrote about Maud's in her essay \\"Making Butch\\", which looked back on the 1970s as she had experienced it with the bar as \\"her central training ground\\". While acknowledging the valuable qualities of community bar life, the essay also discusses its addictive elements, as well as race relations and evolving gender roles. 'I watched lots of people drop out, go on welfare, or gain some kind of disability pay in order to live their whole lives there.' Case says. 'Why not? It was painful to live under the dominating culture.' She described the bar as a place \\"where lifestyle politics met closeted, ghettoized behavior, where middle class drop-outs, students and sometimes professionals met working class people who had slim, but tenacious hopes of doing better; where the 'sexual revolution' broke the code of serial monogamy, where costume and hallucination affronted sober dress codes and drink.\\"Sue Ellen Case, \\"Making Butch\\", in Butch/femme: Inside Lesbian Gender, edited by Sally Munt, Cherry Smyth, Cassell, 1998, p. 36 In Wide Open Town: A History of Queer San Francisco to 1965, Nan Alamilla Boyd discusses how homophile organizations like the Daughters of Bilitis were created in the early 60's to attempt to bring lesbians more into mainstream society, while bars like Maud's evolved to provide queer women a distinct space of their own. She describes Maud's as\\" a central gathering spot for a new and counter- cultural generation of lesbians for over twenty years.\\" Historical context Observers of LGBT culture have noted that lesbian bars, a common feature of the LGBT landscape in the 20th century, were disappearing in the 21st century. Reasons given range from gentrification to rejection of gender binaries to social media and online dating to less of a need for exclusive lesbian spaces as LGBT people are more accepted in society at large.Jen Jack Gieseking, On the Closing of the Last Lesbian Bar in San Francisco: What the Demise of the Lex Tells Us About Gentrification, Huffington Post October 28, 2014ALEXIS CLEMENTS, The Vanishing: Why are lesbian spaces disappearing, and what can be done to preserve our collective history?, Curve Magazine,June 8, 2014 After Streicher sold the establishment, a group of Maud's patrons held regular reunions in the bar, now called Finnegan's Wake. In June 2016, they gathered for the 50th anniversary of Maud's opening. Some at the reunion said they were motivated to attend by the recent shootings at a gay nightclub in Orlando, Florida. In the 1970s, one patron recalled, going to a gay bar \\"was an act of courage. Now we are full circle where going to gay bars has become an act of courage again.\\" Another remembered Maud's as \\"a special place\\" that \\"will never be repeated.\\" It was, the organizers said, their last reunion.

Illustration from Ruth Ogden's A Little Queen of Hearts (1893). Biography Fannie Ogden was born in Brooklyn, New York, in 1853 to Abigail (Murphy) Ogden and Jonathan Ogden, a merchant. Her much older brother Robert became a wealthy businessman. Educated in private schools, she married Charles W. Ide in 1875. They had a daughter, Alice. Under the pen name 'Ruth Ogden', she wrote popular children's books and also contributed stories and poems to magazines. Several of her books, such as A Loyal Little Red-Coat (1890) and Loyal Hearts and True (1899), are based in part on historical events. Critics often used the word \\"charming\\" to describe her books, and one critic praised her for \\"purity of tone, animation of spirit, and good English style\\". Her books were illustrated by F.C. Gordon, George T. Tobin, H.A. Ogden, and W. Rainey, among others. She died in Brooklyn in 1927.

If successful, the Red Compartida network will be the first fully wholesale mobile network deployed anywhere in the world. The awarding body is the Mexican ministry of transport and communications, La Secretar√≠a de Comunicaciones y Transportes (SCT) Red Compartida is developed by ALT√ÅN Redes, an emerging private Mexican company owned by the consortium‚Äîof the same name‚Äîthat won the domestic and international public tender process.  Background  Am√©rica M√≥vil, the company owned by Carlos Slim, the world‚Äôs richest person between 2010 and 2013, has long held a monopoly in the telecommunications marketplace in Mexico. In July 2014, it was reported in Forbes Magazine that Slim controlled 80% of Mexico‚Äôs landline market and 70% of the wireless market. According to the Los Angeles Times, Mexican consumers have long been complaining at the ‚Äúhigh costs and spotty service‚Äù provided by Slim‚Äôs companies. Over the years, Slim has been accused of engaging in anti- competitive practices ‚Äì for example, using his control over the telecommunications infrastructure to charge prohibitive connection fees to competitors. On July 9, 2014, the Mexican Government passed wide-ranging telecommunications reforms, designed to abolish long-distance phone charges, make it easier for customers to switch phone companies, and broaden access to free-to-air television stations. In response, Slim announced that he would reduce his market share substantially, and announced plans to sell off America Movil assets worth up to 7 billion dollars Under the new laws, the Mexican telecommunications regulator was required to establish a wholesale-only wireless network ‚Äî a ‚Äúcarrier‚Äôs carrier‚Äù that will sell mobile-network capacity to all comers. In 2015, the regulator announced the ‚ÄúRed Compartida‚Äù initiative. On November 17, 2016, Mexico‚Äôs Ministry of Communications and Transportation announced that the ALT√ÅN Consortium won the international tender process for Red Compartida . The new wholesale network is expected to begin operations by March 31, 2018, covering 30% of the Mexican population. The network will grow to provide services nationwide using all-IP network and 4G-LTE technology on the 700 MHz spectrum band, reaching 92.2% of the Mexican population. The network concession is for a term of 20 years with an option to extend for another 20 years. On March 30, 2017, ALT√ÅN Networks was formally established as the operator of Red Compartida thus completing the administrative process in relation to the mandate awarded through the public tender in November 2016, and the signing of the Public-Private Partnership in January 2017 . On March 15, 2018, one year and four months after ALT√ÅN was granted the project, Red Compartida was authorized to start commercial operations after reaching its first coverage milestone: 30 percent of the total population and 25% of the Pueblos M√°gicos. On March 21, 2018, President Enrique Pe√±a Nieto initiated the first stage of Red Compartida, 10 days before the deadline in the Public Private Partnership (PPP) contract. For the rest of 2018, network deployment continues as ALT√ÅN Redes, works toward its next coverage milestones. The next goal is to provide coverage to 50% of the total population by 2020 (at least 56 million people, 7.9 million of them in locations with less than 10,000 inhabitants, and 56 Pueblos M√°gicos).  Wholesale network  The Red Compartida network will be ‚Äúwholesale only‚Äù. This means that the company which builds and operates the network will not be involved in providing mobile service to consumers. Instead, the operator will provide access to the network to mobile operators, who will in turn use the network capacity to provide a consumer mobile product. Access to the network for these operators will be sold to the highest bidder in regular auctions. The advantage of a wholesale only network is that many new entrants can enter the Mexican consumer market at once. The cost of building a mobile network is prohibitive and requires billions of dollars in capital outlay. By providing the infrastructure through a wholesale only network, the cost of offering a new consumer service to Mexican customers will be significantly reduced. The Mexican Government expects the construction of the wholesale network, and the resultant entry of new providers to the Mexican market to generate 13 billion dollars of Foreign Direct Investment over a three year period  International Reaction  The Red Compartida project received international recognition at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, Spain, in 2016. An award was given to Mexico for its efforts in the area of ‚ÄúGovernmental Leadership.‚Äù According to Monica Aspe, Mexico‚Äôs sub-secretary for telecommunications and transport, receipt of recognition in this area was a landmark telecommunications development in her country. She explained that, in the past, ‚ÄúEuropean countries and China were almost solely the recipients of this award.‚Äù On the other hand, the giant US provider AT&T;, which has in recent years invested 4.4 billion dollars in Mexico, was reported to be ‚Äúparticularly discomfited‚Äù with the project, especially since as an existing operator, they would be barred from taking part.  Antitrust requirements  The Mexican Government requires that any bidder planning to construct the Red Compartida Network demonstrate that they have no ties whatever to any mobile service provider already operating in Mexico.  Timetable  An announcement awarding the project to the successful bidder was expected in October 2016. On 18 November, ALT√ÅN Redes consortium was awarded the project.  Potential bidders  Irish- American Firm Rivada Networks has announced that it will bid to build the Red Compartida network. Several other companies are believed to be considering bids.

In 1390 the McKiernans and their allies the Clan Muircheartaigh U√≠ Conchobhair entered into a conflict with the O‚ÄôRourke clan.

The Muinter Angaile, Muinter Eolais, Tellach Dunchada and Clann Muirchertaig, instructed by Domnall son of Muirchertach [O Conchobair] and Tomaltach Mac Donnchada, entered Connacht. The Clan Murtagh and Tellach Dunchada made a forcible migration into the country of the Muinter Ruairc towards Fid O Finnoice, Sliab Corrain and Cenel Luachain. O Ruairc got word of this in Glengavlin. He conveyed his trains to the upper end of Cenel Luachain and made a fierce and victorious attack on those allied princes and routed them, and kept on slaughtering their cattle from Bel Atha Daire Dubthaig to the top of the Brefne hills.

The Rock was pierced through and he escaped thereout and went to the castle of Loch-in-scuir and the clan of Muircertaigh Ua Concobuir followed him and he was killed by them in leaving the Loch. Ua Ruairc pursued the clan of Muircertach into Tellach-Dunchadha and they and the Tellach-Dunchadha were defeated, had the prey wrested from them and were pursued from the Ford of Daire-Dubain to Sliabh-Cairbri. The Annals of the Four Masters for 1390 state- A great war broke out between O'Rourke and O'Reilly; and the people of Annaly the O'Farrells, the Muintir-Eolais the Mac Rannalls; and the Clann-Murtough O'Conor, at the instigation of Donnell, the son of Murtough, and Tomaltagh Mac Donough, came to join in that war. Manus O'Rourke, who had been imprisoned by O'Reilly in the castle of Lough Oughter, made his escape from it, and went to the castle of Lough-an Scuir; but the Clann-Murtough, being informed of this by his betrayers, they slew him as he was coming ashore out of a cot. A peace was concluded between O'Rourke and O'Reilly; and O'Reilly received great rewards for banishing and expelling from him the enemies of O'Rourke. Owen O'Rourke and the son of Cathal Reagh were delivered up as hostages for the payment of these considerations. The Clann-Murtough and Teallach Dunchadha emigrated, in despite of the O'Rourkes, into Fidh-ua-Finnoige, Slieve-Corrain, and Kinel-Luachain. But as soon as O'Rourke, who was at that time in Glenn- Gaibhle, received notice of this, he took his scouts with him to the upper part of Kinel-Luachain, where he made an attack on them, and forced them to fly before him, killing both cattle and people on their route from Beal-atha Doire-Dubhain to the summit of the Breifnian hills.

Asetoyer is one of the founders of the Native American Community Board (NACB) and the Native American Women's Health Education Resource Center (NAWHERC). President Clinton appointed her to the National Advisory Council for Health and Human Services (HHS). She has been awarded the Woman of Vision award by the Ms. Foundation and the United Nations Distinguished Services Award.  Biography  Charon Asetoyer was born on March 24, 1951 in San Jose, California to a Comanche mother and father of European descent. She has been no stranger to activism and hardship, even in her young high school days. Asetoyer's first formulation of strategic protesting occurred in her high school cafeteria, where she staged a school- wide sit in as a way to protest the existing food conditions and demand a hot- lunch program. Her attempts worked and by the end of the week her school had implemented new lunch arrangements that met the desired standards. Fashion and women's beauty also had a profound impact on Asetoyer's young life; as a young entrepreneur, she started her own dress company from her home, and she later dropped out of high school in order to expand her business. Asetoyer referred to herself as \\"creative, independent, and an entrepreneur\\" and noted that she learned more in the coffee shops and streets of California than she would have in the halls of her high school. She moved to San Francisco and successfully ran her own dress shop until 1971 when she closed the boutique in order to enroll in San Francisco City College. San Francisco brought important elements into Asetoyer's life, including more activist opportunities and her marriage to Dennis Duncan. Her marriage to Dennis Duncan, officially initiated in 1972, led her into her first job that merged her activist work and women's health care; she worked as a WIC program leader and counselor at the Urban Indian Health Clinic in SF's financial district. Her job was one of the only beneficial things to come from her marriage to Duncan, his abusive nature led her to end their relationship in 1977 and resultantly compelled her to move out of California. Asetoyer relocated to Sioux Falls, South Dakota in 1977, and she enrolled in the University of South Dakota, where she matriculated from in 1981 with a bachelor's degree in criminal justice. 1981 was a monumental year for Charon, alongside college graduation, she married Yankton Sioux tribe member Clarence Rockboy, and migrated again, this time to Brattleboro, Vermont. While in the American Northeast, Asetoyer significantly expanded her education and her family. First, she gave birth to her first child, a boy named Chaska (American version is Charles). After Chaska's birth, the couple also adopted Clarence's abandoned nephew, Reynold James Brugier. Alongside maintaining a growing nuclear family, Asetoyer obtained a dual master's degree in 1983 for Management and Intercultural Administration from Vermont's School for International Training. Their time in Vermont was short lived. Abiding by Yankton Sioux tradition, the family returned to Sioux Falls, South Dakota in 1983 following the death of Clarence's father. Clarence was to serve a four-year sentence at the reservation in order to fulfill a cultural and religious memorial commitment after his father's passing. The return to Sioux Falls indicates the essential beginning of Charon Asetoyer's activist and political career.  In-depth activist work  Her work in California and her own abusive marriage pushed Charon Asetoyer to help more dislocated women, specifically Natives. In the early 1970s, the American Indian Movement (AIM) coordinated a walk from Canada and across the United States as a way to protest the forced sterilization of Native women by the government, and this caught the eye of Asetoyer, the young activist. The Indian Health Services, operating under the US government, had been estimated to have sterilized 25% of Native women age 15 to 44 in the late 1970s, without consent from the women or proper education given to them. AIM was a general effort to protest general treatment of Native Americans. In 1978, Asetoyer and many other women involved in AIM joined forces and sought to reconstruct and modernize women's role in the Native community, giving them back some independence within the family unit and in regard to their own healthcare. This group of more than 300 women separated themselves from the American Indian Movement in order to create a more specific group solely for women. These empowered women formed the group known as Women of All Red Nations. Charon Asetoyer's first activist organization was Women of All Red Nations, commonly abbreviated as WARN, and Asetoyer was the brain behind the business of this operation. Asetoyer created a subdivision of WARN that focused on women's healthcare. Generally, WARN aligned itself with the American Indian Movement that was growing throughout the American 1980s. WARN's objectives initially sought out to help Native American women that were underrepresented in society. Under Asetoyer's leadership of her branch, the organization's intentions generally targeted women's health and pregnancy issues that were prevalent on the Sioux Falls reservation, two of the most prominent being fetal alcohol syndrome and forced sterilization. Asetoyer's strong willed personality clashed with the politics of WARN, and in 1985, she abandoned the organization, and her own branch, in order to form a more meaningful program that operated precisely how she wanted it to. With the help of her husband Clarence Rockboy, Everdale Songhawk, Jackie Rouse, and Lorenzo Dion, the Native American Community Board (NACB) was born in Rockboy and Asetoyer's basement of their family home in Lake Andes, SD. The NACB started out with a broad mission and intended to help out Natives on the reservation and in the area with any problem they encountered. The NACB planned out certain campaigns in order to bring awareness to issues in the community, and their first project was centered around what Asetoyer worked on at WARN- fetal alcohol syndrome. \\"I wanted to get serious about this work. I felt that it was an issue that was plaguing our communities and that we really needed to get a handle on it.\\" By examining the causes of fetal alcohol syndrome, the NACB focused on educational initiatives for young mothers that would lead to better lives for mom and child alike. As Asetoyer and the NACB embarked on this journey to try and transform life on the Yankton Sioux Reservation in South Dakota, they uncovered even more issues among the community. While simultaneously working on the fetal alcohol syndrome objectives, Asetoyer was revamping the general knowledge of women in the area.  Creation of the Native American Women's Health Education Resource Center  Through conferences and seminars, Asetoyer worked to spread the word about acknowledging the issues at hand, preventative ideology, elements for treatment, and simply about the fundamental components that would increase the standard of living within the Native American community. By spreading awareness, she met other like-minded individuals that were also seeking change. Charon Asetoyer envisioned a designated center that would provide information and assistance in regard to the feminine and reproductive health of Native American Women, and in 1988, her dream became a reality with the creation of the Native American Women's Health Educational Resource Center (NAWHERC) where she was named executive director. \\"NACB established NAWHERC to provide ongoing comprehensive community health education among Native Americans and to impact policy issues that affect indigenous women nationally and internationally.\\" While creating NAWHERC, Asetoyer drew much inspiration from the National Black Women's Health Imperative after visiting their headquarters in Atlanta, Georgia. NAWHERC embarked on attacking a wide range of issues within the Native American female community, focusing primarily on elements relating to domestic violence and reproductive health.2 By the end of 1988, NAWHERC's success was adamant. It had already established a domestic violence outpost for victims and survivors, an extensive list of reproductive health programs, information on environmental safety elements, Native American cultural preservation, and was intently circulating literature in relation to AIDs symptoms, treatment, and prevention following the crisis that took place earlier in the decade. NAWHERC was the first organization in South Dakota to actively discuss the treatment and prevention of AIDs. The Native American Women's Health Educational Research Center revolutionized life in Sioux Falls with the help of Charon Asetoyer's leadership. As the center grew, it became known for its profound influence in leading Native women's health initiatives and community learning. Today, the NAWHERC branch functions as the primary headquarters for NACB activism. As time went on, NAWHERC vastly expanded their list of services to include things like general help forums (alcoholics anonymous, narcotics anonymous, etc.), more treatment centers for a variety of issues, more extensive health screening to involve prevalent concerns like breast cancer, nutritional services for children and adults, childcare services, and even more critical interests. Domestic situations are still one of the center's top priorities and NAWHERC seeks to bring attention to the rampant domestic abuse in Native families. NAWHERC sponsors a group where women can come together and share their experiences with one another on the topic, provide advice and information, and alert women of the safe spaces and shelters they offer; the center attentively pushes a 'woman's right to leave' campaign and extends help in a multitude of areas to assist women in escaping these detrimental and harmful situations. The center also makes sure that the voices of these women are heard, not just in the community, but at the state and national level as well.\\"NAWHERC's work has resulted in policy changes such as improvements in informed consent, the provision of patients with results for abnormal pap tests and mammograms, treatment for HIV+ patients, patient confidentiality, and the discontinuation of Norplant.\\"  Recent work  Alongside her establishment and running of NAWHERC, Asetoyer actively participates in women's rights conventions and she travels extensively to speak around the world. Asetoyer tried to continue her hand in politics throughout the early 2000s by running for Mayor of Lake Andes and state senate in two separate elections, but all attempts were unsuccessful. In the mid 2000s, she campaigned against gerrymandering in South Dakota and how polling centers actively prevented Natives from voting. In 2004, a polling place in Lake Andes, SD on the Yankton Sioux Tribe had an illegitimate sign that said in order to vote, a valid photo ID was required. Charon Asetoyer stood up against this injustice with the proof that it was not legal to require an ID and that there were government-accepted alternate documents, especially because Natives living in Yankton Sioux did not have IDs. Asetoyer claimed that poll workers were being force-fed incorrect information in order to cancel the Native vote, and at least twenty one Native Americans were turned away from the polls in just that location. Asetoyer and the community outcry gained the attention of South Dakota's Secretary of State, Chris Nelson. Nelson adamantly agreed with Asetoyer and set out on an initiative to educate poll workers and higher-ups authorities at the polls. More on the outside realm of politics, she has spoken at the World Conference for Human Rights, in front of the United Nations, and directly to US presidents. \\"Charon has also influenced political change at the federal level. President Clinton appointed her to serve on the National Advisory Council for Health and Human Services (HHS), and she has served on the National Environmental Justice Advisory Committee of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).\\" She works now to reverse the anti-abortion stance of South Dakota and identifies as a pro- woman, pro-choice democrat and still searches for political activist work. Alongside her political strides in the democratic community, the Native American women still remain at the top of Charon Asetoyer's priority list. Asetoyer published the book Indigenous Women's Health Book within the Sacred Circle: Reproductive Rights, Environmental Health, Traditional Herbs and Remedies in 2003, naming the author as NAWHERC so proceeds benefit her organization. The Indigenous Women's Health Book revolutionized knowledge and accessibility for the named women because it was the very first book to address the reproductive issues and feminine health of indigenous women. Charon Asetoyer has received numerous awards throughout her forty plus years of feminist activism for the Native American community, but her notable distinctions and accolades aren't stopping her anytime soon; Asetoyer says there is still an extensive amount of work that needs to be done in so many areas of focus. Charon Asetoyer learned the power of collective uniting at a young age with her in-school protest, and her own experiences as a woman pushed her to help the Native women in need. Over the span of her continuous career, Asetoyer has touched the hearts and lives of countless Native American women by standing up for their rights, protecting them, and giving them a feminist icon to look up to. Through her multitude of organizations, she has revolutionized living and health conditions for female Natives that may never have happened without her perseverance, even in the face of opposition.

History The Barton Hill district of Bristol was a rural retreat from the busy city centre up until the early nineteenth century when the digging of the Bristol Feeder Canal brought industries including the Great Western Cotton Company, keen to use the water as transport.Harvey C and Press J, Studies in the Business History of Bristol, Bristol Academic Press, 1988, page 9 Strong links with the cotton mills of Manchester and Liverpool were forged through a partnership between northern businessmen and sixteen other shareholders from prosperous mercantile Bristol. By 1864 when the business became a limited company, two directors were Bristolian, three were from Manchester, one from Liverpool and one from Eccleshall. Expert workers, many of them women, were employed directly from northern England to get production started and work the specialist machinery: :Hundreds upon hundreds of women and girls, with headgear consisting of red and white plaid shawls‚Ä¶ Many of them being Northerners, who appeared to be chatting cheerfully in a language which was simply double Dutch to the unlearned. A lot of the finance for new investment in Bristol in the nineteenth century was derived from profits from the Atlantic slave trade, as well as compensation paid to owners of slaves following the Slavery Abolition Act 1833. Robert Bright and George Gibbs, West India merchants, Gibbs Bright & Co. were active in the slave trade and both were original shareholders in the Great Western Cotton Company alongside the Manchester cotton manufacturer, Joseph Bell Clarke. Other Bristol merchants, bankers and businessmen who were shareholders of the Great Western Cotton Factory included William Edward Acraman, Alfred John Acraman, Peter Maze, Richard Ricketts, Frederick Ricketts, Henry Bush Thomas Kington the younger, Charles Pinney, Robert Edward Case, Henry Bush, Philip William Skynner Miles, George Henry Ames, Peter Freeland Aiken, James George, Daniel Cave and Joseph Cookson. Slavery compensation was used by a number of these shareholders to form initial investments in the Great Western Cotton Company. For example, Henry Bush invested some of his share of ¬£7,247 compensation (relative value in 2014: ¬£9,836,000 as income) for the emancipation of slaves on a Barbados plantation in the Great Western Cotton Company. By the end of the nineteenth century, board members included Albert and Lewis Fry, and members of the Miles and Harford banking families. The later nineteenth century saw a wave of strikes and threatened strikes from workers across Bristol. The Great Western Cotton Works was subject to strikes in 1858, 1864, 1865, 1869, 1873, twice in 1875, 1878, 1879, 1882, 1884, 1889 and 1900, almost always regarding cuts to pay or pay increases not being in line with those in Northern England. In 1925 the company had to go into liquidation following a recession, and the building was used by the Western Viscose Silk Company until 1929.

At the suggestion of English teacher Pearl Blivens, the school was renamed for Ohio-born poet Paul Laurence Dunbar (1872-1906) in 1928. In addition to academic subjects, the school offered a wide range of vocational training programs. Among the school's notable faculty members was Arthur Shores, a polymath who taught science, history, civics and literature. He served briefly as principal before becoming a notable civil rights attorney. Notable graduates include art collector Paul R. Jones and activist James Boggs. Long-time principal Jackson Solomon Abrams died in 1959 and a new high school then under construction was named in his memory.

Life Johann Jakob M√ºller was born at Jena in 1650. His father, another Johann M√ºller (1615-1688), was the deputy head of the city school. Johann Jakob M√ºller attended the school, then under the rectorship of Johann Martin Ringler. Recognising an exceptional talent, his parents also arranged for him to receive private tutoring at home from Anton Mosnern, a churchman from nearby Saalfeld. Aged only 15 M√ºller started attending lectures at the university. At the Philosophy faculty his teachers included Johann Frischmuth, Erhard Weigel, , , , Johannes Musaeus, Johann Wilhelm Baier and Friedemann Bechmann. In 1677 M√ºller received his degree, becoming a Master of Philosophy. At the university he became an Adjunct in the Philosophy faculty, supplementing his income with an appointment as a domestic tutor further to north. For the next thirty years he published a succession of disputations on a range of ethical topics. On 12 April 1692 he was appointed Visiting Professor in Philosophy at Jena. On 8 January 1695 he was appointed full Professor of Poetry and on 14 September 1698 he received the teaching chair in Logic. After receiving a licentiate in Laws on 23 October 1699,on 18 February 1700 he received his Doctorate of laws. On 5 September 1705 he took on the professorship of Ethical Moral Philosophy and Politics.

From about 1300 AD part of the wood was the scene of coal mining, which continued until around 1800. The traces of mining have been well preserved, and are now a scheduled site. The woodland is now part of the Harridge Woods Nature Reserve. Large areas were planted for timber in the mid-20th century, and this continues to be harvested. The nature reserve is steadily reintroducing the original flora. Environment The Harridge Wood mainly lies on clay slopes dissected by streams. It is thought to be very old, although large areas of the original broadleaf coverage was cleared in the mid-20th century and replaced by poplars and conifers. Remnants of the early forest are found in isolated patches, on the edge of the woodland and in wet areas. These include areas of old hazel coppice and low pollards (known as \\"stoggles\\") of ash, pedunculate oak and alder. There are diverse woodland flora in the less disturbed areas, including ferns in the wetter parts and woodland herbs in the dryer areas. In some places there are cow pastures beside the woods, which attract foraging bats, while other bats forage along the woods and streams. Mine workings In Harridge Wood and Edford Wood the coal seams outcrop at the surface and there are many remains of pre-18th century mining. The medieval and post-medieval coal mining remains in Harridge Wood and Edford Wood South were made a scheduled site under the Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Areas Act 1979 as of 17 May 2000. The site includes Edford Wood South, all of Harridge Wood East and part of Harridge Wood West. The site covers parts of the parishes of Ashwick, Stoke St Michael and Stratton-on-the-Fosse in the Mendip district of Somerset. The coal mining workings are examples of medieval and post-medieval coal mining that have been very well preserved by being incorporated in the woodland. They show a variety of mining methods employed before the 19th century. In the early days miners excavated the coal using bell pits, where they dug a shaft down to the coal, then excavated as wide an area round the foot of the shaft as was safe, giving it a bell shape. They then moved to a nearby location and repeated the process, spacing the shafts close enough to minimise wastage. 52 bell pits have been found in Harridge Wood East, the largest with a diameter of . Adits have also been found, horizontal passages for accessing the mines or draining waters, and leats that carried water to power machinery or drained water. There are mounds of excavated material and the remains of shafts. The coal field was active from around 1300 to 1800, although some small working continued longer. Nature reserve =Location= Path through Harridge Wood The Harridge Woods nature reserve is owned and operated by Somerset Wildlife Trust. The nature reserve includes five sites: Home Wood, Limekiln Wood, Harridge Woods West, Harrdidge Woods East and Edford Woods South. There are two nature trails with stops where points of interest are described. The Mells River runs through the western part of the reserve. The woods are a managed woodland, and lumber is extracted. The Cerberus Spel√¶ological Society controls all cave and archaeological related activity in the reserve. =Flora= Trees include various species of alder, ash (Fraxinus excelsior), hazel (Corylus avellana), Norway Spruce (Picea abies), pedunculate oak (Quercus robur), silver birch (Betula pendula), spindle (Euonymus europaeus) and wych elm (Ulmus glabra). Fungi include fly agaric (Amanita muscaria), King Alfred's cake (Daldinia concentrica) and scarlet elf cup (Sarcoscypha coccinea). Other plant species include bluebell (Hyacinthoides non-scripta), enchanter's nightshade (Circaea lutetiana), hart's tongue fern (Asplenium scolopendrium), lesser celandine (Ficaria verna), meadow saffron (Colchicum autumnale), nettle-leaved bellflower (Campanula trachelium), Solomon's seal (Polygonatum multiflorum), toothwort (Lathraea squamaria), wild garlic (Allium ursinum), wood anemone (Anemone nemorosa) and yellow archangel (Lamium galeobdolon). =Fauna= A dilapidated cottage has been restored as a bat house. Bats include brown long- eared bat (Plecotus auritus), greater horseshoe bat (Rhinolophus ferrumequinum) and lesser horseshoe bat (Rhinolophus hipposideros). Other animals include Eurasian otter (Lutra lutra), European badger (Meles meles), hazel dormouse (Muscardinus avellanarius), roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) and wood mouse (Apodemus sylvaticus).

The location of the bridge was chosen so that they could build it with a span of . Construction The 1.20 m wide pedestrian bridge consists of a grating, which rests on crossbars, which are attached to the four supporting cables with a diameter of 60 mm each by means of vertical hangers. On both sides of the tread a 1.35 m high handrail is mounted, which is connected to the grate through a wire mesh lattice. The supporting ropes are fastened on both sides of the bridge with a total of 16 anchors which extend into the rock to a depth of 17 m. The weight of the bridge is about 70 tons. One end of the bridge is 9.85 m higher than the other end. The pedestrian path is about 17 m between the two ends, and the sagging can increase by about one meter depending on the load and the temperature. The load bearing capacity is 1000 people, but for safety reasons only 500 people can be on the bridge at the same time, which is ensured by turnstiles at both ends. An entrance fee is charged for the use of the privately financed bridge, which is absorbed by the municipality in case of a minimum use. History In the spring of 2012, the planning of the H√§ngebr√ºcke Ehrenberg was made after the building permit was granted. The goal was the construction of the world's longest rope-hanging bridge, with a length of about 406 meters. The idea came from Maximilian Huttenloher (1952-2009) and was built under architect Armin Walch, who was also involved in the planning of the H√§ngebr√ºcke Holzgau. At the beginning of 2013, an investor was found for the project. The market township of Reutte, the European Burmese Museum Ehrenberg and the TVB Nature Park Region of Reutte signed the contract as the basis for the construction and operation of the H√§ngebr√ºcke. Start of construction for the highline179 was in April 2014, and at the beginning of May the groundbreaking started. To protect the trunk road to be crossed, a protective scaffold with switchboards was installed over a length of 20 meters. On October 29, 2014, the bridge was closed nine days after the last cable pull. The opening was scheduled for October 10, 2014 and was postponed to November 22, 2014 as a result of delays. After a thorough examination, the highline179 was included in the Guinness Book of Records as the \\"longest pedestrian bridge in the Tibet style\\". The Guinness World Records Certificate confirmed \\"The longest Tibet-style footbridge is a catenary-shaped walkway\\" which brought the distinction to the now opened, approximately 440 m long bridge in the Skypark of Sochi, which is constructed differently with fixed walkways suspended under a tension belt.

It was released for the Atari 5200, Atari 8-bit family, ColecoVision, Commodore 64, MSX, and ZX Spectrum. Hubbard previously wrote Dolphin for the Atari 2600. Zenji is a maze-based game, wherein the player controls a \\"disembodied, Mandarin-style head\\". The challenge is to connect a series of randomly rotated maze-segments in an attempt to align them with a glowing artifact, known as \\"the source\\", which acts as each maze's focal point. The player moves to each segment of the maze and attempts to rotate that portion so that the source's green light can shine into that region, signifying a correct alignment. If all portions of the maze are connected successfully before the end of a timer, the player is awarded points, and moves on to the next stage. Successive mazes introduce greater complexity and hazards to the player's survival. Reception In the conclusion of the review for the Commodore 64 edition of Zenji, the author in Compute! Gazette stated, \\"Although final understanding of the source remains elusive, Zenji is an undeniably enjoyable game\\". Of note, the last paragraph of the review also stated that, \\"Zenji appears to be a multiplayer game...up to 8 acolytes at a time...There's no documentation concerning this, however.\\" Gregg Williams reviewed the game for Computer Gaming World, and stated that \\"If you like geometric puzzles and games like Othello, you should like Zenji.

In 1955 he represented Guatemala in the second Pan American Games, having won the gold medal in rowing competitions, along with his team. He studied civil engineering at the University of San Carlos of Guatemala (USAC). At that time, he worked at the General Directorate of Roads and the Institute of Development of Municipal Works (INFOM), where he met Engineer Raul Aguilar Batres, great precursor of planning in Guatemala, who urged him to undertake graduate studies in urban planning. He attended the program led by Yale University, based in Lima, Peru, from 1960 to 1963. Upon his return to Guatemala in 1965, he continued to work in the INFOM as the first graduate in Urban Planning in the history of Guatemala. He then introduced urban planning methods that were used to make more effective the execution of public works and created the Center for Urban and Regional Studies (CEUR) USAC, where he taught until 1978, when he was appointed as the first manager of the Guatemalan Railroads, after its nationalization during the government of Julio C√©sar M√©ndez Montenegro. Between 1970 and 1994, with a team of professionals, developed several master plans for the cities of Rio de Janeiro (Brazil), Santa Cruz (Bolivia), San Pedro Sula (Honduras), Nairobi (Kenya) and Guatemala (1972- 2000). In 1986, as part of the activities of the Centre for Political Studies (CEDEP), he participated in the drafting of the new Constitution of Guatemala and, in the same year, was in charge of the formation of the new electoral system in the first election of a civilian government during the internal armed conflict of Guatemala (1959-1996).

Now the town of Royalton's principal commercial center, it developed in the second half of the 19th century around the depot of the Vermont Central Railroad. The district includes fine examples of Greek Revival and Victorian architecture, and is home to the Vermont Law School. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1976. Description and history The village of South Royalton was farmland prior to the arrival of the Vermont Central Railroad in 1848. Daniel Tarbell, a mill owner from Tunbridge, recognized the location as an ideal site for a freight depot, purchased land from the local farmers, and began commercial and residential development. By 1855, the village had 28 buildings, generally in the Greek Revival style, some of which survive today. Much of the village center's character, however, is derived from fires which swept through the area with some regularity. A particularly devastating fire in 1886 destroyed all of its commercial buildings, after which the Victorian block of brick shops lining the northwest side of Chelsea Street was built. with The district extends along Chelsea and Windsor Streets for about two blocks from their junction, with a few properties on Railroad, Safford, and New Streets. To the west of the main intersection, the district is ended after a single block by the presence of the railroad tracks. At the northeastern end of Chelsea Street it also included a now-replaced truss bridge across the White River. Its dominant features include the campus of the Vermont Law School on Chelsea Street, the brick Italianate line of shops between Windsor Street and the railroad tracks, and the park at the southwest junction of Windsor and Chelsea. At the southwestern corner of the park stands the South Royalton House, built as an inn serving railroad passengers by Daniel Tarbell in 1850.

The quarry was the source of the distinctive pink-grey granite employed in various prominent government and institutional buildings of the late Victorian, Edwardian and Georgian eras throughout Gloucester County. Bridge piers for much of the Intercolonial Railway were constructed with the quarry's stone. History Quarrying at the site was begun by Hannah (n√©e Hussey) Connolly's father William Hussey, some time around 1870. The quarry was later deeded to her, likely as a dowry. She and her husband, who worked in the quarry himself, passed it down through the family tree to her sons, Daniel P and Joseph E, who took it over as a business partnership early in the 20th century. Stone from this quarry was used to construct bridges for the Moncton-to-Campbellton section on the Intercolonial Railway. The stone first came to public prominence in 1886 through the agency of Fathers James Rogers and Thomas F. Barry, who specified its use in the Roman Catholic Sacred Heart church, now cathedral. Many people did volunteer work during the construction of the church, and this secured them a pew seat in the church for many years. In the early years of the 20th century, the Connolly brothers specialised in wharf and bridge pier work; their crews were seen to work along the entire St Lawrence coast of New Brunswick. The RCAF bases at Chatham, New Brunswick and Mont Joli, Quebec, were built by them during World War II. Joseph eventually would serve three two-year terms as mayor of Bathurst, and in 1961 was awarded the title Freeman of the City. The partnership between Joseph and Daniel Connolly was replaced in 1955 with Connolly Construction Limited, when the next generation grew into the quarry business. In the William C Connolly era, the corporation employed as many as 200 local men ‚Äì all of whom had been trained in house ‚Äì at peak construction times. In the last half of the 20th century, ownership turned to marketing the stone for retail purposes under the name \\"Bathurst-Gray\\".

It is in the Marquay commune on the right bank of the Beune River, a few kilometers west of Eyzies-de-Tayac, in Dordogne.  History  The site was discovered in 1908 by Raymond Peyrille under the supervision of Jean-Gaston Lalanne. Peyrille carried out its first rudimentary excavation in 1909 while Lalanne was working at the nearby site of Laussel. During this excavation a relief carving was found, one that has been described as \\"perhaps the most dramatic and impressive example of Upper Palaeolithic\\". Following the discovery of the frieze, work was undertaken in 1911 to build a protective wall around the shelter. This included lowering the shelter floor, a procedure during which a workman hit a skull with a pick-axe, breaking it. A relatively complete skeleton was uncovered and Denis Peyrony and Louis Capitan were brought in to examine it.Louis Capitan and Denis Peyrony , \\" Three new fossil skeletons ,\\" Anthropological Review , n o 22,1912, P. 439-442  Frieze  The frieze depicts a number of animals, some in haut-relief, dating back 15,000 years. These include ten horses (one measuring 2.20 m long), at least three bison, ibex and several incomplete figures. The sculpted frieze occupies 13 of the 16 meters of the shelter. Some of the carving is as much as 30 cm deep. Red ochre covers much of the frieze and some of the area around it is now difficult to see. Among other flint tools probably used to create the frieze were found Magdalenian burins and scrapers.  Magdalenian Girl  modern human skeleton of the Magdalenian cultural era, Cap Blanc rock shelter The skeleton known as Magdalenian Girl (or sometimes Magdalenian Woman) is that of an early modern human dating from 13,000 to 11,000 BCE during the Magdalenian period. It is the most complete Upper Paleolithic skeleton in Northern Europe. When Magdalenian Girl was acquired in 1926 for the Field Museum in Chicago, Illinois, by Henry Field, then curator of Physical Anthropology, it was hailed as one of the most significant acquisitions the museum ever made. On the first day the precious specimen was exhibited, tens of thousands of visitors flocked to the museum to see it. The skeleton is thought to have been likely buried deliberately. Paul Pettitt noted that \\"Large stone blocks were found over her head and feet, although no cultural items were recovered with the skeleton\\".

He allowed a batting average against of just .215 while facing 12,552 hitters in 3,158.0 innings of work. A notorious ground ball pitcher, he was able to induce double plays and provided solid numbers in hits and home runs allowed per nine innings, recording 7.7 H/9 and 0.6 HR/9, respectively. Later years Following his playing retirement, Minagawa served as pitching coach for Yomiuri, Hanshin and the Kintetsu Buffaloes between the 1970s and 1980s.

Early life  Mackworth was born in Monmouthshire in 1911, to an illustrious and well-connected Welsh coal-owner family. Her great-grandfather Sir Digby Mackworth, an officer in Wellington's army, married Julie de Richepense, the daughter of one of Napoleon's generals. Her aunt Margaret, Viscountess de Rhondda, was an editor of the newspaper Time and Tide. Her father, Francis Julian Audley Mackworth (1876‚Äì1914), a captain in the British Army, was killed early in World War I. Her mother was the former Dorothy Conran Lascelles. Mackworth had a younger sister, Helen Margaret Mackworth (1914‚Äì1938), who committed suicide at age 24. Mackworth moved to Sidmouth after her mother remarried, and she subsequently studied at the London School of Economics, where her aunt Margaret was also a governor. She did not graduate, absconding after two years with a Hungarian classmate, the economist Nicholas Kaldor.  Life and work  After leaving LSE, Mackworth spent much of the next two decades traveling. She married Leon Donckier de Donceel, a Belgian lawyer, at the age of 22 after meeting him in a Swiss sanitarium. The couple had one daughter before he died three years into their marriage. She spent time in Hungary and Germany, witnessing the burning of the Reichstag in 1933, before settling in Paris in 1936. Forced to flee Paris in 1940, she worked for the Free French during the war, in addition to giving lectures to the army and writing for Cyril Connolly's literary magazine Horizon. While in London she became familiar with a number of contemporary writers, including T.S. Eliot, who admired an early book of hers detailing her recent flight from France. In one notable incident during this time, Dylan Thomas' wife, Caitlin, stubbed a cigarette out on Mackworth's hand, on the grounds that Mackworth was acting too intimately with her husband at a party. She returned to Paris after the war, but traveled widely, including to Palestine in 1948, and to Algeria in 1950, following the path of Isabelle Eberhardt. In 1956 she married again, to the Marquis de Chaballes La Palice. The two were married until his death in 1980. Mackworth's first book, Eleven Poems, was published by Henry Miller in 1938. Her first major success detailed her escape from France in front of the Nazi advance, and route through Spain and Portugal to London, I Came out of France (1941). After the war she wrote studies on the poets Francois Villon (in 1947) and Guillaume Apollinaire (in 1967). She was one of two female journalists working in Palestine at the time of the birth of Israel, and published a book about the experience, The Mouth of the Sword, in 1949. Her book about Isabelle Eberhardt, based on her travels in the region Eberhardt had lived earlier, The Destiny of Isabelle Eberhardt, was published in 1954. She also published two novels, Spring's Green Shadow (1952) and Lucy's Nose (1992), as well as two volumes of autobiography, Ends of the World (1987) and Out of Black Mountains, the latter completed weeks before her death in 2006.

The game is based on the Hot Wheels toyline, and was unveiled at the American International Toy Fair in February 2000, as a competitor to Micro Machines. Hot Wheels Micro Racers was released on April 28, 2000, and came packaged with a free Hot Wheels car and poster. Gameplay Hot Wheels Micro Racers features mini Hot Wheels vehicles as the game's playable and computer- controlled racers, with gameplay consisting of arcade-style racing. The game features three race tracks, each one with their own unique hazards and obstacles: an office, a child's bedroom, and a beach. Three gameplay modes are featured: Single, Championship, and Pursuit. In Single mode, the player can choose any track on which to race. In Championship, the player must finish each race in first place in order to advance to the next race. Pursuit consists of a single race with three laps; the racer in last place explodes at the end of each lap, with the final remaining car being the winner. The player begins with two vehicles, while five more can be unlocked by completing championship races, and by finding secret areas and hidden stars in each track. Each vehicle is based on a real Hot Wheels toy, and each one has different handling characteristics, such as top speed and acceleration. A turbo boost can be used by the player to temporarily speed up, but must recharge after each use. The game includes a two-player option, in which both players play on a split screen. Reception Scott Steinberg of IGN criticized the game's limited number of race tracks and wrote, \\"Tracks, designed to look gigantic in relation to your puny Hot Wheels racer, are neither complex nor lengthy.\\" Steinberg praised the graphics but wrote that the game \\"would be considered less than half of a completed game under normal circumstances. Hot Wheels: Micro Racers looks sporty and plays like a charm, yet it serves up the same amount of longevity as a 'desktop diversion.'\\" Trey Walker of GameSpot criticized the game's \\"disappointing anticlimax,\\" writing that \\"aside from unlocking the hidden cars, there's no way to make a record of your racing success - there's no Hall of Fame to let you record your name on a high-score table or anything of the sort. As it stands, the only reward for winning at the pro level is that you get dumped back to the main menu.\\" Walker praised the game's graphics, and called the tracks \\"well detailed,\\" but wrote that a larger number of tracks \\"would have been a welcome addition, but to the game's credit, its few tracks do feature a number of interesting shortcuts and secret areas.\\" Walker noted the game's simple sound effects, and also wrote, \\"The background music is pleasant and upbeat, but it gets old after a few races.\\" Walker concluded that the game was \\"a modest value,\\" and wrote that it \\"provides a fun and enjoyable arcade-style racing experience from a toy-sized perspective.\\" Bob Mandel of The Adrenaline Vault criticized the small number of vehicles and tracks, as well as the small length of each track. Mandel also criticized the game's lack of basic options: \\"you may not tune or customize the cars at all, select the number of laps or number of opponents, control viewing angles, or see or save a replay of a race.\\" In addition, Mandel criticized the game's lack of realism and real-world physics, as well as its outdated graphics, and uninspired sound effects and music. Mandel wrote that the game would be too boring for adults and potentially too difficult for children. PC Gamer criticized the game for its \\"mediocrity,\\" writing that it would only be worth playing \\"in an world where Micro Machines doesn't exist.\\" Anthony Baize of AllGame wrote that the game \\"starts out well but quickly devolves into a repetitive, boring experience. Featuring flashy graphics and high-intensity sound, the game fails to reach its high potential due to a limited number of tracks and extremely difficult gameplay.\\" Baize felt that Hot Wheels: Crash! was a superior choice for Hot Wheels fans. Steve Hill of PC Zone called the game a \\"second-rate imitation\\" of Micro Machines and advised against purchasing it \\"because disappointment is inevitable.\\" References External links * Hot Wheels: Micro Racers at MobyGames 2000 video games Hot Wheels video games Racing video games Video games developed in Sweden Windows games Windows-only games ","title":"Hot Wheels Micro Racers"},{"id":"51393077","text":"Zander Insurance is an independent insurance agency headquartered in Nashville, TN.

He is also the president and founder of Tokyo-based startup All Nations Society Corp., a final expense company which specializes in prearranged funeral services, a business model common in the United States but a relatively recent model in Asia. In June 2003 Kamm started Japan‚Äôs first funeral only preplanning/prepayment firm: All Nations Society Corp Early life and education Kamm was born in Omaha, Nebraska in 1971 to Thomas and Diane Kamm. Kamm's father Tom Kamm was a city administrator who had to follow assignments around the country. John‚Äôs family lived in many cities before winding up in Denver, Colorado, where he earned his degrees. Kamm earned an undergraduate degree in geology and a minor in mathematics from the University of Colorado Denver. In 2001 he migrated to Japan for an MBA at Waseda University in a bid to gain entry into the Asian gold mining industry. His MBA thesis served as the platform for his startup. All Nations Society Corp Kamm decided to start the preneed funeral business (sei zen yoyaku) in Japan after researching the funeral industry in Japan. He predicted that demand for smaller funeral services would increase in future years, especially in big cities like Tokyo, where baby boomers from other areas tend to have fewer friends and family members left at their final moments. Kamm claimed his preneed business model was in response to many domestic funeral businesses' questionable sales tactics as well. Consumers reported being \\"cheated\\" by funeral homes, who presented lower service prices at beginning, and then pressured add-on sales until ended up charging millions of yen. Kamm's company offers a detailed price list of service options that allow consumers to choose service content and budget the expense, unlike Japanese companies that typically charge a fixed all-in-one fee. To distinguish himself from the traditional Japanese funeral business practice, Kamm promoted his company core values as \\"Transparency, Accountability, Dignity, Individuality.\\" In 2003, Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi pronounced the initiative to double foreign direct investment into Japan. Japan's new efforts to ease the foreign business's entrance to Japan benefited Kamm's venture. Kamm's new company, All Nations Society Corp, received help from the Japan External Trade Organization, that provides free professional services and office space for foreign startup companies. Kamm also has an alliance with an old world funeral parlor group called Sogi-hyaku-to-ban, meaning \\"Funerals 110,\\" which is the emergency number that Japanese can call when they need assistance.

Marjorie Lynn (Lynne) (July 21, 1921 Finley, Wisconsin - June 19, 2016 Ann Arbor, Michigan) was a singer who gained fame from WLS-AM radio in Chicago and the National Barn Dance, the precursor to the Grand Ole Opry. She began as a country-western singer and then transitioned to the swing style when she and her trio joined the United Service Organizations (USO) tour. Early years She was born Margaret Mossberg in Juneau County, Wisconsin to Swedish immigrants, and moved to Chicago at an early age. Her father Carl, who emigrated from Sweden in 1902 (with $4 in his pocket), worked as a carpenter and general contractor, and once painted the house of Ralph \\"Bottles\\" Capone, the brother of Al Capone. Ralph's granddaughter has written a book on her family's life in Chicago at the time which provides some valuable insight into the times that Marjorie grew up in. Her mother Elsie Nylin was born in Chicago to Swedish immigrants. (See Swedish Heritage below.) Marjorie was the youngest girl of 9 children. Both Marjorie's mother and mother-in-law were Blue Star Mothers during the war.  The Radio Years  She joined the WLS radio family in 1941 with little training, having only worked on the vaudeville bill with movie cowboy Buck Jones. She quickly had her own morning show, \\"Smile-A- While,\\" with the WLS Rangers and also appeared Saturday nights on the Barn Dance, choosing her stage name based on British singer Vera Lynn. According to the WLS archives, \\"she was placed on staff after one audition,\\" after meeting with Program Director Harold Safford and Production Director Al Boyd. She appeared on the Barn Dance with such talent as Pat Buttram (later famous in the role of Mr. Haney on the TV series Green Acres), Arkie the Arkansas Woodchopper,Arkie's hit I'm in the Jail House Now was featured in the George Clooney movie O' Brother Where Art Thou. the Hoosier Hot Shots, Lulu Belle and Scotty, George Gobel, and Gene Autry. Her signature piece was My Adobe Hacienda, written by Louise Massey and Lee Penny, although she never recorded it. Contemporaries of hers at WLS who were not in the Barn Dance include Les Paul (performing as Rhubarb Red) and Andy Williams (part of the Williams Brothers). When Marjorie left WLS in 1944, she was replaced by Jenny Lou CarsonJenny Lou recorded with the Prairie Ramblers in the 1930s and was the first woman to write a country-western hit, Tex Ritter's You Two-Timed Me One Time Too Often. on her morning show. In order to join the American Federation of Radio Artists (AFRA), she needed to play an instrument and so she bought a guitar from her fellow Swedish immigrants, the Larson Brothers, who basically invented the flat-top steel string guitar. The Larson guitars were the favorites among the stars at WLS because of their rich tone that transmitted exceptionally well over the radio. She taught herself and played guitar frequently on her radio shows. The Larson's Euphonon model was one of the first guitars that Les Paul electrified,Apparently Paul asked the Larson brothers to build him a guitar with a 1/2\\" maple top and no f-holes. They thought he was crazy, that it wouldn't vibrate. He told them that he didn't want it to vibrate because he was going to put two pickups on it. and so possibly was the original electric guitar. Larson guitars, although not well known, were played by such diverse artists as Gene Autry, Patsy Montana, Bob Dylan, Jimi Hendrix, and Johnny Cash. As a side note, Garrett Graff notes that WLS-AM became a Presidential Entry Point for the Federal Emergency Management Agency's emergency program in 2016.  The USO Tour  In 1943, she joined the USO to help the war effort as part of the show highlighted by Roy Smeck, the anointed \\"King of the Ukulele.\\" She was the lead singer of a swing trio called the Meri-Maids, all Wisconsin girls, that also featured Ruth Sanfheil and Mary Rumachick. They toured extensively in military hospitals in the United States throughout the war. They primarily sang songs popularized by the Andrews Sisters and Barn Dance favorites the Dinning Sisters. These songs are still popular, being sung by such artists as Bette Midler and Katy Perry. Later, the Dinning's younger brother Mark Dinning had the number one hit, co-written by Jean Dinning, Teen Angel.  Marriage and Children  After the war, she married Chester (Art) Anderson (1920-2000) of Batavia, Illinois, also the son of Swedish immigrants. His father Oscar emigrated from Sweden, traveling on the RMS Baltic, at the time the largest ship in the world. Oscar ran the Challenge Foundry in Batavia where Chester learned the foundry business. He served as a signalman in the US Navy in the New Guinea and Philippines campaigns, stationed on the USS LST-474. [Anderson returned from the Philippines on the destroyer USS Anderson that also carried some of the liberated soldiers from the Bataan Death March.] He was the uncle of renown Cincinnati Bengals quarterback Ken Anderson, whose father Erik also worked at Challenge. Chester earned his engineering degree at Purdue under the G.I. Bill. He was subsequently the chief metallurgist at Baker-Perkins, an expert on ductile iron, and later was a senior manager for foundries of Midland-Ross. He was also a championship horseshoe player. Marjorie and Chester had three children: * Carolyn (b. 1948), a specialist in early childhood development and gerontology * Gerald (b. 1950), a mathematician specializing in algebraic topology. He taught at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) as a C. L. E. Moore instructor, a position once held by John Nash (A Beautiful Mind). Later he was a senior manager at defense contractor Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC), concentrating on strategic nuclear warfare. * Christine (b. 1954), a periodontist and founding member of Vina Dental, a non-profit organization that provides dental services to low-income families. All three attended the University of Michigan.  Swedish Heritage  Marjorie's maternal grandparents were Nils Nylin and Wilhelmina Eklund. According to the parish records of Landsarkivet i Uppsala, \\"Nils Nylin admitted to be a Methodist,\\" despite the fact that it was illegal to subscribe to any religion other that the Lutheran Church of Sweden until 1860. Nevertheless, the Swedish-born children of Nils and Wilhelmina were baptized at the famed Maria Magdalena Church in Stockholm. Nils and Wilhelmina both worked for O. E. Jonsson, a wealthy landowner reputed to be a descendant of Bo Grip (the Griffin), the most powerful man in Sweden in the 14th century. Nils, Wilhelmina and their children emigrated to the United States, traveling on the RMS City of Chester, at the time the largest passenger ship afloat. Wilhelmina was a direct descendant of Erik X, King of Sweden,Erik was the first king of Sweden to wear a crown. (son of Swedish king Canute I and grandson of King Erik IX \\"the Saint\\") through the marriage of Erik's daughter Martha to Nils Sixtensson Sparre, a Swedish marshall. [See Ancestors of Martha Eriksdotter, which include rulers of Sweden, Denmark, Russia and Poland.] This union brought together the powerful Sparre and Bonde families. [See Swedish Noble Families.] Martha and Nils were also related to Charles VIII, the King of SwedenSome historians question the ties of Charles to Erik, claiming that the ancestry was created to give Charles creditability to be king. Given that Charles‚Äô established ties to Erik‚Äôs grandfather Erik IX \\"the Saint\\", a beloved king of Sweden, these claims seem to be unfounded. in the 15th century.  Later Years  The Andersons settled in Saginaw, Michigan, where Marjorie was a music critic and columnist for the local newspaper, the Township Times, performed in the Pit & Balcony venue, and sang in various groups such as the Sweet Adelines, where she didn't use her stage name but instead was known informally as Margie Baby. She sang in the choir of Ames Methodist Church for twenty years and in the Germania Orchestra, under the direction of Samuel Flueckiger. She finally settled in Ann Arbor and spent her time writing and with her many grandchildren and great-grandchildren. Marjorie proudly participated in the 70th anniversary remembrance of the end of the war in Europe held in Ann Arbor in May 2015, one of 26 local residents still alive who served. She and her husband are buried at Fairview CemeteryFairview also includes the gravesite of former Michigan governor George Romney. in Brighton, Michigan.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1998. The 1¬Ω-story, Late Victorian hollow brick structure was built in 1866 by Lucius Lane. The west wing may predate the rest of the house, being the log cabin that existed on the property when Lane bought it. with When building this house, it is possible that Lane was influenced by A. J. Downing's work, The Architecture of Country Houses (1850), which describes hollow brick wall construction, and Woodward's Country Homes (1865), which features a nearly identical floor plan to this house. The house's primary significance is its association with Carrie Chapman Catt, a leader in the American women's suffrage movement. She moved to this farm as a girl, and her father built the house. It was here that the attitudes that would guide her later life were formed during the 1872 Presidential election when she realized her mother Maria had no legal right to vote. She was educated down the road at a country school, and rode by horseback to Charles City for high school. She graduated from Iowa State College in 1880, the only woman in a class of 17, and she became a teacher in Mason City, Iowa.

The museum was declared officially open by local author and children's writer Michael Rosen on 15 October 2016 at a ceremony attended by hundreds of people in Pinner Memorial Park. It was the first London museum in over 40 years to be purpose-built in Greater London. Foundation Heath Robinson Museum permanent exhibition Gallery with curator Geoffrey Beare The William Heath Robinson Trust ran a campaign to raise funds for the museum, which started in October 2013. The museum passed the first round of Heritage Lottery Funding in March 2012, which led to its receiving a ¬£1.1 million grant in December 2013. Developed and created with funding from the Heritage Lottery Fund of ¬£1.3m and substantial donations from local patrons, residents and businesses, the new museum features two galleries, a permanent display covering the career of W. Heath Robinson and his illustrations and artworks, as well as a Special Exhibition gallery that hosts a programme of special themed exhibitions that change every three months.

The Trust is a partnership between local Pinner people and the William Heath Robinson Trust, custodians of the artist‚Äôs work. When Heath Robinson‚Äôs daughter Joan died, her husband wanted her collection of her father‚Äôs work to be kept in public ownership. As a result the William Heath Robinson Trust was formed in 1992. The original collection included about 500 pieces of original art work together with an archive of letters, association copies and special editions of the books that he illustrated, proof prints, advertising booklets and ephemera. The National Heritage Memorial Fund and the Art Fund grant-aided the William Heath Robinson Trust in 2015 to purchase some 400 additional important works for the Museum, bringing the collection to nearly 1,000.

Early life  d'Affry was born in Fribourg and was the eldest daughter of Count Louis d'Affry (1810‚Äì1841) and Lucie Maillardoz (1816‚Äì1897), the daughter of Philippe Marquis of Maillardoz. The d'Affry's were a military family: Louis d'Affry (1743‚Äì1810), her great-grandfather, was the first Landammann of Switzerland. Count Louis-Auguste Augustin Affry, the great grandfather of Adele, devoted himself to engraving and documenting scenes from military life. His son, Charles, served under Bonaparte. Ad√®le d'Affry had a younger sister, C√©cile Marie Philippine Carolina (1839‚Äì1911). After their father died on June 26 1841, Adele and C√©cile were raised by their mother. She grew up between Freiburg and Givisiez during the summer months, and Nice or Italy during the winter. Between 1853 and 1854, d'Affry received a classical education, including drawing lessons from Auguste Joseph Dietrich. It was during these years that she took modeling classes in the studio of the Swiss sculptor Heinrich Max Imhof in Rome. On April 5, 1856, Ad√®le d'Affry married Carlo Colonna (1825‚Äì1856) in Rome. A month later, he was knighted and received the title of Duke of Castiglione-Altibrandi. The marriage was very short as Carlo Colonna died suddenly of typhoid fever in Paris on 18 December 1856. d'Affry was obliged to return to Rome in 1857, to settle a dispute with the Colonna family over her husband's the estate. The Duchess took refuge in the convent of the Ladies of the Sacred Heart, Trinidad des-Monts. Her artistic vocation gradually awakened at that time. She took lessons in the workshop of Imhof, visited many churches and admired the works of antiquity and Michelangeo. In the fall of 1857, she modeled the bust of her late husband. This first sculpture was quickly followed by a self-portrait. In 1859, d'Affry went to Paris and rented an apartment from L√©on Riesener (1808‚Äì1878), a cousin of Eugƒóne Delacroix, at No. 1 rue Bayard. Pierre Andrieu (1821‚Äì1892), an assistant to Riesener and Delacroix, helped to decorate in fresco the dining room and workshop. The Duchess began to frequent the brilliant society of the Second Empire. She chaperoned her sister C√©cile until her marriage, on 29 October, to Baron Moritz von Ottenfels-Gschwind (1820‚Äì1907), an Austrian diplomat. Her rank in society led d'Affry to frequent the salons of the Faubourg Saint-Germain, and the shows held by the Comtesse de Circourt. The beautiful Duchess built lasting friendships, including with Adolphe Thiers and Auguste Joseph Alphonse Gratry. Art work d'Affry worked on her first successful composition, La Belle H√©l√®ne (1860). She studied animal drawing at the Natural History Museum under the direction of sculptor Antoine-Louis Barye, and modeled from nature. Auguste Cl√©singer monitored her progress. From December, she took anatomy classes from Professor Sappey in the basement of the School of Medicine. On September 6 1860, during a dinner at the Barbier, Adele met Eug√®ne Delacroix. d'Affry's bust of 'Bianca Capello at the Palace of Fontainebleau In 1861, her application to study at the √âcole nationale sup√©rieure des Beaux-Arts was rejected. Back in Rome, d'Affry admired the Villa Medici group of Ugolino and his children by Jean-Baptiste Carpeaux. The friendship between the two artists only ceased with the death of Carpeaux. In 1863, d'Affry chose, after much hesitation, to exhibit at the Paris Salon under the pseudonym \\"Marcello\\". She had three busts: Bianca Cappello, the Portrait of Count G. N ... [icola√ø] and the portrait of the Duchess of San C ... [Esario], a work in wax. The success met by her Bianca gained the attention of the Empress Eugenie, who invited her to participate in one of the famous Tuileries Monday. d'Affry was then invited to the court, alongside Napoleon III, whom she greatly admired. During February 1864, d'Affry received Jean-Baptiste Carpeaux in Givisiez, and rejected the marriage proposal presented by Carpeaux for his son. Marcello exhibited the Gorgon, a marble bust in the 1865 Salon; she received the official order of a portrait of the Empress Eugenie, which was intended to decorate the throne room of the city hall of Paris. d'Affry produced four different versions of this bust. During the months of June and July, 1866, d'Affry left for London and monitored the reception of her bronze bust of The Gorgon, which was exhibited at the Royal Academy. Her admiration for the queen Marie Antoinette, she shared with the Empress Eugenie, has led her to complete the busts of Marie Antoinette at Versailles and Marie Antoinette at the Temple. She presented to the Salon in Paris in May until November 1866, a bust of the Empress, which was harshly criticized and rejected by the Commission of fine arts of the city of Paris. She feared having fallen out of favor with Eugenie. Eventually, the prefect Haussmann made the decision to accept the bust. d'Affry's Pythia at the Paris Opera d'Affry presented eight of her works, including Hecate, the Emperor Napoleon III commissioned for the gardens of Compi√®gne, at the Universal Exhibition of 1867, in the section of the Papal States. Then, accompanied by her mother, she traveled during May and June 1867 across Austria, Germany and Hungary. In Budapest, the two women attended the coronation of Empress Elisabeth. On her return to Paris, d'Affry made a small marble bust of Elisabeth. Between March and August 1868, d'Affry traveled in the north of Italy and stopped in Rome. At Cauterets, in the Pyrenees, she crossed the border and traveled to Spain, where she was caught in an insurrection. Despite the dangers of this situation, she remained in Madrid where she worked with her friends, the painters Henri Regnault and Georges Clairin. She met the revolutionary General Milans del Bosch, and she modeled his bust. Letters of recommendation from Prosper M√©rim√©e, opened the doors for her of the Prado Museum. She admired, among others, the works of Diego Vel√°zquez. From Freiburg, where she lived since January 1876, d'Affry returned to Italy, visiting Florence, Orvieto, Rome, Bologna, Ferrara, Ravenna, Padua, Venice, Verona and Milan. The director of the Uffizi Gallery commissioned a portrait. Her bust of Baroness of Keffenbrinck, presented at the Salon of that year earned her a mere honorable mention. Illness and death In 1877, exhausted by her cough and joint pain, d'Affry spent December in Italy, on the advice of her doctors. In 1878, d'Affry moved constantly between Naples, Switzerland and Paris, in search of a climate that would calm her hemoptysis. On January 2, a second version of her will listed the sculptures she bequeathed to the State of Fribourg, provided that a museum be dedicated to her work. Based in Castellammare di Stabia in 1879, d'Affry put her papers in order, working on writing her memoirs which were left unfinished. She died of tuberculosis on 14 July 1879.Tatiana Silvestri, ¬´ Biographie ¬ª dans Mina 2014, p. 115-119.

Goldziher argued (in the words of R.S. Humphreys), \\"that a vast number of hadith accepted even in the most rigorously critical Muslim collections were outright forgeries from the late 8th and 9th centuries ‚Äî and as a consequence, that the meticulous isnads which supported them were utterly fictitious\\".Humphreys, R.S. Islamic History, A Framework for Inquiry, Princeton, 1991, p.83 Schacht argued Islamic law was not passed down without deviation from Muhammad but \\"developed ... out of popular and administrative practice under the Umayyads, and this practice often diverged from the intentions and even the explicit wording of the Koran ... norms derived from the Koran were introduced into Muhammadan law almost invariably at a secondary stage.\\"Ibn Rawandi, \\"Origins of Islam\\", 2000: p.97 The revisionists extended this argument beyond hadith to other facets of Islamic literature ‚Äî sira (Muhammad's biography), the history of the Quran's formation, and the historical developments under the first Islamic dynasty, the Umayyad Caliphate. The true historical events in the earliest times of Islam have to be newly researched and reconstructed (revisionists believe) by applying the historical-critical method, or alternately, in the words of Cook and Crone, historian must \\"step outside the Islamic tradition altogether and start again\\".Hagarism; The Making Of The Islamic World Crone, Cook, p.3 This requires using the #\\"source-critical approach to both the Koran and the Muslim literary accounts of the rise of Islam, the Conquest and the Umayyad period\\"; Neva & Koren, \\"Methodological Approaches to Islamic Studies\\", 2000: p.426 #comparing traditional accounts with ##accounts from the seventh and eighth century CE that are external to the Muslim tradition; ##archaeology, epigraphy, numismatics from the seventh and eighth century CE -- sources which should be preferred when there is a conflicts with Muslim literary sources.Neva & Koren, \\"Methodological Approaches to Islamic Studies\\", 2000: p.426 Revisionists believe that the results of these methods indicates that (among other things) the break between the religion, governance, culture of the pre-Islamic Persian and Byzantine civilization, and that of the 7th century Arab conquerors was not as abrupt as the traditional history describes (an idea advanced in the statement of the Fifth colloquium of the Near Eastern History Group of Oxford University). Colloquium organizers argued that if \\"we begin by assuming that there must have been some continuity, we need either go beyond the Islamic sources or ... reinterpret them\\".statement of the July 1975 Fifth colloquium of the Near Eastern History Group of Oxford University, cited in The designation Revisionism was coined first by the opponents of the new academic movement and is used by them partially still today with a less than positive connotation.Cf. e.g. Fran√ßois de Blois, Islam in its Arabian Context, S. 615, in: The Qur'an in Context, ed. by Angelika Neuwirth etc., 2010. Judith Herrin, Patricia Crone: memoir of a superb Islamic Scholar, openDemocracy 12 July 2015 Then, the media took up this designation in order to call the new movement with a concise catchword.Cf. e.g. Toby Lester: Today, also the adherents of the new movement use Revisionism to designate themselves, yet mostly written in quotation marks and with a slightly self-mocking undertone.Cf. e.g. Patricia Crone: Among the Believers, Tablet Magazine 10 August 2010  Major representatives  Among the \\"foremost\\" proponents of revisionism are/were John Wansbrough (1928-2002), Patricia Crone (1945-2015), Michael Cook, Yehuda D. Nevo (1932-1992, and Fred M. Donner. The new movement originated at the SOAS (School of Oriental & African Studies) at the University of London with the publications of two works by Wansbrough: Quranic Studies (1977) and The Sectarian Milieu (1978). Andrew Rippin (1950-2016), Norman Calder, G. R. Hawting, Patricia Crone and Michael Cook were students of Wansbrough. In 1977 Crone and Cook published Hagarism, which postulated -- among other things -- that Islam was established after, not before, the Arab conquests and that Mecca was not the original Islamic sanctuary. Later, both distanced themselves from the theses of Hagarism as too far reaching, but continued to \\"challenge both Muslim and Western orthodox views of Islamic history\\". Martin Hinds (1941-1988), also studied at SOAS and Robert G. Hoyland was a student of Patricia Crone. In Germany at the Saarland University, G√ºnter L√ºling (1928-2014) and Gerd-R√ºdiger Puin focused on the historical-critical research of the development of the Quran starting in the 1970s, and in the 2000s, Karl-Heinz Ohlig, Volker Popp, Christoph Luxenberg and Markus Gro√ü argued that Muhammad was a legendary, not historical figure. Hans Jansen from the Netherlands published a work in 2005/7 arguing in detail why (he believed) known accounts of Muhammad's life were legendary. Yehuda D. Nevo also questioned the historicity of Muhammad. Sven Kalisch, a convert to Islam, taught Islamic theology before leaving the faith in 2008Neues Aufgabengebiet f√ºr Sven Kalisch WWU Munster 13 July 2010 when he questioned the historicity of Mohammad (as well as Jesus and Moses). James A. Bellamy has done textual criticism of the Quran and his proposed \\"emendations\\", i.e. corrections of the traditional text of the Quran. Fred Donner, in his several books on early Islamic history has argued that only during the reign Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan (685-705) did the early ecumenical monotheism of the Arab conquerors begin to separate from Christians and Jews. Popular historian Tom Holland's work In the Shadow of the Sword (2012) has popularized the new research results and depicted a possible synthesis of the various revisionist approaches. =Historical description of the school= The influence of the different tendencies in the study of Islam in the West has waxed and waned. Ibn Warraq believes \\"the rise of this revisionist school\\" may be dated from the Fifth colloquium of the Near Eastern History Group of Oxford University in July 1975, and Robert Hoyland believes revisionists were ascendant in the 1970s and 1980s. Prior to that, from World War II to sometime around the mid-1970s, there was what scholar Charles Adams describes as \\"a distinctive movement in the West, represented in both religious circles and the universities, whose purpose\\" was to show both a \\"greater appreciation of Islamic religiousness\\" and to foster \\"a new attitude toward it\\" And in doing so make \\"restitution for the sins of unsympathetic, hostile, or interested approaches that have plagued the tradition of Western Orientalism\\". cited in Herbert Berg gives Wilfred Cantwell Smith and W. Montgomery Watt as examples of proponents of this \\"irenic approach\\" (traditionalist) approach to Islamic history, and notes that the approach necessarily clashed with the questions and potential answers of revisionists since these clashed with Islamic doctrine. Hoyland believes the heyday of revisionism, diminished as the \\"public profile of Islam\\" increased \\"massively\\" sometime after the 1980s, when, (Hoyland argues) the tendency towards \\"left-leaning\\" liberalism \\"shy of criticizing Islam\\", of Western academics \\"favored the traditionalist approach\\" while \\"pushing skeptics/revisionists to become more extreme.\\" (Hoyland seeking to find a middle way between revisionism and avoiding criticism.)  The thesis of the implausibility of the traditional Islamic accounts  The arguments against the plausibility of the classical Islamic traditions about Islam's beginnings were summarized by Hans Jansen in his work De Historische Mohammed. Jansen discusses chapter by chapter the depictions in the prophet's biography by Ibn Ishaq, by way of Ibn Hisham (d.833), which is an important text for traditional Islam. Jansen reveals self-contradictions; contradictions with other historical sources; embellishments by later authors; politically or theologically motivated distortions of the depiction; symbolic meanings of allegedly historical names; literary construction of the depiction according to biblical models; and chronological and calendrical improbabilities. Some examples:Cf. Jansen, De Historische Mohammed, 2005/7 * The most accurate dating of so many events by an author who writes 150 years later lacks credibility. * Although there were leap months at the time of Muhammad, which had to be inserted frequently into the lunar calendar, and which only later became abandoned (allegedly by Muhammad), not a single of the many most accurately dated events depicted by Ibn Ishaq falls in a leap month. * The depiction of a close relationship between Muhammad and his wife Aisha has a strong political and theological motivation: Aisha was the daughter of Abu Bakr, who became Muhammad's successor against the claims of his rival, Ali. In order to defend this succession against the claims of the Shia, who were in favour of Ali, the relationship of Abu Bakr's daughter to Muhammad became emphasized: That Aisha allegedly was the favourite wife of Muhammad, and that various hadith state that Aisha was either nine or ten years old when the prophet consummated the marriage. * The depiction of the slaughter of the Jewish tribe of the Banu Qurayza also has a strong political and theological motivation: As the Constitution of Medina shows, the Jews were initially part of the Ummah and were addressed as \\"believers\\"; cf. the research of Fred Donner. When Islam later separated from Judaism, antisemitic readings of the past came into being. The threefold treason of Muhammad by three Jewish tribes is a literary construction according to biblical models, e.g. the threefold treason of Jesus by the Apostle Peter, and thus is historically questionable. There are other traditions about the same event which tell that only the leaders of the tribe had been punished, but not every single member of the tribe. The names of the three Jewish tribes do not occur in the Constitution of Medina. Finally, such a mass slaughter would not have gone unnoticed, not even in Muhammad's time, and especially not considering that the victims were Jews, who had international trade networks, and are known to record their history. Most likely, the slaughter of the Banu Quraiza never happened. * The depictions of Ibn Ishaq are generally known to give questionable accounts of the capabilities of the prophet, such as satisfying all his wives in one night and killing more enemies than in similar hadith stories. In the same category is the depiction of Muhammad as illiterate: the revelation of the Quran becomes even more miraculous, and the capabilities of the prophet even more astonishing. * The account of Muhammad's letters to the Heads-of-State, saying that they should convert to Islam ‚Äî according to traditional Islamic historiography, he sent ambassadors with such letters to Heraclius the Caesar of Byzantium, Chosroes II the Khosrau of Persia, the Negus of Abyssinia, Muqawqis the ruler of Egypt, Harith Gassani the governor of Syria, Munzir ibn Sawa and to the ruler of Bahrain ‚Äî retrospectively justifies the Arabic expansion as a religious, Islamic expansion. Jansen points out that because of the cryptic nature of the Quran, which usually alludes to events rather than describing them, and seldom describes the situation for which a revelation was made, the historically questionable traditions are of great importance for the interpretation and understanding of the Quran. Many Islamic traditions came into being long after Muhammad on the basis of mere guesses for what situation a Quranic verse had been revealed. Because of these historically questionable traditions, the interpretation of the Quran has been restricted ever since. In her work Meccan Trade and the Rise of Islam, Patricia Crone gives a general examination of the credibility of Islamic traditions. This work is often cited in literature and discusses a few aspects of Muhammad's biography, which are intended to illustrate the nature of Islamic traditions. Concerning the encounter of the young Muhammad with Jews who recognize him as a prophet, and other stories, Crone writes: \\"These stories are no different from those on Muhammad's encounter with Jews and others. Being non-miraculous, they do not violate any laws of nature, of course, and in that sense they could be true. In fact, they are clearly not. [...] We cannot even tell whether there was an original event: in the case of Muhammad's encounter with the Jews and others there was not. Either a fictitious theme has acquired reality thanks to the activities of storytellers or else a historical event has been swamped by these activities.\\"Patricia Crone: Meccan Trade and the Rise of Islam,1987, p. 222  The new theses about the beginnings of Islam  The events in early Islamic times have to be newly researched and reconstructed with the help of the historical-critical method. In the following the theses of the revisionists in broad outline: * The Quranic text as is in use today shows many differences to the earliest existing manuscripts. A core part of the Quran may derive from Muhammad's annunciations, yet some parts of the Quran were definitively added later or were reworked later. In addition to this, many small deviations came into the text as with other ancient texts which were manually copied and copied again.John Wansbrough: Quranic Studies: Sources and Methods of Scriptural Interpretation (1977) pp. 43 ff.; Gerd- R√ºdiger Puin: Observations on Early Qur'an Manuscripts in San‚Äôa‚Äô, in: Stefan Wild (Hrsg.): The Qur‚Äôan as Text. Brill, Leiden 1996; pp. 107-111 * The existence and significance of the prophet Muhammad as a historical person depends especially on the question whether any, and if so, how many, parts of the Quran can be attributed to his time, or whether all or most parts of the Quran came into being only after Muhammad's time. The researchers' opinions differ over this question.Yehuda D. Nevo: Crossroads to Islam: The Origins of the Arab Religion and the Arab State (2003); Karl-Heinz Ohlig (Hrsg.): Der fr√ºhe Islam. Eine historisch-kritische Rekonstruktion anhand zeitgen√∂ssischer Quellen (2007) Fred Donner suggests an early date for the Quran.Fred Donner: Narratives of Islamic Origins: The Beginnings of Islamic Historical Writing (1998), p. 60 * The Quran is not written in a \\"pure\\" Arabic as the Syriac language seems to have had a certain influence on the language of the Quran which was forgotten later. This could be a possible explanation of why a fifth of the Quranic text is difficult to understand.Karl-Heinz Ohlig (Hrsg.): Der fr√ºhe Islam. Eine historisch-kritische Rekonstruktion anhand zeitgen√∂ssischer Quellen (2007) pp. 377 ff.; Christoph Luxenberg: The Syro-Aramaic Reading of the Koran ‚Äì A Contribution to the Decoding of the Koran (2007). * Islam did not rise among polytheistic pagans in the desert, but in a milieu where Jewish and Christian texts were well-known. The \\"infidels\\" were no pagan polytheists but monotheists who were polemically considered to deviate slightly from monotheism.G. R. Hawting: The Idea of Idolatry and the Rise of Islam: From Polemic to History (1999); Fred Donner: Muhammad and the Believers. At the Origins of Islam (2010) p. 59 * The geographical descriptions in the Quran and later traditions do not fit Mecca. They rather point to a place somewhere in north-western Arabia, e.g. Petra in Jordan.Patricia Crone / Michael Cook: Hagarism (1977) pp. 22-24; Patricia Crone: Meccan Trade and the Rise of Islam (1987); and the private researcher Dan Gibson: Quranic Geography (2011) * The connection between Muslims and Jews was very close in the early times of Islam. Jews too were called \\"believers\\" and were part of the umma. Antijewish texts such as, for example, the account of the slaughter of the Jewish tribe of Banu Qurayza came into being long after Muhammad when Islam had separated from Judaism.Fred Donner: Muhammad and the Believers. At the Origins of Islam (2010) pp. 68 ff.; cf. also Hans Jansen: Mohammed (2005/7) pp. 311-317 (German edition 2008) * In the beginning, secular and spiritual power were united in the person of the caliph. There were no special religious scholars. Religious scholars came into being only later and conquered the spiritual power from the caliphs.Patricia Crone / Martin Hinds: God's Caliph: Religious Authority in the First Centuries of Islam (1986) * The Islamic expansion was probably not Islamic, religiously motivated, expansion, but a secular, Arab expansion. The expansion did not yet result in oppression of the non-Muslim population.Robert G. Hoyland: In God's Path. The Arab Conquests and the Creation of an Islamic Empire (2015) * After Muhammad there were at least two phases which were of major importance for the formation of Islam in its later shape: ** Under the Umayyad caliph Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan the Dome of the Rock in Jerusalem was built. There the word \\"Islam\\" appears for the first time. Until this moment the Muslims called themselves simply \\"believers\\", and coins were minted in the Arabic empire showing Christian symbols. Abd al-Malik also plays a major role in the reworking of the Quranic text.Patricia Crone / Michael Cook: Hagarism (1977) p. 29; Yehuda D. Nevo: Crossroads to Islam: The Origins of the Arab Religion and the Arab State (2003) pp. 410-413; Karl-Heinz Ohlig (Hrsg.): Der fr√ºhe Islam. Eine historisch-kritische Rekonstruktion anhand zeitgen√∂ssischer Quellen (2007) pp. 336 ff. ** It was during the Abbasid Caliphate that practically all Islamic traditional texts about Islam's beginnings were written. The Abbasids as the victorious party in the conflict with the Umayyads had great interest in legitimizing their rule. This motivation obviously crept into the traditional texts.Patricia Crone: Slaves on Horses. The Evolution of the Islamic Polity (1980) pp. 7, 12, 15; auch Hans Jansen: Mohammed (2005/7)  Criticism of Revisionism  The consequent historical- critical analysis of early Islam met severe resistance in the beginning since then provocative theses with far-reaching meaning were published without sufficient evidence. Especially Patricia Crone's and Michael Cook's book Hagarism (1977) stirred up a lot of harsh criticism. Important representatives of Revisionism like Patricia Crone or Michael Cook meanwhile distanced themselves from such radical theses and uncautious publications. Cf. e.g. Toby Lester: What is the Koran?, in: The Atlantic, issue January 1999 Criticism is expressed by researchers like Tilman Nagel, who aims at the speculative nature of some theses and shows that some revisionists lack some scholarly standards. On the other hand, Nagel accepts the basic impulse of the new movement, to put more emphasis on the application of the historical-critical method.Cf. e.g. Tilman Nagel: Befreit den Propheten aus seiner religi√∂sen Umklammerung! in: Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung 21 September 2009 A certain tendency to take revisionists seriously becomes obvious e.g. by the fact that opponents address their criticism not any longer to \\"revisionism\\" alone but to \\"extreme revisionism\\" or \\"ultra-revisionism\\".Cf. e.g. Marion Holmes Katz: Body of Text: The Emergence of the Sunni Law of Ritual Purity (2012), p. 27 Gregor Schoeler discusses the revisionist school and depicts the early controversies. Schoeler considers revisionism to be too radical yet welcomes the general impulse: \\"To have made us thinking about this all and much more remarkable things for the first time -- or again, is without any doubt a merit of the new generation of the 'skeptics'.\\"Gregor Schoeler, Charakter und Authentie der muslimischen √úberlieferung √ºber das Leben Mohammeds, de Gruyter 1996. pp. 18 f., 23 f. 142 f.; original citation p. 24: \\"dies alles und noch manches Beachtenswerte mehr uns zum ersten Mal -- oder erneut -- zu bedenken gegeben zu haben, ist zweifellos ein Verdienst der neuen Generation der 'Skeptiker'.\\" Fran√ßois de Blois rejects the application of the historical-critical method to Islamic texts. He argues that this method was developed for Christian texts and thus there is no reason to apply this method to Islamic texts, too.Cf. e.g. Fran√ßois de Blois, Islam in its Arabian Context, p. 615, in: The Qur'an in Context, ed. by Angelika Neuwirth etc., 2010  A challenge for reflection and reform to Islam  By nature new findings about the early times of Islam touch the identity of the Islamic religion. Thus it is a justified claim of religious people that any research concerning their religion has to progress with high diligence and cautiousness in order to avoid unnecessary irritations. At the same time it is a justified claim by academics that they can do their research freely and without any restraint, even if the results run contrary to religious teachings.Cf. Karl-Heinz Ohlig: Wissenschaftliches Arbeiten in der Islamwissenschaft, in: imprimatur No. 41, 2008 The gravity of irritation provided to Islam depends on the question whether core teachings of Islam are touched or not, especially the historicity of Muhammad and the attribution of the Quran to Muhammad. According to this question, the historical-critical school can roughly be divided into two groups (for details see the researchers' articles): * As far as the research results do not deny the historicity of Muhammad and assume the Quran to have come into being mainly in Muhammad's time, the core essence of the Islamic religion is left untouched. This is the case e.g. for the following representatives of revisionism: Patricia Crone, Michael Cook, Fred Donner, Tom Holland, G√ºnter L√ºling. * As far as the research results do deny the historicity of Muhammad and assume the Quran to have come into being mainly after Muhammad's time, the core essence of the Islamic religion is put into question. This is the case e.g. for the following representatives of revisionism: John Wansbrough, Hans Jansen, Karl-Heinz Ohlig, Yehuda D. Nevo. Besides the discussion of the historicity of Muhammad as a historical person and the Quranic text attributed to him, Islam faces the following debates:Salwa Ismail: The Politics of Historical Revisionism: New Re-Readings of the Early Islamic Period, in: Michaelle Browers, Charles Kurzman (ed).: An Islamic Reformation?, Lexington Books (2004), pp. 101-124; especially p. 114 and footnotes 43, 44. Karl-Heinz Ohlig: Islam und Islamismus, in: imprimatur No. 48, 2015, pp. 48-53 * Traditional texts which had shaped Islam for centuries - yet not from the beginning - are not true. * The Quranic text has not been handed down to our times unchanged. * Even in the Quran, God's word is in many respects clothed in human words. * Muhammad did not live in Mecca. * The relationship between Muhammad and Jews and Christians was different than always thought it had been. Revisionism by non-specialists Ibn Warraq, an author known for his criticism of Islam, has compiled several revisionist essays in his book, The Quest for the Historical Muhammad. Fred Donner, reviewing the book, notes that by favoring Wansbrough's school of revisionism, the author presents a \\"one- sided selection\\" that fails to consider the challenges to this line of revisionism. The result is \\"a book that is likely to mislead many an unwary general reader.\\"Fred Donner: Review of: The Quest for the Historical Muhammad, by Ibn Warraq, Middle East Studies Association Bulletin, 35(1), pp. 75‚Äì76.

The battle took place in the flooded marshes and islands along the Tigris river between the towns of Qurna and Amara and resulted in the British capture of Amara and rout of Ottoman forces in the area.  Background  Following the Ottoman defeat at Shaiba, General John Nixon ordered the 6th Division under General Charles Townshend to advance north from its position at Qurna and capture the city of Amara. Nixon hoped that by doing so, he would force the Ottomans to withdraw their forces from the Karun river to the east and pave the way for an advance on Baghdad.Keogh, E.G. (1955) The River in the Desert p. 52-67. Melbourne, Wilke & Co. The land between Qurna and Amara was largely composed of flooded marshes with several hills protruding from both the eastern and western banks of the river. The Ottoman army had taken up defensive positions on these islands, with gun emplacements on the western side of the river supporting several entrenched infantry positions. Further to the north were also the villages of Abu Aran, Muzaibila, and Ruta, which were garrisoned by Ottoman and Arab troops. To counter this defense, Townshend equipped his troops with bellums (a type of small canoe used by Tigris natives, seating 5-10 men) and divided them into four groups distinguished by colored flags, with the intention of assaulting Ottoman positions on both the west and east sides of the river simultaneously. The amphibious attack would be supported by fire from a small flotilla of sloops, armed launches, and various other light vessels, as well as from 4-inch guns and machine guns mounted on barges and rafts.  The battle  HMS Espiegle, which served as Townshend's headquarters during the first half of the battle. At 1:00 AM on May 31, the 22nd Punjabis began their advance through the marshes on the eastern side of the river, arriving at a position 1500 meters south of the Ottoman emplacements at 4:30. At 5:30 the British gunboats and artillery began a bombardment of the front line, which the Ottomans responded to 20 minutes later with inaccurate fire against Townshend's headquarters aboard the sloop HMS Espiegle. The 17th Brigade group, composed of the Oxford and Buckinghamshire Light Infantry, the 103rd Mahratta Light Infantry, and the 119th Infantry regiments, began to advance along the western side of the river at around 6:00. At the same time, the 22nd Punjabis on the east bank assaulted the Ottoman line, capturing the fortified positions there and using them to support the western advance with machine gun and rifle fire. All of the fortified islands along the Ottoman front had been captured with minimal resistance by 11:30 AM, prompting Townshend to call a halt to the first phase of the attack. The British ships began a bombardment of Abu Aran at 5:30 AM the next day, which was met with no response from the Ottoman artillery. Aerial reconnaissance soon reported that the Ottoman troops stationed in all three of the villages were retreating en masse and Townshend's gunboats quickly advanced in pursuit, reaching the villages by around 3:00 PM. Led by the armed launch Shaitan, the British flotilla caught up with the fleeing Ottoman ships at 6:00 PM and opened fire, stranding the gunboat Marmaris and several small boats and barges loaded with troops and supplies near Ezra's Tomb. The river was too shallow at this point for large vessels to continue any further without difficulty, so Townshend transferred command to the armed tug Comet and continued upriver with three armed launches. The sloop HMS Odin remained behind to take possession of the Marmaris. After a day's travel the British launches, with Shaitan now leading by a significant margin, were within sight of Amara. Shaitan entered Amara on the morning of June 3, sinking a steamer carrying Ottoman troops and passing through the town without drawing any fire. Half a mile north of the town around 300 Ottoman troops emerged from the forested banks of the river and surrendered to Shaitan's nine-man crew, who collected their arms and escorted them back to Amara. The crew held the town until the rest of the launches arrived and Townshend's 41-man force accepted the surrender of Amara's civil governor and military commandant. Around 800 more Ottoman troops were taken prisoner and Townshend remained in Amara until the next day, when a steamer carrying the 2nd Brigade of the Royal Norfolk Regiment arrived to secure his position.  Aftermath  After the capture of Amara, Townshend's flotilla returned to the British headquarters at Basra, with only the Comet and Shaitan remaining behind. General Nixon praised Townshend's efficiency and speed in his report and commended the level of cooperation achieved between the Army and Navy forces during the battle. The crew of the Shaitan were also awarded the Distinguished Service Medal for their role in the town's capture.Moberly, F.J. (1923) The Campaign in Mesopotamia 1914-1918 v. 1, p. 241-266.

Background The gateway to the tomb predates the mausoleum by 16 years, is embellished with kashi kari, or Kashan- style tile work. The mausoleum was built in honour of Dai Anga, the wet nurse of Shah Jahan, and wife of Murad Khan of Bikaner. It is located along the Grand Trunk Road on one of the former routes between Lahore and Delhi. It is also located close to the 17th century tomb of Hazrat Ishaan, and the 18th century Cypress Tomb. History The underside of the tomb's dome still features some Mughal-era frescoes. The fa√ßade of the structure still has some kashi kari tile work. The tomb of Dai Anga features a gateway that predates the tomb's construction. Built in 1655 C.E. by the Persian nobleman Mirza Sultan Baig, the gateway was originally the entrance to a pleasure garden. The original garden was square in shape, and had measured 250 Guz on each side. In 1671 C.E., the pleasure garden was repurposed into a tomb for the wet-nurse of the Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan, and wife to Murad Khan, magistrate of Bikaner under the Emperor Jehangir. A new mausoleum was constructed in the centre of the garden, which over the centuries has been encroached upon by neighbouring structures, with only a narrow strip of garden between the tomb and gateway remaining. Architecture The mausoleum is rectangular in shape with eight rooms encircling the perimeter of a central chamber. The entire mausoleum is on a raised plinth. A dome with frescoes is directly above the central chamber. The chamber itself is empty, as the actual tomb of Dai Anga lies below in a subterranean crypt. She is buried next to her daughter Sultana Begum. Both cenotaphs have been removed, and the subterranean chamber is no longer accessible to the public. The central change is richly decorated with carved inscriptions from the Quran, as well as elegant frescoes made by the renowned calligrapher Muhammad Saleh. The exterior of the tomb was also once covered in rich kashi kari, or Qashani tile-work, though much of the tiles have been lost through the centuries. Conservation The tomb complex is listed on the Protected Heritage Monuments of the Archaeology Department of Punjab. Impact of Metro construction The tomb is situated along the planned route of the Orange Line of the Lahore metro. Heritage campaigners submitted a petition to the Lahore High Court as the planned metro line will pass close to the tomb, Shalimar Gardens, and nine other sites in the city in violation of the Punjab Special Premises Ordinance, 1985 and Antiquity Act, 1975. In August 2016, the Court halted construction of the metro within 200 feet of any heritage site, including the tomb in order to prevent what UNESCO termed as potentially \\"irreversible damage,\\" were the line to be constructed in its present form.\\"Chauburji\\" Wikipedia.

The site is an outcropping of a local stone group, the Whin Sill, on which grows a range of flora representative of the thin, drought-prone soil conditions and influenced by the underlying geology. Location and natural features Brada Hill is a small quarried hill situated west-south-west of the coastal town of Bamburgh in Northumberland and south of Budle Bay. The hill has a pronounced semicircular southern escarpment falling from to above sea level, exposing the Winn Sill's dolerite stone; this is the focus of the SSSI, which extends to and is concerned with the assemblage of flora suited to very well drained thin soil. The surrounding land is pastoral farmland; Spinglestone Heughs and Bradford Kames SSSIs are to the west and the south-west. Vegetation Brada Hill's escarpment has flourishing populations of plants suited to a thin dry soil, including maiden pink (Dianthus deltoides) and wild onion (Allium vineale) amidst red fescue (Festuca rubra), crested hair-grass (Koeleria macrantha) and early hair-grass (Aira praecox). Annual flora at the site include hare‚Äôs-foot clover (Trifolium arvense), knotted trefoil (T. striatum), forget-me-not (Myosotis spp.) and dove‚Äôs-tail cranesbill (Geranium molle) Perennial flora include common rock-rose (Helianthemum nummularium), biting stonecrop (Sedum acre) and meadow oat-grass (Avenula pratensis). A number of coarse grasses including false oat-grass (Arrhenatherum elatius), and herbs including red campion (Silene dioica), hogweed (Heracleum sphondylium) and common nettle (Urtica dioica), grow in isolated areas of deeper soil. Heath pearlwort (Sagina subulata), as well as grasses, wild onion and maiden pink grow amidst slab rocks which form the hill top. Despite proximity with the sea, maritime flora is not found at the site. The condition of Brada Hill was judged to be favourable in 2009.

The wing off the back was completed two years later, and housed research laboratories and related uses, and offices. To the west of the original block is a single-story wing built after the facility became a museum in the 1990s. The building's primary significance is its association with the development of health products that made the expansion of the poultry industry possible whereby large numbers of poultry could be concentrated together for poultry and egg production. with It is also significant for its association Dr. Joseph E.

It was created by a partnership which included The Lake District National Park Authority, the National Trust, Eden District Council, and Ullswater 'Steamers' and was opened on 25 April 2016 by broadcaster and film-maker Eric Robson. The idea of a path circumnavigating the lake had been considered for many years, but the 2015 Cumbria floods which devastated the area gave an incentive for the completion of the project. The path is recognised by the Long Distance Walkers Association. The path's symbol, used for waymarking, has a picture of a daffodil; it was on the shore of Ullswater that William Wordsworth saw the flowers which inspired his well-known poem \\"I Wandered Lonely as a Cloud\\", often known simply as \\"Daffodils\\". Route The route is circular and is described anticlockwise from the northernmost point, Pooley Bridge, although it can be walked in either direction from any point, in full or in part. There are connections with buses or boats at several points so the path can be walked as a series of short sections. From Pooley Bridge the walk passes the Iron Age farmstead of Maiden Castle and Watermillock church, with an optional ascent of Gowbarrow Fell, to reach Aira Force. From here to Glenridding the path is close to the lake shore, passing the spot where Wordsworth saw his inspiring daffodils at Glencoyne Deer Park. The path continues round the south end of the lake and along the more remote eastern shore, passing the hamlet of Sandwick at the foot of Martindale to reach Howtown. Alfred Wainwright described this as \\"the most beautiful and rewarding walk in Lakeland\\". The final section offers a low-level option through farmland along the lake shore, or an ascent to The Cockpit, a stone circle on the northern slope of High Street before reaching Pooley Bridge at the end of the lake. In July 2019 a new walking route, which forms part of the Ullswater Way was launched. The Lowther Castle Loop, is a 7.5 mile circular walk which begins and ends at Lowther Castle and includes points of interest such as the Cop Stone, Askham Hall and the village of Helton  Poetry Stones  In June 2017 three Poetry Stones were unveiled along the route. The stones have been inscribed with lines from the poems of Kathleen Raine, who once lived in Martindale. The stones were carved by Cumbrian artist Pip Hall.

Established in 1925, it is the oldest regional business association in the United States. History A group of New England business leaders along with the states' six governors convened in Poland Spring, Maine in June 1925 to tackle issues related to economic growth in the region. This led to the first annual \\"New England Conference\\" later that year in Worcester, Massachusetts. According to the Council's own historical record, around \\"800 representatives of agricultural, industrial, and commercial organizations throughout New England\\" gathered during this conference to discuss \\"challenges facing the New England economy\\"; it was then that they decided to make the conference an annual event, and to establish the New England Council as the conference's executive body. The New England Council's success demonstrated that regional approaches to economic issues could prove useful. In 1962, the New England Council helped spearhead efforts to relax quotas on petroleum imports in the United States. A forum on the heroin and opioid epidemic in New England was hosted by the NEC in November 2015. The forum included several US senators as well as the governors of New Hampshire and Massachusetts. In June 2016, Massachusetts governor Charlie Baker indicated at a New England Council breakfast that the New England states would begin sharing information about prescription drug usage and monitoring. New Hampshire senator Jeanne Shaheen addressed the New England Council in Bedford, New Hampshire in July 2016, arguing against isolationism in US politics and emphasizing the need to address the heroin and opioid epidemic facing the country, with New England in particular. Mission The NEC claims that its mission is \\"to identify and support federal public policies and articulate the voice of its membership regionally and nationally on important issues facing New England.\\" In effect, it acts as a lobby in Washington, D.C., advocating for the region's economic interests, ranging from private enterprise to academia to public policies and projects.

He set up the J.V.B. and Battle record labels, was one of the first independent black record producers, the first to record Rev. C. L. Franklin and his daughter Aretha Franklin, and influential in the career of John Lee Hooker and other blues musicians. Life and career Battle was born in Macon, Georgia, and trained as a licensed minister of the African Methodist Episcopal Church. He took the name \\"Von\\" - which he used as a middle name rather than as part of his surname - from a childhood liking for the films of Erich Von Stroheim; later, he retained it as he felt it gave his name elegance, and encouraged businesses with whom he dealt to think that he was of European rather than African-American descent. He married and had four children before moving to Detroit in the 1930s; he later remarried and had four more children. After being placed for several months in quarantine for suspected tuberculosis, he lost faith in the church while retaining a love of gospel music, and turned to paid employment. He held various jobs in utilities and in the automotive industry, and moved with his family into the Brewster Project near Hastings Street in Detroit. Marsha Music, \\"Joe Von Battle ‚Äì Requiem for a Record Shop Man\\". Retrieved 21 August 2016 In 1945, he took up an offer to run a general store at 3530 Hastings Street, and began selling records there from his own collection. As it expanded, the store became Joe's Records, and by the late 1940s he had an inventory of 35,000 records. Battle acquired recording equipment which he set up at the back of the store with a piano, and could also take around local churches. One of his earliest recordings was ‚ÄúHastings Street Opera‚Äù, recorded by \\"Detroit Count\\" (Bob White, c.1920-1970). J.C. Marion, \\"JVB Records\\", JammUp .

Paul 'Hucklebuck' Williams, HoyHoy.com . Retrieved 21 August 2016 Battle set up his own record label, J.V.B. Records, in 1948. He recorded the preaching and singing of Rev. C. L. Franklin and his congregations at the nearby New Bethel Baptist Church. In all, he recorded and released some 75 records by Franklin, and in 1957 was the first to record Franklin's fourteen-year-old daughter, Aretha, on the gospel song \\"Never Grow Old\\". He also set up other record labels, including Battle and Von, and recorded many of the blues musicians who frequented Hastings Street, including John Lee Hooker, Baby Boy Warren, Louisiana Red, Washboard Willie, Little Sonny, Eddie Burns, Joe Weaver, Memphis Slim, and Little Willie John; gospel singers including Brother Will Hairston; and jazz guitarist Kenny Burrell.

Regular customers at the store included Berry Gordy, Wilson Pickett, Jackie Wilson, and many of the musicians who later worked for Motown, although Battle himself disliked the commercialized music that they subsequently produced. In 1960, Hastings Street and its properties were demolished to make way for the Chrysler Freeway, and Battle relocated his store to 12th Street on the West Side of Detroit, where he continued to record and produce blues and gospel musicians through to about 1966, by which time his recordings were released through Riverside Records.

The town is named for the shrub which grows in the area [Philadelphus lewisii], and is the Idaho State Flower. It is in the Pacific Time Zone, (-8 UTC). The climate is mild with an average precipitation of over 25 inches per year.  Geology  The town lies at the base of the Clearwater Mountains, a subset of the Rocky Mountains, along the banks of the Middle Fork of the Clearwater River (MFCR). The area is on the edge of the Idaho Batholith, though Columbia River Basalt Flows are mere miles to the west. Three creeks run into the MFCR within a mile of each other near Syringa. The creeks are Little Smith Creek, Smith Creek, and Syringa Creek. The close proximity of the creek mouths form a large alluvial plain surround by sylvan forests.  History  The area is within the home territory of the Nez Perce people or Nimi‚Äôipuu (Nee-me-poo), but eleven miles east of the current reservation boundary. The Lewis and Clark Corps of Discovery National Historical Trail, also known as the Northern Nez Perce Trail, is ten air miles directly north. In 1877, during the Nez Perce War, the Nez Perce crossed the trail followed by General Oliver Otis Howard fleeing the reservation. Settlers moved into the area by the 1880s and Homesteads were established in the early 1900s. Lumber mills were once the main industry, now replaced by recreation and governmental land management. The Middle Fork Ranger station (No. One) sat 1 mile to the west until 1939. The Great Fire of 1910, also known as the Great Burn effected the area as did the Pete King Fire of 1934. The Woodrat Fire threatened the town in 2015.  Geography and Political Boundaries  It is at Latitude 46.1507362 N and Longitude 115.7270822 W. The elevation is 1411 to 1430 feet. The Northwest Passage Scenic Byway U.S. Route 12, one of three main east to west routes across Idaho, is the main access to Syringa. The town is within the Middle Fork Wild and Scenic River Corridor managed by the United States Forest Service. The Nez Perce - Clearwater National Forest surrounds Syringa. The Selway Bitterroot Wilderness Area is to the east. Syringa is in Mountain View School District #244 and students are bused to Kooskia, Idaho. The area code is 208, but Idaho will be adding the 986 area code in 2017.  Climate  The climate is similar to that of Kooskia, Idaho fifteen miles to the west, but with a shorter growing season (by a few days) little more moisture. The valley's low elevation and ridge alignment give Syringa a mild, moist climate. This has resulted in flora of White and Red Fir, Western Red Cedar, and Ponderosa Pine. Cottonwood trees grow near the creeks. Ferns and underbrush can become thick, especially on the northern slope faces.  References  * 1.

From the 19th century onwards it was known as the Republic of the Escartons (Italian: Repubblica degli Escartons; French: R√©publique des √âcartons), although the concept of a republic is anachronistic in the period covered by the principality. Escartons corresponds to the Occitan name for Brian√ßon and in French '√©carter' means 'to divide', specifically 'to divide taxes into quarters'. It consisted of a set of mountain territories in what is now the French department of Hautes-Alpes, the province of Turin and province of Cuneo. It enjoyed fiscal and political privileges from the French and although not very large, it had more than forty thousand inhabitants. Every year the leaders of various countries forming the Republic met in council to elect a consul as its leader. Guigues VII of Viennois conceded the inhabitants of Brian√ßon a charter of liberty in 1244, which was confirmed as a grand charter on 29 May 1343 by his successor Humbert II of Viennois at Beauvoir-en-Royans - he signed it with 18 representatives of the Alpine valleys.

It was committed on 9 and 10 November 1924 by a mob of 2,000 Orthodox Christian men from Kola≈°in and Bijelo Polje that sought revenge for the earlier murder of Bo≈°ko Bo≈°koviƒá, governor of the area. The massacre was fueled by rumors which targetted local Muslim, anti-Yugoslav leader Jusuf Mehonjiƒá as the perpetrator. In time, it became known that Bo≈°koviƒá was killed by members of a rival clan, the Rovƒçani. In the aftermath of the massacre many Muslims fled from the region. Background Bo≈°ko Bo≈°koviƒá, chief of Kola≈°in county The motive for the massacre was the murder of Bo≈°ko Bo≈°koviƒá, the chief of the Kola≈°in county. Bo≈°koviƒá was murdered in an ambush by unknown assailants on 7 November 1924, while he travelled from Mojkovac to ≈†ahoviƒái. In this period, in much of Lower Kola≈°in a group of anti-Yugoslav rebels were active. Their leader was Jusuf Mehonjiƒá from ≈†ahoviƒái. The local Montenegrin authorities singled out Jusuf Mejonjiƒá and the population of ≈†ahoviƒái as having being active in Bo≈°koviƒá's murder and issued an order was issued on the same day to confiscate all weapons in possession of the population of ≈†ahoviƒái and Pavino Polje. Bo≈°koviƒá was buried on 9 November 1924. In the speeches held during his funeral, the Orthodox population of ≈†ahoviƒái accused the Muslim population of ≈†ahoviƒái for his death. Adil Zulfikarpa≈°iƒá emphasizes that ≈†ahoviƒái and Pavino Polje had been disarmed two days before the massacre. Local authorities arrested 31 men from ≈†ahoviƒái on 7 November 1924. After the events of the massacre, it emerged that the murderers of Bo≈°koviƒá were clan members from Rovca, a rival tribe to his own. Massacre Jusuf Mehonjiƒá, local rebel Zulfikarpa≈°iƒá concluded that the massacre was committed by armed men from Kola≈°in and Bijelo Polje who coordinated their attack on ≈†ahoviƒái and Pavino Polje on the 19 km wide frontline. There are different estimates of the number of victims. Some sources estimate 600, while some sources up to 900, all of them emphasizing that many women and children were among victims. Some sources estimate the number of victims to be 3,000. According to the official report, the massacre was committed by villagers from Polja village in Kola≈°in, members of the brotherhood of the murdered Bo≈°koviƒá, who killed 120 Muslims and burned and robbed 45 houses. The massacre was described by Milovan ƒêilas in the book Land without Justice, based on the testimony of his father Nikola, who participated in the massacre.  Aftermath  Muslim notables and leaders from ≈†ahoviƒái who survived the massacre wrote a memorandum to Yugoslav king. In the absence of appropriate reaction from Yugoslav government, all Muslims from ≈†ahoviƒái emigrated from their village, most of them to Bosnia and Herzegovina.

She had previously served as the Chief of Social Policy and Economic Analysis, Planning Monitoring and Evaluation for UNICEF Zambia from 2007 until 2012. In 2016, Scott contested the Lusaka Central seat in the National Assembly during the general election. Early life and education Scott, the second of three daughters, was born Charlotte Harland to Robin and Janet Harland in Blackheath, London, on 13 November 1963. She was raised in nearby Greenwich in southeast London. Her parents had met as students at Oxford University. She is a member of the Church of England. Scott completed her elementary and secondary schooling in London. She received her Bachelor's of Arts in psychology and development studies from the University of Oxford in 1986. She then obtained a Masters of Arts in rural development in 1987. Scott later completed her PhD from the University of Bath in 2007. Personal life In 1989, Scott was hired by a British international humanitarian organisation who asked her to work in Zambia. She arrived in Zambia in July 1989 at the age of 26 and was placed in the northeast town of Mpika, Muchinga Province, by her employer. By 1991, she was living in the village of Chitulika, the home of future President Michael Sata's father. Scott met her future husband, Guy Scott, during the run-up to the 1991 Zambian general election. He was working on Michael Sata's election campaign for the Mpika constituency seat at the time of their meeting. She and Sata were mutual acquaintances at that time since Mpika was his hometown and her development project was overseen by the government Ministry of State, which was headed by Sata. Charlotte and Guy Scott married in 1994 at a wedding held at the Lusaka Civic Centre with the reception at their home in State Lodge. Career Professionally, Scott has worked in the fields of economic development policy, social development policy and NGOs for more than twenty years. She headed the team which created and launched the Zambian Public Welfare Assistance Scheme, a social protection and poverty alleviation government program. It was an early forerunner of the present-day conditional cash transfers (also called social cash transfers), which makes welfare programs conditional based upon the receivers' actions. In 2014, two years after Scott left the program, her Zambian cash transfer program was named UNICEF's best global research program. Scott served as the Chief of Social Policy and Economic Analysis, Planning, Monitoring & Evaluation for UNICEF's Zambian branch for five years from 2007 until 2012. She worked in nearly every district in Zambia in that position. She stepped down for her position at UNICEF in 2011 when her husband was appointed Vice-President of Zambia by President Sata. United Nations regulations required that employees whose spouses attain high political office either step down from their job or taking another position with the United Nations in another country. She chose to leave her post. By 2013, Scott had been appointed a Visiting Fellow of the Institute of Development Studies (IDS) at the University of Sussex. She has publicly spoken out on a variety of societal issues affecting Zambia, including children's right, gender discrimination, violence against women, and women's access to education. Sata died in office on 28 October 2014. Vice- President Guy Scott succeeded Sata as the acting President of Zambia until a by-election could be held 90 days after Sata's death. The events made Charlotte Scott the First Lady of Zambia during this time. The couple became the country's first white President and First Lady. Despite their new positions, the Scotts did not move into Government House, the residence of the country's president. Guy Scott was barred by law from running for the remainder of Sata's unexpired presidential term because the Constitution of Zambia banned presidential candidates whose parents were not born in Zambia. His parents had immigrated to present-day Zambia from England and Scotland in the United Kingdom. Charlotte Scott left the position of First Lady on 26 January 2015 and was succeeded by Esther Lungu. In 2016, Guy Scott decided would not seek re-election to his Lusaka Central seat in Parliament in the August general election. Charlotte Scott applied to run for her husband's seat and was endorsed by the United Party for National Development (UPND) as the party's official nominee. Scott and her main opponent, the PF's Margaret Mwanakatwe, were considered the front-runners for Lusaka Central during the election out of the five candidates for the seat. On 18 July 2016, Scott and her supporters were attacked while campaigning in the Town Centre Market in Lusaka. The attackers, who used stones and screwdrivers to chase Scott and her staff from the market, were supporters of the rival party, the Patriotic Front (PF), according to news reports. Scott and her staff escaped unharmed, but their Toyota Land Cruiser suffered major damage during the attack. She told a newspaper, \\"Our team did not retaliate. Why can't we campaign in peace? This is completely unacceptable!\\" The PF candidate, Margaret Mwanakatwe, defeated Scott in the general election on 11 August 2016. In line with the provisions of the constitution, Charlotte Scott petitioned the validity of the election. On 24 November 2016, the High Court of Zambia nullified the election of Mwanakatwe, on grounds of violence, corruption, mis-use of Government resources, discrimination / racism, and the actions of the Zambia Police in preventing Dr Scott from campaigning freely.Judge M Siavwapa.

It is bounded on the northwest by VA 621, on the northeast by VA 620, on the southeast by FS Road 11060, and a powerline on the south.National Geographic Store: 787 Blacksburg/New River Valley - National Geographic Store , accessdate: July 15, 2017 The Appalachian Trail travels for 7.5 miles through the wilderness from the northern trailhead on VA 620 to the southern trailhead on VA 621. Many old access and logging roads, offering additional access to the area, have become overgrown, but others are kept open by hikers and hunters. An older part of the Appalachian Trail, now abandoned, stretches a few miles along the midslope of Brush Mountain.Virginia Wilderness Committee: Brush Mountain East Wilderness - Virginia Wilderness Committee, accessdate: July 15, 2017 Natural history The wilderness contains colluvial drainages, toeslopesDefined Term: Toeslope definitions - Defined Term, accessdate: July 15, 2017 and alluvial floodplains providing a rich environment that supports yellow poplar, northern red oak, white oak, basswood, cucumber tree, white ash, eastern hemlock, white pine and red maple. In the remaining land, white oak, northern red oak, and hickory are found to the north and west while chestnut oak, scarlet oak and yellow pine are found on ridgetops and slopes to the east and south. The area is one of the few sites in Virginia with table mountain pine and box huckleberry, species requiring fire to reproduce, and therefore becoming uncommon because of fire exclusion. The 20-acre Brush Mountain Special Biological Area is located on the crest of the mountain. The wilderness also contains the Central Appalachian Shale Barrens which support rare plant species such as the Virginia white-haired leatherflower and other unique rare species of plants and butterflies.Central Appalachian Shale Barrens: Central Appalachian Shale Barrens, accessdate: July 15, 2017 The forest type found in the wilderness is a habitat for songbirds such as cerulean warblers, Swainson‚Äôs warblers, black-throated green warblers, and winter wrens.

Wide valleys between the ridges are composed of limestone and shale. The drainage density is high with many tributaries feeding into Craig Creek on the north and Trout Creek on the east and south. Craig Creek, part of the James River watershed, was once part of the New River watershed before being captured by the James River. Elevations range from 1520 feet along Craig Creek to 3070 feet at the crest of Brush Mountain.

The four sultanates of Ternate, Tidore, Jailolo and Bacan were considered descendants of a legendary figure called Jafar Sadik and formed a ritual quadripartition. Drawing wealth from the spice production and trade with other parts of Asia, Ternate and Tidore lorded over extensive realms which stretched from Sulawesi to Papua, while Jailolo and Bacan merely had local significance. They fell under Portuguese or Spanish influence in the sixteenth century, superseded by Dutch impact in the seventeenth century. The sultanates were subordinated to the Dutch colonial state until 1942 when the Japanese occupied Indonesia. After the outbreak of the Indonesian revolution they belonged to the Dutch-approved quasi-state East Indonesia from 1946 to 1950 when they were incorporated in the unitary Indonesian state.

Established around 1929, it was one of four black-owned nightclubs in the black entertainment district on Kentucky Avenue. Between the Wonder Gardens, Club Harlem, the Paradise Club, and Grace's Little Belmont, the music played all night and into the morning in the district's heyday in the 1940s through 1960s. Presenting both popular jazz musicians and new talent, the Wonder Gardens provided early exposure for Dan Fogel, Harvey Mason, George Benson, and the Commodores. Over the years, the music changed from jazz to rock, soul, and pop music. In 1979 the club was renovated, redecorated and renamed the Latin Wonder Gardens, featuring live Afro-Cuban musical entertainment. In 1991 it underwent a second renovation and name change to the New Wonder Gardens, featuring Latin, jazz, R&B;, hiphop, and reggae acts. The club was sold in 2001 and was later demolished. History Originally called Wonder Bar, the jazz nightspot opened around 1929 at 1601 Arctic Avenue, on the southwest corner of Kentucky Avenue and Arctic Avenue. In the 1940s and 1950s it was owned by Charles Randall. At one point B.B. King, a frequent performer at Club Harlem, became a part-owner of the Wonder Gardens and began appearing here exclusively two weekends a year. In July 1940 the Wonder Bar, Club Harlem, the Paradise Club, and Grace's Little Belmont were raided by police, led by the newly elected mayor, Tom Taggart, seeking proof of illegal gambling activities. The police confiscated \\"three truckloads of gambling paraphernalia\\" and arrested 32, then shut down the four clubs. The arrestees from the Wonder Bar included Randall, John Doyle, and Albert Leighton, who all pleaded not guilty and were released on bail. The next day the clubs were open for business as usual. The raid followed a period of unease between the new mayor and black citizens of Atlantic City's north side; earlier, Taggart had filed a restraining order against a white dancer, who bathed in milk during her performance, from appearing at Randall's black club. In 1979 the Wonder Gardens was renovated and redecorated as a Latin disco, with a new sound system, and renamed the Latin Wonder Gardens. Featuring Afro-Cuban musical entertainment, the club announced that Joe Cuba would be the house band; opening acts included T√≠pica 73, Vit√≠n Avil√©s, and Mayro & Silvio's Cuban Rumba Dancers. In 1991 the club underwent a second renovation and name change to the New Wonder Gardens, now offering Latin, jazz, R&B;, hiphop, and reggae music. The 2000 edition of Lonely Planet New York City listed the Wonder Gardens as a jazz club in its Atlantic City excursions section. Dancer LeRoy Myers purchased the club in the 1970s and sold it in 2001. Performers Throughout its history, the Wonder Gardens presented both popular musicians and new talent. In the late 1950s Dan Fogel began hanging around the Kentucky Avenue clubs regularly at the age of 10, shining shoes and listening in on top jazz organists like Groove Holmes, Larry Young, Jimmy Smith, and Jimmy McGriff playing the Hammond B3 organ at the Wonder Gardens and Club Harlem. With his shoeshine earnings, Fogel bought a Hammond organ at age 11 and at age 13 debuted at the Wonder Gardens. At age 16 Fogel was leading the Wonder Gardens house band, which included his Atlantic City High School classmate Harvey Mason on drums. Mason recalled that the band regularly played the \\"breakfast show\\" at the Wonder Gardens from 4 AM to 10 AM in the 1960s. In the 1960s, the Wonder Gardens booked jazz organists Brother Jack McDuff and Gene Ludwig, drummers Art Blakey and J. C. Heard, the John Banks Trio, Damita Jo, Kenny Barron and Dizzy Gillespie, tenor saxophonist Bootsie Barnes, R&B;/soul group The Delfonics, and singers Marvin Gaye, Russell Thompkins Jr., and Florence Ballard, formerly of The Supremes. In the mid-1960s, a young George Benson, then known as \\"Little Georgie\\", played guitar in McDuff's trio at the Wonder Gardens. After his set ended at 3 AM Benson would walk over to Grace's Little Belmont to talk music with future jazz composer Charles Earland. In the 1970s the club began presenting rock, soul, and pop musicians. Performers included Stevie Wonder, James Brown, Aretha Franklin, Kool and the Gang, and Blue Magic. The aspiring Commodores played as the house band one summer. Joseph Smith, a black Baltimore high school student, was also given some time on stage with his magic and ventriloquist act. In the early 1990s, the club featured jazz keyboardist Lonnie Liston Smith and drummer Ralph Peterson, Jr. on its weekly jazz night from 5 PM to 2 AM. The club also gave the stage to up-and-coming singer Sybil and Boyz II Men, while aspiring DJ Ahmed Kahn spun R&B; and rap music.

After study, it was discovered that this term is directed toward people suffering from varying types of schizophrenia. A similar term, ukuthwasa, is used to refer to positive types of claimed possession, though this event also involves those suffering from schizophrenia. It has also found cultural usage among some groups of Zulu peoples. The direct translation of the term amafufunyana is nerves and is a part of a much more complex cultural ideology connecting varying types of psychosis with religious, social, and recently psychiatric beliefs and activities. In a 1998 interview with Xhosa people suffering from schizophrenia by Lund et al., it was determined that through interaction with scientists and psychological services, the preferred treatment for the cultural condition had shifted from relation to traditional healers to active psychiatric assessment. Claimed symptoms and causes People who claim to be suffering from amafufunyana state that their symptoms include hearing \\"voices from their stomachs\\", speaking in another language or in a disturbing tone, and general agitation and possible violence. There is also the possibility of suicide being attempted. One of the cultural beliefs for the cause is bewitchment from drinking a magic potion brewed from ants that have been feeding upon a buried dead body. General possession by malignant spirits is also believed. Among the Zulu specifically, there is also the belief that a \\"horde of spirits\\" from multiple ethnic groups come together to take over a person's body. The common cultural treatment for the claimed ailment is for one of the traditional healers, often ukuthwasa themselves, to perform a ritual of exorcism. Diagnosis History Recorded incidents of amafufunyana appear to have begun in the early 20th century and researchers such as Ngubane et al have suggested that its cultural formation may have had something to do with colonialism and migration of indigenous peoples away from their homes. There have also been widespread outbreaks of the condition, similar to events involving contagious spread of hysteria, recorded in the 1980s at a rural girls' boarding school. The most common types of people that are identified as afflicted by the cultural group are those of the lowest economic and social level and more often during times of cultural hardship and change, such as during migrations. More women than men are also identified.

This concept is considered one of the so-called social cognitive biases or collective cognitive biases. The Milgram experiment in 1961 was the classic experiment that established its existence. Humans generally have a deep-seated duty to authority, and tend to comply when requested by an authority figure. There are scholars who explain that individuals are motivated to view authority as deserving of their position and this legitimacy lead people to accept and obey the decisions that it makes. System justification theory articulates this phenomenon, particularly within its position that there is a psychological motivation for believing in the steadiness, stability and justness of the current social system. In any society, a diverse and widely accepted system of authority allows the development of sophisticated structures for the production of resources, trade, expansion and social control. Since the opposite is anarchy, we are all trained from birth to believe that obedience to authority is right. Notions of submission and loyalty to legitimate rule of others are accorded values in schools, the law, the military and in political systems. The strength of the bias to obey a legitimate authority figure comes from systemic socialization practices designed to instill in people the perception that such obedience constitutes correct behavior. Different societies vary the terms of this dimension. As we grow up, we learn that it benefits us to obey the dictates of genuine authority figures because such individuals usually possess higher degrees of knowledge, wisdom and power. We tend to do what our doctor advises. Consequently, deference to authority can occur in a mindless fashion as a kind of decision-making short cut. The authority bias is demonstrated in the case of the highest paid persons' opinion (HIPPO) impact, which describes how employees and other stakeholders in the solution environment tend to go with the opinions and impressions of the highly paid people in an organization.

Gesner v Cairns (1852) Gesner maintained that Cairns trespassed the property leased by the former, felled trees on it, spoliated it and expropriated 1,000 tons of valuable material. Gesner maintained the material to be asphaltum, while Cairns was a coal miner. The defendant was evidently permitted to mine coal, not asphaltum. The evidence presented to the jury was of a technical nature and regarded the nature of the material. The defendant won the day. Maher v Town Council of Portland (1874) Maher v Town Council of Portland tested the constitutional guarantees for denominational schools set out in section 93 of the British North America Act of 1867. The issue was whether the Common Schools Act of 1871 infringed the guarantee of denominational schools set out in section 93(1). Dow v Black (1875) Dow v Black was one of the first major cases examining in detail the division of powers between the federal Parliament and the provincial Legislatures, set out in s. 91 and s. 92 of the British North America Act. The Caraquet Riots (1876) The Caraquet Riots of 1875 stemmed from the Common Schools Act of 1871. The francophone Catholic clergy was hostile to the Act, which forbade religious instruction in New Brunswick schools. The local priest in Caraquet, Joseph Pelletier, and local representative to the Legislative Assembly, 31-year-old Th√©otime Blanchard, were responsible for the Catholic protest strategem to withhold tax monies and to disregard local elections to the school board. In the British North American system of government, education and the school boards were purely a local concern, with the province supplementing locally determined budgets. Certain Protestants in Caraquet held to the system as directed by the Crown and went ahead with the scheme of the Act. The Catholic strategem of electoral noncompliance, which was perceived as dereliction, was singularly unsuccessful and led directly to the riots, and subsequent violent death in the same incident of one Catholic protester and one police constable. In the aftermath, the riot was adjudicated as R v Mailloux et al., while the murder of the constable was reported as R v Chiasson. The convictions were appealed to the New Brunswick Court of Appeal in early 1876. The verdicts were upheld in the matter of the riot, but later vacated due to the lapse of time between incident and conviction. The conviction of Chiasson was vacated on a number of grounds. Russell v R (1882) Russell v R is a landmark Privy Council decision regarding the interpretation of the British North America Act 1867, and was one of the first cases explaining the nature of the peace, order and good government power in Canadian federalism. Specifically, it dealt with the powers of Parliament to delegate authority, in this case under the Canada Temperance Act, to, in this instance, municipal councils. R v Robertson (1882) The federal government attempted to sell a fishery lease on the Miramichi River. At issue was the locus of jurisdiction. Section 91(12) of the Constitution Act, 1867, assigns to the federal Parliament at Ottawa exclusive legislative authority over Sea Coast and Inland Fisheries. Although it was initially believed that the federal government had exclusive jurisdiction over all fisheries throughout Canada, it was found here that section 91(12) did not have the effect of transferring ownership of the beds of freshwater rivers and lakes to the federal government. The fisheries authority vested in Parliament ends where provincial authority over property and civil rights begins, unless an encroachment is essential to the effectiveness of federal legislation. Under ancient British fisheries law, rights to fish in tidal waters were of a fundamentally different legal character from rights to fish in inland or non- tidal waters. The former were public rights vested in the Crown as parens patriae for the use of the public and could have no new private owner after Magna Charta. The latter, which were the subject of property, required an owner and could not be vested in the public generally. In determining the respective jurisdictions of Parliament and the provinces, the court seized on the distinction between fishing as a public right and fishing as a proprietary right. In the Provincial Fisheries Reference,[1898] A.C. 700 (P.C.) the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council distinguished between rights of property and legislative jurisdiction, holding that section 91 conferred the latter on the federal Parliament and that only the provinces were competent to deal with the private right of fisheries in inland waters under section 92(5), Management and Sale of Public Lands, or under section 92(13), Property and Civil Rights. Since such \\"legislation deals directly with property, its disposal, and the rights to be enjoyed in respect of it\\", it does not fall under section 91(12). As a result, the Province was entitled to allocate the resource; that is, to decide who may fish, how much may be harvested per person, and where the harvesting may occur. It could do this through the issuing of licences, through its own legislation and through property transactions. The federal government retained the right in inland waters to preserve, protect and manage the fisheries. This included the right to set the maximum amount of fish to be harvested, and to impose gear restrictions and limitations on locations. The federal government also retained the right to legislate with respect to the protection of fish habitat and waters frequented by fish. Despite the federal Parliament's inability to legislate respecting property and civil rights, the Privy Council in the Provincial Fisheries Reference made it clear that if federal legislation is truly legislation respecting fisheries it may powerfully affect proprietary rights.dfo- mpo.gc.ca: \\"A Practical Guide to the Fisheries Act and to the Coastal Fisheries Protection Act\\"canlii.org: \\"The Queen v. Robertson, 6 SCR 52, 1882 CanLII 25 (SCC)\\" The result of this case was profound. The 25th New Brunswick Legislature passed The Fisheries ActAn Act to regulate the Leasing of the Fishery Rights in the non-tidal waters pertaining to the Crown as Riparian Proprietor of ungranted Crown Lands, and for the Protection of the Fisheries, Acts 1884 c.1 and An Act to provide for the Survey, Reservation and Protection of Lumber Lands.Acts 1884 c.7 The latter Act created the idea of a private fishing reserve, let from the provincial Crown, and protected by game wardens who had the power to commence the process of gaoling offenders. Maritime Bank Liquidators v New Brunswick (1889) This case decided that the (Provincial) Crown was entitled to superior status in monies on demand deposit with respect to other creditors in the liquidation of a bank.

He was convicted under the Canada Temperance Act of an offence of warehousing and keeping for delivery a quantity of intoxicating liquor brought into the railway station by the Intercolonial Railway, while acting as a servant of the railway, a public work owned and operated by the Crown in right of Canada. It was held that the Crown, not being expressly mentioned in the Canada Temperance Act, was not bound thereby and therefore its station agent, acting in the course of his duty, could not be convicted of the offence. Inglewood v NB Power (1928) Inglewood v NB Power, in which the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council affirmed the judgment of the NB Supreme Court, dealt with the interest payable on expropriation, and whether or not the loss of game to hunt were actionable.bailii.org: \\"The Inglewood Pulp and paper Company Limited (Appeal Nos. 147 and 148 of 1927) v The New Brunswick Electric Power Commission (New Brunswick) 1928 UKPC 72 (20 July 1928)\\" King v Assessors of Bathurst County (1928) The issue of whether or not school taxes levied by a county were payable by an employer of significant size was the subject of King v Assessors of Bathurst County, ex parte Bathurst Company Ltd.

The court answered in the affirmative but several months later the corporation began velvet blackmail and the government caved and brought in new legislation.

The conviction of the Crown's servant, acting in the course of his employment which was the construction of a public work, was set aside. The servant was held excluded from the provisions of the Explosives Act as was his employer, the Crown. Pitre v R (1932) This 1932 Supreme Court of Canada decision confirmed the re-trial of Pitre, who was tried for murder, because of the error of the trial judge, upon the latter's misdirection of the jury. The trial judge charged the jury in such a way as to give the impression that they should not convict on the uncorroborated evidence of an accomplice and, unless they found corroborative evidence, their duty was to acquit; that this was a misdirection in law; and, under the circumstances, probably had a material effect upon the jury's minds. The jury should be told that it is within their legal province to convict, but should be warned that it is dangerous to convict, and may be advised not to convict, on the uncorroborated evidence of an accomplice.

Atlantic Smoke Shops v Conlon (1943) The Tobacco Tax Act, 1940 (N.B.), c. 44, provides, inter alia, that \\"every consumer of tobacco purchased at a retail sale in the province shall pay to\\" the province \\"for the raising of a revenue, at the time of making his purchase, a tax in respect of the consumption of such tobacco\\" (section 4); and the Act also provides that \\"every person residing or ordinarily resident or carrying on business in\\" the province \\"who brings into the province or who receives delivery in the province of tobacco for his own consumption or for the consumption of other persons at his expense or on behalf of or as agent for a principal who desires to acquire such tobacco for consumption by such principal or other persons at his expense  shall pay the same tax in respect of the consumption of such tobacco\\" (section 5). Section 10 provides that \\"a consumer shall be and remain liable for the tax imposed by the Act until the same has been collected.\\" Under section 2 (a) \\"consumer\\" means not only any person who within the Province purchases tobacco for his own consumption, but also any other person who purchases tobacco in the Province as agent for his principal who desires to acquire such tobacco for consumption by such principal. It was also enacted (section 3 (2)) that only retail vendors licensed under the Act may sell tobacco at a retail sale in the province. Regulations made under the Act by Orders in Council were declared to have the force of statute (section 20 (2)). Regulation 6 provides that \\"every application for a (retail) vendor's license  shall contain an undertaking by the applicant to collect and remit the tax  and shall be in Form 2\\"; and when signing that Form, the applicant undertakes \\"to act as the agent of the Minister for the collection of the tax  and to account to the province  for all moneys so collected.\\" Appeal was made to the Supreme Court of Canada, where the majority held that the Act was within the constitutional powers of the province, except as to the provisions making the agent, who buys tobacco for his principal personally liable for the tax, which provisions were deemed to be severable.Supreme Court Judgments - \\"Atlantic Smoke Shops Ltd. v. Conlon and Attorney-General for Quebec\\" (1941) SCR 670 Appeal was then made to the JCPC, which advised His Majesty on 30 July 1943 that the appeal fails and that the Tobacco Tax Act, 1940, is in all respects a valid exercise of the powers of the legislature of the province of New Brunswick.

NB Electric Power Commission v Tobique Salmon Club (1966) The NBEPC was deemed liable for injurious affection of the salmon fishing rights of the Club by reason of the NBEPC having, in 1953, constructed a dam across the non-tidal Tobique River near the point at which it flows into the Saint John River and, in 1957, a dam across the Saint John River at Beechwood, fourteen miles downstream from the Tobique Dam at a point also above tide water. No compulsory power of the NBEPC was exercised in respect of any land or fishing rights owned by the Club. No entry was made by the NBEPC into or upon any lands in which the Club owned an interest. The statutory liability created by the Act was clear to the Court, and hence there was liability on the part of the NBEPC to pay compensation to the Club.canlii.org: \\"New Brunswick Electric Power Commission v Tobique Salmon Club Limited, 1966 CanLII 109 (NB CA)\\", 1966-04-12 Bathurst Paper Limited v.

Respondent alleged that it was entitled to a \\"tax concession\\" in relation to these properties under s. 18 of the Assessment Act, 1965-66 (N.B.), c. 110, by virtue of being a subsidiary of Irving Oil Refining Limited and entitled to the concession conferred by the Irving Refining Limited Act, 1958 (N.B.), c. 72, but the trial judge and the Appeal Division were both satisfied that under s. 18(2) of the Assessment Act the concession only applied to companies in existence before November 19, 1965, and that the respondent, incorporated on July 2, 1968, was not entitled to it. There were further concurrent findings in both Courts that the ten tanks were structures providing shelter for moveable property (i.e. that they constituted \\"buildings\\" and fell to be assessed as \\"real property\\" within the meaning of s. 1(g)(ii) of the Assessment Act) but that they came within the exclusion in s. 1(g)(v).

Thorne's Hardware v R (1977) This case pitted the plaintiffs, Thorne's Hardware Limited, Kent Lines Limited, Canaport Limited and Irving Oil Limited, against the National Harbours Board, over the extension of harbour limits. Appellants challenged in the Federal Court (1) the validity of an order in council extending the limits of the port of Saint John so as to include appellants' berth and harbour facilities and (2) the applicability to them of a National Harbours Board's By-law imposing harbour dues on all vessels entering or using the port. The Trial Division held the Order in Council intra vires the powers of the Governor in Council but the By-law to be inapplicable to the appellants. The Court of Appeal disagreed with the trial judge on the second point. Hence this appeal to determine whether the appellants are obliged to pay harbour dues. The appellants alleged that the Order in Council extending the limits of Saint John Harbour had been passed for improper motives to increase harbour revenues.

Therefore, the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms do not apply to members of Nova Scotia House of Assembly when they exercise their inherent privileges of refusing strangers from entering the House. This was decided via New Brunswick Broadcasting Co v Nova Scotia (Speaker of the House of Assembly). Charlebois v Mowat (2001) Charlebois impugned a by-law of the City of Moncton, represented by the defendant Mowat because it had not been translated into French, as considered by Charlebois it must. He relied on subsections 16(2) and 18(2) and section 16.1 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, and he submitted that the expression \\"statutes of the legislature\\" used in subsection 18(2) includes municipal by-laws and that this provision imposed on municipalities of the province an obligation to enact their by-laws in the two official languages. He argued that, given the significant percentage of the Francophones in this municipality, the obligation applies to the City of Moncton. His claim was successful.canlii.org: \\"Charlebois v.

He succeeded his father Sallakshana-Varman as the ruler of the Jejakabhukti region (Bundelkhand in present-day Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh). The Chandela descriptions contain only vague eulogies of him, so little historical information is known about his reign. He abdicated the throne in favour of his uncle Prithvi-Varman.  Early life  Jayavarman was the son of his predecessor Sallakshana-Varman, as stated in the Mau inscription of Madana-Varman. The only available inscription of Jayavarman is the post-script to an inscription originally issued by his ancestor Dhanga. This inscription, now affixed to the porch of the Vishvanatha temple at Khajuraho, states that \\"N·πõpati Jayavarmma-deva\\" had it re-written in clear letters, presumably because it had become illegible or had been damaged. The inscription contains conventional praise of the king, and states that Jayavarman had uprooted \\"mountain-like great princes\\" in battles. This inscription is dated 6 April 1117 CE. In absence of any other evidence, and dating Sallakshana's ascension to 1100 CE, Jayavarman's ascension can be dated to 1110 CE, assuming 10 years for each generation.  Career  The inscriptions of Jayavarman's successors also contain vague eulogies about him. The Mau inscription calls him the residence of \\"generosity, truth, policy and heroism\\". It also states that he outshone the princes just like a rising sun deprives lamps of their lustre. The Ajaygarh inscription of Vira-Varman calls him the sole abode of victory, but does not name any rivals defeated by him. According to the Mau inscription, the minister Ananta who had served two of Jayavarman's predecessors, continued to serve the king and died during his reign. Ananta's son Gadadhara held the post of pratihara (chamberlain). The Ajaygarh inscription mentions another hereditary officer named Shridhara. According to the Khajuraho inscription, Jayapala of the Gauda family was Jayavarman's kayastha (a clerk attached to the king's office). Like his father, Jayavarman is known to have issued copper coins featuring the deity Hanuman. These coins state his name as Shrima-jayavarma-deva. No gold coins issued by him have been discovered. He commissioned renovation of some buildings at Khajuraho.  Abdication  A Kalanjara inscription states that Jayavarman abdicated the throne after being tired of governance. A devotee of Narayana, he proceeded to the \\"divine river\\" to wash away his sins. He appears to have died without an heir, as he was succeeded by his uncle Prithvi-Varman. The Chandela genealogy mentioned in the Nanyaura copper-plate inscription of Prithvi-Varman's successor Madana-Varman omits the name of Jayavarman and his father Sallakshana-Varman.

Location Athlumney Castle is located on Convent Road, to the southeast of Navan town centre, east of the Boyne. History Athlumney overlooks a key strategic point, where the Leinster Blackwater drains into the Boyne. The placename derives from the Irish for \\"Loman's ford\\", referring to Lomm√°n of Trim. Archaeological digs uncovered an Early Christian souterrain. The motte at Athlumney was built in the years after 1172 when Hugh de Lacy, Lord of Meath granted the title of Baron Skryne to his ally Adam de Feypo; he in turn granted Athlumney to a relative Amauri de Feipo, who built the motte. The older part of Athlumney Castle is a tower house (caiseal) built in the 15th century. The newer part of the castle is a Tudor-style fortified house attached to the tower. This was built in the late 16th century or early 17th century. It had large corridors and its ground floor kitchen provided heat for the first floor rooms where the Lord lived. The doorway is cut limestone and there is an oriel window on its eastern wall. In 1649 during Oliver Cromwell's Siege of Drogheda, the Maguire (Mac Uidhir) who held Athlumney Castle burned it down to prevent Cromwell taking possession of it. The last Lord of Athlumney was Sir Launcelot Dowdall. The Dowdalls lost their land during the Cromwellian Plantation and got it back under Charles II. They backed the Catholic James II and Launcelot Dowdall was High Sheriff of Meath in 1686. After James' defeat at the Battle of the Boyne (which took place just 19 km / 12 mi from Athlumney Castle), Dowdall left for France and supposedly burned the castle down again. The property later belonged to the Somerville family of Kentstown who took the title of Baron Athlumney. Building The older part of Athlumney Castle is a tower house (caiseal), with three storeys with a spiral staircase and holes for floor beams remaining on the first floor level. The later Tudor fortified house is also three storeys high, with four sets of widely spaced mullioned windows. It had large corridors and its ground floor kitchen provided heat for the first floor where the Lord and his family lived. The doorway is cut limestone and there is an oriel window in the eastern wall. There are projecting corner turrets. The castle has a barrel vault above the ground floor. The original entrance was protected by a murder- hole leading from a small room below the first floor level. This reflects a new age, when the Lord moved away from his retainers and lived in a residence with his own family. They lived on the first floor, heated by the kitchen below, with glass open windows and wooden floors. On the first floor there is a secret mural chamber, reached only by a set of stairs from above, assumed to be a priest hole.

In 1954, he founded Stanley Tate Builders Inc which focused on building houses and apartment buildings; and in 1959, expanded into constructing strip malls, warehouses, and office buildings. In 1969, he established Highpoint of Delray Builders Inc which focused on condominiums. In 1960, he established Investments Diversifed Limited which expanded into real estate activities in South Carolina and non-real estate investments. In 1986, he founded the holding company Tate Enterprises which today is a business conglomerate with investments in hotels, banks, steel, and auto part manufacturering with branches in China, London, and New York. Tate purchased Studio 54 after founders Steve Rubell and Ian Schrager were sent to prison for tax evasion; and hired them back to run the club after they were released. In the 1970s, Tate served as mayor of Bay Harbor Islands, Florida. Tate has been a Republican since the 1950s and was a personal friend of President George H.W. Bush who named him as Chairman of the National Advisory Board of the Resolution Trust Corporation (RTC), the agency that managed and liquidated banks‚Äô assets during the S&L; crisis. He continued with the role under the administration of President Bill Clinton until his resignation in 1993 stating \\"Mr. President, Washington is a vicious city . . . full of rumors, allegations, and accusations, without much, if any regard for truthfulness or factuality.\\" He served as the Miami-Dade County co-chair for Mitt Romney's presidential campaign.

It was designed by F H Faircloth and built in 1904 by John Guthrie. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992.  History  St Patrick's Roman Catholic Church was constructed in 1904 in the then important copper mining town of Mount Perry. The township of Mount Perry, about west of Bundaberg, was established following the discovery of copper in the vicinity in 1869. The first Roman Catholic priest to visit Mount Perry was Father James Horan who was based in Gayndah in 1870. He is thought to have made arrangements for the construction of a church, although work did not begin until after he had left for Peak Downs in November 1872. The church was completed under the direction of the succeeding priest at Gayndah, Father C Rossolini, though its form is not known. The population of the township quickly grew and 20 hotels sprang up in Mount Perry in the early 1870s, reflecting the high proportion of men without families on the field. However, the copper mine ceased operations in October 1877 and was sold by liquidators in January 1878 on the expectation that it would not be re-opened until the Mount Perry railway line was completed. This occurred in 1884, linking Mount Perry with Bundaberg. Mount Perry became the railhead for the Upper Burnett and a major centre; now having nine hotels including 6 newly built ones, a courthouse, hospital and a School of Arts. However, after a period of growth the town declined, until the mine closed in 1891 due to a fall in the price of copper. In 1893, Father Rossolini, by then based in Bundaberg, died. Father Mimnagh, who had assisted him, took over as parish priest in Bundaberg and continued to minister to Mount Perry. He served as Parish Priest of Bundaberg until 1917. Matters in Mount Perry soon improved as the London-based Queensland Copper Company bought the mine in 1898, sparking a revival in the town, and by 1904 the population in the field was 2000. In 1903 an Anglican church was built at Mount Perry reflecting the growth of the town and by this time, the early Catholic church had presumably become inadequate for the congregation. In August 1904 tenders were called for a new church to be built to the plans of Bundaberg architect F H Faircloth at an estimated cost of ¬£500. Frederic Herbert (Herb) Faircloth was born in Maryborough in 1870 and was a pupil of German-trained Bundaberg architect Anton Hettrich. Faircloth set up his own practice in Bundaberg in 1893 and was very successful, eventually being responsible for the design of almost every important building in Bundaberg, including extensions to the Church of the Holy Rosary. He was also responsible for much of the rebuilding of the town centre of Childers following a major fire in 1902. The first Mount Perry church was sold for removal in 1904 prior to the construction of the new church, which was completed by builder John Guthrie in 1905 for a cost, including furnishings, of ¬£667. St Patrick's was consecrated on 12 February 1905 with over 400 people from the surrounding area in attendance. Soon after the building of the new church, Mount Perry was created a separate parish. Father Sullivan at first occupied the back of the church, using the choir loft as a bedroom and eating with a neighbouring family. A Presbytery was built by the Maynard Brothers in 1914, but has not survived. Soon after this, the peak demand for copper passed and many mines closed. The mining venture at Mount Perry collapsed and the smelters in 1915 closed with a consequent dwindling of population. Many buildings were demolished or removed and Mount Perry was placed in the parish of Gayndah. The parish was reopened with the arrival of Father Frawley in 1939 and in September that year Archbishop James Duhig visited Mount Perry and the surrounding area. In later years Mount Perry became at various times part of Gin Gin, Gayndah and Childers Parishes. It is now part of the Gin Gin parish and has a visiting priest from that town. The church building has changed little. Early photographs show a timber bell tower to the north of the church, but this did not survive and the bell is now mounted on a simple frame.  Description  Side view of St Patricks, 2009 St Patrick's Church is an elevated timber framed building situated on a prominent ridge overlooking the town of Mount Perry and is a dominant feature of its townscape. The church is rectangular in plan, comprising a nave and side aisles and is clad in weatherboards. At the western end is a projecting gabled section housing a stairwell that accesses the choir loft. It is flanked by twin porches and stairs. The twin entrance doors are arched and this motif is echoed in decorative open timber work to the porches and to the gables of the portico and main roof. At the eastern end of the church is the sanctuary and adjoining vestry with a separate entrance on the northern side. The roof is clad with corrugated iron and is steeply pitched over the nave with aisle roofs springing from below clerestory windows. Crosses are located at the ends of the main roof and the gabled roof of the entrance portico. The church is lit with timber-framed lancet windows placed alternately singly and in pairs. The triple lancet windows in the sanctuary are set with stained glass. The interior of the church is very intact and the clear finish to internal lining boards and painted decorative trim appears to be that applied when the building was first constructed. Light fittings, hardware and furniture including altar, pews, statuary and a small harmonium are also original.  Heritage listing  St Patricks Church was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. St Patrick's Church is important for its close association with the development of Mount Perry as a noted copper centre in the 19th and early 20th centuries, and with the development of Catholicism within the Diocese of Brisbane, both of which illustrate the pattern of Queensland history. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. St Patrick's is a good example of the Carpenter Gothic architectural style used in church construction. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. The building has considerable aesthetic and architectural merit, and through its form, scale, materials, detailing and plantings and makes an important aesthetic contribution to the Mount Perry townscape. St Patrick's Church survives reasonably intact, with much of the original furnishings and finishes being retained. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The place has a special association for local Catholics as a centre of Catholic worship and social gatherings throughout the 20th century.

Dedicated to Saint Spyridon, its history is linked to that of the nearby Sf√¢ntul Spiridon Hospital. The original church on the site was built between 1752 and 1758.Dan Ghinea, Enciclopedia geograficƒÉ a Rom√¢niei, p. 702. Bucharest: Editura EnciclopedicƒÉ, 2000 Funds were supplied by the learned boyar »òtefan Bosie, whom the expense bankrupted; he was later joined by hetman Vasile Ruset and the merchant Anastasie Lipscanul of Corfu. The ktitors also founded the hospital, Ia»ôi's first, in 1757. This took place during the rule of Prince Constantin Racovi»õƒÉ, who issued the decree ordering construction. It is unknown why the somewhat unusual name of Spyridon was selected: this is possibly because he was the patron saint of the Ghica family, or because his canon was printed at Ia»ôi in 1750. The church was initially used as a monastery, and in 1763, Ecumenical Patriarch Samuel declared it stauropegic, making its archimandrite the titular bishop of Irenopolis. In 1770, during the Russo-Turkish War, the Russian army was quartered inside the building. Andi Emanuel Mihalache, History at the Ia»ôi County Cultural Office site The church was gravely damaged in the 1802 Vrancea earthquake, demolished in late 1804 and completely rebuilt in 1807.Dan BƒÉdƒÉrƒÉu, Ioan Capro»ôu, Ia»ôii vechilor zidiri: p√ÆnƒÉ la 1821, p. 385. Ia»ôi: Casa EditorialƒÉ Demiurg, 2007, It was repaired in 1862, 1938, 1976 and 1990. The bell tower dates to 1786, a conclusion drawn from the presence of Alexandru Mavrocordat Firaris' coat of arms. A date of 1757 has also been proposed, coinciding with the surrounding wall built by Racovi»õƒÉ. It is shaped like the reed cap worn by Saint Spyridon; at first resembling a Russian onion dome, the present shape was fixed in 1862. Initially, its tip featured a crescent, the idea being to offer a certain protection against Ottoman attacks. In 1807, when the structure was rebuilt, this was replaced by an eye within a triangle, a symbol of divinity. The Parisian clock was added after 1830, in line with an express provision of Regulamentul Organic. The roof's current form also dates to 1862. Twin fountains, inscribed in Greek, Ottoman Turkish and Romanian Cyrillic, were added by Grigore III Ghica in 1765; the water flowed along a tiled path from what is now the Botanical Garden. Architecturally, rectangular forms predominate. The interior features a central nave flanked by two smaller side naves. The mural frescoes beneath the cupola depict the Four Evangelists, while the cupola ceiling shows Christ Pantocrator and the altar has the Holy Trinity. The ornamented marble imitation from the interior dates to 1863. During the same period, Eusta»õie Altini executed the iconostasis painting. In 1863, Dimitrie Ghica had the iconostasis repaired and coated in gold. The church property includes valuable items such as worship items in precious metals, vestments, and sacred books decorated with gilt silver and Biblical scenes in porcelain enamel. Short history at the Saint Spyridon parish site The body of Grigore Ghica, beheaded by the Ottomans in 1777, is buried inside the church, while his head was taken to Istanbul. There Greek inscription mentions a \\"premature death\\", while the sculpted palm branches signify martyrdom.

In 2014, LA Weekly included one of Bystedt's murals in their list of the top ten murals in the city.  Photography  = \\"The Lost Warhols\\" = In 1982, Bystedt was a student at New York University working on a photography book of male models. Inspired by the modeling Warhol had done the year prior for Barney's in GQ Magazine, Bystedt wanted to include him in her project. Although Warhol rarely participated in shoots where he was a model rather than the artist, he agreed to let Bystedt photograph him at his iconic studio, The Factory. For the sitting, Warhol dressed himself in a tweed Perry Ellis sports coat, wore a neatly combed white toupee, rather than his signature \\"fright wig,\\" and held a miniature American flag. Bystedt took 36 frames of Warhol and published two of them in her book of male models, Not Just Another Pretty Face. The negatives were then placed in storage and subsequently lost until 2011 when Bystedt rediscovered ten of them.

It was built in 1874 by Queensland Department of Public Works. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 10 June 2011.  History  The stone gunpowder magazine located in a paddock to the east of Sandy Camp Road, about north of the town of Mount Perry, was constructed in 1874 to safely store the explosives used in copper mining at Mount Perry and is the oldest known surviving government powder magazine in Queensland. The Mount Perry area was explored from 1846, and early runs in the district included Yenda and Tenningering (1849) and Mount Perry (1851). Copper was discovered at Mount Perry in mid 1869. On 2 June 1871 the Queensland Surveyor- General directed John C Thompson to complete plans for a township to be known as Perry, later changed to Tenningering. The government town site was ignored by those who wished to live closer to the Mount Perry copper mine, and a town called Fife-Barnett was surveyed on private land half a mile from Tenningering. The government's post and telegraph office had to be moved to Fife-Barnett, which later became known as the township of Mount Perry. Mount Perry prospered for most of the 1870s, a period when the price of copper was high and mining in general was experiencing rapid growth in Queensland. In 1872 the first churches were built, there were 25 hotels, and mail services commenced. By May 1872 furnaces were operational, producing a regulus (impure metal) consisting of 80% copper, smelted from the poorer ores. Richer ores were dispatched in their crude state. By 1873 the population of Mount Perry was estimated to be 3,000, and a refining furnace was opened that year so that pure copper could be shipped. The process of construction of the magazine at Mount Perry began in September 1873, when tenders were called by the Department of Public Works. By Christmas 1873 the material for the magazine was being assembled, with erection to begin in a fortnight. Expenditure on erecting the magazine during 1874 amounted to . Jason Walsh was appointed as the Powder Magazine Keeper at Mount Perry on 13 January 1875, at a salary of and on 22 February 1875 notice was given in the Queensland Government Gazette that the powder magazine at Mount Perry was approved as a place where gunpowder could be stored. The rate for storing or more for six weeks was 1 shilling, plus 2 pence for every week thereafter. The magazine was located on the road to Fortunatus (now Sandy Camp Road) on a reserve for a Gunpowder Magazine declared in the Queensland Government Gazette of 18 December 1875. The western boundary of the reserve was the road, the northern boundary was Drummers Creek, and the southern boundary ran along the northern boundary of portion 65 (Magazine Road). The eastern boundary was an extension of the line of the eastern boundary of portion 65. For over a century, control of all explosives and gunpowder imported into Queensland was the province of the Harbour Master's Department (1860‚Äì62), the Department of Ports & Harbours (1862‚Äì93), the Marine Department (1894-1928), and the Department of Harbours and Marine (1929‚Äì63). In 1964, responsibility was shifted to the Queensland Department of Health. Under The Navigation Act of 1876 the master of any ship entering a Queensland port with gunpowder to be unloaded had to ensure that it was placed in a government magazine. The various incarnations of the Harbours Department were responsible for the provision of magazines and for the safe storage of explosives at Queensland ports of entry. The Act further regulated the conveyance and storage of gunpowder in any place in Queensland, not just in the ports. On the goldfields, magazines were initially administered by the Mines Department, as control of magazines outside ports was not vested in the Marine Department until 1907. Some common magazine design features include sturdy construction, small windows and solid doors, ventilation and overhanging eaves, timber floors with copper nails or timber pegs instead of iron nails, and the provision of lightning conductors and copper earthing straps. Magazines were generally located away from other buildings, and were sometimes surrounded by earthworks to deflect any blast. Magazine complexes were often surrounded by walls or fences to keep people out. The Queensland Department of Public Works built powder magazines during the 1860s at Brisbane, Maryborough and Gympie; and during the 1870s at Townsville, Ravenswood, Mount Perry, Millchester, Cooktown (the Cooktown Powder Magazine), Eagle Farm, Thornborough and Maytown. The first magazines at Cairns (on a barge), Charters Towers, Croydon, Georgetown, Herberton, Normanton, Port Douglas and Rockhampton were all built in the 1880s. The magazine at Mount Perry is the earliest government-built magazine known to be surviving in Queensland. The powder magazine's use was closely tied to the success of mining in the town. Low copper prices meant that the Mount Perry copper mine closed in the second half of 1877. The town stagnated, and the population was only 500 by 1883. At this time the copper mine was being worked on a small scale on tribute (miners working a mine themselves, while sharing profits with the owners), with limited smelting. The owners of the mine eagerly awaited the arrival of the Mount Perry railway line from Bundaberg, which would lower the cost of bringing in firewood for the smelters, and taking out copper. In August 1877 the Queensland Government approved three railways to connect mining towns to their principal ports: Townsville to Charters Towers; Bundaberg to Mount Perry; and Maryborough to Gympie. However, when the railway reached Mount Perry in 1884, the anticipated mining boom did not occur and copper prices remained low. The mine closed by April 1885, but it reopened in 1888 as prices rose. Mount Perry enjoyed a short revival and by October 1888 the smelting furnaces had been rebuilt and the shafts re-opened by the Mount Perry Copper and Reid's Creek Gold Mining and Smelting Company. After copper prices slumped in April 1889, the mine closed once more. The Mining Warden's Report for 1891 stated \\"the cessation of the copper works has virtually killed the place [Mount Perry]. All, or all who can obtain employment elsewhere, have left, or are leaving it\\". The magazine reserve was cancelled in 1891 (during the mining slump in Mount Perry and a period of economic depression in Queensland in general) along with a timber reserve to the north of Drummers Creek, and in 1892 both reserves became part of the Agricultural Farm 848 (Portion 5v, later Lot 194). Within a decade of the closure of the magazine, things had changed. In 1901 the Queensland Copper Company commenced large scale operations at Mount Perry, which boomed in the early 1900s, and the population on the field was about 2,000 in 1904, including 25 Chinese. During this period copper was a major source of mining income for Queensland, and the largest producers included Herberton, Mount Perry, Mount Morgan and Cloncurry. Between 1900 and 1914, of copper were produced in the Mount Perry area, along with of gold and of silver. However, the final crash came before World War I; the mine was closed for the holidays at the end of 1913, and in January 1914 the Queensland Copper Company announced that it would not re-open. Although some mining activity continued under the tribute system, Mount Perry's glory days were over. After mining at Mount Perry collapsed, there was another dwindling of the town's population and many buildings were demolished or removed. The copper smelter site is now a ruin, with the main surviving feature being the large slag heap. In contrast, the powder magazine north of the township is a rare surviving element of built mining infrastructure from the 1870s boom period at Mount Perry. In 1940 the Deed of Grant for Portion 5v was issued to Edith FE Walsh, the wife of John P Walsh, as Executrix of and sole Legatee under the will of Joseph William Mooney. The farm passed to MW Mooney in 1964 and then to another owner in 1982. Like the Cooktown powder magazine, which was constructed in 1875-76 for the Department of Ports & Harbours to designs prepared in the office of the Queensland Colonial Architect (FDG Stanley from 1873 to 1881), the Mount Perry powder magazine is a rectangular building with a single doorway and narrow window openings with brick arches. The magazines were also similar in size, Mount Perry being long by wide, and Cooktown being . However, the Cooktown magazine is built of brick, on a stone plinth. Both magazines also had timber floors, although only the joist-holes in the lower walls remain at Mount Perry; and both have wall vents to the sub-floor area. Although Mount Perry no longer has a roof, it is likely that it had overhanging eaves, as was the case at Cooktown. It is also possible that, like Cooktown, its timber door and window shutters (no longer extant) were faced in copper. The Cooktown magazine received a new roof in 1996, and in 2009 it qualified for a Q150 grant of $150,000 for restoration work.  Description  Located to the east of Sandy Camp Road, between Magazine Road in the south and Drummers Creek in the north, the powder magazine stands alone in a paddock. In late 2008, two trees were growing inside the roofless structure. The magazine is long (south-western and north- eastern elevations) and wide, its walls being thick. It is constructed of random rubble brought to courses, with rendered quoining to the corners of the building and around the exterior of the windows and the door. There are brick arches above some of the windows with timber lintels. There is a door and two windows in the south-western elevation, plus two windows in north-eastern elevation. The interior walls on the south-western and north-eastern elevations have recesses for floor joists, but the timber floor no longer exists. Wall vents are set below the floor level, about level with the joist holes; with two vents in each of the long elevations, and one in each of the short elevations. There are some small holes in the wall set with copper plates, and some copper piping juts out of a wall. Some timber framing survives in one of the window interiors.  Heritage listing  Mount Perry Powder Magazine was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 10 June 2011 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. The Mount Perry Powder Magazine, built by the Queensland Government in 1874, is a rare surviving relic of the Mount Perry copper mining boom period of the 1870s. This decade was a period of rapid expansion of mining in Queensland, and Mount Perry was an important mining centre during most of the 1870s, and then again between 1901 and 1913. The economic importance to Queensland of mining at Mount Perry was illustrated by its selection in 1877 as the destination of one of three mining-related railway lines approved by the Queensland Government. The place demonstrates rare, uncommon or endangered aspects of Queensland's cultural heritage. The Mount Perry Powder Magazine is rare as one of three known surviving 19th century government powder magazines in Queensland; and it is also the oldest known example. In addition it is a rare surviving example of built mining infrastructure from the heyday of Mount Perry. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. Despite its incomplete state, lacking floors and roof, the solidly constructed walls of the 1874 Mount Perry Powder Magazine, its narrow windows and remnant copper fittings, are all standard features of Queensland government powder magazines of the 19th century; and its isolated location demonstrates the practice of locating gunpowder at a safe distance from population centres.

A clothed person is faced with six naked people who are initially hidden in booths. Their bodies and faces are gradually revealed through successive rounds, from the feet up. At each round, the chooser eliminates one naked person until only two are left, when the chooser also takes off their clothes to make the final choice. The chooser then decides which person they wish to go out with, and the two (or, occasionally, three) then go for a fully clothed date. The programme then presents their feedback after the date. It premiered on 25 July 2016 and is presented by Anna Richardson. In November 2016, Naked Attraction was renewed for a second series, which began airing on 29 June 2017. In February 2018, the show was renewed for a third series, which began airing on 24 August 2018. A fourth series aired the same year, a fifth in 2019, and a sixth in 2020. Numerous complaints about the programme were made by viewers to the broadcasting watchdog Ofcom due to the full-frontal nudity that is featured in the programme. Ofcom chose not to investigate as there was nothing that breached their rules: the show was purely a dating show and did not contain any sexual activity, and was shown after the watershed. Production Each episode can take up to twelve hours to film, although the contestant choosing a date only has to disrobe for fifteen minutes. The resultant date takes place at 9:00 am the next day. The picker has to have someone with him/her at all times to make sure they do not accidentally bump into one of the contestants, and if one of the contestants needs a toilet break, they must be escorted out by a member of staff so the picker does not see them leave their coloured booth.

It was developed in association with Camelot Marketing Group in order to positively reinforce the pros of brushing, flossing, and healthy dental care. Seen as a fun way to teach children the importance of dental care, players fight as \\"Plaqueman\\" to fight plaque using a toothbrush and dental floss. It was also made in association with the American Dental Association, released during National Dental Month, and supported by dentists. Gameplay Using a toothbrush and dental floss, the player must keep the teeth clean while avoiding contact with the Plaque Germ, known as \\"D.K\\". If D.K. comes into contact with the player, this will result in loss of one life. The brush needs tooth paste to work so the player must apply tooth paste. Floss is used for the space between teeth. If the teeth aren't cleaned properly and start to decay a warning bell sounds. Eventually the tooth will disappear, reflecting tooth loss. If a tooth is completely cleaned, a brief musical score will play and the teeth will change colors repeatedly. If the player comes into contact with D.K. at this time, the Plaque Germ will disappear for a time. Losing all lives or having four teeth lost will end the game.  Reception  Ready: A Commodore 64 Retrospective described it as a \\"simple game\\", a \\"standout\\" of Commodore's first generation of educational software, and a \\"pioneer in the serious games and games for health fields\\". However, the book also noted that the game aged relatively quickly due to the rapid improvement in game quality in the following years. Microcomputing considered the game an \\"excellent\\" example of how computer software could be used educationally to create behavioural change. Games Village wrote that behind the patently idiotic facade, it instead proves to be a balanced and enjoyable puzzle game. The game was included in the \\"Open Wide!

Early life and education She was born Beryl Scott on 9 July 1923 in Maryville, New South Wales. She grew up in the Newcastle area, the eldest of four children and attended Cardiff Public School and Newcastle Girls High School. She completed her Leaving Certificate, coming first in the state in geology. She received a scholarship to attend the University of Sydney, winning a prize each year and took her B.Sc. with Honours in 1947. Her early research looked at the geology of the Stanhope region of the Hunter Valley, near Newcastle. She would later study mineralogy, geochemistry and the formation of minerals in andesitic rocks within the eastern parts of New South Wales.  Early career  Beryl Scott worked as a staff demonstrator during her B.Sc., continuing her study toward an Honours degree. She won the University medal and a research scholarship. She took a Dip.Ed. from the University of Sydney in 1948. Although appointed to work as a teacher at Hunter Girls High School after graduation, Scott was offered a teaching position at the University of Tasmania, and she took this job whilst working toward her PhD. Her supervisor was Professor S. Warren Carey. During her time at the University of Tasmania, Scott won a Rotary Fellowship, the first to be given to a woman to attend the University of Cambridge, and in 1949 studied there in the Department of Mineralogy and Petrology. Scott counted Germaine Joplin as an inspiration to her studies whilst at Cambridge. She met Ali El-Nashar, an Egyptian philosophy student who was also studying his PhD at Cambridge, and they married in 1952 after she completed her PhD at the University of Tasmania, the first woman to earn a PhD in geology from an Australian university. Following her marriage in Cairo, Egypt, Scott who was now known as Beryl Nashar, returned to Australia to give birth to their son, Tarek in 1953, while her husband remained in Spain, Lebanon and later Egypt. Ali El-Nashar was not able to find work in Australia. An ambitious Nashar accepted a lecturing position at the Newcastle University College (then part of NSW University of Technology) in 1955, and was steadily promoted to senior lecturer, and associate professor. She became the foundation Professor of Geology in 1965, only the second woman to be promoted to a Professorial position at that time, after Dorothy Hill of the University of Queensland. When the college became the University of Newcastle in 1969, Nashar became the first female Dean at an Australian university.  Later life and awards  A longtime Newcastle resident, and with a strong ethic toward public service, Nashar sat on the Board of Directors of the Royal Newcastle Hospital for over 16 years, as well as the Faculty of Medicine. She was also on the Board of the Greater Newcastle Building Society. She was president of the Australian Federation of Business and Professional Women in 1964 and president of the International Federation of Business and Professional Women in 1974. She received an OBE in 1972. She was on the Secondary Schools Board from 1970‚Äì1975. She was appointed Woman of the Year by the NSW branch of the United Nations Association in 1975. She retired from the University of Newcastle in 1980, intending to join her husband, but Ali El- Nashar died the same year. Nashar was appointed Emeritus Professor. She sat on the Academic Committee of the Higher Education Board from 1982‚Äì1987. She also sat on the Committee that looked into the establishment of the University of Western Sydney. In 1999 she received the Rotary Foundations' Scholar Alumni Service award. She received a Commonwealth Recognition Award for Senior Australians in 2001 and was made an Officer of the Order of Australia in 2002 for \\"service to the community, particularly through raising awareness of issues affecting women, and to education\\". She was also awarded an Honorary D.Sc. in 1988. A portrait of her was submitted to the Archibald Prize in 1968. Nashar published four books and 30 papers during her career. Nashar died on 5 May 2012 in Newcastle, New South Wales. She was survived by her son and his family, and her siblings.

One of the members, Mario Gonzalo, invites a guest named John Sand, whom Gonzalo describes as a man who \\"never tells a lie.\\" Sand explains to the Widowers that he is accused of stealing cash and negotiable bonds from his uncle's company.

Yet he repeatedly assures the Widowers: \\"I did not take the cash or the bonds.\\" After much questioning of Sand by the Widowers, the club's waiter, Henry, solves the puzzle by observing that \\"many a literal truth tells a lie by implication.\\" With Sand glaring at him, Henry asks him one question: \\"Did you, by any chance, take the cash and the bonds?\\" Without answering Henry, Sand takes his coat and departs, reminding the Widowers that their rules forbid them to disclose dinner conversations outside the club.

The remains are indistinct and thickly covered by woods, but it appears to have been an Iron Age farmstead, and not a defensive structure. Location Wraxall Camp is a scheduled monument in the parish of Wraxall and Failand in North Somerset, in an upland region of carboniferous limestone. The site is east of Wraxall village and north of Failand village. It is an Iron Age settlement with a raised oval interior about wide on the long axis. There may be traces of ancient agriculture between the camp and Manor Farm to the north, and the earthwork may be connected with the remains of a field system south and southwest of Manor Farm. Partial excavations in 1928 found sherds of black burnished pottery and a Kimmeridge shale bracelet, typical of rural settlements in the Iron Age. The finds, placed in the University of Bristol Spel√¶ological Society Museum in Bristol, were destroyed by bombing in World War II (1939‚Äì45). Many worked flints have been found in the fields around the camp. The site is thickly covered in trees. Structure From its location on relatively high but level ground the camp seems most likely to have been a farmstead, and not defensive. Minor earthworks mark the homes in the interior, which were surrounded by a bank and ditch. The bank, up to wide, was made of earth and small stones over natural rock outcrops.

It was designed by William Pagan and built from 1906 to 1907 using day labour. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992.  History  Construction of the section of railway from Wetheron to Gayndah began in March 1906 using day labour. Completion of the line was delayed building two bridges of special designs over gorges between Ideraway and Gayndah. The Ideraway Creek Railway Bridge was designed and drawings signed by Chief Engineer, William Pagan, on 10 December 1906. The extension was opened for traffic on 16 December 1907. The other bridge is the Steep Rocky Creek Railway Bridge.  Description  The Ideraway Creek bridge is one of the most unusual bridges in Australia. It demonstrates the economic re-use of part of the erection truss used to build the Burdekin River Rail Bridge at Macrossan between Townsville and Charters Towers opened in 1899. The complete truss was long whereas the Ideraway Creek bridge uses only of the span. The pinned construction and multiple members of the truss were originally designed for rapid assembly and disassembly. The bridge work consists of: * Wetheron embankment * 1 x 3 x timber longitudinals, timber trestle, common timber trestle * 1 x 3 x timber longitudinals, common timber trestle, common concrete pier * 1 x 4 x deck-type pin-jointed fishbelly truss (ex Burdekin River bridge, Macrossan) with transom tops, six sets of two steel longitudinals, common concrete piers * 1 x 3 x timber longitudinals, common concrete pier, common timber trestle * 1 x 3 x timber longitudinals, common timber trestle, timber trestle * Gayndah embankment  Heritage listing  Ideraway Creek Railway Bridge was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. The deck-type pin-jointed fishbelly truss main span is unique in Australia. It is the only bridge of its type in Queensland and therefore the longest span of its type in Queensland. It innovatively re-uses the falsework of the Burdekin River Bridge at Macrossan of 1899. (This falsework had been re-used on two separate bridges prior to this one). The bridge demonstrates the economies employed in the construction of Queensland's railways. The place demonstrates rare, uncommon or endangered aspects of Queensland's cultural heritage. The deck-type pin-jointed fishbelly truss main span is unique in Australia. It is the only bridge of its type in Queensland and therefore the longest span of its type in Queensland. The place is important in demonstrating a high degree of creative or technical achievement at a particular period.

The Manchu bow () is a type of composite recurve bow historically used in Manchuria, and subsequently spread to China, Mongolia, and Tibet during the Qing dynasty. It is similar in construction and likely shares roots with the medieval Mongol bow. It is characterized by very large siyahs, long draw length, prominent string bridges, and use with typically large and heavy arrows. Due to its extensive usage outside Manchuria, this bow is also often identified as a Chinese bow or Mongol bow, and during the 17th century, its widespread usage (along with the increasing proliferation of firearms) almost completely displaced all other types of bows in the Qing Empire. The Manchu bow was traditionally thumb drawn using a cylindrical thumb ring. The early inhabitants of Manchuria likely used other types of bow as well, and may have used a type of mulberry longbow for hunting in wet weather conditions which could negatively affect the glues used for composite bow construction.

Sharp, \\"Red Tide\\", Soviet Rifle Divisions Formed from June to December 1941, Soviet Order of Battle World War II, Nafziger, 1996, p. 79 * 253rd Antitank Battalion (as of January 2, 1942) * 298th Antiaircraft Battery (619th Antiaircraft Battalion as of April 20, 1943) * 508th Mortar Battalion (until October 5, 1942) * 394th Reconnaissance Company * 509th (later 612th) Sapper Battalion * 783rd Signal Battalion (later Company) * 417th Medical/Sanitation Battalion * 410th Chemical Protection (Anti-gas) Company * 397th Motor Transport Company * 186th Field Bakery * 756th Divisional Veterinary Hospital * 1411th Field Postal Station * 773rd Field Office of the State Bank October Revolution Anniversary Parade, Red Square, Moscow, Nov. 7, 1941The division was moved to the Moscow Military District in October where it was assigned to the newly-forming 26th (Reserve) Army, under the Reserve of the Supreme High Command. Some elements of the division entered active service in a highly dramatic manner, by first marching through Red Square in the famous October Revolution anniversary parade on November 7, then straight on to the front lines just 10‚Äì15 km away, being assigned to the 20th Army of the Western Front.Sharp, \\"Red Tide\\", p. 79. Dunn states this assignment was not made until December; Walter S. Dunn, Jr., Stalin's Keys to Victory, Stackpole Books, Mechanicsburg, PA, 2007, p. 82  Combat service  The division played a vigorous role in the defense of Moscow. Maj. Gen. Leonid Mikhailovich Sandalov, former chief of staff of the 20th Army, inspected the 1106th Rifle Regiment on its arrival in Moscow and noted, \\"The warmly clothed and adequately equipped sub-units of the regiment made a good impression [on me].\\" As November moved into December, the 331st, fighting in the area of the Moscow-Volga canal, stopped the enemy advance at Lobnia Station, 25 km from Moscow.Soviet General Staff, The Battle of Moscow, ed. & trans. R.W. Harrison, Helion & Co., Ltd., Solihull, UK, 2017, Kindle ed., part III, ch. 2 =Moscow counteroffensive= On December 2, as one of the harbingers of the wider counter-offensive that started a few days later, the division took part in a strong counter-attack from the area of Khlebnikovo towards Krasnaia Poliana. Backed by tanks and artillery, the attack made limited gains, but on the 6th it merged with the general offensive, broke into the village with the help of 28th Rifle Brigade, secured it,Soviet General Staff, Battle of Moscow, Kindle ed., part IV, ch. 2 and took a German 210mm gun, which had been used to shell Moscow, as a trophy. In the next two days the division and the brigade advanced 4.5 km further and completely penetrated the German defenses, but the lack of skis and armor support limited the planned advance of 30 km to only about 10 ‚Äì 12 km. Nevertheless, by December 20 the division had liberated the town of Volokolamsk.Aleksander A. Maslov, Fallen Soviet Generals, ed. and trans. D. M. Glantz, Frank Cass Publishing, London, UK, 1998, pp. 63, 65 Following this victory, 20th Army attempted to continue its advance, but had little success until, on December 23, the Army commander was ordered to concentrate on a narrow-front breakthrough near Volokolamsk station and to cease advancing on a broad front. By noon on January 2, 1942, the 331st had captured Khvorostinin, but failed to take Birkino, even with armor support. The latter was finally liberated on the 4th, and by the next day the division was fighting on the outskirts of Posadinki with elements of German 35th Infantry Division.Soviet General Staff, Battle of Moscow, Kindle ed., part V, ch. 3 On January 7, 20th Army was ordered to regroup to carry on the offensive against gradually increasing resistance; by this time General Korol was in command of an ad-hoc group which included his own division, along with 40th Rifle Brigade, 31st Tank Brigade, two artillery regiments and the 15th Guards Mortar Battalion. This group was ordered to \\"destroy the enemy in the area Zubovo - 137-km Station and by the end of the day reach the area Kuryanovo - Vysokovo.\\" The attack was to be supported by a one-hour artillery preparation by a long-range artillery group. The regrouping was completed by January 9, although the 331st was still fighting for Posadinki over these two days. The new offensive began at 1030 hours. on January 10. The forward edge of the German defense was crushed fairly quickly, but only after persistent attacks. Beginning at 1400 the division, backed by 64th Rifle Brigade, waged an unsuccessful fight against two enemy battalions in a wooded stronghold east of Aksenovo. Over the next two days the Germans continued to hold out, while the 331st suffered significant losses until it finally took Aksenovo in the 13th. The next day German forces along the attack sector began falling back towards a defensive line near Gzhatsk. This withdrawal continued over the next ten days, with tired Soviet forces in slow pursuit. The division, \\"which disposed of an insignificant number of troops\\", was held back along the line of the Ruza River.Soviet General Staff, Battle of Moscow, Kindle ed., part V, ch. 6 Gzhatsk would not be liberated until March, 1943. The 331st would remain in Western Front until the Front was disbanded. In early 1942 it was briefly transferred to the 5th Army, before returning to the 20th Army, where it remained until March, 1943. General Korol was briefly succeeded by Col. Gavriil Antonovich Kutalev in February, and then by Col. Aleksandr Emelyanovich Kletz in March. On April 10, Col. (later Major General) Pyotr Filippovich Berestov took command and he would hold it for the duration of the war. =Operation Mars= In the planning for Operation Mars in November, the division was given a leading role in the 20th Army's assault. Alongside the 247th Rifle Division, and supported by the 80th and 240th Tank Brigades, the 331st was tasked to cross the mostly-frozen Vazuza River between Trostino and Pechora, to take German strong points at Zevalovka and Prudy. On the second day, the second German defensive position would be taken. Following this the division would cross the railroad between Rzhev and Sychyovka, and reduce the German strong point at Khlepen. In the event, on November 25, the division successfully forced the river line and took Prudy, but was halted by heavy fire from Khlepen. The 247th had made greater progress and the rest of the 331st reinforced that bridgehead. Overnight, the front commander, General I.S. Konev, decided to try to pass a mobile reserve force through this scant lodgement to complete the breakthrough. The following day the two rifle divisions continued to struggle to expand the bridgehead, but with little success. The tanks and cavalry of the reserve managed to tear a hole in the defenses and get into the enemy rear, but the infantry found it impossible to follow. The gains made by the 331st over the following days were negligible. For most of the remainder of the operation the division held the left flank of its army, recovering from its losses.David M. Glantz, Zhukov's Greatest Defeat, University Press of Kansas, Lawrence, KS, 1999, pp. 52, 84‚Äì88, 94 In the period from November 25 to December 18 the division lost 597 men killed, 1,445 wounded, and 106 missing-in-action, for a total of 2,148 casualties.Glantz, After Stalingrad, Helion & Co., Ltd., Solihull, UK, 2009, p. 90 =Smolensk and Orsha Offensives= In April 1943, the 331st was transferred to the 45th Rifle Corps in the 31st Army; it would remain in this army for the duration of the war. On June 19 the division was awarded its first Order of the Red Banner, remarkably early in the war for a regular rifle division. Colonel Berestov was promoted to Major General on September 1. During the third phase of Operation Suvorov at 2200 hours on September 24 the 31st Army, led by the 331st, 215th and 133rd Rifle Divisions, began an unusual night assault to break into Smolensk just as it was being evacuated by the bulk of the German forces, which blew up all three bridges across the Dniepr in the process. By 0600 hours on September 25 large parts of the city had been liberated. An advance guard, consisting of the 2nd Battalion of 1106th Rifle Regiment, commanded by Cpt. Prokofii Fyodorovich Klepach, crossed to the south bank of the river and hoisted the Red Banner from the roof of the Smolensk Hotel, one of the few major buildings that avoided German demolitions.Robert Forczyk, Smolensk 1943: The Red Army's Relentless Advance, Osprey Publishing, Oxford, UK, 2019, Kindle ed. Later that day the division was granted the following battle honor:Sharp, \\"Red Tide\\", p. 79 Captain Klepach would further distinguish himself in the fighting for Borisov during Operation Bagration and would be made a Hero of the Soviet Union on March 24, 1945.http://www.warheroes.ru/hero/hero.asp?Hero_id=7420. In Russian; English translation available. Retrieved March 6, 2019. Through the last years of the war the 331st was designated as an assault division, and eventually earned the moniker of being \\"the best in the 31st Army\\".Boris Gorbachevsky, Through the Maelstrom, ed. and trans. S. Britton, University Press of Kansas, Lawrence, KS, 2008, p. 333 Following the victory at Smolensk, Western Front was ordered to continue the advance into Belarus with the immediate objective of Orsha. In the event, this goal would only be obtained after nine months of costly fighting. As of October 1 the 331st was serving in 71st Rifle Corps, and it would remain in this Corps for the duration of the war. 31st Army began its attack on October 3. The Army commander, Lt. Gen. V. A. Gluzdovskii, deployed his 71st Corps astride the Smolensk - Orsha highway and the railroad north of the Dniepr River, advancing against the defenses of 197th Infantry Division. 71st Corps had its three rifle divisions side-by-side in first echelon, and was supported by the 42nd Guards Tank Brigade. During three days of heavy fighting the Corps' assault stalled in front of strong defenses which had been reinforced by the 18th Panzer Grenadier Division. However, 36th Rifle Corps managed to unhinge the German defenses north of the highway, and by October 9 the 197th Infantry began falling back, reaching a line from Shcheki on the Verkhita River southward to Novaia on the Dniepr by the 11th. While the advance had been limited, at this point the right wing of Western Front had reached positions roughly 20 km east of Orsha.Glantz, Battle for Belorussia, University Press of Kansas, Lawrence, KS, 2016, pp. 26, 62-66, 70 A second offensive on Orsha began on October 12. 71st Corps had been regrouped between the highway and the Dniepr, with 42nd Guards Tanks still in support. The assault went in after an 85-minute artillery preparation, but over two days of fighting the 331st, along with the rest of its Army, was stalled without making any significant gains, while suffering serious losses. A third attempt began on October 21, with all three Corps of 31st Army conducting a frontal assault with massed infantry backed by scattered tanks, following an intense artillery preparation; in this effort the 331st was in the second echelon. While again suffering heavy casualties, the Soviet forces smashed the defenses of 197th Infantry Division, and by early evening had penetrated 4 km deep on a front 1 km wide towards the village of Kireevo on the rail line to Orsha, and to Ivanovshchina on the Dniepr. A further attempt to exploit with armor was halted by German artillery. The offensive stalled again the next day.Glantz, Belorussia, pp. 71-77, 85-86 Another offensive began on November 14. The 331st, with the rest of 71st Corps, was located south of the highway, facing the 35th Panzer Grenadier Regiment of 25th Panzer Grenadier Division. This assault, which continued until the 19th, is mentioned in the 31st Army's history as follows: Further efforts were shut down until March 1944. General Gluzdovskii received orders to prepare a new offensive on February 27, which was to commence on March 1. Much of his Army was already in action at Babinavichy, so the only forces immediately available on the Orsha axis were the 331st and 88th Rifle Divisions; this left him little choice but to redeploy his 251st and 220th Rifle Divisions south to the rear of the 331st. Since this was the period of the rasputitsa this movement went slowly, and the attack did not begin until March 5. In the end the plan concentrated eight rifle divisions, one tank brigade and two tank regiments against the German 78th Assault Division, backed by roughly 35 tanks (including Tigers) and assault guns. After an artillery preparation of 50 minutes, the 331st, backed by the reinforcing 247th Rifle Division, managed to advance about 1 km and take a strongpoint at Lazyrshchiki, but that was the extent of the gains and the offensive collapsed by March 9, with losses of 1,898 men killed and 5,639 men wounded.Glantz, Belorussia, pp. 156-58, 381-87 During April the STAVKA launched an investigation into the operations, including all six Orsha offensives, of Western Front from October 12, 1943 to April 1, 1944, which reported on April 12. Among other findings it was noted that: This was just one of a long list of failures which led to General Gluzdovskii being relieved of command of 31st Army, and Army General V. D. Sokolovskii being removed from command of Western Front, which was then divided into two more manageably- sized Fronts.Glantz, Belorussia, pp. 545-46, 554http://www.generals.dk/general/Gluzdovskii/Vladimir_Alekseevich/Soviet_Union.html  Operation Bagration  In April, the 31st Army became part of the 3rd Belorussian Front when Western Front was split up. As part of the regrouping prior to the summer offensive, 36th Rifle Corps was moved to the south bank of the Dniepr, and the 331st was redeployed to that Corps' former sector on the north bank.Soviet General Staff, Operation Bagration, ed. & trans. R.W. Harrison, Helion & Co., Ltd., Solihull, UK, 2016, Kindle ed., vol. 1, part II, ch. 12 In the initial stages of Operation Bagration, the Front's immediate objective was, once again, the city of Orsha. The 331st had the direct support of the 959th SU Regiment (SU-76s) for its initial assault; this regiment had been assigned to support of 71st Corps since the beginning of June.Sharp, \\"Red Hammers\\", Soviet Self-Propelled Artillery and Lend Lease Armor 1941 - 1945, Soviet Order of Battle World War II, vol. XII, Nafziger, 1998, p. 51 In recognition of the 331st's role in the liberation of Orsha on June 27, it was awarded the Order of Suvorov, 2nd Class, on July 2. The division went on to assist in the liberation of Borisov. While two divisions of the 8th Guards Rifle Corps of the 11th Guards Army attacked from the west and north, the 331st drove into the south of the city and it was cleared of German forces by 0300 hrs. on July 1. In the following days it took part in the liberation of Minsk, before joining the general advance to the 1941 Soviet-German frontier.Dunn, Jr., Soviet Blitzkrieg, Stackpole Books, Mechanicsburg, PA, 2008, pp. 140‚Äì41, 156 The division was awarded its second Order of the Red Banner on July 23 for the liberation of the Belorussian capital, while on July 3 the 1104th Rifle, 1106th Rifle, and 896th Artillery Regiments were all given the name of the city as a battle honor.http://www.soldat.ru/spravka/freedom/1-ssr-4.html. Retrieved March 1, 2019 In recognition of his successful command of the division in this operation, Major General Berestov would be awarded the Gold Star of the Hero of the Soviet Union on June 27, 1945.Gorbachevsky, p. 335  Into Germany  In August, the division received a team of 23 women snipers from the Higher Sniper's School in Moscow. The survivors of this team continued to serve in the division until it was disbanded, although some members were detached to other divisions as conditions warranted.Gorbachevsky, pp. 336‚Äì44, 368 In the Vistula-Oder Offensive in January 1945, the 3rd Belorussian Front was tasked with driving into East Prussia from the east. The 31st Army was not on an assault sector, and in the first stages it was ordered to hold its positions stubbornly. By January 23‚Äì24, the 331st had joined in pursuit of the retreating German forces, and along with its corps helped capture the important road junction of Blenkheim, and the strongpoint of Treuburg on the approaches to L√∂tzen. However, in the first week of February, the German command had regrouped their 129th Infantry and 558th Grenadier Divisions as well as units of the 24th Panzer Division, which counterattacked in an attempt to encircle units of the 71st Rifle Corps; after several days fighting the attacks were beaten back and the advance resumed towards Kanditten.Soviet General Staff, Prelude to Berlin, ed. and trans. Richard W. Harrison, Helion & Co., Ltd., Solihull, UK, 2016, pp. 124, 227, 233 Following this, the 31st Army drove towards the Baltic coast. The 331st captured the rail junction of Landsberg from the march, and Berestov ordered the division northward, unaware that it was coming into the path of a powerful German counterstrike to hold open a land link to the rest of Germany. Under pressure, the 331st fell back to the outskirts of Landsberg, and savage fighting ensued. Meanwhile, the German columns led by Waffen SS troops bypassed the town to the south and north, leaving the fighting elements of the division encircled for two days until they were relieved from outside. Meanwhile, the southern German column had rampaged through the mostly-defenseless rear elements of the division, destroying the medical-sanitation battalion, the motor pool, and other units; in total more than 300 men and women were killed and more wounded.Gorbachevsky, pp. 365‚Äì69. Note that Gorbachevsky states this Landsberg is the present-day Gorz√≥w Wielkopolski, but that city is a good deal farther west, on the Warta River. On April 5 the 1106th Rifle Regiment was awarded the Order of the Red Banner for its role in the fighting around Friedland, and the 1104th Rifle and 896th Artillery Regiments received the Order of Kutuzov, 3rd degree, for the same action. Beginning at noon the next day, following a powerful artillery preparation, the 3rd Belorussian Front, including the 331st, began its assault on the fortifications of K√∂nigsberg. By the end of the first day, the outer line of defenses had been penetrated, and 102 city blocks had been cleared, and on April 12, the garrison surrendered. Meanwhile, during all the fighting in East Prussia, the division had not been receiving any replacements, so by this time was operating with a far fewer troops than officially authorized, with \\"regiments\\" of about 400 infantry, backed by mortars, the artillery regiment, and air support. Upon finally reaching the Baltic several days later, thousands of German soldiers surrendered to just dozens of men of the 331st.Gorbachevsky, pp. 377‚Äì78, 381‚Äì85 In late April, the division loaded onto troop trains for a trip to the Sudetenland of Czechoslovakia along with the rest of the 31st Army, which was transferring to the 1st Ukrainian Front for the final push to Prague. It disembarked in Saxony on the night of May 6. The army's role was as a flank guard on the left of the 1st Ukrainian Front, protecting the northern prong of the attack on the Czech capital. Advancing against little organized resistance, the 331st was on the outskirts of the town of Schlewitz when it got word of the German surrender.Gorbachevsky, pp. 386‚Äì89 When the shooting stopped, the men and women of the division had earned the title of the 331st Rifle, Proletarian, Bryansk-Smolensk, twice Order of the Red Banner, Order of Suvorov Division.

During this period, smallpox became the first infectious disease of humans to be eradicated globally. For this work, he and his colleagues were awarded the Japan Prize in 1988. He also advised the successful programme to eradicate poliovirus from the Western Pacific region. Education and early career Arita was born in Kumamoto, southern Japan, in 1926. After gaining his medical degree from Kumamoto Medical School in 1950, he spent a decade working for the Japanese Ministry of Health and Welfare as a medical officer in the Infectious Disease Control section.Fenner 2006, p. 144 For part of this time he worked on vaccine control and standardisation, an area in which he received training at the Paul Ehrlich Institute in Germany. Smallpox eradication programme Arita's work for the WHO smallpox eradication programme started in 1962. He spent around 2 years working on eradication in Liberia, Africa. When American epidemiologist Donald A. Henderson joined the programme in 1966, Arita was the only remaining WHO technical staff member.Tucker 2001, pp. 61, 115 He was a part of the WHO Smallpox Eradication Unit from its inception in 1966, serving as its deputy director under Henderson's leadership. He was responsible for developing the programme's \\"surveillance and containment\\" strategy (which replaced the unsuccessful strategy of attempting to vaccinate at least 80% of the population), as well as for increasing the supply of smallpox vaccine used by the eradication programme, and for monitoring and improving vaccine quality.White et al. 2013, p. 43 He also undertook research into poxviruses, particularly monkeypox virus. After Henderson left WHO in 1976 or 1977, Arita went on to direct the unit. Under his leadership an outbreak of variola minor in the Horn of Africa during the Ethiopian‚ÄìSomali war was successfully contained, and the final case of naturally transmitted smallpox occurred in October 1977. He administered the process by which smallpox was formally certified by WHO as having been eradicated globally in May 1980.Fenner 2006, pp. 144, 152‚Äì56 After certification, he managed the implementation of the certifying commission's recommendations. He continued to direct the unit's international surveillance activities. He was also involved in formulating policies on issues including ongoing vaccination and laboratory stocks of variola virus, and in archiving WHO's data on the eradication programme.Fenner 2006, pp. 160‚Äì64 In 1999, he was one of several scientists to argue for the destruction of the remaining stocks of variola virus. He was one of the lead authors, with Frank Fenner and Henderson, of the WHO publication Smallpox and its Eradication, an exhaustive 1460-page volume which was published in January 1988.Fenner 2006, pp. 164‚Äì66, 168 Arita also wrote his own personal account in the 2010 book, The Smallpox Eradication Saga. An Insider's View. Later career In 1985, Arita left WHO to direct the Kumamoto National Hospital in Japan, a position he retained until his retirement in 1992. He advised Morihiro Hosokawa (then governor of the Kumamoto prefecture) on the foundation of the Agency for Cooperation in International Health (ACIH) in 1990, and became its chair in 1993.Fenner 2006, p. 179 The ACIH's aim is to promote disease prevention in developing countries, and the body has organised international conferences on vaccines and other topics. In the early 1990s, Arita called international attention to the issues surrounding the supply of vaccines and vaccine quality in developing countries, and advocated for these countries to move towards being self-sufficient in vaccine production.Muraskin 1998, pp. 95‚Äì97, 103, 121 From 1990 until 2004, he chaired the Technical Advisory Group to WHO's Expanded Programme on Immunization and Poliomyelitis Eradication in the Western Pacific Region. The programme was successful in eradicating wild poliovirus from this region in 1997. He also served on the expert committee that certified the eradication of wild poliovirus from North and South America in 1997. Despite these regional successes, the global eradication of polio ‚Äì planned for 2000 ‚Äì has yet to be achieved. In 2006, with Fenner and Miyuki Nakane, Arita published an opinion piece in the journal Science that questioned whether it was feasible to eradicate polio globally, and suggested that control might be a preferable option. He has also published on severe acute respiratory syndrome, measles, hepatitis B, hepatitis C and other viral diseases.PubMed search conducted on 23 August 2016 Awards and honours In 1988, Arita, together with Henderson and Fenner, was awarded the Japan Prize ‚Äì considered the Japanese equivalent of the Nobel PrizeMuraskin 1998, p. 94 ‚Äì for his work on smallpox eradication.

They put together 100 Proof as a funk and soul act for their new label.

Details Written by General Johnson (lead singer of Chairmen Of The Board), Angelo Bond, and Greg Perry (who also acted as producer), the song depicts a cheated lover discovering evidence of his woman's infidelity, quoting liberally from the folk tale \\"Goldilocks and the Three Bears\\". Released as 100 Proof's second single, it became a Top Ten hit on the US pop chart, reaching #8 in 1970, and performed even better on the R&B; chart, making it to #6.

Form 1099-K is sent out to payees by a payment settlement entity (such as a bank) if there are more than 200 such transactions and the gross payments exceed $20,000. Reportable payment card transactions do not include ATM withdrawals or checks issued in connection with a payment card. Examples of individuals who would receive Form 1099-K include freelancers compensated via PayPal, Etsy sellers, Uber drivers who accept credit cards as payment, small businesses who accept card transactions as payment, and in general professionals who accept online or credit card payments for services.  Motivation  In 2006 Americans underpaid their taxes by $450 billion, equal to a 17% tax noncompliance rate. In response, the IRS has pushed for more third party information reporting. In the Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008, a new requirement was laid out for banks and credit card merchants to report payments to the IRS. This requirement took effect in 2011, and Form 1099-K was first issued in 2012. It uses third party information reporting (banks and credit card merchants) in order to increase tax compliance and improve IRS tax assessments. The new requirement specifically does much in the way of increasing tax compliance from independent contractors, especially with the increasing size of the so-called \\"1099 economy\\".  Filing  Payment settlement entities must send Form 1099-K to the IRS by the last day of February of the year following the relevant transactions, or if filing electronically, by April 1. Form 1099-K may be filed electronically through the Filing Information Returns Electronically (FIRE) system.https://www.irs.gov/tax-professionals/e-file-providers-partners/filing- information-returns-electronically-fire If a payment settlement entity has more than 250 individual information returns to file in any calendar year, they all must be submitted electronically.  Relation to Form 1099-MISC  Form 1099-MISC is a variant of Form 1099 used to report miscellaneous income. One common use of Form 1099-MISC is to report payments by a business to US resident independent contractors. In this case Form 1099-MISC needs to be issued only when the total amount paid during the tax year is at least $600. However, the instructions for Form 1099-MISC include a provision that says payments made with payment cards and/or third party network transactions must be reported on Form 1099-K by the payment settlement entity, and that the payer does not need to issue a Form 1099-MISC in this case. This provision creates a tax loophole. Before Form 1099-K existed, payment card transactions and/or settlement of third-party payment network transactions totaling at least $600 required the payer to file a Form 1099-MISC. However, with this provision, a party getting paid through payment card and/or third-party payment network transactions, seeking to avoid paying taxes, can simply opt to avoid meeting either or both the 200 transaction and $20,000 minimum threshold needed to file Form 1099-K. Even if a party doesn't seek to avoid paying taxes, if they fail to meet either threshold criteria for filing Form 1099-K, they simply may receive neither a Form 1099-K from the payment settlement entity nor a Form 1099-MISC from the payer. As of 2016 this remains a problem. Even with this provision, many payers still choose to file Form 1099-MISC. This means that if the payee meets the minimum threshold for receiving Form 1099-K, they may actually receive both Form 1099-MISC and Form 1099-K and possibly over-report their payments. In any case, this provision necessitates tracking payments separately. Unlike Form 1099-MISC, Form 1099-K is sent not only to individuals, but also corporations and tax-exempt entities.

It was built in association with the Moltke's Mansion in Bredgade on the other side of the block. History = Danneskiold-Laurvig family= The building seen on an illustration from Lauritz de Thurah's Hafnia Hodierna (1748) Rach & Engborg in 1749 Ferdinand Anton Danneskiold-Laurvig was the son of Ulrik Frederik Gyldenl√∏ve. When his father died in 1704 he inherited Gyldenl√∏ve's Little Mansion at the corner of Dronningens Tv√¶rgade and Bredgade as well as the County of Laurvig in Norway. He purchased a number of smaller lots in Store Kongensgade in the 1720s. It is unclear when the building at Store Kongensgade was built. Most sources state that it was most likely built to a design by 0 ohann Adam Soherr in circa 1745. Ida Haugsted states that it was more likely built in circa 1720-30 to designs by Johan Cornelius Krieger. Krieger was also responsible for adaptingh the Gyldenl√∏be Mansion. A garden connected the two buildings and the new building in Store Kongensgade was referred to as Danneskiold-Laurvig's backyard\\" (Danneskiold-Laurvig's bagg√•rd). The new building was also known as Jernmagasinet (\\"The Iron Store\\") since stoves and other products from Danneskiold-Laurvig's extensive Fritz√∏e iron works in Laurvig in Norway were sold from its ground floor. Frederik Ludvig Danneskiold-Laurvig succeeded his father in 1754. He died without children in 1762 and all his holdings were therefore transferred to his brother Christian Conrad Danneskiold-Laurvig (1723-1783). =Fr√©d√©ric de Coninck and Niels Lunde Reiersen= The building was on 3 April 1783 sold to the merchants Fr√©d√©ric de Coninck and Niels Lunde Reiersen for 46,000 rigsdaler. The building was at the time of the 1787 census home to three households with a total of 17 residents. Bookkeeper Thomas Christopher Radigend (76 y4s.) lived in the apartment in the western part of the ground floor with his second wife Anne (72 yrs.) and his sister's unmarried daughter Dorthea Helena (64 yrs.) as well as two maids. Counter Admiral ndreas Georg Herman Schultz (1718-1798) and his wife Anne Margrethe True (1737-1825) lived in the apartment on the first floor. The other members of their household were the 18-year-old girl Charlotte Lindemann (1767-1837) two maids and a servant. The 40-year-old clerk J√∏rn B√∏ttger and his 28-year-old wife Christiane lived with their three children as well as their 27-year-old maid and the property's caretaker Lars Larsen in the apartment on the second floor. =Later owners= Reiersen sold his share of the building complex in Bredgade-Store Kongensgade to Fr√©d√©ric de Coninck in 1789. Later that same year Fr√©d√©ric de Coninck sold the Danneskiold-Laurvig Mansion to wine merchant Johan Ludwig Friederich Zinn.

It was the first Chinese dictionary specifically for spoken Chinese words rather than for written Chinese characters, and one of the first to mark characters for being \\"free\\" or \\"bound\\" morphemes according to whether or not they can stand alone as a complete and independent utterance. History The compilers of the Concise Dictionary of Chinese, the linguist Yuen Ren Chao (1892-1982) and the historian Yang Lien-sheng (1914-1990), were famous Chinese-American scholars who worked in Harvard University wartime Chinese language programs for the War Department. Chao was a visiting professor at Harvard from 1941 to 1946, while Yang entered the graduate program in 1940, and received an M.A. in 1942 and Ph.D. in 1946. At the beginning of World War II, the shortage of Chinese and Japanese bilingual dictionaries became an urgent matter for English-speaking Allies. The Harvard‚ÄìYenching Institute said the need for Chinese dictionaries in America had \\"grown from chronic to acute\\", and selected two \\"practical dictionaries\\" to revise and reprint‚Äîwithout either author's permission‚Äîfor \\"the immediate demands of American students\\" (Mathews 1943: v). Both photolithographic reproductions were retitled: The Five Thousand Dictionary (5th ed., 1940) became Fenn's Chinese-English Pocket-Dictionary (1942) and A Chinese-English Dictionary: Compiled for the China Inland Mission by R. H. Mathews (1931) became Mathews' Chinese-English Dictionary (1943). Y. R. Chao contributed to both these reprints. He revised the introduction and wrote the Standards of Pronunciation, Styles of Pronunciation, and Tones sections for Fenn's (1942: xxii-xxiv), and wrote the Introduction on Pronunciation for Mathews' (1943: ix-xvii). Yuen Ren Chao and Lien-sheng Yang divided the lexicographical work. Yang compiled the preliminary list of entries, partially drafted the definitions, served both as informant and as grammarian on Beijing dialect, and wrote the characters. Chao wrote most of the definitions, added pronunciations from regional varieties of Chinese, and wrote the front matter and the appendices (1947: vii). Chao and Yang finished compiling their Concise Dictionary of Spoken Chinese in 1945, the same year when the War Department published the anonymous Dictionary of Spoken Chinese: Chinese-English, English-Chinese. Although the 847-page Dictionary of Spoken Chinese is large, it contains relatively few lexical items, approximately 2,500 English-Chinese head entries in 500 pages and 5,000 Chinese-English ones in 300 pages (1945: 1). The Chinese-English section's head entries are not single characters, as in traditional Chinese dictionaries, but monosyllabic and polysyllabic words, which are alphabetically collated using a newly devised system for romanizing Chinese (which became the prototype for Yale romanization). \\"This represents a radical departure from all earlier Chinese-English dictionaries, which were primarily dictionaries of Chinese characters (h√†nzi) and not of the spoken language as such\\" (Norman 1988: 175). Although the Chinese-English section gives characters for head entries, they are treated as secondary. The Dictionary of Spoken Chinese records authentic colloquial pronunciation, and its chief function is to show a user how to employ the entries in spoken Chinese‚Äîin contrast, the chief function of previous bilingual dictionaries is to enable a user to decode written texts. Most entries provide one or more usage examples from colloquial speech. This dictionary classifies words into twelve complex grammatical categories: adjective (A), demonstrative (Dem), adverb (H), intransitive verb (I), conjunction (J), coverb (K), measure word (M), noun (N), numeral (Num), pronoun (Pron), resultative compound (RC) and transitive verb (V). The Dictionary of Spoken Chinese's English-Chinese section averages around 5 entries per page, compared to around 18 per page in the Chinese-English section. Some English-Chinese entries are quite elaborate, providing multiple Chinese translation equivalents and usage examples illustrating various semantic nuances of the English word. The influence of American structural linguistics, which shifted interest from the written to the spoken language, is evident in both the War Department's Dictionary of Spoken Chinese (1945) and Chao's and Yang's Concise Dictionary of Spoken Chinese (1947). \\"In both dictionaries we can observe the authors attempting not just to provide their Chinese entries with English equivalents but to demonstrate through grammatical categorization and examples how they are actually used\\" (Norman 1988: 175). Although the War Department dictionary was never widely distributed or used, it affected Chao's and Yang's Concise Dictionary of Spoken Chinese, and served as the model for two well-known dictionaries. Yale University's Institute of Far Eastern Languages published a revised edition Dictionary of Spoken Chinese (1966), and Fred Fangyu Wang published a two-volume Mandarin Chinese dictionary, Chinese-English (1967) and English-Chinese (1971). With these dictionaries, \\"American efforts in Chinese lexicography effectively ceased\\" (Norman 1988: 176)‚Äîuntil the ABC Chinese- English Dictionary (1996). . Content The Concise Dictionary of Spoken Chinese comprises approximately 5,000 single-character head entries, collated by radical-and-stroke and numbered according to the 214 Kangxi radicals. The twelve most frequent radicals are given at the bottom of the pages for the dictionary user to memorize. \\"To insure further the finding of the characters, the authors have entered each character under all its apparently possible radicals and made a cross reference to the main entry\\" (1947: xxvi). For instance, È≠Ø luu is entered under radical 72 Êõ∞ \\"sun\\", with the note \\"See Rad. 195 È≠ö [\\"fish\\"].\\" The Concise Dictionary includes the popular and cursive forms of many characters, as well as the Suzhou numerals (e.g., \\"„Ä¢ ell Soochow numeral for '2', used in trade\\"), and the Bopomofo symbols (\\"„Ñé ke National Phonetic letter for the aspirated initial k\\"), which had never been included in a Chinese dictionary, thus removing \\"one source of bewilderment for the foreign student of Chinese\\" (Luo 1947: 434). The Concise Dictionary has \\"many elaborate features to help the user study the refinements of spoken Chinese\\" (Dunn 1977: 78). Chao's introduction lists eight unique features not found in previous comparable Chinese-English dictionaries such as Fenn's and Mathews' (1947: v-vi). (1) The grammatical function of each word is distinguished according to whether it is free (F) or bound (B). With the exception of measure words or Chinese classifiers, called \\"auxiliary nouns\\" (AN), the dictionary generally did not indicate syntactic part of speech, called \\"word classes\\". Chao explains, \\"The same word, as a noun, means one thing; as an auxiliary noun (AN) something else, as a verb something else again. This is not a matter of inference, as those who say that Chinese has no parts of speech assume, but a matter of individual facts.\\" (1947: v). The dictionary's English translation equivalents usually can clarify Chinese part of speech; if ÂêÉ chy [chƒ´] is defined by the English verb \\"to eat\\", then it is itself also a verb. word classes are only specified in cases of ambiguity; ËÑÇËÇ™ jyfang [zhƒ´f√°ng] \\"fat\\" is marked n. \\"noun\\" since English \\"fat\\" can also be an adjective (Norman 1988: 174). The dictionary lists other specialized grammatical categories (1947: xxvii-xxxi), for instance, \\"auxiliary nouns proper\\" and \\"quasi-auxiliary nouns\\", and introduces for the first time in a Chinese dictionary \\"many new ideas about the linguistic structure of Chinese, such as the four types of verbal complements\\": the \\"pre-transitive,\\" \\"verb- object construction\\", \\"possessive object,\\" and \\"impersonal verb-object compound\\"\\" (Luo 1947: 432-433). (2) The stylistic register or usage class of each entry is either marked by an abbreviation (e.g., derog., honorif., poet.) or implied in the translation (as ÊÆÜ \\"well-nigh,\\" but Â∑Æ‰∏çÂ§ö \\"almost\\"), in order to \\"channel the student's efforts in using the language to more profitable directions\\". (3) The Concise Dictionary of Spoken Chinese is the first Chinese dictionary to give detailed descriptions of particles and interjections. For example, ‰∫Ü has three entries: *‰∫Ü leau [li«éo] \\"F [free] to finish, conclude\\" ‚Ä¶ -B [bound chiefly to a preceding word] \\"to a finish\\" ‚Ä¶ BB [the word reduplicated] to understand clearly\\", with 13 usage examples *‰∫Ü .le [neutral tone, pinyin le] \\"-.B [bound, with neutral tone, to a preceding word] final particle to indicate a new situation or a new realization of an existing situation ‚Ä¶ in narration ‚Ä¶ to indicate obviousness\\", with 6 examples *‰∫Ü .le \\"-.B word-particle: to indicate completed action when there is a numeral (or AN taking the place of ‰∏Ä) before the object ‚Ä¶ to indicate condition or time ‚Ä¶ to serve as a second compl. [complement] after a result. compl.\\", with 5 usage examples, and a lengthy note about negative le constructions (1947: 6-7) (4) Dictionary entries give morphological derivations, words created by adding affixes (e.g., ÂÖí erl [r], the \\"syllabic diminutive suffix, frequently used in verse\\") or by reduplication (ÂñÆ dan [dƒÅn] single ‚Ä¶ ÂñÆÂñÆ \\"(this) only, alone; (this) of all things\\"). (5) Entries also give collocative words that are frequently used together (e.g., \\"Ê£ã chyi [q√≠] \\"chess\\" ‚Ä¶ ‰∏ãÊ£ã \\"to play chess or go\\") and common antonyms. This dictionary \\"includes a great number of meanings even of well-known words which so far have not been noted in any other dictionary\\" (Simon 1949: 137). (6) The Gwoyeu Romatzyh \\"National Romanization\\" system, which Y.R. Chao co-created and popularized, is used for pronunciation of main entries, along with usual Wade-Giles orthography given in parentheses. Appendix 1, Part 2, is a table of concordance for these two systems. Tonal spelling of the four tones is the primary advantage of National Romanization, for instance, dau (1st tone), daur (2nd), dao (3rd), and daw (4th tone), corresponding to pinyin dƒÅo, d√°o, d«éo, and d√†o. The neutral tone is indicated by a dot before the atonal syllable. (7) Romanizations incorporate superscripts and other symbols to denote the historical features of Middle Chinese pronunciation and modern pronunciation in varieties of Chinese, often misleadingly called \\"dialects\\". For examples, a subscribed dot under an initial (ÊÅ§ ·π£hiuh [x√π] \\"to pity, to give relief to\\") makes it possible for students interested in Peking opera to distinguish Â∞ñ \\"sharp\\" dental consonants from Âúì \\"rounded\\" palatal consonants, and a superscript p indicates Cantonese has a final -p checked tone and Wu Chinese has a glottal stop (Luo 1947: 433). (8) All entries \\"are treated as morphemes, or monosyllabic meaningful spoken words\\", whether bound morphemes or free morphemes, rather than as characters. Chao gives a chemical analogy to differentiate between z√¨di«én Â≠óÂÖ∏ \\"character dictionaries\\" and c√≠di«én Ëæ≠ÂÖ∏ \\"word dictionaries\\". > In China, dictionaries are divided into Â≠óÂÖ∏ and Ë©ûÂÖ∏, the former giving only > single characters, which may be compared with chemical elements, and the > latter compounds and phrases, like chemical compounds. To pursue the > chemical analogy one step further, compounds are so numerous that they > cannot all be included except in a much more comprehensive work. We can do > more than merely list the elements and their atomic weights. We can classify > their affinities, their electric polarity, indicate whether they can be > ionized, and give such information as to enable us to predict more compounds > than can be listed. Thus by giving the morphemes of the language properly > analyzed, indicating whether they are bound or free, the attempt has been > made to give the equivalent of a dictionary of compounds within the space of > a dictionary of single words.\\" (1947: vi) By treating all entries as bound or free morphemes rather than as characters, Chao and Yang have made an attempt to give the equivalent of a dictionary of compounds within the space of a dictionary of single words (Luo 1947: 433). The dictionary's spine has English \\"Concise Dictionary of Spoken Chinese / Chao and Yang\\" and the front cover has equivalent Chinese \\"ÂúãË™ûÂ≠óÂÖ∏ [Gu√≥y«î z√¨di«én, \\"Standard Chinese Dictionary\\"] / Ë∂ôÂÖÉ‰ªª / Ê•äËÅØÈôû / ÂêàÁ∑®\\" [\\"Zh√†o Yu√°nr√®n, Y√°ng Li√°nshƒìng, co-editors\\"]. The title page has both English \\"Concise Dictionary of Spoken Chinese / By Yuen Ren Chao and Lien Sheng Yang\\" and the same Chinese. The Chinese character ÈÅì (composed of radical 162 Ëæ∂ \\"walk\\" and a sh«íu È¶ñ \\"head\\" phonetic) for d√†o \\"way; path; say; the Dao\\" or d«éo \\"guide; lead; instruct\\" makes a good sample entry for illustrating a dictionary because it has two pronunciations and complex semantics. Chao's and Yang's dictionary entry gives detailed syntactic and pragmatic information, but fails to note the pronunciation d«éo ÈÅì that is a variant Chinese character for d«éo Â∞é (with radical 41 ÂØ∏ \\"thumb\\") \\"to lead, to guide\\", which they do enter (1947: 64). > ÈÅì dÃ†aw. (tao4). B way, reason, principle, Tao ÈÅì.ÁêÜ96; -l a road AN Ê¢ù, ÂÄã; AN a > course (of food); -l, tz a streak AN a streak -l; F to say (introducing a > direct quotation: novel style); B- to say (polite words), as ÈÅìÂñú30 v-o 'to > congratulate,' ÈÅìË¨ù v-o 'to give thanks.' ÊúâÈÅì used at the end of the salutation > in writing to a prominent scholar; Ê≤íÈÅì.ÁêÜ unreasonable; mean; rude. (1947: > 218) First, this ÈÅì entry glosses pronunciation with National Romanization dÃ†aw and Wade-Giles tao4. The underscored dÃ† consonant indicates a voiced initial in Wu and a lower register tone in Cantonese. Second, it gives English translation equivalents for the bound word (B) d√†oli ÈÅìÁêÜ, with the dot before ÁêÜ denoting neutral tone li, and the subscript 96 meaning radical 96 Áéâ \\"jade\\" where a dictionary user can find the character ÁêÜ lii listed under 96.7, with 7 being the number of strokes in the l«ê Èáå phonetic. Third, it gives the colloquial term d√†or ÈÅìÂÖí \\"road\\" with -l indicating the word plus the diminutive retroflex suffix -r ÂÖí, counted with ti√°o Ê¢ù \\"measure word for long, narrow things\\" (AN abbreviates \\"auxiliary noun\\"). Fourth, the entry notes that ÈÅì itself is used as a measure word for courses during a meal. Fifth, d√†or ÈÅìÂÖí or d√†ozi ÈÅìÂ≠ê (tz denotes the noun suffix Â≠ê) can mean \\"streak\\", counted with ti√°o Ê¢ù or ge ÂÄã \\"general measure word\\". Sixth, d√†or ÈÅìÂÖí can also be used as a measure word for streaks. Seventh, the free word (F) d√†o ÈÅì dao means \\"to say\\". Eighth, it also means \\"to say (polite words)\\" in bound terms such as d√†ox«ê ÈÅìÂñú (subscript 30 denotes radical 30 Âè£ \\"mouth\\"), d√†oxi√® ÈÅìË¨ù, and y«íud√†o ÊúâÈÅì. Ninth, the entry gives the bound word m√©i d√†oli Ê≤íÈÅìÁêÜ. Chao's and Yang's brief ÈÅì entry is packed with linguistic information for users. Reception Most reviewers have praised the Concise Dictionary of Spoken Chinese, while some have been critical. The co-author Lien-Sheng Yang responded to DeFrancis' and Simon's reviews in a 1949 article about free and bound morphemes in Chinese. The Chinese linguist Luo Changpei (1947: 432) describes the dictionary as \\"unprecedented in the history of Chinese-European lexicography since its beginnings\\" in the early 17th century. Luo lists three unique features of the dictionary, combining six of the eight given by Chao (above); the first combines (1) and (3), the second (2), (7), (8), and the third is (6). Luo (1947: 435-436) lists 15 corrections or suggestions, 9 of which are included in later editions of the dictionary, under Corrections and Additions (1957: x) The American linguist and lexicographer John DeFrancis described the Concise Dictionary as \\"a landmark notable for its presentation of a great deal of extremely valuable information‚Äîgrammatical, phonetic, dialectical, and otherwise\\" (1948: 447). DeFrancis suggests that Chao and Yang have been \\"unduly influenced by the ideographs and the myths of Chinese monosyllabism\\" (1948: 447). Although the dictionary title has \\"Spoken Chinese\\", the authors approach the subject through characters rather than through speech. Using data from a 10-page sample, DeFrancis disproves Chao's contention that with \\"very few exceptions\\" Chinese morphemes are \\"for the most part monosyllabic\\" (1947: vi). The sample dictionary entries marked as \\"literary\\" (L), \\"comparable to yclept in English and hence not really belonging in a dictionary of spoken Chinese\\", amount to 16% of the total entries. (Yclept is an archaic or humorous word meaning \\"called; named\\". > Of the entries which really represent spoken forms, no more than 29 per cent > have been classified by the authors as Free, the only category which is > generally accepted as designating a word in English and other languages. But > not all the remaining 71 per cent are classified as Bound forms of the type > er in banker or sender. Only 49 per cent are of this type of meaningful > syllables without independent life. The remaining 22 per cent, represented > by shan and hu in shanhu, \\"coral,\\" are of a type which have no more meaning > or independence than do cor and al in the English equivalent. (1948: 448) DeFrancis proposes that the category of Bound syllables (not \\"words\\") should be divided into two groups: \\"meaningless bound syllables\\" (like shan and hu in shanhu ÁèäÁëö \\"coral\\") and \\"meaningful bound syllables\\" (like fu \\"father\\" and mu \\"mother\\" in fumu Áà∂ÊØç \\"parents\\"). \\"The former are fully bound (occurring in only one word), and the latter are semibound (occurring in more than one word).\\" DeFrancis concludes that the contributions of scholars like Dr. Chao, \\"give hope that lexicographers, if they can concentrate on Chinese speech and not be misled by the ideographic writing, will eventually succeed in compiling a real dictionary of the Chinese spoken language.\\" (1948: 448). In response to DeFrancis' review, Lien-sheng Yang states that comparing the dictionary entries designated as literary to yclept in English is \\"misleading, because the latter is an archaic word, whereas the former are still used in modern Spoken Chinese\\" (1949: 463). Yang says DeFrancis' suggestion of differentiating \\"meaningless bound syllables\\" and \\"meaningful bound syllables\\" appears interesting but unfortunately it involves three difficulties. First, since the word meaning is ambiguous, a linguist has to define \\"meaningful\\" and \\"meaningless\\" and ascertain whether all native-speaker informants agree. Second, a linguist needs to consider differences in the informants' background and education, \\"One syllable which is meaningful to one may be meaningless to another\\" (1949: 463). Third, the identification of meaningful and meaningless syllables with those occurring in more than one word and those occurring in only one \\"is doubtful\\". Taking the example of shan and hu in shanhu \\"coral\\", Yang notes both characters are used in other compounds, namely, shanshan ÁèäÁèä \\"tinkling sound (of ornaments)\\" and hulian ÁëöÁíâ \\"two types of ritual vessels\\" (1949: 464). The German sinologist Walter Simon says the Concise Dictionary of Spoken Chinese is a \\"definite advance on our knowledge of the Chinese language\\" and calls it a \\"very important lexicographical contribution\\" from which \\"students cannot fail to derive great benefit\\" (1949: 137). Simon says > [O]ne can readily see that a dictionary which notes the alternatives \\"free\\" > or \\"bound\\" in the case of each single character, is a mine of information > which may lend itself to very important subsequent research. Questions like > the following come to the mind at once. \\"How many of the characters included > in the dictionary occur only 'free' or only 'bound', how many occur with the > suffix ‚Äìtz or ‚Äìl, what is the distribution if we proceed to grouping words > according to their meanings (e.g., parts of the body)? Are practically all > verbs free and all nouns 'bound', etc., etc.?\\" (1949: 137) Quoting this remark, Yang says, \\"These are good questions. The last one is particularly suggestive, because it leads to the question whether there are free and bound parts of speech.\\" (1949: 465). Yu-Ju Chih, a teacher and developer of Chinese language textbooks, says that unlike almost all the commonly used Chinese-English dictionaries that are geared primarily to reading Chinese texts, the Concise Dictionary of Spoken Chinese is the \\"only one of its kind available to the public\\" (1967: 108).

While White individuals were also lynched, this memorial is intended to focus on and acknowledge past racial terrorism and advocate for social justice in America. Founded by the non-profit Equal Justice Initiative, it opened in downtown Montgomery, Alabama on April 26, 2018. Background The memorial was built on six acres in the downtown area of the state capital by the Equal Justice Initiative (EJI), a non-profit based in Montgomery. The related Legacy Museum: From Enslavement to Mass Incarceration opened the same day. The complex was built near the former market site in Montgomery where enslaved African Americans were sold. The development and construction of the memorial complex cost an estimated $20 million, raised from private foundations. Bryan Stevenson, founder of the EJI, was inspired by the examples of the Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe in Berlin, Germany, and the Apartheid Museum in Johannesburg, South Africa, to create a single memorial to victims of white supremacy in the United States. By studying records in counties across the United States, researchers documented almost 4400 \\"racial terror lynchings\\" in the post-Reconstruction era between 1877 and 1950. Most took place in the decades just before and after the turn of the 20th century. An error at the memorial in the name of a victim from Duluth, Minnesota, was quickly corrected. Description In the central position is the memorial square with 805 hanging steel rectangles, the size and shape of coffins. These name and represent each of the counties (and their states) where a documented lynching took place in the United States, as compiled in the EJI study, Lynching in America: Confronting the Legacy of Racial Terror (2017, 3rd edition). Each of the steel plates also has the names of the documented lynching victims (or \\"unknown\\" if the name is not known). The names and dates of documented victims are engraved on the panels. More than 4075 documented lynchings of African Americans took place between 1877 and 1950, concentrated in 12 Southern states. In addition, the EJI has published supplementary information about lynchings in several states outside the South. The monument is the first major work in the nation to name and honor these victims. The central memorial was designed by MASS Design Group with Lam Partners lighting design, and built on land purchased by EJI. Hank Willis Thomas's sculpture, Rise Up, features a wall, from which emerge statues of black heads and bodies raising their arms in surrender to the viewer. The piece suggests visibility, which is one of the intentions of the monument. The viewer is asked to focus and see the subject of the artwork. This is a more current piece commenting on the police violence and police brutality prevalent in the years preceding the memorial. Thomas has said about his artwork, \\"I see the work that I make as asking questions.\\" In the landscaped area outside the monument are benches where visitors can sit to reflect. These are dedicated to commemorating such activists as journalist Ida B. Wells, who in the 1890s risked her life to report that lynchings were more about economic competition of blacks and whites, than actual assaults by blacks of whites. Laid in rows on the ground are steel columns corresponding to those hanging in the Memorial. These columns are intended to be temporary. The Equal Justice Initiative is asking representatives of each of the counties to claim their monument and establish a memorial on home ground to lynching victims, and to conduct related public education. A month after the monument's opening, the Montgomery Advertiser reported that citizens in Montgomery County were considering asking for their column. Both county and the city of Montgomery officials were also discussing this. Importance for Montgomery tourism Prior to the 1990s, there was limited acknowledgement in Montgomery to the painful legacy of slavery and racism, although the city had numerous monuments related to the Confederacy, many erected by private organizations. The city has developed a Civil Rights trail marking such events as the 1965 Selma to Montgomery marches, and also identified buildings and sites associated with slavery, such as the former market site. With the opening of the monument, the city was ranked by the New York Times as its Top 2018 Destination. Lee Sentell of the Alabama Department of Tourism acknowledged that the National Memorial offers a different and painful encounter: \\"Most museums are somewhat objective and benign...This one is not. This is aggressive, political. ... It's a part of American history that has never been addressed as much in your face as this story is being told\\". Mayor Todd Strange suggested that the memorial offered \\"our nation's best chance at reconciliation\\". The opening celebrations, in May 2018, attracted thousands of people to Montgomery, perhaps as many as 10,000. Artists who performed included Stevie Wonder, Patti LaBelle, and Usher; speakers included Congressman and civil rights activist John Lewis from Georgia. The memorial and its attendant museum are expected to generate heightened tourism for Montgomery, even if it is dark tourism. The Atlanta Journal-Constitution noted that, with the addition of the memorial and the museum, Montgomery and Atlanta together provide a narrative of African- American history, as the latter has sites associated with national leader Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr. and local history as well. Tourism officials said that possibly 100,000 extra visitors per year may arrive. The Legacy Museum A collection of soil from lynching sites across the United States on display at The Legacy Museum. Opened on the same date as the outdoor memorial, The Legacy Museum: From Enslavement to Mass Incarceration is a museum that displays and interprets the history of slavery and racism in America. The progress through the museum is chronological, beginning with slavery, and passing through the decades of lynching, extrajudicial violence against blacks, through the Civil Rights era, and dealing with present issues. This includes the enslavement of African-Americans, racial lynchings and disenfranchisement of black voters, segregation and Jim Crow, and racial bias. Artwork in the museum includes a sculpture on slavery by Ghanaian artist Kwame Akoto-Bamfo, at the beginning; a sculpture \\"dedicated to the women who sustained the Montgomery Bus Boycott\\" by Dana King, to help illustrate the Civil Rights period; and a piece about today's police violence and the biased criminal justice system, by Hank Willis Thomas. The museum features artwork by Hank Willis Thomas, Glenn Ligon, Jacob Lawrence, Elizabeth Catlett, Titus Kaphar, and Sanford Biggers. One of its displays is a collection of soil from lynching sites across the United States. This exhibit expresses the vast effects of slavery, lynchings, and black oppression across state lines. The exhibits in the 11,000-square-foot museum include oral history, archival materials, and interactive technology. Publishers of the Montgomery Advertiser reviewed and formally apologized for its historic coverage of lynchings, which was often inflammatory against black victims, describing it as \\"our shame\\" and saying \\"we were wrong\\".

Lathbury worked as an overseer at British Drug Houses where she was responsible for supervising the manufacture of insulin to make sure it was effective. After her retirement she took up painting and was exhibited in the Royal Academy. She was still driving at the age of 90. She had three sisters, Norah (later Nicholls), Rosalind (later Lady Padmore), Christine and two brothers, Robert (who died in his teens), and Michael who all had equally remarkable lives  Early life  Kathleen Culhane was born January 14, 1900. She was the second to last child born in her family. Her mother died when she was young, and her father, a medical doctor, raised her. Culhane attended Hastings and St. Leonards College, then Hastings School of Science. Afterwards, she attended Royal Holloway College from 1918‚Äì1922, where she found her interest in chemistry and graduated with an honors degree in chemistry.  Career  After graduating, she was interested in entering the chemical field, but was met with complications. Employers were not interested in hiring a woman in a chemist position. Kathleen Culhane would sign her applications with \\"K. Culhane\\" instead of \\"Kathleen Culhane\\" in order to improve her chances, but once the interviewers discovered her gender, she did not obtain any job. She worked as a school teacher and a private tutor to provide for herself. Culhane joined the Institute of Chemistry, where she worked in her free time for no money. She performed emergency sugar determinations and met John R. Marrack of Hale Clinical Laboratory of the London Hospital while there. After two years of teaching and her unpaid work, she obtained an industrial chemistry position with Neocellon, Wandsworth, a manufacturer of lacquers and enamels. The company hired her because they could not afford a male chemist's salary. Culhane would receive a job offer from Dr. Marrack at the Hale Clinical Laboratory with a paid position as a chemical adviser and insulin tester. Again through Marrack, she was offered a position as to oversee the manufacture and test the effectiveness of insulin in the physiology department of British Drug Houses. Due to the lunch room being male-only, she would eat with the women cleaners and clerks. In 1928, Kathleen Culhane joined the League of Nations Health Organization Committee to compare the physiological activity of amorphous and crystalline insulin. The results she obtained were different from the other participants prompting the Committee to conclude her research was incorrect insisting that she remove them. Culhane did not, and her research was later proven to be more accurate. In 1933, she started a study on vitamins and published research on it as well as married Major G. P. Lathbury. Contrary to the British Civil Service bar on marriage in 1918, Culhane was still employed even after her marriage due to the directors viewing her work as important. However, she would resign her position as senior chemist in 1935 due to pregnancy and her male replacement received a higher salary than that she had earned at the end of her career. Once World War II commenced, Kathleen Culhane Lathbury offered her assistance to the war effort in 1939. She was first assigned to the position of an assistant wages clerk, but eventually, was appointed manager of a statistical quality control department at a Royal Ordnance Factory. After the war ended, she retired from science at Grayshott in Hampshire and started a second career as a botanical artist. She also painted many portraits. She became a member of the Haslemere and Farnham Art Society having some art included in professional exhibits. She died May 9, 1993. Family Kathleen was the daughter of Dr Frederick William Slater Culhane MRCS (1855‚Äì1920), for many years resident surgeon at the Hastings' Work House, and his wife Mary Lucie 'Minnie' n√©e Dann (1861‚Äì1911). In 1933 Kathleen married Major George Pinckard Lathbury (1883‚Äì1957) of the Royal Marines. They had a daughter Rosalind Mary Culhane Lathbury (1936‚Äì1996).

He was home schooled and attended public school until he enrolled in Marion Military Institute in 1905 until 1907. Afterwards he attended the University of Virginia, graduating in 1912. He worked as a principal of a high school in Chilhowie, Virginia from 1912‚Äì1913. =Diplomatic career= Waller was appointed American vice-consul in Yarmouth, Nova Scotia on 13 February 1913. From there he was appointed vice-consul in Karlsbad, Bohemia in July 1914. Waller quickly requested a transfer after Austria‚ÄìHungary entered World War I. Finding himself unable to remain neutral and yet express the sympathy necessary for a wartime post, Waller hoped to be sent to a post \\"in an English‚Äìspeaking country outside of Canada.\\" He wrote to his superiors that \\"On the other hand, by heredity, environment and ways of thought, my sympathies are, in the larger sense, fully with the Anglo Saxons and in a time like the present I am quite sure that I should be of vastly greater service among such a people.\\" The State Department considered the request for several months, until the transfer was finally approved by Secretary of State Robert Lansing. The decision was urged by Consul Wallace J. Young and Ambassador Frederic Courtland Penfield, the latter considering Waller's attitude \\"seriously embarrassing.\\" Waller was subsequently moved and served as senior vice-consul in Athens, Greece from 1915‚Äì1919. Waller acted as vice-consul in- charge in Athens from October 1916 to May 1917 while Greece was embroiled in conflict. On 4 December 1919, he was made Knight of the Order of the Redeemer by Alexander of Greece and the Greek government. He later served as consul in Dresden, Germany.

Their record \\"Shame\\" became a hit in Milton, Pennsylvania and received airplay in Michigan. In the intervening years the Kings Ransom's music has come to the attention of garage rock enthusiasts with the release of several of their songs on compilations such as Allentown Anglophile and Teenage Shutdown! Teen Jangler Blowout! History Kings Ransom were founded in 1965 in Allentown, Pennsylvania. \\\\- NOTE: The decision has been made to characterize the band's name without an apostrophe (i.e. \\"Kings...\\"). Though AllMusic review presents their name with an apostrophe (\\"King's...\\"), it does not appear that way in most sources. Furthermore, it was printed without the apostrophe on their two Inegra singles. The original lineup consisted of Bob Dougherty on lead vocals, Vince Homick on rhythm guitar, Bob Werley on lead guitar, Scobie King on bass, Ronnie Galland on keyboards, and Danny Roth on drums. Glenn Zoski later replaced King on bass and Chuck Hoey replaced Roth on drums. Mike Homick, was the band's manager. The band was highly influenced by acts of the British Invasion such as the Beatles and the Rolling Stones. According to Bob Dougherty, \\"We were big on The Stones. That was our forte - doing a lot of Stones. People thought we did them really well. Werley did that on a 12-string through a Vox Super Beatle with a lot of mid-range. He was quite innovative at times.\\" The Kings Ransom often played on the same bills as other Allentown groups such as the Hickeys, the Combenashuns at venues including the King's Court and the Lord's Estate. The scene was competitive. Dougherty elaborates: \\"There were two stages at The Court. If there was another band across from you that was real good, it gave you the drive to be a little bit better. Joey Coloruso used to play down there with Quenn's Way Mersey\\". The King's Ransom also played numerous college fraternity gigs in nearby towns such in Drexel, Lafayette, Lehigh, and Bucknell. Dougherty has mentioned the band's rendition of Chris Kenner's \\"Land of 1000 Dances\\" as a highlight of their live shows. They were regular fixtures at the Purple Owl and the King's Court, and played occasionally at the Mod Mill, sometimes on the bill with Jerry Deane, and at the Mad Hatter, a club which specialized in soul music. In 1966, the group taped a batch of demo recordings recorded by Pete Helfrich on location at a Greek Orthodox Church. Mike Homick arranged for some of the songs to be pressed on a 12-inch record at Allentown Records. Dougherty remembers, \\"That was before anything. That was never labeled. We sent some copies of that to record companies in New York and got some nice rejection letters. Nobody's ever heard that except people that knew us then. I don't even have a copy of that, but I'd like to\\". The band went to Frank Virtue Studio to cut their first official release on Integra Records, which was owned by radio disc jockeys Joe Mclaine (still on the air locally) and Bob Kratz. The resulting single's A-side, \\"Shame\\", featured arpeggiated 12-string guitar riffs played in odd scales and was backed with \\"Here Today Gone Tomorrow\\". The session proceeded rapidly. According to Dougherty: \\"We were there 'til about four o'clock in the morning! We started about nine o'clock at night - or eight thirty - and were done by four o'clock in the morning\\". The record was released in July 1967. \\"Shame\\" became a hit in Milton, Pennsylvania and received airplay in Michigan, but the record company did not have the means to distribute it nationally, except in certain regions. The group followed it up with \\"Shadows of Dawn\\" b/w \\"Streetcar\\" in November 1967. The Kings Ransom toured regionally, such as in Milton and Sunbury and played at the Four Seasons, a popular venue in the area. They did a show at Agricultural Hall (\\"Ag. Hall\\") in Allentown. The group continued playing for another year, but in June 1968 disbanded. Dougherty left to join the Navy, where he served until 1971. Mike Homick formed another band using the name, the Kings Ransom, but that consisted of completely different members. In the intervening years the Kings Ransom's music has come to the attention of garage rock enthusiasts. Four of their songs appear on the Allentown Anglophile compilation released by the Philadelphia-based Distortion Records in 2005. Their song \\"Shame\\" is included on Teenage Shutdown! Teen Jangler Blowout!. Their complete body of work, including some of the unreleased demos recorded by Pete Helfrich, was issued on the self-titled The Kings Ransom anthology.

In 2017, Vice.com produced Age of Consent, a full-length documentary film following Toronto resident Justin Payne, an independent Creep Catcher unaffiliated with other groups of the movement. In posing as underage children to lure and then confront online predators, the modus operandi of the movement bears similarities to Dateline NBC's To Catch a Predator series, but police are not present for the confrontations, which typically happen in public. History In July 2014, Justin Payne began publicly exposing adults who thought they were meeting minors willing to engage in sex, operating in Mississauga, Ontario. Dawson Raymond said he felt inspired to do the same in his city of Calgary, Alberta, naming his group \\"Creep Catchers.\\" Raymond and his partner, Slammington, say they will stop at nothing to keep the children safe when using the Internet.\\"Dawson Raymond poses as young girl on the Internet to lure and confront alleged pedophiles\\", by Michael Platt, Calgary Sun As of January 5, 2017, more than 30 Creep Catchers groups have been reported to be operating. Jonathan Woodward of CTV's W5 documented an investigation into Creep Catchers around the country, featuring Justin Payne, Creep Catchers founder Dawson Raymond, Ryan LaForge of Surrey Creep Catchers and Karl Young (aka Carl Murphy) of the Red Deer Creep Catchers. The documentary focused on the unseen side of Creep Catcher members and operations, including the criminal pasts of some members and questioning the possible financial gains of the various \\"chapters\\". The documentary also featured an interview with Edmonton Police Service ICE Detective Dave Dubnick, who tells the story of how a Creep Catchers group in Lloydminster, Alberta, interfered with an ongoing investigation of a child predator, leading to the man escaping surveillance and, months later, being arrested in Manitoba for molesting a toddler and a baby. Notable confrontations In June 2016, Penticton Creep Catchers, Mitch Shelswell and Tyler Fritsen, confronted a man who apparently intended to meet a 14-year-old girl. Shelswell told CTV News they had no plans to stop: \\"As long as we follow the rules given to us by Creep Catchers originally, we're doing everything legally.\\" On August 15, 2016, Surrey Creep Catchers confronted a Coast Mountain Bus Company employee with evidence that he tried to meet a 14-year-old boy at the Central City Shopping Centre. The man drove off, first striking a parked truck and almost hitting Ryan LaForge, who filmed the encounter. The Surrey RCMP closed its case without charges, and the man's employer began an internal investigation. In August 2016, a University of British Columbia Student Housing and Hospitality employee, whom court records suggest was charged with four counts of luring a child under 14 in 2008, apologized profusely and tearfully when confronted by Surrey Creep Catchers about trying to meet a 15-year-old girl and sending her (actually LaForge) pictures of his penis. On September 7, 2016, Surrey Creep Catchers caught an off-duty Surrey RCMP officer who allegedly tried to meet a 14-year-old girl at the Central City Shopping Centre. On September 16, the RCMP announced Constable Dario Devic was charged with communicating with a person under the age of 16 for the purposes of sexual interference or sexual touching, and breach of trust. He was released on bail with orders to avoid children or places children gather. On October 21, 2016, Fraser Valley Creep Catchers released a video allegedly showing Windebank Elementary School Principal Jason Obert at a mall believing he would meet up with a 14-year-old girl for sex. On April 3, 2017, Surrey Creep Catchers confronted a Langley Official named Bob Andrews, trying to meetup with a 13-year-old girl for sex. Responses Some commentators, like John Gormley of Saskatoon's The StarPhoenix, opined that Creep Catchers, while meaning well, create danger for themselves and their suspects, jeopardize official investigations and undermine the rule of law. Other newspapers, like The Now, claim their chapters have public support and encourage police to work with them for their ability to weed out suspects.OUR VIEW: Surrey's Creep Catcher has struck a chord with community\\", from The Now In 2016, a social media commentator, Sean Smith, criticized the Creep Catchers movement. He was then called a pedophile by Ryan Laforge, of the Creep Catchers of Surrey, British Columbia. In March, 2017, Smith sued Laforge for defamation. It represented the second such lawsuit against Laforge. Jason Proctor of CBC News reports that this trend of online pedophile hunters though not new, has been encouraged through success early on, and discouraged by \\"A chorus of police chiefs\\", citing an article by Chad Pawson of the CBC. Jon Woodward of CTV's W5 documented his investigation of Creep Catchers, across Canada, looking into the unseen side of the organization. The 3-part episode aired February 18, 2017 and featured Justin Payne, Creep Catchers founder Dawson Raymond, Surrey Creep Catchers President Ryan LaForge and Red Deer Creep Catchers President Karl Young (aka Carl Murphy). The episode explored the criminal records of some Creep Catchers members, looked at the possible unreported revenue generation and interviewed an Edmonton Police Service member of the Integrated Child Exploitation ICE team, regarding the Lloydminster chapters' interference with one of their investigations. The Creep Catchers movement was strongly criticized in 2017 after it was revealed that one of its targets was a developmentally delayed and mentally challenged 21-year-old, Jaxson Jacoe. The CBC reported that Jacoe joined a dating site after deciding he was ready for his first girlfriend. A Creep Catcher posed as a 19-year-old, engaging Jacoe in chat. In subsequent conversation, the fictitious female said she was actually 14. Jacoe invited the fictitious girl to see where he worked (a hockey rink, where he worked as a score keeper). There were no reports of sexual content in their chats. Douglas Perry of White Rock Creep Catchers and Cody Hunter of Langley Creep Busters confronted Jacoe in front of the rink. Public Safety Minister and Solicitor General Mike Morris referred to the Creep Catchers behavior as \\"vigilanteism\\" and \\"reprehensible.\\" Jaxson Jacoe's father, Pat is joining a complaint to the Information and Privacy Commissioner Office on behalf of his son, who was reportedly highly traumatized by the incident.

Historical usage Originally, the Bora surname was used as a military position/title in the Chutia Kingdom held by individuals from the Buruk clan.Dr. Swarnalata Baruah(2004), Chutiya Jaatir Buranji, Page 145, Surnames like Bora, Saikia, Kataki, Tamuli,etc. were found in Chutia kingdom. It is clearly stated in the Deodhai Buranji that when Ahom king Suhungmung attacked the Chutia kingdom on the banks of Dihing river, the Chutia army was led by one Manik Chandra Baruah. The surname \\"Neog\\" was probably derived from the Chutia \\"Nayak\\" whose duty was the same. Deori folklores also mention the myths behind the creation of each of these titles. For instance, \\"Bora\\" was said to be derived from the \\"Buruk\\" clan and acted either as a military official or a temple guard... Some examples from history are Dhela Bora and Harisingh Bora who were Chutia officials.Dr. Swarnalata Baruah(2004), Chutiya Jaatir Buranji, Page 129, The Chutia army was led by Borhuloi Borua and Dhela Bora. Later, after the introduction of the Paik system in the Ahom Kingdom of medieval Assam, the title was re-introduced. A 'Bora was the commanding officer of 20 such paiks. The appointment of a Bora was the responsibility of his Phukan (commander of 6000 paiks) or Rajkhowa (governor of a territory who could command 2000 to 3000 paiks). The paiks had the right to reject a Bora and request another officer of their choice. Appointments were made irrespective of the paik's religion or ethnicity.Paik System of Ahom kingdom Contemporary usage Over the years, the usage of this title has ceased to be a professional or military title. The surname is now common to Hindus in Assam. Among the Hindus, the surname is mostly written by Indigenous Assamese people which include Chutia, Kalita, Koch and Kachari groups. Notable people Notable people with the surname include: * Dhrubajyoti Bora (born 1955), Indian novelist from Assam * Jatin Bora (born 1970), Indian film actor from Assam * Kopil Bora, Indian film actor from Assam * Mahim Bora (1924‚Äì2019), Indian writer and educationist from Assam * Nomal Chandra Borah, Indian neurologist from Assam * Panchi Bora, Indian television actress and model from Assam * Prodyut Bora (born 1974), Indian politician and social activist from Assam * Ripun Bora, Indian politician from Assam * Umananda Bora, Indian Indian cricket player from Assam See also *Yoon Bo-ra, a South Korean idol singer *Bora (disambiguation) References  External links  Assamese-language surnames ","title":"Bora (surname)"},{"id":"51397508","text":"Publications by or about George Winterton, Australian legal scholar.

He later graduated from the medical faculty of Bucharest University. CrƒÉsescu took part in anarchist and narodnik circles inspired by Mikhail Bakunin. In response, he was exiled to Switzerland in 1872, and then traveled to the United States. After returning to Russia, CrƒÉsescu was among the founders of a narodnik circle in his native city. Arrested in 1879, he disappeared, probably during the judicial inquiry, settling in the Romanian Old Kingdom. He was among the founding members of the Prutul Society, as was Nicolae Zubcu-Codreanu. As a writer, he entered the group surrounding Contemporanul magazine, where his first published work appeared; this was the 1883 sketch Legea lui Lynch. He sometimes used the pen name »òtefan BƒÉssƒÉrƒÉbeanu. In 1891, he became director of Amicul copiilor, rising to editor in his final year there, 1895.

Taken at Parliament House, Canberra. On 13 February 2008, the Parliament of Australia issued a formal apology to Indigenous Australians for forced removals of Australian Indigenous children (often referred to as the Stolen Generations) from their families by Australian federal and state government agencies. The apology was delivered by Prime Minister Kevin Rudd. Stances on the proposed apology For more than a decade since the Bringing Them Home report was submitted to Liberal Prime Minister John Howard, he and his coalition colleagues consistently rejected calls for a formal government apology, though some coalition government members stated that they were personally sorry for the outcomes of the policy. They were concerned that a formal apology could be construed as an admission of deliberate wrongdoing, rather than acknowledging that the originally stated intentions of the government were believed to be in the interests of the children and their futures. Howard and his supporters were concerned that such an apology would suggest that the government would be admitting liability in any duty-care legal proceedings. After the 2007 federal election the newly installed Labor Prime Minister Kevin Rudd announced on 11 December 2007 that the government would make an apology to Indigenous Australians, the wording of which would be decided in consultation with Aboriginal leaders. The Liberal Party opposition was split on the issue. Its leader Brendan Nelson initially said that an apology would risk encouraging a \\"culture of guilt\\" in Australia. However, support for an apology was expressed by other senior Liberals, such as Malcolm Turnbull, Peter Costello, Bill Heffernan, and former Liberal Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser. Former Liberal minister Judi Moylan said: \\"I think as a nation we owe an apology. We shouldn't be thinking about it as an individual apology ‚Äî it's an apology that is coming from the nation state because it was governments that did these things.\\"Schubert, Misha (30 January 2008), \\"Liberal division grows on apology\\", The Age. Nelson later said that he supported the government apology. Following a party meeting, the Liberal Party as a whole expressed its support for an apology, and it achieved bipartisan consensus. Nelson stated: \\"I, on behalf of the Coalition, of the alternative government of Australia, are providing in-principle support for the offer of an apology to the forcibly removed generations of Aboriginal children.\\" Lyn Austin, chairwoman of Stolen Generations Victoria, expressed why she believed an apology was necessary, recounting her experiences as a stolen child: > I thought I was being taken just for a few days. I can recall seeing my > mother standing on the side of the road with her head in her hands, crying, > and me in the black FJ Holden wondering why she was so upset. A few hundred > words can't fix this all but it's an important start and it's a > beginning[...] I see myself as that little girl, crying myself to sleep at > night, crying and wishing I could go home to my family. Everything's gone, > the loss of your culture, the loss of your family, all these things have a > big impact.Cooke, Dewi (1 February 2008), \\"'Sorry' statement should > acknowledge cultural loss, says state leader\\", The Age. Apology text At 9:30am on 13 February 2008, Rudd presented the apology to Indigenous Australians as a motion to be voted on by the house. The form of the apology was as follows: The text of the apology did not refer to compensation to Aboriginal people as a whole, nor to members of the Stolen Generations specifically. Rudd followed the apology with a 20-minute speech to the house about the need for this action. The government's apology and his speech were widely applauded among both Indigenous Australians and the non- indigenous general public.\\"Thunderous applause in Sydney for Rudd's speech\\", Australian Associated Press, The Sydney Morning Herald, 13 February 2008.McKenny, Leesha, \\"Speech gets standing ovation in Redfern\\", The Sydney Morning Herald, 13 February 2008. Opposition leader's parliamentary reply and reaction Crowds turn their backs part way through Brendan Nelson's apology reply. Brendan Nelson also delivered a 20-minute speech. He endorsed the apology but in his speech Nelson referred to the \\"under-policing\\" of child welfare in Aboriginal communities, as well as a host of social ills blighting the lives of Aboriginal people. > The Alice Springs Crown Prosecutor Nanette Rogers with great courage > revealed to the nation in 2006 the case of a four-year-old girl drowned > while being raped by a teenager who had been sniffing petrol. She told us of > the two children ‚Äì one a baby ‚Äì sexually assaulted by two men while their > mothers were off drinking alcohol. Another baby was stabbed by a man trying > to kill her mother.The Sydney Morning Herald, 13 February 2008. Retrieved 12 > April 2012. Nelson's speech was considered controversial and received mixed reactions. Thousands of people who had gathered in public spaces in Canberra and Melbourne to hear the apology turned their backs on the screens that broadcast Nelson speaking. In Perth, people booed and jeered until the screen was switched off. In Parliament House's Great Hall, elements of the audience began a slow clap, with some finally turning their backs. There were similar reactions and walk-outs in Sydney and elsewhere. After the ceremony, the House of Representatives unanimously adopted the proposed apology motion. Six members of Nelson's opposition caucus ‚Äî Don Randall, Sophie Mirabella, Dennis Jensen, Wilson Tuckey, Luke Simpkins, and Alby Schultz ‚Äî left the House in protest at the apology. Peter Dutton was the only Opposition front bencher to abstain from the apology. Response Dr. Tom Calma, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Social Justice Commissioner of the Australian Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission, gave a speech formally responding to the government's apology. Calma thanked the Parliament for acknowledging and paying respects to the Stolen Generations, stating \\"By acknowledging and paying respect, Parliament has now laid the foundations for healing to take place and for a reconciled Australia in which everyone belongs.\\" However, Calma did note that there were many recommendations in the Bringing Them Home report that, as of 2009, had not yet been implemented. Senate consideration Later that day, the Senate considered a motion for an identical apology. The Leader of the Greens, Senator Bob Brown, attempted to amend the motion to have it include words committing parliament to offering compensation to those who suffered loss under past indigenous policies, but was opposed by all the other parties. The original motion was passed unanimously.

It has been managed by the Hayes Family since 1906. It is currently managed by Ben and Nicole Hayes. Early history Central Aranda people have lived on Undoolya Station and the surrounding region for thousands of years. Undoolya Station was established by South Australian pastoralist and stock agent Edward Mead Bagot. After working the southern section of the Overland Telegraph Line, Bagot applied for two leases adjoining the Alice Springs Telegraph Station in 1872. His friend Joseph Gilbert also applied for two blocks, closer to where Owen Springs Station is today. Bagot's son Ted, Churchill Smith and Joseph Gilbert's son William, selected cattle on Gilbert's Pewsey Vale Station to stock the new Central Australian leases. They undertook the first large cattle drove from South Australia to Alice Springs in June. It is considered to be one of the great droving feats in Australia history, during which they met Charles Todd returning from his first inspection of the southern end of the Overland Telegraph Line, as well as well-known explorers Ernest Giles, Peter Warburton and William Gosse. Emily Gap became their temporary camp upon arrival until construction of a homestead began in 1873. Undoolya was purchased by William Hayes and his wife Mary in 1906. In 1911, the Commonwealth Department of External Affairs stated the need for a horse breeding station, to meet a contract with the Indian Army to supply them with over 4000 horses annually. The Undoolya leases were identified as a potential location since they were up for renewal in September 1911. After much uncertainty, the leases were signed and delivered to the Hayes family on 15 September 1921. By then William Hayes had died, so his son Edward Hayes became general manager and moved from Maryvale Station to Undoolya with his wife Ann. In 1930 the family company was dissolved and the Hayes family properties were put up for auction in 1930. He purchased Undoolya and sold Maryvale and Owen Springs. After serious drought conditions, Hayes realised the need for dams and developed the infrastructure on Undoolya. He also introduced Poll Herefords to the station, the first to bring them to Central Australia. By 1935 he had grown the station to 2000 cattle, 150 horses and 400 goats. In 1950, Edward Hayes sold the station to his son Edward Junior, better known as Ted (-1988) and his wife Jean. In 1960 Ted purchased Deep Well Station. He was forced to move all his cattle to Undoolya Station in 1964 to 1965 due to drought, abandoning Deep Well. All staff relocated to Undoolya also. Despite challenging climatic conditions, Ted doubled the capacity of Undoolya over the last 30 years of his life, leaving the station to his wife and sons. The station remains in the family and is currently run by Ben and Nicole Hayes. Current use =Cattle= The Hayes continue to run Poll Hereford cattle on the property. It is European Union-accredited and has been part of a Meat Standards Australia grading program since 2009. They predominately supply cattle to T&R; Pastoral abattoir at Murray Bridge or Victorian feedlots. =Horticulture= The Hayes Family cleared part of the station in 2002 to establish Rocky Hill Table Grapes. They now have 60,000 white grape vines over . They have also grown lucerne, onions, cabbages and other vegetables. Rocky Hill was granted an increased water extraction license in 2015, causing concern among some local residents and environmental groups.

But this planned sex date takes an unexpected twist and the interactions between Andy and Harry go beyond physical pleasure bringing out questions that need to be answered, truths that need to be accepted and a life that stands to be reckoned. \\"Amen\\" makes two characters meet, experience hope amidst confusion, explore truths about sexuality and the self and delves into the profound meaning of life in the continuum of its trifles. The film reflect the diversity of issues that the community continues to face ‚Äî from social prejudices to the predicament of acknowledging their sexuality. Reviews and appreciation The film is inspired from the life of the human right activist Harish Iyer. Amen explores gay relationship like no other movie has done before. It teaches the world that life does not allow one to choose his sexuality, one is born with it. Amen strives to be unapologetically accurate in its depiction of gay relationships, and the intricacies and challenges faced by gay individuals in India today. The dynamics of how we accept our sexual orientation and live with it in contemporary society are poignantly shown in the movie, which provokes thought about how we form our identity based on ourselves, our past experiences and our society. The short also stirs up questions in the viewer's mind ‚Äì why are we still afraid to accept our own feelings, learn how to go beyond the traumas of our own pasts and learn to go with the flow.  Amen is also part of the DVD archived at the Kinsey Institute, Indiana University In 2011 Amen was selected as the only Indian film on the Iris Prize, also known as the 'gay Oscars', list of 30 top LGBT films from across the globe.

This theology harkens back at least to the Shang dynasty. Described as the \\"five changeable faces of Heaven\\", they represent Heaven's cosmic activity which shapes worlds as t√°n , \\"altars\\", imitating its order which is visible in the starry vault, the north celestial pole and its spinning constellations. The Five Deities themselves represent these constellations. In accordance with the Three Powers ( SƒÅnc√°i) they have a celestial, a terrestrial and a chthonic form. The Han Chinese identify themselves as the descendants of the Red and Yellow Deities. They are associated with the five colors, the five phases of the continuous creation, the five key planets of the Solar System and the five constellations rotating around the celestial pole, the five sacred mountains and five directions of space (their terrestrial form), and the five Dragon Gods ( L√≥ngsh√©n) who represent their mounts, that is to say the material forces they preside over (their chthonic form). They have also been defined simply as five special forms of the worship of the God of Heaven, different \\"accesses\\" or perspectives, suitable for different situations, to serve Heaven. According to Zheng Xuan, the influence of their activity begets different categories of beings on earth. Explaining the ancient theology about the origins of kings from Heaven's impregnation of earthly women, he commented: Names and meanings Other names by which the Five Deities are collectively known are: * W«îfƒÅng TiƒÅnsh√©n ( \\"Five Forms of the God of Heaven\\"); * W«îfƒÅngd√¨ ( \\"Five Forms Deity\\"); * W«îtiƒÅnd√¨ ( \\"Five Heavenly Deities\\"); * W«îl«éoj≈´n ( \\"Five Olden Lords\\"); * W«îd√†osh√©n ( \\"Five Ways God(s)\\"); * XiƒÅntiƒÅn W«îd√¨ ( \\"Five Deities of the Former Heaven\\"); * W«îs√®d√¨ ( \\"Five Colors' Deities\\"). In some works they are conceptualized as a single deity, the \\"Great Deity the Heavenly King\\" ( TiƒÅnhu√°ng D√†d√¨) or \\"Highest Deity of the Vast Heaven\\" ( H√†otiƒÅn Sh√†ngd√¨), which are therefore other epithets for the supreme God of Heaven. =Huangdi‚ÄîYellow Deity= Temple of Huangdi in Xinzheng, the reputed birthplace of Xuanyuan, in Zhengzhou, Henan. Temple of the Central Peak, Mount Song, in Henan. Hu√°ngd√¨ ( \\"Yellow Emperor\\" or \\"Yellow Deity\\"), also called Hu√°ngsh√©n ( \\"Yellow God\\"), is another name of the supreme God in Chinese traditions, associated to the northern culmen of the sky and the Big Dipper (or Great Chariot, or Ursa Major) in particular, and with the power of the wu ( shamans). He is also known, as a human culture hero and progenitor, as XuƒÅnyu√°n ( \\"Chariot Shaft\\" p. 117, note 11.), XuƒÅnyu√°nsh√¨ ( \\"Master of the Chariot Shaft\\"), or XuƒÅnyu√°n Hu√°ngd√¨ ( \\"Yellow Deity of the Chariot Shaft\\"), and as a cosmological symbol as Zh≈çngyu√®d√†d√¨ ( \\"Great Deity of the Central Peak\\"). He represents the essence of earth and the Yellow Dragon ( Hu√°ngl√≥ng). The character hu√°ng, for \\"yellow\\", also means, by homophony and shared etymology with hu√°ng, \\"august\\", \\"creator\\" and \\"radiant\\", attributes of the supreme God. He is the deity who shapes the material world ( D√¨), the creator of the Huaxia civility, of marriage and morality, language and lineage, and primal ancestor of all the Chinese. In the cosmology of the Wufang Shangdi his astral body is Saturn, but he is also identified as the Sun God, and with the star Regulus (Œ± Leonis) and constellations Leo and Lynx, of which the latter is said to represent the body of the Yellow Dragon. He corresponds to the Hu√°ngsh√©n Bƒõid«íu ( \\"Yellow God of the Northern Dipper\\"), of whom in certain historical sources he is described as the human form making an ontological distinction between the two. For instance, according to a definition given by apocryphal texts related to the H√©t√∫ , the Yellow Emperor \\"proceeds from the essence of the Yellow God of the Northern Dipper\\", is born to \\"a daughter of a chthonic deity\\", and as such he is \\"a cosmic product of the conflation of Heaven and Earth\\". The Yellow God is in turn described as the \\"spirit father and astral double\\" of the Yellow Emperor. As a human being, the Yellow Emperor is said to have been the fruit of a virginal birth, as his mother Fubao was impregnated by a radiance (yuanqi, \\"primordial pneuma\\"), a lightning, which she saw encircling the Northern Dipper (Great Chariot, or Ursa Major), or the celestial pole, while she was walking in the countryside. She delivered her son after twenty-four months on the mount of Shou (Longevity) or mount Xuanyuan, after which he was named. Through his human side, he was a descendant of Y«íuxi√≥ng, the lineage of the Bear‚Äîanother reference to the Ursa Major. Scholar John C. Didier has studied the parallels that the Yellow Emperor's mythology has in other cultures, deducing a plausible ancient origin of the myth in Siberia or in north Asia. In older accounts, the Yellow Emperor is identified as a deity of light (and his name is explained in the Shuowen Jiezi to derive from guƒÅng , \\"light\\") and thunder, and as one and the same with the \\"Thunder God\\" ( L√©ish√©n), p. 239: in the Hetudijitong and the Chunqiuhechengtu the Yellow Emperor is identified as the Thunder God. p. 138. who in turn, as a later mythological character, is distinguished as the Yellow Emperor's foremost pupil, such as in the Huangdi Neijing. Huangdi represents the hub of creation, the axis mundi (Kunlun) that is the manifestation of the divine order in physical reality, opening the way to immortality. As the deity of the centre of the four directions, in the Shizi he is described as \\"Yellow Emperor with Four Faces\\" ( Hu√°ngd√¨ S√¨mi√†n). The \\"Four-Faced God\\" or \\"Ubiquitous God\\" ( S√¨mi√†nsh√©n) is also the Chinese name of Brahma. Huangdi is the model of those who merge their self with the self of the universal God, of the ascetics who reach enlightenment or immortality. In Sima Qian's description of the Five Deities it is important to note that the Yellow Emperor was portrayed as the grandfather of the Black Emperor of the north who personifies as well the pole stars, and as the tamer of the Red Emperor, his half-brother, who is the spirit of the southern populations known collectively as Chu in the Zhou dynasty. =Cangdi‚ÄîBluegreen Deity= Pu, Linfen, Shanxi. CƒÅngd√¨ ( \\"Green Deity\\" or \\"Green Emperor\\") or CƒÅngsh√©n ( \\"Green God\\"), also known as Qƒ´ngd√¨ ( \\"Blue Deity\\" or \\"Bluegreen Deity\\") or Qƒ´ngsh√©n ( \\"Bluegreen God\\"), and cosmologically as the D≈çngd√¨ ( \\"East Deity\\") or D≈çngyu√®d√†d√¨ ( \\"Great Deity of the Eastern Peak\\", which is Mount Tai), is the manifestation of the supreme God associated with the essence of wood and spring, for which he is worshipped as the god of fertility. The Bluegreen Dragon ( Qƒ´ngl√≥ng) is both his animal form and constellation, and as a human he was T√†ih√†o . His female consort is the goddess of fertility Bixia. His astral body is Jupiter. =Heidi‚ÄîBlack Deity= Temple of the Dark Ancestor in Yibin, Sichuan. Hƒìid√¨ ( \\"Black Deity\\" or \\"Black Emperor\\") or Hƒìish√©n ( \\"Black God\\"), also known as the cosmological Bƒõid√¨ ( \\"North Deity\\") or Bƒõiyu√®d√†d√¨ ( \\"Great Deity of the Northern Peak\\"), and identified as ZhuƒÅnx≈´ (), today frequently worshipped as Xu√°nw«î ( \\"Dark Warrior\\") or Zhƒìnw«î (), is the manifestation of the supreme God associated with the essence of water and winter. His animal form is the Black Dragon ( Xu√°nl√≥ng, literally \\"Dark Dragon\\" or \\"Mysterious Dragon\\") and his stellar animal is the tortoise-snake. His astral body is Mercury. =Chidi‚ÄîRed Deity= Temple of Yandi in his reputed birthplace in Suizhou, Hubei. Ch√¨d√¨ ( \\"Red Deity\\" or \\"Red Emperor\\") or Ch√¨sh√©n ( \\"Red God\\"), also known as the N√°nd√¨ ( \\"South Deity\\") or N√°nyu√®d√†d√¨ ( \\"Great Deity of the Southern Peak\\"), as a human was Sh√©nn√≥ng ( \\"Farmer God\\" or \\"Plowing God\\"), who is also the same as Y√°nd√¨ ( \\"Flame Deity\\" or \\"Fiery Deity\\"), a function occupied by different gods and god-kings in mytho-history. Shennong is also one of the Three Patrons, specifically the patron of humanity ( R√©nhu√°ng), and the point of intersection of the Three Patrons and Huangdi. He is also associated with Chƒ´y√≥u (), the god of some southern peoples, in both iconography and myth, as both Shennong Yandi and Chiyou fought against the Yellow Emperor, although Chiyou is traditionally considered more violent and has the horns of a fighting bull, while Shennong Yandi is more peaceful and has the horns of a plowing buffalo. He is the manifestation of the supreme God associated with the essence of fire; his animal form is the Red Dragon ( Zh≈´l√≥ng) and his stellar animal is the phoenix. He is the god of agriculture, animal husbandry, medicinal plants and market. In broader conceptualisation, he is the god of science and craft, and the patron of doctors and apothecaries. His astral body is Mars. =Baidi‚ÄîWhite Deity= Quyang, Baoding, Hebei.

His animal form is the White Dragon ( B√°il√≥ng) and his stellar animal is the tiger. His astral body is Venus. Contrast between the Red and the Yellow Deities Statue and ceremonial complex of the Yellow and Red Deities in Zhengzhou, Henan. In mythology, Huangdi and Yandi fought a battle against each other; and Huang finally defeated Yan with the help of the Dragon (the controller of water, who is Huangdi himself). pp. 156‚Äì157. This myth symbolises the equipoise of yin and yang, here the fire of knowledge (reason and craft) and earthly stability. Yan is flame, scorching fire, or an excess of it (it is important to notice that graphically it is a double huo, \\"fire\\"). As an excess of fire brings destruction to the earth, it has to be controlled by a ruling principle. Nothing is good in itself, without limits; good outcomes depend on the proportion in the composition of things and their interactions, never on extremes in absolute terms. Huangdi and Yandi are complementary opposites, necessary for the existence of one another, and they are powers that exist together within the human being. History of the cult of the Five Deities The worship of the Five Deities by both commoners and rulers of China is a very ancient practice, harkening back at least to the Neolithic. Already in the theology of the Shang dynasty, the supreme God of Heaven (Shangdi or Di) was conceived as manifesting in a fourfold form and will, the four fƒÅng (\\"directions\\" or \\"sides\\") and their fƒìng (\\"winds\\"). =Qin dynasty= Main hall of the Dai Temple ( D√†imi√†o) at Mount Tai. As the major one of the Eastern Peak Temples, dedicated to the Bluegreen Deity, the spring aspect of the Highest Deity identified with Jupiter, it is a site of fire sacrifice to Di since prehistoric times. Mount Tai is the holiest of the China's sacred mountains; according to mythology it formed from Pangu's head after his body's dissection. The official religion and ritual of the state of Qin (9th century BCE‚Äì221 BCE) was largely based on that of the Zhou dynasty (c. 1046 BCE‚Äì256 BCE). The emperors worshipped the supreme God at a location in the suburbs of their capital Xianyang. The cults of the White, Green, Yellow and Red Deities had been celebrated separately in different parts of the state. In 677 BCE, Yong, an ancient sacred site where the Yellow Emperor himself was said to have sacrificed and the Zhou dynasty carried out ji√†o rituals, or \\"suburban sacrifices\\", became the capital of Qin. It is attested that in 671 BCE, Duke Xuan (675‚Äì664) carried out the sacrifices for the Green Deity in Mi, south of the Wei River. Then, Duke Ling (?‚Äì384) instituted the sacred sites of Sh√†ng ( \\"Above\\") and Xi√† ( \\"Below\\"), for the Yellow and Red Deities, in Wuyang, near Yong. Originally, the sacrifice for the White Deity had been carried out in 769 BCE by Duke Xiang (778‚Äì766) in Xi, near Lanzhou in Gansu. In 753 they were carried out by Duke Wen (765‚Äì716) in Fu, northeast Shaanxi. In 253 BCE the great grandfather of Qin Shihuang unified the imperial cult of the four forms of God in Yong, constructing there altars for the White, Green, Yellow and Red Deities. In 219, Qin Shihuang, founder of the Qin empire (221 BCE‚Äì206 BCE), personally sacrificed at Mount Tai, the sacred mountain at the centre of Shandong, a site for the worship of the supreme godhead in the erstwhile states of Qi and Lu. He modelled the sacrifice on that performed at Yong, in alignment with the Qin tradition, consisting of three types of victims‚Äîhorses, rams and oxen. =Han dynasty= Tablet in the Temple of Heaven of Beijing, written in Chinese and Manchu, dedicated to the Five Deities. The Manchu word usiha, meaning \\"star\\", explains that this tablet is dedicated to the five planets: Jupiter, Mars, Saturn, Venus and Mercury and the movements which they govern. The ritual system of the early emperors of the Han dynasty (206 BCE‚Äì220 AD) was not different from that of the Qin, with the only change consisting in the integration of the Black Deity by Gaozu or Liu Bang (206‚Äì195), the first emperor of the dynasty. However, Han state religion soon found itself divided between two factions. On one hand there were the Confucians who pushed for a new ritual system and a religio-political centralisation around the worship of the God of Heaven by the emperor, the God of Heaven's son, and the worship of lesser deities who had to be approved by the Confucians themselves, who considered themselves the only ones capable of interpreting the signs of Heaven in accordance with the classics. On the other hand there were the fangshi ( \\"masters of directions\\"), ritual masters who formulated what would have been called the \\"Huang‚ÄìLao\\" proto-Taoist religious movement, who presented themselves as the continuators of the traditions of the erstwhile kingdoms, and who emphasised the worship of local deities integrated into a theology in which the supreme God of Heaven was named Taiyi (\\"Great One\\"), and its human manifestation was the ancestral Yellow Emperor whom the emperors had to imitate. The imperial temple at Yong which was established by the great grandfather of Qin Shihuang was rearranged placing the altars of the gods each in its respective direction, and that of the Yellow Deity at the centre. Outside Yong, two other temples dedicated to the Five Deities were built during the reign of Emperor Wen (180‚Äì157), one in Weiyang, northeast of Chang'an, and one in Chengji near the modern county of Tongwei in Gansu. The sacrifices at Yong held a central positions and were carried out every three years by the emperor. If the emperor was absent, the rituals were performed by masters of rites, at various times throughout the year based on the ritual calendar of the Qin. In 113 BCE, Emperor Wu of Han innovated the Confucian state religion integrating the Huang‚ÄìLao conception of Taiyi with the Five Deities and the cult of Houtu (\\"Queen of the Earth\\"). In 135 BCE, the fangshi Miu Ji, from Bo in modern Shandong, insisted that Taiyi was the same supreme God, master of the Five Deities, worshipped since remote antiquity by the emperors through the three-victims sacrifice. The rite lasted seven days and took place at a temple with \\"eight entrances for the numina\\" in the southeastern suburb of the capital. In conformity with the instructions of Miu Ji, the emperor built a temple in the outskirts of Chang'an and appointed a great invocator (taizhu) to conduct the sacrifices. Twenty years later‚Äîunder the influence of another prominent court fangshi, Gongsun Qing‚Äîthe sacrifice was held by the emperor in person. A temple of Taiyi and the Five Deities was built in Ganquan, 70km northeast of Chang'an. Regarding the liturgy, sacrificial protocol and architectural layout, the sites of Ganquan and Mount Tai followed the model of Yong. Besides the highest gods of the pantheon, the emperor or the central administration celebrated the cults of other gods, including those devoted to mountains and rivers, the sun and moon, stars and constellations, and heroes. In later times the expansion of the empire to different provinces and peoples was accompanied by a policy of identification or association of native gods and their cults to the imperial Han pantheon, so that the cults officially celebrated by the administration proliferated to the hundreds. In 31 BCE, Confucians at the court, especially Kuang Heng and Zhang Tan, disposed a reform of the state sacrifices, suppressing hundreds of local sacrifices and restricting those performed by the emperor in person only to the worship of Taiyi and Houtu, or Heaven and Earth.

Biography  Antoine-No√© Polier de Bottens descended from a noble family from the French Rouergue that they left for Switzerland in the 16th century to escape persecution as Huguenots and not have to abjure their Protestant faith. The first known member of this family was Jean Polier, who died in 1602 after being Secretary of the Embassy of France in Geneva, a family which included scholars, professors and officers who served with distinction in the armies of most major powers. He was the son of Jean Jacques de Polier de Bottens (1670-1747), knight banneret of Lausanne and his wife Salom√©e Jeanne Elisabeth Quisard (ca. 1670‚Äì1735).Genealogie der Familie He first began to study theology in Lausanne then, in order to complete his studies, moved to Leiden University, where he obtained a doctorate in 1739. Back in his home country, de Polier took over a parish in the city of Lausanne. From 1743 he was third, 1754 second, and 1765 first pastor in Lausanne, Seigneur de Bottens, ministre du Saint-√âvangile, 1er pasteur des √âglises de Lausanne. In 1759, he was head of the \\"S√©minaire protestant fran√ßais de Lausanne\\", and then in 1766 advanced as dean of the chapter. Through an extensive correspondence with Voltaire during the period 1753‚Äì1759, he was encouraged by the famous thinker to have his writings published by Marc-Michel Bousquet's (1696‚Äì1762) publishing company. In the realm of his competences, de Polier wrote at least nine but unauthorized articles for the Encyclop√©die by Diderot and D'Alembert: Kijovn, Liturgie, Logomachie, Magicien, Magie, Malachbelus, M√¢nes, Maosim and Messie. Voltaire adopted these articles for his Dictionnaire philosophique (1764), but modified extensively passages when they put in question beliefs on a literal interpretation of Scriptures. On April 13, 1744, he married Elisabeth Antoinette Susanne de Lagier-Pluvianes (1722-1769). Both had five daughters and four sons.

In 1990, as a result of East Germany's first (and as matters turned out last) free and democratic national election, she was elected a member of the country's national parliament (Volkskammer). Following reunification, she was a member of the German Upper legislative assembly (Bundestag) between 1990 and 1994. She then pursued a career in regional politics before returning in 2004 to her earlier vocation as a physician. Life Ursula B√§tz was born in Steinach in the East German Bezirk Suhl, a small but long established town in the Thuringian Forest to the south of Erfurt, today administratively part of the district of Sonneberg. Her parents both worked in middle management, her father in the commerce sector and her mother in sales. She attended primary school locally between 1959 and 1967, moving on to secondary school (\\"Erweiterte Oberschule\\") in nearby Neuhaus am Rennweg. Passing her school final exams (Abitur) in 1971 opened the way for university-level studies. Between 1971 and 1973 she studied Medicine at the Karl Marx University (as it was known at the time) in Leipzig, moving on to the Erfurt Medical Academy from where she emerged with a Degree in Medicine in 1976, which was also the year in which she passed the national examination necessary to obtain her medical practicing certificate. In 1971, like many ambitious people, she had joined the country's ruling Socialist Unity Party (\\"Sozialistische Einheitspartei Deutschlands\\" / SED), but available sources covering this part of Ursula Fischer's career are otherwise silent on the subject of any political involvement. She then, till 1982, undertook specialist medical training in Pediatrics at Eisenach and Nordhausen. Following successful completion of this, between 1982 and 1990, apart from two years working abroad, she remained in Nordhausen, employed as a pediatrician. In the General election of March 1990, Fischer was elected as one of the 66 PDS members of the national parliament (Volkskammer). She later recalled that she had not even been present at the party conference at which her name was placed on the party's candidate list, but she had participated in the round table discussions that took place in the run up to reunification, and assumed that she had been selected as a candidate because others had found her contributions memorable. Following reunification, which took place formally in October 1990, new elections were held in Germany. Under the system applied, the PDS (party) received only one seat based on its 2.4% share of the national vote, but they won a further 17 seats according to the regional vote, most of them in the \\"New Federal States\\" (former East Germany) where the party's overall vote share was 11.4%. Ursula Fischer was one of two elected Upper legislative assembly (Bundestag) candidates from the party list for the Thuringia electoral district. Within the chamber she was elected parliamentary leader of the PDS group. She did not contest her Bundestag seat at the next national election, in 1994. Instead she successfully stood for election to the regional parliament (Landtag) in her home state of Thuringia. Five years later, when the PDS increased its share of the vote in the Thuringian regional election, she stood again. She sat as a member of the Landtag for ten years between 1994 and 2004. During this time she was also a membership of the regional party executive in the Nordhausen district. Within the Landtag she was a member of the parliamentary committee on social affairs, family and health. However, in 2000 she was among those who resigned from the PDS,Birgit Kummer: ‚ÄûLebenskrisen oder psychische Erkrankungen traten erst Jahre sp√§ter auf‚Äú.

He continued his education at nightschool where he studied accountancy. Military career Gopsill enlisted in The King‚Äôs (Liverpool) Regiment at the outbreak of the Second World War. His capabilities were noticed and he was selected for officer training. In 1942 he was commissioned into the 1st Gurkha Rifles and served with the 3rd Battalion in Burma. At the age of 23 he was awarded the Military Cross for his actions in Cochin-China. In 1947 Gopsill transferred to the 7th Gurkha Rifles as his former regiment had been incorporated into the new Indian Army. He was posted to Malaya where a communist insurgency had started. In 1949 he was awarded the Distinguished Service Order for his exemplary bravery. Gopsill was subsequently asked to raise a new regiment. Within 18 months he had recruited and trained one hundred local Iban tribesmen to form the 1st Malaysian Rangers. He then led them into action during Indonesia's confrontation with the newly formed Malaysia. Gopsill's proficiency in jungle warfare led to him becoming chief instructor at the Brigade of Gurkhas Training Depot. In 1965 he was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire for his services to the Malaysian Armed Forces.

(2003). \\"Design ‚Äì Who needs an architect?\\". IEEE Software. 20 (5): 11‚Äì44. doi:10.1109/MS.2003.1231144 and/or costly to change.Booch, G., abstracting- the-unknown, SATURN 2016 keynote Characteristics Architectural decisions influence and impact the non-functional characteristics of a system. Each architectural decision describes a concrete, architecturally significant design issue (a.k.a. design problem, decision required) for which several potential solutions (a.k.a. options, alternatives) exist. An architectural decision captures the result of a conscious, often collaborative option selection process and provides design rationale for the decision making outcome, e.g., by referencing one or more of the quality attributes addressed by the architectural decision and answering \\"why\\" questions about the design and option selection. Architectural decisions concern a software system as a whole, or one or more of the core components of such a system. Types of architectural decisions are the selection of architectural tactics and patterns, of integration technologies, and of middleware, as well as related implementation strategies and assets (both commercial products and open source projects).Page 64 in O. Zimmermann, Architectural Decisions as Reusable Design Assets. IEEE Software, Volume 28, Issue 1, Pages 64-69, Jan./Feb. 2011. Software architecture design is a wicked problem,Conklin, Jeffrey (2006). Dialogue mapping : building shared understanding of wicked problems. Chichester, England: Wiley Publishing. . therefore architectural decisions are difficult to get right and often, no single optimal solution for any given set of architecture design problems exists. Architectural decision making is a core responsibility of software architects;Kruchten, P., What do software architects really do?, The Journal of Systems and Software 81 (2008) 2413‚Äì2416 additional motivation for/of the importance of architectural decisions as a first-class concept in software architecture can be found online.Hohpe, G., Is This Architecture? Look for Decisions! History Rationale was mentioned in an early definition of software architecture by Perry/Woolf,Perry, D. E.; Wolf, A. L. (1992). \\"Foundations for the study of software architecture\\" (PDF). ACM SIGSOFT Software Engineering Notes. 17 (4): 40. doi:10.1145/141874.141884 but not researched much until 2004, when a workshop on architectural decisions and Architectural Knowledge Management was held in Groningen, NL. Early publications can be traced back to this workshop,.Jansen, A.; Bosch, J.

Springer Berlin Heidelberg, 2006. 43-58. From 2006 on, the architectural knowledge management and architectural decision research communities gained momentum and a number of papers was published at major software architecture conferences such as European Conference on Software Architecture (ECSA), Quality of Software Architecture (QoSA) and (Working) International Conference on Software Architecture (ICSA). A Springer book summarized the state of the art as of 2009,Babar, M.A.; Dings√∏yr, T.; Lago, P.; Vliet, H. van (2009).

In practice, the importance of making the right decisions has always been recognized, for instance in software development processes such as OpenUP; many templates and practices for decision documentation exist. Seven of these templates are compared in.Zimmermann, O., Wegmann, L., Koziolek, H., Goldschmidt, T., Architectural Decision Guidance across Projects, Proc. of. IEEE/IFIP WICSA 2015 The most recent standard for architecture descriptions, ISO/IEC/IEEE 42010:2011 has a dedicated rationale entity, and gives detailed recommendations which architectural decisions to capture and which properties of an architectural decision to record in the decision log.ISO/IEC/IEEE 42010:Templates for using the Standard. Decision management steps =Decision identification= Before a decision can be made, the need for a decision must be articulated: how urgent and how important is the AD? Does it have to be made now or can it wait until more is known about requirements and system under construction? Both personal and collective experience, as well as recognized design methods and practices, can assist with decision identification; it has been proposed that Agile software development team should maintain a decision backlog complementing the product backlog of the project.Hofmeister, C., Kruchten, P., Nord, R., Obbink, H.; Ran, A., America, P. (2007), A general model of software architecture design derived from five industrial approaches. =Decision making= A number of decision making techniques exists, both general ones and software and software architecture specific ones, for instance, dialogue mapping.Conklin, Jeffrey (2006). Dialogue mapping: building shared understanding of wicked problems. Chichester, England: Wiley Publishing. . Group decision making is an active research topic. =Decision documentation= Many templates and tools for decision capturing exist, both in agile communities (e.g., M. Nygard's architecture decision recordsM. Nygard, Documenting Architecture Decisions) and in software engineering and architecture design methods (e.g., see table layouts suggested by IBM UMF Zimmermann, O., An Architectural Decision Modeling Framework for SOA and Cloud Design, SEI SATURN 2010 presentation. and by Tyree and Akerman from CapitalOne.Tyree, J., Akerman, A., Architecture decisions: demystifying architecture G. Fairbanks included decision rationale in his one-page Architecture Haikus;G. Fairbanks, Architecture Haiku, http://www.slideshare.net/matthewmccullough/architecture-haiku his notation was later evolved into Y-statements. See T. van Lessen, A Brief Introduction to ADRs, https://speakerdeck.com/vanto/a-brief-introduction-to-architectural- decision-records for motivation, examples, comparisons. =Decision enactment (enforcement)= Architectural decisions are used in software design; hence they have to be communicated to, and accepted by, the stakeholders of the system that fund, develop, and operate it. Architecturally evident coding styles Fairbanks, G., An architecturally-evident coding style: making your design visible in your code, Proc. of OOPSLA 2010 and code reviews that focus on architectural concerns and decisions are two related practices. Architectural decisions also have to be considered when modernizing a software system in software evolution. =Decision sharing (optional step)= Many architectural decisions recur across projects; hence, experiences with past decisions, both good and bad, can be valuable reusable assets when employing an explicit knowledge management strategy.Babar, M.A.; Dings√∏yr, T.; Lago, P.; Vliet, H. van (2009). Software Architecture Knowledge Management:Theory and Practice (eds.), First Edition. Springer. Examples On large scale projects, the number of architectural decisions to be made can exceed 100, including: * Selection of architectural layering scheme and individual layer responsibilities (when adopting the Layers pattern from Buschmann, Frank; Meunier, Regine; Rohnert, Hans; Sommerlad, Peter (1996). Pattern-Oriented Software Architecture, Volume 1: A System of Patterns. John Wiley & Sons. .) * Choice of implementation technology per layer, component, and connector (e.g., programming language, interface contract format, XML vs. JSON when designing integration interfaces and message exchanges) * Choice of presentation layer frameworks on client side (e.g., JavaScript frameworks) and on the server side (e.g., Java and PHP frameworks) Refer to the design concept catalogs in Attribute-Driven Design 3.0 H. Cervantes, R. Kazman, Designing Software Architectures: A Practical Approach, Addison-Wesley, 2016. and domain-specific decision guidance models Page 21 in Zimmermann, O., Guidance Models and Decision-Making Tooling for SOA, Cloud, and Outsourcing Solution Design, http://resources.sei.cmu.edu/asset_files/Presentation/2011_017_001_24654.pdf for more examples. This is an example of a decision made, which is formatted according to the Y-statement template proposed in:Uwe Zdun et al., Sustainable Architectural Design Decisions, IEEE Software, Volume 30, Number 6 (2013), available at http://www.infoq.com/articles/sustainable-architectural-design- decisions ‚ÄúIn the context of the Web shop service, facing the need to keep user session data consistent and current across shop instances, we decided for the Database Session State Pattern (and against Client Session State or Server Session State)M. Fowler,Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture to achieve cloud elasticity, accepting that a session database needs to be designed, implemented, and replicated.‚Äù Templates Many templates have been suggested by practicing architects and by software architecture researchers. GitHub repositories such as \\"Architecture decision record (ADR)\\"J. Parker- Hernderson, Architecture decision record (ADR), https://github.com/joelparkerhenderson/architecture_decision_record and \\"Markdown Architectural Decision Records\\"ADR organization,Markdown Architectural Decision Records collect many of them, as well as links to tools and writing hints. Software Architecture Group Decision Making Both practitioners and researchers recognize that software architecture decision- making is a group process that involves several stakeholders discussing, evaluating and shortlisting architectural decisions. Studies of practitioners found that though groups are ideally sized, a structured approach to decision- making is largely lacking. Specifically: * There is a predominance of unstructured approach to decision-making. This limits the participation of group members. * There is a lack of collaborative tool support to assist architects in the decision-making process. * Architects often experience delays and omissions in the decision-making process due to lack a of a structured approach * Architecting teams experience challenges including Groupthink and Group polarization These challenges provide good scope for experimentation and research for the software architecture community.

It was designed by William Pagan and built in 1913. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992.  History  The concrete arch bridge supporting the railway line west of Humphery was constructed in 1913 as the last of several bridges on this line. A rail link was requested from Maryborough to the long established town of Gayndah in the 1860s, but construction did not begin until the late 1880s. The line opened to Brooweena in July 1889, Boompa in March 1891 and Biggenden in April 1891. Although the rails ended at Degilbo, this section was not opened until 1893 when flood damage to the bridge over the Mary River at Antigua cut off the lime supply for the sugar industry at Maryborough and Bundaberg and a new supply was opened up near Degilbo. The line ended at Degilbo until the extension to Gayndah began with a extension to Wetheron that opened in December 1905. Gayndah was finally reached in December 1907. In 1910 a further extension was proposed. Construction of the railway between Gayndah and Mundubbera began in April 1911, anticipating by a few months the officially turning of the first sod by Walter Paget, Minister for Railways, on 7 July 1911. The line was opened for traffic between Gayndah and Boomerang in November 1913 and to Mundubbera in February 1914. The line was further extended in the 1920s and reached Monto in September 1928. The use of concrete arches for railway bridges is a distinctive feature in Queensland and South Australia. The first concrete bridge in Queensland was constructed at Petrie Terrace in 1897. Between 1900 and 1913, six arch concrete railway bridges were constructed in Queensland approximating with the term in office of William Pagan as Chief Engineer of Railways and it is believed that he was responsible for their design. The first two (Swansons Rail Bridge near Toowoomba and Deep Creek Railway Bridge near Degilbo), followed the form of a stone arch bridge. However, Steep Rocky Creek Railway Bridge in 1906 departs completely from stone forms and has wall type arches supporting vertical diaphragms with a deck slab carrying the track and ballast; this bridge was built to cross a ravine in rugged country and represents a similar design and technical developments to meet similar requirements to that at Humphery, which was completed a few years later.  Description  The bridge is a concrete arch bridge carrying the Mungar to Monto railway over a dry gully some south west of Humphrey Station and west of Gayndah. It has five semicircular arch spans, with solid concrete spandrel walls. Although a simple bridge, it is well detailed with projecting cornices at the bases of the arches, attached pillars above the piers extending above the deck and recessed spandrel walls. The bridge carries a single 3 ft 6 in gauge railway on a ballasted deck. Its spans are , three at totalling . The solid arch ribs are semicircular, with projecting cornices separating them visually from the piers below. The smaller end spans spring from a higher level, again marked at the pier by a small cornice. The recessed spandrel walls are finished off with the form concrete slightly patterned to contrast with the smooth finish of the projecting faces of the arches. The railings are of tubular metal between concrete pillars at the piers.  Heritage listing  Humphery Railway Bridge was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. This bridge, which allowed the railway to cross a deep gully, is on a branch line linking early inland towns with Maryborough and demonstrates the way in which Queensland was developed by linking important inland resources with ports. It demonstrates the skill with which the technology of the era was used to solve the problems of climatic conditions and terrain encountered by railway engineers in this process. The place is important in demonstrating a high degree of creative or technical achievement at a particular period. This bridge was built to an innovative design with reinforced concrete discontinuous wall-type pinned arches, the second of its type in Australia and only the seventh concrete bridge in Queensland. It was the last of a series of concrete arch bridges built for the Queensland railways between 1900 and 1913 and the third on this line. The place has a special association with the life or work of a particular person, group or organisation of importance in Queensland's history. The bridge is an important example of the work of William Pagan, Chief Engineer for Railways and an important figure in the early history of engineering in Queensland.

She was approached by channel Urdu1 she said, \\"Urdu1 along with Mehreen Jabbar directly approached me for the tele-film. Also when I came to know Umera has written it, I couldn't refuse it. It is the role of Marium Mukhtar, a national hero. This project is particularly for myself, my satisfaction as an actor - although it is extremely challenging to live her life and go through the entire process of training but I have to live [the] life of someone incredible.\\" In order to draw more reality to the character Baloch had to attend pilot training to learn key points, she said \\"before the shoot, I had spent first two days with the cadets so I can adapt to their environment and body language at the Air Force Academy.

So for this character, my approach was the same, that is to get into her head.\\" She further said, \\"I've never played a real life character before, so I had to be extra careful of everything. For example, I noticed she wore a specific wristwatch. I knew people wouldn‚Äôt notice such a detail but I made sure I wear such a watch too. It had to be less of myself and more of her and it was challenging. I loved doing all the physical training. I loved sports when I was young and that made things easier for me.

Names The names used for the icon, Hagiosoritissa and, in Russian, Khalkopratiskaya (–•–∞–ª–∫–æ–ø—Ä–∞—Ç–∏–π—Å–∫–∞—è), derive from the church of the Holy Urn (Greek: ·ºâŒ≥ŒØŒ± Œ£ŒøœÅœåœÇ, in reference to the urn containing the Cincture of the Theotokos) in Constantinople's Chalkoprateia (ŒßŒ±ŒªŒ∫ŒøœÄœÅŒ±œÑŒµ·øñŒ±, \\"copper market\\") district. In English, the type is also known as Madonna Advocate (the prayer gesture interpreted as an act of intercession on behalf of the faithful). History The appellation ·ºâŒ≥ŒπŒøœÉŒøœÅŒØœÑŒπœÉœÉŒ± is first recorded in Byzantine seals of the 11th century, and it appears minted on coins made under Manuel I Komnenos (). The type was widespread in the Byzantine empire and in the Balkans, but less so in Russia. Examples Such an icon is known to have been in the Hagios Demetrios basilica in Thessalonica in the 6th century, but was lost in the Byzantine Iconoclasm. An early Byzantine icon (7th century?) is preserved in the church of Santa Maria del Rosario on the Monte Mario, Rome.formerly in S. Agata in Trastevere, moved to San Sisto Vecchio and hence also known as \\"Madonna of San Sisto\\", and finally to Santa Maria del Rosario in 1931. The Madonna di sant'Alessio in the Basilica of the Saints Bonifacio and Alexis on the Aventine Hill in Rome is also of the type. An early Russian example is the Theotokos of Bogolyubovo (12th century). The church of Santa Maria in Via Lata in Rome has a 13th-century icon of this type. The treasury of the Basilica of Our Lady, Maastricht has an 11th century enamel decorated plaque intended for a reliquary, that depicts an image of the Panagia Agiosoritissa. The high-quality enamel work is very colorful in shades of blue, green, red, yellow, and white accented by meticulously shaped gold cloison patterns. The piece was made in a fine imperial workshop that was located in Constantinople. Mary's facial features are accentuated with gold cloison outlines. She is shown wearing a dark blue maphorion, with her hands clasped in prayer and her face turned towards Jesus. References *O. E.

He was born to nobles in Pisa and served as a novice master in Cortona in the latter half of his career while distinguishing himself in aiding the ill during times of the plague in both Pistoia and Fabriano. He was beatified on 4 April 1851 when Pope Pius IX approved that there existed an enduring and local 'cultus' - or popular devotion - to the late friar. Life Lorenzo da Ripafratta was born in 1373 in Ripafratta, Pisa to nobles who had the task of guarding the town's outer defenses. He assumed residence at the Santa Caterina convent in Pisa in 1396 after joining the Order of Preachers and receiving their habit. He served as the novice master in Cortona from 1402 (until relocation to Pistoia later) and would there oversee the spiritual formation of the likes of Guido di Pietro and Antoninus of Florence. He distinguished himself in aiding the victims of the plague in both Pistoia and Fabriano. Lorenzo became known for his harsh methods of personal penance and underwent long fasts and vigils. Lorenzo was also called to help in the reform movement of the order that Giovanni Dominici began and led. He moved to the convent of San Domenico in Pistoia after being made its vicar-general. He continued to maintain correspondence with Antoninus as he felt that being the Archbishop of Florence was a difficult task and that Antoninus would need to hear from friends. In the later decades of his life he suffered pain in one of his legs and endured it with remarkable resilience as a penitential sign. He died on 27 September 1456. Beatification The late friar was beatified on 4 April 1851 after Pope Pius IX confirmed that the late religious had a spontaneous and enduring local 'cultus' - otherwise noted as longstanding veneration - that still existed as a testament to the late friar's reputation for holiness.

It was opened in 1890 by the Mayor of Croydon. The site is protected by Fields in Trust through a legal \\"Deed of Dedication\\" safeguarding the future of the space as public recreation land for future generations to enjoy. The River Wandle flows through the park. Between 1967 and 2012 this was in an underground culvert which was constructed by Croydon Council. The park used to contain a boating lake which dried up and was filled in. The park is used by many people and is popular with dog walkers, footballers, joggers, skateboarders and families. The park is easily accessible by public transport using Wandle Park tram stop. The park has a 'Friends Group' of local residents and park users that are working with Croydon Council to improve the park. Geology River terrace gravels make up the underlying geology of Wandle Park which is composed of succession Woolwich Beds and Reading Beds, Thanet Sands and Upper Chalk. The Thanet Sand Formation makes up part of the water-bearing Chalk-Basal Sands aquifer of the London Basin. The gravel was deposited during Pleistocene period and has been substantially reworked since then by periglacial, fluvial and anthropogenic impacts. History One of the oldest public open spaces in Croydon, Wandle Park was built to meet the leisure and recreation needs of the population of a growing industrial town. The park was formed from two watermeadows to the west of Croydon town called Frog Mead and Stubbs Mead. The deed of sale records that Croydon Corporation bought Frog Mead in 1888 from the Briton Medical & General Life Association Limited for ¬£1,518. 15s. The of Stubbs Mead was part of the Archbishop of Canterbury's land holdings in Croydon. The Archbishops had long held land in Croydon and their presence was recorded in the Domesday Book. On 12 December 1889, Croydon Corporation bought Stubbs Mead from the Ecclesiastical Commissioners for ¬£2,700. The indenture states that \\"The land shall be forever dedicated and used as an ornamental pleasure ground and place of recreation for the inhabitants of the Borough of Croydon and for no other purpose whatsoever.\\" Improvements to the park were overseen by the Corporation's Road Committee. Minutes of the Committee available in Croydon's Local Studies Library record that a Mr W. Powell, the Roads Surveyor was instructed to draw up plans and obtain prices for the works. The centrepiece of the new park was an artificial boating lake with an island in the centre planted with trees. It was proposed to divert the River Wandle to feed the lake with water but whilst the lake was being constructed sufficient groundwater was found for this purpose. Proposals were then modified and a separate channel took the river to the north of the boating lake. John Hubert Schmitz, the Mayor of Croydon, opened Wandle Park in May 1890. A newspaper report of the time recorded that approximately 30,000 attended. The park is featured in postcards produced at the turn of the 20th century which frequently record people enjoying the lake. In the early 20th century the lake was extended to the east and another island created that could be reached by two rustic bridges. By the 1930s there was a bandstand, bowling green (with pavilion) and tennis courts and the park was the venue for the Borough's Summer Show. Photographs show that the lake froze in winter and was used for ice-skating. Other photographs of the time show that the water level in the lake was found to be erratic and it completely dried up at times in the summer. In 1967, a concrete culvert was constructed, the river was diverted into it, and the old river bed filled in. The River Wandle was buried from view and at the same time the then dry lake was filled in, topsoiled and grassed. The former course of the river was able to be traced by following a line of trees that cross the park. A flint wall on the southern side of the former location of the children's playground is also thought to be part of the wall on the north side of the river. A rose garden was created in the 1970s next to the sports pavilion and more recently a skatepark was provided on the site of the old tennis courts. Regeneration Restoration of the River Wandle in Wandle Park, in 2012 The skate park Plans were drawn up in 2010 which proposed bringing the river to the surface and provide facilities including a new cafe, changing facilities, bandstand, pond, multi-use games area, a new playspace and skatepark. A basketball court and a tennis court are located near the skate park. The park has received funding from the adjoining British Gas Site (Barratt Homes providing a Section 106 contribution as part of their planning consent), the Environment Agency, Croydon Council, Heritage Lottery Fund and the Mayor of London's Help a London Park Scheme. Work on the restoration of the River Wandle within the park began on 14 November 2011, with works to a new skate park and ball courts. The entire park closed on 9 January 2012 for the river restoration works. The upgraded skate park and games area opened on 11 May 2012, and most of the park reopened at the end of December 2012. The new bridge was installed in March 2013. The new play-space opened in the summer of 2013 when the grass under the new facilities became established. The refurbished pavilion was finished in December 2013, with the cafe opening to the public in July 2014.

It was built from 1921 onwards. It is also known as Baralaba Coal Mine. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 18 September 2009.  History  The former Dawson Valley Colliery (established 1921) is located in the Dawson River basin close to the township of Baralaba in Central Queensland. The Dawson River basin forms part of the Bowen Basin coal fields. The Bowen Basin covers an area about long and wide extending from Collinsville in the north to south of Moura in Central Queensland. It contains about 70% of Queensland's coal. These are deposits of the Permian age and are the most important commercial deposits in Queensland, producing almost 100% of the State's coking coal and 60% of its thermal coal. In 2006‚Äì2007, Queensland's top ten collieries for production were located in the Bowen Basin. Coal was first discovered in the Bowen Basin by Ludwig Leichhardt who in 1845 observed coal in the bed of the Mackenzie River. After European settlement of the area in the 1860s, coal was found at Blair Athol, in the north of the Basin, and near the present town of Blackwater. A colliery opened at Bluff in 1905, but struggled to remain viable. Successful commercial exploitation in the Bowen Basin did not begin until the 1920s. The search for coal in the Dawson River basin began when Benjamin Dunstan, Assistant Government Geologist, was commissioned to search west of the Rannes Range. In 1899 he reported on a coal seam found in the bed of the Dawson on Nulalbin Station and hoped to prove anthracite coal which was favoured for the ships of the Royal Navy. As news of his discovery spread, there was a scramble for licences and by 1901, 63 leases were registered. However, coal samples tested by the Royal Navy were disappointing. The Queensland Government developed the first coal mine at Baralaba. Development of the mine was dependent on construction of the Dawson Valley railway line, which began into the valley in 1910 and was approaching the river in 1917. The State Coal Mine opened in 1916, supplying coal to the Railway Department of a quality that was increasingly criticised. The flood of 1928 inundated the mine which then closed down. Mount Morgan Gold Mining Company Limited successfully applied for mining leases at the present mine site. By 1921, under the management of Alexander Campbell, the company was mining the Dunstan Seam and sending coal to the boilers at Mount Morgan mine from three tunnels at the rate of a day, with over 90 men employed. The mine temporarily closed in 1929 due to the liquidation of the old Mount Morgan Company, but was re-opened in 1932 by local independent miners working as the Dawson Valley Coal Company on tribute to the new company, Mount Morgan Limited. Mount Morgan resumed control of operations in 1936, improving ventilation and modernising machinery. The Mine had opened four tunnels into the Dunstan Seam and another, unsuccessfully, into the Dawson Seam. Production from these amounted to . This phase of the operation continued until 1944 when working became difficult. Mount Morgan Limited (later its subsidiary Morgan Mining and Industrial Company Pty Ltd) then closed operations in tunnels two, three and four and moved to the new number seven tunnel, continuing operations until 1969. The extant shaft and many of the surface structures on the site date from the second phase of operations that commenced in 1944 at tunnel seven. The headframe and coal bin were constructed in of local timber, with the exception of the four main timber legs. The main legs were turpentine poles from Fraser Island. A large part of the headframe collapsed in 1993. The workshop, electrical and drill store, and winder house were probably built about the same time as the headframe. The compressor house was added to the winding house probably in . The extant screening and crushing plant remains date to the early 1960s. In addition to mining plant, buildings on the site originally included a manager's residence, electrician's residence, three three-bedroom cottages, single men's quarters and another dwelling. None of these buildings remain extant. After , when the mine was mechanised, mining changed from the bord and pillar system to the breast method. A diesel locomotive and skips transported the coal from the chutes to an underground pocket from where it was hoisted to the surface. In 1968 54 men were employed. Trial export shipments to Japan and Holland occurred in 1961 and 1962, and production peaked in 1965 at , 40% of which was exported. Small amounts were also sent to Malaysia and Thailand. Exports of per annum through the port of Gladstone continued till 1968. Work ceased at the mine in 1969, with the conversion of the Mount Morgan reverberatory furnace to oil firing, and the development of better situated export coal mines. By June 1968 the three areas worked in the Baralaba district had produced of coal. Mount Morgan Limited was acquired by Peko Wallsend Ltd in 1968, which closed the colliery on 9 March 1969.  Description  The former Dawson Valley Colliery is located in the southern Bowen Basin, south-west of Rockhampton and west of Gladstone. It is situated on the right bank of the Dawson River within the Baralaba town limits. Harcourt and Morgan Streets run into the site. There are about fourteen structures on the site, many relatively intact and others in a ruined state. There are also a number of moveable items associated with the former mine such as underground locomotives. Timber and corrugated iron are the main building materials. Floors are of concrete, timber and earth. The main extant structures are: the headframe; crushing and screening plant; surface crib room; fan house; winder and compressor house; transformer yard; block making plant; electrical and drill store; workshop; fuel, pipe and electrical detonator sheds; change-house; toilet block; explosives magazine; and detonator magazine. = Headframe and shaft = This structure comprises a quite intact coal bin with inclined tramway to a shaft covered with mesh. The headframe and the conveyor to the crushing plant and loaders are in ruins to the east of the coal bin. The coal bin is a large box-like structure with an open top raised on stumps about three metres above the ground. It has exposed studs and bracing with wooden board infill and flooring. Extending from the west of the bin on an incline from the top of the bin to the ground is a tramway supported on a wooden frame. The tramway consists of three steel rails: two are laid quite close together with respect to the third. Towards the top of the tramway, running alongside the rails are the remains of a ladder. The wreckage of the headframe contains the remains of the tippler mechanism and the rails on which the coal skips ran. These remain relatively intact. At the bottom of the headframe is a long steel \\"I\\" beam with sliding winch block used to move coal skips onto and off the underground tramway. = Crushing and screening plant = This plant consists of three main parts: a separating and crushing plant; and two screening plants with freestanding coal bins. The separating and crushing plant is located immediately to the north of the headframe. A collapsed conveyor is located between the headframe and this plant. A crusher, made of steel, is mounted in a two level wooden frame with a flat corrugated iron roof. It sits above a hopper constructed of wooden planks. A steel chute at the top of the crusher funnels the coal into two layers of angled vibrating wire screens powered via a belt and an electric motor. From here, oversized coal slides across the top screen into a crushing mechanism and onto a conveyor. The screening and crushing mechanism is intact. An operator's platform and electrical switchgear is intact at the south of the plant. A damaged conveyor supported on a steel frame made of angle iron starts at the bottom of the crushing plant and slopes upward to end in mid-air above the remains of a screening plant. The belt of the conveyor is missing except for a portion at the upper end. This is draped over a wide pulley wheel at the very end of the conveyor. The pulley wheel is powered via a chain (still extant) and an electric motor mounted on a frame above it. The first screening plant, which is mostly ruined, comprises a screening mechanism resting on the ground surrounded by, and partly covered with collapsed wooden beams. The screening mechanism consists of a steel bin with a mesh floor, sitting on a base of steel girders. The bin is attached to the base by pivots and coiled steel springs. This enables the bin to be rocked backwards and forwards on its base. A partly collapsed steel framed conveyor leads from this plant to the top of a second screening plant and bin. The second screening plant consists of a large bin constructed of heavy wooden planks, with a wide, open top tapering to a long, narrow chute at the bottom with two discharge trapdoors. This is supported on a wooden frame. There is a platform on the east side covered by a corrugated iron skillion roof. Steel drive shafts extend from the platform to the trapdoors at the bottom of the chute. A ladder with wooden runners and steel rungs is fixed to the side of the structure reaching to the top. Panels of steel mesh lie on the ground underneath the bin. = Surface crib room = The surface crib room and stores are located next to the headframe and shaft. It consists of a small, three roomed building, rectangular in plan view, with a wooden frame clad with corrugated iron and rough concrete floors. It has a skillion roof. A space of approximately between the north wall and the roof is in-filled with mesh. Two doors at the south elevation provide access to the two rooms comprising the core of the building; the doors are ledge and brace. Window openings at the south, east and west elevations are covered with hinged corrugated iron flaps. There is a veranda at the north elevation; a portion of this has been enclosed to form a third, small room. A door, clad with corrugated iron, opens through the north wall of this room. Wooden benches at about waist height line most of the walls of the larger room. Long, low wooden seats are fixed to these. The smaller of the other two rooms has a wooden floor. There are no fixed furnishings in these rooms. An electric copper converted from a drum is located in an open veranda at the north western corner of the building. = Fan house = The fan house is located south of the headframe. It mostly consists of a large cylindrical, steel fan housing mounted on concrete plinths. The eastern end of the housing is flared and open; a large multi- bladed fan is visible inside. A smaller, hollow plinth supports this end of the housing; a smaller fan is visible inside. The west end of the housing becomes square in cross-section and tapers to a wedge shape. A larger concrete plinth supports this end of the housing. A small, open ended corrugated iron structure mounted on top of the housing contains an electric motor. Attached to the south side of the plinth is a small, wood framed shed with a gabled roof; it is clad with corrugated iron. This contains a concrete footing, switchboard, control panel switchboard, and a vacuum gauge. = Winder and compressor house = The winder and compression house is located approximately to the east of the headframe. Overall dimensions are about . It consists of two joined, gable roofed sheds of equal size. They have wooden frames and are clad with corrugated iron and asbestos sheeting. The roof lines of both sheds run north to south. The main entrances into the building are via the north elevation. Two large ledge and brace wooden doors open into the east shed which houses the compressor equipment. A tall rectangular window opens above each of these. To the right of the doors a smaller opening provides access to the west shed which houses the winding equipment. There is a small skillion roofed room, clad with corrugated iron and asbestos sheeting, projecting from the front of the building to the right of this door. Access into this room is via a door at the west end. A long narrow opening runs the full length of the east elevation. This is covered with steel mesh and shaded by a sloping corrugated iron awning. An air receiver (a long cylinder for holding pressurised gas) is located beside the building next to this elevation. It is about long. There are two windows opening into the south elevation. Both are covered with corrugated iron. A rusted corrugated iron water tank elevated on a wooden stand is located close to the wall of the west half of the elevation. The west elevation has a large rectangular opening through which the drums of the winders are visible. Some corrugated iron sheeting to the left of this opening is missing. To the right, there is a narrow skillion roofed, corrugated iron extension. The interior of the shed housing the winding gear contains the double drum winding engine with cable extant on the drums, a platform and controls for the driver, a large electric motor and electrical switch gear including the main circuit breaker for underground. These are all intact. The floor is concrete except where the cable spools are located; here the floor is dirt. A small annex to this shed contains the air supply for the braking mechanism on the winding engine. It contains an air receiver tank and electric motor. The compressor shed contains a single cylinder, dual acting compressor powered by an electric motor, a three-cylinder compressor, a large main switchboard and separate switchboards for the main fan and one of the compressors. All are intact. The floor is concrete. = Transformer yard = Immediately to the south of the winding and compressor house is an enclosed electrical supply yard. The yard is fenced with wooden posts and chain wire mesh with strands of barbed wire near the top. Entry into the yard is via double, steel framed gates with chain wire mesh infill. A small white coloured metal sign on the gate bears the words \\"Danger 22,000 Volts\\" in red lettering. Just inside the gates is a pair of tall wooden posts joined at the top by a steel beam. Beyond this and running down the centre of the yard is a row of four tall wooden posts joined at the top and at mid-height by wooden beams. The two end posts are taller than the rest and have short wooden cross-arms near the top. A single transformer is located at the north east corner of the yard. There are wooden posts around it; these are joined at the top and at mid-height by wooden beams. Electrical insulators are mounted on the uppermost beams. = Block making plant = This is located just to the east of the winder and compressor house. It is a small skillion roofed, timber framed structure, about , partially clad with corrugated iron. The west two-thirds of the structure are open sided. The roof is supported by wooden posts; wooden rails attached with fencing wire to the posts at about quarter height and at half height surround the open area with the exception of a section in the middle of the west side. A small cantilevered skillion extends from half of the west end of the roof. Beneath the skillion is a concrete footing supporting a steel frame made of angle iron; a small electric motor is located next to the east side of the footing under the main roof. The east third of the structure is enclosed with corrugated iron to form two rooms. The larger west room has wooden shelving on two sides and a concrete floor. It is accessed via a door in the east elevation. The south room, accessed through a door in the south elevation has a concrete floor and is empty. The top third of the west wall of the enclosure, under the skillion roof, is open and in- filled with chain wire mesh. = Electrical and drill store = This building is located about north west of the winder and compressor house. Its overall dimensions are approximately . It is a large shed with a wooden frame, gable roof and corrugated iron cladding; the roof line runs east‚Äìwest. There are door openings at the east and west elevations and window openings along the long, north and south elevations. All window and door openings are shaded by narrow strips of sheet metal, the windows have wooden sills. Many are covered with sheets of corrugated iron. Some are metal framed sash windows; others have no window frames or glazing. Remnants of wooden boards run along the tops of the north and south elevations. The west elevation has an unpainted wooden barge board. There is no guttering on the roof. Internally the building is divided into three: the electrical store, a central room and the drill and hardware store. The floor is concrete. The electrical store is located at the western end of the building. It contains only one set of wooden shelves, located at the eastern wall. There is an assortment of electrical parts and equipment scattered on the floor and against the walls. The larger room at the western end is the drill and hardware store. There are six sets of \\"pigeon box\\" shelves fixed to the west, north and east walls. A short wooden wall at right angles to the south wall creates a bay where drill bits and legs for air drills are stored. Some of the shelves are labelled with chalk to indicate the names and sizes of items. Many parts and items of equipment remain extant in this area. = Workshop = The workshop is located immediately to the north of the electrical and drill store. It is a long wood framed building measuring about with corrugated iron cladding. The roof has a very low pitch consisting of two skillion roofs that overlap at the apex. There are three door openings along the north elevation and a single door opening at the east elevation. Some sections of sheeting are missing along this side; in some places the gap has been in-filled with steel mesh. Window openings along the south elevation have been covered with sheets of corrugated iron. The interior encloses a large open space and four small rooms. It contains three workbenches, a drill stand, a shelf with nuts, bolts and spare parts, a lathe bed and an air receiver (about ). A largely intact, Jenbach JW15 underground locomotive and spare locomotive engine are also located in the workshop. There are four small rooms in the workshop. The plumber's store contains shelves holding assorted plumbing fittings. The hose store contains a few coils of air hose sitting on pallets. The miscellaneous store contains an electric motor, pump impellers and machinery bearing blocks. The fourth room contains rock dust or cement in some 24 bags, a large galvanised iron funnel, bag hooks and unused railway car couplings. This room has an elevated loading platform with a wood board floor. = Fuel, pipe and electrical detonator sheds = These three sheds are joined to form a single composite structure. All have skillion roofs. They consist of the fuel shed, a wooden framed, corrugated iron shed; the pipe rack storage cage, an open sided structure with a corrugated iron roof; and the detonator store, a small weatherboard shed elevated on short stumps. The fuel shed is raised on short stumps and has a wooden floor. Access into the shed is via ledge and brace doors in the west elevation. Windows open into the north and south elevations. These are covered with corrugated iron sheeting. Benches are located against two walls in the interior. There is shelving beneath three benches containing various machine parts. Parts are also lying on the floor. Chalk marks on the walls indicate oil types. The west wall of the pipe rack storage cage is common with the fuel shed. Approximately of the upper section of this wall is not clad and is in-filled with steel mesh. The other three sides have no cladding and are enclosed with steel mesh. Horizontal boards at approximately one-third and two-thirds height are attached to all sides outside the mesh. A steel framed mesh gate provides access through the south elevation. Internally, much of the space is occupied by a steel rack comprising three vertical posts, each with several projecting, flat horizontal prongs. The detonator store is about square and high. The door into the shed is located in the south elevation. The interior is lined with sheeting. = Change house = This building is a long wooden framed gabled roof structure clad in corrugated asbestos sheeting. The walls on all sides are painted in the traditional Mount Morgan tri-colour, light green/pale yellow, a black band and ochre. Entry into the building is gained through two ledge and brace doors towards the eastern end of the north elevation and a single ledge and brace door at the western end of the south elevation. There are two windows in each elevation. They are wooden framed sash windows with four glazed panels. The windows on the north and south elevation have curved, galvanised iron hoods. The interior of the building is divided into four rooms, roughly equal in size: lamp room, drying room, shower room and change room. All have concrete floors. The interior of the lamp room is unlined. It has benches around most of the walls; there are shelves beneath two of these. There is hinged counter that pivots up to close an opening in the wall beneath sash windows. The interior of the drying room is unlined. A low bench is fitted to the walls and a three sided standing frame with seats and clothes hanging pegs is arranged around a centrally located Metters Jumbo fire heater. All seats have boot racks beneath them. Clothes hanging pegs are fitted to the walls. The shower room is divided into three parts consisting of a central corridor with communal shower areas on each side. The corridor is separated from the shower areas by elevated partition walls. Five shower heads are extant in each of the shower areas and two hand basins in the corridor. The change room has a concrete floor and is fully lined with Masonite. There is a low hardwood bench around the interior walls and three evenly spaced standing frames with back to back seats and eight clothes hanging pegs on each side. All seats have boot racks below them. The walls also have clothes hanging pegs. There are two water tanks on high stands at the eastern elevation. One is raised higher than the other. Another water tank at the west elevation is set on a low stand. A boiler stands some distance from the north of the building. It is connected to the change house by a long length of water pipe, raised more than two metres above the ground. = Toilet block = The toilet block is located immediately to the east of the change house. It is a small wooden building with a corrugated iron, gabled roof. It consists of two sections: about one third of the eastern part of the building comprises a single room; the rest of the building consists of the lavatory. The building is clad with weatherboard. There are three entrances into the building. Ledge and brace doors open into the west and east elevations. At the south elevation, there is an opening into a small porch. Two four paned sash windows open into the south and north elevations at the east end. Rows of small, high, frosted glass windows open into the south and north elevations at the lavatory end. The small porch provides access to a corridor from which access is gained to a room containing a urinal and wash basin and two lavatory cubicles. The doors into the cubicles are ledge and brace. Urinal, pedestals and wash basin are extant. This end of the building is lined with vertical wooden boards. The small room at the other end of the building is unlined. The room contains a wooden bench, some shelving and a wooden locker.

It consists of a small inner weatherboard building with a corrugated iron, gabled roof within a wooden framed outer shed clad with corrugated iron. The outer structure also has a gabled roof. Both structures are elevated on short stumps. The door into the outer structure is located at one of the end elevations. The word \\"Explosives\\" is marked with red letters above the door. The walls at the side elevations and the other end elevation do not reach the roof, leaving a gap of approximately . The inner building is lined with vertical wooden boards. It has a ledge and brace door and small square windows into each gable. = The detonator magazine = This is located a short distance south of the magazine. It is a small wooden framed structure in a ruined state. It is approximately one metre high and one metre on each side. Partly clad with corrugated iron, it had a skillion roof which is no longer extant. A low concrete curb surrounds the structure. A small, partly ruined ledge and brace door is located at the west elevation. Mine related artefacts extant on the site include two coal skips, a timber skip, two underground locomotives (including the one in the workshop), ore cars, transformer, jinker, air winch, and air receiver. An assortment of tools and parts are located in the electrical and drill store including: drill bits, a jack hammer, block and tackle and various electrical parts and equipment. The structures and artefacts are in a large site, set in open woodland. Shrubs and small trees are interspersed among the structures. Residences of the Baralaba Township are located close to the east boundary of the site.  Heritage listing  The former Dawson Valley Colliery was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 18 September 2009 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. The Dawson Valley Colliery (1921 - 1969) is important in demonstrating the evolution of Queensland's coal mining history. As the first successful underground coal mine in the Dawson River Valley and one of the first in the Bowen Basin, it provides important evidence of early commercial coal mining in these areas. The Bowen Basin is Queensland's largest and most productive coal field. The mine is also important in demonstrating the development of coal mining techniques in Queensland. It is typical, in scale and type, of mines prior to the late 1950s. Underground mines like the Dawson Valley Colliery became less common during the 1960s following the introduction of large-scale open cut methods. The place demonstrates rare, uncommon or endangered aspects of Queensland's cultural heritage. The former colliery is one of only two relatively intact former mines known to be extant from the underground phase of coal mining in the Bowen Basin. It is also uncommon in Queensland for its relatively high level of intactness. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of Queensland's history. The former colliery is significant for the potential the site has in providing information on underground coal mining and its working conditions and about the use of evolving technology in the coal mining industry in Queensland. As an extensive industrial landscape produced by the shafts, abandoned machinery and structures, the colliery is important as an archaeological site with the potential to yield further information about the layout and use of the mine site. The place has a special association with the life or work of a particular person, group or organisation of importance in Queensland's history. The former colliery is important for its association with Mount Morgan Gold Mining Company Limited and Mount Morgan Limited. The Baralaba mine was initially developed to provide fuel for the boilers and smelters at Mount Morgan Mine, and later produced coal for export. It provides evidence of the scale of operations at Mount Morgan, once Australia's most productive gold and copper mine and it contributes to our knowledge of the company's interests beyond the Mount Morgan mine. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. The former colliery is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of the above ground layout and structures of a typical underground coal mine of the mid-twentieth century. Most above ground structures associated with the mine are extant, many of them relatively intact and containing equipment. Structures include: surface crib room; fan house; winder and compressor house; transformer yard; block making plant; electrical and drill store; workshop; fuel, pipe and electrical detonator sheds; change- house; toilet block; explosives magazine; and detonator magazine. The head frame is extant, but partially collapsed. Also extant on the site are a range of artefacts associated with the mine consisting mainly of underground locomotives, coal skips and coal cars. The mine is an excellent example of the mining process and living conditions associated with underground mines of the period.

The picturesque cottage is one of a group of ten built around 1810 as retirement homes for the servants of a wealthy banker. Location The land on which the cottage stands is part of an estate purchased by John Scandrett Harford, a banker, for ¬£13,000 in 1789. Harford had a substantial house built and asked the landscape architect Humphry Repton to lay out the grounds. Repton became a partner of John Nash, whom Harford commissioned to design a group of cottages as homes for his retired servants. Nash created sketches of the cottages, which George Repton built. The cottages surround an open green. Each cottage faces the green and has a separate back garden. They were described by Pevsner as \\"...the nec plus ultra of picturesque layout and design\\". When built, the cottages would have been set in open country. Since then the group of cottages has been surrounded by a high wall, which hides the modern housing around them. The hamlet became a National Trust property in 1943. Diamond Cottage was made a listed building, grade I: buildings of exceptional interest, on 8 January 1959. It is listed as 901-1/20/1341, no. 2 Blaise Hamlet, Diamond Cottage on Hallen Road. The exterior has been carefully restored, while the interior has been modernised and is still occupied. The cottage is rented by the National Trust. Description The picturesque style Diamond Cottage was built in 1812. It is faced with random rubble. The hipped roof is tiled in stone, and has two diagonally-set brick chimney stacks to the rear. On two sides there is a pent roof over a deep coved eave, with a leaded lattice casement in each wall. The cottage is entered from the left through a plank door in a porch with a pitched roof. Before renovation it had a kitchen, sitting room, scullery and outside lavatory. The attic with a half dormer is reached by a dogleg stairway. The cottage interior was modernised around 1975.

His directorial debut, Beyond the Hill won the Caligari Film Prize in the 62nd Berlinale and Best Film at the Asia Pacific Screen Awards. His second feature Frenzy won the Special Jury Prize after premiering in competition at the 72nd Venice International Film Festival.  Life  During his university years, Emin Alper was an active member of the cinema club at Boƒüazi√ßi University, spending most of his time with friends thinking on and discussing about cinema. They would organize seminars with the prominent filmmakers of their time, Nuri Bilge Ceylan and Zeki Demirkubuz. He began writing scripts and film reviews. Together with his friends, he published the film magazine ‚ÄúG√∂r√ºnt√º.‚Äù It was during his university years that his lifelong love for cinema shaped, persuading him to pursue filmmaking as a career. After graduating from the university with a degree in Economics, Alper furthered his Academic work, receiving his PhD in Modern Turkish History. Emin Alper subsequently began teaching at the Department of Social Science at Istanbul Technical University. He wrote on cinema and politics at several magazines including Tarih ve Toplum, Birikim, Mesele and Altyazƒ±.  Filmography  Gaining experience from watching other filmmakers and taking role in their short films, Emin Alper went on to make his first independent short films, The Letter in 2005, and Rƒ±fat in 2006; the latter won Best Short Film at the Bucharest International Film Festival (2008) and the Special Audience Award at the !F Istanbul International Film Festival. His breakthrough came in 2012, with his directorial debut, Beyond the Hill, ‚Äúabout the repressed violence and projections of a Turkish family on holiday.\\" Following his first feature, Alper made his second feature, Frenzy (2014), a psycho-social drama/thriller about a society‚Äú brought to heel by its fear of terrorism‚Äù in which two brothers ‚Äî one a paroled convict secretly recruited to ferret out terrorists by examining the contents of trash bins, the other hired to kill stray dogs ‚Äî are sucked into a whirl of state-sponsored distrust. Frenzy was profoundly timely in its subject matter, loudly echoing the current turmoil of politics in Turkey and the Middle East. Alper says of Frenzy, ‚ÄòIt shows how the political system turns ‚Äúlittle men‚Äù into the cogs of its violent mechanism by providing them with authority and the instruments of violence, which in the end turn against them and lead to their destruction.‚Äô Premiering in competition at the 72nd Venice International Film Festival, Frenzy was awarded the Special Jury Prize. The film won the Jury Grand Prize at the 9th Asia Pacific Screen Awards. Both Beyond the Hill and Frenzy were chosen as the Best Turkish Film by the Turkish Critics' Association in 2012 and 2015.  Influences  At 18, Emin Alper was stirred upon watching Kustorica‚Äôs Time of the Gypsies, which made him, in his own words, ‚Äúaware of the magic of cinema.‚Äù He is influenced by the works of Luchino Visconti, Rainer Werner Fassbinder and Michael Haneke.

It was built from onwards . It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992.  History  Greycliffe Homestead is a slab dwelling formerly on Greycliffe pastoral station and relocated to Biloela where it has served as the headquarters of the Banana Shire Historical Society since 1979. Ludwig Leichhardt explored the Callide and Dawson Valleys in 1844. Thomas Archer took up Eidsvold pastoral run and Charles Archer moved further north settling in the region of what is now Biloela. Other European pastoralists soon followed them in the 1850s, when this district was still a part of New South Wales (prior to the separation of Queensland in 1859). In 1863 Frederick Barton took up Greycliffe. It is not certain when William Nott moved onto the run, but in 1871 he married Sophia Collins. Their first two children died, but in November 1875 Helen Brenda Nott was born and as she was the only one of their subsequent children not to have been born on Greycliffe, the Nott family may have moved to Greycliffe in 1876. In January 1877 Alfred David became the first of seven more children born on the property. In 1878 the lease was transferred to Frederick Brackner, but in 1879 Nott acquired the lease himself. In 1884 he took up further land and in later years further leases extended the run. The original form of the house was a large rectangular room with a fireplace at one end. This was extended and eventually included two bedrooms separated by a passage in the core section, an encircling verandah with subsidiary rooms and a detached kitchen. The rooms were ceiled with stretched calico and walls were decorated by gluing chintz directly to the timber. In 1903, William Nott died and the eldest of his surviving sons, William Ingliss, managed the property. His two brothers and a sister, Emma, served overseas in World War I while another sister, Jessie, helped to run the station. In the 1920s the homestead was repaired and the roof shingles were replaced by corrugated iron sheeting. In 1923, Frederic Nott and his family moved to Darling Plain and in 1924, Bill Nott also moved away, although Greycliffe remained in the family. In 1929 Sophia Nott died aged 83. Emma and a nephew, Robin Nott, lived on the property. In 1972 she died at the age of 92, being the last person to live in the homestead building. When Robin Nott also died, his wife and sons took over the running of the property. It was sold in the late 1970s. After the sale of Greycliffe station, the Banana Shire Historical Society feared that the vacant homestead might decay or catch fire. They therefore acquired the building in 1979 and removed it from the site in two sections. At the time this approach to preserving buildings was considered by many to be a valid way to save places valued by the community. It was relocated away at Gladstone Road, Biloela where it became premises for the Society. It is open to the public by arrangement. The detached kitchen has not survived the move.  Description  The former Greycliffe homestead is now located on the corner of Gladstone Road and Lawrence Street, Biloela. The site has several other buildings on it including a slab hut, a new timber shelter for machinery and a concrete toilet block. The homestead is a single storey timber building set on low timber stumps. The roof is hipped and clad in corrugated iron. The house is constructed of timber slabs on a pole frame and has an encircling verandah incorporating subsidiary rooms. There is a tourist office in the room on the front left hand side of the verandah. The rear verandah has storage rooms and a kitchen. At least one room has a modern steel security door and some rooms are lined with modern material. The core of the building consists of a large living room with a fireplace at one end. This has a simple timber mantelpiece and is brick lined. There are two bedrooms separated by a passage. The fabric ceilings have not survived the removal. There are timber steps to the front of the building and the rear is reached by a ramp.

It was built in 1884. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992.  History  The buildings comprising Kilbirnie homestead are a series of vernacular timber structures erected by the Campbell family in the 19th and early 20th centuries. Ludwig Leichhardt explored the Callide and Dawson Valleys in 1844. Thomas Archer took up Eidsvold pastoral run and Charles Archer moved further north settling in the region of what is now Biloela. Other European pastoralists soon followed them in the 1850s, when this district was still a part of New South Wales (as the separation of Queensland did not occur until 1859). In 1869, the Department of Public Lands authorised the opening for selection of land from the runs of Winterbourne and Thalberg on the headwaters of Callide Creek. They were approximately 23 square miles each. A Promise of Lease for the two areas passed quickly through several hands, but in 1877 both runs were leased to Thomas Cadell. Settlement in the area prospered and the service town of Banana was established in the 1860s. In 1880 the Banana Divisional Board was formed. On 12 May 1883 John Campbell applied for a 10-year lease on an area of 12 square miles from the Thalberg run under the Settled Districts Pastoral Leases Act of 1876. Campbell had arrived in Brisbane in 1873 when he was 23 years old. Soon after his arrival, he married his fiancee, Elizabeth Brydges, who had accompanied him from Ireland. After working briefly on a sugar plantation on the Mary River, he obtained a position working as a shepherd and general hand for Robert Bell on Dumgree Station. While working at Dumgree, Campbell obtained sheep of his own and ran them on land rented from Bell. Capital from the sale of these sheep allowed the Campbells to set up their own property. In 1884 Campbell was granted a 10-year lease for his selected land, which he called Kilburnie. After having prepared the materials needed, he began to construct a six roomed house, stockyard and fences on the land, with help from a bush carpenter named Bryce Kilpatrick. In 1885, when the house was completed, he was able to move his wife and children from Dumgree to their new home. The following year, 6 square miles, being about half of the Kilbirnie run was resumed. Campbell protested this on the grounds that it was unwatered and therefore unsuitable for selection. He was allowed to exercise his right of grazing on the land and in 1889 was offered an Occupation License for the resumed portion and subsequently held occupation licenses for the whole. Campbell raised cattle and Clydesdale horses at Kilbirnie and by 1892 had constructed stables and other outbuildings and had a horse paddock and a paddock under cultivation. He had also erected about of fencing. The first house had been built directly on the ground and suffered extensive white ant damage, so that it was moved and rebuilt in 1901. It was possibly at this time that the rear of the building was clad in weatherboards. In 1902 a license to erect a hayshed and stockyard and to make a dam was granted. In 1903 a license to erect a house of 12 rooms was approved, the former house being now used as a kitchen wing. At this time, Kilbirnie was also a coach stop. Until Biloela was founded in 1924, Banana was the main town in the district. From 1897, mail had been delivered to the area by G H (Bob) Fry. By the early 1900s, demand was sufficient for him to operate a 3-seater wagonette, known locally as Fry's mail coach, over the route between Gladstone and Banana. This took two days and the coach stopped at Kilbirnie for morning tea and a change of horses. This service continued until made redundant in 1928. In 1921 an anomaly was discovered between the land described officially as Kilbirnie and the land actually worked by Campbell. This was resolved in favour of the land in use. In 1924, were resumed in connection with the Burnett Settlement Scheme. At the time the property had grown to 48 square miles by the addition of land held by occupation lease. Elizabeth Campbell died in 1913 after having had eight children. John Campbell died in 1943 at the age of 98. The house continued in the ownership of family members, although it was unoccupied for some 20 years from the 1970s and an overseer was employed to care for the property. A new generation of family members, great grandchildren of John and Elizabeth Campbell, were later living in the house.  Description  Kilbirnie homestead is close to the Boundary Hill Mine Road and consists of a complex of timber residential and working buildings including a house, detached kitchen and several sheds. The site also has two graves. The main dwelling is a timber house raised on high timber stumps, which has had rooms built underneath. It has a hipped roof clad in corrugated iron. There is an encircling verandah to the upper level with a separate roof supported on timber posts. Subsidiary L-shaped bedrooms are built into each corner of the verandah so that there is an open section in the centre of each elevation. The handrail across these verandah sections is timber, with steel mesh filling the area below. This upper floor contains a living room, main bedroom and two smaller bedrooms in the core section. Original decorative colour schemes survive and include stencilled stylised iris on the upper walls of the living room and a stencilled dado in the bedroom to the north. On the ground floor the central section between the stumps is built in with vertical corrugated iron sheeting, creating four rooms including a dining room and storerooms. The area surrounding this core is concreted and serves as a verandah. There is a detached bathroom beside the house at the northwest corner. This is constructed of ripple iron with a curved corrugated iron roof. To the rear of the house, and connected with it by a covered walkway, is a single storey slab and weatherboard building set on low timber stumps. It has a gabled roof clad in corrugated iron. A verandah runs between two projecting rooms along the long axis of the building facing the house. The rear of the building and the rear portion of the southern end have been clad in weatherboard. This building serves as a detached kitchen building, though it contains other rooms. The kitchen has been extended at the northern end and also into the verandah room on the northeast corner. Internal walls of corrugated iron divide the rest of the building into a store and large nursery room. This room has a series of polychrome stencils of \\"Japanese\\" figures and birds applied as a frieze. The residential buildings are separated from the working buildings by a timber picket fence. There are three sheds surrounding a yard area to the rear of the kitchen building. The shed on the southern side of the yard has a pole frame and a hipped roof clad in corrugated iron. Two walls are of drop log construction and the building is open on two sides. The shed to the west of the yard is a rectangular building with a gabled roof and shallow side aisles, the southern side of which is open, the roof being supported by timber posts. The roof is clad in corrugated iron, as is the western wall. It has a pole frame and has walls variously of timber and corrugated iron. The building to the north of the yard has a gabled roof clad with corrugated iron and has a skillion roofed extension on its northern side. The main part of the building is constructed of dropped slabs with vertical slabs to the extension. The wall on the southern side has gates into the yard and this building may have housed animals. To the north of the complex are the burials of Elizabeth Campbell, who died in 1913, and of John Campbell, who died in 1943. The graves have matching headstones and are enclosed by decorative iron railing protected by a modern steel pipe enclosure.  Heritage listing  Kilbirnie Homestead was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. Kilbirnie homestead illustrates the pattern of early European exploration and settlement of Queensland where the development of pastoral properties preceded agriculture and the establishment of towns. As an early homestead in the Leichhardt Pastoral District, which has remained in use, it has associations with the development of the pastoral industry in Queensland. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. Kilbirnie homestead complex provides a record of an evolving pastoral property from the slab buildings of first settlement in the 1880s to a comfortable house of sawn timber. It demonstrates the principal characteristics of such a homestead group well, comprising a main house with detached kitchen, associated outbuildings, graves and fences and illustrates the building techniques traditionally used for these. The place has a special association with the life or work of a particular person, group or organisation of importance in Queensland's history. Kilbirnie homestead has a special association with the life and work of four generations of the Campbell family who, as early pastoralists, contributed to the development of the area.

A prolific writer and author, Jegede‚Äôs career highlights comprise his extensive work of over 13 years at the United Nations International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (UNICTR), and advocacy work in international criminal law through the Legal Watch and Human Rights Initiative, a registered non-profit organization he co- founded. His work at the UNICTR mainly revolved around the investigation and prosecution of some of the known masterminds of the egregious crimes committed during the Rwandan genocide. His perspectives of the historical events which led to the Rwandan genocide and the ground breaking case law generated by the UNICTR established to prosecute those who bear the greatest responsibility for the genocide are documented in his book, ‚ÄúThe Rwandan Genocide: Historical Background and Jurisprudence‚Äù . In the book, Jegede provides a riveting account of the pre-genocide history of Rwanda, including the often overlooked elements that make the Rwandan genocide one of the worst human tragedies of our time. Through the cases, in an engaging and candid style, the Author reveals several ground breaking decisions of the UNICTR such as the pronouncement of rape as genocide and the conviction of a woman for rape as a crime against humanity. Jegede serves as a consultant for the International Labour Organization (ILO) on human trafficking issues and the National Human Rights Commission.  Domestic and International Legal Career  Jegede‚Äôs legal career commenced in 1984 when he was enrolled as a Barrister and Solicitor of the Supreme Court of Nigeria. After serving briefly as a State Counsel at the Federal Ministry of Justice, and later as Associate Counsel in the law firm of Duro Ajayi and Co, Jegede in 1988, set up the law firm, Segun Jegede and Company which was devoted to the practice of civil and criminal litigation. Ten years later, In April 1998, Jegede was taken on board by the United Nations following the establishment of the UNICTR. He thus became one of the first pioneers of the UNICTR tasked with investigating the key perpetrators of genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes committed between January and December 1994. The well documented tragedy aside, an integral part of the nationwide investigations carried out by Jegede and his colleagues was a national survey on rape and sexual assault adjudged to have been extensively committed as part of a widespread attack against the civilian Tutsi population over the course of the genocide. At the end of the preliminary investigations, Jegede, along with other professionals set about drafting the indictments for the trials which followed at the seat of the UNICTR in Arusha, Tanzania.  The Trials  Among other high-profile cases, Jegede helped to prosecute the Military I and II Trials which featured some of the most senior military personnel behind the deliberate plan to exterminate the Tutsis. Jegede also prosecuted Munyakazi Yusuf, founder and financier of the dreaded Interahamwe militia in Cyangugu Province, and Gregoire Ndahimana, the Mayor responsible for the deaths of over 1500 persons after he ordered the demolition of the Nyange parish church building in which beleaguered Tutsi civilians were sheltered. The trials involved several hundreds of witnesses including experts in different fields and a number of notable killers who had acquired a considerable degree of notoriety during the genocide. Jegede was responsible for the examination and cross examination of scores of these witnesses. Among the major witnesses examined by Jegede were: the late Dr. Alison Des Forges, foremost historian and expert in Rwandan History whose testimony lasted an entire three trial weeks; Dr Kubic, a renowned ballistician; defendants such as the commander of the reconnaissance battalion; and Yusuf Munyakazi, leader of the interahamwe militia in Cyangugu province.  Chairman of UNICTR Staff Rebuttal Panel  For a major part of Jegede‚Äôs 13-year stint at the UNICTR, he was pro bono Chairman of the Staff Rebuttal Panel responsible for the resolution of staff disputes with the management of the Tribunal.  United Nations Dispute Tribunal  In 2009, the United Nations General Assembly reformed its internal judicial system and established a new court known as the United Nations Dispute Tribunal. Jegede is a pro bono Counsel before the reformed tribunal. In Gakumba v Secretary General United Nations, Jegede successfully argued Mr Gakumba‚Äôs case and secured judgment for him. In its judgment, the Tribunal ordered Mr Gakumba‚Äôs reinstatement or in the alternative, two years' net base salary in lieu of reinstatement. In addition, the Dispute Tribunal ordered that the Applicant be paid seven months‚Äô base salary in compensation for the due process and procedural violations.  Education and professional standing  Jegede holds a law degree from the University of Lagos in Nigeria, a diploma in Legal Practice from the Nigerian Law School and a Master of Laws degree from the University of South Africa, Pretoria, South Africa. Jegede has a working knowledge of French and is a member of the following professional bodies ‚Äì Nigerian Bar Association, International Bar Association, Association of International Prosecutors and the Nigerian Society of International Law.
