Animesh then plunges into the Naxalite rebellion that rocked West Bengal in the late 1960s and 1970s. Through the character of the protagonist, Majumdar portrays the tumultuous political history of West Bengal in the post-independence era. The first three novels in the series - Uttoradhikar, Kalbela and Kalpurush - were published between 1979 and 1989. Kalbela was serialized in the prestigious literary magazine Desh in 1981-1982, and won the Sahitya Akademi Prize in 1984. The last book in the series Mousholkal was published in 2013, after a gap of nearly 25 years, as a response to the rise of Mamata Banerjee and the Trinamool Congress. The Animesh series is widely regarded as Samaresh Majumdar's finest work, as well as being one of the most significant works of modern Bengali literature.

Business Founded in 1979, Asian Agri manages 28 palm oil plantations and 20 mills in Sumatra, Indonesia. It has a total oil palm plantation area of 100,000 hectares, and partners with Plasma smallholders responsible for an additional 60,000 and independent smallholders responsible for 41,000 hectares. It employs more than 25,000 employees.http://www.rgei.com/files/media_releases/asian-agri-committed-to- community.pdf Partnerships =PIR-trans and plasma programs= Asian Agri was one of the first companies involved in Indonesia's PIR-Trans (Perkebunan Inti Rakyat-Transmigrasi) program in 1987. The program brought together plantation owners with transmigrated smallholders. Asian Agri developed and implemented the program in Riau and Jambi, Sumatra, facilitating plantation development, developing infrastructure and providing training in best agronomic practices. The company also assisted smallholders in securing bank loans. Smallholders now contribute to half of Asian Agri's total palm oil production. The company has also assisted its partnered smallholders in receiving certification, such as RSPO, International Sustainability and Carbon Certification (ISCC), and Indonesian Sustainable Palm Oil (ISPO). =Independent smallholders= Asian Agri's partnership with smallholders extended to selected independent smallholders. Along with WWF Indonesia, RSPO and the government, the company helped established the Amanah Palm Oil Independent Smallholders Association in 2012. As of 2015, the Amanah Association comprised 349 smallholders managing 763 hectares of land. It is the first independent smallholders cooperative in the country to be RSPO- certified. In March 2016, the Indonesia Agriculture Ministry, the United Nations Development Programme and Asian Agri piloted a 3-month training program for 500 members of the Amanah Association in effective plantation management. SNV Netherlands Development Organisation facilitated the training and technical support. Participants were later independently assessed based on the Indonesian Sustainable Palm Oil (ISPO) standards, before being the pioneer batch of independent smallholders to receive ISPO certification. Sustainability =Fire prevention= Asian Agri implemented a zero burning policy across its operations in 1994 to prevent land by cleared by fire. It became a founding member of the Fire-Free Alliance in early 2016. The Alliance implements the Fire-Free Village Programme, which was pioneered by Asia Pacific Resources International Holdings. Implemented in collaboration with NGOs, government agencies and the police, the programme involves education, training, capacity-building, infrastructure development and incentivization for villages to adopt no-burn practices to land clearing. In parallel with its implementation of the Fire-Free Village Programme, Asian Agri also engages communities through the Masyarakat Peduli Asap program, which similarly promotes fire prevention and best practices in fire management. =Palm oil- related pledges and commitments= At the 2014 United Nations Climate Summit, Asian Agri was a signatory of the New York Declaration on Forests, which commits to halving the rate of deforestation by 2020, and end it by 2030. In parallel, the company also became a signatory of the Indonesian Palm Oil Pledge (IPOP) along with Golden Agri Resources (GAR), Wilmar and Cargill, committing to deforestation-free palm oil cultivation practices in their supply chains. IPOP disbanded on July 1, 2016. In 2015, Asian Agri, along with Apical, partnered The Forest Trust to develop and improve its supply chain traceability. In 2017 Asian Agri achieved 100% traceability of fresh fruit bunches reaching its mills In 2018 Asian Agri became a founding member of The Sustainability Assurance and Innovation Alliance (SUSTAIN), a group of oil palm growers, palm oil processors, consumer goods manufacturers, not-for- profit organizations and technology companies who are using blockchain to improve palm oil traceability = Biogas power plants = In 2015, Asian Agri announced plans to build 20 biogas power plants by 2020.

So much so that his first visit to Paris led him to attend the lectures of Guillaume-Fran√ßois Rouelle. Montet went then to Montpellier in order to follow a pharmacist training. In 1748 he became a member of the '. Later he became demonstrator under Gabriel Fran√ßois Venel whose lecture in chemistry he also benefited.

It was patented in 1959 and introduced in the United States in 1960. It was withdrawn in 1962 due to severe adverse effects such as nausea and vomiting, vision loss due to irreversible cataracts, alopecia, skin disorders (e.g., dryness, itching, peeling, and \\"fish-scale\\" texture), and accelerated atherosclerosis and is now considered to be obsolete. The drug acts by inhibiting 24-dehydrocholesterol reductase, which catalyzes the final step of cholesterol biosynthesis, the conversion of desmosterol into cholesterol. This results in tissue accumulation of desmosterol, which in turn is responsible for the side effects of triparanol. Unlike statins, triparanol does not inhibit HMG-CoA reductase, the rate-limiting enzyme in cholesterol biosynthesis, and in contrast to triparanol, statins can significantly lower cholesterol levels without resulting in accumulation of intermediates like desmosterol. The developmental code name of triparanol, MER/29, became so well known that it became the registered trade name of the drug. Estrogen is known to lower cholesterol levels, but produces side effects like gynecomastia and decreased libido in men. It was hoped that a drug could be developed that lacked overt estrogenic effects but still lowered cholesterol levels. Triparanol is a triphenylethanol and was derived from chlorotrianisene (TACE), a nonsteroidal triphenylethylene estrogen, and the nonsteroidal triphenylethanol antiestrogen ethamoxytriphetol (MER-25) is a derivative of triparanol. The selective estrogen receptor modulator clomifene is also structurally related to triparanol. The developers of triparanol jokingly referred to it as a \\"non- estrogenic estrogen\\".

He is currently professor of British history at Universit√© de Paris (U Paris) and Vice President for International Strategy.  Education and career  Levillain was educated at the √âcole Normale Sup√©rieure in Paris. He holds a BA in History from the Sorbonne (Paris 1) and a degree in Public Law and Administration from Sciences Po. He obtained his PhD from the New Sorbonne University in 2003. Levillain has held fellowships at King's College London (1999-2000), the Netherlands Institute for Advanced Study (2007-2008), Yale University (James Osborne Fellow, 2008-2009), Churchill College, Cambridge (2011), the Casa de Vel√°zquez (2011), the Leibniz Institute of European History (2014), the Humboldt Foundation (2017-2018) and New College, Oxford (2018). He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Historical Society in 2016.  Scholarship  Levillain‚Äôs work focuses primarily on the history of Anglo-Franco-Dutch relations under the late Stuarts, with special interest in the figure of Stadholder-King William III (1650-1702). His first book, Vaincre Louis XIV (2010), about the emergence of the Anglo-Dutch alliance against Louis XIV, was awarded the Prix Guizot by the French Academy (2011). His second book, Un glaive pour un royaume (2014), tells the story of militia debates in Stuart England, explaining that the distinction between standing armies and militias has been exaggerated since the seventeenth century for reasons of political convenience. It was praised as a ‚Äúclear- headed and engrossingly heretical‚Äù contribution to historians' knowledge of standing army debates.Mark Fissel, American Historical Review, vol.120/5, December 2015, pp.1968-1969. More recently, Levillain published Le proc√®s de Louis XIV. Fran√ßois-Paul de Lisola (1613-1674), ennemi de la France et citoyen du monde (2015), which charts the intellectual career of the diplomat and Imperial publicist Fran√ßois-Paul de Lisola, one of Louis XIV‚Äôs fiercest early critics in Europe. Levillain also co-edited a volume on the reception of Louis XIV‚Äôs images outside France between 1661 and 1715, with Tony Claydon.

The short film stars American rappers Scott \\"Kid Cudi\\" Mescudi and Chris \\"Cage\\" Palko as French-speaking serial killers. Mescudi and Palko also co-wrote the film with LaBeouf.  Synopsis  A filmmaker (Shia LaBeouf) documents the exploits of two serial killers (Scott Mescudi and Chris Palko).  Background  Shia LaBeouf first directed a music video for New York-based rapper Cage in 2009, for his track \\"I Never Knew You\\": \\"I'm 22 and I'm directing my favorite rapper's music video,\\" LaBeouf told LA Weekly of the project, \\"This shit is better than riding unicorns.\\" It was through that project that he met Cleveland-bred rapper Kid Cudi, which led to LeBeouf filming and directing Kid Cudi's video for \\"Marijuana\\", which was shot at the 2010 High Times Cannabis Cup in Amsterdam. LeBeouf subsequently went on to collaborate with Cudi and Cage on a short film titled MANIAC. Kid Cudi first spoke of the short film on March 5, 2011, via his Twitter feed, when he announced: \\"[the] maniac horror short will be released on halloween, rager short this summer, marijuana video this spring. i got you guys, no worries.\\" The short film was inspired by Cudi's song of the same name, from his 2010 album Man on the Moon II: The Legend of Mr. Rager and is an homage to the 1992 Belgian black comedy crime mockumentary, Man Bites Dog. In an interview with Complex, Cudi went into detail about the short film, as he discussed how Shia LaBeouf reached out to him to do the project, playing the role of a killer, funding the video and why was it in French: \\"It was me creating the back story for this person in my mind. What you see just seems like senseless acts of crime happening but in my character‚Äôs mind it was always justified. When you watch it, it‚Äôs like, ‚ÄòWhy are these things happening?‚Äô You want answers but there's no answers really given. When I was in character, it was always justified for me.\\" He also added \\"When it came time to shoot, it was as real as possible and you were scared of this character. I literally transformed into this person. I didn‚Äôt talk much on set, didn‚Äôt crack many jokes, I kept to myself.\\" Release On June 3, 2011, Kid Cudi released the first trailer for the short film. On October 31, 2011, in the spirit of Halloween, Kid Cudi released the short film via YouTube.

Life He was the son of William Cruden. He left Scotland and joined John Cruden & Co., run by his uncle John, in Wilmington, North Carolina, before 1770 when his younger brother James also became a partner in the firm. In March 1775 Cruden, a Tory, found his business boycotted, and gave it up. He supplied arms to the Loyalists, who were defeated locally at the Battle of Moore's Creek Bridge in February 1776. After that he took refuge in HMS Jenny of the Royal Navy, and sailed in April for Jamaica. He moved on to the Bahamas, where his uncle John Cruden the elder had gone into exile. Then he went in 1777 to New York. In 1778 Cruden received a commission as lieutenant-colonel from Lord Cornwallis. He became Commissioner for Sequestered Estates under General Henry Clinton, in Charleston which had fallen to the British in 1780. Cruden ran the sequestered estates, for the benefit of the British forces; they had been taken from leading Whigs, such as Ralph Izard, Francis Marion, John Mathews, Arthur Middleton, William Moultrie, Charles Cotesworth Pinckney and John Rutledge. Another plantation owner affected was Henry Laurens, who at this period was held in the Tower of London. On 5 January 1782, Cruden wrote to John Murray, 4th Earl of Dunmore, urging the recruitment by the British military in South Carolina of a force of 10,000 slaves. In April of that year he was responsible for the British attack on Beaufort, North Carolina. In 1783 he was tracking down black Loyalists who had been sold again into slavery. Cruden in early 1784 was in Great Britain, and sailed in the spring back to East Florida. He had plans to destabilise the Spanish control of East Florida; these were thwarted by Patrick Tonyn, who gave his backing to Vicente Manuel de C√©spedes, the Spanish governor. Still Cruden wrote, assiduously, to Carlos III of Spain, seeking support for the Loyalist exiles, now that the American war was over. C√©spedes gave Cruden support in 1785 to sail for Nova Scotia, still looking for backing for the exiles. Then Cruden moved on to Nassau on New Providence in the Bahamas, where he was in May 1786; his uncle went to Exuma. He made his way to Nova Scotia, to see Colonel Thomas Dundas who dealt with Loyalist claims for compensation, being in Halifax on 30 October 1786. Cruden then returned to the Bahamas. In poor physical and mental health, he died there on 18 September 1787, aged 33.

That is, 'since the arrival of the World Wide Web and the spread of mobile communications, mediated connectivity has been quietly normalized as central to a consolidating ‚Äòglobal imaginary‚Äô One aspect of this is the ability of the social media to accumulate economic capital from the users' connections and activities on social media platforms by using certain mechanisms in their architecture. According to several scholars (van Dijck and Poell) \\"it is a key element of social media logic, having a material and metaphorical importance in social media culture\\".This concept originates from the technological term of \\"connectivity\\" but its application to the media field has acquired additional social and cultural implications. The increasing role of social media in everyday life serves as the basis of such connectivity in the 21st century. It shows the interrelations between the users activities on social media and at the same time the empowerment of the social media platforms with the data that was produced by the users and given to those services for granted. Notion of connectivity Connectivity developed with the rise of the Internet, first with the introduction Web 1.0 and later Web 2.0. New improvements in equipment, software, the advancement of speed and access have increased the level and quality of connectivity. Along with these improvements, new media such as social networking systems (e.g. Facebook, Twitter, Google+), websites that provide access to user-generated content (e.g. Youtube, Myspace, Flickr), trading and marketing sites (e.g. Amazon, eBay, Groupon) and also game sites (e.g. FarmVille, The Sims Social) have become an essential part of everyday life of an average user: \\"Just as electricity in the 19th and 20th centuries transformed societies by penetrating every fibre of people‚Äôs personal and professional lives, network connectivity is probably the most powerful transformative force in early 21st- century cultures\\". This made a shift in the understanding of the nature of connectivity and moved the initial focus just from a technical side of the notion to its increasingly acquired techno-socio-cultural character. As mentioned before, connectivity is built on the principles of Web 2.0. that promote an openness, create the vision of empowerment of the user in the generation of a new content and coordination of the information flow on the Internet. These mechanisms encourage staying in touch with each other despite distances and share as much data as possible. According to Youngs, the development of the Internet has resulted in the deeper permeation of ICTs into public and private spheres of peoples' life, their relationships and spheres of identity. Hence, connectivity becomes a resource of maintaining these activities. However, van Dijck notices that this connectivity is not just a neutral feature of new media, but is manufactured by the combination of human and technological resources, where the role of technologies is intransparent. Algorithms and protocols that are part of such platforms prompt users activities and online experiences on social media platforms. One of the most prominent activities on social media includes sharing and as Kennedy argues, \\"sharing rhetoric draws on a cultural image of connectivity. Social media platforms are not the only actors to use such imagining, mobile-based platforms do the same. Network providers, handset manufacturers, and social media platforms each promote social activities of togetherness enabled by their products which evidences a sustained cultural norm of sharing through teletechnologies for the purpose of affective connectivity\\". Therefore, such architecture creates even bigger demand in connectivity that is continuously exploited by the online market. As Jos√© van Dijck notices, connectivity quickly assumed the connotation of users accumulating social capital, while in fact this term increasingly referred to owners amassing economic capital. As the result, social media gain political and economic importance having the power at the levels of grassroots activists, governments, and corporations.  Example of the application of connectivity  Facebook can serve as a good example how connectivity is being produced and exploited by social media. Van Dijck mentions three concepts implemented in the technological side of connectivity which result in the connective structure of the platform and in the creation of its additional social and cultural dimensions. These are platform, protocol and interface. Several scholars (van Dijck, Gillespie) mention in their works the ambiguity of the term \\"platform\\" that promises to bring openness, access, to be neutral and help people build social connections and participate in online activities, but in fact implies a more complicated structure of the media, most of the time created for the profit purposes and as the enhancement of control under the users. As for the protocols and interfaces, the algorithms behind the platform are intransparent and presented to the user as intermediaries for 'staying in touch', being connected, encouraging to make those connections, but at the same time the platform itself \\"facilitates the cultivation of 'weak ties' as well as the fabrication of 'strong ties'\\". Therefore, connectivity becomes a new type of social capital gained from the platform's working principles. Culture of connectivity \\"Culture of connectivity\\" is the term suggested by the Dutch scholar Jos√© van Dijck for defining the contemporary interweaving of the online and offline practices and the omnipresence of social media in modern life. The researcher explained the emergence of this culture as the process that evolved in a rather short period of time and indicated the shift from \\"networked communication to \\"performed\\" sociality, from a participatory culture to culture to connectivity\\". Moreover, the evolution of this culture was one of the parts of the changing processes that took place in private, corporate and public domains.

The stance of a vehicle is determined by its suspension height and the fitment of the wheels in the fender arches. It may refer to any vehicle, including sports cars, pickup trucks and off-road vehicles, however it is mostly associated with lowered sports cars, sedans, hatchbacks, vans and other body styles of passenger cars. The main parameters of the vehicle's stance are suspension height and position of the wheels. Suspension height usually depends of the suspension components including springs, coilover, air bags and camber plates. Wheel position usually depends on the rim size, off-set or wheel spacers. Tire fitment also plays a big role from both visual and functional perspective. Customization Style An illustration of a wheel with negative camber. The term \\"Stance\\" or \\"Stanced\\" is often used to describe a car customization style. It can be used in conjunction with \\"slammed\\" or \\"lowered\\" (not to be confused with a lowrider). Key elements of the stance style are: lowered suspension (lowering springs, coilovers or air suspension), large wheels, stretched tires and negative camber. Any make and model of a car produced between circa 1970s and today can fit in this category. The main purpose of a stanced car project is often an improved visual appeal rather than performance characteristics or handling, however some cars combine both. Stance is related to other modification styles such as JDM (Japanese Domestic Market), Euro style and VIP style. Negative Camber Camber is a measurement from the centerline of the wheel/tire relative to the road's surface. Negative camber is when the top of the wheel/tire angles inward toward the center of the vehicle. When done sparingly, negative camber greatly improves the handling characteristics of a vehicle. It does this by keeping the center of the tire perpendicular to the road when the car is turning. Therefore, allowing the optimum amount of tire tread to contact the road. Adversely, negative camber will decrease tire grip in straight line acceleration and braking. This is due to the same reasoning, when the vehicle is not turning less tread will be in contact with the road or track. Resulting in less grip and lost performance. Many drift cars, however, use negative camber on their front wheels for better handling characteristics as the negative camber keeps the contact patch of the tire perpendicular to the road when going through turns with much steering angle. Stanced vehicles employ all ranges of negative camber. There is no set standard on what degree of camber should be used. However, most normal vehicles maintain about 0.5¬∞ - 1¬∞ of camber. In the stance community, some owners run up to 45¬∞ of negative camber to achieve the stance they are looking for. Origin Stance is a style of car customization derived from auto sports such as Formula 1 and Drifting. Typically high power output cars designed for the race tracks feature extremely low and stiff suspension along with light and wide sport wheels for better handling and cornering on the race tracks. Enthusiasts began looking to replicate this style and make their cars look and perform similarly to the cars used in auto sport. If the original approach was based on the functional standpoint, modern modification style is often based on the visual standpoint. Extremely lowered cars tend to be show cars. They typically do not play the role of daily driver or race car. Extreme body work, suspension and wheel setups often make them less comfortable to drive on public roads and sometimes unsafe. Stanced BMW 5 Series (E34) Culture and Events Stanced Nissan GT-R with a Pandem widebody kit at the 2019 Tokyo Auto Salon Stance culture heavily revolves around making a vehicle unique from all others. Apart from the basics like lowering the car excessively, big wheels, and body kits - everything else is done to set the car apart. Stance enthusiasts often regard form as greater than function. Modification is not done for approval, but in order to challenge the norm. Stanced Volkswagen Golf with a widebody kit at the 2016 Osaka Auto Messe. The \\"stance\\" style originated in Japan but has spread all to many other countries, with stance centric car shows hosted around the world on most continents. Events happen every year that host many stanced cars, such as Stancenation, W√∂rthersee Treffen, FittedUK, Wekfest, Raceism and H2Oi. There is also a significant stanced car presence at larger events such as SEMA, Tokyo Auto Salon and Osaka Auto Messe.

Under the Sippenhaft law (criminal liability of the next of kin to a person considered a criminal), she was placed in custody in the Moabit prison in Berlin while her two daughters, aged respectively 2 years and nine months, were interned under false names in the SS-run children's home of Bornheim in Bad Sachsa. In 1947, Clarita von Trott was one of the first Germans allowed out of Germany after the end of the war, in order to take part in Caux conferences and participate in the reconstruction of Europe. She was invited by Swiss diplomat Philippe Mottu who had been in contact with the conspirators of the plot against Hitler during the war. Her personal testimony transformed the French Socialist MP and former Resistance fighter Irene Laure who became from then on a Franco-German reconciliation activist.\\"I ask your forgiveness because we Germans didn't resist early enough, nor strongly enough.\\", quoted by Jacqueline Piguet, Pour l'amour de demain, √âditions de Caux, 1985, 140 pages, , pp. 17-18. In 1950, Clarita von Trott began studying medicine and, in 1965, wrote her thesis on \\"the influence of the usual fixers of ultraviolet absorption by serum protein bodies.\\" She then obtained qualifications as a psychotherapist and psychoanalyst and practised in Hamburg and Berlin. At the same time, she led the fight to defend the memory of 20 July plot participants and the memory and message of her husband. (Until the 1950s, the widows of the conspirators against Hitler received no state pension, their husbands being listed as \\"traitors\\".) She teamed up with Freya von Moltke and Rosemarie Reichwein in order to initiate the International Meeting of Youth Kreisau / Krzy≈ºowa. Clarita von Trott kept expressing her message especially to young people, until the end.Article written by German schoolchildren after a visit to Clarita von Trott in 2007 She was honorary president of the Adam von Trott Foundation. The Wilhelm Leuschner medal was awarded to her by the State of Hesse in 1998. Family On 1 March 1942, Verena, the first daughter of Adam and Clarita von Trott, was born in Berlin. Their second daughter Clarita, born on 9 November 1943, would become a famous sociologist and marry fellow sociologist Urs M√ºller-Plantenberg. \\"My life has been exceptionally rich as a mother thanks to my daughters and their families, and a therapist, thanks to the friendships and the medical treatment of people in a state of mental distress, but in the centre of my existence, Adam's place has remained empty,\\" she wrote in 1987, adding in another statement \\"My four years of marriage - although they were war years - were in spite of all my most happy years.\\" Publications Adam von Trott zu Solz.

She had been brought up the Belgian Congo and the Gold Coast, and after her husband's rise to head of state of Ghana, she worked in social and religious work.  Biography  She was born on 12 June 1938 in Luluabourg, Belgian Congo (now Kananga, Democratic Republic of the Congo); to Mr Benoni Kwaku Fugar, a Ghanaian and Mrs Pauline Isombe Edembe Fugar, a Congolese citizen. She was the fourth of seven children. Fugar started school at Keta Roman Catholic Convent in the Gold Coast (now Ghana), where she also completed middle school in 1957 and then continued to the Universal Commercial College, Somanya. Mildred began to work at the Central Revenue Department, now the Ghana Internal Revenue Service, after successful completion of her course at Universal Commercial College. She met General Joseph Arthur Ankrah for the first time in 1962 after her sister Florence went to Burma Camp to join the auxiliary corps of the Ghanaian Army. Florence saw two high ranking army officials and asked them to direct her to the \\"boss of the army\\" so that she could submit her application. Ankrah was so taken by her that he escorted her back home to her family, where he met Fugar. They were engaged in 1965 and later married. Following a change of government in 1966, and the rise of Ankrah to head of state of Ghana, Fugar became First Lady of Ghana. She worked heavily in social and religious work.

It premiered on February 1, 2013, when it was released along with the rest of the first season on the American streaming service Netflix. Plot Frank (Kevin Spacey) learns that House Speaker Bob Birch (Larry Pine) and Linda (Sakina Jaffrey) are refusing to compromise on the education bill. He discourages President Walker (Michel Gill) from compromising on the bill, saying doing so will make the Oval Office look weak. Frank offers to help Majority Leader David Rasmussen (Michael Siberry) become the next Speaker in exchange for ousting Birch. Frank and Doug (Michael Kelly) also offer Black Caucus leader Terry Womack (Curtiss Cook) the Majority Leader position once Rasmussen becomes Speaker. To win Womack's support, Frank forces Russo (Corey Stoll) to allow a shipyard in his district to close in order to keep a military base open in Womack's. Russo agrees, despite his fear that the resulting job losses will erode his voter base. After Russo gets drunk and leaves his children alone at his apartment, Christina (Kristen Connolly) breaks up with him. With Womack's support, Frank gets enough votes in the House to oust Birch, but tells the Speaker that he will not vote against him if Womack is appointed as Rasmussen's replacement. Both Frank and Birch announce their agreement to Rasmussen, who resigns. Meanwhile, Claire (Robin Wright) is visited by Remy (Mahershala Ali), who offers a double donation of $1.5 million if the Clean Water Initiative forms a partnership with SanCorp. Despite needing the funds for Gillian's Sudan project, Claire turns it down after consulting with Frank. Instead of taking favors from SanCorp, Frank decides to organize a fundraising gala. To further showcase the CWI, Claire invites Adam Galloway (Ben Daniels), a New York-based photographer with whom she had a relationship in past. Galloway invites Claire for dinner and they share an intimate moment, but she turns down his advances and makes it clear their relation is to be business only. Tensions further escalate between Zoe (Kate Mara) and Hammerschmidt (Boris McGiver) when the Herald's owner, Margaret Tilden (Kathleen Chalfant) allows Zoe to continue her work. In order to avoid any further clashes, Hammerschmidt offers Janine's (Constance Zimmer) job as White House correspondent to Zoe. Despite her reluctance, both Janine and Lucas (Sebastian Arcelus) encourage her to take the position. However, Frank persuades Zoe not to take it. As a result, Hammerschmidt angrily calls her \\"cunt\\", which she tweets about before resigning from The Washington Herald. Zoe invites Frank to her apartment, where they end up having sex.

Included are facilities currently used by the oldest operating ferry on Lake Champlain, the Ticonderoga-Larrabees Point Ferry, and two buildings historically associated with the ferry operation. The complex was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980. Description and history Larrabee's Point is located in southwestern Shoreham, on the eastern shore of Lake Champlain at a narrow point in the lake opposite Ticonderoga, New York. John Larrabee purchased the land in this area in 1787, and in 1799 received permission from the state to operate a ferry. By 1875, the Larrabee's Point complex included a large hotel and a wharf capable of docking large steamships that carried tourists on the lake. The ferry's importance in commercial freight transportation declined in the second half of the 19th century, due to the arrival of the railroads in Addison County. The stone warehouse standing adjacent to the current ferry slip, built in 1823, is a surviving reminder of this historic importance. with The historic elements of the Larrabee's Point complex include the ferry slip area, still in use by the modern ferry, and the adjacent stone wharf. The three story stone warehouse, standing at the land side of the wharf, now houses a lake cruise ship service. Across Vermont 74 from the warehouse stands the c. 1835 house of John Larrabee, a brick 2-1/2 story structure. It is a particularly fine example of transitional Federal- Greek Revival architecture, with a later Victorian porch extending across the lake-facing front. The small wood-frame building housing the ferry office, between the ferry slip and the warehouse, is not historic.

The group were only so called by much later writers, and of the five, only two (Ru and Guan) seem to have produced wares directly ordered by the Imperial court, though all can be of very high quality. All were imitated later, often with considerable success.Rawson, 246 All except Ding ware used celadon glazes, and in Western terms the celadon kilns are stoneware, as opposed to the Ding early porcelain.

The site was occupied continuously from the Neolithic through the Bronze Age. The site is situated about above the riverbed on the southern bank of the Xi River, a tributary of the Wei River. The site was discovered by Pei Wenzhong in 1947. Stratigraphy *Xishanping I: the earliest layer, this layer corresponds to the Dadiwan culture. The bones from a large variety of animals (red deer, musk deer, Asiatic black bear, bamboo rat, rat, chicken, dog, pig) were discovered in this layer. *Xishangping II: this layer corresponds to the Lower Beishouling culture. Only a few animal bones were found in this layer, coming from red deer, cattle and pigs. *Xishangping III (5250‚Äì4300 BP): this period corresponds to the Majiayao culture. The greatest changes at Xishanping occurred during this time. Evidence for intensive agriculture can be found in this layer, starting from around 5,100 BP. Horse, chicken, dog and pig bones were discovered in this layer, with pig bones composing almost half of all of the bones found in this layer. This layer can be further divided as follows: ** 5250‚Äì4650 BP: during this period, the forest was composed primarily of a coniferous-broadleaf mix. The primary staple crops were foxtail and broomcorn millet. ** 4650‚Äì4300 BP: around 4650 BP, the forest saw a drastic transition, most likely due to anthropogenic causes. The forest fauna came to be dominated primarily by fast-growing bamboo. Additionally, several fruit and nut-bearing trees (Castanea, Prunus cerasus, Prunus padus and Diospyros) became more commonly found. The primary staple crops were foxtail millet, broomcorn millet, and buckwheat. *Xishangping IV (4300‚Äì3000 BP): this period corresponds to the Qijia culture. Pig bones form an overwhelming majority of all of the animals bones found from this layer. Staple crops Xishanping was the site of a highly diverse and complex agriculture system, showing the earliest largest diversity of staple crops found in China. From 4650‚Äì3000 BP, eight major staple crops were found together at Xishanping: wheat (Triticum aestivum), barley and oat (all three introduced from Western Asia); rice (introduced from eastern China); foxtail millet, broomcorn millet, buckwheat and soybean. As such, Xishanping is the earliest site for the introduction of several Western Asia staple crops to China, likely via the Hexi Corridor. Despite the diversity, the people at Xishanping still relied primarily on rainfed agriculture.

It stars Saoirse Ronan and Billy Howle and tells the story of virgins, Florence and Edward, and their first disastrous attempt at having sex on their wedding night. The initial experience and their differing responses to the failure have lifelong consequences for both. The film had its world premiere in the Special Presentations section at the Toronto International Film Festival on 7 September 2017, and was released in the United States and United Kingdom in May 2018. Plot In 1962, Edward Mayhew and Florence Ponting first meet after graduating from their respective universities. He is a historian and rock-and-roll lover; she a classical violinist with her own quartet. They fall in love quickly, meet each other's families, and eventually decide to get married, despite their differences in background and social status. Florence is secretly anxious about the wedding due to her fears about sex, but there is no one with whom she can discuss it. On Edward and Florence's honeymoon at Chesil Beach, their backgrounds and temperaments come to the fore: Edward's quickness to anger and occasional physical belligerence, and Florence's unspoken past relationship with her father, who dominated and possibly molested her. They are both inexperienced sexually, and their first attempt at sex goes badly wrong. Florence flees along the beach, and after being confronted by an angry Edward, explains that although she loves him very much and wants to be with him for life, she can only be a platonic wife. Edward angrily rejects the idea. The couple part ways, and their marriage is annulled. Thirteen years later, in 1975, a young girl enters the record shop that Edward now runs. He realises that she must be Florence's daughter, and he painfully reminisces about his lost love. Much later, in 2007, Edward, still single, overhears on the radio that Florence's quartet - including her husband - will be giving a farewell concert after 50 years of professional success. He attends and sits near the front of the audience. When their eyes meet, Edward and Florence shed silent tears.

Carey Mulligan was in talks to star as Florence Ponting. Shooting was delayed when Mendes' Skyfall went into production and Focus Features pulled out of development. In 2011, the film went back in to pre-production, this time with Mike Newell directing and Sam Mendes producing through his Neal Street Productions banner with StudioCanal and BBC Films. Later, production ceased after pre-production over-ran and the producers got cold feet. In February 2016, it was announced that Saoirse Ronan was to play Florence Ponting. Elizabeth Karlsen and Stephen Woolley produced the film under their Number 9 Films banner. In May 2016, during the Cannes Film Festival, it was announced that BBC Films would co-produce the film. In August 2016, Billy Howle joined the cast as the male lead. In October 2016, it was announced that Thorsten Schumacher's new film and TV outfit Rocket Science had come on board to complete international sales. =Filming= Principal photography began on 17 October 2016, on Chesil Beach, Dorset, England. Other filming locations included London, Oxford and Pinewood Studios in England. Release Lionsgate acquired the distribution rights for the United Kingdom in October 2016. On Chesil Beach had its world premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival on 7 September 2017. Bleecker Street acquired the U.S. distribution rights in October 2017. On Chesil Beach was released in the UK on 18 May 2018. Originally scheduled for theatrical release in the United States on 15 June 2018, the date was pushed up to 18 May 2018.  Critical response  On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 68% based on 134 reviews, and an average rating of 6.3/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \\"On Chesil Beach presents a well-acted and solidly crafted adaptation of a small yet resonant story with deceptively rich subtext.\\" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 62 out of 100, based on 33 critics, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews\\". The Economist praised McEwan's screenwriting for having \\"deviated from the source material in effective ways\\". Owen Gleiberman of Variety praised the cast and called the film a \\"romantic drama that gets so far into the mystique of its era that it takes you somewhere you‚Äôve never been.\\" Anya Jaremko-Greenwold of FLOOD Magazine wrote that \\"while men might fail to recognize how intimidating the expectation of sex can be for women, it‚Äôs something McEwan‚Äôs novel (and the film, for which he wrote the screenplay) hinges upon with exquisite delicacy.\\" Writing for IndieWire, Kate Erbland gave the film a grade of \\"C+,\\" saying, \\"After a strong start, the film‚Äôs middle section sags into the most benign of observations about Edward and Florence and the elements that have pulled them together. For a film that is so consumed with the burning complications of first, early love, On Chesil Beach more resembles a wilted relationship, one that offers up no excitement about the future and little respect for the past.\\" References External links * Production notes * IMDB Page 2017 films British drama films British films Films based on British novels Films set in the 1960s Films set in England Films set in Dorset 2017 directorial debut films Films with screenplays by Ian McEwan Films produced by Elizabeth Karlsen BBC Films films Number 9 Films films Lionsgate films Films set in 1962 ","title":"On Chesil Beach (film)"},{"id":"51528799","text":"Bisdehydrodoisynolic acid (BDDA), as the (Z)-isomer ((Z)-BDDA), is a synthetic, nonsteroidal estrogen related to doisynolic acid that was never marketed. It is one of the most potent estrogens known, although it has more recently been characterized as a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM). BDDA and other doisynolic acid derivatives display relatively low affinity accompanied by disproportionately high estrogenic potency in vivo, which was eventually determined to be due to transformation into metabolites with greater estrogenic activity. The drug was discovered in 1947 as a degradation product of the reaction of equilenin or dihydroequilenin with potassium hydroxide. It is the seco-analogue of equilenin, while doisynolic acid is the seco-analogue of estrone. These compounds, along with diethylstilbestrol, can be considered to be open-ring analogues of estradiol.

Wearsafe's mission is to \\"make the world a safer place by redefining the way people seek and provide help\\"-- by reaching a wide variety of customers, including outdoors sportsmen and anyone looking to control their personal safety, including preventing sexual assault.  History and Mission  Wearsafe was created in response to the Cheshire Home Invasion Murders of 2007. The founders, David Benoit and Phillip Giancarlo, began work on the technology in 2011 with copatent providers Rick Borden, Kyle Busque and Keven Busque. The company has received significant investments from Ravi Singh, Yogasmogo and other investors. The goal of Wearsafe Labs is to \\"connect students with trusted contacts, enabling them to feel safe wherever they are.\\" Wearsafe is designed to both aid victims in an emergency and deter attackers. According to Digital Trends, former U.S. Secret Service special agent Rich Starpoli, who served Presidents George W.

History Following the September 2 bombing in Davao City that killed 14 people and seriously wounded at least 60 others, President Duterte placed the entire country under a national state of emergency. By virtue of the proclamation declaring a \\"State of National Emergency on Account of Lawless Violence in Mindanao\\", the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) and the Philippine National Police (PNP) were ordered to suppress all forms of lawless violence in Mindanao and to undertake measures to prevent violence from spreading to other parts of the Philippines. The proclamation also came on the heels of the Philippine military offensive against the terrorist group Abu Sayyaf in Patikul, Sulu which left 15 soldiers dead on August 29, 2016. It also acknowledged the threats of further terror attacks by lawless elements in other parts of the country, including the metropolitan areas, following these developments in Mindanao. President Duterte issued the proclamation in Manila just before leaving for Laos to attend the 2016 ASEAN Summit. Earlier, he verbally declared a \\"state of lawlessness\\" in the country on September 3, 2016. In a press conference in Davao the day following the attacks, Duterte said the declaration was to \\"ensure coordinated efforts\\" between the police and the military in the government's fight against illegal drugs, criminals and terrorism. He also said it was not a declaration of martial law and that the writ of habeas corpus will not be suspended. The presidential proclamation orders the Philippine law enforcement officials to carry out suppression of violence \\"as may be permitted in the Constitution and existing laws,\\" as well as \\"with due regard to the fundamental civil and political rights of our citizens.\\" It also states that the \\"state of national emergency on account of lawless violence shall remain in force and effect until lifted or withdrawn by the President.\\" Directives Under Memorandum Order No. 3 released on September 7, 2016, the Department of National Defense and the Department of the Interior and Local Government are ordered to deploy additional forces of the AFP and PNP in public areas throughout the country without causing undue alarm to the general public, and to intensify their local and transnational intelligence operations against individuals or groups suspected of, or responsible for, committing or conspiring to commit acts of lawless violence. It also orders the Department of Justice to coordinate with law enforcement agencies for the prompt investigation and prosecution of all suspected individuals or groups. The memorandum guarantees the civil and political rights of individuals in the duration of the state of emergency and sets out the rules governing arrests for AFP and PNP personnel. It states: The memorandum also lists the existing rules and procedures in carrying out warrantless searches and seizures, such as when the individual consents to the search or waives his right against warrantless search; when the search is made contemporaneous to a lawful arrest; the search of vessels and aircraft for violation of immigration and customs laws; the search of automobiles at borders for violation of immigration or smuggling laws; the seizure of objects made in plain view; stop-and-frisk situations; and searches arising from emergency circumstances.

It was adapted into a film of the same name in 2017. The novel centers around the life of Benjamin Bentley, a 17 year-old from Houston, Texas, and his tumultuous relationship with two love interests over the span of several years. It deals primarily with themes of personal fulfillment, self-acceptance and the process of coming out. Plot =Plot summary= The novel is written from a third person limited point of view, told through the eyes of the book's main character, Benjamin Bentley. It is divided into three separate sections based on the varying stages of Benjamin's life as the story is taking place. The first part of the book, set in the city of Houston in 1996, focuses on the relationship Ben eventually develops with Tim Wyman, another teenager who he attends high school with. Though Ben gradually manages to help Tim accept different aspects of his repressed homosexuality, and even talks him into breaking up with the girlfriend he dated in order to maintain his appearance, they eventually break up after a close call with the police who nearly catch them having sex in a public park. The two teenagers carry on with their lives and eventually go their separate ways. The second part of the novel is set three years later in 1999, when Ben is a freshman student in college and has relocated to Chicago. He meets flight attendant Jace Holden while flying back home for the holidays, and the two eventually fall in love and decide to move in together. After Ben transfers to a new school in Austin, he discovers that Tim is also a student there. Tim, now having embraced his sexuality, makes repeated attempts to meddle in Ben's new relationship, eventually convincing Ben that Jace is cheating on him so that they can get back together. Ben eventually learns the truth, and decides to leave Tim and get back together with Jace. The third and final segment of the novel takes place in 2003. After having graduated, Ben begins working part-time as a speech therapist and actor at a dinner theater. Ben and Jace later decide to get married and buy a house together. Tim eventually pays Ben a visit after one of his performances at the theater and beckons Ben to help him leave his dysfunctional relationship with Ryan, a younger college student who abuses alcohol and drugs. After helping Tim, Ben attempts to establish a platonic relationship with him whilst living with Jace. He soon realizes he can't and decides to cut him out of his life, seemingly for good. Jace's health begins to deteriorate some years later after suffering from a brain hemorrhage, and he eventually succumbs to a brain aneurysm. In light of Jace's passing, Ben suffers depression and contemplates suicide. His friend Allison turns to Tim for help, and sets up a reunion between the two. The two meet each other once again, and after realizing that Tim has turned his life around and overcome all his previous hang-ups, Ben agrees to resume the relationship they began over a decade earlier when they were teenagers. =Main characters= *Ben Bentley - The novel's main character, a gay teenager who is fully out of the closet to his friends and family. He develops an intimate relationship with Tim Wyman, though it quickly deteriorates due to the latter still being in the closet. He later develops feelings for another character, Jace Holden. Their relationship becomes strained when Tim re-enters Ben's life after having come to terms with his own sexuality. *Tim Wyman - Ben's primary love interest during the first part of the novel, whose inability to accept his homosexuality serves as the catalyst for their eventual breakup. He makes recurring appearances later throughout. *Jace Holden - A flight attendant who Ben meets on his way home during winter break, who he later ends up moving in with and marrying. *Allison Cross - Ben's best friend throughout the book, who indirectly serves as the voice of conscience for several characters in the series. Critical reception The book was also a finalist in the 24th Lambda Literary Awards under the category of gay romance. Film adaptation Something Like Summer was adapted into a film by Blue Seraph Productions in 2017. The screenplay was written by producer Carlos Pedraza, and the film was directed by David Berry. Both men had previously worked in the production of another LGBT film, Judas Kiss, in 2011. Actor Grant Davis played the lead role of Benjamin Bentley, while Davi Santos and Ben Baur played the roles of Tim and Jace, respectively. The movie was released on February 25, 2017. School edition A second edition of the novel was published in August 2017. The revised version, marketed as being more school friendly, largely removed the book's descriptions of sexual acts between the main characters. On the film's website, author Jay Bell explained, \\"I really want to get Something Like Summer into schools and into the hands of young people, but the explicit content has always made that difficult\\". Additional changes were also made to alter the story's pacing.

Part 1: Abolition of the Right to Buy Part 1 of the Act provides for the abolition of the right to buy policy which allowed secure tenants of councils and some housing associations the legal right to buy, at a large discount, the home they are living in. This took effect on 1 August 2016, allowing for two years in which existing council tenants could decide whether they wished to buy their home. The policy marked a significant divergence from that undertaken in England and Wales, with the UK Government legislating to extend right to buy to tenants in housing associations. Part 3: Short Scottish Secure Tenancies and Antisocial Behaviour Powers The Act simplifies the eviction process in cases involving antisocial behaviour by allowing social landlords to make use of an existing conviction as grounds for possession. The Act clarifies that a social landlord can suspend an application for social housing under the following circumstances: * There is evidence that the applicant, a member of their household or a visitor has been engaged in antisocial behaviour in or near their home or towards the landlord‚Äôs staff; * The applicant has previously been evicted by a court order; * The applicant has lost a previous tenancy through abandonment; * The applicant has been evicted under the Housing (Scotland) Act 2001 for damage to the home or its contents; * The applicant has outstanding rent arrears and there is no arrangement in place; * The applicant has previously provided false information to obtain a tenancy; * The applicant has unreasonably refused the offer of one or more homes. Assignation and Sub-letting The Act specifies that any person seeking assignation, subletting or joint tenancy of a social rented home, must have been living in that home as their main residence for a period of at least 12 months prior to the application, as opposed to six months. Improving Standards in Rented Accommodation The Act introduces new requirements for private landlords to provide carbon monoxide detectors and have electrical fixtures, fittings and appliances tested for safety every five years.

The bridge was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1973. Description and history The Upper Falls Covered Bridge is located in a rural area of western Weathersfield, south of Vermont 131 on Upper Falls Road. It is a single-span Town lattice truss structure, set on one modern concrete abutment, and another of dry laid stone that has been faced in concrete. It is long with a gabled overhang of at each end, and is wide with a roadway width of (one lane). The sides of the bridge are clad in vertical board siding. Square window holes are cut into each side of the exterior. The bridge is covered by a metal roof. The gable ends of the portals are finished in horizontally laid boards, with partial gable returns and a triangular line of moulding, a nod to Greek Revival architecture popular at the time of its construction. with The bridge was built in 1840 by James Trasker of Claremont, New Hampshire. It is distinctive among Vermont's many surviving covered bridges for the Greek Revival elements of its gables, and for the remarkably good condition of the surviving stone abutment, which has precisely laid stonework.

The company develops software that allows IT professionals to backup, manage and gain insights from their data, across multiple systems or cloud providers. History Cohesity was founded in June 2013 by Mohit Aron, who previously co-founded storage company Nutanix. While still in stealth mode, it closed a Series A funding round of $15M. The company launched publicly in June 2015, introducing a platform designed to consolidate and manage secondary data. In October, Cohesity announced the public launch of its data management products, DataPlatform and DataProtect. As part of coming out of stealth mode, the company announced a Series B funding round of $55M, bringing its total at that point to $70M. In February 2016, the company announced the second generation of DataPlatform and DataProtect. In June, the company launched its 3.0 products, expanding data protection to physical servers. Also by June, the company had raised $70 million in venture funding in two rounds with Google Ventures, Qualcomm Ventures, and Sequoia Capital. On April 4, 2017, Cohesity announced a $90 million Series C funding round, led by GV, the venture capital arm of Google parent Alphabet Inc., and Sequoia Capital. On June 11, 2018, the company announced a Series D funding round of $250 million led by Softbank Vision Fund. In August, the company introduced a SaaS-based management console called Helios. In February 2019, Cohesity launched their online MarketPlace to sell applications that run on its DataPlatform. In May, the company made its first acquisition by buying Imanis Data, a provider of NoSQL data protection software. In July, the company announced it would be recognizing revenue predominantly from software, transitioning away from recognizing hardware revenue from the sale of backup appliances. Products Cohesity develops software used to consolidate and simplify data management, and includes analytics capabilities. The company's software also solves the problem of mass data fragmentation, as data proliferates across multiple systems or cloud providers. The company's main product, DataPlatform, is hyper converged software that allows businesses to consolidate a variety of workloads, including backups, archives, test and development, along with analytics data, onto a single cloud-native platform. It works with physical servers as well as virtual machines. The company also develops data management and backup software called DataProtect, which runs on DataPlatform. As of 2019, the most current version was code-named Pegasus. Through the acquisition of Imanis Data, Cohesity extends backup capabilities to NoSQL workloads distributed databases like MongoDB, Cassandra, Couchbase, and Hbase, as well as Hadoop data on Hadoop distributed file system (HDFS) datastores. The company's Helios SaaS management tool provides a dashboard view of a customer's DataPlatform sites, including local and remote; on- premises; and in the public cloud. The company's MarketPlace allows customers to purchase the company's other applications, as well as third party apps that run on the company's DataPlatform. The company also makes a software development kit (SDK) available for programmers who want to develop their own apps for DataPlatform.

It premiered on February 1, 2013, when it was released along with the rest of the first season on the American streaming service Netflix. Plot Frank (Kevin Spacey) is still at Zoe's (Kate Mara) apartment. She tells Frank about the job offers she is getting from different media outlets including \\"Slugline\\"a political journalism organization similar to Politico. She also talks about Hammerschmidt (Boris McGiver), who fired her from The Washington Herald and all the press that both of them are getting. Frank drops her phone into a glass of water to avoid any press leak of their conversation and buys her two phones: one for work and others for their conversations. When Frank returns to Claire (Robin Wright), she asks about Zoe. Frank says that she is a \\"mouthpiece and can be controlled.\\" At Russo's (Corey Stoll) office, Christina (Kristen Connolly) packs her stuff and leaves, to his distress. Frank has a heated conversation with Marty Spinella (Al Sapienza), the head lobbyist for the teacher's union, who is infuriated because Frank lied to him. Meanwhile, Zoe decides to take the job at Slugline. At the Democratic National Committee, Frank attends a meeting led by DNC chair Patricia Whittaker (Suzanne Savoy). A friend of Russo's, Paul Capra (Wass Stevens), comes into his office to ask him to stop the closure of the shipyard and save the 12,000 jobs it provides. Paul reminds him that his promise to keep the shipyard open was what got him elected in the first place. Peter cannot reveal that Frank forced him to refuse to give testimony against the closure at the hearing, and Paul leaves, angrily declaring that Peter isn't the person he used to be. Frank suspects that Martin is organizing a massive teacher's strike and he and Doug (Michael Kelly) think of a plan to stop him. He also reveals that he wants to make Russo Governor of Pennsylvania, but he has a bigger agenda behind this. After turning down Remy (Mahershala Ali), Claire is having doubts, because the gala is only raising half a million dollars. She calls Adam, who ignores the phone after seeing Claire's name. Moreover, Frank pledges to do all he can for Claire's gala and starts inviting every person he knows. Margaret Tilden (Kathleen Chalfant) fires Hammerschmidt in the wake of his calling Zoe a cunt and his going against her despite her warning. At Zoe's apartment, Frank tells her that they cannot have a relationship without protection. To give him leverage over her she lets Frank take nude pictures of her. Martin gets enraged when the National Education Association (NEA) backs out from a partnership with the American Organization of Teachers and Education in the middle of his plan. Spinella contacts the union workers at the Cotesworth Hotel, which is hosting the fundraising gala and gets them to refuse to work for the event. Claire calls Frank, who despite all his efforts cannot get the hotel to side against the union. As the gala is just hours away, Claire decides to have it right outside the hotel, and Frank gets his entire staff to help out. While the hotel staff and Martin resist, fire regulations mean they can't lock the gates to prevent it. Martin brings in union members to protest for the media in front of the gala, but at the end of the dinner, Frank makes himself look good by handing out food to the protesters on camera. The gala is enormously successful and raises enough money for Claire's project. In the end, a drunk and disheveled Russo awaits on the steps of the Underwood's home for their arrival. Without saying anything, Claire and Frank invite him in, make him a sandwich and coffee, and ask him to stay the night in their guest suite. In the suite, privately, Russo blames Frank, and lashes out at him for ruining his life. After listening to him quietly, Frank takes Russo to the bathroom and tells him that he is the only person who still believes in him and that he wants him to run for Governor of Pennsylvania ‚Äì but only if he can pull his life back together. Frank also leaves him a razor blade, if he thinks everything is over. In the morning, a chastened Russo ‚Äì now well and truly Frank's man ‚Äì leaves the house, thanking his hosts.

It was his eighth book of poetry and the last released in his lifetime. It contains 77 poems that Brautigan wrote in 1976 during his seven-week stay in Japan, presented in a diary-like format. The title is the date he planned to leave the country. In the introduction, Brautigan explains his complicated relationship with Japan. He was initially interested because of his uncle, who died as a result of Japanese bombing of Midway in World War II. In the years following the war, the anger he carried faded and he began to learn about and appreciate Japanese art and culture, which helped him to better understand the war, and led him to feel compelled to visit. Analysis The book is an example of haibun, a Japanese literary form in which a group of poems form a larger narrative. Caroline Bokinsky notes that here, unlike others in Brautigan's oeuvre, he is a \\"confessional poet, lost and alone in a strange land, unable to communicate.\\" Many reviewers commented on a pervasive feeling of loneliness running throughout the text. Kirkus Reviews described Brautigan's apparent mood while writing as \\"lonely, moony, lost, self-sorry, in love\\", and Dennis Petticoffer said the work as a whole \\"portrays a mood of alienation and loneliness.\\" Choice also commented that the author seemed lonely, \\"not surprisingly, since Brautigan knows no Japanese\\", and its \\"advance nostalgia contributed by the fact of a known departure date\\". Reception June 30th, June 30th received mixed to negative reviews. Brautigan acknowledges in the introduction that the \\"quality of [the poems] is uneven but I have printed them all anyway because they are a diary expressing my feelings and emotions in Japan and the quality of life is often uneven.\\" The Kirkus reviewer called some poems \\"dreadful\\" but \\"every once in a while a testament to the variety and flexibility of poetry that's very refreshing.\\" Choice called it \\"in summary, an often good book\\" that would benefit from editing. Carrie Knowles of The Booklist found it to be \\"a case of terminal poetic pretentiousness\\" in which Brautigan's introspection causes him to do Japan a disservice, whereas Arian Schuster found Japan to serve only as a metaphor for alienation. Publishers Weekly said the \\"haphazard\\" book will cause fans to \\"wince and wonder at this decline in Brautigan's talent\\".

The man is holding onto a tree, which Davis says was pointedly phallic because \\"Richard was always looking for something to kind of gently throw in the public's face.\\" The woman in the drawing is intended to be Emily Dickinson -- it was from one of her poems, and included by Brautigan as an epigraph, that the book's title was taken: The book is 16 pages long, with 24 poems. Nine of the poems were reprinted in the 1968 collection The Pill versus the Springhill Mine Disaster, one of Brautigan's best known works. Several critics noted how Lay the Marble Tea differs from most of Brautigan's other work. According to John F. Barber, unlike his later work, Lay the Marble Tea uses several different narrators rather than a single first-person perspective. Hjortsberg observes that \\"the poetry is in a cyclical framework [with the first] being mentioned in the last\\". It is also more experimental with language than work he had produced until then, with use of humorous wordplay, analogy and metaphor.

The jazz band dominated collegiate jazz festival awards in its early days and in 1969 was chosen by the state department to tour the USSR and Eastern Europe. Many members of Garvey's jazz bands went on to successful careers as professional musicians and academics. Early years Inspired by a talk given by the violinist of the Chautauqua Trio, Garvey began studying violin at age 7. By 14 he was commuting from his home in Reading, PA every other week to Temple University in Philadelphia to study violin with Alfred Lorenz, a violist with the Philadelphia Orchestra He went on to major in music at Temple. As a Jobbing Musician After college Garvey played with the Philadelphia Symphony and Columbus Philharmonic. In March 1943, Garvey joined a dance band that played pop-styled classical music led by a classically trained violinist named Jan Savitt, \\"The Stokowski of Swing\\". In the summer of 1948 he was director of the summer chamber music program at Ball State University. Academia In 1948, Garvey joined the Walden String Quartet in an until-then frequently changing viola chair. He was to remain with the quartet until 1971. The group had recently become quartet-in-residence at the University of Illinois. In addition to touring and recording, the Quartet were members of the music faculty. Garvey was hired as Instructor in the department and within a few years was promoted to Assistant Professor. In May 1952, Garvey became head of the music committee of the university‚Äôs Festival of Contemporary Arts. In 1959, he was made a full professor. The University Jazz Program Work with Harry Partch on \\"The Bewitched\\", a music and dance piece for the 1957 festival, rekindled Garvey's interest in jazz, and for the 1959 festival he invited the Modern Jazz Quartet to play with a student jazz band and a string ensemble. Because of student interest in continuing the jazz band, Garvey sought funding from the School of Music, but faced strong opposition. By October 1960 he was able to get $150 from the school, and obtained additional money and administrative support from the student union. Garvey and the band made their debut at a routine Thursday morning School of Music function on December 8, 1960. In April 1964, they entered the Collegiate Jazz Festival at Notre Dame University for the first time and took the prize for Best Big Band. In 1965 and 1966, they were finalists at the festival. and in March 1967, the band won Best Overall Jazz Group. In December 1967, Garvey's band was officially sanctioned by the School of Music. In 1968, and 1969 they again won \\"Best Overall Jazz Group\\", the first ensemble to do so three years in a row. The prize at the 1968 and 1969 festivals was an invitation to perform at the Newport Jazz Festival, for which they received praise from critics Leonard Feather and John S. Wilson. The 1969 Downbeat Readers Poll ranked the band 16th place in the jazz Big Band category, the only college band in the entire poll. The accolades led to sponsorship by the US State Department for an eight-week tour of Eastern Europe and Scandinavia in 1968 , and a six-week tour of the Soviet Union in 1969. By 1970 the School of Music was sponsor of four jazz bands. Many alumni of Garvey's bands went on to successful careers as musicians and teachers, including Cecil Bridgewater, Dee Dee Bridgewater, Jim McNeely, Ron Dewar, Joel Helleny, and Howie Smith. The Russian Folk Orchestra During the tour of the U.S.S.R., Garvey became interested in Russian folk music. Upon returning he found funds through the university to purchase 25 balalaikas, and in 1973 formed the Russian Balalaika Orchestra , soon to be renamed the Russian Folk Orchestra. Garvey led this ensemble for over a decade, touring the U.S and abroad.  Sound Recordings  *Zoltan Kodaly Quartet No 2, Op. 10/Karol Syzmanowski Quartet in C Major, Op 37.

It was founded in 2014 and launched to the public in December 2014. Eve Sleep manufactures 4 different mattresses. The current Original has a three-layer design incorporating memory foam. Eve sells online and reduces its shipping costs by rolling the mattress into a box. It can also be bought in High Street stores.  History  =Origin= In the 2010s, mattress company startups such as Eve began to emerge with a new business model to meet consumer and market demands. These new companies had a limited selection of products made from a few key components at a fraction of the high street costs. They also aimed to simplify the decision process for customers, offering generous trial periods, quick delivery and social media marketing. Jas Bagniewski was already in the mattress industry, along with James Fryer. They sold over $2 million worth of mattresses in one day on a Groupon flash sale in 2011.The company went on to sell 75,000 mattresses online in 18 countries. The idea for Eve grew from their experience and through years of product testing, customer feedback and reviews. Eve Sleep was founded in October 2014 in London by: * Jas Bagniewski (ex-senior management of Groupon UK and ex-head of Zalando UK) * James Fryer (previously of Zen Bedrooms) * Kuba Wieczorek (ex director at Channel 4 Creative and head of sports marketing at Channel 4) * Joe Moore (formerly at Deloitte) * Felix Lobkowicz (ex-VP Rocket Internet and ex-head of Zalando UK) * Abid Ismail (ex-CEO of Axelos, part of Capita Plc, and ex-assistant director at Ernst and Young M&A;). The company was officially launched in December 2014. =Funding rounds= In 2015, the company closed a seed-round of funding worth ¬£600,000. Investors included FJ Labs (Viagogo and Zesty), DN Capital (Shazam) and Octopus Ventures. In 2018, the company looked to raise a further 15 million pounds.Article in The Retail Gazette Octopus Ventures and DN Capital invested for a second time in a Series A round to the value of ¬£2.5 million in October 2015. And in July 2016, Eve Sleep secured ¬£6.9m in Series B funding. This round included funding from Channel 4, the British public-service television broadcaster, via its Commercial Growth Fund. Channel 4 offers companies not currently advertising on television in the UK, the opportunity to launch a TV ad campaign on Channel 4, by exchanging equity stakes or striking revenue share arrangements. =Initial growth= The company sold more than 11,000 mattresses in its first year with a turnover of more than ¬£3.5 million, averaging monthly growth of 25%. =Management change= By 2017, the revenue had increased to ¬£27 million, but the operating losses also increased to ¬£19 million in the same period, with over half the revenue spent on marketing. The founding CEO, Jas Bagniewski, was asked to step down in July 2018 due to the poor financial performance, and was replaced in September 2018 by James Sturrock, the former CEO of Moonpig. At the time Bagniewski was asked to stand down, the company share price was 67p per share. In the first 6 months under new management, the share price dropped to 10p per share. In September 2018, the new CEO said that the company needed an injection of capital, and proposed a share placing to achieve it.  Product  The Eve Sleep mattress Eve Sleep sells four mattresses, Light, Hybrid, Original and Premium. Bed names and size specifications vary in different countries. The mattress exists in all standard sizes in UK (single, double, king, super king...) and in US (single, twin, twin XL, full, king and California king), and fits all IKEA frames. The company also manufactures custom-sized mattresses on demand. The Original and the Light mattresses features a knitted two way stretch fabric cover in white with a distinctive yellow side panel. The mattress is vacuum packed and folded into a box, and can be easily delivered and moved up staircases, unlike traditional mattresses. When unpacked, the mattress recovers its original shape and is ready to sleep on within hours. This method also cuts the delivery cost. Eve Sleep's products are designed and made on demand in the UK and United States. The company used to claim to make \\"the world's most comfortable mattress\\" and \\"the perfect mattress\\" at the third of the price of an equivalent high street mattress.  Business model  Eve Sleep mattress in a child's bedroom Eve's business model features direct online sales, strong customer service and savvy social media marketing. Its online platform allows the company to offer its mattresses at affordable prices. The firm is operating in the UK, the US, Germany, France, Belgium, Luxembourg, Austria, Switzerland, and plans to expand further. Eve Sleep's goal is to become a global household brand.  Marketing  In December 2015, the mattress company launched a long-form copy advertising campaign across the London Underground showing its distinctive yellow mattress border. Channel 4's investment saw Eve Sleep launch a television advert across its channels. In June 2016, Eve Sleep also launched its \\"Nap Station\\". Located at the Old Truman Brewery, in East London, the pop-up nap station was a co-working space come nap station equipped with beds. The \\"Nap Station\\" allowed people to experience the brand, try Eve mattress and encouraged them to enjoy the benefits of a power nap. Visitors could benefit from free Wi-Fi and charging points, and artisan coffee.

Ganesh. The firm had been a leading production studio in the Tamil film industry in the 1990s and had been founded by G. Venkateswaran as Sujatha Films in 1986.  History  =Film industry= Sujatha Films was set up in 1986 by G. Venkateswaran, a chartered accountant, as a film production and distribution company. Operating as a family production house, Venkateswaran's brother Mani Ratnam also often assisted on the production work of films that he directed for the studio. Sujatha Films became GV Films as it became the first publicly listed company from the Indian media industry in 1989. The early films by the studio saw frequent collaborations with Mani Ratnam and Visu, as well as with composer A. R. Rahman. Films including Anjali and Thalapathi were among the studio's most notable films. GV Films produced Suhasini Maniratnam's first film Indira (1995) featuring Anu Hasan and Arvind Swamy in the lead roles. The film did not perform well at the box office, prompting GV Films to stop production and prioritise distribution ventures. However, some distribution ventures including Aalavandhan (2001) and Baba (2002) were also expensive failures. GV Films made a return to production in the early 2000s, first working on the making of Thamizhan (2002) directed by debutant Majith. The film featured Vijay and Priyanka Chopra in her first acting role. Further films that the studio worked on included Vasanth's Yai! Nee Romba Azhaga Irukke! (2002) and K. Bhagyaraj's Chokka Thangam (2003) with Vijayakanth. All three films did not perform well commercially. Subsequently, Venkateswaran came under pressure from film financiers. In April 2003, Venkateswaran committed suicide at his residence in Chennai. Following Venkateswaran's death, the studio continued to produce media content under the same name. Notably, actress Manisha Koirala was briefly a board member as the studio attempted to make a comeback through Hindi film content and 3D television serials. Kasthuri Shankar also worked with the studio and assisted on the oversight of the production of Urchagam (2007). The studio returned to prioritising distribution ventures and instead chose to make small budget films such as Kaivantha Kalai (2006) and Thirudi (2006). In 2015, GV Films held a ceremony in Mumbai to mark 25 years since its founding. =Other ventures= In 1993, GV Films worked on bringing Michael Jackson to India for two live concerts to be held in Bombay and Madras on December 8 and 10 in aid of the Rajiv Gandhi Foundation. The event was later cancelled prompting the studio to suffer heavy losses and begin litigation. In 2000, GV Films paid $43.6 million to acquire about 8,000 international titles from a seller's offshore investment company Pinewood Films. This included the masters for non- exclusive internet, DVD and theatrical rights. The deal was considered the biggest catalogue buyout by an Indian company. During the same period, GV Films entered into a joint venture with UK internet portal Asian Online. As of 2020, the group of companies is headed by Ishari K. Ganesh.

Archaeologists believe that it was likely erected during the Bronze Age. The Hampton Down ring is part of a tradition of stone circle construction that spread throughout much of Britain, Ireland, and Brittany during the Late Neolithic and Early Bronze Age, over a period between 3,300 and 900 BCE. The purpose of such monuments is unknown, although archaeologists speculate that they were likely religious sites, with the stones perhaps having supernatural associations for those who built the circles. However, it has been suggested that the site is not a stone circle at all, but is instead made up of kerbstones from a Bronze Age round barrow. A number of stone circles were built in the area around modern Dorset, typically being constructed from sarsen stone and being smaller than those found elsewhere. The Hampton Down ring was erected on an open downland ridge overlooking the coast. It originally contained either eight or nine sarsen stones and had a diameter of 20 feet (6.5 metres) across with a track leading to it from the north. By 1908 the circle had been shifted east of its original position, with a hedge built across the site, and the number of stones increased to sixteen. By 1964 the number of stones had further increased to twenty-eight. In 1965, Geoffrey J. Wainwright oversaw an archaeological excavation which revealed the circle's original location and dimensions, after which it was reconstructed in its original location with the extraneous stones removed. Location Positioned at the national grid reference 35960865, Hampton Down Stone Circle is located on the southern edge of an open downland ridge at a height of 680 feet above sea level. Located 1 kilometre (0.6 miles) north-west of Portesham on private land, it is positioned on the rim of Portesham Hill and overlooks the coast. Had the vegetation levels been low at the time of the circle's creation then it would have permitted extensive panoramic views of the coastline. The site is a scheduled monument, and thus accorded legal protection under the Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Areas Act 1979. Context While the transition from the Early Neolithic to the Late Neolithic‚Äîwhich took place with the transition from the fourth to the third millennium BCE‚Äîwitnessed much economic and technological continuity, it also saw a considerable change in the style of monuments erected, particularly in what is now southern and eastern England. By 3000 BCE, the long barrows, causewayed enclosures, and cursuses which had predominated in the Early Neolithic had ceased being built, and were instead replaced by circular monuments of various kinds. These include earthen henges, timber circles, and stone circles. These latter circles are found in most areas of Britain where stone is available, with the exception of the island's south-eastern corner. They are most densely concentrated in south- western Britain and on the north-eastern horn of Scotland, near Aberdeen. The tradition of their construction may have lasted for 2,400 years, from 3300 to 900 BCE, with the major phase of building taking place between 3000 and 1,300 BCE. A photograph of the site as it existed in the first decade of the 20th century. Taken during a visit to the site by the Dorset Natural History and Archaeological Society. These stone circles typically show very little evidence of human visitation during the period immediately following their creation. This suggests that they were not sites used for rituals that left archaeologically visible evidence, and may have been deliberately left as \\"silent and empty monuments\\". The archaeologist Mike Parker Pearson suggested that in Neolithic Britain, stone was associated with the dead and wood with the living. Other archaeologists have suggested that the stone might not represent ancestors, but rather other supernatural entities, such as deities. The area of modern Dorset has only a \\"thin scatter\\" of stone circles, with nine possible examples known within its boundaries. The archaeologist John Gale described these as \\"a small but significant group\\" of such monuments, and all are located within five miles (eight kilometres) of the sea. All but one‚ÄîRempstone Stone Circle on the Isle of Purbeck‚Äîare located on the chalk hills west of Dorchester. The Dorset circles have a simplistic typology, being of comparatively small size, with none exceeding 28 metres (92 feet) in diameter. All are oval in shape, although perhaps have been altered from their original form. With the exception of the Rempstone circle, all consist of sarsen stone. Much of this may have been obtained from the Valley of Stones, a location at the foot of Crow Hill near to Littlebredy, which is located within the vicinity of many of these circles. With the exception of the circle at Litton Cheney, none display evidence of any outlying stones or earthworks around the stone circle. The archaeologists Stuart and Cecily Piggott believed that the circles of Dorset were probably of Bronze Age origin, a view endorsed by the archaeologist Aubrey Burl, who noted that their distribution did not match that of any known Neolithic sites. It is possible that they were not all constructed around the same date, and the Piggotts suggested that while they may well be Early Bronze Age in date, it is also possible that \\"their use and possibly their construction may last into the Middle and even into the Late Bronze Age\\". Their nearest analogies are the circles found on Dartmoor and Exmoor to the west, and the Stanton Drew stone circles to the north. It is also possible that the stone circles were linked to a number of earthen henges erected in Dorset around the same period. Description A plan of the Hampton Down Stone Circle. The grey stones mark the location of the original Bronze Age positioning; the black stones reflect the location of those prior to excavation in 1964. Burl described the Hampton Down Stone Circle as a \\"megalithic chameleon\\". A photograph from 1908 showed sixteen stones as part of the monument, a number that was again recorded by the Piggotts in 1938. However, by 1964 twenty-eight stones were found to be part of the circle. As of 1939, a hedge and bank split the circle in two, from north-to-south, separating the three most westerly stones from the rest of the circle. Investigations revealed that when the field to the east of the hedge was cleared in 1964, a large number of stones had been found on the surface and had been moved to the site of the other stones. It is possible that these other stones had also once been part of a prehistoric monument, such as a long barrow or round barrow, which had once existed in the vicinity. The stones are sarsen. Commenting on the site in 1939, the Piggotts opined that ten stones in the eastern half of the ring were likely in their original position. They expressed the view that \\"owing to [the stone's] rough cube-like shapes it is impossible to decide whether they are upright or recumbent\\". Based on what they believed to be the stones in their original position, they estimated the circle's original diameter at 35 feet (11‚Äì12 metres). =Excavation= In 1964 the stones in the circle were disturbed by agricultural activity. It was then decided that the site would be excavated, a project which was ordered by the Ministry of Public Building and Works and carried out in May 1965 under the directorship of Geoffrey J. Wainwright. The 28 stones were moved from the site using a crane to permit the archaeologists to excavate the area beneath them. Burl proposed that the Hampton Down stones may not have been part of a stone circle but rather the kerbstones of a since-lost Bronze Age round barrow, like that pictured here at the Five Marys near Chaldon Herring. The excavation revealed that the location of the stones was not their original prehistoric position. The original location of the circle was identified as existing a few feet to the west, under the adjacent hedge. The original circle had either eight or possibly nine sockets for stones and was oval shaped. The perimeter of the ring was defined by V-shaped ditches on its eastern and western perimeters. The maximum axis of the circle would have been approximately 20 feet (6.5 metres), making it considerably smaller than the size proposed by the Piggotts. There was a 4 feet (1.2 metre) wide track leading to the circle from the north, with Burl opining that \\"if this had been an avenue it was a very poor one\\". Three stake-holes were found at the western side of the circle, where it was joined by the track. If used as a space for rituals, the Hampton Down circle would have only been able to accommodate a few individuals standing within it at any given time. It was also not the site of any cremation deposits, unlike some stone circles in Northern Britain. Burl suggested that the Hampton Down Stone Circle may never have been part of the prehistoric stone circle tradition, but that the stones were actually once the kerbstones of a round barrow. To support this suggestion, he noted that round barrows were known at Poole, around 20 miles (32 kilometres) to the east of the site. The excavation yielded no finds, and thus it produced no means of reliably dating the construction of the site. Wainwright suggested that the ring was Early Bronze Age on the basis of other, dated circles in Britain. Based on his analysis of the site's stratigraphy, he argued that the stones had likely been removed from their original position amid agricultural development in the second half of the seventeenth century. According to Burl, the history of the site \\"illuminates the perils of superficial fieldwork\\". As of 2003, the Hampton Down ring was the only one of the Dorset circles to have seen excavation. Following excavation, several stones were placed in the original sockets in order to create a reconstruction of the original circle. A fence was then erected around the circle to discourage further interference.

At the time of its description the new genus was comprised of a single species named Cuspilongus cachecreekensis, known from an Eocene fossil found in North America. Subsequently, Kopylov & Rasnitsyn (2016) transferred the Early Cretaceous (Aptian) species Mesocephus ghilarovi Rasnitsyn (1988), known from the Bon-Tsagan locality in Mongolia, to the genus Cuspilongus as well. History and classification C. cachecreekensis is known only from one fossil, a part and counterpart holotype, specimen number F-1545 & F-1546, which is housed in the collections of the Thompson Rivers University in Kamloops, British Columbia. Cuspilongus was described from a specimen which was recovered from outcrops of the early Eocene, Ypresian McAbee Fossil Beds near Cache Creek, British Columbia. The unnamed formation outcropping at the McAbee Fossil Beds preserve an upland temperate flora that was first interpreted as being Microthermal, although further study has shown them to be more mesothermal in nature. The plant community preserved in the McAbee Fossil Beds site is mostly broadleaf pollen with alder and elm dominating, and may represent a successional forest involving multiple volcanic ash eruptions. C. cachecreekensis was first studied by the paleoentomologists S. Bruce Archibald from Simon Fraser University in Burnaby, British Columbia and Alexandr Rasnitsyn of the A. A. Borissiak Paleontological Institute. Their 2015 type description of the new genus and species was published in the journal Canadian Entomologist. The genus name Cuspilongus was coined by the researchers as a combination of the Latin words cuspis which means \\"lance\\" and longus meaning long, in reference to the notable length of the holotype's ovipositor. The specific epithet cachecreekensis is in honor of the town of Cache Creek, British Columbia, west of the type locality. Cuspilongus cachecreekensis was one of three sawfly species described in Archibald & Rasnitsyn's 2015 paper, the other two being Ulteramus republicensis and Ypresiosirex orthosemos, from the Klondike Mountain Formation and the McAbee fossil beds respectively. Description The single described female of C. cachecreekensis is mostly complete, missing the legs entirely, with the antennae preserved in disarticulated segments, and portions of the abdomen are obscured. The female has a body length of approximately and an overall preserved length of with the ovipositor included. The head and thorax are dark in coloration, while the abdomen is light colored in the preserved and visible areas. Similarly the wings are lightly colored to hyaline, with the exception of the intercostal space, which is notably darkened. The abdomen is damaged but the ovipositor is preserved well, being about long with part of the sheath preserved, with both the ovipositor and sheath showing a downward curve. The genus is distinct from other members of the family in the length of the ovipositor, which is similar to the length of the forewing. Living members of the family have ovipositors that are only up to half the length of the forewing.

The 120,000 square foot museum, located on the riverfront in downtown Mobile, Alabama, is designed to look as if it were a ship headed into Mobile Bay and the Gulf of Mexico. The museum features 90 interactive exhibits, simulators, theaters and artifact displays, complemented by artifacts and memorabilia displayed throughout \\"multiple decks\\" inside a full-sized replica of a container ship, displayed as if dockside. GulfQuest also features a museum store, a museum caf√© and several event spaces. Named \\"Attraction of the Year\\" for 2016 by the Alabama Department of Tourism, GulfQuest is the only fully interactive maritime museum in the world and the only maritime museum dedicated to the Gulf of Mexico. GulfQuest presents the history, culture, marine science and maritime traditions of the Gulf of Mexico region for visitors of all ages.  History  During the 1990s, City of Mobile and Alabama state leaders formed a non- profit organization to create a maritime museum to serve as an educational resource for the region and the nation. During the planning portion, then- current Mobile Mayor Mike Dow campaigned for the museum to be the centerpiece of \\"Mobile Landing\\", a downtown waterfront development meant to restore public access to the Mobile waterfront. \\"Mobile Landing\\" would eventually become home to the Alabama Cruise Terminal, the Arthur C. Outlaw Convention Center, and Cooper Riverside Park. The construction of GulfQuest began during Sam Jones' tenure as Mobile's Mayor. Construction ran from 2010 through 2015 with installation of the museum's exhibits completed in the summer of 2015. The museum closed temporarily to the general public in November 2016. The decision to close the museum was made by Mobile Mayor Sandy Stimpson, who wanted the non-profit board to assume an advisory role (rather than direct management of the museum). With staffing provided by the city, GulfQuest reopened in February 2017.  Building  GulfQuest is a 120,000 square foot building designed to look as if it were a ship leaving port headed into Mobile Bay and the Gulf of Mexico. Because the technology behind container ships originated in Mobile, Alabama, and had a dramatic impact on the shipping and maritime industry, GulfQuest's Board of Directors decided to put a full-sized replica of a container ship inside the museum to house most of the museum's 90 exhibits. The replica (dubbed The SS McLean), surrounded by water and made to look like it's floating, has interior walkways resembling those on large ships with the museum's \\"Seagoing Slang\\" displayed throughout each level. = SS McLean = At the heart of the museum is a full-sized replica of a container ship named the SS McLean, commemorating Malcom McLean and Mobile, Alabama's role in the early development of containerization, a revolutionary system that minimized cargo handling and shipping costs. In 1955, Malcom McLean, a trucking entrepreneur from North Carolina, acquired Waterman Steamship Corporation, a Mobile-based firm, to test his idea of shipping cargo in large containers that could be moved fully loaded from land to sea, and from sea to land. On April 26, 1956, the world's first container ship, Ideal-X, made its maiden voyage from New Jersey to Houston with 58 containers on board. McLean's plan reduced the cost of loading and discharging cargo from $5.83 a ton to only 15.8 cents a ton. McLean's first three container ships were \\"spar deck\\" tankers, capable of carrying containers topside only.  Exhibits  Designed to resemble a ship leaving port, GulfQuest is a museum with an educational focus with hands-on exhibits, theaters, simulators and displays. The exhibits featured at GulfQuest include ones that focus on hurricanes, shipwrecks, offshore drilling, sailing, and more. Some of the notable 90-plus interactive exhibits include: = Take the Helm = A panoramic pilot simulator identical to those used to train professional boat pilots. Visitors choose a vessel and try their way in navigating through the Gulf and into Mobile's port. The images displayed in this simulator are designed to represent real locations along the Port of Mobile. = Pelican Girls = The exhibit features images depicting a story of two French woman who sailed from Paris to Mobile on the ship Pelican in 1704 where they were to wed French-Canadian settlers. = The Great Gulf Challenge = An interactive game where visitors take on leadership roles to help restore the delicate balance of the Gulf of Mexico through environmental and economic choices while facing realistic disasters. = Ocean Planet Theater = GulfQuest's Science on a Sphere, a six-foot diameter planet Earth suspended in midair showing three-dimensional visualizations of Earth, hurricanes, global shipping traffic, and much more. = Seagoing Slang = Located on the rampways on either side of the container ship are common sayings with maritime origins highlighted on individual panels. Sayings like \\"All in a Day's Work\\", \\"Clean Bill of Health\\", \\"Cup of Joe\\", \\"Out of the Blue\\", \\"Lay of the Land\\" and more are defined and their maritime origins revealed.  Awards  The Alabama Department of Tourism named GulfQuest / National Maritime Museum of the Gulf of Mexico the state's 2016 \\"Tourism Attraction of the Year.\\" The project was recognized with the \\"Downtown Innovation Award\\" from the Downtown Mobile Alliance/Main Street Mobile in 2015. In addition, Tony Zodrow, GulfQuest's founding Executive Director, was named \\"Maritime Person of the Year\\" by the Propeller Club of the Port of Mobile in 2016.  Restaurant  GulfQuest provides the City of Mobile's only waterfront dining experience with the museum's nautical-themed restaurant, The Galley. The GulfQuest exhibit Shiptracker is located inside The Galley which allows visitors to continue to enjoy the museum experience while dining. Shiptracker allows visitors to view in real-time the shipping activity in Gulf ports including the ships passing by outside on the Mobile River. Museum admission is not required to dine in The Galley.  Museum Store  Treasures, GulfQuest's museum store, is designed to resemble a sunken Spanish Galleon. Fractured hulls of the store reveal the diverse marine life in the Gulf of Mexico with shelves created from the ribs of the vessel filled with GulfQuest souvenirs. Museum admission is not required to visit Treasures.

The granary besides storage tasks could fulfill functions of defense, because the first floor was provided with holes adapted to conduct artillery and gun fire. Role of a grain storage position it held until 1853, when it was bought by the then military authorities from the Polish Bank for the purpose of storage for Modlin Fortress.

The chief governor was the viceroy of the English monarch (and later the British monarch) and presided over the Privy Council of Ireland. In some periods he was in effective charge of the administration, subject only to the monarch in England; in others he was a figurehead and power was wielded by others. Nomenclature \\"Chief governor\\" is an umbrella term favoured by eighteenth-century historians Walter Harris and John Lodge and subsequently used by many historians and statutes.Richardson & Sayles 1963, p.8 It was occasionally used before then. Chief governors were appointed under various titles, the most common of which were: * (Chief) justiciar (13th‚Äì14th centuries) * (King's) lieutenant (14th‚Äì16th century) * Lord Deputy (15th‚Äì17th centuries) * Lord Lieutenant (1660‚Äì1922) more formally Lieutenant General and General Governor or Lieutenant-General and Governor-General; 1 & 2 William IV c.17 s.1 \\"WHEREAS his gracious Majesty has been pleased ... to appoint ... one lieutenant general and governor general of that part of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland called Ireland, commonly called \\"The Lord Lieutenant of Ireland\\": ...

Less common titles include procurator and gubernator, and the temporary title custos or keeper. Sometimes individuals with different titles served simultaneously, in which case the order of precedence was: lieutenant > justiciar > custos > deputy (lieutenant) > deputy justiciar. The title \\"Deputy\\", and later \\"Lord Deputy\\", was originally applied to the resident deputy of a non-resident king's lieutenant, when the latter title was an honour bestowed on a favoured English noble. Latterly, such resident deputies were called Lord Justices. Statute Law Revision Acts passed in the 1890s trimmed formulas such as \\"the Lord Lieutenant or other Chief Governor or Governors of Ireland\\" from older acts of parliament, standardising to \\"the Lord Lieutenant\\". ; ; ; ; ; ; History In Norman Ireland as in England, a chief justiciar combined executive and judicial functions. The judicial office of Lord Chief Justice of Ireland later separated from that of the chief governor. In the fifteenth century, chief governors, especially the Earls of Kildare, began taking initiatives in the Parliament of Ireland contrary to the wishes of the English court. This prompted the passing of Poynings' Law in 1495 to make Irish laws subject to amendment and veto by the Privy Council of England. From 1569 to 1672, much of the land was under martial law and the Lord Deputy had regional deputies in the Lord President of Munster and Lord President of Connaught. From the Williamite Wars till the Constitution of 1782, the Lord Lieutenant was a British noble who came to Ireland only every two years, when Parliament was in session; his main role was to steer legislation through Parliament. Three ex-officio Lords Justices deputised in the Lord Lieutenant's absences. In 1757 the Earl of Kildare (later 1st Duke of Leinster) was one of the Lords Justices and hoped to be made sole Lord Deputy, but was rebuffed. After the Acts of Union 1800, the Parliament was abolished and political administration was done by the Chief Secretary for Ireland. The role of Lord Lieutenant (or Viceroy) was ceremonial and there were calls for it to be abolished. He resided in the Viceregal Lodge throughout his term, but no Irishman was appointed till Viscount FitzAlan in the office's final year. During the Irish War of Independence, Lord French attempted to maintain a more activist role, but was rebuffed. The Government of Ireland Act 1920 created Northern Ireland and Southern Ireland but retained a single Lord Lieutenant for both. When the Irish Free State replaced Southern Ireland in December 1922, the Lord Lieutenant was replaced and separated into the Governor-General of the Irish Free State (abolished in 1936) and the Governor of Northern Ireland (abolished in 1973).

Ewan, S. Innes, S. Reynolds, R. Pipes eds., The Biographical Dictionary of Scottish Women, Edinburgh University Press 2004, p95 For over thirty years Devine held a number of different union management posts, with a short break after tensions with the full-time union secretary, John F. Sime. She returned in 1915 and actively encouraged union support for rent strikers in Dundee following the Glasgow example. In 1923 a large popular vote made her vice- president of the union. One year later she was elected president, and continued in that role for the next six years. This involved negotiations with the employers' Association of Jute Spinners and Manufacturers where she proved herself capable and forceful. Devine was known as a blunt speaker and was prepared to be combative with employers. After once more becoming vice- president of the union she left when she went to work in a different mill but was back in 1938 as a trustee for the union, its delegate to the Trades Council and also to the Labour Party. In 1939 she opened evidence for the union at an enquiry about conditions for employees under sixteen years old. It was conducted by Harold Morris on behalf of the Home Secretary in response to a request, ultimately unsuccessful, from Dundee jute manufacturers to exempt them from a new law limiting the working week for under-16s to 44 hours. At a retirement presentation for J.F. Sime in 1940, Devine spoke about the progress made since 1914 in improving conditions for local mill workers. She died in Dundee on 13 April 1960.

She was also known as \\"Miss Lizzie\\" and the people of Milwaukee called Plankinton the \\"municipal patroness\\" because of her generosity. One of her gifts was a large monetary donation that built the first YWCA in Milwaukee. She also purchased an elaborate large scale pipe organ for the newly constructed city auditorium. She supported local artists and artisans. One of her notable gifts was the 1885 statue of George Washington that was ultimately placed in Milwaukee's Monument Square. It is nine feet tall and sits on a twelve-foot base. This was the first piece of public art for the city and was sculptured by her fiance. Plankinton had a three-bedroom mansion built for her in an upscale Milwaukee neighborhood as a wedding gift from her father. Her fiance abandoned her for a dancer from Minneapolis. Distraught, she lost interest in the mansion. It stood empty for a decade and eventually sold to a widow.  Biography  Elizabeth Anne Plankinton was born in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, on July 27, 1853. She was a daughter of John Plankinton and Elizabeth Brasker (some records show Bracken or Brucken). Her older brother, William, was born in 1844 and her sister, Hannah, in 1851; Hannah died of a heart condition in 1870 when Plankinton was seventeen.  Elizabeth Plankinton House  The Elizabeth Plankinton House was a three-bedroom mansion in the upscale Milwaukee neighborhood of west Grand Ave that was built by businessman and millionaire John Plankinton and was listed in the National Register of Historic Places. It was constructed in 1886‚Äì87 at a cost of $100,000 (equivalent to $ million in ). and was located across the street from his own palatial residence. His daughter, Elizabeth, was engaged to marry American sculptor Richard Henry Park, and he built the house to give to her as a wedding gift. The marriage never took place, as on 18 September 1887,Record #175 in marriages in the County of Ottawa, Michigan Park abandoned Elizabeth and married a dancer from Minneapolis instead. Distraught, Elizabeth completely lost interest in the mansion, rejecting her wedding gift and never living in the residence which bore her name; instead, she travelled the world. The mansion stood empty for nearly ten years before eventually being sold to a widow in 1896, who lived in it to 1904. It was resold by her family in 1910 to the Knights of Columbus, who continued to occupy and use it until 1978. It was acquired by the Milwaukee redevelopment authority in 1967, and then transferred it to Marquette University in 1975. The house provoked strong feelings at that time, with local historian H. Russell Zimmermann arguing for its preservation on historic grounds, in which he was supported by an analysis by the Historic American Buildings Survey (HABS). However, local opinions included that it was an \\"eyesore,\\" an \\"ugly behemoth,\\" and a \\"monument to Victorian bad taste,\\" and it was entirely surrounded by university buildings by 1980. A representative of Marquette University declared that the \\"mansion is neither historical nor architecturally significant. It is the product of the whims of the owner and the architect, and does not represent a true example of any particular style of architecture.\\" The university demolished it in October 1980 to make room for student facilities; this occurred approximately two months after the HABS survey report has been issued, and despite the House having been listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1976. Its destruction was a significant factor in the 1981 formation of the City of Milwaukee Historic Preservation Commission, with the aim of protecting Milwaukee's architectural heritage.  Philanthropy  Plankinton followed in her father's footsteps as a humanitarian and was affectionately called \\"Miss Lizzie\\" by the citizens of Milwaukee. She continued the tradition of philanthropy and historical records show that Miss Plankinton gave many gifts to the citizens of Milwaukee for their benefit. Out of respect, she was referred to as the \\"municipal patroness\\" because of her spirit of giving. One of her public gifts was a $100,000 donation (equivalent to $ million in ) in 1892 that ultimately built in 1899 the first YWCA hotel of the city (pictured) for affordable housing for working women. She also purchased a $10,000 pipe organ (equivalent to $ million in ) for the then-new half million dollar 1909 Milwaukee Auditorium. = Milwaukee Washington monument = Washington statue Plankinton's most notable gift was a George Washington bronze statue for the city of Milwaukee, first announced in January 1885. Sculpted by 47 year old Park and dedicated in November 1885, it was the first piece of public art in Milwaukee, and cost around $20,000 (equivalent to $,000 in ). George Washington is portrayed in uniform as the 43-year-old commander-in-chief of the Continental Army, and stands tall on a granite base. The complete statue assembly with its 12 foot pedestal sits on a Wauwatosa limestone foundation that is square and deep consisting of 4 steps. Inscriptions on the sculpture include: on the lower left side, \\"RH PARK SC,\\" acknowledging the sculptor (who was Plankinton's then-fianc√©); on back of the base, \\"The Gift of / Elizabeth A. Plankinton / To the City of Milwaukee / 1885\\"; and, on the front of the base, simply \\"WASHINGTON\\". At the foot of statue are two bronze figures, a mother and a child, which were included following a specific request from Plankinton. At a time when immigrants were coming in large numbers to live in Milwaukee, their inclusion is intended to portray a mother showing her child the father of the United States as a message on the importance of history or education. In 2016‚Äì2018, the statue was extensively restored.  Later life  Some time before World War I, Plankinton built a large home in Dresden, Germany, where she spent several months of the year. She was trapped there when the war broke out, and the government impounded her property in the United States. She visited Milwaukee after the war, but was in Europe as her health deteriorated, and she died in Lucerne in Switzerland in 1923. She was buried in the Forest Home Cemetery in Milwaukee, alongside her father, step mother, brother, and sister, near the monument and pillar erected after her father's death. In her will, she left considerable bequests to the people of Milwaukee, including $50,000 (equivalent to $ million in ) each to the YWCA, the Milwaukee Hospital, and the Milwaukee-Downer College, to whom she had already endowed $65,000 shortly before her death. After her father's death, Plankinton commissioned artist Susan Frackelton and her daughter, Gladys Frackelton Seely, to prepare and illustrate a hand-illuminated volume, Voices of Friends (also known as the Plankinton memorial book), with reminiscences of him from his personal friends, \\"who knew and loved him well.\\" It was displayed at the Layton Art Gallery, to whom Plankinton bequeathed $25,000 in her will. The gallery has since closed, but the volume has become a part of the rare books collection of the Milwaukee Central Library. Plankinton's share of her father's estate was held in trust for her children, and as she never had a child, her share went to her nephew, William Woods Plankinton.

Released in 1994 through Jeff Mills' Axis Records label, it is considered a landmark release in the techno genre and one of the minimal techno's key founding documents. A restored and remasterered reissue of the album, featuring several tracks that were originally left off, was released in 2009. A triple LP reissue was also released on Hood's own record label, M-Plan, in 2015. Background and music Fact magazine critic Marcus Scott stated that each track on the record \\"consists of rolling riffs that stammer and bounce across the metronomic rhythm, breaking the momentum with tiny synapse snapping manipulations. According to Wondering Sound critic Philip Sherburne, the album \\"rendered the familiar thump and squelch of Detroit techno even stranger, subtracting all remaining traces of disco and R&B; and imagining rhythm as a kind of chattering conversation between sentient machines.\\" It also features traces of jazz, \\"with the clash of fixed-interval chords undercutting conventional key signatures.\\" According to Hood, he developed Minimal Nations sound after coming across a chord sound on a Roland Juno 2 keyboard and \\"realizing that he didn't need anything else other than the chord sound and a particular pattern\\".

Construction of the barrier began in September 2016 and took a few months. The intent of the project was to prevent the smuggling and illegal crossing of migrants from the Middle East, mainly from Syria, who have used Russia as a route of entry into Norway (and thus into the European Union's passport-free Schengen Area). Background In 2016, 5,500 asylum-seekers illegally entered Norway from Russia. Because it is illegal to drive from Russia to Norway without proper legal permission, and crossing on foot is prohibited, the migrants make the crossing on bicycles. At the end of September 2016, it was discovered that some foundations have to be moved, since the border treaty says that there shall be no built object within from the border on each side, and some foundations were built up to too close to the border.M√• flytte deler av omstridt gjerde p√• Storskog √©n centimeter Barrier The barrier is located at the Storskog border crossing. It is built of steel and stands long and high. The fence includes a gate for the road traffic, built so people cannot walk through it when it is closed. Juxtaposed border control An agreement is in place that the Russian border control do not allow people to cross the border if they do not have proper visas into Norway. This means that they cannot apply for asylum since they never reach Norway. In doubtful cases, Norwegian border police are allowed to see the passports while the bearer has to wait in the Russian station.Storskog: Nye ¬´sykkelasyls√∏kere¬ª p√• vei? (Human Rights Service, 6 Oct 2016, In Norwegian) This is the background for the barrier, preventing people from escaping the station and running to Norway. Incidents On 15 August 2017, a Syrian citizen ran through the Russian border control and tried to climb over the fence. Russian Border Guards stopped him.Syrer pr√∏vde √• klatre over piggtr√•dgjerde inn til Norge In July 2017 two persons were arrested by Russian guards for trying to pass the border outside the station. Old barrier The Norwegian-Russian border, seen from Skafferhullet, Norway, with a Norwegian fence. There exists an older barrier at the old border control site at Skafferhullet near the Pasvik river 4 km west of Storskog. It was probably built around 1960 when the road was used for construction of the Borisoglebsky hydroelectric station, and only accessible for authorised traffic. This border crossing was passable for general public before 1940 and again in 1965. Furthermore, there are fences around the Pasvik River hydroelectric stations, of which some are located on the border. These fences are not considered to be border fences, but private installation fences. Russian barrier There is a fence along the entire Russian border to Norway and Finland, built by the Soviet Union. It is located one or a few kilometres from the border, and has automatic alarms detecting if someone climbs over it. There is a simple gravel road along both entire borders,https://maps.google.com permitted only for border guards and other authorised people, enabling quick response if an alarm goes off.

This was in fact a series of rallies against the Prime Minister Mian Nawaz Sharif, over the claims of corruption of the Sharif Family in the wake of Panama Papers. The march initially began on 7 August 2016 from Peshawar. The march was organised by the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf party.  Background  Following exposure of offshore companies of Prime Minister's children in the Panama Papers published by International Consortium of Investigative Journalists, Imran Khan's political party Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) started demanding the resignation of Mian Nawaz Sharif. Imran Khan, in many of his interviews and addresses termed that Prime Minister has lost the moral authority to run the government due to his children being named in the Panam Papers. The opposition also demanded the Government organizations National Accountability Bureau, Federal Investigation Agency, Election Commission of Pakistan to start investigations in this regard for disqualification of the Prime Minister. The Government Organization's inaction in this regard led the PTI to organise rallies and demonstrations throughout Pakistan.  Protest Jalsas in various cities  On 31 July 2016, in a press conference, Imran Khan said that they will have to make a choice between a \\"corrupt government\\" and \\"strong democracy\\". He hinted at starting a march against Prime Minister. \\"The march will be a defining moment in the history of Pakistan,\\" he said. However, the protest will not end there but the movement will continue for weeks in several different cities across the country.  The Peshawar Protest  On Sunday, 7 August 2016 Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) led by Imran Khan held the first Ehtesab rally kicking off from Peshawar and culminating at Attock Bridge. However, when they reached Kohat a large number of protesters belonging to PML-N, burning tyres on roads at four different points, came face to face with participants of PTI rally, compelling Khan's supporters to change their route.  In Islamabad  On, 13 August 2016 PTI led crowd gathered to register their protest against the Government. PTI Chairman urged the Supreme Court of Pakistan to take suo moto notice of revelations made in Panama Leaks regarding offshore wealth of the ruling family. The PML-N leaders later criticised Imran Khan and said that fewer number of people in the rally shows Imran Khan is losing his support in the country due to his politics of rallies and protests.  Jhelum Bye-Election  The Election Commission of Pakistan barred Imran Khan to hold rally in Jhelum due to the bye-elections to be held on 31 August 2016. But Imran Khan did not follow the instructions and attended the jalsa. Huge number of people gathered to welcome Imran Khan, who badly criticised PML-N and Election Commission of Pakistan for its biasness towards PML-N Government. Despite defeat in the elections, the huge number of votes cast for PTI candidate, geared PTI for further rallies.  Lahore rally  PTI, in an astonishing move, invited Pakistan Peoples Party, which it had earlier criticised time and again over the alleged corruption scandals, to attend the Ehtesab rally On 3 September 2016. Imran Khan again demanded PM‚Äôs resignation over Panama papers link, in his speech in the rally from Shahdra Town to Chairing Cross. Khan also asked FBR and NAB to take notice of the Panama papers and take action against the ruling PML-N. On the same day, Muhammad Tahir-ul-Qadri, a scholar of Sufism along with an outspoken politician Shaikh Rasheed Ahmad also held a rally called Qasas Rally in the Rawalpindi city interlinked with Islamabad, the capital city. Huge number of people gathered in Lahore rally and Rawalpindi for the protest. Whole of Rawalpindi was containerized at many junctions on the day to stop any bad incident. There were reports of two deaths due to the protests and road blockages due to containers. The Government minister lashed out at PTI for its politics and blamed a huge loss to economy on PTI. Along with the street movement PTI also filed references against Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif in the ECP and office of the Speaker, National Assembly. While the party also submitted a petition in Supreme Court of Pakistan.

Environmental issues in New York State include water, waste disposal, hydraulic fracturing, air quality, and invasive species. Water In New York State there are a multitude of water issues. In 2016 there was a harmful algal bloom (HABs). There are a multitude of bodies of water that are being affected by this for example, Chautauqua Lake was reported with (HABs) as well as a high toxin report. In Cattaraugus County the Allegheny Reservoir* was confirmed with algal blooms but no toxins. There are many more than 50 affected by (HABs). In 1984, the \\"State Acid Deposition Control Act\\" (SADCA) required the reduction of SO2 emissions from existing sources and further NOx emission controls on new sources in New York State.\\" Issues other causing and or helping the acid rain continue is power plants and automobiles. The environmental impact is eroding the ornamental facades, but it also messes with the sensitivity of an ecosystem like the Adirondack Mountains because the acid rains impacts the adequate soil buffering capacity to counter the acids deposited to it.  New York State's waste disposal management  There are a multitude of different types of waste that is disposed in York State some of them being household hazardous waste (HHW), construction and demolition debris, industrial/commercial waste, regulated medical waste, waste tires, used oil, and much more. Some of the issues that York State faces is there are so many different kinds of waste that needs to be disposed of and there is not enough room for it to go.  High-volume hydraulic fracturing  High-volume hydraulic fracturing in New York State(NYS) is no longer a problem but was earlier. Problems with this were contamination of drinking water. It polluted the air with tons of natural gas that was pumped from the ground. The drinking water at point was flammable when pedestrians and home owners would light their drinking water on fire. The smell of the gases impacted homeowners health very badly making some sick. But also it took up a lot of space and affected the living lifestyles of those that were near the sites where they pumped. Another impacted was habitat loss due to the large structures.  Air quality  According to the American Lung Association's report State of the Air 2012, Monroe County received a grade of 'C' for ground-level ozone. That means Monroe County had four orange-alert days. That's up from the 2011 report when we had got an 'F'. Back in 2004, Rochester was ranked 43rd worst metropolitan area for air quality. (Dirty Air, Dirty Power.) And, the last time the EPA measured Monroe County for ground- level ozone in 1997, we received a 'marginal' grade, up from the previous 'non attainment' grade.  Invasive species  Here is an image of the goby that is an invasive species in New York State. In New York State there are a multitude of different invasive species including the Asian carp, the zebra mussel, emerald ash borer, purple loosestrife, the goby and more. An unfortunate byproduct of world travel and trade is the introduction of unwanted invasive species. Shipping pallets and crates, luggage, the ballast water of boats and even people can unintentionally transport invasive plants, insects and diseases to new areas. Without knowing that they would become problematic, some species have been introduced intentionally for use in landscaping, agriculture and other purposes. Invasive species impact all aspects of life, from recreation to livelihood. Spotted knapweed is an invasive plant that can take over crop fields, limiting crop production and feed for livestock. Hemlock woolly adelgid is an invasive insect that exfoliates and kills hemlock trees, a key species in maintaining important habitat along waterways.

Because the tracks cannot be angled relative to the hull (in any operational design), steering must be accomplished by speeding one track up, slowing the other down (or reversing it), or a combination of both. The half- tracks avoid this by combining steerable wheels and fixed-speed tracks. Early steering systems were adopted from tracked work vehicles, generally using a clutch to reduce power to one track, causing it to slow down. These designs have numerous problems, notably when climbing hills or running at high speed, as the reduction in power causes the overall speed to slow. Delivering power to both tracks while turning them at different speeds is a difficult design problem. A series of more advanced designs were introduced, especially through World War II, that maintained power to both tracks during steering, a concept known as regenerative steering. Some also allowed one track to move forward while the other reversed, allowing the tank to spin in place, a concept known as neutral steering. The first really successful system was the British double differential design of 1924, which was copied by both the United States and Germany. Most modern Western designs use a variation of the double differential, while Soviet designs preferred to use two separate transmissions in a single housing. Systems using electric motors with variable speed controls have been tried on a number of occasions, but have not entered widespread service.  Dual drive  One solution to the steering problem is to use two separate drivetrains, each driving one track. This maintains power to both tracks while steering, produces a wide range of turning circles, and even allows one track to be reversed while the other moves forward, allowing the tank to turn in place. This may be combined with brakes to further control the steering radius. The obvious disadvantage to this design is the cost and complexity of two drive trains, and the increased maintenance load that implies. Another is that if one engine fails, the other cannot be used to drive both tracks. Both of these problems were greatly reduced in the case of steam power, where the majority of the engine in terms of size and weight is the boiler, and the cylinders that extract that power are much smaller in comparison. It can also provide variable output by controlling the amount of steam sent to each cylinder. It is much more complex when used with internal combustion engines. A less obvious problem is that it is very difficult to keep such a vehicle moving in a straight line. Although a governor can be used to ensure the two engine speeds are similar, loads on the tracks will not be the same as it moves over different terrain, causing the more heavily loaded track to slow and the tank to turn in that direction. This will cause the tank to wander when moving over uneven ground. This is not an issue at very low speeds, and the system is sometimes used on bulldozers and other tracked construction vehicles. For tanks, considerable driver skill and constant adjustment are needed, even at the relatively low speeds seen on early designs. Examples of true twin-drive systems are not common, but have existed through much of tank history. Examples include the World War I-era British Whippet medium tank, and the M5 Stuart.  Twin transmission, or geared steering  Soviet tanks, like this T-72, use advanced variants of the dual transmission system to this day. A simple step up from the dual-drive concept is to use a single engine and split the power output into two transmissions. Steering is accomplished by changing the gear on one track and not the other. This reduces the complexity of the dual-drive system when combined with a modern engine. It also introduces a new behaviour; additional load on one track causes the other to slow as well. This is actually an improvement over the dual drive solution, as it causes the entire tank to slow, not turn towards the loaded track. The downside to this approach is that high-power transmissions are failure-prone devices, especially in the World War II era. They are also complex and time-consuming devices to build and repair. Although it eliminates a second engine, compared to the dual-drive concept, it is still relatively complex compared to the solutions that follow. Dual-drive systems were widely used since the earliest days of tracked vehicles, including the Holt 75 tractor that saw widespread use in World War I. The Japanese adopted the concept in 1925, and all their subsequent tanks through World War II used this. The British also continued to use it on light tanks like the Covenanter and Crusader of the early war period. The Czech LTH also adopted the system, seeing service with the Germans as the Panzer 38(t). The Soviets introduced this system for their KV-13 experimental tank, and this led to its use in the IS tank family. Later versions introduced more gears to produce multiple turning radii, including reversing one track. The T-64 introduced a new model with seven speeds, and this basic system has been used on the T-72, T-90 and Chinese Type 98.  Clutch braking  The T-34 was one of the most successful tanks designed specifically to use the clutch steering system. The simplest single-engine steering system in mechanical terms, and almost universally used on early tank designs, was the combination of a brake and a clutch connected to steering controls. The controls were normally a pair of vertical handles, one for each track. Pulling on a handle disengaged the clutch, releasing that track and causing it to slow down. Further motion of the handle increasingly applied the brake to that track, allowing the turning circle to be adjusted. The main disadvantage of this design is that when steering is applied the engine power is removed from the track. This makes the tank slow down, even if the brake is not applied. If the tank is climbing, or in soft terrain, forward motion may stop entirely. Another disadvantage is that the brakes constantly dissipate vast amounts of heat when steering, which is very power-inefficient. The brakes suitable to steer a large vehicle are also impracticably large. Clutch braking was introduced by the French in 1916 during World War I. Most light tanks used it through the 1920s and 30, as well as some larger tanks like the British experimental Vickers Independent and Soviet T-35. The last major designs to use it were the Soviet T-34 and German Panzer III and Panzer IV.  Differential braking  The Universal Carrier was a widespread example of the braked differential system. Differential braking (or braked differential) systems remove the clutches on the track and add a differential on the transmission output. The differential allows the tracks to turn at different speeds while remaining powered. Steering is then accomplished by slowing one track with a brake. The advantage to this design is that power is maintained to both tracks even while steering is taking place. Another advantage is outright simplicity; the steering system connects directly to the brake and nothing else, producing a very simple mechanical arrangement. The main disadvantage, like the clutch braking system, is that steering dissipates heat through the brakes. Unlike the clutched system, however, in this case all turning requires braking. This can be used on lighter tanks, but the amount of kinetic energy in larger tanks makes the required brakes impractically large. Another disadvantage is that the differential will allow the tracks to turn at different speeds no matter what the cause may be. This may be the application of braking, but also occurs as the tank travels over terrain; if one side of the tank enters softer terrain and slows down, the tank will naturally turn towards that side. Forward momentum tends to offset this effect, so it is mainly a problem at low speeds. Differential braking actually predates clutch braking on tracked vehicles, having been initially introduced by Richard Hornsby & Sons in 1905 on the world's first tracked vehicle. Clutch braking became popular only because of its mechanical simplicity. Differential braking could be found on many smaller tanks, especially in the pre-World War II era. British tanks began using them during World War I, and continued into World War II. One common example was the Bren Carrier.  Controlled differential  The M113 is the most widely used military example of the controlled differential system. Differential braking systems are essentially an epicyclic transmission with a single fixed gear ratio transmitted through idler pinions. The controlled differential adds an extension to the rack holding the idlers, and puts a conventional brake on that extension. With the brake applied, the idlers are locked and the system works like a conventional epicyclic. When the brake is released, the idlers spin, reducing the speed of rotation on that side. This causes the output on that side to slow down by a fixed amount. The advantage to this design is that the brake is not being applied to slow the vehicle, it is simply clutching the second set of gears in or out. This means it does not dissipate energy, except in the brief period it is being applied or released. Smoother steering can be accomplished by partial application of the brake, but then it begins to dissipate energy like the braked differential. The main disadvantage is that there is only one turning radius. Like the standard differential solution, these systems are also subject to self-turning when travelling over terrain. The system was invented by Cleveland Tractor Company in 1921, and is sometimes known by the trademarked name Cletrac Differential. It was used by most French tanks in the inter-war era, as well as on the German Grosstraktor. It was most common on US designs, used on all light and mediums from 1932 until the end of World War II. Later uses included the French AMX 13, Japanese Type 61, and the widely produced US M113 APC.  Double differential  The Tiger was one of the first tanks to make widespread use of the double differential. The more complex double differential system is similar to the controlled differential in basic concept, in that it controls the speed of the tracks by controlling the rotation of the idlers. However, in this case two complete differentials are used, one for each track, and the idlers are controlled not by a brake, but a second power shaft, the steering shaft. Normally the steering shaft is connected to the engine directly, instead of the output from the transmission. This means it spins at a relatively narrow range of RPM compared to the main drive shaft. The steering shaft is split into two output shafts through a clutch system that allows the outputs to spin forward, backward, or not at all. An idler reverses the direction on one side, so they always spin in opposite directions. With the clutch off, so the shaft does not spin, the idlers in the two differentials are fixed in place. This is just like the controlled differential with the brake on. When the steering clutch is engaged, the shaft spins one of the idler sets forward and the other backward, causing one track to speed up and the other to slow down. Since the speed difference of the two tracks is independent of the gearbox selection, this makes the steering effect less pronounced at higher speeds; this means the tank has a longer turning radius at higher speeds, which is generally what is wanted. The system, however, produces only one radius for any given gearbox selection. The system is fully regenerative, all of the engine's power reaches the track either through the main driveshaft or the steering system, none of the energy is being lost to brakes or clutches. Additionally, since power is fed around the transmission to the steering system, in some designs the tank can be turned even when the main gearbox is not engaged. The limitation on this feature is the strength of the steering shaft, which has to be strong enough to move the tank if this feature is desired, but otherwise can be made lighter if this is not needed. Double differentials were first used in experiments in France starting in 1921, and found on many heavy tanks of World War II, including the German Tigers. The addition of a continuously variable output using a hydrostatic transmission was used on the Char B1, providing smooth changes in turning radius that eliminated the system's main drawback. The low efficiency of this system meant it was not widely used, but rapid improvement in hydrodynamic fluid couplings made it common in the post-war era. Most Western tank designs since the 1960s have used a variation on this design, notably the M60 Patton and M1 Abrams. = Merritt‚ÄìBrown triple differential = The Churchill was the first tank to use the triple differential steering system. This system was devised by Dr. H. E. Merritt, Director of Tank Design at Woolwich Arsenal, and manufactured by David Brown Ltd. The triple differential is a modification to the double differential, replacing the steering clutches with a single braked differential similar to a controlled differential. This third differential produces any desired output speed in the steering shaft, compared to the double differential where the speed of the shaft is fixed. This output drives the steering idlers of an otherwise unchanged double differential, producing continuously variable steering. It has all the advantages of the double differential, while the only disadvantage is that the brake on the third differential dissipates some energy while slipping, but this is dependent only on the amount of energy being used to steer the vehicle, not the total energy being delivered to the tracks. The triple differential was used primarily on war-time and post-war British tanks, first on the Churchill tank and later on the Cromwell tank and its follow-on designs. It gave these designs unparalleled maneuverability and the ability to climb that was not matched by other designs until well into the Cold War. The basic version continued to be used on British designs until the TN 10 of the Conqueror and the TN 12 on the Chieftain. This system is generally not used today, in favour of improved hydrodynamic transmissions in the double differential, starting with the transmission in the Challenger. = Maybach double differential = The Panther was the sole operational user of the Maybach system. The Maybach system is essentially a simplified version of the double differential, or more accurately in mechanical terms, a double controlled differential. It replaces the double differential's forward and reverse steering shaft and clutch system with a single shaft that spins in one direction, and brakes on the idlers. Like the controlled differential, the brakes are normally applied to keep the idlers fixed. The steering inputs release one or the other brake to cause the idler to spin and that track to slow. Unlike the full double differential, the other side is not sped up so the system is not fully regenerative, and since both idler sets spin in the same direction, it does not offer neutral steering. The Maybach system was used only on a single design, the Panther tank. The late-war state of Germany's economy, especially machining capability and supply of strong materials, meant that only small numbers of the complex double differential could be produced. For the Panther, intended to be mass-produced, Maybach designed the AK7-200 transmission with a number of design notes intended to simplify production.  Electric transmissions  The Char Saint-Chamond used a petrol-electric transmission. Porsche's Elefant tank destroyer used a petrol-electric transmission, but proved highly unreliable. Early steering systems were inefficient and lost so much power that they were ineffective for heavy vehicles. Holt Manufacturing Company (the ancestor of Caterpillar Inc.) whose track design influenced early tanks, experimented with a petrol-electric transmission in their Holt gas electric tank. A comparable design was used on the French Saint-Chamond and in turn adapted to be fitted in a test vehicle of the British Mark II series. None of these were particularly successful, although several hundred units of the Saint-Chamond were produced. While moderately successful, these early systems were large and extremely heavy; the one in the Saint-Chamond added five tons. The other designs, and follow-ons using a similar system, were generally dismissed as impractical. Some of the first attempts at new electric transmissions were made by the British early- war period TOG experiments, and by the Germans as part of mid-war experiments in heavy tanks. The most notable among the German efforts was the Porsche entry for the contest that would eventually produce the Tiger. The chassis from these designs were later converted to a number of other roles, including the Elefant (initially \\"Ferdinand\\") tank destroyer. This style of transmission was also used in the super-heavy Panzer VIII Maus. In practice, the powertrain of the Porsche designs proved even less reliable than the traditional type, and by the late war era the supply of copper was too limited to consider using so much in drivetrain motors.

The family started focused on small geostationary communications satellites. The first iterations focused on the sub-5 kW commercial segment that was left vacated after the retirement of the HS-376 satellite bus. It started with the STARBus on CTA Space Systems, which was later bought by Orbital Sciences, Oribtal ATK and now Northrop Grumman Innovation Systems. History Originally developed by CTA Space Systems, won its first order with IndoStar-1. Orbital Sciences Corporation acquired CTA in 1997 and continued selling the platform under the STAR-1 designation. It was able to sell three STAR-1 satellites to B-SAT of Japan, BSAT-2a, BSAT-2b and BSAT-2c. Orbital then introduced a new version of the platform known as STAR-2. Its first launch was with the sale of the satellite bus only, with N-STAR c. With the introduction of the LEOStar satellite bus, STAR-2 was renamed as GEOStar-2, a platform that eventually was capable of up to 5.5 kW of power production. Orbital would later introduce the GEOStar-1 platform, capable of only 1.5 kW of power production. It is not to be confused with the original STAR-1, since GEOStar-1 is actually the project Aquila, a platform even smaller than the GEOStar-2 designed for military applications in geostationary orbit and medium Earth orbit. On March 10, 2014, Orbital introduced the GEOStar-3 platform. Not only was this a bigger platform that could generate up to 8 kW of power, but it also offered a satellite stacking feature for a dual launch option. On April 29, 2014, Orbital Sciences announced that it would merge with Alliant Techsystems to create a new company called Orbital ATK, Inc.. On February 9, 2015, Orbital ATK started operating as an entity. During 2015, Orbital ATK would introduce a variation of the bus dedicated to servicing spacecrafts in geostationary orbit, the Gemini bus. They would announce their first win for Gemini platform on April 12, 2016, with the agreement to sell the services of Mission Extension Vehicle-1 to Intelsat in 2019. Platforms Through the years there have been different variations of the platform: * Gemini: platform designed for rendezvous capabilities. It can carry payloads with a mass of up to and requiring up to 3 kW of power. Its expected design life is 6 to 15 years and has a 21 to 36 month to delivery lead time. * GEOStar-1: micro platform for government satellite. It can carry payloads with a mass of up to and requiring up to 1.5 kW of power. Its expected design life is 5 to 7 years and has a 27 to 30 month to delivery lead time. * GEOStar-2 (originally STAR-2): small platform for commercial clients. It can carry payloads with a mass of up to and requiring up to 5.5 kW of power. Its expected design life is 15 to 18 years and has a 24 to 27 month to delivery lead time. * GEOStar-3: medium platform for commercial clients. It can carry payloads with a mass of up to and requiring up to 8 kW of power. Its expected design life is 15 to 18 years and has a 27 to 30 month to delivery lead time. * STAR-1 (originally STARBus): small commercial satellite platform. Originally developed by CTA, bought by Orbital Sciences Corporation. Could handle payloads with a mass of up to and requiring up to 555 W of power. It used a solid Star 30CBP apogee kick motor for orbital circularization and had a 10-year design life.

In the 3rd century CE, Tondai Nadu was ruled by Ilandiraiyan, the first king with the title \\"Tondaiman\\", whom P. T. Srinivasa Iyengar identifies with a Pallava prince. Pallavas moved southwards, adopted local traditions to their own use, and named themselves as Tondaiyar after the land called Tondai. The medieval Pallavas ruled Andhra and Northern Tamil Nadu, from the 4th to the 9th centuries, with their seat of capital at ancient Kanchipuram. It was captured by the second Chola monarch Aditya (reigned ca. 871-907 CE). He defeated the armies of the Pallavas of Kanchipuram and claimed all of Tondai Nadu; the region north of the Kaveri basin around Palar river basin including present day Chittoor and Nellore district of Andhra Pradesh, as Chola territory. The region was then a part of Vijayanagara Empire, first ruling from Hampi and then headquartered at Chandragiri in present-day Andhra Pradesh.

The chain operated large hotels in major airline hubs across Europe and eventually throughout the world. The hotels provided accommodation to crews from the partner airlines, thus guaranteeing high occupancy. In 1984, Lufthansa bought a controlling interest in the chain from British Airways, which had been formed in 1974 by the merger of BOAC and BEA. In 1993, German investor Dieter Bock, CEO of Lonrho, one of the chain's owners, arranged its sale to Hong Kong businessman Cheng Yu-tung, which is the founder and majority owner of Chow Tai Fook group and its associate company New World Development. From 1992‚Äì93 to 1993‚Äì94 financial years, Renaissance Hotels, a second-tier subsidiary of New World, acquired the management rights of 21 Penta hotels in Europe. New World owned Renaissance Hotels via its 64% owned subsidiary New World Hotels (Holdings). In June 1995, New World Development's hotel operations were consolidated into New World Hotels (Holdings)'s listed subsidiary Renaissance Hotel Group and the Penta Hotels brand disappeared from the market. New World Development sold Renaissance Hotel Group (which contains the brands Renaissance Hotels, New World and Ramada International, etc.) to Marriott International in 1997. = Modern Pentahotels chain= New World Group relaunched the hotel chain as Pentahotels in 2007, targeted as a boutique lifestyle brand.

These aircraft are unique to NASA or are commercial aircraft. They are equipped with sensors that provide data for NASA's spaceborne missions. This program is part of the Earth Science Division and is what provides new aircraft systems that will further science and make better the use of data from satellites. There are four main goals to the program and those are satellite calibration and validation, support new sensor development, process studies, and develop the next-generation of scientists and engineers.  Satellite Calibration and Validation  Calibration is defined as the process of quantitatively defining the system response to known, controlled signal inputs. Validation is defined as the process of assessing by independent means the quality of the data provided. Higher level products can be successfully generated from satellite sensor data only if both calibration and validation are present. This allows Earth observation satellites the ability to get calibration measurements and allows them to get validation of their data retrieval algorithms. thumb  New Sensor Development  When using sensors to gain data, science platform aircraft use remote sensors. These can be broken into two groups; active and passive. = Active Sensors = Active sensors emit radiation in the direction of the object they are observing causing it to light up. To get a reading, it measures how much energy is reflected back at the sensor. Most active sensors are in the microwave part of the electromagnetic spectrum. This means that they are able to pass through almost any atmospheric condition. = Passive Sensors = Passive sensors work by detecting natural radiation from the object that is being observed. The most common source of radiation comes from reflected sunlight. Most passive sensors operate in the visible, infrared, and microwave sections of the electromagnetic spectrum.  Process Studies  Combining global satellite observations with high resolution spatial measurements allows for a better understanding of the complete Earth system.

Built around a Scottish Baronial-style mansion located in Auchencairn in the historical county of Kirkcudbrightshire in Dumfries and Galloway in Scotland. It overlooks the Solway Firth, with views to Cumbria and Hestan Island.  History  The castle was built by William Douglas Robinson-Douglas in the Scottish Baronial style in the 1880s, on the site of a small mansion dating from around 1769. Its status was changed to castle in 2014, approved with Scottish heritage and government services. The 1769 house had been started by Sir Robert Maxwell, 7th Baronet of Orchardton, who married a MacLellan of MacLellan's Castle and used the roof timbers and stone from nearby Orchardton Tower to build a new house in a better location near the sea. However the work bankrupted him and in 1786 the estate came under the ownership of James Douglas, a Liverpool merchant, and eventually passed down into the hands of William Douglas Robinson-Douglas, who started to rebuild the present house in 1878. In 1944 it became a military hospital for wounded officers and into a hotel after the war. The property was sold in 1951 but remained in use as an hotel until 1960. Between 1960 and 1981, it was a school and thereafter used for residential courses and conferences and housing for artists. Sold again in 2003 to Susanda DeVerehttps://www.telegraph.co.uk/property/buy/fiver-grand-scottish-castle- sold-raffle-wont-even-have-pay/, it was renovated over the next two years, including the installation of central heating and renewal of the electric wiring. The owners fell prey to a con artist while trying to sell the property in 2012. He is still at large in Scotland and is regularly featured in the newspapers. In late 2017, the owners offered the property for sale in a lottery with ¬£5 tickets https://winacastle.co.uk/. However, not enough tickets were sold and a cash prize was offered as an alternative. A complaint from someone who had not entered the competition meant that the advertising authority found against the competition. The owner appealed and also refused to accept the verdict. The Gambling Commission and the vast entrants of the competition supported her and no case was ever brought.https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-south-scotland-47953542  Description  There are around 48 rooms, including 17 bedrooms and three flats, a cinema, libraries and an outside sauna. There is a palm tree and many other rare tree and plant species in the garden and grounds, which stretch over 5 acres (2 hectares). The grounds are often visited by pheasants, rabbits, deer and peacocks.  Sources  *Paterson, George B L (1983). Orchardton House, Auchencairn, by Castle Douglas.

The lake sits at an elevation of and has an outflow via the short Pelican Lake Creek southwest through a notch in the coastal cliffs onto Double Point's Bolsa Beach. Pelican Lake is one of the five Coast Trail Lakes, along with Bass Lake, Crystal Lake, Ocean Lake and Wildcat Lake. Alamere Falls is about to the northwest. Geology As with the other nearby lakes in the southeast portion of the Point Reyes peninsula, Pelican Lake occupies a natural synclinal depression formed behind blocks of rock displaced by landslides within the past 10,000 years. The depressions forming Crystal, Pelican and Bass lakes appear to have been caused by the Double Point Slide, which covers an area of about . The rocks involved in the landslide are shale, chert and sandstone, some similar to Miocene rocks of the Monterey Formation and others to Pliocene rocks from the Central Coast Ranges. The process that caused these slides is ongoing, with several nearby slides caused by the 1906 San Francisco earthquake and others as recently as 1956. Prior to geological research in the 1960s, the area was considered to be sufficiently stable for the U.S. Army to construct an underground artillery control facility within the North Point headland directly west of Pelican Lake in 1944. These concrete structures were filled in by the National Park Service after it assumed control of the area, but could be exposed by future landslides. Ecology The lake is within the Southern Inverness Ridge region of the Point Reyes National Seashore, in an area of coastal scrub and grassland. In this coastal zone there are open stands of coyote brush (Baccharis pilularis), often with native grasses such as California oatgrass (Danthonia californica) and purple needlegrass (Nassella pulchra). The other dominant plants in this ecosystem are California sage brush (Artemisia californica), black sage (Salvia mellifera), sticky monkeyflower (Mimulus guttatus), poison oak (Toxicodendron diversilobum), California coffeeberry (Frangula californica) and tree lupine (Lupinus arboreus). Around Pelican Lake and the neighboring lakes are thick growths of willow (Salix sp.) In the lake margins can be found common tule (Schoenoplectus acutus), California bulrush (Schoenoplectus californicus), cat-tail (Typha latifolia) and sedges (Carex sp. including Carex senta). The lake has been stocked with warm-water game fish. On the slopes above the coastal lakes, the flora is characterized by stands of Douglas fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii). Pelican Lake is adjacent to the Double Point Area of Special Biological Significance, established in 1974 primarily to protect the large population of harbor seals (Phoca vitulina) that raise pups on the beach between April and June each year.

It specified initiatives and activities that will empower and enlist women and girls in efforts to achieve international peace and security. The U.S. NAP was formally revised in June 2016. On June 11, 2019, the White House released the U.S. Strategy on Women, Peace, and Security, which superseded the National Action Plan. The National Action Plan was developed by a broad inter-agency group led by White House National Security Council staff which also included representatives from civil society networks. The U.S. NAP contained five objectives outlining the U.S. government's commitments to promoting women's roles in global peace and security: National Integration and Institutionalization, Participation in Peace Processes and Decision-making, Protection from Violence, Conflict Prevention, and Access to Relief and Recovery. The plan also listed outcomes, actions, and responsible agencies for each objective. To enhance implementation and increase accountability, the plan called for the three main implementing agencies ‚Äì the Department of State, Department of Defense, and the U.S. Agency for International Development ‚Äì to submit their own fully funded, time-bound plans for implementation and evaluation, with a requirement for annual reporting.

Full implementation of women, peace, and security objectives put forward by the U.S. National Action Plan has been limited by external challenges ranging from lack of political will among international partners to societal discrimination against women in countries around the world. Internally, several factors have limited the ability of the U.S. government to fully integrate women, peace, and security objectives across all relevant work streams: resource and staffing limitations, insufficient training on gender-sensitive policies and programming, and uneven monitoring and evaluation are challenges to the plan. As Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton led the integration of women's issues as a core component of US foreign assistance and foreign policy. When she stepped down in 2012, some questioned whether the gains would be preserved. An opinion piece in POLITICO stated, \\"The challenges for women are still steep, but they are stepping up to take ownership of their futures like never before. It‚Äôs hard to imagine an effective U.S. engagement with the world that does not take this powerful global change into account.\\" In 2015, a Huffington Post piece on foreign policy in Afghanistan referred to the US National Action Plan, observing, \\"In the political world, there is often a long distance between words on a page and realities on the ground.\\" Also in 2015, a New York Times article took President Obama to task for excluding women from regions impacted by violent extremism from a White House Summit on Countering Violent Extremism, \\"instead of honoring the U.S. NAP‚Äôs commitment to include women leaders.\\"  Feminist Foreign Policy Pre-UNSCR 1325  Ambassador Swanee Hunt was ambassador to Austria in the Clinton administration. During that decade the region was embroiled in post- Soviet conflict and Ambassador Hunt acted as a third party peace-maker. Writing for PRISM, a publication that addresses complex operations in security Hunt discusses her role. During negotiations she arranged amongst Yugoslavian representatives she was embarrassed to realize she hadn't included a single woman in the peacemaking discussion, despite the many women contacts she had in the region. She laments that if she had included the perspective of women who were dealing with the Balkan conflict it would have illuminated the dangers of partition and problem with appointing old war criminals who had destroyed these women's communities as new leaders. Hunt writes, ‚ÄúWomen‚Äôs perspectives had been missing at Dayton where, many told me, they would have made clear the ‚Äòguaranteed‚Äô right of return would be meaningless without the apprehension of war criminals. How could anyone return to a village where the police chief or mayor, still in office, had overseen genocidal rapes and murders? Not ideology, but pragmatism was the common thread that ran through [women in Bosnia's] words to me. But they had been excluded‚Äîfirst, by their own nationalist power brokers, and then by ‚Äòthe internationals‚Äô who rewarded extremists with all available seats at the negotiating table. The result was not only a flawed right of return, but also a country bifurcated.‚Äù There was growing international sentiment in the 90s that the well being of people, not states, should be of utmost priority to the peace and security community. This idea of women in peace and security was entered into the pop cultural cannon with then first-lady Hillary Clinton's remarks at the 1995 World Women Conference in Beijing. She proclaimed that ‚ÄúHuman rights are women‚Äôs rights and women‚Äôs rights are human rights.‚Äù This speech signaled another turning point towards taking a gendered approach to foreign policy making. Clinton's speech highlights the rumblings about the ways wars uniquely impact women that were starting to be discussed in the early 90s. These rumblings eventually led to the passage of UNSCR 1325.  United Nations Security Council Resolution 1325  Approved by the UN in 2000, this resolution was ‚ÄúReaffirming the important role of women in the prevention and resolution of conflicts and in peace-building, and stressing the importance of their equal participation and full involvement in all efforts for the maintenance and promotion of peace and security, and the need to increase their role in decision-making with regard to conflict prevention and resolution.‚Äù The Landmark Resolution on Women, Peace, and Security urges all actors to ‚Äúincrease the participation of women and incorporate gender perspectives in all United Nations peace and security efforts and also calls on all parties to conflict to take special measures to protect women and girls from gender-based violence, particularly rape and other forms of sexual abuse, in situations of armed conflict.‚Äù UNSCR 1325 was the culmination of the last decade's shift in international thinking about women and security. The UN took a hard look at how women are uniquely positioned to make lasting peace but are also disproportionately harmed by violent conflict in ways that are rarely prosecuted, gender based violence and sexual violence being a few examples. In 2004 the UN urged all member states to create their own National Action Plans on Women, Peace, and Security. As of 2019 79 nations (40% of members) have adopted their own plans, with even fewer nations funding their plans as priorities in national budgets. More recently there have been many conversations on how women will be most affected by the consequences of climate change, and how policy makers might purposefully include women in creating strategies to combat climate change.  Executive Order 13595  Executive Order 13595 was signed by President Obama on December 11, 2011. The plan is broken down into the five objectives, essentially the reasons behind the creation and implementation of the Executive Order, and the four benchmarks, which allow policymakers to measure the success of each new policy with specific guidelines in mind. The Five Objectives: # National Integration and Institutionalization # Participation in Peace Processes and Decision- making # Protection from Violence # Conflict Prevention # Access to Relief and Recovery The first objective, national integration and institutionalization, emphasizes that gender inclusion is essential to U.S. efforts to promote peace and prevent conflicts. The second objective, participation in peace processes and decision-making, highlights the responsibility of the U.S. government to uphold equality for women in positions of leadership in peace processes and decision making positions. The third objective, protection from violence, discusses the U.S. role in preventing violence against women and holding perpetrators accountable to the fullest extent of the law. The fourth objective, conflict prevention, states that women's roles in conflict prevention position will be promoted as well as means to prevent conflict such as increasing women's access to education, health conditions, and economic opportunities. The fifth objective, access to relief and recovery, emphasizes that the U.S. government will respond to women and children in areas of conflict with accessible aid and assistance. The Four Benchmarks: # Gender Analysis # Inclusion # Resources # Accountability The four benchmarks are used to evaluate any actions carried out by the U.S. government through the U.S. National Action Plan on Women, Peace, and Security. The first benchmark, gender analysis, measures the impact of a policy on all genders. The second benchmark, inclusion, measures how well an action includes the consultation of relevant community members, specifically female community members and those directly impacted by a conflict or a policy. The third benchmark, resources, measures the budget of each project and if the project is an extension of an action already in place. The fourth benchmark, accountability, measures how accountable individuals, offices, and agencies are in ensuring an action is implemented successfully and that relevant deadlines are successfully met.  U.S. National Action Plan on Women, Peace, and Security  Created on December 1, 2011 and maintained as mandated by Executive Order 13595 this plan is the culmination of the past 20 years of thinking on women and foreign policy. The plan is equally about promoting women's involvement in peacemaking in order to have more stable peace and protecting women against gender based violence that is overlooked in times of war and inadequately prosecuted. The plan was deemed politically expedient in large part due to the growing proof that including women in peace processes makes the deals more effective. ‚ÄúEvidence shows that peace agreements are more likely to be secured‚Äîand are more likely to endure‚Äîwhen women are meaningfully involved.‚Äù That is the tactical portion of the argument for the NAP, women mean good peace deals and increased security. Women make up less than 5% of peace agreement signers, and 50% of peace agreements fail within five years, the thinking goes that if the first number includes more women the second number might include longer peace. The feminist argument policy for the plan lies with the idea that Hillary Clinton articulated in the 90s, that women's rights are human rights, and therefore women should be given the agency to determine peace in their countries where they make up half the population. ‚ÄúTragically, war remains a regular and recurring feature of the human experience In many instances, conflicts have recurred or been prolonged in significant part because women‚Äîthose who suffered the worst of the violence and bore the burden of reconstruction‚Äîwere excluded from the negotiating table and the benefits of peace‚Äù War also disproportionately affects women and that gender based violence should be included in discourse around war crimes. This plan was implemented during Hillary Clinton's tenure as Secretary of State, and the plan faced backlash as being simply a women's issue or a pet project of Secretary Clinton because she was a woman, a largely inconsequential piece of U.S. foreign policy. In response Secretary Clinton offered these remarks when speaking at a release event shortly after the plan was announced, ‚ÄúNow, why is all this happening, all these countries, the United Nations, NATO, and certainly us? Well, the reason is because we are convinced. We have enough anecdotal evidence and research that demonstrates women in peacekeeping is both the right thing to do and the smart thing, as well. It‚Äôs right, because, after all, women are affected disproportionately by conflict; they deserve to participate in the decisions that shape their own lives. And it‚Äôs the smart thing because we have seen again and again that women participating in these processes builds more durable peace.‚Äù  Larger Implications for Feminist Foreign Policy  The U.S. National Action Plan on Women, Peace, and Security has led to the United States adopting a way of looking at the peace process through a gender lens. The field of feminist foreign policy has historically been left out of the peace process. But now with the U.S. National Action Plan on Women, Peace, and Security there is precedent for inclusion of those affected by peace discussions to have a place in this crucial process, specifically women. Since the implementation of the U.S. National Action Plan on Women, Peace, and Security there have been a few key global moments that show the larger impact on bringing feminist foreign policy as more mainstream in the international community.

Since the implementation of the U.S. National Action Plan on Women, Peace, and Security through Executive Order 13595 by President Barack Obama there have been academic institutions establishing specific programs focused on advancing the topic of women, peace, and security. A few key examples of programs creation at academic institutions in the United States and internationally include: * The Program on Women, Peace, and Security (WPS) at Texas A&M; University established in November 2015 * The Georgetown Institute for Women, Peace, and Security established in 2010 * Centre for Women, Peace and Security at The London School of Economics and Political Science established in 2015 * Women, Peace, and Security at Columbia University Along with specific academic programs, academic institutions have also created spaces to increase the discussion around women, peace, and security through course offerings, fellowship programs, and lecture series. In academic literature there has been an increase in the discussion of how to battle violence and advocate for lasting peace through the Women, Peace, and Security agenda. A few key examples of academics specifically addressing the impact of Women, Peace, and Security on foreign policy are Laura Shepherd and Megan MacKenzie, who both are currently working at the University of Sydney in Sydney, Australia.  Women, Peace, and Security Act  One of the early pieces of legislation enacted by the Trump administration was the Women, Peace, and Security Act in 2017. While the law does not formally cite UNSCR 1325 or Executive Order 13595, it marks a formal step to codify in U.S. law the importance of women to the nation and globe's peace and security. The law was the first comprehensive legislation in the world recognizing women as critical to peacemaking and security maintenance and echoed many of themes captured within UN Security Council resolutions. Its preamble states ‚ÄúThis bill expresses the sense of Congress that: the United States should be a global leader in promoting the participation of women in conflict prevention, management, and resolution and post-conflict relief and recovery efforts; the political participation and leadership of women in fragile environments, particularly during democratic transitions, is critical to sustaining democratic institutions; and the participation of women in conflict prevention and conflict resolution helps promote more inclusive and democratic societies and is critical to country and regional stability.‚Äù The Women, Peace, and Security Act required a national strategy as well as stand-alone implementation plans for each participating Department, including the Department of Defense, the Department of Homeland Security, the Department of State, and the U.S. Agency for International Development. The U.S. Strategy on Women, Peace, and Security was released on June 11, 2019 and formally supplanted the U.S. National Action Plan. In a statement marking the release, the White House recognized that ‚Äùsocieties that empower women economically and politically are far more stable and peaceful.‚Äú A corresponding government- wide metrics framework was released in October 2019, offering a singular framework for measuring progress.

He was the vice chancellor of Vasantrao Naik Marathwada Agricultural University and chaired the Agricultural Scientists Recruitment Board of the Indian Council of Agricultural Research. He was a recipient of several national honors including Rafi Ahmed Kidwai Award and the VASVIK Industrial Research Award. The Council of Scientific and Industrial Research, the apex agency of the Government of India for scientific research, awarded him the Shanti Swarup Bhatnagar Prize for Science and Technology, one of the highest Indian science awards, in 1966, for his contributions to biological sciences.  Biography  N. G. Prasada Rao was born on 5 September 1927 in Korisapadu, Madras Presidency, British India and he graduated in agriculture (BSc) with second rank from Agricultural College, Bapatla, then affiliated to Andhra University (presently affiliated to Acharya N. G. Ranga Agricultural University). After completing his master's degree at the Indian Agricultural Research Institute with a first rank, he secured his PhD from Bihar University in 1958 after which Chandrasekhar Azad University of Agriculture and Technology awarded him the degree of Doctor of Science (DSc). His career started as a lecturer at Osmania University but later joined the Indian Agricultural Research Institute as a plant breeder for sorghum where he served for a number of years as a coordinator of All India Sorghum Improvement Project, head of IARI Hyderabad station and as a Professor of Eminence. During his tenure at IARI, he also served as a faculty member at the College of Agriculture, Hyderabad and at IARI campus in New Delhi. Later he also worked as a Sorghum breeder with International Crops Research Institute for the Semi- Arid Tropics in West Africa before serving as the vice chancellor of Vasantrao Naik Marathwada Agricultural University, and was associated with the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations as a consultant. Rao was known to have done extensive researches in breeding hybrid varieties of sorghum and his efforts were reported to have assisted in the development of three new varieties, CSH-1, CSH-2 and CSH-9, which returned high yield levels. It also helped the kharif cultivation in the arid areas of India and West Africa, in making sorghum a popular crop, comparable to rice and wheat and in the development of hybrid seed industry in India. He proposed new cropping techniques and his efforts also contributed to the development of other crops such as cotton, red gram and castor. His researches have been documented in over 200 papers published by him in peer reviewed journals. He was associated with Indian Society of Genetics and Plant Breeding and the Society for Millets Improvement and presided over both the societies. Rao took ill in 2016 and after a short period of illness, died on 27 July 2016, at the age of 88, in Hyderabad.  Awards and honors  The Indian National Science Academy elected Rao as their fellow in 1979, followed by the National Academy of Sciences, India, in 1988. He was also an elected fellow of the National Academy of Agricultural Sciences and the Andhra Pradesh Academy of Sciences. He received the Shanti Swarup Bhatnagar Prize, one of the highest Indian science awards, from the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research in 1966, the same year as he received the C. Subramaniam Gold Medal. He received the Rafi Ahmed Kidwai Award of the Indian Council of Agricultural Research in 1974 and the VASVIK Industrial Research Award in 1979. The Government of Andhra Pradesh honored him with two awards, the Atma Gaurav Award in 2003, and the Distinguished Agricultural Scientist Award in 2008. Acharya N.G.

She holds a PhD from Oxford University (St Antony's College, 1976‚Äì1981); a BA, magna cum laude, from Harvard University (1976); studied in Moscow and Leningrad; and was one of the first Westerners to conduct research in Central Asia for a year, at Tashkent State University, Uzbekistan (1978/79), where she documented deep institutional corruption and its political and economic impacts. She has traveled to this region many times since. Lubin‚Äôs interest in the former Soviet Union began during her college years at Harvard University, where she created an undergraduate \\"Special Concentration\\" in Soviet Studies and became particularly interested in the southern regions of the USSR. She spent one semester, 1974, studying in Leningrad (now Saint Petersburg), and published on population policies in the USSR and the rapid growth of the Central Asian and other minority populations in the Soviet Union's southern tier. After earning her bachelor's degree, Lubin worked at Citizen Exchange Corps in NY, putting together and then leading the first group of American skiers and ski writers to ski at Cheget, in the Caucasus mountains near Mount Elbrus, the highest mountain on the European continent. She then spent one year conducting research in Uzbekistan (1978‚Äì79) before completing her doctorate at Oxford in 1982. Her research focused on corruption and the informal political and economic system in Central Asia, and her resulting book was reviewed favorably in the New York Times Book Review and elsewhere. After earning her doctorate, Lubin worked on Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C. as Soviet analyst and Project Director at the Congressional Office of Technology Assessment before joining the faculty of Carnegie Mellon University in the departments of Engineering and Public Policy, and of Social and Applied History. Throughout the 1980s she also consulted widely for a range of foundations, international organizations and US governmental agencies on, and in, Central Asia, the Caucasus, and Russia, and was often quoted in the press. The collapse of the USSR in 1991 led Lubin to found JNA Associates Inc., a research and consulting firm that focuses on Central Asia and the Caucasus region. She has consulted for over 80 private foundations, international donors/ financial institutions, US government agencies and contractors, the media, and other private industry ranging from Fortune 100 corporations to small non-profits. Her cross-sectoral work, largely focused on corruption and navigating these informal economic and political systems, includes designing, negotiating, implementing and evaluating projects and joint ventures on the ground; conducting political risk assessments, survey research and other analyses; consulting on television and film productions; and advising corporations, donors, and legal counsel in the US, Europe and Japan. The latter includes work as an expert witness/ expert consultant for civil and criminal cases, including Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) and other matters. Her research includes her work as a fellow at the US Institute of Peace, Woodrow Wilson Center, and elsewhere; Director/ Principal Author of a Council on Foreign Relations project chaired by Senator Sam Nunn; consultant for ABC News & PBS documentaries; and author of books, articles and op-eds for publications as varied as the New York Times, GEO magazine, Readers Digest, Newsday, and elsewhere. She has also provided her expertise on Russian and Central Asian affairs on camera and as a consultant for NPR, CNN, ABC News, and other media outlets.

Other sources include sukuk (also called \\"Islamic bonds\\") and direct equity investment (such as purchase of common shares of stock) as types of PLS.Khan, Islamic Banking in Pakistan, 2015: p.91 The profits and losses shared in PLS are those of a business enterprise or person which/who has obtained capital from the Islamic bank/financial institution (the terms \\"debt\\", \\"borrow\\", \\"loan\\" and \\"lender\\" are not used). As financing is repaid, the provider of capital collects some agreed upon percentage of the profits (or deducts if there are losses) along with the principal of the financing. Unlike a conventional bank, there is no fixed rate of interest collected along with the principal of the loan. Also unlike conventional banking, the PLS bank acts as a capital partner (in the mudarabah form of PLS) serving as an intermediary between the depositor on one side and the entrepreneur/borrower on the other. The intention is to promote \\"the concept of participation in a transaction backed by real assets, utilizing the funds at risk on a profit-and-loss-sharing basis\\". Profit-and-loss-sharing is one of \\"two basic categories\\" of Islamic financing, the other being \\"debt-based contracts\\" (or \\"debt-like instruments\\") such as murabaha, istisna'a, salam and leasing, which involve the \\"purchase and hire of goods or assets and services on a fixed-return basis\\". While early promoters of Islamic banking (such as Mohammad Najatuallah Siddiqui) hoped PLS would be the primary mode of Islamic finance, use of fixed return financing now far exceeds that of PLS in the Islamic financing industry. Background One of the pioneers of Islamic banking, Mohammad Najatuallah Siddiqui, suggested a two-tier model as the basis of a riba-free banking, with mudarabah being the primary mode, supplemented by a number of fixed-return models mark-up (murabaha), leasing (ijara), cash advances for the purchase of agricultural produce (salam) and cash advances for the manufacture of assets (istisna'), etc. In practice, the fixed-return models in particular murabaha model have become the bank's favourites,Khan, What Is Wrong with Islamic Economics?, 2013: p.275 as long- term financing with profit-and-loss-sharing mechanisms has turned out to be more risky and costly than the long term or medium-term lending of the conventional banks. =Mudarabah= Jamaldeen, Islamic Finance For Dummies, 2012:149 Mudarabah or \\"Sharing the profit and loss with venture capital\\",Jamaldeen, Islamic Finance For Dummies, 2012:147 is a partnership or trust financing contract (similar to western equivalent of General and Limited Partnership) where one partner (rabb-ul-mal or \\"silent partner\\"/financier), gives money to another (mudarib or \\"working partner\\") for investing in a commercial enterprise. The rabb-ul-mal party provides 100 percent of the capital and the mudarib party provides its specialized knowledge to invest the capital and manage the investment project. Profits generated are shared between the parties according to a pre-agreed ratio. If there is a loss, rabb- ul-mal will lose his capital, and the mudarib party will lose the time and effort invested in the project. The profit is usually shared 50%-50% or 60%-40% for rabb ul mal-mudarib. Further, Mudaraba is venture capital funding of an entrepreneur who provides labor while financing is provided by the bank so that both profit and risk are shared. Such participatory arrangements between capital and labor reflect the Islamic view that the borrower must not bear all the risk/cost of a failure, resulting in a balanced distribution of income and not allowing the lender to monopolize the economy. Muslims believe that the Islamic prophet Muhammad's wife Khadija used a Mudaraba contract with Muhammad in Muhammad's trading expeditions in northern Arabia Khadija providing the capital and Muhammad providing the labour/entrepreneurship. Mudaraba contracts are used in inter-bank lending. The borrowing and lending banks negotiate the PLS ratio and contracts may be as short as overnight and as long as one year. Mudarabah contracts may be restricted or unrestricted. *In an al-mudarabah al-muqayyadah (restricted mudarabah), the rabb-ul-mal may specify a particular business for the mudarib, in which case he shall invest the money in that particular business only.Usmani, Introduction to Islamic Finance, 1998: p.32 For the account holder, a restricted mudarabah may authorize the IIFS (institutions offering Islamic financial services) to invest their funds based on mudarabah or agency contracts with certain restrictions as to where, how, and for what purpose these are to be invested. For the bank customer they would be held in \\"Investment Funds\\" rather than \\"Investment Accounts\\". *In a al-mudarabah al-mutlaqah (unrestricted mudarabah), the rabb-ul-mal allows the mudarib to undertake whatever business he wishes and so authorizes him to invest the money in any business he deems fit. For the account holder funds are invested without any restrictions based on mudarabah or wakalah (agency) contracts, and the institution may commingle the investors funds with their own funds and invest them in a pooled portfolio, going to \\"Investment Accounts\\" rather than \\"Investment Funds\\". They may also be first tier ortwo tier. * Most mudarabah contracts are first tier or simple contracts where the depositor/customer deals with the bank and not with entrepreneur using the invested funds. * In two-tier mudarabah the bank serves as an intermediary between the depositor and the entrepreneur being provided financing. Two tier is used when the bank does not have the capacity to serve as the investor or expertise to serve as the fund manager.Jamaldeen, Islamic Finance For Dummies, 2012:149-50 A variation of two-tier mudarabah that has caused some complaint is one that replaces profit and loss sharing between depositor and bank with profit sharing the losses being all the problem of the depositors. Instead of both the bank and its depositors being the owners of the capital (rabb al-mal), and the entrepreneur the mudarib, the bank and the entrepreneur are now both mudarib, and if there are any losses after meeting the overhead and operational expenses, they are passed on to depositors. One critic (Ibrahim Warde) has dubbed this \`Islamic moral hazard\` in which the banks are able \`to privatise the profits and socialize the losses\`.Warde, Islamic finance in the global economy, 2000: p.164Khan, What Is Wrong with Islamic Economics?, 2013: p.321 Another critic (M.A. Khan), has questioned the mudarabah's underlying rationale of fairness to the mudarib. Rather than fixed interest lending being unfair to the entrepreneur/borrower, Khan asks if it isn't unfair to the rabb al-mal (provider of finance) to \\"get a return only if the results of investment are profitable\\", since by providing funds they have done their part to make the investment possible, while the actions of entrepreneur/borrower their inspiration, competence, diligence, probity, etc. have much more power over whether and by how much the investment is profitable or a failure.Khan, What Is Wrong with Islamic Economics?, 2013: p.232-3 =Musharakah= Structure of simple musharaka contractJamaldeen, Islamic Finance For Dummies, 2012:152 Musharakah is a joint enterprise in which all the partners share the profit or loss of the joint venture. The two (or more) parties that contribute capital to a business divide the net profit and loss on a pro rata basis. Some scholarly definitions of it include: ‚ÄúAgreement for association on the condition that the capital and its benefit be common between two or more persons‚Äù, (Mecelle)C. R. Tyser (1329 AH) The Mejelle, Majallah Al-Ahkam Al-Adiyah. A Complete Code or Islamic Civil Law, The Book House, Pakistan. (n.d) ‚ÄúAn agreement between two or more persons to carry out a particular business with the view of sharing profits by joint investment‚Äù (Ibn Arfa),Ibn Arfa (1984) Mukhtesan of Sidi Khalil, as cited in Abdur Rahman I., Doi, Shariah: The Islamic Law, A.S. Noordeen, Kuala Lumpur. ‚ÄúA contract between two persons who launch a business of financial enterprise to make profit‚Äù (Muhammad Akram Khan).Akram Khan, M. (1990) Glossary of Islamic Economic, MANSELL, London, p. 100. Musharakah is often used in investment projects, letters of credit, and the purchase or real estate or property. In the case of real estate or property, the bank assesses an imputed rent and will share it as agreed in advance. All providers of capital are entitled to participate in management, but not necessarily required to do so. The profit is distributed among the partners in pre-agreed ratios, while the loss is borne by each partner strictly in proportion to respective capital contributions. This concept is distinct from fixed-income investing (i.e. issuance of loans). Musharaka is used in business transactions and often to finance a major purchase. Islamic banks lend their money to companies by issuing floating rate interest loans, where the floating rate is pegged to the company's rate of return and serves as the bank's profit on the loan. Once the principal amount of the loan is repaid, the contract is concluded *Shirka al'Inan is a Musharaka partnership where the partners are only the agent but do not serve as guarantors of the other partner. **Different shareholders have different rights and are entitled to different profit shares. **Al'Inan is limited a specific undertaking and is more common than Al Mufawada. *Mufawada is an \\"unlimited, unrestricted, and equal partnership\\". **All participants rank equally in every respect (initial contributions, privileges, and final profits) **Partners are both agents and guarantors of other partners. Other sources distinguish between Shirkat al Aqd (contractual partnership) and Shirkat al Milk (co-ownership), although they disagree over whether they are forms of \\"diminishing musharaka\\" or not. Permanent Musharaka Investor/partners receive a share of profit on a pro-rata basis. *The period of contract is not specified and the partnership continues for as long as the parties concerned agree for it to continue. *A suitable structure for financing long term projects needing long term financing. Diminishing partnership Musharaka can be either a \\"consecutive partnership\\" or \\"declining balance partnership\\" (otherwise known as a \\"diminishing partnership\\" or \\"diminishing musharaka\\"). *In a \\"consecutive partnership\\" the partners keep the same level of share in the partnership until the end of the joint venture, unless they withdraw or transfer their shares all together. It's used when a bank invests in \\"a project, a joint venture, or business activity\\",Jamaldeen, Islamic Finance For Dummies, 2012:152-3 but usually in home financing, where the shares of the home are transferred to the customer buying the home. *In a \\"diminishing partnership\\" (Musharaka al-Mutanaqisa, also \\"Diminishing Musharaka\\") one partner's share diminishes as the other's gradually acquires it until that partner owns the entire share. This mechanism is used to finance a bank customer's purchase, usually (or often) of real estate where the share diminishing is that of the bank, and the partner acquiring 100% is the customer. The partnership starts with a purchase, the customer \\"starts renting or using the asset and shares profit with (or pays monthly rent to) its partner (the bank) according to an agreed ratio.\\" If default occurs, both the bank and the borrower receive a proportion of the proceeds from the sale of the property based on each party's current equity. Banks using this partnership (as of 2012) including the American Finance House, and Dubai Islamic Bank.Jamaldeen, Islamic Finance For Dummies, 2012:153 Diminishing Partnership is particularly popular way of structuring an Islamic mortgage for financing homes/real estate and resembles a residential mortgage. The Islamic financier buys the house on behalf of the other \\"partner\\", the ultimate buyer who then pays the financier monthly installments combining the amounts for # rent (or lease payments) and # buyout payment until payment is complete. Thus, a diminishing Musharaka partnership actually consists of a musharakah partnership contract and two other Islamic contracts usually ijarah (leasing by the bank of its share of the asset to the customer) and bay‚Äô (gradual sales of the bank's share to the customer). In theory, a diminishing Musharaka for home purchase differs from a conventional mortgage in that it charges not interest on a loan, but \`rent\` (or lease payment) based on comparable homes in the area. But as one critic (M.A. El-Gamal) complained, some > \\"ostensibly Islamic Banks do not even make a pretense of attempting to > disguise the role of market interest rates in a \`diminishing musharaka\`, and > ... the \`rental\` rate is directly derived from conventional interest rates > and not from any imputed \`fair market rent\`\\". El-Gamal gives as an example the Islamic Bank of Britain's explanation that its 'rental rates' are benchmarked to commercial interest rate \\"such as Libor (London Interbank Offered [interest] Rate) plus a further profit margin\\", rather than being derived from the prevailing rental levels of equivalent units in the neighborhood.Khan, Islamic Banking in Pakistan, 2015: p.103 The Meezan Bank of Pakistan is careful to use the term \\"profit rate\\" but it is based on KIBOR (Karachi Interbank Offered [interest] Rate).Khan, Islamic Banking in Pakistan, 2015: p.104 According to Takao Moriguchi, musharakah mutanaqisa is fairly common in Malaysia, but questions about its shariah compliance mean it is \\"not so prevailing in Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries such as Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Bahrain, and Oman\\". =Differences= According to Mufti Taqi Usmani, a mudarabah arrangement differs from the musharakah in several ways: *In mudarabah: **investment is the sole responsibility of rabb-ul-maal, not all partners. **the rabb-ul-maal has no right to participate in the management which is carried out by the mudarib only. **the loss, if any, is suffered by the rabb-ul-mal only, because the mudarib does not invest anything. His loss is restricted to the fact that his labor has gone in vain and his work has not brought any fruit to him, unless losses are due to the mudarib's misconduct, negligence, or breach of the terms and conditions of the contract. **all the goods purchased by the mudarib are solely owned by the rabb-ul-maal, and the mudarib can earn his share in the profit only in case he sells the goods profitably. Therefore, he is not entitled to claim his share in the assets themselves, even if their value has increased. *In musharakah: **unlike mudarabah, investment comes from all the partners **unlike mudarabah, all the partners can participate in the management of the business and can work for it. **all the partners share the loss to the extent of the ratio of their investment **as soon as the partners mix up their capital in a joint pool, all the assets of the musharakah become jointly owned by all of them according to the proportion of their respective investment. Therefore, each one of them can benefit from the appreciation in the value of the assets, even if profit has not accrued through sales. *Liability **In musharakah all the partners share the financial loss to the extent of the ratio of their investment while in mudarabah the loss, if any, is suffered by the rabb-ul-mal only, because the mudarib does not invest any money. This is considered just because his/her/their time and effort has been in vain and yielded no profit. This principle is subject to a condition that the mudarib has worked with the due diligence required for whatever the business involved is. If there has been negligence or dishonesty, the mudarib is liable for whatever loss was caused by their negligence or misconduct.Usmani, Introduction to Islamic Finance, 1998: p.31 **The liability of the partners in musharakah is normally unlimited, so that if the liabilities of the business exceed its assets and the business goes in liquidation, all the exceeding liabilities shall be borne pro rata by all the partners. However, if all the partners have agreed that no partner shall incur any debt during the course of business, then whichever partner has incurred a debt on the business in violation of the aforesaid condition shall be liable for that debt. In the case of mudarabah the liability of rabb-ul-maal is limited to his investment, unless he has permitted the mudarib to incur debts on his behalf. *Appreciation of assets **In musharakah, as soon as the partners add their capital together in a joint pool, these assets become jointly owned by all of them according to the proportion of their respective investment. Therefore, each one of them can benefit from the appreciation in the value of the assets, even if profit has not accrued through sales. **The case of mudarabah is different. Here all the goods purchased by the mudarib are solely owned by the rabb-ul-maal, and the mudarib can earn his share in the profit only in case he sells the goods profitably. Therefore, he is not entitled to claim his share in the assets themselves, even if their value has increased.Usmani, Introduction to Islamic Finance, 1998: pp.17-36Musharakah & Mudarabah By Mufti Taqi Usmani  Limited Liability central-mosque.com Promises and challenges Profit and loss sharing has been called \\"the main justification\\" for, or even \\"the very purpose\\" of the Islamic finance and banking movement\\" and the \\"basic and foremost characteristic of Islamic financing\\".Usmani, Historic Judgment on Interest, 1999: para 204 One proponent, Taqi Usmani, envisioned it transforming economies by *rewarding \\"honest, honorable and forthright behaviour\\"; *protecting savers by eliminating the possibility of collapse for individual banks and for banking systems; *replacing the \\"stresses\\" of business and economic cycles with a \\"steady flow of money into investments\\"; *ensuring \\"stable money\\" which would encourage \\"people to take a longer view\\" in looking at return on investment; *enabling \\"nations and individuals\\" to \\"regain their dignity\\" as they become free of the \\"enslavement of debt\\".Usmani, Historic Judgment on Interest, 1999: para 205 Usmani notes that some non-Muslim economists have supported development of equity markets in \\"areas of finance currently served by debt\\"Usmani, Historic Judgment on Interest, 1999: para 204, 205 (though they do not support banning interest on loans). =Lack of use= While it was originally envisioned (at least in mudarabah form), as \\"the basis of a riba-free banking\\", with fixed-return financial models only filling in as supplements, it is those fixed-return products whose assets-under-management now far exceed those in profit-loss- sharing modes. One study from 2000-2006 (by Khan M. Mansoor and M. Ishaq Bhatti) found PLS financing in the \\"leading Islamic banks\\" had declined to only 6.34% of total financing, down from 17.34% in 1994-6. \\"Debt-based contracts\\" or \\"debt-like instruments\\" (murabaha, ijara, salam and istisna) were far more popular in the sample.Khan M. Mansoor and M. Ishaq Bhatti. 2008. Developments in Islamic banking: The case of Pakistan . Houndsmills, Basingstoke: Palgrave Macmillan, p.49Khan, What Is Wrong with Islamic Economics?, 2013: p.322-3 Another source (Suliman Hamdan Albalawi, publishing in 2006) found that PLS techniques were no longer \\"a core principle of Islamic banking\\" in Saudi Arabia and Egypt. In Malaysia, another study found the share of musharaka financing declined from 1.4% in 2000 to 0.2% in 2006.Z.

IIUM Journal of Economics and Management 15 (2) 173 In his book, An Introduction to Islamic Finance, Usmani bemoans the fact that there are no \\"visible efforts\\" to reverse this direction of Islamic banking, > The fact, however, remains that the Islamic banks should have advanced > towards musharakah in gradual phases ....

Khattab has questioned the basis in Islamic law for the two-tier mudarabah system, saying there are no instances where the mudharib passed funds onto another mudharib. =Explanations for lack= Critics have in turn criticized PLS advocates for remaining \\"oblivious to the fact\\" that the reason PLS has not been widely adopted \\"lies in its inefficiency\\" (Muhammad Akram Khan), and their \\"consequence-insensitive\\" way of thinking, assuming that \\"ample supply\\" of PLS \\"instruments will create their own demand\\" (Nawab Haider Naqvi), consumer disinterest notwithstanding.Naqvi, S.N.H. 2000. Islamic banking: An evaluation. IIUM Journal of Economics and Management 8 (1) 41-70 Faleel Jamaldeen describes the decline in the use of PLS as a natural growing process, where profit and loss sharing was replaced by other contracts because PLS modes \\"were no longer sufficient to meet industry demands for project financing, home financing, liquidity management and other products\\".Jamaldeen, Islamic Finance For Dummies, 2012:265 ;Moral Hazard On the liability side, Feisal Khan argues there is a \\"long established consensus\\" that debt finance is superior to equity investment (PLS being equity investment) because of the \\"information asymmetry\\" between the financier/investor and borrower/entrepreneur the financier/investor needing to accurately determine the credit-worthiness of the borrower/entrepreneur seeking credit/investment, (the borrower/entrepreneur having no such burden). Determining credit-worthiness is both time-consuming and expensive, and debt contracts with substantial collateral minimize its risk of not having information or enough of it.Khan, Islamic Banking in Pakistan, 2015, p.98-9 In the words of Al-Azhar rector Muhammad Sayyid Tantawy, \\"Silent partnerships [mudarabah] follow the conditions stipulated by the partners. We now live in a time of great dishonesty, and if we do not specify a fixed profit for the investor, his partner will devour his wealth.\\"El-Gamal, Islamic Finance, 2006: p.143 The bank's client has a strong incentive to report less profit to the bank than it has actually earned, as it will lose a fraction of that to the bank. As the client knows more about its business, its accounting, its flow of income, etc., than the bank, the business has an informational advantage over the bank determining levels of profit. (For example, one way a bank can under report its earnings is by depreciating assets at a higher level than actual wear and tear.)Khan, What Is Wrong with Islamic Economics?, 2013: p.278, 18.3 Banks can attempt to compensate with monitoring, spot-checks, reviewing important decisions of the partner business, but this requires \\"additional staff and technical resources\\" that competing conventional banks are not burdened with. Higher levels of corruption and a larger unofficial/underground economy where revenues are not reported, indicate poorer and harder-to-find credit information for financiers/investors. There are several indicators this is a problem in Muslim majority countries (such as the presence of most Muslim- majority countries in the lower half of the Transparency International Corruption Perceptions Index and the \\"widespread tax evasion in both the formal and informal sectors\\" of Middle East and North Africa, according to A.R. Jalali-Naini.) But even in the more developed United States, the market for venture capital (where the financier take a direct equity stake in ventures they are financing, like PLS) varies from around $30 billion (2011‚Äì12) to $60 billion (2004) compared to \\"several trillion dollar\\" market for corporate financing.Khan, Islamic Banking in Pakistan, 2015, p.100 Taqi Usmani states that the problems of PLS would be eliminating by banning interest and requiring all banks to be run on a \\"pure Islamic pattern with careful support from the Central Bank and government.\\" The danger of dishonesty by borrowers/clients would be solved by #requiring every company/corporation to use a credit rating; #implementing a \\"well designed\\" system of auditing.Usmani, Historic Judgment on Interest, 1999: para 216 ;Other explanations Other explanations have been offered (and rebutted) as to why use of PLS instruments has declined to almost negligible proportions: *Most Islamic bankers started their careers at conventional banks so they suffer from a \\"hangover\\", still thinking of banks \\"as liquidity/credit providers rather than investment vehicles\\".Khan, Islamic Banking in Pakistan, 2015: p101 **But by 2017 Islamic banking had been in existence for over four decades and \\"many if not most\\" Islamic bankers had \\"served their entire careers\\" in Islamic financial institutions. *In some countries, interest is accepted as a business expenditure and given tax exemption, but profit is taxed as income. The clients of the business who obtain funds on a PLS basis must bear a financial burden, in terms of higher taxes, that they would not if they obtained the funds on an interest or fixed debt contract basis; **However as of 2015, this is no longer the case in \\"most jurisdictions\\", according to Faisal Khan. In the UK, for example, whose the government has hoped to make an IBF hub, \\"double taxation of Islamic mortgages for both individuals and corporations\\" has been removed, and there is \\"favorable tax treatment of Islamic debt issuance\\". *Islamic products have to be approved by banking regulators who deal with the conventional financial world and so must be identical in function to conventional financial products.El-Gamal, Islamic Finance, 2006: p.20-1 **But banks in countries whose governments favor Islamic banking over conventional i.e. Malaysia, Pakistan, Sudan, Iran show no more inclination towards Profit and Loss sharing than those in other countries. Nor have regulations of financial institutions in these countries diverged in form from those of other \\"conventional\\" countries : > When it comes to the manner in which Islamic securities are offered, the > process and rules for such offerings, even in those jurisdictions with > special licensing regimes, are, in effect, the same. (For example, the rules > governing the listings of Islamic bonds issued by the Securities and > Commodities Authority of the United Arab Emirates are almost identical to > the rules governing the listing of conventional bonds save for the use of > [sic] word 'profit' instead of 'interest'. *According to economist Tarik M. Yousef, long-term financing with profit-and-loss-sharing mechanisms is \\"far riskier and costlier\\" than the long term or medium-term lending of the conventional banks. *Islamic financial institutions seek to avoid the \\"risk of exposure to indeterminate loss\\". *In conventional banking, the banks are able to put all their assets to use and optimize their earnings by borrowing and investing for any length of time including short periods such as a day or so. The rate of interest can be calculated for any period of time. However, the length of time it takes to determine a profit or loss may not be nearly as flexible, and banks may not be able to use PLS for short term investment.Khan, What Is Wrong with Islamic Economics?, 2013: p.326-7 *On the other side of the ledger, their customers/borrowers/clients do not like to give away any \\"sovereignty in decision making\\" by taking the bank as a partner which generally means opening their books to the bank and the possibility of bank intervention in day-to-day business matters. *Because customers/borrowers/clients can share losses with banks in a PLS financing, they (the clients) have less financial incentive to avoid losses of risky projects and inefficiency than they would with conventional or debt-based lending.Khan, What Is Wrong with Islamic Economics?, 2013: p.276, 277 18.1, 18.2 *Competing fixed-return models, in particular the murabaha model, provides \\"results most similar to the interest-based finance models\\" depositors and borrowers are familiar with. *Regarding the rate of profit and loss sharing i.e. the \\"agreed upon percentage of the profits (or deduction of losses)\\" the Islamic bank takes from the client there is no market to set it or government regulation of it. This leaves open the possibility the bank could exploit the client with excessive rates.Khan, What Is Wrong with Islamic Economics?, 2013: p.278-9 *PLS is also not suitable or feasible for non-profit projects that need working capital, (in fields like education and health care), since they earn no profit to share. *The property rights in most Muslim countries have not been properly defined. This makes the practice of profit-loss sharing difficult;Iqbal, Munawar and Philip Molyneux. 2005. Thirty years of Islamic banking: History, performance and prospects. New York: Palgrave Macmillan. p.136Khan, What Is Wrong with Islamic Economics?, 2013: p.324 *Islamic banks must compete with conventional banks which are firmly established and have centuries of experience. Islamic banks that are still developing their policies and practices, and feel restrained in taking unforeseen risks; *Secondary markets for Islamic financial products based on PLS are smaller; *One of the forms of PLS, mudaraba, provides only limited control rights to shareholders of the bank, and thus denies shareholders a consistent and complementary control system.Dar, Humayon A. and J.R. Presley (2000-01. Lack of profit loss sharing in Islamic banking: Management and control imbalance., Economics research paper 024. Leicester: Loughborough University. 5-6) *The difficulty in expanding a business financed through mudaraba because of limited opportunities to reinvest retained earnings and/or raise additional funds. *The difficulty for the customer/borrower/client/entrepreneur to become the sole owner of a project financed through PLS, except through diminishing musharaka, which may take a long time. *Also the structure of Islamic bank deposits is not sufficiently long-term, and so investors shy away from getting involved in long-term projects. *The sharia calls for helping the poor and vulnerable groups such as orphans, widows, pensioners. Insofar as these groups have any capital, they will seek to preserve it and generate sources of steady, reliable income. While conventional interest-bearing savings accounts provide such conservative investments, PLS do not.Khan, What Is Wrong with Islamic Economics?, 2013: p.282, 18.6.6 Industry =Sudan= Between 1998 and 2002 musharkaka made up 29.8% of financing in Sudan and mudaraba 4.6%, thanks in at least part to pressure from the Islamic government. Critics complain that the banking industry in that country was not following the spirit of Islamic banking spirit as investment was directed in the banks' \\"major shareholder and the members of the board(s) of directors\\".Khan, Islamic Banking in Pakistan, 2015: p.94 =Kuwait= In Kuwait the Kuwait Finance House is the second largest bank and was exempt from some banking regulations such that it could invest in property and rims outright and participate directly in musharaka financing of corporations and \\"generally act more like a holding company than a bank\\". Nonetheless as of 2010 78.4% of its assets were in murabahah, ijara and other non-PLS sources. =Pakistan= The Islamic Republic of Pakistan officially promotes Islamic banking for example by (starting in 2002) prohibiting the startup of conventional non-Islamic banks. Among its Islamic banking programmes is establishing \\"musharaka pools\\" for Islamic banks using its export refinance scheme. Instead of lending money to banks at a rate of 6.5% for them to lend to exporting firms at 8% (as it does for conventional banks), it uses a musharaka pool where instead of being charged 8%, firms seeking export credit are \\"charged the financing banks average profit rate based on the rate earned on financing offered to ten \`blue-chip\` bank corporate clients\\".Khan, Islamic Banking in Pakistan, 2015: p.105 However, critic Feisal Khan complains, despite \\"rigamarole\\" of detailed instructions for setting up the pool and profit rate, in the end the rate is capped by the State Bank at \\"the rate declared by the State under its Export finance scheme\\". Another use of musharaka in Pakistan is by one of the largest Islamic banks (Meezan Bank) which has attempted to remedy a major problem of Islamic banking namely providing lines of credit for the working needs of client firms. This it does with a (putative) musharaka \\"Islamic running finance facility\\". Since the workhorses of Islamic finance are product-based vehicles such as murabaha, which expire once the product has been financed, they do not provide steady funding a line of credit for firms to draw on. The Islamic running finance facility does. The bank contributes its investment to the firm as a partner by covering the \\"firms net (negative) position at the end of the day\\". \\"Profit is accrued to the bank daily on its net contribution using the Karachi Interbank Offered Rate plus a bank-set margin as the pricing basis\\". However according to critic Feisal Khan, this is an Islamic partnership in name only and no different than a \\"conventional line of credit on a daily product basis\\".Khan, Islamic Banking in Pakistan, 2015: p.105-6 =Islamic Development Bank= Between 1976 and 2004 only about 9% of the financial transactions of the Islamic Development Bank (IDB) were in PLS,29th IDB Annual Report 1424H (2003-2004), Jeddah: Islamic Development Bank 2004, increasing to 11.3% in 2006-7.Islamic Development Bank 2007, 32nd IDB Annual Report 1427H This is despite the fact that the IDB is a not a multilateral development agency, not a for-profit, commercial bank.

NA-TST has been introduced in 1988 by Prof. J.C. Lorquet. In general, all of the assumptions taking place in traditional transition state theory (TST) are also used in NA- TST but with some corrections. First, a spin-forbidden reaction proceeds through the minimum energy crossing point (MECP) rather than through transition state (TS). Second, unlike TST, the probability of transition is not equal to unity during the reaction and treated as a function of internal energy associated with the reaction coordinate. At this stage non-relativistic couplings responsible for mixing between states is a driving force of transition. For example, the larger spin-orbit coupling at MECP the larger the probability of transition. NA-TST can be reduced to the traditional TST in the limit of unit probability.

As of 2011 the reserve supported about 265 traditional extractive families. Location The Uacari Sustainable Development Reserve is in the municipality of Carauari, Amazonas. It has an area of . The Rio Bi√° Indigenous Territory lies to the north of the western part of the reserve. The Deni IndigenousTerritory is to the south. The Juru√° River flows through the western part of the reserve from south to north, and forms the northern boundary of the eastern part, dividing it from the M√©dio Juru√° Extractive Reserve. It takes seven days to reach the reserve by boat from Manaus. The environment includes terra firma rainforest, v√°rzea forest, small hills, campina and flooded land with grass and dead trees, small islands, lakes and streams. There are at least 19 species of primate, including the threatened bald uakari (Cacajao calvus). There are many turtles, a great many fish, a large population of alligators and at least 30 species of medium and large mammals. As of 2007 there were 29 communities in the reserve. History The Uacari Sustainable Development Reserve was created by Amazonas state governor decree 25.039 of 1 June 2005 with the objectives of conserving nature and ensuring the conditions needed to sustain and improve the quality of life of the traditional extractive population. It became part of the Central Amazon Ecological Corridor, established in 2002. On 17 October 2005 the Instituto Nacional de Coloniza√ß√£o e Reforma Agr√°ria (INCRA ‚Äì National Institute for Colonization and Agrarian Reform) recognised the reserve as meeting the needs of 200 families of small rural producers, who would qualify for PRONAF support. The deliberative council was created on 25 February 2008. The management plan was approved on 8 June 2008. The reserve was covered by the Bolsa Floresta program by the end of 2008. In 2011 FAS and HRT Oil & Gas signed a partnership for investment in the reserve of R$4 million to be used for Bolsa Floresta and support programs. Funding would be directed to sustainable production, education and health of the extractive population of the reserve. In 2013 Bolsa Floresta Familiar support was going to 1,353 people in 265 families living in 30 communities. A pioneering program on sustainable production in protected areas was launched in the reserve on 14 September 2013. The course consists of over a thousand hours of classes focused on the main products with economic potential in the Middle Juru√° region such as rubber, flour, wood, andiroba oils, arapaima, liana-titica, turtles and alligators. Students prepare business plans at the end of the course for harvesting, processing and marketing the various types of product. The course was given at the Bauana Centre for Conservation and Support for Sustainable Entrepreneurship, built in 2011 on the right bank of the Juru√° through the partnership between FAS and HRT Oil & Gas. The centre has two classrooms and a modern laboratory with computers connected to the internet. As of 2016 the reserve was supported by the Amazon Region Protected Areas Program.

In the interwar period, the town (Sambor) was part of the Second Polish Republic. In 1941, the Germans captured the town at the beginning of Operation Barbarossa. According to the Polish census of 1931, Jews constituted nearly 29 percent of the town's inhabitants, For the current population numbers within Ukraine see: most of whom were murdered during the Holocaust. Sambor (Sambir) is not to be confused with the much smaller Old Sambor (Stary Sambor, now Staryi Sambir) located close-by, although their Jewish history is inextricably linked together. Background When the Second Polish Republic was formed in 1918, both Sambor and Stary Sambor became seats of separate gminas. In 1932, the counties were joined as one administrative area. The Jewish population grew steadily. Brand new schools including Jewish gymnasium and Bais Yaakov for girls were established, as well as new industrial plants, unions, Jewish relief organizations, and several Zionist parties such as World Agudath Israel. Jews engaged in trade, crafts, carter, agriculture, and professional activities. Jewish cultural institutions included a large library and a sports club. On 8‚Äì11 September 1939, Sambor was overrun by the 1st Mountain Division of the Wehrmacht during the Polish Battle of Lw√≥w. Also in: It was transferred to the Soviet Union in accordance with the German-Soviet Frontier Treaty signed on 28 September 1939. German and Soviet soldiers in Sambor after the 1939 invasion of Poland. After the Soviet takeover, the wealthy and middle class Polish Jews were arrested by the NKVD and sentenced for deportation to Siberia along with the Polish intelligentsia. Some pro-Soviet Jews were given government jobs. [sources not listed] The economy was nationalized; hundreds of citizens were executed out of sight by the secret police as \\"enemies of the people\\". Sambor became part of the Drohobych Oblast on 4 December 1939. On June 22 June 1941, Germany invaded the Soviet Union in Operation Barbarossa. During the hasty evacuation of the political prison in Sambor, the NKVD shot 600 prisoners; 80 corpses were left unburied for lack of time. Sambor was taken over by the Wehrmacht on 29 June. The city became one of a dozen administrative units of the District of Galicia, the fifth district of the General Government with the capital in Lemberg. Along with the German troops arrived the Ukrainian task forces (pokhidny hrupy), thoroughly indoctrinated at the German training bases in the General Government. See also: The OUN followers (Anw√§rters included) mobilized Ukrainian militants in some 30 locations at once, See also: including in Sambor; and in accordance with the Nazi theory of Judeo- Bolshevism launched retaliatory pogroms against the Polish Jews. The deadliest of them, overseen by SS-Brigadef√ºhrer Otto Rasch, took place in Lw√≥w beginning 30 June 1941. On 1 July 1941 the Ukrainian nationalists killed approximately 50‚Äì100 Polish Jews in Sambor, but similar pogroms affected other Polish provincial capitals as far as Tarnopol, Stanis≈Çaw√≥w and ≈Åuck. See also: The Ghetto The German authorities forced all adult Jews to wear the Yellow badge. In July 1941, a Judenrat was formed in Sambor on German orders, with Dr. Shimshon (Samson) Schneidscher as its chairman. In the following months, Jews were being deported to the open-type ghetto in Sambor from the entire county. On 17 July, Heinrich Himmler decreed the formation of the Schutzmannschaften from among the local Ukrainians, owing to good relations with the local Ukrainian Hilfsverwaltung. By 7 August 1941 in most areas conquered by the Wehrmacht, the units of the Ukrainian People's Militia have already participated in a series of so-called \\"self-purification\\" actions, closely followed by the killings carried out by the Einsatzgruppe C. The OUN-B militia spearheaded a day-long pogrom in Stary Sambor. Thirty-two prominent Jews were dragged by the nationalists to the cemetery and bludgeoned. Surviving eyewitnesses, Mrs. Levitski and Mr. Eidman, reported cases of dismemberment and decapitation of the victims. Afterwards, a Jewish Ghetto Police was set up, headed by Hermann Stahl. Jews were ordered to hand‚Äìover their furs, radios, silver and gold. Tkacka Street in Sambor before the Holocaust in occupied Poland, 1939 Among the people trapped in the Sambor Ghetto were thousands of refugees who arrived there in an attempt to escape the German occupation of western Poland, and possibly cross the border to Romania, and Hungary. Confined to the Blich neighbourhood of Sambor ‚Äì the ghetto was sealed from the outside on 12 January 1942, and the ghetto became closed. Jews from different parts of the city along with inhabitants of neighbouring communities, including Stary Sambor, were transferred to the Ghetto by March 1942. A curfew was imposed, subject to on-sight shooting. Deportations to death camps In July 1942, the first killing centre of Operation Reinhard built by the SS at Belzec (just over 100 kilometres away) began its second phase of extermination, with brand new gas chambers built of brick. Also in: Archeologists reveal new secrets of Holocaust, Reuters News, 21 July 1998. Sambor Jews were rounded up in stages. A terror operation was conducted in the ghetto on 2‚Äì4 August 1942 ahead of the first deportation action. The 'resettlement' rail transports to Belzec left Sambor on 4‚Äì6 August 1942 under heavy guard, with 6,000 men, women, and children crammed into Holocaust trains without food or water. About 600 Jews were sent to Janowska concentration camp nearby. The second set of trains with 3,000‚Äì4,000 Jews departed on 17‚Äì18 and 22 October 1942. See also: On 17 November 1942 the already depopulated ghetto was filled with expellees from Turka and Ilnik. Some Jews escaped to the forest. The town of Turka was declared Judenfrei on 1 December 1942. Irrespective of deportations, mass shootings of Jews were also carried out. In January 1943 the Germans along with the Ukrainian Auxiliary Police rounded up 1,500 Jews deemed 'unworthy of life'. They were trucked to the woods near Radlowicz (Rad≈Çowicze, Radlovitze; now Ralivka) and shot one by one. Among those still alive in the ghetto death by starvation and typhus raged. After the long winter, new terror operations in the ghetto took place in March, or April 1943. The Gestapo utilized Wehrmacht units transiting through Sambor to round up Jews. All houses, cellars and even chimneys were searched. The 1,500 captives were split in groups of 100 each. They were escorted to the cemetery, where Jewish men were forced to dig mass graves. The liquidation of the ghetto was approaching. In June, deputy to the Judenrat chairman, Dr. Zausner, gave a speech full of hope because the Gestapo office in Drohobicz agreed to save a group of labourers in exchange for a huge ransom. Nevertheless, on the night of 8 June 1943 the Ukrainian Hilfspolizei set the ghetto houses on fire. In the morning, all Jewish slave labour were escorted to prison, loaded onto lorries and trucked to the killing fields at Rad≈Çowicze. The ghetto was no more; the city was declared \\"Judenrein\\". The Soviet Red Army liberated Sambor a year later amid heavy fighting with the retreating Germans, around 7 August 1944. Some Jews had managed to dig a tunnel leading to a sewer out of the ghetto and escaped to the partisans in the forest. A number of local gentiles aided some of the escapees. Righteous Among the Nations who helped Sambor Ghetto's Jews included the Plewa family Celina Kƒôdzierska, the Bo≈Ñkowski family and the Oczy≈Ñski family. In 1943, the Nazi police executed at least 27 people in Sambor for attempting to hide Jews. Altogether, about 160 Jews survived, mostly by hiding with Poles and Ukrainians in the town or the surrounding countryside.  Post war  Several of the members of the German civilian administration and security apparatus of the town received imprisonment sentences; others did not. \\"During the Soviet era, the Jewish cemetery of Sambor lost its original function and was levelled. Plans were made to construct a sports field on the site.\\" Since 1991, Sambir (–°–∞–º–±—ñ—Ä) is part of sovereign Ukraine. In 2000, an attempt to preserve the site of the mass shootings of Jews, for a Holocaust memorial park, was effectively stopped.

Smith's inquiries soon bring him to the attention of Lord Wayland, a powerful Tory landowner, who is keen for Springheel Jack to be caught before his reign of terror gets out of hand. Now single-handedly responsible for catching the fiend, Smith and Hooks investigate Clapham Common, the apparent epicentre of the attacks. Chough and D'Urberville also head for the common following a tip- off, and mistakenly apprehend another young woman, Mary Stevens. Responding to Mary's screams, Smith races to her rescue. While Smith faces off against the two villains, Mary escapes and runs straight into the monstrous Springheel Jack. Meanwhile, Smith quickly succumbs to D'Urberville's deadly garrotte... Episode 2: The Crypt of Evil Having survived the attack on the common, Smith and Hooks make a connection between the recent sightings and the nearby Morgan Arms pub. Meanwhile, at a lavish masquerade ball, Lord Wayland entertains the Duke of Wellington and other guests ‚Äì including the Marquis of Waterford ‚Äì before excusing himself to hold a secret meeting... with Chough and D'Urberville. Wayland has hired the two thugs to find Charlotte, and despite their failure he is confident that she will seek him out. As storm-clouds gather, Charlotte is allowing the mysterious power of the Burning Truth to guide her. Springheel Jack, attracted by the mystical pendant, attacks the carriage in which she is travelling but Charlotte fends him off. The carriage crashes, and Charlotte continues her journey on foot. Smith visits the Morgan Arms, and learns from the landlord, Burden, and barfly Tom Millbank, that the Duke of Wellington is to lead a hunt for Springheel Jack. Then he and Hooks hot-foot it to the scene of the crash and learn from the concussed coachman that his lady passenger was heading to Scratch Row ‚Äì the location of the fire in which Smith's parents died. Smith and Hooks catch up with Charlotte in a deserted church just in time to save her from Chough and D'Urberville. After knocking out the villains, the three heroes find a secret passage and discover a Black Mass in progress. The high priest is none other than Lord Wayland himself, and his ritual incantation causes the Burning Truth to emit an otherworldly noise, alerting the devil-worshipers to their presence. As a heavy stone door cuts off their escape, it looks like Smith is about to be crushed... Episode 3: The Face of the Fiend Smith, Hooks and Charlotte flee to the bell-tower with the Satanists in pursuit. Trapped in the belfry, Springheel Jack suddenly appears. The Satanists cower while our heroes escape across the rooftops. However, Hooks falls to his death, forcing Smith to give up the chase. An injured Jack meanwhile recovers in a side street, startling Lucy Scales who passes by his hiding place in Green Dragon Alley... Smith goes to the Chief Constable to tell him all he knows, but the Chief informs him that Thomas Millbank has been arrested in connection with the latest attack on Jane Alsop, and the case is going to trial. Knowing that the real Springheel Jack is still out there, Smith and Charlotte return to the Morgan Arms to find out from Mr. Burden how Millbank came under suspicion. The culprits ‚Äì Chough and D'Urberville ‚Äì duly arrive and Smith stalls them while Charlotte escapes. Knocked unconscious and stuffed in a carriage, Smith is delivered to Lord Wayland at his riverside mansion, with Charlotte and the Burning Truth following at a discreet distance. Smith is welcomed by Wayland, who believes that Springheel Jack is Lucifer himself. All Wayland now needs to meet his master face-to-face is the Burning Truth, and he suspends Smith above a vat of boiling oil in order to force its whereabouts out of him. Charlotte comes to Smith's rescue, and duly summons Springheel Jack with the pendant. After a tense confrontation between Wayland and Springheel Jack, Charlotte and Smith swing through the window and land in the Thames just as a desperate Wayland ignites the vat of oil and perishes in the fireball. Racing to Lambeth Street Court, Smith and Charlotte arrive too late to affect the trial. However, Millbank has been cleared anyway due to his inability to breathe the blue flame. With the case officially closed, Charlotte returns to Europe and Smith is promoted on condition he keeps his mouth shut. But Smith's obsession to capture Springheel Jack has only just begun... =Series Two: The Legend of Springheel'd Jack= Episode 1: The Terror of London Famed penny dreadful writer James Malcolm Rymer tells his 'one true story' which took place in 1845 when he was a struggling newspaper hack. His tale commences on Jacob's Island, Bermondsey, where a 13-year-old pickpocket, Maria Davis, is pursued by a spring-booted, fire-breathing maniac, and killed with a burst of flame. Inspector Garrick and Sergeant Skeres are already on the scene when Detective Inspector Jonah Smith arrives, tipped off at the alleged sighting of 'Springheel Jack'. Satisfied that the killer is an impostor, Smith makes his exit, bumping into the young Rymer who is there in his capacity as a freelance reporter. Despite Rymer's eagerness, Smith brushes him off and heads home. Frustrated by yet another dead end, the now heavy-drinking Smith is surprised by an unexpected visitor ‚Äì Charlotte Fitzrandolph! Despite resenting her lack of contact over the past seven years, Smith is won over by her new lead on Springheel Jack. There seems to be a connection between authentic Springheel Jack sightings and the tour dates of a travelling theatre company known as the Harlequin Players. Smith agrees to meet Charlotte that night at a nearby penny gaff at the Fighting Cocks Inn where the Harlequin Players are due to perform. That night, Smith senses Springheel Jack's presence and momentarily sees him atop a roof. With his hope rekindled, Smith becomes aware of footsteps following him and ambushes his stalker ‚Äì Rymer! Despite Smith's initial misgivings, Rymer convinces him to let him tag along. They arrive at the penny gaff but Charlotte is nowhere to be seen. The Harlequin Player's master of ceremonies, Oscar Snitterfield, introduces the Punch and Judy show (in which the character of the Devil is now substituted with 'Springheel Jack') and afterwards they get chatting to the Punch and Judy Man himself, 'Professor' Elijah Hopcraft. The following magic act consists of doddery magician Cuthbert Leach, aka 'The Great Majesto' and his 'lovely assistant', the pugnacious Lizzie Coombe. When Lizzie's charms indirectly trigger a pub brawl, Smith makes himself scarce and goes in search of Charlotte. While a performance of The Murder in the Red Barn distracts the other patrons, Charlotte warns Smith that she has made a terrible mistake by confiding in a mysterious man she met in Paris. About to reveal his name, Charlotte is felled by a single gunshot. She survives just long enough to give Smith a cryptic clue to the mystery, then dies in his arms. Found over the body, the pub's denizens mistake Smith for the killer and chase him into the night... Episode 2: The Carnival of Horrors With Smith on the run, Garrick and Skeres are given the job of tracking him down. Smith, it transpires, has been secretly taken in by Lizzie and hidden from the other members of the theatre troupe at Bartholomew Fair. In exchange for her help in clearing his name, Lizzie wants Smith to help her find Springheel Jack, whom she blames for the death of Maria Davis. Maria was a member of the infamous pickpocketing gang, Dreadful Penny's Mob, and Lizzie reveals to Smith that she is the infamous Dreadful Penny herself. Smith agrees to join forces but first resolves to attend Charlotte's funeral, albeit in disguise. Watching the funeral from a distance, Smith is surprised to find Hopcraft also present. Hopcraft admits that he's the man that Charlotte met in Paris and goes on to reveal that he, like Smith, also lost his parents in the Scratch Row fire and saw Springheel Jack rise from the flames. Hopcraft divulges to Smith that there were in fact two artifacts associated with the inferno at Scratch Row; the pendant known as the Burning Truth and a mysterious box about which much less is known. Hopcraft explains that while Springheel Jack has regained possession of the Burning Truth, he is still searching for his box... which is currently in the possession of Cuthbert. Hopcraft and Smith take seats in the audience of the magic act to observe the so-called 'Box of Emet' up close, when Smith accuses Hopcraft of killing Charlotte. Hopcraft brushes her murder aside and urges Smith to join forces with him. Smith refuses, and finding himself trapped between the police and the killer, Smith does the only thing he can think of: he volunteers to help Cuthbert in his next trick! Smith takes to the stage and allows Cuthbert to guide him through the magic act. When it comes to placing his hand on the Box of Emet, Smith experiences a rush of memories and psychic insights. Suddenly the fire-breathing, spring-booted Copycat Jack appears and tries to take the box. Before it can get close, the real Springheel Jack leaps into the scene and the two Jacks face off against each other. Hopcraft flees, Smith escapes and both Jacks leap away into the night, hunted by police and angry mobs. Smith hides in a deserted attic space, and he realises too late that he's actually discovered Springheel Jack's rooftop lair. When Jack returns, Smith finds himself unexpectedly comforting the hulking being as an angry mob gets nearer. Smith urges Jack to keep quiet, emerges onto the rooftop and draws the mob away. He flees across the rooftops and eventually finds himself trapped on London Bridge. Smith professes his innocence and although Garrick now believes him, he knows he'll still hang for murder. Promising to solve the mystery once and for all, Smith steps away from his colleague and throws himself into the freezing Thames. Episode 3: The Engine of Doom The next day, Rymer bids farewell to Lizzie at Paddington Station. The Harlequin Players are taking the train to Slough to perform before Queen Victoria at Windsor Castle. As Rymer leaves, a very-much-alive Smith pulls him into an alley and tells him they have to prevent Cuthbert using the Box of Emet in the Queen's presence. Hopcraft also stows aboard, and just before the train departs Garrick gets on as well, ordering Sergeant Skeres to arrange for a detachment of soldiers to arrest Smith when they arrive at Slough. Smith and Rymer find Lizzie and the three of them search the luggage van for the box. Instead they discover clues that show that the Copycat's costume is made up of discarded Harlequin Players props, and that the maniacal killer must therefore be one of the troupe. Cuthbert finds them in the van and after Lizzie fills him in, he shows them the trick with the box again. Smith theorises that only certain 'gifted' people can make the box 'sing', and moments later the four are attacked by the Copycat, who seizes the box and escapes to the next carriage. Lizzie grabs her pistol and gives chase, determined to avenge Maria's death. Cornering the Copycat, Lizzie removes its mask to reveal Ethel, the troupe's fortune-teller. The box emits an agonising signal which fatally injures the old lady, and before she dies she explains how the box has driven her mad. At this moment Garrick appears, but before he can arrest Smith, Hopcraft steals the box. Hopcraft fires a parting shot which hits Cuthbert, and Garrick and Smith go after him. Hopcraft hijacks the train and lights the fuse on a barrel of gunpowder. Before he can uncouple the locomotive, Smith climbs aboard the train roof and reaches him. As they struggle, Garrick, Lizzie, Rymer and Oscar attempt to defuse the bomb. Hopcraft makes his escape by leaping off the train into Slough Weir. The others break through to the locomotive but the brakes have been damaged and the train can't be stopped. Cuthbert ‚Äì mortally wounded ‚Äì helps uncouple both the locomotive and the carriage containing the bomb, but necessarily has to stay with them. As the rest of the train decelerates, Cuthbert bids them goodbye and dies in the explosion. Smith attempts to return the box to Springheel Jack, who has been following the whole time. However, the soldiers sent to arrest Smith arrive and scare Jack off. Smith and the other survivors decamp to the nearby Ostrich Inn, while the box is taken to Aldershot barracks. As the story comes to a close, the narrator ‚Äì the old Rymer ‚Äì reveals that Smith and Lizzie got married, and admits that while the truth about Spring-heeled Jack may be important to some, he is content with the legend. =Series Three: The Secret of Springheel'd Jack= Episode 1: The Peril of the Empires United Kingdom, 1877. Springheel Jack attacks Aldershot barracks and despite huge resistance by the British army, steals back the Box of Emet. Word of the attack reaches Prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli from his Foreign Office adviser Anstruther, and he fears the Germans or Russians may be behind the raid. Anstruther thinks not, suspecting that the old rumours of Springheel Jack may be true, having been warned about this scenario by a missing agent of his, code-named 'Cheshire Cat'. He suggests to Disraeli that they seek out retired policeman Jonah Smith, who may be of help. Anstruther seeks Smith out at his lodgings and discovers him to be an ageing, alcoholic widower, no longer interested in hunting Springheel Jack, and unwilling to help. What's more, Smith is terminally ill with tuberculosis and is deliberately drinking himself to death. Anstruther leaves Smith to himself, and Smith ponders why Jack has chosen now to reclaim the box. Meanwhile, the news of the Aldershot attack reaches Prussian spymistress, the Countess de Sadesky, who shares Smith's one-time obsession to capture Springheel Jack. She and her 'right hand', the lethal Jaeger, arrive in London by submarine and send their henchmen in search of Smith. Smith drinks in his local pub and spills his heart out to Barney the landlord about his regret at not accepting Anstruther's mission. On his way home, Jaeger and sinister diplomat Vecht orchestrate his kidnap. Although Smith puts up a struggle, the Kaiser's agents take him back to the German embassy where, to the horror of the German Ambassador, they prepare to torture him. When Smith makes it clear he'd rather die than cooperate, Sadesky orders Vecht to kill their prisoner. Episode 2: The Tunnels of Death Before Vecht can kill Smith, one of his aides runs Vecht through with a sword-cane. The aide then releases Smith and reveals himself to be Anstruther's agent, 'Cheshire Cat', aka... Hopcraft! Smith and Hopcraft escape in a carriage with German agents close behind, and thanks to Hopcraft's ingenuity they lose them. Once safe from their pursuers, Smith prepares to shoot Hopcraft and then himself, but Hopcraft warns him that Sadesky is seeking to obtain Springheel Jack's advanced technology in order to weaponize it, and that they must get to him before she does. Smith agrees grudgingly to help him stop her, so they report to Anstruther. Anstruther shows them an intercepted German telegraph that points to the abandoned Scratch Row underground railway station as Sadesky's next port of call. Smith and Hopcraft return to Scratch Row and learn from the denizens of the local pub that 'Old Jack' haunts the tunnels. They break into the tube and go in search of Springheel Jack. Soon Sadesky and Jaeger arrive and follow them. Smith and Hopcraft's course takes them from the tube tunnels to the sewers, then to the lost River Effra, and finally into a forgotten mine. The Germans eventually catch them up and prepare to execute them. With no apparent means of escape, Smith uses his last bullet to cause a gigantic cave-in... Episode 3: The Lords of the World Smith and Hopcraft survive the cave-in, finding themselves on one side of the rock-slide and Sadesky and Jaeger on the other. Smith and Hopcraft have fallen through to a new tunnel of fused ceramic, created when something large and hot ploughed through the earth at high speed... on the night of the Scratch Row fire. They follow the tunnel into a huge cavern in which they discover a large, strange vessel: Springheel Jack's spacecraft. Entering the spaceship, Smith and Hopcraft discover Jack in some kind of medical isolation chamber. He's ailing but the Burning Truth, now set in the Box of Emet, is emitting a signal to the heavens. At this moment, Sadesky and Jaeger catch up and attempt to take control of the ship. Sadesky reveals that rather than being mere German agents, she and Jaeger are in fact leaders of the Bavarian Illuminati, and intend to sell the secret of Jack's technology to the highest bidder, whether that be Germany, Russia or Great Britain. Despite Smith and Hopcraft's warnings, Sadesky tampers with the controls of Jack's isolation chamber, and the ship's automatic defences come to life and disintegrate her with a death ray. Jack himself then awakes and kills Jaeger before he can harm Smith. Jack then communicates with Smith telepathically; he needs a second pilot to fly his ship back home. Hopcraft pulls a knife on Smith and threatens to kill him unless Jack takes him instead. Jack refuses, but 'gifts' Hopcraft by touching his forehead and telling Smith that he has 'cured him'. Hopcraft drops the knife and lets Smith take his place in the cockpit. Understanding what Jack has done to Hopcraft, he gives his old enemy the Burning Truth and promises he'll return one day. Hopcraft flees the ship just before take off. Smith and Jack pilot the ship out of the cavern. Hopcraft begins a decades-long wait for Smith to return, and realises that what Jack did to him was endow him with the seeds of a conscience. The recovering psychopath gradually rejoins the human race and over the years is tortured by remorse for his many crimes. Hopcraft becomes an old man but lives on in hope until, late in 1904, the Burning Truth returns to life. Drawn north to Liverpool, Hopcraft finds himself in Sefton Park during a fresh Springheel Jack scare, and is met by the spaceship as it returns. Smith emerges from the craft, only a few days having passed from his point of view, and together they bid a final farewell to Springheel Jack. The two old enemies ‚Äì now friends ‚Äì walk off into the night, musing whether Jack might ever return... In a post-credits scene set on Barnes Common in 1977, a pair of government agents in a dummy TV detector van have a close encounter with another Spring- heeled Jack.

It is a part of the Noble Network of Charter Schools. It is the newest campus in the Noble Network, and is located at West 47th street between Richmond and Mozart street in the Brighton Park neighborhood. This is Noble's first and only campus located on the Southwest Side of Chicago. It is named after donors Joe and Rika Mansueto. Joe Mansueto is the founder and CEO of Morningstar. Mansueto High School opened in 2016 at a temporary location (51st and Keeler) while its permanent building was being built from the ground up. The architectural firm, Wheeler and Kearns partnered with contractors, Bulley and Andrews, to construct the school. Finally, in August 2017, Mansueto opened at its permanent location. In 2018, the school's design received a Brick in Architecture Award. The site used to house the RC bottling plant.  About the Principal  Darko Simunovic is originally from Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina. He came to the United States when he was in 4th grade and was very lucky to attend some of the best Chicago Public Schools from 4th grade until he graduated from high school. He received his IB diploma from Lincoln Park High School. He attended Knox College in Galesburg, Illinois and it was there that he became extremely enthusiastic about education. This is where he decided to dedicate his life to education in order to ensure that all students, had the chance to attend a high performing school in the city of Chicago. Once he graduated from Knox, Mr. Simunovic joined Teach For America and taught middle school students in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. He always wanted to come back to Chicago, and in 2012 he was the founding Assistant Principal at Hansberry College Prep, another Noble Charter Schools campus. After 4 years, he graduated his advisory ‚Äì his proudest moment while at Hansberry. One of Ms. Simunovic's biggest goals when founding Mansueto High School in 2016 was to ensure that the school becomes an International Baccalaureate School by 2018 ‚Äì in time for the founding class to participate in the IB program, and he accomplished that goal.  Academic Results  In its first three years, Mansueto High School has already experienced student growth. In 2018, 9th grade student growth ranked in the 99th percentile. 64% of 9th grade students and 71.4% of 10th grade students are meeting college readiness benchmarks, as measured by the PSAT, which CPS ranks as \\"above expectations.\\" Based on the 5Essentials from the My Voice, \\"My School Survey\\" the school culture and climate is \\"well organized,\\" ranking \\"Very strong\\" in family involvement, supportive environment, and ambitious instruction and \\"strong\\" in effective leaders and collaborative teachers. Additionally, in 2017, a comprehensive report was released by Stanford University's Center for Education Outcomes (CREDO), which shows that students at the Noble Network of Charter Schools, which includes Mansueto High school, receive the equivalent of nearly two additional years of math education during just one normal school year.  College Readiness  In an effort to incorporate college readiness into the school before 12th grade, students participate in the Summer of a Lifetime program. Through Summer of a Lifetime, scholars are provided funding and support to participate in life-changing, summer academic enrichment programs on college campuses nationwide. The Noble class of 2018 included 2,300 scholars, and 98% of them were accepted to at least one college, this accumulated to over 14,700 college acceptances. Noble seniors earned a record-breaking $486 million in scholarships, including 71 recipients of the Pritzker Access Scholarship for undocumented students.

They may do so even if said child's birth parent is dead or missing.2007 Act s.30 =Consent of the child's birth parents= Generally, the consent of an adoptee's parents or guardians who have Parental Rights & Responsibilities under the Children (Scotland) Act 1995 towards the child must be obtained before the court will issue an adoption order. However the consent of the birth parents may be ignored in the following circumstances: *The parent or guardian is dead. *The parent or guardian cannot be found or is incapable of giving consent. *The court views the parent/guardian as unfit to exercise their parental rights and responsibilities (and will continue to do so). *That, when none of the above applies, the court views dispensing the parent's consent as necessary to ensure the child's welfare.2007 Act s.31 =Consent of the child= An adoption order cannot be made in respect of a child aged over 12 unless said child consents, or the court considers them not mature enough to consent2007 Act s.32 References Adoption in the United Kingdom Scots law ","title":"Adoption and Children (Scotland) Act 2007"},{"id":"51532074","text":"James D. Graham (1873-1951), was a Scottish-born American trade union leader and socialist politician. Graham is best remembered as the longtime leader of the Montana Federation of Labor (MFL) and the Socialist Party of Montana, state affiate of the Socialist Party of America, during the first decades of the 20th Century. He would serve as president of the MFL for two decades. Biography =Early years= James D. Graham was born February 2, 1873, in the coastal town of Greenock, Scotland, the son of a machinist named Michael Graham and his wife, the former Elizabeth Mann Denholm.\\"James D.

The family settled in Livingston, Montana, where Graham's father was employed by the Northern Pacific Railroad. Graham followed in his father's footsteps during his early American years, taking a job with the Northern Pacific himself as an apprentice machinist. He would eventually become a fully fledged machinist and a member of the International Association of Machinists (IAM) in 1896,Donald G. Sofchalk, \\"James D. Graham,\\" in Gary M. Fink (ed.), Biographical Dictionary of American Labor. Westport, CT: Greenwood Press, 1984; pp. 262-263. remaining active in the organized labor movement for the rest of his life. Graham married the former Jennie Whyatt in August 1903. The couple would have one child together, a son. =Trade union functionary= The younger Graham was drawn to self-education, attending night school and taking correspondence courses, in the process reading extensively in the fields of engineering, history, law, and economics, gaining particular expertise in the field of labor economics. He worked for a time as a regional organizer for the United Brotherhood of Railway Employees.David R. Berman, Radicalism in the Mountain West: Socialists, Populists, Miners, and Wobblies. Boulder, CO: University Press of Colorado, 2007; pg. 10. This background ultimately proved a springboard to employment as a top official of the International Hod Carriers, Building and Common Laborers Union of America, part of the American Federation of Labor. Around 1900 Graham was named the editor of Montana Labor News, the official newspaper of the Montana Federation of Labor (MFL), beginning what would be for him a lifetime career as a state-level trade union functionary. Graham was elected to the governing executive board of the MFL in 1901. =Socialist politician= From 1905 to 1908 Graham was the business manager of Montana News, weekly organ of the Socialist Party of Montana. Graham was a member of the so-called Chicago wing of the Social Democratic Party of America (SDP) in the late 1890s, serving as a presidential elector on the Montana ballot in support of SDP nominee Eugene V. Debs in the 1900 Presidential election.\\"Debs Democrats: State Ticket Named by Convention Last Week,\\" Red Lodge [MT] Picket, Sept. 28, 1900, pg. 8. He would become a founding member of the Socialist Party of America (SPA) in 1901. Graham was involved in Socialist Party governance from the time of formation of the Socialist Party of Montana (SPM), state affiliate of the SPA, being elected a member of the organization's governing State Committee in July 1902.\\"Socialists Back from Bozeman Convention,\\" Butte Daily Post, July 29, 1902, pg. 3. As was the case for many socialists of the era, Graham did his part for his political cause by standing for elected office under the party banner, running as a Socialist for police commissioner of Livingston in the city elections of 1903.\\"Have City Ticket: Socialists of Livingston Expect to Put Up a Hot Campaign,\\" Butte Inter Mountain, March 31, 1903, pg. 1.

From 1903 the Socialist Party of Montana was supported by a privately-owned weekly newspaper, Montana News. In October 1905, during Graham's tenure as State Secretary, it was decided that the SPM should take over the ownership of this paper and publish it on its own behalf.\\"Party Will Own Paper,\\" Montana News [Lewiston], vol. 4, no. 4 (Oct. 11, 1905), pg. 2. From November of that year Graham served as business manager of this publication, which was edited his friend and professional state party organizer Ida Crouch-Hazlett.Jeffrey A. Johnson, \\"They're All Red Out Here\\": Socialist Politics in the Pacific Northwest, 1895-1925. Norman, OK: University of Oklahoma Press, 2008; pg. 61. The moderate pair would be sacked from their positions in 1908 as the result of factional politics, amidst charges of financial shenanigans.Johnson, \\"They're All Red Out Here,\\" pg. 62. During the 1908 Presidential campaign, Graham was a state organizer for the SPA's effort on behalf of Eugene V. Debs, who made a number of speaking stops in the state as part of his whistle stop tour aboard the so-called \\"Red Special.\\"In December 1908 Graham was again elected as State Secretary of the Socialist Party of Montana.(Graham Elected Again), Montana News [Lewiston], Dec. 17, 1908, pg. 2. He would remain active in the Socialist Party but saw the party's presence in the mining states of the western United States decline precipitously in the years after World War I, to the point that by 1929 there were a mere 20 members of the Socialist Party of Montana in good standing.Johnson, \\"They're All Red Out Here,\\" pg. 161. Graham would remain an active member until the party's bitter factional split of 1936. Graham would remain a committed socialist throughout his entire life despite feeling he could no longer lend his support to the SPA as an organization. As part of his life as a political activist, Graham would gain notice as a public advocate for an array of political causes of the progressive era, including municipal ownership, women's suffrage, old age pensions, and the broad implementation of the initiative and referendum system. =Montana Federation of Labor chief= Graham was elected vice president of the MFL in 1927 and made the president of that organization in 1930. He would remain in this position for the last two decades of his life. As head of the MFL, Graham would be instrumental in helping to organize the copper miners of Butte, a multi-year effort that finally gained success in 1933 and 1934. During the years of the Great Depression, Graham served a six-year stint beginning in 1934 as associate director of the Montana employment service. He would also be drawn into government service as the chair of the Montana Selective Service Appeals Board from 1941 to 1949. Graham was a lifelong anti-Communist who in his final years was a public advocate of the expulsion of the Soviet Union from the United Nations to end its veto power over that organization's military peacekeeping efforts. =Death and legacy= James D. Graham died in his hometown of Helena, Montana on June 9, 1951, following a year of serious illness. He was 78 years old at the time of his death. Footnotes Further reading * David R.

He was best known for his work Journey to Pennsylvania (1756). Mittelberger's travelogue provides a firsthand historic account of the misery and exploitation of German immigrants during the US colonial period. In his work, he tries to convince his fellow Germans not to immigrate to the American colonies, as the forfeiture of freedom, cost of money, lack of health, and loss of life are too exorbitant to risk and sacrifice. Although never an indentured servant, Mittelberger's written testament is one of several surviving historic works describing the hardships of the redemption system. His meticulous account of his sea voyage to the British Atlantic colonies and subsequent experiences in Pennsylvania has become academically notable, due to the scarcity in primary source material concerning several of the issues he details. Such topics include religious practices in colonial Pennsylvania, European passenger fares for children and adults, as well as the nature and consequences of epidemics on colonial era ships. The work is also noted for its lengthy discussion of sexuality and social mores, including an account of a bigamous threesome and the status of illegitimate children, as evidencing the religious and sexual tolerance of colonial America. Life Balthasar Leizelt (1770s) depicting Philadelphia, as a European port city, a generation after Mittelberger came to America. In 1714, Mittelberger was born in Enzweihingen, Vaihingen County in the Duchy of W√ºrttemberg of the Holy Roman Empire. He became a schoolmaster in his native Enzweihingen but lost his job around 1750. In the spring of 1750, Mittelberger was offered a position as organist and schoolmaster in New Providence, Pennsylvania. In May 1750, he left for the town of Heilbronn, where he met up with the river boat to take him and an organ up the Neckar and Rhine into the Netherlands. From Rotterdam, he boarded the British ship Osgood for England and the British Atlantic colony of Pennsylvania. Upon arriving, Mittelberger worked for the German Saint Augustine's Church in New Providence, Pennsylvania. He also became a private instructor of music and tutor of the German language. Among Mittelberger's employers was Captain John Diemer, who led a British colonial expedition into Quebec against New France in 1746 to 1747. Becoming disenfranchised with the Province of Pennsylvania, he returned to his native Duchy in 1754. Over the next two years, Mittelberger finished writing Journey to Pennsylvania, which was subsequently published in Stuttgart, with the permission of Duke Charles Eugene of W√ºrttemberg. He died in the Duchy of W√ºrttemberg in 1758. Journey to Pennsylvania Gottlieb Mittelberger's (1756) Journey to Pennsylvania In Journey to Pennsylvania, published in 1756, Mittelberger wrote a two-part travelogue about his voyage and experiences in colonial America. The first part is entitled \\"In America\\" and focuses on the suffering of the underprivileged. The second part is entitled \\"Description of the Land Pennsylvania\\" and is more analytical, as Mittelberger discusses sociological and religious topics. Observing from the perspective of a ship passenger aboard the Dutch vessel Osgood, Mittelberger documented the harrowing experiences of the 400 impoverished European immigrants making the transatlantic voyage from Rotterdam to Philadelphia. The majority of the passengers were representative of the influx of Germans to America from Baden, W√ºrttemberg, and the Palatinate. Mittelberger details the exploitation of these poor immigrants by the Newlanders, ship crew and captains, as well as American colonists. =On religion and tolerance= Mittelberger expounds upon the lack of religious belief and practice in mid-18th century Philadelphia. He was astonished by the general absence of belief in God and a lack of knowledge of the Bible. Contrarily, he is confronted by a city dominated by free thinkers and infidels. The cultural influence of the Enlightenment is thus attested by Mittelberger's firsthand experience of religious skepticism, naturalism, and the popularity of Deism. By 1750, the decline in Christianity is indicated by the existence of only eighteen churches in Philadelphia, serving a city of over 30,000 inhabitants. As Mittelberger notes: According to historian Russell Weigley, Mittelberger was surprised by the relative lack of religious bigotry in colonial America, namely in contrast to the religious fervor and intolerance of the Old World. As Mittelberger wrote of the American colonists: \\"To speak the truth, one seldom hears or sees a quarrel among them [which is] the result of the liberty which they enjoy and which makes them all equal.\\" =On the misfortune of indentured servants= An indentured servant's contract (1738) from Bucks County, Pennsylvania. Mittelberger's primary focus concerns the tribulations of the European immigrants to the British Atlantic colonies. In particular, he wrote of the precarious transatlantic voyage, as well as the sale and exploitation of immigrants into indentured servitude. Mittelberger describes the health conditions at sea as harrowing: Mittelberger continues: =On the structure of passenger fare= As economic historian Farley Grubb states, there are scarce remaining sources in the world documenting 18th century transatlantic passenger fare. Consequently, there is historic significance in Mittelberger documenting the uniform pay for passage to America as being structured by the age of the immigrant. Children under five years of age are free. However, the fee from Rotterdam for any person ten years of age or higher was ten British pounds or 60 Dutch florins (guilders). Children between five and ten years were half priced at 30 florins or five pounds. =On sexual and familial practices= As cultural historian Clare Lyons observes, there are three lengthy sexual stories documented by Mittelberger in his travelogue. Similar to the religious tolerance of the era, colonial Philadelphia in the 1750s was relatively hospitable to various forms of sexual behavior and familial structure. As Lyons summarizes: Mittelberger gives as an example the case of an old couple living close to the Blue Mountains in rural Pennsylvania. The old woman, ill and weak, requests of her husband to marry their young servant maid Rosina. The husband and Rosina both consent to the request and marry, whereby Rosina becomes pregnant shortly thereafter. Meanwhile, the first wife's health continues to improve over time. When the colonial authorities learn of the bigamous relationship, they choose not to interfere. Whereas English law punishes bigamy by execution, the authorities do not in this case act, insofar as neither of the wives felt dissatisfied or injured by the bigamy.

She is the current USA Racquetball National Champion in Women's Doubles winning the title for a 5th time in 2019 with Aimee Ruiz. Tisinger is former World Champion in Women's Doubles, with Ruiz, winning the title in 2016.  International career  Tisinger has competed for the USA five times. Her first appearance on Team USA was in 2007, when she played Women's Doubles with Rhonda Rajsich at the Pan American Championships in Santiago, Chile, where they won gold. She didn't play on the team again until 2014, when Tisinger played Women's Singles and Doubles at the Pan American Championships in Santa Cruz, Bolivia. There she lost to Susana Acosta of Mexico in the Round of Singles of Women's Singles, 13-15, 15-7, 11-4. In doubles, Tisinger was again paired with Rajsich, but they lost in the quarterfinals to Veronica Sotomayor and Maria Paz Mu√±oz of Ecuador, 15-8, 7-15, 11-6. Her next two international appearances were in Women's Doubles with Aimee Ruiz at the 2014 and 2016 World Championships. In 2014, they lost in the final to Mexicans Paola Longoria and Samantha Salas, 15-4, 15-12. But in a rematch of that final, in 2016 Tisinger and Ruiz came out on top, beating the Mexicans, 15-11, 9-15, 11-8. Tisinger was also on Team USA for the 2018 Pan American Championships in Temuco, Chile, where she competed in both Women's Singles and Women's Doubles with Rhonda Rajsich. In Temuco, Tisinger lost to Paola Longoria in the Round of 16, 15-5, 15-5 in Women's Singles, and in Women's Doubles, she and Rajsich lost to Chileans Carla Mu√±oz and Josefa Parada, 15-14, 15-2, in the quarterfinals.  US Championships  Tisinger has won five USA National Championships in Women's Doubles, all with Aimee Ruiz as her partner. They first won in 2013, when they defeated sisters Danielle and Michelle Key in the final, 15-6, 15-8. They followed that up in 2014 by defeating Rhonda Rajsich and Kim Russell- Waselenchuk, 15-9, 15-10, in the final. Tisinger and Ruiz won for a third time in 2016, when they narrowly defeated Rajsich and Sheryl Lotts in the final, 15-12, 12-15, 11-10, which qualified them to appear at the 2016 World Championships. Tisinger and Ruiz won National Doubles for a 4th time in 2017 by defeating Da'monique Davis and Jackie Paraiso in the final, 15-5, 15-5. They won for a 5th time in 2019, when they beat Michelle De La Rosa and Danielle Maddux in the final, 15-7, 15-7. The win qualifies Tisinger and Ruiz to play on Team USA at the 2019 Pan American Games in Lima, Peru. Tisinger has also been runner up in Women's Doubles at the USA Racquetball National Doubles Championships three times. In 2015, she and Ruiz lost the final to Rajsich and Russell-Waselenchuk, 1-15, 15-10, 11-9. Her other runner up placings were in 2009 and 2010, when she and Rajsich played together. In both years, they lost to Ruiz and Jackie Paraiso. For the 2012 championships, Tisinger teamed up with Kristen Bellows, and they lost to Rajsich and Russell-Waselenchuk, 15-9, 15-4, in the quarterfinals.  Professional career  Tisinger hasn't played professional racquetball very much, so she's never been ranked in the top 10 of the Ladies Professional Racquetball Tour. Perhaps her best pro results are two quarterfinal finishes at the US Open Racquetball Championships in 2009 and 2013.  Personal life  Tisinger is the daughter of Debbie Tisinger-Moore, who is a noted racquetball player in her own right and a member of the USA Racquetball Hall of Fame. Tisinger-Moore was also an assistant coach on Team USA for the 2016 World Championships, when daughter Janel won gold.

P. interruptus has long orange antennae, bold rufous-brown and yellow bands on the mesosoma with yellow and brown markings on the thorax. Its legs are brown and yellow and the wasp's wings are brown. The amount of red, brown and yellow markings shows great individual variation. The antennae of males are straight or gently curved while females have antennae that curl at the ends. Poecilopompilus wasps may be a M√ºllerian mimics of various wasp species and this species appears to mimic paper wasps of the genus Polistes. To distinguish this species from P. algidus the observer needs to examine the spines on the front tarsi of females and the inner margin of the eyes, P. interruptus females have four weak spines on the front tarsi in females and parallel inner eye margins while P. algidus has three strong spines and shows convergent inner eye margins. Biology In California female Poecilopompilus interruptus have been collected on extrafloral nectaries of Gossypium hirsutum and both sexes captured at extrafloral nectaries of Helianthus annuus. Flowers visited include Chrysothamnus sp., Medicago sativa, Psilostrophe cooperi, Wislizenia refracta, Eriogonum fasciculatum, Eriogonum thomasii, Ribes aureum, Acacia angustissima and Penstemon rydbergii.

It contained representation of the four provinces within the Union. The coat of arms was later retained by the Republic of South Africa for a period until the end of apartheid in 1994. The 1910 coat of arms was replaced in 2000 by a more Africanised coat of arms of South Africa.  Description  The coat of arms featured a shield quartered. In each quarter was a symbol of the four provinces of South Africa. An ox wagon representing Transvaal Province, a woman with an anchor representing Cape Province, two wildebeests representing Natal Province and an orange tree representing the Orange Free State Province. The crest of the arms featured a lion holding four bound sticks. The supporters were a springbok and a gemsbok. Below the arms was the Latin motto, Ex Unitate Vires (translated as \\"Union Is Strength\\" but from 1961, translated as \\"Unity Is Strength\\"). The blazon (formal description of the arms in heraldic terms) is: \\"Quarterly per fesse wavy First Quarter Gules a female figure representing Hope resting the dexter arm upon a rock and supporting with the sinister hand an Anchor Argent Second Quarter Or two Wildebeesten in full course at random both proper Third Quarter Or upon an island an Orange tree Vert fructed proper Fourth Quarter Vert a Trek Waggon Argent And for the Crest On a Wreath of the Colours A Lion passant guardant Gules supporting with the dexter paw four staves erect alternately Argent and Azure and branded Or And for the Supporters, On the dexter side A Spring Buck and on the sinister side An Oryx (Gemsbuck) both proper together with the motto EX UNITATE VIRES.\\"  History  The arms on the South African Red Ensign 1930 to 1932 version; continued to be used until the Mulalo system in some limited respects. When Cape Colony, Transvaal Colony, Natal Colony, and the Orange River Colony joined together as the Union of South Africa, it was determined that as a dominion within the British Empire, South Africa should have its own symbol. In 1910, King George V issued a royal warrant for a coat of arms for the Union of South Africa. The arms were then used to create the South Africa Red Ensign used unofficially as the national flag of South Africa until 1928, when the Oranje, Blanje, Blou was adopted. However, the South Africa Red Ensign continued to be used at sea as the merchant ensign until 1951. In 1930, the London-based artist Kruger Gray designed an embellished version of the arms, which was officially adopted by the College of Arms in 1932. In 1961, following the declaration of the Republic of South Africa, the Republic of South Africa Constitution Act made no reference to changing the coat of arms, and therefore the 1910 grant was retained. The 1910 version used until 1930 continued to be used in some rank insignia of the South African Defence Force and its successor organisation the South African National Defence Force until 2002. The 1930 version was used on the insignia of the South African Police until the 1990s. During the apartheid era, a facsimile of the coat of arms was featured prominently on the back of the R20 denomination of the South African rand. = Replacement = Following the end of apartheid in the 1990s, the new Constitution of South Africa stated that the state coat of arms would remain the same despite the flag and national anthem changing. Nevertheless the arms were still viewed as outdated as they had been created by the white British and Afrikaner minorities without input from the black majority. In 1999, the Department of Arts and Culture held a contest to design a new coat of arms. In 2000, the coat of arms was replaced on Freedom Day. Despite the replacement, the old coat of arms was still used for some official purposes after 2000, such as on some military rank insignia until 2002 and on South African passports (which were still issued with the old coat of arms on the cover) until 2007. This was attributed to the government's desire to use up old stocks of passports before issuing ones with the new design.

The team was thus known as the Thin Thirty. While the team's record was just 3‚Äì5‚Äì2, it did include a dramatic victory in the season finale against Tennessee in Knoxville, 12‚Äì10. The winning margin was provided by a field goal by Clarkie Mayfield, one of the heroes of the game, who later died in the Beverly Hills Supper Club fire on May 28, 1977.

Postseason =Book= The 1962 Kentucky football team is the subject of a book, The Thin Thirty, by Shannon Ragland, published in August, 2007. The focus of the book is the '62 roster of players under first- year coach Charlie Bradshaw‚Äîa Bear Bryant disciple‚Äîwho ended up thinning the team from 88 to 30 players via his brutal conditioning tactics and exploitation of players. It places this in the backdrop of racial and economic tensions of the South and its impact on several players. The book asserts that several members of the 1962 team became involved in a gay sex scandal involving actor Rock Hudson, and that a crucial game was fixed that year. It then finished by following up with what happened to the players afterward. Reception The Thin Thirty received reviews in several publications, including the Voice-Tribune, the Charleston Post & Courier, the Louisville Courier-Journal and by Professor Weldon Johnson, the author of Chokehold. Jon Johnston from CornNation praises the research and epilogue, but finds the back story at 100-pages was long, the writing was redundant at times, and the assertion of the Xavier game being fixed without evidence \\"damages the credibility\\" of the book.http://www.cornnation.com/2008/3/5/04149/49965 References Kentucky Kentucky Wildcats football seasons Kentucky Wildcats football ","title":"1962 Kentucky Wildcats football team"},{"id":"51532479","text":"Dr. Thomas H.

The orphanage takes full responsibility for each girl's welfare and covers all living, educational, and wedding expenses. As of 2004, the two campuses had housed and educated over 8,000 girls. History Dedication plaque on the 1959 building Kiryat Banot (Girls Town) campus in north-central Jerusalem In the postwar years, Israel was flooded with young Holocaust refugees who were being placed in non-religious institutions by the Israeli government. Girls whose parents were unable to cope were also wandering the streets without a framework. The Toldos Aharon Rebbe, Rabbi Aharon Roth, tried to accommodate some of these girls in his own home in Jerusalem. Unable to deal with the economic burden of caring for them, he asked his chassid, Rabbi Naftali Rosenfeld (1914‚Äì2012), to take over the undertaking. Rosenfeld, a native of Kleinwardein, Hungary, was a Holocaust survivor whose first wife and three children had been murdered by the Nazis; he made aliyah after the war with his second wife, the daughter of Rabbi Moshe Yona Schlesinger of Hungary. Rosenfeld rented a basement apartment in the Mea Shearim neighborhood of Jerusalem and opened the Bayit Lepletot orphanage in 1949 with an enrollment of seven girls. While enrollment grew, conditions were difficult. By the early 1950s, Bayit Lepletot housed several dozen girls in two small rooms with a leaky roof and an outdoor toilet shared with a neighboring family. One of the rabbis in the program made a collection every morning in the synagogue and gave the proceeds to the housemother so she could buy that day's main meal. In years to come, the directors would arrange for used clothing to be sent from America. The operation of the orphanage was also difficult on Rosenfeld's wife, who had also lost her family in the Holocaust and was left alone for long periods to care for their children while her husband was away fund- raising overseas. At one point she and her husband consulted the Belzer Rebbe, Rabbi Aharon Rokeach, who blessed Rosenfeld's wife that she would be able to manage and would merit to raise good Jewish children. Rabbi Shlomo Pappenheim joined Rosenfeld as a co-director shortly after the home's founding. In 1960 Rabbi Shmuel Yitzchak Stern, an American-born accountant and grandson of Yaakov Yosef Herman, became the third co-director. Both Rosenfeld and Stern worked for the orphanage for over 50 years. Today the sons of the original co- directors fill those roles. Bayit Lepletot constructed its own building in Mea Shearim in 1959. The original quarters, renamed \\"The Small Building\\", continues to accommodate girls from preschool through fifth grade. The home also conducts activities in two neighboring buildings. In 1969 the orphanage purchased land for a second campus in north-central Jerusalem with the aid of a United States government grant. Kiryat Banot (Girls Town) opened in 1973 on a hillside below the neighborhood of Unsdorf. The campus, located at 55 Sorotzkin Street, includes a Museum of Jewish Art with collections of Jewish ritual objects. (footnote 16) Rosenfeld also established the Beit Hachlamah convalescent home for new mothers in the Bayit Vegan neighborhood in 1975. In 1987 this institution was moved to larger facilities in Telz-stone. In 2006 Bayit Lepletot was the subject of a Canadian Federal Court of Appeal case, Bayit Lepletot v. Canada (2006 FCA 128), which determined that the agency agreement between the Canadian registered charity of Bayit Lepletot and the orphanage in Israel was non-existent, since the charity's funds were being transferred to the Israeli institution through an intermediary. Description The profile of girls living at Bayit Lepletot has changed from orphans and refugees to girls from dysfunctional or abusive homes, children of terror victims, and abandoned immigrant children. The orphanage takes full responsibility for each girl's welfare, \\"acting as both surrogate parent and advocate\\" to give them the personal and emotional support they need. Girls enter Bayit Lepletot as young as three years of age and can remain at the home until their wedding. Bayit Lepletot provides both living and educational arrangements, and operates its own school for girls who scholastically lag behind their peers. It also furnishes private tutoring; dance, music, and drama therapy; and vocational training. The summer schedule includes a sleepaway camp. An average of 25 to 30 girls are married each year, with the orphanage providing all their wedding needs. By 2004, the orphanage had housed and educated nearly 8,000 girls. The two campuses together have capacity for up to 600 residents. Directors =Original co-directors= * Rabbi Naftali Rosenfeld * Rabbi Shlomo Pappenheim * Rabbi Samuel I.

Career  Slim is founding director of the Initiative for Track II Dialogues at the Middle East Institute as well as a senior research fellow at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies' Foreign Policy Institute and the New America Foundation. She has said that her interest in Track II diplomacy ‚Äî so-called to distinguish conflict-resolution conversations that are not part of official Track I talks ‚Äî came from her experiences as a girl during the Lebanese Civil War. From 1991 to 2000, Slim worked at the Kettering Foundation on the Dartmouth Conferences, confidential U.S.-Soviet, then U.S.-Russian, discussions that began in 1961 at Dartmouth College. She was part of the multi-year Inter-Tajik Dialogue. After the September 11 attacks on New York City and Washington, D.C., Slim decided to become involved in Track II diplomacy in the Middle East. She worked on an Iraqi national reconciliation dialogue involving Iraqi parliamentarians, tribal leaders and representatives of Iraqi opposition groups. After the Syrian civil war broke out in 2011, Slim initiated Track II diplomacy aimed at resolving the conflict. She particularly emphasized making women part of the conflict-resolution dialogue. The BBC's Kim Ghattas wrote in Foreign Policy, \\"The sessions organized by Slim continue, and they stand out because unlike most 'Track II' dialogues, which include only former officials and experts, these include advisors and aides to current officials. Both Saudis and Iranians have attended all the sessions.\\" As director of the Middle East Institute's Initiative for Track II Dialogues, Slim seeks to extend non- official talks to help resolve conflicts across the region.

During World War I, American sculptor Solon Borglum served at the front in a non-combatant position but was near enough to the action that he was gassed several times. While there he taught art at the AEF Art Training Center at Bellevue, Seine-et-Oise, near Paris at which hundreds of American soldiers received some art training, where he headed the sculpture department. There Borglum discovered that he liked teaching so when he returned to the United States he established the School of American Sculpture in New York.

The illustrator, Nash, was a student of Borglum's. Following Borglum's death in early 1922, an attempt to continue the school was made by appointing W.

In the first period the great majority of the wares were produced in the area of Arita, in the old Hizen Province and are covered by the terms Arita ware (or Hizen ware), Imari ware and Kakiemon, all of which have complications in their meanings in English.Lerner, \\"Introduction\\", and generally, #s 35‚Äì39; Impey, 62‚Äì63, 72‚Äì77 Arita ware blue and white underglaze porcelain tankard with Dutch silver lid of 1690 In the later period, Satsuma ware was produced almost entirely for export, and factories began to brand their wares, with Noritake and Nikko Ceramics being well-known in the West.Tharp, 83 Early period =History of the trade= Chinese export porcelain made for European markets was a well-developed trade before Japanese production of porcelain even began, but the Japanese kilns were able to take a significant share of the market from the 1640s, when the wars of the transition between the Ming dynasty and the Qing dynasty disrupted production of the Jingdezhen porcelain that made up the bulk of production for Europe, and indeed were previously very popular in Japan itself.Impey, 70‚Äì71; Lerner, Introduction Plate with Japanese court woman and birds, Imari ware, 1710‚Äì1730 The Sakoku policy of the closure of Japan to foreigners, fully in place by 1639, allowed only the Dutch East India Company and the Chinese to ship exports from Japan, after 1641 both through tightly controlled trading posts at Nagasaki, the Dutch at Dejima. The Chinese then resold cargos to other Europeans in China. The Dutch began to buy on a small scale in the 1650s, by 1656 ordering 4,149 pieces. But in 1659 64,866 pieces were ordered, beginning the large scale trade that was to continue for nearly a century;Impey, 71‚Äì72; Lerner, Introduction in later years orders were often in six figures of pieces. For the rest of the century, the great bulk of Japanese porcelain was made for export.\\"the vast majority\\" according to Lerner, \\"The Arita Export Porcelain Industry\\"; Ford and Impey, 128 The Dutch also shipped to Japan the large quantities of cobalt required for the underglaze blue colour. As well as Europe, significant quantities were landed by the Dutch in India, Persia, and southeast Asia.Lerner, \\"The Arita Export Porcelain Industry\\" This trade seems to have been preceded by exports of Arita celadon wares to south-east Asia, where most surviving examples appear.Ford and Impey, 66 Large Export Dish, c. 1660‚Äì1670, Arita ware, hard-paste porcelain with overglaze enamels, the decoration drawing on Kraak ware Chinese export porcelain, though this is normally in blue and white. The huge order placed in 1659 overwhelmed the Arita kilns, and took two years to fulfill, with the help of other kilns, and the construction of many new larger ones in Arita, as archaeology has revealed. After a few years there seem to have been about twelve kilns around Arita making export wares, and only one or two producing for the domestic market.Ford and Impey, 62 The Dutch cargoes that reached Europe (rather than being sold on the way back, in India for example) were sold at auction in Amsterdam. The Chinese purchases of porcelain were sold in Chinese ports, largely to the other European trading companies. The wares reaching European countries differed considerably, probably because of the choices of the initial exporters. Kakiemon is much more common in old European collections outside Holland (England, France, and Germany), probably because the Chinese appreciated it. Top-quality \\"Kenjo-Imari\\" ware is found more in Germany than elsewhere.Ford and Impey, 126 Japanese porcelain generally fetched higher prices in Europe than the Chinese wares, and it was not until the 18th century that factories in Europe began to produce their own porcelain, so the trade was highly profitable for the Dutch and others bringing the goods into Europe, as well as the Japanese producers, who were less efficient than the Chinese, and charged more. But by the 1720s the Chinese wares became more attractive to Europe, in terms of both price and quality, and Japanese exports declined, almost ceasing by the 1740s, by which time European porcelain production was rapidly increasing.Impey, 71‚Äì72, 77; Lerner, \\"The Arita Export Porcelain Industry\\"; Ford and Impey, 64‚Äì65, 127‚Äì128 Trade had already reduced from the 1680s on, as the Dutch became occupied with wars in Europe, and the Chinese kilns once again reached full productivity.Lerner, \\"The Arita Export Porcelain Industry\\" =Wares and styles= Generally the shapes followed European needs, following models provided by the Dutch; large flattish dishes also suited Middle Eastern and Southeast Asian dining requirements. The Dutch also supplied models for the Chinese styles of decoration they wanted, but apparently these were copied in wood from Chinese originals by Dutch carvers, explaining the crudeness of some Japanese efforts at Chinese imagery.Impey, 72; Lerner, \\"The Arita Export Porcelain Industry\\" The importation of foreign pottery was forbidden by the Japanese government in 1668, though some later pieces seem to have reached Japan; before that Japanese lords had requested examples of Delftware.Lerner, \\"Export Porcelains and Blue and White Delft Wares\\" One form of export ware rarely produced in Japan, unlike China, was armorial ware, at least partly because of the difficulty during Japan's \\"seclusion\\" of getting the designs from Europe to the Japanese decorators. There were some exceptions around 1700.Impey, 77 In blue and white wares, initially, the somewhat crude style of Chinese export porcelain known as Kraak ware was imitated for \\"open\\" shapes like plates and dishes. This seems to have been originally designed by the Chinese for Islamic southeast Asian markets, but became popular with Europeans.Ford and Impey, 68 \\"Closed\\" shapes such as vases and bottles imitated Chinese \\"transitional wares\\", which had been much exported to Japan from the 1620s on; Japanese wares in the style date mostly from 1660‚Äì1680. These were freely painted with scenes in underglaze blue.Ford and Impey, 62, 69‚Äì71; Lerner, #53‚Äì56 Arita wares with overglaze decoration (\\"enamels\\") in a wider range of colours are traditionally called Imari ware as a broad group, although they were often made in the same kilns around Arita as underglaze blue wares. Imari was merely the local port from where they were shipped to the Dutch and Chinese at Nagasaki, and not itself a centre for production. A large group is decorated in underglaze blue, to which overglaze red and gold, with black for outlines, and sometimes other colours, is added. The colouring is rich, and tends to cover most of the plate, with many plant-based designs.Impey, 74‚Äì75; Ford and Impey, 87 This contrasts with the Kakiemon style, with a very pure white body and sparse but very bright overglaze decoration in a broadly Chinese style, of birds and animals, figure scenes, and plant-based decoration.Impey, 75‚Äì77; Ford and Impey, 78‚Äì86 Some Imari wares also dropped the underglaze blue.Ford and Impey, 94‚Äì97 The last of the major groups is Ko-Kutani ware, a complex collection of wares mainly defined by their palettes of overglaze colours, and a generally rather dark tone, as well as a tendency to reflect traditional Japanese rather than Chinese influences in their decoration. Despite Kutani being a place, few if any seem to have been made there, and many were certainly made around Arita.Impey, 77‚Äì78; Ford and Impey, 100‚Äì105 File:Foliated bowl with banana tree and willow design, Japan, Arita, Edo period, 1650s to 1660s AD, enamelled Imari ware in Ko-Kutani style - Matsuoka Museum of Art - Tokyo, Japan - DSC07328.JPGKo- Kutani style, 1650s or 1660s File:Stem Bowl, Imari ware, Kokutani gosai-de type, Edo period, 17th century, landscape and figure design in overglaze enamel - Tokyo National Museum - DSC05311.JPGA lighter Ko-Kutani dish, 17th- century File:Kyushu Ceramic Museum 5232-11 Iroe-Botanhookachomon-Ozara.JPGKo- Imari dish, 1700‚Äì1740 File:Bord met polychrome decoratie met twee jongens waarvan √©√©n met een vlieger.

This was the start of the Japonisme taste that had a strong influence for the rest of the century.Tharp, 81 Japanese pottery and porcelain had continued to develop, or in many cases retain its traditional styles, during the period of minimal exports, and the earlier development of the wares that rapidly found new export markets is often unclear.Tharp, 83 Imari wares had continued to develop for the domestic market and once again became very popular in Europe, and now America. The quality of 19th-century versions varies hugely, from the very crudely-painted to extremely fine pieces from the best factories.Tharp, 81‚Äì82 Satsuma ware had begun as decorated earthenware, and was not significantly exported in the early period. But it was shown in Paris, and the local feudal lord had political connections in the West, and it became the most successful export ware, having mostly converted to a porcelain body.Tharp, 83 Late 19th-century wares were very heavily decorated, of variable quality, and much criticised on aesthetic grounds at the time and subsequently. Kutani ware also had a complicated history, and in this period was produced as both porcelain and earthenware for export.Tharp, 83 Hirado ware, in a very fine white porcelain, had been a development of the gap between the export periods, and was much used for small figures and complicated forms, often using openwork, which the fine material was suited to.Tharp, 82‚Äì83; Singer and Goodall-Cristante, 17‚Äì18, 21, 22, 25, 40 The Japanese porcelain-makers rather over-reached themselves, and in the 1880s there was something of an over-reaction, and Japanese porcelain acquired a reputation for poor quality, and prices and demand fell. Cheap wares could sell, but the better quality wares suffered, although small amounts of the highest quality wares found a market.Tharp, 83; Ford and Impey, 65 This situation largely continued until World War II. In the post-war period most Japanese exports were now in modern Western styles as interpreted by the larger Japanese companies. Distinguishing domestic and export wares Kendi for southeast Asian markets, 17th century It is usually, but not always,Lerner, #68 possible for an expert to tell from the object itself whether it was made for the domestic market or export. Some shapes are certainly European, including shaving-bowls with a crescent-shaped cut-out for the neck,Lerner, #74‚Äì80; Ford and Impey, 87‚Äì93 on these various types coffee pots and other shapes based on European silverware shapes,Lerner, #36, #58 \\"apothecary bottles\\",Lerner, #40‚Äì46 bottles in imitation of European glass shapes,Lerner, #38 and others. Some pieces were shipped to Europe as plain \\"blanks\\", and given overglaze decoration there, usually in Holland,Lerner, #62 or given metal mounts in Europe; these may even be dated, which is especially useful for historians.Lerner, #51, #58 Many export ewers were given holes at the top of the neck to facilitate the mounts, but were never mounted.Lerner, #52 Other pieces carry initials or inscriptions, especially the \\"VOC\\" (for Vereenigde Oostindische Compagnie) monogram of the Dutch East India Company.Lerner, #42‚Äì45, #51, #59‚Äì60 Some pieces can be documented back to the period in old European collections, such as a Kakiemon elephant recorded at Burghley House in England in 1688, and still there.Impey, 75 Although this becomes ever less useful, early period pieces that have a provenance going back a century or more, especially from places in India, southeast Asia or the Middle East, are likely to have been exported to that area after production. Some shapes were especially made for non-European export markets; the Islamic world wanted large platters for rice-based dishes served communally, and the kendi (or \\"gargolet\\") is a distinctive southeast Asian type of drinking or pouring vessel with two openings, one at the top of the neck, and the other lower on the body, with a rounded protuberance.Lerner, #47‚Äì50 Some pieces have old Middle Eastern metal mounts.Lerner, #54 The painted decoration of pieces also gives strong indications of the intended destination, either by copying European styles,Lerner, #53, #56 or using a style that appealed to Japanese taste, but was assumed to not appeal to Europeans.Lerner, #68‚Äì73 But interpretations of Chinese styles might be intended for either market, though generally the quality of painting is better on domestic wares. In the later period, much production for export was poorly and over-elaborately made and painted.Tharp, 83 File:È∂èÊñáÈ´≠Áöø ËÇ•ÂâçÁÑº„ÉªÂè§‰ºä‰∏áÈáåÊßòÂºè-Barber's Bowl with Cockerel MET DP281043 (cropped).jpgThe European shape of a barber's shaving basin bowl, with copulating cock, around 1700 File:Fles-Rijksmuseum NG-BR-714 (cropped).jpegBottle with Western monogram, 1690‚Äì1710 File:MET 2002 447 87.jpg18th-century armorial ware plate; far less common than from China File:Japansk urna, cirka 1700 - Hallwylska museet - 99441.tifLarge fancy vase of a type only made for export, c. 1700; this once belonged to the King of Sweden File:Potpourri bowl with cover (one of a pair) MET ES4634.jpgPotpourri bowl with cover (one of a pair), porcelain late 17th century, French ormolu mounts c. 1745‚Äì1750 File:MET 19 55 4.jpgArita ware jug with Middle Eastern mounts, 1660‚Äì1680 Notes References *Ford, Barbara Brennan, and Oliver R.

During the two days of the bridge crossing, American anti-aircraft artillery shot down almost fifty German planes. Background Map showing the breakout from the Normandy beachhead After the successful allied invasion of Normandy in June 1944, The United States Third Army was formed in France to assist in the breakout from Normandy, code named Operation Cobra. The drive to the Seine began on 3 August, when General Bradley instructed Lieutenant General George S. Patton, one of the U.S. Army's greatest exponents of armored warfare, to secure the north-south line of the Mayenne River, clear the area west of the Mayenne River as far south as the Loire, and protect the 12th Army Group south flank with minimum forces. Since the VIII Corps was driving southwest toward Rennes and the XV Corps was about to move southeast toward Mayenne, Patton oriented the XX Corps south toward Nantes and Angers. As the main American effort veered eastward in accordance with the modified OVERLORD plan and the XV Corps drove toward Laval and Le Mans, Patton ordered the XX Corps to cross the Mayenne River in a parallel drive to protect the XV Corps south flank. =Operation Tractable= The formation of the Falaise Pocket, from 8‚Äì17 August 1944 The Third Army's XV Corp drove from Meyenne South to Le Mans and then North to Argentan by 12 August 1944 where the Battle of the Falaise Pocket was developing against the German Seventh Army . The next day, the 5th U.S. Armored Division of XV U.S. Corps, advanced and reached positions overlooking Argentan.Wilmot, p. 417 On 13 August, Bradley over-ruled orders by Patton, for a further push northwards towards Falaise, by the 5th U.S. Armored Division. Bradley ordered the XV U.S. Corps to \\"concentrate for operations in another direction\\".Essame, p. 168 The U.S. troops near Argentan were ordered to withdraw, which ended the pincer movement by XV U.S. Corps.Essame, p. 182 Patton objected but complied, which left an exit for the German forces in the Falaise Pocket. =The Drive to the Seine= While the XV Corps left part of its forces at Argentan and started the wider envelopment to the Seine on 15 August, other components of the Third Army farther to the south were also driving to the Seine, sweeping clear the vast area north of the Loire River. The advance to the Seine fulfilled a prophecy made a week earlier‚Äîthat \\"the battle of Normandy is rapidly developing into the Battle of Western France.\\" Crossing Having decided to send part of Patton's force down the west bank of the Seine, the Allied commanders saw a coincident opportunity to seize a bridgehead on the east bank of the river as a springboard for future operations. The XV Corps thus drew a double mission‚Äîthe 5th Armored Division was to attack down the west bank while the 79th Infantry Division established a bridgehead on the east bank. In his order issued on 20 August, General Montgomery cautioned: \\"This is no time to relax, or to sit back and congratulate ourselves. . . . Let us finish off the business in record time.\\" By then, American troops were already across the Seine. General Ira T. Wyche had received a telephone call at 2135, 19 August, from General Haislip, who ordered him to cross the Seine that night. The 79th was to get foot troops on the east bank at once, build a bridge for vehicles, tanks, and heavy equipment, and gain ground in sufficient depth (four to six miles) to protect the crossing sites at Mantes from medium artillery fire. In a situation that was \\"too fluid to define an enemy front line,\\" General Wyche anticipated little resistance. His 79th Division had that day engaged only scattered German groups in flight, had captured nineteen vehicles and a Panzer IV tank, and had received only sporadic machine gun fire from across the Seine. The river itself was the main problem, for near Mantes it varied in width from five hundred to eight hundred feet. Fortunately, a dam nearby offered a narrow footpath across it, and engineer assault boats and rafts could transport troops and light equipment. For the bridge he was to build, Wyche secured seven hundred feet of treadway from the 5th Armored Division. \\"Through France; 14 Jun - 29 Aug 1944\\" poster 1 of 4 of battle movements of the 79th Infantry Division. While a torrential rain fell during the night of 19 August, men of the 313th Infantry walked across the dam in single file, each man touching the one ahead to keep from falling into the water. At daybreak on the 20 August, as the 314th Infantry paddled across the river, the division engineers began to install the treadway. In the afternoon, as soon as the bridge was ready, the 315th Infantry crossed in trucks. By nightfall on 20 August, the bulk of the division and its attached units, including tanks, artillery, and tank destroyers, was on the east bank. The following day, battalions of the XV Corps Artillery crossed. =Anti-aircraft Defences= Under the command of Colonel Joseph Bacon Fraser, the 23rd Anti-Aircraft Artillery Group hurriedly emplaced their pieces around the bridge, arriving in time to shoot down about a dozen enemy planes on the first day and to amass a total of 43 German planes shot down in two days. The number of planes shot down in a day was a record for a World War II American antiaircraft artillery group. Aftermath To supplement the treadway bridge, engineers constructed a Bailey bridge that was opened to traffic on 23 August. On the east bank, the 79th Infantry Division not only extended and improved the bridgehead, repelled counterattacks, and interdicted highways, ferry routes, and barge traffic lanes, but also dramatically pointed out to the Germans their critical situation by capturing the Army Group B command post at la Roche-Guyon and sending the German headquarters troops fleeing eastward to Soissons. Once the Allies were on the east side of the Seine, the Free French 2nd Armored Division and US 4th Infantry Division were able to liberate Paris from Nazi occupation on 24‚Äì25 August.

Description The tree typically grows to a height of and has smooth grey bark that becomes rough and fissured. It has angled to terete ridged branchlets. The tips of immature foliage are a silvery to whitish, coloured and densely haired. The silvery to green and herbaceous or subcoriaceous leaves form along long rachis with 5 to 18 pairs of pinnae that are in length. There are 11 to 45 pairs of pinnules that have a narrowly oblend shape and are in length with a single vein. It blooms between July and October producing simple inflorescences in axillary and terminal racemes supported on long hairy stalks. The spherical flower-heads have a diameter of and contain 20 to 26 yellow to bright yellow flowers. The seed pods that form after flowering are straight to slightly curved and occasionally twisted. The thinly leathery pods are more or less flat and often slightly constricted between the seeds with a length of and a width of and are usually have a fine white powdery coating. Taxonomy and naming A. leucoclada was first described in 1966, by Mary Tindale. The specific epithet, leucoclada, derives from two Greek words: leucos (white) and clados (shoot/sprout) which were combined to give leucocladus, - a, -um, describing the plant as having white shoots. Distribution The range of A. leucoclada extends from south-eastern Queensland to the north coast, tablelands region, the western slopes of the Great Dividing Range, the central coast, Hunter River valley and Pilliga scrub regions of New South Wales. It is mostly found as far south as Wagga and is often part of sclerophyll woodland communities growing in a variety of different habitats and soil types.

It is dedicated to the Nativity of Mary and forms part of the Ordinariate for Catholics of Armenian Rite in Romania. History Armenians first arrived in Gheorgheni, then part of the Principality of Transylvania, during the 17th century: possibly two brothers came in 1654, or a group in 1688. At first, their religious services took place in rented private homes. In 1613, a Roman Catholic parish priest had established a cemetery for foreigners behind the old Gothic chapel that dated to around 1450. In 1698, the bishop's vicar handed over the cemetery to the Armenians, who bought the chapel in 1712 from prelate Gy√∂rgy M√°rtonffy for 120 forints. In place of the chapel, they built a larger church for the growing Armenian community, but after this too proved too small, chose a new site for a church in 1729. To the right of the main entrance, there is a plaque with an inscription in Armenian that indicates the Armenians who settled in the town in 1688 built the Baroque-style church in 1733 and that it was blessed in 1772 by Antal Bajtay, Catholic bishop of Transylvania, in honor of the Nativity of Mary. Work was overseen by an Armenian-rite priest and primarily funded through contributions from religious associations. The church is surrounded by a crenellated and fortified wall that now includes the fifteen Stations of the Cross. Land for the imposing parish house was purchased in 1768. A chanter's house was built in the churchyard in 1780 and, near the edge of the land, a house for the bell- ringer. The church owns valuable books and numerous works of art. \\"Actele Parohiei Armeano-Catolice Gheorgheni\\", at the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Alba Iulia Archive site The church was entirely renovated in 1889. In the later 19th century, it acquired stained-glass windows and a pneumatic organ, while the cemetery was revamped and the parish house restored. The local Armenians founded a school in 1794 and supported a gymnasium, but a decline in population caused the school to shut down in the early 1880s. Restoration work on the church and affiliated buildings began in 2003; the old books were inventoried and the archive catalogued. The church is listed as a historic monument by Romania's Ministry of Culture and Religious Affairs, as are the 1650 chapel and the 1748 surrounding wall.

History  The rail line the trail follows now was built by Halifax and South Western Railway (H&SW;) in 1904 to service towns along the South Shore. In 1906, H&SW; merged with Canadian Northern Railway and in 1918, facing bankruptcy, was acquired by the federal government and placed under the control of the newly-formed Canadian National Railways (CN). In 1969, CN ended passenger service along the line. In 1993, after being proven to be uneconomical to keep running, the section of track west of the modern trail's route was shut down, leaving only a section of rail between Lakeside Industrial Park and CN's Fairview rail yard.Halifax and South Western Railway In 2006 CN announced the spur was to be closed within the next three years.

The solution was to build a tunnel under the trail from its highest point in Bayers Lake to the eastern trailhead in Fairview. The winning bid for construction of the tunnel was won by Dexter Construction in February 2014. Construction began on March 31 and was completely finished by December.

Very little was written or recorded about a general disabled community at the time, but their existence has been preserved through religious texts and some medical journals.  Disability in culture  The disabled community were a definite part of Medieval society. Disability was not considered an extraordinary quality among the medieval people and therefore was not heavily documented. Disability as a category of impairment was not seen in Medieval language, but rather terms such as \\"blynde\\", \\"dumbe\\", and \\"lame\\" were seen to attribute those with physical impairments. The idea of disability being undesirable or unholy stemmed from the later eugenics movement that began in the early 20th century. Many scholars, such as Henri- Jacques Stiker, author of A History of Disability, would argue that people living with disabilities \\"were no less undistinguished at the dawn of the Middle Ages from the economically weak.\\" Due to the intensive labor that constituted agriculture during this time period, many peasants and serfs have been found with extensive spinal and limb injuries, as well as stunted growth, malnutrition and general deformity. Disabled people were found among all parts of society. Monarchs across Europe were noted as having those with short stature, hunchbacks, or others with disabilities in their courts where they filled roles such as that of the King's Fool or court jester. This rank gave the disabled person a level of prestige. They were allowed to mock or tell the truth to the ruler, even if it displeased them to hear it.  Disability in religion  Christianity, the dominant religion in western Europe, held mixed views on disability. Within the Bible, disability was aligned with sin and punishment, but also with healing and martyrdom. Some Medieval priests and scholars believed that a body would be corrupted by sin and therefore divine punishment took the form of physical illnesses. However, opposing schools of thought revolved around the concept that those with disabilities showed a higher form of piety than those who did not have physical impairments. = The Bible = In the Old Testament, God gave people disabilities as a form of divine punishment, with the root of it being a payment for the sins they have committed. In the New Testament, there is much more content concerning healing and the miracles performed by Jesus Christ. = Canon Law = Canon Law, the legal codes that the Catholic Church followed, contained few restrictions against those with disabilities, such as the barring of physically disabled from becoming holy men. However, there were contradictory laws within the codes, allowing for those who were disabled after reaching priesthood to be able to move up the hierarchy and become bishops. The Fourth Lateran Council of 1215 enacted a law that linked bodily infirmity to sometimes be caused by sin. Therefore, Medieval physicians were asked to hear their patients confessions so that their soul would be \\"cured\\" before the body was assessed. = Charity = Among the monasteries and churches of Medieval Europe, charity was often given to those seen as disadvantaged or impaired. The disabled community were among the largest of groups to have benefited from the charity of local monks and priests. France's Louis IX (Saint Louis) granted blind people a rare legal right to beg on the streets of Paris.  Disability in medieval medicine  Within the medical world of the Middle Ages, illness and disability were causally linked to sin. Since religion played a large role within Medieval society, many of the changes and deformities to the human body were attributed to one's sins, dating back to Original Sin. There were mixed reactions and perspectives of people with disabilities, because different groups of Christians viewed disabilities in different ways. Generally, Medieval physicians attributed much of their work to a combination of the ability to treat illness, such as fever and blisters, and religious faith. If an illness or physical impairment did not subside over time, it was considered an \\"incurable illness\\" and therefore was deemed as an act of God. Mental disorders were often classified under demonic possession, as they were not within the physician's ability to diagnose or treat at the time and therefore patients with mental disorders were left to pray for divine healing. Within the High Middle Ages, an almshouse in the City of London began caring for people with mental disabilities, and Bethlem hospital became the first mental institution in Europe. = Leprosy = Lepers offered one of the most familiar images of disability in the medieval period. A disease that affected many throughout medieval Europe, leprosy was caused by a combination of poor hygiene and lack of resources such as proper treatments for the disease. At the time, there were mixed feelings about this group. Some, such as Francis of Assisi, argued that lepers were those who transformed themselves into the images of Jesus Christ and were to be treated as living symbol for his martyrdom. Others, especially after the Bubonic Plague began to ravage Europe towards the Late Medieval period, condemned the lepers as sinful and having been the very people to spread the plague. To stop the spread of the horrifying disease, officials put individuals displaying symptoms and sometimes family members into leper houses. They were often in secluded locations and fashioned after monasteries. = Glass delusion = A few notable cases of glass delusion occurred during the Late Middle Ages. This mental disorder involved a person believing that they were made of glass and that they were fragile, able to break or shatter upon impact. = Melancholia = Melancholia was believed to be caused by an imbalance of the Four humours within the human body, where an excess of black bile caused depression-like symptoms of sadness and sluggish, lethargic behavior.  Notable disabled people of medieval Europe  Though disability was present throughout the Middle Ages, very few cases were documented during the Early and High Medieval periods, as few physicians could properly diagnose many conditions. * King Charles VI of France (1368‚Äì1422; ruled 1380‚Äì1422), known as Charles le Fou (Charles the Mad), known to have suffered from Glass delusion during his rule. * King Henry VI of England (1421‚Äì1471; ruled 1422‚Äì1461 and 1470‚Äì1471) * Nicasius Voerda, born blind and attended Louvain University in 1459, qualifying in arts and theology, later enrolling in University of Cologne in 1489 and earning a doctorate of canon law. * Aelred of Rievaulx (1110‚Äì1167), English writer, abbot, and saint, suffered from self-inflicted malnutrition (fasting), as well as severe arthritis.

He was also a Member of Parliament from 1910 until his death. Early life He was born into a Transdanubian bourgeois family in Szombathely on 16 August 1852, as the third child of J√≥zsef M√°rkus, Sr. (1822‚Äì1873), who worked as a miller at the local gristmill, owned by Prince F√ºl√∂p Batthy√°ny. His mother was Anna Roz√°lia Horv√°t (1823‚Äì1916), a sister of jurist and politician Boldizs√°r Horv√°t, who served as Minister of Justice between 1867 and 1871, in the cabinet of Count Gyula Andr√°ssy. His parents married on 25 November 1846 in Szombathely. J√≥zsef M√°rkus had six siblings, including politician Istv√°n M√°rkus (1847‚Äì1880), poet Mikl√≥s M√°rkus (1849‚Äì1882) and actress Em√≠lia M√°rkus (1860‚Äì1949). When the mill burned down after an accident, the extended family moved to Boldizs√°r Horv√°t. After the early death of their father in 1873, the smaller M√°rkus children were raised by Horv√°t in Budapest, who retired from politics by then. J√≥zsef M√°rkus finished his elementary and secondary studies in his birthplace. He attended the Faculty of Law of the University of Pest (today E√∂tv√∂s Lor√°nd University, ELTE). After graduation, he got a job in the Ministry of Justice, when his uncle still held the position of minister. Decades later Ferenc Harrer pointedly noted in his memoir (Egy magyar polg√°r √©lete, \\"The Life of a Hungarian Bourgeois\\") that M√°rkus could thank his professional career merely because of his family relationships. He added that M√°rkus \\"was lack of knowledge and diligence\\". In contrast, other contemporaries argued that M√°rkus had \\"classical education, brilliant oratorical skills and extraordinary working capacity\\". M√°rkus married to a Hungarian noblewoman Janka Feigler (1858‚Äì1931) in 1877. They had two children, author and civil servant Jen≈ë (born 1879) and pianist Lily (born 1888) who was the wife of painter and graphic Lajos Sz. Gyenes (1890‚Äì1971). Early career M√°rkus soon continued his career as a journalist. He was an author of the progressive Reform daily newspaper, before joining as a columnist responsible for Budapest affairs to the Nemzeti H√≠rlap, edited by Istv√°n Toldy, in 1873. In that capacity, M√°rkus began increasingly interested in politics and administration of Budapest. Due to the encouragement of his uncle, he took a draftsman traineeship at the Budapest City Hall in 1875. After a few months, he was appointed assistant clerk by Mayor K√°roly Kamermayer in 1876, thus M√°rkus became a direct employee to the mayor. In 1879, he was appointed notary at the city council's meetings. He played a major role in the establishment of the Elevator House and several other warehouses in the early 1880s, as a result he was awarded the Crowned Gold Cross of Merit by King Francis Joseph in 1884. Following this success, he was promoted to Chief Notary of Budapest on 1 April 1885. He was elected a councillor to the Municipal Local Board of the General Assembly of Budapest five years later, on 1 April 1890, he was the youngest person who held the dignity during that time. In that capacity, he chaired the Finance and Economy Department. Following the death of the incumbent office-holder Guszt√°v Alk√©r, M√°rkus was elected Second Deputy Mayor by the General Assembly on 21 February 1894. As the youngest councillor, he gained 231 of the 279 votes. Mayor Kamermayer cited M√°rkus' \\"irreproachable character, unparalleled intellectual ability and professionalism [...]\\" when his protegee took the office. Shortly thereafter M√°rkus led a 25-member delegation to Turin, where freedom fighter and statesman Lajos Kossuth died after spending his last years in exile on 20 March 1894. M√°rkus personally arranged for the repatriation of his corpse. Amid a sensitive political climate, Kossuth was buried in the Kerepesi Cemetery following a huge and ceremonious funeral procession on 1 April 1894. Having regard to the monarch Francis Joseph and the Austrian counterpart, the Hungarian cabinet did not represent officially itself at the event. On behalf of the city administration, M√°rkus actively involved in the organization of the funeral. Kamermayer also had to stay away from the ceremony, thus Budapest was represented by First Deputy Mayor K√°roly Gerl√≥czy at the highest level, who gave a speech too. M√°rkus took part in the establishment of a new administrative structure in Budapest, which increased the importance of district offices (called prefectures during that time). Formerly, he was a co- author, alongside Kamermayer, of a draft (\\"Memoir concerning the market halls\\"), which described the plan of development of a network of market halls in the 1890s. The most impressive piece of this project was the Great Market Hall, which was completed in 1897, when M√°rkus already occupied the mayoral seat. In May 1895, along with Jen≈ë R√°kosi and Count J√≥zsef Majl√°th, he was a founding member of the National Association (), which set the objective of improve social conditions for workers, and ethnic reconciliation to counteract socialist and nationalist conflicts and protests countrywide. M√°rkus' political influence gradually increased in parallel with Kamermayer's deteriorating health condition. Throughout the 1896 millennium celebrations, lasted from 2 May to 31 October, which commemorated the anniversary of the Hungarian conquest of the Carpathian Basin, M√°rkus personally managed the program of events on behalf of the city administration and maintained contact with the B√°nffy government. In many banquets and ceremonies, he represented Budapest. His activity was acknowledged by Francis Joseph, who awarded a title of royal counselor to M√°rkus after the events. Mayor of Budapest J√≥zsef M√°rkus in 1896 In October 1896, Kamermayer announced his retirement and resigned from his position of mayor after 23-year term. He considered the relatively young M√°rkus as his trusted successor, despite the fact that Gerl√≥czy held the office of First Deputy Mayor since the unification of the city in 1873. According to the first mayor's will, M√°rkus was elected by the General Assembly as the next Mayor of Budapest, receiving 244 votes, while his opponent, the elderly Gerl√≥czy gained only 110 votes. The election of M√°rkus as Mayor marked a generational change within the city administration (Gerl√≥czy retired from politics at the end of 1897). Ferenc Harrer argued that M√°rkus became favorite of the urban population owing to his \\"bohemian nature, powerful presence, but especially singing talent.\\" Harrer, who was critical against the city administration, added that M√°rkus' \\"adaptability guided among an emerging political class, which bursted into the place of the dying patriarchy, and they considered [M√°rkus] as perfect executive of their plans and aspirations\\". M√°rkus took his office on 25 November 1896. After taking the oath, he gave an inaugural speech, where he promised that the city administration will be respect the government's supervision and inspection rights, however he personally will prevent any effort to unauthorized influence and intentions, which fell outside the scope of the municipality law, and, especially, which sought to diminish the city's autonomy. In his speech, M√°rkus emphasized the need for reform of administrative structure, and also promised the establishment of new departments. During that time, a lot of administrative scope concentrated in the hands of the Mayor of Budapest (for instance, even civil registration of births) which provided a \\"water-headed\\" characteristics to the city administration. As a result, M√°rkus was determined to adopt decentralization laws. At the time of his 11-month term as Mayor of Budapest, M√°rkus began intensively to reorganize the office of city prosecution, the engineering office and the district agencies. However his proposals were discussed by the General Assembly only in 1899 due intentions from the Ministry of the Interior. However M√°rkus could manage to implement some corrections: few minor administrative cases (e.g. tax collection) were assigned to the lower-ranking committees and councils of the districts. He established the separate Transport Department too. Lord Mayor of Budapest After spending 23 and a half years in office, Lord Mayor K√°roly R√°th died on 30 July 1897. The position remained vacant for several months due to an intense election struggle. According to the city unification law (Statute XXXVI of 1872), the General Assembly had to elect the next Lord Mayor among the three candidates nominated by countersignature of Francis Joseph after consultations with the Ministry of the Interior. M√°rkus was elected as Lord Mayor on 25 October 1897 with 311 of 339 votes. His two opponents, J√°nos Ludvigh, President of the Administrative Court and P√©ter R√°th, Director of Kassa-Oderbergi Railway received just 28 votes jointly. Harrer published an urban legend in his memoir which suggested that M√°rkus was actually nominated by Wilhelm II, German Emperor to the position, when visited the millennium celebrations in 1896. As Lord Mayor, M√°rkus represented his predecessor's role perception, maintaining a broker relationship between the national government and the city administration. Enjoying the confidence of both sides, his election also demonstrated the basically good relations between the two sides then. In comparison to R√°th, M√°rkus tried to enforce the office's audit function by adopting a more ambitious approach, but that did not lead to conflict regarding Budapest's autonomy. J√≥zsef M√°rkus (left) with sport shooter S√°ri Soml√≥ and his sister, actress Em√≠lia M√°rkus during an international shooting competition in Pestszentl≈ërinc in May 1905 According to the contemporary press, the general public in Budapest considered M√°rkus' election as waste of an agile and energetic career, since the position of Lord Mayor was associated with limitied and more passive powers. M√°rkus put the emphasis on the balance of interests and rarely came into conflict with the national cabinet. A journalist of the Pesti H√≠rlap argued that the Lord Mayor showed his forceful behavior only against employees, which vanished during negotiations with equal partners. Nevertheless, M√°rkus had social prestige in the Hungarian public life. Francis Joseph granted him lifetime membership in the House of Magnates on 21 April 1898. M√°rkus was also awarded Knight Cross of the Imperial Austrian Order of Leopold on 20 November 1898. He was a member of the Memorial Committee for Empress Elisabeth of Austria, who was assassinated on 10 September 1898. He also received 2nd Class of the Order of the Crown (Prussia), Knight Cross of the Order of the Crown (Romania) and the 2nd Class of the Order of Saint Stanislaus of the Russian Empire. As a member of the House of Magnates, M√°rkus was active in the legislative and evaluation committees. He participated in the work of several social organizations; he served as a member of the Directorate of the Railway Society of Budapest and functioned as Chairperson of the Home of Private Officials. In 1900, he organized among the members of the General Assembly a fundraising for the deceased civil servants' widows and orphans, called M√°rkus Fund after him. On 28 October 1903, M√°rkus was re-elected as Lord Mayor of Budapest. By then the previous balanced relationship disintegrated between the Hungarian government and the city administration, in addition to economic downturn. Following the 1905 parliamentary election, a major constitutional crisis broke out when Francis Joseph appointed G√©za Fej√©rv√°ry as Prime Minister, ignoring the election results which saw a massive victory of the opposition Party of Independence and '48. Along with others, the Budapest administration declared that the Fej√©rv√°ry ministry was unconstitutional, and participated in the passive resistance against it. Accordingly, the General Assembly decided not to provide the collected taxes to the central budget, and also authorized Mayor J√°nos Halmos to deny to execute the government decrees. M√°rkus and his narrow circle disagreed with the resistance, thereafter the Minister of the Interior J√≥zsef Krist√≥ffy declared void the General Assembly's decision. Lord Mayor M√°rkus became an unpopular figure within the city administration. He was unable to mediate between the two parties, as a result he submitted his resignation on 17 February 1906, along with Mayor J√°nos Halmos. On behalf of the General Assembly, he was farewelled by G√©za Pol√≥nyi (a member of the Second Wekerle cabinet one month later), who said M√°rkus \\"remained a constitutionalist and patriot even in difficult times, who chose the respect for constitution against the high and dignified office in a risky situation.\\" After his resignation, M√°rkus was granted Commander with Star of the Order of Franz Joseph by the eponymous monarch. Member of Parliament M√°rkus first appeared as an ordinary councillor in the General Assembly on 24 February 1906. When Francis Joseph intended to appoint a royal commissioner (Budapest Police Chief B√©la Rudnay) to lead the resistant city administration, M√°rkus argued that the monarch should also respect the Hungarian laws and constitutionalism. He proposed that the General Assembly should declare the appointment of Rudnay as unconstitutional and invalid. His proposal was accepted by the administrative body without changes. M√°rkus' funeral in March 1915 After his resignation, M√°rkus did not retire, but entered politics at national level. He ran as a candidate of the National Constitution Party to represent Erzs√©betv√°ros (today 7th district of Budapest) in the 1906 parliamentary election, but did not obtain a mandate, defeated by B√©la Barab√°s, an influential member of the Party of Independence and '48. Nevertheless M√°rkus was elected Member of Parliament for Erzs√©betv√°ros four years later in the 1910 parliamentary election, defeating incumbent MP K√°roly E√∂tv√∂s and industrialist M√≥r L√°nyi. M√°rkus joined the National Party of Work parliamentary group. He was appointed a member of the Committee of Public Administration and the Financial Committee at the inaugural session of the House of Representatives. J√≥zsef M√°rkus made his last public appearance on 17 November 1913. He died on 11 March 1915 after a lengthy illness at the Pajor Sanatorium in Budapest. His coffin was laid in repose in the St. Elizabeth Church of Erzs√©betv√°ros, before being transferred by a solemn funeral procession to the Kerepesi Cemetery. He was farewelled by then-mayor Istv√°n B√°rczy during the event. He said M√°rkus' \\"operation was permeated by a Hungarian democratic patriotic sentiment, a humanist liberal thought, and a versatile knowledge, which covered every field of urban management [...]\\".

He received his first piece of silverware in the First League of the Republika Srpska with FK Borac Banja Luka by winning the Republika Srpska Cup. His playing career came to a conclusion abroad in 2005 in the Canadian Professional Soccer League with Hamilton Thunder. After retiring from professional football he made the transition to the managerial side by managing in the Croatian Third Football League with his former club Dinara Knin in 2010. After a season in Croatia he returned to the CSL to manage the Brantford Galaxy, where in his first season he led the team to a CSL Championship. After a series of poor performances in 2011 he was relieved from his coaching duties. In 2011, SC Waterloo Region was granted a CSL franchise with D≈æepina holding several shares in the club, and was given the coaching responsibilities. He led Waterloo to their first and his second championship medal in 2013.  Playing career  D≈æepina began his career with his hometown club Dinara. In 1990, he signed with Rad of the First League of FR Yugoslavia, and played with FK Borac Banja Luka where he won the Republika Srpska Cup. In 2005, he went abroad to Canada to play with the Hamilton Thunder of the Canadian Professional Soccer League.  Managerial career  After his retirement from competitive football he managed NK Dinara in 2010. In 2010, he returned to Canada to manage expansion franchise Brantford Galaxy in the Canadian Soccer League. In preparation for the 2010 season, D≈æepina utilized the growing procession of European players to the CSL by recruiting their services. The acquisition of European imports played a pivotal role in Brantford's championship success in defeating Hamilton Croatia by a score of 3-0. The victory marked a historic milestone in CSL history as Brantford became the first expansion side to win the title in their debut season. The following season he continued in his capacity as head coach, and further strengthened his roster with additional imports from Europe. Unfortunately after a mediocre start to the season D≈æepina was dismissed from his post. In 2012, after the promotion of Kitchener Waterloo United FC to the CSL First Division the team was renamed to SC Waterloo Region with D≈æepina becoming a shareholder in the organization. He assumed the managerial duties of the club, and continued in his policy of European recruitment. In his first season with Waterloo he failed to secure the final postseason berth by two points. D≈æepina brought a double championship success to the Waterloo region in the 2013 season with the senior team defeating Kingston FC, while the reserve squad claimed the Second Division championship after defeating Toronto Croatia B.The victories placed D≈æepina in a class of distinction by becoming the second head coach in CSL history in acquiring more than one CSL Championship. His next significant season was in the 2015 season, where Waterloo reached the championship finals, but were defeated in the finals to Toronto Croatia.

February 1759, Schorndorf - 3 September 1827, Ludwigsburg) was a German portrait painter in the Classical style.  Biography Her father was a military feldsher and her mother was the daughter of a pharmacist. She was born in the barracks where her father was employed. In 1762, her family moved ro Ludwigsburg, where she grew up with Friedrich Schiller and his sisters.* Christophine, who was the first to recognize Friedrich's talent, became her life-long friend. Her family appreciated her artistic talent and made every effort to promote her career. The Ducal Academy in Ludwigsburg and the Hohe Karlsschule in Stuttgart would not admit women but, in 1776, a professor at the Karlsschule, Nicolas Guibal, agreed to give her private lessons. Portrait of Friedrich Schiller In 1787, with the financial support of Duke Carl Eugen and his mistress, Franziska von Hohenheim, she was able to travel to Paris and study with the miniaturist, Antoine Vestier. She remained for almost two years, then received a commission to paint portraits for Duke Friedrich Eugen, Carl's brother, in M√∂mpelgard (now Montb√©liard). These portraits were never completed, however, as she returned to Stuttgart in 1789 to marry Lieutenant Franz Simanowiz, an old classmate of Schiller's, who had been her fianc√© since 1786. Her letters from that time indicate that she missed Paris and, despite the unsettled conditions arising from the Revolution, she took the opportunity to return when her husband was called off on a troop deployment. Once there, she was able to stay with an old friend from Stuttgart, the opera singer, Helena Balletti, who had since married a marquis. In 1792, her situation became precarious when her hosts were subjected to searches by monarchist sympathizers and were forced to flee to the marquis' estate in Spain. Simanowiz remained behind, was interrogated, and denied a passport to go home. Early in 1793, her friend helped her escape to Normandy where she was given a passport. When she arrived in Strasbourg, she was seriously ill and spent six weeks in bed, tended by friends. Portrait of Charlotte Schiller When she finally got back to Ludwigsburg, she began by painting portraits of the Schiller family. Her portraits of Friedrich and his wife Charlotte were done while he was spending some time at home to work on Wallenstein. In 1798 her husband, now a Captain, was transferred to Stuttgart and she joined him there. The following year, he suffered a stroke that paralyzed his legs. She would be his nurse for the next twenty-eight years. In 1812, they returned to Ludwigsburg. Her eldest brother, Friedrich, was a pastor in nearby Erdmannhausen and they would often attend political meetings there to express solidarity with those who were fighting Napoleon. Franz died in June 1827 and she followed a few months later. She completed approximately 100 portraits (none signed), most of which are in private collections. There is a memorial to her in the Municipal Museum of Schorndorf. One of her nephews was the well-known scientist, Carl Reichenbach. References  Further reading  * Gertrud Fiege: Ludovike Simanowiz.

Servel was an American manufacturer of heating and cooling appliances, founded in 1922. Founded by Colonel William McCurdy to produce refrigerators and named National Electric Products Company, the company adapted and shortened the name \\"Servel\\" from their slogan, \\"Serving Electricity.\\" In 1925 the company bought American rights to a Swedish patent for a continuous absorption refrigerator and started to focus on the gas refrigeration market. The new model was available to consumers in 1926, and Servel quickly came to dominate the gas refrigerator market, its competition having all but disappeared within a few years. From 1927 until 1956, when it ceased producing them, it was the only American manufacturer of gas refrigerators. In 1939, Servel (then Electrolux-Servel) exhibited its residential gas air conditioner at the New York World's Fair. The exhibit, called \\"Magic Caves of Ice\\", was staged in the \\"Court of Flame\\", a building dedicated to promoting the gas industry. As the United States entered World War II, Servel shifted its manufacturing to support the war effort. In addition to cooking units and munitions, Servel built wings for the Republic P-47 Thunderbolt. By the end of the war, they'd produced over 6,000 pairs of wings for the US Air Force fighters. Starting in 1949, National Electric started receiving classified research and development contracts for the government, resulting in the production of rockets and guided missiles, JATO, and sustainer motor bodies for U.S. missiles and rockets, particularly the Nike family of guided missiles.Capabilities and Facilities: National Electric‚Äôs Contribution to The Rocket and Missile Program, Missiles and Rockets, November 10, 1958, v. 4, no. 19, p. 8.National Electric aims high (for the highest quality in the production of rocket motor bodies), Missiles and Rockets, November 29, 1965, v. 17, no. 22, p. 141.

In September 2016, he was found shot dead in a burning car. St. Louis County Police are investigating his death as a homicide; they have not publicly identified suspects or motives. Early life Seals grew up in Ferguson, Missouri, a few blocks from the apartment complex where police officer Darren Wilson shot and killed Michael Brown. Seals had known the Brown family since childhood. Activism Seals was active in Ferguson, Missouri, protests in the wake of the police shootings of Brown and Cary Ball Jr.,  with his commentary appearing in media outlets, per CNN, \\"as he continued to be outspoken about racial issues after the Brown protests subsided.\\" He co-founded Hands Up United, and The Washington Post described him as \\"among St. Louis‚Äôs most prominent anti-police brutality activists.\\" Seals had survived a shooting in 2013, and attributed his commitment to anti-gun violence activism to that experience. In 2014, he joined the Fannie Lou Hamer Coalition and helped rally a movement to vote against the Democratic candidate for St. Louis county executive, by backing white Republican candidate Rick Stream. The move in the highly Democratic African American community was an attempt, as The Washington Post described it, to \\"demonstrate that their votes should not be taken for granted.\\"He was an integral part of this effort. His leadership connected the community and politicians to move 22,000 Democratic votes to the Republican candidate. After voting for Barack Obama, Seals became a critic of what he saw as the President's insufficient action on many issues including police violence and racial profiling. In 2014, he joined the Fannie Lou Hamer Coalition and helped rally a movement to vote against the Democratic candidate for St. Louis county executive, by backing white Republican candidate Rick Stream. The move in the highly Democratic African American community was an attempt, as The Washington Post described it, to \\"demonstrate that their votes should not be taken for granted.\\"* Seals was a rapper in St. Louis group D.O.A.; in their song \\"Born Targets\\", Seals criticized police response to the Ferguson demonstrations. Seals was known as \\"King D Seals\\" on social media, and referred to himself as a ‚ÄúBusinessman, Revolutionary, Activist, Unapologetically BLACK, Afrikan in AmeriKKKa, Fighter, Leader\\". He was an outspoken critic of Black Lives Matter. He used Twitter as a public platform to call out the organization for taking in millions in donations from billionaire sponsor George Soros, and giving nothing back to the Ferguson community where they held protests against the police killing of Michael Brown. Seals' disapproval was founded in Ferguson's local activist sentiment that the organization hijacked their movement, publicizing it on social media as their own, motivated by personal, political, and financial benefit. Seals criticism was blunt: \\"The only thing #Deray #Netta or #BlackLivesMatter (the org) did in #Ferguson was tweet about our work and collect $\\". Death Seals was killed on September 6, 2016, in Riverview, a northern suburb of St. Louis. A homicide investigation revealed he was shot before he was placed in a car, that was later set on fire. Media outlets noted \\"the resemblance of Seals' death to the unsolved killing of Deandre Joshua,\\" another Ferguson resident who was also found shot in a burning car two years earlier, on the night of the announcement a grand jury had not indicted Wilson in Brown's death. Police report that while Joshua's case is still open and active, Seals' death has not been linked to it, but nor has a link been ruled out.

Based on the Marvel Comics organization S.H.I.E.L.D., it follows Phil Coulson and his fellow S.H.I.E.L.D. agents as they deal with the enhanced individuals Quake and Ghost Rider. It is set in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) and acknowledges the franchise's films. The episode was written by showrunners Jed Whedon and Maurissa Tancharoen, and directed by Billy Gierhart. Clark Gregg reprises his role as Coulson from the film series, starring alongside Ming-Na Wen, Chloe Bennet (Quake), Iain De Caestecker, Elizabeth Henstridge, Henry Simmons, and John Hannah. A fourth season was ordered in March 2016, with Gabriel Luna introduced as Ghost Rider, a character created through both practical and visual effects. He was included as part of the series exploring supernatural elements ahead of the release of the MCU film Doctor Strange (2016). Mallory Jansen and Lilli Birdsell are also introduced as recurring characters for the season. The episode begins the season's first \\"pod\\" of eight episodes, subtitled Ghost Rider. \\"The Ghost\\" originally aired on ABC on September 20, 2016, at the later time of 10:00pm which allowed it to be darker and more mature than previous seasons. The episode was watched by 6.24 million viewers within a week, and received mostly positive reviews due to its new status quo and the introduction of Ghost Rider. The opening scene received criticism for sexualizing Bennet.  Plot  Former S.H.I.E.L.D. agent Daisy Johnson, now the vigilante \\"Quake\\", is hunting gang affiliates of the anti-Inhuman terrorist group Watchdogs in Los Angeles when members of the Aryan Brotherhood are murdered by the fiery \\"Ghost Rider\\" in front of her. Agents Phil Coulson and Mack, who were forbidden from searching for Johnson by the new Director of S.H.I.E.L.D, are tipped off to her location by Agent Melinda May. They fly to Los Angeles under the guise of checking in on Inhuman asset Elena \\"Yo-Yo\\" Rodriguez, who has signed the controversial Sokovia Accords and is now under the jurisdiction of S.H.I.E.L.D. and the United Nations. Agent Leo Fitz visits friend and S.H.I.E.L.D. ally Holden Radcliffe, a transhumanist doctor who is on probation after previous illegal experimentation. Fitz discovers that Radcliffe has secretly transferred his artificial intelligence AIDA into a human-like body, which he intends to be the first in a line of decoys for field agents in danger. Believing Radcliffe's altruistic intentions, Fitz agrees to help him perfect Aida, and to keep her a secret from his girlfriend Agent Jemma Simmons, who is in the paranoid Director's inner circle, and takes daily lie-detector tests. Simmons realizes that Coulson and Mack are investigating Johnson, and orders May to stop them; May and her new strike force arrive to find Coulson and Mack surveilling Chinese gangsters, who they believe are potential targets of Quake. The gangsters have bought a weapon off the Brotherhood which can help them fight against Inhumans. They open the box containing the weapon, and unleash a mystical being who turns the gangsters berserk. She secretly infects May as well, as the strike force takes out the gangsters. Johnson meets with Rodriguez, who stole medication from S.H.I.E.L.D. during their brief check with her which can help Johnson heal‚Äîher recent over use of her Inhuman abilities as Quake has been fracturing her bones. Johnson then tracks down the Ghost Rider and confronts it, but it defeats her, explaining that it only murders people that deserve to die. She thinks this should include her, but it refuses to kill her. She later sees the Ghost Rider's human form, Robbie Reyes, looking after his disabled brother Gabe.  Production  = Development = The series was renewed for a fourth season on March 3, 2016, to air at the later time of 10:00pm. At the 2016 San Diego Comic-Con it was revealed that the series would be adapting the character of Robbie Reyes / Ghost Rider. In September 2016, Marvel announced that the premiere episode of the season would be titled \\"The Ghost\\". The episode is written by executive producers Jed Whedon and Maurissa Tancharoen, with Billy Gierhart directing. It serves as the beginning of the season's Ghost Rider \\"pod\\" of episodes, which consists of the first eight episodes. \\"The Ghost\\" also introduces a new title card for the series. = Writing = On how much more \\"mature\\" the episode is from previous episodes given the later air time, Whedon explained that ABC \\"haven't really ever given us a note on violence. We've cut people into pieces and hacked them up and shot people point blank in the head. Never got any notes on that. So pushing the envelope for us will be in the sexual nature\\". This is evidenced by the episode's opening, a \\"sexy\\" look at the character Quake getting dressed. Executive producer Jeph Loeb added, \\"what it does is give us the chance to tell different stories. The idea is some of the material might be more mature, there may be more grit, what we're doing might be darker. It certainly made a lot more sense when we wanted to introduce a character like Ghost Rider into this world.\\" Discussing Quake's mindset when the episode picks up, actress Chloe Bennet said, \\"She's not doing well. She's had a rough couple of years. She's taking some time and I think it's kind of her way of protecting the people that she cares about. Everyone she's gotten close to, something bad has happened to them. It's her weird, selfish way of protecting them\\". This, the character's assertion in the episode to Ghost Rider that she \\"deserves to die\\". Concerning the character Fitz keeping the android Aida a secret from his girlfriend Simmons, actor Iain De Caestecker said, \\"They're trying to maintain a healthy relationship while being secret undercover spies that have secret assignments ... it's with the best intentions, keeping stuff from her, I suppose. It's going to get interesting. Lying is a strong word. I'm just keeping stuff from\\" her. = Casting = In August 2016, Marvel confirmed that series regulars for the season would include the returning Clark Gregg as Phil Coulson, Ming-Na Wen as Melinda May, Bennet as Daisy Johnson / Quake, De Caestecker as Leo Fitz, Elizabeth Henstridge as Jemma Simmons, and Henry Simmons as Alphonso \\"Mack\\" MacKenzie. They are joined by John Hannah as Holden Radcliffe, promoted from his third season recurring role. When Ghost Rider was confirmed to be joining the season at Comic-Con, after months of speculation, Gabriel Luna was revealed to be cast in the role. Lorenzo James Henrie was later revealed to be cast as his younger brother Gabe Reyes. Shortly after Comic-Con, Lilli Birdsell was revealed to be cast as the mysterious Lucy. In August, Mallory Jansen was cast as the android Aida, whose artificial intelligence was briefly voiced by Amanda Rea during the third-season finale. In September 2016, Marvel confirmed that Luna, Henrie, Jansen, and Birdsell would guest star in \\"The Ghost\\", and that they would be joined by Natalia Cordova-Buckley as Elena \\"Yo-Yo\\" Rodriguez, Briana Venskus as Agent Piper, Max Osinski as Agent Red, Ricardo Walker as Agent Prince, Edward Gelhaus as skinhead, Ian Hutton as Blondie, Blaise Miller as lab tech, Samuel Barajas as Felix, Bryan Rasmussen as warehouse manager, Wilson Ramirez as Diego, Jen Kuo Sung as Chen, and Jerry Ying as thug #1. Cordova-Buckley, Venskus, and Osinski reprise their roles from earlier in the series. The thugs introduced as Ghost Rider's victims in the episode's cold open were intended to immediately come across as Nazi-like characters, to imply to the audience that they deserved to be killed by the Ghost Rider. = Filming and visual effects = Production for the season began on July 21, 2016, in Los Angeles. Filming for \\"The Ghost\\" was completed by August 16. The episode's cold open was filmed at Mariachi Plaza over four nights, and introduces Ghost Rider in a recreation of Robbie Reyes' comic introduction: his car, a 1969 Dodge Charger, is hit by a rocket, flips in the air, and lands with its Ghost Rider flames on driving towards some gang members. A CG double of the car was used for several shots in this sequence, while stunt driver Eric Norris drove the physical stunt car, and a third version was used for \\"beauty\\" shots. The effect of Ghost Rider and his flaming skull was imitated on set by Luna wearing a hood fitted with flickering lights that could be adjusted to match different temperature fire for different situations. The skull was then produced using CGI, with Luna wearing tracking markers on his face to provide performance-reference for these sequences. Flames were also produced digitally. = Marvel Cinematic Universe tie-ins = On the mystical weapon released from the box in the episode, Whedon said, \\"We are introducing a different supernatural element of the MCU, which happens to coincide with the release of Doctor Strange. So that's what's in the box ... something along those lines.\\" On how it will affect May now that she is infected by it, Wen said, \\"You never want May out of control. You don't want her to be paranoid.\\" Whedon added, \\"You can assume that what happened to those other people might happen to her. It's not good.\\"  Marketing  Promotion for the season and its premiere focused heavily on Ghost Rider, through promos and viral marketing teasers, with the season promoted as Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.: Ghost Rider; this was later revealed to be the subtitle for the first \\"pod\\" of episodes for the season. The premiere episode was first shown, before its ABC airing, at a special fan screening event held for the season on September 19, 2016, at Pacific Theatres at The Grove in Los Angeles.  Release  \\"The Ghost\\" was first aired in the United States on ABC on September 20, 2016. It began streaming on Netflix, along with the rest of the fourth season, on June 15, 2017.  Reception  = Ratings = In the United States the episode received a 1.1/4 percent share among adults between the ages of 18 and 49, meaning that it was seen by 1.1 percent of all households, and 4 percent of all of those watching television at the time of the broadcast. It was watched by 3.44 million viewers. This was down from previous season premieres, but average for the series. Within a week of its release, \\"The Ghost\\" had been watched by 6.24 million U.S. viewers, above the season average of 4.22 million. = Reception = Terri Schwartz of IGN scored the premiere 8 out of 10, indicating a \\"great\\" episode, and praising the introduction of Ghost Rider and subsequent darker tone which \\"will eventually allow [the series] to sit more comfortably beside its corporate cousins over on Netflix\\". Schwartz was positive about the smaller cast compared to the previous season, which meant that the episode \\"doesn't feel as overstuffed as it would have\\", and of Coulson not finding Johnson and asking her to return to S.H.I.E.L.D. straight away after the newly established status quo. Schwartz did feel that there were some \\"growing pains\\" with the transition to more mature material, particularly criticizing the \\"sexy\\" opening of the episode with Johnson because \\"S.H.I.E.L.D. has already done a great job establishing Daisy as a sexy character without needing to depict it in this unsubtle way. Hopefully the inclusion of more overt sexuality in the show feels a bit more organic to the show as it continues\\". The A.V. Clubs Alex McCown-Levy graded the episode a \\"B\\", calling it \\"a standard first episode back, in that it once again does a lot of table-setting, and not always in the most compelling manner\\". Levy felt that Ghost Rider's introduction was handled well for non-comic fans discovering the character with the show, but that the new positions of the series' main characters were more interesting and should have been focused on more. Kevin Fitzpatrick of Screen Crush said, \\"I'm nervous for Season 4 overall, especially if said reinvention doesn't goose the ratings like Marvel and ABC hope, but 'The Ghost' is reason enough for some casual optimism.\\" He was positive about the new similarities to the darker series Daredevil, but felt that the series \\"doesn‚Äôt have the firmest handle\\" on Ghost Rider, either \\"who Reyes himself is in relation to his murderous alter-ego\\", or in the blend of practical and digital effects‚Äî\\"the finished product isn't seamless just yet\\". He said, \\"The junkyard battle with Daisy [and Ghost Rider] was an understandable highlight\\", and praised the episode's smaller character moments like \\"the moment of Daisy feeling as though she deserves to lose her life in battle, only for the Rider to silently disagree.\\" Rob Leane at Den of Geek compared the series' new status quo to Red Dwarf VIII and called it and many of the season's storylines being set up as \\"pretty strong\\", but \\"nothing grabbed [his] attention\\" like the introduction of Ghost Rider, which Leane felt was \\"a complete slam-dunk\\". He praised the effects for Ghost Rider and his car, and Luna's performance. Evan Valentine, writing for Collider, gave the episode a \\"good\\" rating of 3 stars out of 5, saying that the series \\"certainly benefits somewhat from taking a page from\\" Daredevil and Jessica Jones, highlighting the number of more mature elements in the episode's opening as \\"a nice introduction that shows you this may not exactly be the same show you‚Äôve gotten to know over the years.\\" Valentine called Robbie Reyes \\"satisfactory\\" and the Ghost Rider \\"where things really shined\\"; \\"ABC pretty much nail the look [of Ghost Rider], and while he's obviously been tweaked to more accurately portray this new interpretation of the Spirit of Vengeance, he looks great in motion all the same ... his car has a particularly cool scene where it transforms mid air and lands in a fiery blast.\\" He called the Ghost Rider/Quake fight a highlight, and the latter's health issues \\"an interesting twist\\". He concluded saying, \\"the show still has all the flaws and strengths that [it] is known for ... [but] if you're looking to rejoin your favorite agents for another solid romp with the added twist of throwing Ghost Rider into the mix, this one's for you.\\" Marc Buxton, also of Den of Geek, gave the episode 3.5 stars out of 5, calling it \\"a fun way to kick off the new season\\". He criticized the Ghost Rider transformation scene as \\"way too CGI cartoony\\" and negatively compared it to Grimm, but otherwise said that \\"Ghost Rider feels right\\" and much improved over the Nicolas Cage Ghost Rider films. He also criticized the opening shots of Johnson, calling them \\"misogynistic\\" and saying, \\"Seriously Marvel, you‚Äôre better than that.\\" In December 2016, Comic Book Resources named \\"The Ghost\\" as the 15th best episode of the year among comic book-related television series.

It is located near the Petworth and Park View neighborhoods of Washington, D.C.. President Lincoln's Cottage was formerly known as Anderson Cottage. President Abraham Lincoln and family resided seasonally on the grounds of the Soldiers' Home to escape the heat and political pressure of downtown Washington, as did President James Buchanan (1857‚Äì1861) before him. President Lincoln's Cottage also served as the Summer White House for Presidents Rutherford B. Hayes (1877‚Äì1881) and Chester A. Arthur (1881‚Äì1885).The Armed Forces Retirement Home: the history-and future-of caring for our veterans. - Free Online Library History The historic Cottage, built in the Gothic revival style, was constructed from 1842 to 1843 as the home of George Washington Riggs, who went on to establish the Riggs National Bank in Washington, D.C. Lincoln lived in the cottage June to November 1862 through 1864 and during the first summer living there, Lincoln drafted the preliminary draft of the Emancipation Proclamation. Mary Todd Lincoln fondly recalled the campus; in 1865, she wrote, \\"How dearly I loved the Soldiers' Home.\\" Poet Walt Whitman, who was living on Vermont Avenue near the White House in 1863, often saw the president riding to or from Soldiers' Home. He wrote in The New York Times, \\"Mr. LINCOLN generally rides a good-sized easy-going gray horse, is dressed in plain black, somewhat rusty and dusty; wears a black stiff hat, and looks about as ordinary in attire, &c.;, as the commonest man...I saw very plainly the President's dark brown face, with the deep cut lines, the eyes, &c.;, always to me with a deep latent sadness in the expression.\\" Whitman quoted this article in his 1876 book Memoranda During the War, adding the phrase: \\"We have got so that we always exchange bows, and very cordial ones.\\" Lincoln Cottage, February 1975 The Soldiers' Home stands on atop the third highest point in Washington. The Home was designated a National Historic Landmark on November 7, 1973, and listed on the National Register of Historic Places on February 11, 1974. In 2000, the cottage was placed on the National Trust for Historic Preservation's 11 Most Endangered list. Then about 2.3 acres (9,300 m2) of the Home was proclaimed a National Monument by President Bill Clinton on July 7, 2000. The National Trust took on the restoration which was completed in 2007. The Cottage exterior was restored to the period of Lincoln's occupancy in the 1860s in a joint venture by the Philadelphia firm J. S. Cornell & Son, and Stephen Ortado, Historic Structures, according to the standards of the National Park Service. Today the property is leased by the National Trust for Historic Preservation through a cooperative agreement with the Armed Forces Retirement Home; and is managed by President Lincoln's Cottage at the Soldiers' Home, an independent 501(c)(3) charity. President Lincoln's Cottage opened to the public on February 18, 2008. A reproduction of the Lincoln desk on which he wrote the Emancipation Proclamation was commissioned by the Trust for use in the Cottage. The original drop-lid walnut paneled desk is in the Lincoln Bedroom of the White House. The desk is the only surviving piece of furniture that is known to have been placed in the White House and the Cottage during the Lincoln era. The adjacent Robert H.

The lake sits at an elevation of and flows out south to the ocean via a creek. Bass Lake is the largest of the five Coast Trail Lakes, which also include Pelican Lake, Crystal Lake, Ocean Lake and Wildcat Lake. Geology Much like the other nearby lakes in the southeast portion of the Point Reyes peninsula, Bass Lake occupies a natural synclinal depression formed behind blocks of rock displaced by landslides within the past 10,000 years. The depressions forming Crystal, Pelican and Bass lakes appear to have been caused by the Double Point Slide, which covers an area of about . The rocks involved in the landslide are shale, chert and sandstone, some similar to Miocene rocks of the Monterey Formation and others to Pliocene rocks from the Central Coast Ranges. The process that caused these slides is ongoing, with several nearby slides caused by the 1906 San Francisco earthquake and others happening as recently as 1956. Ecology The lake is within the Southern Inverness Ridge region of the Point Reyes National Seashore, in an area of coastal scrub and grassland. In this coastal zone there are open stands of coyote brush (Baccharis pilularis), often with native grasses such as California oatgrass (Danthonia californica) and purple needlegrass (Nassella pulchra). The other dominant plants in this ecosystem are California sage brush (Artemisia californica), black sage (Salvia mellifera), sticky monkeyflower (Mimulus guttatus), poison oak (Toxicodendron diversilobum), California coffeeberry (Frangula californica) and tree lupine (Lupinus arboreus). Around Bass Lake and the neighboring lakes are thick growths of willow (Salix sp.) In the lake margins there is common tule (Schoenoplectus acutus), California bulrush (Schoenoplectus californicus), cat-tail (Typha latifolia) and sedges (Carex sp. including Carex senta). The lake has been stocked with warm-water game fish. Research in 1976 found that the lake supported a range of phytoplankton from the genera Anabaena, Cryptomonas, Cymbella, Fragilaria, Oocystis, Schroederia, Sphaerocystis and Staurastrum, as well as the species Ceratium hirundinella, Elakatothrix gelatinosa and Pseudokephrion conicum. On the slopes above the coastal lakes, the flora is characterized by stands of Douglas fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii). Bass Lake is inland from the Double Point Area of Special Biological Significance, established in 1974 primarily to protect the large population of harbor seals (Phoca vitulina) that raise pups on the beach between April and June each year. History Prior to geological research in the 1960s that revealed the many pre-historic landslides, the area was considered to be sufficiently stable for the U.S. Army to construct an underground artillery control facility within the North Point headland directly west of Pelican Lake in 1944. These concrete structures were filled in by the National Park Service after it assumed control of the area, but they could be exposed by future landslides. The barracks for this facility were located near Bass Lake.

France has moderate animal welfare protections by international standards.  Legislation  France passed its first animal protection law in 1850, though this law prohibited only public cruelty towards animals. In 1959 France issued a decree incriminating the mistreatment of domestic or captive animals. In 1976, France passed an animal welfare law which recognizes the sentience of domestic animals (making it one of the first countries to recognize animal sentience) and requires that alternatives to animal testing be used where it is deemed possible. France's main regulations on animal cruelty fall under the Penal Code and the Rural and Maritime Fishing Code, which protect domesticated, tamed, and captive animals. The Penal Code makes it an offense to seriously physically abuse or sexually abuse, commit and act of cruelty towards, or abandon a domesticated, tamed, or captive animal. Bullfighting and cockfighting are exempt from this provision where an \\"uninterrupted local tradition\\" can be invoked. The Rural and Maritime Fishing Code gives more detail on what constitutes cruelty. Force- feeding geese and ducks to produce foie gras is exempted from anti-cruelty legislation, and law requires that product labelled as foie gras must come from force-fed animals. And, as these statutes apply only to domestic, tamed, and captive animals, there are no basic criminal sanctions for cruelty towards wild animals. France's farmed animal protections comply with the minimum standards set by the European Union (EU). As for animals used in research, the Rural and Maritime Fishing Code sets out licensing and welfare requirements, founded on The Three Rs: reduce the number of animals used, refine methods to cause less suffering, and replace animals where it is deemed scientifically appropriate. In 2005, the French government resisted the EU's ban on testing cosmetics on animals, taking its case to the European Court of Justice, where it was defeated. In 2014 and again in 2020, France received a C out of possible grades A, B, C, D, E, F, G on World Animal Protection's Animal Protection Index. In 2015, the French parliament amended the French Civil Code to change the classification of non-human animals from \\"moveable property\\" to \\"living beings gifted sentience\\". However, the law does not specify what protections, if any, animals have as \\"living beings gifted with sentience\\", so it is unclear whether this will lead to changes in animal welfare policy.  Animal issues  = Animals used for food =  Animal agriculture  Animals raised and killed for food in France each year include: *13.3 million pigs (herd size) (2014) *19.25 million bovine animals (herd size) (2014), the highest in the EU *7.17 million sheep (herd size) (2014) *0.94 million goats (herd size) (2014) *745 million chickens (total killed) (2014) *76 million ducks (total killed) (2014) *46 million turkeys (total killed) (2014) *51.3 million egg-laying hens (herd size) (2010) *205,000 tons of aquaculture animals (2012) *529,000 tons of wild-caught marine animals (2013) France is the EU's largest egg producer. In late 2011, French animal activists obtained images from several farms of egg-laying hens on in barren battery cages, despite the fact that EU rules require larger \\"enriched\\" cages. On one farm, five birds on average were in cages designed for three. The group monitored the birds over time, finding that many lost their feathers and had their beaks trimmed, and that dead hens were left in cages. France is a major producer of the highly controversial delicacy foie gras, which involves enlarging the livers of geese and ducks by force-feeding them for several weeks. Several European countries, including Britain, Norway, Sweden, Germany, and Switzerland, and well as the American state of California have banned foie gras production. In a 2014 survey by a French animal protection group, 47% of respondents said they would support a ban on force-feeding. In 2016, French animal activist group L214 released undercover video of an \\"organic\\" French slaughterhouse in which animals are seen to be tortured by slaughterhouse staff and slaughtered while still conscious. The video prompted authorities to close the slaughterhouse for two months.  Veganism  Figures on the number of vegans in France are not readily available, though surveys have estimated that roughly 1.5-2% of French identify as vegetarian. A 2011 decree by the French government effectively outlawed the serving of vegan meals at French schools, and similar decrees have been proposed for kindergartens, hospitals, prisons, and retirement homes.Renato Pichler \\"The French Government Outlaws Vegetarianism in Schools\\" , European Vegetarian Union (EVU), 14 October 2011. *Also see \\"The French Government Outlaws Vegetarianism in Schools\\", European Vegetarian and Animal News Alliance (EVANA). *\\"Having Banned the Burqa, French Now Ban Les Veggies\\" , Vegetarians' International Voice for Animals (Viva!), 19 October 2011 = Animals used for research = According to the EU's latest statistical report on animal testing, French researchers performed tests on roughly 2.2 million animals in 2011, the most of any EU country. = Animals used for clothing = Fur farming is legal in France. There are dozens of fur farms in France, where mink, rabbits, and other animals are raised. In 2013 a proposal to ban new farms was formulated by a member of parliament, but no such proposal has been passed as of 2016.  Animal activism  L214 is a French animal activist group founded in 2008 which focuses on animals used for food, given the fact that they account for the vast majority of animals used by humans. Their activities involve informational outreach about the conditions of animals on farms, undercover investigations of animal use operations, promoting veganism, and \\"rais[ing] the question of speciesism\\". The organization's namesake is the article of the 1976 French rural code which first recognized animals as sentient beings. One Voice is another major animal protection group active in France, founded in 1998. Their activities include campaigns against animal experimentation, fur farming, bullfighting, animal abuse in circuses, and for the welfare of farm animals and whales and dolphins.

The book was published in four volumes, beginning with Boyhood in 1906, Apprenticeship in 1907, The Great Struggle in 1909 and concluding with Daybreak in 1910. The novel follows the character Pelle Karlsson, who immigrates to Denmark from Sweden in 1877 at age eight. At 18, he moves from Bornholm to Copenhagen, and becomes a leader in the labour movement in Denmark, motivated by poor working conditions. Analysis Nex√∏ based the novel on many of the experiences in his own life. While written as a biography of a fictional character, Pelle the Conqueror reports on widespread economic and historic social matters. The format is of a Bildungsroman. The novel was translated into English by Jesse Muir and Bernard Miall in 1913‚Äì1916. Despite this, it is not a popular novel in the English-speaking world. Pelle the Conqueror has been compared to Les Mis√©rables. Adaptations In 1987, a Danish‚ÄìSwedish film adaptation directed by Bille August was released. August chose to adapt the novel because it is considered essential reading in Denmark. It starred Pelle Hvenegaard as the young Pelle and Max von Sydow, and won the Palme d'Or at the 1988 Cannes Film Festival, the 1988 Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film and numerous other awards. In 2017, HBO Nordic and SAM Productions announced they were producing an eight-hour miniseries The Conqueror, written by Rasmus Heisterberg and based on Nex√∏'s Apprenticeship, The Great Struggle and Daybreak.

In 1997 he joined the ISME Board and was the first elected President in 1999, serving from 2001 to 2003.

Drummond‚Äôs academic publications include Opera in Perspective (1980, J.M.Dent and Sons Ltd and the University of Minnesota Press), and many articles in music education publications. He is known for sharing provocative ideas. His series of broadcasts for Radio New Zealand in 1988 entitled Planetary Airs proposed that the pathway in contemporary music pioneered by Arnold Schoenberg and his disciples was an unimportant byway (a view now widely shared), while his May 2010 article in the International Journal for Music Education proposed that Western Art Music should be renamed Northwest Asian Court Music.
