Formed in mid-1861, the regiment was assigned to the command of Brigadier General Nicholas Bartlett Pearce, commander, 1st Division, Provisional Army of Arkansas. It was disbanded after the Battle of Wilson's Creek in August 1861. Another Arkansas unit also had the designation 5th Arkansas, the 5th Arkansas Infantry Regiment which belonged to the Confederate Army of Tennessee. There is no connection between the two units.  Organization  In the spring of 1861, as the secession crisis deepened, many additional volunteer companies were being formed in the Arkansas State Militia. The Militia Law of Arkansas as published in 1860 provided for a two-tiered militia system.Militia Law Of The State Of Arkansas; Published By Direction Of The Commander-In-Chief Of The Army Of The State Of Arkansas, And Of The Militia Thereof, Page 6, Accessed January 8, 2010, https://books.google.com/books?id=3lFKAAAAMAAJ&pg;=RA4-PA6#v=onepage&q;=militia&f;=false ; See Also, Acts Passed at the Fourths Session of the General Assembly of the State of Arkansas, An act for the better organization of the Militia of this State, page 149, accessed January 8, 2010, https://books.google.com/books?id=48c3AAAAIAAJ&dq;=Acts%20of%20Arkansas%201843%20General%20Assembly&pg;=PR1#v=onepage&q;=Acts%20of%20Arkansas%201843%20General%20Assembly&f;=false , See Also, Revised statutes of the State of Arkansas: adopted at the October session of the General Assembly of said State, A.D. 1837, Page 543, accessed December 10, 2010, https://books.google.com/books?id=ohxEAAAAYAAJ&dq;=acts%20General%20Assembly%20Arkansas%20militia&pg;=PA543#v=onepage&q;&f;=false Section one of the law made all able-bodied free white male inhabitants between the ages of 18 and 45 liable for service. Section 57 of the Militia Act established the second tier of militia organization, the volunteer company. The act allowed each county to raise up to four volunteer companies. These volunteer companies were to be either infantry, riflemen, cavalry, or artillery. While the volunteer companies were to be separate from the regular militia units, they remained under the supervision and authority of the local militia regimental commander, who was required to set the time and place of the election of officers for volunteer companies and certify their election to the governor.Militia Law Of The State Of Arkansas; Published By Direction Of The Commander-In-Chief Of The Army Of The State Of Arkansas, And Of The Militia Thereof, Page 27, Accessed January 8, 2010, https://books.google.com/books?id=3lFKAAAAMAAJ&pg;=RA4-PA27#v=onepage&q;=mlitia&f;=false Volunteer Companies were allowed to select and acquire their own uniforms and their officers were authorized to wear the uniform of the company. While the standard militia units were organized into lettered companies organized roughly along township boundaries, volunteer companies usually adopted colorful names to set them apart. One example of the volunteer militia company is the \\"\\"Bell Point Guards\\", which would eventually become Company G of the 5th Regiment, Arkansas State Troops. The unit was originally organized on July 10, 1860, in the 51st Regiment, Arkansas State Militia, of Sebastian County. The unit was composed primarily of German immigrants from Sebastian County. In a letter \\"To The Militiamen Of The State Of Arkansas\\" dated August 27, 1860, Governor Conway exhorted the raising of additional volunteer companies:Arkansas public documents: 1854‚Äì60, page 58, accessed Jan 8, 2010, https://books.google.com/books?id=3lFKAAAAMAAJ&pg;=RA2-PA59#v=onepage&q;&f;=false He commented that if all the volunteer companies authorized by the act were to be raised, the state would have a force of 22,000 volunteers.Arkansas public documents: 1854‚Äì60, page 60, accessed Jan 8, 2010, https://books.google.com/books?id=3lFKAAAAMAAJ&pg;=RA2-PA59#v=onepage&q;&f;=false Although several volunteer companies were already in existence at various locations around the state, the Governor's call sparked a wave of formations. State newspapers in the summer and fall of 1860 contain several stories of volunteer companies being formed, drilling, and participating in the regular muster of the militia regiments. The leaders of these volunteer companies began to search for uniforms and equipment, often requesting them through militia channels to the Governor, but then turning to private sources when the State Government was unable to help. The state legislature responded to the need for arms and equipment in January 1861 by appropriating $100,000 for the arming and equipping of the militia being formed into volunteer companies. Act Number 192, which was approved on January 21, 1861, appropriated money \\"for the purpose of arming the volunteer militia of this state, when formed into volunteer military companies...\\"Acts of Arkansas, 1860‚Äì1861, page 368, accessed December 10, 2010. https://books.google.com/books?id=5cU3AAAAIAAJ&dq;=ACT%20Arkansas%20General%20Assembly%20volunteer%20Company%20militia%20Arkansas%201861&pg;=PA368#v=onepage&q;&f;=false In the beginning, these volunteer militia companies continued to operate under the authority of the local militia commander, with the local regimental commander overseeing the election of officers and forwarding the election results to the Governor. After the state actually seceded in May 1861, new volunteer companies would be organized under the authority of the State Military Board, and began to be organized into volunteer regiments which would be referred to as the Arkansas State Troops. The Star Company of Sevier County and the Davis Blues of Hempstead County are examples of these volunteer companies organized under the militia laws in southwest Arkansas. The Stars formed in April, the Blues were organized at Nashville, Arkansas, on June 18, 1861. On the following day, June 19, the Nashville community hosted the Davis Blues to a going away gathering, together with a barbecue dinner and other gifts of clothing and such. The Honorable Charles B. Mitchel of nearby Washington, Arkansas, former U. S. Senator, now a Confederate Senator from Arkansas, spoke at the gathering. That afternoon the Blues, under the command of Captain Joseph L. Neal, left for Little Rock, arriving about June 23. The unit soon moved to Camp Walker, in Benton County, and were mustered into the 5th Regiment, Arkansas State Troops as Company F for the period of 90 days. The Sevier Stars, under of Captain John G. McKean, apparently marched north from Sevier Co. to Camp Walker after this and were mustered into the 5th Regiment, Arkansas State Troops as Company H. Following democratic guidelines, an election of officers was held, in which Thomas P. Dockery was selected to command this new regiment with Captain Joseph L. Neal as the lieutenant colonel. In the Davis Blues, Augusta S. Hutchinson, a man of strong military training was elected to replace Lieutenant Colonel Neal.Pence, Theo Merrill. 19th Arkansas Infantry Regiment, CSA (Dawson's).

The Provisional Army was to consist of two divisions, the 1st Division in the western part of the state was to be commanded by Brigadier General Pearce, and the 2nd Division in the eastern half of the state, commanded by Major General James Yell. The intent of the Secession Convention was to transfer these state troop regiments into Confederate service as quickly as possible, to avoid the cost of paying for a large state army. The troops of the eastern division were transferred to the command of Brigadier General William J. Hardee in July 1861, but the troops of the western division under Brigadier General Pearce were not transferred to Confederate service before they became engaged in the Battle of Wilson's Creek.

The regiment's designation as the 5th Regiment, Arkansas State Troops is something of an enigma. While the unit was designated as the 5th Regiment by General Pearce, the regiment was not mentioned as an authorized State regiment in the Articles of Transfer of Arkansas Volunteers to the Confederate States, dated July 15, 1861. The State Military Board had already assigned the 5th Regiment designation to the regiment of Cololonel David C. Cross in the Eastern Division of the Army of Arkansas.Howerton, Bryan R. \\"Re: State Troops\\" Arkansas in the Civil War Message Board, Posted 23 January 2011, Accessed 23 July 2012, http://history-sites.com/cgi- bin/bbs53x/arcwmb/webbbs_config.pl?read=23112  Battles  Colonel Dockery soon ran into problems with his new command. Apparently in response to a private being slow in obeying a command, Colonel Dockery picked up a nearby musket and stuck the soldier with the bayonet. All the company commanders in the regiment protested this, and threatened to return home if Colonel Dockery was not removed from command. Dockery relinquished command of the regiment temporarily to Lieutenant Colonel Neal at this time. The 5th Regiment, accompanying other Arkansas troops marched north from Camp Walker to join the Confederate forces in Missouri.Pence, Theo Merrill. 19th Arkansas Infantry Regiment, CSA (Dawson's).

Gen. Nathaniel Lyon's Union Troops had been active in scouting the area during this period, being involved in a few skirmishes. Orders for an attack by the Confederates on Springfield on August 9 were cancelled because of rain. Union General Nathaniel Lyons, however, marched that night toward the Confederate camp, halting about 1 P. M., when the Confederate campfires were spotted. Part of his command under Colonel Franz Sigel, had been sent to circle the southern camps and attack from the southeast. Sigel was to attack when he heard Lyons cannons firing. At daylight, Lyons advanced and soon the firing was general. Many of the Arkansas State Troops were having breakfast when they heard the opening salvo's as Totten's Union artillery and Woodruff's Pulaski Light Artillery became engaged in a duel. General Price became heavily involved against Lyons, while General McCulloch and Pearce dealt with Sigel, after which McCulloch joined Price. The 5th regiment for the first 2 hours was sent to the right in support of Reid's Battery, from which position they assisted in the capture of Sigel's artillery. Most of the action was on the left, where the 3rd Regiment, Arkansas State Troops and the 3rd Louisiana were being supported by Woodruff's Battery. Later, General Pearce led a force including six companies of the 5th Regiment being led by Lieutenant Colonel Neal, to assist the 3rd Arkansas. Lieutenant Colonel Neal was mortally wounded in this action, Colonel Dockery resumed command of the regiment. The four remaining companies of the 5th Regiment, including McKean's and Hutchinson's, continued to guard Reid's Battery until Reid was moved later in the morning, at which time they were sent out as skirmishers. Colonel Thomas P. Dockery, filled the following report of the part the 5th Regiment, Arkansas State Troops played at the Battle of Wilson's Creek, Missouri, on August 10, 1861. Three men from the 5th Regiment were killed and 11 were wounded, but with the exception of Lieutenant Colonel Neal, their names have not been found. The battle raged for 6 and 1/2 hours, resulting in the death of Union General Lyons, after which the Union Forces withdrew to Springfield.  Disbanded  Following the Battle of Wilson's Creek, the regiment, along with the rest of the Arkansas State Troops marched back to Arkansas and given the opportunity to vote on the issue of being transferred into confederate service following the battle. The regiment, along with the rest of the 1st Division voted to disband rather than be transferred to Confederate service. Many veterans of the regiments joined other Confederate units later in the war. Colonel Thomas P. Dockery would eventually be elected to the Colonelcy of the 19th Arkansas Infantry Regiment.Howerton, Bryan, \\"19th Arkansas Regiment, No. 2\\", Arkansas in the Civil War Message Board, Posted 26 July 2011, http://history- sites.com/cgi-bin/bbs53x/arcwmb/webbbs_config.pl?noframes;read=14811 Many members of the Sevier Stars later joined Company F of the \\"other 19th Arkansas\\", Dawson's 19th Arkansas Infantry.

Sovey as Matrons of Honor and Ruth Burgwald serving as flower girlOregon Journal June 19, 1944 final edition.), Quinault Victory was delivered to the War Shipping Administration and subsequently leased to the United States Lines Company. Port Chicago, California On July 11, 1944 Quinault Victory sailed from Portland, under the command of Merchant Marine Captain Robert J. Sullivan arriving at the Shell Oil Company's Martinez, California refinery on July 17, 1944 where she took on a partial load of fuel oil. Some of the oil taken aboard was of a type that released light hydrocarbon gas on agitation, heating, or standing. This could have resulted in formation of an explosive mixture in the confined air space above the oil in the tanks. Prior to being sent to Martinez for a pre-loading inspection was made by the Port Director's officers and the Captain of the Port's office, and no defects were noted.Graphic reconstruction of the pier, boxcars and ships at Port Chicago just prior to explosion, with estimates of type and weight of cargoUpon leaving Martinez she sailed up Suisun Bay to Port Chicago Naval Magazine, California arriving approximately 6:00 PM (Pacific War Time) in preparation for her maiden voyage. Some difficulty was experienced in mooring her due to winds and tides. She was moored on the starboard side headed east at the outboard berth across from the SS E.A. Bryan, a Liberty ship. Upon arrival at Port Chicago, California both the loading officer and his assistants visited the ship, gave copies of pertinent magazine orders to the master, inspected some of the holds and saw that the ship was being properly rigged for loading. The number 5 cargo hold was not being rigged, as it was not to be loaded that night. As a new ship, this was the first time the Quinault Victory had been rigged for loading. Trouble was experienced with shackles and preventer guys as they were non-standard. Winding on some of the winches were on backwards and had to be corrected. Loading normally have started at midnight. Dunnage ammunition and loaded railcars were parked on the pier for loading to the ships. The railcars slated for Quinault Victory contained 253 tons of bombs and 5 inch projectiles for 5\\"/25 caliber guns. Across the pier the E.A. Bryan was already loaded with 6,064 tons of ammunition and had an additional 176 tons on the pier, including 60 tons of incendiary clusters, to be loaded before departing.  Port Chicago disaster  On July 17, 1944, at 10:18 PM local time, two major explosions occurred 6 seconds apart in what became known as the Port Chicago disaster. The detonation of 4,600 tons of munitions being loaded onto the Quinault Victory and E.A. Bryan, registered at a magnitude of 3.4 on the seismograph at the University of California, Berkeley, some 20 miles away. The force of the explosions lifted the Quinault Victory out of the water, and she landed 500 feet away upside-down and facing the opposite direction. The E.A. Bryan was essentially vaporized, as there were no identifiable remains of her following the explosions. 320 sailors and dockworkers were killed and 390 were injured, making it the worst U.S. home front disaster of World War II. The span of only twelve weeks between the ship's keel being laid and the disaster may make Quinault Victory the most short-lived of all the Victory ships.

Biography and works Jovanovitch was born in 1919 to Croatian parents, George and Ella Jovanovitch in Cairns. When Danilo was four years old his parents moved to Sydney, where they purchased the Silver Grill caf√© in Kings Cross, which soon became a favoured meeting and eating place of soprano singer Gladys Moncrieff and others with artistic and theatrical flair. Jovanovitch's formal schooling began 2 years later at Newtown Infants School, and then at Mona Vale Infants School when his parents moved to Warriewood where they owned a house and farmland. His father George built and operated the first 46 tomato glass-houses in the region, to supply Sydney markets with tomatoes. Jovanovitch was an avid reader from an early age, as his mother had taught him to read prior to him starting school. He was inspired by the NSW state government School Magazine ‚Äì a monthly publication containing Australian poetry by such Australian authors as Henry Lawson, A.B. \\"Banjo\\" Paterson, and Dame Mary Gilmore. Jovanovitch's secondary school education was at Manly and Leichhardt Technical schools. 'Dan' Jovanovitch began writing poetry in the mid-1930s. At this time his family bought and managed a caf√© at New Farm, Queensland and it was from here that Jovanovitch set a record in 1937, by cycling 630 miles (solo) from Brisbane to Sydney in 54 hours. He continued cycle racing and regularly trained and competed in road races, as a member of Muswellbrook Cycle Club in the 1960s and 1970s. In the 1930s Jovanovitch was an acting student at Cinesound Talent School and appeared as an extra in the Australian comedy movies Ants in His Pants and Gone to the Dogs as well as 40,000 Horsemen. Leading Australian actor Alec Kelleway selected Jovanovitch as a featured extra to hold the leash of the 9th greyhound dog in the race scene in the feature film Gone to the Dogs, and Jovanovitch can be seen onscreen in the part on modern DVDs of the film. Ken G. Hall was the film's director, and tutored Danilo in acting, and encouraged him to seriously consider acting as a full-time career. Jovanovitch chose to have more control over his life than can be offered by the entertainment industry, and bought and ran small businesses till 1939, when he was conscripted into the Australian Armed Services during World War II. He was discharged after 12 months to assist on the family dairy farm at Dooralong. In 1940 Jovanovitch again volunteered for the army, joined the AIF BCOF 14th Works and Parks Engineers as a Rifleman First Class, and was stationed in Kure, near Hiroshima, Japan for 12 months, in February 1946, after the atomic bomb was dropped. During his time in the army, in Japan, Jovanovitch wrote the poems \\"Homeland Dreams\\", \\"Me Beaut Enamel Dishes\\", and \\"Australians\\". After his discharge from the army, Jovanovitch was becoming recognised for his bass baritone singing talent. Hoyts Theatres in Sydney employed him weekly, with live piano accompaniment to entertain audiences during the movie intervals. At home in Australia, and overseas, he was lead baritone singer in many stage productions, including the comedy sketch \\"The Parsons of Puddle\\" and musicals \\"The White Horse Inn\\" and \\"Happy Days\\". Well-known singing teacher Fritz Coper selected Jovanovitch as a student during auditions at Sydney Conservatorium of music. Jovanovitch attended lessons with him for a year, until Coper discontinued lessons due to his own age and ill health. Over the next decade, Jovanovitch circumnavigated the Australian continent three times on road trips, inspiring him to write such poems as \\"Monomeeth Ipminger\\" (about the treatment of Australian aboriginals), the prize-winning \\"Empty Pockets\\"Winner, Manning Literary Competition, Poetry section, page 2, 7 June 1989, The Manning River Times. (about working class struggles), and \\"Five Miles From Gundagai\\", inspired by the Jack Moses poem \\"Nine Miles From Gundagai\\". In the 1960s and 1970s, Jovanovitch owned and ran 'Hunter Valley Cordials Pty Ltd' in Muswellbrook, NSW and continued to write poetry, including \\"Eureka\\" about the historic Eureka Stockade battle that occurred at Ballarat, Victoria on Sunday 3 December 1854. In 1976, Jovanovitch married artist and writer Judyth Kurtz, from the famed wine-making Kurtz family of \\"Mudgee Wines\\" who were at the forefront of the 1960s Australian varietal wine-making revival in Eurunderee, NSW. The Kurtz family is referenced in Henry Lawson's poem \\"The Days When We Went Swimming\\" (i.e. \\"farmer Kutz\\"). At this time Jovanovitch wrote the poems \\"My Love\\" and \\"Eurunderee Flower\\", published in The Mudgee Guardian newspaper. In the late 1970s Jovanovitch's poem \\"Solemn Mountain\\" was published in The Mudgee Guardian,The Mudgee Guardian, page 11, 25 November 1975. as was the poem \\"Tribute to CD \`Dud' Mills\\", the noted Mudgee stockman, poet and author. In the 1980s Jovanovitch and family moved to Wang Wauk, on the mid-north coast of NSW and ran a hobby farm. While living here Jovanovitch wrote the published poems \\"Me Bulahdelah Sheila\\", \\"Nabiac\\", and \\"Those Telstra Blokes\\". In 1999 Jovanovitch and wife Judy moved to the central west of NSW, where he continued writing and publishing poetry in various newspapers, including \\"The Road To Larras Lee\\"Lyndhurst Chronicle, 24 June 1999, p8. and the poem \\"Australians\\", reprinted frequently to commemorate Anzac Day.Weekend Advocate, Saturday, 24 April 1999, Page 11. During the period 1999‚Äì2010, Judy Jovanovitch edited and published an anthology of Jovanovitch's poems, Songs of a Bushland Rover, and Rhyming Australian Poetry. In Rhyming Australian Poetry the works are grouped into genres, including Love Poems, War Poems, Nature/People/Places, Protest Poems, and Humour Poems.

Eunice and Cotys I had a son and successor, Rhescuporis I.http://www.american- pictures.com/genealogy/persons/per01399.htm The name Rhescuporis, is a name of Thracian origin and is a name that appears in the family of her mother-in-law. She is not mentioned in ancient Roman historical sources. Eunice is only known through surviving inscriptions and numismatic evidence. In the year 1910, a Greek inscription was found on a marble plate in the wall of a house in Anapa, Russia. Anapa was the ancient Greek city of Gorgippia. In the upper left corner of the marble plate appeared the below inscription. This inscription is dated from the reign of her son Rhescuporis I (68-90) (Corpus Regni Inscriptionum Bospor CIRB 1118): : [Œ§·Ω∏]ŒΩ ·ºêŒ∫ œÄœÅŒøŒ≥œåŒΩœâŒΩ Œ≤Œ±[œÉŒπŒªŒ≠œâŒΩ Œ≤Œ±œÉŒπŒªŒ≠Œ± ŒºŒ≠Œ≥Œ±ŒΩ]Œ§ŒπŒ≤Œ≠œÅŒπŒøœÖ ŒäŒøœçŒªŒπŒøœÖ ·ø¨Œ∑[œÉŒ∫ŒøœçœÄŒøœÅŒπŒΩ Œ≤Œ±œÉŒπŒªŒ≠œâœÇ ŒöœåœÑœÖ]oœÇ Œ∫Œ±·Ω∂ Œ≤Œ±œÉŒπŒªŒØœÉœÉŒ∑œÇ E·ΩêŒΩ[ŒµŒØŒ∫Œ∑œÇ]‚Ä¶ : The descendant of the Kings, great King Tiberius Julius Rhescuporis, son of King Cotys and of Queen Eunice Eunice's name has also appear in surviving bronze coinage from the Bosporan Kingdom.

On the other side of coins, appears with an enclosing wreath with the Greek abbreviations ŒíŒëŒö, ŒíŒëŒïŒ•, ŒíŒëŒïŒôŒ• and with the trade denomination ŒöŒî. ŒöŒë-Œ†Œï can be read as ŒöŒëŒ†Œï[œÑŒøŒªŒπœéŒΩ].

No other coins from the Bosporan bear these abbreviations. These coins can be dated from the reigns of Coyts I and Rhescuporis I. =Later life and regency= These coins reveal the political situation of the Bosporan Kingdom in the mid-1st century. In 63 for unknown reasons, the Roman Emperor Nero disposed Cotys I from his throne and his fate afterwards is unknown. The Bosporan Kingdom was incorporated as a part of the Roman Province of Moesia Inferior from 63-68. Perhaps Nero wanted to minimise the role, power and influence of local client rulers and desired the Bosporan to be completely governed by the Roman state. In June 68, Nero had died and Galba succeeded as Roman Emperor. The coinage clearly portrays the successful attempt of Rhescuporis I to restore the Bosporan Kingdom as a semi-independent Roman Client Kingdom. Cotys I had died by that time, Rhescuporis I had his throne and his kingdom restored to him. The surviving coinage and inscriptions reveal clues about Eunice. Eunice appears to have been a religious queen, who seems to be a woman of strong, virtuous character. She helped her son in restoration of the Bosporan Kingdom and acting as a regent at least in the first year of her son's rule. Eunice proved to be a capable ruling monarch in the Bosporan flourishing again.

The regiment was organized at Camp Walker, near Harmony Springs, Benton County, Arkansas. The regiment was officially designated as the Third Regiment (Cavalry), Arkansas State Troops by the State Military Board, but was designated as the 1st Arkansas Cavalry by Brigadier General Nicholas Bartlett Pearce, Commander, 1st Division, Provisional Army of Arkansas. The regiment is referred to as the \\"Carroll's Regiment\\" in contemporary accounts. Organization At the beginning of the war, the Arkansas Succession Convention created the Provisional Army of Arkansas. The Provisional Army was to consist of two divisions, the 1st Division in the western part of the state was to be commanded by Brigadier General Pearce, and the 2nd Division in the eastern half of the state, commanded by Major General James Yell. The intent of the Secession Convention was to transfer these state troop regiments into Confederate service as quickly as possible, to avoid the cost of paying for a large state army. The troops of the eastern division were transferred to the command of Brigadier General Hardee in July 1861, but the troops of the western division under Brigadier General Pearce were not transferred to Confederate service before they became engaged in the Battle of Wilson's Creek. The unit's designation as the 1st Cavalry Regiment, Arkansas State Troops has its origins in the confusion caused by Brigadier General Nicholas B. Pearce's failure to comply with the numbering system for regiments adopted by the State Military Board. The State Military Board authorized a 1st and 3rd Arkansas Regiment of State Troops. The 1st Regiment was commanded by Colonel Patrick R. Cleburne and was organized a Mound City, in the 2nd or Eastern Division of the Army of Arkansas. The State Military Board had authorized a 3rd Regiment of State Troops as a cavalry regiment under Colonel DeRosey Carroll, and ordered it to join the 1st Division\\" (actually a brigade) of the Army of Arkansas commanded by General Nicholas B. Pearce in northwest Arkansas. The free-spirited General Pearce ignored the unit designations authorized by the State Military Board, and assigned his own designations, based on when each regiment showed up in camp to muster. The first units to arrive at the designate assembly point were naturally the mounted units which became Carroll's regiment, so the 3rd Regiment Arkansas State Troops was re-designated the 1st Regiment. The officially sanctioned 2nd Regiment Arkansas State Troops, under Colonel John R. Gratiot, arrived at the assembly point third, and was immediately renamed the 3rd Regiment. Thus, all accounts of the State Troops in northwest Arkansas, including the battle of Wilson's Creek, refer to Gratiot's regiment as the 3rd Arkansas.Howerton, Bryan R. \\"The 3rd Arkansas Regiment(s)\\" Arkansas in the Civil War Message Board, Posted 6 February 2007, Accessed 20 July 2012, http://history-sites.com/cgi-bin/bbs53x/arcwmb/webbbs_config.pl?read=14621 Carroll's Regiment was composed of the following companies: *Company A ‚Äì \\"Pope Walker Guards\\" ‚Äì of Crawford County, commanded by Captain Charles Arthur CarrollHowerton, Bryan R. \\"Re: Companies of Pearce's Brigade\\", Arkansas in the Civil War Message Board, Posted 12 February 2007, Accessed 16 February 2012, http://history-sites.com/cgi- bin/bbs53x/arcwmb/webbbs_config.pl?noframes;read=14760 , See also Dandrige McRae Papers, Arkansas History Commission, http://www.ark- ives.com/manuscripts/detail.aspx?id=181 This unit was originally organized as a volunteer cavalry company in the 5th Regiment, Arkansas State Militia on June 14, 1861.Van Buren Press, Van Buren, Arkansas, Friday, March 1, 1861, Accessed January 24, 2011, Arkansas Military Department Records, List of Commissioned Officers in State Militia 1827‚Äì1862, Microfilm Roll 00000038-8, Page 23 *Company B ‚Äì \\"Sebastian County Cavalry\\" ‚Äì of Sebastian County, commanded by Captain Thomas Lewis This unit was originally organized as a volunteer cavalry company in the 51st Regiment, Arkansas State Militia on May 17, 1861.Kie Oldham Papers, Arkansas History Commission, One Capitol Mall, Little Rock Arkansas, Box 1, Items 18b *Company C ‚Äì Captain Armstrong's Company of Johnson County, commanded by Captain Lynus ArmstrongHowerton, Bryan R.;\\"Re: Johnson County Volunteer Companies\\", Arkansas in the Civil War Message Board, Posted May 2011, Accessed 16 December 2011, http://history- sites.com/cgi-bin/bbs53x/arcwmb/webbbs_config.pl?noframes;read=23906 This company was originally organized on December 28, 1860, as a volunteer cavalry company in the 10th Regiment, Arkansas State Militia.Arkansas Military Department Records, List of Commissioned Officers of the Militia 1827‚Äì1862, Arkansas History Commission, Microfilm Roll 00000038-8, Page 149 *Company D ‚Äì the \\"Independent Light Horse Guards\\" ‚Äì of Crawford County, commanded by Captain Powhatan Perkins.

A statement of ammunition on hand, omitted from above report, shows that the several companies averaged less than eight rounds per man. Captain Charles Arthur Carroll's company, the \\"Pope Walker Guards,\\" of Crawford County, was assigned as Company A of Col. DeRosey Carroll's regiment of cavalry, however, this assignment should be considered as purely administrative. Historians believe that at least four of the regiments's companies never actually served with the regiment, but instead operated independently under the direct command of the division commander, Brigadier General Nicholas Bartlett Pearce, as scouts and escorts.Howerton, Bryan R. \\"Re: Capt Carroll's Cav at Wilson's Creek?\\" Arkansas in the Civil War Message Board, Posted 31 May 2007, Accessed 20 July 2012, http://history- sites.com/cgi-bin/bbs53x/arcwmb/webbbs_config.pl?read=15724 Captain Carroll made his own report of the engagement to Brigadier General Pearce: Captain Carroll's company had been part of a force that General Pearce had sent to oppose and attack on the army's rear by Union Colonel Siegel. Pearce described the regiment and Captain Carroll's company's actions in his official report of the battle: Disbanded Following the Battle of Wilson's Creek, the regiment, with the rest of the Arkansas troops, was marched back to Arkansas and given the opportunity to vote on the issue of being transferred into Confederate service. The regiment, along with the rest of the 1st Division voted to disband rather than be transferred to Confederate service. Many veterans of the regiments joined other Confederate units later in the war. DeRosey Carroll held no further commands during the war.

They were organised according to the strict hierarchy of Peter the Great's table of ranks, following the woman's chin (rank) established on January 24, 1722.  Definition and table of ranks  Maria Feodorovna, by Vladimir Makovski in 1912. The Empress is wearing a regular Court dress All the ancient occupations of the women at the Court of Russia, traditionally held by boyarynias (wives of boyars), nurses, housekeepers, servants, nannies etc., were abolished and replaced by a new hierarchy inspired by Versailles Court's etiquette and German models, although many Muscovite and post-reform positions were in charge of identical functions. The new hierarchy used German terminology. *Ober-Hofmeisterin (The Great Mistress of the Court); first class *Wives of members of the Privy council of Russia; second class *Deystvitelnaya Statsdame (literally Acting Lady of the Suite); third class *Deystvitelnaya Kammer-devitsa (literally Acting Maid of the Bedchamber); fourth class and wives of College's presidents *Hofdame (literally Lady of the Court); fifth class and Generals' wives *Hofdevitsa (Maid of Honour); corresponding to Colonel's wives *Kammer-devitsa (Maid of the Bedchamber) But in fact, the seven strict ranks were reduced to five by the mid 18th century and their names evolved as well. The four first ranks were only granted to 82 women at the end of the 18th century and only 18 in 1915. *Ober-Hofmeisterin (The Great Mistress of the Court) *Hofmeisterin (since 1748) (The Mistress of the Court) *Statsdame, 12 in 1796 (Lady of the Suite) *Kammer-Fr√§ulein (Maid of the Bedchamber) *Fr√§ulein (pronounced in a Russian way: Freylina), 12 in 1796 (Maid of Honour)  Service  Portrait of Princesse Catherine Galitzine, born Cantemir (1720-1761), with a portrait of Empress Catherine II, by Van Loo (Pushkin Museum) Alexandra's initials, by Gavriil Iakovlevalt=Freilina with the Empress\` initials on her shoulder *The Fr√§ulein rank was the most common, around 189 for 203 ladies-in-waiting in 1881. In 1914, they were 261 for 280. A Fr√§ulein or a Kammer-Fr√§ulein were unmarried. A small number of those who married received a higher title but the vast majority had to leave the service at Court. In 1826, Nicolas I decided that only 36 Fr√§ulein would be at the service of the Empress, Grand-Duchesses and Princesses of the Imperial family : they were called Fr√§ulein of the Household. Being a Fr√§ulein gave the right to wear white and red at Court. *The Kammer-Fr√§ulein rank was only granted to 4 or 5 ladies-in-waiting, the Statsdame rank was only granted to 5 ladies in 1914, all of them being married with high rank dignitaries. Most of these ladies, noblewomen of high rank, were members of the Order of St Catherine. Their positions rarely entailed daily service at Court, they were mostly honorific with attendance on great occasions. *The \\"Hofmeisterin\\" or \\"Ober-Hofmeisterin\\" rank gave precedence over all the other ladies-in-waiting. They were members of the Empress\` or Grand-Duchesses' Households and were in charge of introductions of the women invited to Court. *The Hofmeisterin, Statsdame and Kammer-Fr√§ulein ranks entitled their holder to the form of address Your High Excellency (–í–∞—à–µ –í—ã—Å–æ–∫–æ–ø—Ä–µ–≤–æ—Å—Ö–æ–¥–∏—Ç–µ–ª—å—Å—Ç–≤–æ). During the official ceremonies, the ladies-in-waiting had to wear specific Court dresses according to a regulation of 1834 fixing the clothing, the manner and the colors allowed for each one. A Hofmeisterin, Statsdame or Kammer-Fr√§ulein wore a miniature portrait of the Empress on their right shoulder and were called dames √† portrait, one of the most prestigious positions at Court. After they left active service, they would wear it on their left shoulder. The Fr√§ulein would only wear the Empress or Grand Duchess' initials in diamonds, pinned to their left shoulder. In the 18th century, some of them were granted the right to wear curls.

President of the United States Barack Obama delivered a speech at the Together We Thrive: Tucson and America memorial on January 12, 2011, held in the McKale Center on the University of Arizona campus. It honored the victims of the 2011 Tucson shooting and included themes of healing and national unity. Watched by more than 30 million Americans,\\"More than 30 Million Watch President Obama‚Äôs Address at Tucson Memorial\\" NielsenWire, January 13, 2011. Retrieved 2011-01-21. it drew widespread praise from politicians and commentators across the political spectrum and from abroad. Writing the speech Obama with speechwriter Cody Keenan aboard Air Force One. Obama began writing his speech the day of the shooting, discussing the matter with young Pentecostal clergyman, Joshua DuBois, head of the White House Office of Faith-Based and Neighborhood Partnerships. That day and the next, he spoke with relatives of the victims of the shooting, including Mark E. Kelly the astronaut who is Gabrielle Giffords' husband. The formal speechwriting process began on January 10, with staff speechwriter Cody Keenan. Previously a staffer for Senator Edward Kennedy, Keenan helped write the remarks Obama delivered after Kennedy's death. Keenan is a Chicago native, and was then a recent graduate of Harvard University with a master's degree in public policy. White House staffers found a copy of Faces of Hope, a book picturing 50 babies born on September 11, 2001. One was Christina-Taylor Green, the girl killed in the shooting. That book contained a quote from the book's author that Obama incorporated into his speech: \\"I hope you jump in rain puddles.\\" White House staffers exchanged email with religious advisors about biblical passages, settling on the Book of Job and Psalms 46. Obama decided to quote the lesser- known, middle part of the psalm, feeling it better fit his theme as opposed to more frequently quoted verses. Summary of speech Obama delivers the speech at the McKale Center. Early in the speech, Obama said, \\"There is nothing I can say that will fill the sudden hole in your heart,\\" and said that the hopes of the nation were with those in mourning. He quoted from Psalm 46, verses 4 and 5, and then summarized the events of the previous Saturday morning, when six people were killed and Gabrielle Giffords was shot through the head, while \\"gathered outside a supermarket to exercise their right to peaceful assembly and free speech.\\" Six times over, he devoted four or five sentences each to summarizing the lives of the six who were killed: Judge John Roll, Dorothy Morris, Phyllis Schneck, Dorwan Stoddard, Congressional aide Gabe Zimmerman and Christina-Taylor Green. Summarizing this section of the speech, he said, \\"Our hearts are broken by their sudden passing. Our hearts are broken - and yet, our hearts also have reason for fullness.\\" Obama meets with shooting victims and their families at the McKale Center. He then mentioned the 13 people who had survived being shot, specifically Congresswoman Giffords, who was the most seriously injured. He went on to praise the heroism of those who acted to save people, including those who provided emergency first aid, those who helped disarm and subdue the gunman, and the nurses, physicians and emergency personnel who helped save the lives of the wounded. He mentioned his visit to the hospital and, with permission from her family, said four times that \\"Gabby had opened her eyes\\" for the first time since the shooting, to rapturous and the most sustained applause of the many applause breaks during the speech. Obama discussed how people were seeking to make sense out of something senseless by debating issues such as gun safety laws and the adequacy of the mental health treatment system, observing that such discussions were necessary in exercising self-government. He spoke of a new \\"National Conversation\\" already beginning after the tragedy. He urged that presently polarized national debate be conducted \\"in a way that heals, not in a way that wounds.\\" Quoting the Book of Job 30:26, he observed that \\"terrible things happen for reasons that defy human understanding.\\" He then said, \\"For the truth is that none of us can know exactly what triggered this vicious attack\\", and that no one can know \\"what thoughts lurked in the inner recesses of a violent man's mind\\". Urging his listeners to avoid using the tragedy as \\"one more occasion to turn on one another\\", he recommended humility, empathy and especially reflection instead, urging people to consider whether they have \\"shown enough kindness and generosity and compassion to the people in our lives\\". He said \\"we are reminded that in the fleeting time we have on this Earth, what matters is not wealth, or status, or power, or fame -‚Äì but rather, how well we have loved, and what small part we have played in making the lives of other people better.\\" He then returned to a tribute to those who were killed, praising their virtues, and concentrating specifically on the example of Christina-Taylor Green, the nine-year-old girl who had been born on September 11, 2001. He recommended that people should be motivated by their loss to \\"strive to be better in our private lives\\", and to \\"help usher in more civility in our public discourse.\\" At this moment he again addressed the causes of the tragedy, saying \\" ... let us remember it is not because a simple lack of civility caused this tragedy ‚Äî it did not....\\" Commenting that \\"those who died here - those who saved lives here - they help me to believe\\", he observed that, in the end, \\"people are full of decency and goodness.\\" Wrapping up his speech with more anecdotes about Christina-Taylor Green, he said, \\"All of us ‚Äî we should do everything we can to make sure this country lives up to our children's expectations\\". After referencing heaven and rain puddles there, and \\"commitment as Americans to forging a country that is forever worthy of her gentle, happy spirit\\", he closed the speech with a blessing. Responses by American historians Douglas Brinkley called the speech a turning point in the Obama presidency. \\"It was his most important speech so far, one that history is going to reflect on,\\" said Brinkley. \\"There was a bit of Dr. King to him. That's simply been missing in his presidency so far. I was sitting there and I realized, 'This guy might be a great man.' I had forgotten about that.\\" Michael Beschloss said that, \\"I thought it was one of the best speeches he's ever given. Not only the message, which was to pull the redeeming things out of this horrible episode, but also the way he really sort of came to life while giving it.\\" History professor Ellen Fitzpatrick of the University of New Hampshire said that, \\"It was really a sign of what we expect from our president, that is what a leader does in a time of crisis and division and tragedy is to reduce, not heighten tensions. And I thought by his example, the way he described the humanity of all of the people involved in this tragic event, that he showed by the way he spoke and what he asked Americans to do. He led by his own example in a very powerful way.\\" Garry Wills wrote that \\"Obama had to rise above the acrimonious debate about what caused the gunman in Tucson to kill and injure so many people. He that issue by celebrating the fallen and the wounded and those who rushed to their assistance. He has been criticized by some for holding a \\"pep rally\\" rather than a mourning service. But he was speaking to those who knew and loved and had rallied around the people attacked. He was praising them and those who assisted them, and the cheers were deserved.\\" Wills thought very highly of the speech, comparing it to Lincoln's Gettysburg Address and Second inaugural address and to Shakespeare's Henry V's speech at Agincourt. Doris Kearns Goodwin was struck by the emotion that the usually self-controlled Obama showed during the speech. \\"He did exactly what the moment called for, in a way that was consistent with him as a cerebral president. It was a completely authentic moment.\\" Public opinion regarding the speech Audience members embrace during the speech. The Pew Research Center conducted a poll that asked about Americans' response to Obama's speech in Tucson. The report said that \\"the aftermath of the deadly shooting rampage in Tucson, Ariz., dominated the public's news interest last week as President Obama's speech at a memorial service won praise -- across party lines -- among those who had read or heard about the event.\\" According to Pew, \\"Most Americans say they heard at least a little about Obama's speech at the January 12 memorial service at the University of Arizona (75%). Among that group, nearly seven-in-ten (69%) say the address was either excellent (36%) or good (33%), while 21% rate the speech as only fair (15%) or poor (6%).\\" ABC News and The Washington Post conducted a poll that gauged public response to Obama's response to the shootings, including his Tucson speech. Pollster Gary Langer reported that \\"Seventy-eight percent in a new ABC News-Washington Post poll approve of the way Obama has responded to the shootings, which he addressed in a speech in Tucson last week; that includes 71 percent of Republicans and conservatives alike.\\" One week after the speech, John Harwood of CNBC reported that a poll conducted by NBC News and The Wall Street Journal found that Obama's job approval rating had increased from 45% to 53% in the past month. Harwood said that Obama was \\"strengthened by his adjustment to Republican gains and his response to the Tucson shootings\\", and that as a result, he \\"approaches next week's State of the Union address with renewed political momentum\\". While Obama's speech was widely praised, some television viewers felt that excessive applause and cheering from the audience created an inappropriate pep rally- like atmosphere at the service. Domestic responses to the speech The speech was notable for receiving acclaim from Republicans and conservatives. Mike Huckabee called it \\"easily the best speech of his presidency.\\" Charles Krauthammer praised the speech, especially in regards to Obama's mention of Gifford's opening her eyes for the first time: \\"the way he seized the moment and he brought the audience to that and became so inspirational\\" was \\"quite remarkable and extremely effective.\\" David Frum added that the \\"president's challenge, as so often, was to make a human connection. In that, he succeeded tonight. He paid tribute to the individuality of the lost, honored the pain of the bereaved, and was crucial in bringing together the collective community acknowledgment of grief that is the only available comfort to those who mourn.\\" Senator John McCain praised Obama's call for civility as a \\"terrific speech. McCain said that Obama had \\"comforted and inspired the country.\\" McCain also said that Obama had \\"movingly mourned and honored the victims\\", and \\"encouraged every American who participates in our political debates - whether we are on the left or right or in the media - to aspire to a more generous appreciation of one another and a more modest one of ourselves.\\" The Wall Street Journal reported that praise for the speech came from conservative pundits such as Charles Krauthammer and prominent Republicans including Newt Gingrich, Tim Pawlenty and Ed Rollins. The newspaper reported that Obama was making \\"an effort to recast himself as a unifying figure, after two years of partisan fights\\" and that \\"it was clear he had taken another step in that direction\\". Linda Feldmann of The Christian Science Monitor reported that Glenn Beck called the speech \\"probably the best speech he has ever given.\\" Pat Buchanan called it \\"splendid.\\" Michael Gerson, speechwriter for George W. Bush, said \\"it had a good heart.\\" The newspaper reported that Fox News panelists Brit Hume and Chris Wallace had praised the speech. Fox News commentator Bill O'Reilly wrote an opinion piece in the Boston Herald, saying, \\"In an excellent speech eulogizing the six dead and paying respect to the critically wounded Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, Obama appealed to the nation to cool down and stop the nonsense.\\" O'Reilly went on to say that Obama should have given the speech sooner. In addition, various political commentators noted the significance of the speech. David Jackson of USA Today wrote that \\"A little more than a week after the deadly shooting in Arizona, it seems clear that President Obama's political standing is stronger.\\" Describing the impact of Obama's speech, he said that it had \\"won near-universal praise, his approval ratings are back at 50% or higher in several polls, and many commentators put him in an improved position for re-election in 2012.\\" Discussing the speechwriting process, Lynn Sweet of the Chicago Sun-Times wrote that the speech was \\"memorable\\" and that it \\"has gotten good reviews, for content and hitting the right pitch\\". \\"The Plum Line\\" editorial in The Washington Post commented: \\"The Tucson speech may go down as one of the most important of Barack Obama's presidency, so it's worth nailing down its most important accomplishment: He finally got conservatives to listen to what he had to say - about them. In Slate, legal analyst Dahlia Lithwick wrote that \\"President Obama's speech in Tucson last night should be ranked with his greatest oratorical moments, largely because in the end he was brave enough to sidestep politics and ideology, and speak instead of love, and family, and the need for kindness.\\" Kent Ward of the Bangor Daily News called it \\"arguably as fine a speech as he has made in his ceremonial role as head of state.\\" International response  Political science professor Clifford Orwin of the University of Toronto wrote that \\"Mr. Obama rose above tacky surroundings to deliver the best speech of his career.\\" Al Jazeera's Patty Culhane, said Obama's speech set a new marker for how politics is carried out during the rest of his presidency. \\"From here on out I think everything he does will be measured by the pundits against this incredible speech he gave here tonight,\\" she said. \\"We've moments in the past where mass tragedies have led to legislation but we haven't seen a change in the tone in Washington. In the United Kingdom, Ewen MacAskill of The Guardian chose to end a positive article by quoting James Fallows in The Atlantic \\"A performance to remember. This will be, along with his 2004 convention speech and his March 2008 'meaning of race' speech in Philadelphia, one of the speeches he is lastingly known for ‚Äì and to add to the list of daunting political/oratorical challenges Obama has not merely met but mastered.\\" French conservative newspaper Le Figaro considered the discourse \\"Moving, empathic, and above the raging political conflict.\\" It also noted \\"a religious approach in phase with a deeply believing America\\" \\"Une approche religieuse en phase avec une Am√©rique profond√©ment croyante.\\" L'Express claimed that \\"many people compare his moving appeal to national mourning and solidarity within this ordeal, on January 12, to the decisive Bill Clinton speech after the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing, or the day after 9/11 George W. Bush discourse\\". It noticed that, while Obama had been criticized for his lack of empathy before, he managed to express his emotions. The Times of India called the speech \\"a stirring memorial address by President Obama on Wednesday that abjured politics and called for 'talking with each in a way that heals, not a way that wounds'\\". In The Sydney Morning Herald an article by Simon Mann titled \\"The killer political metaphor under fire\\" examined the wider political atmosphere surrounding the killings. It referred to The New York Times columnist Paul Krugman's use of the term \\"eliminationist rhetoric\\" to describe the atmosphere which preceded them. It also quoted Andrew Sullivan: \\"To rate this address on any political meter would be to demean it. The President wrested free of politics tonight and spoke of greater things.\\" Mann also mentioned two congressmen who said they intended \\"packing heat\\" more often when meeting constituents in future, but that \\"others seemed resigned to merely a (post speech) truce in the high-octane political sport of baiting and debating\\" He ended with a quote from Erick Erickson about obstacles to civil politics: \\"Too many people earn a really good living pushing this tone and this hate.\\" See also *2011 Tucson shooting: Reaction References External links *Tragedy in Arizona Video and transcript on the White House web site. *\\"President and First Lady Honor Victims\\" video of memorial on C-SPAN.org *\\"Obama's Tucson speech transcript: Full text of prepared remarks\\".

Called by Steve Smith of The New York Times ‚Äúa potentially estimable operatic composer in the making,‚Äù his music has been compared to Leonard Bernstein's. Performances Kovler's music, described as \\"intensely moving\\" and \\"by turns comic, mystical, warm, and searing\\" has been commissioned by the Israel Festival, the Tanglewood Music Center and the Carnegie Hall. His orchestral works have been performed worldwide by the Israel Philharmonic Orchestra, the Fox Studios Symphony (Los Angeles), the Metropole Orchestra (Amsterdam), the American Composers Orchestra (New York), the Boston Modern Orchestra Project and others. Awards and honors M√°tti was a fellow at the Tanglewood, Aspen and Accademia Chigiana Festivals, a winner of two ASCAP Morton Gould Young Composers Awards, and of the Theodore Presser Award. M√°tti Kovler is a recipient of the America- Israel Cultural Foundation scholarships and holds a doctorate in Composition from the New England Conservatory. In September 2013 M√°tti was recognized by the Boston Foundation as one of the six winners of the 2013 Brother Thomas Fellowships, ‚Äúno strings attached‚Äù $15,000 bi-annual awards designed to support 6 talented artists making outstanding contributions to their community through excellence in their craft. Musical Influences Kovler has mastered a range of styles from folk and jazz to those steeped in the classical tradition, and brings these together in works of considerable dramatic scope. His musical influences include folklore research, improvisation, a deep fascination with Jan√°ƒçek and Bart√≥k poly-modality and the cult writings of the French theatre philosopher Antonin Artaud. Somewhat reactionary to his Soviet upbringing, Kovler‚Äôs interest in bringing sacred texts or melodies from the Jewish tradition into a contemporary context was ignited by his mentor, Israeli composer Andr√© Hajdu, a student of Messiaen and Milhaud. An advocate of expanding the definition of \\"Jewish musical theater,\\" over the past decade Kovler created a substantial body of work intended to propel this genre beyond wallowing in a nostalgic past. They aim to tap into a more nuanced, multi- dimensional sensibility aligned with the younger generation‚Äîa generation that is rooted in tradition but yearns for the next step, beyond Fiddler on the Roof.  Floating Tower  M√°tti Kovler is the artistic director of Floating Tower, based in Brooklyn, NYC. With a modular make-up of 27 multi-national actors/musicians, Floating Tower operates as a creator, producer and educator developing innovative content and new avenues for cross-cultural engagement. Since its founding in 2011, Floating Tower has created over thirty productions in the United States, Israel, China and Russia. Spanning from traditional to experimental, Floating Tower events have been staged at venues ranging from Boston‚Äôs Museum of Fine Arts to the Collector Gallery, a 1000 sq. ft. underground art-cave in Moscow. Recent Projects :Ami and Tami ‚Äî A musical fable for children, Ami and Tami is a contemporary twist on Hansel and Gretel. Based on an earlier piece co-written by Kovler and Aya Lavie, the piece was substantially adapted and translated to English by Spencer Garfield. World premiere took place as part of the Outside The Box Festival on Boston Common featuring Boston Landmarks Orchestra. In 2016 the production traveled to Palo- Alto. In 2017 the opera-musical was produced in NYC's Blue Building, in a makeshift immersive production directed by Doug Fitch where audience members traveled alongside the actors and orchestra across five different spaces throughout the show. In summer 2017, the production traveled to the Edinburgh Fringe Festival. In 2019, a full orchestral version of the opera, with a revised libretto by Matthew Cole Kelly, premiered in Teatro Coccia, Novara (translated to Italian by Andrea Ascari) to great critical acclaim. :The Drumf and the Rhinegold - a political satire on Donald Trump and the 2016 presidential election of the United States. An immersive opera-theater parody of Wagner‚Äôs Ring Cycle, ‚ÄòThe Drumf and the Rhinegold‚Äô, was produced during the historic 2016 election, in collaboration with Doug Fitch, Claire Chase and members of International Contemporary Ensemble, starring Ariadne Greif as Melania. The work was initially conceived in collaboration with Tasha Gordon Solmon at the BMI Lehman Engel Musical Theatre Workshop. :Quill of the Soul ‚Äî A musical tribute to Elie Wiesel, the Nobel Prize winning writer, educator and Holocaust scholar. The performance, co-produced by Boston University's Elie Wiesel Center and Boston Jewish Music Festival, and hosted by the WGBH, takes the Hasidic Niggun as its point of departure, exploring the surprising parallels between the Niggun and other world incantations. :Seekers of Light ‚Äî A sequel to Kovler‚Äôs Here Comes Messiah!, Seekers of Light deals with the rise and fall of the mystical Jewish messiah of the 17th century, Shabtai Zvi, and is inspired by sketches by Theodor Tezhik. Featuring Parham Haghighi (Iran) and Tutti Druyan (Israel). :Here Comes Messiah! ‚Äî a monodrama for soprano and chamber ensemble, commissioned by the Carnegie Hall in 2009 for the Golijov/Upshaw Workshop, is based on a musical motto from a Hassidic chant. A tour-de-force for a soprano singer, this theatrical score follows a young woman in the process of giving birth. Most recently, a new version of the piece, for soprano and full orchestra was premiered by soprano Reut Rivka and the Ukraine State Symphony conducted by Mykola Lisenko as part of GogolFest in Kiev.Here Comes Messiah at Gogol Fest, http://www.gogolfest.org.ua/eng/programm/2071 :The Escape of Jonah ‚Äî an oratorio for soloists, choir and brass orchestra, is a parody on the story of the prophet Jonah, from today‚Äôs perspective. The work juxtaposes the biblical text performed by the choir with the agitated speech of Jonah, the wandering Jew, impersonated by the trumpet. :Cokboy (A Jew Among The Indians) for actor and orchestra. A monodrama based on the story of a displaced Jew‚Äîin America‚Äîin search for his cultural identity.

The National Board of Diving and Hyperbaric Medical Technology offers certification in hyperbaric nursing as a Certified Hyperbaric Registered Nurse (CHRN). The professional nursing organization for hyperbaric nursing is the Baromedical Nurses Association. Hyperbaric nurses are responsible for administering hyperbaric oxygen therapy to patients and supervising them throughout the treatment. These nurses must work under a supervising physician trained in hyperbarics who is available during the treatment in case of emergency. Hyperbaric nurses either join the patient inside the multiplace hyperbaric oxygen chamber or operate the machine from outside of the monoplace hyperbaric oxygen chamber, monitoring for adverse reactions to the treatment. Patients can experience adverse reactions to the hyperbaric oxygen therapy such as oxygen toxicity, hypoglycemia, anxiety, otic barotrauma, or pneumothorax. The nurse must know how to handle each adverse event appropriately. The most common adverse effect is otic barotrauma, trauma to the inner ear due to pressure not being released on descent. Since hyperbaric oxygen therapy is usually administered daily for a set number of treatments, adverse effects must be prevented in order for the patient to receive all prescribed treatments. The hyperbaric nurse will collaborate with the patient's physician to determine if hyperbaric oxygen therapy is the right treatment. The nurse must know all approved indications that warrant hyperbaric oxygen therapy treatments, along with contraindications to the treatment.

With the proliferation of harmonic enhancement algorithms, pioneered by Crane Song's Dave Hill, a new class of harmonic enhancement algorithms have emerged. Examples of algorithms used to create HEDA include the HEAT feature (available on Pro Tools HD 8.1 and later) and the multi-platform plug-ins Universal Audio's Studer A800, Slate Digital's Virtual Console Collection, Waves Non- Linear Summer, and Crane Song HEDD-192. History Development of harmonic enhancement was in its first stages in 1999 when Antares, developer of Autotune, noticed that the tube emulation feature in its microphone simulator was used more than its other features. In response, Antares created a specific plug-in, called Antares Tube, which implemented tube emulation. The algorithms for harmonic enhancement were just beginning and market interest was shown to be present. During its development period, harmonic exciters and harmonic enhancement plug-ins were looked down upon by most of the pro-audio industry. Modern Harmonic Enhancement HEAT (Harmonic Enhancement Algorithm Technology), released in 2010, is a plug-in featured on each track of HD editions of Pro Tools. Avid, developer of Pro Tools, enlisted the help of Dave Hill of Crane Song for its creation. Dave Hill's harmonic enhancement algorithms have been viewed as top-of-the-line by many professionals for years. Before Pro Tools 8.1, no Digital Audio Workstation (DAW) featured harmonic enhancement on each track.

In an interview, Alfred Gough expressed his desire to avoid doing anything \\"campy or retro.\\" He later stated, \\"The characters are real and emotionally grounded, but they still like to have fun, wear great clothes, solve crime, and kick some serious ass...we hope to surprise people and bring a whole new generation to Charlie's Angels.\\" Robert Wagner was set to star as Charlie, but due to scheduling conflicts, had to exit the project. After an exhaustive search, Victor Garber was finally cast as the new voice of Charlie. Veteran television director Marcos Siega directed the pilot. Filming began in Miami on March 8, 2011.

Matthew Gilbert of The Boston Globe gave the show a \\"C\\" grade commenting \\"The underwhelming cast brings nothing to the boilerplate action. Kelly is miscast as a biker chick, and making Bosley a hunk with computer skills fails to add life.\\" IGN's Matt Fowler named the pilot the worst pilot of the fall, pointing out the bad acting and writing, saying that he didn't \\"believe that these ladies could change a flat tire, much less take down a notorious human trafficker\\" and that the series should have gone dark like Nikita or copied the tone of Burn Notice. On December 26, 2011 Hitfix.com's Alan Sepinwall listed the reboot on his \\"Lumps of coal: The worst TV I watched in 2011\\", stating \\"it just chose horribly wrong, with a grim, ultra-serious take that robbed whatever campy/cheesey fun you might have expected from the brand name, and with a collection of terrible performances and bad writing that undercut any attempt to give the Angels some dramatic heft.\\" =Ratings= The pilot episode drew only a 2.1/6 among the 18‚Äì49 demos with 8.76 million viewers in Thursday slot on ABC.

Grossman began writing the novel in May 2003 when his oldest son Yonatan was serving in the Israeli Defense Forces and the book was largely complete by August 2006 when his younger son Uri was killed in the Second Lebanon War. Originally written in Hebrew, an English translation by Jessica Cohen was published in September 2010 to widespread critical acclaim. Translation of this work presented a considerable challenge to the translator, as the original includes numerous Hebrew puns as well as quotations from and allusions to the Hebrew Bible as well as works of modern Hebrew literature. Plot synopsis Ora, a recently divorced Jerusalemite physiotherapist in her early fifties, had anxiously waited for her son Ofer to get through his three years' term of military service - spent mainly in confronting and skirmishing with the rebellious Palestinians of the Second Intifada. But just as she prepares to mark Ofer's safe return by going off with him to a long-planned week of backpacking in the Galilee, the West Bank situation sharply escalates and the Israeli Army launches an all-out invasion (\\"Operation Defensive Shield\\" of April 2002). To Ora's great dismay, Ofer volunteers to rejoin his unit. Taking him in a taxi to the base camp, Ora is filled with apprehension that Ofer is going to get killed, and compares herself to the Biblical Abraham who took his son off to be slaughtered. Back in her empty home, she is haunted by unbearable visions of army officers knocking on her door and bringing the message of Ofer's death in action, and at a moment's notice she runs off \\"To the End of the Land\\". Ora's wanderings and trekking through the Israeli countryside make up the bulk of the book's plot. She refuses to listen to news broadcasts or read papers, but cannot help noticing monuments of old battles and the inscribed names of dead soldiers. Interspersed with Ora's various experiences - surrealistic, nightmarish and sometimes humorous - are memories of previous events in her life, love relationships and motherhood, and the way it was impacted by earlier wars and conflicts in Israel's history. The story moves back and forth in time with extensive flashbacks, going back to the 1967 Six Day War - when the teenager Ora was confined to a hospital isolation ward where she met two boys, Avram and Ilan, fell in love with both of them and entered into a very complicated, lifelong love triangle. It would be Avram who would eventually father Ofer, while Ilan would become Ora's husband, lovingly raising this son. Avram would become terribly traumatized after undergoing torture as a prisoner of war in the 1973 Yom Kippur War, and cut himself off from her and from his son - despite, or precisely because of, caring greatly. But at the ultimate crisis in the story's present moment, Avram would reappear to share Ora's desperate quest. Reception To the End of the Land was nominated for the 2010 National Book Critics Circle Award for Fiction and won the 2011 JQ Wingate Prize.Jewish Quarterly-Wingate Prize 2011 The novel's French translation, Une femme fuyant l'annonce, won the 2011 Prix M√©dicis √©tranger award for the best book published that year in translation.

The school building is situated in the Buenos Aires neighbourhood of Belgrano, Argentina. History The school was founded on October 3, 1967 as a result of a cooperation agreement between France and Argentina. Two days later, the first President of the Fifth Republic Charles De Gaulle placed the cornerstone of the future building. Finally the Lyc√©e opened its doors on March 10, 1969. Its name honors the courage of French airman Jean Mermoz and his contribution to the development of South America's aviation. The objective of the 1967 FrenchArgentine cooperation agreement was the integration of both educational systems as a means to improve mutual understanding between the countries. Graduates are expected to complete a rigorous academic program and to demonstrate a strong sense of public responsibility and exemplary citizenship. Completion of the course of study gives graduates the opportunity to enter both the Argentine and French University systems The Lyc√©e Franco-Argentin Jean Mermoz offers a fully bilingual FrenchSpanish education as well as a solid English program that certifies students to the B2 level of the Common European Framework for Languages. Educational programs are inspired in fundamental human rights values and French and Argentine academic domestic traditions as well as in students' academic excellence. Students get the opportunity to obtain two academic degrees, baccalaur√©at and bachillerato, corresponding to the French and Argentine titles similar to high school in the United States. Three educational levels The first level begins at kindergarten where students will perform their first tasks. Games and rules will be useful to teach and enforce student's behavior allocating positive incentives to help little kids to develop their character within social activities. Games and activities are fully bilingual after which students are expected to know writing and reading basis in French and Spanish. The second level continues at elementary school where students will learn to master writing and reading skills. Furthermore, students will learn geometry and arithmetical basics as well as social and natural sciences. Moreover, young kids will be introduced and encouraged to learn core values such as teamwork, solidarity and critical spirit through the sports' discipline and fine arts. The third level is the baccalaur√©at where students will be given instruments to develop their own abilities to achieve a solid understanding of math, social and natural sciences. In addition young citizens will learn philosophical and historical disciplines and, in turn, both disciplines will enhance students' ability to understand the world and individuals.

A friend of the historian Edward Gibbon, the poet James Thomson and other members of the Georgian era literary world, he was described as 'perhaps the most accomplished of all amateur mathematicians who never gave their works to the world'. He was married for a short time to the writer Sarah Scott but they separated after less than a year. His younger brother Caroline Frederick Scott was an army officer, who gained a reputation for brutality in the aftermath of the 1745 Jacobite Rising. Life Sarah Scott; married in 1751, they separated in 1752 George Lewis Scott was born in Hanover in 1708, eldest of three sons of James (or George) Scott and Marion Stewart, daughter of Sir James Stewart, Lord Advocate of Scotland. His father was a close friend of George I, then Elector Hanover and held diplomatic posts at various German courts. Hanover's involvement in the Great Northern War made this an extremely sensitive and important position and James was closely involved in negotiations to end it. His younger brother Caroline Frederick (ca 1711-1754) was named after Caroline of Ansbach (1683-1737), wife of George II and mother of the Duke of Cumberland. When James died in 1726, Marion moved to the Dutch Republic so her children could attend Leiden University. George also studied law at Middle Temple in London, although he does not appear to have practised as a lawyer. In June 1751, he married the novelist Sarah Robinson; they separated in April 1752, George agreeing to pay her ¬£100 per annum. The reasons are unclear but the two spoke of each other with bitterness for the rest of their lives. Career Middle Temple in London, where Scott qualified as a lawyer Middle Temple was one of the four Inns of Court, all located close to each other and while Scott rarely used his qualification, he made a number of friends there. They included the encyclopaedist Ephraim Chambers (1680-1740), who lived at Gray's Inn and Thomas Robinson (1714-1747), brother of his future wife Sarah, who studied at Lincoln's Inn. He began his literary career as part of a London circle of expatriate Scots, among them the poet James Thomson and publisher Andrew Millar. The three were members of the Society for the Encouragement of Learning, one of a number of educational initiatives established in Scotland during the 1730s. He became a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries on 3 June 1736, and was made a Fellow of the Royal Society on 5 May 1737. It is suggested he studied under the French Huguenot mathematician, Abraham De Moivre, who lived in London for many years. He was certainly regarded as an expert in the field, as shown by his appointment to the Board of Longitude in the 1760s. Through his mother, he was distantly related to William Trail (1746-1831), Chair of Mathematics at Marischal College from 1767 to 1779 and the two were frequent correspondents. The mathematician Robert Simson was another friend; some of their letters were printed in Trail's Life of Simson. Historian Edward Gibbon (1737-1794) was a close friend On occasion, Scott acted as a literary agent for former Jacobite statesman and Tory ideologue Viscount Bolingbroke. In November 1750, Bolingbroke recommended Scott to Frederick, Prince of Wales as a suitable sub-preceptor or tutor for his son, the future George III. The prospect of a steady income enabled Scott to marry Sarah Robinson, sister of his friend Thomas and they rented a house in Leicester Square, London. When Frederick died in April 1751, his son became Prince of Wales and Thomas Hayter, Bishop of Norwich was appointed preceptor or head tutor. Hayter was a political Whig, while Scott was viewed as a Jacobite and his cousin, the economist James Steuart, had been exiled for his part in the 1745 Rebellion. A memorandum was circulated, allegedly written by Horace Walpole, implying George was surrounded by Jacobites, leading to fierce political debate and divisions between Hayter, Scott and other members of the Prince's household. Clark, Thomas Paine: Britain, America, and France in the Age of Enlightenment and Revolution; pp. 46-47 In April 1752, Sarah was removed from the family home by her father and brothers for undisclosed reasons, although there were a number of rumours. Scott agreed to pay her a pension of ¬£100 per annum, although they never formally divorced. One suggestion was Scott poisoned her; discussing his education in later life, George III claimed Hayter was responsible for this. Thomas Paine; Scott reportedly introduced him to Benjamin Franklin When he died in 1740, Chambers left materials for a supplement to his Dictionary of Arts and Sciences. Scott was asked to prepare these for publication; the two volumes appeared in 1753 and he is said to have received ¬£1,500 for his services. Although he was dismissed as George's tutor in 1755, he was appointed a commissioner of Excise in 1758 and served on the Board of Longitude, testimony to his reputation as a mathematician. Chalmers, p. 272 In 1767, Edward Gibbon and Jacques Georges Deyverdun asked him to supply a paper ‚Äòon the present state of the physical and mathematical sciences‚Äô in England, for inclusion in the M√©moires Litt√©raires de la Grande-Bretagne. In 1775, Gibbon sent him part of his Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire for comments. As part of the London intelligentsia, he frequently appears in letters from friends and acquaintances. He was considered an excellent musician, and helped Johann Christoph Pepusch with a paper for the Royal Society on ancient Greek music. George Rose, who was Treasurer of the Navy 1807 to 1818 praised him as ‚Äòamiable, honorable, temperate, and one of the sweetest dispositions I ever knew.‚Äô Described as 'tall and big', Fanny Burney described him as ‚Äòvery sociable and facetious.‚Äô Clark, Thomas Paine: Britain, America, and France in the Age of Enlightenment and Revolution; p. 46 He was a close friend of Samuel JohnsonMrs. Piozzi, Anecdotes of Johnson, pp. 50‚Äì1. and Lord Auchinleck, father of the biographer James Boswell who records Scott was 'very kind and polite to me.' One of his most important connections was the political theorist Thomas Paine, who refers to him in 1779 and whose views on George III were allegedly gained from discussions with Scott. Clark, Thomas Paine: Britain, America, and France in the Age of Enlightenment and Revolution; pp. 50-51 He also introduced him to Benjamin Franklin, an act with profound results for the US and Europe.\\"Letter to the Honorable Henry Laurens, January 14, 1779\\" in Philip A.

In March of 2020, responding to the COVID-19 pandemic, the organization launched an initiative called Keep Children Reading, and added free COVID-19-specific content to its phone-based BookSmart application. Governance Worldreader is organized as a 501c3 charitable organization in the United States, and has received a Guidestar Transparency Seal. Its U.S. Board of Directors consists of: David Risher (president), Peter Spiro (chair), Charles Brighton, Chris Capossela, Elizabeth Dollar, Kate James, Elizabeth Khuri Chandler, Colin McElwee, Lisa Nitze, Kartik Raghavan, Dana Reid, and Alison Rich. In Spain, the organization operates as a registered non-profit foundation validated by the Ministry of Education with the registration number 1361. Co-founders David Risher and Colin McElwee lead the organization from San Francisco, California and Barcelona, Spain. A mix of private social investors, corporate sponsors, and government agencies including USAID funds the organization.  Studies  The organization conducts monitoring and evaluation for impact assessment, develops reading focused out-of-classroom activities and teacher workshops by working with communities and partner organizations. Its research shows that students in the e-reader programs improved 94% in mother tongue oral reading fluency after 5 months, and girls in the e-reader programs improved twice as fast in oral reading fluency as girls in neighboring schools, closing an existing gender gap. The Worldreader iREAD 2 project was funded by an All Children Reading grant from USAID, World Vision and AusAid, aimed to improve early grade reading skills for students in Ghana. The project's final report, in November 2014, showed significant improvements in oral reading fluency, reading comprehension gains, significant impact among low-performing students and development of positive reading habits. Worldreader has shown that reading from the Worldreader Open Library is particularly popular with women, who spend on average 207 minutes reading per month, compared to 32 minutes for men. Project LEAP, a pilot program implemented by Worldreader in partnership with eight public and community libraries in western Kenya, and funded by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, examined the use of e-readers in selected libraries to determine how e-readers affect library patronage, communities, staff, policies and procedures. The primary impacts included a threefold increase in library visits, from 10,442 to 29,023 patrons per month, 254 library-initiated community events and 84% of patrons reported increased reading.

Hosted by Brazil in Rio de Janeiro from 13 to 22 June 2012, Rio+20 was a 20-year follow-up to the 1992 United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED) held in the same city, and the 10th anniversary of the 2002 World Summit on Sustainable Development (WSSD) in Johannesburg. The ten-day mega-summit, which culminated in a three-day high-level UN conference, was organized by the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs and included participation from 192 UN member states ‚Äì including 57 Heads of State and 31 Heads of Government, private sector companies, NGOs and other groups. The decision to hold the conference was made by UN General Assembly Resolution A/RES/64/236 on 24 December 2009. It was intended to be a high-level conference, including heads of state and government or other representatives and resulting in a focused political document designed to shape global environmental policy. During the final three days of the Conference, from 20 to 22 June 2012, world leaders and representatives met for intense meetings which culminated in finalizing the non-binding document, \\"The World We Want\\" which opens with \\"We the Heads of State and Government and high-level representatives\\", having met at Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, from 20 to 22 June 2012, with the full participation of civil society, renew our commitment to sustainable development and to ensuring the promotion of an economically, socially and environmentally sustainable future for our planet and for present and future generations.\\"  Background  In 1992, the first conference of its kind, the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED), commonly referred to as the Rio Conference or Earth Summit, succeeded in raising public awareness of the need to integrate environment and development. The conference drew 109 heads of state to Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, to address what were dubbed urgent problems of environmental protection and socio-economic development. The Earth Summit influenced subsequent UN conferences, including Rio+20 and set the global green agenda. \\"The World Conference on Human Rights, for example, focused on the right of people to a healthy environment and the right to development; controversial demands that had met with resistance from some Member States until the Earth Summit.\\" Major outcomes of the conference include the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) ‚Äîa climate-change agreement that led to the Kyoto Protocol, Agenda 21, the United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) and the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD). It also created new international institutions, among them the Commission on Sustainable Development, tasked with the follow-up to the Rio Conference and led to the reform of the Global Environment Facility. Ten years later, Earth Summit 2002 informally nicknamed Rio+10 was held in Johannesburg, South Africa with the goal of again bringing together leaders from government, business and NGOs to agree on a range of measures toward similar goals. At Rio+10, sustainable development was recognized as an overarching goal for institutions at the national, regional and international levels. There, the need to enhance the integration of sustainable development in the activities of all relevant United Nations agencies, programs and funds was highlighted. The discussion also encompassed the role of institutions in stepping up efforts to bridge the gap between the international financial institutions and the multilateral development banks and the rest of the UN system. Major outcomes of that conference include the Johannesburg Declaration and almost 300 international partnership initiatives meant to help achieve the Millennium Development Goals.  Objectives  The conference had three objectives‚Äîto secure renewed political commitment for sustainable development, to assess the progress and implementation gaps in meeting previous commitments, and to address new and emerging challenges.  Conference themes  The official discussions had two main themes, how to build a green economy to achieve sustainable development and lift people out of poverty, including support for developing countries that will allow them to find a green path for development; and how to improve international coordination for sustainable development by building an institutional framework.  Rio+20 formal preparatory process  In the months leading up to the beginning of the conference, negotiators held frequent informal consultations at UN headquarters in New York City, and in the two weeks before the conference was scheduled to begin, they managed to reach consensus on the sensitive language in the then proposed outcome document for the summit. According to historian Felix Dodds in his 2014 co-authored 2014 book entitled, From Rio+20 to a New Development Agenda: Building a Bridge to a Sustainable Future, the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development‚ÄîRio+20 formal preparatory process, can be divided into three phases. Phase one took place from May 2010 to January 2012‚Äîwhen preliminary intergovernmental discussions and negotiations began, and national, regional, and local level preparations were being made. This stage ended with the January 2012 publication of the draft document, \\"The Future We Want\\" The 1st Preparatory Committee was held from 16‚Äì18 May 2010, immediately after the conclusion of the eighteenth session and the first meeting of the nineteenth session of the Commission on Sustainable Development. The 1st Intersessional‚Äîwhich was not a negotiation session ‚Äì featured panel discussions, from academia, non-governmental organizations as well as Delegates and UN system representatives‚Äîwas held from 10‚Äì11 January 2011 at UN Headquarters, New York. The 2nd Preparatory Committee was held from 7‚Äì8 March 2011, at United Nations Headquarters in New York, immediately following the Intergovernmental Policy Meeting for the 19th Session of the Commission on Sustainable Development. The 2nd Intersessional was held from 15‚Äì16 December 2011 at United Nations Headquarters in New York. Phase two‚Äîfrom March 2012 to April 2012‚Äîbegan with the first informal negotiations and concluded with the April 2012 release of co-chairs streamline text of \\"The Future We Want\\". The 3rd Intersessional was held from 5‚Äì7 March 2012 at United Nations Headquarters in New York. Phase three‚Äîfrom April 9, 2012 to June 15, 2012‚Äîbegan with the second round of negotiations starting on April 9, 2012, and ending with the June 15, 2012 closing of the Third Preparatory Committee meeting, when negotiators were already in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Th three-day intense meetings with hundreds of \\"heads of states from around the world\\" met in Rio de Janeiro after the 3rd Preparatory Meeting had concluded. United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development  According to a 13 June 2012 Washington Post article, the \\"giant, 10-day- long\\" Conference underway in Rio de Janeiro which would end on June 22, 2012, was \\"expected to draw 50,000 participants, including delegates, environmental activists, business leaders, and indigenous groups.\\" For the final three days of the conference, \\"about 130 heads of state from around the world were expected to be present.\\" Billed as the biggest UN event ever organized‚Äîwith 15,000 soldiers and police guarding about 130 heads of state and government, from 192 countries, and the more than 45,000 individuals gathered in Rio de Janeiro‚Äîthe 10-day mega-conference was intended to be a high-level international gathering organized to re-direct and renew global political commitment to the three dimensions of sustainable development: economic growth, social improvement and environmental protection; focusing on reducing poverty while promoting jobs growth, clean energy and more fair, sustainable uses of resources; goals first established at Earth Summit in 1992. The conference centered around Agenda 21, the outcome document from Earth Summit 1992. That document was considered revolutionary in that it essentially created the term sustainable development and created the global environmental agenda for the next 20 years. The representatives of participating governments gathered in Rio to discuss what was then the draft text of the outcome document. Rio+20 sought to secure affirmations for the political commitments made at past Earth Summits and set the global environmental agenda for the next 20 years by assessing progress towards the goals set forth in Agenda 21 and implementation gaps therein, and discussing new and emerging issues. The UN wanted Rio to endorse a UN \\"green economy roadmap\\", with environmental goals, targets and deadlines, whereas developing countries preferred establishing new \\"sustainable development goals\\" to better protect the environment, guarantee food and power to the poorest, and alleviate poverty. Rio+20 attracted many protests, and more than 500 parallel events, exhibitions, presentations, fairs and announcements as a wide range of diverse groups struggled to take advantage of the conference in order to gain international attention. The British online newspaper, The Guardian reported that, \\"Downtown Rio de Janeiro was partly shut-down as an estimated 50,000 protesters, some of whom were naked, took to the streets.\\" = The future we want = From 20 to 22 June 2012, world leaders and representatives met for intense meetings which culminated in finalizing the non-binding document, \\"The Future We Want: Outcome document of the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, 20‚Äì22 June 2012\\", which opens with, \\"We the Heads of State and Government and high-level representatives\\", having met at Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, from 20 to 22 June 2012, with the full participation of civil society, renew our commitment to sustainable development and to ensuring the promotion of an economically, socially and environmentally sustainable future for our planet and for present and future generations.\\" The first draft of the document was released in January 2012 as a result of preliminary intergovernmental discussions and negotiations that had taken place since May 2010. A streamlined version of \\"The Future We Want\\", was released on April 2012 following the second phase of negotiations. At the Rio+20 Conference in June 2012, the heads of state of the 192 governments in attendance, renewed their political commitment to sustainable development and declared their commitment to the promotion of a sustainable future through the 49-page nonbinding document, \\"The Future We Want: Outcome document of the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, 20‚Äì22 June 2012.\\" The dates June 20 to 22 reflect the three-day meeting of world leaders, the culmination of Rio+20. The document largely reaffirms previous action plans like Agenda 21. The document, \\"The Future We Want,\\" called for the development of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), a set of measurable targets aimed at promoting sustainable development globally. It is thought that the SDGs [would] pick up where the Millennium Development Goals leave off and address criticism that the original Goals fail to address the role of the environment in development.\\" There were eight key recommendations regarding the UN Environment Programme (UNEP) , which included strengthening its governance to potentially become, a \\"leading global environmental authority\\", through universal membership, increasing its financial resources and strengthening its engagement in key UN coordination bodies. According to a 23 June 2012 The Guardian article, nations agreed to explore alternatives to GDP as a measure of wealth that take environmental and social factors into account in an effort to assess and pay for 'environmental services' provided by nature, such as carbon sequestration and habitat protection. Recognition that \\"fundamental changes in the way societies consume and produce are indispensable for achieving global sustainable development.\\" EU officials suggest it could lead to a shift of taxes so workers pay less and polluters and landfill operators pay more. The document calls the need to return ocean stocks to sustainable levels \\"urgent\\" and calls on countries to develop and implement science-based management plans. All nations reaffirmed commitments to phase out fossil fuel subsidies. In addition to the outcome text, there were over 400 voluntary commitments for sustainable development made by Member States. At the African Ministerial Conference on the Environment, 40 African countries agreed to implement \\"The Future We Want.\\" Leaders in attendance World leaders in attendance at Rio+20 A few key global leaders‚Äîmostly G20 leaders and namely United States President Barack Obama, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, and UK Prime Minister David Cameron‚Äîdid not attend the conference and blamed their absence on the ongoing European sovereign-debt crisis. Their collective absence was seen as a reflection of their administrations' failure to prioritize sustainability issues. \\"In not attending, the prime minister is sending out a powerful signal that the UK government does not see sustainability as a priority\\", Joan Walley, chair of the UK environmental audit committee said to The Guardian. * Albania ‚Äì Prime Minister Sali Berisha * Antigua & Barbuda ‚Äì Prime Minister Baldwin Spencer * Argentina ‚Äì President Cristina Fern√°ndez de Kirchner * Australia ‚Äì Prime Minister Julia Gillard * Bolivia ‚Äì President Evo Morales, see Bolivian government proposal Harmony with nature * Brazil ‚Äì President Dilma Rousseff * Bulgaria ‚Äì President Rosen Plevneliev * Chile ‚Äì President Sebasti√°n Pi√±era * China ‚Äì Premier Wen Jiabao * Costa Rica ‚Äì President Laura Chinchilla Miranda * Denmark ‚Äì Prime Minister Helle Thorning-Schmidt * Ecuador ‚Äì President Rafael Correa * France ‚Äì President Francois Hollande * Grenada ‚Äì Prime Minister Tillman Thomas * Haiti ‚Äì President Michel Martelly * India ‚Äì Prime Minister Manmohan Singh * Indonesia ‚Äì President Susilo Yudhoyono * Iran ‚Äì President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad * Lithuania ‚Äì President Dalia Grybauskaitƒó * Nepal ‚Äì Prime Minister Baburam Bhattarai * Nigeria ‚Äì President Goodluck Jonathan * Norway ‚Äì Prime Minister Jens Stoltenberg * Portugal ‚Äì Prime Minister Pedro Passos Coelho * Russia ‚Äì President Dmitry Medvedev * South Africa ‚Äì President Jacob Zuma * South Korea ‚Äì President Lee Myung bak * Spain ‚Äì Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy * Sri Lanka ‚Äì President Mahinda Rajapaksa * Sweden ‚Äì Prime Minister Fredrik Reinfeldt * Turkmenistan ‚Äì President Gurbanguly Berdimuhamedow * Uruguay ‚Äì President Jose Mujica * Zimbabwe ‚Äì President Robert Mugabe among others Environmental and Indigenous Rights Activists Demonstration at Rio+20. Picture shows effigy of Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff with a chainsaw and embracing a replica of the Statue of Liberty. Activists took initiative at Rio+20 by staging numerous protests. Activists joined forces to stand up to what they said was exploitation and degradation of the Earth, as well as the negation of the rights of indigenous peoples. National Geographic said that activists that support protecting the environment, are particularly relevant in Brazil, as deforestation threatens Amazonian ethnic groups everyday. In addition to holding signs and shouting chants, the crowds took a theatric route to convey their messages. Firstly, they poked at Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff, claiming she has given in to the global North's corporate hand. Rousseff's controversy has arisen over her steadfast desire to further industrialize Brazil, and its economy. Additionally, the crowds assembled for a ritual and symbolic \\"tearing up\\" of the plenary's negotiated text, conveying their disapproval. Thousands of non-governmental organizations (NGOs) gathered at the Flamengo Park in Rio. They criticized the draft negotiating text, particularly for its failure to mention planetary boundaries or nuclear energy, in light of the Fukushima disaster in Japan. Organizations, such as Greenpeace and the World Wide Fund for Nature, as well as members of indigenous communities, activists and artists participated. The Danish artist Jens Galschi√∏t, the leader of the group AIDOH, and the Group 92 used his Freedom to Pollute sculptures to focus on global warming and its resulting increased flow of refugees. About 20,000 flyers about Freedom to Pollute were distributed during Rio+20 and a related television program was produced in Denmark. Demonstration against the President of Iran Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.There were some demonstrations protesting the participation of the President of Iran Mahmoud Ahmadinejad along with the Iranian delegation. The controversy of Iranian attendance at the summit surrounds the fact that Iran has serious environmental issues, which it has refused to address, continuing human rights violations and is refusing to cooperate with the IAEA over its contentious nuclear program. Ahmadinejad was met with demonstrations, attended by thousands of people, on his 20 June arrival in Rio, with some protesters waving banners with the slogan \\"Ahmadinejad go home\\". Participation by Civil Societies RIO +20 Logo in Hindi created by CCLP Worldwide Team During RIO +20 event and preparatory events UNCSD included Civil Societies invited to organize side events, promote the RIO event, submit literature and help the Rio secretariat with translation work. The logo and promotion of RIO +20 was available in languages used in United Nations. Civil societies also translated the logo image and literature in other local and National languages. ProjectEarth Network Ecology and Environment Inc., a New York-based Environmental Engineering and Consultation company partnered with UNCSD to create Project Earth Network, an online platform where schools around the world could showcase their remarkable environmental projects. In coordination with the Rio+20 event, the platform hosted a World Environment Day Global School Contest in which 7th graders at the International School of Ulaanbaatar (ISU) in Mongolia were declared the Global Winners for their awareness campaign on the environmental impact of plastic shopping bags, including research on plastic bag manufacturing processes, development of videos documenting plastic bag waste, and a school presentation at which reusable cloth shopping bags were sold to approximately 50 percent of the community. Sarasota, Fla.'s Brookside Middle School won in the World Environment Day contest's North American sub-category for its mangrove propagule growth project while International School of Brussels in Belgium won the European sub-category, for their creation of a sustainable food source and composting program. The Middle-Eastern sub-category winner was Hridith Sudev, a seventh grader from Indian School Salalah in Oman for his organization, 'Project GreenWorld International' which helped promote sustainable awareness across the region through interactive projects. Hridith Sudev later went on to become an inventor and the organization has become a global environmental presence. The World Environment Day contest followed an Earth Day \\"Green Schools\\" contest regionally focused toward 6th to 12th grade students in the Western New York area. The idea behind the platform was to encourage sustainability in students across the world. Despite the huge response, the platform was taken down two years later due to technical and economic constraints but has since remained as a positive legacy through the activities of students who were first recognized by the network.

Fran√ßois Rochebrune (Polish: Franciszek Rochebrune) (born 1 June or 1 January 1830, died 19 November 1870 (some sources state 1871)) was a French soldier. He was born to an impoverished family. He served in the French Zouaves during the Crimean War. He then lived in Poland for two years as a tutor. He returned to the French Zouaves for five years, serving as a sergeant in China. He then returned to live in Poland once again in 1862. When the Polish rebellion against Russian rule began in January 1863, he formed and led a Polish rebel unit called the Zouaves of Death. Within months, he had been promoted to general. After the collapse of the uprising, he returned to France, where his exploits in Poland earned him the rank of captain in the French army. He was promoted to colonel for the Franco-Prussian War, and was killed by a sniper at the Battle of Montretout at the age of forty. Biography Rochebrune was born in Vienne in Is√®re, France, to an impoverished family. When he was fourteen he began an apprenticeship in a printer's shop. He then joined the French Army. He served in the 17th Regiment of Line Infantry and, during the Crimean War, in the Zouaves formation. ‚Äû≈ªuawi ≈ömierci‚Äù w Powstaniu Styczniowym. From 1855 to 1857 he taught French to local gentry (szlachta) in Krak√≥w, Austrian partition of Poland. In 1857 he was a sergeant during the Franco-British expedition to China. He left French service and in 1862 moved to Warsaw, at the time part of the Russian-controlled Congress Poland. A short while later he moved on to Krak√≥w, where he opened a fencing school. The school soon became a sort of military academy (the only one of its kind in the Austrian partition of Poland), which ended up training many of the future Polish officers of the January Uprising. When the January Uprising broke out in 1863, Rochebrune volunteered his services to the leaders of the uprising and together with some of the students from his fencing school reported to an insurrectionist camp at Ojc√≥w organized by Apolinary Kurowski. There, based on his experience in the French Zouaves, Rochebrune formed the units that came to be known as the Zouaves of Death. Their first military engagement occurred at the Battle of Miechow, on 17 February, where Rochebrune himself led a bayonet charge on Russian positions. The unit suffered very high casualties, and although its own attack was successful the overall battle was a loss for the Polish forces. After the battle, Rochebrune began writing his name as \\"de Rochebrune\\". He reorganized the Zouaves of Death in Krak√≥w and led them in battles of Chrobrze and Grochowiska. In the latter engagement, after General Marian Langiewicz lost control over the Polish forces, Rochebrune, with the help of his Zouaves, took command and restored order, by personally grabbing panicked soldiers, throwing them back into the line, pointing his gun at them and cursing in broken Polish (\\"Psiakehv! Ktoha godzina?\\" ‚Äì \\"God dammit! Would you tell me the time?\\" ‚Äì which according to contemporary sources was the only Polish he knew).Jerzy Kowalczyk, \\"Grochowiska\\", Webpage of Muzeum Historii Kielc (Museum of History of Kielce). Last accessed 15 January 2010. He then led a successful attack of his zouaves and \\"kosynierzy\\" troops, forcing the Russians to flee. As a result, after the battle he was promoted to general. His candidacy was considered for the Uprising commander-in-chief. It was rejected, and Rocherbrune, disappointed with the political infighting, left temporarily for France. He returned later that year, and fought in Wo≈Çy≈Ñ, taking part in the lost Battle of Poryck. In France, for his valor in the Uprising, which was a popular cause among the French public, he was awarded Legion of Honour and promoted to the rank of captain. He rejoined the French Army, and later fought in the Franco-Prussian War in 1870. He commanded a unit nicknamed les Gaulois (the Gauls), and wore the Zouaves uniform. He died on 19 November 1870 Battle of Montretout as a colonel attached to the 19th French National Guards.

He started playing water polo in 1958 as a child in club Jedinstvo from Zadar. His debut in a first league game was in 1963 (as 15 years old), for VK Jadran Split against HAVK Mladost. Although his desire was to study at the Academy of Fine Arts (and continued to paint), he initially studied architecture in Zagreb, but as professional player moved to Belgrade in 1971, and there finished studies at the Faculty of Physical Education. He lived in Belgrade until 1990, when lived and worked in Rome until 2000, and from then until 2004 in Los Angeles. He has a daughter Martina who is a cellist in Milan. Playing career He played for club VK Jadran Split from 1963 till 1971, when moved to VK Partizan. He decided for the club because it was the only alongside HAVK Mladost from Zagreb which had full year training, and several other Croatian players were brought in the same year, as well the coach from Dubrovnik. With the team won eight Yugoslavian championships, six Yugoslavian cups, and two European Champions League in 1974 and 1975. Rudiƒá played 297 games for the Yugoslavian water polo team, winning gold medals in 1971 and 1979, and silver medal at the 1975 Mediterranean Games; bronze medals in 1970 and 1974, and silver medal at the 1977 European Championship; bronze medal at the 1973 World Championship; and silver medal at the 1980 Summer Olympics. At the 1968 Olympics he was injured before the tournament and was unable to play with his team which went on to win the gold medal. At the World Championship in 1975, he was falsely accused of doping, and so the entire Yugoslav national team was disqualified. Only after a subsequent investigation by Manfred Donike proved that Rudiƒá did not take any banned substances, he and his team were exonerated. His case was included in professional literature as an example of the wrong analysis. At the 1976 Olympics was a reserve due to injury, but helped tactically and soon became assistant coach in VK Partizan. Coaching career During his career Rudiƒá coached five national teams: Yugoslavia (1984‚Äì1988), Italy (1990‚Äì2000), USA (2001‚Äì2004), Croatia (2005‚Äì2012), and Brazil (2013‚Äì2016). As a coach he works with much preparation, including control training, testing, tactics, and technique. He is one of the first coaches who had a multidisciplinary coaching staff, with specific emphasis on cooperation with psychologists. He especially works on the long-term programmes which leave behind long-term positive consequences in the national teams. Rudiƒá is the most successful water polo coach in Olympic history. He led three different men's national teams to win four gold medals and one bronze medal at the Summer Olympics. He is one of a few sportspeople who won Olympic medals in water polo as players and head coaches. =Yugoslavia= Rudiƒá started his coaching career as the coach of juniors in VK Partizan between 1980 and 1983, and between 1983 and 1984 of the Yugoslavian junior national team, which won silver medals at the World (1983) and European Championship (1983, 1984). Several players like Dubravko ≈†imenc, Perica Bukiƒá, and Igor Milanoviƒá formed the core in the following Yugoslavian golden period. He received the nickname Tiranin (Tyrant) because he demanded a considerable amount of work and discipline. He was the coach of the Yugoslavia men's national water polo team between 1984 and 1988, and won two consecutive gold medals at the 1984 and 1988 Summer Olympics; gold medal at the 1986 World Championship; two consecutive silver medals at the 1985 and 1987 European Water Polo Championship; and gold medal at the 1987 World Cup. =Italy= After the coach position at VK Partizan between 1988 and 1990 (COMEN Cup), in 1990 he became the coach of Italy. His work in Italy initially was in the conflict with the players who had tactical and technical skills but lack of physical working philosophy. As the very strenuous trainings were accepted they eventually became the best national team at the time. They were the first national team to win all titles in one Olympic cycle. In 1994, after the gold medal at the 1994 World Championship, changed almost the whole team with younger players which was received with harsh criticism by the sport journalist in Italy, but nevertheless won gold medal at the 1995 European Championship. The period as the coach of the Italian national team, however, ended in controversy: at the end of the quarterfinals of the 2000 Summer Olympics in which Italy lost against Hungary 5‚Äì8, Rudiƒá reportedly accused the officials for a planned conspiracy against the Italian team (due to referee decisions), which cost him a yearly suspension from all competitions by FINA. As the coach of Italy men's national water polo team he won gold medal at the 1992, and bronze at the 1996 Summer Olympics; gold medal at the 1994 World Championship; gold medals at the 1993 and 1995, and bronze at the 1999 European Championship; gold medal at 1993, and silver medals at the 1995 and 1999 World Cup. =United States= Rudiƒá lived and worked as the coach in the United States from January 2001 until 2004. As water polo in USA was mostly a Southern California college level sport, Rudiƒá recalls that the initial organization and competition system was in bad condition, with small number of players, and the first years were the hardest part of his career. He praised the work ethic in USA compared to other teams which helped his stay, and several players like Wolf Wigo and Tony Azevedo acknowledged his method of work. He organized the entire professional work in their association, which included working with youth categories, the selection and training of trainers, selection of players, and their preparation. As the coach of United States men's national water polo team he won a gold medal at the 2003 Pan American Games; and bronze medal at the 2003 World League. Although there was a strategic programme by Rudiƒá titled Project Gold to take the team through the 2008 Summer Olympics, and signed four-year contract before the 2004 Olympics, in the late 2004 on the behalf of the President of Croatia Stjepan Mesiƒá accepted the new coaching mission. However, in the USA they continued to work by his programme and won the silver medal at the 2008 Olympics. =Croatia= According to Rudiƒá surprisingly the most motivational work on cohesion inside and outside the national team had to do in Croatia. He was critical of the poor funding considering the results achieved by the team in comparison with football. By the Croatian Olympic Committee was awarded for the most successful Croatian coach in 2007, and 2012. As the coach of Croatia men's national water polo team he won gold medal at the 2012 Summer Olympics; gold medal at 2007, and bronze medals at the 2009 and 2011 World Championship; gold medal at the 2010 European Championship; silver medal at the 2010 World Cup; silver medal at 2009, bronze at 2010 and 2011, and gold at the 2012 World League. =Brazil= Rudiƒá became the coach of Brazil men's national water polo team in November 2013. He led the team to the bronze medal at the 2015 World League; and silver medal at the 2015 Pan American Games. He was awarded for the best coach of the Olympic Committee of the host country of the Olympic Games. Brazil have been drawn into Group A of the Olympic competition, alongside Australia, Greece, Hungary, Japan, and Serbia. They won against Serbia 6-5, who were unbeaten more than two years. =Pro Recco= Rudiƒá returned once again from retirement in June 2018, as 70 years old, when became the coach of Italian water polo club Pro Recco. Coaching style It is considered that Rudiƒá is the most responsible for the contemporary water polo playing style, although did not invent it. Rudiƒá is an heir of the Yugoslavian system and style, and due to his success many coaches tried to adopt his methods and style. However, Dante Dettamanti criticized the style for being too static and vertical, which is best suited for the physically big sized players. The style favors size aspect rather than speed. Another product of the system is the long and torturous training sessions, for which Rudiƒá is also famous. It includes 8 hours a day of swimming in the pool, heavy style weight lifting sessions, leg work, and skill and tactical sessions. United States player Layne Beaubien recalls that in the American colleges a daily norm was 3,000 meters, while under Rudiƒá initially 5,000 and later up to 18,000 meters, noting \\"it's all mental. That's all it is. That's why he makes us do it. Being able to push yourself when you're so tired, being able to push yourself to the next level\\". As Ricardo Azevedo noted, \\"if a player quits in practice, he will eventually quit in a game\\". Dettamanti considered that such methods are unnecessary for the international water polo, and that Rudiƒá's success is rather the result of his game knowledge, teaching of skills and tactics.

Life Brodie was born at Winterslow, Wiltshire, on 20 August 1778, being the eldest son of the Rev. Peter Bellinger Brodie, rector of Winterslow 1742-1804, who died 19 March 1804, by his marriage in 1775 with Sarah, third daughter of Benjamin Collins of Milford, Salisbury, who died 7 January 1847. He early chose law as a profession, but in consequence of an asthmatic complaint, he devoted himself to conveyancing, and became a pupil of Charles Butler. He was called to the bar at the Inner Temple on 5 May 1815. His share of business placed him in a few years amongst the most eminent conveyancers of the time. One of the drafts by which he was earliest known was that of the Rock Life Assurance Company, 1806, a model for similar instruments, and only departed from where some variation was rendered necessary, as in the charter of King's College, London, which he also drew in 1829. With the history of law amendment Brodie's name is intimately connected. He was one of the real property commissioners in 1828, and took a leading part. Their first report, which was made in May 1829, examined fines and recoveries; this part of the report was drawn up by Brodie, as was also the portion of the second report, June 1830, relating to the probate of wills, and the part of the third report, May 1832, relating to copyhold and ancient demesne. The fourth report was made in April 1833, and no part of this was prepared by him. Soon after the presentation of the first report it was determined to bring in bills founded upon its recommendations, and Brodie prepared that for abolishing fines and recoveries, which was brought in at the end of the session 1830, and became law in 1838. Lord St. Leonards, in his work on the 'Real Property Statutes,' praised the drafting of this act. Brodie died at 49 Lincoln's Inn Fields, London, on 8 September 1854. Works He was the author of a A Treatise on a Tax on Successions to Real as well as Personal Property, and the Removal of the House-tax, as Substitutes for the Income-tax, and on Burdens on Land and Restrictions on Commerce and Loans of Money, 1850. Family He was twice married: first, on 16 March 1810, to Elizabeth Mary, daughter of Sutton Thomas Wood of Oxford‚Äîshe died on 9 May 1825; secondly, on 1 June 1826, to Susan Mary, daughter of John Morgan. She died in London on 4 December 1870. Sir Benjamin Collins Brodie, 1st Baronet was his brother.

Life Brodrick entered the navy about 1723. In 1739 he was a lieutenant of , Admiral Edward Vernon's flagship at the Battle of Porto Bello, and commanded the landing party which stormed the Castillo de Fierro. In recompense for his brilliant conduct Vernon promoted him to the command of the fireship , in which he in 1741 took part in the Battle of Cartagena de Indias. On 25 March 1741 he was \\"posted\\" (i.e. made Post Captain) into the frigate , and continued actively employed during the rest of that campaign, and afterwards in the expedition to Cuba. After other service he returned to England in 1743, and early in the following year was appointed to the 60-gun . In March of the following year he was appointed to , which was sent out to the Leeward Islands, and continued there until after the peace in 1748. In May 1756 Brodrick was sent out to the Mediterranean in command of reinforcements for Admiral John Byng, whom he joined at Gibraltar just before the admiral was ordered home under arrest. He had meantime been advanced on 4 June to the rank of Rear admiral, in which rank he served under Sir Edward Hawke until towards the close of the year, when the fleet returned home. In January 1757 he was a member of the court-martial on Admiral Byng; and was afterwards, with his flag in , third in command in the expedition against Rochefort. Early in 1758 Brodrick was appointed as second in command in the Mediterranean, with his flag on board the 90-gun HMS Prince George. On 13 April, being then off Ushant, the Prince George caught fire, and out of a complement of nearly 800, some 250 only were saved; the Rear admiral himself was picked up, stark naked, by a merchant-ship's boat, after he had been swimming for about an hour. Brodrick and the survivors of his ship's company were taken by to Gibraltar, where he hoisted his flag in HMS St George. On the following 14 February (1759) he was promoted to the rank of Vice admiral, and was shortly afterwards superseded by Admiral Edward Boscawen, under whom he commanded during the blockade of Toulon, and in the action of 18‚Äì19 August, culminating in the burning or capture of the French ships in Lagos Bay. When Boscawen returned to England, Brodrick blockaded the French ships at Cadiz so closely, that even the friendly Spaniards could not resist making them the subject of insolent ridicule. They are said to have stuck up a notice in some such terms as \\"For sale, eight French men-of-war. For particulars apply to Vice-admiral Brodrick\\". The French ships did not stir out till the passage was cleared for them by a gale of wind, which compelled the blockading squadron to put into Gibraltar. Brodrick then returned to England. He had no further employment, and died 1 January 1769 of cancer in the face.

Proc. in formal legal citations or just CCP in treatises and other less formal contexts) was enacted by the California State Legislature in March 1872 as the general codification of the law of civil procedure in the U.S. state of California, along with the three other original California Codes. It contains most California statutes that govern the filing and litigation of lawsuits in the Superior Courts of California, as well as legal notices that must be given in a variety of circumstances. It also includes statutes of limitations that control the period of time during which a lawsuit must be commenced. It also contained some statutes governing the legal profession, but those were later relocated into the Business and Professions Code. Originally, the CCP was the codification of the Practice Act of 1851, as amended and revised. In turn, the Practice Act had been modeled after the New York Code of Civil Procedure of 1850, which was largely drafted by the law reformer David Dudley Field II. Hence, California is considered to be a \\"Field Code\\" state. The CCP also partially codified the law of evidence, but in 1965, the evidentiary provisions were repealed and replaced by the new California Evidence Code, which unlike the CCP, was deliberately intended to displace and supersede the common law of evidence. Like the 28 other California Codes, the CCP is frequently amended by the Legislature. Unlike most other states, California never followed the federal trend towards transferring authority over procedural law to the courts through statutes like the federal Rules Enabling Act. Instead, the California Rules of Court (CRC) cover only relatively minor matters such as the formatting of court papers and case management rules implementing the Trial Court Delay Reduction Act of 1986. Nearly all important procedural provisions (i.e., the ones that can make or break a case) continue to exist in the form of CCP sections. As a result, whenever the Judicial Council of California identifies a major defect in California civil procedure, it cannot fix it by promulgating a new court rule, but must instead lobby the Legislature and Governor to amend the CCP. Today, the CCP is comprehensive only with regard to trial court procedure. As a result of a bill pushed through the Legislature at the suggestion of Chief Justice Phil S. Gibson in 1941, appellate procedure in California is governed primarily by the CRC. As a Field Code state, California continues to subscribe to the \\"primary right\\" or \\"ultimate fact\\" theory of pleading (also known as \\"fact pleading\\") which has been traditionally followed by Field Code states. This means that California adheres to an arcane distinction between what constitutes pleading of a mere \\"fact,\\" versus an \\"ultimate fact,\\" versus a \\"conclusion of law.\\"Perry v. Robertson, 201 Cal. App. 3d 333, 339 n.3 (1988). Also, California is one of two states, along with Virginia, which uses the demurrer as the primary pre- answer attack on the complaint. Most states and the federal courts have switched to modern \\"notice pleading\\" and use the motion to dismiss for failure to state a cause of action instead of the demurrer.

Following the three voyages of James Cook, French King Louis XVI had commanded a similar expedition be sent out by France. The La P√©rouse expedition consisted of the frigates La Boussole, the flagship with Collignon in the crew, and L‚ÄôAstrolabe under the command of Fleuriot de Langle. The two ships left Brest on the 1 August 1785 and were last seen at Botany Bay, New Holland on 26 January 1788. Collignon was born in Metz, France in 1762. He was recommended for the voyage by Andr√© Thouin, Director of Horticulture at the Jardin du Roi. Collignon was just 24 and had previously only worked under the direction of Thouin, who judged him as \\"active and intelligent\\". Thouin in his recommendation emphasised that Collignon should not be subordinate to the expedition's botanist, Joseph Hugues Boissieu La Martini√®re, and so the two were assigned to different ships. Collignon was permitted to assist the other naturalists provided this did not interfere with his principal mission. The expedition The ships anchored at the fertile Catherine Island off the southern coast of Brazil on 6 November 1785, and after a welcome reception, Collignon took on board orange and lemon trees to join the other live plants he had gathered for the South Seas: he also took on cotton, rice, maize and other staples of the tropics. The expedition anchored on Easter Island on 9 April 1786 and was able to land goats, ewes and pigs that had been purchased at the port of Concepcion, Chile. After viewing native plantations of yams and sweet potatoes Collignon judged the soil suitable for planting seed and he explained to the natives that the seed would produce plants that were good to eat. They appeared to understand, indicating where they thought the plants would grow best. He planted cabbage, carrots, beets, maize and pumpkins. On 29 May 1786 the ship anchored at Maui in the Hawaiian archipelago; knowing of Cook‚Äôs fate, the ships stayed for just 24 hours, allowing only a brief period for Collignon to plant seed. In mid September 1786, the ship landed at Monterey. The soil was very fertile and Collignon gave seed to the Spanish governor and to the local mission. He also gave them potatoes that had been gathered in Chile and were still in good condition. Some of the plants collected at Monterey and Macao would be sent back to Thouin. The visit to Monterey marked the beginning of the botanical exploration of the Trans- Mississippi West although the true range of his collections is uncertain. In December the ship landed in Samoan waters, where Lamartini√®re and Collignon botanized on several islands, the natives demanding a glass bead for every plant collected, and on one occasion threatening Lamartini√®re when he threatened to not pay. The ship left on 23 December 1787.

Biography Nhek Dim was born on February 12, 1934 in Reap village, Reap commune, Pea Reang District, in Prey Veng Province, Cambodia. His parents, Nhek Pidaou and Prom Pul, were prosperous farmers. From childhood he showed a remarkable talent in drawing, and he loved to paint. He finished elementary school in 1949. Because of his obvious talent, his parents sent him to the School of Cambodian Arts (now the Department of Plastic Arts of the Royal University of Fine Arts) in Phnom Penh. There he studied \\"traditional painting\\". He graduated in 1954 and started to work at the US Embassy in Phnom Penh. He married Mao Samen, and they had six children: three girls, who all died at an early age, and three boys. In 1957 he went for six months to the Philippines to draw and publish books. From 1963 to 1967 he resided in the United States to study cartoon filmmaking. His cartoon \\"The Wise Rabbit\\" won a 1967 student competition organized by Walt Disney. Later, former King of Cambodia Norodom Sihanouk asked him to make paintings to illustrate a book of songs written by the ex-King. Occasionally he drew satirical cartoons that were published in several magazines. He owned his own gallery where he exhibited his old paintings and water colors. Besides painting and drawing he was also the author of several novels, and composer of many songs. He was a close friend of Sinn Sisamouth, although for some time they were not on speaking terms. Nhek Dim died on December 16, 1978, as one more artist who didn't survive the Khmer Rouge regime. He left a wife and three sons. Subjects and Style Nhek Dim's works ‚Äì sometimes realistic, sometimes more stylized ‚Äì often depict traditional Cambodian landscapes, tourist sites like Angkor and Kampot's Tek Chhou, and Khmer and native people. He also painted many portraits of Cambodian pop stars, like Sinn Sisamouth, Ros Sereysothea, Pan Ron and Huoy Meas, for the covers of their records. He was especially skilled at painting remarkably lifelike people and their faces. Some critics have argued that Nhek Dim epitomized the dreams of modernization of Cambodia promoted by Sihanouk in the 1960s. He used a new artistic language even when portraying traditional Cambodian scenes, ‚Äúsmoked and drank as he painted representing a ‚ÄòBohemian‚Äô ideal familiar from Sihanouk‚Äôs films,‚Äù and operated in the 1960s as an artist-businessman, offering his paintings both in his gallery and in shops selling luxury goods.Roger Nelson, ‚Äú'The Work the Nation Depends On': Landscapes and Women in the Paintings of Nhek Dim,‚Äù in Ambitious Alignments: New Histories of Southeast Asian Art, 1945-1990, ed. by Stephen H Whiteman, Sarena Abdullah, Yvonne Low, and Phoebe Scott, Singapore and Sydney: National Gallery Singapore and Power Publications, 2018, 19‚Äì48 (40).

It was released in Europe on 28 March 2011, and released in the US on 19 April 2011, as a digi-book CD and heavyweight vinyl limited to 2000 individually numbered copies. Background Almost all of the songs were written by Geffen, as Wilson had been working on his second solo album, Grace for Drowning, at the same time. The album's title, Welcome to My DNA, was meant to reflect Geffen's taking over creative control for the band.http://www.porcupinetree.it/index.php?section=441 The musicians worked on the material together in studios in England and Israel. It marked the first time they used a real orchestra in recording. All tracks were produced by Wilson and Geffen, except for \\"Oxygen\\", which was produced by Trevor Horn. \\"Zigota\\" is a reworking of the track of the same name on Geffen's 2002 solo album Memento Mori. The album's first and only single was \\"Waving\\", which received a music video on 21 March 2011http://www.nme.com/nme- video/youtube/id/hDKqF_2zgN0/search/the-waving-tree and a formal single release in the US on 11 April. but did not chart on any charts. However, the opening track, \\"Glass House\\", acted as a promotional single and was made available to download prior to the album's release. Reception The album has received generally mixed reviews. AllMusic described the album as \\"neo- progressive Pink Floyd-meets-Tears for Fears\\", though conceded that \\"the music aims toward a majestic simplicity that it sometimes achieves\\".https://www.allmusic.com/album/welcome-to-my-dna-mw0002114185 Reflections of Darkness stated it was \\"...a sophisticated and diverse pop/rock album and highly recommended\\". Sea of Tranquility also praised the album, stating that it was the band's \\"...most diverse, experimental, and textured release\\". Praise was given to Wilson for his production on the album and his solo contribution to the album \\"Waving\\". Other reviewers were more critical. PopMatters stated that \\"...despite some signature characteristics of Blackfield that are present on DNA, Wilson‚Äôs choice to step back and let Geffen dominate the show had ramifications on the identity of the project itself...The old waters are beginning to run only faintly through.\\"http://www.popmatters.com/pm/review/174767-blackfield-iv/ Many critics also panned the limited and weak lyrics in some tracks, most notably Geffen's track \\"Go to Hell\\" The album peaked at No. 139 on the UK charts.http://www.zobbel.de/cluk/110409cluk.txt Track listing Personnel ;Band * Steven Wilson ‚Äì vocals, guitars, keyboards, string arrangements on \\"Waving\\" and \\"Dissolving with the Night\\" * Aviv Geffen ‚Äì vocals, guitars, keyboards, string arrangements on all tracks except \\"Waving\\"; \\"Dissolving with the Night\\" co-arranged with Wilson * Eran Mitelman ‚Äì piano, keyboards * Seffy Efrat ‚Äì bass * Tomer Z ‚Äì drums = Guest musicians = * Yankale Segal - Tar lute, Oud, Baglama on \\"Blood\\" * Trevor Horn - additional keyboards and production on \\"Oxygen\\" References External links *Welcome to my DNA website Category:2011 albums Category:Blackfield albums Category:Kscope albums ","title":"Welcome to My DNA"},{"id":"30481317","text":"Mishchenko () is a Ukrainian surname, and may refer to: * Aleksandr Mishchenko (born 1997), German-Kyrgyz footballer * Anna Mishchenko (born 1983), Ukrainian middle distance runner * Maksim Mishchenko, Russian politician * Mikhail Mishchenko (born 1989), Russian footballer * Oleh Mishchenko (born 1989), Ukrainian footballer * Olga Mishchenko (born 1971), retired Ukrainian sprinter * Olia Mishchenko (born 1980), Canadian artist * Pavel Mishchenko (1853‚Äì1918), career military officer and statesman in the Russian Empire * Sergei Mishchenko (born 1961), retired Kazakh footballer * Syla Mishchenko (1897‚Äì1941), Ukrainian military officer * Vitaliy Mishchenko (born 1975), Ukrainian footballer See also * 22686 Mishchenko, minor planet Category:Ukrainian-language surnames ","title":"Mishchenko"},{"id":"30481341","text":"Meadow Gold Dairies may refer to: *Meadow Gold Dairies (Hawaii), a historic dairy business in Hawaii *A division of Dean Foods ","title":"Meadow Gold Dairies"},{"id":"30481343","text":"Value Plastics is a designer, manufacturer, and global distributor of plastic tubing components used mainly in medical device, biotech, and industrial applications.

Land grabbing is the contentious issue of large-scale land acquisitions: the buying or leasing of large pieces of land by domestic and transnational companies, governments, and individuals. While used broadly throughout history, land grabbing as used in the 21st century primarily refers to large-scale land acquisitions following the 2007‚Äì08 world food price crisis. Obtaining water resources is usually critical to the land acquisitions, so it has also led to an associated trend of water grabbing.Maria Cristina Rullia, Antonio Savioria, and Paolo D‚ÄôOdorico, Global Land and Water Grabbing, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences 110, no. 3 (2013): 892‚Äì97. By prompting food security fears within the developed world and new found economic opportunities for agricultural investors, the food price crisis caused a dramatic spike in large-scale agricultural investments, primarily foreign, in the Global South for the purpose of industrial food and biofuels production. Although hailed by investors, economists and some developing countries as a new pathway towards agricultural development, investment in land in the 21st century has been criticized by some non-governmental organizations and commentators as having a negative impact on local communities. International law is implicated when attempting to regulate these transactions.Lea Brilmayer and William J. Moon, Regulating Land Grabs: Third Party States, Social Activism, and International Law, book chapter in Rethinking Food Systems, February 2014  Definition  The term \\"land grabbing\\" is defined as very large-scale land acquisitions, either buying or leasing. The size of the land deal is multiples of or and thus much larger than in the past. The term is itself controversial. In 2011, Borras, Hall and others wrote that \\"the phrase 'global land grab' has become a catch- all to describe and analyze the current trend towards scale (trans)national commercial land transactions.\\" Ruth Hall wrote elsewhere that the \\"term 'land grabbing', while effective as activist terminology, obscures vast differences in the legality, structure, and outcomes of commercial land deals and deflects attention from the roles of domestic elites and governments as partners, intermediaries, and beneficiaries.\\" In Portuguese, Land Grabbing is translated as \\"grilagem\\": \\"Much is said about grilagem and the term may be curious ... document aged by the action of insects ... However, for those who live in the interior of the country, the expression effectively reveals a dark, heavy, violent meaning, involving abuses and arbitrary actions against the former occupants, occasionally with forced loss of possession by the taking of land \\" The term grilagem applies to irregular procedures and / or illegal private landholding with violence in the countryside, exploitation of wealth, environmental damage and the threat to sovereignty , given their gigantic proportions.  Situation in the 21st century  =Land area= The Overseas Development Institute reported in January 2013, that with limited data available in general and existing data associated with NGOs interested in generating media attention in particular, the scale of global land trade may have been exaggerated. They found the figures below provide a variety of estimates, all in the tens of millions of hectares. *The International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) estimated in 2009 between 15 and 20 million hectares of farmland in developing countries had changed hands since 2006. * the Land Portal‚Äôs Land Matrix data totalled 49 million hectares of deals globally, although only 26 million hectares of these are transnational. *A 2011 World Bank report by Klaus Deininger reported 56 million hectares worldwide., *Friis & Reenberg (2012) reported in 2012 between 51 and 63 million hectares in Africa alone. *The GRAIN database published in January 2012, quantified 35 million hectares, although when stripping out more developed economies such as Australia, New Zealand, Poland, Russia, Ukraine and Romania, the amount in the GRAIN database reduces to 25 million hectares. * Between 1990 and 2011, in the West Bank (Palestine) 195 km2 of land was expropriated by Israel, without compensation for the local owners, and allocated to immigrants for new settlements and for the establishment of mostly large farms. Water for the local population became extremely sparse. In 2016, as a part of a permanent process 300 acres of land were added. Most seem to arrive at a ballpark of 20-60 million hectares. Given that total global farmland takes up just over 4 billion hectares,Byerlee, Derek and Deininger, Klaus (2011), Rising Global Interest in Farmland, The World Bank these acquisitions could equate to around 1 per cent of global farmland. However, in practice, land acquired may not have previously been used as farmland, it may be covered by forests, which also equate to about 4 billion hectares worldwide, so transnational land acquisitions may have a significant role in ongoing deforestation. The researchers thought that a sizeable number of deals remain questionable in terms of size and whether they have been finalised and implemented. The land database often relies on one or two media sources and may not track whether the investments take place, or whether the full quantity reported takes place. For example, a number of deals in the GRAIN database appear to have stalled including - *1 million hectares taken between US firms Arc Cap and Nile Trading and Development Inc in Sudan *A 400,000 hectare deal between China and Colombia that seems to have stalled *The 325,000 hectare investment by Agrisol in Tanzania *A 324,000 hectare purchase of land by the UAE in Pakistan *A suspended 320,000 hectare purchase by Chinese investors in Argentina. The researchers claim these are only those that have been checked, and already amount to nearly 10 per cent of the GRAIN database transnational land acquisitions. Deals are reported that use the estimate of the full extent of land that the firm expects to use. For example, *Indian investment in Tanzania is reported at 300,000 hectares, currently operating on just 1,000 hectares *Olam International‚Äôs investment in Gabon reported at 300,000 hectares, currently operating on just 50,000 *Three investments amounting to 600,000 hectares in Liberia, with Equatorial Palm Oil‚Äôs deal reported at 169,000 hectares, despite their plans to reach just 50,000 by 2020. =Land value= The researchers found that in terms of value of transnational land acquisitions, it is even harder to come across figures. Media reports usually just give information on the area and not on the value of the land transaction. Investment estimates, rather than the price of purchase are occasionally given They found a number of reports in land databases are not acquisitions, but are long-term leases, where a fee is paid or a certain proportion of the produce goes to domestic markets. For example: *An Indian investment in Ethiopia, where price per hectare ranged from $1.20 to $8 per hectare per year on 311,000 hectares *Indian investors paid $4 per hectare per year on 100,000 hectares. *Prince Bandar Bin Sultan of Saudi Arabia was reported to be paying $125,000 per year for 105,000 hectares in South Sudan, less than $1 per year on a 25-year lease. *A South Korean investor in Peru was reported to be paying $0.80 per hectare. The estimated value has been calculated for IFPRI‚Äôs 2009 data to be 15 to 20 million hectares of farmland in developing countries, worth about $20 billion-$30 billion. Researchers discovered global investment funds are reported to have sizeable funds available for transnational land investments. *One estimate suggests ‚Äú$100 billion waiting to be invested by 120 investment groups‚Äù while already ‚ÄúSaudi Arabia has spent $800 million on overseas farms‚Äù.http://www.westerninvestor.com/index.php/news/55-features/764-land- values In 2011, a farm consultancy HighQuest told Reuters ‚ÄúPrivate capital investment in farming in expected to more than double to around $5-$7 billion in the next couple of years from an estimated $2.5-$3 billion invested in the last couple of years‚Äù. There is significant uncertainty around the value of transnational land acquisitions, particularly given leasing arrangements. Given the quantity of land and the size of investment funds operating in the area, it is likely that the value will be in the tens of billions of dollars. =Land destinations= Researchers used the Land Portal‚Äôs Land Matrix database of 49 billion hectares of land deals, and found that Asia is a big centre of activity with Indonesia and Malaysia counting for a quarter of international deals by hectares. India contributes a further 10 per cent of land deals. The majority of investment is in the production of palm oil and other biofuels. They determined that the Land Portal also reports investments made by investors within their home country and after stripping these out found only 26 million hectares of transnational land acquisitions which strips out a lot of the Asian investments. The largest destination countries include *Brazil with 11 per cent by land area *Sudan with 10 per cent *Madagascar, the Philippines and Ethiopia with 8 per cent each *Mozambique with 7 per cent *Indonesia with 6 per cent. They found the reason seems to be biofuels expansion with exceptions in Sudan and Ethiopia, which sees a trend towards growth of food from Middle Eastern and Indian investors. Represented in the media as the norm they seem to be more the exception. =Land origins= The researchers found a mixed picture in terms of the origins of investors. According to the Land Portal, the United Kingdom is the biggest country of origin followed by the United States, India, the UAE, South Africa, Canada and Malaysia, with China a much smaller player. The GRAIN database says: *United States, the UAE and China all constitute around 12 per cent of deals *India with 8 per cent *Egypt and the UK with 6 per cent *South Korea with 5 per cent * South Africa, Saudi Arabia, Singapore and Malaysia all with 4 per cent. Both the Land Portal and the GRAIN database show that the UK and the US are major players in transnational land acquisitions. This is agribusiness firms, as well as investment funds, investing mostly in sugar cane, jatropha or palm oil. This trend has clearly been driven by the biofuels targets in the EU and US, and greater vertical integration in agribusiness in general. The smaller trend is the picture of Middle Eastern investors or State-backed Chinese investments. While the UAE has done some significant deals by size, some driven by food deals, with Saudi Arabia a smaller number, this is not the dominant trend. While this aspect of land trade has gathered lots of media attention, it is not by any means a comprehensive story. =Other deals= Other estimates of the scope of land acquisition, published in September 2010 by the World Bank, showed that over or in large-scale farmland acquisitions or negotiations were announced between October 2008 and August 2009 alone, with two-thirds of demanded land concentrated in Sub-Saharan Africa. Of the World Bank‚Äôs 464 examined acquisitions, only 203 included land area in their reports, implying that the actual total land covered could more than double the World Bank‚Äôs reported 46 million ha. The most recent estimate of the scale, based on evidence presented in April 2011 at an international conference convened by the Land Deal Politics Initiative, estimated the area of land deals at over 80 million ha. Of these deals, the median size is , with one-quarter over 200,000 ha and one-quarter under 10,000 ha. 37% of projects deal with food crops, 21% with cash crops, and 21% with biofuels. This points to the vast diversity of investors and projects involved with land acquisitions: the land sizes, crop types, and investors involved vary wildly between agreements. Of these projects, 30% were still in an exploratory stage, with 70% approved but in varying stages of development. 18% had not started yet, 30% were in initial development stages, and 21% had started farming. The strikingly low proportion of projects that had initiated farming signifies the difficulties inherent in large-scale agricultural production in the developing world. Investment in land often takes the form of long-term leases, as opposed to outright purchases, of land. These leases often range between 25 and 99 years. Such leases are usually undertaken between national or district governments and investors. Because the majority of land in Africa is categorized as ‚Äúnon-private\\" as a result of government policies on public land ownership and a lack of active titling, governments own or control most of the land that is available for purchase or lease. Purchases are much less common than leases due to a number of countries‚Äô constitutional bans on outright sales of land to foreigners. The methods surrounding the negotiation, approval, and follow-up of contracts between investors and governments have attracted significant criticism for their opacity and complexity. The negotiation and approval processes have been closed in most cases, with little public disclosure both during and after the finalization of a deal. The approval process, in particular, can be cumbersome: It varies from approval by a simple district-level office to approval by multiple national-level government offices and is very subjective and discretionary. In Ethiopia, companies must first obtain an investment license from the central government, identify appropriate land on the district level and negotiate with local leaders, then develop a contract with the regional investment office. Afterwards, the government will undertake a project feasibility study and capital verification process, and finally a lease agreement will be signed and land will be transferred to the investor. In Tanzania, even though the Tanzania Investment Centre facilitates investments, an investor must obtain approval from the TIC, the Ministry of Agriculture, the Ministry of Lands and Housing Development, and the Ministry of Environment, among which communication is oftentimes intermittent.  Target countries  One common thread among governments has been the theme of development: Target governments tout the benefits of agricultural development, job creation, cash crop production, and infrastructure provision as drivers towards economic development and eventually modernization. Many companies have promised to build irrigation, roads, and in some cases hospitals and schools to carry out their investment projects. In return for a below-market-rate $10/ha annual payment for land, Saudi Star promised \\"to bring clinics, schools, better roads and electricity supplies to Gambella.‚Äù Governments also count new job creation as a significant feature of land acquisitions. The issue of agricultural development is a significant driving factor, within the larger umbrella of development, in target governments' agreement to investment by outsiders. The Ethiopian government's acceptance of cash crop-based land acquisitions reflects its belief that switching to cash crop production would be even more beneficial for food security than having local farmers produce crops by themselves. Implicit in the characterization of African agriculture as \\"underdeveloped\\" is the rejection of local communities' traditional methods of harvesting as an inadequate form of food production. On a smaller scale, some deals can be traced to a personal stake in the project or possibly due to corruption or rent-seeking. Given the ad hoc, decentralized, and unorganized approval processes across countries for such transactions, the potential for lapses in governance and openings for corruption are extremely high. In many countries, the World Bank has noted that investors are often better off learning how to navigate the bureaucracies and potentially pay off corrupt officers of governments rather than developing viable, sustainable business plans. = Responses = Since 2010 Brazil enforces in a stricter way a long- existing law that limits the size of farmland properties foreigners may purchase, having halted a large part of projected foreign land purchases. In Argentina, as of September 2011, a projected law is discussed in parliament that would restrict the size of land foreign entities can acquire to 1000 hectare.  Types of land investment  Investors can be generally broken down into three types: agribusinesses, governments, and speculative investors. Governments and companies in Gulf States have been very prominent along with East Asian companies. Many European- and American-owned investment vehicles and agricultural producers have initiated investments as well. These actors have been motivated by a number of factors, including cheap land, potential for improving agricultural production, and rising food and biofuel prices. Building on these motivations, investments can be broken down into three main categories: food, biofuel, and speculative investment. Forestry also contributes to a significant amount of large-scale land acquisition, as do several other processes: ZoomersZoomers, A. (2010) ‚ÄòGlobalization and the foreignization of space: The seven processes driving the current global land grab‚Äô. Journal of Peasant Studies. 37:2, 429-447. mentions drivers such as the creation of protected areas and nature reserves, residential migration, large- scale tourist complexes and the creation of Special Economic Zones, particularly in Asian countries. = Food = Food-driven investments, which comprise roughly 37% of land investments worldwide, are undertaken primarily by two sets of actors: agribusinesses trying to expand their holdings and react to market incentives, and government-backed investments, especially from the Gulf states, as a result of fears surrounding national food security. Agricultural sector companies most often view investment in land as an opportunity to leverage their significant monetary resources and market access to take advantage of underused land, diversify their holdings, and vertically integrate their production systems. The World Bank identifies three areas in which multinational companies can leverage economies of scale: access to cheap international rather than domestic financial markets, risk-reducing diversification of holdings, and greater ability to address infrastructural roadblocks. In the past few decades, multinationals have shied away from direct involvement in relatively unprofitable primary production, instead focusing on inputs and processing and distribution. When the food price crisis hit, risk was transferred from primary production to the price-sensitive processing and distribution fields, and returns became concentrated in primary production. This has incentivized agribusinesses to vertically integrate to reduce supplier risk that has been heightened by the ongoing food price volatility. These companies hold mixed attitudes towards food imports and exports: While some concentrate on food exports, others focus on domestic markets first. While company-originated investments have originated from a wide range of countries, government-backed investments have originated primarily from the food-insecure Gulf States. Examples of such government- backed investments include the government of Qatar‚Äôs attempt to secure land in the Tana River Delta and the Saudi government's King Abdullah Initiative. Additionally, sovereign wealth funds acting as the investments arms of governments have initiated a number of agreements in Sub-Saharan Africa. Since the population of the Gulf states is set to double from 30 million in 2000 to 60 million in 2030, their reliance on food imports is set to increase from the current level of 60% of consumption. The director general of the Arab Organisation for Agricultural Development echoed the sentiment of many Gulf leaders in proclaiming, ‚Äúthe whole Arab World needs of cereal, sugar, fodder and other essential foodstuffs could be met by Sudan alone.‚Äù = Biofuels = Biofuel production, currently comprising 21% of total land investments, has played a significant, if at times unclear, role. The use and popularity of biofuels has grown over the past decade, corresponding with rising oil prices and increased environmental awareness. The total area under biofuel crops more than doubled between 2004 and 2008, expanding to 36 million ha by 2008. This rise in popularity culminated in EU Directive 2009/28/EC in April 2009, which set 10% mandatory targets for renewable energy use, primarily biofuels, out of the total consumption of fuel for transport, by 2020. Taken as a whole, the rise in biofuels popularity, while perhaps beneficial for the environment, sparked a chain reaction by making biofuels production a more attractive option than food production and drawing land away from food to biofuel production. The effect of the rise in popularity in biofuels was two-fold: first, demand for land for biofuel production became a primary driver of land sales in Sub-Saharan Africa; second, demand for biofuels production crowded out supply of traditional food crops worldwide. By crowding out food crops and forcing conversion of existing food-producing land to biofuels, biofuels production had a direct impact on the food supply/demand balance and consequently the food price crisis. One researcher from the IFPRI estimated that biofuels had accounted for 30 percent of the increase in weighted average grain prices. Criticism Large-scale investments in land since 2007 have been scrutinized by civil society organizations, researchers, and other organizations because of issues such as land insecurity, local consultation and compensation for land, displacement of local peoples, employment of local people, the process of negotiations between investors and governments, and the environmental consequences of large-scale agriculture. These issues have contributed to critics' characterization of much large-scale investment since 2007 as \\"land grabbing,\\" irrespective of differences in the types of investments and the ultimate impact that investments have on local populations. = Land insecurity = One of the major issues is land tenure: In a 2003 study, the World Bank estimated that only between 2 and 10 percent of total land in Africa is formally tenured. Much of the lack of private ownership is due to government ownership of land as a function of national policy, and also because of complicated procedures for registration of land and a perception by communities that customary systems are sufficient. World Bank researchers have found that there existed a strong negative statistical link between land tenure recognition and prospective land acquisitions, with a smaller yet still significant relationship for implemented projects as well. They concluded that ‚Äúlower recognition of land rights increased a country‚Äôs attractiveness for land acquisition,‚Äù implying that companies have actively sought out areas with low land recognition rights for investment. = Local consultation and compensation = While commonly required by law in many host countries, the consultation process between investors and local populations have been criticized for not adequately informing communities of their rights, negotiating powers, and entitlements within land transactions.Pearce, F. (2012). The land grabbers: The new fight over who owns the Earth. Boston: Beacon Press. Consultations have been found extremely problematic due to the fact that they often reach just village chiefs but neglect common villagers and disenfranchised groups. World Bank researchers noted that ‚Äúa key finding from case studies is that communities were rarely aware of their rights and, even in cases where they were, lacked the ability to interact with investors or to explore ways to use their land more productively.‚Äù When consultations were even conducted, they often did not produce written agreements and were found to be superficial, glossing over environmental and social issues. In Ghana and elsewhere, chiefs often negotiated directly with investors without the input from other villagers, taking it upon themselves to sell common land or village land on their own. Moreover, investors often had obtained approval for their projects before beginning consultations, and lacked any contractual obligation to carry out promises made to villagers. There is a knowledge gap between investors and local populations regarding the land acquisition process, the legal enforceability of promises made by investors, and other issues. The inability of villagers to see and study the laws and regulations around land sales severely deteriorates communities‚Äô agency in consultations. When consultations do occur with communities, some take place in spans of only two to three months, casting doubt on whether such short time frames can be considered as adequate consultation for such large, wide-reaching, and impactful events. An additional concern with consultations is that women and underrepresented populations are often left outside during the process. Large- scale projects in Mozambique rarely included women in consultations and never presented official reports and documents for authorization by women. This holds true when women are the primary workers on the land that is to be leased out to companies. Meanwhile, pastoralists and internally displaced people were oftentimes intentionally excluded from negotiations, as investors tried to delegitimize their claims on land. This led to a lack of awareness on the part of these vulnerable groups until lease agreements have already been signed to transfer land. This oversight in consultations further disenfranchises previously overlooked communities and worsens power inequities in local villages. =Displacement= Another criticism of investment in land is the potential for large-scale displacement of local people without adequate compensation, in either land or money. These displacements often result in resettlement in marginal lands, loss of livelihoods especially in the case of pastoralists, gender-specific erosion of social networks. Villagers were most often compensated as according to national guidelines for loss of land, loss of improvements over time on the land, and sometimes future harvests. However, compensation guidelines vary significantly between countries and depending on the types of projects undertaken. One study by the IIED concluded that guidelines for compensation given to displaced villagers in Ethiopia and Ghana was insufficient to restore livelihoods lost through dislocation. There are a number of issues with the process of relocating locals to other areas where land is less fertile. In the process of relocation, often changed or lost are historical methods of farming, existing social ties, sources of income, and livelihoods. This holds drastic impacts especially in the case of women, who rely greatly upon such informal relationships. = Employment = When not displaced, the conversion of local farmers into laborers holds numerous negative consequences for local populations. Most deals are based on the eventual formation of plantation-style farming, whereupon the investing company will own the land and employ locals as laborers in large-scale agricultural plots. The number of jobs created varies greatly dependent on commodity type and style of farming planned. In spite of this volatility, guarantees of job creation are rarely, if ever, addressed in contracts. This fact, combined with the intrinsic incentives towards mechanization in plantation-style production, can lead to much lower employment than originally planned for. When employed, locals are often paid little: In investments by Karuturi Global in Ethiopia, workers are paid on average under $2 a day, with a minimum wage of 8 birr, or $0.48, per day, both of which are under the World Bank poverty limit of $2 per day. = Government negotiations = In addition to the lack of coordination between ministries, there is a wide knowledge gap between government-level offices and investors, leading to a rushed and superficial investment review. Many government agencies initially overwhelmed by the deluge of investment proposals failed to properly screen out non-viable proposals. Due to the knowledge gaps between government agencies and investors, ‚Äúin most countries it is implicitly presumed that investors will have the right incentive and be the best qualified to assess economic viability,‚Äù leading to a lack of reporting requirements or monitoring arrangements, key information on land uses and value of the investment, and checks on economic viability. The Sudanese government has been noted as having paid minimal attention to existing land rights and neglecting to conduct any economic analysis on potential projects. In addition, many countries, including Cambodia, Congo, Sudan, and Ghana, have neglected to catalog and file even general geographical descriptions of land allocation boundaries. One addition to many contracts between governments and investors is a Stabilisation Clause, which insulates investors from the effect of changed governmental regulations. Such clauses severely restrict the government‚Äôs ability to change any regulations that would have a negative economic impact on the investment. While advantageous for businesses, these stabilization clauses would severely hinder the ability of governments to address possible social and/or environmental concerns that become apparent after the beginning of the project. = Environmental impact = Land investment has been criticized for its implicit endorsement of large-scale industrial agriculture, which relies heavily on costly machinery, fertilizers, pesticides, and other inputs, over smallholder agriculture.Twenty-First-Century Land Grabs (November 2013), Fred Magdoff, Monthly Review, Volume 65, Issue 06 As foreign investors begin to develop the land, they will, for the most part, start a shift towards large-scale agriculture to improve upon existing ‚Äúunproductive‚Äù agricultural methods. The threat of the conversion of much of Africa‚Äôs land to such large- scale agriculture has provoked a severe pushback from many civil society organizations such as GRAIN, La Via Campesina, and other lobbyists for small- scale agriculture. Foreign investors, through large-scale agriculture, increase the effectiveness of underused resources of land, labor, and water, while further providing additional market connections, large-scale infrastructure development, and provision of seeds, fertilizers, and technology. Proposed increases in production quantity, as touted by investors and hosts, are exemplified by Ethiopia‚Äôs Abera Deressa, who claims that ‚Äúforeign investors should help boost agricultural output by as much as 40%‚Äù throughout Ethiopia. However, large-scale mechanized agricultural production often entails the use of fertilizers and intensive farming techniques that have been criticized by numerous civil society actors as extremely ecologically detrimental and environmentally harmful over the long run. Over time, such intensive farming threatens to degrade the quality of topsoil and damage local waterways and ecosystems. As such, civil society actors have widely accused land investors for promoting ‚Äúnot agricultural development, much less rural development, but simply agribusiness development.‚Äù This trend towards large-scale agriculture that overrides local knowledge and sustainable local farming runs directly counter to the recent IAASTD report, backed by the FAO, UNDP, World Bank, and others, that to increase food security over the long term, sustainable peasant agriculture must be encouraged and supported. = Neocolonialism = Foreign investment in land has been criticized by many civil society actors and individuals as a new realization of neocolonialism, signifying a renewed economic imperialism of developed over developing nations. Critics have pointed to the acquisitions of large tracts of land for economic profit, with little perceived benefit for local populations or target nations as a whole, as a renewal of the economically exploitative practices of the colonial period. Laws and regulations concerning reporting of foreign investment in land A 2013 report found no available literature giving recommendations for how the UK could change its laws and regulations to require UK companies investing in land in developing countries to report relevant data.Walton, O., 2013, Laws and Regulations Concerning Reporting of Foreign Investment in Land, Economic and Private Sector Professional Evidence And Applied Knowledge Services The researcher looks at a literature review by Global Witness, the Oakland Institute, and the International Land Coalition from 2012 which states that there is little sustained focus on the extraterritorial obligations of states over overseas business enterprises.Global Witness, Oakland Institute, International Land Coalition, 2012, Dealing with Disclosure: Improving Transparency in Decision-Making over Large Scale Land Acquisitions, Allocations and Investments The researcher found most available literature and policy on transparency in land investment focusing on: *Facilitating community engagement in planning decisions and enhancing community rights *Upgrading obligations/capacities of host governments to improve regulation of foreign-funded land deals. *Developing international frameworks to improve transparency in land deals. He found this focus was confirmed by a range of other documents reviewing address international efforts to promote responsible investment in agriculture and recommended the International Working Group paperInternational Working Group on the Food Security Pillar of the G20 Multi-Year Action Plan on Development (2011) ‚ÄòOptions for Promoting Responsible Investment in Agriculture‚Äô, Report to the High-Level Development Working Group http://archive.unctad.org/sections/dite_dir/docs//diae_dir_2011-06_G20_en.pdf and Smaller & Mann. The researcher mentions a report by the International Institute for Sustainable Development stating a ‚Äòsignificant lack of concrete and verifiable‚Äô empirically-based policy and legal work on the issue of foreign investment in agricultural land The researcher saw Smaller and Mann note that in many host states like the UK ‚Äòthere is either no, or insufficient or unclear domestic law concerning land rights, water rights, pollution controls for intensive agriculture, human health, worker protection and so on. The researcher did find that international law framework provides hard rights for foreign investors with two primary sources of international law relating to this issue: international contracts, which are commercial in nature; and international treaty law on investment, with both bodies acting on a commercial perspective and focusing on economic interests of foreign investors, rather than social or environmental dimensions He discussed the UN‚Äôs Guiding Principles for Business and Human Rights which address the extraterritorial obligations of states over overseas business enterprises and finds the principles do not provide any detailed discussion of the UK case, or of timeframes and costs. =Extraterritorial obligations of states over overseas businesses= The researcher studied a report by Global Witness, the Oakland Institute and the International Land Coalition which identifies four key entry points for improving transparency in large-scale land acquisition: *transparent land and natural resource planning; *free, prior and ‚Äòinformed‚Äô consent; *public disclosure of all contractual documentation; *multi- stakeholder initiatives, independent oversight and grievance mechanisms‚Äô *a range of additional entry points for future policy work and campaigning, which includes addressing the ‚Äòextra-territorial obligations of states over overseas business enterprises‚Äô. He found the report stresses that ‚Äòfurther analysis is needed to identify the benefits and opportunities of each entry point, as well as potential limitations, challenges, and risks around future campaigns which would need to be addressed from the start‚Äô and notes that as of early 2013 there is a gap between the extent to which individual states fulfill their obligations to regulate businesses overseas, and ‚Äòthe extent to which such regulations cover transparency and information disclosure‚Äô The researcher found that the UN‚Äôs Guiding Principles for Business and Human Rights, written by the former UN Special Representative to the Secretary General for Business and Human Rights, Professor John Ruggie provide some discussion of how business enterprises need to undertake human rights due diligence suggesting that states ‚Äòshould set out clearly the expectation that all business enterprises domiciled in their territory and/or jurisdiction respect human rights throughout their operations‚Äô and notes that ‚Äòat present States are not generally required under international human rights law to regulate the extraterritorial activities of businesses domiciled in their territory and/or jurisdiction. He claims that they are not generally prohibited from doing so either, provided there is a recognised jurisdictional basis‚Äô and says the report notes that some states have introduced domestic measures with extraterritorial implications. ‚ÄòExamples include requirements on ‚Äúparent‚Äù companies to report on the global operations of the entire enterprise; multilateral soft-law instruments such as the Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development; and performance standards required by institutions that support overseas investments. The researcher found other approaches amount to direct extraterritorial legislation and enforcement including criminal regimes that allow for prosecutions based on the nationality of the perpetrator no matter where the offence occurs‚Äô He read that the UN‚Äôs Guiding Principles propose that ‚Äòcontracts should always be publicly disclosed when the public interest is impacted; namely cases where the project presents either large-scale or significant social, economic, or environmental risks or opportunities, or involves the depletion of renewable or non-renewable natural resources‚Äôhttp://www.globalwitness.org/sites/default/files/library/Dealing_with_disclosure_1.pdf He found Global Witness et al. state that governments and businesses often claim that confidentiality is necessarily to protect commercially sensitive information contained in investment contracts. =Other relevant international principles, guidelines and instruments= The researcher states that the Global Witness et al. paper details a number of international instruments that ‚Äòcreate obligations and responsibilities throughout all stages of decision- making around large-scale land investments‚Äô, including the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights; the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights; and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. He found several thematic binding agreements also examined in the report: the 1992 Convention on Biological Diversity and the 1994 Convention to Combat Desertification. The UK encourages companies to abide by OECD guidelines for multinational enterprises which provide voluntary principles and standards for responsible business conduct for multinational corporations operating in or from countries adhering to the OECD Declaration on International Investment and Multinational Enterprises, including detailed guidance concerning information disclosure. However they do not, provide any specific recommendations on land. The researcher read the Global Witness et al. report also finds that ‚Äòa number of instruments offer companies the opportunity to associate themselves with a set of principles or goals that demonstrate corporate social responsibility‚Äô but most of these are largely ‚Äòdeclarative‚Äô. Overall, he summaries that the report notes that although these various instruments ‚Äòrecognise secrecy and lack of access to information to be a problem, they give almost no detail as to how it should be tackled in practice, nor do any mandatory provisions yet exist to ensure such an implicit aspiration is met‚Äô  Information issues  In a joint research project between the FAO, IIED, and IFAD, Cotula et al. found that the majority of host countries lacked basic data on the size, nature, and location of land acquisitions through land registries or other public sources, and that ‚Äúresearchers needed to make multiple contacts‚Ä¶to access even superficial and incomplete information.‚Äù The World Bank‚Äôs own lack of land size information on over half of the reported land grabs that it researched points to the difficulties inherent in gaining access to and researching individual land acquisitions. The European project EJOLT (Environmental Justice Organisations, Liabilities and Trade) is building a global map of land grabbing, with the aim to make an interactive online map on this and many other environmental justice issue by 2013. The project also produces in-depth resources on land grabbing, such as this video on land grabbing in Ethiopia.  Notable cases  In Madagascar, the anger among the population about land sales led to violent protests. The South Korean corporation Daewoo was in the process of negotiations with the Malagasy government for the purchase of 1.3 million hectares, half of all agricultural land, to produce corn and palm oil. This investment, while one of many pursued in Madagascar, attracted considerable attention there and led to protests against the government. In Sudan, numerous large-scale land acquisitions have taken place in spite of the country's unresolved political and security situation. One of the most prominent, involving a former GRAPE partner named Phil Heilberg, garnered attention by playing in Rolling Stone. Heilberg, who is planning to invest in 800,000 ha of land in partnership with many of Sudan's top civilian officials, attracted criticism with his remarks (regarding Africa and land grabbing) that \\"the whole place is like one big sewer -- and I'm like a plumber.\\" In Myanmar, a 2018 amendment to the 2012 Vacant, Fallow and Virgin Lands Management Law has affects for millions of rural peoples, requiring registration of land and private land ownership. Failure to register land can result in criminal punishments for remaining on that land. The new amendment heavily affects ethnic areas and internally displaced peoples. Unregistered land has been claimed by or sold to private agribusiness ventures.

Biography Massie is the daughter of a Swiss diplomat. She was born in New York and graduated from Vassar College, but also studied at the Sorbonne and the Institute of Political Studies in Paris. In 1975, Suzanne Massie and her then-husband Robert K. Massie chronicled their experiences as the parents of a hemophiliac child, Robert Kinloch Massie IV, and the significant differences between the American and French health-care systems in their jointly written book, Journey. Journey followed her husband's 1967 book, Nicholas and Alexandra, a biography of the last Emperor and Empress of Russia, whose son also was born with hemophilia. Reagan first became interested in Massie when he read her book Land of the Firebird: The Beauty of Old Russia. She eventually visited the White House, where she became an informal messenger between the President and Mikhail Gorbachev and his administration. She also asked Reagan to learn the now famous Russian phrase \\"Doveryai, no proveryai\\", which translates as \\"Trust, but verify\\". Her importance in contributing to Reagan's understanding of the Russian people, assisting in reaching a peaceful end to the Cold War, was described in detail in a number of documentary films. She applied for the job of Soviet ambassador via a letter to Reagan but was rejected, as the post had already been filled. A fellow of the Harvard Russian Research Center (now the Davis Center) from 1985 to 1997, Massie has also served on the Board of the International League for Human Rights.

Broke was fourth son of Thomas Broke of Leighton in Cheshire, and his wife, daughter, and heiress of John Parker of Copnall. His ancestors had been Brokes of Leighton since the twelfth century, and came of a common stock with the Brookes of Norton. On 11 July 1510Pat. 2 Hen. VIII, p. 2, m. 2, and S.B. he obtained a royal exemption from becoming serjeant-at- law, an honour then conferred only on barristers of at least sixteen years practice at the bar. Perhaps he was deterred, as others had been,Dugdale, Orig. p. 110 by the great expenses attending the promotion ; but he did not long avail himself of his privilege, he being one of the nine Serjeants appointed in the following November. He was double reader in his inn, the Middle Temple, in the autumn of 1510, and must have passed his first readership before 1502, at which date Dugdale's list of readers commences. In the spring of 1511,2 Hen. VIII from undersheriff he became Recorder of London, an office he filled until 1520. Foss says he represented the city of London in the parliaments of 1511 and 1515, the returns of members to which parliaments are stated to be 'not found' in the House of Lords' Report. In the parliament of 1523 he was one of the triers of petitions. In June 1519 he appears as a junior justice of assize for the Norfolk circuit. He became a judge of the common pleas and knight in 1520,Fines levied Easter, 12 Hen. VIII and chief baron of the exchequer on 24 January 1526,Com. de Term. Hill., 17 Hen. VIII, Rot. 1 and continued in both offices till his death in May or June 1529. As serjeant, and afterwards as judge, his name appears in many commissions for the home and Norfolk circuits. His will, dated 6 May 1529, was proved on 2 July 1529 by his widow, daughter of ___ Ledes, by whom he left three sons, Robert (afterwards of Nacton), William, and John, and four daughters, Bridget, Cicely, Elizabeth (married ___ Fouleshurst), and Margaret. Bridget had married George Fastolfe of Nacton, who died without issue in 1527, leaving his manors of Nacton, Cowhall, and Shullondhall, Suffolk, to her, with remainder to her father and his heirs, who thus became Brokes of Nacton. Margaret married William Whorwood, a prominent lawyer. Sir Richard left property in Norfolk, Kent, Surrey, and Sussex. A direct descendant, Robert Broke of Nacton, was created baronet in 1661, and died without male issue in 1693, when the estates passed to his nephew Robert, grandfather of Admiral Sir Philip Bowes Vere Broke.

Located in Tswana territory west of the Transvaal, Goshen existed as an independent nation for a short period; from 1882 to 1883 as the State of Goshen and, after unification with neighbouring Stellaland, as the United States of Stellaland (Dutch: Verenigde Staten van Stellaland) from 1883 to 1885. During its history, Goshen, though small in size, became a focal point of conflict between the British Empire and the South African Republic, the two major players vying over the territory. After a series of claims and annexations, British fears of Boer expansionism ultimately led to its demise and, among other factors, set the stage for the Second Boer War of 1899‚Äì1902.  History  Before the proclamation of Goshen, the land was under the control of competing Griqua and Tswana groups, while the United Kingdom laid claim to it as part of the emerging protectorate of British Bechuanaland. Two of the indigenous groups were under the leadership of chiefs Mankurwane and Montshiwa, whom the British regarded as \\"friendly,\\"Williams, p. 71f. and another two under the leadership of chiefs Moshoette and Massouw. In the mid- nineteenth century, Voortrekkers (Boer settlers) established themselves in the region and in the early 1880s they supported Moshoette in his battles against Mankurwane and Montshiwa, helping to besiege Montshiwa‚Äôs stronghold Mahikeng. Mahikeng fell on 24 October 1882 and, in gratitude, Moshoette ceded large portions of Mankurwane's land (416 farms of 3,000 morgen (2,563 hectares) each) to the Boer mercenaries who had supported him.McCall, p. 147f. The mercenaries, led by Nicolaas Claudius Gey van Pittius, immediately declared independence (followed by an official proclamation on 21 November 1882),Leyds, p. 110. naming the new nation after the Book of Genesis's Land of Goshen, \\"the best of the land of Egypt given to Joseph\\", with its capital at Rooigrond (\\"Red Ground\\").Webster, p. 23. Geography Goshen covered an area of , with its northern border the Molopo River, and sharing a border with the Transvaal. It had an estimated population of 17,000, of whom approximately 2,000 were of European origin.Meredith, p. 137. Goshen‚Äôs capital Rooigrond was little more than a fortified farm consisting of a collection of mud huts and a population of a few dozen, situated near Mafeking. Goshen‚Äôs flag, designed by Gey van Pittius, was adopted in early 1883Walker, p. 512. and consisted of horizontal black, white and red stripes with a green vertical stripe at the hoist.Carr, p.83. Unification with Stellaland Less than a year after declaring independence, on 6 August 1883, Goshen and the neighbouring Republic of Stellaland united to form the United States of Stellaland.Stewart, p. 114. While the British government was at first unconcerned about the declaration of independence of Goshen and Stellaland, and felt it could not prevent such proclamations of independence, Cecil Rhodes recognised the economic implications of an independent Boer republic blocking the transit of goods between the Cape Colony and British Central AfricaGiliomee, p.241. and began to agitate the Cape Colony Government to forcibly take control of the area.Meredith, p. 138. As part of his plan to bring the United States of Stellaland under British rule, Rhodes and colleague Frank Thompson travelled to Stellaland in September 1884 to convince the locals of the advantages of Cape rule.Meredith, p. 147. While the Stellaland residents were receptive to Rhodes, Goshenites proved to be far more hostile; while Rhodes stayed at the Goshen border, Thompson visited Rooigrond to speak to the President Gey van Pittius, who was living in a tent. Gey van Pittius immediately arrested Thompson before eventually releasing him to tell Rhodes that Goshen remained independent and demanded British recognition of that independence.Meredith, p. 148. In response to Rhodes' actions, on 16 September 1884, Transvaal's President Paul Kruger proclaimed Transvaal's annexation of Goshen and Stellaland in \\"the interests of humanity\\" and on 3 October, Transvaal's Director of Education, the Rev Stephanus du Toit, arrived in Rooigrond, made a fiery speech, renamed the town \\"Heliopolis\\" and raised the Transvaal flag. As a result, the British told Kruger that annexation was unacceptable and December 1884, 4,000 troops of the Bechuanaland Expeditionary Force, led by General Charles Warren,Galbraith, p. 12. were sent from England to quell the Boers and force Goshen and Stellaland to capitulate.Weaver, pp. 889-890. Warren met with no resistanceSonnenburg, p. 885. and Goshen was subsequently incorporated into British Bechuanaland.Rosenthal, p. 219. On 3 October 1895 the colony was abolished and incorporated into the colony of the Cape of Good Hope.Brownlie & Burns, p. 1095. Sources * Brownlie, I. & Burns, I.

Broke was a member of parliament, sitting for Calais, and in July 1539 spoke strongly against the Six Articles Bill, though Cromwell sent to warn him to forbear doing so as he loved his life. Part of his speech is preserved by Foxe (Acts and Monuments, v. 503). He was roughly answered by Sir William Kingston, comptroller of the king's household, who was reproved by the speaker for his attempt to interfere with the freedom of debate. The next month, at the trial of Ralph Hare, a soldier of Calais, for heresy, Broke intervened on the prisoner's behalf, and was rebuked by Richard Gwent, the Dean of Arches. Half an hour later he found himself accused of the same crime on the information of the council of Calais, and on 10 August was committed to the Fleet Prison along with John Butler, a priest of the same town, who was also a 'sacramentary.' As, however, the Calais witnesses could prove nothing against him, he was released. In 1540, 32 Henry VIII, the king demised two chapels in the parish of Monkton, in the liberty of the Cinque Ports, to a Thomas Broke for 42l. 7s. 11d.Hasted, Kent, iv. 340 n. As Broke the translator was paymaster of Dover in 1549 (see below), it is at least possible that he was the lessee. Another attempt was made against Broke in the spring of 1540. His servant was imprisoned by the council of Calais and strictly examined as to his master's conduct, and 'the second Monday after Easter' Broke was committed to the mayor's gaol, 'whither no man of his calling was ever committed unless sentence of death had first been pronounced upon him;' for otherwise he should have been imprisoned in a brother alderman's house. All his goods were seized, and his wife and children thrust into a mean part of his house by Sir Edward Kingston. Indignant at such treatment, Mistress Broke answered a threat of Kingston's with 'Well, sir, well, the king's slaughter-house had wrong when you were made a gentleman' (Foxe, v. 576). She wrote to complain to Cromwell and to other friends, and, finding that her letters were seized by the council, sent a secret messenger to England to carry the news of the sufferings of her husband and of those imprisoned with him. On receiving her message, Cromwell ordered that the prisoners should be sent over for trial, and on May Day they were led through the streets of Calais, Broke being in irons as the 'chief captain' of the rest. Broke was committed to the Fleet, and lay there for about two years. At the end of that time he and his twelve companions were released 'in very poor estate.' In 1550 the name of Thomas Broke occurs among the chief sectaries of Kent. Although from the character of his literary work it is impossible to suppose that Broke the translator could have been one of the 'Anabaptists and Pelagians' spoken of by Strype (Memorials, II. i. 369), yet if, as seems likely, he was dissatisfied with the new Book of Common Prayer, he may have belonged to a separate congregation, and so have been described as sharing the opinions of the majority of the sectaries of the district. Works His works are: *'Certeyn Meditacions and Things to be had in Remembraunce ‚Ä¶ by euery Christian before he receiue the Sacrament of the Body and Bloude of Christ, compiled by T. Broke,' 1548. *'Of the Life and Conuersacion of a Christen Man ‚Ä¶ wrytten in the Latin tonge by Maister John Caluyne. ‚Ä¶ Translated into English by Thomas Broke, Esquire, Paymaster of Douer,' 1549. In the prologue of this translation the identity of Broke with the alderman of Calais is made clear. 'I have (good reader),' he writes, 'translated a good part more of the institution of a Christen man, wrytten by this noble clerke which I cannot nowe put in printe, partly through mine owne busynes as well at Douer as at Calleis.' *The preface to 'Geneua. The Forme of Common Praiers used in the Churches of Geneua ‚Ä¶ made by Master John Caluyne. ‚Ä¶ Certayne Graces be added in the ende to the prayse of God, to be sayde before or after meals,' 1550. An imperfect copy of this rare 12mo, printed by E. Whitchurch, is described in Herbert's 'Ames' (p. 547). To the beautiful copy in the Grenville Library in the British Museum is appended a note in Grenville's handwriting, in which he calls attention to its perfect condition, and declares his belief that it is the only copy extant. In his preface Broke says that the graces are his, and that perhaps some will find them over-long; the first is a paraphrase of the Ten Commandments. He also makes another mention of his further translation from Calvin's 'Institution' which he had ready and was about to put forth. If this was ever printed, it appears to have left no sign of its existence. E. Whitchurch had printed the English Liturgy the year before, and this translation of the Genevan form seems to indicate a desire that changes should be made in it so as to bring it nearer to the practices of the Calvinistic congregations abroad. *'A Reply to a Libel cast abroad in defence of D.

Early life and career Brokesby was born on 29 September 1637, the son of Obadiah Brokesby, a gentleman of independent fortune, of Stoke Golding, Leicestershire, and his wife Elizabeth, daughter of James Pratt, Wellingborough, Northamptonshire. His uncle Nathaniel was a schoolmaster. As all the nine children of his grandfather Francis received scriptural names, it is likely that he came of Puritan stock. He became a member and afterwards a fellow of Trinity College, Cambridge, taking the degree of B.D. in 1666. A religious poem of some beauty composed by him on the occasion of his taking his degree illustrates the fervent piety of his character.This poem is preserved in John Nichols's History and Antiquities of Hinckley, 737. He probably took orders early, for on the presentation of his college he succeeded John Warren, the ejected vicar of Hatfield Broad Oak, Essex. He lived on friendly terms with his predecessor, who used to come and hear him preach.Samuel Palmer, Nonconformists' Memorial, ii. 202. In 1670 he left Broad Oak, and became rector of Rowley, East Riding of Yorkshire. Soon after he entered on this new cure he married Isabella, daughter of a Mr Wood of Kingston upon Hull. From about this time onwards he used to write in his pocket-books short Latin memoranda on the incidents of his daily life. Several specimens of these memoranda have been preserved.Nichols, Hinckley, 736-40. Though they give some idea of his peculiar piety, they are mostly concerned with domestic matters. During his incumbency at Rowley he appears to have been involved in several disputes and lawsuits about tithes. He refers to these disputes in his memoranda of 1678 and 1680; on 31 July 1683 he enters a thanksgiving for the successful issue of a suit, and in the same year registers a vow that if he gains a cause then pending he will devote half the tithe so recovered to the relief of the poor. Life as a nonjuror When the revolution of 1688 set William III and Mary II on the throne, Brokesby refused to take the oath to the new sovereigns. He was accordingly deprived of his living in 1690. He went up to London in July, and appears to have been received by Lady Fairborn at her house in Pall Mall 'over against the Pastures.' Meanwhile, his wife, by that time the mother of six children, did what she could to wind up affairs. Writing to her sister on 8 Aug, she says, 'We are now cutting down our corn, for we cannot sell it.' After his deprivation Brokesby lived for some years in his native village, and there his wife died and was buried on 26 February 1699. Brokesby's private property seems to have been small. His high character and his reputation as a scholar gained him many friends among the men of his own party. Chief among these was Francis Cherry of Shottesbrooke, Berkshire, to whose liberal kindness Thomas Hearne and many other nonjurors were indebted. After his wife's death Brokesby appears to have resided constantly at Shottesbrooke, and early in 1706 succeeded Mr Gilbert of St John's College, Oxford, as chaplain to the little society of nonjurors established there.Thomas Hearne, Collections, i. 211. He travelled about a good deal, and generally paid a yearly round of visits in the north of England, probably to the men of his own party, occasionally also going up to Oxford and London. At Shottesbrooke he enjoyed the society of Robert Nelson, to whom he rendered valuable assistance in the compilation of his book on the Festivals and Fasts of the Church. There, too, he formed a strong friendship with Henry Dodwell, sometime Camden Professor of History at Oxford. In common with some other moderate nonjurors, Brokesby refused to take the oath simply because his conscience forbade him to do so, and not as a matter of politics. He declared that if James were dead, he would have no objection to swearing allegiance to William and Mary, because they would be in possession, while the claim of the Prince of Wales would be 'dubious'.Nichols, 740. The death of James, however, was followed by the oath of abjuration, and neither Brokesby nor his friends were prepared to declare that the kingship of William of Orange was founded on right. At the same time, while he warmly upheld the cause of the deprived bishops, ecclesiastical division was grievous to him, and he fully shared in the opinion expressed in Henry Dodwell's work, 'The Case in View,' that on the death or resignation of these bishops their party might return to the national communion. The case contemplated by Dodwell became a fact when the death of Bishop Lloyd on 1 January 1710 was followed by the resignation of Bishop Ken, and accordingly Brokesby, Dodwell and Nelson returned to the communion of the established church, and attended service at Shottesbrooke Church on 28 February.Nathaniel Marshall, Defence of our Constitution, app. iv. and vi. A letter from S. Parker of Oxford, dated 12 November,Gentleman's Magazine, 1799, vol. lxix. pt. i. appears to have called forth a reply dated 18 November, in which Brokesby shows that 'the new bishops' were merely suffragans, that no synodical denunciation had invested them with independent authority after the deaths of the deprived diocesans, that the 'deprived fathers' had no power to invest them with such authority, and that therefore they were not diocesan bishops.Marshall, app. xi. Brokesby, then, had no part in what may be described as the schism of the nonjurors. He lost his friend Dodwell in 1711, and the next year he describes himself in his will, dated 15 September 1712, as sojourning at Hinckley. He was then in good health. The death of Francis Cherry in 1713 caused him deep grief. He died at Hinckley, and was buried at Stoke on 24 October 1714. Of his six children, his elder son Francis died in early life, and his younger son, who became a merchant, also died before him. His four daughters survived him; the second, Dorothy, married Samuel Parr, vicar of Hinckley, and was thus the grandmother of Dr Samuel Parr, the famous Greek scholar. Works Brokesby was the author of: * Some Proposals towards promoting the Propagation of the Gospel in our American Plantations, 1708, 8vo. * A tract entitled Of Education with respect to Grammar Schools and the Universities, to which is annexed a Letter of Advice to a Young Gentleman.

Laid down in the Hebrides Basin during the middle Jurassic, they are the rough time equivalent of the Inferior and Great Oolite Groups found in southern England. This sequence of rocks was originally named as the ‚ÄòGreat Estuarine Series‚Äô by the geologist, John Wesley Judd in 1878. There are outcrops on the islands of Skye, Raasay, Eigg, Muck and Mull and on the Ardnamurchan peninsula. It comprises a series of shales, clays and sandstones of non-marine origin. The Group overlies the Garantiana Mudstone of the 'Bearreraig Sandstone Formation' and is itself overlain by rocks of the 'Skye Lava Group', erupted during the Palaeocene.http://www.bgs.ac.uk/lexicon/lexicon.cfm?pub=GEST The lowermost (and hence oldest) unit of the Great Estuarine Group is the ‚ÄòCullaidh Shale Formation‚Äô. Overlying this is the 'Elgol Sandstone Formation', the type locality of which is to be found at the village of Elgol on Skye. These sandstones are interpreted as being deltaic in origin. Above the sandstone is the 'Lealt Shale Formation', a unit in which fossils of creatures which lived in brackish lagoons abound. These include mussels, sharks and plesiosaurs. The discovery of the first plesiosaur was made in 1844 by the geologist Hugh Miller. The ‚ÄòKildonnan Member‚Äô of the Lealt Shale Formation contains stromatolites and various microfossils such as dinoflagellates and acritarchs.

Bromfield was born at Boldre, in the New Forest, Hampshire, in 1801, his father, the Rev. John Arnold Bromfield, dying in the same year. He received his early training under Dr. Knox of Tunbridge, Dr. Nicholas of Baling, and Rev. Mr. Phipps, a Warwickshire clergyman. He entered Glasgow University in 1821, and two years later he took his degree in medicine. During his university career he first showed a liking for botany, and made an excursion into the Scottish highlands in quest of plants. He left Scotland in 1826, and, being independent of professional earnings, travelled through Germany, Italy, and France, returning to England in 1830. His mother died shortly afterwards, and he lived with his sister at Hastings and at Southampton, and finally settled at Ryde in 1836. He published in The Phytologist some observations on Hampshire plants, and then began to amass materials for a Flora of the Isle of Wight, which he did not consider complete even after fourteen years of assiduous labour. In 1842 he spent some weeks in Ireland, and in January 1844 he started for a six months' tour to the West Indies, spending most of the time in Trinidad and Jamaica. Two years later he visited North America, publishing some remarks in Hooker's Journal of Botany. In September 1850 he embarked for the East, and spent some time in Egypt, penetrating as far as Khartoum, which he described in a letter as a 'region of dust, dirt, and barbarism.' Here he lost two of his companions, victims to the climate, and he returned to Cairo in the following June, after an absence of seven months. Continuing his journey, he passed by Jaffa, and stated his intention of leaving Constantinople for Southampton in September, but his last letter was dated \\"Bairout, 22 Sept.,\\" when he was expecting a friend to join him on a trip to Baalbec and Damascus. At the latter place he was attacked by malignant typhus, and died on 9 Oct., four days after his arrival. His collections were sent to Kew, some of the contents being shared amongst his scientific friends. The Flora of the Isle of Wight was printed by Sir W. J. Hooker and Dr. Bell Salter in 1856, under the title of Flora Vectensis, in 8vo, with a topographical map and portrait of the author. His manuscript Flora of Hampshire was never published. His herbarium is now at Ryde in the Isle of Wight, but his manuscripts are in the library of the Royal Kew Gardens.

They were some of the first optical experiments measuring the relative motion of Earth and the luminiferous aether which were sufficiently precise to detect magnitudes of second order to v/c. The results were negative, which was of great importance for the development of the Lorentz transformation and consequently of the theory of relativity. See also Tests of special relativity. The experiments To explain the negative outcome of the Michelson‚ÄìMorley experiment, George FitzGerald (1889) and Hendrik Lorentz (1892) introduced the contraction hypothesis, according to which a body is contracted during its motion through the stationary aether. Lord Rayleigh (1902) interpreted this contraction as a mechanical compression which should lead to optical anisotropy of materials, so the different refraction indices would cause birefringence. To measure this effect, he installed a tube of 76 cm length upon a rotatable table. The tube was closed by glass at its ends, and was filled with carbon bisulphide or water, and the liquid was between two nicol prisms. Through the liquid, light (produced by an electric lamp and more importantly by limelight) was sent to and fro. The experiment was sufficiently precise to measure retardations of \\\\tfrac{1}{6000} of a half wavelength, i.e. of the order . Depending on the direction relative to Earth's motion, the expected retardation due to birefringence was of order 10‚àí8, which was well within the accuracy of the experiment. Therefore, it was, besides the Michelson-Morley experiment and the Trouton‚ÄìNoble experiment, one of the few experiments by which magnitudes of second order in v/c could be detected. However, the result was completely negative. Rayleigh repeated the experiments with layers of glass plates (although with a diminished precision by a factor of 100), and again obtained a negative result. However, those experiments were criticized by DeWitt Bristol Brace (1904). He argued that Rayleigh hadn't properly considered the consequences of contraction ( instead of 10‚àí8) as well as of the refraction index, so that the results were in no way conclusive. Therefore, Brace conducted experiments of much higher precision. He employed an apparatus that was 4.13 m long, 15 cm wide, and 27 cm deep, which was filled with water, and which could be rotated (depending on the experiment) about a vertical or a horizontal axis. Sun light was directed into the water through a system of lenses, mirrors and reflexion prisms, and was reflected 7 times so that it traversed 28.5 m. In this way, a retardation of order was observable. However, also Brace obtained a negative result. Another experimental installation with glass instead of water (precision: ), also yielded no sign of birefringence. center The absence of birefringence was initially interpreted by Brace as a refutation of length contraction. However, it was shown by Lorentz (1904) and Joseph Larmor (1904) that when the contraction hypothesis is maintained and the complete Lorentz transformation is employed (i.e. including the time transformation), then the negative outcome can be explained. Furthermore, if the relativity principle is considered as valid from the outset, as in Albert Einstein's theory of special relativity (1905), then the result is quite clear, since an observer in uniform translational motion can consider himself as at rest, and consequently won't experience any effect of his own motion. Length contraction is thus not measurable by a comoving observer, and has to be supplemented by time dilation for non-comoving observers, which was subsequently also confirmed by the Trouton‚ÄìRankine experiment (1908) and the Kennedy‚ÄìThorndike experiment (1932).

The agency provides news in Arabic and English. It has also Spanish and Portuguese news services. May 2017 incident On 24 May Qatar stated that the website was hacked by an unknown source and that fake stories on sensitive issues were published before the site went offline. Subsequently Saudi Arabia, Egypt and the United Arab Emirates blocked Qatari media, including broadcaster Al Jazeera. On 5 June Saudi Arabia, Egypt, the United Arab Emirates, Yemen, Libya, Bahrain, and Maldives severed their relations with Qatar accusing it of supporting terrorism. According to Qatar-based Al Jazeera, hackers posted fake remarks on the official Qatar News Agency attributed to the Emir of Qatar, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, that expressed support for Iran, Hamas, Hezbollah and Israel. The emir was quoted as saying: \\"Iran represents a regional and Islamic power that cannot be ignored and it is unwise to face up against it. It is a big power in the stabilization of the region.\\"\\"Hack, fake story expose real tensions between Qatar, Gulf\\". Fox News. 24 May 2017.\\"Trump's 'Arab NATO' Vision is a Desert Mirage\\".

On 16 July, The Washington Post revealed that US intelligence officials pin-pointed the hack as being carried out by the UAE. The intelligence officials stated that the hacking was discussed among Emirati officials on 23 May, one day before the operation took place. The UAE denied any involvement in the hacking. It was announced on 26 August 2017 that five individuals allegedly involved in the hacking were arrested in Turkey.

Education Society. The medium of instruction is the English language. The school is affiliated to the Maharashtra state board and the Central Board of Secondary Education. It celebrated its silver jubilee year in 2011.  History  In the mid-1980s, Virar had just started its journey towards development and recognition owing to the gradually increasing migration from the city of Mumbai. There was a growing need to start an English Medium school in the region. However, due to the economic restraints of starting an English Medium school, the dream of many could not materialize into reality. It was then that the two great visionaries Late. Padmashree Bhausaheb Vartak and Late Smt. Tarabai Vartak, a former State Minister, came together and chalked out a plan with an aim to provide the children of Virar, an affordable and quality education through the medium of English.  The Beginning  Finally in June 1986, with the approval of the Agashi-Virar-Arnala Education Society, the dream of these two visionaries came into existence. A small English division was started in the adjoining building of Annasaheb Vartak Smarak Vidyamandir, a Marathi medium school of the A.V.A. Education society. The school started with the same name and with a student count of only 35 which were managed by only one teacher. Years went by and due to the hard work and enthusiastic efforts of the board people of the society, the school slowly started to gain foothold in the education system of Virar.

It was built and first flown in Austria in 1955, and a total of 26 were built before production ended in 1965. Design and development The Mg 23, an Erwin Musger design often known as the Musger Mg 23, was an all-wood shoulder-wing aircraft. Its wing had a straight leading edge, a constant-chord inner section with taper outboard and 2.5¬∞ of dihedral. The wingtips had small tip fences. It was built around a single wooden spar and was wood covered apart from the ailerons, which were fabric covered. Wooden Schempp-Hirth spoilers were fitted. The tail surfaces were fabric covered, the tailplane narrow in chord and straight tapered with a Flettner trim tab on the starboard elevator. One change between the prototype Mg 23 and the production Mg 23 SL was that the size of the fin and rudder was increased; on the SL the fin was straight-edged apart from a curved fuselage fillet but the trailing edge of the wide, deep rudder was rounded. The fuselage had an oval section of wooden semi-monocoque construction, tapering to the rear. On the production SL the fuselage line over the wings merged into a forward-sliding canopy, which was longer than that of the prototype. The Mg 23 SL had a fixed monowheel undercarriage, and both integral nose- and tailskids. The Mg 23 prototype flew on 25 June 1955, flight testing leading to the increase in vertical tail size and a modified canopy on the production aircraft, the first of which was flown on 1 April 1962. Operational history 26 Mg 23 SLs had been built by March 1966. In mid-2010, 11 Mg 23s were on the civil registers of European countries, nine in Austria, one in Switzerland and one in the Netherlands. Three were exported to the United States and one to Canada.

History √Ådahoon√≠≈Ç√≠g√≠√≠ was published by the Navajo Agency of the Bureau of Indian Affairs in Window Rock, Arizona from 1943 to 1957 and contributed to the standardization of Navajo orthography as it was widely distributed. Until that time, the only widely available texts intended for a Navajo audience had been religious publications and parts of Diyin God Bizaad (a Navajo translation of the Bible). Its first issue was published in 1943. The paper was edited by Robert W.

From 1943 to 1947, it was written entirely in Navajo. After that, articles were published bilingually or with an English summary of its contents. In its early years, the paper's main editorial function was to convey the opinions of \\"W√°√°shindoon\\" regarding World War II to the Navajo people. In addition, it provided a connection between those Navajos who served in the United States military and those who had remained at home.

Due to the impact of this storm, the name Vania was retired from the lists of tropical cyclone names and was replaced with Vanessa. =Fiji= In Fiji, heavy rains associated with the initial disturbance brought significant flooding to many islands. Several roads were temporarily shut down due to rising waters, though no homes were affected. Although the center of Vania continued to move away from Fiji, the storm's outer bands brought continued rainfall to the country. =Vanuatu= As the storm passed through Vanuatu, winds of 140 km/hr affected Tafea Province, and contact with this group of islands was lost. Many buildings were damaged and trees were felled. The National Disaster Management Office of Vanuatu enacted a 156.6 million vatu (US$1.6 million) relief plan for Tafea Province, with the vast majority of funds going to food items. =New Caledonia= Within 24 hours of the storm's arrival in New Caledonia, a large magnitude 7.0 earthquake struck the Loyalty Islands within the archipelago. Media reported that extreme wind gusts up to were felt in the region.

On 29 July 2005, he announced his intention to resign as President of the National Federation Party (NFP) at the party conference on the 31 July. Naidu took over the leadership of the NFP, once the main political party appealing to the Indo-Fijian community, when it was in a state of disarray following its poor showing in the parliamentary elections of 1999 and 2001. Naidu had a reputation as a dynamic organizer who undertook a major drive to rejuvenate the party and broaden its appeal to indigenous Fijians, women, and the disadvantaged. In mid-2005, he was at the forefront of a major campaign against a controversial bill being promoted by the Fijian government, that aimed to establish a Commission with the power to compensate victims and pardon perpetrators of the civilian coup d'√©tat which deposed the elected government in May 2000. Announcing his resignation, Naidu expressed disappointment at how the party's general secretary, Pramod Rae, had gone public with calls for him to step down. The NFP was not a media-led party, he said, and he was \\"disappointed and hurt\\" that Rae had gone to the media despite a private assurance from Naidu that he would resign soon. Rae should have called a meeting of the executive board before making such a unilateral decision, Naidu said. On 31 July, the party conference elected Raman Pratap Singh to replace him.

He was first elected to the House of Representatives in 1999 and following the elections after the 2000 political uphevals was a candidate of the Conservative Alliance (CAMV). He was re-elected to the House of Representatives, winning the Cakaudrove West Fijian Communal Constituency in the parliamentary election of 2001, following in the footsteps of his father, Ratu Tevita Vakalalabure, who claimed to hold the chiefly title of Vunivalu (Paramount Chief) of Natewa, in Cakaudrove Province, and who served in both houses of Parliament from the 1970s to the 1990s. He was subsequently appointed Deputy Speaker of the House of Representatives, but on 5 August 2004, he was sentenced to six years' imprisonment for his role in the Fiji coup of 2000, however the sentence was successfully reduced on appeal.  Education and early career  Vakalalabure studied at the University of the South Pacific for a science degree in 1981 but left in 1983 to join the military and completed six tours of duty with the Fijian Military in South Lebanon reaching the rank of Captain in the regular force. He went on to complete a law degree at Bond University in Queensland and post\`graduate diploma in legal practice from A.N.U Canberra, Australia. Later received his master's degree in Law [Commercial and corporate law specializing in international trade and finance] from the University of London, England. After returning to Fiji, he served as a state prosecutor for four years under the then-Director of Public Prosecutions, Nazhat Shameem and three years as Legal advisor and Board Secretary for the Civil Aviation Authority of Fiji. In an ironic twist, he was later to be convicted and sentenced for coup-related offences by Shameem, by then a judge. Vakalalabure was also a reserve officer in the Fijian army, following secondment to the\`civil service from the regular forces. He was dismissed by Military commander Commodore Frank Bainimarama for insubordination, for refusing to return to barracks while the 2000 coup was in progress. The dismissal was never formalised or sanctioned by any due process as required by military law.  Unlawful oath conviction  Vakalalabure, who was taken hostage as a member of parliament at the time of the insurrection and sworn in as a Minister, was found guilty of illegally accepting and taking an oath of office for a ministerial position in the rebel government proposed by George Speight, the chief instigator of the coup. An investigation had uncovered incriminating documents in a briefcase belonging to Vakalalabure, and he was filmed being sworn in as Minister for Justice in an emotional ceremony. He was jailed in Korovou prison, alongside former Vice-President Ratu Jope Seniloli, and former parliamentarians Peceli Rinakama, Viliame Volavola, and politician Viliame Savu. He was allowed out of prison on 17 May 2005 to attend the funeral of his father, who had died on 6 May. On 25 May 2005, the High Court upheld an earlier decision of the Parliamentary Speaker, Ratu Epeli Nailatikau, to expel Vakalalabure from Parliament for nonattendance. Vakalalabure sued, claiming that Nailatikau's refusal to grant him leave of absence from the House for more than two sessions breached British parliamentary rules, on which Fiji's are based. Justice Filimoni Jitoko, however, struck out Vakalalabure's claim, ruling that Nailatikau's actions were constitutional and followed precedent. Ratu Rakuita Vakalalabure was also deregistered by the Fiji Law Society and disbarred from practising. This decision has been appealed to the Court of Appeal. The Law Society's disciplinary committee clarified that he could reapply in due course.  Sentence appealed and reduced  Lautoka lawyer Iqbal Khan announced on 30 August 2005 that he had filed an application on behalf of Vakalalabure and of Ratu Inoke Takiveikata, who was also convicted of coup-related offences, to have their convictions quashed. Khan claimed that the two had been denied a fair trial according to Section 29 of the Constitution of Fiji, as the trial assessors had been handpicked and therefore possibly biased. At a court appearance on 17 October 2005, Vakalalabure argued that his conviction was invalid, as the charge is subject to a two-year statute of limitations which had expired by the time of his being charged and that the sentence was wrong as it reflected other offences not attributable to Vakalalabure or to which he was not allowed to respond to. On this basis, he claimed, he was entitled to a retrial. The decision on Vakalalabure's final appeal was delayed after judge Shameem (who had convicted Vakalalabure) applied for the Supreme Court to reconstitute its panel of three judges as she believed they would be biased. Vakalabure successfully argued against Shameems application and The Supreme Court refused her application.It was the first time in Fiji that a judge whose decision is appealed against had made such an application. Cost were ordered against her and the State. On 15 June 2006, Chief Justice Daniel Fatiaki, as president of the Supreme Court, reduced Vakalalabure's prison sentence from six years to four and backdating it by four months, finding that others convicted with him had received lesser sentences. He was released on 6 July 2006 and served the remaining five months of his sentence on community work with a Christian organisation in Suva.  Expulsion from Parliament  Following the High Court's decision, President Ratu Josefa Iloilo declared Rakuita's parliamentary seat vacant on 8 June 2005 and issued a writ for a byelection, which was expected to cost F$450,000. His older brother, Ratu Osea Vakalalabure announced his candidacy, though as a candidate for the Soqosoqo Duavata ni Lewenivanua Party (SDL) of Prime Minister Laisenia Qarase, rather than the CAMV to which Ratu Rakuita belongs, but withdrew on 22 June in favour of the CAMV candidate, Niko Nawaikula, who was declared elected unopposed, thus averting the byelection.

A forestry graduate of the Australian National University, he worked for Fiji Pine Limited for more than 20 years, before leaving in 1999 to start his own company- Baba Forests. He also serves as the campaign director of the ruling Soqosoqo Duavata ni Lewenivanua Party, or SDL). He was General Secretary and more recently National Director of the party, but relinquished this post on 1 January 2006 in order to take charge of the campaign for the general election to be held from 6‚Äì13 May. In his party role, he worked aggressively to consolidate his party's support among indigenous Fijians, while attempting with little success to make inroads into the Indo-Fijian electorate. At the previous election held in 2001, the SDL received barely one percent of the vote in the seven contested communal constituencies reserved for citizens of Indian descent, a figure that only marginally improved in 2006. He also made a token bid for the Ba Open Constituency for the SDL, but garnered only 60 votes. On 15 June 2006, Baba announced his resignation from his party post.  Business controversies  On 16 December 2005, Baba was accused by two Senators of corruption. Senator Ponipate Lesavua alleged that Baba, along with Laisenia Qarase, Jr. (the son of Laisenia Qarase, Fiji's Prime Minister) and Lalesh Shankar (another SDL official), benefited from a mahogany harvest at Sote Village in Tailevu. Baba was subcontracted to Fiji Hardwood and was operating an illegal circular saw, Lesavua maintained, while Qarase Jr. and Shankar owned a company called Trapper Haulage, which had been granted the contract. \\"This is nepotism in its highest degree,\\" Lesavua said. Another Senator, Ratu Dr. Epeli Nailatikau, alleged that the Fiji Development Bank had lent Baba F$79,600 for six months, then F$24,000 three months later, to buy the saw. He questioned why Baba should be granted such loans, when the landowners themselves were not. The next day, Baba angrily denied what he called \\"cowardly\\" allegations made under parliamentary privilege. \\"It is a cowardly and vilifying attack and if there is any truth to it then the gentlemen should state what they have said, outside of Parliament,\\" Baba told the Fiji Times. He said that as one of the most qualified foresters in Fiji, he had been invited by the Sote landowners to help them set up their logging company. Fiji Hardwood chief executive Edrian Hazleman supported Baba, saying that there was no truth to Lesavua's claim that Baba was subcontracted to the company. The Prime Minister, meanwhile, said that his son was not involved with Trapper Haulage, as alleged, having withdrawn on his father's advice from his previous shareholding in the company. The allegations had been fabricated by Opposition parliamentarian Poseci Bune, Qarase said.  Civil contempt conviction  On 10 February 2006, Justice John Connors of the Lautoka High Court found Baba guilty of civil contempt, fined him F$500, and ordered him to pay court costs of F$2,500. According to a Fiji Television report on 1 March, Connors found Baba guilty of noncompliance with an order made on 15 August 2005, in which he was given three days to deliver machinery to the Merchant Finance and Investment Company Limited, his client and plaintiff. Connors noted that Baba had eventually complied with the order, but only after contempt proceedings had been initiated, and ruled that a penalty was necessary to deter other members of the community.  The 2006 coup d'√©tat  In the wake of the military coup that deposed the SDL-led government on 5 December 2006, Baba found himself at the centre of an investigation into alleged shady business dealings and political manoeuvrings. On 26 January 2007 he was taken to Suva's Queen Elizabeth Barracks for interrogation about alleged recent comments against the interim government. He was released the next day.https://web.archive.org/web/20070128195033/http://www.fijilive.com/news/show/news/2007/01/26/26fijilive0106.html Baba was again detained on 28 January, and under intense grilling by Military officials, admitted to approving the sale a government vehicle belonging to the Lakeba Pine Scheme, which he managed then. He made the admission in the presence of the buyer of the vehicle and of a Fiji Sun journalist, the Sun reported on 29 January. In 2000, he approved the sale of the vehicle to Naitasiri farmer Lemeki Natorogia for F$700. He claimed not to have known at the time that the vehicle was government-owned.

Apart from the fine calligraphy of the Persian text, the manuscript is celebrated for over forty Mughal miniatures of the highest quality throughout the text; five of these are detached from the main manuscript and are in the Walters Art Museum, Baltimore as Walters Art Museum MS W.613.Walters database entry The manuscript has been described as \\"one of the finest examples of the Indo-Muslim arts of the book\\",Schimmel & Waghmar, 264 and \\"one of the most perfect of the de luxe type of manuscripts made for Akbar\\".Losty & Roy, 49 Text The collection of five works by Nizami or Nizami is a classic of Persian poetry of which many luxury illuminated manuscript versions have been made; in particular this manuscript should not be confused with British Library, Or. 2265, a Persian manuscript of 1539-43 which is even better known.Welch, 22, 30, 70-97 The poems are in masnavi rhyming couplets. The first poem is a collection of moral discourses illustrated by stories or parables drawn mostly from the lives of historical figures, while the remaining four poems are romances, including many stories found in Persian tradition and earlier works such as the Shahnameh of Ferdowsi.Brend, 7-8, with a fuller account as the miniatures are worked through Akbar had already commissioned a smaller manuscript of the Khamsa, which was made in 1585-90.Losty & Roy, 48 The text was written by  ªAbd al- Rahƒ´m  ªAnbarƒ´n-qalƒÅm, not to be confused with Abdul Rahim Khan-I-Khana, Akbar's minister and translator from Persian,in fact  ªAbd al-Rahƒ´m  ªAnbarƒ´n- qalƒÅm, from Herat, began at the Mughal court working for Abdul Rahim Khan-I- Khana.

Roxburgh, 163, note 41 between 12 Oct 1593 and 14 December 1595, as inscriptions record.British Library Catalogue Miniatures The miniatures are attributed by inscriptions to at least twenty artists, most of them apparently Hindus, though the main artist, Khvaja Abd-al Samad, is Muslim.Brend, 66 One miniature, of Khusraw hunting, is the latest known work of Abd al-Samad, former head of the imperial workshop and one of the artists Humayun had brought from Persia some forty-five years earlier, at the start of the Mughal tradition.Titley, 193 The single scribe was Abd al-Rahim ('Abd al-Rahim 'Ambarin Qalam), a leading calligrapher of the day. Unusually, when the manuscript was inherited by Akbar's son Jahangir, an extra miniature was added by order of the new emperor with a double portrait showing the scribe at work facing Dawlat, the artist of the new miniature, making a drawing of him. This is dated, with an illegible last digit, between 1611 and 1620.Brend, 65-66 Some miniatures are the work of more than one artist, typically dividing the work between drawing the overall composition, colouring and faces. This had been a common method in the imperial workshop, but was giving way to having miniatures all painted by a single artist, as the Mughal style became increasingly concerned with fine detail and realistic depiction.Brend, 17-20; Full page image online, from the British Library Apart from their main origin in the tradition of Persian miniature painting, the style of the miniatures reflects Indian art and the Western art that was known in Akbar's court from contacts which included material brought by Jesuit missionaries.Brend, 9, 10, 12, 70 While the landscapes often show European influence, and indeed north European characteristics, the many animals depicted mostly ignore the mythical beasts often seen in Persian painting, and emphasize species native to India, depicted with considerable naturalism. The choice and emphasis of the miniatures has certain distinctive features; the selection of subjects was probably made by the royal librarian and approved by the emperor, or possibly the emperor himself, possibly also in consultation with some of the artists. One of the colophons, unusually, mentions that the book was \\"commissioned for the treasury of books and august library, servants of his majesty...\\".Brend, 80 The emphasis on the duties, difficulties and splendour of kingship is to be expected in a royal commission, but another recurring theme, of the difficulties of relationships between fathers and sons, is much more individual to this book (miniatures 5, 14, 16, 18, 20). There is a particular interest in visual art; apart from the unusual added portrait of the scribe and a painter, both Western-style art works and Hindu sculptures are depicted (miniatures, 25, 36, 44). Events in the stories are probably also intended to refer to victories of Akbar, and his generosity to the conquered.Brend, 70 Description Darius, by Dharm Das, another Walters page The manuscript in London has 325 folios of \\"light-brown polished paper\\" with a page size of 302 x 198 mm. On text pages the nastaliq script is in four columns of 21 lines.Brend, 71 There is also some text on most of the miniature pages, inside the rectangular frame in compartments of varying size, shape and placing. The miniatures have somewhat variable rectangular frames of plain lines and bands of colour, outside which there are generous borders filled with very high quality gold grisaille decoration of plants, birds and animals, with some rocks and other landscape elements. Outside this are further plain frames, with a final zone of simple pen decoration which is probably recent as the form is different between the pages in London and those in Baltimore.Brend, 8, 66 The main London portion of the manuscript has 36 full-page figurative miniatures, one a double page spread. Baltimore has four miniatures, also including one double page subject (so five pages). Two further miniatures (or one double one) are missing, as shown by a small and apparently early system of numbering the miniatures. The manuscript therefore originally had 42 pages of miniatures, counting double pages as two.Brend, 8 Some miniatures are out of their natural sequence, but the numbering suggests the manuscript was made in this way. Apart from the figurative miniatures, there are a number of pages with decorative panels of abstract motifs, plants and animals, especially at the beginning and end of sections of the work. The original painted and lacquered book covers each (front and back) have one side with a gold and brown scene of animals attacking other animals in a landscape and on the other side a scene with muted colour, one of a hunt and the other of an enthroned ruler, no doubt Akbar, being presented with the catch of game. All four scenes are enclosed in a frame with two borders of elaborate decoration, which like much of the abstract decorative work is similar in style to Persian, or Mughal, carpet decoration.Brend, 66-69; Losty and Roy, 49 History The history of the manuscript is unknown after its ownership by Jahangir; the Mughal library amounted to some 24,000 manuscripts at its height, though many were taken by the Iranian Nadir Shah when he overran much of the Mughal empire in the 18th century.Schimmel & Waghmar, 266 The known history resumes in 1909, when the London portion was bought by the collector C. W. Dyson Perrins (of the Worcestershire sauce family), who bequeathed it to the British Museum at his death in 1958. It came to the British Library when it inherited the British Museum libraries on its foundation in 1973. The Baltimore leaves had already been separated before 1909.

Biography Doubtless a native of Ireland, Clement Scotus lived in the Frankish realm in the time of St. Boniface, who was then archbishop of Mentz. He contended against Boniface's attempts to introduce the complete Roman discipline into Germany, but in vain. The archbishop cited him before a synod in 743 or 744, at which Carloman and Pepin were present. Clement was deprived of his priesthood and imprisoned for his acts and opinions, which it deemed heretical.Monum. Mogunt. pp.133, 137, 149Willibald, Vit. S. Bonif. vii. p.458 Pope Zacharias, to whom the affair was reported, approved Boniface's action and confirmed the former part of the sentence.June 22, 744; Ep. xlviii. p.133 The charges against Clement were first, that he had a wife‚Äîalthough Boniface calls her a concubine‚Äîand two children; more than this, that he justified marriage with a deceased brother's wife, in conformity with the Jewish law. =Religious beliefs= In dogmatic theology Clement held views which seemed to contradict the Latin doctrine of predestination. He also asserted that Christ on rising from the dead 'delivered all who had been Kept in prison, faithful and unbelievers, worshippers of God as well as idolaters.' This description, drawn by his enemy, probably indicates that Clement maintained a universalism of some sort. =Accusations of heresy= He was also accused of denying the canons of the church and rejecting the authority of Saint Jerome, Saint Augustine, and Saint Gregory.Monum. Mogunt. pp.133, 140, 141, 146 He had in fact brought into collision with the rigour of Latin Christianity those freer usages and more speculative habits of thought which prevailed in the Church of Ireland, at this time the fountain-head of literary culture and missionary enterprise for the west of Europe. The German opponents of Boniface, who seem to have been in a majority,Ep. lxvi. p.187 must have supported Clement. When the matter was brought before a synod at Rome, on 25 Oct. 745 (not 746 or 748, as was formerly supposed),Histoire litteraire de la France, iv. 83, 109 Deneard, Boniface's representative, stated that the archbishop was powerless to close his mouth. The synod confirmed Boniface's action, anathematised Clement, and once more declared him to be deprived of his orders.Acts, pp.136‚Äì48; cf. Ep. li. p.151, liii. p.155 But in spite of this sentence Clement persisted in his opinions, and so soon as 5 Jan. 747 we find the pope writing again to Boniface, enjoining him to re-examine the whole question at a council which was shortly to be held in Germany, and to do his best to bring Clement to repentance; should he prove contumacious, he was to be sent on to Rome.Ep. Ixiii. pp.182, 183 The outcome of the affair is not known; but it is probable that Clement's case from the beginning was prejudiced by the fact that his opinions were mixed up in all the proceedings with those of a certain Adelbert, who held views of a very fanatical character. Clement, on the other hand, to judge even from the meagre and distorted accounts of his doctrine which we possess, seems to represent in some ways the free characteristics of Irish theology expressed in the writings of his countryman, John Scotus, a century later. This Clement has been often confounded with Clement Scotus II; cf. Dempster, 'Hist. Eccl. Gent. Scot.' iii. 177, 178.

Career In 1976, he was awarded The Queen's Police Medal for long and distinguished service. In 1982, he received a commendation for outstanding service in connection with Pope John Paul II's visit to Manchester. He had special responsibility for co-ordinating security, which was a major task because of an earlier attempt on the Pope's life. In 1984, he retired and was awarded the OBE. In his distinguished career he was involved in hundreds of murder inquiries and earned a reputation as a \\"super- sleuth\\". To reporters, he was known as Manchester's Maigret, after the fictional Parisian detective. He jailed several cells of the I.R.A. bombers at the height of the terrorist threat and achieved a 97 per cent murder detection rate in the 10 years that he led the C.I.D.

Life Clement Scotus II arrived, according to tradition, from Ireland on the coast of Gaul, with another Irish scholar, around the time when Charlemagne began his sole rule (i.e. after the death of Carloman in 771). The two men were received at the Frankish court, and Clement was entrusted with the education of a number of pupils. The account of Clement's appearance in the Frankish realm rests solely upon the authority of the monk of St. Gall, who wrote towards the end of the ninth century, and whose narrative contains an element of fable. Clement is mentioned in a catalogue of the abbots of Fulda: Ratgar, who was abbot from 802 to 817, sent a certain Modestus and other monks to Clement the Scot to learn grammar. Clement was, then or later, resident at the Frankish court; there is a poem by him addressed to Lothar as emperor (i.e. after 817), from which it appears that Lothar was his pupil; and another poem, by Ermoldus Nigellus, describes Clement as active in the festivities at Ingelheim on the occasion of the baptism of the Danish king Harald in 826. The year of Clement's death is not known, but the day is given as 29 March in a necrology preserved in a W√ºrzburg manuscript of the ninth century. His character is celebrated in a poem by Prudens, otherwise unknown, who ranks him first among the teachers in the palace school. Works Two grammatical works exist in manuscript bearing Clement's name; one is an 'Ars Grammatica' (also described as 'De Partibus Orationis'), the other, which is possibly only a part of the same, 'De Barbarismo.' Confusion of names This Clement Scotus has been misidentified, firstly with Clement Scotus I, the opponent of St. Boniface, and secondly with Claudius, bishop of Turin, who died about 839, and was Spanish. In consequence of this confusion the two Clements and Claudius have been called 'Clemens Claudius' or 'Claudius Clemens'. The distinction between the three men was examined by Nicolaus Antonius, 'Bibliotheca Hispana vetus,' i. 469-61 (Madrid, 1788).

Early life Friedrich Richard Petri was born on July 31, 1824, in Dresden, Germany to master shoemaker Heinrich Petri and his wife Juliane Dorothea (Weise) Petri. At age fourteen, Petri was enrolled at the Dresden Academy of Fine Arts where he would remain for eleven years under the tutelage and guidance of Adrian Ludwig Richter and Julius H√ºbner. Petri won six awards and a scholarship to a further education in Italy, upon completion of which he was to return to the Dresden institution as an instructor. Petri was unable to accept the offer due to physical frailty. Hermann Lungkwitz, who married Petri's sister Elisabeth, befriended Petri while at the Dresden academy. Petri and Lungwitz joined other students in the failed 1849 May Uprising in Dresden, an event at the tail end of the Revolutions of 1848 resulting from the refusal of Frederick Augustus II to recognize a constitutional monarchy. Texas In 1850, the Lungkwitz and Petri families emigrated to the United States, landing first in New York City. They migrated to Wheeling, West Virginia, but decided on the destination of Texas in 1851. Their journey took them by ship to New Orleans and Indianola, and then riding an oxcart to New Braunfels. In 1852, the two families bought a 320-acre farm for $400 in the settlement of Pedernales, Texas near Fredericksburg and took up farming and cattle ranching. Future Texas politician Jacob Kuechler married Petri's sister Marie in 1856, and became a part of the family business. Like many German immigrants to the American South, the Lungkwitz and Petri families chose not to own slaves but worked their farms themselves. Petri's health remained frail for the duration of his life, but he continued his pencil sketches and watercolor paintings. His work reflects a fascination with the casual amicability between German settlers and local tribes of Delaware, Shawnee, Penateka Comanche and Lipan Apache, with meticulous attention to physical appearance, attire and lifestyle . Death Petri drowned in the Pedernales River during the winter of 1857, and is buried in the family cemetery in Gillespie County, Texas.

She is best known for \\"Don't Let Me Cross Over\\" a song she wrote which reached #1 on the country music charts in late 1962. Penny Jay was born in Monteagle, Tennessee. When her Mother, Edna Tobitt Adams remarried they moved to Knoxville, TN and Jay began performing with her mother at church functions at the age of 10. Cas Walker, a Knoxville merchant and host of a radio show on local WROL (which is also credited with helping launch the careers of Dolly Parton and the Everly Brothers) featured Penny Jay performing under the name \\"Little Miss Helen\\" when she was 12. Jay played stand-up bass and guitar, and became a fixture on the show during the early '40s. \\"Little Miss Helen\\" was the very first Golden Girl of Knoxville, Tennessee. In the early '50s, Jay began performing as part of a duo with a friend named Marie Wilson. The pair were billed as \\"Jenny & Jill\\", and they recorded several original sides for OKeh Records, including \\"A Million Other Hearts\\". Jay moved to Nashville in the early '60s, and began performing and writing songs for other artists. She was signed to Republic Records, but her contract was picked up by Decca Records. She ultimately released eight singles on Decca, including \\"Just Over The Line\\", \\"Lonely And Unwanted\\", and \\"Those Kinds of Girls\\". Jay performed at the Grand Ole Opry, and on Roy Acuff's \\"Midnight Jamboree\\" radio show broadcast from Ernest Tubb's record shop. (She also toured, during the Korean War, for the USO. Penny enjoyed singing for all the military troops. Her USO Tours carried her to China, Japan, Philippine Islands, Iceland, Greenland,and Hawaii.) Jay's band at this time included her daughter, Sherry Moyers, who was the first female professional C/W Drummer in Nashville. Jay had her greatest success as a professional songwriter, and in 1962 scored a #1 hit on the country charts when Carl and Pearl Butler recorded her song \\"Don't Let Me Cross Over\\". Originally released in November 1962, the song reached the number-one spot on the Billboard Country Singles chart on December 29, 1962. The song eventually spent 11 (non-consecutive) weeks at number one, and has become a country-music standard. It has been covered by over 30 artists, including George Jones, Jerry Lee Lewis, and Dolly Parton. Other songs Jay wrote include Skeeter Davis' \\"Set Him Free\\", Jimmy Martin's trucker ode \\"Widow Maker\\", and many more. Jay eventually stopped performing in the 1970s, and moved to Nashville, Arkansas in 1996 to live with her daughter and son-in-law, guitarist Bobby Chambers. She died in 2006. She was buried in Knoxville, Tennessee.

Grange de Lings is often quotedhttps://lincolnshireshowground.co.uk/visiting-us/contact-us.php as the address for the Lincolnshire Showground, just off the west of the A15, but the parish actually lies entirely east of the A15, and the Lincolnshire Showground is in the parish of North Carlton. The parish is sometimes hyphenated as Grange-de-Lings. The north-western corner of the parish is at the A1500 junction with the A15, at a roundabout. The boundary follows Horncastle Lane eastwards where it neighbours Welton, to the north. At Dunholme, it follows southwards across the old runways of RAF Dunholme Lodge, of which the western end was in Grange de Lings. It briefly meets Scothern, and a small section of the parish extends between Scothern and Nettleham, to meet the A46, which it follows for around 200 metres. The boundary with Nettleham passes westwards, then south-west across Hall Lane, then meets Riseholme, where it follows a line due west to the A15 (Ermine Street), meeting South Carlton just south of the pylons across the A15. The western boundary of the parish is the A15, and just north of Watering Dyke Houses, it meets North Carlton at the perimeter fence of the Lincolnshire Showground (wholly outside the parish). There is an oil well in the north of the parish, next to the boundary with Welton, part of the East Midlands Oil Province.

He was responsible for the restoration of the historic Moffat Mission precinct which became renowned as a conservation area and as a beacon of hope in the troubled last years of Apartheid. He was born in the United Kingdom in 1930 and died at Wimborne on 13 January 2011. Early training and ministry in South Africa Butler was trained at Kelham Theological College from 1951 and was in due course ordained deacon at Southwark Cathedral in 1956 prior to serving in the Diocese of Bloemfontein in South Africa. He was ordained priest in Bloemfontein in 1957. In 1960 he transferred to the Diocese of Kimberley and Kuruman to serve as a Curate at St Cyprian's Cathedral in Kimberley. Butler commenced his ministry amongst the Tswana of the Northern Cape when Bishop Philip Wheeldon sent him to Kuruman in 1961 as Rector and Director of St Paul's, a vast mission district at the edge of the Kalahari. His wife, Hilda, whom he married at the Moffat Mission Church in Kuruman in 1964, has recalled that \\"he hitch hiked with one suitcase along a dirt road from Kimberley to Kuruman. The chap who gave him a lift bought him an old Chev car.\\" Butler would serve in the area from 1961 to 1965, doubling up as Director of the Bothithong Mission from 1963 to 1965. \\"He loved the Northern Cape and her people and said that it was the 'real' Africa.\\" Bishop Wheeldon appointed Fr Butler as his Honorary Chaplain in 1963‚Äì1965. Botswana Butler was sent by his Bishop in 1965 to Bechuanaland Protectorate (still within the Diocese of Kimberley and Kuruman) to the yet- to-be-built Gaborone, a capital city for the anticipated independent state of Botswana. There he was to found and build Trinity Church, an ecumenical venture, as well as being involved in such projects as starting up a Co-op food store and initiating the start of a multi-national school. He was also at one time deputy mayor of Gaborone. Fr Butler remained there until 1970, a historic period when the protectorate became independent as Botswana (1966) and when church jurisdiction was transferred to the Diocese of Matabeleland (also from 1966). Butler subsequently returned for a time to England to serve as vicar at St James, Fletchampstead, Diocese of Coventry. Kuruman Moffat Mission In 1979 Butler volunteered to work once again in \\"his beloved Kalahari\\", South Africa. Bishop Graham Chadwick took up his offer and invited him to work again in the Kuruman area as a priest in the Diocese of Kimberley and Kuruman and to commence the massive task of restoring the Kuruman Moffat Mission of which he became Director. Butler worked there for the next 14 years. Previously the notorious Apartheid Group Areas Act had decreed the historic Kuruman Mission site to be in a whites only area. This effectively divided the people from their church, with the latter falling into disuse. Butler's predecessor, the Revd Humphrey Thompson, ran the mission for fifty years (as had Moffat) ‚Äì and did what he could to maintain mission activities during these troubled times. Upon Butler's appointment and through the 1980s the Moffat Mission was transformed into being, as he put it, \\"a focus for new hope in a disturbing age.\\" One priority was to restore and conserve the buildings and their setting, promoting tourism to help generate an income and awareness about the work of the Mission. He developed a retreat and the Maphakela conference centre, cultivating a Moffat Mission Community which included a network of helpers from near and far. Fr Butler, who wore a beard \\"every bit as dramatic as Moffat's,\\" as was often said, wrote and published extensively on the mission and its history. He also amassed a collection of memorabilia, artefacts, paintings, photographs, documents and books associated with the history of the Mission, and he was responsible for developing a museum within the 4 hectare precinct. A crowning achievement in 1996 was the return of Moffat's printing press, from the Africana Library in Kimberley, for which he had campaigned tirelessly since taking up Directorship of the Mission. In 1994, in South Africa's first democratic elections, Butler was asked to be an Electoral Officer for the Northern Cape. He had always been interested in politics and this was, as his wife has put it, \\"the cherry on the cake.\\" Retirement at Wimborne Fr Butler was made a Canon of Kimberley Cathedral before he and his wife Hilda retired to Wimborne in the south of England in 1995. There he became part of the Minster staff, where he was also an enthusiastic bellringer, practising a skill he had learned in his youth. He was a member of the Ancient Society of College Youths, the premier change ringing society in the City of London, to which he was elected in 1947. Amongst his other accomplishments were sign-writing and book-binding.

It provides for the educational needs of boys and girls from Junior Infants to Rang 6. There were 214 pupils on roll in September 2009. History Following an application in early 1986 to set up an All-Irish Primary School in Monaghan town the Department of Education authorised an all-Irish stream as part of St Mary's Boys National School. The first class of 23 children was based in the old Brothers' House adjacent to the St. Mary‚Äôs building and commenced in September 1986. The all-Irish stream, Sruth Ultain, continued for three years and in 1989, the Department sanctioned an independent school, Gaelscoil Ultain. The school has since been situated in the Old Brothers‚Äô School and was blessed by Dr. Joseph Duffy, Bishop of Clogher, in May 1990. Location Having been in the Old Brother's school building at the top of the hill on the Clones Road since 1989, it has been announced that an educational campus on the site of the Army Barracks in Monaghan Town will be built, and in particular, the inclusion on the campus of a new permanent building for Gaelscoil Ultain. 25 year celebrations The school will celebrate 25 years in existence in 2011 by launching a programme of events. These will include the St Patrick's Day parade in March, A 'Ceolchoirm Paist√≠' in April and a reunion event in the Hillgrove Hotel on Sunday June 5, amongst other activities. School ethos Gaelscoil Ultain is a co-educational school providing for the educational needs of boys and girls from Junior Infants through to Rang 6. All school subjects, with the exception of English, are taught through the medium of Irish. English is given exactly the same amount of teaching time as in any other primary school in Ireland. Irish is the primary language of communication within the school. When children begin school the teachers speak only Irish to them. Within a short space of time children understand the language and before long and in the most natural way possible become bilingual. All areas of our Irish culture are treated with special regard within the school and we endeavour to instil in the children a love for our music, dance and games. Religion and its teaching are integral parts of our school life and the children are prepared for First Holy Communion and for Confirmation. There are now more than 150 All-Irish schools in Ireland with full recognition from the Department of Education. Gaelscoileanna are allocated an extra teacher and a higher capitation grant than an equivalent English medium school.

Since 2017 he has been Managing Director and Chief Executive of Wesfarmers, the Perth- headquartered publicly listed industrial and retail conglomerate, which in 2016 was Australia's largest company by revenue and Australia's largest employer. As a sweep-oared heavyweight rower Scott was a national champion, an eight-time crewman in West Australian King's Cup eights and a four-time Australian representative at World Rowing Championships. He is a dual Olympian oarsman who won a silver medal in a coxless pair at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics. Early life and education Scott was born in Perth, Western Australia in 1969. His parents were teachers and he spent time in Kalgoorlie and Dumbleyung before completing his schooling at the public co-educational high school Rossmoyne Senior High School in Perth where he was introduced to rowing. He commenced tertiary studies at Curtin University and after accepting a rowing scholarship to the Australian Institute of Sport completed his Bachelor of Commerce at the Australian National University in Canberra. He holds a Master of Applied Finance degree from Macquarie University and has a Graduate Diploma in Applied Finance and Investments. He is a qualified chartered accountant, and has attended a six-week Advanced Management Program at Harvard Business School. Rowing career =Club and state rowing= Scott's senior club rowing was initially from the Swan River Rowing Club in Perth and later from the Curtin University Boat Club. His first state representative selection came in the Western Australian youth eight selected to compete for the Noel Wilkinson Trophy at the 1988 Interstate Regatta within the Australian Rowing Championships. He stroked that crew. In 1989 Scott was selected in the West Australian senior men's eight to compete at the Interstate Regatta for the King's Cup. He rowed again in West Australian King's Cup eights in 1990, 1993, 1994, 1995, 1996, 1999 and 2000. He stroked those WA eights in 1993, 1994 and 1996. Scott contested national championship titles at the Australian Rowing Championships on a number of occasions. In 1996 in Curtin University colours he won the national coxless pair title (the Ted Bromley Memorial Trophy) with David Weightman and at stroke he won the 1996 national coxless four title in a composite selection crew. =International representative rowing= Scott's first Australian representative appearance was in the 1989 Trans Tasman U23 series. He stroked one of the two Australian eights selected for the series of three match races against New Zealand. They won one match race and were twice beaten by the other Australian crew. In 1990 at the Nations Cup in Linz, Austria ‚Äì the equivalent at that time of the World Rowing U23 Championships ‚Äì Scott rowed in the seven seat of the Australian eight which achieved an overall fifth placing. In 1990 Scott was elevated to the Australian men's eight and he raced in that crew at the 1990 World Rowing Championships in Lake Barrington, Tasmania to a seventh-place ranking. All of Scott's national representative appearances for the next few years would be in the Australian eight. Scott rowed in the eight at the 1991 World Rowing Championships in Vienna where the boat finished tenth. He was one of only two members of that crew to hold their seats coming into the 1992 Olympic year. The eight was full of fresh faces and to comply with AOC guidelines needed additional international experience and results to justify selection. Accordingly, the men's eight had to gain international results at the Lucerne regatta pre- Olympics to be included in the team. The crew qualified and in Barcelona 1992 Rob Scott stroked the eight to the Olympic final and a fifth-place finish. Scott carried on rowing at the highest level post Barcelona. He stroked the Australian eight to a fourth placing at the 1993 World Championships in Racice. Two years later at the 1995 World Championships in Tampere, Scott was again in the stroke seat for the Australian eight's eleventh-place finish. In 1995 the New South Wales pair of Robert Walker and Richard Wearne had won World Championship silver in the coxless pair and were aiming for Olympic gold in 1996. However Scott and Queenslander David Weightman won the national title that year and were chosen by selectors to row the coxless pair at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics. Scott and Weightman believed they had a real chance of gold and threw everything at their opponents in the final 500 m of a thrilling final. They had to be content with second place and a silver medal behind the British pair of Steve Redgrave and Matthew Pinsent. 1996 saw Scott awarded as the Western Australian Sports Star of the Year for his 1996 achievements in rowing. Aside from the Olympic silver that year, he had won gold and silver at international regattas in Cologne and Duisburg, gold in the pre-Olympic trials in Lucerne and had won two Australian national titles (the open coxless pair and open coxless four ‚Äì both at stroke) at the 1996 Australian Rowing Championships. Weightman and Scott paired up again toward the end of the next Olympiad in a late campaign for Sydney 2000. They both regained seats in their state eights at the national level in 1999 and 2000 and as Australian representatives they raced a coxless pair at two World Rowing Cups in Europe in 1999 and again in 2000. They placed third in the first outing but finished sixth in those other regattas. The gun Australian pair at that time were James Tomkins and Drew Ginn and although Ginn suffered a back injury at the first 2000 World Rowing Cup event, he was replaced by Matthew Long. Weightman and Scott weren't picked to the Australian squad for the 1999 World Championships and ultimately did not qualify for Sydney 2000. Professional career Scott commenced his career at Wesfarmers in 1993 and they supported his rowing aspirations. In the mid 1990s Scott moved into investment banking and worked for nearly a decade in Sydney and Hong Kong for Deutsche Bank. In 2004 he rejoined Wesfarmers and progressed through a number of senior executive roles. He was General Manager, Business Projects; CEO of Wesfarmers Insurance (from 2007); Finance Director of Coles Supermarkets (from 2013); Managing Director, Financial Services (from 2014); then the Managing Director of the Wesfarmers Industrials Division (from August 2015). His appointment as Managing Director and CEO of Wesfarmers in November 2017 saw him replace Richard Goyder and become the eighth Chief Executive in Wesfarmers' 103-year history. At the time of his appointment Wesfarmers was Australia's ninth-largest listed company by market capitalisation. In other leadership roles, Scott was appointed Chairman of Rowing Australia in 2014 and a director of the University of Western Australia Business School Advisory Board. He is a director of Gresham Partners Holdings Limited (a financial advisory business half-owned by Wesfarmers) and is a past president and director of the Insurance Council of Australia. Personal Scott is married to Australian Olympic gold-medal winning water polo player Liz Weekes. They have two children.

It falls under this jurisdiction of Cumbria County Council. Location Stapleton is located around 8 miles away from Longtown and around 12 miles away from Carlisle. Stapleton is located just east of the B6318, its nearest main road, and around 12 miles away from the M6 motorway, one of the major motorways in the United Kingdom. The nearest railway stations are Brampton (Cumbria) railway station which is around 7 miles away and is operated by Northern and is on the Newcastle and Carlisle Railway. Population According to the 2001 UK Census there are 87 households in the parish of Stapleton, with a population of 221 people. This makes it an extremely small parish. In 1991, the population of Stapleton was 230 people. This means the population has decreased around 4.5% in the past 10 years. This is slower than the population decrease in England as a whole, which is thought to be around 8% every 10 years. However the overall decrease in the English population is the underlying reason for a reduction in small parish's populations. In 1851 UK Census the population of Stapleton was recorded as 1119 people, this is the highest recorded population of the parish, and in the next UK census, in 1881 the parish's population had dropped significantly, to 372 people. The population taken at the 2011 Census was 249. Attractions The South Tynedale Railway stop Kirkhaugh Station is located 18 miles from Stapleton. The South Tynedale Railway is a heritage railway that runs from Alston in Cumbria to Lintley in Northumberland. The railway line is renowned for its location, as it is England's highest narrow gauge railway line. The South Tyndale Railway attracts an estimated 40,000 tourists a year, making it one of Cumbria's main tourist attractions. St. Mary's Church is the Parish's church. It is located in the centre of the township and was erected in 1830 on the site of a church thought to be dating back to the 12th century. The Lanercost Priory is around 6 miles away from Stapleton. The original priory was built in 1169, as a monastery but was destroyed in 1536 by Henry VIII in a period of mass dissolution of monasteries. It is believed that Anglican services have been held in the Priory every Sunday for the past 850 years, making it one of the long-standing Anglican churches. It is an English National Heritage Site.

He was raised as a ProtestantCain: Sutton Index of Deaths - 1975, cain.ulster.ac.uk; accessed 2 April 2014. and attended Edenderry Primary School. On an unknown date, Boyle joined both the Portadown company of the UDR (as a part-time member) and the Portadown unit of the UVF Mid-Ulster Brigade. He held the rank of major in the latter organisation, which at the time was commanded by Billy Hanna. Despite a vetting process, joint membership of the UDR and loyalist paramilitary organisations was common. Paramilitaries joined to obtain weapons, training and intelligence. Vetting procedures were carried out jointly by the military Intelligence Corps and the Royal Ulster Constabulary's Special Branch and if no intelligence was found to suggest unsuitability individuals were passed for recruitment and would remain as soldiers until the commanding officer was provided with intelligence enabling him to remove soldiers with paramilitary links or sympathies.

The brigade formed part of what later became known as the Glenanne gang. This was a violent loyalist group which operated out of a farm owned by RUC reservist James Mitchell, and comprised rogue elements of Northern Ireland's security forces as well as the UVF and to a lesser extent, the Ulster Defence Association (UDA). This loose alliance carried out sectarian attacks and killings of Catholics, often, although not always, those seen as upwardly mobile, during the 1970s.\\"Collusion in the South Armagh/Mid Ulster Area in the mid-1970s\\" , patfinucanecentre.org; accessed 2 April 2014.

His allegations were published in 2003 in the Barron Report which was the findings of the official investigation into the bombings by Irish Supreme Court Justice Barron. According to submissions received by Mr. Justice Barron, the Monaghan bomb (which exploded 90 minutes after the Dublin bombs), was assembled at Boyle's home in Festival Road in the Killycomain estate.\\"How Loyalists got the bombs to Dublin\\" by Donal O'Maolfabhail, Thepost.ie, 19 January 2003 Hidden Hand reported that Boyle (along with Jackson and Hanna) was run as an agent by Captain Robert Nairac, the Military Intelligence Liaison officer attached to 14th Intelligence Company. The programme named Boyle as one of the prime suspects in the Dublin car bombings. Former British soldier and psychological warfare operative Colin Wallace confirmed that Boyle had \\"close social links\\" to Captain Nairac. John Weir alleged that Boyle was part of the Glenanne gang who shot a PIRA volunteer (John Francis Green) dead near Castleblaney, County Monaghan on 10 January 1975.

Author Martin Dillon suggested in his book God and the Gun: the Church and Irish Terrorism that Boyle was one of the leaders of the unit. At about 2.30 a.m., as the band was returning home to Dublin from a performance at the Castle Ballroom in Banbridge, their minibus (driven by trumpeter Brian McCoy) was stopped on the A-1 road at Buskhill, seven miles (11 km) north of Newry, at a bogus military checkpoint by UVF gunmen dressed in British Army uniforms. At least four of the other men, like Boyle, were serving members of the UDR. The band members were lined up with their hands on their heads facing a ditch and asked to give their names and addresses. Saxophonist Des McAlea, who survived the attack, later testified that Boyle had become angry at some of the other gunmen who had joked with the band members about the success of their performance that night.Martin Dillon. (18 March 1999), God and the Gun: The Church and Irish Terrorism. pp. 58-60, Routledge; 1st edition; / At this point, Boyle and Wesley Somerville went to the front of the minibus and placed a ten-pound time bomb under the driver's seat.

According to The Dirty War by Martin Dillon, the plan behind the UVF bombing was to portray the band members as republicans smuggling explosives for the Provisional IRA.Martin Dillon (1991), The Dirty War.

Three of the band members were killed: trumpeter Brian McCoy, guitarist Tony Geraghty, and lead singer Fran O'Toole. Saxophone player Des McAlea and bassist Stephen Travers were both wounded, the latter having been shot with dum-dum bullets. Several days before the Showband attack, Mid-Ulster UVF leader Billy Hanna was shot dead, allegedly by Robin Jackson, who assumed command of the brigade. According to authors and journalists Martin Dillon, Paul Larkin and Joe Tiernan, Boyle had accompanied Jackson when the latter shot Hanna outside his home in Lurgan.Martin Dillon, The Trigger Men, Mainstream Publishing (new edition 12 August 2004), /, p. 25 Paul Larkin.

An international panel of inquiry (headed by Professor Douglass Cassel, formerly of Northwestern University School of Law), commissioned by the Pat Finucane Centre to investigate allegations of collusion between loyalist paramilitaries and the security forces, concluded there was credible evidence that Jackson was the principal perpetrator of the Miami Showband killings. Although questioned afterwards by the RUC, he never faced charges.The Cassel Report (2006), p. 68 Two serving UDR soldiers and one former UDR soldier: Lance-Corporal Thomas Crozier, Sergeant James McDowell, and John James Somerville (brother of Wesley) were given life sentences for the killings. At the time the Miami Showband attack occurred, the UVF was not an illegal organisation, the ban against them having been lifted in April 1974, by Merlyn Rees, Secretary of State for Northern Ireland. The UVF would be proscribed by the British Government again in October 1975. Aftermath Within 12 hours of the attack, the UVF issued the following statement giving an account of the event: > A UVF patrol led by Major Boyle was suspicious of two vehicles, a minibus > and a car parked near the border. Major Boyle ordered his patrol to > apprehend the occupants for questioning. As they were being questioned, > Major Boyle and Lieutenant Somerville began to search the minibus.

Boyle and Somerville were given UVF paramilitary funerals, complete with gun volleys. Eight women dressed in black walked in front of the cortege. The service was conducted by Free Presbyterian minister William McCrea, a Democratic Unionist (DUP) politician. The UVF journal Combat published sympathy letters from both the \\"A\\" Company of the 9th Battalion, Ulster Defence Regiment and the Protestant Action Force, a cover name used by the UVF.Interim Report on the report of the Independent Commission of Inquiry into the Bombing of Kay's Tavern, Dundalk, p. 158 Two weeks after the Miami Showband attack, a popular Portadown disc jockey Norman \\"Mooch\\" Kerr (aged 28) was shot dead by an IRA gunman as he was packing up his equipment after a show he had put on at the Camrick Bar in Armagh. Although not a member of any loyalist paramilitary organisation, he had been a friend of Boyle and the two were often seen together.\\"Special Branch agent colluded in Miami killings\\", Portadown Times, 21 December 2011; retrieved 31 March 2012. Boyle had occasionally helped Kerr run his mobile disco.Murray, Raymond (1990). The SAS in Ireland. Ireland: Mercier Press. p. 141 The IRA claimed it killed Kerr because he was an associate of Robert Nairac. According to Martin Dillon, Boyle and Wesley Somerville served as role models for Loyalist Volunteer Force (LVF) leader Billy Wright, and it was their violent deaths which motivated him to join the UVF in 1975. Wright took over the Mid-Ulster UVF Brigade from Robin Jackson in the early 1990s before going on to form the LVF. The RT√â programme Today Tonight aired a 1987 documentary in which it was claimed that former UVF associates of Boyle revealed to the programme that Nairac detonated the bomb deliberately at Buskhill in order to eliminate Boyle, with whom he had carried out the Green assassination. Sunday Tribune journalist Emily O'Reilly noted that none of the three men convicted of the Miami Showband killings ever implicated Nairac in the attack or accused him of causing Boyle's death.\\"The MI5 Scandal: Does the Evidence Stand Up?\\" by Emily O'Reilly, The Sunday Tribune, 22 March 1987, p. 4 There is a mural and memorial plaque dedicated to Boyle in Portadown's Killycomain housing estate, where he had grown up.Mural Directory by Jonathan McCormick About 100 people, 16 loyalist bands and a UVF military guard of honour were present at the mural's unveiling on 30 July 2005, following a parade through the estate.

It was an addition to infrastructure which helped to communicate the power of the imperial family, and through its economic success, it funded the creation of new mosque complexes such as the Atik Valide Mosque complex in Istanbul. Mimar Sinan is the credited architect of the √áemberlita≈ü Hamamƒ±. However, in his five-volume autobiography which lays claim to all his completed works, the √áemberlita≈ü is only cited once in the fifth volume written after his death. When compared to the Atik Valide Mosque Complex which he lists in all five volumes, the √áemberlita≈ü Hamamƒ± was likely built by the team of architects that worked under him and completed his smaller projects with little to no supervision. Exterior view of one of the domes = Architectural Elements = √áemberlita≈ü was built on Divan Yolu, a processional road from the Byzantine Era that once led to Rome.Ergin, Nina. ‚ÄúBathing Business in Istanbul: A Case Study of the Cemberlitas Hamami in the Seventeenth and Eighteenth Centuries.‚Äù Bathing Culture of Anatolian Civilizations: Architecture, History, and Imagination, Peeters, 2011, pp. 142‚Äì169. There were two separate sections for men and women. The men's front entrance was decorated with a gold thuluth inscription on a green background written by the poet Sa'i-I Da'i praising the patron Nurbanu Sultan and the hamam. In contrast, the women's entrance was placed in a discreet area with no decoration to preserve their modesty. The first room of √áemberlita≈ü Hamamƒ± through the entrance is a dressing room, or sogukluk, to change for the bath. The chambers are built of wood and space provides a lounge for socializing and a place to get refreshments after services were performed. Following that is the iliklik, or warm room, which is a narrow hallway to prepare for the hot room, or sicaklik, where people are bathed. The sicaklik is a square room but with the placement of its 12 columns and bathing chambers and niches in recesses around the perimeter, it gives the illusion of a dodecagonal space. In the center is a heated marble slab, or g√∂bektasƒ±, where bathers would lay to work up a sweat. In the back of √áemberlita≈ü is the furnace, which provides centralized heat for the entire building. Modeled after ancient Roman heating systems, there is a hollow created between the bottom of the building and the foundation underneath where smoke and hot gases circulate and push through flues between the walls to heat the rooms, with someone fueling the fire. The √áemberlita≈ü Hamamƒ± allowed for a cultural gathering of the Turkish and led to great financial success. When referred to in economic reports listing the profit success rankings of the city, the √áemberlita≈ü was often listed above many other places of business such as shops, fields, gardens, and houses which were taxed for revenue.Cichocki, Nina. The Life Story of the √áemberlita≈ü Hamam: from Bath to Tourist Attraction.  Employees  √áemberlita≈ü was located in a central area of Istanbul surrounded by mosques and near a bazaar so it serviced a large number of Istanbulites, mainly men. Due to its popularity, there were many different positions to work in the hamam. For the women's section, there was a hamam anasi or ‚Äúmother of the hamam‚Äù as given by the literal translation. Some people oversaw the running of the hamam and a team of supervisors and fee collectors worked under them. There were cooks to make coffee and refreshments, a furnace stoker, laundrymen, bathhouse attendants, servants, and tellaks (people who bathed the customers). Tellaks were often migrants or people who didn't have homes in Istanbul, and instead lived permanently in the hamam and sent a portion of their salary, which was made up of tips, to their family. Until the late 18th century, the majority of them were Albanian and the job was generational, with men following in the footsteps of their fathers to work there. Tellaks were chosen based on physical strength, appearance, and an approachable personality before being trained in the art of caring for their future customers by learning to wash hair, clean their bodies, and massaging them with the scrubbing glove. Patrona Halil Rebellion In 1730 Patrona Halil, an Albanian working in the √áemberlita≈ü Hamamƒ± started a rebellion based on what the urban community felt like were grievances against them. With his leadership, a mob rising resulted in the forced removal of Sultan Ahmed III and ushering in of the new king, Mahmud I. As a result of the war Patrona was executed along with thousands who stood behind him and bathhouses became a place that the government feared could cultivate social unrest. Seeing as Halil was Albanian, there was an active effort to discriminate on any who remained working in the hamams. Following 1730, all workers needed to be registered following the rebellion and if they were Albanian and they left Istanbul to return to their hometown they would be barred from working there upon return, and any new workers had to be from either Istanbul or Anatolia in an effort to push out and discriminate against any remaining Albanians. Interior view of the men's sogukluk  Signs of Wear and Tear  Multiple fires affected the √áemberlita≈ü Hamamƒ± during its lifetime. During the Ottoman Empire, buildings like √áemberlita≈ü in Istanbul were built with stone and brick. The lack of a fire fighting unit also contributed to the amount of damage each fire. In July 1660, there was a fire that raged so intensely over two days that left √áemberlita≈ü and the area around it so devastated that rent at the hamam was slashed in half. The region of Istanbul, Turkey is high in seismic activity so the area around the √áemberlita≈ü Hamamƒ± is frequented with earthquakes. However, due to the hamams practice of alternating brick with layers of stone masonry, the √áemberlita≈ü Hamamƒ± was able to absorb violent movements. There were massive earthquakes in 1719, 1754, and 1766 along with a fire in 1782 that resulted in extensive structural damage to the hamam.  Renovations/Modernization  Icareteyn is the practice of double renting and became popular in the eighteenth century so people would invest capital as a result of the decline of the √áemberlita≈ü' revenue. By allowing renters to become co-owners and not have to rent for limited terms it encouraged them to invest money in renovations and restorations rather than ditching the efforts after an earthquake or fire to the bathhouse they would have to give up months later. This lasted until 1829 when the hamam didn't need the financial help anymore. Front facing view of the entrance Most of the renovations we see now done to the √áemberlita≈ü Hamamƒ± occurred during the nineteenth century when there was more of an effort to modernize turkey like its European counterparts. In February 1667-8, around 6% of the √áemberlita≈ü income was spent on water conduits and unspecified repairs. In 1768 a royal decree was issued prohibiting further construction of hamams as they were causing too much of a strain on the water and fuel supply. This allowed for the focus of hamams to be on the renovation and preservation of existing structures. In 1770, there was work done on the inscription on the marble room dividers in the men‚Äôs hot room, evidenced by inconsistencies in the calligraphy. Prior to March 1786, there were again renovations made to the water conduits outside Istanbul that supplied the √áemberlita≈ü. There were also renovations in 1790 to the interior and the roof of √áemberlita≈ü and waterways. In 1805 the lead cover of the domes and water conduits and unspecified places. During the Tanzimat Period that took place from 1839-1876, Istanbul‚Äôs architecture was on reform, with more emphasis being placed on Byzantine monuments. Streets were remodeled to direct towards these relics of a powerful past, and bathhouses were rendered insignificant in comparison. Mustafa Resit Pasa, an urban planner who had travelled to Europe on diplomatic missions admired European city planning and strived to recreate it in istanbul. In 1868, he renovated Divan Yolu around the √áemberlita≈ü Hamamƒ± after a fire in 1865. Sewers were installed, streets were widened and streets were to cut through blocks to point towards historic monuments, all of which required the partial demolition of part of the √áemberlita≈ü Hamamƒ± and its dome, forcing the women‚Äôs section to be closed indefinitely. The street level surrounding √áemberlita≈ü rose so much that a staircase was built to allow entry into the men's sogukluk and broken off diagonally so that women could access their own entrance to the women's iliklik. Until December 2003, the women's sogukluk was converted to a restaurant serving traditional Anatolian food.  Conversion to Tourist Attraction  With the ushering in of the Turkish Republic in 1922, bathhouses were rendered obsolete, often being completely destroyed to make way for new infrastructure. The √áemberlita≈ü Hamamƒ± however, had a consistent influx of money almost entirely from tourists which allowed it to remain standing. After people started living in apartments with bathrooms the use of hamams became more and more obsolete, so the √áemberlita≈ü Hamamƒ± was visited less out of necessity and more for the search of historical relics. Tourism became the primary revenue for the √áemberlita≈ü Hamamƒ±, as foreign visitors now make up the majority of visits to the hamam itself. Hamams have held a high appeal by foreign tourists due to its romanticization in cultures as a sensuous experience in movies, artwork, and through the stories of travelers throughout the decades. Amongst these, orientalist paintings, films, travel, magazines, and guide books also contributed to the belief that hamams like the √áemberlita≈ü were worth visiting. On the other side, many Turkish citizens consider historical relics like the √áemberlita≈ü Hamamƒ± to hold cultural significance as a callback of the Ottoman empire.

They are described as \\"partridge-francolins\\" in literature establishing their phylogenetic placement outside the monophyletic assemblage of true spurfowls. All species are endemic to Sub-Saharan Africa, excepted the double-spurred spurfowl (also present in Morocco). They are commonly known as spurfowls or francolins, but are closely related to jungle bush quail, Alectoris rock partridges, and Coturnix quail. The species are strictly monogamous, remaining mated indefinitely. They procure most of their food by digging. Spurfowls subsist almost entirely on roots, beans of leguminous shrubs and trees, tubers, and seeds, and feasting opportunistically on termites, ants, locusts, flowers, and fruit. Important predators are jackals, caracals, servals, and birds of prey, as well as herons and marabou storks. The genus Pternistis was introduced by the German naturalist Johann Georg Wagler in 1832. The name is from the Ancient Greek pternistƒìs meaning \\"one who strikes with the heel\\". The type species was designated by the English zoologist George Robert Gray in 1841 as the Cape spurfowl (Pternistis capensis). Most of the species within the genus formerly included \\"francolin\\" in their common name. Beginning in 2004 various ornithologists have recommended that it would be clearer to restrict the use of \\"francolin\\" to members of the genus Francolinus and closely related species and to use \\"spurfowl\\" for all members of the genus Pternistis. This recommendation was adopted in 2020 by Frank Gill and colleagues in the online list of world birds that they maintain on behalf of the International Ornithological Committee (IOC). The common name \\"spurfowl\\" is also used for the three Asian species that are placed in the genus Galloperdix.

His establishment was the site of the Battle of Montgomery's Tavern. He was born in Gagetown, New Brunswick, the son of Alexander Montgomery who came there from Stamford, Connecticut after the American Revolution. In 1798, the family moved to York in Upper Canada. Montgomery served on the Niagara frontier during the War of 1812 and fought in the Battle of Queenston Heights. He operated a number of taverns in the York area, including The Bird in the Hand at Yonge Street and Finch Avenue, in 1828.Finch historical plaque He leased this inn out in 1830, and that year began building Montgomery's Tavern further south on Yonge Street. Montgomery was also a road commissioner for York County and a director for the Mutual Insurance Company. Sympathetic with the concerns of the Reformers, Montgomery helped send William Lyon Mackenzie to England in 1832 to present petitions to the British Colonial Office. He also helped found the Bank of the People in 1836. Although he signed a declaration of Toronto Reformers and joined a vigilance committee formed as a result in July 1837, Montgomery did not advocate open rebellion. In December, he was informed that his tavern would be the rebel base; Montgomery was to serve as commissary. John Linfoot, who had leased the tavern and would take possession in February 1838, had already moved in at the time and Montgomery was in the process of moving out. On December 7, on the orders of Francis Bond Head, the tavern was burned and Montgomery was arrested and charged with high treason. He was sentenced to be executed but his sentence was reduced and he was sent to Fort Henry to await exile to Tasmania. He escaped to Rochester, New York, where he became president of an association for Canadian refugees. After receiving a pardon, Montgomery returned to Toronto in 1843. He rebuilt a new tavern on the site of the old one and continued to operate a number of taverns in Toronto. He also operated a hotel at the north-east corner of Church Street and Colborne Street for over three years after his return. Montgomery moved to Markham Township in 1871 and served as postmaster there. In 1873, he received $3000 in compensation for the loss of his tavern. He died in Barrie.

The four other poems are medieval romances. Khosrow and Shirin, Bahram-e Gur, and Alexander the Great, who all have episodes devoted to them in Ferdowsi's Shahnameh, appear again here at the center of three of four of Nezami's narrative poems. The adventure of the paired lovers, Layla and Majnun, is the subject of the second of his four romances, and derived from Arabic sources. In all these cases, Nezami reworked the material from his sources in a substantial way. The Khamsa was a popular subject for lavish manuscripts illustrated with painted miniatures at the Persian and Mughal courts in later centuries. Examples include the Khamsa of Nizami (British Library, Or. 12208), created for the Mughal Emperor Akbar in the 1590s.

French Navy schooner Enfant Prodigue was a schooner, built in America in 1790 and coppered in December 1790 at Lorient.Demerliac (2004), n¬∞203, p. 38. The French Navy purchased her at Bordeaux in 1796.Winfield and Roberts (2015), p. 250. The French Navy commissioned her as an aviso under Lieutenant Pierre Guiyesse. From 1 February 1798 to 7 March 1798, she ferried passengers from Cap-Fran√ßais to A Coru√±a, and later from Ferrol to Lorient.Roche (2005), p. 175.Fonds Marine, vol.1, p. 191. In 1799 she captured the British schooner in a fight that resulted in Charlotte having one man wounded. Capture On 24 June 1803, captured Enfant Prodigue between St Lucia and Martinique after a chase of 72 hours. Captain James O'Bryen of Emerald reported that Enfant Prodigue was pierced for 16 guns but had thrown all of her guns, however many she actually mounted, overboard during the chase.Norie (1842), pp.254 & 421. Head money was paid 25 years later. The British took Enfant Prodigue into service as the brig-sloop HMS Saint Lucia, of 14 guns. She was commissioned in August under Commander Conway Shipley.Winfield (2008), p.348. British warship On 16 August 1803, Saint Lucia captured the French privateer Sally. Sally was armed with six guns and had a crew of 28 men. In August‚ÄìSeptember Saint Lucia captured three prizes: *French sloop Eliza (1 August), carrying mahogany and mill timber; *brig Lucretia (16 September), carrying sugar; and, *schooner Diana (27 September), carrying coffee and sugar. Around November, Saint Lucia recaptured the brig Earl St. Vincent, which had been sailing from Dublin to Barbados, and a Swedish schooner. The French privateer Harmonie, of Martinique, had captured them three days earlier. Saint Lucia was unable to capture the privateer which escaped by throwing her guns overboard and sawing down her gunwales. On 25 January 1804, Saint Lucia captured the French privateers Furet and Bijou. Furet was out of Guadeloupe. She was armed with four guns and had a crew of 45 men. Bijou, which Saint Lucia captured off Grenada, was armed with six guns, and had a crew of 60 men, twenty of whom she had put on two prizes. The two prizes were the brig Good Intent, which had been sailing from Barbados to Demarara, and which had since retaken, and the schooner Fancy, which had been sailing from Demarara to Barbados. In May Commander Robert Reynolds replaced Shipley, who transferred to , and in November Commander James Ayscough replaced Reynolds. Commander Charles Gordon replaced Ayscough in 1806. Fate On 20 March 1807 the French privateers Vengeance (12 guns) and Friponne (5 guns) captured Saint Lucia off Guadeloupe. Before she struck her colours, Saint Lucia had suffered seven men dead and eight wounded. Gordon had initiated the action but his first broadside disabled three of his cannonades when the recoil pulled their breaching bolts out of the timbers.Hepper (1994), p. 119. The fourth broadside similarly disabled a fourth cannonade. He turned to use his other broadside, but lost two more cannonades when their recoil caved in the bulwarks. Saint Lucia fought on for two more hours but then surrendered when the French approached with the intention of boarding her.A number of sources give the name of the commander of Saint Lucia as Michael De Courcy, but the court-martial records confirm that her commander was Gordon. Her subsequent fate is unknown. Notes, citations, and references Notes Citations References Hepper, David J. (1994) British Warship Losses in the Age of Sail, 1650-1859.

The other bridge is the Kurt Schumacher Bridge. The road bridge connects a network of roads from behind Mannheim Palace across the Rhine to Ludwigshafen. It carries Federal Highway 37 and a tram track. Two rail bridges are adjacent to the road bridge, carrying the Palatine Ludwig Railway and the Rhine-Neckar S-Bahn line. History  In 1669, the Elector Charles Louis built a floating bridge, which consisted of a platform secured to two barges anchored in the Rhine. In 1705 this bridge was replaced by a pontoon bridge that had to be rebuilt as a result of flood damage. In the age of industrialisation and the railway, it became increasingly important by 1863 to build a fixed bridge at the site of the pontoon bridge. The bridge was designed in 1863 and 1864. The first chairman of the planning commission was Paul Camille von Denis. The combined road and rail bridge was built between 1865 and 1868. Impressive portal buildings, designed by the Karlsruhe architect Josef Durm, were built at the ends of the bridge. A sculpture of Minerva with industry and trade made by Karl Friedrich Moest was erected on the railway bridge.Hermann Alexander M√ºller: Biographisches K√ºnstler-Lexikon, published by the Bibliographischen Instituts, Leipzig, 1882, p. 379 f. The bridges themselves were built as steel trusses. Their total length was about 270 metres, the railway bridge was 7.5 metres wide and the road bridge was 6.5 metres wide. On each side there was a footpath. By 1906 the bridge was found to be too narrow. It took until 1928 to begin planning an upgrade of the bridge. A new railway bridge was built directly beside the existing bridge in 1931 and 1932. The old railway bridge was converted for road traffic. The new bridge was also built with a steel framework, but without arches. In 1936 the bridge was named by the Nazis after Albert Leo Schlageter.Stadtarchiv der Stadt Ludwigshafen am Rhein (ed.): Geschichte der Stadt Ludwigshafen am Rhein: Vol 2., Vom Ende des Ersten Weltkrieges bis zur Gegenwart. Ludwigshafen am Rhein 2003, , p. 253 At the end of World War II on 20 March 1945 the bridge was blown up by the German army. After the war, temporary bridges were built over the Rhine River connecting the railway in July 1946 and for the road in December 1948. =Konrad Adenauer Bridge = The road bridge was rebuilt between 1956 and 1959 and opened on 24 October 1959 under the name \\"Rhine Bridge\\".

History Prior to the 1950s, most of the area surrounding today's suburb of Elizabeth was farming estates. After the end of the Second World War and the accompanying shortage of materials, the state government decided that South Australia needed to grow and become an industrialised state. A satellite city was planned for northern metropolitan fringe of Adelaide, and the South Australian Housing Trust initiated a housing development program in the area, with a purchase of of rural land between the established townships of Salisbury and Smithfield. Elizabeth, the suburb, was established within the District Council of Salisbury on 16 November 1955, being named after Queen Elizabeth II, who visited the city in 1963. More than seven years later, the Salisbury council was renamed to be the District Council of Salisbury and Elizabeth in 1963 in recognition of the burgeoning community on its northern lands. A year later, on 1 July 1964, the municipality of the Town of Elizabeth was created by severance from the District Council of Salisbury and Elizabeth, and the latter reverted to the name Salisbury. The new municipality encompassed most or all of the suburbs of Elizabeth North, to the north, Elizabeth Park, to the north east, Elizabeth East, to the east, Elizabeth Grove and Elizabeth Vale, to the south east, Elizabeth South, to the south and south west, and Elizabeth West (now most of Edinburgh North and the southern half of Davoren Park), to the north west. The City of Elizabeth was amalgamated with the City of Munno Para in 1997 to form the City of Playford. Twenty years hence, the term 'Elizabeth', in the context of Adelaide, still typically referred to the pre-amalgamation municipality encompassing both the suburb of Elizabeth and those suburbs surrounding it, and the distinct community they comprised. A total of nine suburban localities clustered around the Elizabeth town centre were named for the City of Elizabeth, by which they were locally governed at some point: * Elizabeth South * Elizabeth North * Elizabeth East * Elizabeth West (abolished in 2011 and split between Edinburgh North and Davoren Park) * Elizabeth Downs * Elizabeth Field (abolished in 1993; now Davoren Park) * Elizabeth Grove * Elizabeth Park * Elizabeth Vale Community The early town centre, now Elizabeth Shopping Centre, had open air shopping malls and a theatre called the Octagon. Residential suburbs of Elizabeth were established with the earliest being Elizabeth South and Elizabeth North. Each was configured as a local community around a small shopping centre containing a supermarket, bank, hotel and service station along with other shops. Automotive manufacturer Holden established a manufacturing plant in the area, becoming a major employer along with the Department of Defence with its Long Range Weapons Establishment, later the Defence Science and Technology Organisation, and RAAF Base Edinburgh. Migrants were encouraged to settle in Elizabeth and its suburbs. Elizabeth had large areas of open space, with the most prominent being Fremont Park, on Main North Road. Elizabeth was the sister city of Fremont, California; Lake Elizabeth in Fremont Central Park is named for the city. Elizabeth also had a strong music scene, providing a home for Jimmy Barnes, John Swan, Bernard \\"Doc\\" Neeson and Glenn Shorrock, among other musicians.

History The name \\"Rua Reidh\\" is a semi-anglicisation of \\"Rubha R√®idh\\" meaning a flat headland. A lighthouse on Rubh'Re Point was first proposed by David Stevenson in 1853. Building was started by his son, David Alan Stevenson in 1908 and the light was first lit on 15 January 1912. The light came from a paraffin lamp, subsequently converted to electricity. The original Fresnel lens is now in the nearby Gairloch Heritage Museum. The fog siren gave 4 blasts every 90 seconds. The fog siren was discontinued in 1980 as well as all the fog sirens in Scotland. The red fog siren trumpet, along with its clockwork timing mechanism were removed and were donated to the Gairloch heritage center and put on display. The siren's tower and engine room were partially demolished. All that is left is the first floor of the siren's tower and the front facade of the engine room. The fog signal equipment was auctioned off and the pressurised air tanks were removed and sold for scrap. To the north, a quay and ramp provided access from the sea at high tide. This was the only access for supplies until the road from Gairloch was built in 1962 and can still be seen. This new road was first satisfyingly driven on by Iain Bain (1922‚Äì2011). Paraffin was pumped from the quay and other goods were transported on a small trolley on rails.  Lighthouse buildings Since automation of the light in 1986, the adjacent accommodation is no longer required for keepers and was sold into private ownership. Since 2004 the lighthouse has been protected as a category B listed building. Several of the outbuildings have since been in use as Bed and breakfast and self-catering tourist accommodation.

Bah√°'√≠s are also encouraged to avoid jobs related to the production or sale of alcohol and are forbidden from involvement in the drug trade. Those addicted to alcohol or other drugs should seek medical assistance from doctors and/or support from organizations dedicated to curing addiction.Smith, Peter (2008-04-07). An Introduction to the Baha'i Faith. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. p. 168. . Christianity Christian views on alcohol are varied. Throughout the first 1,800 years of Church history, Christians generally consumed alcoholic beverages as a common part of everyday life and used \\"the fruit of the vine\\" in their central rite‚Äîthe Eucharist or Lord's Supper. They held that both the Bible and Christian tradition taught that alcohol is a gift from God that makes life more joyous, but that over-indulgence leading to drunkenness is sinful or at least a vice.Raymond, p. 90. In the mid-19th century, some Protestant Christians moved from a position of allowing moderate use of alcohol (sometimes called moderationism) to either deciding that not imbibing was wisest in the present circumstances (abstentionism) or prohibiting all ordinary consumption of alcohol because it was believed to be a sin (prohibitionism). Many Protestant churches, particularly Methodists and other Evangelical groups, advocated abstentionism and were early leaders in the temperance movement of the 19th and 20th centuries. Today, all three positions exist in Christianity, but the historic position remains the most common worldwide, due to the adherence by the largest bodies of Christians, namely Lutheranism, Roman Catholicism, Eastern Orthodoxy and Anglicanism. In the Catholic Church, the Eucharistic wine becomes the Blood of Jesus Christ through transubstantiation. In Lutheran theology, the essence of the wine is the blood of Christ, but the substance remains wine.An Explanation of Luther's Small Catechism, (LCMS), question 291) In other Protestant denominations, the wine is a symbol of the blood of Christ. Monastic communities like Trappists have brewed beer and made wine. Hinduism Hinduism does not have a central authority which is followed by all Hindus. Some texts forbid the use or consumption of alcohol while some texts praise the ritualistic consumption of soma (a divine psychedelic drink). According to Manusmriti, consumption of alcohol is natural and not forbidden. According to Vishnusmriti, Brahmin varna are not allowed to consume alcohol. The other three varnas, Kshatriya, Vaishya and Shudra, are allowed to consume it. Some sects, like the Aghori, use it as part of their ritual. In the Rig Veda all kinds of alcoholic drinks or intoxication are considered as a recipe of sinfulness, weakness, failure and destruction in several verses: Buddhism Buddhists typically avoid consuming alcohol (surƒÅmerayamajja, referring to types of intoxicating fermented beverages), as it violates the 5th of the Five Precepts, the basic Buddhist code of ethics and can disrupt mindfulness and impede one's progress in the Noble Eightfold Path. Jainism Jains do not consume fermented foods (beer, wine and other alcohols) to avoid killing of a large number of microorganisms associated with the fermenting process. In Jainism alcohol consumption of any kind is not allowed, neither are there any exceptions like occasional or social drinking. The most important reason against alcohol consumption is the effect of alcohol on the mind and soul. In Jainism, any action or reaction that alter or impacts the mind is violence (himsa) towards own self, which is a five-sense human being. Violence to other five sense beings or to own self is violence. Sikhism An initiated Sikh cannot use or consume intoxicants, of which wine is one. Islam There is a consensus among theologians that the word khamr, meaning \\"intoxicants\\", refers to alcohol and all similar kind of beverages causing drunkenness, and that alcohol consumption is forbidden, \\"It is strictly prohibited.\\" In the Quran, intoxicants, i.e. all kinds of alcoholic drinks, are variably referenced as incentives from Satan, as well as a cautionary note against their adverse effect on human attitude in several verses: Another verse acknowledges the small benefit of wine but notes that its harm is much bigger. The Quran states that one of the delights of Paradise for the righteous is wine which does not intoxicate as a promise by God. = During the time of Muhammad = At the beginning of Islam, even during the first battles, Muslims possibly drank alcohol. The prohibition of alcohol came many years after Muhammad had started his mission. This is documented in the Sunni Hadiths (the sayings and traditions of Muhammad). JƒÅbir ibn Abd Allah (ÿ¨ÿßÿ®Ÿêÿ± ÿ®ŸÜ ÿπŸéÿ®ŸíÿØ ÿßŸÑŸÑŸá) narrated: \\"Some people drank alcoholic beverages in the morning [of the day] of the ‚ÄôUhud battle and on the same day they were killed as martyrs, and that was before wine was prohibited.\\" ‚ÄôAnas ibn MƒÅlik (ÿ£ŸéŸÜŸéÿ≥ ÿ®ŸÜ ŸÖÿßŸÑŸêŸÉ) narrated that the people said: \\"...some people [Muslims] were killed [in the Battle of UhudBattle of ‚ÄôUhud ] while wine was in their stomachs.' [...] So Allah revealed: 'There is not upon those who believe and do righteousness [any] blame concerning what they have eaten [in the past] if they [now] fear Allah and believe and do righteous deeds...'\\" [sura 5:93] Some scholars and writers, for example Gerald Drissner, suggested that the fact that the Muslims were sober (and their enemies possibly drunk) led to an advantage in battles. This could have been the reason why the Muslims - although most of the time outnumbered - were advancing so quickly and defeated the enemy (Meccans) with relative ease. Judaism Judaism relates to consumption of alcohol, particularly of wine, in a complex manner. Wine is viewed as a substance of import and it is incorporated in religious ceremonies, and the general consumption of alcoholic beverages is permitted, however inebriation (drunkenness) is discouraged. This compound approach to wine can be viewed in the verse in Psalms 104:15, \\"Wine gladdens human hearts,\\" countered by the verses in Proverbs 20:1, \\"Wine is a mocker, strong drink is riotous; and whoever stumbles in it is not wise,\\" and Proverbs 23:20, \\"Be not among drunkards or among gluttonous eaters of meat.\\" = The Bible = The biblical narrative records the positive and negative aspects of wine. Wine is a beverage of significance and import, utilized in ceremonies, for example, celebrating Abraham's military victory and successful liberation of Lot,, Malchizedek, the king of Salem, greeted and blessed Abraham with bread and wine. festive meals,, Isaac partakes of bread and wine prior to confering his blessing on Jacob.On tithing one tenth of one's animals and produce, the tithe is to be consumed in Jerusalem, should a person be unable to transport the tithes themselves to Jerusalem, he is instructed to utilize the proceeds from the sale of the tithe items on food and drink items - including wine - that he is to consume in a festive meal Jerusalem. One can thus utilize these proceeds \\"for whatever you wish ‚Äî oxen, sheep, wine, strong drink, or whatever you desire. And you shall eat there in the presence of the Lord your God, you and your household rejoicing together,\\" . and the libations comprising the sacrificial service.A meal offering consisting of flour and oil, and a wine libation accompany certain sacrifices, verses 3-5 in , et. al. In Gen. 9:20-27, Noah becomes intoxicated from his wine on exiting the ark and lies unclothed in his tent where his youngest son, Ham, discovers Noah asleep, and \\"views his (Noah's) nakedness.\\" Noah becomes aware of this the following day and curses Ham's son Canaan. In Gen. 19:31-37, in the aftermath of the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah, Lot became inebriated on wine and had sexual intercourse with his two daughters. Moab (the father of the biblical nation by the same name) and Ben-Ammi (the father of the nation of Ammon) were born to Lot of this incest with his daughters.Verses 31-37 in . Religious service in the Temple must be void of consumption of alcohol or wine, as the priests are admonished, \\"Do not drink wine nor strong drink... when you enter the tabernacle of the congregation, lest you die.\\" = In halakha = Halakha (Jewish law) mandates the use of wine in various religious ceremonies (such as sanctifying the Sabbath and festivals with wine at their start and conclusion, and at circumcision and at marriage ceremonies). The beverage required as \\"wine\\" by Jewish law generally permits the use of a non-alcoholic grape extraction (grape juice) for all ceremonies requiring wine .Shulchan Arukh, Orach Chaim 272:2 Excessive consumption and drunkenness, however are discouraged. According to the thirteenth century Orchot Chaim, as quoted in Beit Yosef \\"inebriation is entirely prohibited and there is no greater sin than drunkenness\\" and it is \\"the cause of many sins\\".Orach Chaim:695 (Beit Yosef) A Nazirite voluntarily takes a vow to abstain from grapes or any of their byproducts (including wine), he refrains cutting the hair on his head, and he may not become ritually impure by contact with corpses or graves.Verses 3-8 in . While one motivation for becoming a Nazirite may be a reaction to \\"risky behaviors\\" associated with alcohol abuse (Tractate Sotah, BT 2a), the term of the vow of the Nazirite is ordinarily a fixed term, with grapes and wine again permitted at the end of the term. = Contemporary Judaism = Anecdotal evidence supports that Jewish communities, on the whole, view alcoholic consumption more negatively than Protestant Christian groups. The small sample of Jewish individuals viewed alcohol as destructive while a sample of Protestants referred to it as \\"relaxing\\". The proliferation of \\"kiddush clubs\\" in some synagogues, and the institutional backlash to that proliferation, however, may provide an indication of growing awareness of alcohol abuse issues in Jewish communities. A number of specifically Jewish non-profit addiction rehabilitation and education programs, such as the Chabad Residential Treatment Center in Los Angeles and Retorno in Israel, provide treatment for alcoholism (and other substance) abuse within a specifically Jewish framework for recovery. The non-profit Jewish institutions are supplemented by for-profit rehab centers with a Jewish focus. Shinto Sake is often consumed as part of Shinto purification rituals. Sakes served to gods as offerings prior to drinking are called Omiki or Miki („ÅäÁ•ûÈÖí, Á•ûÈÖí). People drink Omiki with gods to communicate with them and to solicit rich harvests the following year. Vodou (Voodoo) In the Vodou faith of Haiti, alcoholic drinks such as rum are consumed to be able to allow spirits called \\"lwa\\" to enter one's body and help them find the motivation for or strength to survive everyday struggles or life. Historical religions Bacchus pours wine from a cup for a panther, while Silenus plays the lyre, circa 30 BC. In Ancient Egyptian religion, beer and wine were drunk and offered to the gods in rituals and festivals. Beer and wine were also stored with the mummified dead in Egyptian burials.Hanson, David J. History of Alcohol and Drinking around the World, http://www2.potsdam.edu/alcohol/Controversies/1114796842.html Other ancient religious practices like Chinese ancestor worship, Sumerian and Babylonian religion used alcohol as offerings to gods and to the deceased. The Mesopotamian cultures had various wine gods and a Chinese imperial edict (c. 1,116 B.C.) states that drinking alcohol in moderation is prescribed by Heaven. In the ancient Mediterranean world, the Cult of Dionysus and the Orphic mysteries used wine as part of their religious practices. During Dionysian festivals and rituals, wine was drunk as way to reach ecstatic states along with music and dance. Intoxication from alcohol was seen as a state of possession by spirit of the god of wine Dionysus. Religious drinking festivals called Bacchanalia were popular in Italy and associated with the gods Bacchus and Liber. These Dionysian rites were frequently outlawed by the Roman Senate. In the Norse religion the drinking of ales and meads was important in several seasonal religious festivals such as Yule and Midsummer as well as more common festivities like wakes, christenings and ritual sacrifices called Bl√≥ts. Neopagan and Wiccan religions also allow for the use of alcohol for ritual purposes as well as for recreation. Health Research has been conducted by social scientists and epidemiologists to see if potential links exist between religiosity and alcoholism.

Woodside set and still holds several NCAA records, including: * Single season highest percentage of field goals made under 40 yards (min. 16), 100% (23 for 23; 1982; tied with 8 others) * Single season most times kicking two or more field goals in a game, 10 (1982, tied with 2 others) Woodside holds many career and single-season kicking and scoring records at West Virginia University, including: * Longest field goal, 55 yards against Louisville (1984) * Single season field goals made, 28 (1982) * Single season field goals attempted, 31 (1982) * Career field goals made, 74 * Career field goals attempted, 93 * Consecutive field goals made, 15 (1981‚Äì82) =Freshman season= After beating two scholarship kickers for the starting job, Woodside finished the season fourth in total scoring with 34 points. Woodside was successful in eight out of 12 field goal attempts and 10 out of 11 extra points. WVU finished the season with a record of 9-3, including a win in the Peach Bowl over Florida. In the bowl game, Woodside kicked four field goals, including a 49-yard field goal, second-longest in WVU history at the time and currently among the longest field goals in WVU history. The team finished the season with top-20 rankings in both national polls. =Sophomore season= As the full-time placekicker for WVU, Woodside finished the season as the team's leading scorer with 116 points, a team record at the time for kickers and second only to Ira Errett Rodgers's 147 points scored in 1919. Woodside's 28 field goals in 31 attempts set the NCAA Division I record for most field goals in a season. It also set the record in both categories for a single season at WVU, records that stood until 2014. Against Rutgers and Syracuse, Woodside scored 14 points, among the top ten performances by a kicker in WVU history. WVU finished the season with a loss against Florida State in the Gator Bowl and was ranked in the top 20 in both national polls. Woodside was named to the UPI All-America second team and AP All-America third team. =Junior season= As a junior, Woodside continued to show excellent form as a placekicker. He again led the team in scoring with 100 points, currently fifth highest all time among kickers at WVU. He completed 21 of 25 field goal attempts, currently second and third all-time records at WVU. Woodside was perfect in 37 extra-point attempts. His 50-yard field goal against Pacific tied Ed Kenna's 1901 record for the longest field goal for WVU and is still among the longest recorded in school history. WVU defeated Kentucky in the Hall of Fame Bowl with Woodside kicking field goals of 39 and 23 yards. For the third consecutive season, WVU finished in the top 20 in both polls. Woodside was named to the Sporting News All-America first team and the UPI All-America second team. =Senior season= Woodside kicked the game-winning field goal in the fourth quarter of WVU's upset over Penn State, helping WVU beat the Nittany Lions in one of the biggest games in WVU football history‚Äîthe first victory against Penn State in 29 years. Woodside led the team in total scoring for the third consecutive year with 73 points (15 for 21 in field goals and 28 for 28 in extra points). Woodside broke his own record for the longest field goal in WVU history with a successful 55-yard attempt against Louisville. Five weeks later, he kicked a field goal of 53 yards against Syracuse. At the end of his career at WVU, Woodside was responsible for four of the five longest field goals in school history. WVU completed the season with a record of 8-4, including a victory over Texas Christian University in the Bluebonnet Bowl, the fourth consecutive bowl appearance for WVU. WVU was ranked in the top 25 in both national polls. Woodside was named to the All-America first team. Post-college career Woodside was drafted in the 12th round of the 1985 NFL draft by the Buffalo Bills as the 333rd pick. He did not make the team. In 1987, he was a member of the Kansas City Chiefs, but did not attempt any field goals or extra points. In 1999, Woodside was inducted into the West Virginia University Sports Hall of Fame. Woodside was featured in A Few Seconds of Panic (2008), journalist Stefan Fatsis's everyman account of attending the 2006 Denver Broncos training camp as a 43-year-old placekicker. Woodside was among the coaches who helped prepare Fatsis with instruction on technique, form, and kicking philosophy. Woodside continues to provide kicking instruction through camps and personal training sessions. He is known for his unfailing enthusiasm for his students and their abilities and for his belief in using positive reinforcement.

The viaduct was built as part of the New Haven, Middletown and Willimantic Railroad's line from New Haven to Willimantic, forming part of a more or less direct route between Boston and New York City. The directness of the route required the railroad to cross several deep ravines, including that of Flat Brook, southeast of East Hampton, via high-level bridges; this one would be named after Charles A. Rapallo, one of the railroad's directors. When Edward W. Serrell, then the Chief Engineer of the railroad, set out to design the high iron bridge that would span the valley in about 1870, bridges constructed completely from wrought iron were still a very new technology. Despite Serrell's experience and high reputation as a bridge builder, he was not able to work out precisely what shape the bridge members should take, and their design was subcontracted to the Phoenix Iron Works, which was to build the bridge. While the structure was originally intended to carry a double track, Serrell's apprehensions about the strength of the bridge led him to reduce it to a single track before completion. and Serrell was apparently discharged as Chief Engineer by the time of the bridge's completion in 1873, when he wrote to the Connecticut railroad commissioners expressing his apprehension over the design and construction of the iron bridges on the line, including the Rapallo and Lyman Viaducts. The commissioners had the bridges inspected by James Laurie, an eminent civil engineer, who pronounced them fit for use. Although the New Haven, Middletown and Willimantic was completed in 1873, the Panic of 1873 and the high expenses of construction bankrupted it and forced its reorganization as the Boston and New York Air-Line Railroad in 1875. After a few years of attempted competition, it was leased by the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad in 1879, which was the operator of the viaduct thereafter. By the early 20th Century, the iron viaduct's capacity was inadequate for the New Haven's heavier freight trains, and in 1911, the New Haven submitted to the state railroad commissioners a plan to encase Flat Brook in a culvert and fill in the viaduct. The plan was approved, and from 1912 to 1913, sand was dumped from the tracks over the viaduct trestles until it was completely buried. The fill was topped with a layer of cinders, hiding and preserving the viaduct. Passenger service over the filled viaduct ended by 1937, and the rails were abandoned entirely in 1965. The viaduct was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1986, when the abandoned railroad was opened as a rail trail. The viaduct is still covered in fill, although its largely intact condition was verified in 1979 when a sewer line was buried in the fill. Part of the culvert collapsed in 2007, but was repaired and the fill restored that year. The fill covering it protected it where other iron bridges in the state have been demolished, so that the Rapallo and Lyman viaducts are the only surviving bridges in the state from the first generation of wrought iron bridge construction.

Built about 1750, it is a well-preserved and architecturally unusual example of period architecture. It also has a well-documented history, having association with one of Connecticut's leading physicians of the early 19th century, and an incident in the American Revolutionary War. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982. Description and history The William Tully House is located on the north side of North Cove Road, between it and the eponymous North Cove in eastern Old Saybrook. North Cove Road is a historic road dating to the mid-17th century. The house is a 2-1/2 story wood frame structure, four bays wide, with a central chimney and centered doorway. Architectural evidence suggests it was originally built as a single-room house, with an attic loft and basement kitchen, which was later enlarged. The house's name, Heartsease, is of uncertain origin. There is no documentation why this name came about, but it could be in relation to the flower Viola tricolor (also known as heartsease) once growing in the yard. It could also be related to its use as a summer house for working girls during the 19th century. The house was built circa 1750. The exact construction date is not documented, but William Tully's father divided his land holdings in 1745. This event, and the 1779 American Revolutionary War incident described below, guided architectural historians to date the house at about 1750, assuming that William Tully built the house soon after receiving the land. The house was the site of a minor incident on August 8, 1779, in which Tories from Middletown sought release of some of their own goods to sell to the British. The second William Tully defended the property, killing two of the attackers. The house was later owned by Dr. William Tully (the fourth with that name), described as one of Connecticut's leading scientific doctors of the first half of the 19th century and a teacher at the Yale Medical School. and See also *National Register of Historic Places listings in Middlesex County, Connecticut References Category:Houses on the National Register of Historic Places in Connecticut Category:Houses in Old Saybrook, Connecticut Category:Colonial architecture in Connecticut Category:Houses completed in 1750 Category:National Register of Historic Places in Middlesex County, Connecticut Category:Historic district contributing properties in Connecticut ","title":"William Tully House"},{"id":"30482888","text":"Polyptychus claudiae is a moth of the family Sphingidae.

The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2000. Description and history Villa Bella Vista is located east of the village center of Chester, on the north side of Old Depot Road just east of Connecticut Route 154. It is a large two-story structure, set on a hill overlooking the Connecticut River. It is built out of concrete faced in stuccoed stone, with a three-story tower at the northwest corner, which (like the main roof) has a shallow pitch with deep overhangs. The east side of the house has an open piazza sheltered by pergolas, with French doors providing access to the piazza from the house. There are several second-floor balconies, one of which is accessed by doors having Gothic pointed arches. The villa was built in 1908, and was designed by the owner, Eila Pierre, who was inspired by the Italianate architecture of farmhouses in northern Italy. Although she was not a professional architect, she drew up the plans herself, adapting the form and materials to the settings of the hilltop site. The construction work was conducted by Italian immigrant masons who also did work on the nearby Gillette Castle.

Unimog based 6x6 overlanding capable RV  Class A motorhome  luxury bus conversion (Class A) Constructed on either a truck chassis, a specially designed motor vehicle chassis, or a commercial bus chassis, a Class A motorhome resembles a bus in design and has a flat or vertical front end with large side windows. Slideouts on these vehicles may allow for wider living areas when parked. = Bus conversions = A commercial passenger bus that has been converted into an RV is a ‚Äúbus conversion‚Äù. Depending on the components added, such conversions are typically the largest motorhomes available.  Truck conversion motorhome  The term \\"truck conversion\\" has generally come to mean a heavy-duty truck (class 7/8 semi) chassis with a lengthened frame and living quarters built on. Advantages of a truck conversion over a standard Class A are safety, ease of service/maintenance, and usually a much higher power-to-weight ratio, since most semi-tractors are built to move a combined weight. A disadvantage is that with the engine up front, they are louder than when the engine is in the back. They also tend to have a smaller interior than an equivalent-length Class A, since the engine/cab area does not contribute to the living quarters. Truck conversion motorhomes are most popular with the racing and horse community since they are often much better suited to pulling heavy trailers than most other classes of motorhomes.  Class B motorhome (campervan)  A small class B campervan Built using a conventional van, to which either a raised roof has been added or the back replaced by a low-profile body (aka coach-built). In Australia, a Class B motorhome is distinct from a campervan, as it is based on a large van that is, in turn, based on a truck. These motorhomes weigh up to 4,500 kg and measure up to 6.4 m in length. Most Australian campervans are based on much smaller vehicles such as the Toyota HiAce, while the middle ground is now populated by larger vans that blur the definition of campervan or motorhome. These include the Ford Transit, Mercedes-Benz Sprinter, Fiat Ducato, and Iveco. In the United States and Canada, Class B motorhomes are built on several different chassis depending on the motorhome manufacturer and engine design aims. Common chassis include the Mercedes Benz Sprinter diesel, the Dodge Ram Promaster gas, the Chevrolet Express gas, and the Ford Transit gas and diesel. In the State of California, in order to qualify as Class B RV, a vehicle must have four of the following six built in items: # a water system, typically a sink or shower # a refrigerator # a cooking system # a fuel or 110 V electrical system # an AC unit or heater # a toilet  Class C motorhome  A Class C motorhome A Class C motorhome is built upon a minimal truck platform with a forward engine and transmission connected by driveshaft to a rear axle that propels dual-mounted rear wheels. Class C motorhomes are typically powered by gasoline (petrol) engines, although some have been converted to run on propane (autogas) while others use diesels. Transmissions are almost always automatic. The original chassis is equipped from the truck factory to the coach builder with an attached forward cab section that is van or conventional truck based (known as a cutaway chassis). In North America, the Ford E350 or E450 chassis are the most typical in the 21st century, while in prior times the Dodge/Ram and Chevrolet/GMC chassis were also used. Some smaller micro motorhomes were produced on Nissan and Toyota platforms from 1972‚Äì1994, Toyota Motorhomes continue to have a strong following. Some very large Class C motorhomes are based on even larger truck platforms, such as the Ford F650 and Freightliner XC chassis. In Europe, Ford and Fiat manufacture the majority of Class C motorhome chassis. The rigid outer weatherproof superstructure of a Class C motorhome (attached onto the original cab and chassis) was typically constructed of a wooden frame covered by sheet metal, but in recent decades such materials as fibreglass, plastics, composites, and lightweight metals have become the norm. With the introduction of slideouts, the earlier design notion of increasing interior space by lengthening the entire motorhome (thus escalating the purchase price) gave way to new designs that offer increased width (albeit only possible in a completely stationary vehicle) while no longer requiring additional length. Class C motorhomes are characterized by a distinctive cab-over profile, containing either an upper sleeping area, a storage space, or a TV/entertainment section. In the UK, the cab-over is known as a Luton peak or Luton body. A Class C motorhome is equipped with a kitchen/dining area featuring a refrigerator/freezer, a propane range (sometimes with an oven), a microwave oven, and a table with seating. It also has a lavatory with bath/shower, and has one or more sleeping areas as well as additional seating towards the front. An air conditioner, a water heater, a furnace, and an outside canopy are usually included. Optional equipment available at additional expense typically includes a generator set and roof-mounted solar power panels. A sub-category of Class C motorhomes is the toy hauler, which combines a typical configuration with additional enclosed space aft dedicated to hauling dirt bikes, bicycles, ATVs or the like. Class C motorhomes often feature a towing hitch enabling the pulling of a light weight trailer such as for boats, or of a small car or truck. Class C motorhomes may also be referred to in some places as mini-motorhomes. Touring outer hebrides motorhome  Truck camper  A truck camper A truck camper is a living space unit that is temporarily mounted into the bed of a pickup truck and secured against any tipping or wobbling while the truck is in motion. Great care must be taken in matching the weight and center balance point of the truck camper with the capabilities of the pickup truck itself in order to maintain safe handling of the vehicle while driving. Truck campers are much favored by those who do not wish to own a motorhome or trailer for only part- time use when the need for a truck is otherwise present. Common uses are for backwoods travel, hunting, fishing, and particularly in North America on four wheel drive vehicles for off-roading or via rough roads to campsites. The smallest of truck campers provide a sleeping area with perhaps an ice box and storage cabinetry, while top-of-the-line campers feature a refrigerator/freezer, propane range/oven, microwave oven, air conditioner, furnace, water heater, and lavatory with shower. With the introduction of slideouts, the earlier design notion of increasing interior space by lengthening the entire camper (thus escalating the purchase price) gave way to new designs that offer increased width (albeit only possible in a completely stationary vehicle) while no longer requiring additional length. Typical North American consumer grade pickup trucks used for hauling full size slideout- equipped campers are of the Chevrolet/GMC 2500 through 3500 range, the Ram 2500 through 3500 range, and the Ford F-250 through 350 range, usually with long box bed lengths and sometimes with dual-mounted rear tires for the heaviest camper models.  Popup camper  A popup camper (a.k.a. tent trailer) Also known as a folding trailer, tent camper, tent trailer, or camper trailer, a popup trailer is a light-weight unit with pull-out bunks and tent walls that collapse for towing and for non-use storage. These campers are suitable for towing by most vehicles.  Travel trailer  A unit with rigid sides designed to be towed, usually by a pickup truck, SUV, or minivan, with a bumper or frame hitch. In Britain they are known as caravans. Bumper pull travel trailers like these range from 19' to 34' long. They are typically pulled by a large SUV or light to medium pickup truck (Class 2, 3 or 4). Bumper pull travel trailers have between 1 and 4 axles. A European caravan  Teardrop trailer  A compact, lightweight travel trailer that resembles a large teardrop, sometimes seen being towed by motorcycles. A Teardrop Trailer  Hybrid trailer  A blend between a travel trailer and a folding (tent) trailer. One type has rigid sides and pull-out tent sections (usually beds) while another type's top section of walls and its roof can be lowered over its bottom section to reduce its height for towing. A hybrid travel trailer  Fifth-wheel trailer  A fifth-wheel trailer Designed to be towed by a pickup or medium duty truck equipped with a special in-box hitch called a fifth wheel coupling. Part of the trailer body extends over the truck bed, shortening the total length of the vehicle and trailer combined. Some larger fifth-wheel trailers, usually over 40 feet (12.2 m) in length and 18,000 pounds (8,200 kg) in weight, are pulled by semi-trucks. Fifth-wheel trailers have become increasingly popular since they first became commercially available in the late 1960s. For some pickup truck owners the downside of a fifth-wheel trailer versus a conventional frame-hitch-mount travel trailer is that the former takes up space inside the truck cargo bed.  Park model (vacation/resort cottage)  This is a larger travel trailer ‚Äì 35 to 45 feet long ‚Äì that is not self-contained. It is designed for park camping only; and while it is easily moved from site to site as a normal trailer is, it is not capable of \\"dry camping\\" as it does not have any water storage tanks and must be used with hookups.  Skoolie  A former school bus or shuttle bus that has been converted into a RV. This includes full size buses based on a dedicated school bus chassis, or a \\"short bus\\", based on a cutaway van, heavy duty pickup truck cutaway, or medium duty truck cutaway with a bus body attached. (A cutaway is where a vehicle frame is fitted with only a cab, motor, transmission, and tires. A secondary manufacturer is responsible to fit additional body components.) These are usually highly customized and done by their owners. These can be done simply and inexpensively, or elaborately and expensive. Full size buses will generally fall into the Class A rating, and the short buses fall into the Class C rating. There are varying regulations in different states in the United States that affect the conversion of a school bus. Some states, such as California and Illinois, require that the bus's signaling equipment (stop sign, flashing lights, etc.) be removed and the school bus yellow paint scheme be changed. Other states simply require that the \\"School Bus\\" signage at the top front and rear be removed. Also, what needs to be installed prior to it being retitled from a bus to a RV varies from state to state. Generally a bed, stove or oven, water tanks, toilet facilities, sinks, etc must be mounted to the vehicle. Along with that, skoolies are generally a cheaper option but also a vehicle that has the right necessities for one.

He began to receive widespread attention in the late 2010s for his views on cultural and political issues. Born and raised in Alberta, Peterson obtained bachelor's degrees in political science and psychology from the University of Alberta and a PhD in clinical psychology from McGill University. After teaching and research at Harvard University, he returned to Canada in 1998 to join the faculty of psychology at the University of Toronto. In 1999, he published his first book, Maps of Meaning: The Architecture of Belief, which became the basis for many of his subsequent lectures. The book combined information from psychology, mythology, religion, literature, philosophy, and neuroscience to analyze systems of belief and meaning. In 2016, Peterson released a series of YouTube videos criticizing the Act to amend the Canadian Human Rights Act and the Criminal Code (Bill C-16), passed by the Parliament of Canada to introduce \\"gender identity and expression\\" as a prohibited grounds of discrimination. He argued that the bill would make the use of certain gender pronouns into compelled speech, and related this argument to a general critique of political correctness and identity politics. He subsequently received significant media coverage, attracting both support and criticism. In the wake of the controversy, Peterson's lectures and debates‚Äîpropagated also through podcasts and YouTube‚Äîgradually gathered millions of views. He put his clinical practice and teaching duties on hold by 2018, when he published his second book, 12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos. Promoted with a world tour, it became a bestseller in several countries.  Early life  Peterson was born on 12 June 1962, in Edmonton, Alberta,\\"About .\\" (official page). and grew up in Fairview, a small town in the northwest of the province.Bowles, Nellie. 18 May 2018. \\"Jordan Peterson, Custodian of the Patriarchy .\\" The New York Times. Retrieved 29 August 2018. He was the eldest of three children born to Walter and Beverley Peterson. Beverley was a librarian at the Fairview campus of Grande Prairie Regional College, and Walter was a school teacher. His middle name is Bernt (, ), after his Norwegian great-grandfather. When Peterson was 13, he was introduced to the writings of George Orwell, Aldous Huxley, Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, and Ayn Rand by his school librarian Sandy Notley‚Äîmother of Rachel Notley, leader of the Alberta New Democratic Party and 17th premier of Alberta. He worked for the New Democratic Party (NDP) throughout his teenage years, but grew disenchanted with the party, eventually leaving them at age 18. He saw his experience of disillusionment resonating with Orwell's diagnosis, in The Road to Wigan Pier, of \\"the intellectual, tweed-wearing middle-class socialist\\" who \\"didn't like the poor; they just hated the rich.\\"  Education  After graduating from Fairview High School in 1979, Peterson entered the Grande Prairie Regional College to study political science and English literature. He later transferred to the University of Alberta, where he completed his B.A. in political science in 1982. Afterwards, he took a year off to visit Europe, where he began studying the psychological origins of the Cold War; 20th-century European totalitarianism; and the works of Carl Jung, Friedrich Nietzsche, Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, and Fyodor Dostoevsky. He then returned to the University of Alberta and received a B.A. in psychology in 1984. In 1985, he moved to Montreal to attend McGill University. He earned his Ph.D. in clinical psychology under the supervision of Robert O. Pihl in 1991, and remained as a post-doctoral fellow at McGill's Douglas Hospital until June 1993, working with Pihl and Maurice Dongier.  Career  Peterson at the University of Toronto in March 2017 From July 1993 to June 1998, Peterson lived in Arlington, Massachusetts, while teaching and conducting research at Harvard University as an assistant professor in the psychology department. During his time at Harvard, he studied aggression arising from drug and alcohol abuse and supervised a number of unconventional thesis proposals. Two former PhD students, Shelley Carson, a psychologist and teacher from Harvard, and author Gregg Hurwitz, recalled that Peterson's lectures were already highly admired by the students. He returned to Canada in July 1998 and eventually became a full professor at the University of Toronto. Peterson's areas of study and research are in the fields of psychopharmacology, abnormal, neuro, clinical, personality, social, industrial and organizational, religious, ideological, political, and creativity psychology. Peterson has authored or co-authored more than a hundred academic papers and has been cited almost 8,000 times as of mid-2017.See: . For most of his career, Peterson maintained a clinical practice, seeing about 20 people a week. He has been active on social media, and in September 2016 he released a series of videos in which he criticized Bill C-16. As a result of new projects, he decided to put the clinical practice on hold in 2017 and temporarily stopped teaching as of 2018. Regarding the topic of religion and God, Bret Weinstein moderated a debate between Peterson and Sam Harris at the Orpheum Theatre in Vancouver in June 2018. In July, the two debated the subject again, this time moderated by Douglas Murray, at the 3Arena in Dublin and The O2 Arena in London. In April 2019, Peterson debated Slavoj ≈Ωi≈æek at the Sony Centre in Toronto over happiness under capitalism versus Marxism.  Works  = Books =  Maps of Meaning: The Architecture of Belief (1999)  In 1999, Routledge published Maps of Meaning: The Architecture of Belief, in which Peterson describes a comprehensive theory about how people construct meaning, form beliefs, and make narratives. The book, which took Peterson 13 years to complete, draws concepts from various fields including mythology, religion, literature, philosophy, and psychology, in accordance to the modern scientific understanding of how the brain functions.JR. August 2015. \\"Summary and Guide to Maps of Meaning: The Architecture of Belief by Jordan Peterson .\\" Scribd. Retrieved 14 June 2020. pp. 2‚Äì3. According to Peterson, his main goal was to examine why individuals and groups alike participate in social conflict, exploring the reasoning and motivation individuals take to support their belief systems (i.e. ideological identification) that eventually result in killing and pathological atrocities such as the Gulag, the Auschwitz concentration camp, and the Rwandan genocide. Placing great importance to Jungian archetypes in the book, Peterson says that an \\"analysis of the world's religious ideas might allow us to describe our essential morality and eventually develop a universal system of morality.\\" In 2004, a 13-part TV miniseries based on Peterson's book aired on TVOntario.  12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos (2018)  In January 2018, Penguin Random House published Peterson's second book, 12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos, in which abstract ethical principles about life are provided in a more accessible style than his previous Maps of Meaning. The book topped best-selling lists in Australia, Canada, France, Germany, the US, and the United Kingdom. As of January 2019, Peterson is working on a sequel to 12 Rules for Life. To promote the book, Peterson went on a world tour. As part of the tour, Peterson was interviewed in the UK by Cathy Newman on Channel 4 News‚Äîa discussion which generated considerable attention. = YouTube channel and podcasts = In 2013, Peterson began recording his lectures for his two classes (\\"Personality and Its Transformations\\" and \\"Maps of Meaning: The Architecture of Belief\\")Psychology Students' Association.

His YouTube channel has gathered more than 1.8 million subscribers and his videos have received more than 65 million views as of August 2018. Peterson speaking with Charlie Kirk at the Turning Point USA's 2018 Young Women's Leadership Summit In January 2017, using funds received on Patreon after he became embroiled in the Bill C-16 controversy in September 2016, Peterson hired a production team to film his psychology lectures at the University of Toronto. His funding through the crowdfunding website has increased significantly, from $1,000 per month in August 2016 to $14,000 by January 2017; more than $50,000 by July 2017; and over $80,000 by May 2018. In December 2018, Peterson decided to delete his Patreon account after the platform's banning of political personalities who Patreon said violated their rules on hate speech. Following this, Peterson and Dave Rubin announced the creation of a new, free speech-oriented social networking and crowdfunding platform. This alternative had a limited release under the name Thinkspot later in 2019, and remained in beta testing as of December 2019. Peterson has appeared on many podcasts, conversational series, as well other online shows. In December 2016, Peterson started The Jordan B. Peterson Podcast. In March 2019, the podcast joined the Westwood One network with Peterson's daughter as a co-host on some episodes. Peterson defended engineer James Damore after he was fired from Google for writing Google's Ideological Echo Chamber. = Biblical lectures = In May 2017, Peterson began The Psychological Significance of the Biblical Stories, a series of live theatre lectures, also published as podcasts, in which he analyzes archetypal narratives in Book of Genesis as patterns of behavior ostensibly vital for personal, social and cultural stability. In October 2020, Peterson announced plans for a lecture series on the Book of Exodus and the Book of Proverbs. In March 2019, Peterson had his invitation of a visiting fellowship at Cambridge University rescinded. He had previously said the fellowship would give him \\"the opportunity to talk to religious experts of all types for a couple of months,\\" and that the new lectures would have been on Book of Exodus. A spokesperson for the University said there was \\"no place\\" for anyone who could not uphold the \\"inclusive environment\\" of the university. After a week, Vice- Chancellor Stephen Toope explained that it was due to a photograph with a man wearing an Islamophobic shirt. The Cambridge University Students' Union released a statement of relief, considering the invitation \\"a political act to‚Ä¶legitimise figures such as Peterson\\" and that his work and views are not \\"representative of the student body.\\" Peterson called the decision a \\"deeply unfortunate...error of judgement\\" and expressed regret that the Divinity Faculty had submitted to an \\"ill-informed, ignorant and ideologically-addled mob.\\" = Self-Authoring Suite = In 2005, Peterson and his colleagues set up a for-profit company to provide and produce a writing therapy program with a series of online writing exercises. Titled the \\"Self-Authoring Suite\\", it includes the Past Authoring Program (a guided autobiography); two Present Authoring Programs, which allow the participant to analyze their personality faults and virtues in terms of the Big Five personality model; and the Future Authoring Program, which guides participants through the process of planning their desired futures. The latter program was used with McGill University undergraduates on academic probation to improve their grades, as well as since 2011 at Rotterdam School of Management, Erasmus University. The programs were developed partially from research by James W. Pennebaker at the University of Texas at Austin and Gary Latham at the Rotman School of Management of the University of Toronto. Peterson's co-authored 2015 study showed significant reduction in ethnic and gender-group differences in performance, especially among ethnic minority male students. According to Peterson, more than 10,000 students have used the program as of January 2017, with drop-out rates decreasing by 25% and GPAs rising by 20%.  Political views  Jordan Peterson speaking in front of St. Stephen's Basilica, Budapest, Hungary, in May 2019. Peterson has characterized himself politically as a \\"classic British liberal,\\" and as a \\"traditionalist.\\" However, he has stated that he is commonly mistaken to be right-wing. Yoram Hazony wrote in The Wall Street Journal that \\"[t]he startling success of his elevated arguments for the importance of order has made him the most significant conservative thinker to appear in the English-speaking world in a generation.\\" The New York Times has described Peterson as \\"conservative-leaning,\\" while The Washington Post has described him as \\"conservative.\\" Nathan Robinson of Current Affairs opines that Peterson has been seen \\"as everything from a fascist apologist to an Enlightenment liberal, because his vacuous words are a kind of Rorschach test onto which countless interpretations can be projected.\\" = Academia and political correctness = Peterson's critiques of political correctness range over issues such as postmodernism, postmodern feminism, white privilege, cultural appropriation, and environmentalism. His social media presence has magnified the impact of these views; Simona Chiose of The Globe and Mail noted that \\"few University of Toronto professors in the humanities and social sciences have enjoyed the global name recognition Prof. Peterson has won.\\" Writing in the National Post, Chris Selley said that Peterson's opponents had \\"underestimated the fury being inspired by modern preoccupations like white privilege and cultural appropriation, and by the marginalization, shouting down or outright cancellation of other viewpoints in polite society's institutions,\\" while Tim Lott stated, in The Spectator, that Peterson became \\"an outspoken critic of mainstream academia.\\" According to his study‚Äîconducted with one of his students, Christine Brophy‚Äîof the relationship between political belief and personality, political correctness exists in two types: \\"PC-egalitarianism\\" and \\"PC-authoritarianism,\\" which is a manifestation of \\"offense sensitivity.\\" Jason McBride claims that Peterson places classical liberals in the first type, and so-called social justice warriors, who he says \\"weaponize compassion,\\" in the latter. The study also found an overlap between PC-authoritarians and right-wing authoritarians. Peterson claims that universities are largely responsible for a wave of political correctness that has appeared in North America and Europe, saying that he had watched the rise of political correctness on campuses since the early 1990s. In his view, the humanities have become corrupt and less reliant on science: > 'The humanities in the universities have become almost incomprehensibly > shallow and corrupt in multiple ways,' he says. 'They don't rely on science > because they are not scientifically educated. This is true particularly in > sociology, where they mask their complete ignorance of science by claiming > that science is just another mode of knowing and that it's only privileged > within the structure of the oppressive Eurocentric patriarchy. It‚Äôs > appalling. We're not having an intelligent conversation, we are having an > ideological conversation. 'Students, instead of being ennobled or inculcated > into the proper culture, the last vestiges of structure are stripped from > them by post-modernism and neo-Marxism, which defines everything in terms of > relativism and power.'  Postmodernism and identity politics  Peterson says that \\"disciplines like women's studies should be defunded,\\" advising freshman students to avoid subjects like sociology, anthropology, English literature, ethnic studies, and racial studies, as well as other fields of study that he believes are corrupted by the neo-Marxist ideology. He believes these fields to propagate cult-like behaviour and safe-spaces, under the pretense of academic inquiry. Peterson had proposed a website using artificial intelligence to identify ideologization in specific courses, but postponed the project in November 2017 as \\"it might add excessively to current polarization.\\" In regard to identity politics, while \\"[t]he left plays them on behalf of the oppressed, let's say, and the right tends to play them on behalf of nationalism and ethnic pride,\\" he considers them \\"equally dangerous\\" and that what should be emphasized, instead, is individual focus and personal responsibility. He has also been prominent in the debate about cultural appropriation, stating that the concept promotes self-censorship in society and journalism. Peterson's perspectives on the influence of postmodernism on North American humanities departments have been compared to Cultural Marxist conspiracy theories. Due to his opposition against identity politics, several writers have associated Peterson with the \\"Intellectual Dark Web,\\" including Bari Weiss, who was among the first to bring this characterization of him into recognition.Farrell, Henry. 2018. \\"The 'Intellectual Dark Web,' explained: What Jordan Peterson and Ben Shapiro have in common with the alt-right .\\" Vox. Retrieved 27 November 2018: \\"The thinkers profiled included the neuroscientist and prominent atheist writer Sam Harris, the podcaster Dave Rubin, and University of Toronto psychologist and Chaos Dragon maven Jordan Peterson.\\"Murray, Douglas. 2018. \\"Spectator Life: Inside the intellectual dark web .\\" The Spectator.

Retrieved 27 November 2018 = Bill C-16 = On 27 September 2016, Peterson released the first installment of a three-part lecture video series, entitled \\"Professor against political correctness: Part I: Fear and the Law.\\" In the video, he stated that he would not use the preferred gender pronouns of students and faculty, saying it fell under compelled speech, and announced his objection to the Canadian government's Bill C-16, which proposed to add \\"gender identity or expression\\" as a prohibited ground of discrimination under the Canadian Human Rights Act, and to similarly expand the definitions of promoting genocide and publicly inciting hatred in the hate speech laws in Canada. Peterson speaking at a Free Speech Rally in October 2016 Peterson stated that his objection to the bill was based on potential free-speech implications if the Criminal Code were amended, claiming he could then be prosecuted under provincial human-rights laws if he refuses to call a transgender student or faculty member by the individual's preferred pronoun. Furthermore, he argued that the new amendments, paired with section 46.3 of the Ontario Human Rights Code, would make it possible for employers and organizations to be subject to punishment under the code if any employee or associate says anything that can be construed \\"directly or indirectly\\" as offensive, \\"whether intentionally or unintentionally.\\" According to law professor Brenda Cossman and others, this interpretation of C-16 is mistaken, and the law does not criminalize misuse of pronouns. The series of videos drew criticism from transgender activists, faculty, and labour unions; critics accused Peterson of \\"helping to foster a climate for hate to thrive\\" and of \\"fundamentally mischaracterising\\" the law. Protests erupted on campus, some including violence, and the controversy attracted international media attention. When asked in September 2016 if he would comply with the request of a student to use a preferred pronoun, Peterson said \\"it would depend on how they asked me.‚Ä¶ If I could detect that there was a chip on their shoulder, or that they were [asking me] with political motives, then I would probably say no.‚Ä¶ If I could have a conversation like the one we're having now, I could probably meet them on an equal level.\\" Two months later, the National Post published an op-ed by Peterson in which he elaborated on his opposition to the bill, saying that gender-neutral singular pronouns were \\"at the vanguard of a post-modern, radical leftist ideology that I detest, and which is, in my professional opinion, frighteningly similar to the Marxist doctrines that killed at least 100 million people in the 20th century.\\" In response to the controversy, academic administrators at the University of Toronto sent Peterson two letters of warning, one noting that free speech had to be made in accordance with human rights legislation, and the other adding that his refusal to use the preferred personal pronouns of students and faculty upon request could constitute discrimination. Peterson speculated that these warning letters were leading up to formal disciplinary action against him, but in December the university assured him he would retain his professorship, and in January 2017 he returned to teach his psychology class at the University of Toronto. In February 2017, Maxime Bernier, candidate for leader of the Conservative Party of Canada, stated that he had shifted his position on Bill C-16, from support to opposition, after meeting with Peterson and discussing it. Peterson's analysis of the bill was also frequently cited by senators who were opposed to its passage. In April 2017, Peterson was denied a Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council (SSHRC) grant for the first time in his career, which he interpreted as retaliation for his statements regarding Bill C-16. However, a media-relations adviser for SSHRC said, assess only the information contained in the application.\\" In response, Rebel News launched an Indiegogo crowdfunding campaign on Peterson's behalf, raising C$195,000 by its end on 6 May, equivalent to over two years of research funding. In May 2017, as one of 24 witnesses who were invited to speak about the bill, Peterson spoke against Bill C-16 at a Canadian Senate Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs hearing. In November 2017, Lindsay Shepherd, the teaching assistant of a Wilfrid Laurier University first-year communications course, was censured by her professors for showing, during a classroom discussion about pronouns, a segment of The Agenda in which Peterson debates Bill C-16 with another professor. The reasons given for the censure included the clip creating a \\"toxic climate,\\" being compared to a \\"speech by Hitler,\\" and being itself in violation of Bill C-16. The censure was later withdrawn and both the professors and the university formally apologized. The events were cited by Peterson, as well as several newspaper editorial boards and national newspaper columnists, as illustrative of the suppression of free speech on university campuses. In June 2018, Peterson filed a $1.5-million lawsuit against Wilfrid Laurier University, arguing that three staff members of the university had maliciously defamed him by making negative comments about him behind closed doors. Wilfrid Laurier had asked the court to dismiss the lawsuit, saying it was ironic for a purported advocate of free speech to attempt to curtail free speech. = Gender relations and masculinity = Peterson has argued that there is an ongoing \\"crisis of masculinity\\" and \\"backlash against masculinity\\" in which the \\"masculine spirit is under assault.\\" He has argued that the left characterises the existing societal hierarchy as an \\"oppressive patriarchy\\" but \\"don‚Äôt want to admit that the current hierarchy might be predicated on competence.\\" He has said men without partners are likely to become violent, and has noted that male violence is reduced in societies in which monogamy is a social norm. He has attributed the rise of Donald Trump and far-right European politicians to what he says is a negative reaction to a push to \\"feminize\\" men, saying \\"If men are pushed too hard to feminize they will become more and more interested in harsh, fascist political ideology.\\" He attracted considerable attention over a 2018 Channel 4 interview in which he clashed with interviewer Cathy Newman on the topic of the gender pay gap. He disputed the contention that the disparity was solely due to sexual discrimination.  Personal life  Peterson married Tammy Roberts in 1989; the couple have one daughter and one son. In a 2017 interview, Peterson was asked if he was a Christian; he responded, \\"I suppose the most straight- forward answer to that is yes.\\" When asked if he believes in God, Peterson responded: \\"I think the proper response to that is No, but I'm afraid He might exist.\\" Writing for The Spectator, Tim Lott said Peterson draws inspiration from Jung's philosophy of religion and holds views similar to the Christian existentialism of S√∏ren Kierkegaard and Paul Tillich. Lott also said that Peterson has respect for Taoism, as it views nature as a struggle between order and chaos and posits life would be meaningless without this duality. Starting around 2000, Peterson began collecting Soviet-era paintings. The paintings are displayed in his house as a reminder of the relationship between totalitarian propaganda and art, and as examples of how idealistic visions can become totalitarian oppression and horror. In 2016, Peterson became an honorary member of the extended family of Charles Joseph, a Kwakwaka'wakw artist, and was given the name Alestalagie ('Great Seeker'). = Health problems = In 2016, Peterson had a severe autoimmune reaction to food and was prescribed clonazepam. In late 2016, he went on a strict diet consisting only of meat and some vegetables, in an attempt to control his severe depression and the effects of an autoimmune disorder including psoriasis and uveitis. In mid-2018, he stopped eating vegetables, and continued eating only beef (carnivore diet). In April 2019, his prescribed dosage of clonazepam was increased to deal with the anxiety he was experiencing as a result of his wife's cancer diagnosis. Starting several months later, he made various attempts to lessen his intake, or stop taking the drug altogether, but experienced \\"horrific\\" benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome, including akathisia,Why was Jordan Peterson placed in a medically induced coma? What we know about benzodiazepines and treatment Published February 11, 2020 by the National Post described by his daughter as \\"incredible, endless, irresistible restlessness, bordering on panic.\\" According to his daughter, Peterson and his family were unable to find doctors in North America who were willing to accommodate their treatment desires, so in January 2020, Peterson, his daughter and her husband flew to Moscow, Russia for treatment. Doctors there diagnosed Peterson with pneumonia in both lungs upon arrival, and he was put into a medically induced coma for eight days. Peterson spent four weeks in the intensive care unit, during which time he allegedly exhibited a temporary loss of motor skills. Several months after his treatment in Russia, Peterson and his family moved to Belgrade, Serbia for further treatment. In June 2020, Peterson made his first public appearance in over a year, when he appeared on his daughter's podcast, recorded in Belgrade. He said that he was \\"back to my regular self\\", other than feeling fatigue, and was cautiously optimistic about his prospects. He also said that he wanted to warn people about the dangers of long-term use of benzodiazepines (the class of drugs that includes clonazepam). In August 2020, his daughter announced that her father had contracted COVID-19 during his hospital stay in Serbia. Two months later, Peterson posted a YouTube video to inform that he had returned home and aims to resume work in the near future.

Built in 1742, it is the oldest surviving house in Middlefield. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1988. Description and history The William Ward Jr. House stands in a rural residential area of southwestern Middlefield, on the west side of Powder Hill Road south of Long Hill Road near a local park located in a former brownstone quarry featuring dinosaur tracks. It is a -story wood-frame structure, three bays wide, with a large central chimney, gabled roof, and clapboarded exterior. It has a typical New England saltbox appearance with an integral lean-to extending to the rear, and a single-story ell to the left. The construction of the house includes many First Period features, including gunstock posts, and its second story overhangs the first slightly, a rare surviving feature in Connecticut. Its foundation and fireplace hearthstones are brownstone, the latter exhibiting fossil remains, suggesting that the stone was probably taken from the nearby quarry site. The interior retains a number of original features, including doors and door hardware. The property was first granted to William Ward in the 17th century, when the area was part of Middletown. His great-grandson, also named William, built this house in 1742. It is the oldest surviving house in Middlefield, and is architecturally distinctive for the use of cantilevered girts to support the rear leanto roof. The house remained in the hands of the Wards and associated families until 1935.

Gad Cliff is a south-facing cliff face, immediately to the east of Worbarrow Tout and Pondfield Cove, on the south coast of the Isle of Purbeck in Dorset, England. Behind it is Gold Down, part of the Lulworth Ranges.  Location  Worbarrow Tout, Pondfield Cove and Gad Cliff. Worbarrow Tout and Gad Cliff - view from the sea off Worbarrow Bay. Gad Cliff is located about south of the ghost village of Tyneham and about six kilometres south of Wareham. Gad Cliff is about west of Kimmeridge Bay and about due west of Swanage. Gad Cliff is only accessible when the Lulworth Ranges are open to the public. It can be reached either by an up hill walk from the car park alongside the ghost village of Tyneham, or alternatively via coastal walk from Kimmeridge Bay along the South West Coast Path. The highest point of Gad Cliff is about above sea-level. Gold Down is the most western part of this cliff face. Wagon Rock is a large boulder that has fallen from the upper parts of Gad Cliff onto the shoreline below.  Geology  Geology of the coast line from Worbarrow Bay to Gad Cliff. The geology of the Isle of Purbeck is very complex and this is shown very clearly along this stretch of coast. The extreme angular layers of rock visibly demonstrate the complex sedimentary folding that affected this area. The foldings, known as the Purbeck Monocline, took place some 30 million years ago and were caused by the tectonic pressures as the African and European continents collided. During this period, the sediments were twisted horizontally, this is why the younger Cretaceous formations are found at the rear of Worbarrow Bay. At Gad Cliff the sediments dip inland at an angle of 25 to 35 degrees. At the top of the cliffs it is clearly visible that the rocks have been folded into a huge S shaped kink as the result of earth movements. The uppermost of Gad Cliff is formed by the Purbeck Beds, 147 million, and of Portland limestones, 150 million years old. These lie over a layer of Portland Sands and the underlying Kimmeridge Clay, which is about 155 million years old. The upper layer of the Kimmeridge Clay belongs the Kimmeridgian Stage sensu anglico. Due to the fact that harder Limestones and Sandstones are underlain by an unstable Clay, the cliff face is prone to landslides. At the very western end of Gad Cliff is Worbarrow Tout, which forms the southern bastion enclosing Worbarrow Bay, which is cut into the comparatively soft clays and sands of the Wealden Beds.

The theorem is also known as straightening out of a vector field. The Frobenius theorem in differential geometry can be considered as a higher- dimensional generalization of this theorem.  Proof  It is clear that we only have to find such coordinates at 0 in \\\\mathbb{R}^n. First we write X = \\\\sum_j f_j(x) {\\\\partial \\\\over \\\\partial x_j} where x is some coordinate system at 0. Let f = (f_1, \\\\dots, f_n). By linear change of coordinates, we can assume f(0) = (1, 0, \\\\dots, 0). Let \\\\Phi(t, p) be the solution of the initial value problem \\\\dot x = f(x), x(0) = p and let :\\\\psi(x_1, \\\\dots, x_n) = \\\\Phi(x_1, (0, x_2, \\\\dots, x_n)). \\\\Phi (and thus \\\\psi) is smooth by smooth dependence on initial conditions in ordinary differential equations.

The action of the then Governor of Madras M. E. Grant Duff provoked outrage all over the Presidency. Indian nationalists frequently cited the case as an example of the alleged unjust rule of the British Raj.  Origin  In May 1881, a group of ryots in the then Chingleput district accused an Indian tahsildar of extortion and filed a case against him in a local court. The tahsildar tried to threaten the ryots with dire consequences and allegedly got the District Collector of Chingleput to prosecute them for perjury. However, the tahsildar was still convicted for tampering with official records and sentenced to rigorous imprisonment. The tahsildar filed a fresh appeal in the Madras High Court resulting in the reduction of the sentence from two to one year. Dissatisfied, the tahsildar appealed once again against the verdict. Though the Madras High Court refused to entertain a second appeal, the Governor of Madras intervened and issued an order on 31 May 1883 acquitting the tahsildar due to lack of evidence The District Collector of Chingleput who had allegedly shielded the corrupt tahsildar later acted as the Revenue Secretary of the Government of Madras.  Reaction  The Governor was heavily condemned and criticized by the Indian press for acquitting the corrupt tahsildar. The Hindu, which had supported the ryots throughout the trial and even collected money to fight the case on their behalf, charged him with allowing the affair \\"to cast dirt on the fair face of British Justice\\". The incident was brought before the House of Commons and Sir John Gorst, the Under-Secretary of State for India was questioned by James Tuite, the British Member of Parliament for Westmeath North in February 1887.

The hamlet is located approximately three-and-a-half miles east of Abbeytown, nine-and-a-quarter miles south-east of Silloth-on-Solway, three-and-a-quarter miles north-west of Wigton, and fourteen miles south-west of Carlisle. Etymology The first part of the name is Brittonic drum-, which in etymological terms means \\"a ridge\\" (Welsh drum). The second element is *dra…£√Øn, meaning \\"thorns\\" (Welsh draen). Alternatively, the name may be derived from Gaelic equivalents of the aforementioned words. The loss of the final syllable is attributed to Old Norse speakers substituting the first element, which Middle English speakers ‚Äòtranslated‚Äô as dr√¶ƒ°, meaning \\"a drag, a steep slope\\", omitting *‚Äì√Øn as this was taken to be the Scandinavian suffixed definite article. The Hamlet Dundraw is a hamlet north of the B5302, which is its nearest main road. The River Waver runs to the east of the hamlet.

The civil parish of Dundraw includes the settlements of Dunrdaw, Kelsick, Moor Row, Waverbridge, and Wheyrigg. Population Since 1980, the rate of population change has slowed over England and Wales from about 14% annual growth to around 6% annual growth. The rate within Dundraw is much slower than this, but has also fluctuated more than the rest of the country (due to the small population). The population density over England and Wales had gradually increased between the years 1880 and 1960. The population density of Dundraw is much less than the average population density of England and Wales. Dundraw's population density ranges between 0.7% and ‚àí1.2%. Both these population statistics reflect population growth across England and Wales. Comparing this to Dundraw, it can be seen that the smaller population of the village has fluctuated a lot more than the rest of the country. In the district of Allerdale there is a total estimated population of 94,000 (as of mid-2010). According to the 1991 Census, the population of Dundraw was 180 residents, by the 2001 Census this population figure had dropped to 160. That is an 11.1% decrease in population change. Compared to other parishes in Cumbria, Dundraw has a relatively high percentage population change rate compared to actual population change, due to the smaller population. The 2001 census indicated that there were 59 households in Dundraw and has a total headcount of 167 (79 males and 88 females). Attractions There are many places of interest around Dundraw.

MacDonagh spent most of his academic career at universities in Cambridge, Adelaide, Cork and Canberra. Early life MacDonagh was born in Carlow, Ireland to Michael MacDonagh and Loretto Oliver, both of whom were bank officials. The family settled in Roscommon, where Oliver was initially educated by the Christian Brothers and for his secondary schooling was sent to board at Clongowes Wood College. At University College Dublin he studied History and Law, but socialised more with the 'literary set', graduating in 1944 with a Bachelor of Arts degree. He later received an MA from the National University of Ireland and a PhD from Cambridge University. Career MacDonagh was called to the Irish Bar in 1945. From 1952 until 1964 he was a lecturer and Fellow of St Catharine's College, Cambridge where he was a visiting fellow in 1986 and Honorary Fellow in 1987. Between 1963 and 1964 he was a visiting fellow at the Australian National University, where he was closely associated with Professor Keith Hancock. In 1964 he was appointed Professor of History at Flinders University on its establishment, which position he held until 1968. He returned to Ireland as Professor of Modern History at University College, Cork in 1968, remaining until 1973. In 1970 he was a Visiting Professor at Yale University. MacDonagh resigned from Cork in 1973 and returned to Australia as W.K. Hancock Professor in the Research School of Social Sciences at the Australian National University. He remained there until he retired in 1990. In 1952 he married Carmel Hamilton with whom he had three sons and four daughters. Works MacDonagh's first book The Passenger Acts: A Pattern of Government Growth (1961) was a critique of the inexorable expansion of government bureaucracy in the nineteenth century. It inspired many similar studies in Europe and the United States. In The Inspector General: Sir Jeremiah Fitzpatrick and Social Reform 1783‚Äì1802 (1981), he explored public administration in Ireland and Britain at the turn of the century through the career of his subject. His biographies of Daniel O'Connell, The Hereditary Bondsman (1988) and The Emancipist (1989) (combined in the single volume O'Connell: The life of Daniel O'Connell 1775 - 1847 (1990) have been described as a landmark of the genre. Throughout his career, MacDonagh had over a hundred papers published and thirteen books, including in the field of English and Irish literature. His proposition of the novel as historical evidence, put forward in 1970 in an examination of Maria Edgeworth's Castle Rackrent, was further developed in his 1993 work Jane Austen: Real and Imagined Worlds. There he explored Austen's contemporary society through the imagined lives of her own novels characters. MacDonagh also wrote extensively on the history of Irish immigration to Australia, and proposed the multi-volume bicentennial publication The Australians with Ken Inglis while chairman of the management committee of the Australian Bicentennial History Project. He also contributed numerous essays to the ten-volume collaborative project A New History of Ireland, first proposed by Professor T.W Moody in 1962.

These Boards were to report to the Board of Trade and have equal representation from trades unions and employers alongside independent experts. Origins of the Act During the Second World War the Board of Trade made plans for post-war industry boards that would report to an Industrial Commission, each with significant powers. The boards would be \\"responsible for a range of closely inter-related projects ... all concerned with various aspects of industrial efficiency in the widest sense ‚Äì re-equipment, re-organisation, development of new ideas ...\\" and granted powers of compulsory purchase as a last resort.CAB 87/10, R(45)8, 5 February 1945; quoted in The Lost Victory, Corelli Barnett. Macmillan, 1995 In the event, the Act made the relations of the industrial concerns to the boards largely voluntary, excepting powers to oblige them to register with the Boards and pay levies to pay for the boards‚Äô activities. Historian Corelli Barnett quotes Harold Wilson, then President of the Board of Trade, as saying: \\"[they] largely depended for the success of their efforts on securing the agreement and co-operation of the individual undertakings in an industry\\".CAB 134/647 PC(50)72, 5 July 1950 Development Councils under the Industrial Organisation and Development Act 1947; quoted in The Lost Victory, Corelli Barnett. Macmillan, 1995 Barnett concludes that: > Given that the British industrial system was deeply, doggedly resistant to > reform, and no parts more so than those most hidebound and therefore in need > of reform, such agreement and co-operation proved hard to find.The Lost > Victory, Corelli Barnett. Macmillan, 1995, p206 Initial controversy Slow progress in setting up the Development Councils caused frustration among trades unions, and particularly the Trades Union Congress, who warned in that the establishment of development councils could not be delayed much longer \\"without harming the immediate future and long-term prospects of industry\\"Consultation in industry, TUC impatience at delays, The Times, 14 October 1947, page 4 The TUC, in the face of the need to increase domestic exports and production, believed that: > War-time experience showed that it was well worth while to appoint a special > committee‚Äîa joint production committee‚Äîto concentrate on production > problems. The form which regular consultation should take must vary from > industry to industry; what is wanted is the initiative to agree upon the > machinery and the will to make it work Employers, however, were suspicious of the proposed new arrangements: > Employers‚Äô objections to development councils are attributed partly to a > dislike of outsiders‚Äîor even union officials‚Äîhaving a say in the management > of their industry, but perhaps more to anxiety lest the development council > should prove, in spite of all assurances, to be a half-way house to > nationalizationDevelopment Councils: little achieved, The Times, 19 July > 1948, page 6 Early Industrial Development Boards and associations created under the Act Only four boards were created in first wave. These included bodies for the cotton industry, furniture and jewellery and silverware.Development Councils, HC Deb 26 July 1949 vol 467 c109W The Wool Textile Research Council was established in 1950 Wool Industry (Research levy) HC Deb 24 July 1952 vol 504 cc901-20 which funded the Wool Industries Research Association. An order was made to create the Lace Research Association in 1948Lace Industry (Levy) Order) HL Deb 16 December 1948 vol 159 cc1141-4 and help for export promotion a little later with both activities funded by levies. However, suggestions for other development boards proved controversial, particularly among employers, while trades unions were more enthusiastic, pushing for a development board to be set up for the pottery industry, for example. Despite pressure from Labour backbenchers and the Trades Union Congress (TUC), plans for a Hosiery Development Board came to nothing. Wilson explained: \\"The employers in this industry are opposed to the establishment of a statutory Development Council. My aim has been to proceed in this matter as far as possible by agreement and I have not given up hope of doing so.\\" But a Hosiery Board was not established. Dissatisfaction with slow progress included an adjournment debate in 1948, where Labour backbencher Mr. A. Edward Davies MP stated that: > In respect of furniture, pottery, mining, china clay, hosiery and cotton we > were given an indication that the Government took the view that there might > be set up with some useful results, development councils which would have > some limited statutory power, and we had hoped that by this time greater > progress could have been reported on what had been done in industry along > those lines. The position today is that unfortunately, apart from the cotton > industry, little seems to have been achieved. In fact, we have had great and > responsible organisations like the TUC criticising the Government for the > delay in implementing the Act and bringing in development councils.Pottery > Industry (Development Council) HC Deb 14 September 1948 vol 456 cc33-56 Davies went on to explain that employers seemed to fear nationalisation or interference, and the equal representation from unions on the councils, adding that resisting modernisation was unreasonable. He particularly lamented the lack of progress in the pottery industry which he had been championing. For Davies and the TUC, therefore, development councils were expected to be a key part of industrial planning and modernisation. From a Conservative point of view, the Act was a failure because of mistrust of the intentions of the administration. Aubrey Jones MP said in 1952: > in 1945, the then Labour Government had a double industrial programme; for > certain industries, nationalisation; for others, development councils. In > the light of history I think it will be judged that the Industrial > Organisation Act, 1947, has failed, not because of any defect in the > conception but because people feared that the development council was the > thin end of the wedge of nationalisation.Iron and Steel Bill, HC Deb 27 > November 1952 vol 508 cc643-754 The Act under Conservative administration Under Churchill‚Äôs new Conservative government, elected in 1951, two of the development boards were quickly abolished. These were the Clothing Industry Development Council, abolished in 1952,Clothing Industry Development Council (dissolution) HC Deb 1 December 1952 vol 508 cc123-4W and the Jewellery and Silverware Council in 1953.Jewellery and Silverware Council (Dissolution) HC Deb 11 December 1952 vol 509 cc87-8W Jewellery and Silverware Council (Dissolution) Order Both Boards had run into disagreements between their members about how to proceed. The Cotton Board The Cotton Board, unlike other boards, had received support from its industry. It was used to help reorganise the industry in the late 1950s. Large scale government investment particularly to replace old equipment was facilitated by the Board, but a combination of a credit squeeze, cheaper imports led to a crisis of confidence. The reorganisation was not wholly successful. The Cotton Board was abolished in 1972, after completing a major report into the future of the industry. Many of its recommendations, particularly the use of tariffs to limit imports rather than quotas, had been accepted. New uses of the Act in the 1960s The cutlery industry requested a specific research levy in 1960Cutlery Industry (Research Levy) HC Deb 25 October 1960 vol 627 c260W and were granted it in 1962. Horticulturers requested support along these lines as well, as a replacement for the Horticultural Marketing Council. Levies to support other industry projects, mainly in research, found more support under the Wilson government of the 1960s. An Apple and Pear Development Council was created in 1966.Apple and Pear Development Council (Amendment) Order 1970 In 1967, iron casting research funding was obtained through the ActIron Casting Industry (Scientific Research Levy) Order 1967 HL Deb 19 June 1967 vol 283 cc1171-4 followed by support for hosiery research in 1969.Hosiery and Knitwear Industry (Scientific Research Levy) Order, 1969 HC Deb 27 June 1969 vol 785 cc1891-917 Unlike the first wave of Industrial Boards, the responsibilities of these bodies were generally more limited and industry support clearer. Later uses of the Act =Agricultural research and marketing= Further industry requests for levy schemes to support agriculture came during the Conservative governments of the 1980s and 1990s, for instance from the National Farmers Union for a horticultural development council, Agriculture Bill HC Deb 25 November 1985 vol 87 cc614-98 which was established in 1986.Horticultural Development Council Order 1986 HL Deb 26 June 1986 vol 477 cc470-6 A Potato Industry Development Council (1997),Potato Industry Development Council Order 1997 HL Deb 3 February 1997 vol 577 cc1462-70 Scottish Seed Potato Development Council (1981Scottish Seed Potato Development Council Order 1981 HL Deb 24 November 1981 vol 425 cc707-13-1997Scottish Seed Potato Development Council (Dissolution) Order 1997 HL Deb 8 July 1997 vol 581 cc593-6) and Milk Development Council (1994)Milk Development Council Order 1994 HL Deb 13 December 1994 vol 559 cc1265-9 were all established under the Act. The Horticultural Development Council,Horticultural Development Council Annual Report and Accounts 2007-08 the Milk Development Council,The Milk Development Council annual report and accounts 2007/2008 and British Potato CouncilBritish Potato Council Accounts 2007-8 were funded under the Act until 2008, when they were merged with the Home-Grown Cereals Authority and Meat and Livestock Commission.Section 17, The Agriculture and Horticulture Development Board Order 2008 They operate as separate bodies, levy-funded by their industries, but are administered under the Natural Environment and Rural Communities Act 2006 as a single body: the Agriculture and Horticulture Development Board. =Wool and textiles= Other than agriculture, levies were still being raised on the wool textile industries to promote exports in the first decade of the 21st century. They were paid to the National Wool Textile Export Corporation.Industrial Organisation and Development Act 1947 Account 2004-2005 However, in 2007, a consultation was run to remove this levy and a Statutory Instrument to revoke it was passed in 2008.House of Commons debates, 10 November 2008, 9:49 pm Conclusion Clearly, the Act was not used extensively to reorganise British industry as originally envisaged. The Act proved controversial at first, as it was seen as an attempt to increase government control of industry, union influence and perhaps pave the way for nationalisation. Only four development boards were created under the 1945-51 Labour government. Of the major industries, only cotton saw a powerful Board created from the Act that went on to play a strategic role in helping change its industry. On the other hand, the Act provided a useful mechanism to find funding for marketing and research. Establishments such as Wool Industries Research Institute, or the Shirley Institute for the cotton industry, had an international reputation in their fields, and very talented scientists developed their careers there. However, similar research institutes developed in other industries through a combination of direct funding and voluntary arrangements, such as the British Rubber Producers Research Association or British Rayon Research Association. Later, limited schemes to raise levies under the Act for research or marketing gained the support of specific industries, particularly in the agricultural sector. The use of levies to support this work continues, although no statutory organisation uses the powers of the Act today.

It rises in Cwm Dwyfor at the head of Cwm Pennant, gathers to itself numerous streams which drain the surrounding mountains from Mynydd Graig Goch in the west to Moel Hebog in the east, then flows southwest towards Dolbenmaen and out of the Snowdonia National Park. After a brief diversion west, it turns south, then southwest again, heading for the village of Llanystumdwy. Beyond Llanystumdwy it heads for the coast and Tremadog Bay. Its mouth has been diverted eastwards by almost one mile by the Pen-y-chain shingle spit resulting from longshore drift. Its principal tributaries are the Afon Henwy which enters on its left bank above Dolbenmaen, and the Afon Dwyfach which joins it as a right-bank tributary to the west of Llanystumdwy. The Dwyfach itself rises in an area of flat ground to the west of the A487 road between Bryncir and Llanllyfni and flows in a generally southerly direction. 'Afon Dwyfor' signifies the 'big holy river' in Welsh whilst the 'Afon Dwyfach' is the 'little holy river'.Owen, H.W. & Morgan, R. 2007 Dictionary of the Place-names of Wales, Gomer Press, Ceredigion, Wales The river is bridged by numerous minor roads and paths but also by the A487, B4411 and A497 roads as well as the railway line between Criccieth and Pwllheli.Ordnance Survey 1:25,000 scale Explorer map sheet no 254 Lleyn Peninsula East At Dolbenmaen it is believed the Roman road to Segontium forded the river.

He is a Professor Emeritus of Engineering Science at the California Institute of Technology. His research contribution includes compressible fluid flow, free- streamline theory of cavities, jets and wakes, water waves and free-surface flows, mechanics of fish swimming and bird/insect flight, wind and ocean- current energy, and internal waves in the ocean. Early life Wu came from a Chinese scholar family. His father had a degree in economics and finance, his mother graduated from high school and majored in literature, while his grandfather was a Chinese physician. During the Japanese invasion, the Japanese airplanes flying overhead eventually inspired him to enter aeronautics in the university. Education and career Wu received his BSc in 1946 from National Chiao Tung University in Shanghai (now Shanghai Jiao Tong University), and spent one year teaching upon graduation. In January 1948 he arrived in the U.S. and enrolled at Iowa State University and graduated with an MS in December the same year. After Iowa, Wu went to Caltech, where he shared an office with Julian Cole. Wu was involved in the research group headed by Paco Lagerstrom, where they developed further the asymptotic perturbation method pioneered by Ludwig Prandtl. Wu received his PhD in (1952), subsequently worked as a research fellow at Caltech for three years, and developed interest in water waves and hydrodynamics, due to inspiration from then Qian Xuesen and von Karman. After three years Wu became an assistant professor of applied mechanics (1955) at Caltech. In 1960, under the influence of G. I. Taylor and James Lighthill, Wu started to work on fish locomotion and bird flight (biofluiddynamics). During his time at Caltech he has also contributed to the field of naval architecture and been involved in the International Towing Tank Conferences.

In genetics, floxing refers to the sandwiching of a DNA sequence (which is then said to be floxed) between two lox P sites. The terms are constructed upon the phrase \\"flanking/flanked by LoxP\\". Recombination between LoxP sites is catalysed by Cre recombinase. Floxing a gene allows it to be deleted (knocked out), translocated or inverted in a process called Cre-Lox recombination. The floxing of genes is essential in the development of scientific model systems as it allows researchers to have spatial and temporal alteration of gene expression. Moreover, animals such as mice can be used as models to study human disease. Therefore, Cre-lox system can be used in mice to manipulate gene expression in order to study human diseases and drug development. For example, using the Cre-lox system, researchers can study oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes and their role in development and progression of cancer in mice models.  Uses in research  Floxing a gene allows it to be deleted (knocked out), translocated or inserted (through various mechanisms in Cre-Lox recombination). The floxing of genes is essential in the development of scientific model systems as it allows spatial and temporal alteration of gene expression. In layman's terms, the gene can be knocked-out (inactivated) in a specific tissue in vivo, at any time chosen by the scientist. The scientist can then evaluate the effects of the knocked-out gene and identify the gene‚Äôs normal function. This is different from having the gene absent starting from conception, whereby inactivation or loss of genes that are essential for the development of the organism may interfere with the normal function of cells and prevent the production of viable offspring. = Mechanism of deletion = A model experiment in genetics using the Cre-lox system: the premature stop sequence present in floxed mice is removed only from cells that express Cre recombinase when the mice are bred together. Deletion events are useful for performing gene editing experiments through precisely editing out segments of or even whole genes. Deletion requires floxing of the segment of interest with loxP sites which face the same direction. The Cre recombinase will detect the unidirectional loxP sites and excise the floxed segment of DNA. The successfully edited clones can be selected using a selection marker which can be removed using the same Cre-loxP system. The same mechanism can be used to create conditional alleles by introducing an FRT/Flp site which accomplishes the same mechanism but with a different enzyme. = Mechanism of inversion = Inversion events are useful for maintaining the amount of genetic material. The inverted genes are not often associated with abnormal phenotypes, meaning the inverted genes are generally viable. Cre-loxP recombination that result in insertion requires loxP sites to flox the gene of interest, with the loxP sites oriented towards each other. By undergoing Cre recombination, the region floxed by the loxP sites will become inverted, this process is not permanent and can be reversed. = Mechanism of translocation = Translocation events occur when the loxP sites flox genes on two different DNA molecules in a unidirectional orientation. Cre recombinase is then used to generate a translocation between the two DNA molecules, exchanging the genetic material from one DNA molecule to the other forming a simultaneous translocation of both floxed genes.  Common applications in research  Cardiomyocytes (heart muscle tissue) have been shown to express a type of Cre recombinase that is highly specific to cardiomyocytes and can be used by researchers to perform highly efficient recombinations. This is achieved by using a type of Cre whose expression is driven by the \\\\alpha-myosin heavy chain promoter (\\\\alpha-MyHC). These recombinations are capable of disrupting genes in a manner that is specific to only heart tissue in vivo and allows for the creation of conditional knockouts of the heart mostly for use as controls. For example, using the Cre recombinase with the \\\\alpha-MyHC promoter causes the floxed gene to be inactivated in the heart alone. Further, these knockouts can be inducible. In several mouse studies, tamoxifen is used to induce the Cre recombinase. In this case, Cre recombinase is fused to a portion of the mouse estrogen receptor (ER) which contains a mutation within its ligand binding domain (LBD). The mutation renders the receptor inactive, which leads to incorrect localization through its interactions with chaperone proteins such as heat shock protein 70 and 90 (Hsp70 and Hsp90). Tamoxifen binds to Cre-ER and disrupts its interactions with the chaperones, which allows the Cre-ER fusion protein to enter the nucleus and perform recombination on the floxed gene. Additionally, Cre recombinase can be induced by heat when under the control of specific heat shock elements (HSEs).

It was the third lighthouse to be constructed in Australia, and it is also Australia's oldest continuously used pilot station. This light is now unmanned and automated. History During the course of their circumnavigation of Van Diemen's Land now Tasmania in the Norfolk in 1798, George Bass and Matthew Flinders made landfall at a place they named Port Dalrymple now George Town, to the north-west of Launceston. In doing so, they proved the existence of a strait between Australia and Tasmania. Flinders reported difficulty in locating the entrance to the channel. Colonel William Paterson arrived on 16 February 1804 aboard HMS Buffalo as the newly appointed Lieutenant Governor of Van Diemen's Land with the first settlers. The first navigation marker he installed at Low Head was a simple flagpole in 1804. Later that year, Paterson established a pilot station and signal station in the sheltered bay below Low Head. He also installed a fire beacon at Low Head to mark the hazardous entrance of the Tamar River. When a vessel was sighted after sunset, a fire would be lit and attended all night by convicts to allow the vessel to maintain sight of the port. Several serious shipping accidents occurred near the mouth of the Tamar River early in the history of George Town. The first and most infamous of these occurred on 15 June 1808, when struck a reef between Low Head and Western Head at the entrance to Port Dalrymple. The ship was wrecked on the rocks at the mouth to the Tamar River, which have since that day carried the name Hebe Reef. Responding to this ongoing threat to shipping, the local Committee of Pilotage recommended in 1826 that a lightstation should be built at Low Head. Australia's first lighthouse, Macquarie Lighthouse in Vaucluse, New South Wales was lit in 1793. Australia's second lighthouse, Iron Pot Lighthouse at the entrance to the River Derwent was lit in 1832. Low Head Lighthouse, constructed by convict labour and first lit on 27 December 1833, became Tasmania's second and only the third one to be built in Australia. The presence of Low Head Lighthouse has undoubtedly prevented numerous shipping accidents since its first operation in 1833, but by no means all of them. Since the loss of the Hebe in 1808, nine more vessels have been lost on Hebe Reef. The most recent was , chartered by BHP Shipping. On 10 July 1995, near the end of a voyage from Groote Eylandt with a load of manganese ore, MV Iron Baron ran aground on Hebe Reef. All crew were safely evacuated but the accident resulted in the worst oil spill in Australian history. =Tower= View of Low Head Lighthouse, looking to the west in 2010 The original tower, high, was known as the \\"Georgetown Station\\". Designed by Colonial Architect John Lee Archer, who was responsible for the design of many other Tasmanian lights, it was constructed of local rubble with a coat of stucco to make the structure durable. The crown was built of freestone from Launceston, and the lantern room was built of timber, also from Launceston. By the 1880s, the original stone tower had fallen into a state of disrepair. It was demolished in 1888 and replaced with the present double brick structure with a new lantern room and apparatus, designed by Marine Board architect Robert Huckson. The new tower was painted solid white from top to bottom. On 5 January 1926, a broad bright red band was painted around the midsection of the tower to improve visibility during daylight hours. =Quarters= Low Head Lighthouse was staffed by a superintendent and two convict assistants who were locked in their quarters overnight. The lighthouse keeper's quarters consisted of four rooms attached to the base of the tower. Low Head Lighthouse was the only Tasmanian lighthouse to be built with attached quarters. A new Head Keeper's quarters was built in 1890. This was followed in 1916 by the construction of an Assistant Keeper's quarters immediately to the southwest of the tower. =Light and lens assembly= The original apparatus was supplied in 1833 by W. Hart of Launceston. He supplied six dozen Argand lamps with tin reflectors at three shillings and sixpence each. In 1835, the apparatus was upgraded by installation of a revolving shutter which was rotated by a weight-driven clockwork mechanism. In 1838, the original whale oil Argand lamps and the tin mirrors were replaced by a revolving catadioptric system, manufactured by Wilkins and Company of London. The lens floated and rotated in a mercury bath, which served as a bearing. The cost of these upgrades was ¬£2000. In 1851, the luminous intensity of the lantern was further increased. When the new tower was constructed in 1888, the revolving catadioptric apparatus was retained, and a cast iron and copper housing for the lantern (manufactured by Chance Brothers of Smethwick) was added. In 1898, an auxiliary light was added to the tower. The assembly, manufactured by Chance Brothers, consisted of a two-wick lamp with a red lens that produced a red warning light to illuminate the hazardous Hebe Reef. The assembly is positioned such that the light shines from a window just above the midsection of the tower, about below the main light. In 1916, the lighting and lens assembly was extensively upgraded. A new revolving Fresnel lens (3rd order 375 millimeter f.r. triple flashing catadioptric) was installed. The whale oil lantern was also replaced with a 55 millimetre incandescent gas mantle lantern, and fuelled by vaporized kerosene. The lens and lantern were both manufactured by Chance Brothers; the total cost of these improvements was ¬£1,348 13s ld. On 12 April 1937, Hydroelectric power (generated at the nearby Duck Reach Power Station) was finally supplied to Low Head Lighthouse. The clockwork rotating mechanism was replaced by an electric motor, and the kerosene lantern was replaced by a 110 volt 500 watt electric lamp. The lantern apparatus currently uses a 240 volt lamp. =Foghorn= Tasmania's only foghorn (also manufactured by Chance Brothers) is a Type G diaphone that was installed in April 1929 at Low Head Lighthouse. The foghorn was operated by the lighthouse keepers during foggy conditions for more than forty years. The original device consisted of two Gardner Engine Company kerosene engines driving 2 Reavell air compressors, supplying air to two compressed air receivers (each with a capacity of to an operating pressure of . An air-operated timing mechanism controlled the valves which produced the sound, which could be heard at distances of up to from Low Head. The foghorn was electrified in 1940, along with the rest of the equipment at the lightstation. At that time, one of the kerosene engines was removed and replaced with a 20-horsepower electric motor. One of the largest diaphones ever constructed, the foghorn was decommissioned in 1973 because of technological advances in marine navigational equipment. The device fell into disrepair over the next few decades. Early in 2000, the Low Head Progress & Heritage Association in conjunction with the Tasmania Parks and Wildlife Service (the present owners of the equipment) began a project to restore the foghorn. The device became operational again in April 2001. Today, the foghorn at Low Head Lighthouse is one of only two functioning Type G diaphones in the world, and it is sounded every Sunday at noon. =Communication= Beginning in 1804, Flag signals (semaphore flags) were employed to communicate shipping news from vessels in the Bass Strait to Low Head Lighthouse. From there, semaphore lines would relay information to George Town and nearby Mount George, and thence to Mount Direction and Launceston. The semaphore system was finally replaced in 1859 by an electric telegraph system, when Tasmania was linked across Bass Strait to mainland Australia by a submarine communications cable which came ashore at East Beach in Low Head. The first undersea telephone cable linking Tasmania to mainland Australia was laid between Low Head and Flinders, Victoria in 1936. =Lighthouse keepers= From 1865 to 1912, Low Head Lighthouse was under the control of Alfred C. Rockwell and his son Alfred C. Rockwell Junior. The lightstation was also responsible for the smaller Tamar River leading lights, which were separately staffed for some years.

Fort Claiborne is located in the upper right. Claiborne is a ghost town on a bluff above the Alabama River in Monroe County, Alabama. History Situated near the Federal Road, Claiborne began during the Mississippi Territory period with a ferry over the river. During the Creek War a large stockade fort, named Fort Claiborne, was established at the site by General Ferdinand Claiborne. He used the fort as a base for the invasion of the Creek nation with the Regular Army of the United States, the Lower Tombigbee Militia, and friendly Choctaw. The community of Claiborne began in 1816, on the former fort site. Claiborne's former Masonic Lodge #3, built in 1824 to serve as a masonic hall and courthouse. It was moved to Perdue Hill in 1884. Following the war Claiborne became one of the largest and fastest growing communities in what would become Alabama. Early settlers included three future Alabama governors: John Gayle, John Murphy, and Arthur P. Bagby. William B. Travis, a hero of the Alamo, lived in Claiborne for many years before leaving for Texas in 1831. Other prominent politicians included James Dellet and Charles Tait. The community was surveyed in 1819 by General John Coffee, with lots being numbered and sold. It was incorporated as a town on December 20, 1820 by the Alabama Legislature. The James Dellet House is the only original residence remaining in Claiborne. The first paddle steamer, the Harriet, to reach this far up the Alabama River landed at Claiborne in 1821. At that time the population had reached 2000 people. It had grown to 2500 by the time that the Marquis de Lafayette visited in April 1825 during his famous tour of all 24 US states. He was entertained in the newly built masonic hall, a building which, along with the William B. Travis house, still exists but was later moved to the nearby community of Perdue Hill. The town continued to expand during the 1830s, with the population peaking at roughly 5000 people. Claiborne served as the first county seat of Monroe County until 1832, when it was moved to the centrally located Monroeville. By then the town boasted two large hotels, numerous stores and business establishments, a cotton warehouse, a boarding house, a jail, a school, several churches, and a few hundred residences. At this point outbreaks of yellow fever and cholera stemmed further growth of the town. Claiborne remained an important shipping port and trading center throughout the 1840s and 1850s. The coming of the American Civil War saw the construction of batteries along the lower Alabama River and at Claiborne. The town was heavily looted at the end of the war. Following the war, the town quickly lost importance in the new economy. By 1872 the population had dwindled to approximately 350 people. When the new railroad through Monroe County bypassed Claiborne in the early 20th century, the fate of the settlement was sealed. By 2008 the site contained only the James Dellet House and three 19th century cemeteries. Demographics Claiborne appeared only once on the U.S. Census, in 1880, as a separately returned community. Its population was 199, which made it the largest in Monroe County. Geography Claiborne is located at and has an elevation of . Notable person * Arthur P.

China's move toward reform has been traced to an agreement among farmers in Xiaogang to secretly subdivide their common farmland in December 1978, after which the production of grain increased dramatically. The village was held up as a model for agricultural reform by China's new leadership after Deng Xiaoping came to power. History During the Great Leap Forward, the Chinese Communist Party made a series of economic reforms, where the most disastrous of them was the collectivization of the administration of private property, specially, the rural lands. Fengyang County, along with much of the rest of the country, experienced a period of famine, due to the inefficiency of the model. A quarter of the country's population died from starvation. In Xiaogang village alone, 67 villagers died of starvation out of a population of 120 between 1958 and 1960. In December 1978, eighteen of the local farmers, led by Yen Jingchang, met in the largest house in the village. They agreed to break the law at the time by signing a secret agreement to divide the land, a local People's Commune, into family plots. Each plot was to be worked by an individual family who would turn over some of what they grew to the government and the collective whilst at the same time agreeing that they could keep the surplus for themselves. The villagers also agreed that should one of them be caught and sentenced to death that the other villagers would raise their children until they were eighteen years old. At the time, the villagers were worried that another famine might strike the village after a particularly bad harvest and more people might die of hunger. After this secret capitalist reform, Xiaogang village produced a harvest that was larger than the previous five years combined. Per capita income in the village increase from 22 yuan to 400 yuan with grain output increasing to 90,000 kg in 1979. This attracted significant attention from surrounding villages and before long the government in Beijing had found out. The villagers were fortunate in that at the time China had just changed leadership after Mao Zedong had died. The new leadership under Deng Xiaoping was looking for ways to reform China's economy and the discovery of Xiaogang's innovation was held up as a model to other villages across the country. This led to the abandonment of collectivised farming across China and a large increase in agricultural production. The secret signing of the contract in Xiaogang is widely regarded as the beginning of the period of rapid economic growth and industrialisation that mainland China has experienced in the thirty years since.

Crews of five athletes alternately push their canoe across the ice on the frozen parts of the river, and paddle in a river with currents of four knots, tides of over 15 feet, and ice blocks weighing a few tonnes blown by the wind. Shoes with bolts screwed to the bottom are worn to keep their traction on the ice. History Ice canoeing has been practised since the beginnings of New France in the 1600s, as the only way to cross the Saint Lawrence River when there is too much ice for ferries, but not enough to form an ice bridge. In the 1860s more than 200 canoers, mostly at L√©vis provided transportation for passengers and goods. Ice canoeing was practised in Montreal from the early 1800s. The advent of steamboats capable of breaking through the ice put an end to icecanoeing as a means of transportation in the late 1800s. In 1894, the first race was organised between L√©vis and the Port of Quebec at the first Quebec Winter Carnival. In Montreal races were held during the F√™te des Neiges de Montr√©al from 1988 to 1992. In 2013, H√©ritage Maritime Canada relaunched the race as the D√©fi canot √† glace Bota Bota. Since the 1990s races have also been held at Toronto, Windsor, Gatineau, Trois- Rivi√®res, Chicoutimi and the Isle-aux-Coudres. Women have competed since 1987. Competition D√©fi canot √† glace Bota Bota 2014 The Association des Coureurs en Canot √† Glace du Qu√©bec (ACCGQ) was formed in 1984 to organise and standardise races. Six races are accredited by the ACCGQ: La Grande Travers√©e Casino de Charlevoix, La Course en canot du Carnaval, La course de la banquise de Portneuf, Trois-Rivi√®res Extr√™me, le D√©fi Canot √† Glace Montr√©al, and le Grand D√©fi des Glaces. The latter is the biggest event. It is run during the Quebec Winter Carnival, at Quebec City every February. More than 40 teams compete, struggling with the powerful current, large chunks of ice and cold water. The Quebec City area is the centre of ice canoeing activity, but there are teams elsewhere in the province of Quebec. A crew from Calgary has competed in the race for at least 41 years. The race has also seen teams from Chicago and France. Athletes compete in three classes: elite men, elite women, and sport, the latter comprising crews of men, and crews of mixed men and women. Originally wooden, canoes are now made with epoxy and fibreglass with an internal metal frame. The minimum weight of a canoe is for the sport and elite men classes, and for elite women. The length of the boat must be between and . Boats must contain 100 litres of flotation material, and it must be possible to float the boat with 700 litres of water on board. Canoes must be brightly-coloured and not painted white.

It established that capital punishment was inconsistent with the commitment to human rights expressed in the Interim Constitution. The court's ruling invalidated section 277(1)(a) of the Criminal Procedure Act 51 of 1977, which had provided for use of the death penalty, along with any similar provisions in any other law in force in South Africa. The court also forbade the government from carrying out the death sentence on any prisoners awaiting execution,There were about 400 of them, a moratorium having been placed on executions since 1989 as part of the country's negotiated transition to democracy (Juta's Statutes Editors. The Constitution of the Republic of South Africa. 9th Edition, 3rd Impression. Cape Town: Juta & Company, Ltd, 2010, p. xxxiii). ruling that they should remain in prison until new sentences were imposed. Delivered on 6 June, this was the newly established court's \\"first politically important and publicly controversial holding.\\"Juta's Statutes Editors, p. xxxiii.  Chance  The Court held that, in practice, there was an element of chance at every stage of the process of implementing the death penalty: > The outcome may be dependent upon factors such as the way the case is > investigated by the police, the way the case is presented by the prosecutor, > how effectively the accused is defended, the personality and particular > attitude to capital punishment of the trial judge and, if the matter goes on > appeal, the particular judges who are selected to hear the case. Race and > poverty are also alleged to be factors.S v Makwanyane at 48.  Human rights  The Court held further that the rights to life and dignity were the most important of all human rights and the source of all the other personal rights detailed in Chapter 3 of the Interim Constitution. Having committed to a society premised on the recognition and realisation of human rights, the State was required to value these two rights above all others, and to demonstrate that valuation in everything it did, including the punishment of criminals. This would not be achieved by depersonalising and executing murderers, even as a deterrent to others.S v Makwanyane at 144. Quite apart from the fact that vengeance or payback had not the same constitutional heft as the right to life and the right to dignity, the court was not satisfied that it had been shown that capital punishment would be more effective as a deterrent than a life sentence.S v Makwanyane at 146. Chaskalson P, writing for the majority, concluded that > the death sentence destroys life, which is protected without reservation > under section 9 of our Constitution, it annihilates human dignity which is > protected under section 10, elements of arbitrariness are present in its > enforcement and it is irremediable [...]. I am satisfied that in the context > of our Constitution the death penalty is indeed a cruel, inhuman and > degrading punishment. \\"S v Makwanyane at 95. The court also affirmed its commitment to the principle of constitutionalism, and more specifically constitutional values such as freedom, dignity and equality, by rejecting the \\"arbitrary and capricious\\" nature of the death penalty. Ackermann J made this much clear in his judgment: > We have moved from a past characterised by much which was arbitrary and > unequal in the operation of the law to a present and a future in a > constitutional state where state action must be such that it is capable of > being analysed and justified rationally. The idea of the constitutional > state presupposes a system whose operation can be rationally tested against > or in terms of the law. Arbitrariness, by its very nature, is dissonant with > these core concepts of our new constitutional order. Neither arbitrary > action nor laws or rules which are inherently arbitrary or must lead to > arbitrary application can, in any real sense, be tested against the precepts > or principles of the Constitution.S v Makwanyane at 156. He went on to cite Prof. Etienne Mureinik in this regard: \\"If the new Constitution is a bridge away from a culture of authority, it is clear what it must be a bridge to. It must lead to a culture of justification‚Äîa culture in which every exercise of power is expected to be justified [....] If the Constitution is to be a bridge in this direction, it is plain that the Bill of Rights must be its chief strut.\\"Mureinik, Etienne. \\"A Bridge to Where? Introducing the Interim Bill of Rights.\\" South African Journal of Human Rights, 1994: 31‚Äì48 at 32.  Public opinion  Although it was widely believed that a majority of the population favoured retention of the death penalty, the court affirmed its commitment to its duties as an independent arbiter of the Constitution.S v Makwanyane at 89. It would not act merely as a vector for public opinion: > The question before us, however, is not what the majority of South Africans > believe a proper sentence for murder should be. It is whether the > Constitution allows the sentence.S v Makwanyane at 87. If public opinion were to be decisive, Chaskalson reasoned, there would be no need for constitutional assessment and adjudication. Although popular sentiment could have some bearing on the court's considerations, \\"in itself, it is no substitute for the duty vested in the Courts to interpret the Constitution and to uphold its provisions without fear or favour.\\"S v Makwanyane at 88.

William Vickers, ed. M. Seattle, The Great Northern Tune Book, 2nd ed. (English Folk Dance and Song Society with the Northumbrian Pipers' Society, 2008). The manuscript is incomplete - 31 pages have not survived, though their contents are listed at the beginning of the book. In the mid-19th century, it belonged to the pipemaker John Baty, of Wark, Northumberland, and it now belongs to the Society of Antiquaries of Newcastle upon Tyne. It is kept in the Northumberland County Record Office at Woodhorn, Ashington. The man Little is known of the man himself, but something can be learned from the manuscript - he was obviously a keen musician, and many tunes are only playable on the fiddle. The collection does not only contain fiddle tunes however, for instance there are numerous tunes with the characteristic 9-note range and mode of the Border pipes. Several of the tune titles refer to Northumberland and Durham and a lot of other tunes are local to the region, so it is reasonable to conclude he lived in or around Newcastle. He may well have been the William Vickers who was married at St Nicholas, Newcastle, in 1775, probably the same as the Excise Officer of the same name whose son, also William, was baptised there the following year. He certainly had some education, and a sense of humour - the tunes are introduced by a poem: :Musicks a Crotchet the Sober thinks it Vain :The Fiddles a Wooding Projection :Tunes are but Flights of a Whimsical Brain :Which the Bottle brings best to Parfection :Musisians are half witted mery and madd :And Those are the same that admire Them :Theyr fools if they Pley unless their Well Paid :And the Others are Blockheads to Hire them. The tunes Although many tunes are local to the North East of England, many others are from Scotland, southern England, Ireland and even France and Germany, revealing the very extensive and varied repertoire of local musicians at that time. Again, many of the tunes go back a century and more to sources such as Playford, while many others were contemporary, for instance 'Tristram Shandy' is named after the novel whose first volumes were published just a decade before. There is a wide spread of tune types - FARNE lists 53 9/8 jigs, 192 6/8 jigs, 251 reels, 20 triple-time hornpipes, 32 common-time hornpipes, and 17 cotillons. The collection includes many tunes not known elsewhere, while many tunes still current today make their first known appearance in it, including 'The College Hornpipe', 'The Irish Washerwoman' and 'Soldier's Joy'. Frustratingly, one of the 31 missing pages included the first known reference to 'The Morpeth Rant', a characteristic local dance tune. Published and online editions A facsimile of all the tune pages of the manuscript is visible on FARNE, with some annotations by Matt Seattle. The recent 2nd edition of the published book contains much more detailed notes, making clear the relation of tunes to any contemporary published or manuscript versions known, and listing many alternative titles for the tunes. There had been a local revival of interest in this music since the 1960s, led by the High Level Ranters. After the first publication of an edition of the tunebook in 1987, The Great Northern Tune Book, vols. 1-3, ed. Matt Seattle, (Dragonfly Music, 1987). this interest became much more widespread. Many of the tunes are once again current in Northumberland and elsewhere, and are frequently performed and recorded.

Bacteria serve as natural hosts. There are currently 371 species in this family, divided among 9 subfamilies and 131 genera. History Since the 1990s, the term \\"T7 supergroup\\" has been coined for the expanding group of bacteriophages related to coliphage T7, as members of the family Podoviridae. Enterobacteriaceae phages SP6 and K1-5 were the first to be considered as an estranged subgroup of the \\"T7 supergroup\\". Pseudomonas phage phiKMV also shared commonalities at the genome organizational level. As such, based on the available morphological and proteomic data, this clade of viruses was established as a subfamily of the family Podoviridae. The subfamily was later raised to the level of family in 2019. Definition The name of this family, termed Autographiviridae, refers to the ‚Äúauto-graphein‚Äù or ‚Äúself-transcribing‚Äù phages which encode their own (single subunit) RNA polymerase, a common characteristic among its members. Structure Viruses in Autographiviridae are non-enveloped, with icosahedral and Head-tail geometries, and T=7 symmetry. The diameter is around 60 nm. Genomes are linear, around 40-42kb in length. Life cycle Viral replication is cytoplasmic. DNA templated transcription is the method of transcription. The virus exits the host cell by lysis, and holin/endolysin/spanin proteins. Bacteria serve as the natural host. Transmission routes are passive diffusion. Taxonomy The following subfamilies are recognized: *Beijerinckvirinae *Colwellvirinae *Corkvirinae *Krylovirinae *Melnykvirinae *Molineuxvirinae *Okabevirinae *Slopekvirinae *Studiervirinae The following genera are unassigned to a subfamily: *Aegirvirus *Aqualcavirus *Ashivirus *Atuphduovirus *Ayakvirus *Ayaqvirus *Banchanvirus *Bifseptvirus *Bonnellvirus *Cheungvirus *Chosvirus *Cuernavacavirus *Cyclitvirus *Ermolevavirus *Foturvirus *Foussvirus *Fussvirus *Gajwadongvirus *Gyeongsanvirus *Igirivirus *Jalkavirus *Jiaoyazivirus *Kafavirus *Kajamvirus *Kakivirus *Kalppathivirus *Kelmasvirus *Kembevirus *Krakvirus *Lauvirus *Limelightvirus *Lingvirus *Lirvirus *Lullwatervirus *Maculvirus *Napahaivirus *Nohivirus *Oinezvirus *Paadamvirus *Pagavirus *Pairvirus *Pedosvirus *Pekhitvirus *Pelagivirus *Percyvirus *Piedvirus *Podivirus *Pollyceevirus *Poseidonvirus *Powvirus *Pradovirus *Qadamvirus *Scottvirus *Sednavirus *Serkorvirus *Sieqvirus *Stompelvirus *Stopalavirus *Stopavirus *Stupnyavirus *Tangaroavirus *Tawavirus *Tiamatvirus *Tiilvirus *Tritonvirus *Voetvirus *Votkovvirus *Waewaevirus *Wuhanvirus (not to be confused with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) References External links * Viralzone: Autographivirinae * ICTV Category:Virus families ","title":"Autographiviridae"},{"id":"30484187","text":"Cities XL 2012 is a city simulator developed by Focus Home Interactive.

The name came from the \\"rose\\" for the beauty and the \\"avalanche\\" for the power, as a way of describing their music. Before they had played a gig they signed to local independent label LiL, and released two singles: \\"LA Rain\\" and \\"Goddess\\". Both made the Top 20 of the UK Independent Chart, with \\"LA Rain\\" also featuring in John Peel‚Äôs (the legendary Radio1 DJ) Festive 50 in 1985. After this initial success, Fire Records signed the band and the personnel changed. The \\"classic\\" line up was now Phil Morris, Paul James Berry, Glenn Schultz, Nicol McKay, and Mark Thompson. \\"Mass market\\" exposure came with the support slot on The Mission's 1986/87 World Crusade Tour. This line up released a further five singles and the first official studio album ‚Äì \\"Never Another Sunset\\" in 1989. Shultz and McKay left the band in 1989, and new bass player Darren Horner was recruited to replace McKay. This line up released one EP \\"A Peace Inside\\". Further personnel changes occurred in 1990 with Thompson leaving to be replaced by Andy Porter.

He established a shipyard with his brother Hugh; the brothers also exported timber and fish. Montgomery married Elizabeth Hamilton in 1834. He was a justice of the peace, a justice for the Inferior Court of Common Pleas, a school board trustee and an officer in the militia, as well as holding various other offices. Montgomery was a member of the Executive Council from 1843 to 1846 and again from 1853 to 1854 and served as surveyor general from 1856 to 1857. A supporter of union with Canada, he was defeated in the 1865 general election. He died in Dalhousie at the age of 66. His son William also served in the provincial assembly and his grandson William Scott Montgomery served as the first mayor of Dalhousie.

Ponsonby has a church which was constructed in 1840 and had further additions in 1874. Ponsonby is located along and just off the A595. It has a population of 205 according to the 2011 Census Data.  Location  Ponsonby is located along the A595 in the heart of the Copeland district in Cumbria and is on the edge of the Lake District National Park. Ponsonby is 2.5 miles away from the next large village of Gosforth and 10.9 miles away from Whitehaven which is Ponsonby's nearest town.  History  In the 1870s Ponsonby was described as :\\"PONSONBY, a parish in Whitehaven district, Cumberland; on the river Calder, at Calder-Bridge. The manor was held, at the Norman Conquest, by the Ponsonbys, ancestors of the Earl of Bessborough, and, with P. Hall, belongs now to W. Stanley, Esq. The hall was built about 1786; containsmany old curiosities, brought from Dalegarth; and stands in a finely wooded park, with picturesque features, and commanding extensive views. A Roman camp is at P. Fell. The living is a p. curacy in the diocese of Carlisle. Value, ¬£113.* Patron, W. Stanley, Esq. The church is ancient; and has some old stained glass, and a tower and spire; and contains monuments of the Stanleys.\\" Just outside the village of Ponsonby is Calder Bridge, within which lies the Grade II listed Pelham House (named after Herbert Pelham, 3rd bishop of Barrow-in- Furness) but formerly known as Ponsonby Hall. It was built in 1774 and was designed by James Paine for Edward Stanley. This is currently used as offices for the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority (NDA), and before this was used as a School for Boys.  Ponsonby Church  The church is located between the Village of Ponsonby and Calder Bridge and is a Grade 2 listed building. The church has many links to the Stanley Family who were part of the village of Ponsonby and lived in the Calderbridge during the 14th Century and the church has a number of different memorials to the family. The church can be accessed by passing the dry moat, the moat is there due to the time the Church was built. From the Church you can see Sellafield (West) and the Lakeland Fells (North-East)  Population  Population time Series for Ponsonby, Cumbria between 1801 and 2011 The village's population has increased since 1801 to a figure of 205 in 2011, in 106 households, all identifying as White. 165 people living in Ponsonby state that they are Christian, with 1 person Buddhist, and the remainder stating no religion or did not answer the section in the Census. The village is made up of 106 households, 7 do not have central heating.  Employment  Employment in 1881 The Employment graph of 1881 shows there are many more men employed in the village than women. Women were often 'Home Workers' meaning that they would do domestic duties around the home. The sector that employed the most women is the Domestic Indoor Servant, essentially meaning that they were doing domestic duties in wealthy households within the community. The male population of Ponsonby were largely employed in the agricultural sector, either being a farmer, a farmer's son or male relative or an agricultural worker. The graph shows that there are very few people employed in high paying jobs, this could be due to the lack of education within the area. Employment in 2001 The employment graph of 2001 shows there has been an increase in the number of women employed in Ponsonby and an increase in the different sectors that people are employed in. There are a lot more people employed in 'office' jobs now compared to 1881, however agriculture is still the biggest employer. There is an increase in women working in Agriculture and Manufacturing, but males still dominate this area of work. From the graph it is apparent that there is more people travelling away from the village to work in cities where the 'office' jobs are located. There has also been an increase in the variety of Jobs that people from Ponsonby are working in, during 1881 many of the jobs were practical jobs and manual jobs, however there has now been a switch and the majority of people are working in 'office' jobs or terrestrial jobs.

She began her professional stage career at age 15 and was playing roles in the West End by age 18. She appeared in the hit musical The Boy (1917), which led to a starring role in The Freedom of the Seas in 1918. At the age of 22, she was found dead, apparently of a drug overdose. Life and career Born Florence Leonora Stewart in Bloomsbury, London, daughter of a chorus singer named Margaret Stewart and an unknown father, Carleton was raised by her aunt, Catherine Joliffe.Hoare, Philip. \\"Carleton, Billie (1896‚Äì1918)\\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004, accessed 31 January 2012 Carleton left home at 15 to work on the stage and received her first break when the impresario C.B. Cochran promoted her from the chorus to a role in his 1914 revue Watch Your Step. According to Cochran, despite having a weak voice, Carleton had a good stage presence, and her delicate beauty charmed the audience.Cochran, p. 209: \\"Despite her inexperience and her tiny voice, she pleased the audiences. A more beautiful creature has never fluttered upon a stage. She seemed scarcely human, so fragile was she\\". When he was informed during the run of the show that Carleton was attending opium parties, Cochran fired her. He gave her another chance in 1917, when she took over the leading role from Gertie Millar in his show Houp La! She made little impression in the part, which she took on only a week before the show closed.\\"Theatres\\", The Times, 15 February 1917, p. 8 and 17 February 1917, p. 8 Carleton soon appeared for Andr√© Charlot in another revue Some More Samples! Although the critics again noted her weak voice,Tatler, 26 September 1917, cited in Kohn, p. 74 she had better success in this, and was engaged for the part of Joy Chatterton, a flapper in the hit musical farce The Boy when it opened at the Adelphi Theatre in August 1917. In May 1918, she appeared in Fair and Warmer, this time playing a maid to Fay Compton's flapper. Then in August, she took the starring role of Phyllis Harcourt in The Freedom of the Seas at the Haymarket Theatre, briefly becoming the youngest leading lady in the West End. Death and scandal On 27 November 1918, she left the theatre after performing, and, wearing a daringly diaphanous outfit designed by her friend Reggie de Veulle, attended the Victory Ball at the Royal Albert Hall.Hoare, pp. 38‚Äì39 It was one of many such events held to commemorate the recent end of the war, but being under the patronage of a large number of aristocratic ladies, it was a particularly long and splendid affair, lasting into the small hours. The next day Carleton's maid found her dead in bed in her Savoy Hotel suite,De Castella, Tom. \\"100 years of the war on drugs\\", BBC News, 24 January 2012 apparently killed by an overdose of cocaine.Kohn, p. 40 A coroner's inquest found that Carleton had died of a cocaine overdose \\"supplied to her by Reginald de Veulle in a culpable and negligent manner\\".Kohn, p. 95 De Veulle was charged with manslaughter and conspiracy to supply a prohibited drug under Regulation 40b of the Defence of the Realm Act 1914, which had been passed in 1916 and made possession of both cocaine and opium illegal for the first time in Britain.The Defence of the Realm Act, Regulation 40b, 1916.Kohn, p. 44 The trial was held before Mr Justice Salter, with Sir Richard Muir for the prosecution. De Veulle was acquitted of the first charge but pleaded guilty to the second, and was sentenced to eight months in prison.\\"De Veulle sent to prison: a charge of conspiracy: plea of guilty\\", The Times, 8 April 1919, p. 7 Reports of the trial exposed details of Carleton's private life and those of her friends, particularly de Veulle, who previously had been involved in a homosexual blackmail case and had dressed in women's clothes.McLaren, p. 126 Although the milieu in which she moved was stigmatised as immoral and sordid, and although she had been the kept mistress of a man twenty years her senior, Carleton was seen largely as an innocent victim.Hoare, ODNB: \\"By then Billie Carleton had become a symbol of the drug-threatened and wronged female abused by older, usually foreign, men; behind her lurked the spectre of the opium den and the white slave trade. The more complicated story of her own manipulativeness was lost in the publicity that surrounded her very public demise.\\" Ada Song Ping You was a Scotswoman who had married a Chinese man (Song Ping You) from whom she learned to use opium.\\"Drug Traffic in London\\", Daily Express, 14 December 1918, p. 1. After Carleton's death, You was sentenced to five months in jail with hard labour for preparing opium for smoking and supplying it to Carleton. The author Marek Kohn, however, argues that Carleton did not die from cocaine but from legal depressants taken to deal with her cocaine hangover. In art and literature No√´l Coward, who had known both Carleton and de Veulle, acknowledged her story as a source for his first successful play, The Vortex.

The plane operating the flight, which was only 6 weeks old, flew into the ground soon after take-off after a scheduled stopover in Windhoek, South West Africa (present day Namibia) on 20 April 1968. Five passengers survived, while 123 people died. The subsequent investigation determined that the accident was attributable largely to pilot error; the manufacturer subsequently also recognised the lack of a ground proximity warning system in its aircraft. The accident is the deadliest aviation accident to date in Namibia. History of the flight South African Airways Flight 228 was a scheduled flight of the Boeing 707-300C Pretoria, registration ZS-EUW, from Johannesburg to Heathrow via Windhoek, Luanda, Las Palmas and Frankfurt. Flight 228 was piloted by Captain Eric Ray Smith (49), First Officer John Peter Holliday (34), The Flight Navigator Richard Fullarton Armstrong (26) and Flight Engineer Phillip Andrew Minnaar (50) The first leg of the flight from Johannesburg to JG Strijdom Airport, Windhoek, South West Africa, was uneventful. An additional 46 passengers embarked in Windhoek, and some airfreight was unloaded and loaded. The aircraft took off from Windhoek on runway 08 at 18:49 GMT (20:49 local time). It was a dark, moonless night with few, if any, lights on the ground in the open desert east of the runway; the aircraft took off into what was described in the official report as a \\"black hole\\". (Archive) The aircraft initially climbed to an altitude of above ground level, then leveled off after 30 seconds and started to descend. Crash site of SA228 near Windhoek Fifty seconds after take-off, it flew into the ground in flight configuration at a speed of approximately . The four engines, which were the first parts of the aircraft to touch the ground, created four gouges in the soil before the rest of the aircraft also hit the ground and broke up. Two fires immediately broke out when fuel in the wings ignited. Although the crash site was only from the end of the runway, emergency services took 40 minutes to reach the scene because of rugged terrain. Nine passengers who were seated in the forward section of the fuselage initially survived, but two died soon after the accident, and another two a few days later, leaving a final death toll of 123 passengers and crew. Investigation The investigation was complicated by the fact that the aircraft did not have a flight data recorder or cockpit voice recorder; the devices became mandatory from 1 January 1968, but the airline's inability to procure recorders meant that several SAA aircraft, including ZS-EUW, did not yet have the equipment fitted. Captain Smith had 4,608 flying hours on the Boeing 707, but only one hour (which was in training) on the new type 344C. The official investigation concluded that the aircraft and its four engines were in working order‚Äî primary fault lay with the captain and first officer, as they \\"failed to maintain a safe airspeed and altitude and a positive climb by not observing flight instruments during take-off\\"; no blame was attributed to the third pilot, whose responsibility it was to monitor the radio, and who was unable to monitor the flight instruments from his position in the cockpit. Secondary factors that may have contributed to the accident included: *Loss of situational awareness *The crew had no visual reference in the dark, leading to spatial disorientation. *The crew used a flap retraction sequence from the 707-B series which removed flaps in larger increments than desirable for that stage of the flight, leading to a loss of lift at above ground level. *Temporary confusion on the part of the pilots when reading the vertical speed indicator, which was different from the A and B series of the aircraft to which they were accustomed. *The drum-type altimeter fitted to the aircraft, was notoriously difficult for pilots to read; the crew may have misread their altitude by 1000 feet. *Flight deck distraction as the result of a bird strike or other minor occurrence. After investigating this accident, as well as a number of others that also involved controlled flight into terrain, the Federal Aviation Administration determined that a ground proximity warning system would have helped prevent some of the accidents. New regulations were therefore introduced from February 1972 requiring all turbojet aircraft to be fitted with the system.

It consists of just three streets - St. Louis Place, St. Charles Place, and St. Augustine Place - as well as an internal sidewalk known as Malcolm's Way (in honor of the local citizen most associated with it) that bisects them from St. Charles to St. Louis. It was originally designed to give quicker access to the streetcar stop at Ponce. History The first use of the land after its formal platting was farmland. Between 1902 and 1905, Edwin Wiley Grove (a St. Louis businessman who later developed the famous Grove Park Inn and the Grove Arcade in Asheville, North Carolina) purchased the land. Grove owned a pharmaceutical company that provided the means for him to acquire real estate for the development of neighborhoods. Development of Atkins Park began in 1912 as a streetcar suburb of Atlanta, linked to downtown via the Nine-Mile Circle streetcar line. The original name was St. Louis Park; it was changed \\"to honor a family friend and mentor\\" Colonel John DeWitt Clinton Atkins, a representative of Tennessee in both the U.S. Congress and the Confederate Congress. A section of Atkins Park has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places since 1982. Government Atkins Park has its own community association APNA. For purposes of formal civic participation in matters that go before the city's Neighborhood Planning Unit (NPU-F, in this case), Atkins Park is part of the Virginia-Highland neighborhood and its association Virginia-Highland Civic Association (VHCA). APNA provides a member of its own choice to the VHCA Board. Park North Highland Park, a small 0.41-acre park purchased by the VHCA in 2008 and formally opened in 2012, is located on the site of a former public library at the northeast corner of St. Charles Place and North Highland Avenue.

The program begins with a fall conference in Russia, followed by six months of work on collaborative research projects and a capstone conference in the spring at Stanford University. Currently in its tenth year, more than 400 undergraduate, graduate, and professional school students from Russia and the U.S. have participated in the program. __TOC__  History  SURF organizers with Condoleezza Rice SURF was founded in the fall of 2008 by four students from Stanford University and Moscow State University who wanted to maintain dialogue on U.S.-Russia cooperation despite the deterioration in relations caused by the Russo-Georgian war. SURF‚Äôs first public event was a one-day conference in November 2008 at Moscow State University focused on the most pressing problems in US-Russian relations. The conference attracted widespread student interest and was attended by delegates from MSU, MGIMO, the Higher School of Economics, the Academy of National Economy, as well as students from Stanford University, Yale University and University of Pennsylvania. In the fall of 2009, the organization launched the SURF Exchange Program, a six-month program for twenty American and twenty Russian students, selected on a competitive basis. During the fall, the SURF delegates participated in a series of virtual seminars with guest lecturers including Dmitri Trenin (Director, Carnegie Moscow Center) and Donald Kennedy (Editor, Science). In the winter, the delegates continued to meet virtually in small groups that researched and produced Collaborative Research Projects (CRP). The program concluded with a week-long capstone conference at Stanford University in April 2010. The capstone conference brought together organizers, participants and sponsors of SURF, as well as a number of special guests. Speakers included the 66th U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, Assistant to the President of the Russian Federation Arkady Dvorkovich, and Former Adviser to US President Bill Clinton for Russia and Ukraine Coit Blacker. Following the conference, the CRP results were published in the SURF Journal. The first SURF Exchange Program was formally recognized for its work fostering civil society ties between the US and Russia by Russian Minister for Foreign Affairs Sergei Lavrov. Dvorkovich talks Russian economics The Stanford Daily. (April 15, 2010)] Delegates present their CRP  Program  = Structure = SURF alumni with Dmitry Medvedev Since 2010, the SURF Exchange Program has consisted of two major components: conferences and Collaborative Research Projects (CRP). The program opens each fall with a week-long conference in Moscow where delegates meet with experts in academia, business, and policy to learn about current issues in U.S.-Russia relations. The 20 American and 20 Russian delegates also meet in person for the first time and finalize their research questions for their four-person research teams. The collaborative research component lasts for six months. Research topics have included cyber-security, public health, nuclear and energy issues, news and the media, space cooperation, entrepreneurship and business, cooperation in the Arctic, the environment, and a number of others. In some cases, groups are paired with sponsoring institutions that submit problems or question for the group to research, to ensure that each CRP group produced work relevant to the real world. Sponsoring institutions have included the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, the Russian Ministry of Energy, Stanford Institute for Economic Policy Research, Renova Group, Draper Fisher Jurvetson and The Boeing Company. In the spring, the students meet at Stanford University for a capstone conference to present their research to policy-makers and other experts. Talks are also held with notable experts from a wide range of fields to deepen participants‚Äô knowledge of U.S.-Russia relations. Delegates in Fort Ross SURF is housed at the Freeman Spogli Institute for International Studies (FSI) at Stanford University and it is also supported by its founding partner universities, Moscow State University, Moscow State Institute of International Relations (University) of the MFA of Russia (MGIMO), the Higher School of Economics (NRU-HSE), and the Academy of National Economy. = Participants = More than 40 students from over 40 Russian, American and international universities have participated in SURF since the program‚Äôs inception. The program accepts undergraduate, graduate and professional school students from all disciplines, and no previous exposure to Russia is required. Instead, the program prioritizes intellectual curiosity, leadership and impact potential, and research skills. Selection for participation in the program is very competitive; the overall acceptance rate for the 2014-2015 program was 7.5%. = Notable Speakers = Coit Blacker, former Special Assistant to the President of the United States for National Security Affairs and Senior Director for Russian, Ukrainian and Eurasian Affairs at the National Security Council Steven Chu, former U.S. Secretary of Energy Arkady Dvorkovich, Deputy Prime Minister of Russia Siegfried Hecker, former Director of Los Alamos Labs Vladimir Mau, Rector of Russian Academy of National Economy and Public Administration (RANEPA) Michael McFaul, former U.S. Ambassador to Russia, former Special Assistant to the President and Senior Director of Russian and Eurasian Affairs.

Gadyen Dlo has been produced and distributed in Haiti since 2002, originally supported by Emory University and the US Centers for Disease Control. Gadyen Dlo (Haitian Creole for \\"Water Guardian\\") is a Haitian produced 0.7% sodium hypochlorite liquid solution used to chlorinate drinking water at \\"point of use.\\" Gadyen Dlo is produced at four sites throughout Haiti (West, Northwest, North, and South Departments). Gadyen Dlo is distributed to households in refillable bottles, preferably along with safe water storage containers (5 gallon plastic buckets with taps, lids, and instructions with pictures and Creole). Several studies by MIT and Emory University have consistently shown that 65 ‚Äì 85% of households had positive chlorine residual at the time of an unannounced visit. An evaluation in 2007 revealed 76% of tests conducted by technicians showed positive chlorine residual, and there was no significant decrease in correct use after more than three years of families‚Äô entrance into the program. An independent evaluation in 2010 among 706 children under 5 documented a reduction in diarrhoeal disease incidence of 51%.  Household distribution  As of November 2010, the Gadyen Dlo household distribution program reaches almost 40,000 households and an estimated 20,408 children under 5 with continuous provision of Gadyen Dlo. These households are located primarily in rural areas throughout eight of the ten departments of Haiti. There are four chlorine production sites, fifteen distinct project sites, and a total of 230 distributors throughout all of these sites. Gadyen Dlo works with a variety of models in which distributors are compensated through structures ranging from full-time employees to part- time employees who conduct other community health services to vendors who simply resell products for a margin. These programs are supported by INGOs, churches, individuals, and corporate donors.  Wholesale distribution  In 2010 alone, the Wholesale Program has delivered 13,669 L (3,611 gallons) of Gadyen Dlo to treat 48,505,526 L (12,813,805 gallons) of water. These deliveries have been made to and distributed by partners including DINEPA (Haiti's Ministry of Water and Sanitation), UNICEF, United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti (MINUSTAH), and Samaritan's Purse. Additionally, 4,541 household safe water storage containers have been delivered to these partners, which will serve 20,889 Haitians. These distributions are typically accompanied by a training session for the partner organization's staff and distributors on hygiene promotion, distribution methods, and effective use of Gadyen Dlo.  Dispensers  In partnership with Innovations for Poverty Action and Harvard University, DSI is implementing a chlorine dispensers pilot project in the Grand-Go√¢ve commune in Haiti that dispenses Gadyen Dlo \\"at source.\\"  Press  In addition to being the 2008 Templeton Freedom Awards recipient for Social Entrepreneurship, DSI and Gadyen Dlo have been recently recognized in the following media outlets: * Bringing Safe Water to Haiti, Access on Public Radio, * The GeDUNK (Grove City College Alumni Magazine) * The Pittsburgh Tribune-Review * Emory University (Alumni Magazine) * Essence Magazine * UNICEF and UNICEF TV * Georgia Tech (Alumni Magazine) * Yahoo!

It also offers partial subsidies for private housing, assisting another 32,000 people, and administers federal Section 8 vouchers. The agency's performance is periodically reviewed by a nine-member council, the BHA Monitoring Committee, which reports to the mayor.\\"Monitoring Committee.\\" Boston Housing Authority.  History  The BHA was established on October 1, 1935 by the mayor and city council of Boston under Massachusetts General Law allowing cities and towns of Massachusetts to establish housing authorities. According to Massachusetts law, its mission was to be responsible for providing decent, safe and sanitary housing for families unable to afford housing without public subsidies. BHA was also charged with clearing substandard, decadent or blighted open areas and urban redevelopment, although this responsibility was later transferred to the Boston Redevelopment Authority (BRA) in 1957.Swett, Kristen, (archivist), \\"City of Boston Archives and Records Management Division: Guide to the Boston Housing Authority records : Reports and publications relating to public housing\\", City of Boston Archives and Records Management Division, Dates of materials: 1942-1978 The first BHA housing projects were opened between 1938 and 1942.Cf. Vale (2000), p.161 and onward The management and governance of the BHA is different from that of other housing authorities since 1975, when BHA was sued in Boston City Housing Court by a group of BHA tenants, represented by Greater Boston Legal Services, regarding poor conditions in housing projects under the authority's control. As a result of the ruling which was in favor of the tenants, a court- appointed master prepared a report listing recommendations that provided the basis for a consent decree signed in 1977 by BHA, Greater Boston Legal Services and the Boston Public Housing Tenants Policy Council. The decree listed a series of improvements that BHA was supposed to make over the course of three years. The master, responsible for monitoring BHA's compliance with the consent decree, gave approval for all major decisions made by the BHA board and administrator. In 1979, the judge ruled that BHA had failed to satisfactorily fulfill the terms of the consent decree and BHA was placed in receivership, with its board of commissioners and administrator replaced by a court-appointed receiver. Since 1990, when the receivership ended, BHA has been directed by an administrator whose activities are reviewed by a nine- member monitoring committee appointed by the mayor of Boston. Kathryn Bennett was named Acting Administrator in July of 2019. List of developments , the BHA oversees 70 developments across 13 Boston neighborhoods.

It was extensively used for scientific experiments by NASA and the United States military between 1956 and 1976. Development Development of the Cajun sounding rocket began in early 1956 at the Pilotless Aircraft Research Division (PARD) of the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics' - later NASA - Langley Research Center, as a development of the earlier Deacon experimental rocket.Corliss 1971, p.24. Utilising the Deacon's airframe but an improved motor that utilised new, higher-energy propellants to provide better performance, the name \\"Cajun\\" was applied to the rocket by the leader of PARD's rocket division, a native of New Orleans. The Cajun rocket was constructed of stainless steel, with extruded Duraluminum stabilising fins. The rocket motor, developed by Thiokol, was capable of producing up to thrust. Operational history The first test launch of the Cajun rocket took place at the Wallops Island range in Virginia on June 20, 1956. The rocket proved to be as successful as expected, and was quickly put into extensive use, both on its own and as an upper stage in the Nike Cajun (or CAN, 'Cajun And Nike'),Parsch 2002 first launched on July 6, 1956;Corliss 1971, p.25. and in the Terasca three-stage rocket, first launched May 1, 1959.Parsch 2007 Several other sounding rocket configurations made use of the Cajun stage, the most extensively used being the Cajun Dart; the Bullpup-Cajun and Double Cajun rockets also utilised the stage. In total, over eight hundred launches of the Cajun rocket in its various configurations were conducted between 1956 and October 6, 1976, when the final Cajun flight, in the Nike-Cajun configuration, was undertaken at Wallops Island.

It is named after the village of Dent in Dentdale, on the western margin of the Yorkshire Dales. The fault, or rather the 'Dent Fault System' ‚Äì a collection of closely associated faults and folds, defines the western edge of the Askrigg Block, a geological structure that underlies the Yorkshire Dales. The fault is associated with the Taythes Anticline to its west and the Fell End Syncline to its east. Other than vertical movement on the fault, there has also been an element of strike-slip movement. To the north, the fault links with the Pennine Fault System in the vicinity of Brough and with the Craven Fault System near Kirkby Lonsdale to the south.Stone et al. 2010 British Regional Geology: Northern England (5th edition) Keyworth, Notts, British Geological Survey Regional setting The Carboniferous geology of northern England consists of a series of relatively high and stable \\"blocks\\", such as the Alston Block separated by actively subsiding \\"basins\\", generally referred to as \\"troughs\\", such as the Stainmore and Gainsborough Troughs. Some of the blocks are underpinned by granitic intrusions of either Ordovician or Devonian age. The block and basin terrain was a result of active extensional faulting, with a dominant N-S extension direction, possibly related to the effects of back-arc spreading related to north-directed subduction beneath Avalonia. Later in the Carboniferous, the onset of continental collision to the south of Avalonia, caused widespread reactivation of the extensional faults in reverse. Many of the basin show signs of inversion at this time. The dominant shortening direction in northwest England is NNW-SSE. Geometry The Dent Fault consists of a series of linked steep SSW-NNE trending sub-parallel faults with associated folds. The northern part of the structure, known as the Dent Line, has the form of a faulted monocline that eventually links through to the Pennine Fault.

Headquartered in Toronto, Ontario, the service supported up thousands of webcomics and blogs with auctioned online advertisements, until it was shut down in 2018. Concept and development Ryan North in 2011 In early 2006, Ryan North was talking with a friend about how they severely disliked existing online advertisement services such as Google ads and AdSense, because advertisements on those platforms are priced based on user clicks or displays, and \\"the Internet isn't really designed to keep track of who clicked where, when, and who viewed what page when.\\" Project Wonderful launched 8 months later. Rather than paying for clicks, Project Wonderful allowed websites to auction advertisement space. Advertisers were able to bid on a particular ad block on a particular website and, as long as their bid was the highest, they got to decide what is shown on it. Being invite-only, Project Wonderful initially only had a few dozen advertisers participating in the \\"perpetual auction\\" of ad space, though this number grew rapidly. Project Wonderful was built on open source software, coupled with MySQL databases and an Apache front-end. The service was designed specifically for cartoonists, but in turn worked well for any independent website. Implementing new features into Project Wonderful took up most of North's time in the years following its initial release, together with his webcomic Dinosaur Comics. Usage Many webcomics, including Awkward Zombie, Loading Artist, Saturday Morning Breakfast Cereal, Questionable Content, Qwantz, MS Paint Adventures, Sinfest, and A Softer World used Project Wonderful as an advertising service. The service was used on platforms such as ComicSpace and Graphic Smash immediately after launch. Shaenon Garrity worked on implementing Project Wonderful on the subscription service Modern Tales in 2007. At its peak, Project Wonderful had around 10,000 publishers, of which over 5,000 were webcomics, and about 10 times that many advertisers. Shutdown On June 11, 2018, Project Wonderful announced that it would be shutting down on August 1, 2018. North noted the rise of large social media platforms such as Facebook keeping readers within their systems as a cause for the diminishing of the blogosphere. As fewer users visit dozens or hundreds of different websites a day, supporting independent websites with advertisements became more difficult.

Trinlay Ch√∂dron, In the service of his country: the biography of Dasang Damdul Tsarong, commander general of Tibet, Snow Lion Publications, 2000, , p. 26 The southern bridgehead was built on the mountain Chowuri, which is sacred in Tibetan Buddhism. This mountain was a site where Guru Rinpoche and Trisong Detsen had meditated during the 8th Century. When it was built, its main section was the longest unsupported span in the world, with a central span estimated at around . At the time it was built, there were no suspension bridges anywhere else in the world. In 1444, a monastery Chaksam Chuwori () was founded on the southern bridgehead. During its existence, the monastery served as the seat of Chakzampa school of Tibetan Buddhism. Supported by the bridge toll, the monastery at one point hosted about 100 monks. The monastery was destroyed during the Cultural Revolution. History By the 1860s, the bridge was in a state of disrepair that a ferry was in operation slightly upstream offering safer passage. By 1904, the river had overflown the north bank leaving the northern bridgehead on an island, thus rendering the bridge functionally ineffective. The ferryman mostly came from a nearby village of Chun or Junba, which is the only fishing village in Tibet. The ferry service continued as late as 1959. During the Qing expedition to Tibet of 1910, the 13th Dalai Lama decided to seek refuge in India. His general Tsarong fought a skirmish against the Chinese here, holding their advances allowing the Dalai Lama to safely arrive in India. The bridge was torn down by the Chinese government in the 1950s when they were building the concrete bridge in its place. The new concrete bridge Qushui Yaluzangbujiang Bridge opened on August 1, 1966.

Education Fesenko was educated at St. Petersburg State University where he was awarded a PhD in 1987. Career and research Fesenko was awarded the Prize of the Petersburg Mathematical Society in 1992. Since 1995, he is professor in pure mathematics at University of Nottingham. He contributed to several areas of number theory such as class field theory and its generalizations, as well as to various related developments in pure mathematics. Since 2015, he is the principal investigator of Nottingham-Oxford-EPSRC Programme Grant \\"Symmetries and Correspondences\\". Fesenko contributed to explicit formulas for the generalized Hilbert symbol on local fields and higher local field, higher class field theory, p-class field theory, arithmetic noncommutative local class field theory. He coauthored a textbook on local fields and a volume on higher local fields. Fesenko discovered a higher Haar measure and integration on various higher local and adelic objects. He pioneered the study of zeta functions in higher dimensions by developing his theory of higher adelic zeta integrals. These integrals are defined using the higher Haar measure and objects from higher class field theory. Fesenko generalized the Iwasawa-Tate theory from 1-dimensional global fields to 2-dimensional arithmetic surfaces such as proper regular models of elliptic curves over global fields. His theory led to three further developments. The first development is the study of functional equation and meromorphic continuation of the Hasse zeta function of a proper regular model of an elliptic curve over a global field. This study led Fesenko to introduce a new mean-periodicity correspondence between the arithmetic zeta functions and mean-periodic elements of the space of smooth functions on the real line of not more than exponential growth at infinity. This correspondence can be viewed as a weaker version of the Langlands correspondence, where L-functions and replaced by zeta functions and automorphicity is replaced by mean- periodicity. This work was followed by a joint work with Suzuki and Ricotta. The second development is an application to the generalized Riemann hypothesis, which in this higher theory is reduced to a certain positivity property of small derivatives of the boundary function and to the properties of the spectrum of the Laplace transform of the boundary function. The third development is a higher adelic study of relations between the arithmetic and analytic ranks of an elliptic curve over a global field, which in conjectural form are stated in the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture for the zeta function of elliptic surfaces. This new method uses FIT theory, two adelic structures: the geometric additive adelic structure and the arithmetic multiplicative adelic structure and an interplay between them motivated by higher class field theory. These two adelic structures have some similarity to two symmetries in inter-universal Teichm√ºller theory of Mochizuki. His contributions include his analysis of class field theories and their main generalizations. =Other contributions= In his study of infinite ramification theory, Fesenko introduced a torsion free hereditarily just infinite closed subgroup of the Nottingham group, which was named the Fesenko group. Fesenko played an active role in organizing the study of inter- universal Teichm√ºller theory of Shinichi Mochizuki. He is the author of a survey and a general article on this theory.

In 1978 he published a volume of autobiography, A Shaft of Sunlight: memories of a varied life (Deutsch, ), and in 1984 a sequel, A Thread of Silk. Career with the Indian Civil Service Mason worked for the Indian Civil Service from 1928 to 1947. He was an under- secretary in the War Department from 1933 to 1936, in that year being appointed Deputy Commissioner at Garhwal and remaining in this position until 1939. During the Second World War, he held appointments in the Defence and War Departments at Delhi (Deputy Secretary, Defence Co-ordination and War Departments 1939‚Äì42; Secretary of the Chiefs of Staff Committee, India and Head of Conference Secretary, South-East Asia Command 1942-4, Joint Secretary, War Department 1944-7), retiring in 1947 intending to take up farming.A Raj Collection, ed. Saros Cowasjee, Oxford University Press, 2005, p. 1023 Race and decolonisation With his farming efforts, even supplemented by the income from his writing, proving insufficiently remunerative for the needs of his growing family, Mason took the part-time position as the first Director of Studies of the Royal Institute of International Affairs at Chatham House, serving in this capacity from 1952 to 1958.A. Vaughan, Shakespeare's Caliban (1991) p. 160-1 Mason's role was to both undertake research and seek out scholarly work on disciplines relating to racial problems; he first went to Southern Rhodesia, at the time when it was embarking upon a union with Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland. Three volumes- The Birth of a Dilemma (1958), The Two Nations, and The Year of Decision (the second undertaken by a junior colleague, but the first and third by Mason)- resulted from this research. By 1958, his position at Chatham House translated into directorship of the independent UK Institute of Race Relations; during this time, Mason focused on Latin America, producing Patterns in Dominance (1970), the last book he wrote before retiring in 1969. Mason was strongly influenced by Octave Mannoni's use of The Tempest to illuminate the colonial situation- Prospero as imperialist- and in his own book of 1962, Prospero's Magic: Some Thoughts on Race and Colour, he extended Mannoni's symbolism to cover the Third World in general, noting how \\"in my country until a generation ago we liked Prospero...some of us are beginning not to like him\\".Quoted in A. Vaughan, Shakespeare's Caliban (1991) p. 162 Marriage and later life In retirement, Mason wrote nine more books, before encroaching blindness ended his literary endeavours (he had previously suffered temporary blindness in 1941 after a shooting accident). These works included a biography of Rudyard Kipling and two autobiographical volumes. In 1935, Mason had married (Eileen) Mary, daughter of Courtenay Hayes, of Charmouth, Dorset and niece of senior Indian Army officer Major- General William Twiss.

He served as a crown stallion in L√§ngelm√§ki through 1873-1874. The crown stallion system () was an early state-initiated horse breeding programme in Finland. Its aim was to improve the Finnish horse population by providing state-owned stallions for public use. It was later replaced with the Finnhorse studbook, founded in 1907.  Motive and development  The great famine of 1866-1868 had a devastating effect on the Finnish horse population. Many breeders were compelled to sell their best stallions to Russia for money as a desperate measure,Ote Kirsi Peltosen opinn√§ytety√∂st√§ ‚ÄùVaellusratsu‚Äù 2004 (An excerpt of Kirsi Peltonen's thesis \\"Trail riding steed\\" 2004), accessed 2011-01-15 and large numbers of horses were slaughtered for food. To make up for the loss of valuable breeding animals, and to aid the rebuilding of the horse population, the Senate of Finland sent orders in 1869 to the provinces of Vaasa, H√§me and Kuopio, ordering them to obtain suitable stallions to be publicly owned and made available to local residents for breeding to privately owned mares.Ojala, Ilmari 1995: Suomenhevonen - Ruununorij√§rjestelm√§, page 54 Later, funding was appropriated for this purpose, and with it came generalized instructions for eight provinces to each obtain four stallions. Still later, Finland was subdivided into one hundred breeding districts (), and each district was to have one state stallion. However, most years, some breeding districts lacked a stallion due to the scarcity of good quality horses. The stallions purchased and used in this programme were called \\"crown stallions\\" (), at first informally, but eventually as an official designation. The abbreviation \\"ro\\" became part of the name of each crown stallion; animals were further distinguished by their breeding districts; for example, the stallion Poke who stood at Urjala was officially \\"Poke ro Urjala\\", and his son, also named Poke, but who stood in a different district, was \\"Poke ro Ylih√§rm√§\\".  Selection  Official instructions were never given about the size, workability, or even bloodlines of crown stallions, and the only common aim in horse breeding was to increase height and weight. Before the turn of the 20th century, public discussion had not reached consensus on what was wanted from the breeding of Finnish horses. Only one thing was agreed on: Finland needed working horses. This led to great diversity in phenotype prior to the establishment of the Finnhorse stud book. Originally, stallions were selected by committees consisting of both local people and state officials such as agronomists, veterinarians, military officers, or farm owners. In 1893, the job switched over to the newly created civil service position of the horse husbandry director ). The first to hold this post was the agronomist and farm owner Ernst Fabritius.Ojala, Ilmari 1995: Suomenhevonen - Ruununorij√§rjestelm√§, page 55  Leasing  Crown stallions were leased to private individuals for caretaking, often determined by holding a public auction where the winner was the person who agreed to take the stallion for the smallest amount of compensation. Care of a crown stallion was to some degree a burden: the caretaker had a heavy responsibility because the horse was the state's property. Caretakers had to accept an obligation to have at least one person available to care for the horse and keep the stallion available to the public for servicing mares during the breeding season, even though it was also the time when every available hand was needed for spring fieldwork. However, the task was also highly desired in spite of the burdens because the caretaker was allowed to keep all stud fees, and, after the stallion sired 60 live foals, the caretaker could obtain ownership of the animal itself. In the case of less popular stallions who sired few foals, a caretaker could keep the animal after six years of service. Problems arose from the fact that the terms and conditions of the caretaking system often allowed the change in ownership far too soon‚Äîa number of the most popular stallions managed to achieve the required 60 foals in a year.Ojala, Ilmari 1995: Suomenhevonen - Ruununorij√§rjestelm√§, pages 54-55 While the government could attempt to renew the contract, by the time a stallion's value in breeding had been proved, the horse often had already been taken into private ownership and was no longer available to the public. However, in spite of its shortcomings, the crown stallion system allowed enlightened farmers to have control of the direction needed for the breeding of good working horses. The crown stallion system was made obsolete and discontinued by the time the Finnhorse studbook was founded in 1907, and official regulations for accepting breeding animals were set.

Hextall quickly saw the possibility of developing his ranch into a garden suburb for the wealthy who would be able to live in country homes along the banks of the river in close proximity to the city. He subdivided part of his land, built a bridge, and got the City of Calgary to run its streetcar line across the bridge into his development, which he called Bowness Estates. In return, he donated two islands on the Bow to the City, for use as a park. Despite an aggressive advertising campaign, and many improvements to the property, including a golf club, Bowness Estates never took off. First there was a slump in the economy, then the first world war broke out. Hextall died on April 19, 1914 and is buried in the Union Cemetery in Calgary. The area he had subdivided eventually became the village, then the town of Bowness, which grew rapidly after the second world war and was annexed by the City of Calgary in 1963. The bridge he built in 1911 still stands. Used now for pedestrian and bicycle traffic it was officially named the John Hextall Bridge in 1986.

It crosses portions of Lubbock, Crosby, Garza, and Kent counties in West Texas. The flowing waters of the North Fork carved Yellow House Canyon, one of three major canyons along the east side of the Llano Estacado. Proper name In the past, this tributary of the Brazos has been called by various names, including Yellowhouse Creek and Yellow House River. According to a 1964 decision by the United States Board on Geographical Names, this stream is properly called the North Fork Double Mountain Fork Brazos River. However, due to the unwieldy length of the name, it is often shortened to just North Fork. Geography Within the city limits of Lubbock, the North Fork is a minor stream that flows through a narrow and shallow channel with a typical width less than and a typical depth not more than . Here the city of Lubbock has constructed a series of small dams that form a series of narrow lakes, collectively known as Canyon Lakes. As the North Fork extends outside the city limits, Yellow House Canyon gradually widens and deepens. At a distance of to the east-southeast of Lubbock, a dam was constructed to form Buffalo Springs Lake, a recreational lake that now inundates the site of the main springs, though Buffalo Springs continue to flow beneath the waters of the lake. Immediately downstream of Buffalo Springs Lake is a smaller dam that forms another recreational lake named Lake Ransom Canyon, where numerous single-family homes surround the lake to form the community of Ransom Canyon, Texas. Downstream of Ransom Canyon, the North Fork flows freely across sparsely populated ranch country as the canyon continues to deepen and widen. Where the North Fork crosses Farm to Market Road 400, a large portion of Lubbock's treated sewage is pumped into the stream via a pipeline that empties at a point called Outfall 001. The City of Lubbock is permitted to discharge as much as of treated effluent into the North Fork each day. At the point where the North Fork crosses Lubbock County Road 3600, the canyon is nearly wide and deep. Further downstream, the walls of the canyon begin to curve sharply outward as the North Fork flows out of Yellow House Canyon and onto the rolling plains of West Texas. To the east of Slaton, the North Fork enters Crosby County, passing to the southwest of Courthouse Mountain and the ghost town of Canyon Valley. After traversing only across the southwest corner of Crosby County, the stream then enters northern Garza County, where it continues to run southeastward, eventually crossing Texas State Highway 207. Passing to the northeast of Post, the stream crosses Farm to Market Road 651 and then U.S. Highway 380, about east of Post. The stream then begins trending in a more easterly direction as it meanders wildly, eventually crossing from Garza into Kent County, where it merges with the Double Mountain Fork. Overall, the North Fork descends from its headwaters to its confluence with the Double Mountain Fork, passing through flat to moderately steep terrain along its course. Proposed Post Reservoir The City of Lubbock has proposed the construction of a major reservoir that would impound waters of the North Fork northeast of Post, creating a reservoir roughly 60% of the size of Lake Alan Henry, another city reservoir that impounds waters of the Double Mountain Fork. The proposed Post Reservoir is a key feature in the 2012 State Water Plan for the Llano Estacado Regional Water Planning Area, which encompasses 21 counties on the high plains of the Llano Estacado. The construction of this controversial reservoir would likely lead to the extinction of two rare species of prairie fish - the smalleye shiner and the sharpnose shiner.

The station was notable for its use of the Haitian Creole language, spoken by most Haitians, while most other media broadcast in French, and also for its broadcasting of international and local news. History The station was founded as Radio Haiti and was broadcast on both AM and FM and later renamed to Radio Haiti-Inter. Jean Dominique, who started working at the station as a reporter, bought the lease to the station in 1968. The station was the target of various attacks by oppressive government regimes throughout its history, due to the democratic and anti-corruption stance of Dominique. In 1980 the Haitian regime closed the station and arrested some station journalists, and Dominique was forced into exile. The station resumed its activity in 1986 after the fall of Jean-Claude Duvalier, but closed again in 1991 after the coup d'√©tat against Jean-Bertrand Aristide. The station reopened in 1994 after Aristide's return. Jean Dominique was assassinated on April 3, 2000, upon attempting to enter the station. A station employee Jean-Claude Louissaint was also killed in the attack. The station continued to broadcast for 3 years after Dominique's death, helmed by his wife Mich√®le Montas. Radio Haiti-Inter ended broadcasting in 2003, due to threats against Montas and other employees. The station and the story of its founder was documented in Jonathan Demme's film The Agronomist.

They are also known as imino ethers, since they resemble imines (>C=N-) with an oxygen atom connected to the carbon atom. Synthesis Imidates may be generated by a number of synthetic routes, but are in general formed by the Pinner reaction. This proceeds via the acid catalyzed attack of nitriles by alcohols. General mechanism of the Pinner reactionB. P. Mundy, M. G. Ellerd, F. G. Favaloro: Name Reactions and Reagents in organic Synthesis, 2. Auflage, Wiley-Interscience, Hoboken, NJ 2005, , S. 516. Imidates produced in this manner are formed as their hydrochloride salts, which are sometimes referred to as Pinner salts. Carboximidates are also formed as intermediates in the Mumm rearrangement and the Overman rearrangement. Imidate/amidate anions An amidate/imidate anion is formed upon deprotonation of an amide or imidic acid. Since amides and imidic acids are tautomers, they form the same anion upon deprotonation. The two names are thus synonyms describing the same anion, although arguably, imidate refers to the resonance contributor on the left, while amidate refers to the resonance contributor on the right. However, they are distinguished when they act as ligands for transition metals, with O-bound species referred to as imidates and N-bound species referred to as amidates. They can be considered aza-substituted analogues of enolates with the formula R-N=C(O‚àí)R. Imidate/amidate resonance Reactions Carboximidates are good electrophiles and undergo a range of addition reactions; with aliphatic imidates generally reacting faster than aromatic imidates. They can be hydrolyzed to give esters and by an analogous process react with amines (including ammonia) to form amidines. Aliphatic imidates react with an excess of alcohol under acid catalysis to form orthoesters RC(OR)3, aromatic imidates can also be converted but far less readily. 200px =Chapman rearrangement= Named after Arthur William Chapman, who first described it, this is the thermal conversion of aryl N‚Äêarylbenzimidates to the corresponding amides. It is conceptually similar to the Newman‚ÄìKwart rearrangement. Chapman Rearrangement =As a protecting group= Benzyl trichloroethanimidate Carboximidates can act as protecting group for alcohols. For example, the base catalyzed reaction of benzyl alcohol upon trichloroacetonitrile yields a trichloroacetimidate. This species has orthogonal stability to acetate and TBS protections and may be cleaved by acid hydrolysis.

The report recommended setting up a new, centrally planned provision of care that within 20 years transformed medical services to the area. This organisation, the Highlands and Islands Medical Service was widely cited in the Cathcart ReportScottish Health Services Report (\\"Cathcart Report\\") 1935/6 Cmb 5208 and acted as a working blueprint for the NHS in Scotland. The report is written in clear language and many of its findings continue to have relevance to how medical services are planned and financed in Scotland and beyond. The report was commissioned in 1910 to overcome the difficulties of implementing the forthcoming National Insurance Act 1911 in the crofting communities. In industrial areas the working population were expected to contribute a proportion of earnings to a central fund to provide medical care when needed. In the Highlands and Islands this was seen as unworkable as the majority of the population were in crofting occupations with little or no regular income. This report was following on from others such as Coldstream's report issued by the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh in 1852 and the Napier ReportReport of the Inquiry into the Condition of Crofters and Cottars of the Highlands and Islands of Scotland 1884 Cmd. 3980 (Napier Report) that both deplored the parlous state of medical services in the area. The remit of the enquiry was settled to be \\"...the counties of Argyll, Caithness, Inverness, Ross and Cromarty, Sutherland, Orkney and Shetland and from the Highlands of Perthshire, comprising the area in which isolation, topographical and climatic difficulties, and straitened financial circumstances are found most generally in combination, and, therefore, the area generally within which the question of adequate medical provision is most pressing.\\" Collecting the evidence The Committee gathered information by questionnaires sent to 102 doctors and 158 other persons and this was followed on by direct observation by an itinerary of meetings visiting: ‚Äì Inverness, Thurso, Kirkwall, Fair Isle and Lerwick; at Lairg, Bettyhill, and Rhiconich in Sutherlandshire; at Stornoway and Garrynahine in the Isle of Lewis; at Tarbert, Harris; at Lochmaddy in North Uist; at Dunvegan and Portree in the Isle of Skye; and at Kyle of Lochalsh, Perth and Oban. They also held meetings in Edinburgh and Glasgow and reviewed available published reports and papers.

The report quotes Dr Mackenzie of Uist's evidence to the Report of the Medical Relief Committee (1904): \\"As I have frequently pointed out already, the want of sufficient medical attend and nursing have a most prejudicial effect on the well-being of the district. The loss of life, hardship and misery which this implies cannot be calculated. To a certain extent the physical evil is evident, while it tends to produce a callousness to suffering and death that becomes only too apparent in the number of uncertified deaths, especially among the aged.\\" =Exceptional treatment= In Part II the case is made for special consideration of the area. It describes an area of sparse population, wild landscape and a rudimentary road network. Many people were miles from their doctor and there are examples of the doctors putting their own safety at risk to attend sick patients. In addition the people were extremely poor with inadequate diet and the housing was seen as insanitary and overcrowded: \\"‚Ä¶houses of practically only one room, with damp walls, damp clay floors, sunless interiors, a vitiated and smoky atmosphere, and the cattle under the same roof with the human inmates, the surroundings usually badly drained, and the site often damp. When a case if phthisis occurs in one of these houses, isolation is impossible. In too many cases the patient spits on the floor of churches and meeting-houses, scattering the tubercle bacilli all round. When one considers also the probability of the cattle being affected with tuberculosis, under the conditions prevailing what else could we expect than a wide prevalence of the disease.\\" In addition the area continued to suffer from depopulation and local rates were inadequate to cover the cost of doctor's income. The newly reformed Insurance Act was of no assistance as so few of the population were in paid employment. =State of medical services= In Part III the report notes that many of the doctors had no security of tenure, had inadequate housing and inadequate income. As a result, they did not have access to appropriate transport and the telephone system was poorly developed. Doctors were unable to afford the cost of a locum so went without holidays and had no opportunity to undertake any continuing professional development. =Evidence of inadequacy of medical attendance= Perhaps the most shocking evidence related to uncertified deaths. For the County of Ross for the preceding 10 years 47.5% of all deaths were uncertified, the worst parish being Coigach where 81% of deaths were uncertified as there was no medical attendance. By contrast the rest of Scotland had a rate of uncertified deaths of 2%. There are many accounts of doctors being called too late or not at all and awareness that many of the population were unable to pay a doctors fee. This fact was reinforced by evidence from the school medical inspectors who identified illness that would have not otherwise been brought to medical attention. The population seemed instead to resort to \\"quack medicine of American manufacture\\" together with a reliance on traditional \\"cures\\" and superstitions. =Provision of nurses and hospitals= The total number of nurses was reported to be low and the organisation and distribution was chaotic. In some part contributed to by the reliance on philanthropic activities to supply nurses to some areas. Their importance to an area in attending births, following up and continuing treatment and as a source of information on personal and domestic hygiene was emphasised.  Recommendations made in the Dewar report  The report was detailed in its recommendations, namely that an imperial grant should be provided to enable a reorganisation of the medical services under a single organisation with patients paying a small fee for services and Doctors receiving a minimum salary with additional expenses for travel. It also recommended reorganisation of nursing services building of community hospitals, improvement of the telephones and provision for an ambulance service. Overtime these recommendations were undertaken by the formation of the Highlands and Islands Medical Service. thumb  Committee members  Chairman ‚Äì Sir John Dewar Secretary ‚Äì Murdoch Beaton, an Inspector under the Health Insurance Commission. Born in 1869 the son of a fisherman from Ardelve, Lochalsh, Murdoch was educated at Aberdeen Grammar School and then Aberdeen University graduating with an MA. In the Minute of Appointment of the Committee Beaton was then an Inspector under the National Health Insurance Commission (Scotland). He rose to the rank of Lt.-Colonel in the Queens Own Cameron Highlanders during World War I and then continued as a civil servant in Inverness and latterly in Edinburgh where he died in 1948 J. Cullen Greirson, Esq., Convener of the County of Zetland Andrew Lindsay, Esq., Convener of the County of Sutherland Dr Leslie MacKenzie, Medical Member, Local Government Board of Scotland Dr J. L. McVail, Deputy Chairman of the Scottish Insurance Commission. He began his professional career in 1873. He initially worked in general practice but became associated with public health when he began to assist the medical officer of health for Kilmarnock, whom he ultimately succeeded. He then became the first medical officer of health for the counties of Stirling and Dumbarton in 1891, a position he held for over twenty years. His painstaking investigations, his lucid reports, and his wisdom in counsel displayed during the period of his appointment placed him in the front rank of public health officers. His reputation as a far-sighted and impartial investigator was so well established that when, in 1907, the Royal Commission on the Poor Laws and Relief of Distress wanted to make inquiries into the methods of administering relief, Dr McVail was chosen to make those inquiries. Dr McVail's attention was turned to vaccination by the study of the mortality statistics of Kilmarnock for the years 1728 to 1764 which revealed appalling evidence of the great prevalence of smallpox among children in the eighteenth century. This led him to make an extensive study of vaccination; he collated the results in a book entitled Vaccination Vindicated, the first edition of which appeared in 1889. It was almost immediately regarded as the chief authority on the subject. His knowledge of the subject was so extensive that his evidence before the Royal Commission on Vaccination lasted twelve days. When the National Insurance Act of 1911 came into force Dr McVail was appointed Deputy Chairman of the Scottish National Insurance Commission, a position he held until, on the abolition of the Commission and the creation of the Scottish Board of Health, he became the medical officer concerned with health insurance until his retirement in 1922. It was whilst serving in this role that he was appointed a member of the Dewar committee. He was also a member of the Astor Committee on Tuberculosis. Dr A. C. Miller, Medical Officer for the Parishes of Kilmallie and Kilmonivaig ‚Äì Dr Alexander Cameron Miller (1861‚Äì1927) was born on 12th Aug 1861 ‚Äì to Allan Miller & Mary Taylor ‚Äì and raised in Fort William. He spoke Gaelic. He graduated MBCM and MD from Edinburgh. He first practised in Banff, soon moving to Fort William, Inverness-shire. He was Consultant Physician to Inverness-shire Sanatorium, Surgeon at the old Belford Hospital (1864‚Äì1965) in Fort William, and on the Highlands and Islands Consultative Council of the Scottish Board of Health. He wrote a chapter of the book Scottish Mothers and Children by W Leslie Mackenzie (1917). He was Medical Officer and Vaccinator for Ardgour and Kingairloch, Fort William Burgh and Kilmallie District, parochial Medical Officer of Health for Kilmallie, Ardgour, and Kilmonivaig, medical referee under the Workmen's Compensation and Teachers' Superannuation Acts, Missouri to the Post Office, and certifying factory surgeon. In World War I, he chaired the district medical board. He was Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh and of Soc. of Antiquaries of Scotland, justice of the peace and a freemason. He was medical superintendent at Belford Hospital for 41 years and was a former President of the Caledonian Medical Association. He died, unmarried, at Craiglinnhe, Fort William on 31st Dec 1927. Charles Orrock, Esq., Chamberlain of the Lews, on the behalf of the owners, the Mathesons Dr John L. Robertson, born in 1854, was Senior Chief Inspector of Schools for Scotland. Educated at the General Assembly School in Stornoway, and attended Edinburgh University without attending secondary school. He graduated as Master of Arts after three years and later Batchelor of Laws, joining the inspectorate of schools. In 1888 he was appointed as acting Chief Inspector of Schools, a position he later succeeded to fill. In 1912 he was given an Honorary LL.D. by Edinburgh University and in 1919 he was awarded a C.B. As well as the Dewar Committee he served on Lord Pentland's Committee for the employment of Highland boys and girls and on the Craik Commission on teachers' salaries. Sir Henry Craik, M.P. considered him to be 'a landmark in the educational history of Scotland'. When he died in Inverness, six years after his retirement from the post, his popularity was clear in the extent of the activity surrounding his funeral; when his body was returned to Lewis the flags on the island were at half mast and all businesses were closed at noon. All schools throughout Lewis were closed and 'the senior boys of Nicholson Institute headed the funeral procession, which included the Lewis Pipe Band, the Brethren of the Masonic Lodge, the Provost, Magistrates and Councillors of Stornoway and members and officials of all the other public bodies'. In addition, 'there was a very large and representative attendance of the general public, including people from all parts of the island'. Sir George Macdonald, the Secretary of the Scottish Education Department, extolled his virtues and said 'Few men in our time have laid their native country under so deep an obligation as he has done'.Noted Educationalist, Late Dr J.L. Robertson, The Scotsman, June 13, 1927, p.8.

He was previously the 12th Dean of Kimberley and rector of St Cyprian's Cathedral, Kimberley, in the Diocese of Kimberley and Kuruman in South Africa. Born in England in 1962, he went to South Africa in 2006, initially as subdean at Bloemfontein Cathedral.  Early career  Aiken qualified with a Master of Theology degree from St Andrew's University (1985) and a Certificate in Theology from Ripon College Cuddesdon, Oxford (1986-1988). He was made a deacon (1988) and ordained as a priest (1989) in the Diocese of Blackburn. Aiken served curacies, 1988-1994, at St Matthew with Holy Trinity, Burnley, and St Anne‚Äôs at St Annes-on-Sea. Subsequently he was vicar respectively at St Thomas the Apostle, Musbury, Helmshore (1994-1999), and at St Lawrence with St Paul, Longridge, north east of the city of Preston (1999-2006). An early interest in liturgy led Aiken to researching and revising the compline rite for his theological college and to subsequent engagements in devising liturgies for many contexts and occasions at parish and diocesan levels. Aiken became involved with the Royal School of Church Music both regionally and at a national level in the United Kingdom, being chaplain for the annual Easter course at Rossall School over a period of 11 years. He is himself a singer and he plays the organ and piano.  South Africa  Aiken went to South Africa in 2006 to become the subdean at the Cathedral of St Andrew and St Michael in Bloemfontein in the Diocese of the Free State ‚Äì a diocese having a link relationship with the Diocese of Blackburn. In 2009 he was invited by Archbishop Thabo Makgoba to be champion for the Anglican Church of Southern Africa‚Äôs Liturgical Transformation Task Team. As in England, Aiken was soon integrating musical endeavours with the theological and liturgical aspects of the life of the cathedral and he was instrumental in forming a new Free State branch of the Royal School of Church Music centred in Bloemfontein. He forged links between the cathedral and academic institutions in the city, formally as Anglican chaplain to the University of the Free State and the Central University of Technology, as well as through the fostering of musical connections. Aiken enrolled for a PhD at the University of the Free State, to study African liturgical music.  Kimberley Cathedral  In 2010 Aiken was invited to be Dean of Kimberley and was installed by Oswald Swartz, bishop of the Diocese of Kimberley and Kuruman at St Cyprian's Cathedral on 6 November 2010. In his first sermon as dean, Aiken quoted Archbishop William Temple to remind his listeners that \\"the Church is the only cooperative society in the world that exists for the benefit of those who are not its members.\\" He spoke of his vision to nurture a generous and welcoming spirit at the cathedral which serves not just its own parish but also the wider city of Kimberley and the diocese. Aiken has described himself as being \\"a very embryonic student of Afrikaans\\" (\\"what can I say but 'ek probeer' - I try\\") while having a more fluent command of Sesotho. His diocesan responsibilities included appointments as the Archdeacon of the Karoo (2011-2012) and as Titular Rector of St Mary's, Barkly West, as well as his role as Canon Missioner for the diocese and as Vicar General (April 2012).  Benoni  Aiken was appointed Dean of Benoni in 2014 and was instituted and installed as Dean and Rector at St Dunstan's Cathedral on 25 May 2014. Following the retirement of Bishop David Bannerman at the end of January 2015, Aiken was licensed as Vicar General of the Diocese of the Highveld.

It was established on 15 January 2011 for groups of former Anglicans in England and Wales in accordance with the apostolic constitution Anglicanorum coetibus of Pope Benedict XVI. The personal ordinariate is set up in such a way that \\"corporate reunion\\" of former Anglicans with the Catholic Church is possible while also preserving elements of a \\"distinctive Anglican patrimony\\". The ordinariate was placed under the title of Our Lady of Walsingham and under the patronage of John Henry Newman, a former Anglican himself. Church buildings Roman Catholic church buildings throughout England, Scotland and Wales are used by the ordinariate alongside the established congregations. The Church of Our Lady of the Assumption and St Gregory in Warwick Street, Soho, London, which belongs to the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Westminster, was designated for the ordinariate's exclusive use from Lent in 2013. Also in 2013, the Church of the Most Precious Blood in Borough, London was placed in the care of the ordinariate by the Archbishop of Southwark.

The use of Church of England buildings by the ordinariate requires permission from the relevant Anglican bishop; permission has been denied in at least one case. History =Background= The apostolic constitution that allows for the institution of personal ordinariates for Anglicans who join the Roman Catholic Church was released on 9 November 2009, after being announced on 20 October 2009 by Cardinal William Levada at a press conference in Rome. =Anglican responses= Some senior Church of England leaders have been reported as considering the establishment of the ordinariate to be damaging to relations between the Anglican and Roman Catholic churches. The Bishop of Lincoln, John Saxbee, said that \\"I can't judge the motives behind it [the offer], but the way it was done doesn't sit easily with all of the talk about working towards better relations\\" and that \\"Fence mending will need to be done to set conversations back on track.\\" Roman Catholic clergy who were present at an ecumenical service at Westminster Cathedral for the Week of Prayer for Christian Unity were reported as being \\"dismayed\\" by the sermon by Canon Giles Fraser, then Chancellor of St Paul's Cathedral, which included comments that the ordinariate had a \\"slightly predatory feel\\" and that \\"In corporate terms, [it is] a little like a takeover bid in some broader power play of church politics.\\" Bishop Christopher Hill, the chairman of the Church of England's Council for Christian Unity, later described the erection of the ordinariate as an \\"insensitive act\\". =Formation= In October 2010, the parochial church council of St Peter's Church in Folkestone became the first Church of England parochial group to formally begin the process of joining the Roman Catholic Church. However, St Peter's remains an Anglican church. On 8 November 2010, three serving and two retired bishops of the Church of England announced their intention to join the Roman Catholic Church. The serving bishops were provincial episcopal visitors Bishop Andrew Burnham of Ebbsfleet, Bishop Keith Newton of Richborough, and Bishop John Broadhurst of Fulham. The retired bishops were Edwin Barnes, formerly Bishop of Richborough, and David Silk, formerly Bishop of Ballarat in Australia and an honorary assistant bishop in the diocese of Exeter. The Archbishop of Canterbury, Rowan Williams, announced that he had with regret accepted the resignations of Bishops Burnham and Newton. In the following week, the Catholic Bishops' Conference of England and Wales considered the proposed ordinariate and gave assurances of a warm welcome for those who wish to be part of it. On 1 January 2011, Broadhurst, Burnham and Newton (together with their wives, apart from Burnham whose wife is Jewish), three former Anglican nuns of a convent at Walsingham and former members of 20 different Anglican parishes, were received into the Roman Catholic Church. The first personal ordinariate, the Personal Ordinariate of Our Lady of Walsingham, within the territory of the Catholic Bishops' Conference of England and Wales, was established on 15 January 2011Decree of Erection of the Personal Ordinariate of Our Lady of Walsingham with Keith Newton appointed as the first Ordinary. About half the St Peter's Parish, Folkestone (mentioned above), including their priest, were received into the ordinariate on 9 March 2011, along with 600 other Anglicans, largely from south-east England, with six groups from the Southwark diocese. The \\"ordinariate groups\\", numbering approximately 900 members, entered the ordinariate at Easter 2011, thereby becoming Roman Catholics. Initially, 61 Anglican priests were expected to be received, but some subsequently withdrew, remaining in the Church of England. John Hunwicke, who joined the ordinariate, had his reordination \\"deferred\\" owing to unspecified comments allegedly made by him on his Internet blog site, but was subsequently ordained to the Catholic presbyterate.Referenced at this news report. In 2012, Robert Mercer, a former bishop in both the Anglican Communion and the Traditional Anglican Communion, was received into the ordinariate and ordained on 27 March 2012 by Bishop Alan Hopes in the Cathedral of St John the Evangelist, Portsmouth. In 2013, the Personal Ordinariate of Our Lady of Walsingham became the first such ordinariate to have a married layman on his way to priesthood. In 2014, Monsignor Keith Newton, the ordinary, admitted that the ordinariate had not grown as much as was hoped. It had not yet aroused broad interest among Anglican clergy, who had not welcomed it. To revive interest among Anglican upholders of traditional Christian doctrine, the ordinariate's members, he suggested, should \\"communicate our message more fully and with more vigour and enthusiasm\\".\\"Leader of Anglican ordinariate admits interest has waned\\" (Catholic World News, 17 April 2014) In 2017, two former Anglicans who both worked as military chaplains (Royal Navy/Commando Royal Marines and the Army) were ordained into the priesthood in Scotland under the Personal Ordinariate of Our Lady of Walsingham.Bernadette Kehoe, \\"From Britain and Ireland,\\" THE TABLET, 23/30 December 2017, 51 In 2018, eight men were ordained into the priesthood under the Walsingham Ordinariate.\\"Latest News from the Ordinariate,\\" 18 May, 2018 =Religious= In 2010, three nuns from the Society of Saint Margaret joined the personal ordinariate. The two former SSM sisters formed the Marian Servants of the Incarnation (MSI) and hold private vows. On 12 December 2012, it was announced that 11 religious sisters from the Community of St Mary the Virgin (CSMV) intended to join the ordinariate. On 1 January 2013, the eleven sisters of the CSMV were received into the Roman Catholic Church at the Oxford Oratory of St Aloysius Gonzaga and, with a former SSM sister from Walsingham who had been one of the first members of the ordinariate, were erected as the Society of the Blessed Virgin Mary (SBVM), a new religious institute within the ordinariate following the Rule of St Benedict. =Financial difficulties= The ordinariate experienced what was described as \\"a tough first year\\". Writing in the Roman Catholic magazine The Tablet, Keith Newton said that the group was struggling financially. He expressed disappointment \\"that so many who said that they were heading in the same direction did not follow\\" and failed to join the ordinariate as expected.The Tablet, 7 July 2011 and 8 December 2011 In April 2012, Pope Benedict XVI donated $250,000 to the ordinariate to help support its clergy and work. Ordinary Monsignor Keith Newton, the former Anglican Bishop of Richborough, was ordained to the Roman Catholic priesthood and on 15 January 2011 was appointed the first ordinary. As he is married, he is not permitted to receive episcopal ordination in the Roman Catholic Church. On 17 March 2011, he was appointed by Pope Benedict XVI to the rank of protonotary apostolic (the highest rank of monsignor). Liturgical calendar The proper liturgical calendar of the ordinariate was approved by the Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments on 15 February 2012. In the main, it is identical with the current Roman Rite liturgical calendar of the dioceses of England and Wales, but it has retained some elements that form part of the Anglican patrimony. In the Proper of Time: * In place of \\"Sundays in Ordinary Time\\", it uses the expressions \\"Sundays after the Epiphany\\", \\"The Sunday called Septuagesima or the Third Sunday before Lent\\", \\"The Sunday called Sexagesima or the Second Sunday before Lent\\", \\"The Sunday called Quinquagesima or the Sunday Next before Lent\\", and \\"Sundays after Trinity\\". However, the readings at Mass are identical with those in general use in the Roman Rite. * Ember Days are observed on the Wednesday, Friday and Saturday after the First Sunday of Lent, Pentecost (Whit-Sunday), Holy Cross Day and the First Sunday of Advent. * Rogation Days are observed on the three days following the Sixth Sunday of Easter. * In the week between Pentecost and Trinity Sunday, elements of the former octave are fostered: while the readings of the Ordinary Time weekday are retained, the Mass propers and use of red as the liturgical colour \\"may sustain the themes of Pentecost\\". Regarding the Proper of Saints, the ordinariate observes the proper calendars of England and Wales, as well as the following saints: : Notation: :: (EW) - An addition or change for the Ordinariate in both England and Wales. :: (eW) - An addition or change for the Ordinariate in Wales which is already in the National Calendar of England. :: (Ew) - An addition or change for the Ordinariate in England which is already in the National Calendar of Wales.

The Friends of the Ordinariate, as it is commonly called, was also established in order to raise awareness of the ordinariate's life and mission within the wider Catholic community. The ordinary, Mgr Keith Newton, is the organisation's president. The current chairman is Nicolas Ollivant. Honorary vice presidents include Lord Deben; Matthew Festing (Prince and Grand Master of the Sovereign Military Order of Malta); Charles Moore; The Duke of Norfolk; The Countess of Oxford and Asquith; Katharine, Duchess of Kent and Lord Nicholas Windsor.

It was built in 1906 and later in 1945 converted to a museum. The museum is owned by the Istanbul Metropolitan Municipality. Building Tevfik Fikret lived in the house from 1906 until his death in 1915. The building was acquired in 1940 by the municipality from his wife Nazime with the initiative of L√ºtfi Kƒ±rdar, Mayor and Governor of Istanbul, and was converted into a museum named Museum of New Literature (). The museum opened in 1945. The museum was renamed A≈üiyan in 1961 after the remains of Tevfik Fikret, which initially were buried at the Ey√ºp Cemetery, were taken to his home's yard he liked very much due to its panoramic view of Bosporus. Tevfik Fikret designed the architectural project of the house by himself, and named his house \\"A≈üiyan\\", which means \\"nest\\" in Persian language. The house is a three-story wooden building within a garden. Museum A≈üiyan Museum, 2013 The ground floor consists of administrative offices. The first floor is reserved for Abd√ºlhak H√¢mid Tarhan (1851-1937) and female poet Nigar Hanƒ±m (1856-1918), poets of the \\"New Literature Movement\\". In two separate rooms, paintings, photographs, books and personal belongings of both poets are on display. In the second floor, Tevfik Fikret's study and bedroom are situated. Here, his personal belongings, his writing desk, armchair, drawings and paintings made by him are exhibited. In the bedroom, a death mask of him is also on display. A painting of then Ottoman Shahzada Abd√ºlmecid (1868-1944), which he created in inspiration of Tevfik Fikret's poem \\"Sis\\" (), hangs on the wall at this floor. A≈üiyan museum was restored completely, and reopened by Mayor Kadir Topba≈ü in December 2012 after one-and- half-year works costing 1.128 million (around US$640,000). By the restoration, furniture remade after original photos and a wax sculpture of Tevfik Fikret were added to the museum. Admission The museum is closed on Mondays. Visiting hours are 9:00-16:00.
