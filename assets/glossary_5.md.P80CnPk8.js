Around 1994, Chilean writer Alberto Fuguet participated in an International Writer's Workshop which took place at the University of Iowa.Hidalgo, 2007, 1 There Fuguet attempted to present a short-story to the Iowa Review for publication. As the works of Latino authors were very popular at the time, Fuguet believed his chances of getting his works translated and published were quite high.Fuguet, 1997 However, upon reading Fuguet's work, the editor was convinced that the lack of magical realist or fantastical components in the narrative made it seem as if, \\"the story could have taken place right there in [North] America.\\" Consequently, the story was rejected on the grounds that 'it was not Latin American enough'. In response to the rejection of North American editors, a short-story anthology was compiled dawning the title McOndo.Hidalgo, 2007, 2 Edited and introduced by Alberto Fuguet and Sergio G√≥mez, the anthology of new Latin American literature was first published in Spain in 1996.Fuguet, 2001, 66 The work compiled 17 short stories written by authors, all of whom were from either Latin America or Spain. All of the contributors were males who had primarily commenced their literary careers in the 1990s and all were born after the late 1950s. The contributing authors distanced themselves from the magical realism genre as they believed it did not correctly represent modern Latin America, which in the 1990s was full of \\"shopping malls, cable television, suburbs, and pollution\\". Alternately, the authors wished to focus on the erasure of nations, borders and geographical identities as a result of expanding transnational networks while exploring the effects of globalization on economy and culture. In one essay, Fuguet railed against the picturesque, exotic stereotypes that the publishing world had come to expect of Latin writers, citing well-known Cuban author-exile Reinaldo Arenas's pronouncement that the literary world expected Latin American novelists to tackle only two themes: underdevelopment and exoticism. Fuguet wrote that he does not deny that there are picturesque, colourful, or quaint aspects to Latin America, but that the world he lives in is too complicated and urban to be bound by the rules of magical realism. In the end, the primary focus of the anthology was the introduction, which was considered to be more in the vein of an essay rather than a literary work.Fuguet, 2001, 70 References Works cited  Category:1996 books Category:Spanish books Category:Latin American literature Category:Anthologies ","title":"McOndo (book)"},{"id":"27049302","text":"Salomon Zeldenrust (17 February 1884 - 20 July 1958) was a Dutch fencer.

Shover's Green is in Wealden, one of six local government districts in the English county of East Sussex, and stands on the road between the market town of Wadhurst and the village of Ticehurst in the neighbouring district of Rother. Founded by Strict Baptists from nearby Burwash in 1816, the chapel‚Äîone of three Baptist places of worship in Wadhurst parish‚Äîcontinued to serve the community until the 1970s, when it was sold for conversion to a house. Its design is similar to that of the nearby Rehoboth Chapel at Pell Green. The chapel is protected as a Grade II Listed building. History Shover's Green is on the Wadhurst‚ÄìTicehurst road about west of the latter. It is also close to Burwash, a village which had a growing congregation of Strict and Particular Baptists in the early 19th century (reflecting the prevalence of Protestant Nonconformity in the county of Sussex as a whole). In November 1815, 24 members of Providence Chapel in Burwash left to found an additional chapel at Shover's Green. Work started in March 1816, and the building was ready in 1817. A Baptist congregation had existed in Wadhurst itself since 1815‚Äîit later moved into a former Methodist chapel, and stopped meeting in the 1930s‚Äî and Rehoboth Chapel was built in a similar style to the Shover's Green church in 1824. (The chapel at Burwash, now vanished, was also associated with the founding in 1842 of Bethel Chapel at nearby Robertsbridge.) The religious census of Sussex in 1851 recorded that the chapel had 400 sittings, 100 of which were free; and attendances at morning, afternoon and evening services were given as 205, 386 and 87 respectively. The morning and afternoon services were also attended by 47 and 49 Sunday school children respectively. Describing the details of the chapel's founding in the census return, minister James Jones stated: \\"Before this chapel was erected the congregation assembled for four or five years in a building near this place, belonging to a certain person, but the building being found too small, and not belonging to this congregation, they had the present one erected\\". The chapel was renovated in 1876, when the original weatherboarding and timber framing was replaced by brickwork and tiles. As the congregation declined in the late 20th century, the building fell out of religious use, was closed in about 1973 and was converted into a house. Its registration for the solemnisation of marriages was formally cancelled by the General Register Office in March 1980. Shover's Green Baptist Chapel was designated a Grade II listed building on 12 April 1978. Architecture The chapel is a single-storey building with a regular three-bay fa√ßade. It has a slate-tiled hipped roof and timber-framed walls with brickwork and tiles in place of the original weatherboarding, still in situ at the nearby Pell Green chapel. The plain fa√ßade, facing northeast, has three equally spaced windows with round heads and wooden shutters.

Museum inner courtyard Formerly important trades, such as those of the whitesmith and the potter, were superseded during the 19th century by new industries. This generated a desire in the Fichtelgebirge region in 1907 to protect old trade skills and a museum was founded by the Fichtelgebirge Club. Since 1964 it has been located in a wing of the Sigmund Wann Hospital (Spital), founded in the 15th century and which acted as a nursing home. In the 1980s other hospital buildings were converted and the museum attached. In 2004 the last two houses were opened. In the first new building a 'Blue Dyeworks/Blue Printers', 'Children's World/Play World' and museum warehouse accessible to the public have been created. In the second new building is the museum library and workshops and offices. In a further nine houses the museum has well over 2500 m¬≤ of exhibition area. The north wing houses the Prehistoric, Geology, Mineralogy and Mining Departments. Its centrepiece is a mineral collection of about 2000 individual rocks and crystals, that come mainly from the Fichtelgebirge, the northern Upper Palatine Forest, the M√ºnchberg Gneiss Massif and the Franconian Forest. In the south wing are the Regional and Cultural History departments. Of particular note is the collection of painted furniture from the 18th and 19th centuries from the Fichtelgebirge. There is also information about the author Jean Paul (1763‚Äì1825) and the political assassin Karl Ludwig Sand (1795‚Äì1820) ‚Äì both born in Wunsiedel.  Workshops  On the ground floor of the north wing are three workshops: a smithy, a pottery and a whitesmith's to give visitors an insight into these formerly important trades. The blacksmith and whitesmith offer demonstrations on request or for special events, often e.g. at the Wunsiedler Brunnenfest. In the pottery by contrast, ceramics artist, Fred Zimmermann, makes pottery ware based on historic designs every Tuesday to Friday morning. He also runs a pottery in H√∂chst√§dt im Fichtelgebirge.

Salli Terri was nominated for Best Classical Vocal Performance. It has been reported that upon hearing her version of \\"Bachianas Brasilieras No. 5\\" from the album, composer Heitor Villa-Lobos stated that he considered it the best recorded performance of the work.

In 1990, it was released by EMI on a CD titled Duets with Spanish Guitar with six bonus tracks. In 2010, Duets with the Spanish Guitar was inducted into the Fanfare magazine Classical Recording Hall of Fame. AllMusic gave the album three stars. Fans In her memoir Simple Dreams, Linda Ronstadt wrote that her aunt, singer Luisa Espinel, was a friend of Salli Terri. \\"Knowing I wanted to sing, Aunt Luisa had sent me a recording, Duets with the Spanish Guitar, which featured guitarist Laurindo Almeida dueting alternately with flautist Martin Ruderman and soprano Salli Terri.

Duets with the Spanish Guitar is cited in the biography of poet Anne Sexton by Diane Wood Middlebrook. \\"They discovered they shared a passion for Laurindo Almeida's guitar rendition of Villa-Lobos's Bachianas Brasileiras.

It opened in 2003 built in the ruins of the Washburn \\"A\\" Mill next to Mill Ruins Park on the banks of the Mississippi River. The museum focuses on the founding and growth of Minneapolis, especially flour milling and the other industries that used hydropower from Saint Anthony Falls. The mill complex, dating from the 1870s, is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. It is part of the St. Anthony Falls Historic District and within the National Park Service's Mississippi National River and Recreation Area. Exhibits The museum features exhibits about the history of Minneapolis, flour milling machinery, a water lab and a baking lab. The centerpiece of the exhibit is the multistory Flour Tower, where visitors sit in the cab of a freight elevator and are taken to different floors of the building, each designed to look like a floor in a working flour mill. Voices of people who worked in the Washburn A Mill are heard throughout the show. Visitors exit on the 8th floor, where extant equipment is interpreted by staff, and are then led to the ninth-floor observation deck to view St. Anthony Falls. The Gold Medal Flour sign still shines at night atop the adjoining grain elevator. Across the river, the former competitor Pillsbury A-Mill is topped with a sign reading \\"Pillsbury's Best Flour.\\" =Local artists= The work of local artists is featured throughout the building. Pieces by JoAnn Verburg, Tom Maakestad, Kim Lawler, Kathleen Richert, Paul Wrench and Becky Schurmann include murals, an art glass collage, a Bisquick box, and sculpture. Mill City Live Mill City Museum began an outdoor concert series named \\"Mill City Live\\" in the summer of 2004. The concerts are held in the museum's Ruin courtyard and feature Twin Cities bands of various genres. \\"Mill City Live\\" was originally held on the first and third Thursdays of June, July, August, and September, but in 2009 and 2010 concerts were held every Thursday in July and August. As of 2016, the concerts are held every Wednesday night in August. Washburn A Mill Front of building The first Washburn A Mill, built by Cadwallader C. Washburn in 1874, was declared the largest flour mill in the world upon its completion, and contributed to the development of Minneapolis. On May 2, 1878, a spark ignited airborne flour dust within the mill, creating an explosion that demolished the Washburn A and killed 18 workers instantly. The ensuing fire resulted in the deaths of four more people, destroyed five other mills, and reduced Minneapolis's milling capacity by one third. Known as the Great Mill Disaster, the explosion made national news and served as a focal point that led to reforms in the milling industry. In order to prevent the buildup of combustible flour dust, ventilation systems and other precautionary devices were installed in mills throughout the country. By 1880 a new Washburn A Mill, designed by Austrian engineer William de la Barre, opened as the largest flour mill in the world, a designation it retained until the Pillsbury A Mill opened across the river in 1881. At the peak of the Washburn A Mill's production, it could grind over 100 boxcars of wheat into almost 2,000,000 pounds of flour per day. An ad from the 1870s advertised, \\"Forty-one Runs of Stone. Capacity, 1,200 Barrels per Day. This is the largest and most complete Mill in the United States, and has not its equal in quantity and quality of machinery for making high and uniform grades of Family Flour in this country.\\" Advertising hyperbole aside, the mill, along with the Pillsbury A Mill and other flour mills powered by St. Anthony Falls, contributed greatly to Minneapolis's development. The mill was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1983 for its technological innovations and its importance in the history of General Mills. and Washburn later teamed up with John Crosby to form the Washburn- Crosby Company, which later became General Mills. After World War I, flour production in Minneapolis began to decline as flour milling technology no longer depended on water power. Other cities, such as Buffalo, New York, became more prominent in the milling industry. Later on in the mill's lifetime, General Mills started putting more emphasis on producing cereals and baking mixes and shifted away from flour milling. The mill was shut down in 1965, along with eight other of the oldest mills operated by General Mills. In 1991 a fire nearly destroyed the old mill, but during the late 1990s, the city of Minneapolis, through the Minneapolis Community Development Agency, worked to stabilize the mill ruins. After the city had cleared the rubble and reinforced the mill's damaged walls, the Minnesota Historical Society announced plans to construct a milling museum and education center within the ruins. Construction on the museum began in March 2001. Designed by Tom Meyer, principal for the architectural firm Meyer, Scherer & Rockcastle, the museum is a new building built with the ruin walls of the 1880 Washburn A Mill. Efforts were made to retain as much of the historic fabric of the building as was possible. Many features of the Washburn A Mill were left intact, including turbine pits, railroad tracks, a train shed and two engine houses.

Background Hansen has a BA in Sociology and an MA in political theory from the University of Aalborg in Denmark. He then did development work in Orissa, India, in the mid-1980s. He became interested in anthropology during a PhD on Indian nationalism in Pune and Mumbai in western India, begun in the late 1980s when he was unexpectedly granted a research visa to study nationalism.Interview, LSE He graduated from Roskilde University and his D.Phil. was later made into a book (The Saffron Wave, 1999). Hansen taught in the multidisciplinary International Development Studies program at Roskilde University until 1999, becoming associate professor. He spent one year as a visiting scholar at the University of Natal (Durban) in 1998‚Äì99, where he also began new research. He then became a reader in social anthropology at the University of Edinburgh in late 1999, resigning to become professor of anthropology at Yale University. In 2006, he accepted a chair of religion and society at the University of Amsterdam, where he also served as dean of the International School for Humanities and Social Sciences. Since 2010 he has been the Reliance-Dhirubhai Ambani Professor in South Asian Studies and professor in anthropology at Stanford University.

They have a son and daughter. Scholarly contributions Hansen‚Äôs research in India focused initially on the rise of militant Hindu nationalism. He began a study of its local roots and organization in Pune, one of the historical strongholds of the larger Hindu nationalist movement. Later, he studied the Shiv Sena, a powerful militant movement in Mumbai that played a dominant role in the political and social life for several decades. This was in the early 1990s when violent clashes occurred between Hindu nationalists and Muslims. In the late 1990s he worked on religious identities, local political organization and informal networks in Bombay/Mumbai (Wages of Violence, 2001). In the late 1990s and again in 2007 he worked on religious revival and the everyday meanings of freedom and belonging in post-apartheid South Africa, based in a formerly Indian township in Durban (Melancholia of Freedom, 2012). More generally he has contributed to understanding of the anthropology of politics, the postcolonial state and sovereignty, and identity politics in urban environments. Hansen is part of an international research network entitled \\"The Religious Lives of Migrants,\\" funded by the Ford Foundation and the Social Science Research Council in New York, which explores religious meanings and institutions among international migrants in Kuala Lumpur, London and Johannesburg.

She was the wife of Augustus Hemenway. During the Gilded Age, it became fashionable for women to wear hats decorated with plumes. These plumes came from woodpeckers, bluebirds, owls, herons and warblers, thousands of which were killed each year. In 1896, Hemenway and her cousin Minna B. Hall held tea parties for the wealthy women of Boston where they urged them not to wear feathered hats and invited them to join a society for the protection of birds. Having gained the support of many of these fashionable women, Hemenway and Hall then organized meetings between leaders of the high society and prominent New England ornithologists, paving the way for the creation of the Massachusetts Audubon Society; over 900 women joined. Hemenway and Hall recruited William Brewster, a leading ornithologist, to be the Massachusetts Audubon Society's first president. Women played a critical role in the organization, counting for half of its officers and serving as leaders of most of the local chapters. The group used its political power to have a Massachusetts law passed in 1897 outlawing trade in wild bird feathers as well as a federal law, the 1900 Lacey Act, which prohibits the interstate shipment of animals killed in violation of local laws. The Massachusetts Audubon Society remains independent, but it helped to organize the National Association of Audubon Societies (incorporated in 1905), which later became the National Audubon Society. Hemenway was not a stranger to controversy and came from a family of abolitionists. She once invited Booker T. Washington to stay in her home, when Boston hotels refused to let him a room. In 1898, Hemenway donated $50,000 for the construction of the gymnasium at Radcliffe College. Her home is a stop on the Boston Women's Heritage Trail. Hemenway Street was named in her honor.

Art historian Jens Christian Jensen wrote about Schult: \\"I do not know another German artist who grasps his tasks so comprehensively, no one who has such a sense of feeling for that what matters in our times. In HA Schult the gap has been closed that has been for 200 years between art and the public.\\"\\"Ich kenne keinen deutschen K√ºnstler, der seine Aufgabe derma√üen umfassend begreift, keinen, der die Witterung f√ºr das besitzt, was unsere Gegenwart umtreibt.

According to Peter Weibel, \\"For decades HA Schult has managed to stimulate public awareness using images he has experienced. He stages topics in public places, which are normally edged away from the public. His art work is always directly related to the location where it is shown. He confronts the feudalism, which is manifested in gigantic triumphant buildings with the pauperism of the exploited workers who built them. He pays tribute to the unnamed soldiers and slaves and not to the heroes and sovereigns.\\"\\"Seit Jahrzehnten gelingt es HA Schult immer wieder, das √∂ffentliche Bewusstsein durch gelebte Bilder zu beleben, indem er auf √∂ffentlichen Pl√§tzen Themen inszeniert, die genau diese √ñffentlichkeit zu verdr√§ngen beliebt. Stets stellen seine Arbeiten Beziehungen her zu dem Ort, an dem sie ausgestellt sind. Dem Feudalismus, dessen Macht in gigantischen Bauwerken triumphiert, stellt er den Pauperismus der Ausgebeuteten gegen√ºber, die die Bauwerke errichteten. Nicht den Namen der Helden und Herrscher, sondern den namenlosen Soldaten und Sklaven zollt er Tribut.\\" Cited in Di√∂zesanmuseum Paderborn: Die Zeit und der M√ºll: Trash-Kunst und Konsumkritik. Peter Weibel (Graz 2006), cited in HA Schult: Art is Life. According to art historian Gail Levin (Rutgers University), Schult \\"has made a biting commentary on the indulgent aspects of western society. He calls our attention to our own conspicuous consumption, obsessively returning to the metaphor of garbage, refuse dumps, and debris. He describes his picture boxes as expressing the 'archeology of everyday life'. Indeed, his concerns are with the excesses of western culture, the rhythms of life in a throwaway society.\\" According to Mark Bradley and Kenneth Stow, \\"Schult's virtuous and political correct mission to convince the world that (...) 'we live in a time of garbage' and his argument that [his] 'social sculpture' operated as a 'mirror of ourselves' meant that his dirty exhibits-however 'out of place' they might seem-were thoroughly sanitized and legitimated, a powerful warning about what that world might become if it did not moderate its relationship with rubbish.\\"Mark Bradley, ed., Rome, Pollution and Propriety: Dirt, Disease and Hygiene in the Eternal City from Antiquity to Modernity, Cambridge University Press, 2012, p. 1.  Works  In 1969, Schult and two of his fellow artists, Ulrich Herzog and G√ºnter Sarr√©e, were arrested for covering a street in Munich with trash and paper; they referred to the event as a \\"happening\\" and dubbed it \\"Situation Schackstrasse\\".Ursula von Kardorff, \\"Kunst oder M√ºll?

Exh. cat., Leopold-Hoesch- Museum der Stadt D√ºren, 1988, p. 32. In the same year and during the early and mid-1970s, Schult produced Biokinetic Situations, exhibited at the Museum Morsbroich in Leverkusen and the documenta V in Kassel, installed either on the floors of the museums or within large vitreous display cases, also called \\"picture boxes\\".Rolf Wedewer, HA Schult: biokinetische Situationen, exh. cat., St√§dtisches Museum Morsbroich, 1969.See Christoph Stiegemann (ed.), HA Schult: Die Zeit und Der M√ºll, exhibition catalog, Di√∂zesanmuseum Paderborn, 2013, pp. 10-11, 34-35. Many of these \\"situations\\" shown in over-dimensional glass show cabinets are miniature landscapes consisting of trash, small children‚Äôs playthings and bacteria, thereby promoting the archeology of an anticipated future. For instance, in an obvious allusion to Neuschwanstein Castle, Schult created Schloss Neu-Wahnstein (1983-1987, Museum Ludwig, Cologne), \\"built on traditional assembly techniques of Dadaism.

Critical voices  In an interview in Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung on the occasion of the artist‚Äôs 70th birthday, Philip Krohn noted that art critics have described Schult's work as overly commercial and shallow, and said that he has had no new ideas in a long time. Some conservative critics in the 1960s questioned whether Schult's early works qualify as art.\\"An action like the one by HA Schult ... of course still gives the individual the liberty to accept this as art or not.\\" Peter Ludwig (1970), cited in Di√∂zesanmuseum Paderborn: Die Zeit und der M√ºll: Trash-Kunst und Konsumkritik. What was being criticized were happenings such as the \\"Situation Schackstra√üe\\" (1969),Leiss, Kunst im Konflikt (1971), pp. 467-468. but also happenings and installations such as the Biokinetic Situation in the Museum Morsbroich (1969).J√ºrgen Schilling, Aktionskunst: Identit√§t von Kunst und Leben? (1978), pp. 168-169. Others have argued that Schult's works are too bizarre for the commercial art market.  HA Schult Museum and √ñkoGlobe-Institut  In 1986, the artist founded the HA Schult Museum f√ºr Aktionskunst in Essen. In 1992, this museum was moved to Cologne.

He kept a detailed diary outlining his business dealings as well as personal information about the births and deaths of his four successive wives and his 26 children.  Life  = Career = Gregorio Dati is perhaps best known for exemplifying the late 14th-early 15th century Florentine silk merchant. Dati was a partner in numerous silk-producing firms over his lifetime, entering the industry when it was still young in Florence. The tumultuous financial situations he describes himself in his Libro Segreto are testament to risk of the industry. Typical of silk merchants, rather than rely on exporters, Dati's firm sold silks directly in Valencia, a burgeoning Mediterranean trading hub. Complicating his commercial life were piracy, bankruptcy and litigation. Dati was politically active in Florence, repeatedly serving as consul of the Silk Guild and, later in life, holding a series of public offices. In government, he served as head of the Florentine Signoria and in two bodies of government advisors. He was also Overseer of the prestigious Ospedale degli Innocenti and served in the judicial body Ten on Liberty and among the Five Defenders of the County. Gregorio Dati's writings have proven useful to historians and scholars alike due to his unique placement within Florentine society c. 1450. Dati's diary and Libro Segreto represent a major source of information on the economics and social aspects of Florence during this time. His other works include Istoria Di Firenze dal 1380-1405, a chronicle of the Milanese-Florentine wars set in a cautionary tone rather than traditional chronicle and La Sfera, a manuscript containing astronomical charts and navigational maps. The complexity and thoroughness of his public works demonstrate that he had access to an informal education that involved Classical writers. Dati's writing has been credited as a self- conscious portrayal of Florentine politics, economy and culture. Dati survived two bouts of Bubonic plague that struck his family, and would go on to outlive three of his wives and 19 of his children. Dati did not keep his diary for the last eight years of his life, and he died in 1435. Early life Gregorio Dati, also known as Goro was born April 15, 1362 to Stagio Dati (1316-1374) and Monna Ghita (d. 1414) in Florence, Italy Gene Brucker (Ed.) Julia Martines (trans.) Two Memoirs of Renaissance Florence: The Diaries of Buannaccorso Pitti and Gregorio Dati..

Their father Stagio was a silk merchant and at the age of 13, Gregorio quit school to work in the silk shop of Giovanni di Giano, the beginning of his own career as a silk merchant. Personal life =Marriages and Children= In his diary, Gregorio kept an extremely detailed account of the dates surrounding the births and deaths of his four successive wives and his 26 children. On his wives, Dati kept an exact recording of the dowry received and how he invested and spent those florins, handling his personal affairs in the same way he might handle his business affairs.Ionut Epurescu- Pascovici. \\"Gregorio Dati (1362-1435) and the Limits of Individual Agency\\". Medieval History Journal 9 no. 2 (2006) p.302. As well as exact dates, Gregorio kept a record of the godparents of each child and even in a few cases, what the weather was doing on the day of their births. Dati's first wife was Bandecca, who died in 1390 following a miscarriage in the fifth month of pregnancy. Consequently, there were no children produced from this union.Brucker and Martines 1967, p. 114 After the death of his first wife, Dati travelled to Valencia on an extended trip from 1390-1391. During his time in Valencia he fathered an illegitimate child with his Tartar slave, Margherita. He called the child Thomas, but refers to him as Maso in his diary (born December 1391).Brucker and Martines 1967, p.114. In June 1393, Dati married Isabetta (Betta) Villanuzzi after they had been betrothed for several months. According to his diary entry, her dowry of 800 gold florins that came from Betta's first cousins was soon invested in the shop of Buanccorso Berardi, another silk merchant.Brucker and Martines 1967, p. 115 Gregorio and Isabetta lived together in Florence, though Dati was often travelling to Catalonia and Valencia on business. Together, they had eight children: Bandecca (1394-1420), Stagio (1396-1400), Veronica (1397-1420), Bernardo (1398-?), Mari (1399-1400), Stagio II (1401), and Piero Antonio (1402).Brucker and Martines 1967, p. 113-115 Isabetta died from complications during childbirth in 1402. Dati married his third wife Ginevra (d. 1419) in 1404 and together they had 11 children before she died from complications during childbirth in 1419. In Gregorio's account of the specifics of each birth, he gives details on only nine. They lived in Florence but moved several times in an attempt to avoid the plague. These children included Manetto (1404-1418), Agnolo (1405), Elisabetta (1406-1414), Antonia (1407-1420), Niccolo (1411), Girolamo (1412-?), Filipo (1415-1419), Ghita (1416-?) and Lisa (1419).Brucker and Martines 1967, p. 120 Dati then went on to marry his fourth wife Caterina, daughter of Dardando di Niccolo Guicciardini and Monna Tita. They were married in March 1421, Dati at the age of 59 and Caterina, age 30.Brucker and Martines 1967, p. 125 Dati recorded that he received a dowry of 600 florins from Caterina's uncle Niccolo d‚ÄôAndrea. Caterina gave birth to six children including Ginevra (1422-1431), Antonio (1424-?), Lionardo (1425-1431), Anna (1426-?), Fillipa (1427- 1430) and Bartolomea (1431-?).Brucker and Martines 1967, pp. 125-127 Dati's family would suffer from the Bubonic Plague twice, once in 1400 and once in 1420.Brucker and Martines 1967, p. 120 In 1400, two of Dati's children, Stagio and Mari succumbed to the disease. Following that tragedy, the Dati family moved houses several times in an attempt to avoid the plague until they were infected again in 1420, this time losing several servants and three children Veronica, Bandecca and Antonia on the same day.Brucker and Martines 1967, p. 120 According to Cohn and Alfani, one quarter of all plague deaths in Italy occurred within households on the same day, so this phenomenon was not uncommon.G. Alfani and S. Cohn. \\"Households and Plague in Early Modern Italy\\" Journal of Interdisciplinary History 38 no, 2. (2007). p.188 In total, Dati fathered 26 children, seven of whom were surviving at the conclusion of his diary. Five children succumbed to plague; several died from other early childhood ailments such as being born prematurely, dysentery and the common cold Brucker and Martines 1967, p. 120, 121, 124 =Relationship with Brother= Gregorio's younger brother Fra Leonardo Dati (1365‚àí1425) was a Dominican Friar and Master General of the Dominican Order during the Great Schism.Cook 2002, p. 48 Leonardo seemed to be close to Gregorio; he was godfather to several of Gregorio's children, and Dati made a point of mentioning his brother's achievements in his diary entries. This suggests closeness between the two, as Dati never mentions any of his other 15 siblings in his writings. The two men are both associated with the authorship of the cosmographical poem La Sfera.Cook 2002, p. 45 =Death= Gregorio did not keep a diary for the last eight years of his life, and he died on September 17, 1435, from an unknown cause.Brucker and Martines 1967, p. 130 Commercial Life Gregorio Dati is best known for his career as a silk merchant, which he documents in his Libro Segreto. His mercantile life is typical of what we know about the Florentine silk trade at the time. His father worked in the wool guild and Dati followed in his footsteps for a stint in his youth,Brucker and Martines 1967, p. 108. but in the late 14th and early 15th centuries the wool industry in Florence went into a slump,Richard A. Goldthwaite. The Economy of Renaissance Florence. (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins UP, 2009), p. 108. perhaps encouraging Dati to take a different path. He may also have been enticed by the greater potential for profit in the silk industry.Goldthwaite 2009, p. 307. Dati apprenticed in a silk producing shop in 1375 at 13 years old,Brucker and Martines 1967, p. 108. when it was still a fairly new industry in Florence.Goldthwaite 2009, p. 307. He was first made partner in 1385Brucker and Martines 1967, p. 108. and later formed a number of partnerships throughout his career. Dati's partnerships often lasted less than three years Brucker and Martines 1967, pp. 108-109.Brucker and Martines 1967, p. 138. (which was shorter than the average of three-five) and were usually composed of himself and two-three other investors (which was typical). He frequently entered into partnerships with Buonaccorso Beradri from 1387‚Äì1394 and Michele di Ser Perente from 1395‚Äì1403. The exact terms of the contracts, including how long they would last, who was involved, their initial investments and their corresponding share of the profits were decided and recorded in a ledger‚ÄîDati records such contracts in his Libro Segreto.Brucker and Martines 1967, p. 109. Dati was usually a minor partner in these contracts with a smaller stake in the company, but in 1403, at 41 years old, he tells of a partnership in which the company bears his name, indicating he was the major partner.Brucker and Martines 1967, p. 120. While the silk industry had greater potential profitability, it was also riskier. At this time, merchants used the putting-out system, which meant that the silk firm owner, like Dati, would buy raw materials and have them processed by workers (e.g. weavers) for a price set by the guild. Since silk took a long time to make and spent more time on the loom, weavers would require an advance. As a result, initial investment in silk firms needed to be quite high to buy the costly raw silk and give the weavers cash advances, and it could be 3‚Äì4 months before the first silks were saleable.Goldthwaite 2009, p. 303. Thus we see Dati investing all of his money into companies and often struggles to afford the initial investments.Brucker and Martines 1967, p. 110.Brucker and Martines 1967, p. 121. He chooses his wives based their dowries;Brucker and Martines 1967, p. 121. borrows from banks, friends and his brother Leonardo;Brucker and Martines 1967, p. 120. and uses his own money in order to raise the capital necessary to have a substantial stake in the company and its profits. Overall, Dati was a successful merchant. According to the 1427 catasto (Florence's tax survey), Dati's total wealth‚Äîincluding private investments e.g. cash and silk; real estate; and public debt investment‚Äîat 64 years old was 3,368 florins. This made him far from the most wealthy citizen‚Äîthat title went to the banker Palla Strozzi with 162,906 fl‚Äîbut it did rank him 649th out of 8,475 entries, or within the top 10% of wealthy Florentines on record.Online Catasto of 1427. Florentine Renaissance Resources/STG: (Brown University, Providence, R.I., 2002). Silks were a far less standardized finished product than wool; rather, they was personalized by the merchant in the production process. Goldthwaite notes that silk merchants would often try to sell their customized fineries to princes and other nobility,Goldthwaite 2009, p. 311. which is attested to by Dati's diaries. Dati's brother and business associate, Simone, attempts to sell silk to the King of Castile,Brucker and Martines 1967, p. 139. and Dati mentions selling John XXIII, the Pisan pope supported by Florence during the Great Schism, some cloths for 150 Bologna florins.Brucker and Martines 1967, p. 120. =Spanish Trade Connections= Another implication of the high degree of personalization of silk is the silk-producers had a harder time selling to exporters in Florence, who preferred to deal in standardized woolens. As such, silk merchants often tried to sell their product abroad more directly.Goldthwaite 2009, pp. 311 This is demonstrated by Dati, who seems to have sold a lot of his product in Valencia, a bustling emporium in southern Spain that was well- populated with Florentine merchants and served as an important trading hub for the Mediterranean rim.Goldthwaite 2009, pp. 154-55. Dati's brother, Simone di Stagio Dati, lived there for 28 yearsBruker and Martines 1967, p. 136. and was well-positioned to sell Dati's products on consignment, for which Dati paid him a salary of around 60 fl.Bruker and Martines 1967, p. 109. Dati also personally travelled to Valencia, sometimes for several years at a time. He would often stop to conduct business along the way, in BarcelonaBruker and Martines 1967, p. 113.‚Äîthe main route to Western Europe‚ÄîCatalonia,Bruker and Martines 1967, p. 125.Bruker and Martines 1967, p. 112. Majorca,Bruker and Martines 1967, p. 113. and sometimes he travelled further along the Spanish coast to Murcia.Bruker and Martines 1967, p. 129. In September 1390, at 28 years old, Dati left for Valencia with his partner Bernardo, arriving on October 26. He laments that this trip would not be expensed by the business and that he did not manage to collect 4000 Barcelona pounds‚Äîa considerable sum‚Äîfrom one client, instead returning to Florence in 1392 with a notarized deed. Shipping goods between Florence and Valencia, while perhaps more profitable, carried with it a certain amount of risk from pirates and inter- state conflict. On September 10, 1393, while returning to Valencia (perhaps in another effort to collect the outstanding debt‚Äîhe mentions he wants to \\"finish up business\\") he was robbed by a Neapolitan galley and taken prisoner to Naples.Bruker and Martines 1967, p.788. He was released after being ransomed and managed to retrieve some of his goods with difficulty, but the episode was costly‚ÄîDati lost 250 fl worth of pearls, merchandise and his own clothes and 300 fl of company property.Bruker and Martines 1967, p. 110. He made it back to Florence on December 14. On April 20, 1394 Dati tried for Valencia again was successful, and staying for about 8 months and returning January 24, 1395.Bruker and Martines 1967, p. 113. However, later in 1395, his brother Simone was captured by the Neapolitan King Louis of Anjou.Bruker and Martines 1967, p. 120. He was taken to Gaeta, near Naples, and Dati's firm had to ransom him for 200 fl through Doffo Spini of the Compagnacci, a Florentine political group.Lauro Martines. Scourge and Fire: Savonarola and Renaissance Florence. (London: Jonathan Cape, 2006), p. 155. Dati left for Spain again on November 11, 1408 and set out for Florence in May 1410. However, a war between the Florentines and the combined forces of the Genoese and Neapolitans under the aggressive expansionist King Ladislaus caused him to delay in Valencia.Bruker and Martines 1967, p. 129. He finally returned to Florence in March 1411, but the delay, robberies and kidnappings speak to the volatile environment 15th century merchants operated in due to tensions between the northern Italian city-states. =Litigation= While in a partnership with Pietro Lana, he was sued twice in the Merchant's Court or Mercanzia. Dati left for Spain without repaying Antonio di Ser Bartolomeo, who then took action against Lana while Dati was away. Dati reports that Lana did a poor job of defending them and focused only on exonerating himself. Significantly, Dati notes the Lana did not even try to use their account books to defend them. It is evident that the use of account books was standard practice in the thousands of surviving Mercanzia documents today,Goldthwaite 2009, p. 304. and Lana's failure to do so left Dati bitter. Dati and Lana lost and were fined 2000 silver fl.Bruker and Martines 1967, p. 131. Lana then took Dati to the Mercanzia upon Dati's return in 1411, asking the heralds to denounce Dati as bankrupt. Dati had enough money from his trip to Spain to settle accounts and Lana lost his action, but before the dispute could be settled Lana died of plague.Bruker and Martines 1967, p. 132. Dati settled with Lana's heirs.Bruker and Martines 1967, p. 140. Political Life Dati served frequently as guild consul of the Arte di Por Santa Maria, reporting that in May 1423 he was chosen for the 8th time.Bruker and Martines 1967, p. 136. The Arte di Por Santa Maria was a conglomerate guild that originally governed Florence's retail cloth merchants, silk manufacturers, and small artisans like tailors. The guild set out regulations, product quality standards and industry definitions used in the silk trade, officially distinguishing in 1404, for instance, between the setaioli, the silk manufacturers like Dati and the setaioli a minuto, who crafted small silk items like ribbons.Goldthwaite 2009, p. 286. Toward the end of Dati's life, the Florentine silk trade had become prominent enough that the Arte di Por Santa Maria was often referred to simply as the Arte della Seta‚Äîthe Silk Guild.Goldthwaite 2009, p. 287. The guild consul took part in government and helped protect the guild through legislation‚Äîfor instance, in 1408 Florence taxed the export of silkworms and mulberry leaves (vital to silkworm husbandry).Goldthwaite 2009, p. 286.Gene A. Bruker, The Civic World of Early Renaissance Florence. (Princeton: Princeton UP, 1977), p. 14. Later in life, from 1405 onwards, Dati began to be selected to participate in Florentine communal government. Unlike, for instance, its neighbours to the south in Naples, Florence operated a communal government, in which guild members in good financial standing were selected by draw and served short terms in government offices. The Signoria was the most powerful body of government, drawing up and ratifying legislation.Bruker 1977, p. 14. The most prestigious position in the Signoria and the head of government was the Standard Bearer of Justice , which Dati held for a standard 2-month term from March 1, 1429.Bruker and Martines 1967, p. 137. Also in the Signoria and working alongside the Standard Bearer of Justice was a council of eight Priors, who voted on and decided important legislation‚ÄîDati held a position as one in 1421.Bruker and Martines 1967, p. 125.Bruker 1979, p. 215 Dati also reports serving on the two advisory councils which worked closely with the Signoria, advocating for their parts of the city and voting on important issues.Martines 2006, xiv In 1412 and again in 1430, he was chosen as one of the Sixteen Standard Bearers of the Militia, which represented each of Florence's sixteen electoral districts (Dati lived in the district of Ferza).Bruker and Martines 1967, pp. 137, 140Bruker 1979, pp. 14 In 1421 he served as one of the Twelve Good Men, which in groups of three represented each of the city's quarters‚ÄîDati represented his quarter, Santo Spirito.Bruker and Martines 1967, p. 133.Martines 2006, xiv He also served as among the Ten on Liberty in 1405, primarily settling small quarrels between citizens but also handling foreign affairs,Bruker and Martines 1967, p. 128.Martines 2006, 81 and among the Five Defenders of the Contado and District through which he advocated for peasants in his neighborhood.Bruker and Martines 1967, p. 133. He also held the position of Overseer of the Ospedale degli Innocenti,Bruker and Martines 1967, p. 133. a lavish orphanage patronized by the Arte di Por San Maria, Dati's guild.Goldthwaite 2009, p. 287. Religious Life Religious life of Gregorio Dati is well presented in his ledger which was originally written to keep transaction records of his silk business. Dati begins his book by stating that, \\"In the name of God, his Mother and all the Saints of Paradise, I shall begin this book wherein I shall set forth an account of our activities so as to have a record of then, and wherein having once more and always invoked in the name of God, I shall record the secret affairs of our company and their progress from year to year.\\"Brucker and Martines 1967, p.107 The Church from the late 14th to early 15th century in Florence was very large, following the medieval church architecture. Its frequent processions throughout the streets and its symbols and monuments that were visible everywhere - the street corner crucifix and the Virgin Mary's illuminated portrait, the small, cramped parish church and the grandiose monastic foundation - provided an active and vivid religious atmosphere in the city.Brucker 1969, p. 174 With its ubiquity and pervasiveness, the church affected the life of every Florentine substantially. As Gene Brucker argues in his book, Renaissance Florence, the church was so venerable and so deeply enmeshed in the city's history and traditions that it was one of the most conservative forces in Florentine life.Brucker 1969, p. 173 Florentines continued to grow in their faith, like Dati, despite death, plague, famine, and war striving to atone for previous sin. Considering the prevalence of Christianity in Florence, Gregorio Dati would have baptized at birth, which was the normal initiation process for Christians and the standard for Florence at his time, and continued to grow his faith for his lifetime. Throughout the ledger, Dati admits the provision of God in every aspect of his life, praying and trusting for the fortunes and blessings of God. Oftentimes, throughout the ledger, Dati praises and appreciates God for his good fortune in business, and he acknowledges God's help and guidance. When he enters new business partnership with Michele, Dati's debits were exceeding the credits and yet, he writes in his book, \\"God will grant us His grace as He has always done.\\"Brucker and Martines 1967, p. 119 When his first wife, Bandecca died on July 15, 1390 as a result of illness from miscarriage, Dati states in his book that, \\"... she peacefully returned her soul to her Creator ...\\"Brucker and Martines 1967, p. 112 Also, for his first child's death, Dati states that, \\"Our Lord God was pleased to take Himself the fruits which He has lent us, and He took first our most beloved, Stagio, our darling and blessed first- born.\\"Brucker and Martines 1967, p. 116 Those words such as \\"return,\\" \\"Creator,\\" \\"lent,\\" and \\"took,\\" Dati used to write reflects his understanding of the relationship with God as Father and Lord. As the vast majority of Florentines did, Gregorio Dati as well followed the ritual services and ceremonies in church frequently and fervently. According to the children section on his ledger, Dati states he had one boy with his first wife Bandecca, eight children with the second wife Betta, eleven children with the third wife Ginevra, and overall Dati had a total of twenty children.Brucker and Martines 1967, p. 134 And of all the children, except for ones who died on miscarriage, Dati states they were all baptized in the love of God on the following Sunday they were born.Brucker and Martines 1967, pp. 135-136 Writings =Diary= Dati's diary does not represent the diary as thought of today. Instead, Dati and merchants of his time such as Buonaccorso Pitti, kept a diary as proof of accounts.Branca, Vittor. (ed.), and Murtha Baca, (trans.), Merchant Writers of the Italian Renaissance (Marsilio Publishers, 1999), p. xxxiv. The commonly used version of Dati's diary is translated by Julia Martines, from a printed text edited Carlo Gargiolli and published in Bologna in 1865, however, Gargiolli makes no comment on which manuscript he used.Brucker and Martines 1967, p. 7. Dati's diary has several sections but its purpose was to record his investments, partners, transactions and profits.Brucker and Martines 1967, pp. 107-129. Dati includes information about his genealogy and heritage, which provided him credibility.Brucker and Martines 1967, pp. 112-141. Core Pitti (cousin of Buonaccorse Pitti destroyed family diaries and accounts causing Buonaccorso to reconstruct the family history and accounts from other people's diaries and those of his grandfather in order to reestablish the family. The diaries represent contracts, ledgers, familial history, and consequently recorded members of households that would otherwise not be known.Brucker and Martines 1967, pp. 112-141. Everything known about Gregorio Dati's personal life has been extrapolated from his diary. Dati's diary reveals social trends in Florence during the fifteenth century. Dati continually praised God for his success and failure, his wives deaths, his children's births and his political career. When his eldest son Stagio (1396-1400) died, Dati prays that Stagio will intercede on his behalf to God and the Virgin Mary.Brucker and Martines 1967, p. 126. All subsequent deaths of his children have the same wish. This was part of a popular movement that entreated all innocents to pray and that asked deceased children to intercede on their parents‚Äô behalf.Crum, Roger J. and John T. Paoletti (eds.), Renaissance Florence: A Social History (Cambridge University Press, 2006), p. 146. Dati's diary contains Accounts, Memorandums, and partnerships. The details within each section pertain to how many florin each partner invested, locations of investment, notably Valencia, and the outcome of each venture.Brucker and Martines 1967, p. 111. Dati admits several times that without monetary aid from his brother, and god's favour, several of his business ventures would have collapsed, possibly due to not having large amounts of liquid assets on hand as they were always invested.Bruckers and Martines 1967, p. 111.Bruckers and Martines 1967, p. 113.Bruckers and Martines 1967, p. 136. Dati's diary is an example of a Florentine trader who struggled in making a successful business and had a marginally more prominent civic career. He was meticulous in record keeping, demonstrated in recording each of his wives‚Äô personal accounts and when he and new partners invested in shares.Brucker and Martines 1967, p. 110-111, 120-121. Dati recorded daily life and proceedings, providing historians with an alternative perspective on Florentine politics and culture compared to other Florentine diarists and writers.Holmes, George. The Florentine Enlightenment 1400-50. (Pegasus, 1969), p. 17. =Libro Segreto= Dati's Libro Segreto was started later in his life, around 1404, in attempts to atone for what he felt as his first forty years of sin. This book is much more private than his diary and was referenced as a \\"‚Ä¶secret ledger‚Ä¶to keep our [his] partnerships affairs‚Ä¶\\"Brucker and Martines 1967, pp. 122. It was edited by Carlo Gargiolli in 1869.Brucker and Martines 1967, p. xxi. Dati recorded in vernacular Italian household accounts, private business that he conducted himself and records of penance. Dati also confesses financial disasters that result in him closing companies or losing shares. Self-prescribed penance includes not going to work on feast day, allowing people to work for him those days and striving to keep Friday nights chaste.Branca and Baca 1999, p. 127. Failure to do so pays 5-20 solidus to \\"God‚Äôs poor,\\" distributes alms, and does 20 Hail Mary's depending on the severity of the pledge broken.Branca and Baca 1999, p. 127. During Dati's civic career, he pledged never to put forth his own name or lobby for more offices other than the ones he has been deemed fit by others to occupy.Branca and Baca 1999, p. 129. Dati also refuses to occupy an office that would result in passing the death penalty on someone: his writings relating to family suggest that he struggled with death as it affected him heavily.Branca and Baca 1999, p. 126, 129. Dati followed more conservative teachings of the church, believing that one must suffer body and soul to be saved, which are reflected in his writing.Branca and Baca 1999, p. 127. Libro Segreto was created for recording transactions of partnerships separately for protection. Antonio di Segna caused Dati to review all assets when he was discovered taking more than his share, verified by Libro Segreto.Branca and Baca 1999, p. 125. Dati's private worries about being on his own in business for eight months with a chance of breaking even are revealed.Branca and Baca 1999, p. 125-126. Dati's first partnership was with men who had apprenticed him, Giovanni di Giano and his partners, in 1385. This ended in 1387 and he went on to partner with Michele, which Dati ultimately ended up owing 950 florins to a Catalonia company. He admits to being near bankruptcy several times, relying on friends and his brother to procure the funds, admitting to paying off a creditor hours before being elected standard bearer for his company.Branca and Baca 1999, pp. 15-126, 128-130. The final section of his Libro Segreto is of the horrendous partnership with Peitro Lana in 1408.Branca and Baca 1999, p. 129. The reality of daily life recorded by Dati reflects an unstable political environment: people were caught between agreeing with the papacy or the Commune of Florence itself regarding supremacy and obedience.Branca and Baca 1999, pp. ix-x. Dati's secret book reflects his ability to discern right and wrong through his criticisms of partners and government. =Istoria Di Firenze dal 1380-1405= Dati is believed to have started the Istoria around 1409, after the events it describes and is considered a reflective history rather than a chronicle.Green, Louis., Chronicle into History: An essay on the interpretation of history in Florentine fourteenth-century chronicles. (Cambridge University Press, 1972), p. 112. Hans Baron argued in 1955 that it was composed between 1407-1408, both dates making it likely that Dati wrote it abroad.Green 1972, p. 147. Dati provides a coherent representation of Florence that almost spans his life and focuses on Gian Galeazzo Visconti, Duke of Milan, and his attempted conquest of Florence.Green 1972, p. 112. The focus on the Milanese-Florentine war unified his work, allowing him to write Istoria for future guidance not relying overmuch on morality or historical examples like previous chroniclers.Green 1972, pp. 114-115. The \\"anonymous chronicle\\" of Florence wrote of the same events while they were happening, including them in a larger chronicle without much political or economic context, consequently depriving himself the opportunity to record the effects of the decisions made.Green 1972, p. 114. Dati was of a younger generation, writing after the attempted conquest, offering a simplified, single focus chronicle.Green 1972, p. 130. Dati's delivery of political and economic undercurrents in Istoria is similar to how history is taught today, through relation of undercurrents and how they affect action.Green 1972, p. 114. The humanist movement at this time is not reflected in Dati's writing style, instead maintaining scholastic style: more organic and analytical of underlying political themes, resembling medieval historians‚Äô styles in writing.Green 1972, pp. 130-131.Green 1972, pp. 113-114. Dati uses \\"fortune\\" as a participatory force when describing the conquest.Green 1972, p. 117. Dati argued fortune was predictable, acting in response to action and reaction by people and events.Green 1972, pp. 117-120. This allowed Dati to attribute an active force of human agency and that punishment would be akin to moral consequences, not divine intervention.Green 1972, pp. 117-120. He states that it was the Duke's impatience that caused his downfall because fortune ceased to favour him due to immoral actions.Green 1972, pp. 119-120. Fortune could be deduced directly from political action and reaction, it was not a wheel as described by Villani or would be by Machiavelli.Green 1972, p. 116. Fortune was actively manifested and personified in human action and reaction: the rise and fall of the Duke was because he could not see that his greed was a temptress, luring him.Green 1972, p. 117. Dati believes that the Duke's blindness was due to his obsession with obtaining Florence. Failure was due to the Duke's character, not Divine intervention; a regressive understanding of events at this point in time.Green 1972, p. 135. The description of fortune by Dati shifted beliefs that outcomes were fated by God. Instead, Dati views outcomes as fated due to the predictability of fortune but he attributes human passion as the motivating agent causing the rise and fall action of fortune.Green 1972, p. 122. Dati engendered civic pride when discussing past events and the mood of the people when confronted with an oligarchical power, believing that the government of the Commune was superior to that of Milan and fell into agreement with the papacy.Green 1972, pp. 115, 122. Dati saw the Guelphs representing liberty against the Roman Republic tradition of uniformity.Green 1972, p. 139. The community of Florence had strong foundations to remain constant in their values during upheaval.Green 1972, p. 141. Dati admitted that while the church provided stability to guide people, it was the quality of religious beliefs not quantity that should be favoured.Green 1972, pp. 138, 140. This attitude allowed Dati to examine several perspectives that shared similar underlying opinions with little bias. Finally, Dati's Istoria succeeded his contemporaries because he removed divine intervention as the central agent, replacing it with human nature.Green 1972, p. 144. =La Sfera= La Sfera is a composition of four books pertaining to the introduction of basic uses of geography, astrology and cosmology.Cook 2002, p. 49. Filiberto Segatto determined that La Sfera was written between the early fifteenth century and Dati's death in 1435 because there is a 1403 codex in the library of the University of Pavia.Cook 2002, p. 48. However, it is argued that it may have been written and unfinished at the time of Dati's death due to later copies adding more.Cook 2002, p. 49 Tolosani's 1514 copy included portions of Eastern Europe and Africa and marginal notes, currently in the Library of Laurenziana.Cook 2002, p. 49 There is a mid-fifteenth century copy at the University of Kansas, Kenneth Spencer Research Library, acquired in 1968 (Pryce MS P4). The manuscript previously belonged to Sir Thomas Phillipps, a nineteenth-century manuscript collector.Cook 2002, p. 46. There is a 1475 copy from Venice, published by Gabriele di Pietro that survives in the Library of Congress.Dati, Gregorio., and Leonardo Dati. \\"La Sfera\\". Washington D.C: Library of Congress, Rare Book and Special Collections Division, PQ4621.D17 S4 1475. Accessed February 28, 2015. http://lcweb2.loc.gov.cgi-bin/ampage. According to a study by Bertolini, of the 148 manuscripts examined, only 25 name Dati as sole contributor while 6 claim Dati and Fra Leonardo Dati as authors.Cook 2002, p. 48. Leonardo is considered Dati's only contact of philosophical thinking.Green 1972, p. 113. Leonardo had the benefit of education within the church, but Gregorio, who left his education around the age of thirteen, demonstrates he had informal education or access that continued.Cook 2002, pp. 47.Branca and Baca 1999, p. xix. A 1514 manuscript by Tolosani (the same as above), a Dominican belonging to the same monastery as Leonardo claims that Dati was the author of La Sfera.Cook 2002, p. 48. Book I contains elements of cosmology and astrology, Book II contains information on weather, tides and seasons, Book III contains details on wind, compassing, time keeping and nautical charts, and Book IV is an itinerary of important ports in the South and Eastern Mediterranean.Cook 2002, p. 49. The variety of topics discussed in the manuscript reflects interests Florentine merchants had in trade and commerce. The exclusion of the rest of the Mediterranean ports despite other sources documenting Florentine trading suggests that the manuscript was incomplete, possibly due to Gregorio's death in 1435.Cook 2002, pp. 48-49. La Sfera was written in ottava rima, a construction of stanzas of eight.Cook 2002, p. 50. As such, La Sfera is considered an important early Italian source for vernacular writing pertaining to geography, called \\"geografi metriche\\".Cook 2002, p. 50. The work would have been useful for ascertaining rough distances between ports of call and possible weather patterns but the maps and charts are inaccurate, even by contemporary standards, which were also inaccurate.Cook 2002, pp. 51-52. This suggests La Sfera was not intended as a manual but represented an encyclopedic compilation of knowledge regarding trade and navigational tools.Cook 2002, p. 52. The content of this manuscript suggests an foreign audience of middle class merchants.Cook 2002, p. 48. Bibliography *Alfani, G., and S.

It was considered that the supposed hot-spot should be responsible for the creation of the east-west trending Vit√≥ria-Trindade seamount chain, which includes the Trindade and Martim Vaz archipelago at its easternmost end. Trindade, a small island in the archipelago, is the hotspot's most recent eruptive center. This ideas was based on the geochemical data, especially of the highly silica-undersaturated alkaline ultramafic rocks of the Trindade Island and Martim Vaz Island. The isotopic data is OIB-type, which is favourable to the hot-spot hypothesis. However, the volcanic chain direction is E-W and the absolute motion vector of the South America Plate is NW. Therefore, the volcanic chain cannot be a hot-spot chain. Recent research papers, such as and , proposed that the hot mantle penetrated horizontally along the Vit√≥ria-Trindade fracture zone which is present in the lithospheric mantle. Because of the same reason, the Fernando de Noronha Volcanic chain also is not a hot-spot chain. On the other hand, the NW-SE magmatic alignments, such as the Cruzeiro do Sul Chain, Bahia Chain, and Macau- Queimado, are considered to be hot-spot chains.

History In 1878 the Fichtelgebirge Section (Sektion Fichtelgebirg) of the German and Austrian Alpine Club was founded in Wunsiedel. From the outset it focussed only on the development of the Fichtelgebirge. In 1888 the section was disbanded and the FGV founded with its headquarters in Wunsiedel. For a long time it was headed by the master forester (Forstmeister) of Wunsiedel. Over the course of time branches were formed in the surrounding villages and around the turn of the 20th century membership numbers had risen to 1000. The club enjoyed encouraging growth Aufschwung after the First World War, in 1924 it had 38 local branches with 7000 members. After the Second World War, which had brought the club's activities to a standstill, it underwent a rapid regeneration which saw the foundation of numerous youth groups. In 1936 the headquarters of the club moved to Hof; it returned to Wunsiedel in 2003/04.

It was first published by El Leon Literary Arts in 2009 (in small quantity) and re-issued (and slightly edited) as a major publication of Atlantic Monthly Press on March 23, 2010. Marlantes is a graduate of Yale University and a Rhodes Scholar. He was also a highly decorated Marine who served in Vietnam. He was awarded the Navy Cross, the Bronze Star, two Navy Commendation Medals for valor, two Purple Hearts, and ten Air Medals. He spent 30 years working on the novel, which was rejected for publication numerous times. Plot The book is set in Vietnam in 1969 and draws from the experiences of Marlantes, who commanded a Marine rifle platoon. The novel presents an unflinching look at the hardships endured by the Marines who waged the war on behalf of America. It concerns the exploits of second lieutenant Waino Mellas, a recent college graduate, and his compatriots in Bravo Company, most of whom are teenagers. \\"Matterhorn\\" is the code name for a fire-support base located at Qu·∫£ng Tr·ªã Province, on the border between Laos and the Vietnamese DMZ. At the beginning of the novel, the Marines build the base, but later they are ordered to abandon it. The latter portions of the novel detail the struggles of Bravo Company to retake the base, which fell into enemy hands after it was abandoned. Reception Matterhorn received high praise from many critics. In The New York Times Sebastian Junger called it > one of the most profound and devastating novels ever to come out of > Vietnam‚Äîor any war. Matterhorn was Amazon's \\"Book of the Month\\" for March 2010, and debuted on the New York Times bestseller list in April 2010.New York Times, Best Seller, Fiction (hardcover),  Matterhorn, April 23, 2010 accessdate=27 April 2010 It won the 2011 William E. Colby Award, was ranked #7 Fiction in Times Best Books of the Year (2010). It was one of the New York Times Notable Books of the Year (2010). It was an ALA Notable Book (2010), won the Pacific Northwest Booksellers Association Award (2011), won the Indies Choice Book Award (Adult Debut, 2011) and won the 2010 John Sargent, Sr. First Novel Prize. Background It is probable that the fictional Bravo Company 1st Battalion, 24th Marine Regiment, 5th Marine Division of the novel was Charlie Company, 1st Battalion, 4th Marine Regiment, 3rd Marine Division. The engagement at \\"Matterhorn\\" was probably the attack on \\"LZ Mack\\" Hill 484, and Hill 400 on March 1 through March 6 of 1969. With Lima Company 3rd Battalion 4th Marines in reserve (and its battalion commander, Lt. Col. Donald taking charge), two platoons from Charlie Company fought several times to reach and secure the summit, taking 15 or more casualties with at least seven killed in action; including a Canadian Marine, CPL George Victor Jmaeff, acting as platoon sergeant, who was posthumously awarded the Navy Cross.U.S. Marines In Vietnam, High Mobility And Standdown, 1969 by Charles R. Smith History And Museums Division Headquarters, U.S. Marine Corps Washington, D.C. 1988 The author, First Lieutenant Karl Marlantes, who was the Executive Officer of Charlie Company, was also awarded the Navy Cross. Hills 484 and 400 had been occupied at a cost of 20 killed in action, and many wounded, by companies of the 3rd Battalion, 4th Marine Regiment in September‚ÄìOctober 1966 and then abandoned.

She unilaterally changed records to classify mixed-race individuals as black if she found they had any black (or African) ancestry, an application of hypodescent rules, and did not notify people of her actions.Virginia R. Dom√≠nguez, White by Definition: Social Classification in Creole Louisiana, New Brunswick, NJ: Rutgers University Press, 1986 In other cases, if people would not accept her racial classification, she refused to release the requested birth or death certificate. Her insistence on changing records to classify persons of any suspected African descent was similar to the racial zealotry demonstrated by Dr. Walter Plecker, state registrar of Virginia's Vital Statistics, and a major lobbyist for its Racial Integrity Act of 1924. Early life and education Career > In 1938, in Sunseri v, Cassagne (191 La. 209, 185 So. 1 - affirmed on > rehearing in 1940, 195 La. 19, 196 So. 7) - the Louisiana Supreme Court > proclaimed traceability of African ancestry to be the only requirement for > definition of colored. Drake began with the office as deputy and eventually became director. She directed race-flagging: she would check birth certificates that bore surnames common to blacks. If the baby was listed as white, she directed workers to check the certificate against a \\"race list\\" maintained by the Vital Records Office. If the name appeared on the \\"race list,\\"\\" the Vital Records Office conducted a further study of its genealogical records to reach its own assessment of the race of the individual and family. pp. 37‚Äì38 > If the bureau determined through study of its genealogical records that the > person in question had any African ancestors, the applicant was then > informed that a certificate would be issued only if it declared the person > to be colored. If the applicant refused to accept such a certificate, the > bureau in turn refused to issue a certificate. There is evidence that > between 1960 and 1965 a minimum of 4,700 applications for certificated > copies of birth certificates and a minimum of 1,100 applications for death > certificates were held in abeyance by the bureau under the supervision of > Naomi Drake (188 So. 2nd 94) ... Among the practices Drake directed was having her workers check obituaries. They were to assess whether the obituary of a person identified as white provided clues that might help show the individual was \\"really\\" black, such as having black relatives, services at a traditionally black funeral home, or burial at a traditionally black cemetery - evidence which she would use to ensure the death certificate classified the person as black.James O'Byrne, \\"MANY FEARED NAOMI DRAKE AND POWERFUL RACIAL WHIM\\", New Orleans Times- Picayune, 16 Aug 1993, A-7 Not everyone accepted Drake's actions, and people filed thousands of court cases against the office to have racial classifications changed and to protest her withholding legal documents of vital records. This caused much embarrassment and disruption, finally causing the city to fire her.George Baca, Aisha Khan, Stephan Palmi√©, ed., Empirical Futures: Anthropologists and Historians Engage the Work of Sidney W. Mintz, Chapel Hill, NC: University of North Carolina Press, 2009, p. 159 Drake was fired in 1965.

The Security Council reiterated the importance of the peace accords and the Lusaka Protocol between Angola and UNITA. The peace process was progressing, but with delays, particularly the quartering of UNITA troops and the integration of the armed forces. Both sides had agreed to the formation of a unified armed forces in June 1996 and the establishment of a government of national unity and reconciliation between June and July 1996. In February 1997 it was expected, as provided for in Resolution 976 (1995) that UNAVEM III's mandate would be completed. The need for all parties to provide security to UNAVEM III, to respect human rights and ensure the demilitarisation of Angolan society was emphasised after the deaths of two UNAVEM III personnel on 3 April 1996. The arms embargo against the country was reaffirmed. Concern was expressed at the lack of complete quartering of UNITA's troops in accordance with Resolution 1045 (1996), and was called on to complete this, hand over weapons to UNAVEM III and release all prisoners unconditionally by June 1996. Both UNITA and the Angolan government were required to resolve all remaining issues by 15 May 1996. Additionally, they were urged to cease all hostile propaganda and to assist the United Nations in establishing an independent radio. The Secretary-General was asked to brief the Council on 17 May 1996 on whether the parties had completed the tasks set, and on 1 July 1996 to submit a progress report.

Early life Sunny Bak was born in Manhattan to Chinese-Indonesian and Korean parents. Photography career =1970s= Sunny Bak began shooting pictures in 1972 at Woodside Junior High School in Queens, New York for her school paper at the age of twelve. Her first subjects for the paper included The Supremes and the Broadway show casts of 1776 and Two Gentlemen of Verona. The school paper rejected her interview with Carly Simon on the grounds that Simon was an unknown at the time. Bak sold the interview to Aktuil, an Indonesian rock magazine, for $100‚Äîher first sale. Sunny Bak opened her first studio in 1976 on Broadway and 18th Street in Manhattan while attending City- As-School. The studio was located at 876 Broadway which was owned at the time by photographer William Biggart, the only journalist to die from the 9/11 attacks. At the same time, Sunny Bak was studying photography under Philippe Halsman at The New School for Social Research in Manhattan. =1980s= In the 1980s Sunny Bak developed a style using Polapan film photographing New York City‚Äôs downtown diva scene, including Michael Musto, Nile Rodgers, Dominique and Madonna, which got her noticed by Annie Flanders, editor in chief and founder of Details magazine. Sunny Bak worked extensively throughout the mid eighties for Details as an advertising and fashion photographer. Her music clients included the Village People, Jellybean Benitez, and Fiona. In 1984, Bak's intern from City As School, David Skilken introduced her to his former band mates from the punk rock band, The Young and the Useless who had since changed their style and their name to the Beastie Boys. The Beastie Boys became a semi permanent fixture at her studio where Bak often photographed their candid moments. Her studio became the location for their infamous ‚ÄúFight For Your Right To Party‚Äù video and she shot them numerous times on the Licensed to Ill Tour. Her images of the Beastie Boys can be seen on the albums Licensed to Ill, Solid Gold Hits, Def Jam 25, and \\"Def Jam Recordings: the First 25 Years of the Last Great Record Label\\" (Rizzoli 2011). =1990s= She lived in London in 1991 and worked as a fashion and music photographer. During this time she shot 10,000 Maniacs, Def American, Danzig, Slayer, Philippe Saisse and Engelbert Humperdinck. In 1992, Sunny Bak moved to Los Angeles.

The peak of his career spanned the 1956-to-1966 period, during which time he made a number of recordings and enjoyed a nationwide reputation as an exciting exponent of dramatic roles in the French and Italian operatic repertoires. Career Born Antonio Ponc√© Miron in Mar√≠a, Spain, he came to France with his financially strapped family in 1922 and settled in Bagn√®res-de-Bigorre. He left school at 13, did manual work and found labouring jobs but, more importantly, began singing as an amateur in 1933 in a travelling choir called Les chanteurs montagnards d'Alfred Roland. Poncet served with the French army in World War Two, was captured by the Germans and imprisoned. Following his liberation by American forces he returned to France and was awarded a military veterans' scholarship in 1947 to study voice at the Paris Conservatory. At the conservatory, he received lessons from Fernand Francell, Gabriel Dubois and Louise Vuillermoz. He won first prize in the dramatic tenor category at a singing competition held in Cannes in 1954 and embarked on a concert tour that took him to the United States, Mexico and Canada. Upon his return, he was engaged to sing at several provincial opera theatres in France (Lyon, Avignon, Toulouse and so on), but it was in Belgium that he scored his first big successes, notably at Li√®ge, Ghent and Brussels. Poncet made his debuts at both the Op√©ra-Comique and the Palais Garnier in Paris in 1957. He specialised in the demanding lead tenor roles of such 19th-century French grand operas as La Juive, Les Huguenots, La favorite, L'Africaine, Faust and H√©rodiade. In these particular works, his excitingly powerful and ringing high notes could be exhibited to great advantage. He was also admired in a number of Italian operatic works, including Il trovatore, Aida, Cavalleria rusticana and Pagliacci. His voice declined somewhat in power and his career therefore began to falter in the mid-1960s and he returned to the provincial circuit. In 1969, however, he re- emerged on the world scene, undertaking the role of Raoul in a concert version of Les Huguenots at Carnegie Hall, opposite soprano Beverly Sills; but by now his singing was in obvious decline, and the New York music critics proved hostile. His last performance occurred in Toulouse in 1974. Poncet was one of the few post-war French tenors capable of singing heroic roles in a manner at all reminiscent of the great Gallic spinto tenors and dramatic tenors of previous generations‚Äîthe likes of Gilbert-Louis Duprez, Jean-Alexandre Talazac, Agustarello Affre, L√©on Escalais, Charles Dalmor√®s, Paul Franz, C√©sar Vezzani, Georges Thill and Jos√© Luccioni (not to mention the Francophone Pole Jean de Reszke and the Francophone Belgian Fernand Ansseau). Of small stature and blessed with limited acting skills, the steely power of Poncet's voice‚Äîcoupled with his impressive upper register (which ascended to the high D in his prime)‚Äîmade up to a certain extent for his lack of stage credibility. Poncet died of cancer in Libourne, Aquitaine, at the age of 60. His voice may be heard on recordings, a few of which have been reissued on CD. His daughter, Mathilde Ponc√©, has written a biography of her father entitled Tony Poncet: Tenor de l'Opera (Editions L'Hamattan, 2009), from which some of the information included in this entry has been drawn.

S5. His career earnings totaled $21,130 in 38 starts. The horse had 9 wins, places, and shows. Burnt Cork became the first horse entered at the Kentucky Derby by an African American owner in May 1943.The Horse That Almost Ran, Sports Illustrated, May 12, 1975 As a dark horse among thoroughbreds eligible for the event, he was timed at 0:36 for 3/8 of a mile on April 6, 1943.Three Derby Stars Work At Louisville, The New York Times, April 7, 1943, pg. 32. Fulfilling a pre-race prediction of a last place finish, Burnt Cork came in 10th in a ten horse field.60,000 At Classic, The New York Times, May 2, 1943, pg. S1. Because of his last-place finish, there was some controversy about whether Anderson had entered the horse into the Derby for publicity purposes. Those who claimed this believed that the great race was marred by it. Frank B. Ward of the Youngstown Vindicator newspaper, devoted a considerable amount of space in his May 7, 1943 sports column to addressing this aspect. He pointed out that the horses of other prominent men had finished last in the past and there had been no outcry when that happened. Ward went on to say that the money for Burnt Cork's Kentucky Derby entry was Anderson's to spend, that the dream of any thoroughbred horse owner was that his or her horse might be classed as good enough to qualify for the race, and one could certainly not blame Anderson for that. Ward continued, saying that Burnt Cork met all Kentucky Derby requirements for inclusion in 1943 and that there were no complaints at all from those who had also entered their horses in the race. He finished this segment by asking what all the shouting was about. Career highlights As a 2-year-old, an $800 yearling purchase at Saratoga, Burnt Cork won the $5,000 Prairie State Stakes at Washington Park Race Track in Chicago, Illinois, on September 5, 1942.

Philosophies  =Adaptation: environment over culture= The sixties was a breakthrough decade for environmental anthropology, with functionalism and system theories prevalent throughout. The rudiments of the system theories can be seen in Marcel Mauss' Seasonal Variation of Eskimo, echoed later in Julian Steward's work.Steward JH. 1938. The Great Basin Shoshonean Indians: An Example of A Family Level Of Sociocultural Integration. Environmental Anthropology: A Historical Read. 168‚Äì180. Although later, system theories were later harshly criticized for narrowly assuming the state of societies as static. The main focus of system theories in the sixties, as conveyed by Julian Steward,Steward JH. 1955. Theory of Cultural Change: The Methodology of Multilinear Evolution. Urbana: University of Illinois Press. was acknowledgment of recurrence, cultural patterns or \\"laws.\\" Steward's ecological anthropology was based on topography, climate, and resources and their accessibility to define culture. While Marvin Harris' cultural materialism observed and gauged social units by means of material production. Both focused on culture as a malleable contingent to the environment; a social unit's characteristics (technology, politics, modes of subsistence, to name a few) have adaptive limitations. Importantly, those limitations are not considered determinants. = Diversity, history and associations = The new focus of environmental anthropology was cultural variation and diversity. Such factors like environmental disasters (floods, earthquakes, frost), migrations, cost & benefit ratio, contact/ associations, external ideas (trade/ latent capitalism boom), along with internal, independent logic and inter-connectivity's impact now were observed. Roy A. RappaportRappaport RA. 1967. Ritual Regulation Of Environmental Relations Among A New Guinea People. Ethnology. 6: 17‚Äì30. and Hawkes, Hill, and O'Connell's use of Pyke's optimal foraging theory for the latter's work are some examples of this new focus. This perspective was based on general equilibriums and criticized for not addressing the variety of responses an organisms can have, such as \\"loyalty, solidarity, friendliness, and sanctity\\" and possible \\"incentives or inhibitors\\" in relations to behavior. Rappaport, often referred to as a reductionist in his cultural studies methods, acknowledges, \\"The social unit is not always well defined\\" exhibiting another flaw in this perspective, obfuscation of aspects of analyze and designated terms. = Policy and activism: politics versus environmentalism = The contemporary perspective of environmental anthropology, and arguably at least the backdrop, if not the focus of most of the ethnographies and cultural fieldworks of today, is political ecology. Many characterize this new perspective as more informed with culture, politics and power, globalization, localized issues, and more. The focus and data interpretation is often used for arguments for/against or creation of policy, and to prevent corporate exploitation and damage of land. Often, the observer has become an active part of the struggle either directly (organizing, participation) or indirectly (articles, documentaries, books, ethnographies). Such is the case with environmental justice advocate Melissa Checker and her relationship with the people of Hyde Park. Critiques on this modern perspective and non-governmental organizations' (NGOs) influences and effects on social groups is usually that they \\"generalize\\" and \\"obscure\\" local discourse and message. Often resulting in environmentalism by bureaucrats, PR firms, governments, and industry. An example of negative effects can be ascertained in the Malaysian Rainforest, in which NGOs and other outsider activist deflected the issue, ignoring the locality of the problem.  History  = Origins and pioneers = Environmental anthropology enters the field as an applied dimension built on the primary approaches within contemporary ecological anthropology.Sponsel L. (2004, May). Ecological Anthropology. Encyclopedia of Earth. It focuses on how culture promotes connections between humans and their occupied ecosystems. American anthropologist Julian Steward (1902‚Äì1972), is the anthropological originator of cultural ecology. A troubled childhood led to Steward's fascination of the natural world. In 1918 Steward attended a California College, found inspiration from the natural environment and gained insight which promoted a future passion toward ecological studies. Steward contributions to theories of cultural ecology and cultural evolution are renowned. = Transformations = Steward officially formulated the basic theoretical and methodological framework for cultural ecology in the 1950s‚Äì60s. The transformation of cultural ecology into ecological anthropology took place in the 1960s through the 1980s by anthropologists John Bennett, Roy A. Rappaport, Andrew P. Vayda, and others. Two additional theoretical and methodological frameworks surfaced in the 1980s and 90s which attempted to cast ecological anthropology in a more scientific light. The first of which, was when Marvin Harris actively and systematically worked to develop \\"cultural materialism\\" as an approach to research. Harris's intention was to expose and analyze the ecological logic underlying multiple facets of culture. The cultural system was split into three parts by Harris; infrastructure, structure and superstructure. Eric Alden Smith and Bruce Winterhalder laid the blueprints for the second groundbreaking structure of evolutionary ecology. This would shift attention to the individual as the origin of adaptation, stressing choice when utilizing natural resources. A further expansion of ecological anthropology occurred in the 1990s when historical, political, and spiritual focused areas of research were incorporated into facets of human ecology and adaptation.  Purpose  Anthropology is a field concerned specifically with the human condition and its relation to the natural world (i.e. the capacity of a human to manipulate the world around them). This can be seen through human interactions between each other as well as the flora and fauna present in a person's particular region and how they can be utilized. Humans everywhere have changed their environment and for better or for worse, taking a step back to the previous state of things would be a long arduous process. So how can people erase the mistakes of the past? How can they bring old, outdated things new life through innovation? These questions can provide insight into the development of a subfield of anthropology called environmental anthropology. Environmental anthropology is a subfield of anthropology with roots in activism. The main focus of this particular perspective focuses on a discourse of activism. Agents operating within this sphere of thought have noticed aversive effects from human related manipulation, and are driven to try and force changes in the system which can eventually lead to replenishment of the region in question. The discipline itself if ever-changing because it must evolve to satiate the needs and appropriately address issues from the state and region level all the way down to complex communities, hence must uses a multitude of different approaches when considering a problem. According to the Society for Applied Anthropology (SfAA), > \\"Environmental anthropology is particularly effective in relating to and > gaining understanding of cultural diversity in community settings, and > intercultural/intersect oral conflict, thus lending itself to applied > endeavors that involve collaboration among diverse interest groups for the > common good.\\"The Society for Applied Anthropology (SfAA). ‚ÄúWhat is > Environmental Anthropology?‚Äù Accessed March 14, 2010. This means that a problem up stream of two separate cultural groups that affects them both can be resolved through a discourse of environmental anthropology, and although the two groups may not speak the same language, they can both activate to prompt change. Necessity can potentially quell conflict between two cultural groups if they must work together to combat an even bigger enemy (environmental injustice). Applied anthropology utilizes these understandings to work with people on a local basis as well as trying to satisfy share holders working to gain a resolution for problems related to health, education, social welfare, development and environmental protection. Environmental anthropologists use a multitude of tools and orientations to best address the variance in different problems. According to SfAA, > \\"Important among them are observation techniques, qualitative and survey > interviews, systematic data collection techniques for accessing core values > or areas of cultural consensus, ways of identifying and interpreting social > networks and a variety of participatory cultural, social and environmental > assessment techniques designed to improve intersect oral understanding of > demographic composition, social/political dynamics, cultural and other forms > of diversity, and capacity for planning and development.\\" Environmental anthropologists aim to utilize their understanding of the culture at hand in order to gain as emic (an insider's understanding of the culture in question) a perspective as possible when dealing with these situations. These type of situations are ideal within the field and sheds positive light on a field that is criticized for refusing to accept this perspective.

It is distributed widely across tropical and subtropical southeastern Asia, including Cambodia, Laos, Thailand, Vietnam, India, Sri Lanka, Nepal, and China (Tibet). It is notable for containing some of the largest living species of scorpions. Taxonomy The genus was introduced by C.G. Ehrenberg (in Hemprich & Ehrenberg, 1828), originally as a subgenus of the genus Buthus. It was elevated to genus rank by F. Karsch in 1879. H.W.C. Couzijn (1978, 1981) subdivided the genus into several subgenera, but F. Kova≈ô√≠k (2004) synonymized these subgenera with the nominal genus. =Diversity= The content of this genus may vary, depending on the authority.

Coloration is dark in most species, often uniformly brown or black, sometimes with a greenish shine, with brighter-colored telson, walking legs, and/or pedipalp pincers in some species. The scorpions are heavily built with especially powerful and globose pedipalp pionkes, broad mesosomal tergites and a proportionally slender and thin metasoma. The telson is proportionally small and the stinger is often shorter than the vesicle. The cephalothorax and mesosoma are largely devoid of carinae and granulation and the median eyes are situated in a small, lenticular depression on the cephalothorax. Some species are parthenogenic. Heterometrus bengalensis Koch (satara, maharashtra) =Toxicity= Heterometrus laoticus at Khao Yai National Park, Thailand As in other genera of the Scorpionidae, the symptoms from Heterometrus envenomations are rather mild and no human fatalities are known. The sting causes local pain, inflammation, oedema, swelling, and redness of the skin, lasting for hours to a few days. Plant extracts known in the traditional Thai medicine as natural scorpion venom antidotes are effective as symptomatic treatment of H. laoticus stings. The protein heteroscorpine-1 was found the major component of the venom in H. laoticus. Habitat for the scorpion Species of Heterometrus live in vegetated, often forested, humid regions with subtropical to tropical climates. As most scorpions, they are predominantly nocturnal and hide in burrows, below logs, and in leaf litter. In captivity Due to their impressive size, low toxicity, and docile behavior, species of Heterometrus are popular pet scorpions. Unlike many other scorpions, they can be kept in pairs or small groups. References External links * Keeping instructions for H. spinifer and H. laoticus.

He died 30 June 1964, imprisoned at Kidal. Fily Dabo Sissoko is chiefly remembered as one of the most influential political leaders of pre-independence Mali, primary conservative rival to Mali's first President Modibo Keita, and an influential writer of the Negritude movement.  Early life  Sissoko was of Khassonk√© ethnicity and he was the son of a local traditional ruler, Dabo Sissoko received his primary education at nearby Bafoulab√©, before winning a place at the elite √âcole normale sup√©rieure William Ponty in Gor√©e (Senegal). He was a teacher at the Bafoulab√© Regional school until he succeeded his father and became \\"chef de canton\\" of Niambia in 1933. Sissoko took part in French politics, supporting the Front populaire government on the 1930s and the Resistance during the Second World War. He received the M√©daille de la R√©sistance after the war.  Political career  In October 1945 he was elected deputy to the French Constitutional Assembly representing the Soudan- Niger non-citizen constituency. He was a member of the Republican and Resistance Union (URR). Sissoko was elected in a run-off, with 45.8% (1,277) of the vote. In the Constituent Assembly he joined the communist group and he was re-elected in the June and November elections of 1946. After the November 1946 election, he joined the SFIO group. Dabo Sissoko was re-elected to that seat in 1951 and 1956. He was briefly French Under Secretary of State for Industry And Commerce, a Ministerial position in the second government of Robert Schuman (5 to 11 November 1948). With Hamadoun Dicko, another former canton chief, Fily Dabo Sissoko founded in December 1945 the Parti progressiste soudanais (PSP). This was a conservative party led by African traditional rulers (including Sissoko), African officials of the French colonial administration, and the French government. The party sought gradual independence from France to preserve the influence of traditional elites. In 1957, in regional elections, the PSP was dealt its first major electoral defeat at the hands of the Union soudanaise-Rassemblement d√©mocratique africain (US/RDA) of Modibo Ke√Øta. Until the fusion of the parties on the eve of independence in 1959, Fily Dabo Sissoko vigorously opposed the socialist political program of Modibo Ke√Øta. Unsurprisingly, following Mali's 1960 independence, Modibo Ke√Øta became leader. Following riots in 1962 by some business interests opposing the creation of the Malian franc (independent of the CFA Franc used by other former colonies), Dabo Sissoko was arrested and charged with sedition. Condemned to death after being found guilty an 'attempt to destabilize the state', Dabo Sissoko had his sentence commuted to life imprisonment. Imprisoned near Kidal he died under still controversial and unclear circumstances in 1964.  Writer  Parallel to his political career, Dabo Sissoko became a well-known poet, essayist, and popular author. Associated with the Negritude movement, Dabo Sissoko helped form a Malian cultural identity, drawing from a range of ethnicities and oral literary traditions.

This capture was part of the Groot Desseyn plan of the Dutch West India Company. Although the Dutch intentions were reported to the Spanish no preventive counter-action was taken by them. Prelude On December 22, 1623, a Dutch fleet under the command of Admiral Jacob Willekens and Vice Admiral Pieter Heyn and consisting of 35 ships, sailed from Texel carrying 6,500 men.Duro p.57 13 were owned by the United Provinces, while the rest belonged to the WIC; these vessels were en route to Cape Verde,P√©rez p.233 where they arrived after being scattered by a storm. There Willekens revealed his objective, which was the capture of the city of Salvador da Bahia. The Dutch plans to invade Brazil were soon reported by Spanish spies in the Netherlands to the court of Madrid, but Count-Duke of Olivares did not give them credit.Southey p.148 On May 8 the Dutch fleet appeared off Salvador. The main objective of the expedition was the capture of the port to use it as a commercial base to ensure Dutch trade with the East Indies.Marley p.108 In addition, they would control much of the sugar production in the region, as Salvador was a major center for the substance.Fern√°ndez p.512 The Portuguese governor of Salvador, Diogo de Mendon√ßa Furtado, tried to organize the defense of the town with 3,000 men who had been hastily recruitedDuro p.47 as a mostly Portuguese militia from peasant levees and black slaves, all of them resentful of Spanish rule. The port was protected by the sea and two forts: Fort Santo Ant√≥nio in the east and Fort S√£o Filipe in the west. Additionally, a six-gun battery was erected on the beach and the streets were barricaded. Capture The Dutch fleet entered the bay divided into two squadrons. One sailed towards the beach of Santo Ant√≥nio and disembarked soldiers commanded by Colonel Johan van Dorth. The other anchored off the town and opened fire on the coastal defenses, which were quickly neutralized. At dawn the city was surrounded by more than 1,000 Dutch soldiers with two pieces of artillery. Intimidated, the Portuguese militia threw their weapons away and fled, leaving Mendon√ßa with 60 loyal soldiers. Salvador had been captured at a cost of 50 casualties among the attackers. Willekens and Heyn installed a garrison under the command of Dorth before departing on new missions, according to the orders they had received. Four ships were sent back to Holland carrying booty and news, and also instructions to call for reinforcements to secure Salvador.Duro p.48 The defenses of the city were reinforced and expanded with moats and ramparts and the garrison was soon increased to 2,500 men with numerous Portuguese slaves seduced by promises of freedom and land. Aftermath However, the Dutch garrison soon began to be harassed by the local guerrillas, led by Bishop Dom Marcos Teixeira, who had escaped inland. He managed to assemble a force of 1,400 Portuguese and 250 Indian auxiliaries.Calvo p.45Solano p.245 They built fortifications and organized ambushes against the Dutch in woodland. Dorth himself was killed in an attempt to drive off the attackers from the outskirts and morale sagged. He was replaced by Albert Schoutens, who also perished in another ambush, being replaced by his brother Willem. The Portuguese would return the next year and recapture the post.

A salary dispute between the band and Muddy Waters's manager, Scott Cameron, halted the session. Eventually the album was completed by using a couple of outtakes from 1977's Hard Again.

They pursue the apostolic purpose of the society to which they belong, while leading a life in common as brothers or sisters and striving for the perfection of charity through observing the society's constitutions.Code of Canon Law, canon 731 ¬ß 1 In some of these societies the members assume the evangelical counsels by a bond other than that of religious vows defined in their constitutions.Code of Canon Law, canon 731 ¬ß 2  Categorization  Since each and every religious institute has its own unique aim, or charism, it has to adhere to a particular way of religious living that is conducive to it, whether \\"contemplative\\", \\"enclosed\\", mendicant, or apostolic. Thus some religious institutes ‚Äì especially of nuns who are subject to \\"Papal Enclosure\\" ‚Äì strictly isolate their members from the outside world, of which the \\"grilles\\" in their parlours and churches are tangible evidence.Code of Canon Law, canon 667 Other religious institutes have apostolates that require their members to interact practically with the secular world, such as teaching, medical work, producing religious artworks and texts, designing and making vestments and writing religious instruction books, while maintaining their distinctiveness in communal living. Several founders, in view of their aim, require the members of their institute not only to profess the three Evangelical Counsels of chastity, poverty, obedience, but also to vow or promise stability or loyalty, and maybe certain disciplines, such as self-denial, fasting, silence. Religious orders are subdivided as: * monastic made up of monks (some of whom may be clerics, i.e. ordained priests) and/or nuns who are bound to live and work at their monastery and recite the Liturgy of the Hours in common * mendicant made up of friars (some of whom may be clerics) who, while living and praying in common, may have a more active apostolate, and depend on alms for their support * canons regular made up of canons (clerics) and canonesses regular, who sing the liturgy in choir and may run parish-like apostolates * clerics regular made up of priests who are also vowed religious and who usually have a more active apostolate In each instance, the term \\"regular\\" means those following a rule; either a pre-existing one such as the Rule of St. Augustine or the Rule of St Basil, etc. or one composed by the founder, which generally incorporates aspects of earlier, traditional rules such as those mentioned or the Rule of St. Benedict. =Nomenclature= Traditionally, institutes for men are referred to as the \\"First Orders\\" and those of women as the \\"Second Orders\\". Some religious orders, for example the Franciscans or the Dominicans, have \\"Third Orders\\" of associated religious members who live in community and follow a rule (called Third Order Religious or TOR), or lay members who, without living in formal community with the order, have made a private vow or promise to it, such as of perseverance in pious life, hence are not \\"religious\\", that is to say, not members of the Consecrated life (often called Third Order Secular, or TOS). In common parlance, all members of male religious institutes are often termed \\"monks\\" and those of female religious institutes \\"nuns\\", although in a more restricted sense, a monk is one who lives in a monastery under a monastic rule such as that of Saint Benedict and the term \\"nun\\" was in the 1917 Code of Canon Law officially reserved for members of a women's religious institute of solemn vows,1917 Code of Canon Law, canon 488, 7 and is sometimes applied only to those who devote themselves wholly to the contemplative life and belong to one of the enclosed religious orders living and working within the confines of a monastery and reciting the Liturgy of the Hours in community.Code of Canon Law, canon 667 Religious who are not clergy tend to be called \\"Brother\\" or \\"Sister\\", while the term \\"friar\\" properly refers to a member of a male mendicant order. Priests in vows retain their usual title of \\"Father\\", and \\"Reverend Father\\". With a few exceptions, all men in vows who are not priests and would therefore not be addressed as \\"Father\\" are addressed as \\"Brother\\". Women religious are addressed as \\"Sister\\". The 1917 Code of Canon Law reserved the term \\"nun\\" (Latin: monialis) for women religious who took solemn vows or who, while being allowed in some places to take simple vows, belonged to institutes whose vows were normally solemn.Code of Canon Law of 1917, canon 488 It used the word \\"sister\\" (Latin: soror) exclusively for members of institutes for women that it classified as \\"congregations\\"; and for \\"nuns\\" and \\"sisters\\" jointly it used the Latin word religiosae (women religious). The current Code of Canon Law has dropped those distinctions. Some women superiors are properly addressed as \\"Mother\\" or \\"Reverend Mother\\". Benedictines have traditionally used the form of address \\"Dom\\" for men and \\"Dame\\" for solemnly professed nuns. Historically, what are now called religious institutes were distinguished as either religious orders, whose members took solemn vows, or religious congregations, whose members took simple vows. Since the 1983 Code of Canon Law, only the term \\"religious institute\\" is used,Code of Canon Law, canons 607-709 while the distinction between solemn and simple vows is still maintained.Code of Canon Law, canon 1192 ¬ß2E. Caparros, M. Th√©riault, J. Thorne (editors), Code of Canon Law Annotated (Wilson & Lafleur, Montr√©al 1993 ), p. 745 Canon lawyer Nicholas Cafardi writes that, since \\"religious institute\\" is the legal term in canon law, he regards the term \\"religious order\\" as a colloquialism.Article published in Theological Exploration, vol. 2. no. 1 of Duquesne University and in Law Review of University of Toledo, vol 33  Admission and religious vows  Admittance to a religious institute is regulated not only by Church law and the religious Rule it has adopted but also by its own norms. Broadly speaking, after a lengthy period spanning postulancy, aspirancy and novitiate and whilst in \\"temporary vows\\" to test their vocation with a particular institute, candidates wishing to be admitted permanently are required to make a public profession of the Evangelical counsels of chastity, poverty and obedience by means of a vow (which may be either simple or solemn) binding in Church law. One of the effects of this vow is that members of a religious institute are no longer free to marry; and should they subsequently want to leave the institute after permanent profession, they would have to seek a papal indult of dispensation from their vow. The benefits of the profession are of a spiritual nature.cf. Dom Columba Marmion, Christ the Ideal of the Monk, ch. VI. After completion of the novitiate, members of religious institute make religious profession, which is \\"a public vow to observe the three evangelical counsels\\" of chastity, poverty and obedience. A vow is classified as public if a legitimate superior accepts it in the name of the Church, as happens when one joins a religious institute. In making their religious profession, they are \\"incorporated into the institute, with the rights and duties defined by law\\", and \\"through the ministry of the Church they are consecrated to God\\". Religious profession can be temporary or perpetual: \\"Temporary profession is to be made for the period defined by the institute's own law. This period may not be less than three years nor longer than six years.\\" Typically, members of Religious Institutes either take vows of evangelical chastity, poverty and obedience (the \\"Evangelical Counsels\\") to lead a life in imitation of Christ Jesus, or, those following the Rule of St Benedict, the vows of obedience, stability (that is, to remain with this particular community till death and not seek to move to another), and \\"conversion of life\\" which implicitly includes the counsels of chastity and evangelical poverty. Some institutes take additional vows (a \\"fourth vow\\" is typical), specifying some particular work or defining condition of their way of life (e.g., the Jesuit vow to undertake any mission upon which they are sent by the Pope; the Missionaries of Charity vow to serve always the poorest of the poor). Daily living in religious institutes is regulated by Church law as well as the particular religious rule they have adopted and their own constitutions and customaries. Their respective timetables (\\"horarium\\") allocate due time to communal prayer, private prayer, spiritual reading, work, meals, communal recreation, sleep, and fixes any hours during which stricter silence is to be observed, in accordance with their own institute's charism. The traditional distinction between simple and solemn vows no longer has any canonical effect. Solemn vows once meant those taken in what was called a religious order. \\"Today, in order to know when a vow is solemn it will be necessary to refer to the proper law of the institutes of consecrated life.\\"E. Caparros, M. Th√©riault, J. Thorne (editors), Code of Canon Law Annotated (Wilson & Lafleur, Montr√©al 1993 ), p. 745  Religious rules, constitutions and statutes  Religious institutes generally follow one of the four great religious rules: Rule of St Basil, Rule of St. Benedict, Rule of St. Augustine, and the Rule of St. Francis. The Rule of St Basil, one of the earliest rules for Christian religious life, is followed primarily by monastic communities of Byzantine tradition. Western monastics (Benedictines, Trappists, Cistercians, etc.) observe the Rule of St Benedict, a collection of precepts for what is called contemplative religious life. The Rule of St Augustine stresses self-denial, moderation, and care for those in need. Jesuits follow what is called not a Rule, but the Constitutions composed by Saint Ignatius of Loyola, which laid aside traditional practices such as chanting the liturgy in favour of greater adaptability and mobility under a more authoritarian regime.Edward A. Ryan, \\"The Jesuit Constitutions\\" in Encyclop√¶dia BritannicaJohn A. Hardon, \\"History of Religious Life: St Ignatius of Loyola and the Society of Jesus Other institutes combine a Rule with Constitutions that give more precise indications for the life of the members. Thus the Capuchin Constitutions of 1536 are added to the Rule of St. FrancisTexts at Rule and Constitutions of the Community of the Franciscan Friars of the Renewal In addition to the more fundamental provisions of the Rule or Constitutions, religious institutes have statutes that are more easily subject to change.Jason Gray, \\"Canonical Content of the Proper Law of an Institute\\"  Foundation and approval  Religious institutes normally begin as an association formed, with the consent of the diocesan bishop, for the purpose of becoming a religious institute. After time has provided proof of the rectitude, seriousness and durability of the new association, the bishop, having consulted the Holy See, may formally set it up as a religious institute under his own jurisdiction.Code of Canon Law, canon 579 Later, when it has grown in numbers, perhaps extending also into other dioceses, and further proved its worth, the Holy See may grant it formal approval, bringing it under the Holy See's responsibility, rather than that of the Bishops of the dioceses where it is present.Code of Canon Law, canon 589 For the good of such institutes and to provide for the needs of their apostolate, the Holy See may exempt them from the governance of the local Bishops, bringing them entirely under the authority of the Holy See itself or of someone else.Code of Canon Law, canon 591 In some respects, for example public liturgical practice, they always remain under the local bishop's supervision.  History  = First millennium =  Roots in Egypt and Syriac- and Greek-speaking East  From the earliest times there were probably individual hermits who lived a life in isolation in imitation of Jesus' 40 days in the desert. They have left no confirmed archaeological traces and only hints in the written record. Communities of virgins who had consecrated themselves to Christ are found at least as far back as the 2nd century.Carolyn A. Osiek, David L. Balch, The Families in the New Testament World (Westminster John Knox Press 1997 ), p. 152 There were also individual ascetics, known as the \\"devout\\", who usually lived not in the deserts but on the edge of inhabited places, still remaining in the world but practicing asceticism and striving for union with God, although extreme ascetism such as encratism was regarded as suspect by the Church. Paul of Thebes (fl. 3rd century), commemorated in the writings of St Jerome, is regarded as the first Christian hermit in Egypt, his withdrawal into the desert apparently having been prompted by the persecution of the Christians at the time. Saint Anthony was the first to leave the world to live in the desert for specifically spiritual reasons; St Athanasius speaks of him as an anchorite. In upper Egypt, sometime around 323, Saint Pachomius decided to organize his disciples into a form of community in which they lived in individual huts or rooms (cellula in Latin), but worked, ate, and worshipped in shared space. Guidelines for daily life were drawn up (a monastic 'rule'); and several monasteries were founded, nine for men and two for women. This method of monastic organization is called cenobitic or \\"community-based\\". Towards the end of his life St Pachomius was therefore not only the abbot of a monastery but also the head of a whole group of monasteries. The Greeks (e.g. St Basil the Great of Cappadocian Caesarea) and the Syriac-speaking east had their own monastic traditions (e.g. St Ephrem of Nisibis and Edessa).  Gaul  The earliest forms of monasticism in Western Europe involved figures such as Martin of Tours, who after serving in a Roman legion converted to Christianity and established a hermitage near Milan. He then moved on to Poitiers, where a community gathered around his hermitage. In 372 he was called to become Bishop of Tours, and established a monastery at Marmoutiers on the opposite bank of the Loire River. His monastery was laid out as a colony of hermits rather than as a single integrated community. John Cassian began his monastic career at a monastery in Palestine and Egypt around 385 to study monastic practice there. In Egypt he had been attracted to the isolated life of hermits, which he considered the highest form of monasticism, yet the monasteries he founded were all organized monastic communities. About 410 he established two monasteries near Marseilles, one for men, one for women. In time these attracted a total of 5,000 monks and nuns. Most significant for the future development of monasticism were Cassian's Institutes, which provided a guide for monastic life and his Conferences, a collection of spiritual reflections. Honoratus of Marseilles was a wealthy Gallo-Roman aristocrat, who after a pilgrimage to Egypt, founded the Monastery of L√©rins, on an island lying off the modern city of Cannes. L√©rins became, in time, a center of monastic culture and learning, and many later monks and bishops would pass through L√©rins in the early stages of their career.  Italy  The anonymous Rule of the Master (Regula magistri), was written somewhere south of Rome around 500. The rule adds administrative elements not found in earlier rules, defining the activities of the monastery, its officers, and their responsibilities in great detail. Benedict of Nursia was educated in Rome but soon sought the life of a hermit in a cave at Subiaco, outside the city. He then attracted followers with whom he founded the monastery of Monte Cassino around 520, between Rome and Naples. His Rule is shorter than the Master's. It became by the 9th century the standard monastic rule in Western Europe.Fred S. Kleiner, Gardner's Art Through the Ages (Cengage Learning 2009 ), vol. 1, p. 298  Ireland  The earliest Monastic settlements in Ireland emerged at the end of the 5th century. The first identifiable founder of a monastery was Saint Brigid of Kildare, who ranked with Saint Patrick as a major figure of the Irish church. The monastery at Kildare was a double monastery, with both men and women ruled by the Abbess, a pattern found in many other monastic foundations. Commonly, Irish monasteries were established by grants of land to an abbot or abbess, who came from a local noble family. The monastery became the spiritual focus of the tribe or kin group. Irish monastic rules specify a stern life of prayer and discipline in which prayer, poverty, and obedience are the central themes. However Irish monks read even secular Latin texts with an enthusiasm that their contemporaries on the continent lacked. By the end of the 7th century, Irish monastic schools were attracting students from England and from Europe. Irish monasticism spread widely, first to Scotland and Northern England, then to Gaul and Italy. Saint Columba and his followers established monasteries at Bangor, on the northeastern coast of Ireland, at Iona in Scotland, and at Lindisfarne, in Northumbria. Saint Columbanus, an abbot from a Leinster noble family, travelled to Gaul in the late 6th century with twelve companions. He and his followers spread the Irish model of monastic institutions established by noble families to the continent. A whole series of new rural monastic foundations on great rural estates under Irish influence sprang up, starting with St. Columbanus's foundations of Fontaines and Luxeuil, sponsored by the Frankish King Childebert II. After Childebert's death St. Columbanus travelled east to Metz, where Theudebert II allowed him to establish a new monastery among the semi-pagan Alemanni in what is now Switzerland. One of St. Columbanus's followers founded the monastery of St. Gall on the shores of Lake Constance, while St. Columbanus continued onward across the Alps to the kingdom of the Lombards in Italy. There King Agilulf and his wife Theodolinda granted St. Columbanus land in the mountains between Genoa and Milan, where he established the monastery of Bobbio. = Developments around 1100 = A monastic revival already begun in the 10th century with the Cluniac reform, which organized into an order with common governance the monasteries following the Benedictine Rule that chose to join it or were founded by it,Philip Hughes, A History of the Church (Sheed and Ward 1935), vol. 2, pp. 206-207 continued with the foundation in 1084 of the Carthusian monasteries, which combined the hermit life with that of the cloister, each monk having his own hermitage, coming together only for the liturgy and an occasional meal, and having no contact with the outside world, and the foundation a few years later of the Cistercians, a foundation that seemed destined to fail until in 1113 a band of 30 young men of the noblest families of Burgundy arrived, led by Bernard of Clairvaux, then 23 years old, who was to prove a dominating figure in the life of Western Europe for forty years. This was followed by the foundation in 1120 of the Canons Regular of Pr√©montr√©, not monks but clergy devoted to ascetism, study and pastoral care.Philip Hughes, A History of the Church (Sheed and Ward 1935), vol. 2, pp. 258-266 These aggregations of monasteries marked a departure from the previously existing arrangement whereby each monastery was totally independent and could decide what rule to follow. It also prepared the way for the quite different religious orders of the 13th century.Religious Orders ‚Äì Historical Development = 13th century = The 13th century saw the founding and rapid spread of the Dominicans in 1216 and the Franciscans in 1210, two of the principal mendicant orders, who supported themselves not, as the monasteries did, by rent on landed property, but by work and the charitable aid of others.Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, \\"Mendicant\\" Both these institutes had vows of poverty but, while for the Franciscans poverty was an aim in itself, the Dominicans, treating poverty as a means or instrument, were allowed to own their churches and convents.Anne Derbes, Mark Sidona, The Cambridge Companion to Giotto (Cambridge University Press 2003 ), p. 105 Similar institutes that appeared at about the same time were the Augustinians, Carmelites and Servites. While the monasteries had chosen situations in the remote countryside, these new institutes, which aimed at least as much at evangelizing others as at sanctifying their own members, had their houses in the cities and towns. = 16th century and later = By the constitution Inter cetera of 20 January 1521, Pope Leo X appointed a rule for tertiaries with simple vows. Under this rule, enclosure was optional, enabling non-enclosed followers of the rule to engage in various works of charity not allowed to enclosed religious.Arthur Vermeersch, \\"Religious Life\\" in The Catholic Encyclopedia (New York 1911), vol. 12. Accessed 18 July 2011 In 1566 and 1568, Pope Pius V rejected this class of institute, but they continued to exist and even increased in number. After at first being merely tolerated, they afterwards obtained approval, finally gaining on 8 December 1900 recognition as religious by Pope Leo XIII.Pope Leo XIII's Constitution \\"Conditae a Christo,\\" 8 December 1900 Their lives were oriented not to the ancient monastic way of life, but more to social service and to evangelization, both in Europe and in mission areas. The number of these \\"congregations\\" (not \\"orders\\") increased further in the upheavals brought by the French Revolution and subsequent Napoleonic invasions of other Catholic countries, depriving thousands of monks and nuns of the income that their communities held because of inheritances and forcing them to find a new way of living their religious life. Examples of such institutes are the Claretians, La Salle Brothers, Passionists, Redemptorists, and Vincentians. A special case happened in 1540. Ignatius of Loyola obtained authorization for the members of the Society of Jesus to be divided into professed with solemn vows and coadjutors with dispensable simple vows.Karl Rahner, Sacramentum Mundi, article \\"Religious Orders\\" The novelty was found in the nature of these simple vows, since they constituted the Jesuit coadjutors as religious in the true and proper sense of the word, with the consequent privileges and exemption of regulars, including them being a diriment impediment to matrimony, etc.Quanto fructuosius (1-2-1583) and Ascendente Domino (5-24-1584). In theory, the recognition as religious for simple vows had universal validity, but in practice, the Roman Curia considered it an exclusive privilege to the Society of Jesus.History of Religious Life, Vol. 3, Jes√∫s √Ålvarez G√≥mez, CMF, 1990 (Spanish) =Polish- Lithuanian Commonwealth= = 20th century = The 1917 Code of Canon Law reserved the name \\"religious order\\" for institutes in which the vows were solemn, and used the term \\"religious congregation\\" or simply \\"congregation\\" for those with simple vows. The members of a religious order for men were called \\"regulars\\", those belonging to a religious congregation were simply \\"religious\\", a term that applied also to regulars. For women, those with simple vows were simply \\"sisters\\", with the term \\"nun\\" reserved in canon law for those who belonged to an institute of solemn vows, even if in some localities they were allowed to take simple vows instead.1917 Code of Canon Law, canon 488 The same Code also abolished the distinction according to which solemn vows, unlike simple vows, were indissoluble. It recognized no totally indispensable religious vows and thereby abrogated for the Latin Church the special consecration that distinguished \\"orders\\" (institutes with solemn vows) from \\"congregations\\" (institutes with simple vows), while keeping some juridical distinctions between the two classes. Even these remaining juridical distinctions were abolished by the 1983 Code of Canon Law, which distinguishes solemn from simple vows but does not divide religious into categories on that basis. By then a new form of institutes of consecrated life had emerged alongside that of religious institutes: in 1947 Pope Pius XII recognized secular institutes as a form in which Christians profess the evangelical counsels of chastity, poverty and obedience while living in the world.  Life-span  In 1972, the French Jesuit Raymond Hostie published his study Vie et mort des ordres religieux: Approaches psychosociologiques (Paris. Descl√©e de Brouwer), an English translation of which appeared in 1983 as The Life and Death of Religious Orders (Washington: CARA). Hostie argued that the life of a religious institute passes through successive stages: 10‚Äì20 years of gestation, 20‚Äì40 years of consolidation, a century or so of expansion, another century or so of stabilization, 50‚Äì100 years of decline, followed by death, even if death is not officially declared until later. In this view, a religious institute lasts 250‚Äì350 years before being replaced by another religious institute with a similar life-span. Hostie recognized that there are exceptions: Benedictines, Franciscans, Dominicans, Augustinians, and some others have lasted longer, either because transformed from what they were originally or because of the prestige of their founders. In 2015, Giancarlo Rocca suggested that attention should be given not so much to the life-span of individual religious institutes, as to the duration of what Rocca called \\"religious institutions\\", corresponding to the juridical categories of monastics, canons, mendicant orders, clerks regular, priestly societies, religious congregations, secular institutes. The religious institutes that have disappeared since 1960 have mostly been congregations. This class of institutes with simple vows and a strong emphasis on apostolate arose shortly before the French Revolution. They modernized the Church, the State, and religious life itself. Older institutes adopted some of their features, especially in the fields of education and health care, areas, however, that the State has now almost entirely taken over. This suggests that the life-span of a religious institute is largely determined by the point at which it comes into being within the life cycle of the \\"religious institution\\" to which it belongs. \\"Religious institutions\\" themselves do not necessarily disappear altogether with time, but they lose importance, as happened to monasticism, which is no longer the force it was in the Middle Ages before the mendicant orders eclipsed it.Giancarlo Rocca, \\"Il ciclo della vita: Qual √® la durata di un istituto religioso?\\" in L'Osservatore Romano, 12 March 2015, p. 7] See also *Catholic religious order *Diocesan priest *List of Catholic religious institutes *Secular institute *Vocational discernment in the Catholic Church  References   External links  *List of religious institutes for men *List of religious institutes for women *Concerning 'Religious Institutes' in The Code of Canon Law 1983 *Differences Between Religious Orders A comparison of the differences between religious orders *The Congregation for Institutes of Consecrated Life and Societies of Apostolic Life * *Vocations Online directory of men's and women's Catholic religious communities in the USA *VISION Vocation Guide Digital Edition Comprehensive guide of men's and women's religious communities and vocation discernment with links and vocation opportunities *Vocation Network searchable directory of men's and women's Catholic religious communities and institutes of consecrated life Category:Organisation of Catholic religious orders ","title":"Religious institute"},{"id":"27050671","title":"O-Shen"},{"id":"27050691","text":"Joseph Jowett (1751 ‚Äì 13 November 1813) was an English Anglican cleric and jurist.

The Security Council stressed the importance of the ceasefire as part of the United Nations peace plan. Despite difficulties, there were now more than 60,000 voters identified for the referendum on self- determination. To make further progress, the Council stated that both parties had a vision for the period after the referendum. Again, the Council reaffirmed its commitment to the holding of a referendum on self-determination for the people of Western Sahara, in accordance with the Settlement Plan. It expressed regret that the parties did not want to co-operate with MINURSO to allow it to complete the identification of voters, and therefore the process was suspended. The resolution agreed with the Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali's recommendation that the military component of MINURSO be reduced by 20% as this would not affect the operational capacity of the peacekeeping force. The Security Council was satisfied that the parties complied with ceasefire and asked them to show their good will by releasing political prisoners and to accelerate the implementation of the peace plan. The proposal of the Secretary-General to maintain a political office to continue dialogue between the parties was supported. After extending the MINURSO's mandate until 30 November 1996, the Council stressed that if no progress was made between Morocco and the Polisario Front, further reductions in MINURSO would be considered. The resumption of the identification process would be supported if progress was made, however. Finally, the resolution concluded by requesting the Secretary-General to submit a report on the implementation of the current resolution by 10 November 1996.

They are a set of two charts per included geometry introduced in 1947 by M. P. HeislerTransactions ASME, 69, 227‚Äì236, 1947 which were supplemented by a third chart per geometry in 1961 by H. Gr√∂ber. Heisler charts permit evaluation of the central temperature for transient heat conduction through an infinitely long plane wall of thickness 2L, an infinitely long cylinder of radius ro, and a sphere of radius ro. Although Heisler‚ÄìGr√∂ber charts are a faster and simpler alternative to the exact solutions of these problems, there are some limitations. First, the body must be at uniform temperature initially. Additionally, the temperature of the surroundings and the convective heat transfer coefficient must remain constant and uniform. Also, there must be no heat generation from the body itself.Cengel, Yunus A. (2007). Heat and Mass Transfer: A Practical Approach (3rd edition ed.).

The position x = 0 represents the center of the slab. The first chart for the plane wall is plotted using three different variables. Plotted along the vertical axis of the chart is dimensionless temperature at the midplane, \\\\theta_o^*= \\\\frac{T(0,t)-T_\\\\infty}{T_i-T_\\\\infty}. Plotted along the horizontal axis is the Fourier number, Fo = Œ±t/L2. The curves within the graph are a selection of values for the inverse of the Biot number, where Bi = hL/k. k is the thermal conductivity of the material and h is the heat transfer coefficient.\\" Lee Ho Sung, http://www.mae.wmich.edu/faculty/Lee/me431/ch05_supp_heisler.pdf The second chart is used to determine the variation of temperature within the plane wall for different Biot numbers. The vertical axis is the ratio of a given temperature to that at the centerline \\\\frac\\\\theta{\\\\theta_o} = \\\\frac{T(x,t)-T_\\\\infty}{T(0,t)-T_\\\\infty} where the x/L curve is the position at which T is taken. The horizontal axis is the value of Bi‚àí1. Lee Ho Sung, http://www.mae.wmich.edu/faculty/Lee/me431/ch05_supp_heisler.pdf The third chart in each set was supplemented by Gr√∂ber in 1961 and this particular one shows the dimensionless heat transferred from the wall as a function of a dimensionless time variable. The vertical axis is a plot of Q/Qo, the ratio of actual heat transfer to the amount of total possible heat transfer before T = T‚àû. On the horizontal axis is the plot of (Bi2)(Fo), a dimensionless time variable.

He was also a political activist, public relations executive, and was involved in activities of the Opera Theater of Pittsburgh and Citizens for Global Solutions. Clack died in April 2019 at the age of 92.Obituary: Jerry Clark Early life The son of Mildred Taylor Van Dyke of Pittsburgh and Christopher Thrower Clack of Boydton, Virginia, Clack was born in New York City on July 22, 1926. Insofar as his father was a foreign representative of the Blaw Knox Company, a Pittsburgh firm, he spent the earliest years of his life first in London and then in D√ºsseldorf. It was there that his father died in 1931. Returning with his mother to Pittsburgh he attended Fulton School, and Peabody High School in the early 1940s. He was accepted into Princeton University in the fall of 1943 as a member of the class of 1947, but was graduated from the university in the spring of 1946. Professional career =Politics and public relations= After a brief stint in the late 1940s at the Swedish Legation in Washington, Clack joined the staff of the United States National Commission for the UNESCO. His four-year (1947‚Äì1951) participation in the work of UNESCO whetted an interest in international organizations which has remained with him throughout his life. His belief in the United Nations is best expressed by Archibald MacLeish's ringing phrase which graces the preamble to the UNESCO constitution. It is \\"a bridge of dreams over the chasms of despair.\\" His responsibilities with the organization included those of Documents Officer for the United States Delegation and the UNESCO general conferences in Florence in 1950 and Paris in 1951 and of Program Officer for the ongoing operation of the commission in Washington, D.C. Returning to Pittsburgh in 1952, Clack entered the public relations field and served as an account executive for the Pittsburgh offices of such well- known organizations as the American Automobile Association, The Coca-Cola Company, the American Heart Association and the March of Dimes. It was the March of Dimes (known then as The National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis) which attracted him during his middle years, years of the raging polio epidemics which claimed thousands of victims annually. Clack assumed the directorship of the Allegheny County Chapter of the March of Dimes in 1953. The fifteen years of his tenure saw the development of two anti-polio vaccines: that of Jonas Salk at the University of Pittsburgh and the oral vaccine of Ohioan Albert Sabin. In addition to his responsibility for patient care and fundraising, Clack took an active part in the mass immunization programs which were launched by the AMA and which proved the efficacy of the Salk vaccine. Later, he was key in the transformation of the National Foundation into an agency devoted to the study and prevention of birth defects, a pursuit which remains the thrust of its programs even today. Moreover, he was active in seeking funding for the Salk Institute at La Jolla, California. =Academic career= Having received an undergraduate degree in Classics from Princeton in 1946, Clack, during his tenure with the March of Dimes, pursued an M.A. (1958) and a Ph.D. in Classics at the University of Pittsburgh, receiving the latter degree in 1962. Although at the time he had no intention of pursuing a career in Classics, in 1968 he was offered a position in the Department of Classics at Duquesne University and decided to turn his lifelong hobby into his profession, often reminding his colleagues that he had brought the modern business world to the Romans and Greeks. Clack has distinguished himself as an activist for his profession. For a number of years he has served as Chairman of the American Philological Association's Committee of Editors of Classical Journals and of its Committee for Regional Classical Organizations. He has devoted the greater portion of his time to the Classical Association of the Atlantic States. He served CAAS at every level: as President in 1978-1979, as Executive Director from 1993‚Äì2001 and later as Archivist. Moreover, he served as editor of the Association's journal (The Classical World) for 15 years.Classical World, /Volume 87. 1, Essays in Honor of Jerry Clack CAAS has established an annual lectureship in his name. At Duquesne University, he served as Chairman of the Department of Classics from 1973 to 1975 and again from 1980 to 1983 and has been active in university affairs, including service on the University Core Curriculum Committee, the Student Standing Committee, the Committee on Promotion and Tenure, and the Library Committee; in addition, he was a member of the Editorial Board of the Duquesne University Press for a time.For a full list of dates, positions held and organizational affiliations, see, Who's Who in the World (2010), p. 504 He retired from Duquesne in December, 2011 at age 85. Clack has published in his field, with particular interest in the Hellenistic age. In addition to journal articles, he has produced four textbooks devoted to Hellenistic poetry and epigrams: An Anthology of Alexandrian Poetry (1982); Meleager: The Poems (1992); Asclepiades of Samos and Leonidas of Tarentum: The Poems (1999); and Antipater of Sidon and Dioscorides: The Poems (2001). =Community involvement= In the Pittsburgh community he is an ardent member and former officer of Citizens for Global Solutions (formerly the World Federalist Association of Pittsburgh), a worldwide organization which seeks to strengthen the influence and effectiveness of the United Nations‚Äîan extension of his lifelong conviction that world peace and security can be achieved only by international cooperation. In November 2010, he was presented with the Norman Cousins Award by CGS for his fifty years of service in support of the programs and activities of the United Nations.See Global Citizens' Quarterly Bulletin, Fall 2010. He was also Treasurer and is currently Chairman of the Board of Opera Theater of Pittsburgh, whose goal is to bring the city interesting alternatives to the standard opera repertory with up-and-coming young singers and to encourage the production of American operas.

Although built in 1849, the chapel can trace its origins to the founding in 1824 of an Independent place of worship in the village (pre-dating the local Anglican church by 12 years). The new building was in religious use for nearly 150 years, but storm damage led to its closure and conversion into a private dwelling in 1993‚Äîalthough its former graveyard survives. The chapel is a Grade II Listed building. History The village of Hadlow Down is situated on high ground in the Sussex Weald between Buxted ( to the west) and Heathfield. Its first Anglican church, dedicated to St Mark, was built in 1836, and a parish was created from parts of Buxted and Mayfield parishes the following year. The first place of worship in the village was, however, founded 12 years earlier. In 1824, Henry Smith‚Äîa local builder and Wesleyan Methodist‚Äîbuilt an independent nonconformist chapel for the use of local Dissenters, principally Baptists. In 1849, it was replaced by the present building. This was recorded in the religious census of Sussex in 1851, for which the return (compiled by the chapel's trustee Benjamin Austen) stated there was accommodation for 600 worshippers and that typical Sunday attendance was 300 adults and 350‚Äì450 Sunday school children. The chapel was registered for marriages on 26 January 1876, and its denomination was recorded as \\"Calvinistic Baptist\\" in 1882. The chapel was still used for worship until the late 20th century, but it was severely damaged in the devastating Great Storm of 1987. It closed soon after this and was converted into a house in 1996. Providence Chapel was designated a Grade II Listed building on 31 December 1982. Architecture Providence Chapel is a square two-storey building of red and grey/blue brick with some Classical features such as a pediment and pilasters. The three-bay fa√ßade has two sash windows (originally blank recesses) on the ground floor and three above. The ground-floor windows flank a double doorway topped with a rounded fanlight. Above the upper windows is an open-based pediment with pilasters at each side; these are of red brick with wide grey stone quoins. The front wall is of red brick; at the side, there are alternate layers of red and glazed grey/blue bricks. The pediment has a circular stone motif bearing the text , and (referring to \\"James Hallett, Minister\\", who led the congregation at the time the chapel opened).

A second shopping center, called Mountain Grove at Citrus Plaza, opened nearby in 2015.  History  The \\"doughnut hole\\" is an approximately unincorporated area surrounded by the city of Redlands in southwestern San Bernardino County, California. Citrus groves and farmland were scattered throughout the area since the 19th century. The city of Redlands began making public works improvements in the 1970s, after the county's Local Agency Formation Commission indicated the city would eventually be allowed to annex the area. Majestic Realty acquired the majority of the land and proposed the Citrus Plaza shopping center in 1993. Negotiations with the city government through the 1990s deteriorated into legal disputes. Majestic successfully lobbied the state government to pass a law in 2000 removing Redlands' control over the area.

The specific name is apparently in honor either of the Japanese malacologist Yoichiro Hirase (1859‚Äì1925) or of his son Shintaro Hirase (1884‚Äì1939).  Taxonomy  Eostrobilops hirasei was discovered and described under the name Strobilops hirasei by the American malacologist Henry Augustus Pilsbry in 1908. The type specimens are stored in the Academy of Natural Sciences (number 95251) and in Hirase's collection (number 1538). The species was moved into the newly created genus Eostrobilops by Henry Augustus Pilsbry in 1927; Eostrobilops hirasei is the type species of the genus Eostrobilops.15px Pilsbry H. A. (1927).

Geographic Distribution of Pupillidae; Strobilopsidae, Valloniidae and Pleurodiscidae. Conchological department Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia, Philadelphia. pages 42-46, plate 10, figure 4-7.  Distribution  The type locality is Jeju Island, in South Korea.  Shell description  The shell is rather depressed, with dome-shaped spire, the periphery mainly rounded but indistinctly subangular in front of the aperture, the base rather strongly convex. The umbilicus is small, widened in the last half-whorl, contained about 5¬Ω times in the diameter of shell (in some examples smaller, 6 times or 7¬Ω times in diameter). Opaque, cinnamon-brown, without much gloss, smoothish, with low growth-wrinkles. Whorls are strongly convex and increase slowly. The aperture is oblique and lunate, peristome russet, expanded and well thickened. The parietal callus is moderately heavy. The parietal lamella is rather strong and emerges to the edge of the callus. The infraparietal lamella is relatively strong though much lower than the parietal, and emerges nearly to the edge of the parietal callus. Both lamellae penetrate inward about one-third of a whorl, being conspicuously nodose at the edges, and there is a very weak continuation to about half a whorl inward. At a point about one-fourth of a whorl inward there is a low, short and blunt columellar lamella and two short basal folds. All or part of these are visible in an oblique view in the aperture, but owing to the opaque texture of the shell they are not visible through the base in specimens examined. The height of the shell is 2.1 mm. The width of the shell is 3 mm. The shell has 5‚Öì whorls. The height of the shell of the type specimen is 2.2 mm. The width of the type specimen is 3.2 mm. The type specimen has 5¬Ω whorls. This relatively large, solid species and it is distinguished from the Eostrobilops coreana and the Eostrobilops nipponica by the number of internal basal plicae (two). The growth wrinkles or striae are rather fine and somewhat sharp below the suture, but are not regular in development in the peripheral and basal parts.

Background After the general election in the UK in 1992, when the Liberal Democrats, then led by Paddy Ashdown, lost two seats in the UK Parliament, Ashdown became a notable proponent of co-operation between the Liberal Democrats and \\"New Labour\\". Ashdown had regular secret meetings with Tony Blair to discuss the possibility of a coalition government. In 1997, after the election of the New Labour government led by Blair, he and Ashdown created a Joint Cabinet Committee (JCC) comprising senior Labour and Liberal Democrat politicians to discuss the implementation of the two parties' shared priorities for constitutional reform. Ashdown' wrote later in his autobiography that the remit of the JCC was later expanded to include other issues on which Blair and Ashdown saw scope for co-operation between the two parties. Later commentary suggests that during this period Ashdown lost touch with his party and that his pursuit of this common agenda ultimately led to his resignation. Blair and Ashdown also agreed to create the Jenkins Commission to conduct a public inquiry into the case for electoral reform. Chaired by the Liberal Democrat peer Roy Jenkins, the commission recommended replacing the first-past-the-post electoral system with a system of proportional representation for use in general elections, in line with a key demand of Ashdown and his party. However, Blair remained unconvinced of the case for electoral reform, and the commission's recommendations have never been passed into law. The plan to bring Liberal Democrats into the government continued, according to Ashdown's published diaries, but foundered on opposition from senior Labour ministers,said by Ashdown to have been led by then Chancellor, and later Labour Party leader and Prime Minister, Gordon Brown. As a result members of the Liberal Democrats at their Spring convention in Southport in March 1998 passed a resolution that \\"triple-locked\\" the party leader, requiring him or her to engage with both the parliamentary and federal Liberal Democrats before a formal coalition could be agreed. Ashdown resigned as Liberal Democrat leader in early 1999. His successor, Charles Kennedy, allowed the JCC to slip into abeyance until it stopped meeting. Southport Rules The resolution passed states that: In order for the proposal to pass the leader must gain: * a 75 per cent majority of the Liberal Democratic Parliamentary Party (both MPs and members of the House of Lords) and * a 75 per cent majority of the 30 elected members of the Federal Party Executive. If both steps were not achieved, then the leader would call a special conference at which the resolution would need a two-thirds majority to pass. If that was not achieved, then there could be a postal ballot of the whole party in which the resolution would again need a two-thirds majority to pass. 2010 UK General Election In the run up to the 2010 UK General Election, the Southport Rules came further media investigation, as the likelihood of a hung parliament rose. Following a featured report on the rules by Michael Crick on BBC Newsnight on 12 March 2010, the Liberal Democrat Home Affairs spokesman Chris Huhne confirmed in interview that the then-leader, Nick Clegg, would be tied by the Southport Rules if there was a hung Parliament after the election.

Etymology The only source in which the name of the ruling class of the Sarmatians is preserved in its original form is the Chronicle of Jerome. According to Wilhelm Tomaschek, it is of Iranian origin and means \\"those who wage war.\\" According to George Vernadsky, it is a compound, the first component of which (Arcarag-) \\"must, in any case, be explained by the Ossetian language\\" because in Ossetian √§q√§r√§g means inaudible, quiet, depressed, dumb, while the second (Antes) is identical to Jordanes's and Procopius's form of the name Anta. According to this interpretation, the Agaragantes would be \\"mute Anti.\\" George Vernadsky (1887-1973) finds the explanation of the name \\"dumb Anti\\" in the story of Ammianus Marcellinus. After being defeated by the Romans, the Sarmatians sought their protection. Having in mind the past event, they were afraid of what was to come. Therefore, with the intention of humbly seeking peace, they came before the emperor, having confidence in him, because in such and similar cases he was milder than usual. On the day set for determining the conditions, Zizais, then still a prince, a young man of high stature, lined up the Sarmatians in fighting order, but not to fight but to pray for peace. Seeing the emperor, he threw down his weapon and lay on his chest. He lay as if dead. Dumbfounded by fear (amisso vocis officio prae timore) just when he was supposed to speak, he rather aroused pity in those present. He tried several times to explain what he was looking for, but he could barely, because every time he wanted to speak, he was interrupted by sobs. When he finally regained his composure, he was told to get up. Leaning on his knees and restraining his tongue, he asked for his crimes to be forgiven and to be pardoned. Until then, a crowd of his compatriots who were allowed to make their pleas out of fear kept their mouths shut (cuius ora formido muta claudebat), because it was not yet certain what answer their superiors would get. When this was told to rise from the ground and when he gave these the long-awaited signal to speak, throwing shields and weapons, they surrendered to prayer in such a way that they humbly surpassed the prince himself. \\\\- Ammianus Marcellinus, Res Gestae, XVII, 12, 9-10 Vernadsky reminds us that there is one curse in the Ossetian language, which corresponds to this story: \\"a voice betrayed you\\"! (√§q√§r√§g f√§u!). Prevalence In Ptolemy, the interfluve of the Danube and the Tisza is marked as the area of Jaziga where the Iazyges live. This information led some scientists (Hugo Schuchardt (1842-1927), Johannes Schmidt and Alfred von Domaszewski) to the conclusion that Limigantes and Agaragantes lived right there. Heinrich Kipper also attributed \\"a large part of the area east of the Tisza\\" to them \\"because of the identity of the soil\\", but later he adhered (like Richard Kipper) to Ptolemy's data. According to Paƒç, the assumption that the Iaziges, at least later, after their strengthening in the new habitat, spread beyond Meƒëureƒçje, ie to the east (since the west and south were in Roman hands until later) is not only indicated by the identity of both sides of the Tisza, but also to a large extent the number of Iaziges. This is evidenced by the data from the time of the conflict between Agaragantes and Limiganates. More than 300,000 Agaragantes fled to Roman soil. The number of those who fled to Victohali was not insignificant either since they later helped the Romans in the fight against the Limigantes under the new king. Both groups were numerically inferior to the Limigantes. In addition, it should be added those Iaziges, who were not affected by the revolution, and who, since they practiced human hunting, also had slaves at their disposal and were so powerful that, like the liberated Limigantes, they continued to ravage the Roman provinces despite losses. However, one should not believe everything that is written in the sources, nor make excessive conclusions. The incursions of nomadic peoples were usually reduced to rapid, sudden raids by smaller detachments, and the number of 300,000 Agragantes was probably exaggerated. In any case, the question arises as to whether the lowlands between the Danube and the Tisza could then provide sufficient means of subsistence for so many people with freedom of movement, all the more so as they also nurtured horse breeding. The cause of Jaziga's increasing incursions into the Roman provinces of Pannonia and Moesia was probably not only a propensity for war and plunder (and later German pressure) but also partly limited living space and overcrowding. History They were probable descendants of the Roxolani, who had migrated from Dacia to Banat. In 331, the Thervingi pushed west and south- west into the territory of the Arcaragantes. In 332, the Sarmatians in Banat asked Constantine the Great for aid against the Thervingi. These Sarmatians had armed their \\"slaves\\" in order to cope with the situation; according to contemporary sources there was two categories of Sarmatians: the \\"masters\\" ‚Äì the Agaragantes, and the \\"slaves\\" ‚Äì Limigantes. In 334, there was an internal conflict between the Arcaragantes and the Limigantes. The Limagantes had after the conflict with the Goths, turned and expelled the Arcaragantes who then settled in the area of the Victohali, and became their vassals.

Data with many cases (rows) offer greater statistical power, while data with higher complexity (more attributes or columns) may lead to a higher false discovery rate. Big data challenges include capturing data, data storage, data analysis, search, sharing, transfer, visualization, querying, updating, information privacy and data source. Big data was originally associated with three key concepts: volume, variety, and velocity. When we handle big data, we may not sample but simply observe and track what happens. Therefore, big data often includes data with sizes that exceed the capacity of traditional software to process within an acceptable time and value. Current usage of the term big data tends to refer to the use of predictive analytics, user behavior analytics, or certain other advanced data analytics methods that extract value from data, and seldom to a particular size of data set. \\"There is little doubt that the quantities of data now available are indeed large, but that's not the most relevant characteristic of this new data ecosystem.\\" Analysis of data sets can find new correlations to \\"spot business trends, prevent diseases, combat crime and so on.\\" Scientists, business executives, medical practitioners, advertising and governments alike regularly meet difficulties with large data-sets in areas including Internet searches, fintech, urban informatics, and business informatics. Scientists encounter limitations in e-Science work, including meteorology, genomics, connectomics, complex physics simulations, biology and environmental research. Data sets grow rapidly, to a certain extent because they are increasingly gathered by cheap and numerous information-sensing Internet of things devices such as mobile devices, aerial (remote sensing), software logs, cameras, microphones, radio-frequency identification (RFID) readers and wireless sensor networks. The world's technological per-capita capacity to store information has roughly doubled every 40 months since the 1980s; , every day 2.5 exabytes (2.5√ó260 bytes) of data are generated. Based on an IDC report prediction, the global data volume was predicted to grow exponentially from 4.4 zettabytes to 44 zettabytes between 2013 and 2020. By 2025, IDC predicts there will be 163 zettabytes of data. One question for large enterprises is determining who should own big-data initiatives that affect the entire organization.Oracle and FSN, \\"Mastering Big Data: CFO Strategies to Transform Insight into Opportunity\\" , December 2012 Relational database management systems, desktop statistics and software packages used to visualize data often have difficulty handling big data. The work may require \\"massively parallel software running on tens, hundreds, or even thousands of servers\\". What qualifies as being \\"big data\\" varies depending on the capabilities of the users and their tools, and expanding capabilities make big data a moving target. \\"For some organizations, facing hundreds of gigabytes of data for the first time may trigger a need to reconsider data management options. For others, it may take tens or hundreds of terabytes before data size becomes a significant consideration.\\" Definition The term has been in use since the 1990s, with some giving credit to John Mashey for popularizing the term. Big data usually includes data sets with sizes beyond the ability of commonly used software tools to capture, curate, manage, and process data within a tolerable elapsed time. Big data philosophy encompasses unstructured, semi-structured and structured data, however the main focus is on unstructured data. Big data \\"size\\" is a constantly moving target, ranging from a few dozen terabytes to many zettabytes of data. Big data requires a set of techniques and technologies with new forms of integration to reveal insights from data- sets that are diverse, complex, and of a massive scale. \\"Variety\\", \\"veracity\\" and various other \\"Vs\\" are added by some organizations to describe it, a revision challenged by some industry authorities. A 2018 definition states \\"Big data is where parallel computing tools are needed to handle data\\", and notes, \\"This represents a distinct and clearly defined change in the computer science used, via parallel programming theories, and losses of some of the guarantees and capabilities made by Codd's relational model.\\" The growing maturity of the concept more starkly delineates the difference between \\"big data\\" and \\"Business Intelligence\\": * Business Intelligence uses applied mathematics tools and descriptive statistics with data with high information density to measure things, detect trends, etc. * Big data uses mathematical analysis, optimization, inductive statistics and concepts from nonlinear system identificationBillings S.A. \\"Nonlinear System Identification: NARMAX Methods in the Time, Frequency, and Spatio-Temporal Domains\\". Wiley, 2013 to infer laws (regressions, nonlinear relationships, and causal effects) from large sets of data with low information density to reveal relationships and dependencies, or to perform predictions of outcomes and behaviors. Characteristics Shows the growth of big data's primary characteristics of volume, velocity, and variety Big data can be described by the following characteristics: ; Volume: The quantity of generated and stored data. The size of the data determines the value and potential insight, and whether it can be considered big data or not. The size of big data is usually larger than terabytes and petabytes. ; Variety: The type and nature of the data. The earlier technologies like RDBMSs were capable to handle structured data efficiently and effectively. However, the change in type and nature from structured to semi-structured or unstructured challenged the existing tools and technologies. The Big Data technologies evolved with the prime intention to capture, store, and process the semi-structured and unstructured (variety) data generated with high speed(velocity), and huge in size (volume). Later, these tools and technologies were explored and used for handling structured data also but preferable for storage. Eventually, the processing of structured data was still kept as optional, either using big data or traditional RDBMSs. This helps in analyzing data towards effective usage of the hidden insights exposed from the data collected via social media, log files, and sensors, etc. Big data draws from text, images, audio, video; plus it completes missing pieces through data fusion. ; Velocity: The speed at which the data is generated and processed to meet the demands and challenges that lie in the path of growth and development. Big data is often available in real-time. Compared to small data, big data is produced more continually. Two kinds of velocity related to big data are the frequency of generation and the frequency of handling, recording, and publishing. ;Veracity:It is the extended definition for big data, which refers to the data quality and the data value. The data quality of captured data can vary greatly, affecting the accurate analysis.Big Data's Fourth V Other important characteristics of Big Data are: ;Exhaustive:Whether the entire system (i.e., n=all) is captured or recorded or not. ; Fine-grained and uniquely lexical: Respectively, the proportion of specific data of each element per element collected and if the element and its characteristics are properly indexed or identified. ; Relational: If the data collected contains common fields that would enable a conjoining, or meta- analysis, of different data sets. ; Extensional: If new fields in each element of the data collected can be added or changed easily. ; Scalability: If the size of the data can expand rapidly. ; Value: The utility that can be extracted from the data. ; Variability: It refers to data whose value or other characteristics are shifting in relation to the context in which they are being generated. Architecture Big data repositories have existed in many forms, often built by corporations with a special need. Commercial vendors historically offered parallel database management systems for big data beginning in the 1990s. For many years, WinterCorp published the largest database report. Teradata Corporation in 1984 marketed the parallel processing DBC 1012 system. Teradata systems were the first to store and analyze 1 terabyte of data in 1992. Hard disk drives were 2.5 GB in 1991 so the definition of big data continuously evolves according to Kryder's Law. Teradata installed the first petabyte class RDBMS based system in 2007. , there are a few dozen petabyte class Teradata relational databases installed, the largest of which exceeds 50 PB. Systems up until 2008 were 100% structured relational data. Since then, Teradata has added unstructured data types including XML, JSON, and Avro. In 2000, Seisint Inc. (now LexisNexis Risk Solutions) developed a C++-based distributed platform for data processing and querying known as the HPCC Systems platform. This system automatically partitions, distributes, stores and delivers structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data across multiple commodity servers. Users can write data processing pipelines and queries in a declarative dataflow programming language called ECL. Data analysts working in ECL are not required to define data schemas upfront and can rather focus on the particular problem at hand, reshaping data in the best possible manner as they develop the solution. In 2004, LexisNexis acquired Seisint Inc. and their high-speed parallel processing platform and successfully used this platform to integrate the data systems of Choicepoint Inc. when they acquired that company in 2008.https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp- dyn/content/article/2008/02/21/AR2008022100809.html In 2011, the HPCC systems platform was open-sourced under the Apache v2.0 License. CERN and other physics experiments have collected big data sets for many decades, usually analyzed via high-throughput computing rather than the map-reduce architectures usually meant by the current \\"big data\\" movement. In 2004, Google published a paper on a process called MapReduce that uses a similar architecture. The MapReduce concept provides a parallel processing model, and an associated implementation was released to process huge amounts of data. With MapReduce, queries are split and distributed across parallel nodes and processed in parallel (the Map step). The results are then gathered and delivered (the Reduce step). The framework was very successful,Bertolucci, Jeff \\"Hadoop: From Experiment To Leading Big Data Platform\\", \\"Information Week\\", 2013. Retrieved on 14 November 2013. so others wanted to replicate the algorithm. Therefore, an implementation of the MapReduce framework was adopted by an Apache open-source project named Hadoop.Webster, John. \\"MapReduce: Simplified Data Processing on Large Clusters\\", \\"Search Storage\\", 2004. Retrieved on 25 March 2013. Apache Spark was developed in 2012 in response to limitations in the MapReduce paradigm, as it adds the ability to set up many operations (not just map followed by reducing). MIKE2.0 is an open approach to information management that acknowledges the need for revisions due to big data implications identified in an article titled \\"Big Data Solution Offering\\". The methodology addresses handling big data in terms of useful permutations of data sources, complexity in interrelationships, and difficulty in deleting (or modifying) individual records. 2012 studies showed that a multiple-layer architecture is one option to address the issues that big data presents. A distributed parallel architecture distributes data across multiple servers; these parallel execution environments can dramatically improve data processing speeds. This type of architecture inserts data into a parallel DBMS, which implements the use of MapReduce and Hadoop frameworks. This type of framework looks to make the processing power transparent to the end-user by using a front-end application server. The data lake allows an organization to shift its focus from centralized control to a shared model to respond to the changing dynamics of information management. This enables quick segregation of data into the data lake, thereby reducing the overhead time. Technologies A 2011 McKinsey Global Institute report characterizes the main components and ecosystem of big data as follows: * Techniques for analyzing data, such as A/B testing, machine learning and natural language processing * Big data technologies, like business intelligence, cloud computing and databases * Visualization, such as charts, graphs and other displays of the data Multidimensional big data can also be represented as OLAP data cubes or, mathematically, tensors. Array Database Systems have set out to provide storage and high-level query support on this data type. Additional technologies being applied to big data include efficient tensor-based computation, such as multilinear subspace learning., massively parallel- processing (MPP) databases, search-based applications, data mining, distributed file systems, distributed cache (e.g., burst buffer and Memcached), distributed databases, cloud and HPC-based infrastructure (applications, storage and computing resources) and the Internet. Although, many approaches and technologies have been developed, it still remains difficult to carry out machine learning with big data. Some MPP relational databases have the ability to store and manage petabytes of data. Implicit is the ability to load, monitor, back up, and optimize the use of the large data tables in the RDBMS. DARPA's Topological Data Analysis program seeks the fundamental structure of massive data sets and in 2008 the technology went public with the launch of a company called Ayasdi. The practitioners of big data analytics processes are generally hostile to slower shared storage, preferring direct-attached storage (DAS) in its various forms from solid state drive (SSD) to high capacity SATA disk buried inside parallel processing nodes. The perception of shared storage architectures‚ÄîStorage area network (SAN) and Network-attached storage (NAS) ‚Äîis that they are relatively slow, complex, and expensive. These qualities are not consistent with big data analytics systems that thrive on system performance, commodity infrastructure, and low cost. Real or near-real time information delivery is one of the defining characteristics of big data analytics. Latency is therefore avoided whenever and wherever possible. Data in direct-attached memory or disk is good‚Äîdata on memory or disk at the other end of a FC SAN connection is not. The cost of a SAN at the scale needed for analytics applications is very much higher than other storage techniques. There are advantages as well as disadvantages to shared storage in big data analytics, but big data analytics practitioners did not favour it. Applications SAP Big data parked outside IDF13. Big data has increased the demand of information management specialists so much so that Software AG, Oracle Corporation, IBM, Microsoft, SAP, EMC, HP and Dell have spent more than $15 billion on software firms specializing in data management and analytics. In 2010, this industry was worth more than $100 billion and was growing at almost 10 percent a year: about twice as fast as the software business as a whole. Developed economies increasingly use data-intensive technologies. There are 4.6 billion mobile-phone subscriptions worldwide, and between 1 billion and 2 billion people accessing the internet. Between 1990 and 2005, more than 1 billion people worldwide entered the middle class, which means more people became more literate, which in turn led to information growth. The world's effective capacity to exchange information through telecommunication networks was 281 petabytes in 1986, 471 petabytes in 1993, 2.2 exabytes in 2000, 65 exabytes in 2007 and predictions put the amount of internet traffic at 667 exabytes annually by 2014. According to one estimate, one-third of the globally stored information is in the form of alphanumeric text and still image data, which is the format most useful for most big data applications. This also shows the potential of yet unused data (i.e. in the form of video and audio content). While many vendors offer off-the-shelf solutions for big data, experts recommend the development of in-house solutions custom-tailored to solve the company's problem at hand if the company has sufficient technical capabilities. =Government= The use and adoption of big data within governmental processes allows efficiencies in terms of cost, productivity, and innovation, but does not come without its flaws. Data analysis often requires multiple parts of government (central and local) to work in collaboration and create new and innovative processes to deliver the desired outcome. CRVS (civil registration and vital statistics) collects all certificates status from birth to death. CRVS is a source of big data for governments. =International development= Research on the effective usage of information and communication technologies for development (also known as ICT4D) suggests that big data technology can make important contributions but also present unique challenges to International development. Advancements in big data analysis offer cost-effective opportunities to improve decision-making in critical development areas such as health care, employment, economic productivity, crime, security, and natural disaster and resource management. Additionally, user-generated data offers new opportunities to give the unheard a voice. However, longstanding challenges for developing regions such as inadequate technological infrastructure and economic and human resource scarcity exacerbate existing concerns with big data such as privacy, imperfect methodology, and interoperability issues. =Healthcare= Big data analytics has helped healthcare improve by providing personalized medicine and prescriptive analytics, clinical risk intervention and predictive analytics, waste and care variability reduction, automated external and internal reporting of patient data, standardized medical terms and patient registries and fragmented point solutions. Some areas of improvement are more aspirational than actually implemented. The level of data generated within healthcare systems is not trivial. With the added adoption of mHealth, eHealth and wearable technologies the volume of data will continue to increase. This includes electronic health record data, imaging data, patient generated data, sensor data, and other forms of difficult to process data. There is now an even greater need for such environments to pay greater attention to data and information quality. \\"Big data very often means 'dirty data' and the fraction of data inaccuracies increases with data volume growth.\\" Human inspection at the big data scale is impossible and there is a desperate need in health service for intelligent tools for accuracy and believability control and handling of information missed. While extensive information in healthcare is now electronic, it fits under the big data umbrella as most is unstructured and difficult to use. The use of big data in healthcare has raised significant ethical challenges ranging from risks for individual rights, privacy and autonomy, to transparency and trust. Big data in health research is particularly promising in terms of exploratory biomedical research, as data- driven analysis can move forward more quickly than hypothesis-driven research. Then, trends seen in data analysis can be tested in traditional, hypothesis- driven followup biological research and eventually clinical research. A related application sub-area, that heavily relies on big data, within the healthcare field is that of computer-aided diagnosis in medicine. One only needs to recall that, for instance, for epilepsy monitoring it is customary to create 5 to 10 GB of data daily. Similarly, a single uncompressed image of breast tomosynthesis averages 450 MB of data. These are just few of the many examples where computer-aided diagnosis uses big data. For this reason, big data has been recognized as one of the seven key challenges that computer- aided diagnosis systems need to overcome in order to reach the next level of performance. =Education= A McKinsey Global Institute study found a shortage of 1.5 million highly trained data professionals and managers and a number of universities including University of Tennessee and UC Berkeley, have created masters programs to meet this demand. Private boot camps have also developed programs to meet that demand, including free programs like The Data Incubator or paid programs like General Assembly. In the specific field of marketing, one of the problems stressed by Wedel and Kannan is that marketing has several sub domains (e.g., advertising, promotions, product development, branding) that all use different types of data. Because one-size-fits-all analytical solutions are not desirable, business schools should prepare marketing managers to have wide knowledge on all the different techniques used in these sub domains to get a big picture and work effectively with analysts. =Media= To understand how the media uses big data, it is first necessary to provide some context into the mechanism used for media process. It has been suggested by Nick Couldry and Joseph Turow that practitioners in Media and Advertising approach big data as many actionable points of information about millions of individuals. The industry appears to be moving away from the traditional approach of using specific media environments such as newspapers, magazines, or television shows and instead taps into consumers with technologies that reach targeted people at optimal times in optimal locations. The ultimate aim is to serve or convey, a message or content that is (statistically speaking) in line with the consumer's mindset. For example, publishing environments are increasingly tailoring messages (advertisements) and content (articles) to appeal to consumers that have been exclusively gleaned through various data-mining activities. * Targeting of consumers (for advertising by marketers) * Data capture * Data journalism: publishers and journalists use big data tools to provide unique and innovative insights and infographics. Channel 4, the British public-service television broadcaster, is a leader in the field of big data and data analysis. =Insurance= Health insurance providers are collecting data on social \\"determinants of health\\" such as food and TV consumption, marital status, clothing size and purchasing habits, from which they make predictions on health costs, in order to spot health issues in their clients. It is controversial whether these predictions are currently being used for pricing. =Internet of Things (IoT)= Big data and the IoT work in conjunction. Data extracted from IoT devices provides a mapping of device inter-connectivity. Such mappings have been used by the media industry, companies and governments to more accurately target their audience and increase media efficiency. IoT is also increasingly adopted as a means of gathering sensory data, and this sensory data has been used in medical, manufacturing and transportation contexts. Kevin Ashton, digital innovation expert who is credited with coining the term, defines the Internet of Things in this quote: ‚ÄúIf we had computers that knew everything there was to know about things‚Äîusing data they gathered without any help from us‚Äîwe would be able to track and count everything, and greatly reduce waste, loss, and cost. We would know when things needed replacing, repairing or recalling, and whether they were fresh or past their best.‚Äù =Information technology= Especially since 2015, big data has come to prominence within business operations as a tool to help employees work more efficiently and streamline the collection and distribution of information technology (IT). The use of big data to resolve IT and data collection issues within an enterprise is called IT operations analytics (ITOA). By applying big data principles into the concepts of machine intelligence and deep computing, IT departments can predict potential issues and move to provide solutions before the problems even happen. In this time, ITOA businesses were also beginning to play a major role in systems management by offering platforms that brought individual data silos together and generated insights from the whole of the system rather than from isolated pockets of data. Case studies =Government= China * The Integrated Joint Operations Platform (IJOP, ‰∏Ä‰ΩìÂåñËÅîÂêà‰ΩúÊàòÂπ≥Âè∞) is used by the government to monitor the population, particularly Uyghurs. Biometrics, including DNA samples, are gathered through a program of free physicals. *By 2020, China plans to give all its citizens a personal \\"Social Credit\\" score based on how they behave. The Social Credit System, now being piloted in a number of Chinese cities, is considered a form of mass surveillance which uses big data analysis technology. India * Big data analysis was tried out for the BJP to win the Indian General Election 2014. * The Indian government uses numerous techniques to ascertain how the Indian electorate is responding to government action, as well as ideas for policy augmentation. Israel * Personalized diabetic treatments can be created through GlucoMe's big data solution. United Kingdom Examples of uses of big data in public services: * Data on prescription drugs: by connecting origin, location and the time of each prescription, a research unit was able to exemplify the considerable delay between the release of any given drug, and a UK-wide adaptation of the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guidelines. This suggests that new or most up-to-date drugs take some time to filter through to the general patient. * Joining up data: a local authority blended data about services, such as road gritting rotas, with services for people at risk, such as 'meals on wheels'. The connection of data allowed the local authority to avoid any weather-related delay. United States of America * In 2012, the Obama administration announced the Big Data Research and Development Initiative, to explore how big data could be used to address important problems faced by the government. The initiative is composed of 84 different big data programs spread across six departments. * Big data analysis played a large role in Barack Obama's successful 2012 re-election campaign. * The United States Federal Government owns five of the ten most powerful supercomputers in the world. * The Utah Data Center has been constructed by the United States National Security Agency. When finished, the facility will be able to handle a large amount of information collected by the NSA over the Internet. The exact amount of storage space is unknown, but more recent sources claim it will be on the order of a few exabytes. This has posed security concerns regarding the anonymity of the data collected. =Retail= * Walmart handles more than 1 million customer transactions every hour, which are imported into databases estimated to contain more than 2.5 petabytes (2560 terabytes) of data‚Äîthe equivalent of 167 times the information contained in all the books in the US Library of Congress. * Windermere Real Estate uses location information from nearly 100 million drivers to help new home buyers determine their typical drive times to and from work throughout various times of the day. * FICO Card Detection System protects accounts worldwide. =Science= * The Large Hadron Collider experiments represent about 150 million sensors delivering data 40 million times per second. There are nearly 600 million collisions per second. After filtering and refraining from recording more than 99.99995% of these streams, there are 1,000 collisions of interest per second. ** As a result, only working with less than 0.001% of the sensor stream data, the data flow from all four LHC experiments represents 25 petabytes annual rate before replication (). This becomes nearly 200 petabytes after replication. ** If all sensor data were recorded in LHC, the data flow would be extremely hard to work with. The data flow would exceed 150 million petabytes annual rate, or nearly 500 exabytes per day, before replication. To put the number in perspective, this is equivalent to 500 quintillion (5√ó1020) bytes per day, almost 200 times more than all the other sources combined in the world. * The Square Kilometre Array is a radio telescope built of thousands of antennas. It is expected to be operational by 2024. Collectively, these antennas are expected to gather 14 exabytes and store one petabyte per day. It is considered one of the most ambitious scientific projects ever undertaken. * When the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) began to collect astronomical data in 2000, it amassed more in its first few weeks than all data collected in the history of astronomy previously. Continuing at a rate of about 200 GB per night, SDSS has amassed more than 140 terabytes of information. When the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope, successor to SDSS, comes online in 2020, its designers expect it to acquire that amount of data every five days. *Decoding the human genome originally took 10 years to process; now it can be achieved in less than a day. The DNA sequencers have divided the sequencing cost by 10,000 in the last ten years, which is 100 times cheaper than the reduction in cost predicted by Moore's Law. * The NASA Center for Climate Simulation (NCCS) stores 32 petabytes of climate observations and simulations on the Discover supercomputing cluster. * Google's DNAStack compiles and organizes DNA samples of genetic data from around the world to identify diseases and other medical defects. These fast and exact calculations eliminate any 'friction points,' or human errors that could be made by one of the numerous science and biology experts working with the DNA. DNAStack, a part of Google Genomics, allows scientists to use the vast sample of resources from Google's search server to scale social experiments that would usually take years, instantly. * 23andme's DNA database contains genetic information of over 1,000,000 people worldwide. The company explores selling the \\"anonymous aggregated genetic data\\" to other researchers and pharmaceutical companies for research purposes if patients give their consent. Ahmad Hariri, professor of psychology and neuroscience at Duke University who has been using 23andMe in his research since 2009 states that the most important aspect of the company's new service is that it makes genetic research accessible and relatively cheap for scientists. A study that identified 15 genome sites linked to depression in 23andMe's database lead to a surge in demands to access the repository with 23andMe fielding nearly 20 requests to access the depression data in the two weeks after publication of the paper. *Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) and hydrodynamic turbulence research generate massive data sets. The Johns Hopkins Turbulence Databases (JHTDB) contains over 350 terabytes of spatiotemporal fields from Direct Numerical simulations of various turbulent flows. Such data have been difficult to share using traditional methods such as downloading flat simulation output files. The data within JHTDB can be accessed using \\"virtual sensors\\" with various access modes ranging from direct web-browser queries, access through Matlab, Python, Fortran and C programs executing on clients' platforms, to cut out services to download raw data. The data have been used in over 150 scientific publications. =Sports= Big data can be used to improve training and understanding competitors, using sport sensors. It is also possible to predict winners in a match using big data analytics. Future performance of players could be predicted as well. Thus, players' value and salary is determined by data collected throughout the season. In Formula One races, race cars with hundreds of sensors generate terabytes of data. These sensors collect data points from tire pressure to fuel burn efficiency. Based on the data, engineers and data analysts decide whether adjustments should be made in order to win a race. Besides, using big data, race teams try to predict the time they will finish the race beforehand, based on simulations using data collected over the season. =Technology= * eBay.com uses two data warehouses at 7.5 petabytes and 40PB as well as a 40PB Hadoop cluster for search, consumer recommendations, and merchandising. * Amazon.com handles millions of back-end operations every day, as well as queries from more than half a million third-party sellers. The core technology that keeps Amazon running is Linux-based and they had the world's three largest Linux databases, with capacities of 7.8 TB, 18.5 TB, and 24.7 TB. * Facebook handles 50 billion photos from its user base. , Facebook reached 2 billion monthly active users. * Google was handling roughly 100 billion searches per month . Research activities Encrypted search and cluster formation in big data were demonstrated in March 2014 at the American Society of Engineering Education. Gautam Siwach engaged at Tackling the challenges of Big Data by MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory and Dr. Amir Esmailpour at UNH Research Group investigated the key features of big data as the formation of clusters and their interconnections. They focused on the security of big data and the orientation of the term towards the presence of different types of data in an encrypted form at cloud interface by providing the raw definitions and real-time examples within the technology. Moreover, they proposed an approach for identifying the encoding technique to advance towards an expedited search over encrypted text leading to the security enhancements in big data. In March 2012, The White House announced a national \\"Big Data Initiative\\" that consisted of six Federal departments and agencies committing more than $200 million to big data research projects. The initiative included a National Science Foundation \\"Expeditions in Computing\\" grant of $10 million over 5 years to the AMPLab at the University of California, Berkeley. The AMPLab also received funds from DARPA, and over a dozen industrial sponsors and uses big data to attack a wide range of problems from predicting traffic congestion to fighting cancer. The White House Big Data Initiative also included a commitment by the Department of Energy to provide $25 million in funding over 5 years to establish the scalable Data Management, Analysis and Visualization (SDAV) Institute, led by the Energy Department's Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. The SDAV Institute aims to bring together the expertise of six national laboratories and seven universities to develop new tools to help scientists manage and visualize data on the Department's supercomputers. The U.S. state of Massachusetts announced the Massachusetts Big Data Initiative in May 2012, which provides funding from the state government and private companies to a variety of research institutions. The Massachusetts Institute of Technology hosts the Intel Science and Technology Center for Big Data in the MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, combining government, corporate, and institutional funding and research efforts. The European Commission is funding the 2-year-long Big Data Public Private Forum through their Seventh Framework Program to engage companies, academics and other stakeholders in discussing big data issues. The project aims to define a strategy in terms of research and innovation to guide supporting actions from the European Commission in the successful implementation of the big data economy. Outcomes of this project will be used as input for Horizon 2020, their next framework program. The British government announced in March 2014 the founding of the Alan Turing Institute, named after the computer pioneer and code-breaker, which will focus on new ways to collect and analyze large data sets. At the University of Waterloo Stratford Campus Canadian Open Data Experience (CODE) Inspiration Day, participants demonstrated how using data visualization can increase the understanding and appeal of big data sets and communicate their story to the world. Computational social sciences ‚Äì Anyone can use Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) provided by big data holders, such as Google and Twitter, to do research in the social and behavioral sciences. Often these APIs are provided for free. Tobias Preis et al. used Google Trends data to demonstrate that Internet users from countries with a higher per capita gross domestic product (GDP) are more likely to search for information about the future than information about the past. The findings suggest there may be a link between online behaviour and real-world economic indicators. The authors of the study examined Google queries logs made by ratio of the volume of searches for the coming year ('2011') to the volume of searches for the previous year ('2009'), which they call the 'future orientation index'. They compared the future orientation index to the per capita GDP of each country, and found a strong tendency for countries where Google users inquire more about the future to have a higher GDP. The results hint that there may potentially be a relationship between the economic success of a country and the information- seeking behavior of its citizens captured in big data. Tobias Preis and his colleagues Helen Susannah Moat and H. Eugene Stanley introduced a method to identify online precursors for stock market moves, using trading strategies based on search volume data provided by Google Trends. Their analysis of Google search volume for 98 terms of varying financial relevance, published in Scientific Reports, suggests that increases in search volume for financially relevant search terms tend to precede large losses in financial markets. Big data sets come with algorithmic challenges that previously did not exist. Hence, there is a need to fundamentally change the processing ways.E. Sejdiƒá, \\"Adapt current tools for use with big data,\\" Nature, vol. 507, no. 7492, pp. 306, Mar. 2014. The Workshops on Algorithms for Modern Massive Data Sets (MMDS) bring together computer scientists, statisticians, mathematicians, and data analysis practitioners to discuss algorithmic challenges of big data. Stanford. \\"MMDS. Workshop on Algorithms for Modern Massive Data Sets\\". Regarding big data, one needs to keep in mind that such concepts of magnitude are relative. As it is stated \\"If the past is of any guidance, then today‚Äôs big data most likely will not be considered as such in the near future.\\" =Sampling big data= An important research question that can be asked about big data sets is whether you need to look at the full data to draw certain conclusions about the properties of the data or is a sample good enough. The name big data itself contains a term related to size and this is an important characteristic of big data. But Sampling (statistics) enables the selection of right data points from within the larger data set to estimate the characteristics of the whole population. For example, there are about 600 million tweets produced every day. Is it necessary to look at all of them to determine the topics that are discussed during the day? Is it necessary to look at all the tweets to determine the sentiment on each of the topics? In manufacturing different types of sensory data such as acoustics, vibration, pressure, current, voltage and controller data are available at short time intervals. To predict downtime it may not be necessary to look at all the data but a sample may be sufficient. Big Data can be broken down by various data point categories such as demographic, psychographic, behavioral, and transactional data. With large sets of data points, marketers are able to create and use more customized segments of consumers for more strategic targeting. There has been some work done in Sampling algorithms for big data. A theoretical formulation for sampling Twitter data has been developed. Critique Critiques of the big data paradigm come in two flavors: those that question the implications of the approach itself, and those that question the way it is currently done. One approach to this criticism is the field of critical data studies. =Critiques of the big data paradigm= \\"A crucial problem is that we do not know much about the underlying empirical micro- processes that lead to the emergence of the[se] typical network characteristics of Big Data\\". In their critique, Snijders, Matzat, and Reips point out that often very strong assumptions are made about mathematical properties that may not at all reflect what is really going on at the level of micro-processes. Mark Graham has leveled broad critiques at Chris Anderson's assertion that big data will spell the end of theory: focusing in particular on the notion that big data must always be contextualized in their social, economic, and political contexts. Even as companies invest eight- and nine- figure sums to derive insight from information streaming in from suppliers and customers, less than 40% of employees have sufficiently mature processes and skills to do so. To overcome this insight deficit, big data, no matter how comprehensive or well analyzed, must be complemented by \\"big judgment,\\" according to an article in the Harvard Business Review. Much in the same line, it has been pointed out that the decisions based on the analysis of big data are inevitably \\"informed by the world as it was in the past, or, at best, as it currently is\\". Fed by a large number of data on past experiences, algorithms can predict future development if the future is similar to the past.Big Data requires Big Visions for Big Change., Hilbert, M. (2014). London: TEDx UCL, x=independently organized TED talks If the system's dynamics of the future change (if it is not a stationary process), the past can say little about the future. In order to make predictions in changing environments, it would be necessary to have a thorough understanding of the systems dynamic, which requires theory. As a response to this critique Alemany Oliver and Vayre suggest to use \\"abductive reasoning as a first step in the research process in order to bring context to consumers' digital traces and make new theories emerge\\". Additionally, it has been suggested to combine big data approaches with computer simulations, such as agent-based models and complex systems. Agent-based models are increasingly getting better in predicting the outcome of social complexities of even unknown future scenarios through computer simulations that are based on a collection of mutually interdependent algorithms.Epstein, J. M., & Axtell, R. L. (1996). Growing Artificial Societies: Social Science from the Bottom Up. A Bradford Book. Finally, the use of multivariate methods that probe for the latent structure of the data, such as factor analysis and cluster analysis, have proven useful as analytic approaches that go well beyond the bi-variate approaches (cross- tabs) typically employed with smaller data sets. In health and biology, conventional scientific approaches are based on experimentation. For these approaches, the limiting factor is the relevant data that can confirm or refute the initial hypothesis. A new postulate is accepted now in biosciences: the information provided by the data in huge volumes (omics) without prior hypothesis is complementary and sometimes necessary to conventional approaches based on experimentation. In the massive approaches it is the formulation of a relevant hypothesis to explain the data that is the limiting factor. The search logic is reversed and the limits of induction (\\"Glory of Science and Philosophy scandal\\", C. D. Broad, 1926) are to be considered. Privacy advocates are concerned about the threat to privacy represented by increasing storage and integration of personally identifiable information; expert panels have released various policy recommendations to conform practice to expectations of privacy.Darwin Bond-Graham, Iron Cagebook ‚Äì The Logical End of Facebook's Patents, Counterpunch.org, 2013.12.03Darwin Bond-Graham, Inside the Tech industry's Startup Conference, Counterpunch.org, 2013.09.11 The misuse of Big Data in several cases by media, companies and even the government has allowed for abolition of trust in almost every fundamental institution holding up society.Darwin Bond-Graham, The Perspective on Big Data, ThePerspective.com, 2018 Nayef Al-Rodhan argues that a new kind of social contract will be needed to protect individual liberties in a context of Big Data and giant corporations that own vast amounts of information. The use of Big Data should be monitored and better regulated at the national and international levels. Barocas and Nissenbaum argue that one way of protecting individual users is by being informed about the types of information being collected, with whom it is shared, under what constrains and for what purposes. =Critiques of the 'V' model= The 'V' model of Big Data is concerting as it centres around computational scalability and lacks in a loss around the perceptibility and understandability of information. This led to the framework of cognitive big data, which characterizes Big Data application according to: * Data completeness: understanding of the non-obvious from data; * Data correlation, causation, and predictability: causality as not essential requirement to achieve predictability; * Explainability and interpretability: humans desire to understand and accept what they understand, where algorithms don't cope with this; * Level of automated decision making: algorithms that support automated decision making and algorithmic self-learning; =Critiques of novelty= Large data sets have been analyzed by computing machines for well over a century, including the US census analytics performed by IBM's punch-card machines which computed statistics including means and variances of populations across the whole continent. In more recent decades, science experiments such as CERN have produced data on similar scales to current commercial \\"big data\\". However, science experiments have tended to analyze their data using specialized custom-built high-performance computing (super- computing) clusters and grids, rather than clouds of cheap commodity computers as in the current commercial wave, implying a difference in both culture and technology stack. =Critiques of big data execution= Ulf-Dietrich Reips and Uwe Matzat wrote in 2014 that big data had become a \\"fad\\" in scientific research. Researcher Danah Boyd has raised concerns about the use of big data in science neglecting principles such as choosing a representative sample by being too concerned about handling the huge amounts of data. This approach may lead to results bias in one way or another. Integration across heterogeneous data resources‚Äîsome that might be considered big data and others not‚Äîpresents formidable logistical as well as analytical challenges, but many researchers argue that such integrations are likely to represent the most promising new frontiers in science. In the provocative article \\"Critical Questions for Big Data\\", the authors title big data a part of mythology: \\"large data sets offer a higher form of intelligence and knowledge [...], with the aura of truth, objectivity, and accuracy\\". Users of big data are often \\"lost in the sheer volume of numbers\\", and \\"working with Big Data is still subjective, and what it quantifies does not necessarily have a closer claim on objective truth\\". Recent developments in BI domain, such as pro-active reporting especially target improvements in usability of big data, through automated filtering of non-useful data and correlations.Failure to Launch: From Big Data to Big Decisions , Forte Wares. Big structures are full of spurious correlations either because of non-causal coincidences (law of truly large numbers), solely nature of big randomnessRandom structures & algorithms (Ramsey theory) or existence of non-included factors so the hope, of early experimenters to make large databases of numbers \\"speak for themselves\\" and revolutionize scientific method, is questioned.Cristian S. Calude, Giuseppe Longo, (2016), The Deluge of Spurious Correlations in Big Data, Foundations of Science Big data analysis is often shallow compared to analysis of smaller data sets. In many big data projects, there is no large data analysis happening, but the challenge is the extract, transform, load part of data pre-processing. Big data is a buzzword and a \\"vague term\\", but at the same time an \\"obsession\\" with entrepreneurs, consultants, scientists and the media. Big data showcases such as Google Flu Trends failed to deliver good predictions in recent years, overstating the flu outbreaks by a factor of two. Similarly, Academy awards and election predictions solely based on Twitter were more often off than on target. Big data often poses the same challenges as small data; adding more data does not solve problems of bias, but may emphasize other problems. In particular data sources such as Twitter are not representative of the overall population, and results drawn from such sources may then lead to wrong conclusions. Google Translate‚Äîwhich is based on big data statistical analysis of text‚Äîdoes a good job at translating web pages. However, results from specialized domains may be dramatically skewed. On the other hand, big data may also introduce new problems, such as the multiple comparisons problem: simultaneously testing a large set of hypotheses is likely to produce many false results that mistakenly appear significant. Ioannidis argued that \\"most published research findings are false\\" due to essentially the same effect: when many scientific teams and researchers each perform many experiments (i.e. process a big amount of scientific data; although not with big data technology), the likelihood of a \\"significant\\" result being false grows fast ‚Äì even more so, when only positive results are published. Furthermore, big data analytics results are only as good as the model on which they are predicated. In an example, big data took part in attempting to predict the results of the 2016 U.S. Presidential Election with varying degrees of success. = Critiques of big data policing and surveillance = Big Data has been used in policing and surveillance by institutions like law enforcement and corporations. Due to the less visible nature of data-based surveillance as compared to traditional method of policing, objections to big data policing are less likely to arise. According to Sarah Brayne's Big Data Surveillance: The Case of Policing, big data policing can reproduce existing societal inequalities in three ways: * Placing suspected criminals under increased surveillance by using the justification of a mathematical and therefore unbiased algorithm; * Increasing the scope and number of people that are subject to law enforcement tracking and exacerbating existing racial overrepresentation in the criminal justice system; * Encouraging members of society to abandon interactions with institutions that would create a digital trace, thus creating obstacles to social inclusion. If these potential problems are not corrected or regulating, the effects of big data policing continue to shape societal hierarchies. Conscientious usage of big data policing could prevent individual level biases from becoming institutional biases, Brayne also notes.

The world-class foot race, intended to take the place of the Navy‚Äôs previous premiere race, the Blue Angels Marathon, attracts runners from all over the world. History Initially known as Park Field, the facility was established as a World War I training base in 1917. It was named after 1st Lieutenant Joseph D. Park, who was killed on 9 May 1913 when a military biplane, which he was flying plunged its nose into a gulley, turned a somersault and crashed against a tree, at Olive, California, thirty-nine miles southeast of Los Angeles. The aviator fell only fifteen feet, but the radiator crushed his head, and then fell upon his body. 1st Lieutenant Joseph D. Park =World War I= This site was originally established by the Army Signal Corps which managed Army aviation in its early days in May, 1917 after the United States entered World War I. The Department of War sent a cadre of officers to the Memphis area to survey sites for an aviation school. The group decided on a location in the Millington area, about 16 miles northeast of Memphis. An agreement to lease the land for the Army was concluded, and the construction of some 50 buildings began.National Archives of the United States: Records of the Training and Operations Group (Air Service) and the Training and Operations Division (Air Corps) Records of the Army Air Forces (AAF), (Record Group 18) 1903-64 (bulk 1917-47) Park Field covered of over 700 acres and could accommodate up to 1,000 personnel. Dozens of wooden buildings served as headquarters, maintenance, and officers‚Äô quarters. Enlisted men had to bivouac in tents. The first unit stationed there was the 160th Aero Squadron, which was transferred from Kelly Field, Texas in November, 1917. However, a few U.S. Army Air Service aircraft arrived with the 160th, Most of the Curtiss JN-4 Jennys to be used for flight training were shipped in wooden crates by railcar. Park Field served as a base for flight training for the United States Army Air Service. In 1917, flight training occurred in two phases: primary and advanced. Primary training took eight weeks and consisted of pilots learning basic flight skills under dual and solo instruction with a student capacity of 300. After completion of their primary training, flight cadets were then transferred to another base for advanced training. Training units assigned to Park Field were:Order of Battle of the United States Land Forces in the First World War, Volume 3, Part 3, Center of Military History, United States Army, 1949 (1988 Reprint) * Post Headquarters, Park Field, December 1917-July 1919 * 65th Aero Squadron (II), April 1918 Transferred from Kelly Field, Texas) : Re- designated as Squadron \\"A\\", July‚ÄìDecember 1918 * 87th Aero Squadron, December 1917 (Transferred from Selfridge Field, Michigan) : Re-designated as Squadron \\"B\\", July‚ÄìDecember 1918 * 160th Aero Squadron, December 1917 (Transferred from Kelly Field, Texas) : Re-designated as Squadron \\"C\\", July‚ÄìDecember 1918 * 214th Aero Squadron, December 1917 : Re-designated as Squadron \\"D\\", July‚ÄìDecember 1918 * Squadron \\"E\\", August‚ÄìDecember 1918 * Flying School Detachment (Consolidation of Squadrons A-E, December 1918-July 1919 By February 1918, flight operations were in full swing, but with the sudden end of World War I in November 1918, the future operational status of Park Field was unknown. Cadets in flight training on 11 November 1918 were allowed to complete their training, however no new cadets were assigned to the base. Also the separate training squadrons were consolidated into a single Flying School detachment in December, as many of the personnel assigned were being demobilized. Finally, flight training activities ceased in July, 1919. =Inter-war years= In March 1920 the War department officially purchased Park Field, and a small caretaker unit was assigned to the facility for administrative reasons. At that time the airfield began pioneering airmail routes throughout Tennessee and the surrounding states. However, the airfield continued to decline until it was little more than a storage area for aircraft and parts. By 1921, the decision had been made to phase down all activities at the base in accordance with sharply reduced military budgets. and the War Department had ordered the small caretaker force at Park Field to dismantle all remaining structures and to sell them as surplus. The field was closed and abandoned in January, 1922. Ironically, the Stock Market Crash of 1929 breathed new life into Park Field. During the 1930s the field served as a transient camp for unemployed workers. In 1937 the Resettlement Administration (later the Farm Security Administration) took over the land and developed model farms used to demonstrate what could be achieved with correctly managed land. Park Field remained under this agency's jurisdiction until the outbreak of World War II. =World War II= Aerial view of the Naval Air Station Memphis in the mid-1940s Just as the onset of World War I had given Park Field its birth in 1917, the declaration of war on December 8, 1941, had similar results, heralding the arrival of naval aviation to the Memphis area. In February 1942, the Navy Shore Station Development Board recommended approval of a reserve aviation base on the former site of Park Field. On September 15, 1942, the Naval Reserve Aviation Base was officially commissioned on the south side of the station. On January 1, 1943, the Naval Reserve Aviation Base was renamed Naval Air Station Memphis. During the war, Naval Air Station Memphis was a primary flight training center for aviators. It had a training capacity of about 600 flight cadets, and could support up to 10,000 cadets for ground crew training. The facility was expanded to about 3,500 acres in size, and supported sixteen outlying fields (OLF) for training and emergency landings in the area. In 1943, the training facility was designated as the Naval Air Technical Training Center (NATT).Tennessee Encyclopedia of History and Culture, Memphis Naval Air Station, Millington =Cold War= As part of the consolidation of facilities after the war, HQ NATT was transferred to NASM in 1946 and all the operations of the command were consolidated there in 1947. In April 1949, the base's functions completely changed, and a new Naval Air Station was established, different in both scope and function. The new NAS assumed logistic support for all the commands at Navy Memphis, except the Naval Hospital. The boundaries included all Navy property on both sides of the Millington-Arlington Road (Navy Road). NAS Memphis continued its support and logistics role for some 50 years. The faculty was made a permanent Naval Installation during the Korean War, and during the 1950s, it supported approximately 13,000 uniformed and civilian Naval personnel. During the Vietnam War, 23,000 trainees were assigned to NASM, which continued to provide service to the Navy into the 1990s. =Modern era= The 1993 Base Realignment and Closure Commission directed the realignment of Naval Air Station Memphis. The largest segments of this BRAC action were as follows: * Disestablishment of Naval Air Technical Training Center (NATTC) Memphis and the establishment of a new NATTC Pensacola as NAS Pensacola, Florida, on the grounds of the former Naval Aviation Depot (NADEP) Pensacola, the disestablishment of NADEP Pensacola also being BRAC-directed * Relocation of all USN and USMC enlisted aviation \\"A\\" schools and \\"C\\" schools at NATTC Memphis to NATTC Pensacola * Disestablishment of Naval Air Reserve Memphis and disestablishment or transfer/relocation of all assigned Naval Air Force Reserve and 4th Marine Aircraft Wing/Marine Air Reserve aircraft and aviation squadrons * Relocation of the Navy Personnel Command (NAVPERSCOM) / Bureau of Personnel (BUPERS) from Washington, DC to buildings and facilities previously occupied by NATTC Memphis * Sept 2015, Bridge Company C, part of 6th Engineer Support Battalion, 4th Marine Logistics Group, dedicated a new building for the Bridge Company on Base and it is the first time since the Base Realignment closure commission (1993) that a Marine unit resides on Base. NAS Memphis was redesignated Naval Support Activity Memphis September 30, 1995. The name was changed again to Naval Support Activity Mid-South October 1, 1998, to more closely identify the base's mission requirements and to reflect the Navy's approach to regionalization. =Guardsman shooting on 24 October 2013= On 24 October 2013 a gunman shot and injured two Army National Guard soldiers at NSA Mid- South.Suspect in custody after 2 National Guardsmen shot at the National Guard Armory in front of the naval base The suspect after the shooting was taken into custody.

He worked for the Mus√©um national d'histoire naturelle in Paris and is a former Vice President of the International Union for Conservation of Nature. He has done many major projects in the field, notably with petrels in the Indian Ocean and Madeiras, and has described a number of species.  Life  Jouanin began working professionally with birds in 1940 at the age of 15, when he started working for the Mus√©um national d'histoire naturelle under the tutelage of Jacques Berlioz, then the head of the ornithology department. At the age of 22 he married his wife, Nicole, with whom he has had two daughters. While working at the museum he, along with his colleague Jean Dorst, who later replaced Berlioz as the head of the ornithology department, helped write the species description for the Djibouti spurfowl, a critically endangered spurfowl endemic to Djibouti whose type specimen was brought to the museum. He also developed a lifelong interest in two distinctly different bird families, the hummingbirds and the petrels. Djibouti spurfowl, a bird described by Jouanin In 1955 Jouanin published his first independent species description after realizing that the new species, named Jouanin's petrel, differed significantly from the Mascarene petrel. This description began a long period of his life dedicated to the research of petrels in the Indian Ocean. While his primary goal was to find the breeding grounds of the Mascarene petrel, he discovered another new species, Barau's petrel, breeding on the island of R√©union. He also analyzed the differences between the R√©union and Seychelles populations of Audubon's shearwater. In 1963 he switched his focus to the Atlantic Ocean, participating with Francis Roux in an expedition to the Savage Islands. He then proceeded to study Cory's shearwater in the Madeiras with Alec Zino, a collaboration that has resulted in over eighty publications. Jouanin is recognized as an expert on the Order Procellariiformes and co-wrote the section on those birds in James Lee Peters's Check-list of Birds of the World. He served as the Vice President of the International Union for Conservation of Nature from 1970 to 1975 and has been a member of the International Ornithological Congress since 1954, serving on the Permanent Executive Committee from 1970 to 1978.

Biography Lelek took part in the widespread and systematic attacks on Bosniak civilians that were carried out in Vi≈°egrad between April and June 1992 by Bosnian Serb forces assisted by paramilitary groups from neighbouring Serbia. Some 4000 Muslims from Vi≈°egrad were disappeared. Lelek, a policeman, was a member of the group led by the war criminals Milan Lukiƒá and Mitar Vasiljeviƒá, both found guilty by the ICTY at The Hague of some of the most horrific crimes committed during the Bosnian War. Lelek was found guilty of taking part in persecution of the Bosniak (Bosnian Muslim) population, grave freedom deprivations, grave sexual assaults and forcible transfer of the population, in a campaign during which Bosnian Muslim men were abducted from their homes and places of work, detained and killed while women were taken to a camp where they were tortured and raped. In April 1992 Lelek and Lukiƒá repeatedly raped a Muslim woman in the Vilina Vlas hotel, on the outskirts of Visegrad. In June 1992, Lelek forced a Muslim woman detained at Vilina Vlas to \\"provide him with sexual services\\". In May and June 1992 Lelek and other Bosnian Serb soldiers and policemen abducted Muslim men from their homes near Vi≈°egrad and imprisoned them. They robbed and demolished the men's homes. In the course of one robbery and abduction Lelek forced a Muslim woman and her 80-year-old bed-ridden mother-in-law to take off their clothes to prove they had no money with them. Azra Osmanagiƒá, a prosecution witness, one of a group of Vi≈°egrad women forcibly transferred to Bosnian government-held territory and whose husband was abducted and killed, observed that Lelek \\"was raised with us, went to school with us, lived by us and did such terrible things\\". Osmanagiƒá and others were angered by the Court's verdict after the Trial Panel dismissed the charges against Lelek of the two decapitations and three killings in May 1992 and also the charge of killing the two women and baby at Mehmed Pa≈°a Sokoloviƒá Bridge and the Appeal Panel confirmed Lelek's acquittal. The Appeal Panel found that an amended indictment that left out the relevant criminal acts referred to in the previous indictment signified that the Prosecution had dropped these charges and that this had been explicitly and verbally confirmed before the court. On 23 May 2008, Lelek was found guilty and sentenced to 13 years in prison. On 12 January 2009, the Appellate Panel modified the First-instance Verdict and found Lelek guilty of crimes against humanity and sentenced him to 16 years of imprisonment.

It is a mystery novel of the type known as a whodunnit. This novel is generally felt to be the most humorous of Dr. Fell's adventures, somewhat echoing the farcical later adventures of Carr's Sir Henry Merrivale.S. T. Joshi, John Dickson Carr: A Critical Study (1990) () Plot summary When the ocean liner Queen Victoria arrives in Southampton harbor from New York City, mystery writer Henry Morgan disembarks hastily and calls on Dr. Fell to unfold a remarkable story of mayhem and mystery. It begins with Curtis Warren, an amateur cinematographer who also happens to be the nephew of what Morgan describes as ‚Äúa Great Personage in the present American Government [‚Ä¶] not far from F.D. himself‚Äù. One afternoon during the Queen Victoria‚Äôs voyage, Morgan and his friends Peggy Glenn and Capt. Thomassen Valvick (Ret.) are summoned to Warren‚Äôs cabin, where they find its occupant nursing a wounded cranium and thoughts of vengeance. It seems that Warren inadvertently brought some reels of film on board showing his uncle, near the end of a long dinner party, making an extremely impolite speech about his fellows among the world‚Äôs mighty, and that someone has just broken into Warren‚Äôs cabin, hit him over the head, and stolen enough of this film to cause unheard-of scandal. The four of them soon learn that a notorious and dangerous criminal (the ‚ÄúBlind Barber‚Äù of the title) is believed to be on board the ship. Concluding that this is the person who stole Warren‚Äôs film, they hatch a plan to lure the thief into coming back for the rest of the loot so they can catch him or her in the act. Instead, they end up inadvertently attacking the captain of the Queen Victoria and stealing, then losing, a valuable emerald elephant ‚Äì to say nothing of the dying woman they find in one of the cabins, who proceeds to apparently vanish into thin air. In attempting to unravel these complications, our heroes succeed only in creating a great many more; by the end of the voyage, Warren has been confined to the brig, the emerald elephant has inexplicably reappeared and disappeared several more times, a high-tech bug-powder gun has gone berserk, and a drunken puppeteer has started throwing the passengers‚Äô personal goods overboard, among other events. As Morgan relates all this, Fell, greatly amused, makes notes of sixteen clues that he labels with enigmatic phrases (‚ÄúThe Clue of Terse Style‚Äù, for instance). In the end, he interrupts the story to answer the doorbell; when he returns, he is carrying a brown-paper parcel that turns out, in due time, to contain the stolen film. Dr. Fell explains complacently that he‚Äôs already identified the Blind Barber to the Queen Victoria‚Äôs captain; the last two chapter show him explaining his deductions, both to Morgan and to the Barber himself.

These organic bodies of water have attained religious significance not from the modern alteration or blessing, but were sanctified through mythological or historical figures. Sacred waters have been exploited for cleansing, healing, initiations, and death rites (Altman 2002:6). Ubiquitous and perpetual fixations with water occur across religious traditions. It tends to be a central element in the creations accounts of almost every culture with mythological, cosmological, and theological myths (Altman 2002:3-6,13-20). In this way, many groups characterize water as \\"living water\\", or the \\"water of life\\" (Varner 2004:19, Altman 2002:2, Strang 2004:83). This means that it gives life and is the fundamental element from which life arises. Each religious or cultural group that feature waters as sacred substances tends to favor certain categorizations of some waters more than others, usually those that are most accessible to them and that best integrate into their rituals (Altman 2002:3). Rivers The Diura Fishing Village in Batanes is famous for its Ivatan fishing culture and rituals, as well as its proximity with the Racuh-a-Idi, a sacred spring believed to possess healing and rejuvenating powers. The spring is still used by the natives up to this day.http://biyahengpalos.blogspot.com/2015/08/diura-spring-of-youth.html =Ganges River = While all rivers are sacred in Hinduism, the Ganges River is particularly revered. In the Vedic myths, the goddess Ganga descended upon the earth to purify and prepare the dead (Alley 2008:171, Haberman 2006:60-61, Narayanan 2001:190-191). The River Ganges (Ganga) in India is seen as the physical embodiment of this goddess. Since the river waters are as both inherently pure themselves and having major purificatory qualities (Alley 2008:173-174, Nelson 2008:102), people come to bathe in them, drink from them, leave offerings for them, and give their physical remains to them. The Ganges is said to purify the soul of negative karma, corporeal sins, and even impurities from previous lives (Nelson 2008:102). At sunrise along the Ganges, pilgrims descend the ghat steps to drink of the waters, bathe themselves in the waters and perform ablutions where they submerge their entire bodies. These practitioners desire to imbibe and surround themselves with the Ganges‚Äôs waters so that they can be purified (Altman 2002:136-138, 181-183, 196-198). Hindu conceptualizations of the sacred are fluid and renewable. Purity and pollution exist upon a continuum where most entities, including people, can become sacred and then become stagnated and full of sin once again (Lamb 2008:341-346). Performing these rituals is also an act to become closer to the Hindu deities, and ultimately the Divine. The Ganges is one of the most highly favored sites for funerary rituals in India. It is presumed that if a deceased person is cleansed by the Ganges, it will help liberate their soul, or expedite the number of lives they need to achieve this (Altman 2002:137, McClaymond 2008:315). In the traditional funerary ceremony, a dead person is placed upon a funeral pyre until the body becomes cremated, then the ashes are sent upon the river (Michaels 2004:136-139). Many Hindus go to great lengths to purify themselves one last time before death. When this is not possible, family members will actually mail the ashes to a priest so that he can perform the ceremony of entering the waters (Altman 2008:136-137). Manu, the mythic law giver, gave directives and prohibitions regarding the river: ‚Äúimpure objects like urine, feces, spit; or anything which has these elements, blood, or poison should not be cast into the water‚Äù (Narayanan 2001:183-184). Few or none of his directives hold forth along most places down the Ganges today. Journalist Joshua Hammer wrote a very illustrative account of his personal visit to the Ganges in which he described seeing both animal and human corpses floating down the river or sometimes embedded in heaps of garbage. People continued to bathe, and children to play in very murky waters; the color in some parts completely changed from toxic sewage and runoff (Hammer 2007). As the Ganges River remains interwoven into daily existence, Hindus are vulnerable to urban contamination. Irony lies in that this river is venerated for her ability to wash away contaminants, yet is being stagnated. Lakes and underground water =Lake Titicaca= Lake Titicaca is widely known as being a sacred place for the Inca people. The Inca Empire origins lie in Lake Titicaca. Ancient Incan myths describe the Incas as being blessed by the sun because the sun first emerged from Lake Titicaca. Since then, the sun organizes social order and the movement of the sun organizes rituals and gatherings. The first emergence of people in the time of the sun emergence is said to be the elite in their caste system. The origin of the elite was and continues to be contested among the people on the Island of Lake Titicaca. Thus, creating competition to become part of the elite rank (Bauer 1998:240-246). In recent times, the pollution of Lake Titicaca has built up and caused an increase of green algae. The people of Lake Titicaca Special Projects continuously are creating ways to bring awareness to the importance of a clean lake for their society (Holston 2008:42). =Chichen Itza= The ancient Mayans valued social order and their society flourished because of the structure of their order. The ancient Mayans strived and focused their actions on pleasing their many gods. Essentially, the Mayans believed that the world consisted of three layers: the watery underworld, the middle earthly realm, and the sky realm. The Mayans viewed bodies of water as a direct connection to the watery underworld and underground water obtained through a cave as an even better connection to spirits and deities. Cenotes are very important to the Mayas. The famous cenote at Chichen Itza proves to be important with the many findings of artifacts and skeletal remains. Sacrifices were common at this site among the ancient Mayans. Different people were sacrificed and findings show that most of the people were men and children (Bruhns 1999:209). Like any archeological site, looting is problem in preserving and studying the cenote at Chichen Itza. =Black Mesa= The Navajo and Hopi people have long embraced the water underneath and around the Black Mesa area as sacred to their people. The people have long lived around and became dependent on springs and wells of the Black Mesa. These waters are the only source of drinking water, water for livestock, and water for agriculture for the Navajo and Hopi people. In respect for the water, these people carryout religious and ceremonial tributes to the water of the Black Mesa. These waters have organized their people around the Black Mesa and resulted in the reliance of the waters for all aspects of their lives. With the emergence of Peabody Energy came threats to the preservation of their sacred water. Peabody Energy pumps water out from underneath the Black Mesa to transport their mining minerals. In May 2002 the Navajo and Hopi people from northeastern Arizona joined their people in St. Louis Missouri to fight against Peabody Energy and its shareholders. In January 2002 Peabody proposed and was granted the right to use thirty-two percent more Navajo Aquifer (Naquifer) water than they had already been using. The significant increase in water pumped out of the Naquifer, dramatically affected the drinkability of the water from the springs and wells connected to the Naquifer. Before the significant increase of pumping, the water was clean enough to drink without any kind of purification. Another result of the pumping is the noticeable drop in the water levels of the springs and wells. The drop in water levels was almost immediately recognized after Peabody was granted permission to pump out more water. This had caused disruption in the ceremonial and cultural lives of the Navajo and Hopi people as well as disruption to their farming (Lee 2010).

She survived the atomic bombing of Hiroshima on 6 August 1945, only to die 18 days later. She was the first person in the world whose death was officially certified to be a result of radiation poisoning. Her notability helped publicize the adverse effects of exposure to radiation and encouraged more research on this area. Biography =Early life and acting career= Midori (Japanese for \\"green\\") Naka was born in the Nihonbashi district of Ch≈´≈ç, Tokyo in Japan, the third of four daughters of a military officer. She graduated from Osaka Jogakuin College, before joining the Asakusa samurai drama group in 1928. In 1931, she entered the newly formed Tsukiji Shokekijo (Tsukiji Little Theater) and distinguished herself as an actress of the Shingeki style, especially for her performances as the titular character in the production of Lady of the camellias. In the mid-1930s, she helped her sisters run a coffee shop in the Asakusa district in Tokyo. In 1940, the Tsukiji troupe was shut down by the police. She joined the Kuraku-za (Pain and Pleasure) theater company in 1942. Tokyo air raids made activity difficult, and the troupe disbanded in January 1945. In March 1945, Naka became lead actress in the Sakura-tai (Japanese for \\"Cherry Blossom Unit\\"), a newly formed mobile theater group organized by actor Sadao Maruyama.Powell, Brian (2002).

Hiroshima: Three Witnesses, p. 159. Princeton, New Jersey: Princeton University Press The nine members of the troupe rented a house that was located about from the ground zero of the atomic bombing of August 1945. They shared this house with members of another theater troupe of six members, the Sangoza.Sakura-tai Chiru (1988) Naka and sixteen of her colleagues were at the house in Hiroshima on 6 August 1945, when an atomic bomb detonated over the city. Thirteen of the seventeen actors were killed instantly. Naka survived, along with Sadao Maruyama, Keiko Sonoi and Shozo Takayama. Naka later described her experience: > When it happened, I was in the kitchen, since it was my turn to make > breakfast for the company that morning. I was wearing a light housecoat, > colored red and white and had a scarf tied about my head. When a sudden > white light filled the room, my first reaction was that the hot water boiler > must have exploded. I immediately lost consciousness.

Harcourt, Brace & World. p. 28 =Illness and death= A few days later, thanks to her status as a famous actress, Naka was able to find a seat into one of the rare trains that were then travelling to the capital. On August 16, Naka voluntarily entered the hospital of Tokyo University where she was examined by some of the best doctors in the country, including Dr. Matsuo Tsuzuki, arguably the foremost radiation expert in Japan at the time. In the hospital, she was given repeated blood transfusions by the doctors in an attempt to save her life. At the beginning of her hospitalization, her body temperature was 37.8 ¬∞C and her pulse 80 bpm. In the following days, her hair began to fall out and her white blood cell count sank from the normal count of 8,000 to 300-400 (other sources indicate 500 to 600 white blood cells), much to the surprise of the doctors. Her red blood cell count was at the 3,000,000 level. By August 21, her body temperature and pulse had risen to 41 ¬∞C and 158 bpm respectively. On August 23, twelve to thirteen purple patches appeared upon her body. The same day, Naka maintained she felt better. However, she died the following day, on 24 August 1945. She was the last surviving member of Sakura-tai; all three other survivors had already perished by then, also due to radiation poisoning.

Suntory Toyota International Centre for Economics and Related Disciplines, London School of Economics and Political Science, p. 6. Journalist Robert Jungk argues that the publicity surrounding the illness of Midori Naka, owing to her status as a public figure, was instrumental in catapulting the so-called \\"radiation sickness\\" to the public eye. Until Naka's story came forward, there was confusion and obscurity surrounding the mysterious \\"new sickness\\" from which many of the atomic bombing survivors were suffering. Jungk argues that, thanks to the prominence of Naka and her personal story, proper investigation and examination of the radiation poisoning phenomenon commenced, potentially saving the lives of many of the people exposed to radiation during the bombings. On 11 September 1945, the results of 37 autopsies of bomb victims conducted by the scientific team of Kyoto University were confiscated by the US Army General Thomas Farrell. The confiscated material removed to the United States included the remains of Naka. Her remains were carefully studied and were returned to Japan in 1972, in a set of glass preserving jars. They are since exhibited in the Hiroshima Peace Memorial. French poet references Naka in his poem Sous le signe d'Hiroshima (Under the Star of Hiroshima), likening her to a \\"flake of snow\\".Gaucheron, Jacques, Under the Stars of Hiroshima (excerpt), translated by Noriko Mizusaki in: The long poem was first published in the literary journal Europe: Revue Litt√©raire Mensuelle in 1970.Part VI: \\"L'Actrice Midori Naka joue la mort atomique\\" in: In 1988, a docudrama that dealt with the formation of the Sakura-tai and the fate of its members was released.

Indigenous refers to the native peoples of a given area and horticulture is the practice of small-scale intercropping. Africa =North Africa= In North Africa, one such example is the farming practices of the Eggon, a Nigerian hill farming community. The Eggon live in the Mada hills, between Lafia and Akwanga. The hills lay between two rivers, the Mada and Arikya. The altitude helps crops retain moisture on the hills, due to early morning mists and fogs; this also makes for earlier and longer crop cultivation. They practice bush fallow agriculture as well as mixed farming land management styles. They focus on growing yams, cassava, maize, beans, and African rice; much of what is produced is exported as a cash crop and is their primary source of cash income. The Eggon use a terraced agricultural system to maximize space on the hills. The goats they raise are kept mostly for fertilizers used in farming. They are only killed on special occasions, such as weddings. The Eggon use the diversity in their environment to maximize their crop production. =West Africa= In West Africa, the Kissidougou live on the savannah, dotted by dense areas of \\"forest islands\\" created by them. The Kissidougou practice intercropping within the forested areas. However, they also operate farms maintained on slopes or plateaus located between the forest islands. They prepare the savannah lands for forestation through farming and burning of the grasses to fertilize the soils. The Kissidougou graze their cattle on the savannah to help to maintain flammable grasses around the farms and the villages. The Kissidougou create diversity in their environment by farming and transforming savannah into lush, dense forest. The prevalence of wetlands in West Africa has helped to support local indigenous horticulture. Seasonal flooding of major rivers in the region, such as the Niger, the Sudd, and the Senegal, have made it possible for flood-cropping in many areas. Indigenous people have utilized a variety of irrigation techniques in order to take advantage of this flooding. Additionally, they plan their plantings and harvests specifically around the flooding of local rivers. For example, some farmers choose to plant on rising floods and harvest as the flooding diminishes. This techniques is utilized when cultivating rice.Adams, W. ‚ÄúIndigenous Use of Wetlands and Sustainable Development in West Africa.‚Äù The Geographical Journal 159. 2 (1993): 209-218. =East Africa= East Africa is one of the areas most affected by corporate farming. In western Uganda, there is a farming society called the Banyankore. Their land is part of the Ryampara hill country, between two flat, dry, and less-populated areas of land. On the hills, the average monthly rainfall is 970mm, with two short dry months in June and July and a short, less severe, dry month in January. Seven months out of the year the rainfall is over 1000mm per month. Their primary crop productions are bananas and coffee; they use these as cash crops. Farmers still use substantial areas for millet farming. This is their main food crop. They have intensive home gardens to produce for the families' needs and the outlying farming is used mostly for cash crop production, where coffees and bananas are cultivated using intercropping methods. =Southern Africa= In Southern Africa, conglomerates of farming companies have primarily written-off the lands in Northwest Zambia. The land is mostly made of plateaus, with lower-lying lands in the Kabompo and Zambezi river valleys. Much of the area is in the Congo‚ÄìZambezi watershed, the area of land where all the sources of water run into the same river basin. The land has several types of soil. There are areas of yellow clay, with higher concentrations of sand, where higher rainfall causes soil erosion; this makes farming in those areas difficult. There are also areas with fertile red clay; these are rich soils good for cultivation of crops. Farmers in the area grow sorghum, millet, sweet potatoes, pumpkin, and maize. There is marginal maize production, used as a cash crop for the community. The area is usually covered by thick forestation that must be cleared before crops can be cultivated; they do not practice agroforestry. Traditionally, spouses must maintain their own gardens. The produce is shared communally, but the practice leads to intensive home gardens that are maintained by the women of the villages. South Pacific =Highlander horticulture= The Enga of the Western Highlands Province in New Guinea receive most of their food from growing sweet potatoes Ipomoea batatas which they plant in mulch mounds at elevations up to 2,700m or higher (Dove and Carpenter 2008). The mounds that the Enga make to plant their crops of potatoes are formed from by piling large amounts of grass taken from fallow, or unplanted, plots then by covering the grass with dirt (Wohlt 2004). The size of the mounds depends on elevation; the higher the elevation; the bigger the mounds will be. Mounds above 2,500m in altitude can have a height of 0.85m in height; while crops below 1,500m are not mounded at all (Dove and Carpenter 2008). The function of the mound is to protect the crops from the frequent frosts that occur at the high altitudes of the Enga. With sweet potatoes having a very long maturation period, 9 months, the Enga also invest their time and space on the mounds with planting other crops that have much shorter maturation periods such as peas in case a heavy frost does claim the crop (Wohlt 2004). The planting of the mounds is done so that the plants which have a higher frost tolerance, such as the Irish potatoes, are planted casually throughout the mound and the low tolerant sweet potatoes are planted in the best position to avoid the frost. Peas, beans, and cabbage which are all highly tolerant to frost will be planted outside the circle of sweet potatoes and lower on the mound placing them closer to the cold temperatures of the ground (Dove and Carpenter 2008). The Enga practice fallow rotation where a garden will in crop for about four years followed by about four years of fallow grassland to let the soil replenish (Wohlt 2004). Garden size for an average Enga garden is about 0.21 hectare or about 2,100 square meters and can contain a few hundred mounds (Wohlt 2004). Another gardening strategy the Enga have implemented is the use of kin lands that are usually within one to two days walk from the farmers normal planting grounds (Dove and Carpenter 2008). The uses of multiple gardens at differing elevation and the ability access clan lands in different areas for gardening have allowed the Enga to adapt to their environment and survive under harsh conditions. =Lowland Swidden cultivation= Swidden cultivation is an extensive agriculture practice that is also known as slash-and-burn agriculture. The process is extensive because it requires a vast amount of land divided into several plots with one plot planted for a period of years, while the other plots lay fallow for a number of years (Hyde 2010). For the Bine-speaking peoples of the New Guinea lowlands swidden cultivation is a main practice for crop propagation. The main crop the Bine grow is the taro root, although they grow about 15 subsidiary crops including: sweet potato, banana, manioc, maize, yam, pawpaw, sugar cane, pineapple, and others (Eden 1993). The swiddens which can be placed in either savannas or forests are created by cutting down all the vegetation in the area that the swidden will be. The farmers then pile all of the cut vegetation on the swidden plot and leave it to dry out through the dry season (Hyde 2010). Right before the wet season begins the piles are burned and the soil and ash are tilled together (Eden 1993). The process of tilling the soil and ash mixes the carbon and nitrogen rich ash into the soil thereby fertilizing the soil for the coming crop. After the soil is tilled the crops are planted. There are two planting years for a single swidden for the Bine farmers. In the first year the Bine plant primary taro root with a few subsidiary crops like bananas and sweet potatoes. In the second year taro root makes up about 50 percent of the swidden and the rest of the swidden is mixed with about 15 other plants. After the second year the Bine farmers move on to an adjacent swidden and allow the previous swidden to lay fallow or unplanted for a period of 5 to 10 years in order to repopulate the vegetation (Eden 1993). The number of years that a swidden will lay fallow is determined by the plants demand for the nitrogen in the soil. Some plants will leach the soil of nitrogen in a few years and require four or five times that fallow; while other plants can be planted for many years and lay fallow only one or two times the planting period (Hyde 2010). Swidden cultivation requires a lot of land in order to feed only a few people, but the Bine, whose numbers are low, make good uses of their land through swidden farming. =Island horticulture= For most South Pacific Island cultures the main subsistence techniques are hunting and gathering. Fishing and the gathering of sago, banana, and other tropical foods are the norm with very little organized agriculture. The Tabalu of Kiriwina located in the Trobriand Islands practice a form of agriculture called Kaylu‚Äôebila, a form of garden magic (Malinowski 1965). The main crop for the Tabalu is the yam and there is a definite division of labour according to sex when it comes to gardening. Heavy work is done by the men and it includes clearing the vegetation, caring the yam supports, and planting the yam tubers in the ground (Malinowski 1987). The women aid by weeding the gardens. Gardening for the Tabalu is a very long and in depth magical process; with special magicians and magical ingredients which have been handed down from family member to family member over time. Garden fields which are called Kwabila are fenced in on all sides to keep out the swine that are breed by the Tabalu. Kwabila are then divided into many smaller plots called baleko, these are the individual gardens that the crops will be planted in (Malinowski 1965). South America South America consists of modern-day Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador, Suriname, Brazil, Peru, Bolivia, Paraguay, Uruguay, Argentina, and Chile. South America has historically been a land exploited not only for its natural resources, but also for its indigenous knowledge and labor force. The environmental diversification of South America has been at the foundation of its presence in the global economy as a resource for agriculture, forestry, fishing, hunting, livestock, mining and quarrying. South America can be seen as cultural regions inhabited by marginal tribes, tropical forest tribes, and the circum-Caribbean tribes each with its own distinct way of agricultural cultivation (Lyon 1974:6). South America's geographic regions are inhabited by regional tribes which include; the Choc√≥ in the Northern Columbian area, The Kayapo in the Eastern Para area, the Chono in the Southern Fuegian area, and the Quechuas in the Western Peruvian area, (Lyon 1974:24). Each of these regions has adapted not only their own cultural identity and agricultural style, The Eastern region of South America is known as the Para area in what is now Brazil, and has for millennia been home to the tropical forest Kayap·ªõ tribe. The Kayap·ªõ lived in sedentary villages and were proficient in pottery and loom-weaving, yet they did not domesticate animals or poses knowledge on metallurgy. These Tropical forest Tribes can be characterized through their farming, dugout canoes, woven baskets, loom weaving, and pole and thatch houses (Posey 2002) In the Para area the Kayap·ªõ like most tribes of this region practiced intensive agriculture or clearing cultivation. Beginning their agricultural year with a low water season intensifies fishing. The low water season is then followed by the high water season or harvest season. It is during this harvest season that the Kayap·ªõ are able to exercise their leisure time before the cycle ends with (low water levels) and a return to intense fishing. Each changing season commences ceremonies for the Kayap·ªõ that are directly tied to agriculture, hunting, or fishing. Unlike the Choc√≥ the Kayap·ªõ used an agricultural method known as the slash-burn method (shifting agriculture). The Kayap·ªõ cut the forest in April to September (dry season) and time their burns just before the raining season. The Kayap·ªõ used circular plots for agricultural cultivation consisting of five rings (characterized as cultivation zones). The first circle or the inner circle was used for taro and sweet potatoes that thrive in the hotter soil found in the center of the plot. The second circle cultivated maize, manioc, and rice an area that needed various ash enrichment treatments and would experience short term growth. The third zone was an area of rich soil and best served mixed crops including the banana, urucu, papaya. The fourth zones consists of shade loving plants and are for a medical purpose, yet evidence of beans and yams have been also found here. The fifth zone or the outer ring was left as a protective zone that included trap animals protective insects and birds (Posey 2002). This form of agriculture requires not only intense physical labor but also requires a knowledge of not only the land, but various types of ground cover, shades and temperatures of local soils, as well as cloud formations to time careful burning . When the Kayap·ªõ manage their agricultural plots they must work with a variety of interacting factors including the background soil fertility, the heterogeneous quality of ash and its distribution, crop nutrient requirements, cropping cycles, management requirements, and pest and disease control clearly illustrating the common misconception that this form of agriculture is primitive and ineffiecnet (Posey 2002). It has often been thought that the slash-burn plots are abandoned after one or two years because of un productive soil, but this is a common misconception. The Kayap·ªõ revisit abandoned fields because plants can offer direct and indirect benefits. One direct benefit would be the ability to eat that which has been produced and an indirect benefit would be that open fields allow attract game for hunting and can produce long after they have been tended (Posey 2002). The Southern region of South America is known as the Fuegian area and is occupied by the Chono, Alacaluf and Yahgan . These Marginal tribes differed greatly from the other regions in that they were expert in making bark or plank canoes and domesticating dogs, hunting, fishing and gathering. Nomads with simple socio-religious patterns, yet completely lacked the technology of pottery, loom-weaving, metallurgy and even agriculture . Since there was a lack of agriculture in this region the Chono ate native berries, roots, fruits, and wild celery . The source of nutrition for the Chono, Yahgans, and Alcaaluf thus mainly consisted of sea food such as; whales, seal porpoises, guanacos, and otters . The Southern tribes of South America distinguished themselves not in having a rare form of agriculture like the North's slush-mush method or the having intensive agriculture like the East's sophisticated slash-burn method, yet were able to distinguished themselves in being absent of this trait . North America Farming methods developed by Native Americans include terracing, irrigation, mound building, crop rotation and fertilization. They also used extensive companion planting (see the Three Sisters). Terracing is an effective technique in a steep-sloped, semi-arid climate. The Indigenous farmers stair- stepped the hills so that soil erosion was minimal and land surface was better suited for farming. In the Southwest, including parts of New Mexico, Arizona, and parts of Northern Mexico, terracing was extensive. Terraces were constructed by placing rock dams to redirect runoff water to canals that evenly dispersed rain water. The terraced field transformed the terrain into land suitable for farming maize (Keoke and Porterfield 2005, pg. 56). There is evidence that terracing has been used in the Southwest for about 2,500 years.Sandor, Gersper and Hawley 1990, 71 The Anasazi people from this region built reservoirs and directed rain water through ditches to water the crops in the terraces.Keoke and Porterfield 2005, 58 The natives grew corn, squash, and beans, along with other crops in the terraced fields. Corn, squash, and beans were staple crops for Native Americans and were grown throughout much of the North American continent. This trio is known as the Three sisters. Ancient folklore belief says that the Three Sisters represented three goddesses. Each sister protected the other two, and therefore the Three Sisters were never be separated and instead be planted, cooked, and consumed together.Kowtko 2006, 54 In reality, This Triad was an example of symbiotic planting. The corn stalks functioned as a support for the beans. The beans fixed nitrogen into a usable form for the corn and squash, and the broad squash leaves provided shade for the soil, which aided in preventing evaporation and controlling weeds(Kowtko 2006, 54). As the success of the Three Sisters spread, many cultures turned away from hunting and gathering and relied much more on farming (Kowtko 2006, 55). Geographically native cultures in the Woodlands, Prairie, Plains, Great Basin, and Plateau regions of North America all utilized the Three Sisters to some extent. Where they were not grown, the locals traded for them (Berzok 2005, 9). Nomadic tribes, such as the Dakotas, would trade meat for these vegetable staples. The Three Sisters were usually eaten in unison, as they provide fairly balanced nutrition when consumed together(for example, beans and corn together provide a complete set of the essential amino acids). Native American farmers also employed irrigation. This technique was utilized throughout much of the Southwest and is useful where water is scarce. Irrigation was and is still used today throughout much of the world. Native Americans controlled the amount of water that reached their fields by building long irrigation canals to redirect water from a source to water their crops. The Hohokam people constructed about 600 miles of irrigation canals from AD 50 to 1450 near Phoenix, Arizona (Berzok 2005, 51). Part of the canal is used by the City of Phoenix today. The Olmecs of Mesoamerica built canals over 4,000 years ago.Keoke and Porterfield 2005, 55 Chinampas, artificial islands constructed in swamplands and lakes, were invented by Mayan farmers and the technique became used extensively throughout Mesoamerica and was later used by the Aztecs as part of the land reclamation process of the city of Tenochtitlan. This technique increases arable land, and provided additional farming plots the population of Mesoamerica grew (Keoke and Porterfield 2005, 60). In the Northeast Woodlands and the Great Lakes region, an advanced society known as the Moundbuilders emerged (Berzok 2005, 13). This society lived in the flood plains of the Mississippi river basin. This culture farmed mainly maize. They had little need for foraging and grew to an advanced civilization due to food surplus. They were the largest civilization north of the Rio Grande. Native Americans also developed storage systems such as storage containers which allowed them to store seeds to plant during the next planting season. They also stored food in dug-out pits or holes in hillsides. Native Americans developed corn cribs. These were storage bins that were elevated off the ground. This technique prevented moisture and animal intrusion (Berzok 2005, 122-123). Selective crop breeding was also employed. Corn is a domestic plant and cannot grow on its own. The first corn grown by Native Americans had small ears, and only produced a few kernels per ear. By 2,000 years ago, single stalks with large ears were being produced (Keoke and Porterfield 2005, 55). Native Americans created over 700 varieties of corn by 1500 AD.

The violence in Liberia had escalated in violation of the Abuja Agreement, and the Security Council stressed the importance of the capital Monrovia as a safe zone. The observance of the ceasefire had ended and hostilities were resumed, including in the capital. While the Economic Community of West African States Monitoring Group (ECOMOG) had deployed more troops in the city, the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) had adopted a mechanism for the resumption of the implementation of the Abuja Accord. The Security Council extended the mandate of the UNOMIL observation force in Liberia until 31 August 1996, and due to the deteriorating security situation, its size was temporarily downsized on the orders of the Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali. All attacks against ECOMOG (the ECOWAS peacekeeping force), UNOMIL and the humanitarian relief agencies, as well as the looting of their property was condemned. The parties were invited to abide by their agreements, observing the ceasefire and withdrawing from Monrovia. All countries were reminded to observe the arms embargo against Liberia imposed in Resolution 788 (1992) and report violations to the Committee established in Resolution 985 (1995).

With his father, Yoichir≈ç Hirase, he collected shells and helped start formalized malacology in Japan. In honor of their contributions to malacology, numerous species bear the Hirase name. Shintar≈ç lived from 1884 until 1939. He was born at Hukura on Awazi Island on February 28, 1884 and was the eldest son of Yoichir≈ç Hirase. Growing up surrounded by his father's business and collection, he developed a lifelong love of the study of malacology. He graduated from Third College and afterward took courses on psychology at the Faculty of Literature at Kyoto Imperial University (1910). In 1914 he matriculated to the faculty of Science, T≈çky≈ç Imperial University, having passed an examination for the science courses at the First College. He received his master's degree from T≈çky≈ç Imperial University in 1917 and continued post graduate work from 1917 to 1922. He was elected a member of the Malacological Society of London, of America, and of Germany. He was an initial member of the Malacological Society of Japan. He went on to teach natural sciences and zoology at H≈çsei University, Meiji University, Seikei University, and Sensh≈´ University from 1920 till shortly before his death.‚ÄúA Handbook of Illustrated Shells in Natural Colors from Japanese Islands and their Adjacent Territories‚Äù, By Shintaro Hirase, Revised and enlarged by Isao Taki, Sc.D., Bunkyokaku, Tokyo, 1951, page VI In his obituary in the Proceedings of the Malacological Society of London, he was noted to be ‚Äúwithout political interests and enthusiastically devoted to the study of mollusks.‚ÄùWinckworth R.

Physical, morphological or chemical characteristics and information about the relative order or absolute age of the spines or thorns is used to study past climate or plant physiology. Spines grown in series on a ~1m tall saguaro cactus in Tucson, Arizona. The numbers written on the cactus in black ink denote the order that the spines grew - youngest towards the apex, oldest towards the base. For example, columnar cactus spines grow from the apex of the plant. After several weeks the spines stop growing and have been moved to the side of the stem. The old spines remain in place for decades as new spines are created at the continually growing apex. The result is that along each external \\"rib\\" of the cactus is a series of spines arranged in the order they grew in ‚Äì the oldest spines are at the bottom and the youngest spines are at the top. These spines can be dated using bomb-spike Carbon-14 and isotopes of carbon (Carbon-13) and oxygen (Oxygen-18) may be used to infer past climate (e.g. precipitation or temperature), plant stem growth or plant physiology (e.g. photosynthetic processes). Alternatively, the width of small transverse bands in the spine may be used to infer daily information about cloud cover or plant productivity, although this remains to be tested. It has also been shown that regular waxy banding on the sides of a Costa Rican cactus (Lemaireocereus aragonii) indicate annual growth and can be used as temporal chronometers. Transverse banding on a spine from a fishhook barrel cactus growing in Tucson, Arizona. Each band (1 couplet of thick white and thin red lines) represents one day of spine growth. Each square in the bottom scale = 1 centimeter. This sub-discipline of paleoclimatology and ecophysiology is relatively new. Acanthochronology is closely related to dendrochronology, dendroclimatology and isotope geochemistry and borrows many of the methods and techniques from these sub-disciplines of the Earth Sciences. It also draws heavily from the field of ecophysiology, a branch of Biology, to ascribe spine or thorn characteristics to particular environmental or physiological variables. The first peer-reviewed article to present and explain an isotope spine series was from a saguaro cactus in Tucson, Arizona. This and other work shows that radiocarbon and isotope time-series derived from spines can be used for demographic or palaeoclimate studies.

Genre is the term for any category of literature or other forms of art or entertainment, e.g. music, whether written or spoken, audio or visual, based on some set of stylistic criteria. Genres are formed by conventions that change over time as new genres are invented and the use of old ones are discontinued. Often, works fit into multiple genres by way of borrowing and recombining these conventions...  Literary genres  =Absurdist/surreal/whimsical= Absurdist and surreal fiction challenges casual and rudimentary reasoning and even the most basic purposefulness found within life. There is often, though not always, a connection to comedy. Whimsical has to do with a sense of eccentric or quirky humor. Related styles exaggerate real life in a whimsical, eccentric, quirky or fanciful way, sometimes. The absurdist genre focuses on the experiences of characters in situations where they cannot find any inherent purpose in life, most often represented by ultimately meaningless actions and events that call into question the certainty of existential concepts such as truth or value. The closely related/overlapping surreal genre is predicated on deliberate violations of causality, producing events and behaviours that are obviously illogical. Constructions of surreal humour tend to involve bizarre juxtapositions, non-sequiturs, irrational or absurd situations and expressions of nonsense. Whimsical and related styles are exemplified by films such as Underground, Am√©lie, Micmacs and Dieta Mediterranea (\\"Mediterranean Food\\"). =Action= An action story is similar to adventure, and the protagonist usually takes a risky turn, which leads to desperate situations (including explosions, fight scenes, daring escapes, etc.). Action and adventure are usually categorized together (sometimes even as \\"action-adventure\\") because they have much in common, and many stories fall under both genres simultaneously (for instance, the James Bond series can be classified as both). * Heroic bloodshed: Hong Kong action revolving around stylized sequences and dramatic themes such as brotherhood, duty, honor, redemption and violence. * Military fiction: A story about a war or battle that can either be historical or fictional. It usually follows the events a certain warrior goes through during the battle's events. * Spy fiction: A story about a secret agent (spy) or military personnel member who is sent on an espionage mission. Usually, they are equipped with special gadgets that prove useful during the mission, and they have special training in things such as unarmed combat or computer hacking. They may or may not work for a specific government. * Wuxia: A martial arts genre with chivalrous protagonists on fantastic adventures. * Girls with guns and swords : This is a subgenre of action films and animation, often Asian films and anime, that portray a strong female protagonist who makes use of firearms to defend against or attack a group of antagonists. The genre typically involves gun-play, stunts and martial arts action. =Adventure= An adventure story is about a protagonist who journeys to epic or distant places to accomplish something. It can have many other genre elements included within it, because it is a very open genre. The protagonist has a mission and faces obstacles to get to their destination. Also, adventure stories usually include unknown settings and characters with prized properties or features. * Superhero fiction: A story that examines the adventures of costumed crime fighters known as superheroes, who often possess superhuman powers and battle similarly powered criminals, known as \\"supervillains\\". =Comedy= Comedy is a story that tells about a series of funny, or comical events, intended to make the audience laugh. It is a very open genre, and thus crosses over with many other genres on a frequent basis. * Comedy of manners: A film which satirizes the manners and affectations of a social class, often represented by stock characters. The plot of the comedy is often concerned with an illicit love affair or some other scandal, but is generally less important than its witty dialogue. This form of comedy has a long ancestry, dating back at least as far as Shakespeare's Much Ado about Nothing. * Humorous: Fiction full of fun, fancy, and excitement. Meant to entertain. * Tall tale: A humorous story with blatant exaggeration, swaggering heroes who do the impossible with nonchalance. * Parody: A story that mocks or satirizes other genres, people, fictional characters or works. Such works employ sarcasm, stereotyping, mockery of scenes, symbols or lines from other works, and the obviousness of meaning in a character's actions. Such stories may be \\"affectionate parodies\\" meant to entertain those familiar with the references of the parody, or they may be intended to undercut the respectability of the original inspiration for the parody by pointing out its flaws (the latter being closer to satire). * Romantic comedy aka RomCom: A subgenre that combines the romance genre with comedy, focusing on two or more individuals as they discover and attempt to deal with their romantic love, attractions to each other. The stereotypical plot line follows the \\"boy-gets-girl\\", \\"boy- loses-girl\\", \\"boy gets girl back again\\" sequence. Naturally, there are innumerable variants to this plot (as well as new twists, such as reversing the gender roles in the story), and much of the generally lighthearted comedy lies in the social interactions and sexual tension between the characters, who very often either refuse to admit they are attracted to one another or must deal with others' meddling in their affairs. * Comic fantasy: A subgenre of fantasy that is primarily humorous in intent and tone. Usually set in imaginary worlds, comic fantasy often includes puns on and parodies of other works of fantasy. It is sometimes known as low fantasy in contrast to high fantasy, which is primarily serious in intent and tone. The term \\"low fantasy\\" is also used to represent other types of fantasy, so while comic fantasies may also correctly be classified as low fantasy, many examples of low fantasy are not comic in nature. * Comedy horror: See Shaun of the Dead and Jennifer's Body. * Black comedy (or dark comedy): A parody or satirical story that is based on normally tragic or taboo subjects, including death, murder, suicide, illicit drugs and war. So-called \\"dead baby comedy\\" sometimes falls under this genre. * Zombie comedy: Often called zom com or zomedy, this is a genre that blends zombie horror motifs with slapstick comedy as well as dark comedy. * Comic science fiction: A comedy that uses science fiction elements or settings, often as a lighthearted (or occasionally vicious) parody of the latter genre. * Satire: Often strictly defined as a literary genre or form, though in practice it is also found in the graphic and performing arts. In satire, human or individual vices, follies, abuses, or shortcomings are held up to censure by means of ridicule, derision, burlesque, irony, or other methods, ideally with the intent to bring about improvement. Satire is usually meant to be funny, but its purpose is not primarily humour as an attack on something the author disapproves of, using wit. A common, almost defining feature of satire is its strong vein of irony or sarcasm, but parody, burlesque, exaggeration, juxtaposition, comparison, analogy, and double entendre all frequently appear in satirical speech and writing. The essential point, is that \\"in satire, irony is militant.\\" This \\"militant irony\\" (or sarcasm) often professes to approve (or at least accept as natural) the very things the satirist actually wishes to attack. =Crime= (See also: Mystery below) A crime story is about a crime that is being committed or was committed. It can also be an account of a criminal's life. It often falls into the action or adventure genres. * Courtroom drama: A television show subgenre of dramatic programming. This subgenre presents fictional drama about law. Law enforcement, crime, detective-based mystery solving, lawyer work, civil litigation, etc., are all possible focuses of legal dramas. Common subgenres of legal dramas include detective dramas, police dramas, courtroom dramas, legal thrillers, etc. Legal dramas come in all shapes and sizes and may also span into other forms of media, including novels, plays, television shows, and films. * Detective story: A story about a detective or person, either professional or amateur, who has to solve a crime that was committed. They must figure out who committed the crime and why. Sometimes, the detective must figure out 'how' the criminal committed the crime if it seems impossible. ** Whodunit: This is a complex, plot-driven variety of the detective story in which the audience is given the opportunity to engage in the same process of deduction as the protagonist throughout the investigation of a crime. The reader or viewer is provided with the clues from which the identity of the perpetrator may be deduced before the story provides the revelation itself at its climax. The investigation is usually conducted by an eccentric amateur or semi-professional detective. * Gangster: Literature that focuses on gangs, criminal organizations that provide a level of organization, and resources that support much larger and more complex criminal transactions than an individual criminal could achieve. Gangsters are the subject of many movies, particularly from the period between 1930 and 1960. A revival of gangster type movies took place since the 1990s with the explosion of hip-hop culture. Unlike the earlier gangster films, the newer films share similar elements to the older films but is more in a hip-hop urban setting. * Gentleman thief: Centers around particularly well-behaving and apparently well-bred thieves. They rarely bother with anonymity or force, preferring to rely on their charisma, physical attractiveness, and clever misdirection to steal the most unobtainable objectssometimes for their own support, but mostly for the thrill of the act itself. * Gong'an fiction: A subgenre of historical crime fiction that involves government magistrates who solve criminal cases. * Hardboiled: This is a literary genre sharing the setting with crime fiction (especially detective stories). Though deriving from the romantic tradition, which emphasized the emotions of apprehension, horror and terror, and awe, hardboiled fiction deviates from the tradition in the detective's cynical attitude towards those emotions. The attitude is conveyed through the detective's self-talk describing to the reader (orin the filmto the viewer) what he is doing and feeling. *Heist: A thriller in which a criminal or group of criminals conceives and executes a major robbery. The theft usually involves gaining access to valuables stored in a high-security location, and the thieves may or may not use subterfuge to trick their way into and/or out of the stronghold. * Legal thriller: A subgenre of thriller and crime fiction in which the major characters are lawyers and their employees. The system of justice itself is always a major part of these works, at times almost functioning as one of the characters. In this way, the legal system provides the framework for the legal thriller much as the system of modern police work does for the police procedural. Usually, crusading lawyers become involved in proving their cases (usually their client's innocence of the crime he is accused of, or the culpability of a corrupt corporation that has covered its malfeasance) to such an extent that they imperil their own interpersonal relationships and frequently, their own lives. * Murder mystery: A mystery story that focuses on homicides. Usually, the detective must figure out who killed one or several victims. They may or may not find themselves or loved ones in danger because of this investigation. The genre often includes elements of the suspense story genre, or of the action and adventure genres. =Drama= Within film, television and radio (but not theatre), drama is a genre of narrative fiction (or semi-fiction) intended to be more serious than humorous in tone, focusing on in-depth development of realistic characters who must deal with realistic emotional struggles. A drama is commonly considered the opposite of a comedy, but may also be considered separate from other works of some broad genre, such as a fantasy. * Comedy-drama * Crime drama * Docudrama * Historical drama * Horror drama * Legal drama * Melodrama * Military drama * Romantic drama * Teen drama =Fantasy= The Whirlwind Seizes the Wreath A fantasy story is about magic or supernatural forces, rather than technology (as science fiction) if it happens to take place in a modern or future era. Depending on the extent of these other elements, the story may or may not be considered to be a \\"hybrid genre\\" series; for instance, even though the Harry Potter series canon includes the requirement of a particular gene to be a wizard, it is referred to only as a fantasy series. * Bangsian: A fantasy genre that concerns the use of famous literary or historical individuals and their interactions in the afterlife. It is named for John Kendrick Bangs, who often wrote in this genre. * Contemporary fantasy (also known as modern fantasy or indigenous fantasy): A subgenre of fantasy, set in the present day. These are used to describe stories set in the putative real world (often referred to as consensus reality) in contemporary times, in which magic and magical creatures exist, either living in the interstices of our world or leaking over from alternate worlds. ** Urban fantasy: A subgenre of fantasy defined by place; the fantastic narrative has an urban setting. Many urban fantasies are set in contemporary times and contain supernatural elements. However, the stories can take place in historical, modern, or futuristic periods, as well as fictional settings. The prerequisite is that they must be primarily set in a city. * Dark fantasy: A subgenre of fantasy that can refer to literary, artistic, and filmic works that combine fantasy with elements of horror. The term can be used broadly to refer to fantastical works that have a dark, gloomy atmosphere or a sense of horror and dread and a dark, often brooding, tone. * Fables: A type of narration demonstrating a useful truth. Animals speak as humans, legendary, supernatural tale. * Fairy tales: A literary genre about various magical creatures, environments, et cetera. Many fairy tales are generally targeted for children. * Hard fantasy: Fantasy where the world and its magical elements are constructed in a logical and rational manner. * Epic/High fantasy: Mythical stories with highly developed characters and story lines. E.g. Malazan Book of the Fallen and The Lord of the Rings * Heroic fantasy: subgenre of fantasy that chronicles the tales of heroes in imaginary lands. Frequently, the protagonist is reluctant to be a champion, is of low or humble origin, and has royal ancestors or parents but does not know it. Though events are usually beyond their control, they are thrust into positions of great responsibility where their mettle is tested in a number of spiritual and physical challenges. * Historical fantasy: a category of fantasy and genre of historical fiction that incorporates fantastic elements (such as magic) into the historical narrative. * Legends: Stories, oftentimes of a national hero or other folk figure, which have a basis in fact, but also contain imaginative material. * LitRPG/Isekai: A world that resembles a table-top or computer RPG, usually with ranks or levels in universe. Isekai in particular means the protagonist is sent or reincarnated in a game with knowledge and memories of the real world. * Magical girl: Popular in Japan, of girls who use magic in either their training, idol stardom or even to fight evil. * Mythic fiction: Literature that is rooted in, inspired by, or that in some way draws from the tropes, themes and symbolism of myth, folklore, and fairy tales.\\"A Mythic Fiction Reading List\\", The Journal of Mythic Arts The term is widely credited to Charles de Lint and Terri Windling. Mythic fiction overlaps with urban fantasy and the terms are sometimes used interchangeably, but mythic fiction also includes contemporary works in non-urban settings. Mythic fiction refers to works of contemporary literature that often cross the divide between literary and fantasy fiction. * Science fantasy: A story with mystical elements that are scientifically explainable, or that combine science fiction elements with fantasy elements. Note that science fiction was once referred to by this name, but that it no longer denotes that genre, and has somewhat fallen out of favor as a genre descriptor. ** Sword and planet: A subgenre of science fantasy that features rousing adventure stories set on other planets, and usually featuring Earthmen as protagonists. There is a fair amount of overlap between \\"Sword & Planet\\" and \\"planetary romance\\" though some works are considered to belong to one and not the other. In general, Planetary Romance is considered to be more of a Space Opera subgenre, influenced by the likes of A Princess of Mars yet more modern and technologically savvy, while Sword & Planet more directly imitates the conventions established by Burroughs in the Mars series. ** Dying Earth: A sub-subgenre of science fantasy that takes place either at the end of life on Earth or the End of Time, when the laws of the universe themselves fail. More generally, the Dying Earth subgenre encompasses science fiction works set in the far distant future in a milieu of stasis or decline. Themes of world- weariness, innocence (wounded or otherwise), idealism, entropy, (permanent) exhaustion/depletion of many or all resources (such as soil nutrients), and the hope of renewal tend to pre-dominate. ** Gaslamp fantasy: Fantasy's counterpart to steampunk, in which the settings are often Victorian or Edwardian socially or technologically, but with non-scientific elements or characters included. * Shenmo: A genre of fantasy that revolves around the gods and monsters of Chinese mythology. * Sword and sorcery: A blend of heroic fantasy, adventure, and frequent elements of the horrific in which a mighty barbaric warrior hero is pitted against both human and supernatural adversaries. Robert E. Howard, creator of Conan the Cimmerian, Kull of Atlantis, the Pictish king Bran Mak Morn, etc. is generally acknowledged as the founder of the genre, chiefly through his writings for Weird Tales and other 1920s and 1930s pulp magazines. =Historical= A story about a real person or event. There are also some fiction works that purport to be the \\"memoirs\\" of fictional characters as well, done in a similar style, however, these are in a separate genre. Often, they are written in a text book format, which may or may not focus on solely that. * Biography: The details of the life story of a real person, told by someone else. ** Autobiography: Essentially the same as a biography, with the exception that the story is written by the person who is the subject of the story. ** Memoir: Similar to autobiography, with the exception that it is told more \\"from memory\\", i.e. it is how the person personally remembers and feels about their life or a stage in their life, more than the exact, recorded details of that period. Though memoirs are often more subjective than autobiography works, memoirs are generally still considered to be nonfiction works.  Historical fiction  The genre historical fiction includes stories that are about the past. It takes place in the real world, with real world people, but with several fictionalized or dramatized elements. To distinguish historical fiction from any fiction that is written about an era in the past, the criteria that the book must have been written about a time that occurred in a historical context in relation to the author of the book. The criteria that the story be set before the middle of the previous century is sometimes added. Historical fiction stories include historical details and includes characters that fit into the time period of the setting, whether or not they are real historical people. This may or may not crossover with other genres; for example, fantasy fiction or science fiction may play a part, as is the case for instance with the novel George Washington's Socks, which includes time travel elements. * Alternate history: A more extreme variant of historical fiction which posits a \\"what if\\" scenario in which some historical event occurs differently (or not at all), thus altering the course of history; for instance, \\"What if Nazi Germany had won World War II?\\" is an alternate history concept that has had treatment in fiction. Alternate History is sometimes (though not universally) referred to as a subgenre of science fiction or speculative fiction, and like historical fiction, may include more fantastical elements (for instance, the Temeraire series uses the fantasy element of dragons to create an Alternate History plot set during the Napoleonic Era). ** Counterfactual history: Referred to as virtual history, it is a recent form of historiography that attempts to answer counterfactual \\"what if\\" questions. It seeks to explore history and historical incidents by means of extrapolating a timeline in which certain key historical events did not happen or had a different outcome. This exercise ascertains the relative importance of the event, incident or person the counter-factual hypothesis negates. * Period piece: This type features historical places, people, or events that may or not be crucial to the story. Because history is merely used as a backdrop, it may be fictionalized to various degrees, but the story itself may be regarded as \\"outside\\" history. Genres within this category are often regarded as significant categories in themselves. ** Jidaigeki: A story usually set in the Edo period of Japanese history, from 1603 to 1868. * Costume drama: A type of drama that especially relies on lavish costumes and designs. This type crosses over with many other genres. =Horror= An Illustration of Poe's 'The Raven' by Gustave Dor√© A horror story is told to deliberately scare or frighten the audience, through suspense, violence or shock. H. P. Lovecraft distinguishes two primary varieties in the \\"Introduction\\" to Supernatural Horror in Literature: 1) Physical Fear or the \\"mundanely gruesome\\" and 2) the true Supernatural Horror story or the \\"Weird Tale\\". The supernatural variety is occasionally called \\"dark fantasy\\", since the laws of nature must be violated in some way, thus qualifying the story as \\"fantastic\\". * Ghost story: A story about the intrusion of the spirits of the dead into the realm of the living. There are subgenres: The Traditional Haunting, Poltergeists, The Haunted Place or Object (i.e. the hotel in Stephen King's The Shining), or the etching in M. R. James' \\"The Mezzotint\\", etc. Some would include stories of Revenants such as W. W. Jacobs' \\"The Monkey's Paw.\\" * Monster: A story about a monster, creature or mutant that terrorizes people. Usually, it fits into the horror genre, for instance, Mary Shelley's novel Frankenstein. Shelley's Frankenstein is often also considered the first science fiction story (biological science reanimating the dead), but it does present a monstrous \\"creature\\". Other clear Monster stories are of the creatures of folklore and fable: the Vampire, the Ghoul, the Werewolf, the Zombie, etc. Beings such as that depicted in Karloff's The Mummy would also qualify. ** Giant monsters: A story about a giant monster, big enough to destroy buildings. Some such stories are about two giant monsters fighting each other, a genre known as kaiju in Japan, which is famous for such works after the success of such films and franchises such as Godzilla. * Werewolf fiction: Stories about werewolves, humans with the ability to shapeshift into wolves. * Jiangshi fiction: Stories about jiangshi, the hopping corpses under the control of Taoist priests derived from Chinese literature and folklore. * Vampire literature: A story about vampires, reanimated bodies that feed on the blood of the living, based on European folklore. Bram Stoker's Dracula created many of the genre's conventions. * Occult stories: Stories that touch upon the adversaries of Good, especially the \\"Enemies\\" of the forces of righteousness as expressed in any given religious philosophy. Hence, stories of devils, demons, demonic possession, dark witchcraft, evil sorcerers or warlocks, and figures like the Antichrist would qualify. The nature of such stories presupposes the existence of the side of Good and the existence of a deity to be opposed to the forces of Evil. * Slasher: A horror genre featuring a serial killer or other psychopath as an antagonist, methodically killing a number of protagonists in succession. Dramatic suspense is heightened by the victims' obliviousness of the killer. The victims are typically in isolated settings and often engaged in sexual activity previous to the attacks. The \\"slasher\\" kills their victims by sneaking up on them and then bloodily stabbing and slicing them to death with a sharp object, such as a chef's knife. Gender roles in slasher films are of particular interest in feminist film theory, which has extensively examined the trope of the Final girl. * Survival horror: A horror story about a protagonist in a risky and life-threatening situation that they must endure, often as a result of things such as zombies or other monsters, and the rest of the plot is how the main characters overcome this. =Magical realism= Magical realism, also called Magic realism, is literary works where magical events form part of ordinary life. The reader is forced to accept that abnormal events such as levitation, telekinesis and talking with the dead take place in the real world. The writer does not invent a new world or describe in great detail new creatures, as is usual in Fantasy; on the contrary, the author abstains from explaining the fantastic events to avoid making them feel extraordinary. It is often regarded as a genre exclusive to Latin American literature, but some of its chief exponents include English authors. One Hundred Years of Solitude, by Gabriel Garc√≠a M√°rquez, who received the 1982 Nobel Prize in Literature, is considered the genre's seminal work of style. =Mystery= A mystery story follows an investigator as they attempt to solve a puzzle (often a crime). The details and clues are presented as the story continues and the protagonist discovers them and by the end of the story the mystery/puzzle is solved. For example, in the case of a crime mystery the perpetrator and motive behind the crime are revealed and the perpetrator is brought to justice. Mystery novels are often written in series, which facilitates a more in-depth development of the primary investigator. Specific types of mystery story include locked room mysteries and cozy mysteries. =Paranoid fiction= Paranoid fiction is works of literature that explore the subjective nature of reality and how it can be manipulated by forces in power. These forces can be external, such as a totalitarian government, or they can be internal, such as a character's mental illness or refusal to accept the harshness of the world they live in. =Philosophical= Philosophical fiction is fiction in which a significant proportion of the work is devoted to a discussion of the sort of questions normally addressed in discursive philosophy. These might include the function and role of society, the purpose of life, ethics or morals, the role of art in human lives, and the role of experience or reason in the development of knowledge. Philosophical fiction works would include the so-called novel of ideas, including a significant proportion of science fiction, utopian and dystopian fiction, and Bildungsroman. The modus operandi seems to be to use a normal story to simply explain difficult and dark parts of human life. * Bildungsroman: A coming-of- age novel presenting the psychological, moral and social shaping of the personality of a character, usually the protagonist. The genre arose during the German Enlightenment. =Political= Political fiction is a subgenre of fiction that deals with political affairs. Political fiction has often used narrative to provide commentary on political events, systems and theories. Works of political fiction often \\"directly criticize an existing society or... present an alternative, sometimes fantastic, reality.\\" Prominent pieces of political fiction have included the totalitarian dystopias of the early 20th century such as Jack London's The Iron Heel and Sinclair Lewis's It Can't Happen Here. Equally influential, if not more so, have been earlier pieces of political fiction such as Gulliver's Travels (1726), Candide (1759) and Uncle Tom's Cabin (1852). Political fiction frequently employs the literary modes of satire, often in the genres of Utopian and dystopian fiction or social science fiction. * Utopian fiction: The creation of an ideal world, or utopia, as the setting for a novel * Dystopian fiction: The creation of a nightmare world, or dystopia, as the setting for a novel * Survivalism: The creation of world where traditional society has collapsed usually due to some post apocalyptic or doomsday scenario, as a setting for a novel =Romance= The term \\"romance\\" has multiple meanings; historical romances like those of Walter Scott would use the term to mean \\"a fictitious narrative in prose or verse; the interest of which turns upon marvellous and uncommon incidents\\"..Walter Scott, \\"Essay on Romance\\", Prose Works volume vi, p. 129, quoted in \\"Introduction\\" to Walter Scott's Quentin Durward, Susan Maning, ed Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1992. But most often a romance is understood to be \\"love stories\\", emotion-driven stories that are primarily focused on the relationship between the main characters of the story. Beyond the focus on the relationship, the biggest defining characteristic of the romance genre is that a happy ending is always guaranteed... perhaps marriage and living \\"happily ever after\\", or simply that the reader sees hope for the future of the romantic relationship. Due to the wide definition of romance, romance stories cover a wide variety of subjects and often fall into other genre categories as well as romance, such as Comedy-Romance (also known as romcom films), romantic suspense and (less common now): subcategories such as hospital romances, as found in the novels by Lucilla Andrews. See Mills & Boon imprint categories and Harlequin romances categories for a partial list of other sub-genres. =Saga= The sagas (from Icelandic saga, plural s√∂gur) are stories about ancient Scandinavian and Germanic history, about early Viking voyages, about migration to Iceland, and of feuds between Icelandic families. They were written in the Old Norse language, mainly in Iceland. The texts are epic tales in prose, often with stanzas or whole poems in alliterative verse embedded in the text, of heroic deeds of days long gone, tales of worthy men, who were often Vikings, sometimes Pagan, sometimes Christian. The tales are usually realistic, except legendary sagas, sagas of saints, sagas of bishops and translated or recomposed romances. They are sometimes romanticised and fantastic, but always dealing with human beings one can understand. * Family saga: The family saga chronicles the lives and doings of a family or a number of related or interconnected families over a period of time. In novels (or sometimes sequences of novels) with a serious intent, this is often a thematic device used to portray particular historical events, changes of social circumstances, or the ebb and flow of fortunes from a multiple of perspectives. =Satire= Often strictly defined as a literary genre or form, though in practice it is also found in the graphic and performing arts. In satire, human or individual vices, follies, abuses, or shortcomings are held up to censure by means of ridicule, derision, burlesque, irony, or other methods, ideally with the intent to bring about improvement. Satire is usually meant to be funny, but its purpose is not primarily humour as an attack on something the author disapproves of, using wit. A common, almost defining feature of satire is its strong vein of irony or sarcasm, but parody, burlesque, exaggeration, juxtaposition, comparison, analogy, and double entendre all frequently appear in satirical speech and writing. The essential point, is that \\"in satire, irony is militant.\\" This \\"militant irony\\" (or sarcasm) often professes to approve (or at least accept as natural) the very things the satirist actually wishes to attack. =Science fiction= Science fiction is similar to fantasy, except stories in this genre use scientific understanding to explain the universe that it takes place in. It generally includes or is centered on the presumed effects or ramifications of computers or machines; travel through space, time or alternate universes; alien life- forms; genetic engineering; or other such things. The science or technology used may or may not be very thoroughly elaborated on; stories whose scientific elements are reasonably detailed, well-researched and considered to be relatively plausible given current knowledge and technology are often referred to as hard science fiction. * Apocalyptic and post-apocalyptic fiction: concerned with the end of civilization either through nuclear war, plague, or some other general disaster. Post-apocalyptic fiction is set in a world or civilization after such a disaster. The time frame may be immediately after the catastrophe, focusing on the travails or psychology of survivors, or considerably later, often including the theme that the existence of pre- catastrophe civilization has been forgotten (or mythologized). Post- apocalyptic stories often take place in an agrarian, non-technological future world, or a world where only scattered elements of technology remain. There is a considerable degree of blurring between this form of science fiction and fiction that deals with false utopias or dystopic societies. * Hard science fiction: where the science is detailed, well-researched, and considered plausible such as Jurassic Park or Prey (novel). ** Tech noir: A hybrid of other works of fiction combining the film noir and science fiction or cyberpunk genres such as seen in Blade Runner (1982) and The Terminator (1984). It is a form of Neo-noir concentrating more on science fiction themes. The term was coined in The Terminator as the name of a nightclub, Tech Noir. The director James Cameron wanted a name for the particular style he was invoking. * Soft science fiction: not detailed about the science involved, and typically deals more with cultural, social, and political interactions. ** Comic science fiction: exploits the genre's conventions for comic effect. ** Military science fiction: told from the point of view of the military, or a main character who is a soldier in the military. It usually has technology far superior to today's, but not necessarily implausible. Military science fiction essentially is the addition of science fiction elements into a military fiction story. (Note that some military science fiction stories fit at least somewhat into the \\"hard science fiction\\" subgenre as well.) ** Feminist science fiction: tends to deal with women's roles in society. It poses questions about social issues such as how society constructs gender roles, the role reproduction plays in defining gender and the unequal political, economic and personal power of men and women. Some of the most notable feminist science fiction works have illustrated these themes using utopias to explore a society in which gender differences or gender power imbalances do not exist, or dystopias to explore worlds in which gender inequalities are intensified, thus asserting a need for feminist work to continue. ** Libertarian science fiction: focuses on the politics and social order implied by libertarian philosophies with an emphasis on individualism and a limited stateand in some cases, no state whatsoever. As a genre, it can be seen as growing out of the 1930s and 1940s when the science-fiction pulp magazines were reaching their peak at the same time as fascism and communism. While this environment gave rise to dystopian novels such as George Orwell's Nineteen Eighty-Four, in the pulps, this influence more often give rise to speculations about societies (or sub-groups) arising in direct opposition to totalitarianism. ** Social science fiction: concerned less with the scientific background and more with sociological speculation about human society. In other words, it \\"absorbs and discusses anthropology\\", and speculates about human behavior and interactions. Exploration of fictional societies is one of the most interesting aspects of science fiction, allowing it to perform predictive and precautionary functions, to criticize the contemporary world and to present solutions, to portray alternative societies and to examine the implications of ethical principles. * Space opera: A story characterized by the extent of space travel and distinguished by the amount of time that protagonists spend in an active, space-faring lifestyle. Firefly, Star Trek, Star Blazers and Star Wars have often been categorized as such. ** Science fiction Western: has elements of science fiction in a Western setting. It is different from a Space Western, which is a frontier story indicative of American Westerns, except transposed to a backdrop of space exploration and settlement. ** Planetary romance: the bulk of the action consists of adventures on one or more exotic alien planets, characterized by distinctive physical and cultural backgrounds. Some planetary romances take place against the background of a future culture where travel between worlds by spaceship is commonplace; others, particularly the earliest examples of the genre, do not, and invoke flying carpets, astral projection, or other methods of getting between planets. In either case, the planetside adventures are the focus of the story, not the mode of travel. ** Space Western: transposes themes of American Western books and film to a backdrop of futuristic space frontiers; it is the complement of the science fiction Western, which transposes science fiction themes onto an American Western setting. * Punk: Several different Science Fiction subgenres, normally categorized by distinct technologies and sciences. The themes tend to be cynical or dystopian, and a person, or group of people, fighting the corruption of the government. ** Cyberpunk: A futuristic storyline dealing with people who have been physically or mentally enhanced with cybernetic components, often featuring cyborgs or the singularity as a major theme, and generally somewhat cynical or dystopian (hence the \\"punk\\" portion of the name). This is often confused or placed with Techno-thriller, which is actually a separate and less specialized genre. *** Postcyberpunk: some critics suggest has evolved from cyberpunk. Like its predecessor, postcyberpunk focuses on technological developments in near-future societies, typically examining the social effects of a ubiquitous datasphere of computerized information, genetic engineering, modification of the human body, and the continued impact of perpetual technological change. Unlike \\"pure\\" cyberpunk, the works in this category feature characters who act to improve social conditions or at least protect the status quo from further decay. ** Retropunk: As a wider variety of writers began to work with cyberpunk concepts, new subgenres of science fiction emerged, playing off the cyberpunk label, and focusing on technology and its social effects in different ways. Many derivatives of cyberpunk are retro-futuristic, based either on the futuristic visions of past eras, or more recent extrapolations or exaggerations of the actual technology of those eras. *** Atompunk: relates to the pre-digital, cultural period of 1945‚Äì65, including mid-century Modernism, the \\"Atomic Age\\", the \\"Space Age\\", Communism and paranoia in the US along with Soviet styling, underground cinema, Googie architecture, space and the Sputnik, moon landing, superhero-comics, art and radioactivity, the rise of the US military/industrial complex and the fall-out of Chernobyl. Communist analog atompunk is an ultimate lost world. The Fallout series of computer games is an excellent example of atompunk. *** Dieselpunk: Initially proposed as a genre by the creators of the role-playing game Children of the Sun, dieselpunk refers to fiction inspired by mid-century pulp stories, based on the aesthetics of the interbellum period through World War II (c. 1920‚Äì45). Similar to steampunk though specifically characterized by the rise of petroleum power and technocratic perception, incorporating neo-noir elements and sharing themes more clearly with cyberpunk than steampunk. Though the notability of dieselpunk as a genre is not entirely uncontested, installments ranging from the retro-futuristic film Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow to the 2001 Activision video game Return to Castle Wolfenstein have been suggested as quintessential dieselpunk works of fiction. *** Steampunk: A story that takes place around the time steam power was first coming into use. The industrial revolution is a common time setting for steam punk stories, and the steam technology is often actually more advanced than the real technology of the time (for instance, Steam Detectives features steam-powered robots). The most immediate form of steampunk subculture is the community of fans surrounding the genre. Others move beyond this, attempting to adopt a \\"steampunk\\" aesthetic through fashion, home decor and even music. *** Clockpunk: This term has occasionally referred to a subgenre of speculative fiction that is similar to steampunk, but deviates in its technology. As with steampunk, it portrays advanced technology based on pre-modern designs, but rather than the steam power of the Industrial Age, the technology used is based on springs, clockwork and similar. Clockpunk is based very intensively on the works of Leonardo da Vinci and as such, it is typically set during the Renaissance. It is regarded as being a type of steampunk. ** Biopunk: A story that is about genetics and biological research (often falling under the horror category). It often focuses on some harmful effects characters have created when they change an animal's code to (unintentionally) create a violent monster. Biopunk emerged during the 1990s and depicts the underground of the biotechnological revolution that was expected to start having a profound impact on humanity in the first half of the 21st century. Biopunk fiction typically describes the struggles of individuals or groups, often the product of human experimentation, against a backdrop of totalitarian governments or megacorporations that misuse biotechnologies for social control or profiteering. Unlike cyberpunk, it builds not on information technology but on synthetic biology. *** Nanopunk: similar bio-punk, but depicts a world where the use of biotechnologies are limited or prohibited, so only nanotechnologies in wide use (while in biopunk bio- and nanotechnologies often coexist). Currently the genre is more concerned with the artistic and physiological impact of nanotechnology, than of aspects of the technology itself, which is still in its infancy. Unlike the cyberpunk, a low-life yet technologically advanced character, the personification of a nanopunk can be set 'hard' or 'soft', depending on your views of the impact nanotechnology will have on our future. = Social = In Indian cinema terminology, social films (or simply socials) are films with a contemporary setting, as opposed to those with mythological and period settings. =Speculative= Speculative fiction speculates about worlds that are unlike the real world in various important ways. In these contexts, it generally overlaps one or more of the following: science fiction, fantasy fiction, horror fiction, supernatural fiction, superhero fiction, utopian and dystopian fiction, apocalyptic and post- apocalyptic fiction, and alternate history. * Slipstream: Fantastic or non- realistic fiction that crosses conventional genre boundaries between science fiction/fantasy and mainstream literary fiction. The term slipstream was coined by cyberpunk author Bruce Sterling in an article originally published in SF Eye #5, July 1989. He wrote: \\"...this is a kind of writing which simply makes you feel very strange; the way that living in the 20th century makes you feel, if you are a person of a certain sensibility.\\" Slipstream fiction has consequently been referred to as \\"the fiction of strangeness,\\" which is as clear a definition as any others in wide use. * Supernatural fiction: exploits or requires as plot devices or themes some contradictions of the commonplace natural world and materialist assumptions about it. It includes the traditional ghost story. The Turn of the Screw by Henry James is an example of a work of literary fiction that is also largely concerned with supernatural fiction elements, making play of the possibility that they are psychological at root, but requiring the option that they are not for effect. The newer speculative fiction genres of horror fiction and fantasy fiction, growing out of some of the basic propositions and generic conventions, to a certain extent replaced it. * Superhero fiction: deals with superheroes, supervillains, super-powered humans, aliens, or mutants, and their adventures. Distinct from (but often derived from) comic books, animated films, and graphic novels, these are prose stories and full-length novels. Superhero fiction is a type of speculative fiction. The largest and longest running of the corporate series are those associated with the DC Universe and the Marvel Universe. * Utopian and dystopian fiction: The utopia and its offshoot, the dystopia, are genres of literature that explore social and political structures. Utopian fiction is the creation of an ideal world, or utopia, as the setting for a novel. Dystopian fiction is the opposite: creation of a nightmare world, or dystopia. Many novels combine both, often as a metaphor for the different directions humanity can take in its choices, ending up with one of two possible futures. Both utopias and dystopias are commonly found in science fiction and other speculative fiction genres, and arguably are by definition a type of speculative fiction. More than 400 utopian works were published prior to the year 1900 in the English language alone, with more than a thousand others during the 20th century. * Weird fiction: Speculative literature written in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Weird fiction is distinguished from horror and fantasy in that it predates the niche marketing of genre fiction. Because genre or stylistic conventions had not been established, weird tales often blend the supernatural, mythical, and even scientific. British \\"weird\\" authors, for example, published their work in mainstream literary magazines even after American pulp magazines became popular. \\"Weird fiction\\" is chiefly a historical description for works through the 1930s, but the term has also been used since the 1980s, sometimes to refer to slipstream fiction that blends horror, fantasy, and science fiction. Suppositional fiction is a subcategory in which stories and characters are constrained within an internally consistent world, but this category is not necessarily associated with any particular genre.Izenberg, Orin. Being Numerous: Poetry and the Ground of Social Life. Princeton: Princeton University Press, 2011; p. 210Leitch, Thomas M. What Stories Are: Narrative Theory and Interpretation University Park, Pennsylvania: Pennsylvania State University Press, 1986; p. 127Doma≈Ñska, Ewa. Encounters: Philosophy of History After Postmodernism Charlottesville, Virginia: University Press of Virginia, 1998; p. 10 A work of suppositional fiction might be science fiction, alternate history, mystery, horror, or even suppositional fantasy, depending on the intent and focus of the author. =Thriller= Rebecca (1940), where Mrs. Danvers tries to persuade Mrs. De Winter to leap to her death A Thriller is a story that is usually a mix of fear and excitement. It has traits from the suspense genre and often from the action, adventure or mystery genres, but the level of terror makes it borderline horror fiction at times as well. It generally has a dark or serious theme, which also makes it similar to drama. * Disaster- thriller: A story about mass peril, where the protagonist's job is to both survive, and to save many other people from a grim fate, often a natural disaster such as a storm or volcanic eruption, but may also be a terrorist attack or epidemic of some sort. * Psychological thriller: emphasizes the psychological condition of the hero that presents obstacles to his objective, rather than the action. Some psychological thrillers are also about complicated stories that try to deliberately confuse the audience, often by showing them only the same confusing or seemingly nonsensical information that the hero gains. * Crime thriller: A story that revolves around the life of detectives, mobs, or other groups associated with criminal events in the story. * Techno-thriller: A story whose theme is usually technology, or the danger behind the technology people use, including the threat of cyber terrorism such as State of Fear. =Urban= Urban fiction, also known as street lit, is a literary genre set, as the name implies, in a city landscape; however, the genre is as much defined by the race and culture of its characters as the urban setting. The tone for urban fiction is usually dark, focusing on the underside. Profanity (all of George Carlin's seven dirty words and urban variations thereof), sex and violence are usually explicit, with the writer not shying away from or watering-down the material. In this respect, urban fiction shares some common threads with dystopian or survivalist fiction. In the second wave of urban fiction, some variations of this model have been seen. =Western= Stories in the Western genre are set in the American West, between the time of the Civil war and the early twentieth century. The setting of a wilderness or uncivilized area is especially important to the genre, and the setting is often described richly and in- depth. They focus on the adventure of the main character(s) and the contrast between civilization or society and the untamed wilderness, often featuring the characters working to bring civilization to the wilderness. This genre periodically overlaps with historical fiction, and while a more traditional definition of westerns is that of stories about lone men facing the frontier, more modern definitions and writings are often expanded to include any person or persons in this time period that feature a strong tone of the contrast between civilization and wilderness and emphasize the independence of the main character(s). Film and television formats and genres Genres are listed under the sub-sectioned formats: =Animation= Although animation is listed under \\"Genres\\" and is classified as a genre by many film critics and streaming services, there is an ongoing debate between the animation community and the general public whether animation is a genre or a medium; and that the genres in the \\"Live-action scripted\\" genre can also be portrayed in an animated format, and the below kinds of animation are not types of stories, but simply types of ways that a film can be animated. * Traditional animation: also known as \\"cel (short for celluloid) animation\\", this is one of the oldest animation subgenres. Basically, it is a way of animating a cartoon by drawing and painting pictures by hand. Each drawing or painting is a different frame of animation, and when they are flipped or put in sequence at the right speed, they give the illusion of movement. Examples are Beauty and the Beast and Spirited Away. * Animated series: created or adapted with a common series title, usually related to one another and can appear as much as up to once a week or daily during a prescribed time slot. Animated cartoon series are also sometimes created outside of broadcast television, as was the case for the Tom and Jerry short films that appeared in movie theaters from 1961 to 1962. Series can have either a finite number of episodes like a miniseries, a definite end, or be open-ended, without a predetermined number of episodes. Examples include SpongeBob SquarePants, The Simpsons, and Avatar: The Last Airbender. * Stop motion: similar to traditional animation; instead of using hand drawn pictures, stop motion films are made with small figurines or other objects that have their picture taken many times over a sequence of small movements to create animation frames. Examples are The Nightmare Before Christmas, Coraline, and Corpse Bride. * Computer-generated imagery (CGI): A genre of animation that includes animating a cartoon on a computer modeling program. Models of characters or props are created on the computer, and then programmed to do something specific. Then, when the animation is completely programmed, the computer can play a completely computer generated movie. CGI is often used for the visual effects in Live Action films as well. Examples are Up or Toy Story. * Puppetry: It is technically live action, but puppetry is a different way of \\"animating\\" a movie, and puppets are often used in lieu of live actors. Usually, there are small figurines or figures (similar to stop motion), but these are controlled and filmed in real time. Like CGI, puppetry can be found in live-action films as a method of achieving a special effect. Examples are The Muppets, The Dark Crystal and 'Thunderbirds (TV series). =Live-action scripted= * Drama: **Adult content: the portrayal of sexual or sensual subject matter for the purpose of sexual arousal. A distinction is also made between softcore and hardcore pornography. Softcore pornography can generally be described as focusing on nude modeling or suggestive, but not explicit, simulations of sexual activity, whereas hardcore pornography explicitly showcases penetrative intercourse or other sex acts. ** Anthology series: presents a different story and a different set of characters in each episode. These usually have a different cast each week, but several series in the past, such as Four Star Playhouse, employed a permanent troupe of character actors who would appear in a different drama each week. Some anthology series, such as Studio One, began on radio and then expanded to television. ** Miniseries and Television movies ** Serial: A television show that is one continuous story. Each episode picks up from where the last one left off. The story may shift with a new season. ** Soap opera: Usually on every day of the week instead of once a week. Some can go on for over 50 years. Examples: Guiding Light, As the World Turns, All My Children, Days of Our Lives, General Hospital, The Young and the Restless, EastEnders and Coronation Street ** Telenovela: A serial melodrama popular in Latin America and the Philippines. They are similar to a soap opera in miniseries format. They often feature Love and Drama, as well as other situations depending on the genre of telenovela. Examples include: Desire (TV series), Fashion House and Wicked Wicked Games. ** : A serial period or contemporary drama produced in Turkey and broadcast weekly in Turkey, the Balkans, the Middle East, Central Asia and other regions. Depending on the audience they may be dubbed or sub-titled. Examples include: Muhte≈üem Y√ºzyƒ±l, Binbir Gece and G√ºm√º≈ü. See Turkish television drama. ** Art television (also called \\"quality television\\"): shares some of the same traits of art films. Television shows such as David Lynch's Twin Peaks series and BBC's The Singing Detective also have \\"...a loosening of causality, a greater emphasis on psychological or anecdotal realism, violations of classical clarity of space and time, explicit authorial comment, and ambiguity.\\" ** Action: where one or more heroes are thrust into a series of challenges that typically include physical feats, extended combat scenes, violence and frenetic chases. Action films tend to feature a resourceful character struggling against incredible odds, including life-threatening situations, a villain, or a pursuit, which generally conclude in victory for the hero. ** Adventure: features the hero in action scenes that display and explore exotic locations. The subgenres of adventure films include swashbuckler film, disaster films, and historical dramas‚Äîwhich is similar to the epic film genre. Main plot elements include quests for lost continents, a jungle or desert settings, characters going on a treasure hunts and heroic journeys into the unknown. Adventure films are mostly set in a period background and may include adapted stories of historical or fictional adventure heroes within the historical context. Kings, battles, rebellion or piracy are commonly seen in adventure films. Adventure films may also be combined with other movie genres such as, science fiction, fantasy and sometimes war films. ** Courtroom drama: presents fictional drama about law. Law enforcement, crime, detective-based mystery solving, lawyer work, civil litigation, etc., are all possible focuses of legal dramas. Common subgenres of legal dramas include detective dramas, police dramas, courtroom dramas, legal thrillers, etc. ** Detective fiction: a subgenre of crime fiction and mystery fiction in which an investigator or a detective ‚Äì either professional or amateur ‚Äì investigates a crime, often murder. ** Docudrama: A program depicting some sort of historical or current news event, with specific changes or fabrications for legal, continuity or entertainment reasons. Depending on the quality of the feature and intended audience, these changes can minimally or completely change the story in relation to the actual events. These programs often depict crime or criminals but can also be used to depict heroics or tell a less-explored side of a well-known story. Example: United 93 by Paul Greengrass depicts the events aboard United Airlines Flight 93 on September 11, 2001 via reconstruction from the available evidence. Since the specific words the passengers exchanged while planning their assault on the cockpit will never be known, the filmmakers created the dialogue based on research and evidence. The Onion Field is another example. This genre is often criticized for creating sensationalized programs intended to capitalize on public interest in lurid news stories; in the case of the Scott Peterson murder trial, a docudrama starring Dean Cain was filmed and aired during jury deliberations. ** Fantasy: featuring elements of the fantastic, often including magic, supernatural forces, or exotic fantasy worlds. Fantasy television programs are often based on tales from mythology and folklore, or are adapted from fantasy stories in other media. The boundaries of fantasy television overlap with science fiction and horror. ** Historical period drama: a work set in a past time period, usually used in the context of film and television. It includes romances, adventure films, and swashbucklers. A period piece may be set in a vague or general era such as the Middle Ages or a specific period such as the Roaring Twenties. A religious work can qualify as period drama but not as historical drama. ** Horror is a film genre seeking to elicit a negative emotional reaction from viewers by playing on the audience's primal fears. Horror films often feature scenes that startle the viewer; the macabre and the supernatural are frequent themes. Thus they may overlap with the fantasy, supernatural, and thriller genres. ** Legal drama: Legal drama sometimes overlap with crime drama, most notably in the case of the show Law & Order. ** Musical film ** Medical drama: based around a team of medics helping patients who have been involved in accidents serious or otherwise. Most commonly, an accident occurs that requires the medics to help the injured. Most are usually based around a hospital, with some based around a mobile medical team etc. Examples of this genre are Casualty, Holby City, and ER. ** Police procedural: pioneered by the popular show Dragnet. The stories revolve around a crime that has been committed and must be solved by the end of the episode following a very generic and usually unchanging structure of events. The crime is committed, witnesses are questioned, an arrest occurs, and then a judicial conclusion wraps it up. As the name implies, the show communicates everything \\"by the book,\\" as it would happen in real life. In such modern police procedurals, such as Law & Order, you see and hear even the officers reading freshly arrested criminals their Miranda rights. Not quite as dramatic or action-oriented as the Dick Tracy-style of detective shows. ***Philosophical and psychological drama (PPP): A genre of film that's primary focus is crime drama, told from the angle of different psychological conditions, that debates philosophies and psychology of the era depicted in film. Examples are True Detective and Mindhunters. ** Political drama is a TV program that has a political component, whether reflecting the author's political opinion, or describing a politician or series of political events. Dramatists who have written political dramas include Aaron Sorkin, Robert Penn Warren, Sergei Eisenstein, Bertolt Brecht, Jean-Paul Sartre, Caryl Churchill, and Federico Garc√≠a Lorca. Television series that can be classified as political drama include Yes Minister, its sequel Yes, Prime Minister, The West Wing, Borgen, Boss, Jack and Bobby, The Bold Ones: The Senator, Commander in Chief, and House of Cards. ** Science fiction ** Teen drama ** Thriller ** Western series: set in the American West and embody the spirit, the struggle and the demise of the new frontier. Western series use stock characters such as cowboys, gunslingers, and bounty hunters, often depicted as semi-nomadic wanderers who wear Stetson hats, bandannas, spurs, and buckskins, use revolvers or rifles as everyday tools of survival, and ride between dusty towns and cattle ranches on their trusty steeds. * Comedy: ** Action comedy: A subgenre of comedy that emphasizes physically humorous antics, unorthodox body-language and oftentimes exasperating situations. Examples are: Charlie Chaplin, Jackie Chan, and Lucille Ball. ** Comedy-drama ** Mockumentary: A story that employs the style of the documentary to present fictional, and generally humorous, events or characters. Very common in film and television programs, both as a full film or series, or as a brief sequence or episode within a larger work. Examples include This Is Spinal Tap and Best In Show. ** Romantic comedy (aka Rom-com) ** Satire: is a genre of literature and performing arts, in which vices, follies, abuses and shortcomings are held up to ridicule, ideally with the intent of shaming individuals, corporations, government, or society itself into improvement. ** Slapstick: A type of comedy involving exaggerated physical violence and activities beyond the boundaries of common sense. These hyperbolic depictions are often found in children's media, and light comedies. ** Sitcom: Short for situational comedy, a generally lighthearted genre that features characters having to deal with odd or uncomfortable situations or misunderstandings. ** Sketch comedy =Live- action unscripted= * Amateur: is the low-budget hobbyist art of film practised for passion and enjoyment and not for business purposes. A notable historical example is the Zapruder film (1963). * Children's series: Aimed at children and families. * Cooking show: A television program that presents food presentation in a kitchen television studio. Over the course of the program, the show's host, who is usually a celebrity chef, prepares one or more dishes over the course of the episode. The chef takes the viewing audience through the food's inspiration, preparation, and stages of cooking. * Court show: A court show is a television programming subgenre of either legal dramas or reality legal programming. Court shows present content mainly in the form of legal hearings between plaintiffs and defendants, which are presided over by a pseudo-judge. Court shows first arose in the United States, and are still predominantly found in the country today. * Documentary: a feature-length or near-feature-length film depicting a real-world event or person, told in a journalistic style (if told in a literary narrative style the result is often a docudrama). Examples: Hoop Dreams, The Thin Blue Line (documentary). * Dramality: a combination of television drama and reality television genres (e.g., the soap opera The Only Way Is Essex). * Educational: helps kids learn their basics to go through school. * Factual television: non-fiction television programming that documents actual events and people. These type of programs are also described as documentary, television documentary, observational documentary, fly on the wall, docudrama, and reality television. The genre has existed in various forms since the early years of television, but the term factual television has most commonly described programs produced since the 1990s. * Game show: depicting a real contest, typically a trivia competition or physical challenge, with rewards in prizes or money. The players may include celebrities, who can be found on such game shows as Match Game, Hollywood Squares, Hollywood Game Night and Celebrity Name Game. More often the participants are ordinary \\"everyday\\" people, such as Let's Make a Deal, Wheel of Fortune, Jeopardy!, and The Price Is Right. * Infomercials: Also known as Direct Response TV (DRTV), these are television commercials that generally include a phone number or website. Long-form infomercials are typically between 15 and 30 minutes long, and short-form infomercials are typically 30 seconds to 120 seconds long. Infomercials are also known as paid programming (or teleshopping in Europe). This phenomenon started in the United States where infomercials were typically shown overnight (usually 2:00 a.m. to 6:00 a.m.), outside of prime time commercial broadcasting peak hours. Some television stations chose to air infomercials as an alternative to the former practice of signing off. As of 2009, most US infomercial spending is during early morning, daytime, and evening hours. * Instructional: the use of television programs in the field of distance education. Educational television programs on instructional television may be less than one half hour long (generally 15 minutes in length) to help their integration into the classroom setting. These shows are often accompanied by teachers' guides that include material to help use this program in lessons. Instructional television programs are often shown during the daytime on Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) stations in the United States. However, fewer public television stations devote their airtime to ITV today than they do in the past; these days, ITV programs are either seen on a digital subchannel of non-commercial educational public television station, or passed on to a local educational-access television channel run by a Public, educational, and government access (PEG) cable TV organization. * Music television: where viewers listen to music on the television similar to a radio station apart from commonly having a visual or complete music video. * News program: depicting real, up-to-date events ** Current affairs: Broadcast journalism where the emphasis is on detailed analysis and discussion of a news story. ** Entertainment news: Form of entertainment journalism. Entertainment news programs focus on news involving the entertainment industry, including the world of film, television, and music. ** Tabloid television: (also known as Teletabloid) a form of tabloid journalism. Tabloid television newscasts usually incorporate flashy graphics and sensationalized stories. Often, there is a heavy emphasis on crime, stories with good video, and celebrity news. It is a form of \\"infotainment.\\" * Public affairs (broadcasting): This refers to radio or television programs that focus on politics and public policy. Among commercial broadcasters, such programs are often only to satisfy Federal Communications Commission (FCC) regulatory expectations and are not scheduled in prime time. Public affairs television programs are usually broadcast at times when few listeners or viewers are tuned in (or even awake) in the US, in time slots known as graveyard slots; such programs can be frequently encountered at times such as 5‚Äì6 a.m. on a Sunday morning. * Religious: produced by religious organizations, usually with a religious message. It can include church services, talk/variety shows, and dramatic movies. Within the last two decades, most religious programming is found on religious television networks. * Reality: A purportedly unscripted show (though evidence suggests that some scripting or manipulation occurs) featuring non-actors interacting with each other or dealing with invented or contrived challenges, such as competing against others for a prize. Produced in a similar fashion as the documentary film genre, but with more emphasis on the showing of interpersonal conflict, emotional reactions, or unusual occurrences. The genre has numerous widely varying subgenres (see main article). * Stand-up comedy: A style in which a comedian performs in front of a live audience, speaking directly to them. The performer is commonly known as a comic, stand-up comic, stand-up comedian or simply a stand-up. In stand-up comedy the comedian usually recites a fast- paced succession of humorous stories, short jokes called \\"bits\\", and one- liners, which constitute what is typically called a monologue, routine or act. Some stand-up comedians use props, music or magic tricks to enhance their acts. Stand-up comedy is often performed in comedy clubs, bars, neo- burlesques, colleges, and theaters. Outside of live performance, stand-up is often distributed commercially via television, DVD, and the internet. * Sports: The coverage of sports as a television program, on radio and other broadcasting media. It usually involves one or more sports commentators describing the events as they happen, which is called \\"colour commentary.\\" * Talk show: A television show in which one person (or a group of people) discuss various topics put forth by a talk show host. Usually, guests on a talk show consist of a group of people who are learned or who have great experience in relation to whatever issue is being discussed on the show for that particular episode. ** Tabloid talk show: A tabloid talk show is a subgenre of the talk show genre. On this type of talk show, the host invites either a guest or a group of guests to discuss provocative topics. Such topics can range from marital infidelity to more outlandish topics. Additionally, the guests are encouraged to make public confessions, and even resolve their issues via on-camera \\"group therapy.\\" * Television documentary: A genre of television programming that broadcasts documentaries. * Variety show: Also known as variety arts or variety entertainment, this is an entertainment made up of a variety of acts (hence the name), especially musical performances and sketch comedy, and normally introduced by a comp√®re (master of ceremonies) or host. Other types of acts include magic, animal and circus acts, acrobatics, juggling and ventriloquism. Variety shows were a staple of anglophone television from its early days into the 1970s, and lasted into the 1980s. In several parts of the world, variety TV remains popular and widespread. =Other television-related topics= * Specialty channels are commercial broadcasting or non-commercial television channel that focus on a single genre, subject, or targeted television market at a specific demographic. The number of specialty channels has increased during the 1990s and 2000s while the previously common concept of countries having just a few (national) TV stations addressing all interest groups and demographics became increasingly outmoded, as it already had been for some time in several countries. About 65% of today's satellite channels are specialty channels. Video game genres Genres in video games are somewhat different from other forms of art as most video game genres are based on the way in which the player interacts with the game. All genres from all other types of media can be applied to video games but are secondary to the genre types described below. Genres unique to video games: * Arcade games: ** Classic/Vintage: Usually associated with arcade games like Pac-Man, most of these games typically require the player to navigate a maze or other obstacle. * Shooter: Where the main purpose is to fight using guns. ** First-person shooter (FPS): A variant of the shooting game. In the game, the camera is actually in place of the character's eyes, so that you are playing the game from the character's view, looking down the barrel of a gun. *** Massively multiplayer online First-person shooter (MMOFPS): An online gaming genre set in a persistent world with a large number of simultaneous players in a first-person shooter fashion. These games provide large-scale, sometimes team-based combat. ** Third-person shooter: A shooting game where the camera angle is actually hovering behind the playable character as you play. * Strategy: A game centered around controlling or commanding an army or other large group of characters. Gameplay is centered around getting them to perform tasks or build structures so as to increase their power or numbers. Often the player's opponent has an army of their own, and in order to win the player needs to use their abilities in a strategic way so as to capture rival territory or destroy enemy structures. ** Real-time strategy (RTS): Where everybody moves at the same time, and races to think of a better strategy than the other players. Most of these video games are about military. *** Massively multiplayer online real-time strategy (MMORTS): A Real Time Strategy game that is played online. Many players can sign on a play at the same time, creating empires and battling each other. ** Turn-based strategy: Where everybody takes turns. Once everybody has placed their units and military characters in the right spot they can't move again until the next turn begins. This structure is prominently used in RPGs. ** Tower defense: Where the goal is to defend a player's territories or possessions by obstructing the enemy attackers, usually achieved by placing defensive structures on or along their path of attack. * Musical: Where music is usually played. To win, the players must match the rhythm of the music by pushing the right button combination until their opponents are unable to keep up with them. Not to be confused with the stage musical or musical film, which are stories that feature characters singing about the events in the plot. * Simulation: Where you must manage and develop fictitious business. For example, in a game you might be asked to manage and build a zoo, and the game simulates this for you in as accurate a way as possible. ** Simulation shooter: Features the basic mechanics of a shooter, where using a gun is the primary method of gameplay, but emphasizes realism, often incorporating features like ballistics and realistic character damage. ** Simulation strategy: A strategy game that emphasizes realism, such as the Total War series of games, usually focusing on a specific time and location in human history, such as the Roman Empire. * Puzzle: Where you must solve puzzles to progress through the levels. * Party: Mostly suitable for multiple players and social gatherings. In most of these, the player or players compete or cooperate in smaller games, or minigames, within the main game. Mario Party popularized this genre. * Platformer: Centers around jumping and climbing in order for the player to navigate the environment and avoid obstacles. These games tend to feature much uneven terrain, vertical environments, and player characters able to jump many times their own height. The Super Mario and Sonic the Hedgehog franchises are some of the most well-known examples of the platformer genre. * Fighting: Where two or more playable characters fight. Each character usually has their own unique moves, and the goal of the game, usually, is to be the last man standing. Mortal Kombat and Street Fighter are generally credited with popularizing the fighting game. * Racing game: Either in the first-person or third-person perspective, in which the player partakes in a racing competition with any type of land, air, or sea vehicles. They may be based on anything from real-world racing leagues to entirely fantastical settings. In general, they can be distributed along a spectrum anywhere between hardcore simulations along the lines of Gran Turismo, and simpler arcade racing games such as Need for Speed. Racing games may also fall under the category of sports games. * Role-playing game (RPG): A game that is not (necessarily) about combat. It is a game where the player plays a character, and goes around pretending to be a real person in a fictitious world. This is also similar to non-video game forms of gaming that involve roleplaying, including play by post gaming and tabletop roleplaying games. The most exemplary of this genre are the Pok√©mon and Final Fantasy franchises. ** Massive multiplayer online role playing game (MMORPG): Similar to a regular Role Playing Game, but it is a multiplayer game played via the internet. During this game, thousands of players from around the world can play the same game at the same time and chat with each other. Players sign onto the game and complete quests while exploring the virtual world. Many MMORPGs are free to play by just signing up on the specific game site and downloading the game file but some require a monthly fee. ** Sandbox or Open World Game: Where the object of the game is to dominate a virtual system (often a simulated natural system), wherein enjoyment is derived through self-expression imposed upon the virtual system. An example is Minecraft. * Sports games: Games that simulate playing real-life sports. * Survival/horror: The player is placed in a horrifying situation of which they must escape. The major emphasis of most survival horror games is placed upon tension and a truly terrifying or grisly scenario. Puzzle-solving is a major characteristic of the genre. Examples of survival horror games include the Resident Evil, Silent Hill and Clock Tower series. * Stealth: The player must proceed through an environment or complete an objective without being seen, as in the Metal Gear series of games. Music genres * Break up music: is music produced specifically to accommodate the end of a relationship. * Gospel music: is a music genre in Christian music. * Medieval music: Music composed from around the middle of the 5th century to the middle of the 15th century, largely characterized by monophonic and polyphonic music. * Renaissance music: largely composed from the middle of the 15th century to around 1600. * Baroque music: composed from around 1600 to the middle of the 18th century. Much Baroque music is written in the form of dance suites. * Classical: Music that was composed from around the middle of the 18th century until the early 19th century. The key musical forms were the symphony, the concerto, and the sonata. Also includes some more recently written music (Neo-classical) that contains many of the same musical elements. * Romantic: composed from the early 19th century to about 1900, which emphasized dramatic themes and subject matter. Also includes more recently written music (Neo-romantic) that contains similar musical elements. * 20th- century music: A wide classification of music composed in the 20th century. This music deals largely with sound experimentation and moving away from the traditional tendencies of tonality. * Opera, Operette and Zarzuela * Folk (traditional): adaptations of old stories that were passed from generation to generation. Considered somewhat more niche now. Also see Neofolk, Folk Noir, Pagan Folk. * Bluegrass: is a form of American roots music, with roots in the English, Irish, and Scottish traditional music, a notable blues and jazz influence and a high lonesome sound, being later influenced by the music of African-Americans. Unlike country music, bluegrass is mostly accompanied by acoustic stringed instruments. * Country music: American popular music that began in the rural regions of the Southern United States in the 1920s. It takes its roots from southeastern American folk music and Western music. Blues modes have been used extensively throughout its recorded history. Country music often consists of ballads and dance tunes with generally simple forms and harmonies accompanied by mostly string instruments such as banjos, electric and acoustic guitars, fiddles, and harmonicas. The term country music gained popularity in the 1940s in preference to the earlier term hillbilly music; it came to encompass Western music, which evolved parallel to hillbilly music from similar roots, in the mid-20th century. The term country music is used today to describe many styles and subgenres. In 2009 country music was the most listened to rush hour radio genre during the evening commute, and second most popular in the morning commute in the United States. * Rock: originated from folk and blues. It used newer electrical instruments instead of relying solely on the classical woodwinds and stringed instruments. It first became popular in the mid-20th century because of famous bands like The Beatles and The Rolling Stones. ** Heavy metal: Similar to rock, and generally considered a subgenre of it. It usually uses the same electrical instruments, but the music is more intense and less \\"pop\\" in style (see below) such as Black Sabbath, Judas Priest, Iron Maiden and Metallica. ** Punk rock: developed between 1974 and 1976 in the United States, the United Kingdom, and Australia. Rooted in garage rock and other forms of what is now known as protopunk music, punk rock bands eschewed the perceived excesses of mainstream 1970s rock. Includes work by The Adverts, the Sex Pistols and The Clash. * Pop: once referred to any popular music during the time period, though the term has slowly gained use as a more specific (yet still somewhat vague) genre descriptor for music with a catchy, relatively consistent melody, among other aspects. It is commonly placed as having started in the mid-20th century, alongside rock music. Much dance music falls under this genre, and much modern rock music is considered to include elements of it as well, since bands such as the Beatles were a significant stylistic influence on what is now considered pop. * Rhythm and blues (R&B;): an evolving range of genres of popular African-American music that first began to develop in the early 20th century. ** Blues: A somewhat somber, quieter style of music whose name refers to the unhappiness of the performer. These became popular in the early 20th century alongside jazz, and influenced the early development of rock music. A major genre within R&B;, and one of its earliest genres as well. ** Hip hop: more rhythmically based, mostly African-American urban-derived genres, with a wide array of subgenres between them. ** Funk: A intense groovy style of music popular in the mid 20th century that contributed to the development of disco. ** Jazz: originated at the beginning of the 20th century in African American communities in the Southern United States from a confluence of African and European music traditions. Jazz has, from its early 20th-century inception, spawned a variety of subgenres, from New Orleans Dixieland dating from the early 1910s, big band-style swing from the 1930s and 1940s, bebop from the mid-1940s, a variety of Latin jazz fusions such as Afro-Cuban and Brazilian jazz from the 1950s and 1960s, jazz-rock fusion from the 1970s and late 1980s developments such as acid jazz, which blended jazz influences into funk and hip-hop. * Electronic music: employs electronic musical instruments and electronic music technology in its production. It consists of a number of separate genres, many of which are still evolving. One major category within this form of music is electronic dance music (EDM), with its own multitude of genres and subgenres, which is primarily associated with the dance and club scene. ** Breakbeat: usually characterized by the use of a 4/4 drum pattern (as opposed to the steady beat of house or trance). Includes work by Afrika Bambaataa, Davy DMX, Music Instructor and Bomfunk MC's. ** Drum and Bass or Jungle: emerged in the late 1980s and is characterized by fast breaks and basslines. Includes work by Roni Size, Chase & Status and London Elektricity. ** Ambient: focuses on the timbral characteristics of sounds, particularly organised or performed to evoke an \\"atmospheric\\", \\"visual\\" or \\"unobtrusive\\" quality. ** Downtempo: a laid-back style similar to ambient music, but usually with a beat or groove unlike the beatless forms of Ambient music. ** Electro: directly influenced by the use of TR-808 and funk records. Includes work by Kraftwerk, Zapp and Hashim. ** Glitch: described as a genre that adheres to an \\"aesthetic of failure,\\" where the deliberate use of glitch-based audio media, and other sonic artifacts. ** House: originated in Chicago, Illinois, US in the late 1970s and early 1980s; includes work by Fedde Le Grand and Frankie Knuckles. ** Eurobeat: two styles of dance music that originated in Europe: one is a UK variant of Euro disco influenced by dance-pop, and the other is a Hi-NRG-driven form of Italo disco. Both developed in the 1980s. ** Synthwave: influenced by 1980s film soundtracks and video games, using basslines and leads from an analog synthesizer. It expresses nostalgia for 1980s culture and its advancement towards the future, attempting to capture the era's atmosphere and celebrate it. Includes work by Kavinsky, Electric Youth and Power Glove. ** Trance: generally characterized by a tempo of between approximately 128 and 150 BPM, melodic synthesizer phrases, and a musical form that is progressive as it builds up and down throughout a track. Includes work by Svenson & Gielen, Cosmic Gate, PBK, Rank 1 and ATB. ** Techno: emerged in Detroit, Michigan, US during the mid-to-late 1980s. Includes work by Tomcraft, Leftfield and Moby. ** UK Garage: generally connected to the evolution of house in the United Kingdom from early/mid-1990s. Includes work by T2, The Artful Dodger and Shanks & Bigfoot. * Reggae: first developed in Jamaica in the late 1960s. While sometimes used in a broader sense to refer to most types of Jamaican music, the term reggae more properly denotes a particular music style that originated following on the development of ska and rocksteady. Reggae is based on a rhythmic style characterized by accents on the off-beat, known as the skank. Reggae is normally slower than ska. Reggae usually accents the second and fourth beat in each bar. Reggae song lyrics deal with many subjects, including religion, love, sexuality, peace, relationships, drugs, poverty, injustice and other social and political issues. * Calypso: developed in the mid-20th century out of Kaiso music. The genre became a worldwide hit in the 1950s when the 1956 album titled Calypso was the first full-length record to sell more than a million copies. * Merengue: first developed in the Dominican Republic in the mid-19th century and has become very popular since then. The style of the genre uses the accordion usually as the lead instrument, the guitar and/or saxophone as the melody, tambora and g√ºira percussion instruments and at intivals the marimba usually joining the combination.

A cryogenic storage dewar (named after James Dewar) is a specialised type of vacuum flask used for storing cryogens (such as liquid nitrogen or liquid helium), whose boiling points are much lower than room temperature. Cryogenic storage dewars may take several different forms including open buckets, flasks with loose-fitting stoppers and self-pressurising tanks. All dewars have walls constructed from two or more layers, with a high vacuum maintained between the layers. This provides very good thermal insulation between the interior and exterior of the dewar, which reduces the rate at which the contents boil away. Precautions are taken in the design of dewars to safely manage the gas which is released as the liquid slowly boils. The simplest dewars allow the gas to escape either through an open top or past a loose-fitting stopper to prevent the risk of explosion. More sophisticated dewars trap the gas above the liquid, and hold it at high pressure. This increases the boiling point of the liquid, allowing it to be stored for extended periods. Excessive vapour pressure is released automatically through safety valves. The method of decanting liquid from a dewar depends upon its design. Simple dewars may be tilted, to pour liquid from the neck. Self-pressurising designs use the gas pressure in the top of the dewar to force the liquid upward through a pipe leading to the neck.  Safety  Cryogens present several safety hazards and storage vessels are designed to reduce the associated risk. Firstly, no dewar can provide perfect thermal insulation and the cryogenic liquid slowly boils away, which yields an enormous quantity of gas. For example, the expansion ratio of cryogenic argon from the boiling point to ambient is 1 to 847, liquid hydrogen 1 to 851, liquid helium 1 to 757, liquid nitrogen 1 to 696, and liquid oxygen 1 to 860; Neon has the highest expansion ratio with 1 to 1438.Cryogenic liquids- characteristics In dewars with an open top, the gas simply escapes into the surrounding area. However, very high pressures can build up inside sealed dewars, and precautions are taken to minimise the risk of explosion. One or more pressure-relief valves allow gas to vent away from the dewar whenever the pressure becomes excessive. In an incident in 2006 at Texas A&M; University, the pressure-relief devices of a tank of liquid nitrogen were sealed with brass plugs. As a result, the tank failed catastrophically and exploded.http://www.tdi.texas.gov/fire/documents/fmred022206.pdf If a dewar is left open to the air for extended periods, atmospheric chemicals can condense or freeze on contact with the cryogenic material. This can introduce contaminants. If these materials freeze, for example, water vapor becoming ice, they can block the openings, leading to pressure buildup and the risk of an explosion. The gas escaping from a dewar can gradually displace the oxygen from the air in the surrounding area, which presents an asphyxiation hazard. Users are trained to store dewars only in a well-ventilated area and before transporting dewars in an elevator, the excess gas pressure is vented away and the dewars are sent unaccompanied to their destination.http://esh- docdb.fnal.gov/cgi-bin/RetrieveFile?docid=369  References  Category:Vacuum flasks Category:Cryogenics Category:Industrial gases Category:Laboratory equipment ","title":"Cryogenic storage dewar"},{"id":"27053110","text":"A haystack made with rice, lentils, cheese, veggies, and lemon sauce In the United States, a haystack is a dish composed of a starchy food (Fritos, tortilla chips, rice, or saltine crackers), topped by a protein (beans, grated cheddar cheese, taco-seasoned meat or meat alternative), in combination with fresh vegetables (shredded lettuce, tomatoes, olives, peppers), and garnished with various condiments (guacamole, sour cream, Ranch, and/or salsa). Haystacks are conceptually like a deconstructed tostada. The haystacks ingredients are served individually and assembled on the plate by the person who will be eating it. History Haystacks are composed of relatively small amounts of many ingredients, in flexible combinations, so they are well suited to serving large numbers of people at a low cost. The flexibility and crowd- pleasing nature of haystacks have made them a popular family and small-group choice for at least 60 years. Currently, haystacks are commonly used among three distinct North American religious subcultures. Composition =Adventist haystacks= Seventh-day Adventist haystacks begin with a corn chip base, often Fritos, though larger, restaurant style chips are often used as well, which are typically crushed with the heel of the hand, followed by beans, and grated cheddar cheese. Lettuce, vegetables, and condiments, especially salsa, are typically added last. Many Adventists are vegetarians, and most official or semi-official Adventist cultural dining events are vegetarian, which is one reason haystacks are so popular with this group. Often a soy-based ground hamburger meat alternative is used as an additional haystack ingredient. Haystacks are a common and iconic feature of after- service meals or potlucks, served either at church or in member's homes. A Seventh-day Adventist named Ella May Hartlein is credited with coming up with the recipe for this version of haystacks in the early 1950s, when she and her family craved Tostadas and could not find a Mexican restaurant close to their home. =Mennonite haystacks= The Amish haystack has less of a Mexican influence, and is less often vegetarian. The Amish haystack is built on a lettuce base, with crushed chips or crackers sprinkled on top, followed by cooked hamburger in tomato, spaghetti-like sauce. The haystack is finished with chopped vegetables, cheese, and any desired condiments. Amish haystacks tend to be associated with community fundraisers for families in need, as opposed to the Adventist haystacks, which are more associated with after- service shared community meals or \\"potlucks.\\" =The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints haystacks= In the community associated with the church, these are better known as Hawaiian haystacks, so named for their frequent use of pineapple chunks as a topping. In contrast to the Mexican notes characteristic of the Adventist haystack, Mormon or Hawaiian haystacks are characterized by Asian notes, perhaps a function of the long-time presence of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints in Hawaii. Hawaiian haystacks use a white rice base, covered by small pieces of chicken in a sauce or gravy. They are topped by a variety of items, often including the eponymous pineapple chunks, cheddar cheese, celery, tomatoes, sliced almonds, coconut, and chow mein noodles for crunch. Hawaiian haystacks are particularly popular in Utah and other western states where there is a high percentage of members of the church. Commonly served at church potlucks, Hawaiian haystacks are part of what is sometimes referred to as \\"Mormon Cooking\\", which also includes such dishes as pretzel jello salad, funeral potatoes and frogeye salad.

Li had been asked to write a song for the film soundtrack, but she was initially reluctant to commit to the project. After seeing an early screening of the film, she decided she wanted to contribute to the soundtrack. Following the soundtrack's release on 16 October 2009, \\"Possibility\\" charted at number fifty-nine on the Swedish Singles Chart for the week of 4 December 2009, based on download sales from the album. The song was also featured in the season one finale of the ABC sitcom Suburgatory, originally aired 16 May 2012. Background and writing Li commented on the song in an October 2009 interview with MTV News, saying, \\"Everyone kept asking me if I wanted to do it, how [the song] was going, when would I have it finished, and I was like, 'Eh, I don't know, maybe I'll do it, maybe I won't.' I mean, I had heard of the Twilight phenomenon, but I didn't read the books or watch the first movie or anything. I mean, I'm Swedish.\\" She also added, \\"I stayed [in Los Angeles] and watched the movie, when it only had green screen on it. I had this hook in my mind, even before I saw the movie, and then I was watching it, and I was like, 'That's the hook!' So it was very much like a discovery, inside myself and musically. I had this song growing inside of me that I had to get out, and [the film] was the trigger. Because I really connected with Bella and Edward's tortured love story.\\" The following year, in December 2010, Li told The Guardian: \\"I was sitting in a car in England [when I got the call] eating a sandwich from Tesco, and I had no idea what Twilight was. Somebody explained it as this thing about vampires and I'm like, 'I hate vampires.' But when I thought about it, there are so few pop culture things today, where people are really crazy about something, like Beatlemania, so I thought, how cool to be part of something that so many young, open hearts listen to.\\" Critical reception \\"Possibility\\" was well received by music critics. Todd Martens wrote for the Los Angeles Times that Li \\"could melt the coldest of hearts with this sparse tearjerker. A slight scratch in her vocals cuts through the song's intimately innocent feel. 'Tell me when you hear my heart stop,' she sings, while a backing choir inflects the sparse piano with gospel undertones‚Äîa brief, largely a cappella prayer.\\" Dose magazine referred to the song as \\"one of the more gripping mope-outs on the disc. The Swedish pop-singer coos in a cracked-with-emotion whisper, accompanied by a barely-there piano, as she pines for a lover.\\" Consequence of Sound critic Anthony Balderrama noted that Li \\"channels some of the more intimate moments of her short career on 'Possibility'. It evokes the vulnerability she's so good at cooing, just as she did in the simple 'Time Flies' and 'Tonight' off of [her album] Youth Novels. At five minutes, the locomotive rhythm and clunky piano borders on plodding, but the overall effect is so depressing that it works better than it should.\\" IndieLondon rated the song four out of five, stating it is \\"as beautiful and haunting as we've come to expect from this Swedish performer... and perfectly ethereal to accompany staring out the window at a snowy landscape. If it wasn't essential beforehand, it damn sure is now!\\" Marc Hogan of Pitchfork Media commented that the \\"feedback-streaked piano ballad 'Possibility' is a relative bright spot, but like the rest of the tracks [on the soundtrack], it pales in comparison to the work on her own records.\\" Krista Richmond of KillerFilm called the song \\"lovely in its haunted, enchanting way\\" and added that it is \\"soft and melodic enough to pull at even the toughest of heartstrings\\". MusicRadar's Joe Bosso opined that \\"[t]his stark, piano-based hymn is spiritual stuff, and Li's arresting vocal powers will have you on your knees in worship.\\" Adam Pfleider of AbsolutePunk expressed that \\"Lykke Li is where the problem of the soundtrack lies. I can't listen to this music without thinking of where it will end up in the melodrama of some teenager metamorphosing into a CGI werewolf. 'Possibility' is a beautiful song, but I can't help feeling its placement in the film would kill its blossoming melody in the end.\\" In December 2009, the song was announced as one of the sixty-three songs to be shortlisted for the Best Original Song category at the 82nd Academy Awards, but did not make it to the final list. Music video The music video for \\"Possibility\\" consists of Li's live performance of the song at Stockholm's Decibel Studios on 9 March 2010, and was directed by Marcus Palmqvist and Frode Fjerdingstad. The singer posted the video on her official website on 18 March 2010‚Äîcoinciding with her twenty-fourth birthday‚Äî, saying: > Here you go, Internet. The first live performance EVER of this song. An > homage to an idea lost in the fire.

The tribute penny was the coin that was shown to Jesus when he made his famous speech \\"Render unto Caesar...\\" The phrase comes from the King James Version of the gospel account: Jesus is asked, \\"Is it lawful to give tribute to Caesar, or not?\\" (Mark ) and he replies, \\"bring me a penny, that I may see it\\" (). The Pharisee or \\"spy\\" asking Jesus whether to pay Roman taxes/tribute is attempting to entrap him into admitting his opposition to doing so. But Jesus also opposes Roman coinage and the money given by Rome to colluders like the Pharisees. So upon seeing that the coin is a \\"tribute penny\\", Jesus avoids the trap by saying to give it back to Caesar, because it is his anyway. The Tribute Money, by Titian (1516), depicts Jesus being shown the tribute penny The Greek text uses the word dƒìnarion,Thayer's Lexicon: Œ¥Œ∑ŒΩŒ¨œÅŒπŒøŒΩ and it is usually thought that the coin was a Roman denarius with the head of Tiberius. It is this coin that is sold and collected as the \\"tribute penny\\", and the Gospel story is an important factor in making this coin attractive to collectors. The inscription reads \\"Ti[berivs] Caesar Divi Avg[vsti] F[ilivs] Avgvstvs\\" (\\"Caesar Augustus Tiberius, son of the Divine Augustus\\"), claiming that after death Augustus had become a god. The reverse shows a seated female, usually identified as Livia depicted as Pax. However, it has been suggested that denarii were not in common circulation in Judaea during Jesus' lifetime and that the coin was more probably an Antiochan tetradrachm bearing the head of Tiberius, with Augustus on the reverse. Another suggestion often made is the denarius of Augustus with Gaius and Lucius on the reverse, while coins of Julius Caesar, Mark Antony and Germanicus are all considered possibilities. A similar episode occurs in the Gospel of Thomas (verse 100), but there the coin in question is gold.

To the south, the block is bounded by the Garlock Fault. The northern bound is not well defined at present, but generally runs along a line extending across the northern Sacramento Valley. The SNGV has been found to behave like a rigid body relative to the North American Plate to which it is somewhat loosely attached, for this reason it is sometimes referred to as Sierra Nevada microplate. The block moves in a northwest direction while the rest of the North American Plate is moving in a southwest direction. In far northern California, this produces a zone of convergence which has resulted in the compressive uplift of the Coast Ranges. At its core, the SNGV block consists primarily of the Sierra Nevada batholith which has been tilted westward like a large trapdoor with its \\"hinge\\" lying deep beneath the sediments which fill California's Central Valley. This tilt is attributed to the buoyancy of the eastern part of the block due to the greater subterranean heat associated with the tectonics of the adjacent Great Basin, compounded by the weight of sediments accumulating over the western portion of the block. A major feature of the block clearly visible from space and on topographical maps is the Kern Canyon Fault which is regarded as a fracture resulting from differences in the stresses affecting the southern section of the block.

He has been appointed to serve as a judge of the Connecticut Superior Court. Family life Roraback was born March 29, 1960, in Torrington, Connecticut. He is the cousin of the late Catherine Roraback, a civil rights attorney in Connecticut best known for representing Estelle Griswold and Dr. C. Lee Buxton in the 1965 Supreme Court case Griswold v. Connecticut, which legalized the use of birth control in Connecticut and created the precedent of the right to privacy. Roraback is married to Kara Dowling and they reside with their son Andrew Kevin in Goshen.

Aircraft in the formation from top to bottom are P-51D Mustang, P-47D Thunderbolt, F-4G Phantom II, and F-22A Raptor USAF Heritage Flight at the Fort Worth Alliance Air Show, consisting of a Douglas A-1 Skyraider, a General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon, a Lockheed Martin F-22 Raptor, and a North American P-51 Mustang USAF Heritage Flight is short for the United States Air Force Heritage Flight. It was created in 1997 to celebrate the 50th Anniversary of the United States Air Force. It incorporates fighters from World War II, the Vietnam War, the Korean War and other conflicts in which the USAF has been involved. The USAF Heritage Flight formation will normally consist of two or more aircraft representing the different eras of operations, making three passes past the spectators. There will be one pass each from the right and left and then a final pass from behind the crowd with the aircraft performing a separation maneuver to create separation between the aircraft followed a few seconds later by a single simultaneous aileron roll by all the aircraft in the flight. During the flypasts there is a musical accompaniment played through the public address system. The music that is normally played is \\"We Remember\\" by Dwayne O'Brian. After the roll maneuver each of the aircraft will then enter the airfield traffic pattern, typically performing an individual pass before the crowd and then \\"pitching out\\" into an approach pattern and landing. The specifics of the performance such as the roll and individual pass and landing may be modified by the weather and whether or not the local runway can safely handle the aircraft (adequate runway length) and if the airport has proper ground support equipment available..

Operational F-4 Phantoms discontinued participation in Heritage Flights after the type's retirement from the United States Air Force in the late 1990s, however the QF-4E Target Drone variant of the F-4 did participate in Heritage Flights (as well as solo demonstrations) up until 2012 when the aircraft were no longer available. The F-15C Eagle remained a popular heritage flight aircraft until 2007 when the F-15 East Coast Demonstration Team was disbanded due to cost issues and the advent of the newly formed F-22 Raptor Demonstration Team. All other USAF Single Ship Demonstration Teams were grounded in 2013 due to Sequestration in Congress which resulted in extensive budget cuts in the Military, The US Military confirmed its to Air Show and Heritage Flight Participation in January 2014 with the F-22 Raptor apparently being the only Air Combat Command aircraft confirmed for air show appearances which include tactical demonstrations and heritage flights, however in March 2014 Air Combat Command confirmed that the F-16 will also be featured in 2014 air shows being restricted to abbreviated 3-pass demonstrations as well as Heritage Flights. It is unclear whether the F-15E or A-10 will also return to Heritage Flights and with the A-10s recently announced retirement due to begin in 2015 it is unlikely that it will be featured at airshows again, while there has been no news that the still active F-15E will participate. In 2015 the F-16 will do heritage flights as well as full demos. As of 2016, the F-35 will do heritage flights as well, but no full demos. According to the International Council of Airshows, in 2019 the F-35 will commence doing full demos as well as heritage flights. The A-10 will return to the airshow circuit for 2019, but it is unclear whether it will participate in heritage flights. In 2019 the A-10 resumed participation in heritage flights, bringing the total of modern USAF aircraft participating to four.

There was concern about the deteriorating situation in Tajikistan, and the Security Council emphasised the need for the parties concerned to uphold their agreements. The situation would only be resolved through political means between the Government of Tajikistan and the United Tajik Opposition and it was their primary responsibility to do so. The resolution also stressed the unacceptability of hostile acts on the border with Afghanistan. The parties were called to end hostilities and comply with the Tehran Agreement, strongly urging the extension of a ceasefire during the inter-Tajik talks. UNMOT's mandate was extended until 15 December 1996 on the condition that the Tehran Agreement and the ceasefire remained in force. The role of the United Nations in the country would be reviewed if there were no prospects for peace during the mandate period. Every three months, the Secretary-General was requested to report on the implementation of the Tehran Agreement and the progress and operations of UNMOT.

She identifies as pansexual and is the first MP of Palestinian descent. Moran attended private schools in Brussels, Kingston in Jamaica and Roedean School in Brighton. She studied at Imperial College London and Brunel University London, and worked as a maths and physics teacher. Moran unsuccessfully campaigned as the Liberal Democrat candidate in Battersea at the 2010 general election and in the West Central constituency at the 2012 London Assembly election. Moran contested Oxford West and Abingdon at the 2015 general election, coming second. She was selected for the seat again at the 2017 general election and was elected to the House of Commons, defeating Conservative MP Nicola Blackwood, with 26,256 votes (43.7%) and a majority of 816. She served as the Liberal Democrat spokesperson for the Department for Education under three leaders from 2017 to 2020, and was spokesperson for the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport from 2019 to 2020. After Jo Swinson lost her seat at the 2019 general election, Moran stood to become Leader of the Liberal Democrats in the 2020 leadership election, which she lost to Acting Leader Sir Ed Davey. On 31 August 2020, Davey appointed Moran as the Liberal Democrats' Shadow Foreign Secretary and as International Development Spokesperson the following day. Early life and career Layla Michelle Moran was born in Hammersmith on 12 September 1982, the elder daughter of diplomat James Moran and Randa Moran, a Christian Palestinian from Jerusalem. Her great-grandfather was the Palestinian writer Wasif Jawhariyyeh, who published extensive memoirs. Moran describes herself as a British Palestinian. On her upbringing, Moran said \\"My Palestinian background has made me interested at a global level. Politics was always at the dinner table, it primed me to engage.\\" Moran was raised as a cultural Christian and now identifies as a humanist.HSLD 2020 Leadership Contest Interviews: Layla Moran MP - Interviewed, Wednesday 15th July 2020 by Toby Keynes, HSLD Chair. Retrieved 27 August 2020. Because her father was a diplomat for the European Union and its predecessors, Moran grew up in various countries, including Belgium, Greece, Ethiopia, Jamaica and Jordan. She attended private schools in Brussels, Kingston in Jamaica and Roedean School in Brighton. From 2000 to 2003, she studied physics at Imperial College London, and from 2005 to 2007 completed a PGCE at Brunel University London. From 2007 to 2008, she studied for a master's degree in comparative education at UCL's Institute of Education. From 2003 to 2012, Moran was a maths and physics teacher at the International School of Brussels, and at two schools in London: Queensmead School and Southbank International School. Between 2009 and 2013 she worked as a part-time course tutor for Oxford Study Courses, a company that helps International Baccalaureate teachers and students, and from 2013 she was full-time academic manager. Political career Moran was selected as the Liberal Democrat candidate for Battersea at the 2010 general election and came in third place. She also stood as a candidate for the West Central constituency in the 2012 London Assembly election, coming fourth. Moran contested Oxford West and Abingdon at the 2015 general election, coming second. She was selected for the seat again at the 2017 general election and won the seat from Nicola Blackwood, a Conservative who was then a junior minister for health, with 26,256 votes (43.7%) and a majority of 816. Moran became the first UK Member of Parliament of Palestinian descent and the first female Liberal Democrat MP from an ethnic minority background. In June 2017, Moran was named Liberal Democrat spokesperson for education, science and young people in the House of Commons. That month she used her maiden speech to call for fairer funding for schools, and in July 2017 she spoke out against the closure of all the Sure Start children's centres in Oxfordshire earlier in the year. Also in July 2017, Moran was jeered at for accusing the Conservatives of underfunding a new scheme to provide 30 hours of free child care for the children of working parents. Later in 2017 she was appointed a member of the Public Accounts Committee, which is responsible for overseeing government expenditure. In May 2019, Moran announced that, being a relatively new MP, she would not be running in the 2019 Liberal Democrats leadership election. She had been considered a frontrunner to replace Vince Cable as leader, following his announcement in September 2018 that he intended to step down from the post. At the 2019 general election she stood for re-election, increasing her majority to 8,943. In March 2020, Moran announced that she would be running in the 2020 leadership election. Moran finished in second place with 35.6% of the vote, losing to Ed Davey the Acting-Co Leader. Personal life In an interview with The Times, Moran stated that she suffered from depression when she was a student and attributed it to a negative self-image resulting from the social stigma of obesity. She underwent stomach-stapling surgery to assist her in losing weight. In 2013 Moran and her then boyfriend Richard Davis were briefly questioned by police, after she assaulted him during an argument in their hotel room at the Liberal Democrat Federal Conference. No charge was brought, but the relationship subsequently ended. In January 2020, Moran disclosed that she was in a stable relationship with Rosy Cobb, formerly a Liberal Democrat press officer. Cobb was suspended by the party during the previous general election over an accusation that she had forged an email.

It is the parish school for Our Lady of the Miraculous Medal Parish, also in Hampton. This school serves grades pre-kindergarten through eighth grade.  History  Sacred Heart School was founded in September 1963 for families attending Our Lady of the Miraculous Medal Parish. Initially, Sacred Heart School only served grades four and five. Each year it added one more grade until the first class graduated in 1967. Through the 1970s the school flourished, with a maximum enrollment of over 250 students. In 1984, Sacred Heart added a part-time kindergarten under the guidance of the new principal. In 1994 the kindergarten became full-time. Currently, there are 225 students enrolled in grades pre- kindergarten through eight. Its current principal is Teresa Morin-Bailey.

He produced a large amount of vocal music, including more than 150 songs and 40 anthems as well as a significant amount of carols and other choral works. He also produced a large number of choral arrangements of Ukrainian, Czech, and Icelandic folksongs; mainly written for Winnipeg choir director Walter Bohonos and his choirs. He used the pseudonyms Hugh Garland and Michael Bilencko for some of his published ballads and folksong arrangements, however, most of his works were published under the name W.H. Anderson. Some of his more well known compositions include the anthem Come, I Pray Thee; the songs Hospitality and To Immortality; the trio for female voices Sea Blue Gardens; and the Christmas pieces Ane Song for the Birth of Christ, Lullaby of the Little Angels and The World's Desire. Life and career Born in London, Anderson studied singing privately in his native city with Mattia Battistini and Manuel Garc√≠a and at the Guildhall School of Music and Drama. He served as a lay tenor at several notable churches in London, including St Paul's Cathedral, St Stephen Walbrook, and St. Paul's Church, Knightsbridge. In his early career he performed roles with the Moody-Manners Opera Company, sometimes using the name Wallace Anderson when performing. However, he mainly sang using his own name William. On 5 May 1903 he notably portrayed Monsieur Loustot in the London premiere of Andr√© Messager's V√©ronique with the composer conducting. Anderson's abandoned his singing career after suffering from chronic bouts with bronchitis. He was advised by his doctor to leave London for a drier climate, and accordingly left England for Canada in 1910 where he ultimately settled in Winnipeg. He became a celebrated singing teacher in that city; notably teaching such musicians as Herbert Belyea, Lorne Betts, Lloyd Blackman, Ronald Dodds, James Duncan, Reginald Hugo, Wallace Lewis, Morley Meredith, Maxine Miller, Gladys Whitehead, and Phyllis Worth. He was also a much admired choir director in Winnipeg, notably founding and directing both CNR Choral Society and The Choristers. He conducted the latter choir from 1936‚Äì1955; notably leading the ensemble in an annual series of national broadcasts for CBC Radio from 1942-1955. The group continued to perform for nearly 20 years after Anderson's death. He also held several church posts in Winnipeg, including serving as music director of St Andrew's River Heights United from 1934-1954. Anderson died in Winnipeg in 1955 at the age of 72. His son Jeffrey Anderson was a successful radio producer and music critic and his daughter Evelyne Anderson was a successful actress and soprano.

Services Among Spies Library's collections are books, audiobooks, downloadable digital audio and E-books, magazines, newspapers, CDs, videos, DVDs, CD-ROMs, and microfilm. It also offers free Internet and free Wi-Fi, as well as free programs each for patrons of all ages. The library's website provides access to the library catalog, over 50 commercial research databases through Michigan eLibrary, and other information resources. Special needs services provided by Spies Library include a text-to-speech reader, and large print for the visually impaired. Its literacy services include GED and ACT practice testing. History March 1903, Mr. and Mrs. Augustus Spies announced their plans to donate money to build and furnish a new Library that would bear their name. The Spies' selected the architectural firm of Patton & Miller from Chicago. This firm was the same firm that designed many Carnegie Libraries. Perhaps, this is why even today people think the Spies Public Library is a Carnegie Library. It was built in the style of a French country chateau and is an example of Beaux-Arts architecture. The actual bid for the building was awarded to the RM. Garthwait Co. of Chicago for $21,950. The remainder of the $30,000 Spies donated was spent on furnishings many of which are still being used today. The Spies Public Library was completed and dedicated on March 30, 1905. At the ceremony, Agustus Spies said, \\"That it will prove a source of much good to all is my greatest wish and desire.\\" When the library first opened it contained 5,184 volumes and 48 periodicals. Mrs. Gertrude B. Munger was the first librarian. During the first year of operation, 24,746 items were borrowed. Each year the circulation continued to grow as more citizens used the library. In 1918, a separate book collection was purchased to provide library service to all residents of the county. In compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act, the Spies Public Library was expanded to double its size. The dedication of the new and improved library was in April 1997.

Frederick C. Sauer (1860,Landmark Architecture of Allegheny County by James D. Van Trump and Arthur P. Ziegler, Jr., page 161 (1967, Pittsburgh History and Landmarks Foundation, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, ) Heidelberg, Grand Duchy of Baden ‚Äì 1942 Aspinwall, Pennsylvania, United States) was a German-American architect, particularly in the Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, region of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Sauer, a German-born immigrant to the United States, was a stonemason, bricklayer and carpenter while studying at Technical school in Wittenberg, before studying at Stuttgart. He moved to Pittsburgh from Germany in 1880, established a Pittsburgh office in 1884, established the Aspinwall-Delafield Land Company in 1904,Aspinwall 1892-1967, by Rachel Cook, 1967, ASIN: B0007JN4NE and built about a dozen Catholic churches in the area. Perhaps his most notable works are St. Stanislaus Kostka Church (1891) in the Strip District of Pittsburgh, St. Mary of the Mount Church (1896) on Mount Washington in Pittsburgh, Saint Mary Magdalene Church in Homestead (1895), Latimer School (1898) in East Allegheny on the North Side of Pittsburgh, the old St. Nicholas Croatian Catholic Church (1900) in Troy Hill, and the St. Nicholas Croatian Church in Millvale (1922). In 1898, Sauer built a home for himself in Aspinwall, Pennsylvania. After remodeling his chicken coop in an eccentric mode in 1928 and 1930, he gradually transformed a wooded hillside into an architectural fantasy, and a complex of castlesque buildings and landscape features in Fantastic architectural style gradually took shape and was progressively added to by Sauer until his death in 1942. The site is listed on the National Register of Historic Places as an historic district entitled the Sauer Buildings Historic District. \\"It is the most bizarre collection of buildings in Western Pennsylvania,\\" says Franklin Toker, professor of art and architecture at the University of Pittsburgh.

At Kenner's request, first appeared in Jos√© Luis Garc√≠a-L√≥pez's 1982 DC Comics Style Guide and had their first and only adventure in Super Jrs. Holiday Special: The Best of DC Blue Ribbon Digest #58 (March 1985) in a story written by Tom DeFalco and drawn by Vince Squeglia. There was a considerable amount of merchandise (toys, wallpapers, bed sheets and covers, furniture, flash cards, coloring books, etc.) based on them. Characters include \\"Jr.\\" versions of Superman (Super-Kid, Casey), Batman (Bat-Guy, Carlos) and Robin (Kid-Robin, the Shrimp), Wonder Woman (Wonder Tot, Deedee), Flash (Flash-Kid, Rembrandt), Green Arrow, Green Lantern, Hawkman, Aquaman and, later, Supergirl. In the Holiday Special, they are orphan youngsters from the Miss Piffle's Nursery School, transformed by the fairy spirit of Christmas into superheroes to stop the evil Wallace van Whealthy III, the Weather Wizard, a school bully super villain and rescue Santa Claus.  Wonder Tot  In Wonder Woman #105 (April 1959), Wonder Tot was introduced as Wonder Woman during her younger years. Through magic, the child was able to co-exist alongside her older self without any ramifications. Befriending Mister Genie (Genro), she would return infrequently over the years that followed in her own adventures.  The Girl Superbaby  In Action Comics #260 (January 1960), Supergirl is reduced in age when she comes into contact with a pool of water upon saving an old man.  The Babe of Steel  In several instances, Superman has been reduced to a youthful version of himself. In Action Comics #284 (January 1962), he purposely exposes himself to Red Kryptonite towards this effect to enter a small gap into the Phantom Zone. In the Super Friends: The Legendary Super Powers Show episode \\"Uncle Mxyzptlk\\" (1984), Superman is again exposed to Red Kryptonite and is de-aged, referred by his teammates as \\"Super Brat\\". For Superman/Batman #46, Silver Kryptonite made Superman act like a childish version of himself and observed those around him as children. Beginning in Superboy #8 (May 1950), the adventures of Superman during his youngest years were infrequently depicted with the hero identified as Superbaby. For DC Nation Shorts, „Çπ„Éº„Éë„Éº„Éû„É≥ @ Tokyo features a baby given Superman's powers upon wearing his cape as a diaper.  Bat-Baby  In Batman #147 (May 1962), a scientist transforms Batman's body into that of a four- year-old. In the Batman: The Brave and the Bold episode \\"The Malicious Mr. Mind!\\" (2011), Doctor Sivana uses a ray on Batman that sees him regress in age. In Mad #8 (December 1953-January 1954), Batman is parodied as a little person named Bat Boy with sidekick Rubin (in place of Robin). This story would later be adapted for the Batman: The Brave and the Bold episode \\"Bat-Mite Presents: Batman's Strangest Cases!\\" (2011). For DC Nation Shorts, Aardman Animations produced Batman shorts featuring a juvenile Batman and a likewise treatment of his cast of characters.  Superboy, Batboy, and Kid Flash  In Action Comics #466 (December 1976), Lex Luthor transforms Superman, Batman, and the Flash to juvenile versions of themselves.  Sins of Youth  During the events of Young Justice: Sins of Youth (2000), the Justice League, Justice Society of America, and several other adults are transformed into juvenile versions of themselves by Klarion the Witch Boy. These events would lead to the character Li'l Lobo to join Young Justice. The storyline was very loosely adapted by the Justice League television series in the episode \\"Kid Stuff\\" but rather than The Demon character Klarion transforming the League into younger versions of themselves, it was The Demon's Morgaine le Fey's son Mordred.  Lil' Leaguers  In the Superman/Batman arc Lil' Leaguers, a juvenile Justice League from a parallel world is introduced including Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman, Green Lantern, Flash, Red Arrow, Red Tornado, Supergirl, Vixen, Black Lightning, Zatanna, and Black Canary. Lil' villains from their world also appear in Lex Luthor, Joker, Doomsday, Catwoman, Two-Face, Cyborg Superman, Brainiac, Bizarro, Poison Ivy, Hush, Clayface, Killer Croc, and Mister Freeze. 2012's \\"The Curse of Superman\\" in Action Comics #9 formally introduced Earth 42, home to the Little League featuring juvenile versions of Aquaman, Batman, Cyborg, Green Arrow, Hawkman, Martian Manhunter, Steel, Superman, and Wonder Woman. The series Batman: Li'l Gotham was based on this Earth.  Secret Hero Society  Publisher Scholastic produces a series of children's books under the banner \\"Secret Hero Society\\" featuring DC Comic characters as youths coming together into their costumed personas as children.  Legion of Super- Babies  In Adventure Comics #338 (November 1965), the Time Trapper transformed several members of the Legion of Super-Heroes into youthful versions of themselves.

The Hurricane 103 and Ultra 103 designs are intended to have empty weights under and fit into the US FAR 103 ultralight category. The remaining designs are heavier and fit into the US Experimental - Amateur-built category. Development The Hurricane was originally developed as a clone of the Phantom X1 design by Jack Britton in the late 1980s and marketed under the name Avenger. Following Britton's death the design was acquired by Donnie Eccker who marketed it as the Hurricane. The aircraft was introduced to the market in 1991 and benefited from the end of production of the Phantom that same year. As a result of the timing, the quality of the kits produced and the low price, the aircraft quickly achieved market success. In 1996 the rights to the design along with the tooling were sold to Hy-Tek. The aircraft is no longer in production. Design As a copy of the Phantom X1, the Hurricane family shares its construction. The wings, tail and fuselage are constructed of anodized aluminum tubing, bolted together. The wings and tail surfaces are covered with Dacron envelopes. The wings are supported by cable-bracing from an inverted V-kingpost. The cockpit fairing, or pod, is made from fibreglass. The aircraft features tricycle landing gear. The engine is mounted on the front of the main tube, the tail being mounted on the far end of the same tube. The kit takes 80-100 hrs to assemble.

Before an organisation releases any new or changed application software into its operational environment, any such software should be fully tested and quality assured. The Definitive Media Library provides the storage area for software objects ready for deployment and should only contain master copies of controlled software media configuration items (CIs) that have passed appropriate quality assurance checks, typically including both procured and bespoke application and gold build source code and executables. In the context of the ITILShirley Lacy and Ivor Macfarlane (2007). ITIL Service Transition. The Stationery Office. . best practice framework, the term Definitive Media Library supersedes the term definitive software library referred to prior to version ITIL v3. In conjunction with the configuration management database (CMDB), it effectively provides the DNA of the data center i.e. all application and build software media connected to the CMDB record of installation and configuration. The Definitive Media Library (DML) is a primary component of an organisation's release and provisioning framework and service continuity plan. Background In a controlled IT environment it is crucial that only authorised versions of software are allowed into production. The consequences of unauthorised software versions finding their way into the live environment can be serious. Typically, in a mature organisation, stringent Change and Release Management processes will exist to prevent this occurring, but such processes require a place where the authorised software versions can be safely stored and accessed. The solution put forward by ITIL in its third version is called the Definitive Media Library or DML (replacing the previously named Definitive Software Library or DSL in version two). ITIL proposes that the DML can be either a physical or virtual store and there are benefits and drawbacks with either method. Clearly, however, there are key factors in the success of any DML solution i.e. software required to be deployed into production should be rigorously tested, assured and licensed to perform and also packaged in such a way that it will safely and consistently deploy. Also, the DML should be easily accessed by those, and only those, authorised to do so. In this way, a virtual (electronic) storage area will almost always provide a superior solution, meaning the DML can be centralised and accessed remotely or outside normal business hours if the need arises (see distribution). Scope The DML plays a critical role in supporting the transition from development to production phases and DML solutions should be distinguished from other software and source code repositories e.g. Software Configuration Management or SCM (sometimes referred to as Software Change and Configuration Management) that supports the development or software evolution phase. This is an important distinction and often causes some confusion. In essence, whereas SCM tools or repositories store and manage all development versions and revisions of code (or work products) up to but not including the final authorised product, the DML stores only the final authorised versions of the code or product. This is analogous to a high-street product lifecycle where the product moves from design house to factory, through to warehouse and then shop, i.e. *records (metadata) are kept about how a product is designed developed and built. This enables the tracking down of which process is to blame where faulty products are discovered either during quality control or even in later service. *records (metadata) are kept in a CMDB about where the software is installed and deployed from the DML and into the production environment. Each installation or deployment should be authorised by a corresponding production change request and the resulting change recorded in the CMDB as a relationship between the DML artefact and the platform where it has been deployed. In a more mature or evolved state there is no distinction drawn between the two forms of configuration management and the process is continuous supporting the whole service delivery and service operation lifecycle. This has been referred to as Enterprise Configuration Management. Even here though the development-based artefacts should still be distinguished from and kept separate from the management of quality assured, definitive master versions available for deployment. In an outsourced or multi-vendor arrangement the existence or otherwise of a consistent and secure form of supplier access will dictate whether or not the software configuration management is performed passively (externally by suppliers adopting their own SCM tools and then delivering the finished product) or actively (overseen internally with suppliers utilising the centrally hosted SCM tool). All finished products, however, (application software) in their authorised deployable form should be stored within the central DML. Typical CIs that a DML will store include: *Packaged in-house application software *Commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) raw media *Customised COTS software (containing enhancements, tailored configuration etc) *Release packages *Patches (see patch (computing)) *Gold builds (clients, servers, network and storage devices etc) *System images *Across multiple technology stacks and distribution technologies (e.g. Wintel, UNIX, ORACLE, mainframe, network, storage etc) Media Release Lifecycle (see \\"Definitive Media Library & CMDB in the context of the Release Management Process\\" diagram above) The media release lifecycle steps are: #Demand for new service or product arises. #Decision is made to make or buy the product (service, build or application) based on functional requirements extracted from the requirements traceability tool. Product is created or selected from the service/ product catalogue in accordance with architectural design policies (Service Design). COTS product is procured and stored in the DML with asset status ‚Äòprocured‚Äô. If new, the product is added to the Approved Products Catalogue. In-house created application source code is managed directly in the software configuration management repository. #If COTS product or gold build is being packaged, media is extracted from the DML. #Product is packaged or developed and packaged (in which case add-on functionality is treated in the same way as in-house applications and builds). #Stub records or original baselines are created in the software configuration management tool. #Development code revisions and package revisions are recorded in the software configuration management tool throughout development. #Unit testing is carried out. #Packaging is completed to create the release package. #Product package is quality assured (inc testing, staging and any rework). #Completed media package (build, service or application) is lodged back in the DML as authorised media ready for deployment. #Following Change Management approval, product is released to the estate via the appropriate distribution system with logical installations being recorded via due process in the CMS (CMDB). #DML entities are archived as soon as: ##CMS or CMDB indicates that packaged release is no longer in use at any location (a period of grace is required following the last decommission or upgrade to allow for any necessary regressions) and ##The DML entity has been removed from the technical or user (service) catalogue as a selectable item Distribution Even though the DML as an authorised store for media implies a degree of centralisation, Local Media Libraries (LMLs) will be required in order to achieve a global model. In this way, release and deployment of physical instances of media can be achieved in country in a timely manner by avoiding constant downloads over the global network. Replication of authorised media in non-prime windows would make required packages available locally as required, but the DML would remain as ‚Äòmaster‚Äô for process control reasons. The DML/LML hierarchy is synonymous with the master/secondary distribution layers seen within many distribution technologies and package management systems. However, whereas distribution tools tend to be biased towards a particular technology stack (e.g. Wintel, Unix, Mainframe etc), one of the main benefits of a DML is its technology- agnostic nature and a true central store for all authorised software. In this way, the distribution tools would connect to the DML to obtain the software package. Application packaging involves the preparation of standard, structured software installations targeted for automated deployment. Packaging is also required for bought-in (COTS) software, as packaging allows software to be configured to run efficiently on a particular platform or environment. Even a slight change in this platform (such as the swapping-out of disk) can prevent a package from successfully deploying so retention of the raw media (ISO) version of software is critical as this will be needed (often in an emergency) should the packaged version no longer deploy e.g. following the upgrade or replacement of the operating platform. Benefits The DML supports; * Release & Deployment Management as a foundation and the central storage area for all releasable deployment packages * Availability and Service Continuity by providing the source of all packaged applications and raw media for use in service restoration and Disaster recovery procedures * Automated server provisioning and rationalisation through the storage of gold builds * Asset Management by providing metadata records and licence keys relating to COTS software licence provision.

He is a modern-age one-man band with traditional (all live) style, utilizing electronic equipment, but without using any programmed, prerecorded or computer-generated music. Nakane's trademark is not a particular song, or even his unique sound, but his playing style that provides a complete musical entertainment, with comic flair, which has impressed many well-known people including Jack Black, Roseanne Barr and Andrae Crouch. (He doesn't consider himself musically gifted and professes that anybody can do what he can do as long as one has direction, determination and dedication.)\\"Almost Famous,\\" Robyn Norwood; Connie Monaghan; Joe Mathews; Josh Friedman; David Wharton; Jill Darling Richardson; Greg Braxton, Los Angeles Times, January 2, 2005 He sings over 1,000 songs of various genres including pop, rock, oldies (including 50 songs by Elvis and 40 by the Beatles), standard, traditional, folk, country/western, Latin, Hawaiian and Japanese. He sings in English, Japanese and Spanish. In addition, he is also known for his famous song,\\" Anderson is the Best,\\" where he made top 85 on America's Got Talent. He plays the electric guitar, a harmonica around his neck and an echo-miked kazoo that imitates the sound of saxophone. (He calls it \\"saxophony.\\") He uses three keyboards, which he plays with a stick attached to the neck of his guitar. He plays his handmade 25-key bass pedal board with his two feet. While playing the bass, he operates a tape recorder with his right foot, wearing a red sock to draw attention, to record his singing, then plays back to harmonize. He often utters some audience's names, usually with a high pitched voice, in order to demonstrate that it is on-the-spot recording. At times he also shakes a spring-loaded tambourine while strumming his guitar, and also maracas if needed for some Latin numbers. He strikes two cymbals with a drumstick attached at the end of his guitar to accentuate the set beat of a drum machine, which is the only thing that is automatic. He claims he can do seven of the above at one time if necessary. He often performs as a street performer at the Santa Monica Pier and Little Tokyo (the Japanese Village Plaza) in Los Angeles, California. He claims that he never wanted to become a professional musician: \\"I am an artist who happens to play music.\\" He was pushed into music business as he got married while going through college. As his own family grew almost every year (six children in nine years), he needed to buy a newly invented drum machine in 1970, in order to compete with other musicians who might take his jobs away. He claims he was one of the first five Southern California musicians who ever bought drum machines. Being embarrassed by the public calling him \\"one-man band\\", he decided to add another instrument or two so as not to fall short of their expectations. In 1972 he purchased an ARP synthesizer and customized it to play melody or bass with his feet. He also added harmonica to his repertoire. To his surprise people started to call him \\"one-man orchestra\\". In 1976 his current style was set. Also that year he finally graduated from California State University at Los Angeles and became a high school teacher. But his dismal salary as a math and shop teacher made him continue performing on weekends to support his wife Rosemarie and six children. In 1980 he was scouted by director/producer Francis Coppola for the movie One from the Heart although his segment, singing \\"America the Beautiful,\\" was not used because of some script changes. (A still photo of his performance appears in the bonus feature of the film's DVD.) He performed at the Los Angeles Street Scene Festival from 1984 until the event was abruptly terminated after 1987 because of a gang fight. In 1995 he started to perform on the Third Street Promenade in Santa Monica for wider exposure and was scouted to appear for the first time on national TV, \\"George (Hamilton) & Alana (Stuart)\\". He opened for the Everclear, who also saw him perform on the Promenade, when the alternative rock group appeared at the Roxy in Hollywood. His popularity at this three-day concert led to his participation of the Everclear's national tour (26 major cities) in 1996, receiving rave reviews.Hollywood Reporter, March 26, 1996; Los Angeles Times, August 2, 1996. He appeared on the worldwide Spanish TV show \\"Sevcec\\" (Telemundo) in 1996. In 2000, director Mike Sakamoto directed a short documentary film on Nakane, entitled \\"Secret Asian Man\\", which premiered at the Sundance Film Festival and along with the film his live performance received favorable reviews.Los Angeles Times, January 26, 2000\\"IMDB\\" In 2010, Nakane auditioned for the popular TV show \\"America's Got Talent (season 5)\\" with his one-man band act. He passed the preliminary auditions, competing with estimated 100,000 participants (17,000 acts) and went to Las Vegas as one of the top 85 acts. Since retiring from teaching in 1984, he has been serving as a professional Japanese translator as well. Nakane has translated several dozens of popular Japanese songs into English. He has also written dozens of inspirational stories from his experience as a one-man band, which he is planning to publish in near future. In 2013 Nakane fell at home and suffered a serious injury. He currently is unable to walk or hold any of instruments. Struggling to return, he has performed as a vocalist, but his one-man band fell silent. As of 2018, Nakane has been back at it, consistently playing a variety of instruments in Little Tokyo and elsewhere. Arthur Nakane returns to Little Tokyo, Los Angeles.

It explores problems in the United States public education system and reviews successful education reform solutions in both charter and public schools, letting leading educators tell their stories. Plot Flunked studies the relatively poor position of the United States public education system; in the 2015 Programme for International Student Assessment, the country's mean performance was merely average among the OECD member states tested, and according to a 2015 survey of members of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, just 16% of them called American K-12 STEM education above average or best. The film also, though, explores some of the system's successes. The first 20 minutes review many of the system's problems, as well as schools nationwide that prepared students well for college in the 2000s. Based on their high test scores, their graduates seemed capable of working and competing in tomorrow's economy. The documentary shows ways to reform troubled public schools, as well as alternatives to them, including charter schools.

Its hairy stems bear blue-green pine-like acute leaves 0.5-1.2 cm (0.2-0.5 in) long. The tubular flowers are up to 2 cm (0.8 in) long and appear from February to June, and are all red, unlike the red and green flowers of A. pinifolium. Flowers are followed by green globular berries around 0.4-0.6 cm (0.2 in) in diameter, which become reddish as they ripen. Taxonomy Astroloma humifusum was initially described as Ventenatia humifusa by Spanish botanist Antonio Jos√© Cavanilles in 1797, before being given its current binomial name by prolific Scottish botanist Robert Brown in his 1810 work Prodromus Florae Novae Hollandiae. Brown also described a second species, Astroloma denticulatum, based on plant material that he had collected at Memory Cove in South Australia. It was later treated as a subspecies of A. humifusum (A. humifusum var. denticulatum), but is currently treated as a synonym of A. humifusum. In Western Australia, the name Astroloma humifusum has been misapplied to Astroloma prostratum. =Common names= Common names include cranberry heath and native cranberry, as the fruit were eaten by early settlers. An old name is juniper-leaved astroloma. Common nineteenth century names were \\"Native Cranberries\\" and \\"Ground Berry\\". p. 8 Distribution and habitat The range is in southeastern Australia, from Newcastle in the north in eastern and central New South Wales, into Victoria, south-eastern South Australia and Tasmania. It is generally found in open woodland, both on sandstone and clay soils, as well as upland bogs. Associated plant species include Eucalyptus fibrosa, Eucalyptus sideroxylon, and Kunzea ambigua. Ecology The eastern bettong (Bettongia gaimardi) eats the fruit. Uses Requiring good drainage in the garden, Astroloma humifusum can be grown in rockeries. The juicy berries are edible, although they are mostly made up of a large seed. They can be used to make jams or preserves. The flavour of the berries has been described as \\"sickly sweet\\".

Taxonomy It was initially described by the botanist Robert Brown in his 1810 work Prodromus Florae Novae Hollandiae as Stenanthera pinifolia, before being assigned to the genus Astroloma by George Bentham in his work Flora Australiensis in 1868. The specific name is derived from the Latin words pinus \\"pine\\" and folium \\"leaf\\". Description Astroloma pinifolium grows as a spreading shrub 30 cm to 1 m (12‚Äì40 in) high and 0.5 to 1.5 m (20 in to 5 ft) across. Its hairy stems are densely packed with pine-like leaves 1‚Äì3 cm (0.4-1.2 in) long. The tubular flowers are up to 2 cm (0.8 in) long and appear from August to April, and are found singly along the stems, either yellow or pink with a band of yellow, green at the tip, and tapered at both ends. Flowers are followed by pale green globular berries around 0.5 cm (0.2 in) in diameter. Distribution and habitat Pine heath is found from the north coast of New South Wales, from Evans Head south along the coast, Southern Tablelands and great divide into Victoria and Tasmania. It grows in open forest and heathland on well-drained sandy soils, where it co-occurs with such species as Eucalyptus sieberi, E. globoidea, and Angophora costata in the former habitat, and Allocasuarina distyla and Banksia ericifolia in the latter. Ecology The Tasmanian subspecies of the grey currawong (known locally as clinking currawong or black jay) appears especially fond of the berries. One observer noting how sluggish and quiet the normally noisy birds were, wondered whether there was some narcotic effect the plant imparted on the birds.

They are able to withstand frost and are salt tolerant. The species is also known as the Prickly Currant Bush., PlantNet: New South Wales Flora Online, Coprosma quadrifida. Description These plants are an erect open to dense shrub that can grow to between 2-5m tall. Seed germination can take over six months, with domestically used seed undergoing stratification to reduce germination to 2-4 weeks. Branches remain slender, often tapering to a spine at the point. Like other related species, such as Coprosma nitida, C. quadrifida also displays pubescent branchlets that are spine shaped.[Thompson, R.I. 2010: A new species of Leptostigma (Rubiaceae: Coprosminae) and notes on the Coprosminae in Australia.

The Antidosis can be viewed as a defense, an autobiography, or rhetorical treatise. However, since Isocrates wrote it when he was 82 years old, it is generally seen by some people as an autobiography. The title term, \\"antidosis\\" literally translates as ‚Äúan exchange,‚Äù and was applied in ancient Greek courts as a peculiar law pertaining to an exchange of estates between two parties. Antidosis as an Ancient Athenian legal term If one of the 1200 wealthiest Athenians eligible was tasked with the performance of a public liturgy and financing one of the many public concerns of Athens, then he could avoid the duty by nominating a richer man who was more qualified than himself to perform it. If the supposedly richer man disagreed with the terms, then the entirety of their estates would be exchanged and the now more wealthy man would have to perform the liturgy, as originally planned. The law inspired Isocrates' Antidosis, which was written in the form of a court case where Isocrates had to defend himself from a charge of corrupting the youth by teaching them how to speak well in order for them to gain an unfair advantage over their peers. Although this work is put forward by Isocrates as his imagined defense in a legal case, it is more a treatise on morality and teaching.  As a Court Case  Although it is assumed that he is defending himself from a charge of corrupting the youth, nowhere in his Antidosis does Isocrates mention what crime he is charged with and from which he must defend, nor does it say what the penalty would be for being found guilty. Isocrates also does not make any attempt to offer evidence in his favor, yet presents the defense that he is a good teacher to his students as the full defense for the crime that he has committed. There is no specific mention of anything that would prove him innocent in this particular case. Another idea by scholars is that early on in the Antidosis, Isocrates reads aloud that he is being indicted for corrupting his students. He is accused of educating his students to speak against the courts, question the laws, and think for themselves. Isocrates says, ‚ÄúHere is the indictment my accuser endeavors to vilify me, charging that I corrupt young men by teaching them to speak and gain their won advantage in the courts contrary to justice‚Ä¶‚ÄùIsocrates. The Antidosis. Harvard: Harvard UP, 1929. Print. Isocrates is being charged by Lysimachus who has accused Isocrates of receiving money from his students. In return, Isocrates has been teaching them how to become better public speakers and leaders. Isocrates proves his innocence by showing, that through teaching his students rhetoric, he is teaching them how to become better citizens and leaders of Athens. Isocrates proved his rationale by citing the accomplishments and devotion to the state his students displayed after being educated by him. Isocrates says in his defense, ‚ÄúBut, I beg of you, consider well whether I appear to you to corrupt the young by my words, or, on the contrary, to inspire them to a life of valor and of dangers endured for their country‚Ä¶‚ÄùIsocrates. The Antidosis. Harvard: Harvard UP, 1929. Print. B. Keith Murphy says of Isocrates‚Äôs defense, ‚ÄúFor Isocrates, it is through rhetoric that we can approximate truth, or at least a consensual truth. A man who is trained in rhetoric is trained in truth, and the creation of that truth through oratory.‚ÄùMurphy, B. Keith. \\"Isocrates.\\" Salem Press, 1998. Web. 29 Apr 2011. . In the sense that he is defending himself from an onerous charge to perform a liturgy, Isocrates makes a claim that his value to the city was provided through his teaching. He states that as a lifelong teacher, the value of the education that he has provided for students is worth far more than any monetary donation he can give to Athens. His teaching has provided for civic- minded and properly educated citizens that contribute to the orderly running of the city-state. For Isocrates to be sentenced to death would be to ignore the public service that he has performed for the city, by which he has devoted his life to giving its citizens a proper rhetorical education.  As an Autobiography  Isocrates was 82 years old at the time he wrote Antidosis, the longest work of his life. Antidosis is used by the author to depict himself as a model citizen and a contributor to the city-state of Athens. Since he was nearing the end of his life, he presumably would have wanted to leave behind a legacy of a devoted and moderate citizen to his home town and to justify his life as a service to Athens and the citizens to whom he taught rhetoric. Isocrates presents himself as a quiet citizen who avoids the public light, where oratory is used in a way to bring many different cases of litigation against each other - which the elite believed to negatively affect the way in which the republic was run. He tries to withdraw himself from the public interfering and intrusive efforts made into democratic politics. The Antidosis is not seen by some as an autobiography of Isocrates; it was written later in his life as a fictionalized story similar to his own court trial. While there are similarities between Isocrates‚Äôs real court case and the one in the Antidosis, many aspects of the case were fictionalized. Examples are Lysimachus being the person who has brought Isocrates to trial for this crime, and the crime being different from the one with which he was actually accused. According to George Norlin, ‚ÄúAt any rate, in the Antidosis-a title which he borrows from the actual suit to which he had just been subjected-he adopts the fiction of a capital charge brought against him by an informer named Lysimachus, and of a trial before a court with its accessories.‚ÄùNorlin, George. The Antidosis. Harvard: Harvard UP, 1929. Print. It is known that in his own life Isocrates did in fact go to court in his own defense over an amount of money he was made to pay. Isocrates argued this fine was based on the fact people thought he was wealthier than he actually was. He claimed this distorted perception of his wealth was due to his popularity as a public figure. This is similar to Isocrates‚Äôs defense in the Antidosis in which he claims he has been indicted due to the fact he is a very successful person, people are jealous of him, and people want to publicly embarrass him. In the Antidosis, Isocrates is charged with corrupting the youth by teaching them to become good public speakers. With this ability, the students may trick people by convincing them of false truths which could ultimately allow the students to corrupt the government. This is an obvious defense of his life‚Äôs work of teaching. As a Rhetorical Treatise Isocrates states that the teacher should be judged by his students, in that if they do good and moral works then the teacher has done a good job and should be praised. This directly opposes Gorgias‚Äô view that it is not up to him how his students use what he teaches them. At the end of his Antidosis, Isocrates explains how he attempts to keep his students in high moral standing by discouraging some of the more debaucherous behaviors available in the city, such as ‚Äúparticipating in drinking-bouts and tossing dice in gambling dens.‚Äù He posits the idea that as a teacher, he can be judged as successful by the moral ways in which his students live their lives when compared to other young men who are wasting their youth in revelry. Hence he agrees to submit to the punishment if any of his students can be shown to be bad influences on society and challenges his accuser to present even one student who could be said to belong to the group of degenerate youth. Another important topic is natural talent. Isocrates argues that native ability is necessary for becoming a good orator, along with a proper education on the subject and practical experience. Commentary D. S. Hutchinson and Monte Johnson (2010) pointed out :Aristotle‚Äôs Protrepticus was written in the late 350s in polemical response to a work by the Athenian philosopher and teacher Isocrates called the Antidosis. In this work, Isocrates contested the application of the word philosophy to the kind of abstract and speculative mathematical preoccupations current in Plato‚Äôs Academy. For him, education and philosophy meant training men to become effective political leaders, and the means to this was training in rhetoric. Speculation about advanced mathematics, astronomy, and the ‚Äúelements‚Äù or ‚Äúprinciples‚Äù of nature were useful as ‚Äúmental gymnastic‚Äù for the young but, according to the argument, in adulthood become distractions from the important business of military, political, and legal action. In the Protrepticus, Aristotle responded to Isocrates‚Äô attack on Academic philosophy by defending the search for the elements and principles of nature as the best means not only for political science, but for every other goal in life as well.

Description This genus was proposed for a group of deepwater species which had been erroneously referred to Cyclostrema. They are small, thin, of rather delicate texture (with the exception of Lissospira rarinota), opaque white, and slightly lustrous. Their shell consists of few convex whorls forming an elevated spire, with a relatively large, prominent nuclear whorl and a large body whorl. The suture is deep. The umbilicus is small, deep, and does not show any whorls. The aperture is somewhat oblique, circular with a slight sutural angle, and not modified by the body whorl to which the simple, continuous peritreme is but slightly attached. The aperture often has an indistinct thread just within the inner lip, fading out above and below, so that it extends but about halfway round the aperture. It is much nearer the edge along the columellar margin than at the ends and is evidently to prevent the thin operculum being drawn in too far. The operculum is circular, thin, of a delicate horn color, with a central nucleus. It has about seven whorls, defined by a distinct spiral thread, often showing delicate, microscopic transverse growth lines. The radula consists of numerous rows of delicate teeth. Each row hasone broad central, or median tooth, with a broad, blunt, delicately serrate, curved tip and on either side four more slender lateral teeth also with blunt, curved, delicately serrate tips, beyond which is a series of numerous, between 30 and 50, long, very slender, somewhat sickle- shaped hooks sometimes with delicately serrate tips.Bush, K.

Part of the larger Qinling mountain range, it cuts through four provinces: Sichuan, Chongqing, Shaanxi, and Hubei. It is about long. Geography The Daba Mountains run in the general west-northwest to east- southeast direction, along the border between, on the one side (southwest and south) Sichuan and Chongqing, and on the other side (northeast and north) Shaanxi and Hubei. The mountains of Shennongjia are often considered the easternmost section of the Daba Range. The southern slope of the Daba Mountains drains into the Sichuan Basin or directly into the Yangtze via short streams that flow into the river in the Three Gorges area, such as the Shen Nong Stream. The northern side drains into the Han River, a major tributary of the Yangtze, which, however, does not join the Yangtze until some hundreds kilometers to the east (in Wuhan). The Daba Mountains' highest points are in the Shennongjia massif in Shennongjia Forest District. The three tallest peaks, located west of Muyu town, are Shennong Deng (\\"Shennong Peak\\", elevation), Da Shennongjia (\\"Great Shennongjia\\", ), and Xiao Shennongjia (\\"Lesser Shennongjia\\", , on the district's border with Badong County). Laojun Shan, tall, is located northeast of Muyu. In the southeast, the Daba Mountains are joined to the Wu Mountains, which block the Yangtze's flow out of the Sichuan Basin. In the east, the small Jingshan Range (in the southern part of the Xiangyang Prefecture) can be viewed as the extreme extension of the Daba Mountains. In the northeast, the Wudang Mountains are nearby; some authors even consider them a \\"branch\\" of the Daba Mountains. In the rural counties of southern Hanzhong, in Shaanxi Province, there is a large area of karst with some of the largest sinkholes in the world, known as the Shaanxi tiankeng cluster or \\"Hanzhong tiankeng group\\". It covers nearly 5019 square kilometers and is located in four counties, Ningqiang County, Nanzheng County, Xixiang County, and Zhenba County, with the largest sinkhole (520 meters in diameter and 320 meters deep), near Sanyuanzhen () in Zhenba County. Natural environment The natural landscape of the region, the Daba Mountains evergreen forests, is listed by the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) as one of the world's 200 ecoregions that should be a priority for conservation. Dabashan National Nature Reserve is located in the Chongqing part of the Daba Mountains (Chengkou County); Shennongjia Mountain Nature Reserve (), in Hubei (Shennongjia Forestry District). The Dawn Redwood (Metasequoia glyptostroboides) is a deciduous conifer endemic to the Daba Shan, whose nearest living relatives are the Coast Redwood and Giant Sequoia of California. Redwoods formerly ranged across the northern hemisphere, but were thought to be extinct outside California until stands of Dawn Redwood were discovered in the Daba Shan in the 1940s.

Construction on the $111 million building started on 19 August 2009.Mike McPhee, History Colorado Center breaks ground, The Denver Post, 08/19/2009. The museum opened on 28 April 2012 at 1200 Broadway,A State Looks at Itself in a New Mirror New York Times, 2012-04-27. one block south of the site of its predecessor, the Colorado History Museum, which closed in 2010. The center is administered by History Colorado, formerly the Colorado Historical Society.  Research  The Stephen H. Hart Library & Research Center provides a collection of artifacts, archives and photography to History of Colorado's Collection. Collections consists of maps, clothing, teapots, photography dating from the 1850s, and news paper collections containing marriage, birth, and death records.http://www.historycolorado.org/researchers/stephen-h-hart- library-and-research-center Permanent Exhibits The History Colorado Center features six permanent exhibits: Living West, Colorado Stories, Denver A-Z, Destination Colorado, Time Machine, and Denver Diorama. All exhibits feature hands-on opportunities for childhood learning and interesting displays for adults.http://historycoloradocenter.org/exhibits/living-west =Living West= The Living West exhibit is a 7,000 square foot exhibit that explores the living dynamics between the people of Colorado and their state's environment. The exhibit is divided into three areas which focus on different environmental regions at different times in Colorado's history. The importance of water is a theme that runs throughout each area of the exhibit. The three exhibit areas of Living West include Mesa Verde (western Colorado), the Dust Bowl (the plains), and the Mountains. =Mesa Verde= Mesa Verde focuses on the daily lives of the Ancestral Puebloans. The exhibit features dioramas and artifacts including pottery and tools. =Dust Bowl= In this section, museum visitors can experience the Black Sunday storm of the 1930s and see what hardships the Dust Bowl offered homesteading Coloradans. =Mountains= In this exhibit area, visitors can marvel at some of the wildlife Colorado's mountains have to offer as well as see how roads and rivers through the mountains have shaped life everywhere in the state. Using a hands-on water diorama and trees affected by the Mountain pine beetle as examples, the museum illustrates just how important preserving Colorado's resources is. =Destination Colorado= Destination Colorado focuses on the former town of Keota, Colorado which has since become unincorporated. The town, established in 1880, is described as the iconic homesteading mecca that faced drought and famine but was also filled with kindness and community. The trip through the exhibit is narrated by several actors portraying real residents of Keota as it winds through the general store and school, among other places. Some of Keota's residences and many of their relatives are still alive today. =Colorado Stories= Colorado Stories takes an in-depth look at some of the people that have shaped Colorado's history and made it the state it is today. Highlights include a ski jump simulator and a short video on loop depicting the struggles faced by internees at the Granada War Relocation Center, an internment camp in Southeastern Colorado used to house Japanese-Americans after the attack on Pearl Harbor. A walk-through exhibit area shows the cramped conditions in the internees' quarters. Other exhibits include a Silverton, CO silver mine, a look at rangers working in Rocky Mountain National Park and a section that explores the various triumphs and hardships experienced by Colorado's African- Americans. = Time Machine= Upon entering the museum, guests are greeted by a 40 by 60-foot map of the state of Colorado. The map was designed by renowned artist Steven Weitzman using a revolutionary type of concrete tiles he designed himself. When visitors move a large \\"steam punk\\" style time machine over certain areas on the map, screens on the machine come to life and go back in time to relay fascinating stories from different periods in that area's history. =Denver A-Z= This quirky exhibit focuses on the capital of Denver. A journey through the alphabet reveals interesting tidbits about Colorado's most populous city from big blue bears to the city's fascination with zombies. =The Denver Diorama= A local favorite, the Denver Diorama shows what this major city looked like when it was a small town on the 1800s Colorado plains.

Even with an artistic career as brief as hers, Sobel is the first artist to use the drip painting technique which directly influenced Jackson Pollock.https://monoskop.org/images/c/ce/Greenberg_Clement_1955_1961_American- Type_Painting.pdf p. 218} Early life Janet Sobel was born as Jennie Olechovsky in 1893 in Ukraine. Her father, Baruch Olechovsky, was killed in a Russian pogrom. Sobel along with her mother, Fannie Kinchuk, and siblings moved to Ellis Island in New York City in 1908.[2] At 17, she married Max Sobel and was a mother of five when she began painting in 1937. Sobel became a known suburban artist housewife that inspired the feminist conversation around domestic roles of women. She produced both non-objective abstractions and figurative artwork.[3] Upon recognizing Sobel's talent, her son helped her artistic development and shared her work with √©migr√© surrealists, Max Ernst, Andr√© Breton, as well as John Dewey and Sidney Janis.[4] Career Understanding Sobel's Career: Professionally, Sobel was, primarily, a housewife. Clement Greenberg, an art authority in Sobel's time, wrote on avant-garde painting and positioned \\"Sobel as a forerunner of Abstract Impressionism\\", but he made sure to emphasize Sobel's work as inferior to Pollocks by reducing it as \\"'primitive'\\" and that of a \\"'housewife'\\". Generally, Sobel's work was framed by Greenberg only relative to Abstract Expressionism or to Pollock, and he did not address her during the three years her works circulated in New York galleries until framing Pollock's career. The result is a failure of recognition during her career. But, Peggy Guggenheim did include Sobel's work in her The Art of This Century Gallery in 1945. As described, some of her work is related to the so-called \\"drip paintings\\" of Jackson Pollock, who \\"'admitted that these pictures had made an impression on him'\\". The critic Clement Greenberg, with Jackson Pollock, saw Sobel's work there in 1946, and in his essay \\"'American-Type' Painting\\" cited those works as the first instance of all-over painting he had seen, but this style is attributed to appropriated female nature rather than to artistic creativity; her art evolved from recognizable figures to a more abstract style of paint dripping. \\"Sobel was part folk artist, Surrealist, and Abstract Expressionist, but critics found it easiest to call her a 'primitive.'\\" As Zalman summarizes, her title of \\"primitive\\" was \\"a category that enabled her acceptance by the art world but restricted her artistic development.\\" Part of her grouping as a 'primitive' painter was part of a greater movement to try to form a unique American form of art, distinct from European art, while still trying to maintain a hierarchy of 'us and them'. Sobel was grouped as inferior due to her status as a housewife, while other painters could've been dismissed as being mentally inferior in some way. In a way, Sobel also serves as a representative of this conflict. Inspirations and Influences in her Work: Her belief in the ethics of self-realization in a democracy led to her encounter with philosopher John Dewey. Dewey championed Sobel by writing about her in a catalogue statement at the Puma Gallery in New York in 1944. In this catalogue he states: > Her work is extraordinarily free from inventiveness and from self- > consciousness and pretense. One can believe that to an unusual degree her > forms and colors well up from a subconsciousness that is richly stored with > sensitive impressions received directly from contact with nature, > impressions which have been reorganized in figures in which color and form > are happily wedJohn Dewey, Janet Sobel, Puma gallery, leaflet catalogue, New > York, April 24 to May 14, 1944. Sobel used music for inspiration and stimulation of her feelings into her canvas. Sobel's works exemplify the tendency to fill up every empty space, often known as horror vacui. She often depicted her feelings through past experiences. Her depiction of soldiers with cannons and imperial armies, as well as traditional jewish families, reflected the experiences of her childhood. Her figures often demonstrated the time of the Holocaust, where she relived the trauma of her youth. Through her traumas and troubling youth, Sobel found a safe realm for her imagination and anguish through art. Notable Works Sobel's initial works show a flair for a primitivist figuration reminiscent of early Chagall and serves to herald early Dubuffet. The abundant floral motifs recall Ukrainian peasant art. In addition, the need to exploit media of all sorts is very evident (including sand). If her drips paintings weren't vivid enough, she would opt to outline them in ink in order to compensate. Aiding in inventing Abstract Expressionism did not conclude her imagistic work. Her main goal was visual intensity, which she attained with impressive regularity. Milky Way, created in 1945, is currently displayed in the Museum of Modern Art.

It was commissioned by one of Murad III's grand viziers, Mesih Mehmed Pasha, and designed by the imperial architect Mimar Sinan. The mosque was completed in 1585‚Äì86. History The mosque was commissioned in 1584 by the eunuch Mesih Mehmed Pasha while he held the post of third vizier. Mesih Pasha had worked for nearly six years in Cairo as the governor-general of Egypt before returning to Istanbul in 1581. He became second vizier in July 1584 and then grand vizier for the four-month period from 1 December 1585 until 15 April 1586. He died in 1589 and was buried by his mosque. It is unclear to what extent the imperial architect Mimar Sinan was involved in the design of the mosque. Sinan went on a hajj to Mecca in 1584 and during his absence his place was taken by the royal architect Mehmed Suba≈üƒ±. Sinan included the mosque in the list of his works in a draft of his autobiography (Tu·∏•fet√º‚Äôl-mi ømƒÅrƒ´n) but omitted it from a later version (Te·∫ïkiret√º‚Äôl-ebniye). The foundation inscription on the mosque gives the completion date as AH 994 (1585-86). The triple water fountain on the southwest corner of the perimeter wall has an inscription with the same date. The fountain was refurbished in 1817‚Äì18. In 1587 Mesih Pasha obtained permission to be buried next to his mosque. He died in 1589. Architecture =Exterior= The mosque is built on a sloping site that is higher on the eastern side. To create a level surface the western side of the building rests on a vaulted substructure that accommodates a series of shops. To the north of the mosque is a rectangular forecourt surrounded on three sides by an arcade with pillars that support small domes. The entrance from the street below is through a domed gatehouse at the side. Beneath the northern section of the arcade are a series of taps for the ritual ablutions. Instead of the usual fountain, at the centre of the forecourt is the grave of Mesih Pasha. The north fa√ßade of the mosque has a double portico with five arches. The columns of the inner portico support five small domes. The lead covered main dome has a diameter of . It rests on a drum with 24 windows that is encircled by eight stabilizing turrets that sit on the internal piers. There are also five half-domes that form the exedra of the mihrab and the exedras at the four corners. The aisles at each side of the mosque are covered by three small domes. The windows on the lower levels are grouped by large framing arches.

As a poet, he has published works using the pseudonym A.C. Darke. Life and career Born in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Belyea earned a Bachelor of Arts from St. John's College, University of Manitoba in 1948, a Bachelor of Education from the University of Manitoba (UM) in 1953, and a Master of Education from the UM in 1961. He studied singing and conducting privately with W.H. Anderson. He began his career serving overseas in the Canadian Army before serving as choirmaster at St Jude's Anglican Church in Winnipeg from 1952-66. He later served in that same capacity at St Andrew's United Church during the 1970s. He joined the Education faculty at the University of Manitoba in 1967 where he taught for many years. In 1969 Belyea became conductor of The Choristers after the death of conductor Filmer Hubble. He conducted the group until it disbanded in 1974, notably leading them in several performances broadcast nationally on CBC Radio. He also served as an adjudicator and clinician throughout Canada and in 1984 he was named a life member of the Manitoba Music Educators Association.

Goudy was one of America's most prolific designers of metal type. He worked under the influence of the Arts and Crafts movement, and many of his designs are old-style serif designs inspired by the relatively organic structure of typefaces created between the fifteenth and eighteenth centuries, following the lead of earlier revivalist printers such as William Morris. Eric Sloane, who was his neighbour as a boy, recalled that he also took inspiration from hand-painted signs. He also developed a number of typefaces influenced by blackletter medieval manuscripts, illuminated manuscript capitals and Roman square capitals carved into stone. This means that several of his most famous designs such as Copperplate Gothic and Goudy Stout are unusual deviations from his normal style. Goudy's taste matched a trend of the period, in which a preference for using mechanical, geometric Didone fonts introduced in the eighteenth and nineteenth century was being displaced by a revival of interest in the 'old-style' serif fonts (preferred by Goudy) developed before this, a change that has proved to be lasting, especially in book body text.Lawson, A. (1990). Anatomy of a typeface. Boston: Godine, p.200. Goudy in 1924 Again unusually for type designers of the period, Goudy wrote extensively on his work and ambitions, partly in order to publicise his work as an independent artisan. He completed A Half-Century of Type Design and Typography, a two- volume survey of all his designs, late in life, in which he discussed all of his work. Not all Goudy's designs survive or have been digitised: several, often designs never cut into metal, were lost in a fire which burned down his studio in 1938. Indeed, in his autobiography Goudy sometimes said he had little memory of some of his earlier designs. He worked extensively with his wife Bertha, who particularly collaborated with him on printing projects. He listed his typefaces with numbers in a similar way to the opus numbers used by composers. Career Bertha Goudy in his font Kennerley Old Style and printed by his friend Mitchell Kennerley. Unlike most type designers of the metal type era, Goudy worked as an independent designer not permanently employed by any one company, giving him particular latitude to work on his own projects. He generally avoided sans-serif designs, though he did create the nearly sans- serif Copperplate Gothic, inspired by engraved letters, early in his career and a few others later. As an independent artist and consultant, Goudy needed to undertake a large range of commissions to survive, and sought patronage from companies (and, especially later in life, universities) who would commission a typeface for their own printing and advertising. This led to him producing a large range of designs on commission, and promoting his career through talks and teaching. As a result, many of his designs may look somewhat similar to modern readers. Goudy's career took place at a time of progress in printing technology. New pantograph engraving technology made it easier to rapidly engrave matrices), the moulds in which metal type would be cast or the punches used to stamp them in copper. This gave much cleaner results than pre- pantograph punches, which had to be carefully hand-carved at the size of the desired letter, with less difficulty and the ability to prepare designs more easily from large plan drawings. During the early years of Goudy's career, hand typesetting was being superseded, especially for body text composition, by hot metal typesetting, and his client Monotype was one of the most popular manufacturers of these systems, in competition with that of Linotype. Both allowed metal type to be quickly cast under the control of a keyboard, eliminating the need to manually cast metal type and slot it into place into a printing press. With no need to keep type in stock, just the matrices used as moulds to cast the type, printers could use a wider range of fonts and there was increasing demand for varied typefaces. However, many of Goudy‚Äôs designs were used in hand-setting also. While most of Goudy's designs are 'old-style' serif faces, they do still explore a wide range of aspects of the genre, with Deepdene offering a strikingly upright italic, Goudy Modern merging traditional old-style letters with the insistent, horizontal serifs of Didone faces of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries and several such as Goudy Old Style being sold with a swash italic for display use. His sans-serif series, Goudy Sans, adopts an eccentric humanist style with a calligraphic italic. Quite unlike most sans-serif types of the period, it was unpopular in his lifetime but has been revived several times since by both LTC and ITC. A brochure cover hand-lettered by Goudy in the early 1900s Goudy started his career as a full-time type designer later in life, creating his first font in his early thirties. In his earlier career he had worked first as a bookkeeper, and then as a printer and lettering artist. Critical assessment The printer Daniel Berkeley Updike, while respecting some of his work, echoed Goudy's student Dwiggins' comment that his work lacked 'a certain snap and acidity'. He also wrote that Goudy had \\"never gotten over\\" a desire to imitate medieval books. The essay Printing by William Morris, reprinted by Goudy's Village Press in 1903 The British printer Stanley Morison, also a veteran of fine book printing whose career at Monotype had moved in the direction of blending tradition with practicality, admired much of Goudy's work and ethos but wrote that Goudy had \\"designed a whole century of very peculiar looking types\\", and that he was glad that his company's Times New Roman did not look \\"as if it has been designed by somebody in particular -- Mr. Goudy for instance.\\" Goudy felt in his later life that his career had been overshadowed by new trends, with modernism and a trend towards sans-serifs and sharp geometric type leaving his work out of favor. Walter Tracy, a leading historian of type design, devoted a section of his book Letters of Credit to a critical assessment of Goudy's work. He was impressed by Goudy Old Style, the blackletter Goudy Text, Goudy Heavy and to a certain extent Deepdene, but felt that Goudy was over-fond of eccentric detailing, such as a \\"restless\\" tilted 'e' common in early printing, and felt that Goudy's prolific work had prevented him from critically assessing his work. He noted as an example how his \\"Bertham\\" type, named in memory of his late wife (\\"Bertha M.\\"), was drawn and engraved in sixteen working days: \\"there cannot have been much time for the objective scrutiny which every design should undergo before it is allowed to emerge from the workshop.\\" Goudy gave his blackletter designs the adjective text, short for 'textura'. This designation was common in Goudy's time; it is now avoided due to confusion with fonts intended for body text. Typefaces designed by Goudy 1896 to 1904 * Camelot (1896, Dickinson Type Foundry), Goudy designed only the capitals, lower-case letters were later added, presumably by Dickinson's type designer Joseph W. Phinney or his team. A delicate Art Nouveau-inspired display face with small wedge serifs. * Unnamed (1896) this was a second set of drawings sent to Dickinson Type Foundry that he sent them after they had accepted Camelot. It was neither accepted nor cast, but Goudy numbered it among his faces. * Display Roman (1897, nc), based on some lettering in an issue of the British magazine The Studio. Goudy numbered it among his designs, though even he was unsure of what exactly it was beyond being \\"a display letter leaning to the bold side\\" or if it had ever been manufactured. * DeVinne Roman (1898, Central Type Foundry, ATF), a book face based on a display type that had been earlier commissioned by Theodore Low De Vinne. A sample advertisement set in Pabst Old Style from the American Type Founders specimen book of 1923 * Pabst Old Style or Pabst Roman (1902, ATF), based on hand lettering done by Goudy for advertisements for the Pabst Brewing Company, though commissioned by Schlesinger & Mayer, a Chicago department store. Cast by ATF with the proviso that the department store would have the exclusive use of the font for a time before it would be offered to the public. The design had a strikingly low x-height. ** Pabst Roman Italic (1903, ATF), a companion to the above. Cut by Robert Wiebking, who would work extensively with Goudy in the following years. Goudy's hand-lettering for the children's book Mother Goose. Several of his early typefaces were inspired by or similar to his work in this volume. Image is Goudy's own copy. * Powell (1903, Keystone Foundry), commissioned by one Mr. Powell, then advertising manager for Mandel Brothers department store (earlier he had commissioned Pabst Old Style for another store), and named after him. Another display type, partially inspired by lettering Goudy had done for the children's book Mother Goose, a design which Goudy felt had been pirated by the Inland Type Foundry as their font 'Hearst'. To give the font a different colour to Pabst or the 'Hearst' font, Goudy attempted to balance the x-height and height of the ascenders and descenders differently. ** Goudy reported in his autobiography that Keystone later created a matching italic. * The Village series was a family named after Goudy's own Village Press, which came to use it. ** Village (1903, Wiebking, Harding & Co.Lawson, Alexander, Anatomy of a Typeface. Boston: David R. Godine, Publisher, 1990. . p. 112.), cut by Wiebking. It was originally designed for Kuppenheimer & Company for advertising use, who later decided it would be too expensive to cast, and later bought by Frederick Sherman. The design was very much under the influence of William Morris's 'Golden' type, itself influenced by the 1470s printing of Nicolas Jenson, as well as other (mostly British) fine printers such as the Doves, Montaigne and Merrymount presses. The matrices are still extant and cast by Dale Guild Foundry. ** Village No. 2 (1932, Continental, later Lanston Monotype), cut by Goudy for an edition of Theodore Low De Vinne's The Old and the New, later marketed by Monotype. ** Village Italic (1934, Continental + Lanston Monotype), cut by Goudy. A companion to the No. 2 face. * Cushing Italic Goudy thought that Clarence C. Marder asked him to draw an italic to complement ATF's existing Cushing Roman sometime after 1904. However, Goudy was unsure whether they ultimately used his design, and ATF catalogs show it as existing as early as 1898. * Barron's Boston News Letter (1904, ATF), a private face cut for Clarence W. Barron's financial newsletter, matrices cut by Wiebking. Goudy wrote in 1946 that he had no knowledge of what became of the design and little memory of what it was. * Engravers' Roman (1904, nc), inspired by copperplate engraving. Goudy was uncertain if this type had ever been cast. Copperplate Gothic from a 1912 ATF brochure * Copperplate Gothic (1905, ATF), originally designed for Marder, Luse, & Co., ATF immediately adopted it and made it the first in a hugely successful series: Clarence C. Marder and Morris Fuller Benton later cut dozens of variations for ATF. 'Gothic' was a contemporary term for sans-serif typefaces; it has nothing to do with 'gothic' or blackletter writing. Master printer J.L. Frazier, no great fan of sans-serif types, wrote of it in 1925 that it was a popular choice for the stationery of professionals such as lawyers and doctors: \\"a certain dignity of effect accompanies...due to the absence of anything in the way of frills.\\" Caxton initials in an American Type Founders specimen * Caxton Initials (1905, ATF), a font included twenty-six 'Lombard capitals' and one leaf ornament only. Globe Gothic Bold * Globe Gothic Bold (1905, ATF), a companion to Morris Fuller Benton's 'Globe Gothic'. Sans-serif design with variable stroke width. Utterly unlike Goudy's normal work, and created on commission. Goudy wrote that it \\"is the least satisfactory (to me) of all my types. Phinney paid me a sum that at that time I considered liberal, and I have never been able to free my mind from the suspicion that he wished to help me financially more than he required such a type for his foundry‚Ä¶Gerry Powell of A.T.F. insists that it sold in considerable quantities, but I have never come across many pieces of printing showing it.\\" * Caslon Revised (1905, never cast), for A.T.F. Caslon was a very popular typeface in the American printing of the period, becoming almost a genre with many derivatives and expansions. Clarence Marder of A.T.F. asked Goudy to draw a more regular version of the design, intended to have a more even colour on the page than the original design. Ultimately never cast. Sample image of Goudy Light * Goudy Light Roman + Italic (1908, Lanston Monotype), originally made for use in Life magazine (who, Goudy reported, ultimately never used it) and initially called \\"Monotype 38E\\" after its order number. Sometimes known as Gimbel because of its use in ads for Gimbel's Department Store. An elegant design, which Goudy described as better-adapted for advertising and display use than for body text. * Norman Capitals (1910, privately cast by ATF), cut for Munder-Thompson Company, a Baltimore printing firm, and named for Norman Munder. Goudy was unsure what became of the font, although he held a specimen of it and reproduced it in his memoir. 1911 to 1926 A sample advertisement made with Kennerley Old Style, from a 1915 typeface catalogue From 1911 to 1926 (with a few exceptions) Goudy's designs were cut by Robert Wiebking. Some were private commissions, others were cut first and then offered for sale. =Kennerley series= The Kennerley Series, named for New York publisher Mitchell Kennerley, was Goudy's first major success in his own style. Goudy described the design as extremely loosely suggested by the 'Fell Types', a set of type in the Dutch style collected by Bishop John Fell of Oxford for the Oxford University Press: \\"comparison of my type with the Fell letter will disclose little more than an identity of spirit.\\" Others have compared it in some details, notably the tilted understroke on the 'e' of which Goudy was fond, to the type of late 15th century Venetian printer Nicolas Jenson. Many revivals and digitisations have been released since. ** Kennerley Old Style (1911, Village Letter Foundry + 1920, Lanston Monotype + 1927 Continental) Kennerley Old Style's italic swash capitals ** Kennerley Italic (1918, Village Letter Foundry + 1920, Lanston Monotype + 1927 Continental) ** Kennerley Bold + Bold Italic (1924, Lanston Monotype + Continental) Goudy Forum on a metal type specimen sheet Goudy Forum on an advertisement * Forum Title (1911, Lanston Monotype), capitals only, based on the lettering on the Arch of Titus in the Roman Forum. Distinguishable from some of Goudy's other Roman-inspired fonts by the Greek-inspired curving capital 'Y' in the tradition of the Greek letter upsilon. Quite soft in appearance, which Tracy found \\"too much of a good thing\\". * Sherman (1910), privately cast for publisher Frederick Sherman who never used it. After the death of Sherman and new ownership by his niece, Elizabeth Sherman Engelhardt, original proofs and remaining metal type were donated to Syracuse University for use exclusively by its faculty and students. The Sherman typeface was brought back to life and digitally redrawn by Chester Jenkins in 2016. * Goudy Lanston (1912, Village Letter Foundry) Initially named 'Goudy Old Style', but in 1915, when ATF requested this name for his new face for them, Goudy agreed and renamed it. 26 Lead Soldiers noted that \\"Goudy's own Village Foundry was long the sole source of this face, 14-point roman only\\". When Lanston Monotype bought and issued the face, it was again renamed, in honour of Tolbert Lanston; it was originally called Goudy Antique. Issued in England, with some alterations, by Caslon under the name Ratdolt. Evidently, this altered English version, was issued under the names Foster and Moore by Barnhart Brothers & Spindler along with a \\"matching\\" italic (see below). * Goudy Roman (1914), originally designed for Louis Orr of the Bartlett Press who was supposed to have them cast by Caslon Foundry, but Caslon refused to take on new work due to a \\"war scare\\". Later, Barnhart Brothers & Spindler expressed interest in the project cut trial matrices, which Goudy did not like, so he eventually cut the matrices himself. It is unclear if the type was ever cast in quantity. * Klaxon (1914, cut for Klaxon Auto Warning Signal Company), the matrices, which were cut by Wiebking, were lost in Goudy's 1939 studio fire. * Goudy Italic, a companion to Goudy Roman which never progressed past initial drawings which were then destroyed in Goudy's 1939 studio fire. 1915 to 1926: Cut by ATF A sample of Goudy Old Style in metal type. Note the very tight descenders, clearest on the 'p' and 'q'. The set of fonts in the Goudy 'family' in ATF's 1923 specimen book: the Goudy Old Style, Goudy Catalogue and Goudy Handtooled subfamilies. Goudy Cursive is effectively Goudy Old Style with swash caps. The bold and tooled fonts were not drawn by Goudy (see below). In 1915 and 1916, Goudy was on retainer for American Type Founders and all of his matrices were cut in house by ATF. =Goudy Old Style= Described as 'an instant best- seller' by Lawson in Anatomy of a Typeface, Goudy Old Style (1915) has remained popular since its creation for ATF as a body text and display face. Goudy described the design as influenced by capitals on a painting, but later said he was unable to find which, although he thought it was by Hans Holbein (Goudy did not say which). The dots (tittles) on the 'i' and 'j' are diamond- pattern, and the descenders were kept short at ATF's insistence to allow tight line setting on their common line system. Many revivals have been released. Goudy later also designed an italic, and A.T.F. a bold weight and a medium, named 'Goudy Catalogue'. Goudy Old Style became particularly commonly used for display and advertising use. Indeed, in 1937, the printing textbook 26 Lead Soldiers described the bold as 'better known' than the regular. A sample of Goudy Cursive, showing alternate capitals, 'g' and 'x' * Goudy Cursive (1916, ATF): a set of swash capitals and other alternate characters for Goudy Old Style. * Booklet Old Style (1916, ATF), apparently never marketed. Proof shown in Goudy's memoir. A specimen of National Oldstyle in American Type Founders' 1923 specimen book * National Old Style (1916, ATF), quite similar to his Nabisco. * Unnamed (1917), Goudy had zinc etchings made of this face and pulled proofs, which dissatisfied him. He scrapped the face and the drawings are now in the Library of Congress. * Advertiser's Roman (1917, nc), patterns were cut but never cast, all traces lost in Goudy's 1939 studio fire. LTC Goudy Initials, a modern digitisation of Cloister Initials * Cloister Initials (1918, ATF), a set of floral initials designed to be used with Morris Fuller Benton's Cloister Old Style. * Hadriano Title (1918, Lanston Monotype + 1927, Continental), matrices cut by Wiebking. Based on the appearance of worn stone capitals. ** Hadriano Lower Case (1930, nc), designed by Goudy for Monotype but never cut. In 1932 Monotype released a full-font that consisted of Hadriano Title matched with Kennerley Bold lower case letters. Goudy Open in metal type at 60pt, showing a variant swashed 'Q' =Goudy Open and Goudy Modern= Goudy Open * Goudy Open (1918, Village Letter Foundry + 1924, Monotype Ltd. + 1927, Continental), matrices cut by Wiebking. An open face design (similar to Imprint Shadowed) but influenced by Didone or Modern serif fonts, such as Didot and Bodoni. The influence is visible in exactly horizontal serifs on letters with ascenders, very different to other Goudy 'open face' designs. Goudy's aim was to 'redeem' the Didone letterform by letting more white space into it, in order to preserve the outline area and bulk of the letterforms while reducing the area of ink on the page. Goudy Modern in metal type ** Goudy Modern (1918, Village Letter Foundry + 1924, Monotype Ltd. + 1927, Continental), basically just a \\"filled in\\" version of Goudy Open, matrices cut by Wiebking. Perhaps most famously used in the Arion Press's famous 1980 edition of Moby Dick, typeset by Andrew Hoyem, considered one of the most famous books in American fine printing.Grossman, C: \\"Andrew Hoyem of Arion Press: Champion of Literary Artistry\\", Biblio, September 1997.http://www.sfgate.com/cgi- bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2006/06/18/MNGAOJENV01.DTL&hw;=arion+press&sn;=003‚âª=660 ** Goudy Open Italic + Modern Italic (1919, Village Letter Foundry + 1924, Monotype Ltd.), matrices cut by Wiebking. The normal italic was this time made first, then the open design. * Collier Old Style (1919, ATF), a private type for Proctor & Collier, a Cincinnati advertising agency, matrices cut by Wiebking. Goudy's Lining Gothic design of 1921 * Lining Gothic (1921, nc), a caps-only, almost sans-serif design with small wedge serifs on the stroke ends. Drawings for this face were complete, but when Wiebking was late in cutting the matrices, the order was cancelled and Goudy lost interest in the design. Example prints are shown in Goudy's autobiography and Elements of Lettering. Writing in 1946, he noted that had he resumed work, he could have anticipated Kabel and Futura with the design. It is also strikingly similar to Albertus of over a decade later. * Nabisco (1921, privately cast), cut for the National Biscuit Company based on the hand-lettered logotype he had done for them twenty years ago, matrices cut by Wiebking. =Garamont= Monotype's first showing of Garamont One of Goudy's most popular typefaces in his lifetime, Garamont (1921, Lanston Monotype + 1927, Continental) was loosely based on metal types in the Imprimerie nationale, the French government printing-office, that were at the time thought to be the work of Claude Garamont. Research by Beatrice Warde, published in 1926, revealed that actually these designs were the work of Jean Jannon, working more than fifty years after Garamond's death. An elegant sample created by Bruce Rogers was shown in a spring 1923 issue of Monotype's magazine. Garamont features a large range of swash characters. Mosley has described it as \\"a lively type, underappreciated I think.\\" LTC's digitisation deliberately maintained its eccentricity and irregularity true to period printing, something Goudy had insisted on in his original design, avoiding perfect verticals. * Goudy Newstyle (1921, Village Letter Foundry + 1927, Continental + 1941 Lanston Monotype), re-cut in 1935 and sold to Monotype who then marketed it as Goudy Bible. It was also used by the Grabhorn Press, who used it in an edition of Leaves of Grass. This face was then adapted by Bruce Rogers and Sol Hess for the famous Oxford Lectern Bible of 1948. * Italian Old Style + Italic (1924, Lanston Monotype + 1927, Continental) Often confused with some other faces of the same name, it is notable for its 'A' with serifs on either side of the top. It was used to set Goudy's autobiography. Goudy Heavy in metal type * Goudy Heavy Face + Italic (1925, Lanston Monotype + 1927, Continental), intended to compete with Cooper Black. An ultra-bold typeface with minimal stress in the old-style pattern; Walter Tracy, not always a fan of Goudy's type designs, thought it \\"one of Goudy's best\\" and \\"superior\\" to its competitors. * Marlborough (1925, Village Letter Foundry + 1927, Continental), a private face designed for a printer who lost interest in the project before completion. The matrices were cut by Wiebking and a few fonts were cast by Goudy, and these were destroyed in Goudy's studio fire of 1939. A revised version of this design was sold to Lanston Monotype in 1942, but Monotype apparently did not release it. A picture is shown in Goudy's 1946 memoir. * Venezia Italic (1925, Monotype Ltd.), made at the request of type designer George W. Jones to accompany his Venezia Roman. =1926 to 1929= From 1926 until his death, Goudy cut all of his own faces (at least in the pilot sizes).Rollins, Carl Purlington American Type Designers and Their Work. in Print, V. 4, #1. From 1927-1929, Goudy cast type at his own Village Letter Foundry and marketed them through the Continental Type Founders Association. After 1929 he ceased casting his own fonts and they were cast for Continental by the New England Type Foundry.Specimen Book of Continental Types, Continental Type Founders Association, N.Y.C., 1929, p. 123. * Goudy Antique (1926, privately cast by Village Letter Foundry + 1927, Continental), the first type matrices actually cut by Goudy himself. * Aries (1926), privately cast for Spencer Kellogg's Aries Press. A medieval-inspired design with upper- and lower-case. * Goudy Uncials (1927, nc), drawings were completed, all traces lost in Goudy's 1939 studio fire. * Companion Old Style + Italic (1927, Lanston Monotype), a private face cut for the Woman's Home Companion magazine. Created with a very full character set, including italic swash caps and small capitals. A set of matrices survives in the collection of the Tampa Book Arts Studio. A favourite of Goudy's, who felt it showed more 'consistent original features than any other face I have ever made' (Tracy did not like it), but not digitised. (The Companion would later become one of the first magazines in the USA to switch to Times New Roman in 1943.) Deepdene in metal type =Deepdene series= A crisp design inspired by a typeface designed in the Netherlands, which Goudy's Paul Bennett wrote was Jan van Krimpen's Lutetia. One of Goudy's more popular designs, with several digital revivals, although as of 2016 only LTC's includes the swash capitals and small caps of Goudy's original design conception. Named after Goudy's home in Marlborough. ** Deepdene (1927, Continental, later Lanston Monotype) Changes were made to fit Monotype's machine composition system. ** Deepdene Italic (1928, Continental, later Lanston Monotype), matrices cut by Bertha M. Goudy. Notable for a nearly-upright italic. ** Deepdene Medium (1931, nc), designed for Lanston Monotype but evidently never cast. ** Deepdene Bold + Bold Italic (1934, Lanston Monotype) Goudy's italic typewriter font, made for Remington * Remington Typewriter (1927, Lanston Monotype) Though intended to be used on Remington typewriters, it was eventually picked up by Monotype. An attempt to avoid the feeling of unevenness of monospaced typefaces (which tend to make letters like 'i' seem too wide and 'W' too squashed) through creating an italic design. Goudy wrote that although he was paid well for the design, he did not know if it had ever been used by Remington. * Record Title (1927), inspired by Roman capitals, privately cast for Architectural Record magazine at the commission of Charles DeVinne, grandson of the famous printer and type designer, Theodore Low De Vinne. * Goudy Dutch (1927, nc), designs complete but never cut, all traces lost in Goudy's 1939 studio fire. Based on the handwriting of a letter from a correspondent in the Netherlands, rather than on Dutch printing styles. * Goudytype (1928, ATF), designed and cut in 1916, not cast and sold until later. Goudy Text in a modern digitisation * Goudy Text (1928, Continental, later Lanston Monotype) Originally named 'Goudy Black'. A blackletter design, \\"text\\" is short for textura, another term for blackletter. Tracy admired it as \\"wholly admirable...the letters are very well matched to each other and produce a fine result when composed in text.\\" * Inscription Greek (1929, nc), a font of the eleven Greek capitals not found in the Roman alphabet. These were intended to be used with Kennerley Old Style small caps to form a Greek font. Lombardic Capitals in metal type * Lombardic Capitals (1929, Continental + Lanston Monotype), capitals only, intended to serve as alternate, decorative capitals for Goudy Text. * Goudy Sans Serif series An eccentric display-oriented sans-serif design with a highly calligraphic italic. Considered little-used by Goudy in his memoir, although digitised and revived several times since. ** Goudy Sans Serif Heavy or Sans Serif Bold (1929, Lanston Monotype) ** Goudy Sans Serif Light (1930, Lanston Monotype) ** Goudy Sans Serif Light Italic (1931, Lanston Monotype) * Kaatskill (1929, Continental), a private face cut for the Limited Editions Club edition of Rip Van Winkle. * Strathmore Title (1929), designed as part of a project for Strathmore Paper Company, only fourteen letters were cut before the project was abandoned. 1930 to 1934 * Unnamed (two faces) (1930), two designs with job numbers from 1930 were destroyed in the fire of 1939. Nothing else known. Goudy Trajan in a modern digitisation * Trajan Title (1930, Continental, later Monotype Ltd.), a private face in the U.S., it was marketed in England and Europe by British Monotype. * Mediaeval (1930, Continental). A free, romanised blackletter, inspired by 'a twelfth-century South German manuscript hand', and popular in Goudy's lifetime. * Advertisers Modern (1930, privately cast), cut for the Manuel Rosenberg, publisher of The Advertiser. Apparently little-used, but Goudy retained a proof, shown in his autobiography. Goudy Stout in a modern digitisation * Goudy Stout, only cut in 24 pt. capitals. Goudy described it as unpopular in his lifetime, but revived several times since. Published 1939, Continental. Digital revivals by Castle Type, Rimmer and by Vincent Connare for Microsoft. * Truesdell + Italic (1930, Continental), first used for a preface published in the Colophon No. 5 and named for Goudy's mother. ** Truesdell Italic (1931, Continental) * Goudy Ornate or Ornate Title (1930, Continental), capitals only. * Deepdene Open Text (1931, Continental), cut as headings for a book by Edmund G. Greiss. A blackletter font for titles and headings, intended to complement but not match Deepdene. ** Deepdene Text (1931, Continental), basically just a \\"filled-in\\" version of Deepdene Open Text. * Goethe (1932, Continental), basically a lighter version of Goudy Modern, cut for the Goethe Centenary Exhibition in Leipzig. ** Goethe Italic (1932, Continental), cut for the Limited Editions Club edition of Frankenstein. * Quinian Old Style (1932, nc), named for the editor of American Mercury who commissioned the type, however the drawings were rejected and subsequently perished in Goudy's studio fire of 1939. * Mostert (1932, nc), inspired by the calligraphy of Annelise Mostert. Project never progressed beyond first round of proofs. Goudy donated Mostert's text sample to the Library of Congress. * Aries (re-cut) (1932, Continental), later sold to Edwin Grabhorn, a San Francisco printer, who had it cast by Lanston Monotype and renamed it Franciscan. Subsequently cast by McKenzie & Harris. * Goudy Boldface (1932, nc), level of completion uncertain, records lost in Goudy's 1939 studio fire. * Goudy Book (1933, nc), designs complete but never cut, all traces lost in Goudy's 1939 studio fire. * Mercury (1933, nc), designs complete but never cut, all traces lost in Goudy's 1939 studio fire. * Saks Goudy, Italic & Bold Caps (1934), a private type cast for Saks Fifth Avenue department store. ** Saks Goudy Bold Caps actually consists of the small capitals of larger sizes cast on larger bodies. * Hasbrouck (1934, nc), designs complete but never cut, all traces lost in Goudy's 1939 studio fire * Textbook Old Style (1934, nc), designs complete but never cut, all traces lost in Goudy's 1939 studio fire.. 1935 to 1938 * Tory Text (1935, Continental), blackletter based on the letters of Geoffroy Tory.

Capitals later cannibalized for New Village Text. * Atlantis (1935, nc), designs complete but never cut, all traces lost in Goudy's 1939 studio fire. * Millvale (1935, nc), designs complete but never cut, all traces lost in Goudy's 1939 studio fire. * Bertham (1936, Continental), named in memory of Goudy's wife, Bertha M. Goudy, who had died the year before. Goudy's 100th typeface, done by request for American Printer Magazine. Based on Leonard Holle's 1482 design. * Pax (1936, nc), matrices were cut, but Goudy was disappointed with the results and never cast the type. * Ampersands (1936, nc), a collection of 65 ampersands engraved for the Typophiles club in New York for an article on the topic. A reproduction is in Goudy's 1946 memoirs. Most digitised. * Friar (1937, Continental), designed for his own amusement, Goudy only cast a few fonts of this face in 12 point. Inspired by uncial script but with an upper and lower case. =University of California Old Style= University of California Old Style in regular and italic styles, compared to two digitisations: Californian FB and ITC Berkeley Old Style Medium Goudy's 'California' font (1938, Continental) was cut for the University of California Press. It is a 'Venetian' typeface, loosely inspired by the work of Nicolas Jenson. One of Goudy's most popular designs, several releases exist. After the original type was commissioned for private use, 'California' was released publicly by different companies, first in 1958, by Lanston Monotype as 'Californian' and then famously under the name of 'Berkeley Old Style' by ITC. In digital versions, 'California' was released by ITC under its pre-existing brand, as 'Californian' by LTC and Font Bureau (in different digitisations) and by Richard Beatty under the name of 'University Old Style'. Late designs, 1938 to 1945 * New Village Text (1938, Continental), not a new face but a mongrel cast by Goudy's son consisting of capitals from Tory Text and lower-case letters from Deepdene Text. * Murchison (1938, Photostat Corporation): an experimental design in the new technology of cold type or phototypesetting, which did not become popular until after the end of Goudy's life. Named for the president of Photostat Corporation. * Bulmer (1939, nc), an attempt to design a lower-case for fine capitals by William Bulmer, never completed. * Scripps College Old Style (1941), a private face cast for Scripps College. Commissioned by college librarian Dorothy Drake, it was intended for the use of students interested in book making. Later released by Monotype. ** Scrips College Italic (1944) * Spencer Old Style + Italic (1943, nc), commissioned for a large book printing firm but never accepted due to wartime restrictions. Later the design was given to Syracuse University and named for H. Lyle Spencer, dean of the School of Journalism. * Marlborough Text (1944, Continental), a private face for International Printing Company. Though a complete design, only the letters to print \\"Certificate of Honor\\" were ever cut. * Hebrew University (1945, nc), a font of Hebrew letters commissioned by the American Friends of the Hebrew University in Jerusalem. No casting information available. * Goudy Thirty (1953, Lanston Monotype), cut with the intention of being issued after Goudy's death, \\"thirty\\" being a newspaper term for the end of the story. Goudy finished work on it in 1942 and Monotype waited several years after his death in 1947 before issuing the font. The font is inspired by 'rotunda', a style of blackletter handwriting popular in southern Europe in the medieval period. Lawson reports that it was not a great financial success for Monotype, as blackletter type was unfashionable at the time, but that Bruce Rogers was a great admirer of the design. \\"Goudy\\" faces designed by others * Hearst (1902, Inland Type Foundry). Goudy claimed that this had been copied from lettering he had done for a book of verses for children. It is similar to his Pabst Roman. * Powell Italic (1908, Keystone Foundry), designed in-house by Keystone. Has the distinction of being the first \\"non-kerning\\" italic where no character overhangs the body, an idea that proved quite popular. This is accomplished through the use of reverse curves in the taller letters, which first ascend to the right and then curve back to the left to avoid overhanging the next character. * Goudy Bold (1916, ATF) and Goudy Bold Italic (1919, ATF), were designed by Morris Fuller Benton as companions to Goudy Old Style. The Lanston Monotype version of the italic includes cursive capitals by Sol Hess. There are some detail differences compared to Goudy Old Style Roman: the 'W' has three terminals not four and there is no serif at bottom right of the 'C'. * Goudy Title (1918, ATF) is a full size variation on Goudy's small capitals from his Goudy Old Style and was designed by Morris Fuller Benton. * Goudy Catalog (1919, ATF) and Goudy Catalog Italic (1921, ATF), were designed by Morris Fuller Benton as medium weight companions to Goudy Old Style. * Goudy Handtooled + Italic (1922, ATF), were in-line versions of Goudy Bold + Italic and were probably designed by Charles H. Becker, though other authorities credit either Morris Fuller Benton or Wadsworth A. Parker. Again, the Lanston Monotype version of the italic includes cursive capitals by Sol Hess. The 1937 textbook 26 Lead Soldiers called it \\"Goudy Bold in a tuxedo.\\" Morison was notably unimpressed by it. * Italian Old Style Wide (1924, Lanston Monotype), designed by Sol Hess as a companion to Goudy's Italian Old Style. * Number Eleven series (1924, Ludlow), are out-and-out copies of the Goudy Old Style series. * Kennerley Open Capitals (1925, Lanston Monotype), were designed by Sol Hess. * Goudy Heavy Face Open (1926, Lanston Monotype) and Goudy Heavy Face Condensed (1927, Lanston Monotype), were designed by Sol Hess. * Goudy Extra Bold + Italic (1927, ATF), were a further extension of the Goudy Old Style series by Morris Fuller Benton. * Foster Italic and Moore Italic (1927, BB&S;), were designed by Richard N. McArthur, and based on the English alteration of Goudy Lanston mentioned above. Hadriano inlined in metal type * Hadriano Stone Cut (1932, Lanston Monotype), was an in-line version of Hadriano Title designed by Sol Hess. * Goudy Text Shaded (Lanston Monotype), was designed in house by Monotype. * Pabst Old Style Condensed (Mergenthaler Linotype), was designed in house by Linotype. Pabst Extra Bold, though also cast by Linotype, has no relation to Goudy's face and is actually a knock-off of Cooper Black. * Goudy Fancy (1970s), italic-only, origin uncertain but resembles a more condensed version of Goudy Heavy italic so may be based on that or one of Goudy's lettering projects. Has been digitised by Canada Type as 'Goudy Two Shoes'. * Berkeley Old Style (1983, ITC), adaptation of Goudy's University of California Old Style (1938). See above. * Daylilies, floral capitals based on Goudy Old Style by Judith Sutcliff. * Goudy Swash, a URW++ release of Goudy Old Style Italic (only) with swash caps. Goudy also cut the matrices for Foster Abstract, an ultra-bold Art Deco block letter designed by his friend Robert Foster. 1931, Continental with matrices cut by Goudy and cast privately. Goudy personally felt that the design 'violated every canon of type design'. Considering digital revivals of Goudy's non-character typefaces, P22 has also published an anthology of Goudy's ornament designs, released along with their collection of Goudy's ampersands; Parachute Fonts has also released adaptations of Goudy's initials for Greek and Cyrillic.

L. (1865). Proceedings of the Zoological Society of London: London Academic Press. They, like their relatives, are native to the savannah of north-east South Africa, north to Zimbabwe, west into Botswana, the Caprivi Strip in Namibia, and southern Angola.Equus quagga, IUCN Like the other subspecies of plain's zebra, it is a herbivore that exists largely on a diet of grasses, and undertakes a migration during the wet season to find fresh sources of food and to avoid lions, which are their primary predator. Chapman's zebras are distinguished from other subspecies by subtle variations in their stripes. When compared to other equids in the region Chapman's zebras are relatively abundant in number, however its population is now in decline largely because of human factors such as poaching and farming. Studies and breeding programs have been undertaken with the hope of arresting this decline, with a focus on ensuring zebras bred in captivity are equipped for life in the wild, and that non-domesticated populations are able to freely migrate. A problem faced by some of these programs is that captive Chapman's zebra populations experience higher incidences of diagnosed diseases that non-domesticated populations due to the fact that they live longer, and so are less likely to die in the wild from predation or a lack of food or water. Description The unique stripes of the Chapman's zebra. Chapman's zebras are single-hoofed mammals that are a part of the odd-toed ungulate order. They differ from other zebras in that their stripes continue past their knees, and that they also have somewhat brown stripes in addition to the black and white stripes that are typically associated with zebras. The pastern is also not completely black on the lower half. Each zebra has its own unique stripe pattern that also includes shadow stripes. When foals are born, they have brown stripes, and in some cases, adults do not develop the black colouration on their hides and keep their brown stripes. In the wild Chapman's zebra live on average to 25 years of age, however that can live to be up to 38 years of age in captivity. Males usually weigh and stand at tall. Females weigh about and stand as tall as the males. Foals weigh 25-50 kg (55-88 lb) at birth. Adult zebras can run at up to 56 kilometres per hour (35 miles per hour) and have strong eyesight and hearing which are essential evolutionary defence mechanisms.  Ecology  = Diet = Chapman's zebras have been observed to spend a large portion of their day feeding (approximately 50%), and primarily consume low-quality grasses found in savannas, grasslands, and shrublands, however they occasionally eat wild berries and other plants in order to increase protein intake. While they show a preference for short grasses, unlike some other grazing animals they also eat long grasses and so play an important role by consuming the upper portion of long grass that has grown in the wet season to then allow for other animals to feed. Young foals are reliant on their mothers for sustenance for approximately the first 12 months of their lives as their teeth are unable to properly breakdown the tough grasses that the adults eat until the enamel has sufficiently worn away. = Migration = During the dry season Chapman's zebras tend not to stray too far from a water source as they frequently have to drink. During the wet season however, the zebras will join together in large herds consisting of many harems and migrate in order to find abundant food sources to feed on after the relatively sparse dry season They also try to avoid other animal migrations so as to lower competition for food. As they only require lower-quality foraging, Chapman's zebras prefer to migrate to areas with a greater density of food, and will prioritise quantity ahead of quality. By optimising foraging density and avoiding other foraging species, Chapman's zebras are able to sustain large populations which rapidly deplete foraging areas forcing them to continue migrating. In addition, Chapman's zebras also exhibit a cyclical daily movement whereby they prefer grasslands during the day and woodlands during the night so as to avoid lions, which are their main predator. They frequently move around and actively avoid areas where they recently observed lion activity. Social behaviour Chapman's zebras are highly sociable animals that live in herds of up to tens of thousands of individuals. The larger herd is composed of harems with permanent members; consisting of one herd stallion, one to six females, and their offspring. They rarely exhibit aggressive behaviour towards each other or other species. Males without a harem have also been observed to form long term cliques of their own with other bachelor males which has been shown to improve their social skills. Stallion-stallion groups are uncommon, and in the cases where they do form they are short-lasting. The females stay in the same harems all of their lives. A Chapman's zebra harem. Chapman's zebras spend time resting during the day but are more active at dusk. This is most likely a defensive behavioural trait as predators are more prevalent at this time of day, and so it is beneficial for members of the herd to be more vigilant at these times. On occasion a small group will rush at a potential predator in an attempt to deter them from attacking, however in general Chapman's zebras prefer to avoid any such conflicts. Within their harems there has been observed hierarchical social structures which dictate things such as the movements of the group, through to how they care for their offspring. High- ranking mares in particular exert pressure on the group in order to promote the survival of their own foals. When foraging, Chapman's zebras rely on the dominant member of the harem to lead them to water and food sources. The success of high-ranking harem members at leading the group to food and water determines whether they maintain leadership into the future, and shows how the zebras value stability in their respective groups. Leadership roles can change over time however. Older mares often have a higher social rank than younger harem members. Lactating females are also able to initiate movement within a harem which in turn can sometimes influence the movements of the whole herd. When a pregnant mare gives birth her foal assumes the same social status within the harem as her. From a young age foals are able to recognise the scent and sound of their mother and form bonds together that last into adulthood. This ability to recognise other zebras does not diminish into adulthood where they are able to differentiate amongst other group members. This is essential for creating stability within groups, which lowers inter- group competition for resources and thus improves survival. In captivity has been shown that Chapman's zebras form unique relationships with different keepers and that they repeatedly alter their behaviour depending on which keeper is interacting with them. A mare with her foal.  Reproduction  Males will typically fight one another in front of a group of females before they mate with them, with the highest-ranking mare in the harem the first to mate. The gestation period for Chapman's zebras is around 12 months, after which time the female will give birth to a single foal. The foal is quickly able to walk with the rest of the group which is essential for its survival, as it ensures that the mother doesn't have to leave it behind for the good of the other members of the harem. Each subsequent pregnancy has a shorter inter- birth period than the one before it as the mare become more adept at raising her foals. Male zebras that are members of the harem but not the father of the foal have been reported to practice infanticide. This has been observed in particular in captive species where zebras from different social groups are kept in close proximity. It is also possible for Chapman's zebras to be bred via an equine surrogate, as was first done in 1984.  Conservation  While not considered a threatened species, Chapman's zebras are extinct in Burundi and Lesotho, and possibly also in Somalia. Total numbers have declined approximately 25% in recent years due to human activities including farming, hunting, poaching, and droughts exacerbated by climate change. Human settlements also impact population sizes by interrupting migratory patterns and thus limiting the availability of dense food sources necessary for the sustenance of large herds. This diminishes the ease at which the zebras migrate and so they cannot find food as readily. There is evidence that wildlife corridors could be used to re-establish migratory patterns by linking up ecosystems, and that the zebras would be able to adapt to these new migration paths. Other conservation efforts have taken place in an attempt to stabilise the population. A program at the Majete Wildlife Reserve undertook a captive breeding and reintroduction program, however it is unknown whether the zebras have the abilities required to survive, in the wild having been raised in captivity. Research at the Werribee Zoological Park aimed to create a more realistic environment for the zebras so that they can be more seamlessly reintroduced, and to then provide guidance for other breeding programs around the world. However, one particular issue in breeding programs is how to safely replicate the threat of predators so that the zebras are prepared for the wild. This threat impacts a number of aspects of their lives, such as when they eat, when they rest, and when they move. As yet no solution has been found. = Diseases = Like other herbivores Chapman's zebra are susceptible to hydatidosis, a parasitic disease, but it is not often attributed as a cause of death. Infected zebras can live undiagnosed for many years without symptoms and it is not considered a serious threat. Chapman's zebras are also carriers of nematode parasites which reside in their large intestine and cause an infection called helminthiasis, which can be fatal if left untreated. In captive populations where life expectancy is longer, pituitary pars intermedia dysfunction (PPID) or equine Cushing's disease causes excessive hormone production in zebras which commonly leads to other painful chronic conditions. A growing body of research is finding ways for zoos to better identify and treat PPID so as to improve the life expectancy and quality of life of no just Chapman's zebras, but all equids. Captive populations can also uniquely develop flexure deformity of the distal interphalangeal joint, or club foot, a condition not observed in non-domesticated populations and one that is best treated through surgery.

Beckermann lives and works as an author and filmmaker in Vienna and Paris. Her films have been shown at prestigious festivals (most of them premiered at the Berlin International Film Festival or the Cin√©ma du R√©el Festival in Paris). Her films Paper Bridge and East of War have won several major awards.  Life and career Ruth Beckermann was born in Vienna, Austria in 1952. Her parents were Jewish survivors of the Holocaust. Beckermann studied Journalism and Art History in Vienna and Tel Aviv, and received her doctorate in 1977. In New York she studied Photography at the School of Visual Arts. During her studies she worked as an editor for the magazines Weltwoche and Trend. Her first film was made in cooperation with Josef Aichholzer and Franz Grafl of the Videogroup Arena in 1977. Shot on video and 16mm film, Arena Besetzt (Arena Squatted) documented the occupation of the old Viennese slaughterhouse Arena. The following year, Beckermann founded the film distribution company Filmladen along with Aichholzer and Grafl, where she continued working until 1985. In 1978 and 1981, filmed shot two documentaries, Suddenly A Strike and The Steelhammer Out there on The Grass on the topics of labour and strike. She also wrote her first books during that period of time. In 1983, Beckermann released Return to Vienna, which documents the journeys and experiences of Franz West, a Jewish Social- Democrat living in Vienna during the First and Second World War. The film is the first of a trilogy, in which Beckermann deals with Jewish narratives of loss, memory and identity. Following this film, Paper Bridge was released in 1987 and depicts a journey leading from Vienna to Romania, where Beckermann visits the Bukovina region, the birthplace of her father during a time when this region was still under Habsburg rule. In Towards Jerusalem Beckermann travels between Tel Aviv and Jerusalem while exploring the Zionist utopia of a Jewish homeland. These films - Return to Vienna, Paper Bridge and Towards Jerusalem use different forms of travel as both content and formal organizing principle. In 1996, East of War was made during the so-called Wehrmachtsausstellung. In front of the out-of-focus-photographs, former soldiers of the German Wehrmacht talk about their experiences beyond the \\"normal\\" war. A film which not only pushes forward the destruction of the \\"good-Wehrmacht\\" myth, but also takes a close look at the process of constructing history in post-World War II Austria. In her 1999 film, A Fleeting Passage to The Orient, she follows the traces of Elisabeth of Bavaria. In 2001, homemad(e) depicts how the political turn in 2000 was reflected in a Viennese coffee house.

According to The Canadian Encyclopedia, the choir achieved \\"a national reputation for their fine choral blend and sense of style\\". The group was sometimes referred to as the \\"Sunday Chorale\\", after the name of the weekly CBC Radio program on which the choir was featured from 1952-1969. Notable members of the chorus included Evelyne Anderson, Devina Bailey, Lorne Betts, Kathleen Morrison Brown, Reginald Hugo, May Lawson, Joan Maxwell, Phyllis Cooke Thomson, and Gladys Whitehead. History Founded under the name the Oriana Singers in 1936 by composer and conductor W.H. Anderson, The Choristers initially consisted of 14 singers and specialized in performing madrigals, motets, folksong arrangements, and sacred and secular partsongs. Pianist Gordon Kushner notably served as the group's first accompanist. In 1942 the choir changed its name to The Choristers and expanded to 20 singers. This expansion was done in order to meet the new recording needs of the group as they began giving weekly national broadcasts for the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation on 2 June 1942. The group occasionally performed with orchestras for their CBC broadcasts, often working with conductors Geoffrey Waddington and Eric Wild for these performances. In 1952, the group's weekly broadcast was retitled Sunday Chorale at which time the repertoire of the program changed to one consisting entirely of sacred choral music. Many of the works were accompanied, first by organist Hugh Bancroft, and later by organists Herbert Sadler and Filmer Hubble. In 1955 Anderson stepped down as The Choristers director just a few months prior to his death. Hubble, who had been his pupil as well as serving as the choir's organist, took over as the choir's director. He led the group until his death in 1969 when Herbert Belyea, another Anderson pupil and a tenor in the choir, assumed the role of director. Belyea conducted the choir until it was dis-established in 1974. After Anderson's death the group ceased to perform weekly broadcasts but did appear intermittently on CBC Radio during the 1970s.

The dynasty was founded by the Lithuanian Grand Duke Jogaila (W≈Çadys≈Çaw II Jagie≈Ç≈Ço), whose marriage to Queen Jadwiga of Poland formed a Polish‚ÄìLithuanian union. The partnership brought vast territories controlled by the Grand Duchy of Lithuania into Poland's sphere of influence and proved beneficial for both the Polish and Lithuanian people, who coexisted and cooperated in one of the largest political entities in Europe for the next four centuries. In the Baltic Sea region, Poland maintained an ongoing conflict with the Teutonic Knights. The struggles led to a major battle, the Battle of Grunwald of 1410, but there was also the milestone Peace of Thorn of 1466 under King Casimir IV Jagiellon; the treaty created the future Duchy of Prussia. In the south, Poland confronted the Ottoman Empire and the Crimean Tatars, and in the east helped Lithuania fight the Grand Duchy of Moscow. Poland's and Lithuania's territorial expansion included the far north region of Livonia. In the Jagiellonian period, Poland developed as a feudal state with a predominantly agricultural economy and an increasingly dominant landed nobility. The Nihil novi act adopted by the Polish Sejm in 1505 transferred most of the legislative power in the state from the monarch to the Sejm. This event marked the beginning of the period known as \\"Golden Liberty\\", when the state was ruled by the \\"free and equal\\" members of the Polish nobility. Protestant Reformation movements made deep inroads into Polish Christianity, which resulted in unique policies of religious tolerance in the Europe of that time. The European Renaissance as fostered by the late Jagiellonian Kings Sigismund I the Old and Sigismund II Augustus resulted in an immense cultural flowering (see Renaissance in Poland).  Late Middle Ages (14th‚Äì15th century)  = Jagiellonian monarchy = W≈Çadys≈Çaw II Jagie≈Ç≈Ço In 1385, the Union of Krewo was signed between Queen Jadwiga of Poland and Jogaila, the Grand Duke of Lithuania, the ruler of the last pagan state in Europe. The act arranged for Jogaila's baptism and the couple's marriage, which established the beginning of the Polish-Lithuanian union. After Jogaila's baptism, he was known in Poland by his baptismal name W≈Çadys≈Çaw and the Polish version of his Lithuanian name, Jagie≈Ç≈Ço. The union strengthened both nations in their shared opposition to the Teutonic Knights and the growing threat of the Grand Duchy of Moscow. Vast expanses of Rus' lands, including the Dnieper River basin and territories extending south to the Black Sea, were at that time under Lithuanian control. In order to gain control of these vast holdings, Lithuanians and Ruthenians had fought the Battle of Blue Waters in 1362 or 1363 against the invading Mongols and had taken advantage of the power vacuum to the south and east that resulted from the Mongol destruction of Kievan Rus'. The population of the Grand Duchy's enlarged territory was accordingly heavily Ruthenian and Eastern Orthodox. The territorial expansion led to a confrontation between Lithuania and the Grand Duchy of Moscow, which found itself emerging from the Tatar rule and itself in a process of expansion. Uniquely in Europe, the union connected two states geographically located on the opposite sides of the great civilizational divide between the Western Christian or Latin world, and the Eastern Christian or Byzantine world. The intention of the union was to create a common state under W≈Çadys≈Çaw Jagie≈Ç≈Ço, but the ruling oligarchy of Poland learned that their goal of incorporating Lithuania into Poland was unrealistic. Territorial disputes led to warfare between Poland and Lithuania or Lithuanian factions; the Lithuanians at times even found it expedient to conspire with the Teutonic Knights against the Poles.A Traveller's History of Poland, by John Radzilowski; Northampton, Massachusetts: Interlink Books, 2007, , p. 63-65 Geographic consequences of the dynastic union and the preferences of the Jagiellonian kings instead created a process of orientating Polish territorial priorities to the east. Between 1386 and 1572, the Polish-Lithuanian union was ruled by a succession of constitutional monarchs of the Jagiellonian dynasty. The political influence of the Jagiellonian kings gradually diminished during this period, while the landed nobility took over an ever-increasing role in central government and national affairs. The royal dynasty, however, had a stabilizing effect on Poland's politics. The Jagiellonian Era is often regarded as a period of maximum political power, great prosperity, and in its later stage, a Golden Age of Polish culture. = Social and economic developments = Poland and Lithuania, 1386‚Äì1434 The feudal rent system prevalent in the 13th and 14th centuries, under which each estate had well defined rights and obligations, degenerated around the 15th century as the nobility tightened their control over manufacturing, trade and other economic activities. This created many directly owned agricultural enterprises known as folwarks in which feudal rent payments were replaced with forced labor on the lord's land. This limited the rights of cities and forced most of the peasants into serfdom.A Concise History of Poland, by Jerzy Lukowski and Hubert Zawadzki. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2nd edition 2006, , p. 68-69 Such practices were increasingly sanctioned by the law. For example, the Piotrk√≥w Privilege of 1496, granted by King Jan I Albert, banned rural land purchases by townspeople and severely limited the ability of peasant farmers to leave their villages. Polish towns, lacking national representation protecting their class interests, preserved some degree of self-government (city councils and jury courts), and the trades were able to organize and form guilds. The nobility soon excused themselves from their principal duty: mandatory military service in case of war (pospolite ruszenie). The division of the nobility into two main layers was institutionalized, but never legally formalized, in the Nihil novi \\"constitution\\" of 1505, which required the king to consult the general sejm, that is the Senate, as well as the lower chamber of (regional) deputies, the Sejm proper, before enacting any changes. The masses of ordinary nobles szlachta competed or tried to compete against the uppermost rank of their class, the magnates, for the duration of Poland's independent existence. = Poland and Lithuania in personal union under Jagie≈Ç≈Ço = Sarcophagus of King W≈Çadys≈Çaw Jagie≈Ç≈Ço, Wawel Cathedral The first king of the new dynasty was Jogaila, the Grand Duke of Lithuania, who was known as W≈Çadys≈Çaw II Jagie≈Ç≈Ço in Poland. He was elected king of Poland in 1386 after his marriage to Jadwiga of Anjou, the Queen of Poland in her own right, and his conversion to Roman Catholicism. The Christianization of Lithuania in the Latin Rite followed. Jogaila's rivalry in Lithuania with his cousin Vytautas the Great, who was opposed to Lithuania's domination by Poland,A Concise History of Poland, by Jerzy Lukowski and Hubert Zawadzki, p. 41 was settled in 1392 in the Ostr√≥w Agreement and in 1401 in the Union of Vilnius and Radom: Vytautas became the Grand Duke of Lithuania for life under Jogaila's nominal supremacy. The agreement made possible a close cooperation between the two nations necessary to succeed in struggles with the Teutonic Order. The Union of Horod≈Ço of 1413 defined the relationship further and granted privileges to the Roman Catholic (as opposed to Eastern Orthodox) segment of the Lithuanian nobility. = Struggle with the Teutonic Knights = Battle of Grunwald (or Tannenberg) The Polish‚ÄìLithuanian‚ÄìTeutonic War of 1409‚Äì1411, precipitated by the Samogitian uprisings in Lithuanian territories controlled by the State of the Teutonic Order, culminated in the Battle of Grunwald (Tannenberg), in which the combined forces of the Polish and Lithuanian-Rus' armies completely defeated the Teutonic Knights. The offensive that followed lost its impact with the ineffective siege of Malbork (Marienburg). The failure to take the fortress and eliminate the Teutonic (later Prussian) state had dire historic consequences for Poland in the 18th, 19th and 20th centuries. The Peace of Thorn of 1411 gave Poland and Lithuania rather modest territorial adjustments, including Samogitia. Afterwards, there were more military campaigns and peace deals that did not hold. One unresolved arbitration took place at the Council of Constance. In 1415, Paulus Vladimiri, rector of the Krak√≥w Academy, presented his Treatise on the Power of the Pope and the Emperor in respect to Infidels at the council, in which he advocated tolerance, criticized the violent conversion methods of the Teutonic Knights, and postulated that pagans have the right to peaceful coexistence with Christians and political independence. This stage of the Polish-Lithuanian conflict with the Teutonic Order ended with the Treaty of Melno in 1422. The Polish-Teutonic War of 1431-35 (see Battle of Pabaiskas) was concluded with the Peace of Brze≈õƒá Kujawski in 1435. = The Hussite movement and the Polish‚ÄìHungarian union = Zbigniew Ole≈õnicki with a colleague in a foundation scene During the Hussite Wars of 1420‚Äì1434, Jagie≈Ç≈Ço, Vytautas and Sigismund Korybut were involved in political and military intrigues with respect to the Czech crown, which was offered by the Hussites to Jagie≈Ç≈Ço in 1420. Bishop Zbigniew Ole≈õnicki became known as the leading opponent of a union with the Hussite Czech state. The Jagiellonian dynasty was not entitled to automatic hereditary succession, rather each new king had to be approved by nobility consensus. W≈Çadys≈Çaw Jagie≈Ç≈Ço had two sons late in life from his last wife Sophia of Halshany. In 1430, the nobility agreed to the succession of the future W≈Çadys≈Çaw III only after the king consented to a series of concessions. In 1434, the old monarch died and his minor son W≈Çadys≈Çaw was crowned; the Royal Council led by Bishop Ole≈õnicki undertook the regency duties. King Casimir IV Jagiellon was married to Elisabeth of Habsburg; of their many children four became kings In 1438, the Czech anti-Habsburg opposition, mainly Hussite factions, offered the Czech crown to Jagie≈Ç≈Ço's younger son Casimir. The idea, accepted in Poland over Ole≈õnicki's objections, resulted in two unsuccessful Polish military expeditions to Bohemia. After Vytautas' death in 1430, Lithuania became embroiled in internal wars and conflicts with Poland. Casimir, sent as a boy by King W≈Çadys≈Çaw on a mission there in 1440, was surprisingly proclaimed by the Lithuanians as their Grand Duke, and he remained in Lithuania. Ole≈õnicki gained the upper hand again and pursued his long-term objective of Poland's union with Hungary. At that time, the Ottoman Empire embarked on a fresh round of European conquests and threatened Hungary, which needed the assistance of the powerful Polish‚ÄìLithuanian ally. In 1440, W≈Çadys≈Çaw III assumed the Hungarian throne. Influenced by Julian Cesarini, the young king led the Hungarian army against the Ottomans in 1443 and again in 1444. Like Cesarini, W≈Çadys≈Çaw III was killed at the Battle of Varna. Casimir Jagiellon, sarcophagus sculpture by Veit Stoss, Wawel Cathedral Beginning near the end of Jagie≈Ç≈Ço's life, Poland was governed in practice by an oligarchy of magnates led by Bishop Ole≈õnicki. The rule of the dignitaries was actively opposed by various groups of szlachta. Their leader Spytek of Melsztyn was killed at the Battle of Grotniki in 1439, which allowed Ole≈õnicki to purge Poland of the remaining Hussite sympathizers and pursue his other objectives without significant opposition. = The accession of Casimir IV Jagiellon = In 1445, Casimir, the Grand Duke of Lithuania, was asked to assume the Polish throne vacated upon the death of his brother W≈Çadys≈Çaw. Casimir was a tough negotiator and did not accept the Polish nobility's conditions for his election. He finally arrived in Poland and was crowned in 1447 on his own terms. His assumption of the Crown of Poland freed Casimir from the control that the Lithuanian oligarchy had imposed on him; in the Vilnius Privilege of 1447, he declared the Lithuanian nobility to have equal rights with Polish szlachta. In time, Casimir was able to wrest power from Cardinal Ole≈õnicki and his group. He replaced their influence with a power base built on the younger middle nobility. Casimir was able to resolve a conflict with the pope and the local Church hierarchy over the right to fill vacant bishop positions in his favor. = War with the Teutonic Order and its resolution = Late medieval Krak√≥w (Cracow) In 1454, the Prussian Confederation, an alliance of Prussian cities and nobility opposed to the increasingly oppressive rule of the Teutonic Knights, asked King Casimir to take over Prussia and initiated an armed uprising against the Knights. Casimir declared a war on the Order and the formal incorporation of Prussia into the Polish Crown; those events led to the Thirteen Years' War of 1454‚Äì66. The mobilization of the Polish forces (the pospolite ruszenie) was weak at first, since the szlachta would not cooperate without concessions from Casimir that were formalized in the Statutes of Nieszawa promulgated in 1454. This prevented a takeover of all of Prussia, but in the Second Peace of Thorn in 1466, the Knights had to surrender the western half of their territory to the Polish Crown (the areas known afterwards as Royal Prussia, a semi-autonomous entity), and to accept Polish-Lithuanian suzerainty over the remainder (the later Ducal Prussia). Poland regained Pomerelia, with its access to the Baltic Sea, as well as Warmia. In addition to land warfare, naval battles took place in which ships provided by the City of Danzig (Gda≈Ñsk) successfully fought Danish and Teutonic fleets. Other territories recovered by the Polish Crown in the 15th-century include the Duchy of O≈õwiƒôcim and Duchy of Zator on Silesia's border with Lesser Poland, and there was notable progress regarding the incorporation of the Piast Masovian duchies into the Crown. = Turkish and Tatar wars = The influence of the Jagiellonian dynasty in Central Europe rose during the 15th century. In 1471, Casimir's son W≈Çadys≈Çaw became king of Bohemia, and in 1490, also of Hungary. The southern and eastern outskirts of Poland and Lithuania became threatened by Turkish invasions beginning in the late 15th century. Moldavia's involvement with Poland goes back to 1387, when Petru I, Hospodar of Moldavia sought protection against the Hungarians by paying homage to King W≈Çadys≈Çaw II Jagie≈Ç≈Ço in Lviv. This move gave Poland access to Black Sea ports. In 1485, King Casimir undertook an expedition into Moldavia after its seaports were overtaken by the Ottoman Turks. The Turkish-controlled Crimean Tatars raided the eastern territories in 1482 and 1487 until they were confronted by King John Albert, Casimir's son and successor. Poland was attacked in 1487‚Äì1491 by remnants of the Golden Horde that invaded Poland as far as Lublin before being beaten at Zaslavl. In 1497, King John Albert made an attempt to resolve the Turkish problem militarily, but his efforts were unsuccessful; he was unable to secure effective participation in the war by his brothers, King Vladislas (W≈Çadys≈Çaw) II of Bohemia and Hungary and Alexander, the Grand Duke of Lithuania, and he also faced resistance on the part of Stephen the Great, the ruler of Moldavia. More destructive Tatar raids instigated by the Ottoman Empire took place in 1498, 1499 and 1500. Diplomatic peace efforts initiated by John Albert were finalized after the king's death in 1503. They resulted in a territorial compromise and an unstable truce. Invasions into Poland and Lithuania from the Crimean Khanate took place in 1502 and 1506 during the reign of King Alexander. In 1506, the Tatars were defeated at the Battle of Kletsk by Michael Glinski. = Moscow's threat to Lithuania; accession of Sigismund I = fiefs (striped) and Lithuania in 1466 Lithuania was increasingly threatened by the growing power of the Grand Duchy of Moscow in the 15th and 16th centuries. Moscow indeed took over many of Lithuania's eastern possessions in military campaigns of 1471, 1492, and 1500. Grand Duke Alexander of Lithuania was elected King of Poland in 1501, after the death of John Albert. In 1506, he was succeeded by Sigismund I the Old (Zygmunt I Stary) in both Poland and Lithuania as political realities were drawing the two states closer together. Prior to his accession to the Polish throne, Sigismund had been a Duke of Silesia by the authority of his brother Vladislas II of Bohemia, but like other Jagiellon rulers before him, he did not pursue the claim of the Polish Crown to Silesia. = Culture in the Late Middle Ages = The culture of the 15th century Poland can be described as retaining typical medieval characteristics. Nonetheless, the crafts and industries in existence already in the preceding centuries became more highly developed under favorable social and economic conditions, and their products were much more widely disseminated. Paper production was one of the new industries that appeared, and printing developed during the last quarter of the century. In 1473, Kasper Straube produced the first Latin print in Krak√≥w, whereas Kasper Elyan printed Polish texts for the first time in Wroc≈Çaw (Breslau) in 1475. The world's oldest prints in Cyrillic script, namely religious texts in Old Church Slavonic, appeared after 1490 from the press of Schweipolt Fiol in Krakow.A Concise History of Poland, by Jerzy Lukowski and Hubert Zawadzki, p. 73 Luxury items were in high demand among the increasingly prosperous nobility, and to a lesser degree among the wealthy town merchants. Brick and stone residential buildings became common, but only in cities. The mature Gothic style was represented not only in architecture, but also in sacral wooden sculpture. The Altar of Veit Stoss in St. Mary's Basilica in Krak√≥w is one of the most magnificent art works of its kind in Europe. University of Krak√≥w ‚Äì Collegium Maius courtyard Krak√≥w University, which stopped functioning after the death of Casimir the Great, was renewed and rejuvenated around 1400. Augmented by a theology department, the \\"academy\\" was supported and protected by Queen Jadwiga and the Jagiellonian dynasty members, which is reflected in its present name: the Jagiellonian University. Europe's oldest department of mathematics and astronomy was established in 1405. Among the university's prominent scholars were Stanis≈Çaw of Skarbimierz, Paulus Vladimiri and Albert of Brudzewo, Copernicus' teacher. John of Ludzisko and Archbishop Gregory of Sanok, the precursors of Polish humanism, were professors at the university. Gregory's court was the site of an early literary society at Lw√≥w (Lviv) after he became the archbishop there. Scholarly thought elsewhere was represented by Jan Ostror√≥g, a political publicist and reformist, and Jan D≈Çugosz, a historian, whose Annals is the largest history work of his time in Europe and a fundamental source for history of medieval Poland. Distinguished and influential foreign humanists were also active in Poland. Filippo Buonaccorsi, a poet and diplomat, arrived from Italy in 1468 and stayed in Poland until his death in 1496. Known as Kallimach, he prepared biographies of Gregory of Sanok, Zbigniew Ole≈õnicki, and very likely Jan D≈Çugosz, besides establishing another literary society in Krak√≥w. He tutored and mentored the sons of Casimir IV and postulated unrestrained royal power. In Krak√≥w, the German humanist Conrad Celtes organized the humanist literary and scholarly association Sodalitas Litterarum Vistulana, the first in this part of Europe.  Early Modern Era (16th century)  = Agriculture-based economic expansion = King Alexander Jagiellon with Chancellor Jan ≈Åaski The folwark, a large-scale system of agricultural production based on serfdom, was a dominant feature on Poland's economic landscape beginning in the late 15th century and for the next 300 years. This dependence on nobility-controlled agriculture in central-eastern Europe diverged from the western part of the continent, where elements of capitalism and industrialization were developing to a much greater extent, with the attendant growth of a bourgeoisie class and its political influence. The 16th-century agricultural trade boom combined with free or very cheap peasant labor made the folwark economy very profitable. Senate Mining and metallurgy developed further during the 16th century, and technical progress took place in various commercial applications. Great quantities of exported agricultural and forest products floated down the rivers to be transported through ports and land routes. This resulted in a positive trade balance for Poland throughout the 16th century. Imports from the West included industrial products, luxury products and fabrics.J√≥zef Andrzej Gierowski ‚Äì Historia Polski 1505‚Äì1764 (History of Poland 1505‚Äì1764), p. 24-38 Most of the exported grain left Poland through Danzig (Gda≈Ñsk), which became the wealthiest, most highly developed, and most autonomous of the Polish cities because of its location at the mouth of the Vistula River and access to the Baltic Sea. It was also by far the largest center for manufacturing. Other towns were negatively affected by Danzig's near-monopoly in foreign trade, but profitably participated in transit and export activities. The largest of those were Krak√≥w (Cracow), Pozna≈Ñ, Lw√≥w (Lviv), and Warszawa (Warsaw), and outside of the Crown, Breslau (Wroc≈Çaw). Thorn (Toru≈Ñ) and Elbing (ElblƒÖg) were the main cities in Royal Prussia after Danzig.A Concise History of Poland, by Jerzy Lukowski and Hubert Zawadzki, p. 65, 68 = Burghers and nobles = Gothic Altar of Veit Stoss was funded by the burghers of Krak√≥w During the 16th century, prosperous patrician families of merchants, bankers, or industrial investors, many of German origin, still conducted large-scale business operations in Europe or lent money to Polish noble interests, including the royal court. Some regions were highly urbanized in comparison to most of the rest of Europe. In Greater Poland and Lesser Poland at the end of the 16th century, for example, 30% of the population lived in cities. 256 towns were founded, most in Red Ruthenia. The townspeople's upper layer was ethnically multinational and tended to be well-educated. Numerous sons of burghers studied at the Academy of Krak√≥w and at foreign universities; members of their group are among the finest contributors to the culture of the Polish Renaissance. Unable to form their own nationwide political class, many blended into the nobility in spite of the legal obstacles. The nobility (or szlachta) in Poland constituted a greater proportion of the population than in other countries, up to 10%. In principle, they were all equal and politically empowered, but some had no property and were not allowed to hold offices or participate in sejms or sejmiks, the legislative bodies. Of the \\"landed\\" nobility, some possessed a small patch of land that they tended themselves and lived like peasant families, while the magnates owned dukedom-like networks of estates with several hundred towns and villages and many thousands of subjects. Mixed marriages gave some peasants one of the few possible paths to nobility. 16th-century Poland was officially a \\"republic of nobles\\", and the \\"middle class\\" of the nobility (individuals at a lower social level than \\"magnates\\") formed the leading component during the later Jagiellonian period and afterwards. Nonetheless, members of the magnate families held the highest state and church offices. At that time, the szlachta in Poland and Lithuania was ethnically diversified and represented several religious denominations. During this period of tolerance, such factors had little bearing on one's economic status or career potential. Jealous of their class privilege (\\"freedoms\\"), the Renaissance szlachta developed a sense of public service duties, educated their youth, took keen interest in current trends and affairs and traveled widely. While the Golden Age of Polish Culture adopted western humanism and Renaissance patterns, the lifestyles of Polish nobles acquired a distinctly eastern flavor beginning in the second half of the 16th century. Visiting foreigners often remarked on the splendor of their residencies and the conspicuous consumption of wealthy Polish nobles. = Reformation = Sigismund I the Old In a situation analogous with that of other European countries, the progressive internal decay of the Polish Church created conditions favorable for the dissemination of the Reformation ideas and currents. For example, there was a chasm between the lower clergy and the nobility-based Church hierarchy, which was quite laicized and preoccupied with temporal issues, such as power and wealth, and often corrupt. The middle nobility, which had already been exposed to the Hussite reformist persuasion, increasingly looked at the Church's many privileges with envy and hostility. The teachings of Martin Luther were accepted most readily in the regions with strong German connections: Silesia, Greater Poland, Pomerania and Prussia. In Danzig (Gda≈Ñsk) in 1525 a lower-class Lutheran social uprising took place and was bloodily subdued by Sigismund I; after the reckoning he established a representation for the plebeian interests as a segment of the city government. K√∂nigsberg and the Duchy of Prussia under Albrecht Hohenzollern became a strong center of Protestant propaganda dissemination affecting all of northern Poland and Lithuania. Sigismund quickly reacted against the \\"religious novelties\\", issuing his first related edict in 1520, banning any promotion of the Lutheran ideology, or even foreign trips to the Lutheran centers. Such attempted (poorly enforced) prohibitions continued until 1543. Wawel Castle Renaissance courtyard Sigismund's son Sigismund II Augustus (Zygmunt II August), a monarch of a much more tolerant attitude, guaranteed the freedom of the Lutheran religion practice in all of Royal Prussia by 1559. Besides Lutheranism, which, within the Polish Crown, ultimately found substantial following mainly in the cities of Royal Prussia and western Greater Poland, the teachings of the persecuted Anabaptists and Unitarians, and in Greater Poland the Czech Brothers, were met, at least among the szlachta, with a more sporadic response. In Royal Prussia, 41% of the parishes were counted as Lutheran in the second half of the 16th century, but that percentage kept increasing. According to Kasper Cichocki, who wrote in the early 17th century, only remnants of Catholicism were left there in his time. Lutheranism was strongly dominant in Royal Prussia throughout the 17th century, with the exception of Warmia (Ermland). Danzig (Gda≈Ñsk) Town Hall Around 1570, of the at least 700 Protestant congregations in Poland-Lithuania, over 420 were Calvinist and over 140 Lutheran, with the latter including 30-40 ethnically Polish. Protestants encompassed approximately ¬Ω of the magnate class, ¬º of other nobility and townspeople, and 1/20 of the non-Orthodox peasantry. The bulk of the Polish-speaking population had remained Catholic, but the proportion of Catholics became significantly diminished within the upper social ranks. Calvinism gained many followers in the mid 16th century among both the szlachta and the magnates, especially in Lesser Poland and Lithuania. The Calvinists, who led by Jan ≈Åaski were working on unification of the Protestant churches, proposed the establishment of a Polish national church, under which all Christian denominations, including Eastern Orthodox (very numerous in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and Ukraine), would be united. After 1555 Sigismund II, who accepted their ideas, sent an envoy to the pope, but the papacy rejected the various Calvinist postulates. ≈Åaski and several other Calvinist scholars published in 1563 the Bible of Brest, a complete Polish Bible translation from the original languages, an undertaking financed by Miko≈Çaj Radziwi≈Ç≈Ç the Black.Various authors, ed. Marek Derwich and Adam ≈ªurek, Monarchia Jagiellon√≥w, 1399‚Äì1586 (The Jagiellonian Monarchy: 1399‚Äì1586), p. 131-132, Urszula Augustyniak. Wydawnictwo Dolno≈õlƒÖskie, Wroc≈Çaw 2003, . After 1563‚Äì1565 (the abolishment of state enforcement of the Church jurisdiction), full religious tolerance became the norm. The Polish Catholic Church emerged from this critical period weakened but not badly damaged (the bulk of the Church property was preserved), which facilitated the later success of Counter-Reformation. Pozna≈Ñ City Hall Among the Calvinists, who also included the lower classes and their leaders, ministers of common background, disagreements soon developed, based on different views in the areas of religious and social doctrines. The official split took place in 1562, when two separate churches were officially established: the mainstream Calvinist and the smaller, more reformist, Polish Brethren or Arians. The adherents of the radical wing of the Polish Brethren promoted, often by way of personal example, the ideas of social justice. Many Arians (such as Piotr of GoniƒÖdz and Jan Niemojewski) were pacifists opposed to private property, serfdom, state authority and military service; through communal living some had implemented the ideas of shared usage of the land and other property. A major Polish Brethren congregation and center of activities was established in 1569 in Rak√≥w near Kielce, and lasted until 1638, when Counter-Reformation had it closed.A Concise History of Poland, by Jerzy Lukowski and Hubert Zawadzki, p. 104 The notable Sandomierz Agreement of 1570, an act of compromise and cooperation among several Polish Protestant denominations, excluded the Arians, whose more moderate, larger faction toward the end of the century gained the upper hand within the movement. The act of the Warsaw Confederation, which took place during the convocation sejm of 1573, provided guarantees, at least for the nobility, of religious freedom and peace. It gave the Protestant denominations, including the Polish Brethren, formal rights for many decades to come. Uniquely in 16th-century Europe, it turned the Commonwealth, in the words of Cardinal Stanislaus Hosius, a Catholic reformer, into a \\"safe haven for heretics\\". = Culture of Polish Renaissance =  Golden Age of Polish culture  Nicolaus Copernicus The Polish \\"Golden Age\\", the period of the reigns of Sigismund I and Sigismund II, the last two Jagiellonian kings, or more generally the 16th century, is most often identified with the rise of the culture of Polish Renaissance. The cultural flowering had its material base in the prosperity of the elites, both the landed nobility and urban patriciate at such centers as Cracow and Danzig. As was the case with other European nations, the Renaissance inspiration came in the first place from Italy, a process accelerated to some degree by Sigismund I's marriage to Bona Sforza. Many Poles traveled to Italy to study and to learn its culture. As imitating Italian ways became very trendy (the royal courts of the two kings provided the leadership and example for everybody else), many Italian artists and thinkers were coming to Poland, some settling and working there for many years. While the pioneering Polish humanists, greatly influenced by Erasmus of Rotterdam, accomplished the preliminary assimilation of the antiquity culture, the generation that followed was able to put greater emphasis on the development of native elements, and because of its social diversity, advanced the process of national integration.  Literacy, education and patronage of intellectual endeavors  Bona Sforza, the educated and powerful queen, contributed to educational patronage Beginning in 1473 in Cracow (Krak√≥w), the printing business kept growing. By the turn of the 16th/17th century there were about 20 printing houses within the Commonwealth, 8 in Cracow, the rest mostly in Danzig (Gda≈Ñsk), Thorn (Toru≈Ñ) and Zamo≈õƒá. The Academy of Krak√≥w and Sigismund II possessed well- stocked libraries; smaller collections were increasingly common at noble courts, schools and townspeople's households. Illiteracy levels were falling, as by the end of the 16th century almost every parish ran a school. The Lubra≈Ñski Academy, an institution of higher learning, was established in Pozna≈Ñ in 1519. The Reformation resulted in the establishment of a number of gymnasiums, academically oriented secondary schools, some of international renown, as the Protestant denominations wanted to attract supporters by offering high quality education. The Catholic reaction was the creation of Jesuit colleges of comparable quality. The Krak√≥w University in turn responded with humanist program gymnasiums of its own. The university itself experienced a period of prominence at the turn of the 15th/16th century, when especially the mathematics, astronomy and geography faculties attracted numerous students from abroad. Latin, Greek, Hebrew and their literatures were likewise popular. By the mid 16th century the institution entered a crisis stage, and by the early 17th century regressed into Counter-reformational conformism. The Jesuits took advantage of the infighting and established in 1579 a university college in Vilnius, but their efforts aimed at taking over the Academy of Krak√≥w were unsuccessful. Under the circumstances many elected to pursue their studies abroad. Zygmunt I Stary, who built the presently existing Wawel Renaissance castle, and his son Sigismund II Augustus, supported intellectual and artistic activities and surrounded themselves with the creative elite. Their patronage example was followed by ecclesiastic and lay feudal lords, and by patricians in major towns.  Science  Marcin Kromer The Counsellor by Goslicius in English Polish science reached its culmination in the first half of the 16th century, in which the medieval point of view was criticized and more rational explanations were formulated. Copernicus' De revolutionibus orbium coelestium, published in Nuremberg in 1543, shook up the traditional value system extended into an understanding of the physical universe, doing away with its Christianity-adopted Ptolemaic anthropocentric model and setting free the explosion of scientific inquiry. Generally the prominent scientists of the period resided in many different regions of the country, and increasingly, the majority were of urban, rather than noble origin. Nicolaus Copernicus, a son of a Toru≈Ñ trader from Krak√≥w, made many contributions to science and the arts. His scientific creativity was inspired at the University of Krak√≥w, at the institution's height; he also studied at Italian universities later. Copernicus wrote Latin poetry, developed an economic theory, functioned as a cleric-administrator, political activist in Prussian sejmiks, and led the defense of Olsztyn against the forces of Albrecht Hohenzollern. As an astronomer, he worked on his scientific theory for many years at Frombork, where he died. Josephus Struthius became famous as a physician and medical researcher. Bernard Wapowski was a pioneer of Polish cartography. Maciej Miechowita, a rector at the Cracow Academy, published in 1517 Tractatus de duabus Sarmatiis, a treatise on the geography of the East, an area in which Polish investigators provided first-hand expertise for the rest of Europe. Andrzej Frycz Modrzewski was one of the greatest theorists of political thought in Renaissance Europe. His most famous work, On the Improvement of the Commonwealth, was published in Krak√≥w in 1551. Modrzewski criticized the feudal societal relations and proposed broad realistic reforms. He postulated that all social classes should be subjected to the law to the same degree, and wanted to moderate the existing inequities. Modrzewski, an influential and often translated author, was a passionate proponent of the peaceful resolution of international conflicts. Bishop Wawrzyniec Go≈õlicki (Goslicius), who wrote and published in 1568 a study entitled De optimo senatore (The Counsellor in the 1598 English translation), was another popular and influential in the West political thinker.Stanis≈Çaw Grzybowski ‚Äì Dzieje Polski i Litwy (1506-1648) (History of Poland and Lithuania (1506-1648)), p. 206, Fogra, Krak√≥w 2000, Historian Marcin Kromer wrote De origine et rebus gestis Polonorum (On the origin and deeds of Poles) in 1555 and in 1577 Polonia, a treatise highly regarded in Europe. Marcin Bielski's Chronicle of the Whole World, a universal history, was written ca. 1550. The chronicle of Maciej Stryjkowski (1582) covered the history of Eastern Europe.  Literature  Miko≈Çaj Rej Modern Polish literature begins in the 16th century. At that time the Polish language, common to all educated groups, matured and penetrated all areas of public life, including municipal institutions, the legal code, the Church, and other official uses, coexisting for a while with Latin. Klemens Janicki, one of the Renaissance Latin language poets and a laureate of a papal distinction, was of peasant origin. Another plebeian author, Biernat of Lublin, wrote his own version of Aesop's fables in Polish, permeated with his socially radical views. A Literary Polish language breakthrough came under the influence of the Reformation with the writings of Miko≈Çaj Rej. In his Brief Discourse, a satire published in 1543, he defends a serf from a priest and a noble, but in his later works he often celebrates the joys of the peaceful but privileged life of a country gentleman. Rej, whose legacy is his unbashful promotion of the Polish language, left a great variety of literary pieces. ≈Åukasz G√≥rnicki, an author and translator, perfected the Polish prose of the period. His contemporary and friend Jan Kochanowski became one of the greatest Polish poets of all time. The Dismissal of the Greek Envoys by Jan Kochanowski (1578) Kochanowski was born in 1530 into a prosperous noble family. In his youth he studied at the universities of Krak√≥w, K√∂nigsberg and Padua and traveled extensively in Europe. He worked for a time as a royal secretary, and then settled in the village of Czarnolas, a part of his family inheritance. Kochanowski's multifaceted creative output is remarkable for both the depth of thoughts and feelings that he shares with the reader, and for its beauty and classic perfection of form. Among Kochanowski's best known works are bucolic Frascas (trifles), epic poetry, religious lyrics, drama-tragedy The Dismissal of the Greek Envoys, and the most highly regarded Threnodies or laments, written after the death of his young daughter. The poet Miko≈Çaj Sƒôp Szarzy≈Ñski, an intellectually refined master of small forms, bridges the late Renaissance and early Baroque artistic periods.  Music  Following the European and Italian in particular musical trends, the Renaissance music was developing in Poland, centered around the royal court patronage and branching from there. Sigismund I kept from 1543 a permanent choir at the Wawel castle, while the Reformation brought large scale group Polish language church singing during the services. Jan of Lublin wrote a comprehensive tablature for the organ and other keyboard instruments.Anita J. Pra≈ºmowska ‚Äì A History of Poland, 2004 Palgrave Macmillan, , p. 84 Among the composers, who often permeated their music with national and folk elements, were Wac≈Çaw of Szamotu≈Çy, Miko≈Çaj Gom√≥≈Çka, who wrote music to Kochanowski translated psalms, and Miko≈Çaj Ziele≈Ñski, who enriched the Polish music by adopting the Venetian School polyphonic style.  Architecture, sculpture and painting  Sigismund's Chapel of Wawel Cathedral Architecture, sculpture and painting developed also under Italian influence from the beginning of the 16th century. A number of professionals from Tuscany arrived and worked as royal artists in Krak√≥w. Francesco Fiorentino worked on the tomb of Jan Olbracht already from 1502, and then together with Bartolommeo Berrecci and Benedykt from Sandomierz rebuilt the royal castle, which was accomplished between 1507 and 1536. Berrecci also built Sigismund's Chapel at Wawel Cathedral. Polish magnates, Silesian Piast princes in Brzeg, and even Krak√≥w merchants (by the mid 16th century their class economically gained strength nationwide) built or rebuilt their residencies to make them resemble the Wawel Castle. Krak√≥w's Sukiennice and Pozna≈Ñ City Hall are among numerous buildings rebuilt in the Renaissance manner, but Gothic construction continued alongside for a number of decades. Between 1580 and 1600 Jan Zamoyski commissioned the Venetian architect Bernardo Morando to build the city of Zamo≈õƒá. The town and its fortifications were designed to consistently implement the Renaissance and Mannerism aesthetic paradigms. Tombstone sculpture, often inside churches, is richly represented on graves of clergy and lay dignitaries and other wealthy individuals. Jan Maria Padovano and Jan Micha≈Çowicz of Urzƒôd√≥w count among the prominent artists. Painted illuminations in Balthasar Behem Codex are of exceptional quality, but draw their inspiration largely from Gothic art. Stanis≈Çaw Samostrzelnik, a monk in the Cistercian monastery in Mogi≈Ça near Krak√≥w, painted miniatures and polychromed wall frescos. = Republic of middle nobility; execution movement = Sigismund II Augustus, the last Jagiellonian king; his actions facilitated the Union of Lublin The Polish political system in the 16th century was contested terrain as the middle gentry (szlachta) sought power. Kings Sigismund I the Old and Sigismund II Augustus manipulated political institutions to block the gentry. The kings used their appointment power and influence on the elections to the Sejm. They issued propaganda upholding the royal position and provided financing to favoured leaders of the gentry. Seldom did the kings resort to repression or violence. Compromises were reached so that in the second half of the 16th century‚Äîfor the only time in Polish history‚Äîthe \\"democracy of the gentry\\" was implemented.Waclaw Uruszczak, \\"The Implementation of Domestic Policy in Poland under the Last Two Jagellonian Kings, 1506-1572.\\" Parliaments, Estates & Representation (1987) 7#2 pp 133-144. , not online During the reign of Sigismund I, szlachta in the lower chamber of general sejm (from 1493 a bicameral legislative body), initially decidedly outnumbered by their more privileged colleagues from the senate (which is what the appointed for life prelates and barons of the royal council were being called now),A Concise History of Poland, by Jerzy Lukowski and Hubert Zawadzki, p. 61 acquired a more numerous and fully elected representation. Sigismund however preferred to rule with the help of the magnates, pushing szlachta into the \\"opposition\\". After the Nihil novi act of 1505, a collection of laws known as ≈Åaski's Statutes was published in 1506 and distributed to Polish courts. The legal pronouncements, intended to facilitate the functioning of a uniform and centralized state, with ordinary szlachta privileges strongly protected, were frequently ignored by the kings, beginning with Sigismund I, and the upper nobility or church interests. This situation became the basis for the formation around 1520 of the szlachta's execution movement, for the complete codification and execution, or enforcement, of the laws. Wawel Hill, the castle and the cathedral In 1518 Sigismund I married Bona Sforza d'Aragona, a young, strong-minded Italian princess. Bona's sway over the king and the magnates, her efforts to strengthen the monarch's political position, financial situation, and especially the measures she took to advance her personal and dynastic interests, including the forced royal election of the minor Sigismund Augustus in 1529 and his premature coronation in 1530, increased the discontent among szlachta activists. The opposition middle szlachta movement came up with a constructive reform program during the Krak√≥w sejm of 1538/1539. Among the movement's demands were termination of the kings' practice of alienation of royal domain, giving or selling land estates to great lords at the monarch' discretion, and a ban on concurrent holding of multiple state offices by the same person, both legislated initially in 1504. Sigismund I's unwillingness to move toward the implementation of the reformers' goals negatively affected the country's financial and defensive capabilities. The relationship with szlachta had only gotten worse during the early years of the reign of Sigismund II Augustus and remained bad until 1562. Sigismund Augustus' secret marriage with Barbara Radziwi≈Ç≈Ç in 1547, before his accession to the throne, was strongly opposed by his mother Bona and by the magnates of the Crown. Sigismund, who took over the reign after his father's death in 1548, overcame the resistance and had Barbara crowned in 1550; a few months later the new queen died. Bona, estranged from her son returned to Italy in 1556, where she died soon afterwards. Jagiellon family portraits by Lucas Cranach the Younger The Sejm, until 1573 summoned by the king at his discretion (for example when he needed funds to wage a war), composed of the two chambers presided over by the monarch, became in the course of the 16th century the main organ of the state power. The reform-minded execution movement had its chance to take on the magnates and the church hierarchy (and take steps to restrain their abuse of power and wealth) when Sigismund Augustus switched sides and lent them his support at the sejm of 1562. During this and several more sessions of parliament, within the next decade or so, the Reformation inspired szlachta was able to push through a variety of reforms, which resulted in a fiscally more sound, better governed, more centralized and territorially unified Polish state. Some of the changes were too modest, other had never become completely implemented (e. g. recovery of the usurped Crown land), but nevertheless for the time being the middle szlachta movement was victorious. Miko≈Çaj Sienicki, a Protestant activist, was a parliamentary leader of the execution movement and one of the organizers of the Warsaw Confederation. = Resources and strategic objectives = Royal Prussia shown in light pink, Ducal Prussia striped Despite the favorable economic development, the military potential of 16th century Poland was modest in relation to the challenges and threats coming from several directions, which included the Ottoman Empire, the Teutonic state, the Habsburgs, and Muscovy. Given the declining military value and willingness of pospolite ruszenie, the bulk of the forces available consisted of professional and mercenary soldiers. Their number and provision depended on szlachta-approved funding (self-imposed taxation and other sources) and tended to be insufficient for any combination of adversaries. The quality of the forces and their command was good, as demonstrated by victories against a seemingly overwhelming enemy. The attainment of strategic objectives was supported by a well-developed service of knowledgeable diplomats and emissaries. Because of the limited resources at the state's disposal, the Jagiellonian Poland had to concentrate on the area most crucial for its security and economic interests, which was the strengthening of Poland's position along the Baltic coast. = Prussia; struggle for Baltic area domination = Danzig (Gda≈Ñsk) around the turn of the 19th and 20th centuries; the medieval port crane on the right The Peace of Thorn of 1466 reduced the Teutonic Knights, but brought no lasting solution to the problem they presented for Poland and their state avoided paying the prescribed tribute.A Concise History of Poland, by Jerzy Lukowski and Hubert Zawadzki, p. 48, 50 The chronically difficult relations had gotten worse after the 1511 election of Albrecht as Grand Master of the Order. Faced with Albrecht's rearmament and hostile alliances, Poland waged a war in 1519; the war ended in 1521, when mediation by Charles V resulted in a truce. As a compromise move Albrecht, persuaded by Martin Luther, initiated a process of secularization of the Order and the establishment of a lay duchy of Prussia, as Poland's dependency, ruled by Albrecht and afterwards by his descendants. The terms of the proposed pact immediately improved Poland's Baltic region situation, and at that time also appeared to protect the country's long-term interests. The treaty was concluded in 1525 in Krak√≥w; the remaining state of the Teutonic Knights (East Prussia centered on K√∂nigsberg) was converted into the Protestant (Lutheran) Duchy of Prussia under the King of Poland and the homage act of the new Prussian duke in Krak√≥w followed. Albert, Duke of Prussia, by Lucas Cranach the Elder In reality the House of Hohenzollern, of which Albrecht was a member, the ruling family of the Margraviate of Brandenburg, had been actively expanding its territorial influence; for example already in the 16th century in Farther Pomerania and Silesia. Motivated by a current political expediency, Sigismund Augustus in 1563 allowed the Brandenburg elector branch of the Hohenzollerns, excluded under the 1525 agreement, to inherit the Prussian fief rule. The decision, confirmed by the 1569 sejm, made the future union of Prussia with Brandenburg possible. Sigismind II, unlike his successors, was however careful to assert his supremacy. The Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth, ruled after 1572 by elective kings, was even less able to counteract the growing importance of the dynastically active Hohenzollerns. In 1568 Sigismund Augustus, who had already embarked on a war fleet enlargement program, established the Maritime Commission. A conflict with the City of Gda≈Ñsk (Danzig), which felt that its monopolistic trade position was threatened, ensued. In 1569 Royal Prussia had its legal autonomy largely taken away, and in 1570 Poland's supremacy over Danzig and the Polish King's authority over the Baltic shipping trade were regulated and received statutory recognition (Karnkowski's Statutes). = Wars with Moscow = Battle of Orsha 1514 In the 16th century the Grand Duchy of Moscow continued activities aimed at unifying the old Rus' lands still under Lithuanian rule. The Grand Duchy of Lithuania had insufficient resources to counter Moscow's advances, already having to control the Rus' population within its borders and not being able to count on loyalty of Rus' feudal lords. As a result of the protracted war at the turn of the 15th and 16th centuries, Moscow acquired large tracts of territory east of the Dnieper River. Polish assistance and involvement were increasingly becoming a necessary component of the balance of power in the eastern reaches of the Lithuanian domain. Under Vasili III Moscow fought a war with Lithuania and Poland between 1512 and 1522, during which in 1514 the Russians took Smolensk. That same year the Polish-Lithuanian rescue expedition fought the victorious Battle of Orsha under Hetman Konstanty Ostrogski and stopped the Duchy of Moscow's further advances. An armistice implemented in 1522 left Smolensk land and Severia in Russian hands. Another round of fighting took place during 1534‚Äì1537, when the Polish aid led by Hetman Jan Tarnowski made possible the taking of Gomel and fiercely defeated Starodub. New truce (Lithuania kept only Gomel), stabilization of the border and over two decades of peace followed. = The Jagiellons and the Habsburgs; Ottoman Empire expansion = Marcin Bielski's chronicle: Hetman Jan Tarnowski during the siege of Starodub (1535), where Tarnowski ordered the execution of 1400 Muscovite defenders-prisoners In 1515, during a congress in Vienna, a dynastic succession arrangement was agreed to between Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor and the Jagiellon brothers, Vladislas II of Bohemia and Hungary and Sigismund I of Poland and Lithuania. It was supposed to end the Emperor's support for Poland's enemies, the Teutonic and Russian states, but after the election of Charles V, Maximilian's successor in 1519, the relations with Sigismund had worsened. The Jagiellon rivalry with the House of Habsburg in central Europe was ultimately resolved to the Habsburgs' advantage. The decisive factor that damaged or weakened the monarchies of the last Jagiellons was the Ottoman Empire's Turkish expansion. Hungary's vulnerability greatly increased after Suleiman the Magnificent took the Belgrade fortress in 1521. To prevent Poland from extending military aid to Hungary, Suleiman had a Tatar-Turkish force raid southeastern Poland‚ÄìLithuania in 1524. The Hungarian army was defeated in 1526 at the Battle of Moh√°cs, where the young Louis II Jagiellon, son of Vladislas II, was killed. Subsequently, after a period of internal strife and external intervention, Hungary was partitioned between the Habsburgs and the Ottomans. The 1526 death of Janusz III of Masovia, the last of the Masovian Piast dukes line (a remnant of the fragmentation period divisions), enabled Sigismund I to finalize the incorporation of Masovia into the Polish Crown in 1529. From the early 16th century the Pokuttya border region was contested by Poland and Moldavia (see Battle of Obertyn). A peace with Moldavia took effect in 1538 and Pokuttya remained Polish. An \\"eternal peace\\" with the Ottoman Empire was negotiated by Poland in 1533 to secure frontier areas. Moldavia had fallen under Turkish domination, but Polish-Lithuanian magnates remained actively involved there. Sigismund II Augustus even claimed \\"jurisdiction\\" and in 1569 accepted a formal, short-lived suzerainty over Moldavia. = Livonia; struggle for Baltic area domination = Poland and Lithuania in 1526 In the 16th century the Grand Duchy of Lithuania became increasingly interested in extending its territorial rule to Livonia, especially to gain control of Baltic seaports, such as Riga, and for other economic benefits. Livonia was by the 1550s largely Lutheran,A Concise History of Poland, by Jerzy Lukowski and Hubert Zawadzki, p. 58 traditionally ruled by the Brothers of the Sword knightly order. This put Poland and Lithuania on a collision course with Moscow and other regional powers, which had also attempted expansion in that area. Soon after the Treaty of Krak√≥w of 1525, Albrecht (Albert) of Hohenzollern planned a Polish‚ÄìLithuanian fief in Livonia, seeking a dominant position for his brother Wilhelm, the Archbishop of Riga. What happened instead was the establishment of a Livonian pro-Polish‚ÄìLithuanian party or faction. Internal fighting in Livonia took place when the Grand Master of the Brothers concluded a treaty with Moscow in 1554, declaring his state's neutrality regarding the Russian‚ÄìLithuanian conflict. Supported by Albrecht and the magnates, Sigismund II declared a war on the Order. Grand Master Wilhelm von F√ºrstenberg accepted the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian conditions without a fight, and according to the 1557 Treaty of Pozvol, a military alliance obliged the Livonian state to support Lithuania against Moscow. Livonia in 1534, before the Livonian War Other powers aspiring to the Livonian Baltic access responded by partitioning the Livonian state, which triggered the lengthy Livonian War, fought between 1558 and 1583. Ivan IV of Russia took Dorpat (Tartu) and Narva in 1558, and soon the Danes and Swedes had occupied other parts of the country. To protect the integrity of their country, the Livonians now sought a union with the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian state. Gotthard Kettler, the new Grand Master, met in Vilnius (Vilna, Wilno) with Sigismund Augustus in 1561 and declared Livonia a vassal state under the Polish king. The Union of Vilnius called for secularization of the Brothers of the Sword Order and incorporation of the newly established Duchy of Livonia into the Rzeczpospolita (\\"Republic\\") as an autonomous entity. The Duchy of Courland and Semigallia was also created as a separate fief, to be ruled by Kettler. Sigismund II obliged himself to recover the parts of Livonia lost to Moscow and the Baltic powers, which had led to grueling wars with Russia (1558‚Äì1570 and 1577‚Äì1582) and heavy struggles also concerning the fundamental issues of control of the Baltic trade and freedom of navigation. The Baltic region policies of the last Jagiellon king and his advisors were the most mature of 16th-century Poland's strategic programs. The outcome of the efforts in that area was to a considerable extent successful for the Commonwealth. The wars concluded during the reign of King Stephen B√°thory. = Poland and Lithuania in real union under Sigismund II = The burials of Sigismund I and Sigismund II inside Sigismund's Chapel Sigismund II's childlessness added urgency to the idea of turning the personal union between Poland and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania into a more permanent and tighter relationship; it was also a priority for the execution movement. Lithuania's laws were codified and reforms enacted in 1529, 1557, 1565‚Äì1566 and 1588, gradually making its social, legal and economic system similar to that of Poland, with the expanding role of the middle and lower nobility. Fighting wars with Moscow under Ivan IV and the threat perceived from that direction provided additional motivation for the real union for both Poland and Lithuania. The process of negotiating the actual arrangements turned out to be difficult and lasted from 1563 to 1569, with the Lithuanian magnates, worried about losing their dominant position, being at times uncooperative. It took Sigismunt II's unilateral declaration of the incorporation into the Polish Crown of substantial disputed border regions, including most of Lithuanian Ukraine, to make the Lithuanian magnates rejoin the process, and participate in the swearing of the act of the Union of Lublin on July 1, 1569. Lithuania for the near future was becoming more secure on the eastern front. It's increasingly Polonized nobility made in the coming centuries great contributions to the Commonwealth's culture, but at the cost of Lithuanian national development. The Lithuanian language survived as a peasant vernacular and also as a written language in religious use, from the publication of the Lithuanian Catechism by Martynas Ma≈ævydas in 1547. The Ruthenian language was and remained in the Grand Duchy's official use even after the Union, until the takeover of Polish. = The Commonwealth: multicultural, magnate dominated = Conception of the Polish Crown of Stanis≈Çaw Orzechowski, a szlachta ideologist. In 1564 Orzechowski wrote Quincunx, in which he expounded principles of a state identified with its nobility. By the Union of Lublin a unified Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth (Rzeczpospolita) was created, stretching from the Baltic Sea and the Carpathian mountains to present-day Belarus and western and central Ukraine (which earlier had been Kievan Rus' principalities). Within the new federation some degree of formal separateness of Poland and Lithuania was retained (distinct state offices, armies, treasuries and judicial systems), but the union became a multinational entity with a common monarch, parliament, monetary system and foreign-military policy, in which only the nobility enjoyed full citizenship rights. Moreover, the nobility's uppermost stratum was about to assume the dominant role in the Commonwealth, as magnate factions were acquiring the ability to manipulate and control the rest of szlachta to their clique's private advantage. This trend, facilitated further by the liberal settlement and land acquisition consequences of the union,A Concise History of Poland, by Jerzy Lukowski and Hubert Zawadzki, p. 81 was becoming apparent at the time of, or soon after the 1572 death of Sigismund Augustus, the last monarch of the Jagiellonian dynasty. One of the most salient characteristics of the newly established Commonwealth was its multiethnicity, and accordingly diversity of religious faiths and denominations. Among the peoples represented were Poles (about 50% or less of the total population), Lithuanians, Latvians, Rus' people (corresponding to today's Belarusians, Ukrainians, Russians or their East Slavic ancestors), Germans, Estonians, Jews, Armenians, Tatars and Czechs, among others, for example smaller West European groups. As for the main social segments in the early 17th century, nearly 70% of the Commonwealth's population were peasants, over 20% residents of towns, and less than 10% nobles and clergy combined. The total population, estimated at 8‚Äì10 million, kept growing dynamically until the middle of the century. The Slavic populations of the eastern lands, Rus' or Ruthenia, were solidly, except for the Polish colonizing nobility (and Polonized elements of local nobility), Eastern Orthodox, which portended future trouble for the Commonwealth.Various authors, ed.

As scapegoats were sought, the increased Jewish persecution led to pogroms and mass killings in a number of German cities, which caused an exodus of survivors heading east. Much of Poland was spared from the Black Death, and Jewish immigration brought their valuable contributions and abilities to the rising state. The number of Jews in Poland kept increasing throughout the Middle Ages; the population had reached about 30,000 toward the end of the 15th century,Krzysztof Baczkowski ‚Äì Dzieje Polski p√≥≈∫no≈õredniowiecznej (1370‚Äì1506) (History of Late Medieval Poland (1370‚Äì1506)), p. 274‚Äì276 and, as refugees escaping further persecution elsewhere kept streaming in, 150,000 in the 16th century. A royal privilege issued in 1532 granted the Jews freedom to trade anywhere within the kingdom. Massacres and expulsions from many German states continued until 1552‚Äì1553.Richard Overy (2010), The Times Complete History of the World, Eights Edition, p. 116‚Äì117. London: Times Books. . By the mid-16th century, 80% of the world's Jews lived and flourished in Poland and in Lithuania; most of western and central Europe was by that time closed to Jews. In Poland‚ÄìLithuania the Jews were increasingly finding employment as managers and intermediaries, facilitating the functioning of and collecting revenue in huge magnate-owned land estates, especially in the eastern borderlands, developing into an indispensable mercantile and administrative class.A Traveller's History of Poland, by John Radzilowski, p. 100, 113 Despite the partial resettlement of Jews in Western Europe following the Thirty Years' War (1618‚Äì1648), a great majority of world Jewry had lived in Eastern Europe (in the Commonwealth and in the regions further east and south, where many migrated), until the 1940s.

Despite the restrictions the nobility imposed on the monarchs, the Polish kings had never become figureheads. In practice they wielded considerable executive power, up to and including the last king, Stanis≈Çaw August Poniatowski. Some were at times even accused of absolutist tendencies, and it may be for the lack of sufficiently strong personalities or favorable circumstances that none of the kings had succeeded in significant and lasting strengthening of the monarchy. b. 13 in Greater Poland, 59 in Lesser Poland, 32 in Mazovia, and 153 in Red Ruthenia.A.

At the heart of it lies a quadruple jump done in combination with a triple toe loop, which Evgeni Plushenko of Russia landed in both his short and long programs. Evan Lysacek of the United States, however, did not include quads in either of his programs. Plushenko, who led Lysacek by half a point after the short figure skating program, was beaten out by the American in the final free skate despite performing a quadruple toe loop/triple toe loop. Lysacek's free skate was regarded as having lower difficulty but better quality than Plushenko's. Many experts of the field have offered their opinions about the results, and many members of the general public have weighed in on the controversy through online message boards, forums and social networking sites. Background Though the argument over the quad has attracted attention mostly following the men's figure skating competition at the Vancouver Olympic Games of 2010, the controversy itself is rooted in the quad's history, and its role at major figure skating competitions, including the Winter Olympics. The jump had become so common in men's figure skating since Kurt Browning first landed it in 1988 that it came to be viewed as a deciding element in a winning program and the lack of it almost a handicap. Since the 1994 Olympics in Lillehammer, Norway, where Alexei Urmanov won gold without one, the quad, if landed in a competition (absent major weaknesses), made a difference between the first and lower placements. In a Sports Illustrated article dated January 19, 1998, E.M. Swift wrote that \\"no Olympic gold medal will ever again be won by a man who doesn't try a four-revolution jump.\\" Many, therefore, tried to make themselves competitive by including it in their skating arsenal. In the twelve years leading up to the 2010 Olympics, only two skaters won the World Figure Skating Championships without a quadruple jump. Both wins were under the new ISU judging system. Jeffrey Buttle's win at the 2008 Worlds officially disproved the already long-standing notion that a quad was needed to win the big titles. His win is credited to have been the spark that ignited the quad controversy that came to a head at the Vancouver Olympic Games. Brian Joubert, the first European skater to land three quads in a program, expressed his strong disappointment over the results and stated that the value of the jump should be raised in the current scoring system. Evan Lysacek, like Joubert, commented that a quad was an essential part of men's skating. In 2009, Lysacek became the second consecutive figure skater to win the world championship without a quadruple jump. With Evgeni Plushenko and St√©phane Lambiel entering the race for gold at the upcoming Olympics, the quad debate intensified. \\"They saw there was two times the world champion (won) without a quad. From Todd Eldredge ages there was nobody without the quad to win the world,\\" said Czech skater Michal B≈ôezina. \\"I think they did it just because of this. They want to show, if you want to be world champion of the ages you really have to do the quad. I don't think there is any other reason.\\" Plushenko thought it was an embarrassment and not in keeping with the established practice, that the last two world champions had won without even attempting a quadruple jump. He challenged his competition to try and win the gold in Vancouver without it. \\"Whoever skates clean with a quad will win it. I don't think many will\\" said Lysacek of the Olympics in January, 2010. Shortly after, however, citing a problem with his left foot stemming from a stress fracture, Lysacek said that he would not attempt a quad. When asked if he thought it would cost him gold, he replied that the new judging system made a win possible without one: \\"This season has been very telling, so if you go back and look at how the international competitions have been scored, my strategy has just changed a little.\\" \\"I don't think anyone is unbeatable right now, because of the way the sport is judged. Obviously there's a lot of room for error, but there's also a lot of room to gain extra points on what you are doing.\\" 2010 Winter Olympics =Free Skate= Lysacek finished with a career-best 257.67, 1.31 points ahead of Plushenko, becoming the first man since 1994 to win the Olympic title without doing a quadruple jump. Tied with Plushenko artistically (both scored 82.80 for program components), the win for Lysacek became possible due to higher marks he received on the execution of such technical elements as jumps, spins and footwork. Commenting on Lysacek receiving higher technical marks than Plushenko, Frank Carroll, Lysacek's coach, said: \\"Plushenko was brilliant in the jumping. He did some brilliant, very difficult things. But if you think of his skating, he was very brilliant, then down. And very brilliant, then down. It was going in waves. Evan just sort of stayed in a straight line and kept going at a certain level from the start to the finish.\\" Lysacek agreed with Carroll's assessment as to why he was able to prevail over the three- time Olympic medalist, whose technical prowess had always been his trademark: \\"If it was a jumping competition, they'd give you 10 seconds to go do your best jump. But it's about 4 minutes and 40 seconds of skating and performing from start to finish. That was my challenge tonight, and I feel like I did quite well.\\" Others regarded Lysacek's free skate as a well-rounded routine performed with better quality than that of his rival. \\"Plushenko may have done the quad, but the overall quality of Lysacek's program was better\\" said Jacques Rogge, the president of the IOC. Multiple Olympic pairs skating champion Irina Rodnina said of Plushenko's free skate: \\"Evgeni had one big advantage ‚Äì the quadruple jump ‚Äì but at the same time, in the performance of our champion, there were enough small errors that weren't noticeable to all. Lysacek, meanwhile, had a winning appearance, a balanced program, all elements carefully woven into his program, logically. And Evgeni, it was especially obvious in the second half, was skating from jump to jump.\\" The way the competitors' long programs were structured as well as the marks for spins and step sequences were also mentioned as factors that ultimately tipped the scales in Lysacek's favor. Under the new ISU judging system all jumping passes in the last half of the free skate are worth an extra 10% in base value. In contrast to Lysacek's five jumps, Plushenko placed only three out of his eight jumping passes in the second half of his program. The strategic placement of Lysacek's jumps erased Plushenko's quadruple toe loop/triple toe loop advantage. As a consequence, Plushenko outscored Lysacek in the jumps by only 0.3 points. In that Plushenko's lead from the short program was marginal ‚Äì only 0.55 points ‚Äì the scoring for the spins and step sequences was what sealed Lysacek's win. The spins ended up eating up Plushenko's 0.85 advantage, since all three of Lysacek's spin sequences were awarded the highest level of difficulty ‚Äì level 4, and only two of Plushenko's were given that rating. This led to Lysacek outscoring Plushenko by 1.26 points in the spins. Additionally, Plushenko's step sequences were graded 0.9 points lower than Lysacek's, resulting in Lysacek's 1.31 overall margin of victory. Lysacek's marginal victory in the free skate, however, unleashed a wave of criticism that a routine more difficult and Olympic in nature had lost out to the one seen as out of the eighties and \\"below the modern standards\\" of men's figure skating. =Short Program= Plushenko's short program drew much praise from the International press which hailed him as the \\"King\\" of figure skating who had returned. It was the score for his short program that most Russian analysts say ultimately deprived him of the highest medal. Going into the free skate, less than a point separated Plushenko, Lysacek and Daisuke Takahashi of Japan. Plushenko was the only one of the three to land a quad in combination with a triple toe loop in the short program. \\"I did a great short program but didn't get the marks I deserved. When I asked why, they told me I was skating early and they had to retain top marks for the last group,\\" said Plushenko. The scant difference in the scores, a virtual tie, was slammed in the Russian media as dubious judging. \\"They 'buried' Zhenya (diminutive for Evgeni) before anything could be done. He should have won the short program with a 4 to 5 point lead, in my opinion. A short program is a technical one. And a 4+3 combination changes everything here because it shows that you're capable of doing more than others,\\" said famous Russian coach Tatiana Tarasova. Plushenko thought bias was clearly demonstrated in the scoring and expressed dismay at the Russian sports officials: \\"After the short program, three judges placed me 21st and 22nd for skating skills. These people came to the conclusion that I cannot skate at all. Given the situation, it's hard for me to understand where were our judges and the administration of our Skating Federation? Why couldn't a protest be filed following the short program? This [kind of judging] should have been prevented at once, because I don't believe my skating is of such a low level....I should have had at least a 5 point lead over my competitors. In the end however, the gap amounted to a mere 0.55 to which our Federation did not react at all.\\" The Russian Olympic Committee refused to provide legal support to Plushenko, who was going to protest the results on his own, citing the new ISU rules as barring such actions. \\"Under the new ISU rules a complaint may be lodged only if a calculation (mathematical) error occurs. If the judges err in interpreting an element or its level of difficulty, it is considered a \\"human error\\" which can not be challenged...No lawyer would take on representing Plushenko's interests as no provision for challenging the judging under these circumstances exists,\\" a source from the ROC was quoted as saying. Still, the head of Russia's Skating Federation, Valentin Piseev, came under heavy criticism at home for not standing up vigorously enough for Plushenko in the face of 'the judges' arbitrary scoring.' \\"Evgeni's silver medal is a colossal result. The result achieved by him, his coach, choreographer and his spouse. But if the Federation had stepped in, he would have taken home the gold,\\" said Irina Rodnina. Allegations of conspiracy =Joe Inman's email= In the days leading up to the Winter Olympics, a US skating judge, Joe Inman, had set off a controversy by sending an email to 60 judges and officials, in which he drew attention to Plushenko's words spoken at a news conference in Bratislava, Slovakia on January 27, 2010: > \\"If the judges want someone to place high, they can arrange it. Like in > Tallinn, Brian Joubert got more points for his transitions than me, although > we did exactly the same transitions on the ice. In fact, we don't have any > transitions because we focus on our jumps. So there are lobbies in the new > scoring system as well, and the judges can influence the result.\\" The email encouraged marking presentation scores more accurately by stating: \\"It is telling that Mr. Plushenko acknowledges having no transitions in his routine. The judges seem to miss what he is saying. We as judges should think about what we saw before putting that mark down.\\" Despite Joe Inman insisting that the emails were sent in innocence and meant to be a simple exchange among friends and teaching tools for people who had attended his seminars, the incident had touched off a frenzy in Europe and was seen as evidence of North America lobbying judges against Evgeni Plushenko and Brian Joubert. Joe Inman was not a judge at the Olympic Games in Vancouver. =Judging= \\"Let me say this very clearly: The IOC has discussed this with the International Skating Union, the judging has been absolutely impeccable, there is nothing to criticize the judges. They have applied the system that has been approved\\", Jacques Rogge said. However, many disagreed, some vehemently, calling the judging process no less scandalous than the judging controversy of the 2002 Winter Olympics and cited the athletes' scores as proof, in and of itself, of it being poor and biased. Alexei Mishin, Plushenko's coach, was furious at the judges and called their marks \\"nonsense,\\" \\"wrong\\" and \\"criminal.\\" Elvis Stojko called the judges' scoring ridiculous. Like Stojko, several believed that USA's Johnny Weir outskated Patrick Chan of Canada and should have been, if not on the podium, at least higher than sixth. Three-time Olympic medalist Artur Dmitriev thought the score for Lysacek seemed a bit too high, though not surprising, considering the same judges awarded Chan a 160.30 despite his several errors and even a fall on one of his jumps. Not only the score was higher than Weir's but it was only by 5.21 points lower than Plushenko's 165.51. \\"The ultimate score that Patrick Chan got did not in any way reflect his level of skating [at the Olympics]. It says a lot ‚Äì not only that the judges were biased. It also proves that the current judging system that replaced the old one to assure more objectivity does not work,\\" noted Dmitriev. Tatiana Tarasova, who helped to train Evan Lysacek in 2009, called the high evaluation of the components of his program in Vancouver \\"simply hooliganism,\\" adding that Plushenko's gold medal \\"was taken away from him.\\" \\"When a person performs a quadruple jump, which is contested by a triple, and (both contenders) gain the same points, it raises questions,\\" said Plushenko about the judges' marks. Reinhard E. Ketterer, the head coach of the Berlin Figure Skating Association, said: \\"We too are in shock. As of today, Plushenko is, without a doubt, the best figure skater in the world and quite justifiably so. He has a lot more difficult technical elements in his arsenal than others. The main thing is that he performed a quadruple toe loop ‚Äì and that's what is expected of a real champion. Figure skating is not a ballet but a sporting competition. It seems to me that the judges had already in advance given their preference to Lysacek. As a coach, I felt it right away.\\" Responding to opinions that a little strategizing, including a 4+3+2 combination, for example, or adding another jump to the program would have easily propelled him to victory, Plushenko said that nothing would have changed what had already been decided. \\"...All of it is pish posh. Well, judge for yourselves: for the quality of my skating, three judges placed me 21st and 22nd. Strangely, the computer did not drop any one of the three. But what it did instead was to drop those judges who awarded me first place. Under the current system, if this is the way judges' marks are awarded, you can win, and you can just as equally lose. Don't get me wrong. I don't want to criticize the new rules; they are not bad. But they do need further refinement.\\" Explaining the difference in the way Plushenko's program components were judged in the short program and the way they were judged in the free skate, Valentin Piseev commented: \\"After what happened in the short program, I immediately turned to Panov, the Russian member of the ISU, who in turn informed Cinquanta, the ISU's president. Cinquanta got in touch with the sports director, notified him of our Federation's statement and said that he himself would take the situation under his personal control. As a result, in Plushenko's free skate, his components were judged just as Lysacek's.\\" In scoring Plushenko's \\"transitions/linking footwork\\" component, the judges seem to have been influenced by the Joe Inman email. Elena Tchaikovskaia commented on what ultimately turned out to be one determining factor in the competition: \\"Everyone's talking about transitions, everyone's talking about step sequences but, honest to God, for the first time in my life I'm hearing that an Olympic champion is winning the Games because of transitions between the elements!\\" In the short program, the judges gave Plushenko 6.8 for transitions ‚Äî an all-time career low and a point lower than the scores he received for the four other components. Ten skaters were given higher marks than Plushenko for transitions in the long program. At two international competitions held prior to the Vancouver Olympics, however, Plushenko earned transition scores in the 7-7.5 range for the same programs he skated at the Olympics. Plushenko won the 2006 Olympics with a 7.82 mark for transitions in the short program and a 7.75 in the free skate, which were the highest marks given for transitions in the men's competition. According to Alexei Mishin, the low transition scores in Vancouver were the result of \\"the information war\\" against Plushenko. =Monetary interests= Explaining how Plushenko's technically superior short program was judged nearly equal to Lysacek's, Russian newspaper Express reported: \\"Not long before the Olympics, the International Skating Union (ISU) held talks with the U.S. television network ABC regarding a long-term contract. From reliable sources we learned that a condition had been placed on the ISU: the contract would be signed only if the U.S. got a gold in figure skating. The first place for the US in pairs and women's skating competitions was out of the question so the focus was on ice dancing and men's skating. Since Canadian ice dancers Tessa Virtue and Scott Moir were considered the strongest ice dance team, the decision was ultimately made to 'pull' Evan Lysacek up as the champion. 'Plushenko had no chances from the outset,' said a man familiar in the judging circles. 'Everything had been decided in advance. He was mercilessly robbed in the short program, and in the free skate, the referees just dynamically finished the matter off.' \\" Elena Vaytsekhovskaya with Mikhail Prokhorov Russian sports analyst and commentator Elena Vaytsekhovskaya in her article entitled \\"The Curtain\\" wrote: \\"Shortly before the Games, a rumor was leaked out from the top circles of the ISU that the International Skating Union was going to sign their next contract with American Television. The ISU already had such a contract before. But it was rather minuscule; five times smaller than the one rumored. From the first rumor there at once arose a second: allegedly because of this contract looming on the horizon the ISU would be exerting every effort to make sure that American and Canadian figure skaters receive the top placements possible at the Games.\\" She continues: \\"Even before the Games came to a close it became known that Lysacek wouldn't be a participant at the Worlds in March. The American right away was furtively accused of simply being afraid; as though the risk of losing, which would tarnish the glimmer of the highest Olympic title, was too great. In reality, all was a bit different. After Evan became the world champion a year ago, he was immediately offered a contract with the top American show \\"Stars on Ice.\\" He signed it...Lysacek as the top star had assumed additional duties of promoting the show in the USA.\\" Noting the connection between \\"Stars on Ice\\" and the Exhibition Gala, Vaytsekhovskaya says: \\"The order of performances at the Figure Skating Exhibition Gala had usually been simple: the first act is made up of the also-rans and the unfortunate ‚Äì those who did not make it to the podium, the second one features medalists and champions. In Vancouver, the order seemed odd: the silver medalists of the Games, Mao Asada and Evgeni Plushenko were wrapping up the first act. Lunacy, isn't it? However, nothing in this order was coincidental. The second half of the Gala happened to include precisely all those who Stars on Ice has had their eyes on, or those who have already settled in there [the show].\\" =Russia's reaction= In Russia, Plushenko's loss to Lysacek was seen by the majority of sports experts, analysts, commentators and the public as due to the judges' collusion and corruption. \\"If we pass it over in silence we will forever remain in the backyard. We need to put the question bluntly why there was such refereeing.... We need to get to the bottom of it,\\" said Sergei Mironov, the chairman of the Russian parliament's upper house. The image of Plushenko being a dull and inartistic one-trick pony was dismissed as shameless propaganda, inasmuch as prior to the 2010 Olympics he had received nothing but praise for his artistry. The image was believed to have been contrived in order to cast doubt on Plushenko's legendary status, thereby grooming the viewers to accept an unprecedented win by the American over the Russian known for his consistency to perform the toughest maneuver in figure skating. \\"When it comes to a quadruple jump- it is quite simple really. If no one except for the one Russian skater is able to perform it, you need to make believe that this jump does not exist at all.\\" TV commentators and experts saw Plushenko's \\"saving power\\" in managing to land a seemingly off-axis triple Axel as a testament to what real mastery is all about, as few would have been able to save it. \\"This is exactly what determines the great skill of a figure skater ‚Äì the ability to save a jump when needed, even in the most difficult situation. At the Olympics, mistakes are practically always bound to happen, and the one who is able to correct them wins it.\\" A sharp contrast to the way Plushenko was judged at the 2006 Turin Olympics was also pointed out. In Turin, he was regarded as a genius, who after Yagudin's exit had no equals left; in Vancouver, he was perceived as an unwelcome threat to be reduced to an average skater easily bested by any Tom, Dick and Harry. After his retirement \\"men's figure skating was quietly deteriorating. If you can't fly ‚Äì at least crawl prettily. Instead of the elements that a few rare individuals are able to conquer, the emphasis began to be placed on the better quality performance of what can be done by 500 men. A multitude of athletes, their coaches and sports officials had already made their plans for the upcoming Olympics. And then thunder struck ‚Äì Plushenko has returned!\\" \\"As soon as Plushenko announced his return, the ISU distributed an instruction video on the subject 'How Not to Skate!' And imagine, Plushenko starred in it!\\" said Alexei Mishin smiling...\\"I think the Americanadian camp whose representatives do not possess a quadruple jump didn't want Plushenko to become the Olympic champion and did all it could to prevent that.\\" Awarding silver to the strongest athlete who chose to skate a physically difficult program befitting an Olympic champion was seen by some as insulting. \\"The irony is that had Plushenko skated Lysacek's program he would have done it effortlessly and without breaking a sweat. Lysacek, on the other hand, wouldn't be able to handle Plushenko's program,\\" said Dmitriev. During the medal ceremony, Plushenko who felt that his free skate performance was strong enough for gold, stepped on the top level of the podium on his way to the runner-up level, considered by some to be unsportsmanlike. Plushenko's website afterwards proclaimed \\"Silver of Salt Lake\\", \\"Gold of Torino\\", and \\"Platinum of Vancouver\\", with the platinum medal claim being removed after ridicule by critics.Evgeni Plushenko's PLATINUM Medal: Skater's Web Site's Bizarre Claim (PHOTOS)Coach: Plushenko was 'robbed' of gold - Olympics - Yahoo! Sports Following the Olympic medal ceremony, Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin sent Plushenko a telegram, congratulating him on the wonderful Olympic performance and saying his silver was worth gold. On March 24, 2010 Siberian jewelers decided to award Plushenko a special medal weighing more than half a kilo of pure gold. Views on the future of figure skating The results of the men's figure skating competition have also revived the debate on figure skating's identity and the direction in which it is headed as a sport. It is perceived by many as the Athleticism vs Artistry debate and the two points argued are clearly demonstrated in the viewpoints of both medalists. Plushenko's participation at the 2010 Olympics was not only to defend his 2006 Olympic title, but also to show that the sport needs the quadruple jump if it wants to move with the times. > \\"Of course we need transitions and spins and steps, harder and harder. But I > don't know, I was making triples in 1994. I know in speedskating they have > timing [world records], it gets better. Biathlon, they have new timing. I > think we stopped,\\" said Plushenko. Lysacek, on the other hand, is of the opinion that skaters don't have to include the big jump as \\"imaginative spins, creative footwork and solid landings on non-quad jumps are enough to rack up the points under the ISU scoring system.\\" > \\"If it was a jumping competition, there'd be no music, they'd give you 10 > seconds to do your best jump and that would be it. But it's about the > performance, it's what makes us so unique and so emotional for an audience > to watch. I don't know why some people are so hung up on one particular > element. That's one step out of a four minute 40 second free skate. Each and > every step we take from the starting pose to the ending pose is accumulating > points,\\" said Lysacek. Lysacek's stance, however, is in sharp contrast to his own previously held view that the quad was important in winning and \\"reviving the flagging interest in U.S. figure skating.\\" > \\"I think we lost our big brand with the 6.0 [scoring system]. That was what > everyone knew, whether they had ever watched skating or not. It's tough to > rope people in when you don't have a brand -- and I think the brand now is > the quad. Even when people see me on the street, all they know is the quad. > So I think it's important for us to represent that.\\" Both Plushenko's and Lysacek's current points of view have only fueled the non-ending argument whether figure skating, men's in particular, should be viewed as an artistic or athletic competition. Some say that skating needs well-rounded competitors and the balance, i.e. the better combination of artistry and athleticism should determine the gold. Others, however, believe that it is fundamentally unfair to compare a technically superior program to a less physically demanding one, in terms of artistry, and that the subjective artistic components should be scored relative to the degree of difficulty of elements. Awarding a less challenging technical program the gold in Vancouver, they assert, is a step backwards in time rather than forward, and is contrary to the spirit of the Olympic Games' history and its motto. Elvis Stojko said Lysacek's long program was technically comparable to what Brian Boitano did in 1988 and that even junior skaters could skate the same program. The Olympics had always been viewed as the event where athletes came to push the boundaries of their sport, take risks and set new records. Now, according to Stojko, \\"...You don't have to risk it. You can play it safe and win gold. In what other sports do you have to hold back in order to win?\\" When asked why he had decided to include the quad in his short and long programs for the 2008 US Championships, Lysacek's own answer indicated that he was once in agreement with Stojko's reasoning: \\"I think it's important. It's good for me to keep challenging myself. I can't hold back on anything, and taking chances is what sports are about.\\" Plushenko's program was more ambitious and risky with the quadruple toe/ triple toe loop, while Lysacek did not even attempt the quad as a single jump \\"at the biggest moment on skating's biggest stage.\\" Sports journalist Kevin Blackistone wrote: \\"What has unfolded at the Vancouver Winter Games in figure skating would be the equivalent of not crediting Shaun White for his double McTwist in the half pipe and rewarding less ambitious snowboarders for getting the basics perfect.\\" \\"If you look at the Olympic motto 'faster, higher, stronger', the quad represents exactly that,\\" Alexei Mishin said. \\"Myopically focusing on transitional moves between jumps instead of on the difficulty and innovation of the jumps themselves is the equivalent of judging the 100-meter sprint on style instead of speed.\\" \\"Winning the Olympic gold medal without performing a quadruple jump is like going back to the dark ages of men's figure skating.\\" It has also been pointed out that it is the difficult technical elements ‚Äì jumps ‚Äì that have turned figure skating into a modern sport at the Olympics. In the early days of the Olympic Winter Games, skaters performed single jumps. By the middle of the 20th century, they had graduated to double jumps. By the 1980s, the triple Lutz was the benchmark for men. Throughout the '80s, it was the triple Axel, though attempts at a quad were already being made. Finally, a quadruple jump became an essential element in the programs of many men in the '90s and into the new millennium. The fact that fewer skaters than ever before attempt to land the toughest element in figure skating, opting to go for points instead, does not represent progress, critics claim. Quad in the ISU Code of Points system =ISU scoring system before changes= The controversial final outcome of the men's skate at the Olympics intensified the debate over the value of the quadruple jump and the athleticism it embodies in the ISU scoring system. Since its adoption in 2004, the ISU judging system has placed a greater value on \\"spins, transitions and small steps\\" in order to balance athleticism with artistry and encourage all-around skating. Critics, however, say that the current system achieves this balance by discouraging skaters from attempting the toughest element and leads figure skating to stagnation. It does this, they claim, by not awarding enough points for the quadruple jump and penalizing skaters if it is not done successfully. In 2008, the scoring system adopted a requirement that a failed quad receive a deduction of up to three points. This has led to some skaters feeling that attempting to do a quad is not worth the risk and reward, as much easier jumps present a better opportunity for athletes to collect the needed points. \\"I had one fall in my program on a triple Lutz. They considered it a double with a fall. I got 1.09 points. Then Nobunari Oda fell on a quad but they downgraded it to a triple toe because it was under- rotated and he got one point. I got more points for falling on a cheated triple Lutz than he got falling on a cheated quad,\\" said Jeremy Abbott on his dislike of the rule with reference to the 2009 Four Continents Figure Skating Championships. A triple Axel is worth 8.2 points as opposed to the quad's base value of 9.8. A skater can earn up to three bonus points if the triple Axel is well executed. Some figure skaters feel that instead of risking penalties for falling while attempting a quad, it is better to attempt a triple Axel, which is safer and more likely to be landed cleanly. Additionally, the difference in base value between a triple Axel and a triple Lutz is 2.2 points, whereas between a quadruple toe and a triple Axel it is only 1.6 points. The degree of difficulty, however, between a triple Axel and a quad is greater than the degree of difficulty between a triple Lutz and a triple Axel. =Implemented changes to the ISU scoring system= Following the figure skating competition in Vancouver, the ISU was urged to reexamine the scoring system at its general assembly scheduled for June, 2010, and adopt changes in order to reward skaters who do technically difficult jumps. The value of the quad was raised to over ten points - 10.3 - at the ISU conference. The values of some triple jumps were reduced and a step sequence was removed from the short program; and the second step sequence in the men's free skate would not be given a level but would have a base value of two and be judged on Grade of Execution. The GoE for triple jumps was reduced in value while the GoE for the quad remained the same.

Taylor & Francis, 1996. On December 17, 1990, a group of Christian youth assembled to protest the desecration and attack on St. John Vianney's Church in Peshawar. Prime Minister Mian Nawaz Sharif has directed all federal and provincial authorities to protect minorities and their places of worship. Armed police have been posted at the church since December 15, 1990. Church leaders protested the government's failure to arrest Muslim extremists responsible for desecrating St. John Vianney's Church in Peshawar, and the Catholic church in Bahawalpur. The Peshawar church was stoned and windows were broken in November 1990, and the church in Bahawalpur was burned down in 1985. The protesters also demanded that the Qisas (retaliation) and Diyat (blood money) Ordinance not be implemented for non-Muslims; that Christians being tried under Islamic law be tried under civil law; that the bill allowing intercaste marriages be cancelled; and a minority commission headed by a Supreme Court judge be formed to formulate a Christian personal law.

Saprolite is a chemically weathered rock. Saprolites form in the lower zones of soil profiles and represent deep weathering of the bedrock surface. In most outcrops its color comes from ferric compounds. Deeply weathered profiles are widespread on the continental landmasses between latitudes 35¬∞N and 35¬∞S. Conditions for the formation of deeply weathered regolith include a topographically moderate relief flat enough to prevent erosion and to allow leaching of the products of chemical weathering. A second condition is long periods of tectonic stability; tectonic activity and climate change can cause erosion. The third condition is humid tropical to temperate climate.

Submicron-sized goethite [FeO(OH)] is yellow; coarse goethite is brown. Sub- micron-sized hematite [Fe2O3] is red; coarse hematite is gray to black. Regoliths vary from a few meters to over thick, depending on the age of the land surface, tectonic activity, climate, climate history and the composition of the bedrock. Although these deeply weathered terrains now occur in a wide variety of climates ranging from warm humid to arid, tropical to temperate, they were formed under similar conditions in the past. In parts of Africa, India, South America, Australia and southeast Asia, regolith has been forming continuously for over 100 million years. Deeply weathered regoliths are widespread in the inter-tropical belt, particularly on the continental landmasses between latitudes 35¬∞N and 35¬∞S. Similar weathered regoliths exist at much higher latitudes - 35‚Äì42¬∞S in southeast Australia (Victoria and Tasmania), 40‚Äì45¬∞N in the United States (Oregon and Wisconsin) and 55¬∞N in Europe (North Ireland, Germany) - although these are not regionally extensive. In some localities it is possible to relatively date saprolite by considering that the saprolite must be younger than the parent material and older than any thick cover unit such a lava or sedimentary rock. This principle is useful in some contexts but in others, like certain parts of Sweden where grus is formed from Precambrian rocks and overlain by Quaternary deposits, it is of little value. Formation The regolith of a region is the product of its long weathering history; leaching and dispersion are dominant during the initial phase of weathering under humid conditions. Saprolites form in high rainfall regions which result in chemical weathering and are characterised by distinct decomposition of the parent rock's mineralogy. Conditions for the formation of deeply weathered regolith include a topographically moderate relief flat enough to allow leaching of the products of chemical weathering. A second condition is long periods of tectonic stability; tectonic activity and climate change partially erode the regolith. Weathering rates of per million years suggest that deep regoliths require several million years to develop. The third condition is humid tropical to temperate climate; higher temperatures enable reactions to occur more rapidly. Deep weathering can occur in cooler climates, but over longer periods of time. Sulfides are some of the most unstable minerals in humid, oxidizing environments; many cadmium, cobalt, copper, molybdenum, nickel and zinc sulfides are easily leached to deep in the profile. Carbonates are highly soluble, especially in acidic environments; the elements hosted by them - calcium, magnesium, manganese and strontium - are strongly leached. Serpentinite - oxidized and hydrolized low-silicon, iron- and magnesium-rich oxide igneous rocks - are progressively weathered through this zone. Ferromagnesian minerals are the principal hosts for nickel, cobalt, copper and zinc in sulfide-poor mafic and ultramafic rocks, and are retained higher in the profile than sulfide-hosted metals. They are leached from the upper horizons and reprecipitate with secondary iron-manganese oxides in the mid- to lower saprolite. Uses Aquifers in Western Australia are of saprolite grit. Poorly weathered saprolite grit aquifers are capable of producing groundwater, often suitable for livestock. Yields depend on the texture of the materials and their depth from which the aquifer is derived. The distributions of gold and calcium carbonate or calcium magnesium carbonates are closely correlated and documented in the southern Yilgarn Craton, Western Australia, in the top of the soil profile and locally as deep as . The gold-carbonate association is also apparent in the Gawler Craton, South Australia. Supergene enrichment occurs near the surface and involves water circulation with its resulting oxidation and chemical weathering. Deep weathering causes the formation of many secondary and supergene ores - bauxite, iron ores, saprolitic gold, supergene copper, uranium and heavy minerals in residual accumulations.

The plant was formally announced in July 2008 and began production of the Passat B7 (initially called the Passat NMS (New Midsize Sedan)) in April 2011 prior to being formally inaugurated in May 2011. The plant began production in April 2011 with a version of the 2012 Volkswagen Passat NMS, tailored to the US market, and has a projected annual production of 150,000 cars. Production of the Volkswagen Atlas commenced in 2017. In 2019, VW announced that the I.D. Crozz and Buzz all-electric vehicles would be produced at the plant in a new electric vehicle division beginning in 2022. Background The local plant, building a localized product, allows Volkswagen to avoid exchange rate fluctuations, monitor US automotive market trends, and potentially reduce vulnerability to extended supply chain issues. At its outset, Chattanooga Assembly manufactured 85% of the Passat's content, and about 85% of the content of the North American Passat comes from North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) countries. The company initially had plans for an expansion that would increase capacity to 592,000 vehicles a year. Labor costs at the Tennessee plant, including wages and benefits, have been estimated to average $27 an hour, below those of Ford, GM, Chrysler, and some foreign automakers. As of late 2012, cars manufactured at the Chattanooga Assembly Plant have been exported to Mexico, Canada, South Korea, and the Middle East. The Chattanooga plant opened 23 years after the closing of the Westmoreland Assembly Plant near New Stanton, Pennsylvania, in 1988. The Westmoreland plant, which began operation in 1978, had been characterized by labor unrest and suffered from poor networking between Westmoreland and Volkswagen headquarters in then-West Germany. Site The entire facility includes approximately , and is constructed on a parcel of the Enterprise South Industrial Park in eastern Chattanooga. The industrial park comprises land that was once an ammunition plant known as the Volunteer Army Ammunition Plant (VAAP), which manufactured up to of TNT (trinitrotoluene) per month during World War II, the Korean War, and the Vietnam War. The Volkswagen facility is near a remaining storage area containg storage bunkers once used to store TNT. The site features nearby hiking, biking and walking trails, picnic areas, and overlooks, known as the Enterprise South Nature Park.  Models  Volkswagen Atlas * Volkswagen Passat (2011‚Äìpresent) * Volkswagen Atlas (2017‚Äìpresent) * Volkswagen Atlas Cross Sport (2017‚Äìpresent) Design The Volkswagen Chattanooga Assembly Plant includes a body shop, paint shop, assembly facility, a Market Delivery Options (MDO) building, technical testing center, employee training facility with classrooms, an apprentice-training school and a full-size practice paint booth, a supplier park for eight companies, and a healthcare center with a gym, childcare facilities, and medical services. The plant has the flexibility to build any of the company's front-engine/front-wheel-drive vehicles in A, B, or C-segments. The rolling- dip paint shop is sized to handle a wide range of vehicle sizes. The plant is not designed to manufacture large vehicles. The factory includes 383 robots in the body shop, which is approximately 77 percent automated. There are 4,730 weld spots and 292 welding guns. Output is about 31 cars per hour. The plant is organized with its major process areas ‚Äì body shop, main assembly, and paint shop ‚Äì in a stacked configuration with major checkpoints arranged in a concentric-circle layout ‚Äì to eliminate long walks between factory areas, to investigate a problem, for example. The body assembly line uses diode lasers.Secrets of the Superfactories (TV documentary, 2019) VW announced it would seek Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design certification for the complex. In November 2011, VW announced that the 2012 model of the Passat was named the 2012 Motor Trend Car of the Year. In December 2011, the Assembly Plant became the first auto plant in the world to get the LEED platinum certification. A 9.5 megawatt solar park supplies 13 GWh of electricity per year; 12% of plant consumption. The Volkswagen Chattanooga Assembly Plant was designed by the Nashville engineering and architecture firm SSOE, the firm Environmental Resources Management (ERM) for the environmental permitting process, and Alberici Constructors, Inc. for the construction management of the facility. The Port of Savannah, Georgia's Garden City Terminal handles imported auto parts in containers for the plant. Cost and incentives Volkswagen invested approximately one billion U.S. dollars to construct the facility, with local, state, and federal governments subsidizing the project with an estimated $577 million in incentives. Alabama had offered Volkswagen incentives of $385 million, the most the state had ever offered for an auto project. Mississippi offered incentives totaling $294 million to Toyota in 2007 for an assembly plant at Blue Springs. Kia received about $324 million in incentives from Georgia. Volkswagen had researched 398 possible sites before narrowing the choice to the states of Michigan, Alabama, and Tennessee. Work council and labor unions The Volkswagen Chattanooga Assembly Plant has attracted international attention after it was proposed that employees elect a work council for consultation and participation rights with management, in order to improve production. The United Auto Workers attempted unsuccessfully to unionize the Chattanooga plant in 2014. This was defeated in a 712-626 vote. It was backed by Volkswagen and the IG Metall union in Germany to negotiate with management on day-to-day working matters at the plant. There was, however, considerable opposition from US business groups and Republican politicians. However, the United Auto Workers was successful in winning a vote to establish a bargaining unit in 2016. The UAW again attempted to unionize the plant in June 2019. This failed by a 52 to 48 percent margin.

He was a framer of the United States Constitution, a United States Senator from Connecticut, and the third Chief Justice of the United States. Additionally, Ellsworth received 11 electoral votes in the 1796 presidential election. Born in Windsor, Connecticut, Ellsworth attended the College of New Jersey where he helped found the American Whig‚ÄìCliosophic Society. In 1777, he became the state attorney for Hartford County, Connecticut and was selected as a delegate to the Continental Congress, serving during the remainder of the American Revolutionary War. He served as a state judge during the 1780s and was selected as a delegate to the 1787 Philadelphia Convention, which produced the United States Constitution. While at the convention, Ellsworth played a role in fashioning the Connecticut Compromise between the more populous states and the less populous states. He also served on the Committee of Detail, which prepared the first draft of the Constitution, but he left the convention before signing the document. His influence helped ensure that Connecticut ratified the Constitution, and he was elected as one of Connecticut's inaugural pair of Senators, serving from 1789 to 1796. He was the chief author of the Judiciary Act of 1789, which shaped the federal judiciary of the United States and established the Supreme Court's power to overturn state supreme court decisions that were contrary to the United States Constitution. Ellsworth served as a key Senate ally to Alexander Hamilton and aligned with the Federalist Party. He led the Senate passage of Hamiltonian proposals such as the Funding Act of 1790 and the Bank Bill of 1791. He also advocated in favor of the United States Bill of Rights and the Jay Treaty. In 1796, after the Senate rejected the nomination of John Rutledge to serve as Chief Justice, President George Washington nominated Ellsworth to the position. Ellsworth was unanimously confirmed by the Senate, and served until 1800, when he resigned due to poor health. Few cases came before the Ellsworth Court, and he is chiefly remembered for his discouragement of the previous practice of seriatim opinion writing. He simultaneously served as an envoy to France from 1799 to 1800, signing the Convention of 1800 to settle the hostilities of the Quasi-War. He was succeeded as chief justice by John Marshall. He subsequently served on the Connecticut Governor's Council until his death in 1807. Youth and family life Ellsworth was born in Windsor, Connecticut, to Capt. David and Jemima (n√©e Leavitt) Ellsworth.Jemima Leavitt, born at nearby Suffield, was the daughter of Lieut. Joshua Leavitt and Hannah Devotion, and the sister of Congregationalist minister Rev. Jonathan Leavitt. He entered Yale in 1762, but transferred to the College of New Jersey (later Princeton) at the end of his second year. Along with William Paterson and Luther Martin (both of whom served with him at the Constitutional Convention in 1787) he founded the \\"Well Meaning Club,\\" which became the Cliosophic Society‚Äînow part of Whig-Clio, the nation's oldest college debating club.http://theprince.princeton.edu/princetonperiodicals/cgi- bin/princetonperiodicals?a=d&d;=Princetonian19870727-01.2.95&srpos;=1&e;=-------en-20 --1--txt-IN-----# He received his A.B. degree in 1766, Phi Beta Kappa after 2 years. Soon afterward, Ellsworth turned to the law. After four years of study, he was admitted to the bar in 1771 and later became a successful lawyer and politician. In 1772, Ellsworth married Abigail Wolcott, the daughter of Abigail Abbot and William Wolcott, nephew of Connecticut colonial governor Roger Wolcott,Abigail Wolcott was the cousin of Connecticut Governor Oliver Wolcott, Jr., for whom Wolcottville, Connecticut, later renamed Torrington was named. and granddaughter of Abiah Hawley and William Wolcott of East Windsor, Connecticut. They had nine children including the twins William Wolcott Ellsworth, who married Noah Webster's daughter, served in Congress and became the governor of Connecticut; and Henry Leavitt Ellsworth, who became the first Commissioner of the United States Patent Office, the mayor of Hartford, president of Aetna Life Insurance and a large benefactor of Yale College. Oliver Ellsworth was the grandfather of Henry L. Ellsworth's son Henry W. Ellsworth. Revolutionary War From a slow start, Ellsworth built up a prosperous law practice. In 1777, he became Connecticut's state attorney for Hartford County. That same year, he was chosen as one of Connecticut's representatives in the Continental Congress. He served on various committees until 1783, including the Marine Committee, the Board of Treasury, and the Committee of Appeals. Ellsworth was also active in his state's efforts during the Revolution, having served as a member of the Committee of the Pay Table that supervised Connecticut's war expenditures. In 1777 he joined the Committee of Appeals, which can be described as a forerunner of the Federal Supreme Court. While serving on it, he participated in the Olmstead case that first brought state and federal authority into conflict. In 1779, he assumed greater duties as a member of the Council of Safety, which, with the governor, controlled all military measures for the state. His first judicial service was on the Supreme Court of Errors when it was established in 1785, but he soon shifted to the Connecticut Superior Court and spent four years on its bench. Constitutional Convention Oliver and Abigail Ellsworth by Ralph Earl Ellsworth participated in the 1787 Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia as a delegate from Connecticut along with Roger Sherman and William Samuel Johnson. More than half of the 55 delegates were lawyers, eight of whom, including both Ellsworth and Sherman, had previous experience as judges conversant with legal discourse. Ellsworth took an active part in the proceedings beginning on June 20, when he proposed the use of \\"the United States\\" to identify the government under the authority of the Constitution. The words \\"United States\\" had already been used in the Declaration of Independence and Articles of Confederation as well as Thomas Paine's The American Crisis. It was Ellsworth's proposal to retain the earlier wording to sustain the emphasis on a federation rather than a single national entity. Three weeks earlier, on May 30, 1787, Edmund Randolph of Virginia had moved to create a \\"national government\\" consisting of a supreme legislative, an executive, and a judiciary. Ellsworth accepted Randolph's notion of a threefold division but moved to strike the phrase \\"national government.\\" Since then, the \\"United States\\" has been the official title used in the Convention to designate the government. The complete name, \\"the United States of America,\\" had already been featured by Paine, and its inclusion in the Constitution was the work of Gouverneur Morris when he made the final editorial changes in the Constitution. Ellsworth played a major role in the adoption of the Connecticut Compromise. The Convention was deadlocked over the question of representation in Congress, with the large states wanting proportional representation and the small states demanding equal representation for each state. During the debate, he joined his fellow Connecticut delegate Roger Sherman in proposing the bicameral Congress in which two members of the Senate would be elected by each state legislature, while membership in the House of Representatives would be apportioned among the states based on its share of the whole population of the states. The compromise was adopted by the Convention on July 16, 1787. On the contentious issue of whether slaves would be counted as part of the population in determining representation of the states in Congress or would instead be considered property and so not be counted, Ellsworth voted for the eventual Three-Fifths Compromise. Later, stressing that he had no slaves, Ellsworth spoke twice before the convention, on August 21 and 22, in favor of slavery being abolished.The Constitutional Convention and the Formation of the Union, Solberg, Winton ed. 1990, p. 280 He also played an important role in keeping the concept of judicial review out of the Constitution. Along with James Wilson, John Rutledge, Edmund Randolph, and Nathaniel Gorham, Ellsworth served on the Committee of Detail, which prepared the first draft of the Constitution, based on resolutions that had already been passed by the Convention. The Convention deliberations were interrupted from July 26 to August 6, 1787 while the committee completed its task. Though Ellsworth left the Convention near the end of August and did not sign the final document, he wrote the Letters of a Landholder to promote its ratification. He also played a dominant role in Connecticut's 1788 ratification convention, when he emphasized that judicial review guaranteed federal sovereignty. It seems more than a coincidence that both he and Wilson served as members of the Committee of Detail without mentioning judicial review in the initial draft of the Constitution but then stressed its central importance at their ratifying conventions just a year preceding its inclusion by Ellsworth in the Judiciary Act of 1789. United States Senate Letter from Ellsworth to George Washington wishing former president \\"a most respectful and most cordial farewell,\\" March 1797 Along with William Samuel Johnson, Ellsworth served as one of Connecticut's first two United States senators in the new federal government. He identified with the emerging Federalist Party and played a dominant role in Senate proceedings equivalent to that of Senate Majority Leaders in later decades. According to John Adams, he was \\"the firmest pillar of [Washington's] whole administration in the Senate.\\"[Brown, 231] Aaron Burr complained that if Ellsworth had misspelled the name of the Deity with two D's, \\"it would have taken the Senate three weeks to expunge the superfluous letter.\\" Senator William Maclay, a Republican Senator from Pennsylvania, offered a more hostile assessment: \\"He will absolutely say anything, nor can I believe he has a particle of principle in his composition,\\" and \\"I can in truth pronounce him one of the most candid men I ever knew possessing such abilities.\\" [Brown, 224‚Äì25] What seems to have bothered McClay the most was Ellsworth's emphasis on private negotiations and tacit agreement rather than public debate. Significantly, there was no official record of Senate proceedings for the first five years of its existence, nor was there any provision to accommodate spectators. The arrangement was essentially the same as for the 1787 Convention, in contrast to the open sessions of the House of Representatives. Ellsworth's first project was the Judiciary Act, described as Senate Bill No. 1, which effectively supplemented Article III in the Constitution by establishing a hierarchical arrangement among state and federal courts. Years later Madison stated, \\"It may be taken for certain that the bill organizing the judicial department originated in his [Ellsworth's] draft, and that it was not materially changed in its passage into law.\\"[Brown, 185] Ellsworth himself probably wrote Section 25, the most important component of the Judiciary Act. This gave the Federal Supreme Court the power to veto state supreme court decisions supportive of state laws in conflict with the U.S. Constitution. All state and local laws accepted by state supreme courts could be appealed to the federal Supreme Court, which was given the authority, if it chose, to deny them for being unconstitutional. State and local laws rejected by state supreme courts could not be appealed in this manner; only the laws accepted by these courts could be appealed. This seemingly modest specification provided the federal government with its only effective authority over state government at the time. In effect, judicial review supplanted Congressional Review, which Madison had unsuccessfully proposed four times at the Convention to guarantee federal sovereignty. Granting the federal government this much authority was apparently rejected because its potential misuse could later be used to reject the Constitution at State Ratifying Conventions. Upon the completion of these conventions the previous year, Ellsworth was in the position to render the sovereignty of the federal government defensible, but through judicial review instead of congressional review. Once the Judiciary Act was adopted by the Senate, Ellsworth sponsored the Senate's acceptance of the Bill of Rights promoted by Madison in the House of Representatives. Significantly, Madison sponsored the Judiciary Act in the House at the same time. Combined, the Judiciary Act and Bill of Rights gave the Constitution the \\"teeth\\" that had been missing in the Articles of Confederation. Judicial Review guaranteed the federal government's sovereignty, whereas the Bill of Rights guaranteed the protection of states and citizens from the misuse of this sovereignty by the federal government. The Judiciary Act and Bill of Rights thus counterbalanced each other, each guaranteeing respite from the excesses of the other. However, with the passage of the Fourteenth Amendment in 1865, seventy-five years later, the Bill of Rights could be brought to bear at all levels of government as interpreted by the judiciary with final appeal to the Supreme Court. Needless to say, this had not been the original intention of either Madison or Ellsworth. Ellsworth was the principal supporter in the Senate of Hamilton's economic program, having served on at least four committees dealing with budgetary issues. These issues included the passage of Hamilton's plan for funding the national debt, the incorporation of the First Bank of the United States, and the bargain whereby state debts were assumed in return for locating the capital to the south (today the District of Columbia). Ellsworth's other achievements included framing the measure that admitted North Carolina to the Union, devising the non-intercourse act that forced Rhode Island to join the union, and drawing up the bill to regulate the consular service. He also played a major role in convincing President Washington to send John Jay to England to negotiate the 1794 Jay Treaty that prevented warfare with England, settled debts between the two nations, and gave American settlers better access to the Midwest. Supreme Court and later life thumb =Ellsworth Court= On March 3, 1796, Ellsworth was nominated by President George Washington to be Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, the seat having been vacated by John Jay. (Jay's replacement, John Rutledge, had been rejected by the Senate the previous December, and Washington's next nominee, William Cushing, had declined the office in February.). He quickly was confirmed by the United States Senate (21‚Äì1), and took the prescribed judicial oath on March 8, 1796. No major cases came before the Supreme Court during Ellsworth's brief tenure as chief justice. However, four cases the Court issued rulings on were of lasting importance in American jurisprudence: Hylton v. United States (1796) implicitly addressed the Supreme Court's power of judicial review in upholding a federal carriage tax; Hollingsworth v. Virginia (1798) affirmed that the president had no official role in the constitutional amendment process; Calder v. Bull (1798) held that the Constitution's Ex post facto clause applied only to criminal, not civil, cases; and New York v. Connecticut (1799) which was the first use by the Court of its original jurisdiction under Article III of the United States Constitution to hear controversies between two states. Ellsworth's chief legacy as Chief Justice is his discouragement of the previous practice of seriatim opinion writing, in which each Justice wrote a separate opinion in the case and delivered that opinion from the bench. Ellsworth instead encouraged the consensus of the Court to be represented in a single written opinion, a practice which continues to the present day. Ellsworth received 11 electoral college votes from three states in the 1796 presidential election. Those votes came at the expense of Thomas Pinckney, who as a result, lost the vice presidency to Thomas Jefferson.https://www.archives.gov/federal-register/electoral- college/votes/1789_1821.html#1796 President Adams appointed Ellsworth United States Envoy Extraordinary to the Court of France in 1799, and tasked with settling differences with Napoleon's government regarding restrictions on U.S. shipping that might otherwise have led to military conflict between the two nations. The agreement accepted by Ellsworth provoked indignation among Americans for being too generous to Napoleon. Moreover, Ellsworth came down with a severe illness resulting from his travel across the Atlantic, prompting him to resign from the Court in late 1800, while still in Europe. =Later life= Though he retired from national public life upon his return to America in early 1801, he later served once more on the Connecticut Governor's Council. He was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1803. Ellsworth died at his home in Windsor, Connecticut on November 26, 1807, at the age of 62. He is buried at the Palisado Cemetery, behind the First Church of Windsor.. Legacy In retrospect, Ellsworth's role in helping to establish the United States as a viable sovereign nation was important but could be easily overlooked. A good part of the reason for this was that he did not distinguish himself as an orator but worked as much as possible behind the scenes. He was said to have been dominant in his eloquence at the January 1788, Connecticut Ratifying Convention, but later as the de facto Senate majority leader he seems to have kept his arguments relatively short and to the point. His written prose could on occasion be tortuous, as best illustrated by the operative sentence in Section 25 of the Judiciary Act (the first of only two sentences). Over three hundred words long, this sentence is almost impossible to decipher as an explanation how state courts were answerable to federal authority. But perhaps this opacity was intentional, since the expansion of federal power specified by Section 25 was mostly overlooked in debate both in the Senate and House of Representatives despite having been the most important and potentially controversial portion of the Judiciary Act. That Ellsworth promoted the federal government as a unified confederacy without the limitations imposed by the Articles of Confederation enhanced his popularity during the first several decades of America's history, especially in the South preceding the Civil War. In 1847, thirteen years before the Civil War, John Calhoun praised Ellsworth as the first of three Founding Fathers (including Sherman and Paterson) who gave the United States \\"the best government instead of the worst and most intolerable on the earth.\\"Brown, 164‚Äì165 However, rapid industrialization and the centralization of U.S. national government since the Civil War have led to the almost complete neglect of Ellsworth's pivotal contribution at the inception of U.S. government. Few today know much of anything about him. Ellsworth's twin sons followed their father into public service. William Wolcott Ellsworth married a daughter of lexicographer Noah Webster and became Governor of the State of Connecticut, a United States Congressman and a justice of the Connecticut Supreme Court. His twin brother, Henry Leavitt Ellsworth, served as mayor of Hartford, then was appointed the first commissioner of the U.S. Patent Office. He later became president of Aetna Life Insurance Company. Henry Leavitt Ellsworth was instrumental in the creation of the U.S. Agriculture Department, and he was appointed by President Andrew Jackson to oversee the so-called Trail of Tears, the transfer of Cherokee Indians from Georgia to the Oklahoma Territory that cost approximately 4,000 lives. He was a friend and backer of inventors Samuel Colt and Samuel F.B. Morse, and his daughter Annie Ellsworth proposed the first message transmitted by Morse over the telegraph, \\"What hath God wrought?\\" Henry Leavitt Ellsworth was a major benefactor to Yale College, his alma mater. Even if Ellsworth was viewed as \\"a valuable acquisition to the Court,\\" and \\"a great loss to the Senate,\\" he resigned after just four years due to his \\"constant, and at times excruciating pains,\\" sufferings made worse by his Europe travels, as special envoy to France.Laboratory of Justice, The Supreme Court's 200 Year Struggle to Integrate Science and the Law, by David L.

Released on February 25, 2016, developed and published by Crate Entertainment. Crate Entertainment announced on July 27, 2009 that they had licensed the Titan Quest engine from Iron Lore and announced Grim Dawn's development on January 21, 2010. Initially, few details were revealed, with Crate Entertainment simply stating that Grim Dawn is set in a thematically dark fictional world loosely based on the Victorian era. Plot The game takes place in Cairn, a dark, war-torn world where a once proud empire has been brought to ruin and the human race driven to the edge of extinction. Cairn has become ground zero of an eternal war between two otherworldly powers, the Aetherials, who view human bodies as a resource to use, and the Chthonians, who are intent on destroying humanity before that can happen. Humans at some point had come into communication with extra-dimensional beings. They learned things from the whisperings of these otherworldly entities and eventually attempted to open a portal to bring one across. Naturally, being paranoid of the unknown as humans often are, they also devised a way to imprison it once it came through. Through experimentation, they learned that these beings, made of aether, a sort of spiritual energy, could fuse themselves with the human mind, possessing and controlling their host if they were able to subvert the human's will. The researchers discovered that a human, once possessed, retained heightened abilities after the aetherial being was purged from them. Naturally, this research got out of control as such things always do. The researchers brought over more aetherials, they got loose, the aetherials were able to then open more portals into their own world, bringing over large numbers of their brethren. While the Aetherials were seeking to use human bodies as a resource, the Chthonians appeared to destroy the human race before that could happen. This cataclysmic war not only decimated human civilization but warped the very fabric of reality and, in its wake, gave life to new horrors. The world of Cairn can never be fully restored to the way it once was. Grim Dawn is about survival and adaptation to the grim new reality. Small enclaves of human survivors exist scattered throughout the world, holed up in hidden refuges. These humans have quietly watched the warring invaders destroy one another and have become wise to the strengths and vulnerabilities of their otherworldly foes. A few survivors have begun to exhibit strange new abilities after surviving possession or exposure to the warp. These unnatural powers are feared by some but give many new hope of launching a resistance to fight the \\"outsiders\\" and reclaim what's left of their world. Gameplay Like other prominent action role-playing games, the majority of the gameplay in Grim Dawn centers around fast-paced combat and the collection of loot - armor, potions, weapons, and money. Crate confirmed in an interview that Grim Dawn will feature a crafting system similar to that used in Warcraft III: Reign of Chaos's popular mod Defense of the Ancients. Grim Dawn will also build upon existing systems present in Titan Quest, such as improved physics, location specific damage effects, dismemberment, and a completely redesigned quest system. In redesigning the quest system, Crate confirmed that Grim Dawn will feature factions. Development Grim Dawn's development is notable for Crate Entertainment's open appeal to their fans for financial support. In a posting on the game's official website, the developers announced that after a period of increased email activity from fans wishing to donate to Crate to support the project that they had added a pre-order page to the game's official website to allow fans to contribute to the project in an official manner. Fifteen days later in another posting on the game's official website, Crate stated that they had received financial support from gaming website Gamebanshee and one of the authors of the gaming related webcomic Penny Arcade. Despite this support from their fans and various websites, Crate manager Arthur Bruno stated in an interview with The Escapist that pre-orders made for only a very small percentage of Grim Dawn's total budget. In a later interview with gaming website Big Download, Bruno again confirmed that donations and pre-orders alone were not enough to completely fund the project. Additionally, Bruno revealed that Crate intended to provide new gameplay content for Grim Dawn in the way of expansions every six to ten months. On April 17, 2012, Crate Entertainment opened a project page on Kickstarter, setting a funding goal of $280,000, with the halfway point of this goal being reached in four days. It finished up with $537,515, well exceeding its initial funding goal. Crate released an alpha version of the game (Build 8) through the Steam Early Access program on May 15, 2013.  Release  On February 25, 2016, the game entered full release with v1.0.0.0 (build 31 hotfix 1). =Downloadable content and expansions= The Crucible On August 3, 2016, a new game mode called The Crucible was released as downloadable content. Ashes of Malmouth On October 11, 2017 Grim Dawn's first expansion, Ashes of Malmouth, was released The Forgotten Gods On March 5, 2018, a second expansion was announced, called Forgotten Gods, and was released on March 27, 2019. Reception =Critical reception= Grim Dawn received generally favorable reviews from 29 critics, according to review aggregator Metacritic. Leif Johnson of PC Gamer wrote: \\"If anything, Grim Dawn is both empowered and chained down by its retro stylings, preventing, say, the randomized levels of Diablo III and thus its endless potential for replay. But on the upside, none of its recent competitors deliver that old-style hack-and-slash experience so purely and so satisfyingly, and its hybrid class system makes each new jaunt a little different. More than once it found me playing until dawn, and my appreciation for any game that manages to do that is anything but grim.\\" =Sales= Grim Dawn sold over 1million units worldwide and its DLC, Crucible, over 200,000. In a live dev stream on 19 April 2019 Crate announced that the \\"Forgotten Gods\\" expansion had sold over 100,000 copies and the combined figure collectively, between all of the DLCs and the base game, was over 3 million.

A nearby island, Sado, boasts a rich gold mine which provides plentiful richesThis gold was called goyokin, roughly translated as \\"gold for official use\\", hence the title of the film. for the Tokugawa clan. When one of the gold ships sink, the local fishermen recover some of the gold, intending to return it to the Tokugawa clan. However, Magobei's clan master, Rokugo Tatewaki, takes the gold and slaughters the fishermen so they cannot report the gold stolen. Magobei is appalled. He promises not to report Rokugo to the shogunate in exchange for Rokugo's promise to never do so again. However, three years later, assassins sent by Rokugo's retainer, Kunai, come for Magobei, who is living in Edo. He realizes that Rokugo intends to steal more gold and slaughter more innocents. So Magobei returns to Sabai to face his former master. Rokugo hires another ronin, Samon Fujimaki, to kill Magobei, but Magobei eventually wins him over. Also, along the way, Magobei meets a young woman, Oriha, who survived the original slaughter. She and her brother, Rokuzo, join him on his way to Sabai. At Sabai they learn that Rokugo intends to move a bonfire, which serves as a warning to passing ships against dangerous rocks, so that a gold ship will hit the rocks and sink. After recovering the gold, Rokugo intends to slaughter the peasants who help him in this endeavor. The combined efforts of Magobei, Samon, Oriha, and Rokuzo result in the correct bonfire being lit, the fake bonfire being put out, and the innocent peasants' lives being saved.

Hapsidopareiontids are known from the Early Permian of the United States and possibly Germany and the Czech Republic.

Members of Ostodolepidae, another microsaur family, also possess temporal embayments, but they not as extensive as those of hapsidopareiontids, which extend into the skull roof.

Their first action was an attempted bombing of West Berlin's Jewish Community Centre on November 9, 1969 (the anniversary of Kristallnacht); the bomb, supplied by the undercover government agent Peter Urbach, failed to explode. Translated into English by Sign and Sight.Kundnani 88, 90 This was followed in the fall of 1969 by a number of bombings and arsons targeting police, judges, and US and Israeli targets.Kundnani 97 The TW claimed responsibility for these attacks under a variety of different names in order to exaggerate the size of their movement. The group was led by Kunzelmann and von Rauch, and dissolved after the former was arrested in 1970 and the latter was killed by police in 1971. Its core members then formed the Movement 2 June, while some others joined the Red Army Faction. The Jewish Community Centre bombing In 2005 the historian Wolfgang Kraushaar published a book on the Tupamaros' attempted bombing of the West Berlin Jewish Community Centre, setting off a debate on anti-semitism in the German left and the German student movement. The bombing was allegedly planned by Kunzelmann and the bomb itself planted by Albert Fichter, brother of the Sozialistischer Deutscher Studentenbund's then- chairman, Tilman Fichter. On the date of the attempted bombing more than 200 people had gathered in the community center to commemorate Kristallnacht. The Tupamaros Munich Around the time of the TW's creation Fritz Teufel formed a similar group in Munich, the Tupamaros Munich (TM). Brigitte Mohnhaupt, later an important figure in the second generation of the RAF, was a member.

Threat Management Units identify risk factors, patterns of escalation, and construct an environment that inhibits or prevents violence. The services provided cover a wide range of topics, including, but not limited to terrorism, school violence, sexual crimes, stalking, cyber crimes (cyber stalking), domestic violence, arson, sabotage, communicated threats, insider threats and pre-attack behavior. Research in this area of law enforcement is known as Threat Safety Science. Origins The Los Angeles Police Department created the first Threat Management Unit, the Los Angeles Police Department Threat Management Unit, founded by retired LAPD Captain Robert Martin, in 1990 after the murder of actress Rebecca Lucile Schaeffer. Threat Management Units have been adopted by many city, county, state and federal law enforcement agencies, including agencies from Canada, Australia, the United Kingdom, Europe, Asia, Hong Kong and South America; as well as private security consultants all seeking to implement a form of TMU for contracted national and foreign jurisdictions. Notable Programs =Los Angeles Police Department= The Los Angeles Police Department Threat Management Unit was established in 1990. The primary mission of the LAPD TMU is to ensure the safety and well-being of members of the diverse communities of the City of Los Angeles by investigating and managing aggravated cases, both criminal and non-criminal, wherein individuals have demonstrated an abnormal fixation or obsession and have generated a long- term pattern of unsolicited acts of visitation, telephonic or written correspondence in a threatening manner toward a specific person. The LAPD TMU works cooperatively with the Los Angeles Police Department Mental Evaluation Unit (MEU) to evaluate stalking suspects who often suffer from some form of mental instability and workplace violence suspects who experience some form of mental health crisis when they make threats and engage in acts of violence. The MEU, Systemwide Mental Assessment Response Team (SMART) accompanies TMU on all of its calls involving stalkers and workplace violence. Both the TMU and MEU comprise the Crisis Response Support Section (CRSS). =University of Texas at Houston Police Department= The University of Texas at Houston Police Department established a Threat Management Unit under the leadership of Chief William H. Adcox. The Unit is led by Inspector Vicki King and advised by Dr. Gregory H. Botz who provides insight into applications in the healthcare industry. The unit has been credited with a 300% increase in early intervention reporting between 2012 and 2014. Reports indicate that hospital employees feel more comfortable reporting concerning behavior so officers can get these individuals help before their behavior escalates to criminal activity or harm to themselves or others. The unit was involved in 11 suicide interventions in a four-month period where the people investigated were held under an Emergency Detention Order and given psychiatric care. During that same four-month period, the Threat Management Unit intervened in 18 cases in which the subject was considered to be at high risk for committing a violent act. Researchers at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center are pioneering threat safety science and principles of de-escalation of threat and risk in order to develop tactical solutions in Threat Safety Science in healthcare.

It consists of a small serving of soba noodles in small bowls. In this soba experience, you quickly eat your soba noodles and get your bowl immediately refilled in repetition. History and origins The name wanko comes from the regional dialect of the Iwate Prefecture from which it comes, meaning \\"bowl\\", but more specifically, a small, wooden Japanese soup bowl. There are many theories about the origin of the dish itself however. *One such origin is of a landowner who was having a festival on his land. There was a crowd of over 100 villagers and guests who customarily ate soba at festivals. However, there were so many people to feed but the pots in which the soba were to be made were very small. The soba noodles were spread around in reduced quantities so that there would be enough for everyone. *Nanbu Toshinao, a territorial lord of the Nanbu area, came and stopped at a house in Hanamaki asking for a meal. His retainers served him a local variety of soba in a small soup bowl. Thinking they served Nanbu Toshinao something too rustic and without much flavor, they were afraid of his reaction. But Nanbu Toshinao thought it was delicious, and ordered more servings. This is said to have established the tradition of hosts continuing to serve small bowls until their guest was satisfied. There are many stories of how the dish came to be, but these two are the most common. However, as the term \\"wanko\\" did not come about until after World War II, some repudiate the stories. In December 1957, the Hanamaki-shi Cultural Centre was the site of the first annual contest on who could eat the most bowls of wanko soba. The event continues to this day featuring noodle fans from many countries.

The diocese served members of the Church of the East in Armenia, and its bishops sat at Halat. The diocese is last mentioned in 1281, and probably lapsed in the fourteenth century during the disorders that attended the fragmentation of the Mongol empire. Background The East Syriac diocese of Armenia, whose bishops sat in the town of Halat on the northern shore of Lake Van, is attested between the fifth and fourteenth centuries. In the fifth century the diocese of Halat was not assigned to a metropolitan province, but was later included in the province of Nisibis, probably shortly after the Arab conquest of Persia. The patriarch Timothy I created a short-lived metropolitan province for Armenia, presumably by raising the status of the diocese of Halat. By the second half of the eleventh century Halat was once again a suffragan diocese of the province of Nisibis. By the thirteenth century the jurisdiction of the bishops of Halat included the towns of Van and Wastan. The thirteenth-century Nestorian metropolitan Shlemun of Basra, author of the Book of the Bee (c.1222), was a native of Halat.Fiey, POCN, 47‚Äì8, 53 and 58‚Äì9  Bishops of Armenia  Lake Van viewed from space.

Instructors in other disciplines also begin each class period with prayer or a short devotional thought, many which encourage student input. Daily, students gather in the auditorium for Prayer & Praise, a 20 minute time slot for singing and praying. Weekly, the entire student body gathers together in the auditorium for an hour-long chapel service. Outside the classrooms there is year-round spiritually oriented programming that relies on student involvement.

He was notably the first conductor of both the Vancouver Symphony Orchestra and the Ottawa Symphony Orchestra, the latter of which he founded in 1944. As a composer he produced several orchestral works, including a violin concerto, four symphonic poems, a Sketch for flute, violin, and orchestra, Overture in D, and Intermezzo. He also wrote a string quartet, the scherzo Beware of Love for a cappella choir, and a number of songs. Early life and career in Europe and the United States De Ridder was born in Dordrecht, Netherlands, as the son of Eudia Lina Pierson and Willem de Ridder, banker, cellist and president of the Dordrecht Music Society.Erik Watt, Banker-Musician's Son Had Dreams Fulfilled, The Evening Citizen, Ottawa, 4 May 1946 From 1899 he studied violin in The Hague with Carl Bayer, and between 1903 and 1909 he studied violin and conducting at the Cologne University of Music under Fritz Steinbach and Hermann Abendroth. His conducting career started in Arnhem. Here Willem Mengelberg saw him and was so impressed that he invited him to be guest conductor with his Concertgebouw Orchestra in Amsterdam. He later conducted the Residentie Orchestra in The Hague, where he took composition lessons from Johan Wagenaar. He was conductor of the Netherlands National Opera (Nederlandsche Opera) from 1917 to 1919. In April 1918 in Amsterdam, he married Pauline E.E. Mendelssohn-Bartholdy (grand- niece of the famous composer), whom he had met in Cologne. In 1919 De Ridder emigrated with his wife to the United States where he first worked as a violist in the Boston Symphony Orchestra and then the Richmond Symphony. In the early 1920s he became assistant conductor and principal violist of the Los Angeles Philharmonic (LAP). Many of his orchestral compositions were premiered by American orchestras like the LAP during the 1920s. Life and career in Canada De Ridder was appointed the first conductor of the Vancouver Symphony Orchestra in 1930, a post he held until 1941. Initially the post was part- time, as the orchestra performed only four concerts annually during its first three seasons. However, in 1933 Ridder moved to Vancouver as the orchestra's concert offerings began to expand significantly. Shortly after moving to that city he formed the chamber group the Allard de Ridder Chamber Music Quartette which he actively directed and performed with during the 1930s. In 1934 he established a summer concert series for the VSO at the newly built Malkin Bowl in Stanley Park, a venue which he was instrumental in convincing William Harold Malkin to build. He also worked as a guest lecturer at the University of British Columbia during the late 1930s. In 1941 De Ridder left Vancouver for Toronto to join the music faculty at the Toronto Conservatory of Music. Shortly after his arrival he joined the Hart House String Quartet. He also served as a guest conductor of the Promenade Symphony Concerts in 1942 and both the Toronto Symphony Orchestra and National Symphony Orchestra in 1943. He left Vancouver in 1944 to found the Ottawa Philharmonic Orchestra (now Ottawa Symphony Orchestra), serving as the group's first conductor through 1950. In 1952 De Ridder moved back to Vancouver where he remained until he died 13 May 1966. He conducted the Holland Choir in that city during the 1950s, notably leading the group in a performance of his own Variations on a Swabian Folk Song in 1957 with the Vancouver Symphony Orchestra. He continued to teach conducting, viola, and composition in Vancouver up until his death there in 1966 at the age of 79. Among his notable pupils are John Avison, Lloyd Blackman, Bryan N.S. Gooch, Hans Gruber, Klemi Hambourg, Ricky Hyslop, and Doug Randle.

(2008). The neurobiology of learning and memory. Sunderland Mass.: Sinauer Associates Inc. Publishers. Introduction The term \\"plasticity product\\" was coined by Jerry Rudy to refer to mRNA genetic artifacts and protein products triggered by transcription factors, leading long-lasting long term potentiation (L-LTP) and sustained alterations in synaptic strength. Rudy differentiates between two types of long term potentiation: S-LTP (short-lasting) and L-LTP (long- lasting). In S-LTP the stimulus is strong enough to induce long-term potentiation but too weak to trigger intracellular events necessary to sustain synaptic changes. L-LTP is much less transient than S-LTP and involves the generation of new proteins through translation and transcription. Induction of L-LTP depends on the transcription of new mRNA and the translation of these new mRNA into proteins. These steps are encompassed by the genomic signaling hypothesis as follows: :#A stimulus is strong enough to induce L-LTP is delivered. :#A signaling cascade begins, leading to phosphorylation of transcription factors. :#mRNA is produced leading to subsequent translation of new proteins to sustain synaptic changes. Support for the genomic signaling hypothesis comes from studies conducted by Nguyen et al. demonstrating the inability to induce L-LTP following transcription inhibition immediately following the inducing stimulus but not if transcription is blocked later. The temporal effects of this inhibition suggests that L-LTP is dependent on newly synthesized \\"plasticity products.\\"Nguyen, P., Abel, T., & Kandel, E. (1994). Requirement of a critical period of transcription for induction of a late phase of LTP. Science, 265(5175), 1104-1107. cAMP-responsive element-binding (CREB) protein, a transcription factor, is also implicated in changes in synaptic plasticity. Inhibition of CREB translation likewise inhibited synaptic changes. CREB is activated in its phosphorylated form, acting as a molecular switch for production of plasticity products.Dash, P. K., Hochner, B., & Kandel, E. R. (1990). Injection of the cAMP-responsive element into the nucleus of Aplysia sensory neurons blocks long-term facilitation. Nature, 345(6277), 718-721. Two Waves of Protein Synthesis There are two waves of protein synthesis following LTP induction. The first involves local transcription and translation of mRNA and the second involves the genomic signaling cascade. =Transcription and Local Translation of mRNAs= :There is fast-acting, local translation of proteins in the dendritic region near the spines when an inducing high-frequency stimulus is applied, indicating that some plasticity-relevant mRNAs are already present and ready to be translated. To facilitate translation outside of the soma, since synapses depend on some proteins to be synthesized on site, translation machinery such as ribosomal assemblies and endoplasmic reticulum are present in dendrites (specifically in the spine neck and shaft). Local protein synthesis at the dendrites is a mechanism permitting rapid synaptic changes in response to neural activity. However, since the mRNAs existed in the dendrites prior to plasticity-inducing stimulation, they do not count as plasticity products. =Genomic Signaling Cascade= :A synapse-to-nucleus or soma-to-nucleus signaling cascade induced by synaptic activity leads to the transcription of new plasticity products in the soma of the cell. Mechanistically, signaling molecules phosphorylate cAMP- responsive element binding protein (CREB), which is a transcription factor and molecular memory switch that initiates production of mRNAs in the cell nucleus. These plasticity products must then travel back to activated synapses, meaning that this wave of plasticity product synthesis is slower. Examples of Plasticity Products A plasticity product must fit these criteria: :a) Plasticity products are proteins that are important for the maintenance of long-lasting LTP. :b) Plasticity products result from any cell- signaling cascade that is triggered by strong HFS. =PKM Œ∂= :PKM Œ∂ are protein consequences of LTP stimuli and are crucial components of the short- term LTP mechanism. Recent research concludes that the protein kinase PKMŒ∂ is a \\"core molecule\\" in maintaining late-LTP. Tetanic stimulation leads to an increase in PKMŒ∂ expression, and since PKMŒ∂ was established as necessary for maintaining late-LTP. When L-LTP is induced, synthesis of PKMŒ∂ from its brain- specific mRNA increases, and this constitutively active kinase maintains LTP in tagged synapses by upregulating AMPA receptor trafficking pathways.Yao, Y., Kelly, M. T., Sajikumar, S., Serrano, P., Tian, D., Bergold, P. J., Frey, J. U., et al. (2008). PKM Maintains Late Long-Term Potentiation by N-Ethylmaleimide-Sensitive Factor/GluR2-Dependent Trafficking of Postsynaptic AMPA Receptors. Journal of Neuroscience, 28(31), 7820-7827. :Some experimental results implicating PKM Œ∂ as a plasticity product are as follows: ::* Ling et al. found that PKM Œ∂ is necessary and sufficient for LTP maintenance. When they added an inhibitory form of PKM Œ∂, LTP was blocked. LTP was also blocked when they added PKM Œ∂ inhibitors.Ling DSF, Benardo LS, Serrano PA, Blace N, Matthew TK, Crary JF, & Sacktor TC.Protein kinase M is necessary and sufficient for LTP maintenance. Nature Neuroscience 5: 295 - 296 (2002). ::* Yao et al. also show that pKM Œ∂ is functionally critical for the maintenance of long-lasting LTP, specifically through its mediation of NSF/GluR2-dependent AMPA receptor trafficking. This conclusion was drawn from experiments involving blocking NSF/ GluR2 interactions by adding a myristoylated version of pep2m (a peptide that mimics the NSF - binding site in GluR2). This blockage prevented the expression of LTP persistence at 1 hour after high frequency stimulation (tetanization). Hernandez et al. found that LTP increases de novo synthesis of PKM Œ∂. They induced LTP in the CA1 region of hippocampal slices by 2 100 Hz 1s trains, 20 s apart. Then they homogenized the slices, and immunoprecipitated PKM Œ∂ with antiserum. Label depicted the new synthesis, of which there was a large increase. =CaMKII= :CaMKII (Calcium-calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II) is a protein kinase that must be activated by calmodulin in order to phosphorylate other proteins in the cell. It is important in modifying the postsynaptic response to glutamate (by modifying the conformation of AMPA receptors to allow a larger influx of sodium ions), and contributes to strengthening synapses. The production of the CAMKII enzyme is upregulated with plasticity-inducing stimuli. :Some experimental results implicating CaMKII as a plasticity product are as follows: ::* Giece et al. discovered that the calcium-calmodulin-dependent kinase II is required for hippocampal long-term potentiation. When they inhibited CaMKII, LTP was prevented. Also, in genetically altered mice with a CaMKII form that cannot stay active, LTP was greatly reduced.Giece KP, Fedorov NB, Filipkowski RK, Silva AJ. Autophosphorylation at Thr286 of the Calcium- Calmodulin Kinase II in LTP and Learning. Science 279(5352): 870-873. (1998). ::* However, CaMKII is not synthesized, it is modified, making it a questionable candidate under the above criteria. Researchers Blitzer et al. show that high frequency stimulation induced cAMP dependent increase in CaMKII phosphorylation and calcium-independent CaMKII activity. CA1 homogenates were probed with an antibody specific for Thr286 ‚Äì phosphorylated CaMKII and an antibody detecting total CaMKII. They observed a 22% increase in CaMKII activity after LTP-inducing HFS.Blitzer RD, Connor JH, Brown GP, Wong T, Shenolikar S, Iyengar R, Landau EM,.

After the breakup of Yugoslavia in the 1990s, this flag remains a popular Yugoslavist symbol. Monument to the Unknown Hero at the Avala mountain near Belgrade, a monument for the fallen Yugoslavs in the Balkan Wars and World War I, designed by famous Croatian sculptor Ivan Me≈°troviƒá. Yugoslavism (, —ò—É–≥–æ—Å–ª–∞–≤–∏–∑–∞–º; ) or Yugoslavdom (, —ò—É–≥–æ—Å–ª–æ–≤–µ–Ω—Å—Ç–≤–æ; ) refers to the unionism, nationalism, or patriotism associated with South Slavs/Yugoslavs and Yugoslavia. Yugoslavism has historically advocated the union of all South Slav populated territories now composing Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Montenegro, Serbia (and the disputed region of Kosovo), Slovenia, North Macedonia, and, for some like Ivan Me≈°troviƒá, Bulgaria. It became a potent political force during World War I with the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria by the Yugoslavist militant Gavrilo Princip and the subsequent invasion of Serbia by Austria-Hungary. During the war the Yugoslav Committee composed of South Slav emigres from Austria-Hungary (including twelve Serbs, three Croats, and one Slovene), supported Serbia and vouched for the creation of a Yugoslav state. On 1 December 1918, King Peter of Serbia proclaimed the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes, commonly known as \\"Yugoslavia\\". During the Yugoslav period, a Yugoslav identity (the \\"Yugoslav nation\\", Jugoslovenska nacija) was propagated.  Background  Processes such as the Rise of nationalism in Europe, Rise of nationalism in the Ottoman Empire, Italian unification, and German unification were events in the 19th century and reflected among the South Slavs, too, as their shared mother tongues all belong to a family of closely related languages. This, along with their shared history, prompted some to demand a South Slav unification akin to that which occurred for the Italians and Germans; but here there were greater political obstacles as there was no sovereign South Slav state until the end of the Serbian Revolution (with the South Slav peoples being in the Ottoman and Habsburg realms), and it was only with the end of the First World War that the better developed Croatia and Slovenia broke from Habsburg and German rule. There were also South Slavic ethnic nationalists who endorsed Yugoslavism as a means to achieve their ethnicity's unification. After 1878, Serbian nationalists merged their goals with those of Yugoslavists, emulating the leading role of the kingdom of Sardinia and Piedmont in the Risorgimento of Italy by claiming that Serbia sought not only to unite all Serbs in one state, but that it intended to be a South Slavic equivalent of Piedmont, uniting all South Slavs into one state to be known as Yugoslavia. Croatian nationalists became interested in Yugoslavism as a means to achieve the unification of the Croatian lands, in opposition to their division under Austria-Hungary, particularly with Yugoslavist leader Strossmayer advocating this as being achievable within a federalized Yugoslav monarchy. Slovenian nationalists such as Anton Koro≈°ec also endorsed Yugoslav unification during the First World War, seeing it as a means to free Slovenia from Austro-Hungarian rule. Yugoslavism also had support among Bulgarians, most notably Aleksandar Stamboliyski.Ahmet Ersoy, Maciej G√≥rny, Vangelis Kechriotis. Modernism: The Creation of Nation-States. Central European University Press, 2010. p. 363. However, Bulgarian nationalists resented Serbia's annexation of Vardar Macedonia in 1913, a region they had sought to incorporate into Bulgaria, and the Bulgarian government thus rejected a pan-South Slavic unification led by Serbia, and fought against Serbia on the side of the Central Powers who had promised Bulgaria Vardar Macedonia in exchange for their alliance. The Bulgarian coup d'√©tat of 1934 briefly brought pro-Yugoslav Bulgarians to power. They declared their intention of immediately forming an alliance with France and leading Bulgaria into an integral Yugoslavia, but this was not achieved.Khristo Angelov Khristov. Bulgaria, 1300 years. Sofia, Bulgaria: Sofia Press, 1980. p. 192. Some Yugoslavists claim that the factional divide, differences, and conflict between the Yugoslav peoples are the result of foreign imperialism in the history of the Balkans. As a result of religious divisions, Yugoslavism has typically avoided religious overtones. Yugoslavism had two major internal divisions that typically splintered the movement. One faction promotes a centralised state and assimilation of all ethnicities into a single Yugoslav nationality. The other faction supports a decentralised and multicultural federation that would preserve existing identities while promoting unity, while being opposed to the idea of centralisation and assimilation that they deemed as effectively favouring Serb hegemony rather than Yugoslav unity. Rise of Yugoslavism The concept of Yugoslavism first arose in the 1830s with the creation of the Illyrian movement that based its views of South Slavic national identity upon the ideal of national awakening of the French Revolution. The Illyrian movement was formed by Croatian writers who emphasized the common ethnic and linguistic ties between the South Slavic peoples as a basis for their cooperation and eventual political unification. The Illyrian movement was centred in Croatia and Croatian politics, believing that a Croatian renaissance was necessary to be achieved prior to the movement's long-term goal of ethnic and political unification of South Slavs. Ljudevit Gaj, a key figure of the Illyrian movement declared Croats and Serbs to be the two major subgroups of the South Slav or \\"Illyrian\\" nationality, which also included Slovenes, and South Slavic inhabitants of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, and Montenegro. In spite of its pan-South Slavic ideals, the Illyrian movement was dominated by upper-class Croats, originally with little support amongst Serbs, Slovenes, or other South Slavic peoples. During the Revolutions of 1848, the Illyrian movement became a strong political force in the Habsburg Austrian Empire, and advocated cooperation between Croats and Serbs to oppose Hungarian rule of its South Slavic populated territories. The concept and term \\"Yugoslavism\\" was founded in the later half of the nineteenth century by two Croatian Catholic bishops: Josip Juraj Strossmayer, an ethnically mixed Croat-German liberal politician; and Franjo Raƒçki. Both emphasized Yugoslavism as a supranational cultural patriotism to unite South Slavs on the basis of common origins, cultural ties, and spiritual bonds of South Slavs. However like the Illyian movement, Strossmayer's and Raƒçki's Yugoslavism found little support outside Croatia. Yugoslavism faced strong competition from other nationalist movements seeking to rally the various South Slav peoples, such as Serbian nationalism. Initially Serbian nationalists who were focused on fighting the Turks, did not cooperate with Yugoslavists, seeing little benefit in a joint movement or unification with Croats of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. However this period of noncooperation was briefly broken in the mid-1860s when Strossmayer and Serbian foreign minister Ilija Gara≈°anin agreed to work together to create \\"a Yugoslav state free from Austria or Turkey.\\" Yugoslavism is related to two contrasting doctrines from the 19th century: Pan-Slavism which then focused on unification and independence of Slavic nations from non-Slavic rulers, and Austroslavism which appealed to Slavic subjects of the Habsburg Monarchy as it had been concocted to unify Slavic nations and serve their interests within the Austro-Hungarian Empire. The concept of Yugoslavism did not become strong until the beginning of the twentieth century due to the lack of belief that South Slavs could realistically unify and the lack of popular government in Yugoslav populated territories. Yugoslavism began to arise with the overthrow of the Obrenoviƒá dynasty in Serbia in 1903 and the creation of a popular government within a constitutional monarchy. After the annexation of Bosnia and Herzegovina by Austria-Hungary in 1908 Yugoslavism soared as the multiple South Slav denominations saw themselves as victims of foreign imperialism. Famous Croat sculptor Ivan Me≈°troviƒá became a supporter of Yugoslavism and Yugoslav identity after he traveled to Serbia and became impressed with Serb culture.Ivo Banac. The national question in Yugoslavia: origins, history, politics. Cornell University Press, 1984. Pp. 204-205. Me≈°troviƒá created a sculpture of Serbian folk-legend hero Prince Marko at the International Exhibition in Rome in 1911, when asked about the statue, Me≈°troviƒá replied \\"This Marko is our Yugoslav people with its gigantic and noble heart\\". Me≈°troviƒá wrote poetry speaking of a \\"Yugoslav race\\". Those who knew Me≈°troviƒá's views referred to him as \\"The Prophet of Yugoslavism\\". In 1912, the eruption of the Balkan Wars saw various South Slavs unite against the Ottoman Empire. In 1913, Slovene intellectuals published a manifesto recognising the existence of a Yugoslav nation and calling for its independence, declaring: > As it is a fact that we Slovenes, Croats and Serbs constitute a compact > linguistic and ethnic group with similar economic conditions, and so > indissolubly linked by a common fate on a common territory that no one of > the three can aspire to a separate future, and in consideration of the fact > that among the Slovenes, Croats, and Serbs, the Jugoslav thought is even > today strongly developed, we have extended our national sentiments beyond > our frontier to the Croats and Serbs‚Ä¶By this we all become members of one > united Jugo-slav nation. World War I and the creation of Yugoslavia Depiction of the assassination of Austrian Archduke Franz Ferdinand by Serb Yugoslavist militant Gavrilo Princip. Ante Trumbiƒá, the Croat Yugoslavist who led the Yugoslav Committee that advocated for the creation of independent Yugoslavia during World War I. The assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria by Yugoslavist revolutionary Gavrilo Princip, a Serb associated with Young Bosnia, a group composed of mainly Serbs, but also Bosnian Muslims and Croats, marked the beginning of a militant nationalist activity by South Slavs against Austro- Hungarian rule. At his trial in 1914, Princip stated: \\"I am a Yugoslav nationalist, aiming for the unification of all Yugoslavs, and I do not care what form of state, but it must be free from Austria.\\" The assassination of Franz Ferdinand however triggered resentment amongst those Austro-Hungarian Croats and Slovenes who had favoured being within Austria-Hungary. In response to the outbreak of the war a number of Croats and diaspora Serbs supported Croat-Serb cooperation against Austria-Hungary with the desire of creating a federation based on cooperation between them. Serbs in Serbia on the other hand preferred either a Greater Serbia or a centralized Yugoslavia that would in effect create a Greater Serbia within it. The leadership of the Croatian Peasant and social democratic parties in Croatia and Slovenia generally supported a federal Yugoslav state that would recognize the equality of the Serb, Croat and Slovene nations as distinct and separate tribal sub-nations of the Yugoslav nation. As the Serbian military made advances against Austria- Hungary in the early months of the war, Serbian Prime Minister Nikola Pa≈°iƒá requested support from the Serbian parliament to support the Serbian government's official war aims that declared that Serbia would support the liberation of the Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes under Austro-Hungarian rule. Pa≈°iƒá supported the creation of the Yugoslav Committee to be composed of South Slav √©migr√©s from Austria-Hungary. The Yugoslav Committee was led by Yugoslavist Ante Trumbiƒá and initially composed of twelve Croats (including eight from Dalmatia and two from Croatia proper), three Serbs, and one Slovene. The Yugoslav Committee lobbied the Allies to support the liberation of the South Slav peoples of Austria-Hungary. Pa≈°iƒá was dismayed with the discovery that the Allies had promised to give Italy a substantial portion of Dalmatia and believed that the Committee should attempt to convince the Allies that this was unacceptable and an injustice. In 1917, Pa≈°iƒá, representing the Serbian government, and Trumbiƒá, representing the Yugoslav Committee (including twelve Croats, three Serbs, and one Slovene) signed the Corfu Declaration on the Greek island of Corfu that declared the intention to create a Yugoslav state to be known as the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes that was to be headed by a \\"constitutional, democratic, and parliamentary monarchy\\" headed by the Serbian ruling dynasty, the House of Karaƒëorƒëeviƒá. Proclamation of the State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs on Congress Square in Ljubljana, October 29, 1918 At the end of World War I, the National Council of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs was formed in Zagreb. Shortly thereafter, on 1 December 1918, Prince Regent Alexander of Serbia proclaimed the existence of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes which was recognized by Belgrade and the National Council in Zagreb on the 28th and 29 December. Kingdom of Yugoslavia Vladimir Dvornikoviƒá, a famous philosopher, advocated the establishment of a Yugoslav ethnicity in his 1939 book entitled \\"The Characterology of the Yugoslavs\\". His views included eugenics and cultural blending to create one, strong Yugoslav nation. He did not dismiss the differences among people that inhabited Yugoslavia, but stressed that these differences were \\"contingent and temporary and that they mask a deeper and more profound racial unity\\". He also believed that \\"the primary ability of Yugoslavs is their ability to sacrifice themselves for a higher goal\\". Dvornikoviƒá also advocated the idea of a Dinaric race, and his book overall gives a comprehensive description of unitarist Yugoslav mythology. Several nationalist and far-right groups arose in support of Yugoslavism, such as the Yugoslav Radical Union, ORJUNA and Yugoslav National Movement. SFR Yugoslavia During the Titoist era, a Yugoslav socialist patriotism was advocated by the Yugoslav government.Sabrina P. Ramet. Social currents in Eastern Europe: the sources and consequences of the great transformation. Duke University Press, 1995. Pp. 207.Teresa Rakowska-Harmstone. Communism in Eastern Europe. Indiana University Press, 1984. Manchester, England, UK: Manchester University Press ND, 1984. p. 267. It stressed that this socialist patriotism was not related to nationalism. The League of Communists of Yugoslavia denounced nationalism, declaring that \\"every nationalism is dangerous\\". Yugoslav leader Josip Broz Tito sought to form a communist community of \\"new people\\" of socialist Yugoslavia, based on the concept of Brotherhood and Unity - the \\"brotherhood\\" referring to the community of nations living in the socialist Yugoslavia while the \\"unity\\" referred to the unity of the working class. The basis of this socialist patriotism was the armed struggle by the Yugoslav Partisans against the Axis Powers who occupied and partitioned Yugoslavia during World War II.William Joseph Buckley. Kosovo: contending voices on Balkan interventions. William B. Eerdmans Pub., 2000. p. 144. The League of Communists claimed that the different nations of Yugoslavia had united in a common struggle against the Axis during the war and thus had legitimized the future unity of multi-ethnic Yugoslavia. This was broadly correct for some parts of Yugoslavia, but during the war there had been significant cooperation with the Axis powers in Croatia, which the Axis had established as a puppet state allied to Italy and Germany. Yugoslav nation In the early days of Yugoslavia, influential intellectuals Jovan Cvijiƒá and Vladimir Dvornikoviƒá advocated the Yugoslavs as a Yugoslav supra-ethnic nation that had tribal ethnicities, such as Croats, Serbs, and others within it. Identity politics failed to assimilate the South Slavic peoples of Yugoslavia into a Yugoslav identity. During the reign of King Aleksandar I, a modern single Yugoslav identity was unsuccessfully propagated to erase the particularistic identities.

Los Oficiales was originally created in AAA. Los Oficiales Version 1 The original Los Oficiales group was a concept created by AAA owner Antonio Pe√±a that was unveiled in 1996. Los Oficiales initially consisted of Guardia, Oficial and Vigilante, three wrestlers dressed as motorcycle police, complete with nightsticks and motorcycle helmets that the trio used to cheat during matches. The characters were very clearly inspired by the World Wrestling Federation character \\"The Big Boss Man\\", played by Ray Traylor (at time, Traylor was competing in WCW with his own name and wouldn't have resumed the Bossman identity until 1998). On November 19, 1996 they defeated Los Villanos (Villano III, Villano IV and Villano V) to win the AAA Americas Trios Championship. Los Oficiales held the title until some point in early 1997 when Los Villanos regained the titles. Not long after the loss the trio was expanded with Maniac Cop, the first enmascarado Oficial, patterned after the Maniac Cop Movie. The trio of Maniac Cop, Oficial and Vigilante won the Distrito Federal Trios Championship, although no documentation of who they defeated to win the title has been found. At some point between 1997 and 1998 Los Oficiales left AAa and began working for the local promotion in Naucalpan, State of Mexico that would later evolve into International Wrestling Revolution Group (IWRG). In Naucalpan Maniac Cop turned on his partners, to form a group called La Escuadron De La Muerte (\\"The Death squad\\"), who also used \\"Police officer\\" ring personas. The feud between the two groups lasted until 1999 when La Escuadron slowly began to fade away from the IWRG. Los Oficiales Version 2 After the feud with La Escuadron de la Muerte ended Los Oficiales regrouped and added the younger Cyborg to the group. Between 2000 and 2001 Guardia, Oficial and Vigilante held the Distrito Federal twice more. Later on Guardia, Oficial and Cyborg would go on to win the Distrito Federal Trios title as well. By 2005 the three veteran Oficiales, Guardia, Oficial and Vigilante reduced their roles in the group, allowing Cyborg to lead a new group of Oficiales. Los Oficiales Version 3 Cyborg gathered a group consisting of himself, Polizon and Xibalba. Polizon was a gimmick taken for some time by the wrestler later known as Pierroth II while Xibalba had worked for IWRG under that name for many years before becoming part of the group. The third version of Los Oficiales was the least active as the three rarely teamed in the year or so it existed and never won any championships. Los Oficiales Version 4 In 2006 Cyborg reformed Los Oficiales once again with himself, Magnum Project and AK-47. AK-47 had formerly worked as Bombero Infernal and only wrestled as AK-47 for a matter of months before moving on to a new character called \\"Kraneo\\" (\\"Skull\\"). Oficiales V4 never won a title, although Cyborg and AK-47 (billed as Kranero) teamed up with Xibalba to win the IWRG Intercontinental Trios Championship ‚Äì while they were never billed as \\"Los Oficiales\\" the team was a mix of V3 and V4. Los Oficiales Version 5 In the spring of 2007 IWRG officials decided to form a new version of Los Oficiales, selecting three IWRG regulars to be repackaged as the masked Oficial 911, Oficial AK-47 and Oficial Fierro. The team was unveiled at a Lucha Libre festival in May, 2007 and immediately began working in the Trios division. On July 7, 2007 the trio defeated the Japanese trio of Kai, Sasaki and Yamato to win the Distrito Federal Trios Championship, a title that had been relatively inactive up for at least a year before Los Oficiales won the belts. Often IWRG introduces a new \\"concept\\" Trio that fades away after a few months, but this version Los Oficiales sustained their success by repeatedly defending the Trios title against such teams as the tecnico team of Freelance, Kid Tiger and Star Boy, former Oficiales Capitan Muerte, Cyborg and Xibalba and rudos Los Payasos (Coco Verde, Cocochips, Cocolores), successfully taking on all comers, regardless of them being tecnicos or rudos. Los Oficiales would go on to defend the Trios title nine times all together, giving credibility to both the Trios championship and to Los Oficiales as a group. On September 28, 2008 Los Oficiales became double champions as they defeated Cyborg, Kraneo, Xibalva (who had all been members of previous incarnations of Los Oficiales under various names) to win the IWRG Intercontinental Trios Championship. Los Oficiales run as double Trio champions ended on December 7, 2008 when Los Terrible Cerebros (Black Terry, Dr. Cerebro and Cerebro Negro). After the loss of the Distrito Federal Trios title the team focused on the IWRG Trios title and establishing their dominance in the IWRG Trios division. Los Oficiales would go on to have a series of successful title defenses against Black Terry, Cerebro Negro and Dr. Cerebro as well as Zatura, Pendulo, Multifac√©tico and the rudo team of Arlequin, Hijo de Pierroth and Pierroth II. Their success in 2008 led to several Mexican publications naming Los Oficiales as the best Trio, or runner up for best Trios team for 2008. Throughout 2009 Los Oficiales has been involved in several feuds, especially a very bloody feud with Los Traumas (Trauma I and Trauma II) and Negro Navarro (their father). As well as the father son team of Pirata Morgan, El Hijo de Pirata Morgan and Barba Roja, who have all unsuccessfully challenged Los Oficiales for the Trios title. Los Oficiales continued to defend the IWRG Trios title through 2009 and into 2010 where they as of April 21, 2010 are still the champions, having made at least 9 successful defenses of the title, more than any previous title holder. Their success has also seen them named as the best version of Los Oficiales by far. On March 3, 2011, Los Oficiales lost the IWRG Intercontinental Trios Championship to Joe L√≠der, Silver King and √öltimo Gladiador, ending their reign at 886 days. On July 17 the group was joined by Oficial Spartan. On October 9, after costing Los Oficiales a match via disqualification, 911 and Fierro turned on Spartans and kicked him out of the group. Los Oficiales then began feuding with Spartans and the debuting Oficial Rayan, who named their new group Los Oficiales Elite. On December 22, Oficial AK-47 teamed with Trauma I to face Oficial 911 and Trauma II in a Relevos Suicidas match and after losing the match, AK-47 and Trauma I were forced to face each other in a Mask vs. Mask match. Eventually, Trauma I won the match via disqualification, forcing AK-47 to unmask himself. On November 1 at Castillo del Terror, another Oficial, Fierro, lost his mask in a twelve-man steel cage match. On February 7, 2013, Los Oficiales lost the Distrito Federal Trios Championship to El Hijo de Pirata Morgan, Pirata Morgan and Pirata Morgan, Jr. On December 19, Oficial 911 was also forced to unmask, when he and Mosco X-Fly were defeated by Golden Magic and El Hijo de Pirata Morgan in a three-way tag team Lucha de Apuestas. On June 15, 2014, 911 and AK-47 defeated Apolo Estrada, Jr. and El Hijo del Diablo to win the IWRG Intercontinental Tag Team Championship.

Salina and Lianda were born in Amsterdam, the Netherlands, and Haben was born in Seattle, United States. Their parents are from Eritrea, and their father Mulugheta Abraham was a musician back home. The sisters were raised with music as an integral part of their life. After few years of singing at home for family members, they posted their songs on YouTube. Soon, the first invitation to perform in public was received. The youngest Haben was invited to sing at an event at Disney World in Orlando (25th anniversary of Children Miracle Network). Soon after, the youngest sister appeared on Maury Povich TV show as one of the six America's most Talented kids. That is when the sisters decided to take music seriously. Professional career The EriAm Sisters became known after their appearance on America's Got Talent 2009. There, they sang the Jackson 5's song \\"I Want You Back\\" which aired just a day before he died. The sisters were seen as the next Destiny's Child by the judges of America Got Talent. Specifically Piers Morgan was very pleased and told the girls \\"You are the future\\". He said this after the girls performed the song \\"Crazy in Love\\" by Beyonc√©. Although their name was known mainly because of America's Got Talent, the girls were performing for years together. Some of the songs they recorded are when Haben was only 8 years old.Reverbnation site Awards * In 2009, the Seattle Theater Group featured the girls as the best young artists of 2009. * After becoming semifinalists on Americas Got Talent, Mayor Denis Law handed the girls a key to the city and declared September 21st to be the EriAm Sisters Day in Renton, Washington for their extraordinary contribution to music at such a young age. They are also admired for their contribution to support many local charity organizations. * In 2010, the sisters received a music award from the King county executives for Excellence in Music\\".

On May 24, 2011, they flew to Eritrea to perform at the 20th anniversary of the country's independence. The girls are believed to work with multi-platinum producer Andrew Lane and DJ Steve Freestyle who is the official DJ of Timbaland. They released a couple original songs, including \\"BFF\\" and \\"Diary\\". The song \\"Diary\\" is written by the then 12-year-old member (Haben Abraham) and made it to number one on Hot Radio 105.7 for 5 weeks. The song apparently was not formally released but leaked to radio stations. Without any promotional effort the song couldn't keep the momentum and dropped off the radio chart after 9 weeks. They also wrote a song called \\"No More\\" about sisterhood love which was widely seen as an indication of the love the girls have for each other. The youngest Haben has posted many of her original work, including music production on their YouTube account.

Since 1968, the act has been extensively amended. Following the Hungerford massacre, the Firearms (Amendment) Act 1988 extended the class of prohibited weapons. Following the Dunblane school massacre, two acts were passed, the Firearms (Amendment) Act 1997 and, after the general election that year, the Firearms (Amendment) (No. 2) Act 1997, which in effect banned almost all handguns. The Policing and Crime Act 2017 brought clarity to aspects of the act, following a recommendation from the Law Commission.  Prohibited Firearms and Ammunition  Section five of Part One of the Act states that a prohibited firearm is one which;https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1968/27/section/5 *Fires more than one ammunition when the trigger is pressed Remington 11-87 shotgun *Is a self- loading or pump-action rifled gun except when chambered for .22 rim-fire cartridges; *Has a barrel less than 30 centimetres in length or is less than 60 centimetres in length overall, except air weapons, muzzle-loading gun or signalling firearms *Is a self-loading or pump-action smooth-bore gun which is not an air weapon or chambered for .22 rim-fire cartridges and has a barrel less than 24 inches in length or less than 40 inches in length overall *Is a smooth-bore revolver gun except chambered for 9mm. rim-fire cartridges or a muzzle-loading gun *Is a rocket launcher or mortar except when designed for line-throwing, pyrotechnic purposes, or for signalling Flare guns are legal in the UK *Air firearm which uses a self-contained gas cartridge system, i.e. the Brocock system of pump-up cartridges, each with their own pellet, but not a CO2 bulb system. *Weapon of whatever description designed or adapted for the discharge of any noxious liquid, gas or other For ammunition it is prohibited if it;https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1968/27/section/5 *Are designed to explode on or immediately before impact *Contain any such noxious item *Consists of a missile Prohibited firearms and ammunition may only be possessed, purchased, sold, gifted or manufactured with authority from the government; as enacted this was from the Defence Council, as of 2020 this is from the Secretary of State.

U.S. farms have almost doubled their average energy efficiency over the past 25 years. Usage Energy costs represent between 2% (at cattle feed lots) and 9% (for grain farming, due partly to grain drying) of farm production costs. =Use on dairy farms= In 2006 there were about 65,000 dairy farms in the United States, although most had fewer than 200 cows.Dairy Farms & the Environment Fact Sheet One \\"resource auditor\\" believes it is possible for dairy farms to reach an energy usage of as low as 200 kWhr per cow per year although an analysis of California dairy farms found that 300 kWhr/year was the lowest actually attained.Dairy Farm Energy Management Guide One studyDAIRY FARM ENERGY AUDIT SUMMARY found the following electrical usages on New York dairy farms: *Milk cooling ‚Äì 23% *Ventilation ‚Äì 21% *Vacuum pumps ‚Äì 18% *Lighting ‚Äì 17% *Electrical water heating ‚Äì 10% *Feeding equipment ‚Äì 7% Another study found highly similar results. Regulations Hitherto almost entirely unregulated (except for zoning ordinances and the effects of property taxes), environmental concerns are now beginning to impose restrictions on farms. How renewable energy projects may be implemented and also on what rate of return electricity producers can obtain from utilities are key current topics. Acts such as Wisconsin's Clean Energy Jobs Act (only proposed as of April, 2010) are controversial among farmers for these reasons. Canada's Green Energy Act 2009 implemented similar kinds of regulations. Contrarily, Carbon offsets may soon offer farmers additional incentives to increase energy use efficiency. However, at least one proposed cap and trade process would raise farmers' costs by up to $1.19 (USD) per acre. Corporate Average Fuel Economy Fuel standards too (such as in the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007) are controversial, as biofuels are now a significant portion of farm income. Efficiency increases Increased efficiency in farm usage of electricity is being driven by Greening as well as by economics. \\"The biggest users of electrical power are heat, light and motors. ... A recent study found that a 3-hp energy efficient compressor used over 42 percent fewer kilowatt- hours (kWhr) than a 3-hp conventional compressor.\\" Two prime areas for efficiency improvements are implementing the use of heat recovery systems and Variable Speed Drives.Options to reduce your electricity usage One organization postulated a three-year plan for farms to use energy better. =Crop rotation= Simply including years of either clover or alfalfa into the cycle of grain crops can yield savings without reducing total crop yields.Reducing Fossil Energy Use on the Farm =Farm energy audits= Farms sometimes use accredited \\"resource auditors\\" to analyze their operations and recommend improved efficiencies, typically at costs exceeding $1,000 per audit. However, typical full repayment of an audit's cost could be around six years.Farm Energy Audit Program (FEAP) Also, a Certified Farm Energy Audit may be required for participation in state or federal energy efficiency programs. An audit of 20 farms in Cumbria showed savings could be made in all areas examined. An example of a farm energy audit in Maine is at the following reference.Broad Acres Farm Energy Audit Maryland has a statewide program entitled EnSave. =Energy calculators= Recently a number of \\"energy calculators\\" have become available, addressing one or more aspects of farm energy usage. New calculators are being developed under government and utility grants, such as one in Oregon. =Dairy farm efficiency improvements= Some improvements are specific to dairy farms, such as using supplemental lighting with energy efficient lamps (which can increase milk production 5 to 16 percent) or relieving heat stress with a combination of sprinklers and fans to increase the cooling effect and improve energy use.Strategies for Energy Use on the Dairy Farm California compiled a \\"Complete Guide\\" to dairy farm efficiency improvements. =Cow manure to electrical generation= Norswiss Farms of Rice Lake, Wisconsin, an 1100 cow dairy farm, expects to save over $70,000 per year (plus income from electricity sales) from its installation of an 848 kW Combined Heat and Power (CHP) system operating on anaerobic digesters gas from cow manure.Norswiss Farms 848 kw CHP Application The electricity generated is sold to the grid. A similar installation in 2004 on a 270 cow farm in California (one of five in the state at that time) powered a 75 kW generator. Central Vermont Public Service has a \\"Cow Power\\" program using methane-fueled electricity from Vermont farms. =Government and utility incentives= U.S. utilities allocated $5.3 billion to energy efficiency programs in 2009. Government and utility incentives can be beneficial to those entities as well. \\"It may be less expensive for governments to encourage efficiency and renewable energy options [in order to] delay or negate the need to upgrade and modernize rural grid infrastructure.\\" A partial list of incentives is available at the following reference: A link to relevant utility pages is at:Utility Energy Efficiency Programs For Small & Large Businesses A third partial list is at: Alliant Energy in Wisconsin funds the installation of energy-saving projects, receiving payments on the monthly electric bills.

This rebellion, which closely followed the Yellow Turban Rebellion, was part of a series of disturbances that led to the decline and ultimate downfall of the Han dynasty.Haloun, p. 119 Despite receiving relatively little attention in the hands of traditional historians, the rebellion nonetheless had lasting importance as it removed Han Chinese power in the northwest and prepared that land for a number of non-Han- Chinese states in the centuries to come.de Crespigny (1984), p. 146 Outbreak (184) The rebellion began in the winter of 184 with two groups of Qiang people causing disturbances in the outlying regions of northwestern China, with one group in the northwestern commanderies of Beidi () and Anding, and another in at the counties of Fuhan () and Heguan () in the upper Yellow River valley. Initially, the two groups were likely separate, each trying to seize the opportunity to resist the weakened Han rule after years of corruption and misrule.Haloun, p. 120de Crespigny (1984), p. 147 The situation escalated in October or November 184 when the troops of the Auxiliary of Loyal Barbarians From Huangzhong (), which consisted of Qiang and Lesser Yuezhi recruits sent to suppress the disturbances, mutinied against their Han Chinese superiors in the military camp of Lianju (‰ª§Â±Ö;Following the pronunciation specified by Meng Kang's commentary to the Book of Han. See note 14 of de Crespigny (1984), p. 471. northwest of present-day Lanzhou) and joined the insurgents, killing the Colonel Protector of the Qiang (), Ling Zheng (), in the process. At this point, the two groups had joined together, with former Auxiliary soldiers Beigong Boyu () and Li Wenhou () as their leaders. This union meant that the rebels now had control of the band of territory along the Yellow River in present-day Lanzhou. Within a few weeks, the rebels attacked and captured Yuanya (ÂÖÅÂêæFollowing the pronunciation specified by Ying Shao's commentary to the Book of the Later Han. See note 37 of de Crespigny (1984), p. 474. The modern pronunciation of the same characters would be \\"Yunwu\\".), the capital of Jincheng Commandery (), making the commandery their main stronghold for rebel operations. The rebels were helped by the fact that the local governor Zuo Chang (), Inspector of Liang Province (), had embezzled the funds allocated for the defence force, making no relief possible.de Crespigny (1984), p. 149 The Grand Administrator Chen Yi () went to the rebels' camp to negotiate for the release of hostages, but the rebels killed him. The hostages ‚Äì which included Bian Zhang, the former Prefect of Xin'an (); and Han Sui, Attendant Official of Liang Province () ‚Äì were then persuaded to join the rebels' cause. The addition of such reputable and influential men gave the rebellion wider popular support, and the two men were to play more prominent roles in the rebellion as the course of events progressed. The rebels then besieged Zuo Chang's headquarters in the county of Ji (ÂÜÄ; south of present-day Gangu, Gansu). Some outlying Han generals were initially reluctant to help Zuo Chang, but He Xun (), a much-respected and successful general, forced those generals to come to Zuo Chang's aid with powerful persuasion. The rebels, out of respect for He Xun, broke off the siege.de Crespigny (1989), Zhongping 1: 1874 After this episode, Zuo Chang was replaced by Song Nie (), a devout Confucian who believed that the situation could be remedied only by teaching the people the Classic of Filial Piety. He submitted this proposal to the imperial court despite his junior officials' advice and was promptly dismissed in favour of Yang Yong (). Local situations did not improve with the appointment, however, and the local officials soon found themselves besieged by the rebels again. The new Protector Xia Yu (), a man with some experience with Qiang rebellions, was attacked by a rebel contingent led by Qiang chieftain Dianyu ()de Crespigny (1984), p. 160. For the pronunciation of this name, see de Crespigny (1984), p. 476 note 2. at the Herding Office () of Hanyang Commandery (present-day Tianshui) and He Xun once again led troops for relief. This time, however, He Xun was severely defeated at nearby Hupan (). While both Xia Yu and He Xun made their escape, it was clear at this point that provincial authorities could not deal with the rebellion by themselves.Haloun, p. 121 Response of the central government (185) In the spring of 185, the rebels, now several tens of thousands in number, moved towards the former Han capital of Chang'an. In response, the imperial court appointed Huangfu Song, the famed conqueror of the Yellow Turbans, as the General of Chariots and Cavalry on the Left () in charge of defense of Chang'an. However, Huangfu achieved no immediate success, and was dismissed in the seventh lunar month of 185 after a four-month tenure after being slandered by the eunuchs in the imperial court.de Crespigny (1989), Zhongping 2: M The continued rebellion in Liang Province took its toll on the government treasury, and the imperial court had to call on the taxes and corv√©es to support the war. A high official, the Excellency over the Masses, Cui Lie (), proposed to abandon Liang Province altogether. The Gentleman-Consultant () Fu Xie () made an impassioned speech that condemned Cui Lie and emphasised on the importance of the frontier province: Emperor Ling was impressed by this argument and rejected Cui Lie's proposal. Fu Xie was later assigned to be the Grand Administrator of Hanyang () and was sent to the frontier region. In the eighth lunar month of 185, the high minister Zhang Wen was given the military post of General of Chariots and Cavalry () to assume Huangfu Song's responsibilities. Assigned under him were Dong Zhuo, the new General Who Routs the Caitiffs (); and Zhou Shen (), the General Who Terrifies Criminals (), among others. Zhang's army, more than a hundred thousand in men and horses, traveled to Meiyang (ÁæéÈôΩ; west of present- day Wugong) and set camp there. Bian Zhang and Han Sui also brought their men to Meiyang to do battle, but the battles were inconclusive and Zhang Wen's army could not gain advantage for some time. Things changed during the eleventh month, when a shooting star appeared to fall on the rebel camp and shook the rebels' resolve. Taking advantage of the situation, Dong Zhuo smashed the rebel army in a sudden attack, forcing Bian Zhang and Han Sui to retreat west to Yuzhong (Ê¶Ü‰∏≠; near present-day Lanzhou) of Jincheng commandery. Following the victory, Zhang Wen sent two detachments in pursuit of the rebels: Zhou Shen was to lead 30,000 men to attack Yuzhong, and Dong Zhuo was to chase the Qiang auxiliary with another 30,000 men. Both, however, ended in failure. Zhou Shen had disregarded his advisor Sun Jian's advice to cut the enemy's supply routes and got his own supply line cut by the enemy in turn, resulting in a hasty retreat. Dong Zhuo's position became surrounded by the Qiang in Wangyuan (ÊúõÂû£; northwest of present-day Tianshui) with depleting supplies. He made his escape by damming up the river as if to catch fish and secretly transported his men across the river. By the time the Qiang came in pursuit, the dammed river was too deep for them to cross. Dong Zhuo was the only commander to keep his forces intact after this offensive.de Crespigny (1989), Zhongping 2: note 27 Although the Battle of Meiyang halted the rebels' advance into the Han heartlands, the rebels were able to retain their power by the upper Yellow River due to the failure of the Han follow-up offensive. The upper Wei River valley became contested ground.de Crespigny (1984), p. 151 Local attempts at restoring Chinese power (186‚Äì187) At some time during the winter of 186, the rebel leader Bian Zhang died of illness and Beigong Boyu and Li Wenhou were killed in internecine feuds.Although some volumes of the Book of the Later Han say Han Sui killed all three of them, there are suspicions that these records were oversimplified and excessively condensed. See Haloun, p. 121 note 19. Seeing an advantage to be gained from this situation, Geng Bi (), the newly installed Inspector of Liang Province, attempted to re-establish Han-Chinese power in the region without major military assistance from other parts of the country.de Crespigny (1984), p. 152 Fu Xie tried to dissuade Geng Bi from this enterprise, arguing that the people were not used to Geng Bi as their governor and the army did not have time to build morale, but Geng Bi went ahead with his plan anyway. In 187, Geng Bi attacked the western fringe commandery Longxi with a combined army from six commanderies. Longxi was previously captured by the forces of Han Sui when its Grand Administrator Li Can () defected. However, the gentry and people were frustrated by Geng Bi's appointment of the corrupt official Cheng Qiu (). When the army reached Longxi's capital Didao in the fourth month of 187, mutiny broke out within Geng Bi's ranks, killing Cheng Qiu and Geng successively. The mutineers joined the rebels under the command of the Didao native Wang Guo (), and together they besieged Hanyang, east of Longxi.Haloun, p. 122 As Grand Administrator of Hanyang, Fu Xie treated the people well and was respected far and wide, and the rebels were hesitant to fight him. On several occasions, the rebels tried to convince Fu Xie to either flee the city or surrender, but Fu was determined to defend the commandery to the death despite dwindling number of men and supplies. And so, in a desperate final charge, Fu died in battle.de Crespigny (1989), Zhongping 4: C, 1885 After this affair, Geng Bi's subordinate, Major () Ma Teng brought his troops to join Han Sui. They made Wang Guo their leader, and together the rebels raided the region around Chang'an.de Crespigny (1989), Zhongping 4: D For the first time, the rebels extended their sway over the entire Liang Province. In light of this, Zhang Wen was dismissed from his post for his failure to quell the rebellion.de Crespigny (1989), Zhongping 4: E The siege of Chencang (188‚Äì189) By the end of 188, the imperial court had all but abandoned hope of recovering Liang Province and, for the most part, left the regional defences to their own devices.de Crespigny (1984), p. 153 However, when Wang Guo led a major force east to attack Chencang (Èô≥ÂÄâ, east of present-day Baoji), a gateway to Chang'an, the court once again appointed Huangfu Song to answer this obvious threat. Huangfu, now General of the Left (), was given 20,000 men; Dong Zhuo, himself commanding another 20,000 men, were to assist Huangfu. When Huangfu and Dong reached Chencang, Dong urged Huangfu to relief the siege immediately. Huangfu, however, had a different opinion ‚Äì he argued that Chencang's strong defences would not be easily captured and they would only need to wait for Wang Guo's men to become discouraged. Sure enough, Wang Guo's men laid siege to Chencang for more than eighty days with no success.de Crespigny (1989), Zhongping 5: Q In spring 189, Wang Guo's men became worn out and abandoned the siege. With his men rested, Huangfu Song ordered his men to give chase. Dong Zhuo protested, citing the rule of warfare that a retreating army is not to be pursued (lest the enemy retaliates in desperation).de Crespigny (1989), Zhongping 6: A Huangfu dismissed the protest, saying Wang Guo's retreat was not an organised retreat but a result of losing all will to fight. Huangfu led his men to attack, leaving Dong Zhuo behind as rearguard, and achieved a great victory, cutting off more than ten thousand heads. Dong Zhuo was said to be ashamed and angry at this and bore a grudge against Huangfu from here on.de Crespigny (1989), Zhongping 6: 1893 Wang Guo was subsequently deposed by Han Sui and Ma Teng after his defeat in Chencang, and a Yan Zhong (), former Prefect of Xindu (), was elected to take his place as the leader of the Liang Province rebels. However, Yan Zhong died soon after, leaving the rebels to fight amongst themselves and finally splintered into three groups: Han Sui's group in Jincheng, Ma Teng's group in the Wei Valley, and Song Jian's () group in Fuhan (in present-day Gansu). As power shifted from the barbarian initiators to the local Han rebels, the Qiang and the Yuezhi seemed to have quietly withdrew their support and played no further role of note in the rebellion.de Crespigny (1984), p. 162 The rebellion could have been suppressed at this point if not for the events of 189 in the capital Luoyang.Haloun, p. 123 Following the death of Emperor Ling on May 13, 189,de Crespigny (1984), p. 155 full-scale fighting broke out after the assassination of the General-in-Chief He Jin. Dong Zhuo led the frontier men to the capital in the chaos and took control of the court, replaced Emperor Shao with Emperor Xian, and made himself Chancellor of State (). By the end of the year, civil insurrection had spread across China and the Liang Province Rebellion became subsumed as an outlying disturbance in the fragmentation of the Han dynasty. Epilogue: the final destruction of the rebels As China disintegrated into chaos, the three rebel leaders of Liang Province became warlords in their own right and took different approaches to adapt to the new geopolitical situation. Song Jian, distancing himself from the conflict in China, proclaimed himself to be King of the Sources of the River Who Will Pacify Han () and ruled the region of Fuhan and Heguan in isolated autonomy for almost thirty years. On the other hand, Han Sui and Ma Teng became involved in the wider affairs of the empire, starting with their reconciliation with Dong Zhuo, who asked for their support to deal with the coalition against him.de Crespigny (1996), Chuping 3: DD After Dong Zhuo died in 192, his retainers Li Jue and Guo Si seized power and gave Han Sui and Ma Teng the positions of General Who Maintains the West in Peace () and General Who Subdues the West (), respectively; thereby granting the two rebel leaders official recognition.Haloun, p. 124 Later on, Han Sui and Ma Teng shared an uneasy relationship with each other; between them were periods of alliance followed by periods of open warfare. In one occasion in 209, Ma Teng was compelled to flee to seek help from Cao Cao, the powerful warlord who had gained control of northeast China and the imperial court. At the time, Cao Cao had his interests in the northwest, and thus invited Ma Teng to his headquarters in Ye and kept him as a virtual hostage.de Crespigny (1984), p. 163 Ma Teng was executed along with his family in Ye when his son Ma Chao rose up against Cao Cao two years later. In the spring of 211, Cao Cao sent the commander Zhong Yao to the Wei Valley, ostensibly to attack Zhang Lu's theocratic state of Hanzhong. The incursion provoked the northwestern warlords, including Han Sui and Ma Teng's son Ma Chao, into forming a coalition to resist Cao Cao. The coalition opposed Cao's forces in the Battle of Tong Pass, where Cao personally took charge of operations. With skilful manoeuvring, Cao's army crept to the rear of the coalition forces and routed them in a decisive encounter in the autumn of 211. The defeat at Tong Pass signalled the beginning of the end of autonomy in the northwest.Haloun, p. 127 Cao Cao returned east after this engagement, leaving his lieutenant Xiahou Yuan in charge of mop up operations and Zhang Ji in charge of restoration of local government.de Crespigny (1984), p. 165 Ma Chao first attempted to stage a resistance after capturing the city of Ji in Cao Cao's absence, establishing bonds with the Di people, but was ousted in 213 with a combination of Xiahou Yuan's army and internal mutiny. Ma Chao fled south to Zhang Lu, and later to the southwestern warlord Liu Bei in Sichuan, where he died in 221 without ever seeing the north again.Haloun, p. 128 In 214, Xiahou Yuan defeated the resistance led by Han Sui at the Changli River (Èï∑Èõ¢Ê∞¥; present-day Hulu River, north of Tianshui), and followed up that victory by an expedition against the Di and Song Jian. Song Jian died, his capital of Fuhan was captured, and his officials were all killed by Xiahou. Han Sui died the next year, and his remaining subordinates sent his head to Cao Cao as a sign of submission. And so, the power blocs that were generated by the Liang Province Rebellion some thirty years prior were finally eliminated. Legacy After Cao Cao's death in 220, his son Cao Pi forced Emperor Xian to abdicate and established the state of Cao Wei to succeed the Han dynasty. Under his rule, commanderies were restored across the northwest while the region suffered only minor outbreaks of local rebellions. In 222, trade with Central Asia was officially re-established after being disrupted by the string of military action in Liang Province.de Crespigny (1984), p. 166 Despite these achievements, Chinese power in the northwest was weaker than during the Han dynasty before the rebellion. Compared to the Han dynasty, Cao Wei's territory shrank in the northwest as some outlying former commanderies, such as Song Jian's realm of Fuhan, were simply abandoned. Chinese population in the area dwindled and eventually gave way to the Qiang and Di tribes of the southern mountains.de Crespigny (1984), p. 167 ‚Äì 168 A little over a century were to pass after the Liang Province Rebellion before these peoples, along with other nomadic groups of northern China, overthrew their Chinese overlords and established barbarian states in northern China. In popular culture The Liang Province Rebellion is featured as playable stages in the seventh instalment of Koei's Dynasty Warriors video game series, and focuses on Sun Jian's involvement in aiding Dong Zhuo on behalf of the Han imperial court. The Liang Province Rebellion also appears in Total War: Three Kingdoms, roughly at the same time as with the Yellow Turban Rebellion. Its faction is led by Beigong Boyu.

In 2009 Stephen was named as a spokesman for the United States Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Research and Development. The VA and Cochran collaborated to produce a music video for veterans who need help. History and music career Stephen Cochran was primarily raised by his single mother Janey Cochran, however when Cochran was four years old, he began spending summers with his grandparents Charles and Lois Maynard in Waterford, Michigan. Some of Stephens closest friends are from that time in his life and considers Michigan just as much a hometown as Kentucky and Tennessee. After moving from Eastern, Kentucky to Tennessee he was raised in Nashville's songwriting and recording community. He watched his father, Steve Cochran, wrestle with the machinery of Music Row as a struggling songwriter and artist. Country greats Bobby Bare and the late Del Reeves are just a few of the characters that influenced Cochran's early music home life. Cochran cultivated an interest in music beginning at Hunters Lane Comprehensive High School in Nashville, Tennessee. Later, he honed his craft in his college days at Western Kentucky University with a development deal. He worked his way through school writing songs and playing guitar. While at WKU he also played lacrosse. After September 2001 he joined the United States Marine Corps and served his country as a Marine in Iraq and Afghanistan. He was a part of the 2nd Light Armored Reconnaissance Battalion; 1st Marine Expeditionary Force. While on convoy security Cochran was injured, leaving his back broken and without the use of his legs for some time. Stephen was told he may never walk without pain again and he was sent home to the United States. Once he arrived home the search for a solution began. Finally, after a long struggle, Cochran's ability to walk without pain was restored when doctors at the Nashville VA Medical Center performed an experimental procedure called kyphoplasty. After an extensive rehabilitation Stephen was able to return to an active lifestyle. As part of his recovery, Cochran refocused his energy on country music. He teamed up with other country music artists and began performing with John Rich and the MuzikMafia around Nashville. He wrote with his friend from the band Trailer Choir Vinny Hickerson and eventually, they started their own writers' group. In 2007 he began Armed Forces Entertainment tours of the Middle East, scores of benefit appearances on behalf of his fellow veterans, and constant roadwork in support of his acclaimed, self-titled debut album. In November 2008 Cochran appeared on ABC's Good Morning America to promote the second annual \\"Salute to the Troops\\" benefit concert. In 2009 the VA asked Stephen to be the face of their research and development. Cochran and Mark Melloan wrote \\"Hope,\\" which the VA used as a theme song in its national campaign to help veterans. The VA hospitals and patients are the backdrops for the video. In 2012, Cochran signed a production contract with New Voice Entertainment. 2013 ,Stephen formed the live-music group titled \\"Stephen Cochran Project\\" including bandmate \\"Smitty\\" Byrne (BGV/Bass)// The Stephen Cochran Project released their first self-titled album in 2015. In 2014 Stephen and fellow Veterans Daniel Dean, Sam Tate, Sal Gonzalez, Jonathon Wells, Wynn Taylor, Micha Howard and Tyler Jay, formed and began touring in support of their not for profit which then linked to Romans Warrior foundation forming Romans Warrior foundation- Stop22Tour. They use their songs and songwriting to help other's understand the Veterans plight as well as the suicide epidemic that plagues the Veteran Community. \\"It also helps our fellow veterans heal through our music\\", said Dean at a concert in 2017 at the Fonanel. Look for their \\"in the round\\" style concerts in several parts of the country and overseas. Stephen teamed up with fellow Veteran and longtime friends Michael Hamilton and Daniel Broadrick to put out a non-genre EP titled \\"American Loser\\", it includes 6 new tracks all written or co-written by Cochran and Hamilton directed at helping other veterans heal and educate civilians about the veteran plight. Cochran, Hamilton and Broderick continue to make music and are hoping to help MANY veterans navigate the songwriting maze in Nashville. Personal Life: Stephen is Married to Megan Rae Cochran, together they have two fur babies Semper Fi is Eleven and CoCo is one. They have five kids,Aaron Ryder, Addy Rae, Stephen Eugene Cochran III(Tripp), Katherine Ann and born August 14th 2020 Charles Caswell (Charlie Caz ) (Caz).

The college traces its origin to three log cabin colleges in Washington County, Pennsylvania established by three Presbyterian missionaries to the American frontier in the 1780s: John McMillan, Thaddeus Dod, and Joseph Smith. These early schools eventually grew into two competing academies and colleges, with Canonsburg Academy, later Jefferson College, located in Canonsburg, Pennsylvania and Washington Academy, later Washington College, in Washington. These two colleges merged in 1865 to form Washington & Jefferson College. The campus, the historic entrances of which are marked by brick gates, has over 40 buildings. The oldest surviving building is McMillan Hall, which dates to 1793 and is the oldest college building west of the Allegheny Mountains. The main academic building is Old Main, which is topped with two prominent towers. The Old Gym houses a modern exercise facility. McIlvaine Hall, which was originally home to a female seminary, was demolished in 2008 and replaced by the Swanson Science Center. The Olin Fine Arts Center is a 488-seat auditorium. Davis Memorial Hall was once a dormitory and private house. The Thistle Physics Building, the Lazear Chemistry Hall, and the Dieter-Porter Life Sciences Building all cater to the scientific curriculum. The Burnett Center and its sister building, the Technology Center, were built in the late 1990s and early 2000s. The first dormitory on campus was Hays Hall. Wade House, Carriage House, and Whitworth House are Victorian homes housing older students. The recently constructed Chestnut Street Housing complex provides housing for the college's Greek organizations. The Presidents' Row is a cluster of ten buildings in the center of campus, several of which are dedicated to theme housing. Two sister dormitories, New Residence Hall and Bica-Ross Hall, feature suite-style living arrangements. Mellon Hall and Upperclass Hall house male freshmen. Other dormitories include Alexander Hall, Beau Hall, Marshall Hall, North Hall, and Penn House. The college administration utilizes several buildings, including the Admissions House, the Alumni House, and the President's House, which are all modified Victorian homes. The U. Grant Miller Library is the modern library; its predecessor, Thompson Hall, is now used for administrative purposes. The Hub, The Commons, and the Rossin Campus Center provide recreational and dining facilities for students. The athletic and intramural teams utilize Cameron Stadium for football and track. The Henry Memorial Center is used for basketball, wrestling, swimming, and volleyball. Other athletic facilities include Brooks Park, Ross Memorial Park and Alexandre Stadium, and the Janet L. Swanson Tennis Courts. Campus The modern campus of Washington & Jefferson College is located in the City of Washington and the East Washington Borough, small- town communities about south of Pittsburgh. The 60-acre (0.24 km2) campus is home to more than 40 academic, administrative, recreational, and residential buildings. The northern edge of campus is bound by East Walnut Street, the western edge by South College Street, the southern edge by East Maiden Street, and the eastern edge by South Wade. Portions of the campus extend into the East Washington Historic District. Four historic gates mark four traditional entrances to campus at East Maiden Street, Wheeling Street, South College Street, and Beau Street. The South College Street gate marks the western entrance to campus, and was built in 1948 by members of the Phi Gamma Delta fraternity, in honor of the 100th anniversary of the fraternity's founding at Jefferson College in 1848. That brick gate opens to a stone path leading to Old Main. The fraternity refurbished the gate in 1998. The reliefs on the southern gate at East Maiden Street, called the Algeo Gateway, show the roots of the college, with one showing John McMillan and his log college, and the other showing Thaddeus Dod and the founding of Washington Academy. In 1947, the Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission installed a historical marker noting the historic importance of the college. Academic buildings =Old Main= Modern-day Old Main during the spring The main academic building on campus is Old Main. It is the predominant building on campus. Its two identical towers, added in 1875, symbolize the union of Washington College and Jefferson College to form Washington & Jefferson College. The towers appear on the college seal, in a stylized version. The college fundraising operation founded \\"The Old Main Society\\" in 1996 to recognize individuals who utilize planned giving. The building's configuration has changed considerably since its construction in 1850, when it became the second building on the campus on Washington Academy. Originally a two-story structure with architecture matching the colonial facade of McMillan Hall, it has since doubled in height, received two towers, and expanded through multiple wing additions. The building currently houses the academic departments of mathematics, history, religious studies, and political science. The office of the College Chaplain, called the \\"Pastor's Study,\\" is on the ground floor and was used as a main setting for the 1993 George A. Romero film, The Dark Half. Room E contains one of the college's computer labs. The campus' Office of Protection Services is headquartered in Old Main. =McIlvaine Hall= Judge John Addson McIlvaine The building later known as McIlvaine Hall was home to the Washington Female Seminary prior to its acquisition by the college in 1940, when the Seminary closed permanently. It was built in 1897 by Pittsburgh-based female architect Elise Mercur Wagner who supervised every facet of its construction. After the college purchased the brick building with a limestone foundation, it was renamed after Judge John Addison McIlvaine, an 1865 graduate of Jefferson College. The John L. Stewart Clock Tower on the northwest corner of the building, named in honor of John L. Stewart, who published of two local newspapers, contained a chime to note the hour. The portico was modeled after the portico of Mount Vernon. The chime room, containing the 26-note Stephen Collins Foster Carillon, was given to the college by the Women's Auxiliary of Allegheny County on Founder's Day in 1937. In the 1980s, the chime system was replaced by a cassette system. The north wing of the building contained a college theater. The tower was topped with a four-faced clock given in memory of David F. McGill, an 1881 alumnus. The building housed classrooms and faculty offices for the Departments of Philosophy, Sociology, and the Environmental Studies Program, as well as some classrooms for English courses. McIlvaine was demolished in summer 2008 to make room for the new Swanson Science Center. Shortly before its demolition, President Tori Haring-Smith took a group of alumni on a tour of the building. =Old Gym= The Old Gym in 1922 The Old Gym is an historic athletic training center and gymnasium, currently housing the Swanson Wellness Center, a modern exercise facility featuring cardiovascular, resistance, and strength training equipment. The building also features a three-lane indoor track suspended above the main floor. Prior to the construction of the Old Gym, students exercised and engaged in athletics under the grandstands at College Field. The exterior is Cleveland sandstone. In the early years, the interior space was used for basketball and as an auditorium. The basement once held a bowling alley and a swimming pool. Following renovations in 1927, where the interior was re-faced with brick and the swimming pool was expanded, the building was supposed to have been turned into a memorial hall for President James D. Moffat, but those plans never materialized. By 1938, the building was unable to host any intercollegiate athletic events, and during World War II, it was used as the Army Administration School. After the construction of the Henry Memorial Center, the building no longer housed any athletic events. Instead, the Old Gym was used for student activities and maintenance. In 2002, the basketball court area of the Old Gym was renovated and turned into the Swanson Wellness Center. =Davis Memorial Hall= Marking the southern border of campus, Davis Memorial Hall abuts U.S. Route 40. The white-painted brick structure was constructed in the American colonial architecture style in 1847 by Alexander Reed, a college trustee, who used it as his residence. It was once a stop on the Underground Railroad. In the early 1930s, it was photographed by Charles M. Stotz in preparation for writing his book, Early Architecture of Western Pennsylvania. In 1939, it was acquired by the college and used as a dormitory for 33 students. In the 1940s, it was converted to the Electrical Engineering Building. In 1947, the building was renamed from the Reed Dormitory to Davis Memorial Hall in honor of Harry Hamilton and Tillie Wilkinson Davis, who provided the funds for a major remodeling project. Following that renovation, the building housed offices and classrooms for the Department of English. A duplicate of the original cast iron fence currently surrounds the building. =Thistle Physics Building= The Thistle Physics building was built in 1912 and is named after Dr. Joseph Long Thistle, who donated the funds for its construction. It was home to the Department of Physics until moving to the Swanson Science Center in 2010. The building contains four teaching laboratories, three research labs, lecture rooms, and a fully equipped machine shop. =Lazear Chemistry Hall= The Lazear Chemistry Hall was constructed in the Georgian style between 1939 and 1949. It was designed by Frederick Larson and was named after former student Jesse William Lazear, who helped develop the cure for yellow fever. In 2010, the Department of Chemistry moved from Lazear to the new Swanson Science Center. With 50 rooms, including a nationally recognized polymer lab, a darkroom, a 100-seat lecture hall, and a main supply room with an acid room and hazardous chemical vault. The campus chapter of the Student Affiliates of the American Chemical Society produces an annual \\"Fear at Lazear\\" haunted house. The door to the Troutman Library on the first floor of Lazear holds the original doorknob from Tara, the main plantation house from the 1939 movie Gone with the Wind. It was donated to the college in May 1940 by the film's producer and Pittsburgh native David O. Selznick, who had family in the Washington area. A faulty heating system and general disrepair spurred the construction of the Swanson Science Center, where the chemistry department moved in 2010. =Dieter-Porter Life Sciences Building= The Dieter-Porter Life Science Building, was built in 1981 and totals in size. It contains classrooms, laboratories, and an auditorium. The building was named after two longtime Professors who were largely responsible for establishing the college's scientific reputation, Dr. Clarence D. Dieter and Dr. Homer C. Porter. The building also contains a library, which contains a study lounge, work space, and a meeting room. It was renovated in 2007 by the Phi Sigma biology honor society, who provided new paint, carpet, and furniture. The second floor contains The Meditation Room, with a small altar and limited seating. It was furnished by funds provided by the Women's Auxiliary and is in memory of Helen Turnbull Waite Coleman, who authored Banners in the Wilderness, a book about the early years of the college. The third floor contains a greenhouse, with a potting room, wooden benches, and skylights. During the winter, the plants are illuminated by timed electric lights. The greenhouse is used for the cultivation of plant specimens, especially tropical, that are used for classroom experiments and demonstrations. Space is also reserved for student projects. The building is also home to the United States Department of Defense-funded Combat Stress Intervention Program to develop solutions to poor access to health care for soldiers returning from the Iraq and Afghanistan. In 2008, the Biology Department (and the college) was awarded a $1 million programmatic grant from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, a portion of which will be used to help establish bioinformatics lab space in Dieter-Porter. The building will be renovated as part of the Science Initiative, which has already constructed the Swanson Science Center. The planned renovations will construct new common areas and a new entrance, install a new HVAC system, and improve the animal laboratory. Particularly troubling was the poor drainage, which led to flooding and mold accumulation, threatening the sterility of the laboratories. In 2011, it was announced that $1 million of the $9 million renovation cost would be funded through a Redevelopment Capital Assistance Program state grant. =Olin Fine Arts Center= The Olin Fine Arts Center houses a 488-seat auditorium and the Olin Art Gallery. It also houses classrooms and the Department of Art, Theatre, and Communication, and the Department of Music. Funding for its construction in 1982 was provided by the F. W. Olin Foundation, as well as the Eden Hall Foundation. It was home to the Vilar Distinguished Artist Series from 1999 to 2003. Andrew Druckenbrod, classical music critic for the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, said, while reviewing a 2003 performance of the Bavarian Radio Symphony Orchestra, that the \\"downside is that multipurpose Olin is not nearly equipped to handle such a group, either in stage size or acoustics. But cramped environs, blinking lighting and inadequate reverberation didn't deter the youthful orchestra from a deft performance.\\" Mark Kanny, classical music critic for the Pittsburgh Tribune- Review, said, while reviewing a 2001 performance of Valery Gergiev conducting the Kirov Orchestra, that \\"the [small] size of Olin actually added to the effectiveness of the concert. The music was heard in a more intimate environment and had more impact.\\" =The Burnett Center= The Burnett Center, as viewed at night A granite and limestone building, The Burnett Center anchors the northeastern border of campus. It houses the Departments of Economics and Business, Modern Languages, and Education, as well as the Yost Auditorium, an 84-seat lecture hall. The four seminar rooms, located in the tower structure of the left side of the building, feature 16-seat octagonal tables. The building was completed in 2001 at a cost of $12.8 million. It is named after Howard J. Burnett, who served as president from 1970 to 1998. The entrance plaza includes a fountain and a grassed bowl area in the lower plaza. The tower element on the left side of the building is intended to match the most prominent building on campus, Old Main. The interior railings include cast iron fleur-de-lis balusters from Hays Hall, the first dormitory on campus, that was demolished in 1994. The large vertical ribbon window assemblies and atrium provide a view of the rest of campus. The architecture and masonry work won several national awards. =Technology Center= The Technology Center The Technology Center houses the Information Technology Leadership program. All told, it houses over 200 instructional computers for use by the Information Technology Leadership and related classes. A statue of a coal miner, representing the work ethic and spirit of Western Pennsylvania, sits in the green space in front of the building. The building was formerly known as the Vilar Technology Center, in honor of alumnus Alberto Vilar, who had pledged $18.1 million to construct the building. After he reneged on that pledge in 2003, the building was renamed the Technology Center and plans for its completion were scaled back. It is the sister building to The Burnett Center, sharing the same architect and general contractor. =Swanson Science Center= The newest building on campus is the John A. Swanson Science Center, which was completed in February 2010. It was named after John A. Swanson, an engineer and businessman on the Board of Trustees, who donated $10 million towards its construction. This facility, containing of space, houses classrooms for Chemistry, Physics, Biophysics and Biochemistry and was designed to match its neighboring historic campus architecture. Its learning facilities include wet and dry teaching laboratories, faculty and student research laboratories, and a multi-disciplinary lab designed for non-science majors. The marble-lined grand entrance leads to a three-story atrium with marble pillars and Palladian windows facing Route 40 and the common area is designed to attract non-science students. It was designed to satisfy the LEED Silver qualifications for green buildings. The site of the Swanson Science Center is home to a historical marker in honor of Rebecca Harding Davis, an influential journalist and author who had attended the Washington Female Seminary, which had been on that site. The effort to place the marker there was led by Washington & Jefferson College English professor, and Harding descendant, Dr. Jennifer Harding. Residence halls =Hays Hall= Hays Hall circa 1913 The first residence hall at Washington & Jefferson College was Hays Hall. The architectural work on that building was performed by Frederick J. Osterling and it was named after President George P. Hays. Construction was completed in 1903 and the new \\"fireproof\\" building was opened to Washington & Jefferson Academy students. Rooms were arranged in a suite style, with communal bathrooms on each floor, and shower baths on the 5th floor. In 1912, the Academy closed and Hays Hall was used by Washington & Jefferson College students. At various times, Hays Hall housed the bookstore and a dining hall. By 1968, Hays Hall had deteriorated to the point where it was no longer able to house students, but the bookstore remained. In 1982, the building was declared a fire hazard and closed for all uses. While various efforts sought to renovate or restore Hays Hall, including a push to have it named a historical landmark, Hays Hall was demolished in 1994. =Wade House, Carriage House, and Whitworth House= The college owns three Victorian houses on the periphery of campus that are used as alternative living spaces for students. The college acquired Wade House, a late 19th-century Victorian mansion, in 1986. After a total renovation in 2007 and replacing the windows in 2008, it now houses upper-class women. Whitworth House is a mid 19th century Victorian mansion that was acquired by the college 1997. Originally known as Kimm House, it houses roughly 25 upper-class females. =Mellon Hall and Upperclass Hall= Mellon Hall and Upperclass Hall are adjacent freshman dormitories. Mellon Hall, which houses women, is named in memory of James Ross Mellon, an 1865 graduate of Jefferson College; funding for its construction in 1949 was provided by the W.L. and May T. Mellon Foundation. < 2008 renovation project expanded and redesigned the bathrooms, upgraded the electrical system, and installed sprinklers. Upperclass Hall, which currently houses men, was also built in 1949. It was renovated in 2008 to improve the bathrooms, upgrade the electrical system, and to install sprinklers. =Presidents' Row= Presidents' Row is a cluster of ten buildings in the center of campus, with each named after a former President of the United States: Adams, Buchanan, Cleveland, Fillmore, Grant, Harrison, Jefferson, Lincoln, Monroe, and Washington. Each unit contains a lounge, meeting rooms, and living areas for up to 35 students. Some rooms are air-conditioned. In addition to standard co- educational living arrangements, Presidents' Row is also home to various theme housing arrangements, including the \\"Pet House,\\" the Service Leadership House, and the WashPa Radio House. Built in 1968, they were originally called the Residential Center, then The Quads. Fraternities, and then sororities after 1970, were early occupants. In the fall of 2005, these organizations were moved to Chestnut Street housing. =New Residence Hall and Bica-Ross Hall= New Residence Hall and Bica-Ross Hall are sister dormitories, featuring suite- style living arrangements. New Residence Hall provides 24 living units, each with a common area, two single rooms, and a double room. It was constructed in 2002, with the 4th floor completed in 2004. In 2009‚Äì10, it housed 108 co- educational upperclass students. Funds for the construction of Bica-Ross Hall provided by Violet Ross in honor of her husband, L. Clayton Ross, who was a 1930 graduate. Constructed in 2004, living units in Bica Ross Hall have four single rooms with a common area. Bica Ross was constructed on the site of the former Trinity Episcopal Church, which had been surrounded on 3 sides by college property, making it a virtual part of the campus. In 1998, the college purchased the church's building, including the rectory and parish house, for $1.55 million. The congregation of 200 voted to accept the offer in order to build a larger church south of the town. Following the sale, the pastor expressed hope that the college would keep the building as a chapel. The church had been constructed in 1863. =Chestnut Street Housing= The Chestnut Street Housing student housing development is a series of 10 houses on Chestnut Street. The buildings are designed to look more like homes, rather than dorms, with front porches and living rooms.

It is named after former trustee Pete C. Rossin and was built in 1994. During the planning stages in 1991, the college asked the City of Washington to close South Lincoln Street between East Maiden and East Chestnut Street and reroute the traffic through College Street, which would have been made into a two-way street. The college was concerned about the increasing frequency of accidents between pedestrians and automobiles on that street, pointing to a recent incident involving an injured maintenance worker and the fact that there had been 6 other similar accidents in the previous 15 years. The new campus center would only increase pedestrian traffic on that street. The proposal was defeated by the City Council 5‚Äì0. The architecture work was performed by MacLachlan, Cornelius & Filoni, who won the Citation of Merit Pittsburgh Chapter American Institute of Architects award for Building Excellence and the Educational Design Excellence from the American School & University magazine. The building, which is connected to The Commons via a bridge, contains rooms designed for meetings, events, seminars, and conferences. It also is home to the College Bookstore, and George & Tom's Place. The Rossin Ballroom is a multi-purpose space that can be used for dances, banquets, performances. The Livingroom is a casual area behind the mail room, containing couches and other seating areas.  Other buildings  A chapel had existed on North Lincoln Street.

The first Jefferson College building in Canonsburg was the Stone College Building, which was constructed on land donated Colonel John Canon. It was demolished in 1843 to make room for a new town hall. Providence Hall, a red brick building with a tower, housed classrooms, the college library, and the refectory. It was built in 1832. The name was suggested by Moses Allen, who was President of the Board and the son- in-law John McMillan, the college's founder. It had three floors plus a basement, but a peak on the roof gave the impression of a fifth floor. From 1832 to 1890 it was a meeting place for Presbyterian Church of Canonsburg. In 1966, it was razed to build a junior high school. West College Building was razed 1912 to build a high school.

Born during the Harlem Renaissance Joseph Nash was born on October 5, 1919 in New York City to a butler and a housewife during the Harlem Renaissance on 99th Street near Central Park West prior to clearing for the New York Housing Authority's Park West Village. Dance career Before going on stage, he read Dance Magazine in the New York Times in order to teach himself dance. In the early 1940s, he met Pearl Primus at the National Youth Administration and became her first dance partner before studying dance with Syvilla Fort and Katherine Dunham. After serving in World War II, he returned to New York in 1946 first performing on Broadway in Show Boat, and in London in Finian‚Äôs Rainbow. Later, Nash became a member of Donald McKayle‚Äôs company, another African American choreographer of New York. He became a regular in Broadway originals, performing in My Darlin' Aida, Flahooley, and Bless You All. He also danced with Alvin Ailey in 1954 when he danced in House of Flowers, choreographed by Pearl Bailey. Starting in 1948, Joseph Nash became a dance instructor at Marion Cuyjet‚Äôs Judimar School of Dance in Philadelphia. His classes became famous in the city dance scene. One of his most talented students, Judith Jamison, became a world-famous dancer, becoming the artistic director of the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater. Arthur Hall, a dancer and archivist, was also one of his students. Contributions as a historian Nash collected books, articles, recordings, interviews, rare issues of dance magazines, and newspapers. Using his apartment as a contribution to dance history, he documented black dance memorabilia over decades, spreading everything throughout his apartment, eventually creating one of the country's largest collections of materials on the development of dance by black artists. Dance Magazine and the New York Times often quoted him and his contributions to dance magazines and the newspaper. He also gave commentary and photographs to The Black Tradition in American Dance. He also became a historian for the American Dance Festival, giving lectures nationwide and becoming a consultant for the PBS documentary Free to Dance in 2001. Death and legacy Prior to his death, he donated memorabilia from his collection to Florida A&M; University, the New York Public Library for the Performing Arts at Lincoln Center and the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture in Harlem. In 2004, he tripped and fell in his apartment in the Manhattanville Houses, pinned to the floor by a stack of books. He died April 13, 2005 from cardiovascular difficulties, at age 85. The Manhattan Office of the Public Administrator sealed his apartment to search for any relatives due to fears of his collection being scattered. Two nephews were later discovered to handle the estate. The collection later found its way to Duke University in 2009.
