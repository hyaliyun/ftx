Career Woelfel obtained his BA in Sociology from Canisius College in 1962, and an MA in Sociology from the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison in 1963. He obtained his Ph.D. in Sociology, also from the University of Wisconsin, in 1968. Throughout his studies he minored in philosophy. After acting as an instructor at Canisius College (1965‚Äì1966) and as a research associate at University of Wisconsin during his studies, Woelfel began work as an assistant professor at the University of Illinois at Urbana‚ÄìChampaign in 1968. In 1972 he moved to Michigan State University as an associate professor. Then in 1978 he moved to University at Albany, SUNY as a visiting professor, where he was then hired as an associate professor in 1979. In 1981 he was promoted to professor and in 1982 acted as chair of the Department of Communication.

At the University of Wisconsin he worked with Archie O. Hallerhttp://www.galileoco.com/CEtestlit/hallerSociologist.htm and Edward L. Fink on the \\"Significant Other Project,\\" a project originated by Haller as part of the larger \\"Wisconsin model\\" of status attainment. The Wisconsin Model is differentiated from other models of status attainment (e.g. those of Peter Blau and Otis Dudley Duncan,Blau, Peter M. and Duncan, Otis Dudley (1967). The American Occupational Structure. New York: Wiley and Sons. Nan Lin,Lin, N., Vaughn, J. C., & Ensel, W. M. (1981). Social resources and occupational status attainment. Social Forces 59(4), p. 1163-1181. See http://sf.oxfordjournals.org/content/59/4/1163.short and Mark Granovetter Granovetter, M. S. (1973). \\"The Strength of Weak Ties\\". American Journal of Sociology 78(6): 1360‚Äì1380. . https://www.jstor.org/journal/amerjsoci) by its focus on intervening social psychological and communication variables. Rather than assuming that individuals all seek high status and are helped or impeded in their quest by access to resources (social capital), the Wisconsin model suggests that different individuals aspire to different levels of educational and occupational attainment, and that these aspirations themselves are formed by a communication process whereby \\"significant others\\" communicate their expectations for the individual to him or her in various ways. Although the role of significant others' expectations in influencing the attitudes of individuals had been long theorized, the Wisconsin Significant Other project was the first research to identify the specific significant others for a set of individuals, measure their expectations directly, and calculate the effect of those expectations on the aspirations of the individuals.Woelfel, J., & Haller, A. (1971). Significant others: The self-reflexive act and the attitude formation process. American Sociological Review, 36(1), 74-87. In the process, the project developed the Wisconsin Significant Other Battery (WISOB) to identify specific significant others for any individual and to measure their educational and occupational expectations for him or her.http://www.galileoco.com/hallerLit/wisob.pdf This research later developed into a more general theory of attitude formation called Galileo theory.http://www.acsu.buffalo.edu/~woelfel/whatisit.htm Woelfel was instrumental in developing computer software such as CATPAC, a neural network that analyzes text, and the Galileo suite of programs used to measure beliefs and attitudes.http://www.yorku.ca/drpi/WoelfelBio.html The Rand Corporation surveyed numerous social science approaches for measuring attitudes and indicated in a 2009 report that \\"One of the more interesting approaches to communication and attitude change we found was Joseph Woelfel‚Äôs metric multidimensional scaling approach, which is called Galileo. In many ways, Woelfel‚Äôs theory was the closest that any social science approach came to providing the basis for an end-to-end engineering solution for planning, conducting, and assessing the impact of communications on attitudes and behaviors.\\"from https://www.rand.org/pubs/monographs/2009/RAND_MG654.pdf; Larson, Eric V., Richard E.

Tracing scientific thought via two ancient Greek networks (Athenian and Ionian), Woelfel's 2013 book further considers how concepts are formed first by the collective and then communicated to individual minds through interaction among individuals. In this book he argues the lack of progress exhibited in the social sciences is due to inadequacy of the underlying Athenian philosophy that continues to pervade the social sciences; he then shows how human processes can successfully be studied using the same methods used to study physical phenomena.https://www.amazon.com/The-Culture-Science- Is-Social-ebook/dp/B00CLV07XQ Bibliography Books: Woelfel, J.

A key figure in the Aesthetic Movement, he introduced the East Indian craft revival to Gilded Age America. As a young man, de Forest first worked as a painter, taking the lessons of his Hudson River School contemporaries. In 1879, de Forest began his career in the decorative arts working at Associated Artists along with Louis Comfort Tiffany, before starting his own decorating business that he ran for thirty years. Upon his retirement, de Forest moved to Santa Barbara where he returned to his love of painting while still taking design commissions from local patrons. Early life Lockwood de Forest was born in New York City in 1850 to a prominent family that had made its money in South American and Caribbean shipping. He grew up in Greenwich Village and on Long Island at the family summer estate. Encouraged by his parents, Henry Grant de Forest and Julia Mary Weeks, Lockwood and his three siblings developed lifelong interests in the arts; the eldest son, Robert Weeks (1848‚Äì1931), served for seventeen years as the president of The Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York; their sister, Julia Brasher (1853‚Äì1910), wrote a book on the history of art; and their youngest brother, Henry Wheeler (1855‚Äì1938), was an avid art collector and amateur landscape architect. He was matriculated at Columbia College with the class of 1872, but did not graduate according to official records. During a visit to Rome in 1868, nineteen-year-old de Forest first began to study art seriously, taking painting lessons from the Italian landscapist Hermann David Salomon Corrodi (1844‚Äì1905). On the same trip, Lockwood met the American painter (and his maternal great-uncle by marriage) Frederic Edwin Church (1826‚Äì1900) who became his mentor. De Forest accompanied Church on sketching trips around Italy and continued this practice when they both returned to America in 1869. In 1872, de Forest took a studio at the Tenth Street Studio Building in New York. During these formative years, de Forest counted among his friends artists such as Sanford Robinson Gifford (1823‚Äì80), John Frederick Kensett (1816‚Äì72), Jervis McEntee (1828‚Äì91), and Walter Launt Palmer (1854‚Äì1932). Over the next decade, de Forest experienced moderate success as a painter. He exhibited for the first time at the National Academy of Design in 1872 and made two more painting trips abroad, in 1875‚Äì76 and 1877‚Äì78, traveling to the major continental capitals but also the Middle East and North Africa. De Forest's works from the 1870s are generally modest-sized canvases depicting low-key views in an evocative painterly style. Career thumb150pxArmchair Designer: Lockwood de Forest, Manufacturer: Ahmedabad Wood Carving Company, Teak, produced in Ahmedabad, India ca. 1895, [http://www.brooklynmuseum.org/opencollection/objects/189238/Armchair Brooklyn Museum] In his mid-twenties, de Forest became interested in decoration and architecture after browsing Church‚Äôs extensive library at his Persian-style home, Olana, in New York. De Forest‚Äôs first major interior design project was to remodel his parent's New York townhouse in 1876. In 1879, de Forest became a partner of the design firm Associated Artists, with Louis Comfort Tiffany (1848‚Äì1933), Samuel Colman (1832‚Äì1920), and Candace Wheeler (1827‚Äì1923) where he directed the production of architectural woodwork. Associated Artists lasted only four years, however the firm was one of the most influential decorating companies in the 19th century, and at the forefront of the American Aesthetic Movement emphasizing hand work, intricate color and texture, and tasteful but exotic design themes. The same year he joined Associated Artists de Forest married Meta Kemble and the newlyweds visited British India on their honeymoon. During what became a two-year trip, de Forest collected furniture, jewelry and textiles as he and his wife raveled through Bombay (Mumbai), Surat, Baroda (Vadodara), Ahmadabad, Agra, Delhi, Amritsar, Lahore, and Srinagar. In Ahmadabad de Forest met Muggunbhai Hutheesing, a philanthropist with an interest in the arts, and together the two men opened the Ahmadabad Woodcarving Company. This studio became crucial to supplying Associated Artists with carved architectural elements and furniture. While in India de Forest also became good friends with John Lockwood Kipling (father of Rudyard Kipling), who shared de Forest's passion for Indian art. Together, the two men organized a display of works by the Ahmadabad Woodcarving Company at the Lahore Museum in 1881. After Associated Artists closed in 1882, de Forest opened his own design business in New York with a lavish showroom at 9 East 17th Street. In addition to managing the design, production and import of Indian goods, de Forest continued to design his own furnishings and architectural ornaments. His work was exhibited at the Colonial and Indian Exhibition in London in 1886 and at the World's Columbian Exposition seven years later. De Forest‚Äôs offerings at these fairs attracted an impressive array of clients, including the industrialist Andrew Carnegie (de Forest designed Carnegie's bedroom and library in the Andrew Carnegie House, now the Cooper-Hewitt Museum), transportation magnate Charles Tyson Yerkes, Chicago businessman Potter Palmer, and author Mark Twain. In 1887, de Forest bought 7 East 10th Street. He had the architect Van Campen Taylor design a plain, basic house that he then proceeded to decorate with intricately carved teak elements made in India. The home was featured in a New York Times article in 1895, where it was written: \\"The De Forest house surpasses all others in the completeness and harmony of its Oriental character‚Ä¶ [The architectural elements and furnishings] are as wholly East Indian as though they were furnishing a Hindu instead of a New-York apartment.\\"\\"Unique in Decoration; Hindu Wood Carvings Used in Interior Housefurnishings; An Artist‚Äôs East Indian Home A Very Beautiful Example of the Art of the Orient,\\" New York Times, November 24, 1895, Wednesday, p. 28. Today, this home is the Bronfman Center for Jewish Student Life at New York University.White, Norval; Willensky, Elliot; and Leadon, Fran. AIA Guide to New York City (Oxford and New York: Oxford University Press, 2010), 146. While working in the decorating business, de Forest had continued to paint at home and he exhibited his work frequently at the Century Association and the National Academy of Design. In 1898, de Forest was made a full member of the Academy and it was around this time, with a declining market for exotic interiors, that de Forest became a prolific painter again. Later life and death After beginning to winter in Santa Barbara, California around 1902, de Forest built a house and moved there permanently in 1915. He was attracted to the comfortable climate and striking coastlines of the West Coast and, while he continued to design and decorate houses, landscape painting became his primary occupation. De Forest created hundreds of oil sketches of Californian sites, and also traveled around the Pacific Northwest (1903), Maine (1905 and 1908), the Grand Canyon (1906 and 1909), Mexico (1904, 1906‚Äì7 and 1911), Massachusetts (1910) and Alaska (1912).

Prior to his move to Taiwan, he was the conductor and associate conductor of major American symphonies including the Chicago Symphony Orchestra. He contributed greatly to the refinement of the performances of classical music in Taiwan, leading local musicians to gain recognition overseas. There is a cultural center dedicated to him in Taipei. Biography Born in Pittsburgh, Mazer was educated at Duquesne University and at the Carnegie Institute of Technology. Mazer chose conducting for his career early-on in his life, and became the prot√©g√© of renowned conductor Fritz Reiner. At Reiner's recommendation, Mazer conducted the Wheeling Symphony Orchestra in West Virginia from 1948‚Äì1958 and the Florida Symphony Orchestra in Orlando from 1958‚Äì1965. In 1966, Mazer was named Associate Conductor of the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra. Four years later, he received a last-minute invitation to stand-in with the Symphony when its conductor, William Steinberg, was taken ill. Held at New York City's Carnegie Hall, the concert brought Mazer to the attention of Sir Georg Solti, who later asked him to be his Associate Conductor of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, a position he held for the next 15 years. During that time, he performed with internationally acclaimed musicians such as Arthur Rubinstein, Isaac Stern, Andr√©s Segovia, Rudolf Serkin, Robert Casadesus, and Marian Anderson. Mazer conducted hundreds of subscription concerts for the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, often substituting for Solti on short notice. Although initially described alongside Solti as the \\"new breed of virtuosi,\\" not every review was positive: following his move to Taiwan, one Chicago critic described his performances as \\"dull readings.\\" Mazer, however, would end up with no shortage of fans. In Chicago, however, he had seemed overshadowed by Solti, but was seen as dedicated and highly competent, taking on more avant-garde works neither Solti nor others would touch. Taiwan would be different. Mazer was first approached about coming to Taiwan as a guest conductor during his term with the Chicago Symphony and agreed to visit the island for four concerts in the summer of 1985. After the success of the concerts, Mazer took on the challenge of developing a new orchestra in Taiwan ‚Äì Taipei Sinfonietta (the former Taipei Philharmonic Orchestra). \\"I could not help develop the Chicago Symphony Orchestra any further, whereas in Taiwan I could see plenty of development potential\\", he said. In 1990, Mazer brought the orchestra to perform in the United States and Canada. Music critic William Russo wrote: \\"The Sinfonietta is one of the finest groups of musicians I have ever heard\\". Gradually, such impressive reviews overseas would succeed in opening eyes back in Taiwan. During its image-building campaign abroad, the orchestra also toured Europe over the next couple of years, playing in Lyons, Brussels, and Antwerp. But the highlights of the various European concerts was their performance in Musikvereinssaal, home to Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra. Following the performances, music critics in Austria dubbed the orchestra a \\"wonder of Taiwan.\\" After the Vienna trip, Mazer's orchestra enjoyed a surge in popularity back home in Taiwan. In addition, several CDs released by the orchestra met with brisk sales. The most recent overseas tour was in 1995 to New York and Boston. After the performance at the Boston Symphony Hall, Mazer received the greatest review of his career when Boston Globe music critic Richard Dyer compared him to America's beloved Leonard Bernstein. \\"The way the Taipei Sinfonietta plays is a real tribute to Mazer's musicianship. They play with a glowing sound, a precision of intonation, an absolute unanimity of impulse, and a rare commitment,\\" he added. Despite the international recognition, Mazer lead a very simple life while he was in Taiwan. He got along well with his Chinese musicians, some of whom he worked with for a decade and were regarded as his own children. Mazer said he found Chinese musicians to be more disciplined than those in the West, and thus more satisfying to work with. \\"This wonderful island has given me the best musical experience of my life.\\"  Recordings  *1950 - Henry Mazer conducting the Wheeling Symphony Orchestra in \\"pops\\" favorites of the Ohio Valley. / 1950 / 12\\" Vinyl / Blackcrest Records *1962 ‚Äì Infinite Journey, Wernher von Braun / Johann Sebastian Bach / Bach Festival Choir / Florida Symphony Orchestra / Various Artists *1992 ‚Äì TPO Live 1: Music With Mazer , various composers / Taipei Philharmonic OrchestraMusicBrainz musicbrainz.org 2017 *1994 ‚Äì TPO Live 4: Maestro Henry Mazer , various composers / Taipei Philharmonic OrchestraMusicBrainz musicbrainz.org 2017 *2003 ‚Äì TPO Live 16 , various composers / Taipei Philharmonic OrchestraMusicBrainz musicbrainz.org 2017  Awards  In addition to awards and international critical acclaim for his music and recordings, Mazer was noted in Chicago for his contribution to children's concerts, including the CSO's Petites Promenades Concert Series, which held several performances each year, sometimes in collaboration with Lady Solti and composer Irwin Fischer. Mazer had already been actively involved in youth musical education in Orlando through the Florida Symphony Youth Orchestra while conducting the Florida Symphony Orchestra. In Chicago, Mazer was put in charge of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra's educational program and received press attention when asked to \\"revitalize\\" the CSO's youth concerts, working with Chicago's Junior League to raise funding for musical education. In addition to holding \\"miniconcerts\\" and lecturing in the Chicago Public Schools, Mazer helped bring \\"unprepared ghetto children\\" to concerts. Mazer won a Special Award for Music Education in 1986 from then- Chicago Mayor Harold Washington.  In Literature  Mazer makes an extended appearance in Sir Yehudi Menuhin‚Äôs then-widely read autobiography Unfinished Journey.  Personal life  In Taiwan, through \\"steely strength\\" the energetic Mazer insisted on walking despite a serious injury and operation that \\"would have an ordinary person confined to a wheelchair forever.\\" Although Mazer would be survived by several children from his marriage, Mazer lived alone in Taiwan after the death of his wife.  Museums  The Taipei Philharmonic and Henry Mazer Music and Cultural Center in Zhongzhen District in Taipei was built in Mazer's memory. The lower level is dedicated to exhibits on the conductor. Visitors can view Mazer's former belongings, photographs, and listen to Mazer's music and videos on vinyl, CD, and DVD in listening rooms.

Usually, work units are moved along line (not necessarily a geometric line, but a set of interconnected work stations) by a conveyor. Work is done in small amounts at each of the work stations on the line. To use the product layout, the total work to be performed must be dividable into small tasks that can be assigned to each of the workstations. Because the work stations each do small amounts of work, the stations utilize specific techniques and equipment tailored to the individual job they are assigned.

This includes leadership development, multi-generational support, immigration advocacy, mental health and HIV/AIDS activism, and political involvement. In 1995, SALGA NYC was awarded the Community Service Award from the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force and Community Leadership Award from Queens Pride, Inc. in 2015.  Programming  Founded in 1991, SALGA NYC's primary concerns are of providing support and visibility to a marginalized community. SALGA NYC has continually hosted a monthly support group since 1991 for those who self-identify as queer and South Asian, alongside many community building activities such as social hours, cultural programming and political organizing. In addition to this regular program of events, SALGA NYC hosts informal community events and collaborates with similarly oriented community organizations in the NYC area. Past collaborations include health workshops with APICHA Community Health Center, the annual Color Me Queer post-pride party held with the Audre Lord Project and other LGBTQ People of Color community groups, and organizing with other South Asian groups such as Sakhi for South Asian Women and the South Asian Women's Creative Collective. SALGA has also created a space for LGBTQ South Asian youth through its Youth Group. Members within SALGA formed a Book Club, which has hosted authors such as Ruth Vanita, Rakesh Satyal, and Vivek Shraya. SALGA also a regular dance team which performs in many venues including New York City Pride March, the Queens Museum, and Flushing Town Hall.  India Day Parade  The group has gained media attention over its fight to participate in the annual India Day Parade in New York City, hosted by the Federation of Indian Associations. Denied the right to march in the parade from 1993‚Äì1997, SALGA held protests to counter the repeated rejections, including being invited to march under the Sakhi banner. SALGA was subsequently permitted to participate in the march up until 2000, when the FIA once again started to reject the organization's applications.

Rare in cultivation, it is known as tzimbalo. The fruit closely resembles the related pepino (Solanum muricatum), and it has been speculated that Solanum caripense may be the wild ancestor of the pepino. Like the pepino, the tzimbalo is a relative of other nightshades cultivated for their edible fruit, including the tomato (S. lycopersicum), the naranjilla (S. quitoense) and the eggplant (S. melongena). The fruit is infrequently cultivated in its native range of Colombia, Ecuador, Bolivia, Peru and Chile, but has been rediscovered on a small scale by heirloom gardeners elsewhere in the world. Distribution and habitat The tzimbalo is presumed to be native to the temperate Andean regions of Colombia, Ecuador, Peru and Chile. Like the pepino, the tzimbalo can bear fruit within 1 or 2 years from seed. The fruits are round berries, to 2 cm in size, which ripen to yellow or pale green, with dark-colored longitudinal stripes. The flavor and texture, while similar to the pepino, tends to be tangier and more juicy. Like the pepino, the tzimbalo performs best in a warm, relatively frost-free climates. The plant can survive a low temperature of -2.5 ¬∞C (27 to 28 ¬∞F) if the freeze is very short, though it may drop many of its leaves. Like its close relatives, the species is a perennial, but its sensitivity to chilling, pests, and diseases, along with its relatively long growing season serve as hindrances to large scale commercial exploitation. The tzimbalo does adapt well to greenhouse cultivation. Like most edible nightshades, the tzimbalo is highly attractive to pests like aphids, white flies, beetles, and spider mites.

Creek and foliage, downtown Hayward View from bridge, downtown Hayward San Lorenzo Creek Trail entrance Watershed The creek begins in Castro Valley, and is the main tributary within the San Lorenzo Watershed, including the formerly independent Sulphur Creek, which had most of its flow diverted into San Lorenzo Creek in the 1960s to reduce the risk of flooding in downtown Hayward. Only in large flow events does some of the creek flow follow its old course into the Bay.San Lorenzo Creek WatershedSan Lorenzo Creek: Neighboring Creeks The creek runs through the town of San Lorenzo and empties into San Francisco Bay. A portion of the San Francisco Bay Trail runs along the mouth of the creek.Bay Trail, San Leandro: San Lorenzo Creek to Marina Park The Cull Canyon and Don Castro reservoirs, both located within regional parks, feed into the creek. History The creek marks the farthest northward point of exploration by the Portol√° expedition of 1769‚Äì70. Scouts camped at the creek before turning back to join the main party on the west side of the bay. Further explorations, led by Monterey presidio commander Pedro Fages in 1770 and 1772, also used the camp before continuing to the north. From records dating to 1772, the creek was previously known to Spanish colonists as Arroyo de San Salvador de Horta, and Arroyo de la Harina. The current name for the creek, Arroyo de San Lorenzo, dates to at least 1812, and was recorded as such in land grants from 1841 and 1842. El Camino Viejo now Mission Boulevard, passed through what is now San Lorenzo, California, crossing San Lorenzo Creek where Mission Boulevard crosses it now. Ecology San Lorenzo Creek historically supported steelhead (the anadromous form of the coastal rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss irideus), , and other salmonids. A 1997 paper states that, due to reasons tied to the ever increasing urbanization, dams, and their effect on the area, no sign of juvenile nor mature steelhead could be found in the creek. Since steelhead in the Bay Area and California's Central Coast were listed as threatened under the Endangered Species Act in 1997, numerous organizations, and governmental agencies have cooperated on restoration projects to allow migratory fish from the Bay to reach spawning habitat in various Bay Area watersheds.

The town boundaries extended from the modern Yarrum Grove, Boundary Road and Oaklands Road (Somerton Park), in the north, to Kingston Park reserve, Kingston House, Scholfield Road (Kingston Park) and Arthur Street (Seacliff Park) in the south. On the west it was bounded by the coastline and on the east by the modern Brighton Road (Somerton Park), MacArthur Avenue (Hove), Winton Avenue (Hove), Neath Avenue (South Brighton) and Davenport Terrace (Seacliff Park). The inaugural councillors named in the 1858 proclamation were: Francis Corbet Singleton, Pitt Cobbett, George William Chinner, William Home Popham, and William Voules Brown. The municipality of Brighton ultimately became the City of Brighton when it crossed the required population threshold in the early 1900s. Brighton and its northern coastal neighbour, the City of Glenelg, were amalgamated in 1997 to become the City of Holdfast Bay, which retained the two civic centres at Brighton and Glenelg.

Casting and Development  Sinead Keenan played Nina Sinead Keenan got told by her agent told her she would be auditioning for a show about a werewolf, a ghost and a vampire. She then auditioned for the show and got the role of Nina. The first plan for Sinead Keenan's character Nina was to be written out of the series at the end of season one. When creator Toby Whithouse saw Keenan's and Tovey's great dynamic on set while filming he decided that the character Nina should stay. Since the producers enjoyed the relationship between Nina and George very much they decided that Keenan should become a series regular within the third season. Nina remained in the series for another year until Keenan decided to leave the series.  Leaving the series  In January 2012 Sinead Keenan announced on Twitter that she would not return to Being Human. She said that she had a heavy heart but also felt a little relief. For her it was a difficult decision, after having three wonderful years and one of her best in her acting career. She also said that her departure would happen off-screen since she hasn't filmed anything for series four.  Characterisation  Nina is a headstrong woman in her mid twenties. Nina is tough and has her own physical and emotional baggage to deal with. During her childhood Nina has been beaten up by her mother. She wonders if she can be a good mother herself. Nina works as a Senior Staff nurse in the hospital in Bristol. Reception Mark Oakley from Den of Geek thought that Keenan had a ‚Äûrather thankless role in Doctor Who‚Äú, however he thinks that Keenan is much better in Being Human, ‚Äûlending a bit of weight to the character of Nina, who is going to have a larger role to play‚Äú in series two. According to The Daily Telegraph Nina‚Äôs relationship with George was perceived very well by fans and critics. Matt Risley from IGN thinks that Sinead Keenan and Russell Tovey \\"bring an intimacy and humanity\\" to Nina's and George's relationship that \\"effortlessly straddles the line between horror, comedy and drama\\". Matt Wales from IGN praises Sinead Keenan's \\"mesmerizingly broken performance as Nina\\" when the werewolf-in-waiting tries to deal with her new nature.

He is best known as the grandfather of Catherine Parr, last wife of King Henry VIII. Family Sir Thomas was the son of Sir Thomas Greene (d. 1468) and Matilda Throckmorton (d. 1496). This branch of the Green family resided at Greens Norton in Northamptonshire from the fourteenth century until the death of the last Sir Thomas Green without male heirs in 1506. Career Little is known of Sir Thomas Green's life. A brass erected to his memory in the church of St Bartholomew at Greens Norton records that he was the son of Sir Thomas Greene (d. 9 September 1462) and Maud Throckmorton, the daughter of John Throckmorton (d. 12 April 1445), Under-Treasurer of England. According to Fraser, his traits were those of any man of the time: he was conservative in religion, quarrelsome, conniving, and prone to taking the law into his own hands. On 6 and 17 November 1505, inquisitions post mortem were taken concerning his lands in which the jurors found that he was 43 years of age at that date, and that his father, Sir Thomas Greene the elder, had died 9 September 1462 seised in fee of certain manors, and that his mother, Maud Greene, had 'entered and intruded into the premises and received all the issues thereof' from the date of his father's death until Michaelmas (29 September) 1482, 'immediately after which feast the said Thomas Grene, the son, entered and intruded without ever suing or obtaining licence from Edward IV or the present king or livery out of the king's hands, and has received the issues thereof ever since'. He was sent to the Tower of London about that time on a trumped up charge of treason, and died there on 9 November 1506. The circumstances of the treason charge are set forth in Hardying's Chronicle: > Also shortly after the departing of [the earl] Philip, George Neville, Lord > of Bergavenny, and Sir Thomas Grene, knight, were suspected to be guilty of > the treason that Edmund Pole had wrought, and so cast in prison, but shortly > after, when they had purged themselves of that suspicion and crime, they > were delivered, albeit this knight, Sir Thomas Grene, died in prison. The > other lord, for his soberness of living & true heart that he bare to his > prince, was had in greater estimation than ever he was before. In connection with the treason charge, Green was mentioned in a deposition by an unnamed person who had been urged to enter Edmund de la Pole's service, but who had determined to consult with 'astronomers' as to what would be Pole's 'likely fortune' before doing so. An inquisition post mortem taken on 13 March 1507 found that Green had died seised of the keepership of Whittlewood Forest and the manors of Norton Davy, Boughton, Little Brampton, Pysford, Great Houghton and Great Doddington, and 30 messuages, 600 acres of land, 300 acres of meadow, 1000 acres of pasture, ¬£20 rent and 200 acres of wood in Norton Davy, Boughton, Little Brampton, Pysford, Great Houghton, Great Doddington, Sewell, Potcote, Higham Parva alias Cold Higham, and Middleton, and that his heirs were his two daughters, Anne Greene, aged 17 years and more, and Maud Green, aged 13 years and more. The last of his line, he left two motherless daughters. As he had no male heirs, his estates passed to the Parr and Vaux families, into which his two daughters married. Family Greene married Jane, the daughter of Sir John Fogge, Knt. They had two daughters: *Anne Green (c.1489 - before 14 May 1523) who married Nicholas Vaux, 1st Baron Vaux of Harrowden (d. 14 May 1523) as his second wife. Vaux had previously been married to her sister's mother-in-law, Elizabeth FitzHugh. By Vaux, Anne was the mother of Thomas Vaux, 2nd Baron Vaux of Harrowden. *Maud Green (6 April 1492 ‚Äì 1 December 1531), who married Sir Thomas Parr, son of Sir William Parr, and Elizabeth FitzHugh.

History After the first series of The Office was broadcast in 2001, creators Ricky Gervais and Stephen Merchant returned to local radio station XFM London, where they used to host their own radio show. Page 2 For this revival of The Ricky Gervais Show, Karl Pilkington worked as radio producer, and steadily became a more and more important part of the show. After years of the three doing the radio show, in 2005, they started doing a series of free podcasts, and later paid audiobooks, available to download on the Internet. The Show consistently ranked as the number one podcast in the world and previously held the Guinness World Record as the most downloaded podcast ever with over 300 million downloads . Discussions about the animated series began in 2008; Gervais first mentioned the project on his blog in November 2008. Earlier collaborations with HBO include the co-production of the Gervais/Merchant series Extras together with the BBC, as well as Gervais's Out of England stand-up comedy special. The first preview clip of the series was shown on Late Show with David Letterman, in November 2009. The episode \\"Knob at Night\\" was nominated for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Animated Program (for Programming Less Than One Hour) at the 62nd Primetime Emmy Awards. Broadcast and distribution Each season of The Ricky Gervais Show consists of 13 episodes. The series premiered in the United States on 19 February 2010 on HBO. The second season started on 14 January 2011. and the third on 20 April 2012. In the United Kingdom, the first season was shown on Channel 4, with the following seasons airing on its counterpart, E4 first. Though a co-production, Channel 4 air HBO's edit rather than making their own with their own name in the credits. The first season was released on region 2 DVD on 19 July 2010. The region 1 (North American) DVD was released on 4 January 2011. Extras on the region 1 release include a short piece of animation created for the Channel 4 Comedy Gala, and the storyboard version of episode 3, \\"Charity\\", showing what the animation looks in the middle of production. The region 2 DVD contains all these, along with a number of videos where the three friends chat, as well as original HBO commercials and trailers for the show. The Series 2 DVD had been made available only through Warner Archive as a \\"made-to-order\\" DVD (meaning the disc is only produced once it is ordered). The three-disc set includes as extras storyboard versions of Episodes 8 (\\"Future\\") and 13 (\\"Munchies\\"), two of the HBO promotional interviews with Ricky Gervais, and a two-question interview of all three stars. The second series has since been made available to pre-order for a release date of 25 June 2012 in the UK. In June 2012, Ricky Gervais stated on his blog that he was not sure whether there would be a fourth season because he felt that he had used up all the good material. However, the series had not been ended for certain. > \\"I think the show has steadily grown in both quality and popularity and I'd > love to go out on a high so to speak. My worry is that as we've used up all > the best material we'd have to record hours and hours of new stuff and it > might ruin the naivety of the whole thing. Never say never though, like The > Office. But certainly for now.\\" ‚Äì Ricky Gervais. In July 2012, Ricky Gervais stated on Twitter that the third season of The Ricky Gervais Show would be the last: > \\"Bad news: Last Ricky Gervais Show tonight on E4.\\" See also *The Ricky Gervais Show ‚Äì the podcast and audio book series that the TV show is based on *List of The Ricky Gervais Show (animated series) episodes ‚Äì the episodes of the cartoon series *An Idiot Abroad ‚Äì a travel documentary series in which Gervais and Merchant send Pilkington to various places around the world References External links * *The Ricky Gervais Show on Gervais' website * Category:2010s British adult animated television series Category:2010s British animated comedy television series Category:2010 British television series debuts Category:2012 British television series endings Category:American adult animated comedy television series Category:British adult animated comedy television series Category:British flash animated television series Category:English-language television shows Category:HBO original programming Category:Channel 4 comedy Category:E4 comedy Category:Television shows based on podcasts Category:Television series by DHX Media Category:Television series by Media Rights Capital Category:Television series created by Ricky Gervais Category:Television series created by Stephen Merchant ","title":"The Ricky Gervais Show (TV series)"},{"id":"30503532","text":"The City of Glenelg was a local government area in South Australia seated at the Adelaide sea-side township of Glenelg from 1855 until 1997. History The Corporate Town of Glenelg was proclaimed on 23 August 1855 by severance from the District Council of West Torrens and District Council of Brighton. When first proclaimed, the corporate town extended over sections 184, 204 and 205 of the Hundred of Noarlunga. At the time, section 204 was already bisected west to east by the \\"main road leading from Adelaide to Glenelg\\", which ultimately was called Anzac Highway. The initial town boundaries extended from approximately the modern Kibby Avenue and Margaret Street (Glenelg North), in the north, to the modern Boundary Road and Yarrum Grove (Somerton Park), in the south. Five years later, the Corporate Town of Brighton was proclaimed immediately to the south of Glenelg council. In the half century from 1900 the Glenelg council was enlarged by four separate annexations of portions of the District Council of West Torrens, its north eastern neighbour. The municipality of Glenelg ultimately became the City of Glenelg when it crossed the required population threshold in the early 1900s. Glenelg and its southern coastal neighbour, the City of Brighton, were amalgamated in 1997 to become the City of Holdfast Bay, which retained the two civic centres at Glenelg and Brighton.

It was founded on 9 April 1994 and officially recognized on 25 October 2002. Its founder and Secretary-General is the radiologist Mustapha Ben Jafar.  History  During the rule of Ben Ali, the FDTL played only a secondary role. It was a member of the oppositional 18 October Coalition for Rights and Freedoms alongside the Progressive Democratic Party, the Communist Party of Tunisian Workers and some Islamists. Although participating in legislative elections, it could not win any seats in the Tunisian parliament. Ettakatol's secretary-general Ben Jafar attempted to run for the 2009 presidential election, but was barred from the race. = Elections of 2009 = In 2009, Ettakatol ran for the first time in the parliamentary elections, winning only 0.12% of the vote and no seats in the Chamber of Deputies. For the presidential election held on the same day, the Mustapha Ben Jaafar announced his candidacy for the election. Indeed, although a recent party leader who has not held elective congress at that time Ben Jaafar defends his candidacy in an interview with Jeune Afrique. He supported his candidacy on an analysis of lawyers on the constitutional amendment in July 2008. But Zuhair M'dhaffer, Minister Delegate to the Prime Minister for the Public Service and Administrative Development and former President of the Constitutional Council, insists that \\"the leader of a party has to be elected president by Congress, not by the founding body of the movement\\". However, Ben Jaafar said that \\"neither the constitution nor the electoral code, nor the law on political parties do not mention such a requirement\\" and that it depends on the rules of procedure of the parties. On the occasion of its Ettakatol's first congress held on 29 and 30 May 2009, Mustapha Ben Jaafar was reconfirmed as Secretary- General. Ben Jaafar said his nomination confirmed by the Congress of the FDTL, especially for a \\"challenge to change the rules of the political game and break with the practices of another planet\\" while remaining open to dialogue, including with the party in power. He thinks that \\"failing to have equal means, [the candidates] should have the same chance to start\\" . On 24 September, he was the last nominee to present his candidacy, saying that \\"there are people capable of assuming the highest political responsibilities [...] and the alternation of power is possible,\\" his approach trying to \\"get Tunisians lethargy and resignation of the state in which they are\\". His supporters gathered inside the Constitutional Council, it calls for the release of trade unionists convicted in the wake of the social movement of 2008 in the mining region of Redeyef. The Constitutional Council, however, invalidate the bid on the grounds that it does not meet the requirement that a candidate must be elected leader of his training for at least two years. Therefore, Ben Jaafar called 5 Oct to vote for Brahim who is the \\"only serious candidate,\\" he said. = After the revolution = During the Tunisian Revolution 2010/11, Ettakatol developed into a main representative of the centre-left secular camp. The Forum relies mainly on the voluntary commitment of its grassroot members and its activities in social media. On 17 January 2011, Ettakatol's leader Ben Jafar was appointed Health Minister of the interim government by prime minister Mohamed Ghannouchi. Protests on the streets however continued against the unchanged prevalence of ministers from Ben Ali's old dominant RCD party. The freshly appointed three ministers of the Tunisian General Labour Union (UGTT) immediately reacted and resigned just a day later. The same day, Ben Jafar joined them refusing to take up his position in the transitional government. In the Constituent Assembly election on 23 October 2011, Ettakatol won 20 of the 217 seats making it the fourth force in the Assembly. Subsequently, the FDTL came to an agreement with the two major parties, the Islamist Ennahda Movement and the secular Congress for the Republic (CPR), to share the three highest positions in state. Accordingly, Ben Jafar was voted Speaker of the Assembly on 22 November. In exchange, the Forum supported the election of CPR-leader Moncef Marzouki as interim President of the Republic, and the appointment of Ennahda's secretary- general Hamadi Jebali as Prime Minister. Ettakatol was unanimously elected as a full member of the Socialist International at the congress held on 30 August 2012. The party held its second congress on 7 July 2013; Ben Jafar was reconfirmed as Secretary-General. The foundation of Nidaa Tounes in July 2013, led to a number of parliamentarians defecting from Ettakatol and other parties to join the new party. In the 2014 parliamentary election, Ettakatol lost all of its previous 20 seats except for one in the Kasserine electoral district, which was reallocated by the Elections Authority sanctioning Nidaa Tounes for irregularities by party members. Ideology The FDTL is a member of the Socialist International and observer of the Party of European Socialists. Since 2007 the party has published an Arabic weekly newspaper entitled Mouatinoun (Citizens).

Accessed: March 20, 2015. International Day of Forests was observed for the first time on March 21, 2013.  Background  Each year more than 13 million hectares (32 million acres) of forests are lost, an area roughly the size of England. As go the forests, so grow the plant and animal species that they embrace ‚Äì 80% of all terrestrial biodiversity. Most importantly, forests play a critical role in climate change including global warming: deforestation results in 12-18 percent of the world's carbon emissions ‚Äì almost equal to all the CO2 from the global transport sector. Equally crucial, healthy forests are one of the world's primary 'carbon sinks.' Today, forests cover more than 30% of the world's land and contain more than 60,000 tree species, many as of yet unidentified. Forests provide food, fiber, water and medicines for approximately 1.6 billion of the world's poorest people, including indigenous peoples with unique cultures.  History  In November 1971, the \\"States members\\" at the 16th session of the Conference of the Food and Agriculture Organization, voted to establish \\"World Forestry Day\\" on March 21 of each year. From 2007-2012, the Center for International Forestry Research (CIFOR) convened a series of six Forest Days, in conjunction with annual meetings of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change Conference of Parties. CIFOR organized these events on behalf of and in close cooperation with other members of the Collaborative Partnership on Forests (CPF). Following the International Year of Forests in 2011, the International Day of Forests was established by resolution of the United Nations General Assembly on November 28, 2012. = Forest Day = The catalyst for Forest Day was a casual conversation in Oxford, England, in February 2007, between two scientists who felt the world was underestimating the importance of forests in mitigating carbon emissions and saw a glaring need for the latest forestry research and thinking to inform global policy makers and UNFCCC negotiators. They did not foresee that the conference would become one of the most influential global events on forests and climate change today.  Forest Day 1: Bali, Indonesia (2007)  Journalists interview Center for International Forestry Research scientist Daniel Murdiyarso The inaugural Forest Day was one of the major events at United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) Conference of the Parties (COP) 13 in Bali, Indonesia on 8 December 2007. More than 800 people participated in Forest Day, including scientists, members of national delegations, and representatives from intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations. A major feature of Forest Day was four parallel panel discussions focusing on cross-cutting themes related to forests and climate change. These well-attended discussions examined such issues as setting baselines and methodological challenges in estimating forest carbon; markets and governance challenges associated with Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD+); adaptation to climate change; and equity-efficiency trade-offs. Areas of consensus emerging from the discussions included the following: * While there are significant methodological challenges to be surmounted, current methods are ‚Äúgood enough‚Äù to proceed with the design of mechanisms for reducing emissions from both deforestation and degradation. * Governance-related challenges pose the greatest risks for both international investors and local stakeholders in the context of new mechanisms. * Mechanisms should be simple, and should not repeat the mistakes of the Clean Development Mechanism. * The success of any REDD+ mechanism will depend on the political will to address the drivers of deforestation, including drivers that originate beyond the forestry sector. * Adaptation efforts need to shift from responsive to anticipatory, and should be focused on the most vulnerable, including forest-dependent people.  Forest Day 2: Pozna≈Ñ, Poland (2008)  IUFRO, CIFOR, ICRAF and PROFOR-World Bank, discussed the cross-cutting theme \\"adaptation of forests to climate change.\\" Panelists included (L-R): Bruno Locatelli, CIFOR; Gerhard Dieterle, World Bank; Markku Kanninen, CIFOR; Balgis Osman-Elasha, IUFRO; and Dennis Garrity, World Agroforestry Center (ICRAF). Building on the positive response to the first Forest Day, Forest Day 2, held in Pozna≈Ñ, Poland, on December 8, 2008, brought together nearly 900 participants to discuss the opportunities and challenges of bringing forests into global and national strategies for climate change adaptation and mitigation. Participants stressed the broad importance of forest ecosystems and noted that forests comprise an inter-dependent web of animals, plants and microorganisms, which together provide a wide range of goods and services beyond carbon sequestration. These include biodiversity conservation, rainfall generation and products that are crucial to the livelihoods of local forest dependent and indigenous peoples as well as to the economies of many countries. Those attending recognized the importance of building on the vast knowledge and experience that exists on sustainable forest management (SFM) and called on negotiators to consult with forest stakeholders as they develop climate policy. Frances Seymour, Director General of CIFOR delivered a summary of Forest Day 2 to Yvo de Boer, Executive Secretary of the UNFCCC. This summary was drafted by a committee representing members of the CPF, and included points of consensus as well as points of disagreement that emerged during the course of the day. Seymour highlighted the need to: * Include forests in climate mitigation and adaptation mechanisms and strategies * Ensure full inclusion and participation of civil society in international, regional, national and local decision-making processes * Recognize and respect the rights of women, poor people and Indigenous Peoples  Forest Day 3: Copenhagen, Denmark (2009)  Nearly 1500 stakeholders attended Forest Day 3 held in Copenhagen, Denmark on 13 December 2009 including 34 donors, government representatives, 88 journalists, 500 NGO representatives, indigenous leaders, 188 private sector representatives and hundreds of scientists and forestry experts. Their goal was to ensure that the design and implementation of forest-related climate mitigation and adaptation measures under consideration in the Climate Change Agreement would be effective, efficient and equitable. Although the UNFCCC failed to agree on binding targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions, significant progress was achieved in negotiating the outlines of a REDD+ mechanism. The Copenhagen Accord that emerged was the first international agreement to recommend that financial resources be raised to support REDD+. Australia, France, Japan, Norway, the United Kingdom and the United States offered a US$3.5 billion funding package for REDD+ preparation. Moreover, one of the indicators of the relevance of Forest Day ‚Äì its ability to attract world leaders ‚Äì became clear at Copenhagen. Key speakers at the event included: * Rajendra K. Pachauri, Chair of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change * Wangari Maathai, founder of the Green Belt Movement and Nobel laureate * Gro Harlem Brundtland, former Norwegian Prime Minister * Hilary Benn, the UK Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs * Sir Nicholas Stern, head of the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment. Former US President Bill Clinton appeared via video and Nobel Prize winner Elinor Ostrom was among the keynote speakers.  Forest Day 4: Canc√∫n, Mexico (2010)  Daniel Nepstad during Forest Day 4, Canc√∫n, Mexico Forest Day 4 took place on 5 December 2010 in Canc√∫n, Mexico. More than 1,500 people including over 280 Climate negotiators were in attendance. The theme for Forest Day 4 was \\"Time to Act,\\" highlighting the urgency of ensuring the survival of the world's forests, the biodiversity they embrace and the hundreds of millions of people who depend on them. The event served as a bridge between the International Year of Biodiversity and the 2011 International Year of Forests. Forest Day 4 was hosted by the Government of Mexico, through the National Forestry Commission (CONAFOR), CPF and CIFOR. President Felipe Calder√≥n Hinojosa, in his opening speech at FD4, told the plenary ‚Äú‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs time for all of us to push, and push hard for the full incorporation of REDD+ into a long-term international climate change agreement.‚Äù In a passionate plea, the Mexican president also stressed, ‚ÄúEither we change our way of life now, or climate change will change it for us.‚Äù Keynote speeches by Daniel Nepstad, Director of the International Program at the Amazon Environmental Research Institute and Mirna Cunningham Kain, Chair of the Center for Autonomy and Development of Indigenous Peoples, emphasized the critical needs for both sound forestry and climate change science, and pro-active engagement with indigenous people and forest-dependent communities as the de facto and de jure custodians of land and forest resources to secure equitable outcomes. UN Under Secretary-General for Economic and Social Affairs Sha Zukang provided an important forward- looking perspective, drawing participants' attention to the multiple benefits of forests and the International Year of Forests in 2011. Key issues discussed at FD4 included: * Harnessing REDD+ to sustainably manage forests and reduce poverty: The day saw the emergence of a robust consensus that the risks of no action on protecting the world's forests are far greater than the risks of moving ahead with less-than-perfect agreements. * REDD+ provides a key and cost-effective opportunity to mitigate climate change: FD4 participants reaffirmed that through REDD+ we may significantly reduce, remove and avoid global emissions at reasonable cost, as long as we take due account of the rights and livelihoods of indigenous people and local communities, biodiversity and ecosystem services, whilst assisting developing forest countries adapt to climate change. * The rights of indigenous people and forest-dependent communities need to be protected: Communities would be more willing to engage with REDD+ initiatives if they were to participate in all aspects of REDD+ design and implementation, if they are granted rights to the carbon in their forests, if they play a central role in the design of local rules, and if REDD+ does not permit more powerful competitors to threaten local interests. * Additional financing is needed to implement REDD+ at scale: An agreement on a robust and predictable system for mobilizing financial resources from various sources is needed, primarily in developed countries. This will be needed to stimulate and pay for early REDD+ action at scale, technology transfers, capacity building and the development of national and sub-national monitoring, reporting and verification (MRV) systems, among others. * Biodiversity conservation is a prerequisite for the success of REDD+: More than 90 percent of FD4 participants polled said that biodiversity safeguards are either ‚Äúvery important‚Äù or ‚Äúessential‚Äù for the success of REDD+, and more than 95 percent said that it is important to monitor co- benefits. * REDD+ and agricultural drivers of deforestation: FD4 participants proposed several options to increase agricultural intensification whilst reducing net annual rates of deforestation including: increasing production efficiencies; promoting multifunctional landscapes; directing REDD+ financing to increase efficiencies in agronomic practices; and shifting extensive production systems to low carbon landscapes. * Promoting synergies between climate change mitigation and adaptation across landscapes: More research is needed to explore linkages between adaptation and mitigation in forests at different scales. Two specific challenges ‚Äì agreement on monitoring, reporting and verification (MRV) systems, and continued improvements in forest governance were also discussed. * Strengthen linkages between national and subnational MRV systems for REDD+: Challenges remain for monitoring forest degradation and peatland emissions but these may be overcome with significant additional capacity building and technology transfer, including the application of novel technologies. Examples include Google's Earth Engine (demonstrated by Rebecca Moore, Head of Google's Global Outreach Program prior to the Closing Plenary of FD4), Open Data Kit and androids for forest biomass measurements with communities. * Improve accounting rules for forest management in developed countries: More comprehensive accounting on forests will be beneficial both for the climate and for forests. Participants acknowledged that this is a complex and controversial issue, but success in reaching agreement on new rules would help smooth the way for agreement on new emission reduction commitments by developing countries for the second commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol. * The success of REDD+ strategies and projects will depend on whether they influence governance reforms or are shaped by existing governance failures: The ability of developing countries to enhance the role of their forest resources in mitigating climate change is closely linked with their commitment to governance reform. There are also huge challenges to reform the embedded structures of past poor governance. However, the legality and legitimacy of REDD+ are likely to depend on a balance between central oversight and decentralized decision making, clear tenure and transparent and equitable benefit-sharing arrangements. * Reinforcing the UNFCCC momentum on forestry and climate change : A key challenge of COP16 in Canc√∫n is how existing mitigation and financing pledges made through the Copenhagen Accord can now be transformed into official commitments under the UNFCCC. This may require abandoning the ‚Äúnothing is agreed until everything is agreed‚Äù global climate change architecture approach to ensure that a balanced cluster of decisions can be made in negotiating areas that remain close to agreement. This will ensure that commitments can be translated into actions in 2011. = Comments = * Virgilio Viana, CEO of Amazonas Sustainable Foundation, Brazil: ‚ÄúForest Day has become a venue for in depth discussion relating to forests and climate change, filling a gap in the meeting spaces. A source of inspiration for policy making at national and international level.‚Äù * Yemi Katerere, UN REDD: ‚ÄúFD provides the forum, agenda and a theme to draw together practitioners, policy makers, researchers and NGOs involved in forestry. FD is the place to get the experts‚Äô view on forestry at COP... The CPF has a broad range of constituents; FD reflects this multi-faceted range of stakeholders.‚Äù * Felician Kilahama, Ministry of Natural Resources and Tourism, Tanzania: ‚ÄúFD is unique: It brings environmental stakeholders, policy makers, private sector, etc together. For some countries, FD provides a rare chance to interact internationally, exchange knowledge, lessons learned on forests and climate change.‚Äù * David Diaz, Ecosystem Marketplace (Forest Trends), USA: ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a lot of positive energy surrounding forestry right now and FD channels that energy. President Calderon‚Äôs presence has an impact. The participation of high profile figures means that other presidential/ministerial level people may get a louder voice or take an interest at that level.‚Äù * Tony la Vina, Dean, Ateneo School of Government, Manila University, Philippines: ‚ÄúFD is important because of the range of people who come: negotiators, practitioners, policy makers, advocates ‚Äì the range is impressive. Here you can help shape the agenda for forestry. I would like to see a strong appeal to negotiators that things are already running on the ground. There‚Äôs a sense of urgency. The negotiations need to be relevant to things already happening on the ground.‚Äù * Niels Elers Koch, President, International Union of Forest Research Organizations: ‚ÄúForest Day (FD) is the single most important science‚Äìpolicy interface in the forest sector, where researchers and policy makers meet.\\"  Forest Day 5: Durban, South Africa (2011)  The 2011 COP 17 was hosted by Durban, South Africa, from 28 November to 9 December 2011. Forest Day 5 took place on 4 December 2011 in Durban, South Africa. CIFOR convened the event, which was co-hosted by 11 members of the Collaborative Partnership on Forests and the Government of South Africa through the Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries. More than 1,100 people from 82 countries attended, including 214 official climate-change negotiators and 65 media representatives. The theme for Forest Day 5 was ‚ÄòFrom Policy to Practice‚Äô, aiming to inform the COP agenda and forest stakeholders on ways to implement the REDD+ agreement reached in Canc√∫n in 2010 to produce social and environmental benefits, and to integrate forests into adaptation strategies on the ground. Organisers gave special attention to issues relevant to sub-Saharan Africa, to REDD+ issues facing the humid tropical forests of the Congo Basin, and to the improved management and use of Africa's dry forests areas. The link between forests and food security was also one of the main themes of the day. The organisers of Forest Day 5 and Agriculture and Rural Development Day (which was held on 3 December 2012) coordinated in the months leading up to the events to identify opportunities for tie-ups between the two events. A number of joint, similar-themed discussion forums were held on climate-smart agriculture, agroforestry and food security. As in past years, Forest Day 5 attracted several high-level speakers. In all, more than 60 speakers and panellists took part in Forest Day 5, with six of the ten keynotes presented by women.  Forest Day 6: Doha, Qatar (2012)  The 2012 UNFCCC COP 18 was hosted by Doha, Qatar from 26 November to 7 December 2012. Forest Day 6 took place on the sidelines of COP 18, on 2 to 3 December 2012, and considered issues ranging from REDD+ financing to adaptation, desertification, reforestation and afforestation.Forest Day 6, CIFOR.

It was established during the last decades of the 15th century, after the movement of the seat from Strehaia (1491). The Great Ban of Craiova was the Viceroy of Lesser Wallachia and he was, as hierarchic order, the greatest Wallachian high official. His authority was extended to the area of Oltenia. Having the consent of the Wallachian ruler, the ban of Craiova could confiscate the fortune of one who made himself guilty of \\"betrayal\\". The ban of Craiova could punish by death the guilty persons. Since 1512, when the reign of Neagoe Basarab began, the Ban got similar powers to the hospodar in the territory on the right of Olt river. The title was held most by members of the Craiove≈üti family (from 1492 to 1532). The last headquarters of the Banate In the second half of 16th century, the institution met a moment of crisis, mainly due to aggressive attempts of the Turks to establish dominance over Wallachia. Oltenia had a high level of administrative, judicial and military independence, without any relation to central leadership of the country, except to pay tribute to the Wallachian ruler, who, in turn, sent it on to the Ottomans. The r√¥le of the institution increased during the rule of Michael the Brave. In 1761 the permanent residence of the ban was moved to Bucharest. Up until 1831, the Ban was the deputy of the voivode (Prince of Wallachia) in Oltenia.

He was the first Naval Academy alumnus to actively fight the policies against homosexuality in the services. After Mr. Berg's suit against the Navy, which had given him an other than honorable discharge as an ensign in 1976, the armed forces adopted a policy of generally granting honorable discharges to homosexuals. Biography Copy Berg was born on 10 July 1951 in Port Jefferson, New York. He was called Copy because he was so like his father, Commander Vernon E. Berg Jr., a Navy chaplain. He obtained a Naval & Marine Reserve appointment to U.S. Naval Academy. He graduated with the Class of 1974US Naval Academy Register of Alumni (2008) with a Bachelor of Science Degree. =Naval Academy= While at the Academy, Copy was known to be prolific at his art, which appeared in The Log Magazine, the Art and Printing Club posters, T-shirts, Beat Army buttons, Christmas dinner programs, and as centerfolds of programs. He could be seen dancing across the Stage of Mahan Hall in the Masqueraders' musicals. He is quoted as saying \\"It's not that a Midshipman can draw, write or sing well, its that a Midshipman can draw, write or sing at all.\\"Lucky Bag (1974) He sang in the Protestant Chapel Choir and Naval Academy Glee Club. =Time in the fleet= After graduation from the Naval Academy, Berg reported to his first ship, the , the Flagship for the U.S. Navy Sixth Fleet in the Mediterranean home ported in Gaeta, Italy.Gibson, p. 306 While at the Naval Academy, he met and fell in love with a civilian theatre director working at the Academy, E. Lawrence Gibson. They were married in a small, private ceremony in New York's Central Park in 1975. At Copy's urging, Lawrence accepted a job teaching Naval personnel stationed on the Little Rock. When they began sharing Copy's apartment in Gaeta they discovered they had already been surveilled by Naval intelligence for five months. Their travails up through the Naval hearing were memorialized in Gibson's memoir Get Off My Ship: Ensign Berg v. the US Navy, published by Viking Press in 1978. The couple settled on Dean Street in Brooklyn, NY and were interviewed together on WBAI radio in 1979. They eventually split. Gibson died of natural causes in 2012. =Discharge and trials= As a result of the legal action, his discharge was upgraded to honorable in 1977. In 1978, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit ruled that Berg and former Technical Sergeant Leonard P. Matlovich of the Air Force had been unfairly discharged, although it did not reinstate them, as both had sought. Berg was discharged after an investigation revealed he was in a gay relationship. =Life as an artist= After departing the U.S. Navy, he and Gibson moved to Brooklyn, New York, where Berg earned a master's degree in design from Pratt Institute and became a rising star in the New York arts scene and a gay rights activist. He died of AIDS in Manhattan on Wednesday 27 January 1999. Legacy 67 linear feet (161 boxes) of the Copy Berg Papers are held by the New York Public Library, Manuscripts and Archives Division.

Opened in 1861, it was the first church to be built outside the city's old fortification ring when it was decommissioned and new residential neighbourhoods sprung up outside the former city gates. History A visualization of the planned St. John's Church by Theodor S√∏rensen in 856 The decommissioning of Copenhagen's Bastioned Fortifications was a gradual and prolonged process. They had long been under pressure from the fast-growing city and the British bombadement in 1807 during the Battle of Copenhagen showed they had become outdated. By 1850 a decision had still not formally been taken but in 1852 the Demarcation Line, which heavily restricted the access to build within a certain zone outside the fortifications, was confined to the area inside the Lakes, and in 1855 the new times were further anticipated with the demolition of the Northern City Gate. Frederik VII's arrival for the consecration ceremony In 1861 construction of St. John's Church began on land provided by the city on the old Blegdam Common. The architect was who had recently graduated from the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts. St. John's Church painted by Ferdinand Richardt in 1869 The new church was consecrated on 25 August 1861 at a ceremony attended by King Frederik VII. Incidental music in the form of a cantata with text by Bernhard Severin Ingemann and music by Emil Hartmann was performed at the event. The new St. John's Parish, which was disjoined from Trinitatis and Our Lady's Parishes, covered an extensive area which included all of N√∏rrebro and √òsterbro and reached all the way to Hellerup and Br√∏nsh√∏j. However, still sparsely populated, it only had about 16,000 inhabitants. The church's first pastor, Rudolf Frimodt, launched a campaign for more churches in the new districts of Copenhagen which, over the course of seven years, from 1874 to 1880, led to four new churches: St. Stephen's, St. James's, St. Paul's and St. Mathew's. By 1885, even with St. Stephen's and St. James's Parishes in the meantime disjoined, the population of St. John's Parish had grown to 60,000. Architecture The church seen from Sankt Hans Torv St. John's is a Neo- Gothic building in red brick. Standing 54 metres high, the tower has a copper- clad spire. Theodor S√∏rensen's style was greatly influenced by Michael Gottlieb Bindesb√∏ll, and the three-gable motif of St. John's is also seen in Bindesb√∏ll's . St. John's was the first church in the Copenhagen area to revive Medieval features such as crow-stepped gables and pointed-arched windows. Its style was, on its completion, unusual in Denmark but soon won great popularity. The church was completed the same year as Copenhagen University Library, another building which combined red bricks and a Neo- Gothic design. Interior and furnishings The interior of the church is dominated by light-coloured, marbled walls and columns. Painted by J. L. Lund in 1818 in Rome, the altarpiece depicts the Resurrection of Jesus. With 54 stops the church's organ is one of the largest in Copenhagen. Surroundings The J. C. R. Frimodt memorial The J. C. R. Frimodt memorial The areaoutside the church is confined by low walls in red brick. It is dominated by lawns and flower beds. Jens Christian Rudolf Frimodt, the first pastor at the church, is buried outside the church. The headstone features a bronze relief portrait of him by August Saabye. His wife is also buried at the site. Axel Frederik Laurits Rindom (1838‚Äì1919), a later pastor at the church, is also commemorated by a stone outside the church. St. John's Church today Located on Blegdamsvej, between Sankt Hans Torv and the Panum Institute, St. John's remains the largest church in the N√∏rrebro district. It is a parish church within the Church of Denmark. In December 2008, St. John's Parish combined with Simon's Parish to form Simon-St. John's Parish. The chapel at Rigshospitalet also belongs to the parish. The church plays host to the student priest for University of Copenhagen's faculties of Health Sciences and Science, both located nearby.

Plot Jacques Montaigne is a French college student who heads to Los Angeles not only for school, but to help train an Olympic team of fighters. He shows up a few days late (for a rendezvous with a girlfriend in France) and is given a list of houses where they may have rooms for rent. He comes across to a house where single mother Maria Ordonez lives with her son Martin and her mother. Maria tells Jacques that they were supposed to have taken their house off the listings due to being in an unsafe neighborhood. However, Maria decides to let Jacques stay. That night, on his way to a college social, Jacques finds himself confronted by two neighbors, Chuy and Jesus. Brandishing a small knife, Jacques warns the duo not to mess with him. At the mixer, Jacques gets the attention of fellow student Sarah as well as the graduate dean, who is unimpressed with him. As Jacques walks Sara home, they are stopped by Jesus and Chuy, who are with their gang boss, Angel and other gang members. When some of the gang members start to cause trouble, Jacques intervenes and uses his martial arts skills. This scares Angel and the gang away. However, when Jacques returns to the Ordonez home, he is met again by Jesus, Chuy, and more of Angel's gang. An attempt to ambush Jacques leads them to a nearby bush, where the gang members beat themselves up while Jacques walks away. This impresses Frank, a former war vet who lives across the street, but is also upset at the fact that he's paralyzed from the waist down from the war. It's been revealed that Angel wants to recruit Martin to his gang. When Martin constantly rebuffs Angel, it only makes him even more mad and threats soon follow. Jacques decides he must help Martin out of his ordeal. During an attack at the house, Martin's grandmother passes out from the stress and is taken to the hospital. With Maria working, Jacques decides to take Martin to a local martial arts school run by good friend Henry, who is the one who convinced the Olympic Committee to bring Jacques to L.A. Henry knew Martin's father Pedro, who had protested vehemently against Angel and his gang and was ultimately murdered by Angel, which Martin doesn't know. Jacques decides to teach Martin some self-defense along with Henry and tells him the ramifications of what can and will happen should Martin decide to join Angel's gang. Upon returning home, Martin is in shock to learn his grandmother had passed. It was because Angel's goons once again started trouble and Frank tells Jacques that she ended up having a massive heart attack, yelling for Martin. Maria has learned what Jacques had been doing and she realizes that she can trust him and divulges the truth about Pedro's death and why the streets are no longer safe. When Maria and Jacques are shot at by Angel and his gang, Jacques turns to Henry and his wife to help protect Maria and Martin. Henry finds a connection with Mr. Park, a Korean gang boss who knows of all the gangs. He warns Henry and Jacques that Angel can be intimidated, but it is his gunfire that gives him his power. On his way to campus, Angel sends men to get rid of Jacques but they fail. Jacques has had enough and wages war on Angel and his crew. He goes as far as killing Angel's female driver to send him a message. However, Angel declares war and begins with a vicious assault on Maria, who is taken to the hospital. Martin, having had enough, goes back to his house and arms himself with a shotgun. With the help of Frank, who arms himself with a machine gun, the duo begin to shoot at any of Angel's gang who invade Martin's house. When Angel and the rest of the gang show up, they slowly begin their assault. However, just when Martin runs out of ammo, one gang member throws a stick of dynamite but is stopped by a returning Jacques. Jacques has also brought Henry and some of Henry's martial arts students. They begin their own assault, using their martial arts skills to dispatch most of Angel's gang. Jacques puts dynamite in Angel's car and Angel narrowly escapes when the car explodes. Jacques and Angel begin to fight and just when Jacques is about to knock Angel out, Henry convinces him that it should be Martin who should fight Angel. Angel puts up much of the fight but Martin, finally having the advantage, beats Angel and kicks him while he is on the ground repeatedly until he is unconscious. Jacques finally tells Martin he did what he had to and the police show up, including a helicopter whose light shines on Angel.

Life The son of Roger Laurence, armorer, he was born 18 March 1670, and admitted on the royal mathematical foundation to Christ's Hospital in April 1679, from the ward of St Botolph, Bishopsgate, on the presentation of Sir John Laurence, merchant, of London. On 22 November 1688 he was discharged and bound for seven years to a merchant vessel. He was afterwards employed by the firm of Lethieullier, merchants of London, and was sent by them to Spain, where he remained for some years. He studied divinity, became dissatisfied with his baptism among dissenters, and was informally baptised at Christ Church, Newgate Street, on 31 March 1708, by John Bates, reader at the church. Laurence's act attracted attention, and was disapproved by the Bishop of London. Laurence then published his Lay Baptism Invalid, which gave rise to a controversy. It was discussed at a dinner of thirteen bishops at Lambeth Palace on 22 April 1712, and a declaration was drawn up in favour of the validity of baptisms performed by non-episcopally ordained ministers. This was offered to Convocation on 14 May 1712, but rejected by the lower house after some debate. Through the influence of Charles Wheatly, then Fellow of St John's College, Oxford an honorary degree of M.A. was conferred on Laurence by the University of Oxford on 16 July 1713. He was ordained deacon on 30 November, and priest on 19 December 1714, by the nonjuring bishop George Hickes. In 1716‚Äì18 nonjuring ordinations took place in Lawrence's chapel on College Hill, City of London. He was consecrated a bishop by Archibald Campbell in 1733; but his consecration, performed by a single bishop, as not recognised by other nonjurors. A new faction was started, of which Campbell, Laurence and Thomas Deacon were the leaders, Thomas Brett being at the head of the original body of nonjurors. Laurence died on 6 March 1736 at Kent House, Beckenham, the country residence of the Lethieulliers, aged nearly 66, and was buried at Beckenham on 11 March. In his will, made 29 February 1736, he is described as 'of the parish of St. Saviours in Southwark.' He left all his property to his wife, Jane Laurence, whose maiden name was Holman. Works He published: * 'Lay Baptism Invalid, or an Essay to prove that such Baptism is Null and Void when administer'd in opposition to the Divine Right of the Apostolical Succession. By a Lay Hand' (anon.), London, 1708. Editions, with various alterations, appeared in 1709, 1712, 1714, 1723, and 1725, and a reprint, edited by W. Scott, in 1841. The book was attacked by Gilbert Burnet in a sermon (7 November 1710); by Bishop William Fleetwood in an anonymous pamphlet; by Bishop William Talbot in a charge of 1712; and by Joseph Bingham in his 'Scholastical History of Lay Baptism,' (1712). Laurence was supported by George Hickes and Thomas Brett. * 'Sacerdotal Powers, or the Necessity of Confession, Penance, and Absolution. Together with the Nullity of Unauthoriz'd Lay Baptism asserted' (anon., in reply to the Bishop of Salisbury), London, 1711; 2nd edit. 1713; a reprint of the first four chapters was edited by William Gresley in 1852. * 'Dissenters' and other Unauthoriz'd Baptisms Null and Void, by the Articles, Canons, and Rubricks of the Church of England' (in answer to Fleetwood), London, 1712; 2nd edit. 1713; 3rd edit. 1810; reprint by William Scott with 'Lay Baptism Invalid,' 1841. * 'The Bishop of Oxford's Charge consider'd.' * 'The Second Part of Lay Baptism Invalid,' in which he tries to prove his position from Bingham's 'Scholastical History,' London, 1713. Bingham replied in a second part of his 'Scholastical History.' Laurence rejoined in the next. * 'Supplement to the 1st and 2nd Parts of Lay Baptism Invalid' (assailing also White Kennett) (anon.), London, 1714. Bingham again replied, but was not answered. A bibliography of the controversy respecting lay baptism and Laurence's position is given in Warwick Elwin's 'Minister of Baptism,' pp. 258 et seq. * 'Mr. Leslie's Defence from some ...

Life Born in London on 2 May 1813 (13 May according to another source), he was the second son of Thomas Scott, merchant, of Clement's Lane and Newington, Surrey. In October 1827 he was entered at Merchant Taylors' School, and on 14 June 1831 he matriculated at The Queen's College, Oxford, as Michel exhibitioner. He was Michel scholar in 1834‚Äì8, and graduated B.A. in 1835 and M.A. in 1839. Ordained deacon in 1836 and priest in 1837, he held three curacies, the last of which was under William Dodsworth at Christ Church, Albany Street, London. In 1839 he was made perpetual curate of Christ Church, Hoxton, where he remained till 1860, and was widely known as ‚ÄòScott of Hoxton.‚Äô In 1860 he was appointed by Lord-chancellor John Campbell, 1st Baron Campbell vicar of St Olave's, Jewry, with St Martin Pomeroy. Scott was an active member of the high-church party. When in 1841 the Christian Remembrancer was set up, he was made co-editor with Francis Garden. In 1844, when it became a quarterly, James Bowling Mozley for a short time succeeded Garden, but during a large part of the life of the paper, which ended in 1868, Scott was sole editor. He felt deeply the conversion of John Henry Newman to Catholicism, though personally unacquainted with him. Scott took a leading part in the agitation following the Gorham judgment. His ‚ÄòLetter to the Rev. Daniel Wilson,‚Äô 1850, a reply to Daniel Wilson's bitter attack on the Tractarians, passed through four editions. In 1846 he joined Edward Pusey and his associates in their efforts to prevent the ordination at St Paul's Cathedral of Samuel Gobat, the Lutheran bishop-elect of Jerusalem. Ten years later he was, with Pusey, John Keble, and others, one of the eighteen clergy who signed the protest against Archbishop John Bird Sumner's condemnation of Archdeacon George Anthony Denison. Scott's advice was sought by the bishops Henry Phillpotts and Walter Kerr Hamilton. Richard William Church was a close friend. He was among the founders of the Saturday Review, to which he contributed, and was a member of Mr. William Gladstone's election committees at Oxford. He was one of the prime movers in the formation in 1848 of the London Union on Church Matters, and from 1859 onwards was chairman of the committee of the Ecclesiological Society. He was one of the chief advisers of Henry Hart Milman and Henry Longueville Mansel in the work of restoration at St Paul's Cathedral, acting for some time as honorary secretary of the restoration committee. In 1858 Scott was elected president of Sion College, and next year published a continuation of the ‚ÄòAccount‚Äô of the College by John Russell. Scott died on 11 January 1872 of spinal disease, and was buried in Highgate cemetery. He married Margaret Beloe, granddaughter of William Beloe, and had three sons and two daughters. One of his sons was the critic Clement Scott. Works In 1841 he edited, with additions and illustrations, Roger Laurence's Lay Baptism invalid; and in 1847, for the Library of Anglo-Catholic Theology, the works of William Laud in seven volumes. Several of his sermons are in A. Watson's Collection. His Plain Words for Plain People, 1844, censured the Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge for garbling theological works.

It was written by the show's executive producers, Michael Poryes and Steven Peterman. It originally aired on January 16, 2011 in the United States on the Disney Channel, and later aired in Canada on March 18, 2011 on the Family Channel. The episode title is a reference to the Hannah Montana song \\"Wherever I Go\\". The episode also marks Mitchel Musso's second and final appearance as Oliver Oken in the show's fourth season. Plot Miley gets an offer from Steven Spielberg and Tom Cruise to star in a movie. However, filming is in Paris, and will take a year, making her incapable of going to college with her best friend, Lilly. She keeps this from Lilly, and tries to get Lilly to come to the decision of not wanting to go to college with Miley, when they drive to Stanford University for a weekend orientation. Lilly, however, is just happy to be able to go to school with her best friend. Finally, Miley reveals the movie deal to Lilly, and they get into an argument, where Lilly says to Miley that she would never want to go anywhere with her again. On the car ride home, Lilly further declares that she is moving back in with her father. Distraught, Miley discusses her dilemma with Jackson, and he suggests that Miley should have asked for Lilly to join her in Paris. Miley then hugs Jackson, and Robby declares it a touching moment for him. Miley realizes that the real reason Lilly was upset was because they have done everything together, and Miley didn't ask Lilly to come with her to Paris. Miley then asks for Lilly to come with her to Paris, and they both decide to go to Paris together. Miley and Lilly's respective boyfriends, Jesse and Oliver, meet up with them at the airport to see them before their trip. Oliver gives Lilly some key words that force her to second guess her decision. Before getting onto the plane, Lilly tells Miley that she has decided to go to college after all, even if it means being without Miley. Miley and Lilly begin their lives apart backed by a duet sung by the two actresses. The music eventually centers in Lilly's dorm where she gets a knock on her door. She opens the door to reveal Miley, who declares, \\"I'm Miley, I'm your new roommate.\\" Miley tells Lilly that there will always be movies, concerts, and tours for her to do, but she will only have one chance to go to college with her best friend, therefore implying that she decided not to do the movie. The two hug as the camera pans away from them and we see a close-up of the collage of Miley and Lilly with a fade to black, and then a montage of images from the course of the show is displayed through the credits with the song \\"I'll Always Remember You\\" as the series ends. =Subplot= Jackson struggles to keep up with his girlfriend Siena's bikini model lifestyle, as he feels inadequate in comparison. He makes several attempts at jobs to receive more money to buy Siena a nice gift, including demonstrating a snake, and working for Rico again. When he buys her a nice necklace, she buys him a car. Distraught, Jackson discusses his dilemma with Miley, and she gives him a pep talk. Rico realizes he likes Jackson, and finds him a dream job, as a video game tester. Rico and Jackson finally admit that while they may fight, they are also close friends. Later, while Jackson is working from a hot tub, Siena comments on how the banter between Jackson and Miley comes off as mean, but Jackson explains to her that it is simply how they show their affection. =Alternate ending= Included in the Hannah Montana Forever: Final Season DVD was an alternate ending to the episode. The alternate ending picks up from the airport scene, where Miley and Lilly say their goodbyes as Lilly goes to Stanford and Miley goes to Paris to work with Spielberg and Cruise. The camera then pans away from Miley and Lilly hugging and zooms onto a little girl sitting in a chair, holding a Hannah Montana doll. The text: \\"Tennessee: Twelve Years Ago\\" appears and shows a young girl portraying young Miley Cyrus playing with a Barbie doll, singing a song about herself becoming a famous rockstar. Miley's real- life parents, Billy Ray Cyrus and Tish Cyrus, walk into the room, tell her that its past her bedtime and tuck her in. Miley then says, \\"I'm going to be a rockstar one day, just like Daddy.\\" Then Tish tells her that as long as she keeps believing in herself, she can do anything she wants to do and Billy Ray tells Miley that someday her dream will come true. The scene eventually shifts into a photograph of the real life Miley and her parents, suggesting that like Miley Stewart, Miley Cyrus imagined herself being famous one day and her dream indeed came true.

He is a senior lecturer in Political Theory at London Metropolitan University and Director of its Faith and Citizenship Programme. He is best known as a founder of Blue Labour, a term he coined in 2009.  Early life and education  Glasman was born in Walthamstow, north-east London into a Jewish family and brought up in Palmers Green. His father Coleman \\"Collie\\" Glasman, a Labour Zionist, had a small toy manufacturing business that eventually collapsed while his mother Rivie Glasman, the daughter of a poor family from Stamford Hill, was a lifelong Labour supporter. Glasman was educated at Clapton Jewish Day School (now Simon Marks Jewish Primary School) and the Jews' Free School, where he won an exhibition to study Modern History at St Catharine's College, Cambridge. A trumpeter, he became a jazz musician for four years and then gained an MA in Political Philosophy at the University of York and a PhD at the European University Institute in Florence with a thesis on the German social market economy which was published in 1996 under the title Unnecessary Suffering. Glasman cites political thinkers from Aristotle to the Hungarian economist and sociologist Karl Polanyi as major influences on his politics.  Career  Glasman was a professor at Johns Hopkins University's European centre in Bologna. After his father's death in 1995, he returned to the United Kingdom. He is a senior lecturer in Political Theory at London Metropolitan University and Director of its Faith and Citizenship Programme. According to his website, \\"his research interests focus on the relationship between citizenship and faith and the limits of the market\\". On 19 November 2010, it was announced that he would be created a life peer. Prior to his elevation, he worked for ten years with London Citizens and through this developed an expertise in community organising. On 4 February 2011, he was created Baron Glasman of Stoke Newington and of Stamford Hill in the London Borough of Hackney and was introduced into the House of Lords on 8 March 2011, where he sits on the Labour benches. His elevation to the Lords was considered something of a surprise, with Glasman admitting that he was \\"completely shocked\\" by the appointment.  Political opinions  Having joined the Labour Party in 1976, Glasman re-engaged with Labour politics after his mother's death in 2008. Glasman coined the term Blue Labour, defined by Glasman as a \\"small-c\\" conservative form of socialism which advocates a return to what Glasman believed were the roots of the pre-1945 Labour Party by encouraging the political involvement of voluntary groups from trades union through churches to football clubs. Blue Labour has argued that Labour should embrace patriotism and a return to community values based on trades union and voluntary groups which he claims was evident in early Labour politics, but it was lost after 1945 with the rise of the welfare state. In a critical assessment of Glasman's political philosophy, Alan Finlayson asserts that Glasman emphasises ethical social institution rather than moral individualism, criticises commodification and the money economy and seeks to revive the concept of the \\"common good\\" at the forefront of British politics. Glasman's role in the creation and promotion of Blue Labour is described in the book Tangled Up in Blue (2011) by Rowenna Davis. Glasman himself says that in developing the concept of Blue Labour he was inspired by the Bund, the secular Jewish Socialist Party in Lithuania, Poland and Russia founded in 1897; and the writings of 19th century German rabbi Samson Raphael Hirsch. He also points out the connections between the living wage and the demand of the Jewish trades union in the East End for a family wage. In April 2011, Glasman called on the Labour Party to establish a dialogue with sympathisers of the far-right English Defence League (EDL) in order to challenge their views and \\"to build a party that brokers a common good, that involves those people who support the EDL within our party. Not dominant in the party, not setting the tone of the party, but just a reconnection with those people that we can represent a better life for them, because that's what they want\\". In July 2011, Glasman called for some immigration to be temporarily halted and for the right of free movement of labour, a key provision of the Treaty of Rome, to be abrogated, dividing opinion among Labour commentators. Emphasising that Israel should not be \\"demonised\\", Glasman says he does not like Israel, where in his opinion \\"terrible things [are] going on\\", adding that \\"the Jewish settler movement is as bad as Islamic jihadist supremacists. What I see with jihadists and settlers is nationalist domination, and yuck is my general verdict\\". However, he accepted the visiting professorship he was offered by Haifa University, telling The Jewish Chronicle: \\"If people I know say they want to boycott Israel, I say they should start by boycotting me\\". At the 2016 Limmud conference, he suggested the Labour Party's antisemitism harked back to Jewish Marxists, who wanted to \\"liberate Jews\\" from their Judaism. In a House of Lords debate on the European Union (Notification of Withdrawal) Bill on 20 February 2017, Lord Glasman revealed he had campaigned for Britain to leave the European Union in the 2016 referendum.  Personal life  Glasman is a supporter of Jewish tradition, regularly goes to a synagogue on Shabbat and is a founder member of Stoke Newington New Shul, a congregation affiliated with the Masorti Movement. His wife Catherine, who is not Jewish, has also become \\"engaged with Judaism\\". According to The Jewish Chronicle, they keep kosher and celebrate Shabbat. He plays the trumpet and smokes rolled-up cigarettes. He lives with his wife and their four children in a flat over a clothing shop in Stoke Newington in north London.

The group was made up of Portobagos from Maryland, Patawomecks from the Northern Neck area, Matchotics, and Rappahannock tribe members along with others. The original Nantaughtacund were noted by that name living on the Rappahannock River by John Smith on 1608, represented on his map as a \\"king's house\\". They occupied land on opposite sides of the Rappahannock in present-day Caroline and King George counties. The town of Nanzemond was recorded by 1654, and the towns of Warisquock and Ausaticon in 1655. The Portobacco town was south of the river, about where Smith's \\"king's house\\" was shown. The only surviving deed for a land sale by the tribe was signed by their weroance Attamahune in 1662. The Matchotic (Mattehatique) formed a section of them on the 1669 census. In that census, the Nanzatico counted fifty bowmen, and the Portobacco sixty. In 1680, the weroance Pattanochus signed onto an annexe of the 1677 Treaty of Middle Plantation for both groups. In 1684, the Colony ordered the 70 total remaining Rappahannock to join with the Portobacco, for their protection against Seneca Iroquois raids. These groups were allied with the Doeg tribe, who held land just upriver in Caroline as late as 1720. In the 1697 census, both the Nanzatico and Portobacco groups were counted together with 40 bowmen, and in 1702 they had 30 bowmen between them.Helen Rountree, Pocahontas's People p. 119-121. In April 1704, the Nanzatico complained to the House of Burgesses that English settlers were encroaching onto their remaining enclave, on both sides of the river. These complaints were never acted upon by the Virginia Colony, and on August 30, a war party of ten Nanzatico men killed one of the encroaching settlers, John Rowley, and his family. A company of the Richmond County militia hunted down and captured 49 Nanzaticos and tried them for murder. 5 men were hanged for the murder, and all the other Nanzaticos over age 12 were sold into slavery in the West Indies under a 1665 law that held communities responsible for any murders of English settlers. Children were forced to work as servants for officials of the Virginia Colony. The affiliated Portobacco / Rappahannock tribe were not deported at this time, and were noted by Robert Beverley in 1705 as living north of the river with five bowmen. The Name Nanzatico means warrior chief. Notes  References  *Gwenda Morgan, \\"Sold into Slavery in Retribution against the Nanziattico Indians,\\" Virginia Cavalcade, 33 (Spring 1984):168-73.

The manga was published in Japan by Libre Publishing. It is licensed in North America by 801 Media, as one of 801 Media's earliest titles. Reception Holly Ellingwood characterises the manga as being more explicit than previous yaoi manga releases, but feels that there is enough character development to carry the story and render it romantic. Hannah Santiago, writing for the appendix to Manga: The Complete Guide, felt that the romance was realistically developed and appreciated the equality in their relationship. June Shimonshi, writing for Library Journal describes the manga as \\"formulaic\\" and as being solely driven by sex, finding the word balloons and panels difficult to follow. Shimonshi recommends Love Mode and the Finder series for those looking for explicit yaoi instead of this manga.

He associated in the liberal circles of the city, with the likes of Serafin Baroja and Manterola, in the period extending between the two main Carlist Wars. The imprint of his life's experiences, including a number of accidents and failed love affairs, are evident in his poetry. He is considered a Romantic in style, and was an enthusiastic reader of Spanish romantic poets such as Becquer. He worked also in the bertso paperak style, producing poems on sheets of paper that could be sold loose and sung by the people, some of which caught on in popular culture. Bein batian Loyolan (spelling of that period) remains one of his most memorable poems, nowadays sung to John Denver's tune Annie's song popularised by the local music band Egan in the 1980s.

Upon secession, the faction stated that it aimed to establish itself as a separate \\"centrist, Zionist, and democratic\\" political party. It was founded on the vestiges of the Third Way party. Nine days after Barak announced his retirement from politics, it was made public that Independence would not take part in the 2013 Knesset elections. History The secession was seen as a preemptive move before other Labor MKs acted on their ultimatum to either let Labor leave Benjamin Netanyahu's coalition due to the stalling of a peace process or force Labor's then-chairman Barak to face the consequences within his own party. Splitting the Labor Party enabled Barak to keep a faction of Labor MKs loyal to him within Netanyahu's coalition, preventing the departure of all 13 Labor MKs from the coalition. As of 17 January 2011, the coalition had the support of 66 out of 120 MKs, as compared to 74 prior to that. Since Labor was often an unreliable coalition partner in Knesset voting, the reduced number of MKs did not increase the risk of a no-confidence vote. Netanyahu was singled out by analysts as the biggest winner from the split,Barak saved Netanyahu Ynetnews, 17 January 2011Netanyahu: Barak's split from Labor strengthens Israel's government Haaretz, 17 January 2011 and was reported to have been involved in the behind-the-scenes making of the political deal.Behind the split: Deal between Barak and Netanyahu Yediot Ahronot 17 January 2011 Barak said that he was tired of infighting within Labor as he accused the rest of the Labor of \\"moving too far to the dovish end of the political spectrum.\\" The more leftist faction was also wary of Barak's closeness to the Prime Minister Netanyahu. Daniel Ben-Simon left the Labor party in protest against Barak's decision to stay with the government. MK Einat Wilf mentioned in the press conference: \\"Not all is our fault, some of it is the Palestinians' fault\\", referring to the argument leading up to the departure of Independence from the Labor Party.Coalition factions want the portfolios of the Labour Ministers that quit Maariv (video), 17 January 2011 Wilf also said that the party could not stay united because one faction was moving towards the \\"far left of Israeli politics,\\" and the other side believed the current government was an effective partnership. However, the remaining members of Labor condemned the move. Eitan Cabel said it would \\"destroy the party,‚Äù whilst Shelly Yachimovich called it \\"a corrupt and opportunistic move, designed to save Barak's seat in the government. He has brought a catastrophe upon Labor.\\" Daniel Ben-Simon had stated prior to the split that he would become an independent MK because of Labor's continued position in the government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Avishai Braverman, Minister of Minorities, and Isaac Herzog, Minister of Social Affairs, also intended to resign following the split. In a move to avoid the months of bureaucracy involved in registering a new party, Barak negotiated a takeover of the Third Way with its leader Avigdor Kahalani. The Third Way had held seats in the Knesset between 1996 and 1999, and although had effectively ceased functioning after losing them in the 1999 elections, it had remained a registered party.Barak readies to launch Independence Party Yediot Ahronot, 9 May 2011 The Knesset Committee approved the request of Independence to take over the Third Way party, a decision needed for it to receive funding from the state.◊°◊ô◊¢◊™ ◊î◊¢◊¶◊û◊ê◊ï◊™ ◊î◊ï◊§◊õ◊™ ◊ú◊û◊§◊ú◊í◊î, Arutz Sheva, 13 April 2011 The founding conference of the party was held in May 2011 with eighty members in attendance.

She took him on a tour of England and Scotland in 1848, and took charge of the disposal of his effects and manuscripts after his death in 1849. While there is no evidence they were lovers, she was often referred to, after Chopin's death, as \\"Chopin's widow\\". Life Stirling was born Jean Wilhelmina Stirling as the youngest of 13 children of John Stirling of Kippendavie,bnet at Kippenross House, near Dunblane in Perthshire, and was descended from a noble Scottish family. Her mother died when she was 12, her father when she was 16. The inheritance made her a wealthy young woman. She was then placed under the charge of her widowed sister, Mrs Katherine Erskine, aged 29. She was popular and very pretty; she was said to have declined over 30 marriage proposals. From 1826, she and her sister divided their social life between Scotland and Paris. She involved herself not only in music and the arts, but also in subjects such as prison reform, homeopathy, and the Protestant movement. The pianist Lindsay Sloper claimed to have been the one to introduce her to Chopin,Jean-Jacques Eigeldinger, Chopin: Pianist And Teacher As Seen By His Pupils (Cambridge University Press, 1986), p. 180. perhaps in 1842 or 1843. She became his pupil immediately. Chopin does not mention her until 1844. That she was a talented pianist was evident from Chopin's remark to her, \\"One day you‚Äôll play very, very well.\\" Towards the end of his life he even entrusted one of his own pupils, Vera Rubio, to her tutoring. In 1844 he dedicated his two Nocturnes, Op. 55 to her. She also expressed a desire to learn the cello, and so Chopin referred her to his collaborator, Auguste Franchomme. Jane Stirling worked with Chopin in assembling seven bound volumes of the French editions of most of his works, and in compiling a thematic index. These volumes were later used by the French musicologist and Chopin biographer √âdouard Ganche to establish the Oxford original edition of Chopin.The Oxford original edition of Fr√©d√©ric Chopin (Oxford University Press, 1928-1932). However, whether Chopin intended this collection to serve as a basis for a revised collected edition of his music is an open question. She also became his secretary, agent and business manager. She arranged his concert at the Salle Pleyel on 16 February 1848, and also attended to the heating, the ventilation, and the flowers. The concluding item of the concert was the Barcarole in F-sharp major, but Chopin was too exhausted to complete the final section. After managing to walk unaided to his dressing room, he collapsed in Jane Stirling's arms. This was to prove his final Paris concert. There had been plans for another concert there in March, but on 23 February a revolution broke out, many people fled the city, and Chopin was suddenly deprived of his livelihood. Jane and her sister suggested that Chopin perform a series of concerts in England. He was ill and did not want to travel, but as he was in need of the money that such a tour would provide for him, he agreed. They left for London on 20 April 1848. Through Jane Stirling he was introduced to the cr√®me of British society. He played at a private function on 15 May which Queen Victoria and Prince Albert attended (but he was never invited to play for them at Buckingham Palace, as is sometimes claimed). By August, the London season being at an end, he accepted an invitation from Jane Stirling to visit her homeland of Scotland. Near Edinburgh, they all stayed at Calder House, the castle of Lord Torphichen, the ladies' brother-in-law. (Calder House was where in 1556 John Knox had first celebrated communion.) He went on to give a \\"very select\\" concert in Glasgow,\\"Glasgow Constitutional\\", cited in Audrey Evelyn Bone, Jane Wilhelmina Stirling 1804-1859 (Self-published, 1960), p. 77. staying with Stirling's sister Ann at Johnstone Castle. Being dragged from one wealthy relative to another, and from city to city, all the time meeting many people with whom he could not converse (he spoke only French and Polish) only made Chopin's physical condition worse. In Manchester, on 28 August, he played three pieces, but was so weak he had to be carried on and off the stage. All his expenses throughout the tour were paid by Jane. It was during this tour, in late October 1848 in Edinburgh, at the home of Dr Adam ≈Åyszczy≈Ñski, a Polish physician with whom he stayed for a number of days, that Chopin wrote his last will and testament ‚Äì \\"a kind of disposition to be made of my stuff in the future, if I should drop dead somewhere,\\" he wrote to his friend Wojciech Grzyma≈Ça.Zdzis≈Çaw Jachimecki, \\"Chopin, Fryderyk Franciszek\\", Polski s≈Çownik biograficzny (Polish Biographical Dictionary), Krak√≥w, Polska Akademia Umiejƒôtno≈õci (Polish Academy of Learning), volume 3, 1937, p. 424. Although she was almost six years older than Chopin (she was born in July 1804, the same month as George Sand), it was generally rumoured at this time that Chopin and Stirling were shortly to be engaged. This never happened; indeed, there is no indication in any of Chopin's letters that he ever felt any amorous feelings for her. On the contrary, she often bored him. He said to a friend, \\"They have married me to Miss Stirling; she might as well marry death.\\" He referred to both Stirling and Mrs Erskine as \\"mes braves √âcossaises\\", and was frequently exasperated by their over-solicitude and habit of bringing him religious pamphlets.Jean-Jacques Eigeldinger, Chopin: Pianist And Teacher As Seen By His Pupils (Cambridge University Press, 1986), p. 181. His final concert in Britain was on 16 November at London's Guildhall, where he played despite being desperately ill. They returned to Paris on 24 November accompanied by mountainous debts, which Jane Stirling paid anonymously. Chopin on His Deathbed, by Teofil Kwiatkowski, 1849, commissioned by Jane Stirling. Chopin sits in bed, in the presence of (from left) Aleksander Je≈Çowicki, Chopin's sister Ludwika Jƒôdrzejewicz, Marcelina Czartoryska, Wojciech Grzyma≈Ça and Kwiatkowski himself. During Chopin's last weeks in 1849, Stirling commissioned the Polish artist Teofil Kwiatkowski to produce an oil painting of Chopin, which also included Chopin's sister Ludwika (Louisa) Jƒôdrzejewicz, Marcelina Czartoryska and Grzyma≈Ça. In September 1849, Chopin took an apartment at Place Vend√¥me 12. The second-floor, seven-room apartment had previously housed the Russian Embassy; Chopin could not afford it, but Jane Stirling rented it for him. A few days before Chopin's death on 17 October, she purchased his grand piano. She paid the total cost of his funeral; all the travelling expenses from Warsaw of Chopin's sister Ludwika; and for his piano to be shipped to her in Warsaw. She purchased all of Chopin's remaining furniture and effects, including his death mask by Auguste Cl√©singer. She had some of the furniture shipped to Calder House near Edinburgh. It was displayed in a special room which became known as the Chopin Museum. She also collected various manuscripts, sketches, letters and other papers of his, containing handwritten comments, variants and dedications. She had a considerable correspondence with Ludwika Jƒôdrzejewicz concerning the posthumous publication of some of his unpublished works, and 25 of these letters are now in the Muzeum Fryderyka Chopina in Warsaw. Chopin had told Jane Stirling that she was the only one who knew his true date of birth. She wrote it down and placed it in a box which is buried with him in P√®re Lachaise Cemetery. On the first anniversary of his death she scattered over Chopin's grave some Polish soil that she had obtained from Ludwika. Brass plaque to the Stirlings of Kippendavie, Dunblane Cathedral She studied the piano further under Thomas Tellefsen, himself a Chopin pupil. Jane Stirling died on 6 February 1859, aged 54, of an ovarian cyst. She was buried on 11 February in the grounds of Dunblane Cathedral. Her will bequeathed the Chopin Museum to Chopin's mother Justyna Chopin. In 1863 much of it was destroyed when the Russian soldiers ransacked Zamoyski palace in Warsaw as a retort for an unsuccessful attempt to assassinate the Russian Namiestnik of Poland (viceroy) Friedrich Wilhelm Rembert von Berg by Polish resistance. One item which still exists is a lock of his auburn hair which Jane had kept. Biography The first and only existing biography of Jane Stirling was written by Audrey Evelyn Bone in 1960 by author's private publishing in only 500 copies. An alternative view: Jenny Lind It has been claimed that the financial assistance said to have been provided by Jane Stirling and Katherine Erskine was actually from the Swedish soprano Jenny Lind, and that the Scottish sisters were simply a cover for Lind's anonymity. Their father's will left them only ¬£300, which was by no means enough to fund the sort of generosity that was provided to Chopin. However, Jane had property over and above the single payment from the will, as her family were major plantation owners in Jamaica, and she received considerable compensation in 1831/33 on the abolition of slavery. Artistic recognition She was portrayed as a child with her father by Sir Henry Raeburn. The portrait hangs in Fyvie Castle and entitles her Jean Wilhelmina (the more Scottish version of Jane).

Although it has similarities with other fables where a predator flatters a bird, such as The Fox and the Crow and Chanticleer and the Fox, in this one the cock is the victor rather than victim. There are also Eastern variants of this story. Versions of the fable In the Greek story, a cock and a dog go on a journey together. At night, the cock roosts in a tree while the dog curls up at its roots. When the cock crowed in the morning, it attracted a fox that made friendly overtures and tried to lure the bird down. The cock agrees, telling it to ask the porter to open the door so that it can come out. The fox stumbles on the sleeping dog and is killed. An ancient Indian variant of the theme appeared in the Buddhist scriptures as the Kukuta-Jataka.The Jataka or stories of the Buddha's former births, ed. E.B. Cowell, Cambridge University Press, 1895, pp. 168-9 available online Here a predatory cat, having killed all the other fowls, tries to woo the cock down with a promise of marriage, but he is not to be deceived and denounces the cat for its former slaughter. In its journey westwards, the tale was eventually included in The Thousand and One Nights and was translated by Richard F. Burton as The Pleasant History of the Cock and the Fox.Available on Wikisource This version, enlarged by the fox's many flights of rhetoric, recounts how the beast tries to lure the cock down from a wall with the news that universal friendship has been declared between the hunters and the hunted. The cock refuses even to acknowledge the fox's fine words but finally announces that he is convinced for he can see greyhounds running towards them who must be messengers from the King of the Beasts. When the agitated fox starts to leave, the cock asks him the reason; the fox replies that he fears the dogs were not present when the peace was announced. This version of the story was an influence on the fable's retelling in Europe. It is to be found early among the humorous tales of Poggio Bracciolini's Facetiae (1450), where the fleeing fox explains only that the dogs have not yet heard that peace has been declared.The Facetiae, a new translation by Bernhardt J.Hurwood, London 1968, Tale 78, pp.78-9) In France the story reappeared in the first book of emblems of Guillaume Gueroult (1550). There the fable is told at length and it is explained that the suspicious cock has invented his report of the approaching hounds because he distrusts the fox. The telling is prefaced with the summary of the fable's meaning: ‚ÄúTo the trickster comes a trickster and a half‚Äù (A trompeur, trompeur et demi).Le premier livre des emblemes, Emblem 2, although the illustration to it is recycled from the story of ‚ÄúThe Fox and the Crow‚Äù When Jean de la Fontaine retold the story as Le coq et le renard (II.15),An English translation online he underlined his use of Geroult by concluding with a moral that echoed his source: ‚ÄúPleasure is doubled in tricking the trickster‚Äù (c‚Äôest double plaisir de tromper le trompeur). The Greek and the Oriental versions of the fable were soon to be confounded together. In Francis Barlow's illustrated edition of the fables (1687), Aphra Behn's English verse summary tells the Eastern tale with the cock concluding that ‚ÄúI‚Äôle not my strength forgoe, If true today, tomorrow ‚Äòtwill be so.‚Äù The accompanying Latin prose summary, on the other hand, follows Aesop's account but concludes that treachery is to be met with treachery.De vulpe, cane et gallo In France much later, Pierre Perret updated La Fontaine's stories for the television series Les Fables G√©ometriques (1990). In his reinterpretation, however, he favoured the Greek version of this fable, making the cock a jazz club performer and the protective dog a bouncer.View on YouTube Artistic interpretations The Jataka story of the cock and the cat from the Bharhut stupa, 150 BCE There is a carving of \\"The Cock and the Cat\\" from the Bharhut stupa, dating from 150 BCE, which is now displayed in the Indian Museum in Calcutta. Aesop's fable can be found on household china in Europe, but it is not always clear whether the story of \\"Chanticleer and the Fox\\" is meant instead without the appearance of the dog as well. The dog occupies the foreground on an 18th-century ornamental dessert dish from the Chelsea porcelain factory,Victoria & Albert Museum site online while in Marc Chagall's 1952 series of etchings, which are of La Fontaine's fables, the dog is shown running in from the distance.Plate 22 available online La Fontaine's version of the fable has also been set by several composers: *Louis Lacombe, as the third in his Fables de La Fontaine (Op. 72 1875) *Jean Fran√ßaix for solo or chorus and piano (1963) *Guy Reibel for wind instrument and three equal voices (1996) *Lucian Cristofor Tugui in 2006 References External links *15th-20th century illustrations from books on Flickr.com Cock, the Dog and the Fox Cock, the Dog and the Fox Category:Jataka tales Category:Emblem books Category:Fictional chickens Category:Dogs in literature Category:Foxes in literature Category:Animals in Buddhism ","title":"The Cock, the Dog and the Fox"},{"id":"30504553","text":"Gajec may refer to: * Gajec, Poland, a village near Rzepin * Gajec, Croatia, a village near Zagreb ","title":"Gajec"},{"id":"30504573","title":"Larry Owens"},{"id":"30504574","text":"Dorothy Megan Lowe (17 November 1915 ‚Äì 16 May 2017) was an English cricketer.

It primarily serves modern British food. It was founded in 1926 by an Italian named Peppino Leoni and has passed through numerous owners since then, including the chef Marco Pierre White, and is currently owned by Sam and Eddie Hart, also the owners of Barrafina. The restaurant is named after the Latin phrase Quo vadis?, meaning \\"Where are you going?\\"  History  = Building = Blue plaque commemorating Karl Marx's residency at 28 Dean Street The restaurant occupies numbers 26‚Äì29 Dean Street. Nos. 26‚Äì8 form a uniform group built in by the carpenter John Nolloth, of St James's, and No. 29 was built in . The sculptor Joseph Nollekens was born in the latter house in 1737; a later resident was the composer Fran√ßois-Hippolyte Barth√©l√©mon. Karl Marx and his family lived in two small rooms at No. 28, described as an \\"old hovel\\", between 1851 and 1856; his residency is commemorated by a London County Council blue plaque. It was due to the association with Marx that numbers 26‚Äì28 were made a Grade I listed building on 14 January 1970. = Restaurant = The restaurant was founded in 1926 by Peppino Leoni. When Leoni originally opened Quo Vadis in 1926, it only occupied No. 27. He purchased the property, with the aid of a bank loan for ¬£800. Its moniker was alighted on after Leoni saw a billboard in Leicester Square advertising a film of the same name. Quo Vadis is Latin for \\"Where art you going?\\". The cinematic epic, adapted from Henryk Sienkiewicz's classic 1896 novel Quo Vadis, was the highest-grossing film in 1951. In 1996, the restaurant was bought by Marco Pierre White and Damien Hirst, and featured paintings by the artist as well as a bar designed by him. The pair later parted company after a public falling out, following which White replaced Hirst's paintings with some of his own. In November 2007, head chef and owner Marco Pierre White sold the restaurant, along with two others, to restaurant group Conduit Street. Quo Vadis was then sold on again to Sam and Eddie Hart, who immediately closed it down. Both White and the Hart brothers endured criticism as Christmas bookings were cancelled. The Hart brothers re-opened the restaurant in 2008 with head Chef Jean Philippe Patruno (previously at Fino) following extensive restoration work and, in 2009, it won Tatler magazine's Restaurant of the Year award. In July 2008, celebrity chef Gordon Ramsay named Quo Vadis as his favourite restaurant, describing the Hart brothers as \\"restaurateurs in the fullest sense of the word\\". The Evening Standard characterised this praise as a \\"thinly veiled attack\\" on Marco Pierre White, with whom Ramsay has an antipathetic relationship. On the front-right of the restaurant is curious sight of a human nose. While rumours of connections to ancient Roman legends of traitors having their noses cut off and fed to animals have sprung up, it is one of several London Noses. In January 2012 Jeremy Lee, formerly of London's Blueprint Caf√©, joined Sam & Eddie Hart as chef and partner at Quo Vadis. Upon Jeremy's arrival the restaurant underwent some cosmetic changes and the long-standing collaboration with artist John Broadley began, starting with the distinctive illustrated menus. In September 2012 the QV Bakery was launched and a month later in October 2012 Quo Vadis began offering breakfast. Chef Jeremy Lee's menu of early morning favourites is \\"inspired by the iconic restaurant's British and seasonal fare.\\"  Critical reception  Quo Vadis under its current ownership has received generally positive reviews. Tatler has listed it as one of its top 20 restaurants, in July 2008 The Times reviewer Giles Coren gave the restaurant a score of 9 out of 10, describing the food as \\"all done beautifully\\" and in June 2008 The Telegraph's reviewer, Jasper Gerard, gave it 8 out of 10 and said that visitors would \\"adore the cooking\\". Tracey MacLeod of The Independent was less positive, giving the restaurant 2 out of 5 for ambience and service, although 4 out of 5 for food. She described the waiters as \\"skittish\\" and said that the Hart brothers were \\"not natural hosts\\". In January 2012 Fay Maschler of the Evening Standard gave Quo Vadis four out of five stars, stating \\"The combination of lovely Jeremy Lee, the hard-working Hart brothers and \\"Spitz\\" is the dream team of which my nights are made.\\" In February 2013 Giles Coren reviewed Quo Vadis in The Times Magazine, describing the menu as 'simple, perfect', the smoked eel and horseradish sandwich as a 'must-have' and the squid and fennel salad 'clean and dainty' Also in February 2012 Nick Lander wrote a review of Quo Vadis in the Financial Times, calling the cooking \\"exciting, vibrant and fresh.\\"  References  External links * Category:1926 establishments in England Category:Restaurants in London Category:Soho, London Category:Restaurants established in 1926 Category:Grade I listed buildings in the City of Westminster Category:Grade II listed buildings in the City of Westminster ","title":"Quo Vadis (restaurant)"},{"id":"30504665","text":"Sir Arthur Brooke KCB (1772 ‚Äì 26 July 1843) was an officer of the British Army during the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars, and the Peninsular War and War of 1812. He rose to the rank of lieutenant-general. Family Brooke was the third son of Francis Brooke of Colebrooke, County Fermanagh. He was the younger brother of Sir Henry Brooke, who was created a baronet in 1822. Military career He entered the Army as an ensign in the 44th Regiment of Foot in 1792, at the commencement of the French Revolutionary Wars and served with this regiment throughout them, and the succeeding Napoleonic Wars, until the conclusion of the general peace in 1815. He was promoted to lieutenant in 1793, serving with the 44th Foot in Lord Moira's division in Flanders in 1794 and 1795. He was promoted to captain in 1795, serving with Sir Ralph Abercromby's army in the reduction of the West Indies, where his regiment remained until 1798. He was present throughout the Egyptian campaign of 1801. He was promoted to major in 1802 and lieutenant-colonel in 1804 and commanded the 44th in Malta from 1804 to 1812. In 1813 he was promoted to colonel, and accompanied Lord William Bentinck to the east coast of Spain. Brooke, as senior colonel, took command of his regiment's brigade and distinguished himself in every action against Louis-Gabriel Suchet, and particularly at the Battle of Ordal. At the conclusion of the war with Napoleon in 1814, Brooke was gazetted a Companion of the Bath and ordered to march regiments from Bentinck's army across the south of France to Bordeaux, in order to embark at that port for an expedition against the United States of America, which was still at war with Britain since June 1812, in the War of 1812. The force embarked consisted of three brigades, commanded by Colonels Brooke, William Thornton and Patterson. The Chesapeake Bay campaign expedition was under the general command of Major-General Robert Ross and the naval command on the North American Station with Vice Admiral Sir Alexander Cochrane and Rear Admiral Sir George Cockburn. =War of 1812= Sailing up the Patuxent River on the south-western shore of the Chesapeake Bay of Maryland, in August 1814, and landing at Benedict, the force proceeded overland through Prince George's County to the Eastern Branch of the Potomac River, (now known as the Anacostia River) to the small bridge crossing there. In the Battle of Bladensburg, victory was secured by the flank movement of Brooke's brigade. The brigade consisted of the 4th Regiment, commanded by his brother, Francis Brooke, and his own 44th. Following the \\"Bladensburg Races\\" in which the disorganized American militia under Gen. William Winder (observed by President James Madison and Secretary of State and future President James Monroe) did not stand and fight the new \\"Congreve rocket\\" used by the \\"Redcoats\\" , they proceeded into the national capital for the occupation of the town. After burning the Capitol, Executive Mansion and other public buildings of Washington, the expedition re-embarked at Benedict, Maryland and sailed back down for refitting at Tangier Island in the lower Chesapeake Bay. Then, the next month, up to the mouth of the Patapsco River, where the troops were to land and advance on Baltimore, a major port city and \\"nest of pirates\\" for the substantial numbers of \\"privateers\\" that had raided British commercial shipping during the War. During the land attack from the town's east side, the fleet's ships were to force their way up the Middle and Northwest Branches of the river and bombard Fort McHenry which guarded the port. In the first skirmish of the Battle of Baltimore, before the Battle of North Point, General Ross was killed by supposedly two American snipers (traditionally Henry G. Wells and Daniel McComas of Aisquith's Sharpshooters, celebrated on Defenders' Day) and fell into the arms of his personal aide and Brooke later assumed command of the army. The regiments advanced further and clashed with the units of Stricker waiting for them further up the peninsula. \\"By the fall of our gallant leader,\\" wrote the expedition's historian, \\"the command now devolved on Colonel Brooke, of the 44th, an officer of decided personal courage but perhaps better calculated to lead a battalion than to guide an army.\\"Gleig, p. 95 Brooke determined to carry out his predecessor's plan. It was reported that Baltimore was defended by 20,000 American soldiers and militia with about 100 artillery pieces behind extensive earthworks and berms of fortifications stretching for several miles along the town's east side, under the seasoned command of Maryland Militia Maj. Gen. Samuel Smith. Brooke advanced and attacked a powerful force of militia on 12 September advanced earlier from the town, as the City Brigade of Brig Gen. John Stricker to the narrow part of the \\"Patapsco Neck\\" peninsula between Bread and Cheese Creek, which flowed north into Back River and Bear Creek (flowing south into the Patapsco), an area known as \\"Godly Wood\\". After facing the forces of several bastions including \\"Rodgers' Bastion\\" manned by sailors of the U.S. Navy under Commodore John Rodgers, after the experience at Bladensburg, he expected Baltimore was supposedly then at his mercy, but on finding that the sailors of the bombarding ships of the Royal Navy could not come further up the river's Northwest Branch to his assistance after a two-day bombardment by subduing the still active guns of the fort, even after a night-time landing party expedition by barge during the driving rainstorm to the fort's western flank under Capt. Charles Napier was discovered and fired upon and turned back by supporting Forts Covington and Babcock. Having also already moved his forces north and south before the Americans' trenches, probing for a weak point and finding large numbers of his opponents moving in concert with him, forestalling any attempt to get around the wings of the defenders. After an officers' conference, he quietly retired down the peninsula back to North Point after bivouacking on the scene of his \\"victory\\". The fleet sailed southward, and was joined at sea by the 95th Gordon Highlanders, and by Major- General John Keane, who superseded Brooke, after delivering to him a most eulogistic despatch from the commander-in-chief. Several of the units and regiments at Bladensburg and Baltimore were advanced further on by the Royal Navy to the Gulf of Mexico under General Sir Edward Pakenham (who met the same fate as Ross) to New Orleans to eventually meet the forces of Gen. Andrew Jackson at Chalmette, Louisiana, the following January 1815 (after however the signing unknownst to them of the Treaty of Ghent). At the close of the war, Brooke returned to England and in 1822 was rewarded by being made governor of Yarmouth. He was also promoted to major-general in 1819. He was made colonel of the 86th Regiment in 1837 and promoted to lieutenant-general that year. He was gazetted a Knight Commander of the Bath in 1833, and died on 26 July 1843 at his residence on George Street, Portman Square in London and was buried at Kensal Green Cemetery.H. M.

It is situated in the capital Jamestown and is the oldest Anglican Church in the southern hemisphere; the present building was put up in 1774. Saint James' Church, Jamestown Jamestown in 1875 History Oliver Cromwell granted a new charter to the English East India Company in 1657, which gave the company the right to fortify and colonize any of its establishments. Because of the strategic importance of Saint Helena as a fortress and staging post on the way home from India, the Company claimed the island on 5 May 1659. The building of the fort was commenced immediately and a little town sprang up in the valley with the chapel and was subsequently named Jamestown, after James, Duke of York. The valley, now generally known as James Valley, was called either Saint James Valley or Chapel Valley, after the chapel which was a prominent building as viewed from the bay. In 1671, the East India Company sent the first of a long sequence of Church of England chaplains. The early, modest little church was replaced by a slightly bigger one in 1674, but was only later named Saint James' church. By 1774 the first parish church in Jamestown showed signs of decay, and so finally a new building was erected. Saint James' is the oldest surviving Anglican church south of the Equator.

In regular service, they were restricted to a maximum speed of 180 km/h, but the locomotives were designed for travel speeds of up to 225 km/h. At the time of their presentation, they were the most powerful single frame locomotives ever built.  History  In 1937, Deutsche Reichsbahn proposed electric locomotives for the route Berlin-Halle (Saale)-Munich to provide a high-speed service with a top speed of 180 km/h and a speed of 60 km/h on the gradients of the Franconian Forest Railway, with an option of increasing speeds to over 200 km/h in the near future. Orders were placed with AEG and Siemens/Henschel for two locomotives each. AEG built locomotives with serial numbers E 19 01 and E 19 02, and those built by Siemens/Henschel were numbered E 19 11 and E 19 12. Both types were developed from the successful class E 18. The helical spring gear and rigid 1‚Ä≤Do1‚Ä≤ frame were taken largely unchanged from the E 18. However, in anticipation of the higher loads, the suspension was strengthened and power output increased by . Length over buffers is the same as E 18, and external differences are mainly in the arrangement of fans and windows. Since the Reichsbahn also wanted to make a comparison between the two biggest electrical companies in Germany, especially in the field of power electronics, the delivered locomotives were slightly different from each other. The two built by AEG (subclass E 19.0) were a modernized version of the E 18. The enclosure panels were welded instead of riveted and the engines were fitted with a modified precision regulator, which, despite smoother switching transitions, only had 20 speed steps (compared to 29 on the E 18). The other two by Siemens/Henschel (subclass E 19.1) were of a more conventional riveted construction, but had a modern dynamic brake to keep braking distances as short as possible. This resulted in a distinctive hump-like roof structure compared to the E 19.0. The E 19 01 entered service in 1938 with a black frame and burgundy body with white pinstripes. Extensive testing was conducted on all four locomotives in 1939-1940. Because of World War II no more were built. High-speed tests at up to 225 km/h were planned, but never took place. The E 19 01 and 02 could not adhere to the standard braking distance of 1000 meters because of insufficient braking power. It was hoped that the new electric brakes of the E 19 11 and 12 would solve this problem, but they could not be tested thoroughly before the war. As such, there was no conclusion to whether the E 19 could have reached the planned top speed in normal service.  Deutsche Bundesbahn  All four locomotives were transferred to the Deutsche Bundesbahn. The top speed had already been reduced to 140 km/h in the 1950s by a gearbox and motor conversion, to make them more suitable for their new main application on the Franconian Forest Railway. The two surviving museum locomotives still have this configuration and have not been restored to their original state. The livery was later changed to blue/black. The locomotives were stationed at the Nuremberg depot and mainly used between Nuremberg on the Franconian Forest (Frankenwald) and Probstzella in the DDR, as well as between Nuremberg and Regensburg. At times they were stationed at Hagen. The last E 19 (119 002) was retired in 1978, the others having been taken out of service in 1975 and 1977.  Preservation  E 19 01 and 12 have been preserved. E 19 01 is stationed at the German Museum of Technology in Berlin, with red livery. The E 19 12, stationed at the Nuremberg Transport Museum, was also restored to the original red livery after the \\"150 years of rail transport in Germany\\" anniversary. 119 002 and 011 were scrapped at Munich.

As a member of the Bahujan Samaj Party, he won the 2007 Uttar Pradesh state assembly elections from Naraini in southern Uttar Pradesh, and he was elected an MLA. He was suspended from the party by the BSP chief Mayawati in January 2011. In December 2010, he was charged with the rape of a seventeen-year-old girl from a Scheduled Caste. An initial inquiry by the state CID found the charges to be prima facie true, and he was arrested on 13 January 2011. Rape case, 2010 In November 2010, the victim named Neelu by the media (not her real name), of Majra Banantapurwa of Harnampur village in Panna District, was abducted and allegedly sold to one Rajju from a neighbouring village. The village pradhan (head) and a constable were responsible for the abduction. The girl's father, Achhe Lal, eventually recovered her, and went to Purushottam Naresh, who is the local MLA, seeking redressal of their grievances. It was decided that the girl would stay in Purushottam's house, where she would have adequate protection. It appears that on 10 and 11 December, Neelu was raped repeatedly by Purushottam and two of his bodyguards. Subsequently, she managed to escape and lodged rape charges with the police. However, Purushottam levied theft charges against her and on 15 December, the police arrested her. Her father Achchhe Lal was threatened but he went underground and approached the Gulabi Gang, a group of woman vigilantes in Banda. This helped publicize the case. After the matter was spotlighted in the media, the National Council of Women, as well as politicians from opposition parties, highlighted the case. The case was investigated by the CB-CID and a medical report of the victim confirmed violent sexual assault; the CB-CID found the rape charges to be prima facie true. Under pressure from colleagues in the BSP party, which claims to represent the backward castes, Chief Minister Mayawati suspended Naresh from the party on 3 January. http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/maya-fires-mla-for- raping-a-dalit-girl/1/125388.html Purushottam was arrested on 13 January. A few days later, after more than a month in jail, the girl was released on 17 January 2011. In August 2011, the Supreme Court of India, sent a notice to the state of Uttar Pradesh for arresting the girl in violation of the Juvenile Justice Act.http://www.indianexpress.com/news/banda-rape-case-sc-gives-last- chance-to-up-govt-to-respond/841975/ In 12 September 2011, unhappy with the state's handling of the case, the Supreme Court of India ordered the investigations to be handed over to the Central Bureau of Investigation.

It is indigenous to the coastal fynbos areas in and around the city of Cape Town, South Africa. Description and biology Passerina ericoides is a shrub typically up to 1 metre high, with narrow, slightly succulent, leaves some two to three mm long, its flowers are greenish-yellow to reddish, and are subtended by leaflike bracts. Unlike most species of Passerina, the plant bears fleshy orange or red berries. They taste nasty, but are harmless and look very attractive.Watt, John Mitchell; Breyer-Brandwijk, Maria Gerdina: The Medicinal and Poisonous Plants of Southern and Eastern Africa 2nd ed Pub.

Life Brooke was a son of William Brooke, merchant, and his wife Elizabeth Holbrook, who were married at Manchester Church in 1678‚Äì9. He was educated at Manchester Grammar School, and gained an exhibition 1715‚Äì18. He proceeded to Oriel College, Oxford, where he graduated MA on 30 April 1720. He was DCL in 1727. Brooke, then a fellow of Oriel, was made headmaster of Manchester Grammar School in September 1727. He obtained a mandamus from the crown to elect him a fellow of the collegiate church, and was elected in 1728, in spite of Tory opposition. He appears to have been on good terms with John Byrom, but he was unsuccessful as a master, and the feoffees of the school reduced his salary from ¬£200 to ¬£10. In 1730 he received the Oriel College living of Tortworth in Gloucestershire. Here he lived, after resigning the mastership of the school in 1749, until his death on 21 August 1757. He was married, and had one daughter. Brooke left his library for the use of his successors at Tortworth. A portrait of him, as late as 1830, was at Mr. Hulton's, of Blackley.

A Latin tract, Medicus Circumfaraneus, is perhaps a translation of the preceding. Robert Watt attributed to him two sermons dated to 1746 and 1747. His best known book is A Practical Essay concerning Christian Peaceableness, which went through three editions in 1741. The third edition contains some additional matter.

Between Schifferstadt and Germersheim it is part of the network of the Rhine-Neckar S-Bahn. Between Germersheim and W√∂rth am Rhein it is part of the network of the Stadtbahn Karlsruhe. The first section between Schifferstadt and Speyer was opened on 11 June 1847 and it was extended to Germersheim in 1864. The opening of the last section to W√∂rth am Rhein was opened in 1876. From 1906 to 1914, it was served by long-distance services, which ended after the First World War and the subsequent reincorporation of Alsace-Lorraine into France. The line was electrified from 2006 to 2010. History = Beginnings and emergence of the Schifferstadt‚ÄìGermersheim section = Originally the administration of the Circle of the Rhine (Rheinkreis), which was part of Bavaria, planned that its first railway line would be first in the north-south direction. Instead, the Palatine Ludwig Railway (Pf√§lzische Ludwigsbahn) was built between 1847 and 1849 from Rheinschanze (Ludwigshafen from 1853) to Bexbach; this mainly served the transport of coal. A route via Speyer, which was then the capital of the Circle of the Rhine (similar to the modern concept of the Palatinate), was considered instead of a route via Rheinschanz island, on which the city of Mannheim had built a fortification on the opposite bank of the Rhine. This alternative was dropped, since the main traffic flowed towards Mannheim at that time. In 1838, however, it was determined that Speyer should be linked to the main line via a branch line. The Palatine Ludwig Railway Company (Pf√§lzische Ludwigsbahn-Gesellschaft) opened a branch line from Schifferstadt to Speyer with the commissioning of the Rheinschanze‚ÄìNeustadt section of the Ludwig Railway on 11 June 1847. Plans for a north-south connection were subsequently developed. There were two options for discussion: one would run from Neustadt via Landau to Wissembourg in Alsace and continue from there to Strasbourg. The other would have extended the branch to Speyer via Germersheim and Lauterbourg to Strasbourg. The first option prevailed, because France hesitated and because the former option passed through territory that was more densely settled than a route along the Rhine valley. The section to Germersheim was opened on 14 March 1864 at a cost of a total of one million gulden, after being delayed by difficulties on agreeing on a route past its fortress. =Closing the gap to W√∂rth and further development = In the same year, a committee met in R√ºlzheim, which called for an extension of the line to W√∂rth. Apart from representatives from R√ºlzheim, it included representatives of Germersheim, Bellheim, Rheinzabern, W√∂rth and Maxau. It was at first unclear whether the town of Germersheim should be bypassed to the west or east. The former option would have been longer and more expensive. The Franco-Prussian War delayed the implementation of the project. The municipality of Kandel, which since 1864 had been served by the line from Winden to Karlsruhe campaigned for a route that passed through its territory. The administration of the Palatinate Railway (Pf√§lzische Eisenbahnen), to which the Ludwig Railway Company had belonged since 1870, rejected this proposal on 20 November 1871 since such a route would have required a detour which would have reduced traffic on the line. Kandel, however, did not give up immediately, and had its plan rewritten. Nevertheless, the chosen route went through W√∂rth. This was approved on 15 March 1874. The construction of the line went forward without any major problems and it was opened on 25 July 1876, along with its continuation via Lauterbourg to Strasbourg. Unlike the Schifferstadt‚ÄìGermersheim section, the newly opened section of the track was owned and operated by the Palatine Maximilian Railway (Pf√§lzische Maximiliansbahn-Gesellschaft). The line from Schifferstadt to Lauterbourg had two tracks from 1906. The express trains from Berlin to Strasbourg, which had previously run via Neustadt and the Neustadt‚ÄìWissembourg railway, now ran via Speyer and Germersheim as this route was shorter and the new track provided sufficient capacity. The line, along with the other railways within the Palatinate, was absorbed into the Royal Bavarian State Railways (K√∂niglich Bayerische Staatseisenbahnen) on 1 January 1909. = Development after the First World War = After the First World War, Alsace-Lorraine was returned to France and the long-distance services to it also ended, since the newly founded Deutsche Reichsbahn wanted trains to run as far as possible within Germany. Instead, the long-distance services ran over the Rhine Valley Railway. The Reichsbahn allocated the line to the newly created Reichsbahndirektion (railway division) of Ludwigshafen in 1922. In 1936 the route line was reallocated during the dissolution of the latter ‚Äì with the exception of W√∂rth station ‚Äì to the railway division of Mainz. Deutsche Bundesbahn (DB), which was responsible for railway operations from 1949, assigned the line to the railway division of Mainz, which was responsible for all railway lines within the newly created state of Rhineland- Palatinate. In the course of the staged dissolution of the railway division of Mainz from 1 August 1971, its counterpart in Karlsruhe took responsibility for the station. Up to 1980, an express train ran from Strasbourg to Ludwigshafen, which served the French military in particular. The line to Germersheim was electrified and the stations and halts were modernised with the establishment of S-Bahn operations between Schifferstadt and Germersheim. Karlsruhe Stadtbahn services have operated between Germersheim and W√∂rth, continuing to/from Karlsruhe, since December 2010. Between Germersheim and W√∂rth, the platforms of the stations that already existed before 2010 differ from the other Stadtbahn platforms in the area of the Karlsruher Verkehrsverbund (Karlsruhe transport association, KVV) in having a length of 160 m to allow the commuter trains to and from BASF to stop there. The usual platform length for a triple set is 120 m. Both tracks, including all points, were completely replaced over the whole Germersheim‚ÄìW√∂rth section during the summer holidays of 2007. Because of finds of unexploded bombs from the Second World War in the track bed in the area of Jockgrim the construction work was extended by a week. The line was also completely closed during the Easter break of 2010. At this time the platforms were partly renewed and the electrification started. Furthermore, the line was blockaded because of the construction from 5 July 2010 until 12 December 2010. Route  The 50 km-long railway line begins in Schifferstadt, where it branches to the left from the Palatine Ludwig Railway. It runs directly to the southeast to the outskirts of Schifferstadt and continues through the woods between Schifferstadt and Speyer. A few hundred metres after a junction with part of the former Heidelberg‚ÄìSpeyer railway that is still used as an industrial railway, the line curves to the south. While still in the city of Speyer it curves again to the southwest and runs almost straight, passing the community of R√∂merberg to the west of its built-up area. Shortly before Lingenfeld it curves left and runs south between the built-up areas of Lingenfeld and Lingenfelder Altrhein. On this section of the line used to converge with the Germersheim‚ÄìLandau railway, which came from the right and ran parallel with the Speyer line as far as Germersheim. In Germersheim the line takes an odd course: after its exit from the station it makes an S-shaped double curve and runs around the east of the town, instead of passing Germersheim to the west, which would have been possible at the time because the old town was far enough to the east. The Bruhrain Railway branches off the line at Germersheim station and runs parallel to the left of the Speyer line about halfway around the town before turning east to cross the Rhine. The Speyer line makes another S-curve and leaves Germersheim behind. The line then runs to Sondernheim, where it curves to the west to Bellheim, where it turns back to the south and runs to R√ºlzheim. In northwestern R√ºlzheim, it makes a lazy S-curve and then continues south, cutting through Rheinzabern and Jockgrim to connect with the Palatine Maximilian Railway and the Bienwald Railway in W√∂rth am Rhein.  Operating points = Schifferstadt = Schifferstadt station: the Speyer line (left) branches from the Mannheim‚ÄìSaarbr√ºcken railway (right). Schifferstadt station is the starting point of the Schifferstadt‚ÄìW√∂rth railway. It is located on the north- western outskirts of Schifferstadt. It was opened at the same time as the branch from the Rheinschanze‚ÄìNeustadt section of the Ludwig Railway to Speyer, making Schifferstadt the first railway junction in the Palatinate. = Schifferstadt S√ºd = The halt of Schifferstadt S√ºd (south) is located on the southern outskirts of Schifferstadt, near the school centre. It was built after the Second World War. = Speyer Nord-West = The halt of Speyer Nord- West (northwest) connects the suburbs of Speyer-Nord and Speyer-West to the rail network. = Speyer Hauptbahnhof = Speyer Hauptbahnhof Speyerer Hauptbahnhof was the terminus of the branch line beginning in Schifferstadt from 1847 to 1864. Its entrance building was destroyed in the Second World War and a new one was built at the end of the 1950s. The former freight shed is still preserved and is located south of the station building. Although there are still freight operations, it is no longer used for railway operations and it is currently vacant. = Speyer S√ºd = The development programs for Rheinland-Pfalz-Taktes 2015 (the Rhineland-Palatinate integrated regular interval timetable for 2015) and for the second stage of construction of the Rhine-Neckar S-Bahn included the construction an additional halt in the south of the city of Speyer, called Speyer S√ºd. After ten years of delay, the city council of Speyer decided in August 2012 to build the halt at Dr.-von-H√∂rmann- Stra√üe in the immediate vicinity of the Speyer-S√ºdwest special area. = Berghausen (Pfalz) = The former station and current halt of Berghausen (Pfalz) is located on the western edge of Berghausen, a district of R√∂merberg. The former entrance building and the freight shed are no longer used for railway operations. = Heiligenstein (Pfalz) = The former station and the present halt of Heiligenstein (Pfalz) is located on the western edge of Heiligenstein, a district of R√∂merberg. The former entrance building and the freight shed are no longer used for railway operations. = Lingenfeld = The former Lingenfeld station has now been restored as a halt. For historical reasons ‚Äì the village grew very quickly after the railway was opened ‚Äì it is located at the extreme north-eastern edge of the village. Its former entrance building and the freight shed are no longer used for railway operations. The former Germersheim‚ÄìLandau railway also ran through the centre of Lingenfeld but it never had a station in the village. = Germersheim = The railways formerly branched in both directions from Germersheim station, but the lines now only branch to the south. It is at the extreme northern end of the city and its track layout is partly in the municipality of Lingenfeld. The original entrance building, which is to the east of the railway tracks, is also under heritage protection. It was opened as a terminal station in 1864. With the commissioning of the Germersheim‚ÄìLandau railway in 1872, trains had to reverse in the terminus to continue along the other line. This situation did not change until the Schifferstadt‚ÄìGermersheim line was completed to W√∂rth to the south in 1876. A year later the Bruhrain Railway from Bruchsal to Rheinsheim was extended to Germersheim. Thus, it became an important junction station for long-distance traffic in the east-west direction and from 1906 also in the north-south direction. When Alsace-Lorraine returned to France after the First World War, it lost importance for north-south traffic. It has been part of the Rhine-Neckar S-Bahn since 2006 and integrated into the network of the Karlsruhe Stadtbahn since 2010. In this context, its platforms have been adapted for the disabled. = Germersheim Mitte/Rhein = The halt of Germersheim Mitte/Rhein (middle/Rhine) is located in the east of Germersheim and serves to give closer access to the city centre. It is also served by the Bruhrain Railway. It is served by services of the Rhine-Neckar S-Bahn. It was opened at the end of 2010 during the integration of the Germersheim‚ÄìW√∂rth line in the network of the Karlsruhe Stadtbahn and is ‚Äì since the Bruhrain Railway is slightly elevated on an embankment ‚Äì like Ludwigshafen Hauptbahnhof in having diverging platforms on different levels. = Germersheim S√ºd/Nolte = The halt of Germersheim S√ºd/Nolte (south/Nolte) is in the southeast of Germersheim, which offers easy access to the main furniture factory of the Nolte Group in the south-east of Germersheim. It was opened at the end of 2010 during the integration of the Germersheim‚ÄìW√∂rth line in the network of the Karlsruhe Stadtbahn. = Sondernheim = The halt of Sondernheim is centrally located in the Germersheim district of the same name. Its former entrance building is also a protected monument. = Bellheim Am M√ºhlbuckel = The halt of Bellheim Am M√ºhlbuckel is located in the northeast of Bellheim. It was opened at the end of 2010 during the integration of the Germersheim‚ÄìW√∂rth line in the network of the Karlsruhe Stadtbahn. = Bellheim station= The former station and the current halt of Bellheim is located in the southeast of Bellheim. Its former entrance building is also a protected monument. Previously, it connecting line to a US oil terminal and one to the B√ºrom√∂belfabrik Kardex furniture factory. During its integration in the network of the Karlsruhe Stadtbahn, its island platform was replaced by a side platforms. = R√ºlzheim (station and halt) = The municipality of R√ºlzheim has a halt (R√ºlzheim Bahnhof) in the middle of an S-curve at the northern edge of the town. It is about 250 metres northeast of the former station. The entrance building of the former station is also a protected monument. It now serves as a restaurant. In addition, the former freight hall still exists. = R√ºlzheim Freizeitzentrum = The halt of R√ºlzheim Freizeitzentrum is located near the Moby Dick water park. It was opened at the end of 2010 during the integration of the Germersheim‚ÄìW√∂rth line in the network of the Karlsruhe Stadtbahn. = Rheinzabern Bahnhof = The former station and the current halt of Rheinzabern is located in the north of Rheinzabern. = Rheinzabern Rappengasse = The halt of Rheinzabern Rappengasse is located in the centre of Rheinzabern. It was opened at the end of 2010 during the integration of the Germersheim‚ÄìW√∂rth line in the network of the Karlsruhe Stadtbahn. = Rheinzabern Alte R√∂merstra√üe = The halt of Rheinzabern Alte R√∂merstra√üe is located in the south of Rheinzabern. It was opened at the end of 2010 during the integration of the Germersheim‚ÄìW√∂rth line in the network of the Karlsruhe Stadtbahn. = Jockgrim = The former station and the current halt of Jockgrim is located in the centre of Jockgrim. Its former entrance building is also a protected monument. = W√∂rth (Rhein) Z√ºgelstra√üe = The halt of W√∂rth (Rhein) Z√ºgelstra√üe is located in the north of the built-up area of W√∂rth am Rhein not far from the separation of the Schifferstadt‚ÄìW√∂rth railway line from the line to Winden. It was opened at the regular 2011/2012 timetable change on 10 December 2011 and thus only one year after the commencement of Stadtbahn operations between W√∂rth und Germersheim. = W√∂rth (Rhein) = W√∂rth (Rhein) station is located to the southeast of the centre of W√∂rth. Originally, it was called W√∂rth i/Pfalz (in Palatinate). It was built in 1864 as a through station on the Winden‚ÄìKarlsruhe railway. With the opening of the Schifferstadt‚ÄìGermersheim line to W√∂rth in 1876, and its immediate continuation, the line to Strasbourg at the same time, it became a railway junction. The entrance building is a protected monument.  Operations = Passengers= Today the line is largely operated for passenger transport. In the 1950s, railcars of class 33.2 based in Landau were used. In operation, the line is divided into the Schifferstadt‚ÄìGermersheim and the Germersheim‚ÄìW√∂rth sections: the Rhine-Neckar S-Bahn operates lines S3 (Germersheim‚ÄìSchifferstadt‚ÄìLudwigshafen‚ÄìMannheim‚ÄìHeidelberg‚ÄìBruchsal‚ÄìKarlsruhe Hbf) and S4 (Germersheim‚ÄìSchifferstadt‚ÄìLudwigshafen‚ÄìMannheim‚ÄìHeidelberg‚ÄìBruchsal), which together provide a service approximately every half-hour (each service runs hourly). These are operated by class 425.2 electric multiple units. Light-rail sets of classes GT8-100C/2S and GT8-100D/2S-M operate at least hourly between Germersheim and W√∂rth as Stadtbahn lines S51 (Germersheim‚ÄìW√∂rth (Rhein)‚ÄìKarlsruhe Albtalbf‚ÄìKarlsruhe Europaplatz/Post Galerie (Karlstr.)) and S52 (Germersheim‚ÄìW√∂rth (Rhein)‚ÄìKarlsruhe Entenfang‚ÄìKarlsruhe Marktplatz (Kaiserstra√üe)). Furthermore, Regional-Express line RE 4 runs every two hours over the Schifferstadt‚ÄìW√∂rth railway from Mainz Hauptbahnhof to Karlsruhe Hauptbahnhof. This only serves the stations of Schifferstadt, Speyer Hbf and Germersheim. In Germersheim, the trains change to the Bruhrain Railway to continue to Graben-Neudorf. They were previously operated with electric multiple units of class 425, as are services on the Rhine-Neckar S-Bahn. Since March 2015, this service, which is now part of the new S√ºwex network, has been operated with class 429 (Stadler FLIRT) sets. = Freight operations= Freight operations are operated exclusively by private operators. The ports of Speyer, Germersheim and W√∂rth are served; furthermore, block trains are operated, mainly to the Mineral√∂lraffinerie Oberrhein oil refinery in Karlsruhe and to BASF in Ludwigshafen. The remaining stations are no longer used for freight operations. There was formerly a connecting line to a US oil terminal in Bellheim. The rolling stock formerly used in rail freight operations was based in the Ludwigshafen locomotive depot in particular.

It has been in continuous production since its debut. A three-hander tragic-comedy, Little Gem consists of three female monologists telling in successive scenes their personal histories of love and loss in an alienating contemporary world.  Plot synopsis  Three generations of Dublin women, Kay (grandmother), Loraine (mother) and Amber (granddaughter) narrate several months of emotional turmoil that they have experienced. Each woman is experiencing some sort of emotional crisis and communication between the three is fraught at best. Amber, who abuses alcohol and cocaine, has recently started dating the wayward Paul and it is suggested he will not be loyal. Lorraine has been separated from her partner Ray for many years. Ray is a homeless drug addict that occasionally drops into her life wreaking havoc as he does so. As the play opens Lorraine has experienced something of an emotional break-down in work and has been encouraged by her employers to seek therapy. Kay‚Äôs husband, Gem, has suffered a recent stroke and so is emotionally and physically distant from her, requiring homecare and is unable to feed or dress himself. In each of the women‚Äôs experience an absent male partner contributes to the disconnection that they feel. But as a token of hope and redemption the baby boy Amber gives birth to and names Gem brings the women together as they close the play by sharing a bed with the child each contributing to the care of the child.

This collection is a key resource for researchers interested in Great Britain and some Commonwealth countries postal and revenue philately and particularly impressed duty stamps. Selected rare items Proof sheet of one-penny stamps submitted for approval to Commissioners of Stamps by engraver. 10 May 1765. The archive includes a unique proof sheet of 26 Revenue 1765 Newspaper and Pamphlet one penny impressions showing the registration certificate. These were issued to apply the Stamp Act of 1765 intended to raise taxes to fund the defence of the American Colonies. The tax applied to legal documents, licenses, newspapers, pamphlets and almanacs in the American Colonies, Quebec, Nova Scotia, Newfoundland, Florida, the Bahamas and the West Indian Islands. The taxes resulted in public protest and rioting. The tax was abandoned after a few months due to its unpopularity but the political damage contributed to the War of Independence in 1775. 32 copies of the original dark-red proof impressions made in 1765 have survived worldwide and 26 are on this sheet. Five are in private hands and one is in the Smithsonian National Postal Museum's permanent collection. History Under the Inland Revenue Act of 1849 the control of revenue stamps transferred from the Excise Department to the Stamp Department at Somerset House. Proofs and specimens of stamps from 1710 were also deposited. The Stamping Department produced revenue and fee stamps until 1934 when responsibility was transferred to the Stationery Office. Until 1914, stamping of legal documents and production of postage and revenue stamps had been by the Inland Revenue, and by managed external contractors. Under The Inland Revenue and Post Office (Powers and Duties) Order, 1914, responsibility for the manufacture of postage stamps passed to the General Post Office, with some production at Somerset House until 1934. During that period imprimatur sheets of stamps were kept by the Inland Revenue and the Post Office, and earlier examples from 1840-1914 was passed to the GPO Archives (now Royal Mail, Heritage Services). Reference collections of these stamps were maintained and are virtually complete. Scope The archive has over 400,000 items and is more easily understood by being sub-divided into various collections: * The earliest, and one of the most extensive set of registers of dies and stamps used by the Stamp Revenue dating from 1710-1849 contained in some 28 volumes. * Registers of dies and stamps intended for use by the Stamp Revenue in America and the West Indies from 1765-66. * A mixed collection of postage and revenue stamps, dating from 1849-1884 held in 7 volumes. * The inspectors‚Äô Specimen Books of impressed revenue and postage stamps for the period 1885-1964 in 10 volumes. * The Registers of impressed revenue stamps and dies from 1916-1964 contained in 7 volumes, and the Secretary‚Äôs Specimen Book of Irish Dies. * Proofs and specimens of Ace of Spades, Almanack, Hat Tax, Home Duty, Medicine, Newspaper, Pamphlet and Playing Card stamps and wrappers, in some 26 albums. * A large number of registration sheets, in guard books, of postage and revenue stamps dating from 1914-1934.

Judicial independence, the exercise of judicial review, and the accessibility of courts are widely seen as key elements of the rule of law. In Singapore, the rule of law doctrine has been the topic of considerable disagreement and debate, largely through differing conceptions of the doctrine. These conceptions can generally be divided into two categories developed by legal academics, the \\"thin\\", or formal, conception and the \\"thick\\", or substantive, conception of the rule of law. The thin conception, often associated with the legal scholars Albert Venn Dicey and Joseph Raz, advocates the view that the rule of law is fulfilled by adhering to formal procedures and requirements, such as the stipulations that all laws be prospective, clear, stable and constitutionally enacted, and that the parties to legal disputes are treated equally and without bias on the part of judges. While people subscribing to the thin conception do not dismiss the importance of the content of the law, they take the view that this is a matter of substantive justice and should not be regarded as part of the concept of the rule of law. On the other hand, the thick conception of the rule of law entails the notion that in addition to the requirements of the thin rule, it is necessary for the law to conform with certain substantive standards of justice and human rights. A thin conception of the rule of law has generally been adopted by the Singapore Government and Members of Parliament from the ruling People's Action Party, as evidenced from the views expressed during a 1999 parliamentary debate on the rule of law. However, a thicker conception was evinced by the Minister for Law in a speech made during the 2009 seasonal meeting of the New York State Bar Association's International Section in Singapore. On the other hand, a thick conception of the rule of law that encompasses human rights has been adopted by a number of Government critics, including opposition politicians, and foreign and international organizations such as Human Rights Watch, Lawyers' Rights Watch Canada and the World Justice Project. Some of the key principles associated with the thin conception of the rule of law include judicial independence, natural justice, the availability of judicial review, and the accessibility of justice. Judicial independence in Singapore is safeguarded by various constitutional provisions and legal rules, though some commentators have highlighted certain events as suggesting a lack of judicial independence. One incident in the 1980s involving the transfer of the Senior District Judge to the Attorney-General's Chambers following a decision he made which was favourable to an opposition politician was investigated by a commission of inquiry and found not to be due to executive interference. In Singapore, natural justice is generally regarded as a procedural rather than a substantive concept. The process of judicial review involves the review of executive actions for compliance with administrative law rules, and of executive and legislative acts for unconstitutionality in light of the doctrine of constitutional supremacy. The state of the courts and legal processes in Singapore are largely seen as making justice accessible for the citizenry. For those taking a thick conception of the rule of law, the existence of the (\\"ISA\\") is widely regarded as a breach of the doctrine. The Act, which provides for detention without trial for people regarded by the executive as a risk to national security, is shielded from unconstitutionality by Article 149 of the Constitution. Although the Court of Appeal held in the 1988 case Chng Suan Tze v. Minister for Home Affairs that the courts could review the legality of detentions under the Act, the effect of the case was reversed through amendments to the Constitution and the ISA in 1989. The ISA amendments were determined to be effective by the High Court and Court of Appeal in Teo Soh Lung v. Minister for Home Affairs in 1989 and 1990 respectively. While the executive's largely unconstrained discretion to detain under the ISA has been criticized as contrary to the rule of law, the Government has justified the statute as a crucial measure of last resort for preserving security. Introduction There have been many attempts to define the rule of law. Academics over the years have come up with various formulations and ideas of what the doctrine should mean. The range of views can roughly be divided into two categories: the \\"thin\\", or formal, conception and the \\"thick\\", or substantive, conception of the rule of law.. =Thin conception of the rule of law= Albert Venn Dicey is often associated with the thin conception of the rule of law The \\"thin\\" conception rule of law advocates the view that the rule of law is fulfilled by adhering to formal procedures and requirements. People who subscribe to the thin conception are not apathetic towards the content of the law. However, as Ronald Dworkin says, \\"[t]hey say that this is a matter of substantive justice, and that substantive justice is an independent ideal, in no sense part of the ideal of the rule of law\\".. The thin conception of the rule of law is often associated with two academics, Albert Venn Dicey and Joseph Raz. According to Dicey, the rule of law may be regarded from three points of view:; see also . *The absolute supremacy of regular law ‚Äì a person is to be judged by a fixed set of rules and punished for breaching only the law, and is not to be subject to \\"the exercise by persons in authority of wide, arbitrary, or discretionary powers of constraint\\".Dicey (8th ed.), pp. 183‚Äì184. *\\"Legal equality\\", that is, \\"the universal subjection of all classes to one law administered by the ordinary Courts\\".See also Dicey (8th ed.), p. 189. *The fact that the constitution is the result of the ordinary law of the land. In other words, it is not the source but the consequence of the citizens' rights.See also Dicey (8th ed.), p. 191. Raz expressed a similar view. Expanding on the concept in a 1977 article, he said that, in its broadest sense, the rule of law means that people should obey the law and be ruled by it. On the other hand, a narrower construction of the rule of law means that the government shall be ruled by and subjected to the law. The doctrine of the rule of law also requires that \\"the making of particular laws should be guided by open and relatively stable general rules\\". If the law is to be obeyed, it \\"must be capable of guiding the behaviour of its subjects\\", in that people can find out what the law is and act accordingly.. A number of important principles spring from the basic idea of the rule of law. These may be divided into two groups: principles that ensure the law is capable of guiding its subjects' behaviour, and principles establishing legal machinery to secure compliance with the rule of law.Raz, p. 202. *Principles ensuring the law is capable of guiding behaviour. **Laws should be \\"prospective, open and clear\\". The meaning of the law should not be \\"ambiguous, vague, obscure or imprecise\\", and the law must be sufficiently publicized. Furthermore, laws should generally not be retroactive; but if a retroactive law is to be enacted, the fact that this is going to be done must be known for certain to ensure that the retroactivity does not clash with the rule of law.Raz, pp. 198‚Äì199. **Laws should be relatively stable and not changed too often, as with frequently changing laws it may be hard for people to keep themselves updated. People need to know what the law is both for short- and long-term planning.Raz, p. 199. **The making of particular or specific laws should be \\"guided by open, stable, clear and general rules\\" that create a stable framework. There are two types of general rules: those which empower authorities to make orders, and those which provide guidelines for the proper exercise of such powers.Raz, pp. 199‚Äì200. Joseph Raz in February 2009. He stated in a 1977 article that the rule of law requires that \\"the making of particular laws should be guided by open and relatively stable general rules\\". *Principles establishing legal machinery to secure compliance with the rule of law. **Judicial independence is essential. It would be futile for people to approach the courts for adjudication of their disputes if the courts do not apply the law independently. Moreover, people can only be guided by the law if judges apply it correctly.Raz, pp. 200‚Äì201. **Natural justice must be adhered to. For the law to be applied correctly, requirements such as an open and fair hearing and an absence of bias are essential.Raz, p. 201. **Courts must have the power to review primary and subsidiary legislation, and administrative action. **The courts should be accessible, since if cases are delayed for long periods, legal costs are prohibitive, and so on, this may \\"effectively turn the most enlightened law to a dead letter and frustrate one's ability effectively to guide oneself by the law\\". **Although crime-preventing agencies such as the police and prosecuting authorities must have some discretion to act, they should not be allowed to \\"pervert the law\\". For example, the police should not be allowed to decide to stop investigating, nor the prosecution be allowed to choose not to prosecute, certain crimes or certain categories of offenders.Raz, pp. 201‚Äì202. In Raz's view, one of the virtues of the rule of law is the restraint it imposes on authorities. It aims to exclude arbitrary power as it is said that most of the exercises of arbitrary power violate the rule of law. Arbitrary power is excluded when courts hold themselves accountable only to the law and observe \\"fairly strict procedures\\". Another virtue is the protection it accords to individual freedom, namely, \\"the sense of freedom in which it is identified with an effective ability to choose between as many options as possible\\". Most importantly, to adhere to the rule of law is to respect human dignity by \\"treating humans as persons capable of planning and plotting their future\\".Raz, pp. 202‚Äì204. Raz also identified some of the potential pitfalls of the rule of law. He opined that as the rule of law is designed \\"to minimise the harm to freedom and dignity which the law may cause in its pursuit of its goals however laudable these may be\\", the strict pursuit of the rule of law may prevent one from achieving certain social goals which may be preferable to the rule of law: \\"Sacrificing too many social goals on the altar of the rule of law may make the law barren and empty\\".Raz, p. 211. =Thick conception of the rule of law= Ronald Dworkin in September 2008. Dworkin's conception of the rule of law is \\"thick\\", as it encompasses a substantive theory of law and adjudication. At the other extreme, the \\"thick\\" rule of law entails the notion that in addition to the requirements of the thin rule, it is necessary for the law to conform with certain substantive standards of justice and human rights. Ronald Dworkin, one of the leading scholars advocating the thick conception of the rule of law, defines what he terms the \\"rights conception\\" of the rule of law as follows:Dworkin, pp. 11‚Äì12. Paul Craig, in analysing Dworkin's view, drew three conclusions. First, Dworkin rejects the need to distinguish between \\"legal\\" rules and a more complete political philosophy, since the rule of law is basically the theory of law and adjudication that he believes is correct. Secondly, the rule of law is not simply the thin or formal rule of law; the latter forms part of Dworkin's theory of law and adjudication. Thirdly, since taking a substantive view of the rule of law requires choosing what the best theory of justice is, it is necessary to articulate particular conceptions of what liberty, equality and other freedoms require.. Conceptions of the rule of law taken in Singapore =Thin conception= On 24 November 1999, Non-constituency Member of Parliament Joshua Benjamin Jeyaretnam moved the following motion in Parliament: \\"That this House recognises the importance of the Rule of Law and urges the government to ensure the complete and full compliance of the Rule of Law by all Ministers, officials and public servants.\\". During the ensuing debate, the Members of Parliament (MPs) from the ruling People's Action Party tended to adhere to a thinner, or more formal, conception of the rule of law. For instance, the Minister of State for Law Ho Peng Kee said:. Chin Tet Yung, an MP for Sembawang Group Representation Constituency, commented that the rule of law required that:. Chin moved an amendment to the motion introduced by Jeyaretnam so that it read: \\"That this House (1) values the importance of the Rule of Law; and (2) commends the Government for upholding the Rule of Law and ensuring that it is fully observed by all.\\"Chin Tet Yung, \\"Rule of Law\\" (24 November 1999), cols. 605‚Äì606. The amendment motion was eventually voted on and agreed to by a majority of MPs in Parliament.\\"Rule of Law\\" (24 November 1999), col. 634. In a speech made on 27 October 2009 at a plenary session entitled Singapore and the Rule of Law at the seasonal meeting of the New York State Bar Association's International Section in Singapore, Minister for Law K. Shanmugam said that he would not try to define the rule of law comprehensively or analyse it from an academic viewpoint, but, practically speaking, the key aspects of a society based on the rule of law are the following:. However, evincing a thicker conception of the rule of law, he added that most people accepted two additional elements \\"as being part of how a modern civilised society should be structured\\", though he felt it was \\"debatable whether they are part of a strict definition of Rule of Law\\". These elements were that \\"[t]he people must have the sovereign right to elect their Government\\", and that \\"laws must not offend that society's norms of fairness and justice\\".Shanmugam, para. 7. =Thick conception= A number of critics of the Government of Singapore have adopted a thick, or substantive, conception of the rule of law that encompasses the protection of human rights. In a chapter entitled \\"Rights and the Rule of Law\\" in his 1994 book Dare to Change,. Singapore Democratic Party (SDP) member (and later Secretary-General) Chee Soon Juan criticized, among other things, the Government's use of the Internal Security Act (\\"ISA\\"). to detain persons without trial, and the lack of freedom of speech and assembly.Chee, pp. 139‚Äì149. In an open letter published on the SDP website dated 6 January 2009 which was addressed to the Chief Justice, Attorney-General and Law Minister, he said: \\"[T]he rule of law is not just a system where the government passes legislation and everyone unquestioningly obeys. The concept of the rule of law necessitates the limitation of state power and the respect of human rights. Our Constitution spells out what these limitations are. It also defines the rights of the citizen.\\". And in a speech delivered to the International Bar Association Conference in Dubai on 4 November 2011, he cited a free media and the rights to free expression and peaceful assembly as essential elements of the rule of law.. J.B. Jeyaretnam in November 2005. During a Parliamentary debate in 1999, Jeyaretnam articulated a thick conception of the rule of law that embodied human rights protection. During the 24 November 1999 Parliamentary debate on the rule of law, Jeyaretnam traced the doctrine to the Magna Carta, and said that it was to be found in the Constitution of Singapore,. particularly in Article 9 and Article 12, which respectively protect the rights to life and personal liberty, and equality rights. He also noted that in the court judgment Ong Ah Chuan v Public Prosecutor (1980),. the Privy Council had held that in phrases such as \\"in accordance with law\\" and \\"equality before the law\\" in the Constitution, the term law does not only mean Acts passed by Parliament, but also includes the fundamental rules of natural justice that have been accepted and become part and parcel of the common law. He then cited eight instances of the Government's alleged non-compliance with the rule of law, including detention without trial under, inter alia, the ISA and the Criminal Law (Temporary Provisions) Act (\\"CLTPA\\");. denial of the right of arrested persons to counsel and to visits from their families for a period of time; denial of the rights to freedom of speech and assembly; and the tendency of the executive not to provide reasons for decisions made.Jeyaretnam, \\"Rule of Law\\" (24 November 1999), cols. 576‚Äì578. Opposition MP Chiam See Tong complained that the Government had not treated opposition parties fairly as regards applications for licences for events.. Criticisms about the ISA and the state of freedom of speech and assembly in Singapore also appear in reports by some foreign and international organizations. A 2007 report by Lawyers' Rights Watch Canada, Rule of Law in Singapore,. alleged that defamation and bankruptcy law had been used to oppress the political opposition, and expressed concern about stringent limits on the freedom of assembly and detention under the ISA.Rule of Law in Singapore, pp. 4‚Äì11. In its Rule of Law Index 2011,. the World Justice Project defined the rule of law as \\"a rules-based system in which the following four universal principles are upheld\\":Rule of Law Index 2011, p. 1. Singapore was ranked highly on factors such as order and security (with a ranking of 2 out of the 66 countries assessed), absence of corruption (4/66), and effective criminal justice (5/66), but less highly on open government (19/66), limited government powers (20/66) and fundamental rights (39/66).Rule of Law Index 2011, p. 92. In particular, the Index noted that \\"[n]otwithstanding the country's outstanding performance in most categories, there are substantial limitations on freedom of speech and freedom of assembly, with Singapore in 49th and 60th place, respectively, out of all 66 countries\\".Rule of Law Index 2011, p. 28. The Human Rights Watch Singapore: Country Summary of January 2012 commented negatively on restrictions on the rights to free speech, assembly and association, such as limitations on print, broadcast and online media, and outdoor gatherings; contempt of court proceedings against Alan Shadrake; and the gazetting of The Online Citizen blog as a \\"political association\\", thus preventing it from receiving foreign funding. It also criticized the existence of the ISA and CLTPA, the use of caning as a punishment, and the continued criminalization of sexual acts between consenting men under section 377A of the Penal Code... The Ministry of Law described the report as \\"inaccurate\\" and containing \\"false assertions\\".. Compliance with rule of law principles in Singapore =Principles associated with the thin conception= Judicial independence Raz identified judicial independence as one of the essential principles of the rule of law. In this context, judicial independence refers to the judiciary's independence from the legislative and executive branches of the government. Singapore's judiciary enjoys a certain measure of independence provided by various constitutional safeguards such as security of tenure and remuneration. Judges are also relatively free from executive and legislative influence. A retired Supreme Court judge, L.P. Thean, has said that it is theoretically possible for the executive to make political appointments to the Bench, to reduce a judge's remuneration by amending the Constitution, or to take away the judiciary's vital support staff, but \\"[t]he fact remains, however, that nothing of that kind has ever been done\\".. Various provisions of the Constitution guarantee the independence of the Supreme Court judiciary. Since Article 93 vests judicial power exclusively in the courts, judicial power is to be solely exercised by the judiciary and not by the executive or legislature, thus reflecting the former's independence from the other branches of government. Article 94 ensures that the office of a Supreme Court Judge will \\"not be abolished during his continuance in office\\", while Article 98 provides for judges' security of tenure until the age of 65 years, barring misbehaviour, inability, infirmity of body or mind, or any other cause that prevents judges from properly discharging the functions of their office. A judge may only be removed from office on these grounds by the President on the advice of a tribunal of judges of the Supreme Court or those who hold or have held equivalent offices in the Commonwealth. Article 98 also provides that the remuneration and other terms of office of Supreme Court judges may not be altered to their disadvantage following their appointment. Article 99 restricts parliamentary debate on the conduct of a Supreme Court judge unless on a substantive motion supported by at least a quarter of all MPs. However, it has been argued by some commentators that Singapore falls short where some aspects of judicial independence are concerned. For instance, Supreme Court judges above the age of 65 may be reappointed on a term basis.Constitution, Art. 94(3). It has been suggested that this may result in \\"the unsavoury possibility of judges being 'beholden' to the executive\\".. This point was also raised by Jeyaretnam in Parliament in 1986 with respect to the then Chief Justice Wee Chong Jin.. However, an academic has pointed out that removing entirely the system of extensions may not serve the larger interest at the end of the day if excellent judges have to retire due to the mandatory requirement.. The main entrance to the Subordinate Courts of Singapore. Judges of the Subordinate Courts do not enjoy the same security of tenure as Supreme Court judges. Judges of the Subordinate Courts do not enjoy the security of tenure enjoyed by the Supreme Court judges. As officers of the Singapore Legal Service, it is said that there is a risk of executive interference because judges may be removed from their judicial positions or transferred to lower- ranking positions elsewhere within the Legal Service by the Legal Service Commission (LSC). In 1984, the Senior District Judge Michael Khoo acquitted Opposition Member of Parliament J.B. Jeyaratnam of all but one minor charge in a case involving cheques for the Workers' Party of Singapore which had allegedly been fraudulently handled. The acquittal was overturned on appeal to the High Court, and a retrial ordered.Public Prosecutor v. Wong Hong Toy and another [1985‚Äì1986] S.L.R.(R.) 126, H.C. (Singapore). However, before the retrial took place, Khoo was transferred from his position on the Bench to the Attorney-General's Chambers to take up the post of deputy public prosecutor. This was considered to be a demotion. In 1986, Jeyaratnam claimed in Parliament that the transfer had been made because Khoo had ruled in his favour in the 1984 case.. However, a commission of inquiry. formed to look into the circumstances surrounding the transfer found no evidence of this. For making the allegation, Jeyaratnam was referred to Parliament's Committee of Privileges for abusing parliamentary privilege. While the Committee was considering the matter, Jeyaretnam wrote five newsletters about the Committee's proceedings and sent them to residents of his constituency. On 9 October 1986, the Leader of the House made a written complaint regarding the newsletters' contents to the Speaker of Parliament, which the Committee also considered. On 27 January 1987 Parliament accepted the Committee's reports on the complaints; . and found Jeyaretnam guilty of abusing the privileges of Parliament by alleging executive interference in the judiciary, and of contempt of the Committee and Parliament by publishing the newsletters. Fines totalling S$26,000 were imposed.; . Another concern which has been raised is that the routine shuffling of Subordinate Courts judges between the executive and judicial branches may result in them \\"imbib[ing] the executive's corporatist ideology, carrying that into adjudication, as a 'judiciary of amateurs'\\".The phrase in single quotation marks is from . On the other hand, while a potential for executive interference exists due to the LSC's control of Subordinate Court judicial appointments, it has been commented that in a small state like Singapore it may not be practical to have a separate judicial and legal service. Also, the appointment process may not be detrimental to the independence of the lower judiciary as the Chief Justice, who is not part of the executive or legislature, is the head of the LSC and has the final say on judicial postings.. It has also been noted that, as much as institutional processes play a part in judicial independence, ultimately the willingness of judiciary to stand up to executive and legislative influence is the most important factor in ensuring an independent judiciary.Hor, pp. 506‚Äì507. Another incident said to have affected judicial independence in Singapore was the move by Parliament to amend the Constitution and the ISA to reverse the effect of the Court of Appeal's decision Chng Suan Tze v. Minister of Home Affairs (1988)Chng Suan Tze v. Minister of Home Affairs [1988] SGCA 16, [1988] 2 S.L.R.(R.) 525, Court of Appeal (Singapore), archived from the original on 24 December 2011. (discussed in detail below). It has been asked if Parliament had \\"taken away absolutely the judicial power of review for ISA preventive detention cases\\", and whether this reflected the Legislature's \\"distrust in the independence of the Judiciary and its ability to deal impartially with ISA cases that affect national security notwithstanding the limited form of judicial review laid down in Chng Suan Tze.\\". Another commentator has framed it as \\"an attack on the judiciary simply because it removes a vital aspect of judicial power\\" and that this \\"undermines judicial credibility\\".. Natural justice It has been noted generally that natural justice is a fundamental element of the rule of law. In administrative law, the two principles of natural justice, which constitute a framework for common law procedural rights, are the rule against bias (nemo iudex in causa sua, or \\"no man a judge in his own cause\\")See, generally, . and the right to be heard (audi alteram partem, or \\"hear the other side\\").See, generally, . In the Australian case Gas and Fuel Corporation of Victoria v Wood Hall Ltd & Leonard Pipeline Contractors Ltd (1978),. the Supreme Court of Victoria said that the ideas underlying both principles are that of \\"fairness and judgement only after a full and fair hearing given to all parties.\\" Speaking in Parliament on 24 November 1999, MP Toh See Kiat expressed the view that the Singapore legal system does apply the rules of natural justice, which he described thus: \\"[N]atural justice requires essentially two basic principles. One is that you have the right to be heard and to explain your case, and, two, is the right to equal treatment. A right to have your case heard also means that there is a review.\\". As was noted previously, the word law in provisions of the Constitution such as Articles 9 and 12 includes fundamental rules of natural justice. Jack Tsen-Ta Lee has suggested that these fundamental rules are both procedural and substantive in nature, and that substantive natural justice gives the courts discretion to strike down a law if its very object is unreasonable and oppressive. Under this view, to interpret Article 9(1) as permitting Parliament to enact any provision that derogates from an individual's personal liberty no matter how arbitrary or oppressive as long as procedural natural justice is observed, drains it of all content. Also, instead of the invalidation of legislation in this manner being seen as an encroachment by the judiciary into the legislature's sphere, the application of substantive natural justice would simply be a full exercise of the judiciary's proper constitutional role. Lee submits that Singapore courts should follow the Indian courts and apply a reasonableness testSee also . to determine if legislation is substantively constitutional.. Ultimately, being able to review legislation by applying the substantive aspect of natural justice would \\"entitle courts to examine whether it is appropriate for the legislature to deprive individual of certain aspects of their personal liberty, and the manner in which such deprivation is achieved.\\"Lee, p. 195. Conversely, Andrew Harding has argued that the idea of substantive natural justice is vague and subjective, and has taken the view that fundamental rules of natural justice are entirely procedural in nature. In his opinion, Article 12(1) of the Constitution is designed to prevent substantively discriminatory legislation. To determine whether legislation is discriminatory, a rational nexus test is applied.Public Prosecutor v. Taw Cheng Kong [1998] 2 S.L.R.(R.) 489 at 507‚Äì508, para. 58, C.A. (Singapore), archived from the original on 13 April 2009. It would be strange if legislation that passed this test could nonetheless be struck down due to inconsistency with natural justice. Therefore, the extension of Article 12(1) to include natural justice shows that the Privy Council in Ong Ah Chuan could not have intended to apply natural justice in a substantive sense.. Further support for this argument can be found in the Privy Council's decision Haw Tua Tau v. Public Prosecutor (1981). For commentary, see . which discussed fundamental rules of natural justice in a procedural context, their Lordships stating that they had to consider \\"whether the consequence of the alteration [of certain statutory provisions] is a procedure for the trial of criminal offences that is contrary to some fundamental rule of natural justice\\".Haw Tua Tau, [1981‚Äì1982] S.L.R.(R.) at p. 137, para. 8. The substantive review of legislation by the court was also rejected in Jabar bin Kadermastan v. Public Prosecutor (1995),, archived from the original on 26 October 2012. the Court of Appeal holding that \\"any law which provides for the deprivation of a person's life or personal liberty, is valid and binding so long as it is validly passed by Parliament. The court is not concerned with whether it is also fair, just and reasonable as well.\\"Jabar, p. 343, para. 52. In , the Court of Appeal clarified that this statement in Jabar was not a rejection of the existence of fundamental rules of natural justice in the Constitution. Subsequently, in Yong Vui Kong v. Attorney-General (2011), (\\"Yong Vui Kong v. AG\\"). the Court held that fundamental rules of natural justice and the principles of natural justice in administrative law \\"are the same in nature and function, except that they operate at different levels of our legal order, one to invalidate legislation on the ground of unconstitutionality, and the other to invalidate administrative decisions on the ground of administrative law principles\\".Yong Vui Kong v. AG, p. 1243, para. 105. Judicial review Judicial review is the means by which legal rights are protected and good governance enforced.. The ability of the courts to judicially review legislation and administrative action is considered an element of the rule of law. In R. v. Committee of the Lords of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council acting for the Visitor of the University of London, ex parte Vijayatunga (1987),R. v. Committee of the Lords of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council acting for the Visitor of the University of London, ex parte Vijayatunga [1988] Q.B. 322, High Court (Queen's Bench) (England & Wales). Judge Simon Brown said: \\"Judicial review is the exercise of the court's inherent power at common law to determine whether action is lawful or not; in a word to uphold the rule of law\\".Ex parte Vijayatunga, p. 343, cited in . Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong in June 2007. In a case brought by him against the publisher of the Far Eastern Economic Review that year, the High Court described situations in which judicial review would be inappropriate. In Singapore, the vital role that the judiciary plays as a check on executive power was noted by the Court of Appeal in Chng Suan Tze, which held that all power given by law has legal limits and that \\"the rule of law demands that the courts should be able to examine the exercise of discretionary power\\".Chng Suan Tze, p. 553, para. 86. This is further illustrated by Law Society of Singapore v. Tan Guat Neo Phyllis (2008),. in which it was stated that prosecutorial discretion is subject to judicial review and may be curtailed where exercised in bad faith or for extraneous purposes, or is in contravention of constitutional rights.Tan Guat Neo Phyllis, pp. 312‚Äì313, paras. 148‚Äì149. In Chee Siok Chin v. Minister for Home Affairs (2005),. the High Court held that if a litigant \\"genuinely seek[s] the court's assistance in vindicating or determining a legitimate grievance, the court has a duty to assess such a grievance and accord proper and serious consideration in determining whether relief should be granted\\".Chee Siok Chin, p. 599, para. 39. Chief Justice Chan Sek Keong has also said it is the role of the courts in Singapore to give litigants their rights, whilst simultaneously playing a supporting role in the promotion of good governance through the articulation of clear rules and principles by which the executive can conform with the rule of law.Chan, p. 485, para. 44. He noted that 27.8% of judicial review cases in Singapore since 1957 have been successful.Chan, p. 474, para. 14. However, certain matters are regarded as impervious to judicial review owing to limitations in the courts' institutional capacity. Courts are generally reluctant to get involved in affairs relating to national security, leaving this role to the Government. At the same time, Singaporean courts are committed to careful scrutiny of matters to decide whether they are indeed non-justiciable, as affirmed in the Lee Hsien Loong v. Review Publishing Co. Ltd. (2007).Lee Hsien Loong v. Review Publishing Co. Ltd. [2007] 2 S.L.R.(R.) 453, H.C. (Singapore). This case held that courts would exclude matters involving \\"high policy\\" from their purview, but still analyse cases carefully to determine whether or not they truly fell within areas of executive immunity. Also, limitations on the role of the court have led to the rational conclusion that certain other areas are to be excluded from judicial review. These include matters in which the court lacks expertise and those which are polycentric, as was held in Yong Vui Kong v. Attorney-General.Yong Vui Kong v. AG, p. 16, para. 29. Accessibility of justice Generally, justice is costly to provide and many legal systems, especially in Asia, are fraught with issues such as weak legal institutions, corrupt and incompetent administrative officers and judges, excessive delays and limited access to justice stemming from high legal costs and the lack of legal aid.. It was agreed during the World Justice Forum in 2008 that access to justice is key to advancing the rule of law.. The extent to which citizens have access to justice in any given society depends on whether a thick or thin conception of rule of law is adopted. Raz, speaking about a thin conception, proposed that the rule of the law requires courts to be accessible ‚Äì that is, the legal system, at a bare minimum, should comprise formal institutions and mechanisms for administering appropriate legal processes and outcomes.Raz, p. 196. A legal system complying with the thin rule of law also requires that laws are fairly, equally and effectively applied.. On the other hand, when a thick conception of the rule of law is taken, a greater emphasis is placed on elements of substantive justice. It is suggested that a legal system operating as such may, in addition to the basic elements of access to justice in a thin rule of law, incorporate a moral or political philosophy, may incorporate ideas of \\"democracy and legality\\",. and give precedence to human rights in the administration of justice. Access to justice operating under a thick rule of law may be achieved by, among other things, increasing the efficiency of the judicial process, and having a robust legal profession, an incorruptible and independent judiciary, and a set of supporting institutions in order to increase the quality of justice administered.. In Singapore, ensuring widespread and equal access to justice for Singapore citizens is a constant goal. In this respect, the judiciary takes effort to ensure that both procedural and substantive elements of the rule of law are fulfilled ‚Äì firstly, by continually increasing the efficiency of the courts and legal processes, (\\"SMU paper\\"), subsequently published as . and secondly, by regularly improving the skills, knowledge and values of and judges.. In 1988, the Singapore courts undertook the enormous task of clearing their extremely large backlogs in order to facilitate Singapore's future development as an international business and finance centre.Phang, SMU paper at p. 10, (2000‚Äì2001) 21 Singapore Law Review at p. 33. A multifaceted approach was adopted to dispose of cases expeditiously, including, among other things, the appointment of more judges and judicial commissioners, the use of information technology, electronic filing of documents and promoting the use of alternative dispute resolution. Such efforts significantly expedited the management of cases, both in the Supreme Court and the Subordinate Courts. In particular, specialized courts such as small claims tribunals, the Family Court and the Night Court were set up for better distribution of cases and have also helped to significantly reduce court fees.Phang, SMU paper at pp. 11‚Äì13, (2000‚Äì2001) 21 Singapore Law Review at pp. 34‚Äì37. Over and above increasing the institutional capacity and efficiency of the courts, improving access to justice in Singapore has also meant a need for a corresponding increase in the quality of justice administered. Efforts to achieve this goal centre mainly on the appointment of the \\"best and brightest officers\\". and in particular, the constant upgrading of their skills and knowledge for judicial excellence. For this purpose, the Judicial Education Board was set up to provide guidance, training programmes and workshops for members of the judiciary, and is supported by a training unit within the Strategic Planning and Training Division of the Subordinate Courts. Such efforts aim to upgrade the competence of judges and equip them with the requisite knowledge for handling increasingly complex cases.V.K. Rajah, p. 7. Today, there are relatively few barriers to court access for litigants. The availability of legal aid and free mediation services aid litigants who may not be able to afford legal fees, and the use of video links and establishment of regional offices of small claims tribunals in various parts of Singapore assist parties who have difficulty coming to court.. =Principles associated with the thick conception= Criticisms of the Internal Security Act As indicated above, a number of those who adopt a thick conception of the rule of law in Singapore criticize the existence of the Internal Security Act. The main point of contention is whether section 8(1) of the Act should be interpreted in a subjective or objective way. This provision states that \\"[i]f the President is satisfied with respect to any person that, with a view to preventing that person from acting in any manner prejudicial to the security of Singapore or any part thereof or to the maintenance of public order or essential services therein, it is necessary to do so\\", the Minister for Home Affairs shall order that the person be, among other things, detained without trial for up to two years. In Lee Mau Seng v. Minister for Home Affairs (1971),Lee Mau Seng v. Minister for Home Affairs [1971] SGHC 10, [1971‚Äì1973] S.L.R.(R.) 135, H.C. (Singapore), archived from the original on 5 January 2012. the High Court affirmed that with respect to the President's satisfaction that a person is acting in any manner prejudicial to the security of Singapore, mala fides or bad faith was \\"not ... a justiciable issue in the context of the Act and the power conferred by the Act on a body such as the President who has to act in accordance with the advice of the Cabinet to direct the issue of an order of detention if the President is satisfied with a view to preventing a person from acting in any manner prejudicial to the security of Singapore etc\\".Lee Mau Seng, p. 157, para. 59. Essentially, this means that the President's satisfaction is subjective, and not objective. The effect of this decision is that \\"the Constitution left it to the executive, and not the judiciary, to decide what national security required\\".. Subsequently, in Chng Suan Tze v. Minister for Home Affairs (1988),Chng Suan Tze v. Minister for Home Affairs [1988] SGCA 16, [1988] 2 S.L.R.(R.) 525, C.A. (Singapore), archived from the original on 24 December 2011. the Court of Appeal took a different stand, holding that the objective test should apply to the review of the exercise of discretion under sections 8 and 10 of the ISA. (Section 10 empowers the Minister to direct that a detention order be suspended \\"as the Minister sees fit\\", as well as to revoke such a direction.) The Court said that \\"the notion of a subjective or unfettered discretion is contrary to the rule of law\\" because \\"all power has legal limits\\", and therefore the exercise of discretionary power warrants examination by the court. Following this decision, the Parliament moved quickly to curb the judiciary's change in stance. The Internal Security (Amendment) Act 1989. was enacted on 25 January 1989 and came into force on 30 January. In particular, section 8B(1) declared: Section 8B(2) contained an ouster clause that restricted the scope of judicial review to any question relating to compliance with any procedural requirements of the ISA governing acts or decisions by the President or the Home Affairs Minister. The amendments to the ISA were made retrospective by section 8D, which meant that they applied to judicial review proceedings that had been started before the amendment Act came into force.Internal Security (Amendment) Act 1989, s. 2. In addition, the Constitution was amended through the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore (Amendment) Act 1989. to prevent the Internal Security (Amendment) Act 1989 from being challenged as unconstitutional. Article 149(3) was inserted into the Constitution, with the effect that if the issue of whether any executive decision made pursuant to the ISA came before a court (whether before or after this constitutional amendment came into force on 27 January 1989), the court had to decide this issue according to the new provisions introduced by the 1989 ISA amendments.Tan, p. 163. Article 149(1) was amended to add Articles 11 and 12 to the list of fundamental liberties that the ISA cannot be challenged against, and to extend its immunizing effect to the 1989 ISA amendments.Constitution of the Republic of Singapore (Amendment) Act 1989, s. 3. Teo Soh Lung at a Singapore Democratic Party rally for the 2011 general election. In 1989‚Äì1990, Teo, then an ISA detainee, unsuccessfully challenged the validity of the 1989 amendments to the Act. The validity of the 1989 ISA amendments was challenged unsuccessfully before the High Court and Court of Appeal in 1989 and 1990 respectively in Teo Soh Lung v. Minister for Home Affairs.Teo Soh Lung v. Minister for Home Affairs [1989] 1 S.L.R.(R.) 461, H.C. (Singapore); [1990] 1 S.L.R.(R.) 347, C.A. (Singapore). The High Court held that the 1989 amendments had merely reaffirmed the legal principles laid down in Lee Mau Seng and thus could not be characterized as being contrary to the rule of law or having usurped judicial power:Teo Soh Lung (H.C.), p. 479, para. 48. On appeal, the Court of Appeal confirmed that it had to decide the case in accordance with the legal principles laid down in Lee Mau Seng as the effect of section 8B(1) of the ISA was clear.Teo Soh Lung (C.A.), pp. 359‚Äì360, paras. 20‚Äì21. Applying those legal principles, the Court held that the appellant had failed to prove that her detention had been made for reasons unrelated to national security.Teo Soh Lung (C.A.), pp. 366‚Äì367, paras. 41‚Äì43. During the 1999 parliamentary debate on the rule of law, Jeyaretnam asserted that detention without trial under the ISA contravened the doctrine as \\"there is no way of checking the Minister's decision, who decides to make an order detaining a subject, depriving him of his liberty, completely contrary to the rule of natural justice and the fundamental principle that all men are free\\". He called for the provisions in the Act permitting such detention to be repealed, saying: \\"The power is only necessary in emergency times when there is a real threat and so we do not need it any more. Let us for once realise that it is a violation of the Rule of Law. Let us be honest and repeal it.\\"Jeyaretnam, \\"Rule of Law\\" (24 November 1999), cols. 579‚Äì581. Nominated Member of Parliament Simon Tay expressed the view that \\"the ISA fulfills the Constitution as an exception. It does not fulfill the concept of the Rule of Law in the sense that there are only very limited grounds on which a court can review the decision of the Minister. It is in that sense a subjective discretion.\\" Nonetheless, he recognized that the ISA remained relevant, for instance, as a tool against people alleged to have engaged in espionage, and thus preventive detention could not be definitively declared right or wrong: \\"It is a case-by-case decision, because that is how we live our lives in a real society.\\"Simon Tay (Nominated Member of Parliament), \\"Rule of Law\\" (24 November 1999), cols. 586‚Äì587. Responding to Jeyaretnam, Ho Peng Kee noted that the justifications for the ISA had been fully debated in Parliament on previous occasions, and emphasized that there are safeguards in place to tackle the apparent arbitrariness of detentions under the Act, including a review of each detention by an advisory board composed of a Supreme Court judge and two prominent members of the public, and also the President's personal discretion to order a detainee's release in the event that the advisory board and Home Affairs Minister disagreed over the necessity for the detention.Ho Peng Kee, \\"Rule of Law\\" (24 November 1999), cols. 593‚Äì594. Speaking at the 2009 seasonal meeting of the New York State Bar Association's International Section in Singapore, Shanmugam explained that stability was one of the essential conditions for Singapore's governance, and that the ISA contributed to the stability of the country by enabling terrorist threats to be dealt with.Shanmugam, paras. 59‚Äì66. In response, Michael Galligan, the Chairman of the International Section, wrote that \\"whatever might be appropriate for times of extraordinary danger should not be assumed to be the measure for ordinary times. Circumscription of liberties that may have some arguable justification in a national defense crisis should not set the norm for more peaceful or more 'ordinary' times in the life of a nation.\\". In a 16 September 2011 statement, the Ministry of Home Affairs said that the Government had used the ISA \\"sparingly\\", and not for detaining people solely for their political beliefs. It expressed the view that \\"[t]he ISA continues to be relevant and crucial as a measure of last resort for the preservation of our national security\\"..

Speaking on the matter in Parliament in 2009, the Minister for Law, K. Shanmugam, said that the right to vote could not be a mere privilege as this would imply the existence of an institution superior to the body of citizens that is empowered to grant such a privilege, but that no such institution exists in a free country. In 1966 a Constitutional Commission chaired by Chief Justice Wee Chong Jin advocated entrenching the right to vote within the Constitution, but this was not taken up by the Parliament of the day. When this proposal was repeated during the 2009 parliamentary debate, the Government took the view that such entrenchment was unnecessary. In Taw Cheng Kong v. Public Prosecutor (1998), the High Court suggested on an obiter basis that voting is a privilege rather than a right. It has been suggested by law academic Thio Li-ann that, if called upon to decide the issue, the court might infer the existence of the right to vote in the Constitution from its text and structure, and from the fact that it is an adaptation of the Westminster system of democracy. If the right to vote were to be found to be implicit in the Constitution, the judiciary would be better able to protect the right when issues arise before the courts. The Parliamentary Elections Act and Presidential Elections Act regulate the exercise of the vote and set out the procedures for parliamentary and presidential elections in Singapore. These are ordinary statutes which can be changed by a simple majority in Parliament. All Singapore citizens not less than 21 years old on the cut-off date for the registration of electors (1 January of a particular year), and ordinarily resident in the country, are entitled to vote in both parliamentary and presidential elections. A one person, one vote system is currently in operation, though in 1994 Senior Minister and former Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew suggested that people aged between 35 and 60 who were married with children should be given two votes each due to their greater responsibilities and contributions to society. Overseas voting was introduced in 2001, and first carried out during the 2006 general election. A person is disqualified from voting in certain circumstances, which include engaging in acts incompatible with being a Singapore citizen, being of unsound mind, or being in prison for committing a criminal offence. The constitutionality of the statutory provisions denying prisoners the right to vote has not yet become an issue in Singapore, though it has been controversial in some foreign jurisdictions. Introduction A c. 1876 portrait of Thomas Paine (1737‚Äì1809) by Auguste Milli√®re, based on an earlier work by George Romney. Paine, one of the Founding Fathers of the United States, called the right to vote one of an individual's personal rights, which are \\"a species of property of the most sacred kind\\". The right to vote forms the foundation of representative democracy, that is, democracy based on the principle of citizens electing a group of people to represent their interests. The various models of government that fall under the general term \\"representative democracy\\", namely, the protective, participatory and elite models, are all based upon the underlying principle of equality of rights, including the right to vote.. \\"Popular government\\" was referred to by John Stuart Mill as \\"where the supreme controlling power ... is vested in the entire aggregate of the community\\",. while Edmund Burke argued that it has the desirable consequence of establishing a government that has a unified public interest, with its citizens absent of personal prejudices except for that of the public good.; also published in . The right to vote then provides the means for individuals to voice their support of or opposition to government. Their aggregated choices enable the will of the people to control the extent of power and perpetuity of governments, thus protecting society's rights and interests.; also published in . Thomas Paine, one of the Founding Fathers of the United States, said that the right to vote is critical in the protection of individual freedoms. He called it one of an individual's personal rights, which are \\"a species of property of the most sacred kind\\", and expressed the view that \\"[t]o take away this right is to reduce a man to slavery, ... subject to the will of another ... [T]o disfranchise any class of men is as criminal as the proposal to take away property\\".Paine, pp. 334 and 336. Paine's view was that there is no justification for one part of a community to deny another its right to vote on any basis, whether class, race, religion or political creed. His view survives in various international instruments such as Article 21(1) of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.Art. 21(1) of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, General Assembly Resolution 217A(III), U.N. G.A.O.R., 3d Sess., Supp. No. 13. U.N. Doc. A/180 (1948), p. 71, declares: \\"Everyone has the right to take part in the government of his country, directly or through freely chosen representatives\\". In the United States Supreme Court case Reynolds v. Sims (1964),Reynolds v. Sims , Supreme Court (US). Chief Justice Earl Warren wrote:Reynolds, pp. 555 and 561‚Äì562. The term representative democracy does not appear in the Constitution of Singapore.. However, an analogy may be drawn from the approach taken by the High Court of Australia to the Australian Constitution. In Lange v. Australian Broadcasting Corporation (1997),. the Court inferred that the Constitution embodies a system of representative and responsible government from various provisions, including those requiring periodic elections to choose the members of the Senate and the House of Representatives.Lange, pp. 557‚Äì559. Similarly, the Singapore Constitution prescribes that Parliament may be dissolved by the Prime Minister under certain conditions,Constitution, Arts. 65(2)‚Äì(3A). and will be automatically dissolved by operation of law five years from its first sitting.Constitution, Art. 65(4). A general election must be held within three months after each dissolution of Parliament.Constitution, Art. 66. The Constitution also states that \\"[t]he President shall be elected by the citizens of Singapore in accordance with any law made by the Legislature\\",Constitution, Art. 17(2). and requires a poll for the election to be held not more than three months before the incumbent's term of office expires, or, if the office is vacated before the expiry date, within six months of the date when it becomes vacant.Constitution, Art. 17(3). In addition, in the Proclamation of Singapore contained in the Independence of Singapore Agreement,. The Agreement appears in the Revised Edition of the Statutes of the Republic of Singapore in a section entitled \\"Constitutional Documents\\". which was entered into by the Governments of Malaysia and Singapore to effect Singapore's separation from Malaysia, the then Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew proclaimed on behalf of the people and the Government that as from 9 August 1965 \\"Singapore shall be forever a sovereign democratic and independent nation ...\\". Status of the right =Judicial view= In Taw Cheng Kong v. Public Prosecutor (1998),Taw Cheng Kong v. Public Prosecutor [1998] 1 S.L.R.(R.) [Singapore Law Reports (Reissue)] 78, High Court (Singapore). the High Court expressed the obiter view that the right to vote does not have constitutional status but is a privilege:Taw Cheng Kong, p. 102, para. 56 (emphasis added). =Government's view= The juridical status of the right to vote was subsequently debated in Parliament on 16 May 2001 upon an adjournment motion introduced by Non-constituency Member of Parliament Joshua Benjamin Jeyaretnam. Jeyaretnam argued that since \\"the marking of a ballot paper is an expression of the voter\\", the right to vote is protected by the freedom of expression clause set out in Article 14 of the Constitution of Singapore.. Responding, the Minister for Home Affairs, Wong Kan Seng, stated:. Minister for Law K. Shanmugam, who stated in Parliament on 13 February 2009 that the right to vote is an implied constitutional right The heading of section 38 of the Parliamentary Elections Act (\\"PEA\\"). is \\"Registers of electors to be conclusive evidence of right to vote\\". Subsection (1) provides that the current register of electors is conclusive evidence for determining whether a person is entitled to vote at an election, and subsection (2) states that a person's \\"right and duty of voting\\" is not prejudiced if there is an appeal pending as to whether his or her name is properly on the register. The status of the right to vote was again considered in Parliament in 2009. During debates on the Ministry of Law's annual budget on 12 February, Nominated Member of Parliament Thio Li-ann asked if the right to vote is \\"a constitutional right and part of the fundamental law of the land, or merely a statutory right, regulated by ordinary law?\\". Replying to Thio the following day, Minister for Law K. Shanmugam referred to the 2001 debate on the matter and confirmed that, having conferred with the Attorney-General, in the Government's view the right to vote is an implied constitutional right arising from various provisions of the Constitution, including Articles 65 and 66.. Article 65 sets out the requirements for the prorogation and dissolution of Parliament. Articles 65(2) to 65(3A) explain when the Prime Minister may dissolve Parliament, while Article 65(4) specifically provides that Parliament has a fixed term: \\"Parliament, unless sooner dissolved, shall continue for 5 years from the date of its first sitting and shall then stand dissolved.\\" Article 66 states: \\"There shall be a general election at such time, within 3 months after every dissolution of Parliament, as the President shall, by Proclamation in the Gazette, appoint.\\" The Minister also said: As regards the High Court's view in Taw Cheng Kong, the Minister noted that it could not be treated as a precedent since \\"[t]he legal nature of the citizens' right to vote was not an issue in that case and was not specifically argued\\". Thio Li- ann has commented that the Minister's clarification \\"dealt the quietus est to the High Court's odd pronouncement in Taw Cheng Kong v. Public Prosecutor\\".. Quietus est means \\"he is discharged\\": . Proposals to express the right in the Constitution =1966 Constitutional Commission= On 18 January 1966, shortly after Singapore's independence, the President appointed a Constitutional Commission led by Chief Justice Wee Chong Jin to consider how the rights of racial, linguistic, and religious minorities in the nascent nation should be protected.. In its report on 27 August 1966,, reproduced in . the Commission recommended entrenching the right to vote as a \\"fundamental right\\" in the form of \\"the right to elect a government of their choice as expressed in general elections held at reasonable periodic intervals by secret vote\\".Report of the Constitutional Commission, 1966, para. 43. The chief justification for this proposal was the relatively infant or immature culture of democracy in a newly independent nation that was \\"barely one year old\\".Thio, \\"Westminster Constitutions and Implied Fundamental Rights\\", p. 410. The report noted that citizens had only exercised the right to vote twice in general elections, in 1959 and 1963 respectively. Hence: However, Parliament decided not to entrench the right to vote, instead relegating voting rights to statutory regulation under the Parliamentary Elections Act. =2009 parliamentary debate= During the 2009 parliamentary debate on the right to vote's status, Thio Li-ann proposed that, to avoid doubt, the right should be specifically set out in the Constitution. She argued that entrenching the right to vote through an Article in the Constitution would provide the opportunity to protect the details of the right. Currently, voting is regulated by the PEA. As it is an ordinary statute, it can be altered with a simple parliamentary majority by future governments seeking to amend or restrict voting rights. Thio said that expressing the right to vote clearly in the Constitution would allow aspects of that right such as voter secrecy and the universality and equality of votes to be protected from unjust manipulation. A copy of the 1999 Reprint of the Constitution of Singapore However, the Minister for Law said the Government was of the opinion that as the right to vote is an implied right in the Constitution, it was unnecessary for the Constitution to be amended to expressly mention the right. Articles 65 and 66 of the Constitution would be entrenched once Article 5(2A) is brought into force. That Article, which has remained in abeyance since it was introduced in 1991, provides that a bill that seeks to amend, among other things, Article 65 or 66, must be supported at a national referendum by not less than two-thirds of the votes cast, unless the President consents to the amendment. Shanmugam went on to state that the concerns of the 1966 Constitutional Commission were now moot, as Singapore had since experienced ten general elections with a 95% voter turnout each time. Therefore, it could be assumed that the idea and experience of voting were deeply ingrained in Singaporean voters. Furthermore, some countries choose to draft their constitutions in great detail while others, like Singapore, set out a basic philosophy.This view was repeated by Chong Wan Yieng, Press Secretary to the Minister for Law, in a letter to Today newspaper. She stated that Singapore's legal heritage was a broadly worded constitution: He noted that countries such as North Korea and Myanmar were among those that had set out the right to vote within their constitutions. Shanmugam concluded that what was fundamental to protecting the right to vote was a Government committed to the rule of law. Following the parliamentary debate, in a 2009 article Thio elaborated that entrenching the right to vote in the Constitution would make it significantly more difficult for any corrupt government that came into power to curtail it, as a super-majority of at least two-thirds of all elected Members of Parliament would be needed before a constitutional amendment could be made.Constitution, Art. 5(2). Otherwise, with control over a simple majority of Parliament,Constitution, Art. 57(1): \\"Subject to this Constitution, all questions proposed for decision in Parliament shall be determined by a majority of the votes of the Members present and voting ...\\". a ruling party, if it chose to, could direct amendments to the PEA or create new legislation to provide some citizens with, say, double the number of votes and protect this from constitutional challenge using a notwithstanding clause (that is, a provision stated to have legal effect despite the existence of other inconsistent laws). By not protecting such an important right, the freedom of Singapore's electoral system could be progressively curtailed.Thio, \\"Westminster Constitutions and Implied Fundamental Rights\\", pp. 425‚Äì426. A similar point has been made by Singapore Management University constitutional law professor Jack Lee who noted that since Article 66 does not define the term general election:. Thio also argued that without a constitutionally expressed right to vote, the judiciary is handicapped in interpreting this implied right, given its conservative approach to reading the Constitution and the fact that it is unlikely to appeal to normative ideas such as representative democracy. Judicial implication of the right in the Constitution Despite the Government's unequivocal view that the right to vote is an implied constitutional right, in Singapore it is the courts that ultimately determine the meaning of the Constitution. Thio Li-ann has suggested that since the right's status is not likely to be brought before the courts in a dispute, the Cabinet should refer the matter to the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore Tribunal pursuant to Article 100 of the Constitution for an authoritative opinion.Thio, \\"Westminster Constitutions and Implied Fundamental Rights\\", p. 419. Thio has argued that a court convened to determine whether the right to vote exists in the Constitution would give serious weight to the Minister of Law's pronouncements on the status of the right, as to agree with it would affirm rather than challenge executive or legislative power. Also, section 9A of the Interpretation Act. requires a purposive interpretation of written law, including the Constitution, to \\"promote the purpose or object underlying the written law\\".Interpretation Act, s. 9A(1). Sections 9A(3)(c) and (d) identify ministerial speeches made at the second readings of bills or \\"any relevant material in any official record of debates in Parliament\\" as appropriate aspects of the interpretive matrix.Thio, \\"Westminster Constitutions and Implied Fundamental Rights\\", pp. 419‚Äì420. The court might then take one or both of the following approaches. =Originalist interpretation= The courts may choose to establish an imputed intention or traditional understanding of the existence of a right to vote, derived from the drafting style associated with the drafters of Westminster constitutions rather than the drafted text as it is. Thio has said that the framers of the Constitution worked with certain assumptions which they did not make explicit. In Hinds v. The Queen (1975),. the Privy Council said that:Hinds, p. 212. The court in Hinds held that, as \\"a rule of construction applicable to constitutional instruments\\" adopting the Westminster system, the \\"absence of express words\\" did not prevent the judicial powers of the new state being exclusively exercised by the judicature\\". Similarly, the right to vote was necessarily implied into the Constitution through its genesis as an adaptation of the Westminster system of democracy.Thio, \\"Westminster Constitutions and Implied Fundamental Rights\\", pp. 421‚Äì422. =Interpretation based on text and structure= Thio has also argued that the courts may find that an implied right to vote can be derived from the existing structure of the Constitution and a purposive reading of Articles 65 and 66. According to this reading, a constitutional right to vote must be logically or practically necessary for preserving the integrity of that structure, as constitutionally established. In Articles 25 and 26 of the Constitution, the appointment of the Prime Minister requires that he commands \\"the confidence of the majority of the Members of Parliament\\". As the Constitution places emphasis on the need for democratic legitimacy as well as general elections, it may be reasonable to infer that the structure of the Constitution provides for a right to vote as a fundamental instrument of democratic legitimacy.Thio, \\"Westminster Constitutions and Implied Fundamental Rights\\", p. 423. Exercise of the vote The Parliamentary Elections Act regulates the exercise of the vote and sets out the procedures for parliamentary elections in Singapore. The right to vote in Singapore extends only to Singapore citizens who are ordinarily resident in Singapore and not less than 21 years oldPEA, s. 5(1). When preparing or revising a register of electors, a Singapore citizen who has been issued an identity card on or before 1 January is presumed, unless the contrary is proved, to have been ordinarily resident in Singapore on that date, to be at least 21 years old if he or she appears to be of that age based on the records held by the Commissioner of National Registration, and to reside in the electoral division and polling district in which his address is as shown in the Commissioner's records on 1 January: s. 5(2). on the cut-off date for the registration of electors. This is known as the \\"prescribed date\\", and is currently 1 January of a particular year.PEA, s. 5(4) and the Parliamentary Elections (Prescribed Date) Order 2011 (S 3/2011). A person is considered to be ordinarily resident in Singapore on 1 January in a year if he or she has lived in the country for a total of 30 days during the three years immediately before that date, even if on 1 January the person is not resident in the country.PEA, s. 5(1A). Whether people are entitled to vote at a presidential election also depends on whether they are entitled to have their names entered or retained in a register of electors maintained under the PEA., s. 21. Singapore has a one person, one vote system: plural voting ‚Äì that is, voting more than once in the electoral division that one is assigned to, or voting in more than one electoral division ‚Äì is illegal.PEA, s. 7. Following a relative swing in votes against the ruling People's Action Party government in the general election of 1984, the Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew raised the possibility of modifications to the one person, one vote system and said: \\"It is necessary to try and put some safeguards into the way in which people use their votes to bargain, coerce, to push, to jostle and get what they want without running the risk of losing the services of the government, because one day, by mistake, they will lose the services of the government.\\". Subsequently, in an interview to the US magazine Foreign Affairs in January 1994, Lee, now Senior Minister, suggested that a person between the ages of 40 and 60 with a family should be given two votes because \\"he is likely to be more careful, voting also for his children. He is more likely to vote in a serious way than a capricious young man under 30. But we haven't found it necessary yet. If it became necessary, we should do it. ... I'm not intellectually convinced that one-man, one-vote is the best. We practise it because that's what the British bequeathed us and we haven't really found a need to challenge that.\\"; ; . See also ; ; ; . In a later media interview published in The Straits Times on 8 May 1994, Lee said:. Lee suggested that such a change should perhaps be implemented \\"in 15 to 20 years\\" if Singapore's birth rate had not increased, as policies might then be disproportionately influenced by people aged 60 and over. However, he emphasized that these were his personal views and had not been discussed by the Cabinet.See also ; ; ; . To date, no such modification to the voting system has been made. =Overseas voting= Prior to May 2001, voters who were overseas on polling day could not vote. Operational concerns such as insufficient Singapore missions around the world, the possibility that the last known addresses of Singapore citizens overseas might not be current, and the difficulty of keeping track of citizens who were abroad, were cited for this restriction.. Some commentators took the view that such logistical issues should not deprive Singaporeans of their \\"sacred right to vote\\".Lua, Sim & Koh, p. 279. Embassy of Singapore in Washington, D.C., which is one of the venues used as a polling station for overseas voting in Singapore elections Overseas voting was eventually introduced for both parliamentary and presidential elections with effect from 15 May 2001.By the Parliamentary Elections (Amendment) Act 2001 (No. 19 of 2001) which, according to the Parliamentary Elections (Amendment) Act (Commencement) Notification 2001 (S 272/2001), came into force on 15 May 2001. Overseas voting for presidential elections was effected by changes to the Presidential Elections Act which were made by the Parliamentary Elections (Amendment) Act 2001, s. 27 and the Sch. Speaking during the Second Reading of the bill that led to the change in the law, the Minister for Home Affairs, Wong Kan Seng, said that the Government recognized that increasing numbers of Singaporeans studied and worked abroad due to economic globalization. Thus, it had decided to introduce overseas voting on a small scale at the next general elections.. At that time, the law generally required overseas voters to have resided in Singapore for an aggregate of two years during the five-year period before the prescribed date. However, Singaporeans whom the Government had posted abroad were exempted from this requirement and so were their families.PEA (1999 Rev. Ed.), s. 5(1A)(a), inserted by the Parliamentary Elections (Amendment) Act 2001, s. 3(a). The Minister explained that this requirement for residence in Singapore was a \\"necessary pre-condition to constituency representation and to prevent plural voting\\".Wong Kan Seng, speech during the Second Reading of the Parliamentary Elections (Amendment) Bill (19 April 2001), col. 1508. J.B. Jeyaretnam criticized this restriction as discriminating against overseas voters.Jeyaretnam, speech during the Second Reading of the Parliamentary Elections (Amendment) Bill (19 April 2001), col. 1528.Jeyaretnam, \\"Is Voting a Privilege or a Right?\\" (16 May 2001), col. 1722. However, following the terrorist attacks that occurred in the United States on 11 September 2001 and American military action in Afghanistan on 7 October, the Government decided to temporarily suspend overseas voting at the 2001 general election as having large numbers of Singaporeans congregating at known locations at known times could put them at risk of further terrorist attacks.. The suspension was effected by the Parliamentary Elections (Temporary Suspension of Overseas Voting) Act 2001 (No. 45 of 2001), which was deemed to have come into force on 26 September 2001: s. 1\\\\. The Act suspended the provisions of the PEA allowing for the registration of overseas electors and providing for overseas voting \\"until polling day of the first general election after the date of commencement of this Act\\" (s. 2), and thus ceased to have effect after the 2001 general election. Therefore, overseas voting first took place at the 2006 general election. The number of Singapore citizens who registered to vote overseas was 1,017, and of these, 553 resided in the 16 constituencies that were contested in the election. Eventually, 335 electors voted at eight polling stations around the world.. With effect from 3 March 2009, the residence requirement for overseas voters was reduced to an aggregate of 30 days during the three years immediately before the prescribed date, and the special dispensation of the requirement applying to citizens working or studying abroad at the Government's direction and their families was removed.PEA (2007 Rev. Ed.), s. 5(1A), as amended by the Parliamentary Elections (Amendment) Act 2008 (No. 14 of 2008), s. 3(a). The change was described in Parliament as a measure to \\"allow more overseas Singaporeans to vote. All an overseas Singaporean needs to do is to come home for 10 days a year to visit his family and friends.\\"Wong Kan Seng, speech during the Second Reading of the Parliamentary Elections (Amendment) Bill (25 August 2008), col. 3014ff. =Limitations on voting= A person is disqualified from voting in the following situations, which include engaging in acts incompatible with being a Singapore citizen, being of unsound mind, or being in prison for committing a criminal offence: *Acts incompatible with Singapore citizenship. **Applying for or acquiring citizenship of another country.PEA, s. 6(1)(a)(i). **Voluntarily claiming or exercising rights in a country outside Singapore, such rights being given exclusively to nationals of that country.PEA, s. 6(1)(a)(ii) read with s. 6(1)(3). **Taking an oath of allegiance to any foreign power.PEA, s. 6(1)(a)(iii). **Applying to another country for a passport of that country.PEA, s. 6(1)(a)(iv). **Being a serving member of any foreign armed force, unless the person is domiciled in Singapore.PEA, s. 6(1)(e). *Being of unsound mind. **Being found to be of unsound mind.PEA, s. 6(1)(c). *Commission of a criminal offence. **Being in prison in any country for an offence punishable with imprisonment for at least 12 months, being under sentence of death, or having been accused or convicted of an offence punishable with at least 12 months' imprisonment and having a warrant of arrest relating to the offence in force.PEA, ss. 6(1)(b), 6(1A) and 6(2). **Having been convicted of a corrupt or illegal practice under the PEA or the Presidential Elections Act, or disenfranchised due to a report by an election judge.PEA, s. 6(1)(d). Voting in an electoral division that one is not assigned to, or engaging in plural voting amounts to an illegal practice. *Removal from register of electors. **Having had his or her name removed from the register of electors, and not having had it restored.PEA, ss. 6(1)(g) and (h). Voting in foreign elections Singapore citizens who vote in foreign countries may lose their right to vote in Singapore. The relevant provisions are section 6(1)(a)(ii) read with section 6(3) of the PEA: One issue that has arisen is whether a Singaporean who votes in a foreign country where the right to vote is not exclusive to nationals of that country is disqualified from voting in a Singapore election. For instance, the United Kingdom permits citizens of Commonwealth countries, including Singapore,Representation of the People Act 1983 (1983 c. 2) (UK), ss. 1(1) and 2(1) read with the British Nationality Act 1981 (1981 c. 61) (UK), s. 37(1)(b) and the 3rd Sch. who are resident in the UK and have leave to remain there (or do not require such leave) to register to vote in general elections and local government elections.Representation of the People Act 1983, s. 4(6); see also . When queried, the Elections Department stated that since suffrage in the UK is not exclusive to British citizens, Singaporeans who vote there are still eligible to vote in Singapore. However, this interpretation of the PEA has not been tested in court.. Voting by prisoners Another potentially controversial provision is section 6(1)(b) of the Parliamentary Elections Act, which denies suffrage to convicted criminals serving jail sentences. The provision states: In addition, section 6(1A) provides as follows: The issue of the constitutionality of this restriction has not yet arisen in any Singapore court, but during a Parliamentary debate in May 2001, Non-constituency Member of Parliament J.B. Jeyaretnam challenged the provision as unconstitutional. The Singapore position may be compared with the situation in other jurisdictions. In Malaysia, the right to vote is entrenched in Article 119 of the Federal Constitution, but suffrage is similarly denied to those serving prison terms.Constitution of Malaysia, Art. 119(3). In Yazid bin Sufaat v. Suruhanjaya Pilihanraya Malaysia (2009),Yazid bin Sufaat v. Suruhanjaya Pilihanraya Malaysia [2009] 6 M.L.J. [Malayan Law Journal] 222, Court of Appeal (Malaysia). it was held that while detainees under the Internal Security Act 1960Internal Security Act 1960 (Act 82, 2006 Reprint), archived from the original on 22 July 2011. ‚Äì who have not been convicted of any crime ‚Äì still enjoy the right to vote in national elections, that right may only be exercised only in the constituencies they are registered in, and does not extend to allowing them to vote while incarcerated elsewhere.Yazid bin Sufaat, pp. 229 and 235, paras. 3 and 30‚Äì31. A survey of European countries reported in Hirst v. United Kingdom (No. 2) (2005), (Grand Chamber). a judgment of the European Court of Human Rights, found that 18 states allowed prisoners to vote without restriction (Albania, Azerbaijan, Croatia, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, Germany, Iceland, Lithuania, Macedonia, Moldova, Montenegro, the Netherlands, Portugal, Slovenia, Sweden, Switzerland and Ukraine), while in 13 states all prisoners were not allowed to vote (Armenia, Belgium, Bulgaria, Cyprus, Estonia, Georgia, Hungary, Ireland, Russia, Serbia, Slovakia, Turkey and the United Kingdom). In another 13 states, the right to vote could be restricted in some way (Austria, Bosnia and Herzegovina, France, Greece, Italy, Luxembourg, Malta, Norway, Poland, Romania, Spain, Latvia and Liechtenstein).Hirst, para. 33. In Hirst, the UK Government's denial of the vote to prisoners was ruled contrary to Protocol 1, Article 3, of the European Convention on Human Rights, which protects the right to regular, free and fair elections. The European Court said that the UK had to justify any deviation from universal suffrage, but the UK Government has so far desisted from applying the judgment after the House of Commons voted on 10 February 2012 to maintain the country's blanket ban on voting by prisoners.. A woman distributing copies of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. Section 3 of the Charter guarantees the right to vote. In Canada, the Supreme Court held in Sauv√© v. Canada (Chief Electoral Officer) (2002),. that a statutory provision prohibiting prisoners serving a sentence of two years or more from voting unjustifiably infringed the fundamental right to vote guaranteed by section 3 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, Pt. I of the Constitution Act, 1982 (Canada), itself Sch. B of the Canada Act 1982 (1982 c. 11) (UK). The Court noted that the Government could not demonstrate how denying prisoners the vote helped the stated aims of the relevant statute; a democracy built on inclusiveness, democracy and citizen participation cannot be party to a law that disenfranchises a considerable part of the population. There was also no credible theory why prisoners should be denied the right to vote as a form of punishment, as it is arbitrary and not related to the offender's criminal act nor does it deter crime or rehabilitate criminals.Sauv√©, paras. 20‚Äì53. The foregoing cases may be contrasted with the position in the United States. The Supreme Court of the United States held in Richardson v. Ramirez (1974)Richardson v. Ramirez , Supreme Court (US). that a California statute permanently removing the right to vote from any person convicted of an \\"infamous crime\\" unless the right to vote was restored by court order or executive pardon did not violate the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. The Court noted that there was explicit constitutional approval for laws disenfranchising felons since section 2 of the Amendment reduced a state's representation in Congress if the state has denied the right to vote for any reason \\"except for participation in rebellion, or other crime\\". Thus, it was unnecessary for the statute in question to be narrowly tailored to serve compelling state interests to be consistent with equal protection.Richardson, pp. 54‚Äì56.

An application can be made to the Court for judicial review on the basis of an error as to a precedent fact, which is a form of illegality. Errors as to precedent facts, sometimes called jurisdictional facts, in Singapore administrative law are errors committed by public authorities concerning facts that must objectively exist or not exist before the authorities have the power to take actions or make decisions under legislation. If an error concerning a precedent fact is made, the statutory power has not been exercised lawfully and may be quashed by the High Court if judicial review is applied for by an aggrieved person. The willingness of the Court to review such errors of fact is an exception to the general rule that the Court only reviews errors of law. In the United Kingdom, the House of Lords has held that the nature of the decision-making process that the public authority is required to engage in determines whether a matter falls into the precedent fact category. If the process is complex and much discretion is accorded to the authority by the empowering statute, the court is unlikely to find that a precedent fact is involved. On the other hand, where an administrative decision interferes with an individual's liberty, the matter will be considered within the precedent fact category unless Parliament has explicitly excluded judicial review. If Parliament intends to do so, it must make its meaning crystal clear. As Singapore inherited English administrative law upon independence, the Singapore courts have adopted the UK position, holding that it is necessary to construe the relevant statutory provisions to ascertain whether Parliament has expressed an intention in plain and unequivocal words to take a discretion conferred on the executive out of the precedent fact category. Introduction =Distinction between errors of law and errors of fact= Errors of law committed by public authorities when they act or make decisions are within the jurisdiction of the High Court of Singapore to correct by way of judicial review. On the other hand, the Court is generally unwilling to intervene where the alleged error is one that concerns the facts of the matter. The rationale for this rule is that it is the Court's role in judicial review of administrative action to scrutinize the legality and not the merits of the decisions of public authorities.. It has been said that an error of fact involves a situation where there are new or different primary facts yet to be put before the court, such as a new witness, or what people saw or heard, whereas an error of law involves a misinterpretation of a statutory word or phrase with regard to such facts.See, for example, , in which the House of Lords held that an incorrect interpretation of a statutory phrase by the tax authorities amounted to an error of law that was judicially reviewable. For further discussion, see . However, this distinction is debatable, and the view has been taken that courts sometimes simply regard a matter as one involving an error of law if they wish to adopt an interventionist approach, and seek to allow judicial review to take place.. In Re Fong Thin Choo (1991),Re Fong Thin Choo [1991] 1 S.L.R.(R.) [Singapore Law Reports (Reissue)] 774, High Court (Singapore). the High Court accepted that if an authority's discretion depends on the existence of certain facts, the court must ensure that those facts exist and have been taken into account by the authority, that the authority has exercised its discretion on a proper self-direction as to those facts, and that the authority has not taken into account matters it ought not to have considered.Fong Thin Choo, pp. 784‚Äì785, para. 27, citing . Law professor Thio Li-ann has expressed the view that this decision indicates a court is primarily concerned with whether an error that has been committed is serious ‚Äì if so, the court will exercise judicial review, regardless of whether the error is jurisdictional or non- jurisdictional in nature. \\"Since the law/fact boundary becomes indistinct, this fudges the conceptual moorings of judicial review as confined to scrutinising legal error. An intrusive review of factual findings threatens to turn review into appeal.\\". =Mixed fact and law= Occasionally, the distinction between errors of law and errors of fact can be fuzzy. Where a public authority is alleged to have committed an error of mixed fact and law, the High Court is more likely to leave the matter to the authority and decline to intervene. This can be the case where a statutory term evaluated by the authority is so general and ambiguous that reasonable people may peg different meanings to it. In such a situation, it is generally left to the authority to evaluate the meaning of the term. This is illustrated by Puhlhofer v. Hillingdon London Borough Council (1986),. which involved a public authority that bore a statutory responsibility for providing homeless people with accommodation. The applicants were a married couple who lived with their two children in a single room in a guest house. Their application for permanent accommodation was rejected because the authority claimed they were not \\"homeless\\" within the meaning of the statute. The House of Lords upheld this decision, determining that the issue of whether the applicants had accommodation was a question of fact to be determined by the public authority:Puhlhofer, p. 518. Errors as to precedent facts An error as to a jurisdictional, or precedent, fact is an exception to the general rule that the High Court does not judicially review errors of fact. Under the threefold classification of the broad grounds of judicial review set out in Council of Civil Service Unions v. Minister for the Civil Service (\\"the GCHQ case\\", 1983) (\\"the GCHQ case\\"), applied in Chng Suan Tze v. Minister for Home Affairs _SGCA_16.html [1988] SGCA 16], [1988] 2 S.L.R.(R.) 525 at 563, para. 119, Court of Appeal (Singapore), archived from the original on 24 December 2011. ‚Äì illegality, irrationality and procedural impropriety ‚Äì an error as to a precedent fact may be regarded as a form of illegality.See Leyland & Anthony, pp. 273‚Äì274, which discusses errors as to precedent facts in a chapter dealing with illegality. An error as to a precedent fact, if committed, deprives the public authority of power to take the action or make the decision in question. The existence or non-existence of the fact, as the case may be, is a condition precedent or prerequisite to the exercise of the power.Leyland & Anthony, p. 273. An example of an error of this nature can be found in the United Kingdom case White & Collins v. Minister of Health (1939).White & Collins v. Minister of Health [1939] 2 K.B. 838, Court of Appeal (England & Wales). In that case, under the relevant statute, the authority could only issue a compulsory purchase order affecting the applicants' land if it was not part of, among other things, a park. A minister confirmed the purchase order but the Court of Appeal of England and Wales held that it should be quashed, finding that the minister could not exercise power to acquire the land since it was part of a park. Whether the land was or was not a park was a precedent fact, and the minister had committed an error concerning this fact.White, pp. 855‚Äì856. =United Kingdom position= The control tower of London Heathrow Airport in October 2007. A 1980 House of Lords case involved an appellant who had been detained by immigration authorities for gaining entry into the United Kingdom at the airport by deception. The appellant unsuccessfully challenged his detention, the court holding that the authorities' decision did not involve any precedent fact. Courts in the United Kingdom have stated that the precedent fact doctrine is not applicable to all statutes. In Zamir v. Secretary of State for the Home Department (1980),. it was held that the statute in question did not fall into the \\"precedent fact\\" category, having regard to the discretionary nature of the power conferred on the public authority. The appellant Zamir, a Pakistani immigrant, was granted an entry certificate to enter the country on the basis that he was unmarried and intending to join his father, who had lived in England since 1962, as a dependent. Less than three months after the issuance of the certificate, the appellant married, and about a month later, in March 1976, he arrived in the UK at London Heathrow Airport and was granted leave by an immigration officer to enter the country for an indefinite period. The officer did not ask if the appellant was married and neither did the appellant volunteer this information. A son was subsequently born in Pakistan to the appellant and his wife, and in 1978 the appellant's wife and son applied for permission to join the appellant in the UK. At that point, the validity of the appellant's entry into the country in 1976 was queried. Following investigations, he was detained with a view to removal from the UK on the ground that he had obtained an entry certificate by deception. His detention was found to be lawful by the Divisional Court and the Court of Appeal. Before the House of Lords, one of the legal issues that arose was the basis for judicial review of the conclusion of the Home Secretary or the immigration officer that the appellant's leave to enter the UK was vitiated by deception.Zamir, pp. 945‚Äì947. Counsel for the appellant argued that this was not a case of a decision reviewable on ordinary administrative law grounds, but rather a case where the exercise of the power depended \\"upon the precedent establishment of an objective fact\\".Zamir, p. 948. However, the House of Lords disagreed with the argument. It held that the nature and process of the decision conferred upon immigration officers was inconsistent with the requirements for the establishment of any precedent facts. This was because the immigration officer had to consider a \\"complex of statutory rules and non-statutory guidelines and other documentary evidence whose genuineness is doubtful, statements which cannot be verified, misunderstandings as to what was said, practices and attitudes in a foreign state which have to be estimated. There is room for appreciation, even for discretion.\\"Zamir, p. 949. On the other hand, the court was not well placed to determine which of several conflicting statements made by the appellant were true, or to decide if other factors were material to the immigration officer's decision. The court had to determine the case based on affidavit evidence and, though cross-examination on such evidence was permissible, this did not usually occur in practice. As the case did not fall into the precedent fact category, the court was unable to judicially review the decision. The House of Lords modified its holding in Zamir in the later decision Khera v. Secretary of State for Home Department; Khawaja v. Secretary of State for the Home Department (\\"Khawaja\\", 1983). (\\"Khawaja\\"). The facts of this case, which involved two separate appellants, were similar to those of Zamir. Khera had entered the country by allegedly deceiving a medical officer into thinking he was not married. An answer to the contrary would have precluded him from being given leave to enter the UK. The other appellant, Khawaja, having unsuccessfully applied for a UK visa in Brussels, entered the UK by flying into Manchester, saying he would stay for one week and then return to Brussels to continue his studies. Facts later surfaced proving that, at the time of his entry, contrary to his declaration that he was single, he had been married to a woman who had entered the UK on the same flight but had been attended to by a different immigration officer and was granted indefinite leave to remain in the UK as a returning resident. Both of them were detained as \\"illegal immigrants\\".Khawaja, pp. 93‚Äì96. The House of Lords held that Zamir ought not to be followed as its reasoning would affect the judicial protection of those whose liberty the executive is seeking to interfere with. Lord Fraser of Tullybelton, who was one of the judges hearing the Zamir appeal, said that the case had wrongly stated the court's function as only seeing if there were reasonable grounds for decisions made by the immigration authorities.Khawaja, p. 98. In his view:Khawaja, p. 97. According to Lord Scarman, Zamir limited the scope of judicial review to the Wednesbury principle. ‚Äì in other words, the court will not intervene to quash a decision of a statutory authority unless it can be shown that the authority acted unreasonably. He held that although the principle is correct in appropriate circumstances, \\"it cannot extend to interference with liberty unless Parliament has unequivocably enacted that it should\\".Khawaja, p. 109. He emphasized that if Parliament wished to exclude judicial review of the exercise of a power that restrained liberty, \\"it must make its meaning crystal clear\\".Khawaja, p. 111. On the facts, since Parliament had not clearly expressed any intention to exclude judicial review of discretion exercised by the immigration authorities, the statutory provision in question fell within the precedent fact category. Ultimately, Khera's appeal was allowed as the authorities had not successfully demonstrated that he had obtained permission to enter the UK by deception. Conversely, since Khawaja had clearly deceived an immigration officer concerning his marital status, his appeal was dismissed.Khawaja, p. 76 (headnote). =Singapore position= Parliament House in October 2002. In Chng Suan Tze v. Minister for Home Affairs (1988), the Court of Appeal held that sections 8 and 10 of the Internal Security Act did not contain any precedent fact since, by enacting them, Parliament had unambiguously entrusted discretion to the executive. The courts in Singapore have followed the legal position on errors as to precedent facts in the United Kingdom. This is illustrated by the High Court case Lau Seng Poh v. Controller of Immigration (1985),Lau Seng Poh v. Controller of Immigration [1985‚Äì1986] S.L.R.(R.) 180, H.C. (Singapore). which held that if a precedent fact is a prerequisite to the exercise of executive power, the court is responsible for deciding if the precedent fact has been satisfied.Lau Seng Poh, p. 186, para. 12, citing Khawaja, p. 108. Khawaja was also cited but distinguished in Re Mohamed Saleem Ismail [1987] S.L.R.(R.) 380 at 384‚Äì385, para. 12, H.C. (Singapore). This principle was affirmed by the Court of Appeal case Chng Suan Tze v. Minister for Home Affairs (1988), which applied the principle set out in Khawaja and its departure from the approach taken in Zamir. In the case, the Court examined whether it could review the executive's discretionary power under sections 8 and 10 of the Internal Security Act (\\"ISA\\").. Section 8 empowers the Minister for Home Affairs to make an order directing that a person be detained without trial if the President is satisfied that detention is necessary to prevent the person from endangering, among other things, the security or public order of Singapore, while section 10 allows the Minister to suspend detention orders and to revoke suspensions as he or she thinks fit. Delivering the judgment of the Court, Chief Justice Wee Chong Jin held that the scope of judicial review depends on whether a precedent fact is involved. If the discretion falls outside the precedent fact category, the scope of judicial review is limited to the normal judicial review principles of illegality, irrationality (that is, Wednesbury unreasonableness) and procedural impropriety.Chng Suan Tze, p. 563, para. 119. On the other hand, if one or more precedent facts are involved, the scope of judicial review \\"extends to deciding whether the evidence justifies the decision\\".Chng Suan Tze, pp. 559‚Äì560, para. 108. However:Chng Suan Tze, p. 560, para. 108. The Court decided that both sections 8 and 10 of the ISA fell outside the precedent fact category. Section 8(1) expressly stated, \\"in plain and unequivocal terms, that it is for the President to be satisfied that detention is necessary with a view to preventing the detainee from acting in any manner prejudicial to national security and the decision had been entrusted to the President\\".Chng Suan Tze, p. 562, para. 117. Similarly, the decision whether there was evidence to revoke an order under section 10 in the public interest had expressly been entrusted to the Minister by the Act. In addition, since the Court was of the view that the judicial process was not suitable for determining issues involving national security, it did not think that Parliament could have intended for a court of law to determine whether, on the evidence, a detainee was likely to pose a security risk.Chng Suan Tze, pp. 562‚Äì563, paras. 117‚Äì118. See also Teo Soh Lung v. Minister for Home Affairs [1988] 2 S.L.R.(R.) 30 at 43, para. 40, H.C. (Singapore); Cheng Vincent v. Minister for Home Affairs [1990] 1 S.L.R.(R.) 38 at 47, para. 22, H.C. (Singapore). Consequently, the Court could not go beyond determining if the detention decisions violated administrative law rules relating to illegality, irrationality or procedural impropriety. In contrast, in Fong Thin Choo, the High Court expressed the view that under regulation 12(6) of the Customs Regulations 1979,Customs Regulations 1979 (Gazette Notification No. S 261/1979). the fact that goods had not been exported from Singapore was a precedent fact to the customs officer's power to require the owner of the goods to pay customs duty. Therefore, the Court had to decide whether the customs officer's decision was justified by the evidence, and not merely whether there was some evidence on which he could reasonably have reached his decision.Fong Thin Choo, p. 787, para. 33. However, the Court did not pursue the point since the applicant had not argued the case on this basis.Fong Thin Choo, p. 787, para. 35.

Applications for judicial review of administrative actions, in which prerogative orders may be sought, are made to the High Court which is housed in this building. The remedies available in Singapore administrative law are the prerogative orders ‚Äì the mandatory order (formerly known as mandamus), prohibiting order (prohibition), quashing order (certiorari), and order for review of detention (habeas corpus) ‚Äì and the declaration, a form of equitable remedy. In Singapore, administrative law is the branch of law that enables a person to challenge an exercise of power by the executive branch of the Government. The challenge is carried out by applying to the High Court for judicial review. The Court's power to review a law or an official act of a government official is part of its supervisory jurisdiction, and at its fullest may involve quashing an action or decision and ordering that it be redone or remade. A mandatory order is an order of the High Court commanding a public authority to perform a public duty, while a prohibiting order operates to prevent illegal action by an authority from occurring in the first place. A quashing order, the most commonly sought prerogative order, has the effect of invalidating an ultra vires decision made by an authority. Obtaining a mandatory, prohibiting or quashing order is a two-stage process, as an applicant must be granted leave by the Court to apply for the order. The Court must find the existence of a proper public law issue and available grounds of review. Leave will be granted provided that an arguable and prima facie case of reasonable suspicion that the authority has acted in breach of administrative law rules is established. An order for review of detention directs someone holding a person in detention to produce the detainee before the High Court so that the legality of the detention can be established. The power of the Court to require that this be done is specifically mentioned in Article 9(2) of the Constitution of Singapore. While the other prerogative orders may only be applied for with the court's permission, an order for review of detention may be applied for without prior permission from the court. A declaration is a pronouncement by a court stating the legal position between the parties to an action, based on the facts that have been presented to the court. Before 1 May 2011, it was not possible to apply for prerogative orders and declarations in the same set of legal proceedings. Following that date, changes to Order 53 of the Rules of Court permitted an application for a declaration to be made together with an application for one or more prerogative orders. However, the application for a declaration cannot be made unless the court grants leave for the prerogative orders to be applied for. The Government Proceedings Act bars the High Court from granting injunctions against the Government or one of its officers. An injunction is an equitable private law remedy that restrains a public authority from doing an act that is wrongful or ultra vires. In place of an injunction, the Court may make a declaration concerning the parties' rights. At common law, there is no general right to claim damages ‚Äì that is, monetary compensation ‚Äì if rules of public law have been breached by an authority. In order to obtain damages, an aggrieved person must be able to establish a private law claim in contract or tort law. Introduction =Supervisory jurisdiction of the High Court= The aim of administrative law is to regulate the executive government by providing remedies which individuals can apply for when challenging administrative actions and decisions, and failures to take action and make decisions. Where the exercise of statutory or other discretionary power by public authorities contravenes the Constitution or is unlawful under administrative law, various remedies may be available when a judicial review action is taken. Judicial review, the means by which the High Court controls the exercise of legislative and executive power, is part of the Court's supervisory jurisdiction. The basis of this jurisdiction was affirmed by the Court of Appeal in Ng Chye Huey v. Public Prosecutor (2007). as inherent in nature, that is, deriving from the common law rather than statute., cited in Haron bin Mundir v. Singapore Amateur Athletic Association [1991] 2 S.L.R.(R.) 494 at 500‚Äì501, para. 18, High Court (Singapore) and in Ng Chye Huey, p. 130, para. 48. The Court noted that this jurisdiction had \\"existed historically at common law\\" and \\"is still very much a part of our judicial system\\".Ng Chye Huey, p. 134, para. 53. The inherent power of the High Court to review the decisions of inferior courts and other administrative bodies does not, however, extend to co-ordinate bodies. In other words, one High Court judge may not exercise judicial review over a decision by another High Court judge.Ramalingam Ravinthran v. Attorney-General [2011] 4 S.L.R. 196 at 200‚Äì201, paras. 6‚Äì7, H.C. (Singapore), citing . In addition, there are no provisions in the Supreme Court of Judicature Act (\\"SCJA\\"). which confer on the Court of Appeal the power to exercise supervisory jurisdiction over the High Court or ‚Äì as pointed out in Ng Chye Huey ‚Äì the Subordinate Courts.Ng Chye Huey, p. 138, para 63. The effective scope of the principles of judicial review depends on how the Court chooses to exercise its discretion in pursuance of its supervisory jurisdiction. =Remedies= The remedies available in a judicial review action are the prerogative orders ‚Äì the mandatory order (formerly known as mandamus), prohibiting order (prohibition), quashing order (certiorari), and order for review of detention (habeas corpus) ‚Äì and the declaration, a form of equitable remedy. All these remedies that the High Court may grant are discretionary. A successful claimant has no absolute right to a remedy. In deciding whether to grant a remedy, the Court will take into account factors such as the following:. *any prejudicial delay by the claimant in bringing the case; *whether the claimant has suffered substantial hardship; *any impact the remedy may have on third parties; *whether a remedy will have any practical effect, or whether the matter has become academic (in which case a remedy will usually not be granted); *the merits of the case; and *whether the remedy will promote good administration. Prerogative orders The ancient remedies of certiorari, mandamus, prohibition and habeas corpus were originally only available to the British Crown and thus termed prerogative writs, that is, writs that could be issued at the prerogative of the sovereign..See also : \\"Writs, not ministerially directed, (sometimes called prerogative writs, because they are supposed to issue on the part of the King,) such as writs of mandamus, prohibition, habeas corpus, certiorari ... upon a proper case, they may issue to every dominion of the Crown of England. There is no doubt as to the power of this Court; where the place is under the subjection of the Crown of England; the only question is, as to the propriety.\\" By the end of the 16th century, they could theoretically be sought by any aggrieved citizen. In 1938, the writs were abolished in the United Kingdom and replaced by prerogative orders with essentially the same names and functions.. As a former British colony, Singapore inherited English administrative law at independence and the Singapore courts continue to pay close attention to English cases. In Singapore, the prerogative orders were known by their traditional names until 2006, when the names were modernized.By the , ss. 2 and 6 and the 4th Sch., in force on 1 January 2006. Section 2 of the Act inserted s. 41B into the , which requires the prerogative orders to be referred to by their modern names in all written laws. Following the change, paragraph 1 of the First Schedule to the Supreme Court of Judicature Act, which is entitled \\"Prerogative orders\\", now states that the High Court possesses the following power:SCJA, s. 18(1), states: \\"The High Court shall have such powers as are vested in it by any written law for the time being in force in Singapore.\\" Section 18(2) continues: \\"Without prejudice to the generality of subsection (1), the High Court shall have the powers set out in the First Schedule.\\" The Subordinate Courts are not empowered to grant prerogative orders. (\\"SCA\\"), s. 19(3)(b): \\"[A] District Court's jurisdiction ... shall not include ‚Äî (a) any supervisory jurisdiction or revisionary jurisdiction; (b) any jurisdiction relating to the judicial review of any act done or decision made by any person or authority, including the issue of any of the following prerogative orders: (i) a Mandatory Order; (ii) a Prohibiting Order; (iii) a Quashing Order; (iv) an Order for Review of Detention ...\\".SCA, s. 52(1A)(a): \\"The jurisdiction of a Magistrate's Court ... shall not include jurisdiction to hear and try any action where ‚Äî (a) there is no claim for any sum of money ...\\".See also the Rules of Court (Cap. 322, R 5, 2006 Rev. Ed. ) (\\"ROC\\"), Order 53, rule 8, which states: \\"This Order is not applicable to the Subordinate Courts.\\" The amendment of the provision removed a specific reference to the High Court's power to issue writs of quo warranto,Prior to the amendment taking effect in 2006, para. 1 of the 1st Sch. to the SCJA stated that the High Court had \\"[p]ower to issue to any person or authority directions, orders or writs, including writs of the nature of habeas corpus, mandamus, prohibition, quo warranto and certiorari, or any others, for the enforcement of any of the rights conferred by any written law or for any purpose\\". a remedy used to challenge a person's right to hold public office. There are no reported cases of quo warranto having been issued in Singapore. Since paragraph 1 still empowers the High Court \\"to issue to any person or authority any ... order or writ for the enforcement of any right conferred by any written law or for any other purpose\\", it may be that the Court's power to issue an order equivalent to a quo warranto has not been impaired. =Mandatory orders= A mandatory order is an order of the High Court which commands a public body to perform a public duty, and is usually employed to compel public bodies to exercise the powers given to them. It may be used in combination with another remedy, most commonly a quashing order. In such a case, the quashing order will set aside the unlawful decision, and the mandatory order will require the public body to reconsider the matter.. A person who complies with a mandatory order cannot have legal proceedings taken against him or her for doing so.ROC, O. 53, r. 6(1). Since it is the responsibility of the High Court to determine the legality of a decision rather than its merits,. it will not order a public body to take a certain course of action, but will merely enjoin it to perform its duty in a lawful manner. In R. v. Justices of Kingston, ex parte Davey (1902),R. v. Justices of Kingston, ex parte Davey (1902) 86 L.T. 589 at 591, applied in Re San Development Co's Application [1971‚Äì1973] S.L.R.(R.) 203 at 207, para. 15, H.C. (Singapore); and Borissik v. Urban Redevelopment Authority at [2009] 4 S.L.R. 92 at 98, para. 21, H.C. (Singapore). it was held: In Re San Development Co's Application (1971), the applicant sought certiorari to quash the decision of a Commissioner of Appeals of an Appeals Board under the Land Acquisition Act 1966, now . refusing to allow the applicant to proceed with an appeal against an award made by the Collector of Land Revenue as the notice of appeal had been filed late, and a mandamus directing the Commissioner to hear the appeal. Relying on the above case, the High Court held that it could not grant a mandamus in such terms. Instead, it quashed the Commissioner's decision and issued a mandamus directing him to \\"consider and determine the application of the applicants according to law\\".San Development Co's Application, p. 208, para. 17. Similarly, in Borissik v. Urban Redevelopment Authority (2009), the High Court held that the applicant should not have asked for a mandatory order requiring the Urban Redevelopment Authority to unconditionally approve the redevelopment plan for her property that she sought, and for a processing fee she had paid to be refunded. The headquarters of the Law Society of Singapore along South Bridge Road, photographed in January 2012. In 1985, the High Court granted a mandamus (now known as a mandatory order) to the Society to compel a Disciplinary Committee to investigate charges of wrongdoing against an advocate and solicitor. Re Lim Chor Pee, ex parte Law Society of Singapore (1985)Re Lim Chor Pee, ex parte Law Society of Singapore [1985‚Äì1986] S.L.R.(R.) 226, H.C. (Singapore). (\\"Lim Chor Pee (H.C.)\\"). is another example of a case where a mandatory order was granted by the High Court. The appellant, Lim Chor Pee, who was an advocate and solicitor, had been convicted of several income tax offences and had been found to have tampered with a witness. On 16 July 1982, the Attorney-General wrote to the President of the Law Society of Singapore, providing information on the appellant's conviction and other records. Following a report by the Society's Inquiry Committee that a formal inquiry into the appellant's conduct was necessary, a Disciplinary Committee was appointed. The appellant successfully applied to the Disciplinary Committee to delete certain paragraphs of the statement of case which had been formulated against him by the Council of the Law Society, on the ground that the facts in those paragraphs did not appear in the Inquiry Committee's report. Consequently, three of the six charges against the appellant and a major portion of one other charge did not require investigation by the Disciplinary Committee. Dissatisfied with this decision, the Law Society applied to the High Court for an order of mandamus to direct the Disciplinary Committee to hear and investigate all the six charges against the appellant.Lim Chor Pee, pp. 228‚Äì238, paras. 4‚Äì43. The High Court granted the application, holding that under the Legal Profession Act,, now . the Inquiry Committee's only function was to consider the matters before it and decide whether or not there should be a formal investigation by a Disciplinary Committee. It was the duty of the Council of the Law Society to draw up the charges, and the duty of the Disciplinary Committee to hear and investigate the charges properly before the Committee in the statement of case. Thus, the appellant could not object that some of the charges against him were based on facts not mentioned in the Inquiry Committee's report.Lim Chor Pee, pp. 239‚Äì240, para. 46. The decision was affirmed by the Court of Appeal.Re Lim Chor Pee, ex parte Law Society of Singapore [1985‚Äì1986] S.L.R.(R.) 998, C.A. (Singapore) (\\"Lim Chor Pee (C.A.)\\"). One of the issues before the Court of Appeal in Lim Chor Pee was whether the Law Society had standing (locus standi) to apply for mandamus against the Disciplinary Committee. The Court cited R. v. Inland Revenue Commissioners, ex parte National Federation of Self Employed and Small Businesses Ltd. (1981),. in which the House of Lords noted that although the law had formerly required an applicant to show that he or she \\"has a legal specific right to ask for the interference of the Court\\"R. v. Lewisham Union Guardians [1897] 1 Q.B. 498 at 500, Divisional Court (England & Wales). to obtain a mandamus, this was no longer correct and that the courts had moved to a sufficient interest standard.R. v. Customs and Excise Commissioners, ex parte Cook [1970] 1 W.L.R. 450, High Court (Queen's Bench) (England & Wales). The Court then went on to find that the Law Society had sufficient interest to apply for mandamus as under the Legal Profession Act one of its purposes was \\"to maintain and impose the standards of conduct ... of the legal profession in Singapore\\",Legal Profession Act (Cap. 217, 1970 Rev. Ed.), s. 39(1)(a), now the Legal Profession Act (Cap. 161, 1985 Rev. Ed.), s. 38(1)(a). and the Council of the Society was empowered by the Act to formulate charges against advocates and solicitors whom the Inquiry Committee felt should be formally investigated.Lim Chor Pee (C.A.), pp. 1013‚Äì1014, paras. 43‚Äì45. =Prohibiting orders= A prohibiting order operates to prevent illegal action by a public authority from occurring in the first place. It may be granted by the High Court in cases where the applicant is aware that the authority is about to take an unlawful course of action, or to prevent the authority from repeating an unlawful act. Like a quashing order, a prohibiting order is used to help maintain good standards of public administration.Leyland & Anthony, \\"The Remedies\\", pp. 456‚Äì457. R. v. Kent Police Authority, ex parte Godden (1972)R. v. Kent Police Authority, ex parte Godden [1971] 2 Q.B. 662, Court of Appeal (England & Wales). is an instance of a United Kingdom case in which an order of prohibition was issued to avert action that would not have complied with administrative law rules. In July 1970, Godden, a police chief inspector of Kent Police Authority, was examined by the police authority's chief medical officer, who took the view that he was suffering from a mental disorder and thus unfit for duty. Godden was therefore placed on sick leave, although his own specialist found that he did not have any psychiatric illness. Subsequently, in January 1971, the police authority informed him that it would be appointing the chief medical officer to assess if he was permanently disabled, for the purpose of determining if he should be compulsorily retired.Ex parte Godden, p. 663. The Court of Appeal of England and Wales found that since the medical officer had previously formed the opinion that Godden was mentally disordered, he could not be impartial when assessing if Godden was permanently disabled. Thus, an order of prohibition should be issued to prohibit him from carrying out this assessment.Ex parte Godden, p. 670. In the Singapore case Re Fong Thin Choo (1991),Re Fong Thin Choo [1991] 1 S.L.R.(R.) 774, H.C. (Singapore). a company had removed a large quantity of cigarettes from a warehouse, ostensibly for loading on board a vessel to be exported. However, the alleged loading had not been supervised by the Customs and Excise Department. The Director-General of Customs and Excise subsequently concluded that the goods had never been exported, and requested that the company pay import duty of $130,241.30 on them. The company applied for an order of prohibition to bar the Director-General from proceeding to recover a sum of $130,241.30 by deducting it from several bankers' guarantees that had been lodged with Customs as security.Fong Thin Choo, pp. 771‚Äì780, paras. 1‚Äì12. As regards whether an order of prohibition could be obtained against the Director-General, the High Court said:Fong Thin Choo, pp. 781‚Äì782, para. 17, citing R. v. Criminal Injuries Compensation Board, ex parte Lain [1967] 2 Q.B. 864 at 882, D.C. (England & Wales). As the Director-General was a public officer appointed by statute to discharge public duties, he was subject to an order of prohibition in an appropriate case.Fong Thin Choo, p. 782, para. 18. The Court found that on the affidavit evidence produced by the applicants, the Director-General could not reasonably have come to the conclusion he came to without hearing the applicants' witnesses. He had thus misdirected himself on the law as to the nature of the evidence that was required to be produced to prove the export of the goods. Finally, there had been an insufficient inquiry which had resulted in a failure to take into account relevant considerations, and an investigation that was unfair to the applicant. The Court therefore made an order of prohibition against the Director-General to prevent him from deducting money from the bankers' guarantees.Fong Thin Choo, pp. 793‚Äì794, para. 57‚Äì58. A person seeking to obtain a prohibiting order must demonstrate that he or she has a sufficient interest to do so. In Chan Hiang Leng Colin v. Minister for Information and the Arts (1995),Chan Hiang Leng Colin v. Minister for Information and the Arts [1995] 2 S.L.R.(R.) 627, H.C. (Singapore) (\\"Chan Hiang Leng Colin (H.C.)\\"). the High Court cited the following passage from Sir William Wade's Administrative Law (4th ed., 1977):, cited in Chan Hiang Leng Colin (H.C.), p. 632, para. 11. When the case was appealed, the sufficient interest test was upheld by the Court of Appeal.Chan Hiang Leng Colin v. Minister for Information and the Arts [1996] 1 S.L.R.(R.) 294 at 299, paras. 10‚Äì12, C.A. (Singapore) (\\"Chan Hiang Leng Colin (C.A.)\\"). =Quashing orders= The effect of a quashing order is to invalidate an ultra vires decision made by a public body, usually acting under some statutory authority. It is the most commonly sought of the prerogative orders in judicial review proceedings.Leyland & Anthony, \\"The Remedies\\", p. 454. Revenue House, the headquarters of the Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore (IRAS), photographed in May 2006. In a 2010 case, the Court of Appeal held that a letter containing a determination by the Comptroller of Income Tax that a company was subject to withholding tax amounted only to advice, and so technically the Comptroller had taken no legal action that could be subject to a quashing order. Quashing orders may only be obtained against decisions which have some direct or indirect actual or ostensible legal effect, and not against mere opinions.Comptroller of Income Tax v. ACC [2010] 2 S.L.R. 1189 at 1198, para. 21, C.A. (Singapore) (\\"ACC (C.A.)\\"). In Comptroller of Income Tax v. ACC (2010), the respondent, a locally incorporated company, had arranged to enter into interest rate swap agreements with Singapore banks or Singapore branches of foreign banks on behalf of its offshore subsidiaries. The Comptroller of Income Tax took the position that payments made by the respondent to its subsidiaries pursuant to those swap agreements fell within the ambit of section 12(6) of the Income Tax Act,. such that the withholding tax requirements imposed by section 45 of the same statute applied. As the respondent had not complied with the relevant withholding tax requirements with respect to the payments in question, the respondent was required to account to the Comptroller for the amount of tax which should have been withheld. This was conveyed to the respondent in a letter.ACC (C.A.), p. 1199, para. 23. The respondent sought leave to apply to quash the determination by the Comptroller. The Court of Appeal held that the Comptroller's letter was no more than advice to the respondent, and did not amount to a legal determination that withholding tax was due from the respondent. Thus, technically speaking, there was no determination to quash and the respondent should have applied for a declaration instead. However, since the parties had accepted a ruling by the High CourtACC v. CIT [2010] 1 S.L.R. 273, H.C. (Singapore). that the Comptroller's letter did amount to a legal determination of the respondent's tax liability and the Comptroller had not questioned this aspect of the High Court's judgment, the Court of Appeal proceeded on the basis that the letter did contain a determination that was judicially reviewable.ACC (C.A.), pp. 1199‚Äì1202, paras. 25‚Äì32. It said that, \\"given the particular circumstances of this case, for the court to require the respondent to recommence proceedings for a declaratory judgment would be to take an overly legalistic view of what procedural justice requires\\".ACC (C.A.), p. 1202, para. 33. As mentioned above in relation to prohibiting orders, the test for standing to apply for a quashing order is that of sufficient interest in the matter. The High Court in Chan Hiang Leng Colin held that to have standing for certiorari, \\"[i]t was not necessary that the applicant had to have a particular grievance arising out of the order complained about. It was sufficient that there had been an abuse of power which inconvenienced someone.\\"Chan Hiang Leng Colin (H.C.), p. 633, para. 12. In support of this rule, it cited Lord Denning, the Master of the Rolls, in R. v. Greater London Council, ex parte Blackburn (1976):R. v. Greater London Council, ex parte Blackburn [1976] 1 W.L.R. 550 at 559, C.A. (England & Wales). This passage was also approved by the Court of Appeal in Chan Hiang Leng Colin.Chan Hiang Leng Colin (C.A.), p. 299, para. 10. =Orders for review of detention= An order for review of detention directs someone holding a person in detention to produce the detainee before the High Court so that the legality of the detention can be established. In Re Onkar Shrian (1969),Re Onkar Shrian [1968‚Äì1970] S.L.R.(R.) 533, H.C. (Singapore). the High Court held:Onkar Shrian, p. 538, para. 10, citing . The power of the Court to require that this be done is specifically mentioned in Article 9(2) of the Constitution of Singapore, which states: \\"Where a complaint is made to the High Court or any Judge thereof that a person is being unlawfully detained, the Court shall inquire into the complaint and, unless satisfied that the detention is lawful, shall order him to be produced before the Court and release him.\\". In Chng Suan Tze v. Minister for Home Affairs (1988),Chng Suan Tze v. Minister for Home Affairs [1988] SGCA 16, [1988] 2 S.L.R.(R.) 525, C.A. (Singapore), archived from the original on 24 December 2011. the appellants had been detained without trial under section 8(1) of the Internal Security Act (\\"ISA\\"). for alleged involvement in a Marxist conspiracy to subvert and destabilize the country. The detention orders were subsequently suspended under section 10 of the Act, but the suspensions were revoked following the release of a press statement by the appellants in which they denied being Marxist conspirators. Having applied unsuccessfully to the High Court for writs of habeas corpus to be issued, the appellants appealed against the ruling. The Court of Appeal allowed the appeal on the narrow ground that the Government had not adduced sufficient evidence to discharge its burden of proving the President was satisfied that the appellants' detention was necessary to prevent them from endangering, among other things, Singapore's security or public order, which was required by section 8(1) of the ISA before the Minister for Home Affairs could make detention orders against them.Chng Suan Tze, pp. 537‚Äì542, paras. 29‚Äì42. However, in a lengthy obiter discussion, the Court held that an objective rather than a subjective test should apply to the exercise of discretion by the authorities under sections 8 and 10 of the ISA. In other words, the executive could not insist that the exercise of the discretion was unchallengeable. The exercise of discretion could be reviewed by the court, and the executive had to satisfy the court that there were objective facts justifying its decision.Chng Suan Tze, pp. 542‚Äì554, paras. 43‚Äì86. In the course of its judgment, the Court of Appeal noted that at common law if the return to a writ of habeas corpus ‚Äì the response to the writ that a person holding a detainee had to give; . ‚Äì was valid on its face, the court could not inquire further into the matter. However, section 3 of the UK Habeas Corpus Act 1816Habeas Corpus Act (56 Geo. 3, c. 100 ). broadened the court's power by entitling it to examine the correctness of the facts mentioned in the return.Chng Suan Tze, pp. 563‚Äì564, para. 120, citing (\\"Khawaja\\") per Lord Scarman. The section stated, in part: Form 111 of the Rules of Court (Cap. 322, R 5, 2006 Rev. Ed.), the format for an order for review of detention Section 3 of the Act thus \\"contemplates the possibility of an investigation by the court so that it may satisfy itself where the truth lies\\". The extent of the investigation depends on whether a public authority's exercise of the power to detain rests on the existence or absence of certain jurisdictional or precedent facts. If so, the court must assess if the authority has correctly established the existence or otherwise of these facts. However, if the power to detain is not contingent on precedent facts, the court's task is only to determine whether there exists evidence upon which the authority could reasonably have acted. The UK Habeas Corpus Act 1816 applied to Singapore by virtue of the Second Charter of Justice 1826, which is generally accepted to have made all English statutes and principles of English common law and equity in force as at 27 November 1826 applicable in the Straits Settlements (including Singapore), unless they were unsuitable to local conditions and could not be modified to avoid causing injustice or oppression.. In 1994, after Chng Suan Sze was decided, the Application of English Law Act (\\"AELA\\"). was enacted with the effect that only English statutes specified in the First Schedule of the Act continued to apply in Singapore after 12 November 1993.AELA, s. 4(1)(a) (\\"Subject to the provisions of this section and of any other written law, the following English enactments shall, with the necessary modifications, apply or continue to apply in Singapore: ... the English enactments specified in the second and third columns of the First Schedule to the extent specified in the fourth column thereof ...\\"), and s. 5(1) (\\"Except as provided in this Act, no English enactment shall be part of the law of Singapore.\\"). See also . The Habeas Corpus Act 1816 is not one of these statutes, and so appears to have ceased to be part of Singapore law. Nonetheless, it may be argued that High Court should continue to apply a rule equivalent to section 3 of the Act to orders for review of detention because of the combined effect of Article 9(2) of the Constitution which should not be regarded as having been abridged unless the legislature has used clear and unequivocal language,Lee Mau Seng v. Minister for Home Affairs [1971] SGHC 10, [1971‚Äì1973] S.L.R.(R.) 135 at 145, para. 17, H.C. (Singapore), archived from the original on 5 January 2012. and the following principle from Eshugbayi Eleko v. Government of Nigeria (1931). stated by Lord Atkin:Eshugbayi Eleko, p. 670. See also the comment in the dissent of Lord Atkin in , \\"that in English law every imprisonment is prima facie unlawful and that it is for a person directing imprisonment to justify his act\\". Both Eshugbayi Eleko and Liversidge were cited in Khawaja, pp. 110‚Äì111. Lord Atkin's dissenting opinion was subsequently accepted as correct by the House of Lords in . Compare Rawlings, pp. 344‚Äì345. Since an order for review of detention is a remedy for establishing the legality of detention, it may not be used to challenge the conditions under which a person is held, if the detention itself is lawful.Lau Lek Eng v. Minister for Home Affairs [1971‚Äì1973] S.L.R.(R.) 346 at 348‚Äì349, para. 9, H.C. (Singapore) Moreover, an order can only be sought where a person is being physically detained, and not if he or she is merely under some other form of restriction such as being out on bail.Onkar Shrian, pp. 539‚Äì541, paras. 15‚Äì20. Both nationals and non-nationals of a jurisdiction may apply for orders for review of detention. In the UK context, Lord Scarman disagreed with the suggestion that habeas corpus protection only extends to British nationals, stating in Khera v. Secretary of State for the Home Department; Khawaja v. Secretary of State for the Home Department (\\"Khawaja\\", 1983), that \\"[e]very person within the jurisdiction enjoys the equal protection of our laws. There is no distinction between British nationals and others. He who is subject to English law is entitled to its protection.\\"Khawaja, p. 111. =Procedure for prerogative orders= According to the Government Proceedings Act, (\\"GPA\\"). civil proceedings against the Government must be commenced against an appropriate authorized Government department. If there is no appropriate authorized Government department, or the person wishing to commence proceedings has reasonable doubt as to which department (if any) is appropriate, proceedings should be commenced against the Attorney-General.GPA, s. 19(3). This rule applies to judicial review proceedings in which prerogative orders or declarations are sought. The minister charged with responsibility for the ActProbably the Minister for Law: see the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore (Responsibility of the Minister for Law) Notification 2011 (S 308/2011 ). is required to publish in the Government Gazette a list stating the Government departments which are authorized departments for the purposes of the Act, and the names and addresses for service of the solicitors for the departments.GPA, s. 19(1). As of 7 December 2005, no such list had been published. For this reason, in Chee Siok Chin v. Minister for Home Affairs (2005),. decided on that date, the High Court held that instead of instituting the action against the Minister for Home Affairs and the Commissioner of Police, the applicants should have done so against the Attorney-General. Nonetheless, the suit should not be dismissed as this was a procedural irregularity that could be cured by substituting the Attorney- General as the respondent.Chee Siok Chin, pp. 595‚Äì596, paras. 23‚Äì27. Mandatory, prohibiting and quashing orders If a mandatory order, prohibiting order or quashing order is sought, the applicant must follow the procedure set out in Order 53 of the Rules of Court. In general, there are two stages. At the first stage, an applicant must obtain leave to apply for the prerogative order. This requirement prevents unmeritorious applications from being taken against decision-makers by filtering out groundless cases at an early stage to prevent wastage of judicial time, and protects public bodies from harassment, intentional or otherwise.Public Service Commission v. Lai Swee Lin Linda [2001] 1 S.L.R.(R.) 133 at 142, para. 23, C.A. (Singapore) (\\"Lai Swee Lin Linda (C.A.)\\"), citing Ex parte National Federation of Self- Employed and Small Businesses Ltd., pp. 642‚Äì643. An application for such leave must be made by ex parte originating summonsThat is, a document that, in the first instance, is filed in court without notifying other interested parties. and must be supported by a statement setting out the name and description of the applicant, the relief sought and the grounds on which it is sought; and by an affidavit, to be filed when the application is made, verifying the facts relied on.ROC, O. 53, r. 1(2). In granting leave, the judge hearing the application for leave may impose such terms as to costs and as to security as he or she thinks fit.ROC, O. 53, r. 1(4). In addition, there is a time requirement which stipulates that leave shall not be granted to apply for a quashing order to remove any judgment, order, conviction or other proceeding for the purpose of its being quashed, unless the application for leave is made within three months after the date of the proceeding or such other period (if any) as may be prescribed by any written law. However, the High Court may allow an application for leave to be filed out of time if the delay \\"is accounted for to the satisfaction of the Judge\\",ROC, O. 53, r. 1(6). as was the case in Chai Chwan v. Singapore Medical Council (2009).. No such time limit requirements exist for mandatory or prohibiting orders, but such orders should be applied for without undue delay.UDL Marine (Singapore) Pte. Ltd. v. Jurong Town Corporation [2011] 3 S.L.R. 94 at 106‚Äì107, paras. 35‚Äì37, H.C. (Singapore). The test for whether leave should be granted to an applicant was expressed by the High Court in Lai Swee Lin Linda v. Public Service Commission (2000),Lai Swee Lin Linda v. Public Service Commission [2000] SGHC 162, H.C. (Singapore) (\\"Lai Swee Lin Linda (H.C.)\\"). and approved by the Court of Appeal, in the following terms:Lai Swee Lin Linda (C.A.), p. 141, para. 20, citing Lai Swee Lin Linda (H.C.), para. 44. See also . Once leave is granted, an applicant moves on to the second stage and applies for a prerogative order by filing in the High Court a document called a summons within the legal proceedings already started earlier. This must be done between eight and 14 days after leave to do so is granted by the Court; beyond that, the leave lapses.ROC, O. 53, rr. 2(1) and (2). The applicant must serve the ex parte originating summons, the statement, the supporting affidavit, the order granting leave, and the summons by which the prerogative order is actually applied for, on all persons directly affected. Where the application relates to court proceedings and is intended to compel the court or a court official to do an act relating to the proceedings, or to quash the proceedings or any order made in them, the documents must be served on the registrar of the court and the other parties to the proceedings. The documents must also be served on the judge if his or her conduct is being objected to.ROC, O. 53, r.2(3). If the Court is of opinion that any person who ought to have been served with the documents has not been served, the Court may adjourn the hearing on such terms as it may direct in order that the documents may be served on that person.ROC, O. 53, r. 2(5). The High Court has dispensed with the two-stage process and dealt with applications on the merits at the first stage in cases that involved only pure questions of law and where there were no factual disputes.Pang Cheng Suan v. Commissioner for Labour [2008] 3 S.L.R.(R.) 648 at 673, para. 56, C.A. (Singapore), applied in Chai Chwan, paras. 27‚Äì32, and Yong Vui Kong v. Attorney-General [2011] 1 S.L.R. 1 at 11‚Äì12, paras. 14‚Äì19, H.C. (Singapore). Contrast UDL Marine, pp. 104‚Äì105, paras. 29‚Äì31, which distinguished Pang Cheng Suan because there were factual disputes present. Orders for review of detention The procedure for applying for an order for review of detention differs from that for obtaining a mandatory order, prohibiting order or quashing order because the latter orders are only available by leave of court, whereas an order for review of detention may be applied for without prior permission from the court. The procedure for doing so is set out in Order 54 of the Rules of Court. An application must be made to the High CourtThe Order does not apply to the Subordinate Courts: ROC, O. 54, r. 9. by way of an ex parte originating summons, supported, if possible, by an affidavit from the person being restrained which shows that the application is being made at his or her instance and explaining the nature of the restraint. If the person under restraint is unable to personally make an affidavit, someone may do so on his or her behalf, explaining the reason for the inability.ROC, O. 54, rr. 1(2) and (3). Upon the filing of the application, the Court may either make an order immediately, or direct that a summons for the order for review of detention be issued to enable all the parties involved to present arguments to the Court.Singapore Court Practice 2005, p. 1144, para. 54/1-9/2. If the latter course is taken, the ex parte originating summons, supporting affidavit, order of court and summons must be served on the person against whom the order is sought.ROC, O. 54, r. 2. Unless the Court directs otherwise, it is not necessary for the person under restraint to be brought before the Court for the hearing of the application. In addition, the Court may order that the person be released while the application is being heard.ROC, O. 54, r. 4. Once the Court decides to make an order for review of detention, it will direct when the person under restraint is to be brought before the court.ROC, O. 54, r. 5. The applicant has the initial burden of showing that he or she has a prima facie case that should be considered by the Court. Once this has been done, it is for the executive to justify the legality of the detention.Khawaja, pp. 111‚Äì112. One commentator has said that the applicant's task is to discharge his or her evidential burden, following which the public authority detaining the applicant has a legal burden of showing that the detention is lawful.Rawlings, p. 343. The standard of proof required to be achieved by the authority is the civil standard of a balance of probabilities, but \\"flexibly applied\\" in the sense that the degree of probability must be appropriate to what is at stake.Khawaja, pp. 113‚Äì114, citing . Thus, in Khawaja Lord Bridge of Harwich said that given the seriousness of the allegations against a detainee and the consequences of the detention, \\"the court should not be satisfied with anything less than probability of a high degree\\".Khawaja, p. 124. See also p. 128 per Lord Templeman. Declarations In addition to prerogative orders, the equitable remedy of a declaration can be employed to control an excess of legal authority. A declaration is a pronouncement by a court stating the legal position between the parties to an action, based on the facts that have been presented to the court.Leyland & Anthony, p. 461. In contrast to the prerogative orders which are termed public law remedies, the declaration is called a private law remedy as it was originally developed in court cases between private parties.Leyland & Anthony, p. 458. Only the High Court may grant declarations in judicial review cases;SCJA, s. 18(2) read with para. 1 of the 1st Sch.: see Chan Hiang Leng Colin (C.A.), p. 298, para. 4: \\"These provisions give the High Court powers to make 'any other orders', including a declaration\\". See also the SCJA, 1st Sch., para. 14, which states that the High Court has \\"[p]ower to grant all reliefs and remedies at law and in equity ...\\": Salijah bte Ab Latef v. Mohd Irwan bin Abdullah Teo [1996] 2 S.L.R.(R.) 80 at 92, para. 52, C.A. (Singapore). although the Subordinate Courts are generally empowered by the Subordinate Courts Act to grant declarations, a District Court exercises no judicial review jurisdiction over acts or decisions of persons or authorities, and a Magistrate's Court cannot deal with any action in which there is no claim for any sum of money. Havil Hall in Southwark, London, now occupied by Theatre Peckham. In a 1983 case, the Queen's Bench Division of the High Court held that the refusal of Southwark London Borough Council to permit a National Front by-election candidate to use the hall, while contrary to a declaration that the candidate had a legal right to do so, did not amount to a contempt of court. A declaration is only as effective as the willingness of a public body to abide by the court's statement of the law in it, as it is not a contempt of court to ignore a declaration.\\"A declaration pronounces upon the existence or non-existence of a legal state of affairs. It does not have any coercive force as it does not contain any order which can be enforced against the defendant.\\": Bocotra Construction Pte. Ltd. v. Attorney-General [1995] 2 S.L.R.(R.) 282 at 294, para. 28, C.A. (Singapore). In Webster v. Southwark London Borough Council (1982),Webster v. Southwark London Borough Council [1983] Q.B. 698, H.C. (Q.B.) (England & Wales). Webster was a parliamentary candidate for the National Front, a far right racial nationalist political party, who wanted to hold an election meeting in a hall owned by Southwark London Borough Council. Despite being required by provisions of the Representation of the People Act 1949Representation of the People Act 1949 (12, 13 & 14 Geo. 6, c. 68) (UK). to permit Webster to use the hall, the local council refused to do so as it did not agree with Webster's political views. The court made a declaration that Webster was legally entitled to use the hall at a certain time for the purpose of his election campaign, on the assumption that the local council would obey it. Nonetheless, the local council still refused to allow Webster use of the hall. It was held that a declaration is not a coercive order of the court and, accordingly, refusal to comply with it is not contempt.Webster, pp. 706 and 708. There is some authority to the effect that a court will not generally grant a declaration if it considers the issue at hand to be an academic question or one that is entirely hypothetical. For instance, in Vince v. Chief Constable of Dorset Police (1992),. proceedings against the Chief Constable of Dorset Police were brought by the plaintiffs on behalf of members of the Police Federation of England and Wales to, among other things, enable chief constables throughout the country to know where they stood on a question of law with respect to the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984,Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 (1984, c. 60 ) (UK). namely, whether it was unlawful to appoint an acting sergeant as a custody officer under section 36(3) of the Act. Affirming the decision of the judge below, a majority of the Court of Appeal declined to make a declaration on the matter. It took the view that since there was no evidence that any chief constable had ever appointed an acting sergeant as a custody officer, the issue was academic or hypothetical.Vince, p. 426. However, at least in the UK, there are signs that the courts may be moving towards showing more flexibility in granting advisory declarations. In R. v. Secretary of State for the Home Department, ex parte Salem (1999),. Salem, a citizen of Libya, was granted temporary admission to the UK to pursue an asylum claim. One month later, the Home Office recorded in an internal file that Salem's asylum claim had been refused, but did not communicate the decision to him. Salem only found out when his income support ceased, and the Benefits Agency told him that they had been informed that he had been refused asylum. Subsequently, Salem unsuccessfully sought leave to apply for judicial review of the Home Secretary's decision to notify the Department of Social Security that his asylum claim had been rejected. He then obtained leave to appeal the matter to the House of Lords, but was then granted refugee status. Before the House of Lords, Salem argued that his appeal should still be heard as the question of law in his case was one of general public importance. The court held that it had discretion to hear an appeal which concerns an issue involving a public authority as to a question of public law, even where there is no longer any live issue which would affect the rights and duties of the parties themselves. However, the court cautioned that this discretion has to be exercised with circumspection and entertained only where there was a good public interest reason to do so.Ex parte Salem, pp. 456‚Äì458. It is not yet known whether the Singapore High Court will adopt a similar approach. The Singapore courts have also yet to directly address the issue of the standing required to apply for a declaration in an administrative law case. In Karaha Bodas Co. LLC v. Pertamina Energy Trading Ltd. (2005)Karaha Bodas Co. LLC v. Pertamina Energy Trading Ltd. [2006] 1 S.L.R.(R.) 112, C.A. (Singapore). ‚Äì not a judicial review case ‚Äì the Court of Appeal expressed the view that the applicant \\"must be asserting the recognition of a 'right' that is personal to him\\".Karaha Bodas, p. 120, para. 15. See also Salijah, p. 93, paras. 57‚Äì58, British and Malayan Trustees Ltd. v. Sindo Realty Pte. Ltd. [1998] 1 S.L.R.(R.) 903 at 915, para. 31, H.C. (Singapore), and Singapore Airlines Ltd v. Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore [1999] 2 S.L.R.(R.) 1097 at 1101‚Äì1103, paras. 23‚Äì27, H.C. (Singapore). It cited the House of Lords' decision of Gouriet v. Union of Post Office Workers (1977),. which held that a plaintiff could not be granted a declaration unless he or she:Gouriet, p. 483, cited in Karaha Bodas, p. 120, para. 15. The Court preferred the position taken in Gouriet rather than the more flexible approach taken in Re S (Hospital Patient: Court's Jurisdiction) (1995)Re S (Hospital Patient: Court's Jurisdiction) [1996] Fam. 1, C.A. (England & Wales). where, so long as there existed a \\"real and present dispute between the parties as to the existence or extent of a legal right\\" and each of the parties to the litigation \\"would be affected by the determination of the issue\\", it was not necessary for the legal right to be vested in the parties.Re S, p. 22, cited in Karaha Bodas, pp. 124‚Äì125, para. 22. One of the reasons it came to this conclusion was that Re S is regarded by some scholars, cited in Karaha Bodas, p. 125, para. 24. as more consistent with rule 40.20 of the Civil Procedure Rules,Civil Procedure Rules 1998 (S.I. 1998 No. 3132 (L. 17) ), as amended by the Civil Procedure (Amendment) Rules 2001 (S.I. 2001 No. 256 (L. 7) ), r. 13. which states: \\"The court may make binding declarations whether or not any other remedy is claimed.\\" On the other hand, the relevant Singaporean provision is Order 15, rule 16, of the Rules of Court, which reads: \\"No action or other proceedings shall be open to objection on the ground that a merely declaratory judgment or order is sought thereby, and the Court may make binding declarations of right whether or not any consequential relief is or could be claimed.\\" [Emphasis added.]Karaha Bodas, pp. 125‚Äì126, paras. 24‚Äì25. Hence, the Court concluded that its jurisdiction to make declarations is \\"confined to declaring contested legal rights of the parties represented in the litigation\\".Karaha Bodas, p. 123, para. 19. In Tan Eng Hong v. Attorney-General (2011),Tan Eng Hong v. Attorney-General [2011] 3 S.L.R. 320, H.C. (Singapore). the applicant sought a declaration that section 377A of the Penal Code. was unconstitutional. The High Court stated that a person who is asserting an infringement of a constitutional liberty must establish that he or she has not merely a sufficient interest but a substantial interest in the matter, that is, he or she must be alleging a violation of a fundamental liberty.Tan Eng Hong, pp. 325‚Äì327, paras. 8‚Äì13. The Court did not discuss the issue of standing in the context of administrative law. =Procedure for declarations= Before May 2011, it was not possible to apply for prerogative orders and declarations in the same set of legal proceedings. In Chan Hiang Leng Colin, the appellants contended that a declaration might be obtained in proceedings taken under Order 53 of the Rules of Court. The Court of Appeal, following Re Application by Dow Jones (Asia) Inc. (1987),Re Application by Dow Jones (Asia) Inc. [1987] S.L.R.(R.) 627 at 632, para. 14, H.C. (Singapore). held that it had no power to grant a declaration under Order 53 because a declaration is not a form of prerogative order. If a declaration was sought, it had to be applied for by way of writ if there were substantial factual disputes between the parties,ROC, O. 5, r. 2. or, if not, by originating summons.ROC, O. 5, rr. 3 and 4(2).Chan Hiang Leng Colin (C.A.), p. 298, paras. 5‚Äì6. See also .Yip Kok Seng v. Traditional Chinese Medicine Practitioners Board [2010] 4 S.L.R. 990 at 995, para. 16, H.C. (Singapore). In Yip Kok Seng v. Traditional Chinese Medicine Practitioners Board (2010), the High Court expressed the view that due to the lack of a unified regime in Singapore for applying for prerogative orders and declarations, it was not an abuse of process for an applicant to seek redress for a public law right by way of a declaration instead of applying for a prerogative order.Yip Kok Seng, pp. 995‚Äì996 and 998, paras. 20 and 25, distinguishing . With effect from 1 May 2011, it became possible to include an application for a declaration together with an application for one or more prerogative orders. However, the application for a declaration cannot be made unless the court grants leave for the prerogative orders to be applied for.ROC, O. 53, rr. 1(1)(a) and (b), inserted by the Rules of Court (Amendment No. 2) Rules 2011 (S 218/2011 ). See . Remedies that are unavailable =Injunctions= An injunction is an equitable private law remedy that restrains a public body from doing an act that is wrongful or ultra vires. Following law reforms in the United Kingdom in 1977,Supreme Court Act 1981 (now the Senior Courts Act 1981, 1981 c. 54 ), s. 31 , supplemented by the Civil Procedure (Amendment No. 4) Rules 2000 (2000 No. 2092 (L. 16) ), Pt. 54 . it became possible for the High Court of England and Wales to grant prerogative orders as well as a declaration or injunction in the same set of legal proceedings.Leyland & Anthony, pp. 220‚Äì221. As these reforms have not been followed in Singapore,Yip Kok Seng, p. 995, paras. 17‚Äì19. the Singapore High Court is not empowered to grant injunctions under Order 53 of the Rules of Court. In addition, if civil proceedings are taken against the Government, section 27 of the Government Proceedings Act bars the High Court from granting injunctions against it. In place of an injunction, the Court may make a declaration concerning the parties' rights.GPA, s. 27(1)(a). The Court also may not make an injunction against a government officer if the effect of doing so would be to provide relief that could not be obtained against the Government directly.GPA, s. 27(2). Section 2(2) of the Act makes it clear that the term civil proceedings includes proceedings for judicial review.The reference to judicial review proceedings in the definition of civil proceedings was added to the GPA, s. 2(2), by the , s. 6 and para. 8 of the 1st Sch. The change was not specifically explained in Parliament during the passage of the bill (), but may have been prompted by Fong Thin Choo (1991) in which the High Court held that an order of prohibition could be issued against the Government since civil proceedings in s. 27 of the Act did not include judicial review proceedings (Fong Thin Choo, p. 781, paras. 15‚Äì16). Note also the ROC, O. 53, r. 7(1), which expressly makes the Court's power to grant relief to an applicant in addition to a prerogative order or a declaration subject to the GPA. =Damages= At common law, there is no general right to claim damages ‚Äì that is, monetary compensation ‚Äì if rules of public law have been breached by a public authority. In order to obtain damages, an aggrieved person must be able to establish a private law claim in contract or tort law.Leyland & Anthony, pp. 464‚Äì465. While such a person would previously have had to take out a legal action for damages separately from any judicial review proceedings, since May 2011 it has been possible for a person who has successfully obtained prerogative orders or a declaration to ask the High Court to also award him or her \\"relevant relief\\",ROC, O. 53, r. 7(1). that is, a liquidated sum, damages, equitable relief or restitution.ROC, O. 53, r. 7(4). The Court may give directions to the parties relating to the conduct of the proceedings or otherwise to determine whether the applicant is entitled to the relevant relief sought, and must allow any party opposing the granting of such relief an opportunity to be heard.ROC, O. 53, rr. 7(2) and (3). A special tort that applies only against public authorities is the tort of misfeasance in public office. To successfully make out the tort, a claimant must establish the following elements:Lines International Holding (S) Pte. Ltd. v. Singapore Tourist Promotion Board [1997] 1 S.L.R.(R.) 52 at 97, para. 138, H.C. (Singapore), citing . *the public authority acted maliciously, or while knowing that it had no power to act; *it is foreseeable that the claimant would be harmed in some way by the act; and *the claimant suffered damage as a result of the act. In Lines International Holding (S) Pte. Ltd. v. Singapore Tourist Promotion Board (1997), the plaintiff, a cruise operator, claimed that the Singapore Tourism Promotion Board and the Port of Singapore Authority had committed the tort by denying it berths for its ship conducting \\"cruises to nowhere\\" on which the main activity was gambling. The High Court found that the plaintiff had failed to establish this claim. Since the authorities had not acted ultra vires, they could not have acted while knowing they lacked the power to do so. Moreover, the plaintiff had not adduced any evidence of the financial damage it had incurred due to the denial of berths.Lines International, pp. 97‚Äì98, paras. 139‚Äì142. It has been said that \\"the tort is of quite limited value and importance as a means of controlling the ordinary run of inadvertent government illegality\\".. If a claimant establishes that a public authority's wrongful action amounts to a tort, he or she may be able to obtain exemplary damages if it can be shown that the authority has been guilty of \\"oppressive, arbitrary or unconstitutional action\\" in the exercise of a public function., applied in .

Public Prosecutor was a seminal case decided in 2010 by the Court of Appeal of Singapore which, in response to a challenge by Yong Vui Kong, a convicted drug smuggler, held that the mandatory death penalty imposed by the (\\"MDA\\") for certain drug trafficking offences does not infringe Articles 9(1) and 12(1) of the Constitution of Singapore. Article 9(1) states: \\"No person shall be deprived of his life or personal liberty save in accordance with law.\\" The Court of Appeal held that the term law does not exclude laws sanctioning inhuman punishment. This does not mean that all laws are justified whatever their nature. Laws which violate fundamental rules of natural justice, or those that are absurd or arbitrary cannot be considered law. Nonetheless, the threshold of culpability in imposing the mandatory death penalty for drug-related offences is a matter of policy and is therefore a matter for legislation and not for the courts to decide. The Court distinguished a line of Privy Council cases finding the mandatory death penalty to be unconstitutional, because the constitutions of the jurisdictions from which the appeals originated contained an explicit prohibition against inhuman punishment, which Singapore's Constitution lacks. In addition, though the Constitution of India also does not expressly prohibit inhuman punishment, the Court declined to follow a decision of the Supreme Court of India invalidating the mandatory death penalty for inconsistency with Article 21 of the Indian Constitution, which is similar to Singapore's Article 9(1). Among other things, it took the view that the test for constitutional validity under Article 9(1) is different from the test applied to India's Article 21. Finally, the Court was of the opinion that rules of customary international law cannot be incorporated into the meaning of the word law in Article 9(1) as this is not in accordance with the normal hierarchy of Singapore law, which envisages that customary international law may only be adopted into the common law if it is not inconsistent with existing domestic laws. In any case, there is insufficient state practice to demonstrate that customary international law regards the mandatory death penalty as an inhuman punishment. The Court of Appeal also held that the mandatory death penalty does not violate Article 12(1) of the Constitution, which states: \\"All persons are equal before the law and entitled to the equal protection of the law.\\" In its opinion, the differentia used in the MDA to determine whether the death penalty should be imposed for trafficking in diamorphine (heroin) cannot be said to be purely arbitrary, and bears a rational relation to the social object of the Act which is to prevent the growth of drug addiction in Singapore by stamping out the illicit drug trade. Following this case, the appellant Yong Vui Kong unsuccessfully challenged the process by which the President grants clemency to convicted persons on the advice of the Cabinet. Trial and subsequent events An immigration card issued by the Immigration and Checkpoints Authority reminding travellers to Singapore that the death penalty is imposed for drug trafficking The appellant, Yong Vui Kong, was a 19-year-old Malaysian national who was arrested in Singapore on 13 June 2007 and charged with trafficking in of diamorphine (heroin), a Class A controlled drug under the Misuse of Drugs Act (\\"MDA\\"). (\\"MDA\\"). (\\"P.P. v. Yong Vui Kong (2009, H.C.)\\"). Yong told investigators that he had not been aware of the contents of the packages which he was asked to handle, maintaining instead that he had been delivering packages for his boss, a man known as \\"Ah Hiang\\", for whom he was working as a debt-collector. Ah Hiang had instructed him not to open the packages, and Yong had acted according to these instructions even though he was suspicious of the contents.P.P. v. Yong Vui Kong (2009, H.C.), para. 3. Following a trial in the High Court, Yong was found guilty of drug trafficking contrary to section 5(1)(a) of the MDA. Trafficking in more than of diamorphine attracts a mandatory death penalty. The Court was of the view that Yong must have known that he had been carrying drugs.P.P. v. Yong Vui Kong (2009, H.C.), paras. 4‚Äì5. Yong instructed his counsel to file an appeal, but later asked that the appeal be withdrawn. His case was eventually taken over by another lawyer, M. Ravi, who had been instructed by Yong's brother. In the meantime, Yong had also petitioned the President of Singapore for clemency. This was rejected on 20 November 2009 and Yong's execution was set for 4 December 2009. Ravi then filed an urgent motion to challenge the constitutionality of the mandatory death penalty prescribed by the MDA. The motion was heard by Justice Woo Bih Li, who granted a stay of execution pending a decision by the Court of Appeal of Singapore..Yong Vui Kong v. Public Prosecutor [2010] 2 S.L.R. [Singapore Law Reports] 192 at 195‚Äì196, paras. 3‚Äì5, Court of Appeal (Singapore). In the hearing before the Court of Appeal, Yong was allowed to pursue his appeal. The Court was of the opinion that the initial withdrawal of the appeal was a nullity as Yong had failed to appreciate the fact that he could have proceeded with his appeal on points of law, namely, challenging the compatibility of the mandatory death penalty with Articles 9(1) and 12(1) of the Constitution of Singapore..Yong Vui Kong v. P.P. (2010, C.A.), pp. 202‚Äì204, paras. 25‚Äì28. Legal issues In the present case before the Court of Appeal, Yong challenged the constitutionality of the mandatory death penalty imposed by the MDA on the grounds that it violated Article 9(1) and/or Article 12(1) of the Constitution. =Article 9(1) challenge= Article 9(1) in the 1999 Reprint of the Constitution of Singapore Article 9(1) of the Constitution reads: \\"No person shall be deprived of his life or personal liberty save in accordance with law.\\" The word law is defined in Article 2(1), which states that \\"'law' includes ... the common law in so far as it is in operation in Singapore\\". The Court of Appeal noted that if the appellant's challenge on the basis of Article 9(1) was successful, it would mean that mandatory death penalty provisions in statutes other than the MDA would also be unconstitutional, such as the penalties of the following offences: (Yong Vui Kong (substantive appeal)\\"). *Murder, in section 302 of the Penal Code.. *Using or attempting to use arms, in section 4 of the Arms Offences Act.. *Using or attempting to use arms to commit or attempt to commit specified offences, in section 4A of the Arms Offences Act. *Having or carrying, without lawful excuse and without lawful authority, any firearm, ammunition or explosive in a security area, in section 58(1) of the Internal Security Act.. Mandatory death penalty constitutes inhuman punishment Yong's first argument was that the word law in Article 9(1) did not include laws that imposed inhuman punishments. Since the mandatory death penalty was inhuman, the provisions in the MDA that imposed a mandatory death sentence ran afoul of the Constitution. The argument hinged on the fact that the mandatory death penalty has long been held to be an inhuman punishment in a string of cases from Belize,. Saint Christopher and Nevis,. Saint Lucia,. Barbados,. Jamaica,. Trinidad and Tobago,. the Bahamas,. Grenada,. the United States,Woodson v. North Carolina , Supreme Court (United States). Uganda,Attorney General v. Kigula, Constitutional Appeal No. 3 of 2006 (21 January 2009). Malawi,Kafantayeni v. Attorney General [2007] MWHC 1, Constitutional Case No. 12 of 2005 (27 April 2007), H.C. (Malawi). and India.Mithu v. State of Punjab A.I.R. 1983 S.C. 473, Supreme Court (India). The Court of Appeal indicated that many of the cases had been distinguished in its earlier decision Nguyen Tuong Van v. Public Prosecutor (2005),Nguyen Tuong Van v. Public Prosecutor [2004] SGCA 47, [2005] 1 S.L.R.(R.) [Singapore Law Reports (Reissue)] 103, C.A. (Singapore), archived from the original on 15 November 2010. and that this was merely \\"traversing old ground\\".Yong Vui Kong (substantive appeal), p. 508, para. 34. However, the Court did highlight three cases. The first was the Privy Council case Reyes v. R. (2002), an appeal from Belize. Reyes had shot and killed his neighbour and his neighbour's wife, and had been convicted of two counts of murder. Murder by shooting was a \\"Class A\\" murder offence which attracted the mandatory death penalty. The Privy Council held that the mandatory death penalty imposed in this case contravened section 7 of the Constitution of Belize as it was inhuman or degrading punishment. This was because even within the category of \\"Class A\\" murders, there were some offenders who were not as morally culpable as the others, since the offence could have occurred in the heat of the moment. To deny the offender a chance to show the court that it would be disproportionate and inappropriate to impose the death penalty on him would thus be to deny his basic humanity.Yong Vui Kong (substantive appeal), p. 514, paras. 48‚Äì49. The second case was the United States Supreme Court decision Woodson v. North Carolina (1976). The Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution prohibits cruel and unusual punishment, and the Court proceeded on this basis to strike down mandatory death penalty legislation on a 5:4 majority. The reasons given were that the mandatory death penalty imposed a process which did not take into account relevant differences between the offenders and the offence, and excluded from judicial consideration any mitigating factors. The penalty was inhuman as it treated persons convicted of a designated offence \\"not as uniquely individual human beings, but as members of a faceless, undifferentiated mass to be subjected to the blind infliction of the penalty of death\\".Woodson, p. 304. The third case was the Indian Supreme Court judgment Mithu v. State of Punjab (1983). In that case, the appellant, who was under a sentence of life imprisonment, committed murder which attracted the mandatory death penalty under section 303 of the Indian Penal Code 1860.Indian Penal Code 1860 (No. 45 of 1860 ). Similar arguments to those in Woodson were canvassed, namely, that this provision of law deprived the Court of the chance to use its discretion and wisdom and ignored all factors pertaining to the gravity of the offence.Yong Vui Kong (substantive appeal), p. 510, para. 39. In response to the first challenge to Article 9(1), the Attorney-General Walter Woon submitted that the courts should hold to the established principles in both Ong Ah Chuan v. Public Prosecutor (1980)Ong Ah Chuan v. Public Prosecutor [1980] UKPC 32, [1981] A.C. 648, [1979‚Äì1980] S.L.R.(R.) 710, Privy Council (on appeal from Singapore). as well as Nguyen Tuong Van. His contention was premised on the argument that the Privy Council's decisions in the cases following Ong Ah Chuan and Nguyen Tuong Van did not necessarily have to be followed as the Privy Council \\"does not dictate human rights standards for the rest of humanity\\".Yong Vui Kong (substantive appeal), pp. 511‚Äì512, para. 42. Mandatory death penalty contrary to customary international law Yong's second argument was that the word law in Article 9(1) should also be taken to include customary international law. He argued that since customary international law prohibited mandatory death penalty sentences as inhuman, the MDA provisions also violated Article 9(1). Yong's argument was based on the fact that there are a diminishing number of states which still retain the mandatory death penalty for drug-related offences.Yong Vui Kong (substantive appeal), p. 512, para. 43. The Attorney-General submitted that there are two possible ways in which to interpret the word law. First, it could be taken to refer only to statutes and the common law applicable in Singapore. Secondly, it could be interpreted to include rules of customary international law. When queried by the Court of Appeal as to his preferred interpretation, he responded that, in principle, the word law should be taken to include customary international law, but only rules which had already been recognized and applied by the domestic courts of Singapore.Yong Vui Kong (substantive appeal), pp. 512‚Äì513, para. 44. Furthermore, the Attorney-General disagreed with the contention that the mandatory death penalty violates any customary international law prohibition against inhuman punishment. He submitted that the decisions after Ong Ah Chuan and Nguyen Tuong Van were reflective of the Privy Council's changing attitude toward the mandatory death penalty specifically, but did not reflect any international consensus that the mandatory death penalty is prohibited by the rules of customary international law. This was evident from the fact that there are still 31 states worldwide which continue to impose the mandatory death penalty for drug-related offences as well as other serious crimes. Thus, the international consensus needed to establish the principle contended for by the appellant was lacking.Yong Vui Kong (substantive appeal), p. 513, para. 45. =Article 12(1) challenge= Article 12(1) in the 1999 Reprint of the Constitution Article 12(1) of the Constitution reads: \\"All persons are equal before the law and entitled to the equal protection of the law.\\" In Ong Ah Chuan, the Privy Council interpreted Article 12(1) as prohibiting laws requiring differentiation in the punishment of individuals in the same class, but allowing differentiation in punitive treatment between different classes of individuals where there was a difference in the circumstances of the offences committed. This dissimilarity in circumstances would justify discriminatory punitive treatment as long as it was not purely arbitrary and bore a reasonable relation to the social object of the law. Yong argued that the MDA made the quantity of 15 grams of diamorphine the only determinant of whether the mandatory death penalty should be imposed, and that this was highly arbitrary as baseless distinctions had to be drawn between offenders who trafficked in different amounts of controlled drugs. Six points were raised to support this contention:Yong Vui Kong (substantive appeal), pp. 535‚Äì536, paras. 103‚Äì108. #Even if there was a quantitative and incremental increase in guilt or mischief associated with trafficking in just over 15 grams of diamorphine as opposed to just under 15 grams, it would be inappropriate to respond to this with a qualitative and non-incremental increase in the prescribed penalty. #The 15-gram differentia meant the MDA might be harsher on a one-time offender trafficking in slightly more than 15 grams of diamorphine, as opposed to a repeat offender who trafficked in slightly less than 15 grams of diamorphine each time. #At the sentencing stage, the mandatory death penalty precluded the court from considering the circumstances in which the offence was committed. This denied the Prosecution and the public of information on the type of offenders likely to reoffend, and impeded the legislature from determining if the mandatory death penalty was actually necessary. #Sentencing under the MDA was too rigid as it prevented the court from considering major factual differences between cases. #Despite sentencing under the MDA being based on general deterrence, the court was disallowed from considering if the offender had voluntarily assumed the risk of trafficking in controlled drugs. It was unlikely that an offender would know if the substance he was trafficking contained the amount of diamorphine sufficient to fulfil the 15-gram differentia. #The 15-gram differentia failed to differentiate between an offender trafficking in slightly more than 15 grams of diamorphine as opposed to one who trafficked in multiple times that quantity. In response, the Attorney-General cited the two- step \\"reasonable classification\\" test applicable to Article 12(1) that had been outlined in Nguyen Tuong Van ‚Äì that a differentiating measure in a statute is valid if:Yong Vui Kong (substantive appeal), p. 536, para 109. *the classification is founded on an intelligible differentia; and *the differentia bears a rational relation to the object sought to be achieved by the law in question. The Attorney-General submitted that the 15-gram differentia was intelligible and bore a rational relation to the social purpose of the MDA: to have a deterrent effect on drug trafficking in or through Singapore by large- scale drug traffickers. Decision =Article 9(1) challenge= Inhuman punishment argument The Court of Appeal noted that the definition of the word law in Article 2(1) of the Constitution includes \\"written law\\", which means that the MDA is law within the meaning of Article 9(1).Yong Vui Kong (substantive appeal), pp. 499, para. 12; and p. 513, para. 47. However, this does not mean that all laws are justified whatever their nature. Laws which violate fundamental rules of natural justice, or those that are absurd or arbitrary cannot be considered law. The Court also held that all the cases which the appellant relied on concerned the offence of murder instead of drug- related offences. This being the case, \\"the rationale underlying those cases has no direct application to the present appeal\\".Yong Vui Kong (substantive appeal), p. 514, para. 48. It relied on the judgment of Lord Diplock in Ong Ah Chuan which stated that while it was possible for the offence of murder to be committed in the heat of the moment, it was \\"more theoretical than real in the case of large scale trafficking in drugs, a crime [for] which the motive is cold calculated greed\\".Ong Ah Chuan, [1981] A.C. at p. 674, cited in Yong Vui Kong (substantive appeal), p. 514, para. 48. The Court was of the opinion that the threshold of culpability in imposing the mandatory death penalty for drug- related offences was a matter of policy and was therefore a matter for legislation and not for the courts to decide.Yong Vui Kong (substantive appeal), p. 514, para. 49. Also, apart from Mithu, the cases cited such as Reyes and Woodson were decided in different textual contexts, as inhuman punishment was expressly prohibited by the constitutions of the respective jurisdictions from which the cases originated. Hence, those cases were strictly based on the issue of what kind of punishment would be considered inhuman and not directly related to the issue on appeal in Yong Vui Kong, which was the meaning of the word law in Article 9(1) of the Singapore Constitution.Yong Vui Kong (substantive appeal), pp. 514‚Äì515, para. 50. As for Mithu itself, the Court held that there were three reasons for not adopting the reasoning of the Indian Supreme Court. First, the test for constitutional validity under Article 9(1) is different from the test applied to Article 21 of the Indian Constitution, which states: \\"No person shall be deprived of his life or personal liberty except according to procedure established by law.\\" The phrase procedure established by law means a \\"fair, just and reasonable procedure established by valid law\\".Mithu, para. 6. In Mithu, section 303 of the Indian Penal Code was found to infringe Article 21 as it did not satisfy this test. However, Singapore's Article 9(1) is worded differently, and does not specifically require that any law passed be \\"fair, just and reasonable\\" for it to be considered law. The Court felt that the \\"fair, just and reasonable\\" test for constitutionality was too vague, as whether a law restricted the right to life or personal liberty according to such criteria would hinge on a court's view of the reasonableness of the law. In effect, the court would be intruding into the legislature's domain.Yong Vui Kong (substantive appeal), p. 526‚Äì527, para. 80. Secondly, according to this interpretation of Article 21 of the Indian Constitution any law which removed judicial discretion would be unconstitutional. The result would be that all mandatory sentences would contravene Article 21. The Court of Appeal held that this was not the law applicable in Singapore.Yong Vui Kong (substantive appeal), p. 527, para. 81. The Court was also of the opinion that in India Article 21 was given relative pride of place in its constitutional framework due to the \\"economic, social and political conditions prevailing in India and the pro-active approach of the Indian Supreme Court in matters relating to the social and economic conditions of the people of India\\". The situation in Singapore was different.Yong Vui Kong (substantive appeal), p. 527, para. 83. Finally, the Court gave two reasons for declining to imply a provision against inhuman punishment into Article 9(1). Singapore's constitutional history was markedly different from that of other Commonwealth countries, and its Constitution does not contain express prohibitions against cruel and inhuman punishments as it is not modelled upon the European Convention on Human Rights.Yong Vui Kong (substantive appeal), pp. 519‚Äì520, para. 61. In addition, in 1966 the Wee Chong Jin Constitutional Commission. specifically considered whether to include a constitutional provision against inhuman punishment. However, the proposal was not taken up by the Government..Yong Vui Kong (substantive appeal), p. 523, para. 71. Customary international law argument The Court of Appeal was of the opinion that customary international law cannot be incorporated into the meaning of the word law in Article 9(1) of the Constitution. Customary international law rules do not have any status in domestic law until they are first accepted and adopted as part of domestic law. This can occur when a rule is incorporated into a statute (in which case it is no longer a customary international law rule but is regarded as domestic law), or when it is judicially declared to be part of the common law of Singapore. However, customary international law can only be incorporated into the common law when it is not inconsistent with existing domestic laws. Given the existence of the mandatory death penalty in several Singapore statutes, the Court was of the opinion that it could not treat the alleged customary international law rule prohibiting inhuman punishment as part of Singapore common law. Also, even if a rule has been incorporated in this manner, it may be overridden by subsequent inconsistent statutory provisions. Moreover, the Court did not accept the contention that customary international law should be conferred constitutional status by being read into the meaning of law in Article 9(1) as this is clearly not in accordance with the normal hierarchy of Singapore law.Yong Vui Kong (substantive appeal), pp. 530‚Äì531, paras. 89‚Äì91. At any rate, whether there is in fact a customary international law rule that prohibits the mandatory death penalty is also far from certain. The Court held that there is a lack of extensive and uniform state practice that supports the contention that customary international law prohibits the mandatory death penalty as an inhuman punishment.Yong Vui Kong (substantive appeal), pp. 531‚Äì534, paras. 93‚Äì99. =Article 12(1) challenge= Agreeing with the Attorney General's submission, the Court of Appeal held that the mandatory death penalty satisfied the reasonable classification test used to assess the constitutionality of legislation with respect to Article 12(1) of the Constitution. Reiterating the Privy Council's holding in Ong Ah Chuan, the Court found that the 15-gram differentia used in the MDA to determine whether the death penalty should be imposed could not be said to be purely arbitrary, and bore a rational relation to the social object of the MDA which was to prevent the growth of drug addiction in Singapore by stamping out the illicit drug trade. There was nothing unreasonable in the legislature concluding that a wholesale dealer operating higher up in the distributive pyramid required a stronger deterrent than smaller scale dealers. It was up to the legislature to determine where the appropriate quantitative boundary was to lie between the two classes of dealers. The Court also held that the quantity of addictive drugs trafficked was broadly proportionate to both the quantity of addictive drugs brought on to the market, as well as the likely harm suffered by society as a result of the offender's crime.Yong Vui Kong (substantive appeal), p. 537, para. 112. On the other hand, the court acknowledged that using a 15-gram differentia might not be the best method of furthering the social object of the MDA. However, the matter of what would constitute a better differentia was one which reasonable people may not necessarily agree on, and so this was a question of social policy best left to the legislature, not the judiciary.Yong Vui Kong (substantive appeal), p. 537, para. 113. Addressing Yong's contention that in reality the mandatory death penalty only had a limited deterrent effect on drug traffickers, the Court said that it was not within its purview to determine the mandatory death penalty's efficacy as a deterrent to drug trafficking. Such an issue was a question of policy and should be left to the legislature to decide. If any changes to the mandatory death penalty or the death penalty in general were to be effected, these had to be done by the legislature and not by the Judiciary under the pretence of constitutional interpretation. In addition, while the court acknowledged it could be argued that there was insufficient evidence of the mandatory death penalty's deterrent effect on serious offences like murder, it could also be said there was insufficient evidence that the mandatory death penalty did not have a deterrent effect.Yong Vui Kong (substantive appeal), p. 537, paras. 117‚Äì118. The Court disagreed with Yong's fifth argument that an offender who did not know the amount of pure diamorphine in the substance he was trafficking had not voluntarily assumed the risk of trafficking. A drug trafficker would know his act was illegal and that he would be punished if caught, regardless of his knowledge of the precise amount of pure diamorphine he was trafficking.Yong Vui Kong (substantive appeal), p. 537, para. 114. Yong's sixth argument was also dismissed, the Court explaining that the reason why the trafficking of a quantity of diamorphine greatly exceeding the 15-gram threshold did not incur a more severe sentence was because it would be impossible to impose a punishment more severe than the death penalty.Yong Vui Kong (substantive appeal), p. 537, para. 115. Further developments Supreme Court of Singapore (left), photographed in August 2010. In this month, the High Court dismissed an application by Yong challenging the use of the President's clemency power. The judgment was affirmed by the Court of Appeal in 2011. =Judicial review of the granting of clemency= Following the delivery of the Court of Appeal's judgment on 14 May 2010, Yong's lawyer M. Ravi filed an application in the High Court for leave to challenge the clemency process by way of judicial review. He sought, among other things, a declaration that it is the President and not the Cabinet that has discretion as to whether Yong's petition for clemency should be granted, and an order to grant Yong an indefinite stay of execution.. Legal observers opined that the move was unprecedented, as petitions for judicial review are usually reserved for executive actions and not processes entrenched in the Constitution.. The argument was based on comments by K. Shanmugam, the Minister for Law, at a dialogue session on 9 May 2010. When asked whether Yong's case would affect Singapore's laws on the mandatory death penalty, the Minister had replied: \\"Yong Vui Kong is young. But if we say, 'We let you go', what's the signal we're sending? ... We are sending a signal to all drug barons out there: Just make sure you choose a victim who's young or a mother of a young child and use them as the people to carry drugs into Singapore.\\" Commenting to the media, Ravi said that if the clemency decision was indeed taken by the Cabinet and not the President, then since Shanmugam was a member of the Cabinet and these statements were made while Yong's case was sub judice, his remarks implied a prejudgment of Yong's appeal for clemency. The Ministry of Law rejected as \\"incorrect\\" Ravi's remarks that the clemency process was flawed. It stated that as the Government's policy on the death penalty for drug offences was a \\"matter of public importance\\", the Government was entitled to comment on it. The Law Ministry also clarified that Shanmugam's comments were merely concerned with the Government's legislative policy and whether it would change, and that the Minister had not commented on any specific issue which was before the Court of Appeal at the time, or on what the outcome of the judgment should be.. In a judgment delivered on 13 August 2010, Justice Steven Chong dismissed the application, ruling that the power to grant a pardon lies with the Cabinet and not the President. This is because Article 21(1) of the Singapore Constitution provides that the President, by default, is to act in accordance with the advice of the Cabinet or a Minister acting under the general authority of the Cabinet, while Article 21(2) lays down an exhaustive range of exceptions from this rule. In situations where the President is empowered to act in his own discretion, the relevant constitutional provisions expressly use the phrase acting in his discretion in reference to the President. However, Article 22P states that the President may grant pardons \\"on the advice of the Cabinet\\", which indicates a contrary intention.Yong Vui Kong v. AG (H.C.), pp. 31‚Äì34, paras. 69‚Äì72. The High Court also rejected Yong's request for an indefinite stay of execution. It held that the test of apparent bias that applies to the judiciary does not govern the executive, as the executive is accountable to the electorate through the election process. Furthermore, a court of law is restricted to considering only the law and facts in making its judgment, but the executive is entitled to \\"formulate and act in accordance with policy, which is wide-ranging by its very nature and difficult to evaluate in accordance with objective legal criteria\\".Yong Vui Kong v. AG (H.C.), pp. 34‚Äì35, paras. 75‚Äì76. On 4 April 2011, the Court of Appeal dismissed an appeal filed by Yong against the judgment. It affirmed the High Court's view that the President did not possess any personal discretion when exercising the clemency power, and was required to act in accordance with Cabinet's advice on the matter. This conclusion was evident from the wording of Article 22P(1) of the Constitution, the legislative history of the clemency power in Singapore, relevant case law, and the nature of the President's power in the Constitution.. The Court also noted that both Yong and the Attorney- General agreed that the power of clemency was vested exclusively in the executive and was not justiciable on the merits, because of the doctrine of separation of powers and established administrative law principles.Yong Vui Kong v. AG (C.A.), p. 1232, para. 75. Nonetheless, the use of the power could be judicially reviewed if it was exercised in bad faith for an extraneous purpose, or in a way that contravened constitutional protections and rights.Yong Vui Kong v. AG (C.A.), p. 1234, para. 80, citing Law Society of Singapore v. Tan Guat Neo Phyllis [2008] 2 S.L.R.(R.) 239 at 313, para. 149, H.C. (Singapore). In addition, the Court was of the opinion that the clemency process could not be regarded as having been tainted by a reasonable suspicion of bias due to the Law Minister's remarks. The Minister had merely been setting out the Government's policy of taking a tough approach towards serious drug trafficking offences by imposing a mandatory death penalty as a deterrent. In any case, the rule against bias should not be applied to ministers making public statements on government policy in the same way as it applies to judicial or quasi-judicial officers, otherwise no minister would be able to speak on any policy in public or in Parliament without the statement being regarded as a predetermination of any decision relating to the policy that might have to be made subsequently. Even if the Law Minister's statements indicated that he intended not to grant clemency to Yong, this predetermination could not be attributed to other Cabinet ministers. The alternative view was untenable, as it would mean that once any minister spoke about the Government's policy on the death penalty in a way that showed predetermination of the issue, the entire Cabinet would be disentitled from advising the President on how he should exercise the clemency power.Yong Vui Kong v. AG (C.A.), pp. 1246‚Äì1250, paras. 116‚Äì128. =Actions taken by Malaysian Government and civil society groups= Yong's lawyer urged the Government of Malaysia to take Yong's case to the International Court of Justice to determine whether Singapore's conduct has violated local and international law.. Malaysian Foreign Minister Anifah Aman subsequently sent an appeal for clemency on Yong's behalf to the Singapore Government in July 2010.. Yong's case has aroused interest among Singaporean and Malaysian human rights activists. A Save Vui Kong campaign was formed jointly by the Civil Rights Committee of the Kuala Lumpur and Selangor Chinese Assembly Hall and human rights group SUARAM. On 24 August 2010, a petition calling on President S.R. Nathan to spare Yong's life ‚Äì bearing 109,346 signatures gathered from petitioners in Sabah, other parts of Malaysia, Singapore, and online ‚Äì was delivered to the Istana, the President's official residence..

Attorney-General is the name of two cases of the Singapore courts, a High Court decision delivered in 2008 and the 2009 judgment by the Court of Appeal. The main issue raised by the case was whether the Collector of Land Revenue had treated the plaintiffs (later appellants), who were devotees of the Jin Long Si Temple, unequally by compulsorily acquiring for public purposes the land on which the temple stood but not the lands of a Hindu mission and a Christian church nearby. It was alleged that the authorities had acted in violation of Article 12(1) of the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore, which guarantees the rights to equality before the law and equal protection of the law. The High Court held that the plaintiffs lacked locus standi to bring the action as they were not the temple's legal owners. In any case, as there was evidence that the authorities had rational reasons for treating the temple property differently from the property of the Mission and the Church, the High Court found that there had been no breach of Article 12(1). Furthermore, the Court determined that the plaintiffs were guilty of inordinate delay in bringing the action. On appeal, this decision was upheld in part by the Court of Appeal. The Court of Appeal found that the plaintiffs (appellants) had locus standi to bring the action as they were members of a Buddhist association, for whose benefit the temple property was held by its trustees. In addition, the Court found that the plaintiffs had not been guilty of inordinate delay in commencing the suit. However, the Court agreed with the trial judge that the Collector had not acted in violation of Article 12(1). In determining this issue, the Court held that the test to be applied is \\"whether there is a reasonable nexus between the state action taken and the object of the law\\". Such a nexus will be absent if the action amounts to \\"intentional and arbitrary discrimination\\" or intentional systematic discrimination. It is insufficient if any inequality is due to \\"inadvertence or inefficiency\\", unless this occurs on a very substantial scale. In addition, inequalities arising from a reasonable administrative policy or which are mere errors of judgment are insufficient to constitute a violation of Article 12(1). Background The Jin Long Si Temple, formerly at 61 Lorong A-Leng near Lorong How Sun in Singapore The plaintiffs in this case were devotees of the Jin Long Si Temple, (\\"Eng Foong Ho (C.A.)\\"), summarized in , and also briefly described in . See also ; . which was a temple in the Serangoon area of Singapore espousing Buddhist, Confucian and Taoist teachings. The temple property, which was located near the site of the Bartley Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) station, was compulsorily acquired pursuant to the Land Acquisition Act.. The Government Gazette notification relating to the acquisition published on 20 January 2003 specified that the temple property (together with another piece of land nearby) had been acquired for the construction and comprehensive redevelopment of the Mass Rapid Transit's Circle Line.Eng Foong Ho (C.A.), p. 545, paras. 6‚Äì7. The trustees of the temple property noted that the nearby Ramakrishna Mission (\\"the Mission\\") and the Bartley Christian Church (\\"the Church\\") were not similarly acquired, and proceeded to appeal against the acquisition through various avenues, including an appeal to the Prime Minister. Their attempts were unsuccessful.Eng Foong Ho (C.A.), p. 545, para. 8. Lawsuit Following the failure of the last appeal by the trustees of the temple, in January 2008 the plaintiffs filed an application in the High Court for a declaratory order against the compulsory acquisition. Their filing was based on Article 12(1) of the Constitution of Singapore, which reads: \\"All persons are equal before the law and entitled to the equal protection of the law.\\" The filing alleged that the executive action of acquiring the temple land was discriminatory and in violation of Article 12(1).Eng Foong Ho (C.A.), p. 546, para. 10; p. 549, para. 23. High Court judgment =Plaintiffs lack locus standi= The preliminary issue arising during the trial in the High Court was whether the plaintiffs had locus standi to commence the action. The plaintiffs claimed to have a strong emotional connection to the temple which gave them a \\"legitimate interest\\" in this issue. (\\"Eng Foong Ho (H.C.)\\"). For a summary of this decision, see . However, Justice Tan Lee Meng held that the plaintiffs, who were merely temple devotees, did not have the required locus standi to institute the proceedings, as opposed to the trustees of the temple who were its legal owners. He relied on the Court of Appeal's judgment in Karaha Bodas Co. LLC v. Pertamina Energy Trading Ltd. (2005),. which stated that \\"to have the necessary standing, the plaintiff must be asserting the recognition of a 'right' that is personal to him\\".Karaha Bodas, pp. 120‚Äì121, para. 15. The Court also referred to Lord Diplock's judgment in Gouriet v. Union of Post Office Workers (1977). where he held that the courts should only be concerned with rights in so much as they are legal rights which are enforceable by one party against another. The High Court rejected the plaintiffs' argument that, by compulsorily acquiring a temple, the Government was limiting a person's right under Article 15(1) of the Constitution. to profess, practice and propagate his or her religion, and that this in turn gave him or her the legal right to commence an action on the ground that where an individual's constitutional rights are affected, he or she has a sufficient interest to ensure that his or her rights are protected.Eng Foong Ho (H.C.), pp. 441‚Äì442, para. 13, citing Chan Hiang Leng Colin v. Minister for Information and the Arts [1996] 1 S.L.R.(R.) 294, C.A. (Singapore). The court ruling held that this land acquisition matter was not in any way related to religious freedom.Eng Foong Ho (H.C.), p. 442, para. 15. Because the acquisition was not related to religious freedom, the High Court found that only the trustees who were the legal owners of the temple property had the requisite locus standi to institute proceedings if they deemed their rights to have been infringed.Thio, \\"Administrative and Constitutional Law\\" (2008), p. 35, para. 1.117. =Article 12(1) of the Constitution not violated= In his ruling, Justice Tan cited Ong Ah Chuan v. Public Prosecutor (1980)Ong Ah Chuan v. Public Prosecutor [1980] UKPC 32, [1981] A.C. 648, [1979‚Äì1980] S.L.R.(R.) 710, Privy Council (on appeal from Singapore). for the proposition that \\"[e]quality before the law and equal protection of the law require that like should be compared with like. What Article 12(1) of the Constitution assures to the individual is the right to equal treatment with other individuals in similar circumstances.\\"Ong Ah Chuan, p. 725, para. 35; Thio, \\"Administrative and Constitutional Law\\" (2008), pp. 35‚Äì36, para. 1.120. He noted that the plaintiffs had made it clear that they were not alleging bad faith on the part of the authorities in acquiring the temple land; rather, that they asserted there were no rational reasons for treating the temple property differently from that of the Mission and the Church.Eng Foong Ho (H.C.), p. 443, para. 20. However, the judge regarded this as an \\"unsubstantiated allegation\\".Eng Foong Ho (H.C.), p. 444, para. 24. According to a notification published in the Government Gazette, the temple property had been acquired for comprehensive redevelopment of the site. Under section 5(3) of the Land Acquisition Act, the notification was conclusive evidence that the property was required for that purpose. The judge accepted evidence tendered by the Attorney-General that the property of the Church and the Mission had not been compulsorily acquired because they were unsuitable for redevelopment. As no state land adjoined the Church property or the surrounding lands, there was no reasonable opportunity for amalgamating the Church property with existing state land. As for the Mission property, the three main buildings on it had been under study for conservation since 2002, and were gazetted for conservation in 2006.Eng Foong Ho (H.C.), pp. 443‚Äì444, paras. 21‚Äì22; Thio, \\"Administrative and Constitutional Law\\" (2008), pp. 35‚Äì36, paras. 1.119 and 1.121‚Äì1.122. There was \\"ample evidence\\" that, where necessary, the Government had acquired for public purposes properties zoned as places of worship.Eng Foong Ho (H.C.), pp. 445‚Äì446, para. 27; Thio, \\"Administrative and Constitutional Law\\" (2008), p. 36, para. 1.123. Although one of the plaintiffs' witnesses, a chartered land surveyor, had suggested that the authorities could redevelop the land in a different manner, he did not state that the authorities' redevelopment plan was wrong or indefensible. The court was not in a position to decide which plans for redeveloping areas in Singapore were better.Eng Foong Ho (H.C.), pp. 444‚Äì445, paras. 24‚Äì25; Thio, \\"Administrative and Constitutional Law\\" (2008), p. 36, para. 1.122. Thus, the acquisition of the temple property had not infringed Article 12(1) of the Constitution. =Inordinate delay= The Court found that, in any case, the plaintiffs had inordinately delayed commencing an action. The Court noted that the notice to acquire the land had been gazetted on 20 January 2003, more than five years before the High Court decision. Tan rejected the plaintiffs' argument that they were not guilty of delay since it was only in November 2007 that they learned that the authorities would not be reversing their decision. In his view, the fact that the decision would not be reversed was \\"made plain long ago\\".Eng Foong Ho (H.C.), p. 446, paras. 28‚Äì29. Court of Appeal judgment Supreme Court of Singapore, photographed in December 2005, where the appeal in Eng Foong Ho v. Attorney-General was heard by the Court of Appeal On appeal to the Court of Appeal, three issues were raised. The first issue was whether the plaintiffs (appellants) had the requisite locus standi. The second was whether there had been an inordinate delay on the appellants' part in pursuing the matter in court. The third issue is the most significant, namely, whether the acquisition of the temple property violated Article 12(1) of the Constitution.Eng Foong Ho (C.A.), p. 544, para. 2. =Plaintiffs have locus standi= The Court of Appeal disagreed with the trial judge's finding with regard to locus standi. Judge of Appeal Andrew Phang, delivering the Court's judgment, opined that since according to the land register the temple was held in trust for San Jiao Sheng Tang Buddhist Association, of which the devotees were members, they had the requisite locus standi to bring the issue before the court.Eng Foong Ho (C.A.), p. 547, para. 17.Thio, \\"Administrative and Constitutional Law\\" (2009), p. 8, para. 1.18. Eng Foong Ho was subsequently cited in Tan Eng Hong v. Attorney-General (2011)Tan Eng Hong v. Attorney-General [2011] 3 S.L.R. 320, H.C. (Singapore). in support of the proposition that in order for a person to have locus standi to launch a constitutional claim, he or she must allege a violation of his or her own constitutional rights ‚Äì that is, a \\"substantial interest\\" ‚Äì rather than satisfy a lower \\"sufficient interest\\" test.Tan Eng Hong, pp. 325‚Äì327, paras. 8‚Äì13. =No inordinate delay= The Court of Appeal also held that although there had prima facie been a delay, the appellants at the time had believed that the trustees and the authorities were engaged in settlement discussions that might lead to resolution of the dispute. In those circumstances, the Court opined that there had not been an inordinate delay by the appellants in starting their lawsuit. Furthermore, the Court opined on an obiter basis that, in any case, a \\"delay in asserting one's constitutional rights may not always be a relevant factor unless the State has been irreparably prejudiced by the assertion of such rights\\".Eng Foong Ho (C.A.), p. 548, para. 20. =No violation of Article 12(1)= Modified rational nexus test Article 12 in the 1999 Reprint of the Constitution of Singapore In its ruling, the Court of Appeal cited Ong Ah Chuan, wherein Lord Diplock held that Article 12(1), which sets out the principle of equality before the law and equal protection of the law, \\"prohibits laws which require that some individuals within a single class should be treated by way of punishment more harshly than others\\". In essence, persons belonging to the same class should be treated in the same manner. Bearing in mind the separation of powers, Lord Diplock was of the opinion that it was up to the legislature to decide the differentia distinguishing different classes of individuals. If the factor which the legislature adopts as constituting the dissimilarity in circumstances is not purely arbitrary but bears a reasonable relation to the social object of the law, there is no inconsistency with Article 12(1) of the Constitution.Ong Ah Chuan, p. 725, para. 37. This concept was more fully expounded in Public Prosecutor v. Taw Cheng Kong (1998),Public Prosecutor v. Taw Cheng Kong [1998] 2 S.L.R.(R.) 489 , C.A. (Singapore). in which the Court of Appeal reasoned that since the object of Article 12(1) is to guard against various forms of arbitrariness, the test to be applied is to ask if the law treats different classes of persons differently. If it does, then the court must ask whether the differential treatment is based on intelligible differentia. The court must then go on to consider whether the basis of differential treatment bears a reasonable relation or nexus to the object of the law.Taw Cheng Kong, p. 508, para. 59. In Eng Foong Ho, the Court of Appeal noted that it was not necessary to discuss the principle of reasonable classification of laws which was the subject of Taw Cheng Kong, since the appellants had not challenged the constitutionality of the Land Acquisition Act.Eng Foong Ho (C.A.), p. 550, para. 27. In the present case, the appellants were challenging the application rather than the validity of the Act. The Court therefore applied a modified form of the Taw Cheng Kong rational nexus test, holding that \\"[t]he question is whether there is a reasonable nexus between the state action and the objective to be achieved by the law\\".Eng Foong Ho (C.A.), p. 550, para. 25; Thio, \\"Administrative and Constitutional Law\\" (2009), p. 9, para. 1.21. The Court opinion relied on the principles set out in the Privy Council cases Howe Yoon Chong v. Chief Assessor (1980)Howe Yoon Chong v. Chief Assessor [1980] UKPC 26, [1979‚Äì1980] S.L.R.(R.) 594, Privy Council (on appeal from Singapore). and Howe Yoon Chong v. Chief Assessor (1990).Howe Yoon Chong v. Chief Assessor [1990] UKPC 7, [1990] 1 S.L.R.(R.) 78, P.C. (on appeal from Singapore). These cases involved alleged inequality in property valuation for the purpose of determining property tax. The significance of the two Howe Yoon Chong cases is that they prescribed limits as to what constitutes inequality. Several salient points were drawn from the cases in Eng Foong Ho:Thio, \\"Administrative and Constitutional Law\\" (2009), pp. 9‚Äì10, paras. 1.22‚Äì1.23. *An executive act may be unconstitutional if it amounts to \\"intentional and arbitrary discrimination\\".Eng Foong Ho (C.A.), p. 553, para. 30, citing Public Prosecutor v. Ang Soon Huat [1990] 2 S.L.R.(R.) 246 at 258, para. 23, H.C. (Singapore), which in turn cited Howe Yoon Chong (1990), p. 84, para. 17. Thus, an intentional systematic undervaluation of property would breach Article 12(1) of the Constitution, though \\"something less might perhaps suffice\\".Eng Foong Ho (C.A.), p. 551, paras. 28, citing Howe Yoon Chong (1980), p. 600, para. 13. *However, absolute equality is not attainable and inequalities arising from \\"the application of a reasonable administrative policy\\"Eng Foong Ho (C.A.), p. 552, para. 29, citing Howe Yoon Chong (1990), p. 84, para. 17. or \\"mere errors of judgment\\"Eng Foong Ho (C.A.), p. 551, para. 29, citing Howe Yoon Chong (1990), p. 83, para. 13, itself citing Sunday Lake Iron Co. v. Township of Wakefield , Supreme Court (United States). are not sufficient to constitute a violation of Article 12(1). Inequalities due to \\"inadvertence or inefficiency\\" need to be on \\"a very substantial scale\\" to violate the Article. Thio Li-ann has noted that it is not clear whether the Court of Appeal was laying down \\"intentional and arbitrary discrimination\\" as the sole test for whether executive acts comply with Article 12(1) of the Constitution, or whether it is only one possible test and that executive acts can also be challenged if they fail a reasonable classification test. This is because \\"[a]rbitrariness implies the lack of any rationality\\",Ang Soon Huat, p. 258, para. 23, cited in Eng Foong Ho (C.A.), p. 553, para. 30. and it is much harder for a plaintiff to prove that executive action is irrational than to show that there is no reasonable classification in the action.Thio, \\"Administrative and Constitutional Law, p. 11, para. 1.24. Application of law to the facts On the facts, Justice Phang remarked in his opinion that the appellants had not alleged any arbitrary action by the Government in compulsorily acquiring the temple property, and had in fact conceded that the acquisition had been proceeded with in good faith. Thus, the judge noted that \\"it is not clear where the discrimination lies other than in the consequential fact that the properties of the Mission and the Church were not acquired but that of the Temple was\\".Eng Foong Ho (C.A.), p. 553, para. 31.Thio, \\"Administrative and Constitutional Law\\", pp. 10‚Äì11, para. 1.23. The Attorney-General (respondent) presented the following evidence: *The Government had a long-standing policy of optimizing land use around MRT stations, and the amalgamation of the state land adjoining the temple property provided an opportunity to realize significant development potential of the land.Eng Foong Ho (C.A.), pp. 553‚Äì554, para. 32. *In contrast, there was no state land adjoining the Church. It was surrounded by a low density housing area and thus did not provide the same developmental potential as the temple property.Eng Foong Ho (C.A.), p. 554, para. 33. *The Mission site had been under study for conservation since 2002. The three main buildings on the site were eventually gazetted for conservation in 2006, and hence the site was inappropriate for acquisition. Although the appellant had argued that a football field on the Mission site should have been acquired instead of the temple property, the three main buildings were functionally integrated and acquisition of part of the Mission site would have resulted in a plot of state land that was highly irregular in shape. In any case, the appellant's argument did not relate to proper land use planning.Eng Foong Ho (C.A.), p. 554, para. 34. In essence, the Court found that the decision of the Collector of Land Revenue was \\"based solely on planning considerations\\".Eng Foong Ho (C.A.), p. 555, para. 35. This finding satisfied the rational nexus test, and thus it was clear that Article 12(1) of the Constitution had not been violated. Justice Phang also held that section 5(3) of the Land Acquisition Act was not necessarily determinative of the matter in the Collector's favour, as acquisitions can be challenged for having been made in bad faith. However, the provision applied in this case as no bad faith on the Collector's part had been alleged by the appellants.Eng Foong Ho (C.A.), pp. 555‚Äì556, para. 39.

Article 14 of the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore, specifically Article 14(1), guarantees to Singapore citizens the rights to freedom of speech and expression, peaceful assembly without arms, and association. However, the enjoyment of these rights may be restricted by laws imposed by the Parliament of Singapore on the grounds stated in Article 14(2) of the Constitution. There are two types of grounds. For the first type, it must be shown that restricting the rights is \\"necessary or expedient in the interest\\" of the grounds. The grounds are the security of Singapore and public order (applicable to all three rights protected by Article 14(1)), morality (freedom of speech and freedom of association), and friendly relations with other countries (freedom of speech only). In a 2005 judgment, the High Court expressed the view that the phrase necessary or expedient confers upon Parliament \\"an extremely wide discretionary power and remit that permits a multifarious and multifaceted approach towards achieving any of the purposes specified in Art 14(2) of the Constitution\\". It is unnecessary for the courts to determine whether a legislative restriction of a right is reasonable. All that is required is a nexus between the objective underlying the restrictive law and one of the grounds specified in Article 14(2) that Parliament is entitled to restrict the right on. The right to free speech is limited on the ground of the security of Singapore by the , and on the ground of public order by the and . Public order also justifies restrictions on both free speech and assembly imposed by the , and ; and restrictions on the right to freedom of association imposed by the . Freedom of speech has also been limited on the basis of morality by the , which establishes film censorship and classification regimes; and the , under which obscene or otherwise objectionable publications may be banned. No necessity or expedience requirement applies to the second type of grounds, which appear in Articles 14(2)(a) (restrictions \\"designed to protect the privileges of Parliament or to provide against contempt of court, defamation or incitement to any offence\\") and 14(3) (laws relating to labour or education). At present, it appears that Parliament may restrict Article 14(1) rights on these grounds simply by enacting legislation, and that the courts are not entitled to assess if the restrictions are appropriate. The privileges of Parliament are set out in the , and the Singapore courts have held that the common law offence of scandalizing the court (a form of contempt of court) does not violate Article 14(1)(a). The courts have also determined that the traditional common law rules of the tort of defamation strike a proper balance between free speech and the protection of reputation, and have declined to apply a public figure doctrine or responsible journalism as additional defences to the tort. Text of Article 14 Article 14(1) of the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore. was designed to protect the rights to freedom of speech and expression, peaceful assembly without arms, and association. It is subject to Article 14(2) which qualifies these rights. Judicial and statutory limits have been read into the Article, a process which is deemed necessary because the rights to free speech, assembly and association do not exist in a vacuum but jostle with competing interests and counter-values.. As was said in Chee Siok Chin v. Ministry of Home Affairs (2005),. \\"[f]reedom of action invariably ends where conflicting rights and/or interests collide\\".Chee Siok Chin, p. 632, para. 136. The text of Article 14, which is entitled \\"Freedom of speech, assembly and association\\", is as follows: Articles 14(1) to (3) are in pari materia with Articles 10(1) to (3) of the Constitution of Malaysia, from which they were adopted following Singapore's independence from Malaysia in 1965., s. 6(1). Articles 14(1) and (2) are also somewhat similar to Articles 19(1) to (4) of the Constitution of India. There is no constitutional right to bear arms in Singapore, as Article 14(1)(b) provides Singapore citizens with \\"the right to assemble peaceably and without arms\\". Under the Arms and Explosives Act,. no person may possess, import, export, manufacture or deal in any arms or explosives without a licence. It may be that the words and without arms were included in Article 14(1)(b) to ensure that arguments based on the clause in the English Bill of Rights 1689Bill of Rights 1689 (1 Will. & Mary, sess. 2, c. 2) (UK). stating that \\"the Subjects which are Protestants may have Arms for their Defence suitable to their Conditions and as allowed by Law\\", which inspired the Second Amendment to the United States Constitution (\\"A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.\\"), cannot be raised in Singapore. The freedoms of speech, assembly and association guaranteed by the Constitution are enjoyed only by Singapore citizens. In Review Publishing Co. Ltd. v. Lee Hsien Loong (2009),Review Publishing Co. Ltd. v. Lee Hsien Loong [2010] 1 S.L.R. 52, Court of Appeal (Singapore). it was held that the appellant newspaper company did not have the requisite locus standi to rely on the constitutional right of free speech and expression as it was not a Singapore citizen, and Article 14(1)(a) of the Constitution expressly provides that only Singapore citizens are entitled to the right.Review Publishing, p. 171, para. 257. Restrictions on the rights The rights guaranteed to the citizens of Singapore by Article 14(1) are subject to restrictions set out in subsection (2) of the same Article. In Chee Siok Chin, Justice V.K. Rajah elucidated the justification for these qualifications: In 1993 in a statement delivered at the World Conference on Human Rights, the Minister for Foreign Affairs Wong Kan Seng took the position that \\"order and stability are essential for development\\" as economic growth requires a stable legal environment protective of contractual and property rights.. The statement was also published as . Excessive focus on civil-political liberties during the early stages of national development would impair this. However, the Government appears to have loosened restrictions on political liberties like free speech over time to manage demands for a more participatory political culture.See, for example, . In fact, citizens were urged by Deputy Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong not to be \\"passive bystanders in their own fate\\" but to debate issues \\"with reason, passion and conviction\\". Wrestling with \\"honest differences\\" was to be preferred over being \\"an apathetic society with no view\\".. Parliament may impose restrictions on the rights guaranteed by Article 14(1) on two types of grounds. For the first type, it must be shown that restricting the rights is \\"necessary or expedient in the interest\\" of the grounds. No such requirement applies to the second type of grounds, which appear in Articles 14(2)(a) and 14(3). At present, it appears that Parliament may restrict Article 14(1) rights on these grounds simply by enacting legislation, and that the courts are not entitled to assess if the restrictions are appropriate.Chee Siok Chin, pp. 602‚Äì603, para. 49.Compare Yong Vui Kong v. Public Prosecutor [2010] 3 S.L.R. 489 at 526‚Äì527, para. 80, C.A. (Singapore), in which the Court of Appeal declined to hold that any procedural law must be \\"fair, just and reasonable\\" to fall within the meaning of the word law in Article 9(1) of the Constitution: \\"Such a test hinges on the court's view of the reasonableness of the law in question, and requires the court to intrude into the legislative sphere of Parliament as well as engage in policy making.\\" =Meaning of Parliament may by law impose= Article 14(2) of the Constitution states that \\"Parliament may by law impose\\" restrictions on the rights referred to in Article 14(1). This is arguably in line with Singapore's adoption of the Westminster system of government that rests upon parliamentary supremacy, the rule of law and common law principles.. The terms law and written law are defined in Article 2(1) of the Constitution as follows: One reading of Article 14(2) is that in order to restrict the rights to freedom of speech, assembly and association, Parliament must impose the restrictions by passing written laws, that is, Acts of Parliament, since it exercises the legislative power of Singapore by passing bills that are assented to by the President.Constitution, Art. 58(1). However, in Jeyaretnam Joshua Benjamin v. Lee Kuan Yew (1990),Jeyaretnam Joshua Benjamin v. Lee Kuan Yew [1990] 1 S.L.R.(R.) 337, C.A. (Singapore). a case involving defamation law, the Court of Appeal took a much broader approach. The Court noted that according to Article 2(1), law in Article 14(2) includes the common law in so far as it is in operation in Singapore. In May 1963, the Parliament of Malaysia had enacted the Malaysia Act 1963,Malaysia Act 1963 (No. 26 of 1963) (Malaysia). which extended the Defamation Act 1957Defamation Act 1957 (No. 20 of 1957) (Malaysia). to Singapore, then a state in the Federation of Malaysia. Since the Act, now the , was premised on common law rules of the tort of defamation, the Court held that the Legislature had \\"clearly intended that the common law relating to defamation, as modified by the Act, should continue to apply in Singapore\\". Thus, it is \\"manifestly beyond argument that Art 14(1)(a) is subject to the common law of defamation as modified by the Act\\".Jeyaretnam Joshua Benjamin, p. 339, para. 5, cited in the later decision Jeyaretnam Joshua Benjamin v. Lee Kuan Yew [1992] 1 S.L.R.(R.) 791 at 817, para. 59, C.A. (Singapore). It has been said that this argument \\"suffers from two fatal flaws\\".. There is no evidence that the constitutionality of the existing rules of defamation was considered by either the Malaysian or Singapore Parliaments. More significantly, even if the Governments of Malaysia and Singapore had believed these rules to be constitutional, this should not have been treated by the Court of Appeal as decisive as it is the courts' duty to independently determine whether the assumption is justified. Otherwise, a similar argument might be extended to all legislation passed by Parliament, and \\"[i]t is not difficult to see that this would spell the end of constitutional law itself\\".Hor, \\"Freedom of Speech and Defamation\\", pp. 550‚Äì551. =Restrictions premised on necessity or expediency= Parliament may restrict the rights to free speech, assembly and association on the grounds set out in the table below if it is \\"necessary or expedient in the interest\\" of them: Grounds on which Article 14(1) rights may be restricted if it is \\"necessary or expedient\\" to do so (SG is an abbreviation for Singapore) In Chee Siok Chin, the High Court interpreted the phrase necessary or expedient as conferring upon Parliament \\"an extremely wide discretionary power and remit that permits a multifarious and multifaceted approach towards achieving any of the purposes specified in Art 14(2) of the Constitution\\". The Court emphasized the fact that, unlike Article 19(3) of the Constitution of India which provides that the right to fetter the freedom of speech and assembly is subject to the touchstone of reasonableness, Singapore's Article 14(2) does not contain the word reasonable. However, despite the broad power that Article 19(3) accords to the Indian courts, they have been \\"most reluctant\\" to invalidate legislation purportedly infringing the rights to free speech or assembly. There exists a strong presumption of legislative constitutionality, as the Supreme Court of India has expressed a need for \\"judicial self-restraint and extreme caution\\" when determining whether legislation unreasonably restricts a constitutional right.Chee Siok Chin, p. 601, para. 48. It has been noted that the Indian courts have thus been used to exemplify how much more deference Singapore courts should give to the Government, and that the Article 14(2) derogation clause was said to confer upon Parliament a great amount of discretionary power.. Thio notes that the High Court in Chee Siok Chin (at p. 601, para. 47) cited , to the effect that \\"a Court is not a second or revising Chamber from the decision of the Legislature and that it is only in the clearest case that a Court will declare a law invalid\\". The High Court also rejected the use of a proportionality analysis when determining the extent of Parliament's powers to impose restrictions on individual rights. The analysis enables the judiciary to assess if an interference with rights is proportionate to a legitimate and important aim of the legislation in question. A court will inquire into whether relevant and sufficient reasons justify the statutory interference, and may substitute its own judgment for that of Parliament. The High Court concluded: \\"Needless to say, the notion of proportionality has never been part of the common law in relation to the judicial review of the exercise of a legislative and/or an administrative power or discretion. Nor has it ever been part of Singapore law.\\"Chee Siok Chin, p. 616, para. 87. In Singapore administrative law, disproportionality is not regarded as a distinct ground of judicial review but as an aspect of Wednesbury unreasonableness in that a decision by a public authority that is disproportionate goes towards showing that it is so irrational that no reasonable authority would have arrived at it: Chng Suan Tze v. Minister for Home Affairs [1988] 2 S.L.R.(R.) 525 at 564, para. 121, C.A. (Singapore). Furthermore, judicial review of administrative action is limited to an assessment of the legality of the decision-making process and does not extend to a review of the merits of the decision itself: Lines International Holdings (S) Pte. Ltd. v. Singapore Tourism Board [1997] 1 S.L.R.(R.) 52 at 79, para. 78, H.C. (Singapore). Bearing in mind these restraints, the court's only task is to ascertain whether an impugned law is within the purview of any of the permissible restrictions. Hence, all that needs to be established is a nexus between the object of the law in question and one of the permissible subjects stipulated in Article 14(2). In doing so, the Government must merely satisfy the court that there is a factual basis on which Parliament has considered it \\"necessary or expedient\\" to restrict one's individual right to freedom of speech, assembly or association.. When determining whether legislative restrictions are \\"in the interest of\\" the relevant purposes specified in Article 14(2), the courts may examine the impugned statute, relevant parliamentary material and contemporary speeches and documents, and will adopt a \\"generous and not a pedantic interpretation\\". Moreover, the term in the interest of, when contrasted with the maintenance of, grants \\"a much wider legislative remit that allows Parliament to take a prophylactic approach\\" and includes \\"laws that are not purely designed or crafted for the immediate or direct maintenance\\" of the Article 14(2) grounds.Chee Siok Chin, p. 603, para. 50. Security of Singapore; friendly relations with other countries Parliament may restrict the rights to freedom of speech, assembly or association if it is necessary or expedient in the interests of the security of Singapore or any part thereof. The courts have taken a broad approach to this exception, and have shown a considerable amount of deference to the Government. For instance, in Public Prosecutor v. Phua Keng Tong (1986),Public Prosecutor v. Phua Keng Tong [1985‚Äì1986] 1 S.L.R.(R.) 545, H.C. (Singapore). a case involving the Official Secrets Act, (now ). the High Court held that security in Article 14(2) does not merely mean protection from danger but includes the \\"protection of information which the Government considers vital or essential for its administration\\".Phua Keng Tong, p. 553, para. 13. However, not everything that the Government regards as an official secret will be necessarily be deemed to be so by the court, especially if the information is \\"innocuous in nature\\". The burden of proving that official information is secret lies on the Prosecution.Bridges Christopher v. Public Prosecutor [1997] 1 S.L.R.(R.) 156 at 164, para. 34, H.C. (Singapore). The point was upheld when the matter was brought before the Court of Appeal by way of criminal reference: Public Prosecutor v. Bridges Christopher [1997] 3 S.L.R.(R.) 467 at 485, para. 39, C.A. (Singapore). Freedom of speech and expression may also be restricted in the interest of friendly relations with other countries. This ground of restriction has not yet been considered by local courts, but might have justified the withdrawal by the Board of Film Censors (BFC) of a certificate issued for the film Zoolander (2001) with effect from 8 February 2002.; . The film, a comedy about a male model played by Ben Stiller who is brainwashed into attempting to assassinate the Prime Minister of Malaysia,. had earlier been condemned by the Malaysian Film Censorship Board as \\"definitely unsuitable\\", though it did not impose a ban as it expected film distributors to exercise discretion.. The BFC stated only that the film had been banned \\"in view of controversial elements gathered from feedback\\". The ban was lifted at the beginning of 2006, which enabled the film to be released on DVD.. Public order Speakers' Corner in Singapore is the only venue where rallies and other restricted events may be held without permits under the Public Entertainments and Meetings Act. and Public Order Act,. except during an election period Article 14(2) also empowers Parliament to impose restrictions on the rights guaranteed by all three limbs of Article 14(1) on the ground of public order. The term public order has been given an expansive interpretation that highlights the importance which the Singapore Government places upon social stability. In Chee Siok Chin, which dealt with the constitutionality of sections 13A and 13B of the Miscellaneous Offences (Public Order and Nuisance) Act. the High Court approved the following quotation from V.N. Shukla's Constitution of India (9th ed., 1994):, cited in Chee Siok Chin, p. 603, para. 50. Such an interpretation is consistent with earlier cases. In Chan Hiang Leng Colin v. Public Prosecutor (1994),. Chief Justice Yong Pung How considered the term in relation to the right to freedom of religion embodied in Article 15(4) of the ConstitutionArt. 15(4) of the Constitution states: \\"This Article does not authorise any act contrary to any general law relating to public order, public health or morality.\\" and stated:Chan Hiang Leng Colin, p. 235, para. 64. In Chee Siok Chin it was further clarified that \\"the legislative power to circumscribe the rights conferred by Art 14 of the Constitution is, inter alia, delineated by what is 'in the interest of public order' and not confined to 'the maintenance of public order'. This is a much wider legislative remit that allows Parliament to take a prophylactic approach in the maintenance of public order. This necessarily will include laws that are not purely designed or crafted for the immediate or direct maintenance of public order ...\\". =Restrictions on freedom of speech and assembly= The Government has power to limit the circulation of local and foreign media in Singapore under the Broadcasting Act. and the Newspaper and Printing Presses Act (\\"NPPA\\"). (\\"NPPA\\"). See generally . These Acts can be considered as imposing restrictions on free speech based on public order. For instance, the Broadcasting (Class Licence) Notification,Broadcasting (Class Licence) Notification (Gazette Notification (G.N.) No. S 306/1996; now Cap. 28, N 1, 2004 Rev. Ed.), archived from the original on 6 February 2011. made under section 9 of the Broadcasting Act, makes it mandatory for an Internet content provider to register with the Media Development Authority (MDA) if it is, or if the Authority thinks that it is, an individual providing any programme about or a body of persons engaged in the \\"propagation, promotion or discussion of political or religious issues relating to Singapore, on the World Wide Web through the Internet\\".Broadcasting (Class Licence) Notification, Sch., conditions 4 and 5(b). The MDA can fine a licensee, or suspend or cancel its licence, if it has breached the terms of its licence, any relevant code of practice issued by the Authority, any provisions of the Broadcasting Act, or any direction issued by the Authority or the Minister for Information, Communications and the Arts.Broadcasting Act, s. 12(1). In addition, it is an offence to provide a broadcasting service without a licence,Broadcasting Act, ss. 8(1) read with s. 9. and a convicted person is liable to a fine of up to S$200,000, jail of up to three years, or both. If the offence continues after conviction, a further fine of up to $10,000 per day may be imposed.Broadcasting Act, s. 46. The Minister may declare that any foreign broadcasting service which is rebroadcast in Singapore has been \\"engaging in the domestic politics of Singapore\\".Broadcasting Act, s. 31(1). Rebroadcasting such a \\"declared foreign broadcasting service\\" is prohibited without the Minister's approval, which can be refused, revoked without reasons, or granted on conditions, which may include restrictions on the number of people permitted to receive the service and suspensions of the service for certain periods.Broadcasting Act, ss. 31(2)‚Äì(4). Failing to comply with the above rules is a crime punishable by a fine of up to $100,000.Broadcasting Act, s. 31(5). Similar provisions exist in the NPPA to enable the circulation of foreign newspapers in Singapore to be restricted.NPPA, ss. 24 and 25. In February 1987, the Asian Wall Street Journal was declared to have engaged in domestic politics and its circulation was limited to 400 copies.Dow Jones Publishing Co. (Asia) Inc. v. Attorney- General [1989] 1 S.L.R.(R.) 637 at 644, para. 7, C.A. (Singapore). The newspaper's publisher, Dow Jones Publishing Co. (Asia) Inc., applied unsuccessfully to the High Court for certiorari to quash the Minister's orders. On appeal to the Court of Appeal, Dow Jones argued that the Minister had acted irrationally and misinterpreted scope of his powers under the NPPA by not considering the right to free speech protected by Article 14(1)(a). The Court dismissed the argument on the ground that Dow Jones could not rely on the Article as it only applied to Singapore citizens. Furthermore, even if Dow Jones could raise the constitutionality of the relevant provisions of the NPPA on the basis that Singapore citizens were indirectly affected by it, it was not evident that the right to free speech included the right to receive information. In any case, even if the latter argument was accepted, it might be said that the right of Singapore citizens to receive information by reading the Asian Wall Street Journal had not been impaired since 400 copies of it were still in circulation.Dow Jones, pp. 665‚Äì667, paras. 50‚Äì54. The Court interpreted the term domestic politics broadly, holding that in Singapore's context it included:Dow Jones, p. 661, para. 42. In addition to empowering the Minister to limit the circulation of foreign newspapers as described above, the NPPA generally imposes curbs on the foreign ownership of newspaper companies,NPPA, Pt. III. and requires a permit to be obtained for the publication, sale and distribution of newspapers.NPPA, Pt. IV. In a September 2011 statement, the Ministry of Information, Communications and the Arts justified the NPPA's existence, stating: \\"The various safeguards provided for in the NPPA help to ensure that the media operating in Singapore play a responsible role and that publishers are accountable for the content they publish. The safeguards also prevent local newspapers from being manipulated by foreign interests which can have a divisive effect on social cohesion. These considerations are still valid today. Journalistic freedom to report responsibly has not been compromised.\\". The Sedition Act,. Public Entertainments and Meetings Act, and Public Order Act 2009 are statutes which arguably impose restrictions on the freedom of speech and expression, as well as the freedom of assembly, in the interests of public order. The Sedition Act has been used to restrict the propagation of opinions that have a seditious tendency, which includes a tendency to promote feelings of ill-will and hostility between different races or classes of Singapore's population.Sedition Act, s. 3(1)(e). In Public Prosecutor v. Koh Song Huat Benjamin (2005),Public Prosecutor v. Koh Song Huat Benjamin [2005] SGDC 272, District Court (Singapore). the accused was convicted under the Act for posting invective and pejorative anti-Muslim remarks on a blog and a forum on the Internet; and in Public Prosecutor v. Ong Kian Cheong and another (2009),Public Prosecutor v. Ong Kian Cheong [2009] SGDC 163, D.C. (Singapore). a married couple were similarly convicted for distributing religious tracts that were considered seditious and objectionable to Muslims. The Public Entertainments and Meetings Act renders it an offence to provide public entertainment and hold meetings without a licence, and its constitutionality has been upheld before the courts in cases concerning political activities organized by opposition parties.See, for example, Jeyaretnam Joshua Benjamin v. Public Prosecutor [1989] 2 S.L.R.(R.) 419, H.C. (Singapore), and Chee Soon Juan v. Public Prosecutor [2003] 2 S.L.R.(R.) 445, H.C. (Singapore). =Restrictions on the freedom of association= The right to freedom of association guaranteed by Article 14(1)(c) is curtailed on public order grounds by the Societies Act.. The Act requires all clubs, companies, partnerships and associations of ten or more persons to be registered with the Registrar of Societies unless they are already lawfully registered under other statutes.Societies Act, s. 2 (definition of society). The Registrar may refuse to register certain specified societies if satisfied that, among other things, they are likely to be used \\"for purposes prejudicial to public peace, welfare or good order in Singapore\\"; it would be contrary to the national interest; or, if the society is a political association, its rules do not require all its members to be Singapore citizens or it is affiliated with some foreign organization that the Registrar considers contrary to the national interest.Societies Act, ss. 4(2)(b), (d) and (e). The list of specified societies includes the following:Societies Act, s. 4(1) read with the Sch., paras. 1. *A society representing, promoting any cause or interest of, or discussing an issue relating to any clan, ethnic group, nationality or religion, or a class of persons defined by reference to their gender or sexual orientation. *A political association. *A society representing people who advocate, promote or discuss any issue relating to any civil or political right, including animal rights, environmental rights and human rights. *A society discussing any matter relating to how Singapore society is governed. Any society that is not registered is deemed to be an unlawful society, and, as regards such a society, being involved in its management, being a member of it, and attending its meetings, are all offences.Societies Act, ss. 14(1)‚Äì(3). The Minister for Home Affairs also has power to order that a registered society be dissolved if it appears to him or her that, among other things, it is being used for unlawful purposes or for purposes \\"prejudicial to public peace, welfare or good order in Singapore\\".Societies Act, s. 24(1)(a). Once an order has been made, the society becomes an unlawful society.Societies Act, s. 24(3). On 14 January 1972, the Singapore Congregation of Jehovah's Witnesses was dissolved,By G.N. No. S 179/1972. the Minister stating that the existence of the society was prejudicial to public welfare and good order because its members refused to do National Service,Chan Hiang Leng Colin, p. 215, paras. 3‚Äì4. which is generally compulsory for male citizens and second-generation permanent residents. An attempt in Chan Hiang Leng Colin to challenge the ban on the grounds of freedom of religion protected by Article 15(1) of the Constitution proved unsuccessful. Morality Parliament may, under Articles 14(2)(a) and 14(2)(b) of the Constitution, rely on the ground of morality to impose restrictions on two of the constitutional freedoms embodied in Article 14: the right to freedom of speech and expression, and the right to freedom of association.Constitution, Arts. 14(1)(a) and (c). There are currently no Singaporean cases which have specifically discussed the meaning of morality. However, legislation such as the Films Act,. which establishes film censorship and classification regimes; and the Undesirable Publications Act,. under which obscene or otherwise objectionable publications may be banned, can be regarded as restrictions on free expression pursuant to this ground. In Rathinam Ramesh v. Public Prosecutor (2010),Rathinam Ramesh v. Public Prosecutor [2010] 1 S.L.R. 868, H.C. (Singapore). where the issue was the sentence that should be imposed on a person convicted of distributing uncertified films contrary to the Films Act, the High Court held that \\"the control of film distribution under the Films Act was for the purpose of maintaining public order and morality\\"Rathinam Ramesh, p. 872, para. 15, and p. 873, para. 17. and the accused had not undermined public morality since the films he had been distributing were not obscene.Rathinam Ramesh, p. 873, paras. 16 and 17. With regard to the issue of censorship, in 2003 the Censorship Review Committee said that \\"the responsibility to guide and control will have to be increasingly borne by the individual, the public, particularly parents, and the industry. While the regulator may define and regulate sensitive areas like race and religion, in the areas of morality, the responsibility will have to be devolved to the public and citizen advisory committees.\\"Para. 4 of a letter dated 10 July 2003 from Liu Thai Ker, Chairman of the Censorship Review Committee, to Dr. Lee Boon Yang, Minister for Information, Communications and the Arts, reproduced in . In response, the Ministry of Information, Communication and the Arts (MICA) stated that the Government \\"must continue to remain mindful of the concerns and values of the majority\\".. The meaning of morality is therefore dependent on the views of the majority of Singapore citizens, as expressed through public channels and citizen advisory committees. Censorship has therefore been applied to obscene content that \\"erodes moral values through pornography, deviant sexual practices, sexual violence, child pornography, bestiality, etc.\\"Working Together towards a Responsible and Vibrant Society, annex II, no. 11.1. Public morality is not a static idea, but one that evolves with societal norms and values. For example, the MICA has endorsed a \\"flexible and contextual approach for homosexual content\\",Working Together towards a Responsible and Vibrant Society, annex II, no. 12.1. and has liberalized its censorship of issues such as violence, sexual content and nudity, and coarse language in media. =Restrictions not premised on necessity or expediency= Unique to Article 14(2)(a) is an addendum stating that the right to freedom of speech and expression may be curtailed by restrictions designed to protect the privileges of Parliament, or to provide against contempt of court, defamation or incitement to any offence. The Constitution does not require Parliament to show that is necessary or expedient to restrict free speech in the interest of these grounds. Protection of the privileges of Parliament Parliament House at night, photographed in November 2007 Article 63 of the Constitution provides for the Legislature to \\"determine and regulate the privileges, immunities or powers of Parliament\\" by law, and it has done so by enacting the Parliament (Privileges, Immunities and Powers) Act. (\\"PPIPA\\"). Under the Act, it is a contempt of Parliament to perform certain acts, for instance, to insult the Speaker or any Member of Parliament (MP) coming to or going from Parliament on account of his or her conduct in Parliament or of anything done or said by him or her in Parliament;PPIPA, s. 31(c). or to publish any statement, whether in writing or otherwise, which falsely or scandalously defames, or which reflects on the character of, the Speaker or any MP touching on his or her conduct in Parliament or anything done or said by him or her in Parliament.PPIPA, s. 31(g). It is presumably not open to a person charged with one of these offences to argue that it violates the Article 14 right to freedom of speech and expression. However, there is not yet any case law addressing this provision, and thus little guidance as to how the courts are to interpret the restriction. Contempt of court =Constitutionality of the offence of scandalizing the court= Article 14(2)(a) of the Constitution provides that Parliament may restrict the right to freedom of speech and expression to provide against contempt of court. One of the more prominent uses of the court's contempt power has been for the Attorney-General to charge persons with the common law offence of scandalizing the court. The High Court case of Attorney-General v. Wain (1991)Attorney-General v. Wain [1991] 1 S.L.R.(R.) 85, H.C. (Singapore). established that by enacting section 8(1) of the (now section 7(1) of ) (\\"SCJA\\"), which states that \\"[t]he High Court and the Court of Appeal shall have power to punish for contempt of court\\", Parliament had conferred on these courts the power to act against persons that have scandalized the court. Furthermore, Article 162 could not be relied upon to require that the offence be read down to conform with the right to freedom of speech and expression.Wain, p. 102, para. 60. Article 162 states: The Court reasoned that Article 162 had no application to the SCJA as the latter was not an existing law at the date of commencement of the Constitution (that is, 9 August 1965),Constitution, Art. 2(1): \\"'commencement', used with reference to this Constitution, means 9th August 1965\\". having been enacted in 1969. However, the Court did not consider the effect of Article 4 of the Constitution on the offence. That Article states: \\"This Constitution is the supreme law of the Republic of Singapore and any law enacted by the Legislature after the commencement of this Constitution which is inconsistent with this Constitution shall, to the extent of the inconsistency, be void.\\" Subsequently, in Attorney-General v. Chee Soon Juan (2006),. the High Court held that the offence of scandalizing the court could not be regarded as unconstitutional since Article 14(2)(a) clearly empowered Parliament to restrict free speech in order to punish acts amounting to contempt of court. Parliament had done so by enacting section 7(1) of the SCJA.Chee Soon Juan, pp. 660‚Äì661, para. 29. =Constitutionality of the elements of the offence= The classic definition of a contempt by scandalizing the court was enunciated in R. v. Gray (1900)R. v. Gray [1900] 2 Q.B. 36, Divisional Court (England & Wales). by the Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales, Lord Russell of Killowen, who said: \\"Any act done or writing published calculated to bring a Court or a judge of the Court into contempt, or to lower his authority, is a contempt of Court.\\"Gray, p. 40, para. 60. Up until Attorney-General v. Shadrake (2010),Attorney-General v. Shadrake [2011] 2 S.L.R. 445, H.C. (Singapore) (\\"Shadrake (H.C.)\\"). the High Court had adopted an \\"inherent tendency\\" test to determine liability for the offence.Shadrake (H.C.), pp. 462‚Äì469, paras. 33‚Äì42. This was in contrast to the \\"real risk\\" test adopted by many other common law countries.Shadrake (H.C.), pp. 458‚Äì462, paras. 24‚Äì30. The inherent tendency test was characterized by the act or words complained of possessing an inherent tendency to interfere with the administration of justice.Wain, p. 101, para. 54, cited in Shadrake, p. 462, para. 33. Moreover, an act or statement would have such an inherent tendency if it conveyed to an average reasonable reader or viewer allegations of bias, lack of impartiality, impropriety or any wrongdoing concerning a judge (and a fortiori, a court) in the exercise of his judicial function., cited in Shadrake (H.C.), p. 465, para. 37. In Shadrake, Justice Quentin Loh suggested that the distinction between the tests was in truth illusory. He expressed the view that if it was purely a question of semantics, it would be preferable for the court to adopt the real risk test as it precisely conveys to laymen and lawyers what the law is concerned with. He stated:Shadrake (H.C.), p. 472, para. 50. Holding that \\"a publication must post a real risk of undermining public confidence in the administration of justice before it is held to be contemptuous\\", Loh J. elucidated the elements of the real risk test as follows:Shadrake (H.C.), pp. 472‚Äì473, paras. 51‚Äì53. *A real risk is not to be equated with a serious or grave risk, but merely something more than a de minimis, remote or fanciful risk. *Whether such a real risk is posed is an objective question of fact to be determined in light of all the circumstances of the case. *The law is not concerned with the effect of the impugned publication, but the potential effect on public confidence in the administration of justice. British author and former journalist Alan Shadrake attending a Reform Party rally at Speakers' Corner, Singapore, on 15 January 2011. In 2010, Shadrake was charged with scandalizing the court in his book Once a Jolly Hangman.. Counsel for the respondent had argued that the right to free speech compelled the adoption of the real risk test. However, the Court declined to consider the matter as it had already decided to adopt the test, and since full arguments had not been made on the point.Shadrake (H.C.), pp. 474‚Äì475, paras. 56 and 58. Nonetheless, Loh J. said that the courts had to define the offence \\"consistently with the words, structure and spirit of Art 14, which clearly demand some kind of balance to be struck between the freedom of speech, which is the rule, and the offence of contempt, an exception to the rule. At the very minimum, neither can be defined in such a way that renders the other otiose.\\"Shadrake (H.C.), p. 474, para. 57. He noted that the respondent's counsel had not argued that the offence is inherently unconstitutional, and that a majority of cases had concluded that the real risk test, coupled with a right of fair criticism, is a reasonable limitation on free speech.Shadrake (H.C.), p. 475, para. 58. On appeal, the Court of Appeal in Shadrake v. Attorney-General (2011)Shadrake v. Attorney-General [2011] 3 S.L.R. 778, C.A. (Singapore) (\\"Shadrake (C.A.)\\"). held that the apparent difference between the inherent tendency test and the real risk test was a \\"legal red herring\\".Shadrake (C.A.), p. 801, para. 56. However, since the inherent tendency test had caused confusion, it affirmed the High Court's ruling that the real risk test was the applicable test for scandalizing the court.Shadrake (C.A.), p. 801, para. 57. It felt that trying to elaborate on the meaning of a \\"real risk\\" was not helpful,Shadrake (C.A.), p. 792, para. 29. and that the court should simply ask itself whether, \\"having regard to the facts as well as surrounding context, a 'real risk' that public confidence in the administration of justice is ‚Äì or would be ‚Äì undermined as a result of the impugned statement?\\"Shadrake (C.A.), p. 793, para. 30 (emphasis omitted). Although fair criticism has been treated as a defence to scandalizing the court in some cases, the Court of Appeal preferred to view it as an element of liability, though it cautioned that \\"the precise characterisation of the concept of fair criticism was not fully canvassed before us ... . Accordingly, our views on this point must necessarily be taken, to that extent, to be provisional in nature.\\"Shadrake (C.A.), pp. 801‚Äì809, para. 59‚Äì80. The Court said that adopting this approach ensures that an alleged contemnor is not disadvantaged with regard to the burden of proof: \\"If the concept of fair criticism relates to liability, then the evidential burden would be on the party relying on it. The legal burden, on the other hand, would be on the Respondent to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the impugned statement does not constitute fair criticism, and that it presents a real risk of undermining public confidence in the administration of justice. If, however, the concept of fair criticism constitutes a defence, then the legal burden would shift to the alleged contemnor to show on the balance of probabilities that the impugned statement amounts to fair criticism.\\"Shadrake, pp. 808‚Äì809, para. 78. The Court approved the factors set out by the High Court in Attorney-General v. Tan Liang Joo John (2009). that are relevant in establishing that criticism of the courts is fair:Tan Liang Joo John, pp. 1139‚Äì1140, paras. 16‚Äì20, cited in Shadrake (C.A.), pp. 809‚Äì811, para. 81. *Criticism must be supported by argument and evidence. *Criticism must generally be expressed in a temperate and dispassionate manner. This allows rational debate about the issues raised, and thus may even contribute to the improvement and strengthening of the administration of justice. *Courts can take into consideration the party's attitude in court and the number of instances of condemning conduct. In Tan Liang Joo John, Justice Judith Prakash stated that this was not a closed list, and that the court is entitled to take into account all the circumstances of the case which in its view go towards showing bad faith. She also noted that English authorities impose another limit on the content of criticism ‚Äì that the acts or words in question must neither impute improper motives to nor impugn the integrity, propriety and impartiality of judges or the courts. However, she declined to follow these authorities and averred that to impose such a limit would be unnecessary and potentially over-restrictive of legitimate criticism.Tan Liang Joo John, pp. 1140‚Äì1141, paras. 20 and 23, cited in Shadrake (C.A.), p. 811, para. 81. See also p. 812, para. 84. As regards the relationship between the offence of scandalizing the court and the right to free speech, the Court of Appeal commented that:Shadrake (C.A.), p. 787, para. 17. The Court pointed out that the last mentioned point was embodied in Article 14(2) and noted that Parliament had provided the courts with jurisdiction to punish for contempt by enacting section 7(1) of the SCJA. It held that the real risk test strikes an appropriate balance between free speech and its abuse, and declined to apply the \\"clear and present danger\\" test applicable to the First Amendment to the US Constitution as free speech had gained a paramount status in the US quite different from Commonwealth jurisdictions due to the nation's unique cultural and constitutional heritage.Shadrake (C.A.), pp. 796‚Äì797, para. 41. Defamation Article 14(2)(a) of the Constitution also provides Parliament with the power to impose restrictions designed to provide against defamation. The law of defamation thus functions as a restriction on a person's right to freedom of speech. The law of defamation has its roots in the common law which existed before the enactment of the Constitution in 1965. As such, the courts must take Article 162 of the Constitution into consideration when deciding whether the common law tort of defamation offends the fundamental liberty of freedom of speech and expression. The Article provides that all existing laws shall continue in force after the commencement of the Constitution subject to \\"modifications, adaptations, qualifications and exceptions as may be necessary to bring them into conformity\\" with the Constitution of Singapore. However, in Review Publishing, the Court of Appeal held that the common law of defamation, as modified by the Defamation Act,. restricts the right to free speech. The appellants in that case pointed out that the Defamation Ordinance 1960,. which presupposed the existence of the common law of defamation, had been enacted before the 1963 Constitution of the State of Singapore.Brought into force by the Sabah, Sarawak and Singapore (State Constitutions) Order in Council 1963 (S.I. 1963 No. 1493). Thus, it could not have been a law enacted to derogate from the right to free speech guaranteed by Article 10(1)(a) of the Federal Constitution of Malaysia, which became applicable to Singapore when it became a state of the Federation of Malaysia on 16 September 1963.Review Publishing, p. 163, para. 238(f). The Court disagreed, holding that Article 105(1) of the 1963 State Constitution, which was the predecessor of Article 162, had the effect of re-enacting all laws existing as at 16 September 1963, including the Defamation Ordinance. Thus Article 105(1) itself was an express restriction on the right to free speech.Review Publishing, p. 168, para. 250. If this was not the case, then when the 1963 State Constitution came into force all laws which restricted Article 10(1) of the Federal Constitution would have become unconstitutional, a result which the Court regarded as an \\"astonishing conclusion\\".Review Publishing, p. 169, para. 251. =Defence of qualified privilege and the public figure doctrine= Article 14 of the Constitution has been raised as a point of contention in relation to the defence of qualified privilege. The Court of Appeal has discussed the applicability of Article 14 in two cases concerning prominent government figures. In a 1992 case in which Opposition MP Joshua Benjamin Jeyaretnam (pictured here in November 2005) was sued for defamation by the Senior Minister (and former Prime Minister) Lee Kuan Yew, the Court of Appeal held that Jeyaretnam could not rely on a public figure defence In Jeyaratnam Joshua Benjamin v. Lee Kuan Yew (1992),Jeyaretnam Joshua Benjamin v. Lee Kuan Yew [1992] 1 S.L.R.(R.) 791, C.A. (Singapore), archived from the original on 24 July 2011. Justice L.P. Thean, when delivering the judgment of the court, held that \\"[p]ersons holding public office or politicians ... are equally entitled to have their reputations protected as those of any other persons\\".Jeyaretnam, p. 818, para. 62. In this case, counsel for the appellant argued that \\"qualified privilege attaches to defamatory publications concerning public officials (or candidates for a public office) relating to their official conduct or the performance of their public duties by those who have an honest and legitimate interest in the matter to those who have a corresponding and legitimate interest (whether as electors or as citizens potentially affected by the conduct of public officials)\\".Jeyaretnam, p. 810, para. 44. The fact that the statements were made in a political rally during the run-up to elections meant that the requirement of a legitimate interest was met. Lingens v. Austria (1986). was relied upon in support of the premise that \\"the limits of acceptable criticism are accordingly wider as regards a politician as such than as regards a private individual\\".Lingens, p. 419, para. 42, cited in Jeyaretnam, p. 814, para. 53. In Lingens, the European Court of Human Rights was of the opinion that a politician \\"inevitably and knowingly lays himself open to close scrutiny of his every word and deed by both journalists and the public at large, and he must consequently display a greater degree of tolerance\\". The reasoning of the European Court was in line with the public figure doctrine enunciated in New York Times Co. v. Sullivan (1964),New York Times Co. v. Sullivan , Supreme Court (United States). where the United States Supreme Court decided in favour of the defendant newspaper, making it one of the key decisions supporting the freedom of the press. However, the Singapore Court of Appeal dismissed the applicability of both cases on the ground that the terms of Article 14 of the Constitution differ materially from Article 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights, which was relied upon by the court in Lingens; as well as the First Amendment and the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, which were relied upon by the court in New York Times. The public figure doctrine was thus expressly rejected by the Court. Thean J. said: \\"Such criticisms or attacks must, in our opinion, respect the bounds set by the law of defamation, and we do not accept that the publication of false and defamatory allegations, even in the absence of actual malice on the part of the publisher, should be allowed to pass with impunity.\\" To further rebut the presumption that the circumstances of a general election are sufficient to give rise to an occasion of privilege, the Court also relied on section 14 of the Defamation Act which, at the time, provided thus: The court was unwilling to extend the traditional defence of qualified privilege as it was of the opinion that Parliament's intention in enacting section 14 was clear: it is wholly untenable that the speech made at an election rally is privileged when the same speech published by or on behalf of a candidate for the election is not.Jeyaretnam, pp. 822‚Äì823, paras. 71‚Äì72. The Court of Appeal's reasoning in Jeyaretnam has been the subject of academic criticism. Michael Hor has criticized the distinction drawn by the Court between Article 14 of the Constitution and its American and European counterparts as overly literal.. The current interpretation of the law gives the legislature an unfettered discretion in limiting freedom of speech in Singapore through the enactment and amendment of relevant legislation. Hor opines that:Hor, p. 549. Hor has also said that the Court's approach in Jeyaretnam fails to provide adequate safeguards to account for future politicians and holders of public office who may be less than honourable.Hor, p. 555. Moreover, Singapore courts should not start with the assumption that the common law is necessarily constitutional, as this would be tantamount to \\"putting the cart before the horse\\". Rather, the Constitution ought to be interpreted consistently with the common law.Hor, p. 556. =Defence of responsible journalism= In Review Publishing, Chief Justice Chan Sek Keong, delivering judgment on behalf of the Court of Appeal, declined to infer into the common law of Singapore the defence of responsible journalism, or \\"Reynolds privilege\\", developed by the House of Lords in Reynolds v. Times Newspapers Ltd. (1999),. at least where non-Singapore citizens who have been sued for defamation are seeking to rely on it. This was because the defence was not a natural development of common law principles but had been impelled by the right to freedom of expression protected by Article 10 of the European Convention. The Reynolds privilege could only be adopted in Singapore on the basis of the right to free speech guaranteed by Article 14(1)(a) of the Constitution. However, as the appellants were not Singapore citizens, they could not rely on this provision.Review Publishing, pp. 173‚Äì175, paras. 260‚Äì264; . The Court then discussed, on an obiter basis, the applicability of the Reynolds privilege to Singapore citizens. It held that the key question is whether or not, in the context of publication of matters of public interest, the rationale behind the Reynolds privilege ought to apply such that constitutional free speech is the rule and restrictions on this right are the exception. In considering the factors relevant to the key question, Chan C.J. stated that whilst the court has the power to dictate the direction of the common law of defamation as adopted upon the enactment of the Constitution, Parliament still has overriding powers to limit the freedom of speech and expression where defamatory publications and statements are made:Review Publishing, p. 176, para. 270. Secondly, when striking a balance between freedom of expression and the protection of reputation, the court will need to make a value judgment that is dependent on local political and social conditions. The Court said that the following factors were relevant to the making of this value judgment:Review Publishing, pp. 177‚Äì178, paras. 271‚Äì272. *In its opinion, the balance between constitutional free speech and protection of reputation that has been struck by the current law of defamation in Singapore is appropriate in the circumstances of the present day. *Singapore law does not recognize journalistic material that relates to matters of public interest as having any particular importance, and \\"there is no room in our political context for the media to engage in investigative journalism which carries with it a political agenda\\".Review Publishing, p. 177, para. 272. *Honesty and integrity in public discourse on matters of public interest, particularly the way the country is governed, are greatly emphasized by the political culture in Singapore. Finally, the Court expressed the view that if free speech is to be favoured over the protection of reputation in applying a Reynolds-type defence, another issue that will have to be considered is what balance should be struck between the two competing interests. In this connection, Chan C.J. said that the court would have to decide whether freedom of expression is to be given preference over the protection of reputation, whether it is a fundamental right that trumps the protection of reputation unless it is shown that the defamatory statement was made maliciously, or whether it is co-equal with the protection of reputation.Review Publishing, pp. 183‚Äì184, paras. 286‚Äì289. The Chief Justice also suggested that the rationale in the Reynolds case might be given effect by continuing to find the defendant liable for defamation but reducing the amount of damages payable depending on how much care he or she took to ensure the accuracy of the information published. He noted: \\"There is no reason why a defendant who has published a defamatory statement should be allowed to get off scot-free for injuring the plaintiff's reputation simply because he has satisfied the 'responsible journalism' test.\\"Review Publishing, pp. 187‚Äì188, para. 297; Chan, \\"Singapore Academy of Law Conference 2011\\", p. 7, para. 15. Incitement to any offence Article 14(2)(a) of the Constitution provides that the right to freedom of speech and expression may be restricted to provide against incitement to any offence. This ground has not yet been considered in a Singapore case. A number of statutory provisions prohibit incitement. Under section 107(a) of the Penal Code,. a person is said to abet the doing of a thing if he or she instigates someone to do that thing. If a person abets an offence, and as a result the act abetted is committed, the person is to be punished with the punishment provided for the offence.Penal Code, s. 109. This provision applies when the Penal Code has not made any express provision for the punishment of such abetment: ibid. If the offence is not committed due to the abetment, and it is punishable by imprisonment, the abettor is to be imprisoned for up to a quarter of the maximum jail term of the offence, or may receive a fine, or both. If either the abettor or the person abetted is a public servant whose duty it was to prevent the offence from happening, the abettor may be imprisoned for up to half of the maximum jail term of the offence, or may be fined, or receive both penalties.Penal Code, s. 116. However, if the offence abetted but not committed is punishable with death or life imprisonment, the abettor is liable to a penalty of up to seven years' imprisonment, a fine, or both. If any hurt is caused as a result of the abetment, the abettor may be jailed up to 14 years and must also be fined.Penal Code, s. 115. Under section 505(c) of the Penal Code, it is an offence to make, publish or circulate any statement, rumour or report in written, electronic or other media with an intent to incite, or which is likely to incite, any class or community of persons to commit any offence against any other class or community of persons. The penalty is imprisonment for up to three years, a fine, or both. No offence is committed if the person who made, published or circulated the statement had reasonable grounds for believing it was true, and did not intend to incite one community against another. Laws relating to labour or education Article 14(3) provides that the right to form associations may also be restricted by any law relating to labour or education. The Trade Unions Act. regulates labour organizations, while schools are generally required to be registered under either the Education Act. or the Private Education Act.. Under the Education Act, it is an offence for pupils or other persons to assemble on the premises of a school the registration of which has been cancelled.Education Act, s. 50. Statutes governing universities provide that student bodies created pursuant to a university's constituent documents must be registered under the Societies Act, s. 10; , s. 10; , s. 8; , s. 10. unless the Minister for Home Affairs has exempted such bodies.As of 30 November 2011, the Minister for Home Affairs had issued the following exemption orders for specified student associations and their constituent bodies: the , the , and the . =Other restrictions= Under Article 149(1) of the Constitution, if an Act recites that action has been taken or threatened by any substantial body of persons inside or outside Singapore: *to cause, or to cause a substantial number of citizens to fear, organized violence against persons or property; *to excite disaffection against the President or the Government; *to promote feelings of ill-will and hostility between different races or other classes of the population likely to cause violence; *to procure the alteration, otherwise than by lawful means, of anything by law established; or *which is prejudicial to the security of Singapore, any provision of that law designed to stop or prevent that action or any amendment to that law is valid even if it is inconsistent with specified fundamental liberties, including the rights to freedom of speech, assembly and association guaranteed by Article 14. Article 149 thus shields the Internal Security Act. from unconstitutionality. Among other things, the Act authorizes detention without trial to prevent persons from acting in a manner prejudicial to Singapore's security or the maintenance of public order or essential services. Other provisions Section 5 of the Parliament (Privileges, Immunities and Powers) Act, enacted pursuant to Article 63 of the Constitution, specifically provides for freedom of expression in Parliament in the following terms: This provision is based on one of the rights stated in the English Bill of Rights 1689 which reads: \\"[T]he of Speech and Debates or Proceedings in ought not to be impeached or questioned in any Court or Place out of .\\" Notes References =Cases= *Dow Jones Publishing Co.

Attorney-General is a 2011 judgment of the Court of Appeal of Singapore that clarified the law relating to the offence of scandalizing the court. Alan Shadrake, the author of the book Once a Jolly Hangman: Singapore Justice in the Dock (2010), was charged with contempt of court by way of scandalizing the court. The Prosecution alleged that certain passages in his book asserted that the Singapore judiciary lacks independence, succumbs to political and economic pressure, and takes a person's position in society into account when sentencing; and that it is the method by which Singapore's ruling party, the People's Action Party, stifles political dissent in Singapore. In the High Court, Justice Quentin Loh made significant changes to the law when he rejected the use of the long-standing \\"inherent tendency\\" test that had been applied to establish the actus reus of the offence, and instead adopted a \\"real risk\\" test. This allows a court to take into consideration the circumstances surrounding the uttering or publication of the impugned words and to only hold someone liable if that person has created a real risk in the circumstances in which the impugned words were communicated. In addition, he ruled that should an impugned statement be found to have scandalized the court, the only applicable defence to contempt of court would be if the statement amounted to \\"fair criticism\\". In doing so, he rejected justification and fair comment as defences. Applying the real risk test, Justice Loh found that 11 out of 14 impugned statements were contemptuous and that the defence of fair criticism did not apply to any of the statements. The High Court thus found Shadrake guilty of the offence of contempt by way of scandalizing the court and sentenced him to six weeks' imprisonment and a fine of S$20,000. Upon appeal, the Court of Appeal, while upholding the use of the real risk test, made several changes to the way the test is to be applied. In addition, the Court clarified that fair criticism is an element that determines whether there is liability, rather than operates as a defence. The Court, when applying its modified test, found that only nine of the 14 statements were contemptuous. It upheld the sentence passed by the High Court. Both the High Court and Court of Appeal judgments explored the rationale for the law against contempt of court and its relation with freedom of speech, and emphasized the importance of public confidence in the administration of justice which can be impugned by contempt of court. Facts British journalist Alan Shadrake at a Reform Party rally at Speakers' Corner, Singapore, on 15 January 2011 In 2010, British investigative journalist Alan Shadrake was charged in Singapore with the offence of scandalizing the court, a type of contempt of court. The Attorney-General alleged that he had scandalized the court by attacking its reputation in his 2010 book Once a Jolly Hangman: Singapore Justice in the Dock.. Fourteen statements of varying lengths from the book were purported to have alleged that the Singapore judiciary had succumbed to political and economic pressures when adjudicating matters concerning the death penalty, is biased against the economically and educationally disadvantaged, and is a tool of the ruling People's Action Party to stifle dissent within the political domain in Singapore. (\\"Shadrake (H.C.)\\"). Contempt of court by scandalizing the court, also known as \\"scandalizing contempt\\", may be defined as \\"[a]ny act done or writing published calculated to bring a Court or a judge of the Court into contempt, or to lower his authority\\".R. v. Gray [1900] 2 Q.B. 36 at 40, High Court (Queen's Bench) (England & Wales) per Lord Russell, the Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales, cited in Shadrake (H.C.), p. 458, para. 22. The power to punish for contempt of court is vested in the judiciary by virtue of section 7(1) of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act.. (\\"Shadrake (C.A.)\\"). While contempt of court is a criminal offence, applications for committal are made under Order 52 of the Rules of Court,. which is a civil procedure. High Court decision =Issues before the High Court= The legal issues that were dealt with by the High Court were the following: (1) the proper test to be applied for determining whether scandalizing contempt was made out, and, specifically, whether the \\"inherent tendency\\" test or the \\"real risk\\" test should be applied to determine liability; (2) the defences available for the offence of scandalizing contempt; and (3) the application of the appropriate legal principles to the 14 impugned statements.Shadrake (H.C.), p. 458, para. 21; and p. 475, para. 59.Shadrake (H.C.), pp. 484‚Äì504, paras. 78‚Äì136. =Holding of the High Court= In a judgment dated 3 November 2010, the High Court rejected the long-standing inherent tendency test and instead adopted the real risk test. It stated that the only available defence to scandalizing contempt was fair criticism, and explicitly rejected the common law defences of fair comment and justification applicable to the law of defamation.Shadrake (H.C.), pp. 483‚Äì484, para. 77. Upon the application of the real risk test, 11 out of the 14 impugned statements were found to be contemptuous. Rationale for law of contempt of court Justice Quentin Loh revisited the rationale for the law of scandalizing the court. He examined cases from other jurisdictions to outline the raison d'√™tre of the offence, including Attorney General v. Times Newspapers Ltd. (1973)Attorney General v. Times Newspapers Ltd. [1974] 1 A.C. 273 at 307, House of Lords (UK). by the House of Lords of the United Kingdom, Solicitor-General v. Radio Avon Ltd. (1977)Solicitor- General v. Radio Avon Ltd. [1978] 1 N.Z.L.R. 225 at 230, Court of Appeal (NZ). by the Court of Appeal of New Zealand, Gallagher v. Durack (1983). by the High Court of Australia, and Secretary for Justice v. Oriental Press Group Ltd. (1998)Secretary for Justice v. Oriental Press Group Ltd. [1998] HKCFI 564, [1998] H.K.C. 627 at para. 48, Court of First Instance (Hong Kong). by the Court of First Instance of Hong Kong. These cases identified the protection of public confidence in the administration of justice as the aim of the offence of scandalizing contempt.Shadrake (H.C.), pp. 453‚Äì456, paras. 7‚Äì16. Justice Loh, referring to Judge of Appeal Andrew Phang Boon Leong's dicta in Pertamina Energy Trading Ltd. v. Karaha Bodas Co. LLC (2007),. also clarified that the aim of the law of contempt of court is not to protect the dignity of judges. Rather, he emphasized the symbiotic relationship between the courts and the public ‚Äì the public relies on the courts to administer justice, and the courts rely on the public for confidence in them. He hinted that the court's role in maintaining such public confidence was imputed in the common law, holding that \\"[i]t is ... an axiom of the common law that justice should not only be done, but should manifestly and undoubtedly be seen to be done\\".Shadrake (H.C.), p. 456, para. 16. The axiom is from R. v. Sussex Justices, ex parte McCarthy [1924] 1 K.B. 256 at 259, Divisional Court (England and Wales). He also recognized that a balance must be struck between \\"ensuring that public confidence does not falter as a result of such attacks\\" and not \\"unduly restricting public discussion on the administration of justice\\".Shadrake (H.C.), p. 457, para. 19. Rejection of the inherent tendency test The prevailing position in Singapore for liability for scandalizing contempt prior to Shadrake was the inherent tendency test. This test required an evaluation of whether the comments made had \\"the inherent tendency to interfere with the administration of justice\\",Attorney-General v. Wain [1991] 1 S.L.R.(R.) 85 at 101, para. 54, H.C. (Singapore), cited in Shadrake (H.C.), p. 462, para. 33. which had to be proved beyond reasonable doubt. The test, first articulated in Attorney-General v. Wain (1991), was affirmed in Attorney-General v. Hertzberg (2009).. There was no requirement to prove intent on the respondent's part to interfere with the administration of justice under this test. Intent was only a consideration at the sentencing stage.. The inherent tendency test theoretically has a lower threshold than the real risk test, thereby causing persons who are charged with scandalizing contempt to be convicted for the offence with greater ease. In Shadrake, Justice Loh identified two problems with the inherent tendency test as it had been set out in Wain. First, the High Court had said that the justification for scandalizing contempt was the prevention of interference with the administration of justice as opposed to protecting public confidence in the administration of justice. The former is the concern of sub judice contempt ‚Äì that is, contempt relating to a case that is currently under consideration by a court ‚Äì while it is the latter that is concerned with scandalizing contempt. Secondly, such a test indicates that the words in the impugned publication or speech are to be looked at alone. This has the effect of ignoring the circumstances surrounding the utterance or publication of the words, and is excessively harsh.Shadrake (H.C.), pp. 462‚Äì463, para. 33. Adoption of the real risk test The High Court examined the law in various Commonwealth jurisdictions, noting that the test used for determining whether a person is guilty of scandalizing contempt is the real risk test. Under this test, the threshold for liability is \\"a real risk, as opposed to a remote possibility\\".R. v. Duffy, ex parte Nash [1960] 2 Q.B. 188 at 200, cited in Times Newspapers, pp. 298‚Äì299, and in Shadrake (H.C.), p. 459, para. 25. The Court also noted reservations that the Hong Kong Court of First Instance had brought up in implementing the real risk test. First, the test should be given its ordinary meaning ‚Äì a real risk does not mean that it is more probable than not to occur, but instead means \\"a good chance as opposed to a mere possibility\\". Secondly, the impugned words must relate \\"to the section of the public whose confidence in the administration of justice must be affected\\".Secretary of Justice v. Oriental Press Group, para. 55. Justice Loh recognized that the difference between the inherent tendency and real risk tests is not a matter of semantics. He opined that the inherent tendency formula is contentious because the literal meaning of inherent tendency would \\"obscure the fact that a contextual analysis is actually required.\\" To unambiguously exclude statements which lack the potential effect of reducing public confidence in the administration of justice, Justice Loh thus adopted the real risk test, thus departing from the inherent tendency test used in earlier Singapore cases.Shadrake (H.C.), p. 471, para. 50; . He also emphasized several aspects of the test:Shadrake (H.C.), pp. 472‚Äì473, paras. 51‚Äì54. *A real risk is \\"something more than a de minimis, remote or fanciful risk. It must have substance, but need not be substantial.\\"Shadrake (H.C.), p. 472, para. 51. Thus, a small likelihood would also be considered a real risk. *Whether a real risk to confidence in the administration of justice was posed is a question of fact to be determined objectively, taking all the circumstances of the case into consideration. This includes factors such as the person making the statement, the nature of the statement itself, how widely it has been published, and \\"local conditions\\" such as the size of Singapore and the multiracial and multi-religious make-up of its populace. Local conditions may also mean that since those who come into contact with the impugned publication or words may not be objective reasonable persons, the court must be open to take reference from such affected groups, instead of the objective reasonable man. In addition, the Court also stated that the fact that judges are the sole arbiters of fact and law must also be taken into account when assessing the impugned statement. *The focus of the real risk test is whether there is a real risk to public confidence in the administration of justice, and neither the effect on the judge hearing the application for committal, nor whether a judge is personally offended by the publication. The requirement for such a real risk, \\"while very wide, is not illusory\\". Here, Justice Loh referred to a hypothetical situation mentioned in Hertzberg and opined as follows: \\"[I]f rants made at a dinner party are shown to have been ignored, I cannot see that they would pose a real risk to public confidence in the administration of justice\\".Shadrake (H.C.), p. 473, para. 54. Defences Singapore Democratic Party Secretary-General Chee Soon Juan speaking at a forum against capital punishment in November 2005. In a 2006 scandalizing contempt case against him, the High Court rejected justification and fair comment as applicable defences. Fair criticism was singled out as the only applicable defence available in the law of contempt.Shadrake (H.C.), p. 483, para. 77. As the defamation defences of justification and fair comment were viewed as inappropriate in protecting the court from attacks, the High Court declined to recognise them as valid defences to scandalizing contempt.Shadrake (H.C.), pp. 479 and 482, paras. 69 and 74. Adopting the reasoning in Attorney-General v. Chee Soon Juan,. the Court held that the defences of justification and fair comment in the law of defamation were not available in the law of contempt because of the overriding interest in protecting the public's confidence in the administration of justice, particularly when accusations against a judge's impartiality are mounted. Allowing the defence of fair comment would expose the courts to any belief published in good faith and not for an ulterior motive, even though it may be unreasonable. Similarly, the defence of justification would give malicious parties an added opportunity to subject the dignity of the courts to more attacks.Shadrake (H.C.), p. 475, para. 60. The Court also noted that in Hertzberg, the purposes of contempt and defamation law were distinguished: \\"the law of contempt ... is concerned with the protection of the administration of justice and is grounded in public interest, while the law of defamation is concerned with the protection of a private individual's reputation\\".Shadrake (H.C.), p. 476, para. 61, citing Hertzberg, p. 1120, para. 23. The Court affirmed and elaborated on the view in Tan Liang Joo John, accepting that fair criticism does not amount to contempt of court. The burden of proof lies with the defendant to show that he was acting within his right of fair criticism.Shadrake (H.C.), pp. 479 and 483, paras. 70 and 76‚Äì77. The elements of the defence are as follows:Shadrake (H.C.), pp. 481‚Äì483, paras. 72‚Äì76. *There should be some objective basis for the allegation made and it must be stated together with the criticism so that the readers may be able to evaluate the merits of the allegations. Proof to support the criticism is not necessary, merely some rational basis for it would be sufficient. *The person must genuinely believe in the truth of the criticism made in good faith, which necessitates that the person must know the factual basis for his criticism before the allegation is made. *While outspoken language is acceptable, abusive, intemperate or outrageous language is not. The requirement for respectfulness must be balanced by the fact that \\"the law in this area applies to everyone and not just those who are bound by the rules of court decorum. ... [I]t would not be reasonable to expect every person to adopt the refined language of scholarly discourse or court address.\\"Shadrake (H.C.), p. 482, para. 75. *There is no limit to the kind of criticism which can be made against the court, subject to the above three criteria being met. People who genuinely believe that the court is partial and corrupt and have a rational basis for this belief should be able to say so without fear of being held in contempt. There is a powerful public interest that has been applied time and again in Singapore of exposing and rooting out impropriety and corruption on the part of those who hold public office, wherever or whoever they may be. High Court's ruling on the impugned statements The High Court individually examined the 14 statements impugned by the Attorney-General to determine whether some or all of them, contextually considered, posed a real risk to public confidence in the administration of justice. It also considered whether the statements were made with rational bases and/or in good faith so as to entitle Shadrake to claim fair criticism. In the end, the Court found that three of the statements were not contemptuous as they did not unambiguously refer to the courts. However, the remaining 11 statements were found to be in contempt as they had a real risk of reducing public confidence in the administration of justice in Singapore. Justice Loh put it thus:Shadrake (H.C.), p. 504, para. 136.Chan, p. 197. The Court held that Shadrake could not rely on the defence of fair criticism as the statements were published \\"without any rational basis, or with reckless disregard as to their truth or falsehood ... [and] do not fall to be protected by the defence of fair criticism\\".Shadrake (H.C.), p. 503, para. 134. In a postscript, Justice Loh affirmed that the judiciary's interest is not in stifling public debate on matters of public interest which includes the conduct of judges. In fact, they are obliged to protect the freedom of speech guaranteed to citizens. Nevertheless, he held that there are limits on such debate in order to ensure that public confidence in the administration of justice is upheld.Shadrake (H.C.), p. 504, para. 139. =Constitutional considerations in the High Court decision= Counsel for the defendant asserted that Article 14 of the Constitution of Singapore compelled the judge to adopt the real risk test.Shadrake (H.C.), p. 464, para. 56. The relevant portions of the Article read as follows: Article 14 does not define the offence of contempt and hence by necessary implication it is left to the courts to define it. Justice Loh stated that, in defining the offence, judges must be cognizant that the definition must be circumscribed by Article 14, to ensure a balance between the freedom of speech and the offence. Neither can be defined in a way that renders the other otiose.Shadrake (H.C.), p. 464, para. 57. Justice Loh went on to state that despite numerous references to constitutional authorities in other jurisdictions, the defendant's counsel had not directly addressed the issue of how Article 14 compelled the adoption of the real risk test. Thus, he had to \\"decline to enter into constitutional exposition\\". However, he noted that counsel had not submitted that the offence of scandalizing contempt itself was unconstitutional, and that cases from other jurisdictions had held that the real risk test, together with the fair criticism defence, operated as a reasonable restriction on free speech.Shadrake (H.C.), pp. 474‚Äì475, para. 58. =Aftermath of the High Court decision= On 16 November 2010, Shadrake was sentenced to imprisonment for six weeks and fined S$20,000,. at that time the heaviest punishment handed down in Singapore for scandalizing contempt. Amnesty International decried the sentence as a \\"sharp blow to freedom of expression\\" and stated that Singapore had drawn even greater global attention to its lack of respect for free speech.. A statement on the website of the British High Commission in Singapore, issued by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office in London, expressed dismay at Shadrake's sentence.. Justice Loh also created a buzz in legal circles by departing from the inherent tendency test and instead favouring the real risk test. According to lawyers who had studied such cases, what the judge did was significant because the real risk formula is clearer, even though he had defined it broadly. Under his definition, a statement with even a small risk of undermining public confidence in the courts would be found to be in contempt. The use of the real risk test is also significant as it comes at a time when the Government is planning to codify the law on contempt.. Court of Appeal decision =Issues before the Court of Appeal= Shadrake appealed the High Court's judgment to the Court of Appeal, raising the following issues:Shadrake (C.A.), p. 786, para. 12. *The judge had erred in defining the content of the real risk test for liability for scandalizing contempt. *The judge had erred in his interpretation of the impugned statements. *The sentence meted out by the judge was manifestly excessive. =Holding of the Court of Appeal= Principle behind contempt of court and constitutional considerations The Court of Appeal's judgment was rendered on 27 May 2011 by Judge of Appeal Andrew Phang. Affirming the High Court's decision, the Court of Appeal held that the purpose of the law on scandalizing contempt was to prevent erosion public confidence in the administration of justice, not the protection of the dignity of judges. The Court further affirmed that scandalizing contempt was a public injury and not a private tort.Shadrake (C.A.), p. 801, para. 21. The Court also observed that the law on contempt of court operated against the broader legal canvas of the right to freedom of speech that is embodied within Article 14 of the Constitution as well as the common law. There is a need for balance: while the right to freedom of speech is not absolute, the law on contempt of court should also not unduly infringe the right.Shadrake (C.A.), p. 787, para. 17; . Test for liability The Court of Appeal affirmed that the mens rea or mental element for liability was the intentional publication of the allegedly contemptuous statement.Shadrake (C.A.), p. 789, para. 23; Chan, p. 202. The Court then focused on the actus reus of the offence, and considered the legal principles for identifying the suitable test for liability for scandalizing contempt. In particular, the Court detailed the contents of the real risk test, the clear and present danger test, and the inherent tendency test. It held that the real risk test was the applicable test for scandalizing contempt in Singapore.Shadrake (C.A.), p. 801, para. 57. =Real risk test= The Court of Appeal held that the test for liability for scandalizing contempt is whether there is a real risk that the impugned statement has undermined ‚Äì or might undermine ‚Äì public confidence in the administration of justice.Shadrake (C.A.), p. 795, para. 36. It avoided a detailed elaboration of the test because it opined that the test demonstrated its value in application. On this point, the Court disagreed with the High Court's reference to \\"a small likelihood\\" of shaking public confidence in the administration of justice to describe a situation where no contempt was committed. It felt that such an instance would involve a marginal case of contempt that might not merit the initiation of contempt proceedings in the first place.Shadrake (C.A.), p. 793, para. 30; Chan, pp. 199‚Äì200; Yeo & Liang, pp. 28‚Äì29. Gary Chan has \\"warmly welcomed\\" the Court's confirmation that the real risk test applies in Singapore as this signals \\"a more liberal attitude towards the alleged contemnor in cases of scandalising contempt\\".Chan, p. 206. A composite map of Singapore and its islands, published by the Surveyor General of the Federated Malay States and Straits Settlements in 1924. The Court of Appeal held in the Shadrake case that Singapore's small physical size () is not a justification for the real risk test. The Court then proceeded to make several clarifications regarding the test. First, in determining whether there was a real risk, the court has to make an objective decision based on the effect of the impugned statement on an ordinary reasonable person. The Court of Appeal disagreed with the High Court by holding that the concept of \\"the public\\" does not differ according to different factual matrices. However, the court should not substitute its own subjective view for that of the public. The factual matrices of each case are relevant as the backdrop against which to ascertain whether or not public confidence in the administration of justice has been undermined.Shadrake (C.A.), pp. 793‚Äì794, paras. 32‚Äì34; Chan, pp. 200‚Äì201; Yeo & Liang, p. 29. Gary Chan has commented that if a statement is only made to a small group of people, the confidence of the public at large in the administration of justice may not be shaken. Also, if the members of the group have some particular characteristic in common (for example, they are all lawyers or judges), an ordinary reasonable person's view as to the effect of the statement may not reflect the views of the group's members. Chan suggests a more appropriate test is that \\"the assessment should be made by the average reasonable person amongst the persons who were likely to become aware of the publication\\".Chan, pp. 201‚Äì202. Secondly, the Court discounted the effect of the small physical size of Singapore as a justification for the real risk test. With the advent of the technological age and the Internet, information can be disseminated quickly and widely regardless of the geographical size of a particular jurisdiction. The Court also regarded the fact that judges in Singapore are the sole arbiters of fact and law as a neutral factor in such cases.Shadrake (C.A.), p. 793, para. 31. Thirdly, the Court of Appeal cautioned that in applying the real risk test, the court must avoid either extreme on the legal spectrum. One extreme is finding contempt where there is only a remote or fanciful possibility that public confidence in the administration of justice is undermined, while the other is finding contempt only in the most serious situations. =Clear and present danger test= With regard to the latter extreme, the Court of Appeal held that the concept of a real risk should not be equated with the concept of a clear and present danger as the two concepts have different meanings. The concept of a clear and present danger is a more stringent standard compared to the concept of a real risk. The latter encompasses the former but not vice versa.Shadrake (C.A.), p. 796, paras. 38‚Äì39. The Court proceeded to reject the clear and present danger test for the following reasons. To begin with, the test is linked to the United States' unique culture and constitutional position on freedom of speech, which does not represent the position in most Commonwealth jurisdictions and Singapore. In particular, the First Amendment to the United States Constitution is quite different from the corresponding provisions in the respective constitutions of Commonwealth jurisdictions. The Court cautioned that the United States approach should not be followed as it could result in possible abuse and negation of the right itself. Furthermore, the Court emphasized that the real risk test is already a weighty test which pays the correct attention to the balance between the right to freedom of speech and the possibility of its abuse.Shadrake (C.A.), p. 796, paras. 40‚Äì41; Chan, p. 200; Yeo & Liang, pp. 29‚Äì30. =Inherent tendency test= The final test considered by the Court of Appeal was the inherent tendency test. This test entailed examining whether the words complained of have an inherent tendency to interfere with the administration of justice. Although the inherent tendency test was subsequently referred to in several High Court decisions,See Chee Soon Juan, Hertzberg and Tan Liang Joo John. the Court of Appeal opined that there was no clear authority for the test. Further, the Court noted that the inherent tendency test had been ambiguously articulated in Wain as that case had not considered the precise relationship between the concepts of inherent tendency and real risk. Consequently, in subsequent cases the High Court had interpreted the concepts as distinct tests. The Court of Appeal held, however, that a holistic reading of Wain suggests that the tests are not different, given that they both evaluate the impact of statements on the public confidence in the administration of justice within the context of the case at hand.Shadrake (C.A.), p. 800, paras. 52 and 56. The Court concluded that the distinction between the inherent tendency test and the real risk test therefore amounted to nothing more than a \\"legal red herring\\". However, in order to avoid controversy and misunderstanding, the Court held that the real risk test is to be preferred because it conveys clearly the legal test to layperson and lawyer alike. Fair criticism The Court of Appeal stated that case law was ambiguous as to whether the concept of fair criticism was a separate defence or an issue of liability forming an integral part of the process of analysis. In elaboration, the Court undertook an extensive survey of the Commonwealth case law,For instance, Gray, R v. Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis, ex parte Blackburn (No. 2) [1968] 2 Q.B. 150, H.C. (Q.B.) (England & Wales), and . treatises on the law of contempt,; and . the reports of various law commissions and committees,Such as ; and . and legislation.Contempt of Courts Act 1971 (No. 70 of 1971) (India), s. 5, archived from the original on 8 October 2010.Shadrake (C.A.), pp. 801‚Äì808, paras. 59‚Äì77. The Court of Appeal recognized that the approach adopted towards fair criticism has a practical implication on the evidential burden. If fair criticism goes towards liability, the burden would be on the party alleging the contempt to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the statement is not fair criticism and poses a real risk of undermining public confidence in the administration of justice. Conversely, if fair criticism is a defence to an allegation of contempt, the burden would be on the alleged contemnor to show on a balance of probabilities that the statement amounts to fair criticism.Shadrake (C.A.), pp. 808‚Äì809, para. 78. Given the ambiguity in the legal sources and the policy decision involved, the Court took the view that Parliament would be in a better position to create a defence to contempt of court. Until Parliament did so, however, it was for the court to determine the operation of fair criticism at common law. On this point, the Court held that the concept of fair criticism should go towards liability. Due to the quasi-criminal nature of scandalizing contempt, the alleged contemnor should not be disadvantaged by having the evidential burden placed on him or her. The Court of Appeal concluded with a caveat that the approach adopted was only provisional in nature, since the characterisation of fair criticism was not fully canvassed before it.Shadrake (C.A.), p. 809, paras. 79‚Äì80; Chan, pp. 203‚Äì204; Yep & Liang, p. 30. Chan has said that requiring the Prosecution to prove the absence of fair criticism is to be \\"commended for enhancing the protection of the alleged contemnor‚Äôs right of free speech\\". In approaching the concept of fair criticism going towards liability for contempt of court, the Court of Appeal held that the various non-exhaustive factors set out in Tan Liang Joo John were helpful in deciding whether the contemnor was liable for scandalizing contempt. These factors include:Shadrake (C.A.), pp. 809‚Äì812, paras. 81‚Äì82; Chan, pp. 204‚Äì205; Yeo & Liang, pp. 30‚Äì31. *The extent to which the allegedly fair criticism is supported by argument and evidence. *The manner in which the alleged criticism is made. *The party's attitude towards the court. *The number of instances of contemning conduct. In addition, the court ought to bear in mind the following key question: does the impugned statement constitute fair criticism, or does it cross the legal line by posing a real risk of undermining public confidence in the administration of justice?Shadrake (C.A.), p. 813, para. 86. The view has been taken that it may be rather burdensome for the Prosecution to have to prove the alleged contemnor was unaware of any rational basis for the criticism. Furthermore, although the Court did not mention this, since the effect of a statement has to be judged from an average reasonable person's point of view, perhaps the rational basis for the criticism should be apparent to the person in some manner. For example, there could be a requirement that the statement expressly mention the basis, or that it is possible to imply the basis from the statement. The basis might also be discernible from external sources such as media reports, so long as this is clear to an average reasonable person.Chan, p. 205. Further, the Court of Appeal rejected two arguments raised by the Prosecution circumscribing the scope of fair criticism. In the first place, the Court found that fair criticism should not be limited to criticism that does not question the independence, impartiality and integrity of courts. This would overly restrict the scope of fair criticism and render the concept redundant, given that most allegedly contemptuous statements, by their nature, call into question the independence, impartiality and integrity of the courts. Furthermore, Commonwealth courts have previously held that imputation of judicial impropriety is not ipso facto scandalizing contempt.See, for example, , and Attorney-General for New South Wales v. Mundey [1972] 2 N.S.W.L.R. 887 at 910‚Äì911, Supreme Court (N.S.W.), both cited in Shadrake (C.A.), p. 812, paras. 83‚Äì84. Next, the Court found that fair criticism should not be limited to criticism raised through formal legal avenues, which include court proceedings and the removal of judges under Article 98(3) of the Constitution. This limitation overburdens the right of free speech, and a person should not be prevented from raising rationally supported criticism simply because he or she does not have access to formal avenues.Shadrake (C.A.), p. 812, para. 85. Court of Appeal's ruling on the impugned statements The Court of Appeal applied the principles of law enunciated above to the 11 statements that were found to be contemptuous by the High Court. The Court held that \\"the statements should be read as statements emanating from a person who has held himself out as an investigative journalist and the actual or potential effect of the statements on the public should be assessed accordingly.\\"Shadrake (C.A.), p. 814, para. 92. The Court of Appeal differed from the High Court in holding that nine of the 11 statements were contemptuous.Yeo & Liang, pp. 31‚Äì32. It found that there was a real risk that these statements would undermine public confidence in the administration of justice as they suggested that the judiciary was influenced by considerations relating to politics, international trade and business;Shadrake (C.A.), pp. 815‚Äì816, paras. 98 and 100; and p. 820, paras. 109‚Äì111. favoured wealthy and privileged people;Shadrake (C.A.), p. 821, paras. 113‚Äì115 and 120. and was compliant to instructions issued by the Government.Shadrake (C.A.), pp. 827‚Äì828, paras. 138‚Äì139. Three statements referred to the case of Vignes Mourthi,Vignes s/o Mourthi v. Public Prosecutor [2003] 3 S.L.R.(R.) 105. who had been convicted of drug trafficking and sentenced to death. Shadrake had drawn attention to the fact that one Sergeant Rajkumar from the Central Narcotics Bureau was under investigation for offences under the Prevention of Corruption Act. at around the time he was giving evidence in Mourthi's case. Shadrake then stated that the high echelons of the judiciary knew about Rajkumar's misdeeds but deliberately suppressed knowledge of them until after Mourthi had been executed.Shadrake (C.A.), pp. 825‚Äì826, paras. 128 and 131. There was no rational basis for these statements. Shadrake claimed that the judiciary would have known of the proceedings against Rajkumar because members of the subordinate judiciary, who deal with 95% of the cases in Singapore, and prosecutors, are both drawn from the Singapore Legal Service. Furthermore, some judges of the Supreme Court were elevated from the Subordinate Courts and had served stints in the Attorney-General's Chambers. The Court of Appeal agreed with the High Court's findings that this was too incredible and attenuated to form a rational basis for the claim.Shadrake (C.A.), p. 823, para. 121; and p. 826, para. 132. The Court of Appeal found that the two remaining statements were not contemptuous of the courts. One of the statements could be construed as claiming that the Government, acting through the Prosecution, had chosen to bring reduced charges against a German national for fear of economic reprisals by the German government.Shadrake (C.A.), p. 813, para. 89; and pp. 817‚Äì818, paras. 101 and 104. The other statement was possibly directed at the People's Action Party, the ruling party of Singapore.Shadrake (C.A.), p. 828, para. 142. Sentence The Court of Appeal stated that sentencing is neither an exact science nor an exercise of raw discretion. Sentencing is based on a set of guidelines that should not be applied rigidly as if they are \\"writ in jurisprudential stone\\". Instead, it should always depend on the precise facts and context concerned.Shadrake (C.A.), p. 829, para. 146. To illustrate, the Court stated some of the sentencing guidelines enunciated in preceding cases, which include the following:Shadrake (C.A.), pp. 829‚Äì830, para. 147.Yeo & Liang, p. 32. *The culpability of the contemnor, and the nature and gravity of the contempt.Tan Liang Joo John, p. 1143, para. 31. *The seriousness of the occasion on which the contempt was committed. *The number of contemptuous statements made.Attorney-General v. Zimmerman [1985‚Äì1986] S.L.R.(R.) 476 at 488, para. 51, H.C. (Singapore).Hertzberg, p. 1135, para. 59. *The type of contemptuous statements and how widely they were disseminated. *How important it is to deter other people from acting in the same way. *Whether the contemnor has committed similar offences in the past. *Any remorse shown by the contemnor, for instance, in the form of a sincere apology.Tan Liang Joo John, p. 1145, para. 39. The Court also held recognized that imprisonment should not be regarded as the starting point for sentences for scandalizing contempt. The punishment imposed depends on the facts and the context of the case.Shadrake (C.A.), p. 830, para. 148. The London headquarters of The Guardian newspaper at Kings Place. The Court of Appeal held that remarks made to the newspaper by Shadrake following his conviction in the High Court showed he had no remorse about the contemptuous statements in his book. On the facts of the case, the Court stated that although it had only found nine statements made by Shadrake to be contemptuous, these statements constituted serious acts of scandalizing contempt. Furthermore, the extent and mode of publication and distribution aggravated the harm. The Court noted the admission by Shadrake's counsel that nearly 6,000 copies had been sold in Singapore and abroad due to heightened curiosity about the book during the trial. The medium of publication ‚Äì a book ‚Äì was also more permanent, compared to past cases which had involved articles in journals or magazines. This increased the risk of damage to public confidence in the administration of justice.Shadrake (C.A.), p. 830, paras. 149‚Äì150. Conversely, there were no mitigating factors in Shadrake's favour. The Court of Appeal stated that Shadrake had not shown any remorse, but had continued to stand by the statements he made. Following the High Court's ruling on liability but before it had sentenced him, Shadrake had also given an interview to the UK newspaper The Guardian, in which he described his book as \\"devastatingly accurate\\" and declared that \\"[t]his story is never going away. I'll keep it on the boil for as long as I live. They're going to regret they ever started this.\\". Furthermore, Shadrake had expressed an intention to produce a second edition of the book.Shadrake (C.A.), pp. 830‚Äì831, para. 151. The Court of Appeal also disagreed with the High Court's approach of granting Shadrake an unquantified discount should be given in order to prevent stifling legitimate debate on the death penalty and other areas of law. The Court of Appeal maintained that such debate had always been open to all and would continue to be so, but such debate must not go overboard and constitute scandalizing contempt. It affirmed the High Court's sentence of six weeks' imprisonment and a fine of $20,000, with an additional jail term of two weeks to run consecutively with the six-week term if the fine was not paid.Shadrake (C.A.), pp. 831‚Äì832, paras. 154‚Äì156.

Final rule determining Asclepias welshii (Welsh‚Äôs Milkweed) to be a threatened species with critical habitat. Federal Register October 28, 1987. It is a federally listed threatened species of the United States. This is an erect perennial herb growing up to a meter tall. It is \\"a rather handsome milkweed\\" which \\"is a very distinctive species with no obvious close relatives,\\" according to Holmgren and Holmgren, who described the plant in 1979.Holmgren, N. H. and P. K. Holmgren. (1979). A new species of Asclepias (Asclepiadaceae) from Utah. Brittonia 31:1 110-14. It grows from a sturdy rhizome system that anchors it in the unstable sands of its native dune habitat, with several aboveground stems arising from one rhizome system. For this reason, it is not possible to get an accurate count of how many individual plants actually exist, since several widely spaced stems may actually belong to one plant; estimates of the number of plants remaining are based on stem counts. The rhizomes can penetrate very deeply into the dunes, possibly even to the bedrock at the base, and all the plants in one colony may actually be one individual with clones.Palmer, B. C. and L. Armstrong. Demography and monitoring of Welsh's milkweed (Asclepias welshii) at Coral Pink Sand Dunes. There are perhaps 20,000 stems, according to count data, for an unknown number of genetically separate individuals. The plant colonizes empty dunes and is eventually outcompeted when other plant species move into the area.Center for Plant Conservation A pioneer species of blowouts, it often grows alongside blowout grass (Redfieldia flexuosa), a resident of this habitat type. The upright stem has several oppositely arranged pairs of leaves up to 9 centimeters long by 6 wide. The stem and leaves are covered in a dense coat of woolly hairs, especially the new leaves. The hairs may prevent the plant from losing water in its dry habitat, or protect the plant tissues from the scouring action of windblown sand. The inflorescence is a dense ball of many flowers, the whole head measuring around 7 centimeters wide. Each flower is just under a centimeter long and white in color with a pale pink center. The fruit is a warty follicle containing large hair-tufted seeds that measure at least 2 centimeters in length. Many plants do not produce many mature fruits and undergo vegetative reproduction, spreading via the rhizome. The plant may be difficult to identify if not in its mature form; the two immature forms look very different. The smallest form which emerges through the sand from the rhizome has narrow linear leaves very unlike those the mature plant, and the secondary form has leaves intermediate to the two. The largest population of the plant at Coral Pink Dunes State Park, particularly the half managed by the Bureau of Land Management, has been impacted by off-road vehicle use, but such activity in the area has not increased since the plant was listed for protection. Park staff keeps track of off-road vehicle activity on the grounds. ORVs are not allowed in the Paria Canyon-Vermilion Cliffs Wilderness, where there is a widespread occurrence.Hughes, L. E. (2000). Monitoring update on four listed plants on the Arizona Strip. In: Maschinski, J. and L. Holter, Eds. Southwestern rare and endangered plants: proceedings of the third conference. USDA FS. The plant also occurs south of the Utah border in Arizona. This population is on Navajo Nation territory, which is remote, unmonitored, and not thought to be impacted by human activity.

Life He was born at Elgin in the year 1792 or 1793, and at an early age was apprenticed by his father to a weaver at Peterhead. He had a great aversion to the trade, and his predilection for art was so strong that he was accustomed to sketch figures upon the cloth on which he was occupied at the loom, and when his leisure permitted him to resort to the sea-shore, he found great pleasure in sketching on the smooth sand. When about fourteen years of age, he walked from Peterhead to Aberdeen, where he received his first lessons in light and shade. At this time there was a meeting of the Synod, the members of which he was permitted to sketch; and his work gave such satisfaction, that he was forthwith commissioned to paint it, but this he was compelled to decline, as he was totally ignorant of the use of colours. He must have employed his leisure profitably, for when about twenty years of age he went to Edinburgh, where he was patronized by the Earls of Elgin and Buchan, and was subsequently appointed an instructor at the Royal Scottish Academy. In 1818, he went to London, still under the patronage of the Earl of Buchan, and met with much encouragement. In 1829, he became an Associate Exhibitor of the Water-Colour Society and frequently sent works to that Institution. His favourite department of art was history, hut he also painted portraits with eminent success. Having suffered from severe illness during nine years before his death, his later productions do not exhibit that degree of vigour which characterize his earlier works. 'The Pedlar,' a water-colour painting by him, is in the South Kensington Museum. He died at Rothesay, in the Isle of Bute, on 3 October 1847. Works The following are some of his most important works exhibited at the Royal Academy: *Boys with a Burning Glass. 1822. *The Cut Foot. 1823. *Baptism of Ben Jonson's Daughter (wiih portraits of Shakespeare, Jonsonj Beaumont, Fletcher and Raleigh). 1837. *The Lords of the Congregation taking the oath of the Covenant. 1842. *The Minister and his Wife concealing the Scottish Regalia in the Church (his last work). 1846.

He then captured the city of Ankara from MehmetJoseph von Hammer: Osmanlƒ± Tarihi Vol I (condensation: Abd√ºlkadir Karahan), Milliyet yayƒ±nlarƒ±, ƒ∞stanbul. p 56-57 but did not advance further. S√ºleyman returned to Bursa, which gave Mehmet a chance to relax. Mehmet then made an alliance with their brother Musa √áelebi, who was also a contender for the Ottoman throne, sending Musa to the European portion of the empire (Rumelia) via Wallachia (modern Romania). Because of this plot, S√ºleyman now had to fight in two fronts on two sides, one in Europe against Musa and one in Anatolia against Mehmet. S√ºleyman turned his attention to Rumelia against Musa, leaving Anatolia to Mehmet once again. Musa had the support of Wallachians and the Serbs, and S√ºleyman had the support of the Byzantines. However, the Serbs switched sides and joined S√ºleyman's forces, and Musa was defeated in the Battle of Kosmidion on 15 June 1410.Prof. Ya≈üar Y√ºce-Prof. Ali Sevim: T√ºrkiye Tarihi Cilt II, AKDTYKTTK Yayƒ±nlarƒ±, ƒ∞stanbul, 1991 p 74-76 However, S√ºleyman was not a willful prince, and to the dismay of his partisans, he began living in extravagance. Especially after the death of his able vizier √áandarlƒ± Ali Pasha, S√ºleyman's indifference to state affairs caused him to lose supporters. Thus in 1411, when Musa marched to Edirne, S√ºleyman found almost no one at his side. He tried to escape to Byzantine territories, but on the way, he was murdered on February 17, 1411. Nicholae Jorga: Geschishte des Osmanichen (Trans :Nil√ºfer Ep√ßeli) Vol 1 Yeditepe yayƒ±nlarƒ±, ƒ∞stanbul,2009, p 314  Aftermath  After S√ºleyman's death, Musa became the ruler of the Rumeli. The alliance between Mehmet and Musa soon broke and the two brothers continued to fight until Musa's defeat and death on July 5, 1413, when Mehmet became the sole ruler of the empire as Mehmet I. Family S√ºleyman married two times: #F√ºlane Hatun, (m. 1403) daughter of Ilario Doria and his wife Zampia Palaiologina, illegitimate daughter of Emperor Manuel II Palaiologos; #Despina Hatun, (m. 1404) daughter of Theodore I Palaiologos, Despot of Morea and his unnamed mistress; He had three children; *≈ûehzade Orhan √áelebi (died 1429); *≈ûehzade Mehmed≈üah (died 30 December 1421); *Pa≈üamelek Hatun, married to a Sanjak Bey.

Opened in 1885, it is located on the Tirano‚ÄìLecco railway. The station is currently managed by Rete Ferroviaria Italiana (RFI). However, the commercial area of the passenger building is managed by Centostazioni. Train services are operated by Trenord. Each of these companies is a subsidiary of Ferrovie dello Stato (FS), Italy's state- owned rail company. Location Sondrio railway station is situated in Piazza Giovanni Bertacchi, at the southeastern edge of the town centre. History The station was opened on 16 June 1885, upon the inauguration of the Lecco‚ÄìColico‚ÄìSondrio section of the Valtellina railway. Like the rest of the line, the station was part of the Rete Adriatica (RA) (), which, from 1 July 1885, was headed by the management of the Societ√† per le Strade Ferrate Meridionali (SFM) (). On 29 June 1902, the line was extended to Tirano, as the Alta Valtellina railway, operated by the Societ√† Ferrovia Alta Valtellina (FAV) (). As a consequence of the nationalization of the Italian railways on 1 July 1905, the Valtellina line from Lecco and its rolling stock passed into the ownership of the FS. In 1970, the FS also assumed control of the Alta Valtellina line to Tirano. Features The passenger building, following a renovation, consists of the following public spaces: ticketing, bar, kiosk and waiting room. Since the renovation, the waiting room has occupied the space previously allocated to a first class waiting room. The upholstered chairs previously located there have been replaced by wooden benches from the old second class waiting room. The building containing the public conveniences, which was expanded in 2009, is now Milanese in style, with a green space in front of which there is a fountain with drinking water. In front of the station, extending over the tracks, is the locomotive shed, which currently houses the historical resources of the rail heritage group ALe 883. At the Tirano end of the station, inside some detached buildings, are the headquarters of the Railway Police. There is also a goods yard, no longer in use, and access to the pedestrian underpass, which links the passenger building with platforms 2 and 3, the bus station, the free municipal parking at the Policampus, the school campus and the districts beyond the railway. Interchange In the square in front of the passenger building, there is a taxi rank and bus stop servicing bus routes 1, 3 and 4, operated by ASM Sondrio. A STPS bus stop is also located near the station.

It is the true story about Wilson, an American, and \\"√âmile\\", a 68-year- old Frenchman, who set off in the spring of 2006 from Dijon, France to hike the route Godfrey de Bouillon and his army traveled in 1096 to Jerusalem. Traveling simply with backpacks and trusting in the kindness of strangers, the pair have two goals: to carry a message of peace along a route historically used for war, and to establish a pilgrimage path others might follow regardless of nationality, culture and religion.http://www.pilgrimstales.com/alongthetemplartrail.html Details Their five-month journey leads them 2620 miles across eleven countries and two continents toward Jerusalem. The modern-day pilgrims follow canal paths from France through Switzerland to Donaueschingen in southern Germany, source of the Danube River. In Bavaria they connect with the Donauradweg, or bicycle path, that leads through Bavaria into Austria, then Bratislava, Slovakia and into Hungary. Often staying in monasteries or with families, they hike 31-50 kilometers a day. Upon reaching Budapest, they head south following the Danube Valley on bicycle paths and roads to Serbia. There the relative predictability of their journey changes. Israel and Hezbollah trade missiles, Beirut Airport is bombed, and southern Lebanon evacuated. Still, the men continue walking to Istanbul where they will decide if, how, and where to continue. As word of their peace walk spreads, national television networks and newspapers in cities such as Belgrade (Glas, Public Voice, Novosti), Sombor (TV Speckar), Sofia (Balkan Bulgarian Television), Plovdiv (Labor), Ni≈° (Niska Televizija), and Alanya, Turkey (Kanal A TV Nightly News and Memleketim Alanya) interview the pair.http://www.pilgrimstales.com/mediakits.html After the couple connects with the ancient Roman Via Militaris through Bulgaria to Istanbul, conditions grow worse. Emile becomes ill and returns home. While Wilson hikes across Turkey, there is an attempted attack on the US Embassy in Damascus and an Ebola-like virus erupts in eastern Turkey. Drastic decisions are made. The border between north and south Cyprus has just recently opened. To avoid walking through war zones, Wilson crosses from the Turkish coast to Cyprus, then treks to Limassol, rich in the Templar history. After a short sea crossing, he connects with the Israel National Trail, from near Haifa to Jerusalem.http://www.pilgrimstales.com/whatistemplartrail.html Along the Templar Trail combines a unique cast of characters, intrigue, and adventure with personal growth and social commentary. Wilson writes, ‚ÄúWe are all pilgrims, each on their own path, each with their own story to tell. Walking is only a first step, but one we each can take to discover the peace within. In that way, eventually, war will become unconscionable. Darkness will be dispelled with light‚Äîone person, one step at a time.‚Äù Book contains stages, distances, rough maps, photos, and gear list for those who might follow this trail, one named to honor Knights Templar originally tasked with aiding early pilgrims to Jerusalem.

It is a derivative of the parent heterocycle called dithiin. It is notable for its ease of oxidation.  Structure and synthesis  Like other 1,4-dithiins but unlike its oxygen analog dibenzodioxin, the shape of thianthrene is not planar. It is bent, with a fold angle of 128¬∞ between the two benzo groups. Thianthrene can be prepared by treating benzene with disulfur dichloride in the presence of aluminium chloride..

It is also known locally as Ch√¢teau de Saint-Didier.  Position  The castle is sited on the edge of a rocky crest, dominating the hamlet of Chantemerle and the Is√®re valley.  History  The castle is known from documentary sources in 1196. It was rebuilt in the 13th century.Charles-Laurent Salch (1987), Dictionnaire des ch√¢teaux et des fortifications du Moyen √Çge en France, p. 109, (). In the 14th century, it was adapted for defence against fire arms with new entrances, arrowslits converted to windows, and machicolations destroyed. These alterations were made in brick. Around 1263, the archbishop of Tarentaise decided to move the canons to Mo√ªtiers. There, in what is now the sector of Albertville, a conflict erupted between the Count of Savoy and the archbishop around the rights of each to the sector of Cl√©ry. Thus, the archbishop, wanting to stamp his authority on this territory and considering himself threatened by the Count's advances, decided to build a castle at Bathie in the lower Tarentaise valley, around which he completely reorganised a ch√¢telain. He also profited from this by joining Cl√©ry to this new archepiscopal ch√¢telain, for the benefit of the men and properties dependent on him.

In a corner of the curtain wall, slightly lower, is a second, square, tower. Habitable and measuring 8.5 m square, it is divided like the keep into five floored levels, lit by rectangular windows.

Choffard was born in Paris in 1731. While still very young he showed great aptitude for drawing flowers and ornaments, and was placed with an engraver of maps named Dheulland, but he afterwards received lessons from Babel, an engraver of ornaments, and is said to have had also the benefit of the advice of Nicolas Edelinck, Balechou, and Cochin. Commencing with the cartouches of maps, which date from 1753 to 1756, he next engraved invitation and address cards and book-plates, and these drew attention to his abilities and secured for him the commission to execute the tail-pieces for the celebrated edition of the 'Contes' of La Fontaine published by the Fermiers-G√©n√©raux in 1762. The fertility of invention and the taste displayed by the artist in these gems of art are known and admired by all. The series ends with his own portrait in profile as the tail-piece of 'Le Rossignol.' lithograph of an engraving by Choffard after Pierre-Antoine Baudouin's 1789 painting. To these succeeded, among a host of minor pieces, the large ornaments placed at the head of each book of the Ovid's 'Metamorphoses' of 1767‚Äì1771, the headpieces to Saint-Lambert' s poem, 'Les Saisons,' issued in 1769, and again with some alterations in 1775, those to Imbert's poem, 'Le Jugement de Paris,' 1772, and the tail-pieces to Desormeaux's 'Histoire de la Maison de Bourbon,' published in the years 1779‚Äì1788. All these combined to establish his reputation as a designer of ornament without a rival. Besides these, the ornamental pieces which he executed for the 'Voyage pittoresque de Naples et de Sicile' of Saint-Non, published in 1781, and the plates of 'Les Amants surpris,' 'Les Amours champ√™tres,' and 'Marchez tout doux, parlez tout bas,' after Baudouin, and a view of Narbonne, after Monnet, must be ranked among his best works. Choffard wrote in 1804 a 'Notice historique sur l'art de la Gravure,' and was about to undertake a more extensive work when he was struck down by death at Paris in 1809. MM. Portalis and B√©raldi give in their 'Graveurs du Dix-huitieme Si√®cle' a detailed catalogue of his engravings, which number 855.

It is, in its simplest form, the outcome of the application of the social networking (i.e. Facebook) paradigm to the context of project ecosystems, as a continued response to the movement toward distributed, virtual teams. Distributed virtual teams lose significant communication value normally present when groups are collocated. Because of this, social project management is motivated by a philosophy of the maximizing of open, and continuous communication, both inside and outside the team. Because it is a response to new organizing structures that require technologically mediated communications, Social Project Management is most often enabled by the use of Collaborative software inspired by social media (i.e. Ongozah). This paradigm enables the project work to be published as activity stream and publicized via the integration with the social network of an organization. Social project management embraces both the historical best practices of Project management, and the open collaboration of Web 2.0. While Project management 2.0 embraced a philosophical shift away from centralized command and control and focused strongly on the egalitarian collaboration of a team, social project management recognizes the important role of the project manager, especially on large projects. Additionally, while Project management 2.0 minimized the importance of computer-supported scheduling, social project management recognizes that while many projects can be performed using emergent planning and control,, From Fayol to Flores: The essential shift , , The Origins of Modern Project Management large, enterprise projects require centralized control accompanied by seamless collaboration.  History  The concept of social project management emerged during 2008 when some developers of project management tools started to use the term to differentiate between traditional project management tools and tools for Agile software development. While some have used the terminology Project Management 2.0 and social project management interchangeably, they exhibit significant differences in practice. Communigram-NET, a network of excellence on social project management, has been set up since November 2011.  Key concepts (how social project management differs from Project Management 2.0)  Social business software, of which social project management is a subset, powers business performance based upon its ability to assist teams in managing exceptions. Because it is based on the concepts of Social Business Software in general, Social Project Management software is differentiated from other collaborative project software by three key areas of functionality: First, social project management software is embedded into the social network of the larger organization. One goal that Project management 2.0 systems realized was the need to create project-based collaboration systems. However, PM2.0 tools were often adopted at the project level, and not the enterprise level. This led to the situation where team members on several projects might have to use multiple tools for collaboration, depending on what project they were working on at that moment. Additionally, because of the fragmented nature of the tools used, little visibility existed to any person outside of the project team. Social project management is based upon the philosophy that the project team is one part of an integrated whole, and that valuable, relevant and unique abilities and knowledge exist within the larger organization. For this reason, Social Project Management systems are integrated into the collaborative platform(s) of an organization, so that communication can proceed outside the project boundaries. Second, social project management software is organized around a formal project schedule, and all activities and collaborative functionality are linked to this schedule. While PM 2.0 tools stressed collaboration, many tools provided little to no actual project management capabilities. While this often worked very well for smaller projects, especially ones with distributed teams, it could not scale to enterprise-level projects. Social project management embraces the vision of seamless online collaboration within a project team, but also provides for the use of rigorous project management techniques. Third, social project management software provides an activity stream that allows the team, and its stakeholders to build ambient awareness of the project activity and status. This is what makes social project management \\"social\\". The concept of Ambient awareness enables distributed teams to build awareness in ways that previously was restricted to teams that were collocated. Using the Activity Stream paradigm, large distributed teams are provided with a constant stream of information regarding the project. While in the past, this kind of continuous communication might have been posited to create Information Overload, this stream of small bits of information has been shown to create significant alignment between people working together, without overload.

Hoping to liberate Poland, he fought on the French side in the Napoleonic Wars, fighting at Essling, Wagram, Dresden, Ulm, Leipzig, Hanau and Berezina, for which Napoleon made him a baron de l'Empire. He also later took part in the November Uprising against Russia. Life =Early life= From an old Polish noble family, Tomasz's parents were Feliks ≈Åubie≈Ñski, count of Pomian and minister of justice in the Duchy of Warsaw, and Tekla Teresa ≈Åubie≈Ñska n√©e Bieli≈Ñska, herself a poet and author of historical plays. Her main works were Wanda, kr√≥lowa polska (1806), (Wanda, Queen of Poland), and Karol Wielki i Witykind (1807) (Charlemagne and Wedekind). She also translated the works of Jean Racine and Voltaire into Polish. Tomasz was the second of their ten children - the eldest sibling was Franciszek, the others being Piotr, Jan, Henryk, Tadeusz, J√≥zef, Maria, Paulina and R√≥≈ºa. Aged six, Tomasz entered the Academy of the Royal Cadet Corps (the military cavalry school). His first two years there were spent learning foreign languages, artillery science and fencing. His first rank was as 'ChorƒÖ≈ºy' (standard bearer). The next five years were spent on military construction and engineering.http://aon.edu.pl/index.php?option=com_content&task;=view&id;=147&Itemid;=118 In 1801 he received further education in Vienna before moving to Warsaw under the tutelage his uncle, Antoni Protazy Potocki. He also came under the influence of count Wincenty Krasi≈Ñski (1782‚Äì1858), a political activist who set up the 'Society of Friends of the Fatherland' but who was later to refuse to join the November Uprising. In 1805 Tomasz married Konstancja Ossoli≈Ñska (1783‚Äì1868), who brought a major dowry in the form of estates near the town of Che≈Çm. They had a daughter, Adela, born 1806 and a son, Napoleon Leon, born 1812 . =1806-1825= In 1806 the French entered Warsaw, where Napoleon was met by a guard of honour made up of major Polish statesmen. Hoping to liberate Poland from Russia, ≈Åubie≈Ñski and many other Polish officers fought on the French side. In 1807 the army of the Duchy of Warsaw was made up of 31,713 infantrymen, 6,035 cavalrymen and 95 cannon. At the same time the Polish 1st Light Cavalry Regiment of the Imperial Guard formed in the camp at Mir. Its colonel was Wincenty Krasinski and its four squadrons were commanded by ≈Åubie≈Ñski, Jan Kozietulski, Ignace Stolowski and Henri Kamienski. After Pu≈Çtusk ≈Åubie≈Ñski was awarded the L√©gion d‚Äôhonneur and in 1808 he fought at Somosierra, supporting the final phase of the assault. He and his regiment fought in the Peninsular War before he returned to Paris in January 1809. On 5 April 1809 he received the cross of a Grand Officer of the L√©gion d‚Äôhonneur. In the 1809 campaign he fought at Essling on 22 May and Wagram (6 July) and to reward his courage Napoleon made him a Baron de l'Empire with a pension of 4,000 francs, later increased to 6,000 francs. In 1810, a few months after retiring to Warsaw, he received the order of Virtuti Militari. Following a disagreement with the regiment's commander, Krasi≈Ñski, ≈Åubie≈Ñski was dismissed. At the start of 1811 he was sent to Segan with the Legion of the Vistula (Legia Nadwisla≈Ñska), one of the largest Polish foreign legions of the Napoleonic era, which was renamed the 8th Uhlan Regiment (8√©me r√©giment de Uhlans).http://les-polonais-sous-l-empire.over-blog.com/article-22585070.htm In March 1812 ≈Åubie≈Ñski led his regiment to Berlin, Grudziadz, Wystruƒá, and Vilnius to fight in various Polish campaigns. Remaining in reserve with the regiment commanded by marshal Nicolas Charles Oudinot, ≈Åubie≈Ñski and his men suffered heavy losses guarding the French army at the crossing of the Berezina. At the end of 1812, ≈Åubie≈Ñski returned to Warsaw to rest and in 1813 fought at Dresden, Kulm, Leipzig and Hanau. In January 1814 he was discharged by the French, becoming commander-in-chief of the Polish army. In that post Napoleon put him in charge of allotting salaries and subsidies to Polish soldiers. He received the Order of Saint Stanislas 2nd class. After the Russian takeover and as he could not agree with Grand Duke Constantine Pavlovich of Russia, he was relieved of the role of commander-in-chief in 1816. ≈Åubie≈Ñski and several of his brothers set up the ≈Åubie≈Ñski Brothers enterprise, building its first factory in Warsaw in 1827 in the Guzowska Ruda region (now ≈ªyrard√≥w, Masovian Voivodeship). This became the first industrial factory in a rural area.≈ªuchlewska, Teresa (2009). \\"Henryk ≈Åubie≈Ñski (1793-1883) i jego dzia≈Çalno≈õƒá gospodarczo-spo≈Çeczna\\", Rocznik ≈ªyrardowski, 7 / Muzeum Historii Polski, http://mazowsze.hist.pl/29/Rocznik_Zyrardowski/659/2009/23655/ pp. 527-570. Between 1825 and 1828 he was a justice of the peace for the Che≈Çm district and between 1820 and 1825 a senator in the Sejm.Brandys, Marian, (2010). Koniec ≈õwiata szwole≈ºer√≥w, Tom 1, Czcigodni weterani, Warszawa: MG. This the first in a hugely popular series, originally published by Iskra in 1972, about members of the light cavalry who had served in Napoleon's Russian campaign. Much of the material in the book is drawn from Tomasz's surviving correspondence to his father and other relatives. =November Uprising= On 29 November 1830 the Poles began the November Uprising against their Russian occupiers. On 10 February 1831 ≈Åubie≈Ñski was made commander of the 2nd Cavalry Corps, made up of 33 battalions and 16 cannon. After the First Battle of Wawer, he and his corps did not fight despite receiving orders to do so, due to what he felt was the overwhelming numerical superiority of the Russian forces. J√≥zef Ch≈Çopicki and Ignacy PrƒÖdzy≈Ñski accused him of treason and ruining the last chance of a victory by refusing to obey an order to attack with his cavalry at Olszynka Grochowska. Historians have justified his disobedience as a good decision since sacrificing his cavalry could not have changed the course of the battle. On 1 June ≈Åubie≈Ñski was promoted to lieutenant-general and chief-of-staff. This position involved organising and supplying the main Polish towns and cities. On 19 August he put up major resistance to the Russian advance on Warsaw under Ivan Paskevich, successor to marshal Diebitch, field-marshal of the Russian army and lieutenant of the Kingdom of Poland, who had died of cholera. At Warsaw, ≈Åubie≈Ñski was put in charge of resupplying the city without being told of the Russians' numerical superiority. Members of the city's Patriotic Association and others of his political opponents fiercely criticised him and his actions, accusing him of sabotaging the uprising. ≈Åubie≈Ñski was diplomatic with his opponents, although on 28 September, he got general Maciej Rybi≈Ñski dismissed upon accusations of entering negotiations with Paskevich for a Polish surrender. Three days later ≈Åubie≈Ñski returned to find Warsaw occupied by the Russians and he and the other Polish generals were condemned to exile in Russia. Due to his past exploits and thanks to his understanding of the Polish political situation, he won an audience with Tsar Nicholas I of Russia on 24 November 1831 in Moscow. He then 'collaborated' as a deputy in the Saint Petersburg diet from 1832 to 1834 while looking after the interests of the ≈Åubie≈Ñski brothers' business in the chamber of commerce and working mainly to regain lands and assets confiscated from Polish insurgents. =Businessman= Tomasz and his brothers entered an industrial partnership, Bracia ≈Åubie≈Ñscy SA, in the 1820s that was involved in steel production, sugar and textile manufacture and eventually railways and a department store. In 1839 he travelled to London to gain financial aid for his metallurgical business. In 1840 and 1841 he was director of works on the project to build a rail route from Warsaw to Vienna, commissioned by the Polish railways. He retired from active life to Warsaw after his brother, Henryk's financial difficulties: he had been charged with alleged bank fraud (misappropriating public funds for personal use) and convicted to 4 years in prison. To save his brother's and the family's honour, Tomasz covered Henryk's debts to financiers.≈Åubie≈Ñski, Tomasz Wentworth. (1886).

He was founder of the boys' Texas German and English Academy and the co-educational Bickler Academy, both located in Austin, Texas. In 1969, Recorded Historic Texas Landmark 6438 was placed at the site of the Goodman Building, noting the location on the second floor of Jacob Bickler's German and English academy. Early life Jacob Bickler was born on November 20, 1849, in Bad Sobernheim in Rhineland- Palatinate, Germany to Peter Bickler and his wife Katherine Sch√∂ffling Bickler. He received his early education in the public schools of Bad Sobernheim. Peter Bickler married a second time and moved to Milwaukee, Wisconsin where the teenage Jacob joined the new couple in 1863. From 1863‚Äì1867, young Bickler attended Milwaukee high schools and Milwaukee Markham Academy College Preparatory School. In 1870, Bickler earned his Bachelor of Arts in Pedagogics from the University of Wisconsin. He became fluent in six languages. From 1871‚Äì1872, Bicker was a Principal in the educational system of La Crosse, Wisconsin. Texas On December 24, 1872, Jacob Bickler moved to Austin, Texas and joined his uncle his Philip Bickler in teaching at the Bickler German-English Academy, where artist Carl G. von Iwonski had also once taught. Land Commissioner Jacob Kuechler appointed Bickler assistant draftsman and calculator in the Texas General Land Office on April 1, 1873. On January 24, 1874, the date of Bickler's wedding, he resigned from the Texas General Land Office to resume his teaching career. In 1876, Bickler founded the Texas German and English Academy in Austin, a boys' school that remained in operation until 1902. In 1880, the Wahrenberger House in Austin was leased to Bickler. He operated the Academy at this house. According to the Texas Historical Commission, the school was located here until 1886. However, conflicting information states that the Academy was located in the Texas Military Institute Castle in Austin from 1884‚Äì1887. It is conceivable that Bickler started the Academy in the Wahrenberger House and kept his headquarters there, while moving the institute to the larger location as enrollment grew. In 1887, Bickler was elected president of the Texas State Teachers Association. Bickler served as superintent of Galveston public schools 1887‚Äì1892. In 1892, he founded the co-educational Bickler Academy in Austin, which was located in the Goodman Building until 1897. In 1969, Recorded Historic Texas Landmark 6438 was placed at the site of the Goodman Building, noting the location on the second floor of Jacob Bickler's German and English academy. In summer months, Bickler taught classes at both Fredericksburg and Mason. Bickler was a member of the summer faculty at the University of Texas. He was a leading proponent for establishment of the 1891 College of Education at the University. Personal life and death On January 24, 1874, Bickler married Martha Lungkwitz, daughter of artist Hermann Lungkwitz. The couple had nine children, eight of whom survived infancy. Jacob Bickler died in Austin on April 30, 1902, and is buried in Oakwood Cemetery in Austin, Texas.

History In 1815, when the Grand-Duchy of Luxembourg was created by the Vienna Congress, the need began to emerge for a national army. As a result of political difficulties, it was not, however, until 1842 that two infantry battalions finally came into being. The 1st Battalion, stationed in the abbey city of Echternach founded the country's first military band under the leadership of Franz Ferdinand Hoebich on 29 December 1842. Initially some 25 musicians were involved but the band grew from year to year. The 2nd battalion, garrisoned in Diekirch, was founded on 6 December 1847 under the leadership of Jean-Antoine Zinnen who is remembered for composing the music for the Luxembourg national anthem. Since June 1868 when the 2nd Battalion was disbanded, only the band of the 1st Battalion has remained. With some 60 musicians, it now takes the form of a big band. Since 1986, the bandmaster has been Lieutenant-Colonel Andr√© Reichling. The band's official activities consist of performances for the grand-ducal court and for the national government on the occasion of state visits and receptions. Its military activities include playing at parades at the grand-ducal palace and for the changing of the guard.\\"Luxembourg Army History\\" , National Museum of Military History, Diekirch. Retrieved 17 January 2011. Public performances The big band gives some 50 public concerts a year, mainly in locations inside Luxembourg itself but occasionally abroad. The members of the band are professional musicians, most of whom have studied at conservatories or universities abroad. While they are soldiers, apart from basic training they have no military duties. The band's extensive repertoire stretches from military music and marches for brass bands to a large number of pieces from which selections can be made on an √† la carte basis to satisfy the particular wishes of the audience for whom they are to be performed. The band also splits up into various formations such as chamber orchestra, brass band, instrumental ensemble, wind quintet, clarinet quartet, saxophone quintet, Dixie groups or bugles and drums. Together these groups give over 200 performances per year and take part in some 150 rehearsals.

Dennett was at the center of an elaborate scheme by which isolationist Congressmen such as Hamilton Fish III and Robert Rice Reynolds would make pro-German statements in the Congressional Record, which would then be printed by Viereck and mailed around the country without postal charge using the Congressional franking privilege.Baltimore Sun, Feb. 11, 1942 Just before Federal agents raided Dennett's offices, he transferred a number of bags of illegally franked mail to Representative Fish's office, where they were subsequently discovered. Fish's chief aid George Hill was convicted of perjury in connection with the case.\\"Seven Plead Innocent of Subversive Charges\\". St. Petersburgh Times, July 30, 1942, p. 25. Dennett was inducted into the army as a private in 1941, but was subpeoned by a grand jury in September, and then indicted in July, 1942 (by which time America had declared war on Germany) with 29 other defendants on sedition charges. Most of the others charged were confirmed Nazi (or Japanese) sympathizers or agents. Dennett claimed not to harbor such sympathies, but to have only been used by Viereke and his isolationist allies in Congress. When the case resulted in mistrial in 1944, Dennett alone petitioned for a new trial in order to clear his name.Montreal Gazette, Dec. 8, 1944 This was denied, and he continued to petition Congress after the war, eventually forming a \\"Justice for New Deal Victims Committee\\" in 1948.Spartenburg Herald-Tribune, Feb. 10, 1946, p. 10 References Category:People from Bangor, Maine Category:Prisoners and detainees of the United States federal government Category:Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism alumni Category:Wheaton College (Illinois) alumni Category:1907 births Category:1992 deaths Category:Old Right (United States) Category:Pulitzer Traveling Scholarship winners ","title":"Prescott Freese Dennett"},{"id":"30505812","text":"Pakal is a 2006 Malayalam film directed by M. A. Nishad, starring Prithviraj and Jyothirmayi in the lead role.  Plot  Pakal takes us into the world of farmers, of the high ranges of Wayanad District of Kerala, who are forced to commit suicide following financial problems. The story has a lot of potential with a relevant political issue and there are some political comments too‚Äîlike hints at the failure of the government machinery and religious institutions, which ought to come to the aid of the peasants. The film opens with the protagonist Nandakumar (Prithviraj), who is a reporter of the television channel Kerala Today, being sent to Pannakamkudi to do a regular series on the plight of the farmers of the area. He alights on the mission with his cameraman Abu (Sudheesh) to the high ranges, delivering daily reports in the prime time news about the crop failure, low prices for agricultural products, inability to repay loans issued by banks and cut-throat interest rates charged by private financiers, which eventually force the peasants to commit mass suicides. Nandakumar and his crew meet 87-year-old Kochuthekkethil Kunjappan (Thilakan) in the verandah of the village office. He is one of the early settlers of the region and has been demonstrating before the village office since 14 years seeking justice from the authorities who seize his farmland, branding him a millionaire. And from the directives of the old man and the local priest Abraham Thekkilakkaadan, they meet Thenginthottathil Joseph (T G Ravi) and his family members, who are in the grip of severe financial problems and on the brink of desperation and even suicide. Joseph's eldest daughter Merlin (Sreeja Chandran) works for a private exporting company and his second daughter Celine (Jyothirmayi) is a medical student who is currently pursuing her final year house surgeonship. The family and the villagers pin all their hopes on Celine, who will be the first doctor from the village. Joseph who had to borrow loans from four different banks for his daughter's educational expenses finds it hard to settle the accounts. Slowly the media team becomes a part of the village, and their serialized investigative reports on Kerala Today, start to cause many people in the government circles and the local heartless money lender Ummachan (Jagadish), lose their sleep. The crew faces many hardships in the village as many even manhandle the team. The media management goes a step further and asks Nandakumar to stop reporting on the issue and to return to the city. But he turns down the request and continues there. But as days pass by, the villagers‚Äô plights become more hapless as many more suicides follow, including that of Merlin and Joseph. What follows in the film is how Nandakumar, with the support of Celine and other villagers, finds ways to rescue the villages from the chaos that they face.

Biography Corbineau was born in Marchiennes, the youngest son of Jean-Charles Corbineau, Inspector General of the King's Stables in the G√©n√©ralit√© of Tours and bailiff-general of Marchiennes Abbey, and his wife Mary-Louise-Magdeleine Varlet. His older brothers Jean and Claude were also army officers, and together the three men were known as les trois Horaces (\\"the three Horatii\\"). Corbineau volunteered for service in the Navy on 1 April 1793, when only 12 years old, to save his father from persecution by the revolutionaries. After serving aboard the privateer Requin and the corvette Na√Øade, he then entered the Army, as a private soldier in the L√©gion des Francs, serving in the Army of the North. He transferred to the cavalry of the L√©gion des Francs, and was promoted to sous-lieutenant on 20 September 1796. With his brother Claude, he participated in the expedition to Ireland in December 1796. Promoted to lieutenant on 30 October 1797, he served in campaigns with the Army of Helvetia and the Army of the Rhine, joining the 7th Regiment of Hussars on 29 July 1798, and transferring the 5th Regiment of Chasseurs on 5 April 1800. Corbineau distinguished himself at the battle of Hohenlinden on 3 December 1800. He served as adjudant-major from 2 April 1802, and was promoted to capitaine on 16 March 1804. On 5 November 1804 he was made a Legionnaire of the Legion of Honour. Corbineau entered the Imperial Guard on 12 September 1805, where he served in the Chasseurs √† Cheval de la Garde Imp√©riale successively as an adjoint √† l'√©tat-major (assistant to the Staff), then adjudant-major, and finally as a chef d'escadron. He fought at the battles of Austerlitz (2 December 1805), afterwards receiving promotion to major (18 December 1805), and also at Jena (14 October 1806), Eylau (7/8 February 1807)‚Äîwhere he was wounded in the right thigh, and his older brother Claude was killed‚Äîand Friedland (14 June 1807). Bataille de Wagram, 6 Juillet 1809 by Horace Vernet. Corbineau is shown injured at the lower left. He was awarded the rank of Officer of the Legion of Honour on 17 November 1808, and promoted to colonel on 13 June 1809. At the battle of Wagram (5‚Äì6 July 1809), while his regiment attacked a battery, Corbineau's right knee was shattered by a musket ball, necessitating the amputation of his leg at the thigh, putting an end to his military career. Corbineau recovered in hospital alongside his friend Pierre Yrieix Daumesnil, who had suffered a similar wound. One night, Daumesnil heard what sounded like water dripping. He called out to Corbineau, but got no reply. Despite his unhealed amputation, Daumesnil crawled out of his bed and found that Corbineau's wound was haemorrhaging badly. Daumesnil crawled out of the room and down two flights of stairs to call for help before passing out. Doctors arrived, and both men's lives were saved. In honour of Corbineau's and Daumesnil's service, Napoleon left them on the roll of the Chasseurs, despite the fact that neither served with the regiment again. Corbineau returned to France and was given the post of Receveur G√©n√©ral des Finances (Receiver General of Finances) for the department of Seine-Inf√©rieure on 14 March 1810, based at Rouen. He was made a Baron of the Empire on 1 June 1810, and was also a member of the Electoral College of the Northern Department. In 1814, after the First Restoration, Corbineau was transferred to the department of the Marne, where he died on 5 April 1823. Personal life Commemorative plaque to the Corbineau brothers, Rue Corbineau, Marchiennes In 1810 Corbineau married Reine Rose Kermarec de Travrou, the daughter of a former member of Parlement of Brittany, and had a son, Eug√®ne-Hercule, and a daughter, Ad√®le-Marie, who married the Comte de Champagny (son of the Duke of Cadore) in Paris on 30 July 1836.

A similar bill was filed in the Maryland Senate (SB 116-Civil Marriage Protection Act) and was assigned to the House Judiciary committee, the committee on which Alston served. During the committee voting session on SB 116, Alston revoked her co-sponsorship and instead offered an amendment to change the bill from same-sex marriage to civil unions. The amendment failed and Alston then voted against the bill. Despite Alston's vote, SB 116 was approved by the committee 12-10 and was forwarded to the full House of Delegates for final approval, but the bill was eventually sent back to committee, effectively terminating the bill for the session. Criminal charges Alston was indicted in an Anne Arundel County courtroom with embezzlement on September 24, 2011 on one count each of felony and misdemeanor theft, misappropriation by a fiduciary and two election law offenses for allegedly using Maryland General Assembly funds and her election campaign funds to cover her wedding expenses and to pay an employee of her law firm.

History  From the start of the feudal era, it was the property of the Seyssel family. In the 13th century, on the death of Humbert III, lord of Aix and Bordeau, it was inherited by the younger son, Hugues, while the elder received the fortress of Aix. With the death of the last of the cadet branch, in 1517, the Ch√¢teau de La B√¢tie reverted to the lords of Aix. At the death of Maurice de Seyssel, marquis of Aix and La Chambre on 14 May 1660, the fief of La B√¢tie passed to Jacques d'Allinges, who sold it in 1679 to Fran√ßois d'Oncieu (President of the Cour des Comptes, Baron of Saint-Denis, Chaffardon, and la Batie, lord of Genissia, Senator at the Savoy Senate). His family's lands at La B√¢tie became a marquisate in 1699.  Description  The Ch√¢teau de La B√¢tie-Seyssel comprises two fortified enceintes, surrounding a residential building. The main access is through three successive gateways. The first has kept its ogival arcade and the vault supporting the guard room. The second gateway was altered in the 17th century to a semicircular arch; it is framed by two towers. The residence is a restoration in the style of the 15th century. The chapel dates from the 15th century and houses Roman mosaics from the 4th century, discovered at Arbin. The Ch√¢teau de la B√¢tie, its terrace and the lower floor which became the great hall, the chimney in the guard room and the Gallo-Roman mosaics, were listed on 6 April 1972 as a monument historique by the French Ministry of Culture. It is private property. See also *List of castles in France  Bibliography  * Georges Chapier, Les Ch√¢teaux savoyards, √âd.

In 2013, I Am a Hero won the 58th Shogakukan Manga Award in the General category Plot Stage of the beginning of the story, Miharadai Nerima-ku, Tokyo =I Am a Hero= The story begins with Hideo Suzuki, a 35-year-old manga artist assistant, whose life seems to be stuck around his exhausting but low-paying job, unfulfilled dreams, strange hallucinations and unsatisfying relationships. He sees himself as a supporting character in his own life, and has low self-esteem, resulting in frustration. One day, the world as Hideo knows it is shattered by the presence of a disease (nicknamed ZQN) that turns people into homicidal maniacs who resemble and behave like zombies, and whose first instinct is to attack and devour the nearest human. Armed with only his sporting shotgun, he runs for his life, meeting strangers along the way. For a while, he and his companions struggle to stay alive, while questioning their moral choices. In the end, only three of them remain and drive all the way to the top of Mt. Fuji to be saved. =I Am a Hero in Osaka = I Am a Hero in Osaka is set at the beginning of the ZQN outbreak in Osaka. This manga is centered around a part-time manager named Tatsuo with a love for motorcycles and his gasoline-fueled journey to rescue his girlfriend Kozue, stranded on an airplane at Kansai International Airport, as well as Kozue's fight for survival in an increasingly hostile environment. Against sinking odds, the couple do their utmost to reunite with the other. =I Am a Hero in Ibaraki= I Am a Hero in Ibaraki is set at the beginning of the ZQN outbreak in Ibaraki. The focus of this story is about an isolated high-school student and his dog struggling to survive, not only against the ZQN, but also that of his infected family and childhood friends. =I Am a Hero in Nagasaki= I Am a Hero in Nagasaki is set at the beginning of the ZQN outbreak in Nagasaki. The manga consists of the story of Yamada, a high-school dropout turned photographer who suffers from vivid hallucinations brought upon by a form of Anthropophobia and Nirei Aya, a Ky≈´d≈ç national champion and Yamada's former classmate. The story documents their journey to Hashima Island, a perceived place of safety. However, their journey will not only be threatened by simply the ZQN, but also from their fellow humans. Characters * Hideo Suzuki: A down-on-his-luck manga artist struggling to publish his own work while maintaining both a day job as another artist's assistant and a strained relationship with his girlfriend. Hideo is slightly paranoid and mentally disturbed, often having conversations with an imaginary figure named Yajima, hallucinating the presence of faces around him, and fantasizing about how conversations with his co-workers and girlfriend should proceed. Though he was bitten on the hand by his girlfriend, the bite did not break the skin and draw blood, narrowly avoiding infection. He seems to have gained the mysterious ability to manipulate the movements of the infected like a puppeteer. After Hiromi leaves, Hideo travels into the city and gets involved in a four-way standoff between himself, the Kurusu Cult, a group of survivors, and the giant creature that Hiromi joined with. * Hayakari Hiromi: A teenage girl who is empathetic towards the undead, shown to apparently be able to kill them by giving them closure with their life. Later, she is infected but still retains most of her personality. Post infection, she loses all the superficial symptoms of the infected (protruding black veins, bloodshot eyes). She eventually has sex with Hideo before allowing the infection to take her and joins the infected hivemind, allowing herself to be consumed by a massive building sized creature, whereupon her more base desires take control and she aids the creature in its attempt to murder Hideo, since he refuses to willingly join the infected. At the last second before devouring him, however, Hiromi's original self fights its way back to the surface and she convinces the creature to let Hideo live, under the pretense of allowing him to suffer more. * Yabu Oda: A former nurse who was reduced to the role of a sex slave for the group staying at the Gotemba Premium Outlets. She escapes with Hideo and Hiromi, and she understands the significance of Hiromi's condition in potentially understanding and curing the disease. She and Hideo have sex, whereupon she discovers that she is pregnant with the child of one of the men from the outlet. She was subsequently infected by an infant and forced Hiromi to kill her and the child by crushing them in a nearby garbage truck. However, it is revealed after Hiromi joins the infected that she was subconsciously glad that she was allowed to kill Oda, since she was jealous over her and Hideo having sex. * Kurusu: The main human antagonist. The original Kurusu was a young adult who gained superhuman strength, regeneration, and speed following his infection by his mother, whom he beat to death in an online video to display his powers and how to kill the infected. He rallies disenfranchised youths via a message board to \\"create a new world\\". He was assumed to have been killed in a three-way fight with a fellow immune person known as the \\"Naked Emperor\\" and a member of his cult named Takeshi, who had gained powers similar to his own and takes over the 'Kurusu' title. He later appears to Hideo after Hideo is partially swallowed by a zombie. The new Kurusu reappears with his cult in Tokyo trying to overthrow a surviving group. * Kurusu's cult: Disenfranchised youths who communicate on message boards and worship Kurusu. They mostly stay at home until are recruited by Kurusu himself and survived the outbreak by virtue of being shut-ins. * Other than the major characters, two characters have been used to display the ZQN epidemic in other parts of the world as they and the people around them fall to the infection. Kazu, Hideo's colleague, experiences the outbreak in Taipei and is infected together with his girlfriend. Jan, a Belgian, went back to Brussels to find his son, where he suddenly lost his memory inexplicably. After travelling around, seeing several zombies and a mutated one, he ends up in the Notre- Dame-de-Lorette, and his fate is left unknown when the church is presumably destroyed by airstrikes as he begins to show signs of infection. Another sidestory follows an immune little girl in Italy who is trapped in a belltower with a group of zombies, only to be rescued by another immune man, who eats the flesh of the infected, and who takes it upon himself to protect and raise the little girl.

It has also been known as Edgley & Dawe Attractions, Edgley Ventures, and Michael Edgley International. The company is noted for bringing to Australia many foreign acts not previously seen in the country, particularly dance companies from Russia. Origins English vaudeville brothers Eric Edgley and Clem Dawe were invited to Australia in 1920 by J&N; Tait to appear in a production of Sinbad the Sailor at King's Theatre, Melbourne. Born Eric and Clem White, they changed their names in their early years to stage names, considering that \\"White\\" was uninteresting. The partnership later toured Australia for theatre manager J. C. Williamson and played in shows including Robinson Crusoe, Love Lies and So This Is Love. Eric married in 1925, was widowed in 1930 and remarried in 1940. Throughout this period he and Clem toured Australasia, the United Kingdom and South Africa, doing shows under various arrangements, and moving from performers to promoters. In 1951 they moved to Perth, Western Australia to manage His Majesty's Theatre. They took a lease on the venue in 1954 and Clem died the following year. In 1958 the company purchased His Majesty's and undertook extensive renovation work. From the early 1960s Eric arranged tours to Australasia from Russian performing troupes including the Bolshoi Ballet, the Georgian State Dance Company and the Moscow Variety Theatre. Edgley also promoted local talent including the West Australian Ballet. Eric died in 1967 and management of the company was taken over his then 23-year-old son Michael. The Moscow State Circus tour in 1968 attracted an audience of 1.2 million and grossed more than $7 million. Russian ballet and theatre ensembles returned to Australia under the Edgley banner in 1970, 1976, 1982, 1985, 1987, and 1988. Recent years Edgley now has broad interests in the film industry and venue management. Film productions include The Man From Snowy River (1982) and Phar Lap (1983).

Founded in 1898. It is one of the Roman Catholic parishes in the Diocese of Fort Wayne-South Bend. It is a central contributing property in the St. Casimir Parish Historic District. Weekend masses are at Saturday 5:00 p.m. (English, 2nd and 4th Saturdays of the month only), Sunday 9:30 a.m. (English) and 11:15 a.m. (Spanish)  History  St. Casimir Parish, South Bend, Indiana. Original St. Casimir Church and SchoolThe parish was founded in 1898 by Polish immigrants. The parish, dubbed \\"Warszawa,\\" is the second of four Polish American parishes in South Bend, Indiana. Formerly an assistant at St. Hedwig, Rev. Anthony Zubowicz, C.S.C was appointed the first pastor. The new parish started in a two-story combination church-school dedicated in March 1899. The main hall in the school building was used as a church until the present church was built in 1924. The parish is located at the corner of Dunham and Webster streets in South Bend and has been staffed since its founding by the Congregation of Holy Cross. The greatest single figure in the religious history of the Polish settlement in South Bend is undoubtedly Rev. Valentine Czyzewski, C.S.C. For 35 years he dominated the religious, social and cultural life of the Polish group, taking a hand in the organization of each new parish, founding schools and libraries, organizing missions outside the city, acting as a mediator in labor disputes involving Polish workers, and promoting the general welfare of the Poles in South Bend. On Sunday, March 13, 1893, Fr. Czyzewski announced at St. Hedwig Church that the Polish people, living on the south side of the Grand Truck Railroad tracks, should properly meet and deliberate to choose a place for a church in their neighborhood. By 1896, the neighborhood had grown and Fr. Czyzewski allowed a committee to form to start the new parish. At a meeting on February 10 of that year, Frank Gonsiorowski was elected President of this committee and Joseph Kalamaja its Secretary. On March 2, 1896, Bishop Joseph Rademacher viewed the proposed site from his horse-drawn carriage and said: \\"This is a beautiful location for a parish, you have my permission.\\" Construction of the combined school and church was begun in April 1898 with the laying of the cornerstone. Rev. Anthony Zubowicz, C.S.C. was appointed the first pastor of the parish on June 11, 1898. Masses were held at St. Hedwig Church for a short time. On March 4, 1999, the new church was blessed and the first mass celebrated. 3rd and 4th grades in 1908 Two Sisters of the Holy Family of Nazareth The parish grade school was opened in 1899. The Congregation of the Sisters of the Holy Family of Nazareth agreed to staff the school. By 1910 the enrollment reached 600 in grades 1 through 8. Children attended morning mass and classes during weekdays. Classes were conducted in Polish and English. Since the children lived in the neighborhood, they walked to school and returned home during the lunch hour before returning for afternoon classes. Children also attended the Sunday morning children's mass, where they sat with their class and were quizzed afterwards by the priest. On June 30, 1913, Fr. Czyzewski, the Pastor of St. Hedwig and leading Polish priest in South Bend and in the Corgregation of Holy Cross, died. With his death, Rev. Zubowicz was moved to St. Hedwig Parish, South Bend, Indiana to replace him. Meanwhile, in the nearby parish of St. Adalbert, discontent had grown with the pastor, Rev. John Kubacki. Fr. Kubacki's hated alcohol and tobacco and went to extremes to keep these evils out of his parish. A group of parishioners broke with St. Adalbert, formed a committee at the end of June 1913 and purchased land for a new Polish National Catholic Church. Shortly thereafter, Rev. W.T. Szalewski, C.S.C., was named pastor of St. Casimir. There was serious resentment and opposition to this choice because he had barred uniformed members of the Polish Falcons of America from a funeral a few years before and because the Parish Council had asked that the Assistant Pastor and parish favorite, Rev. Leon P. Szybowicz, C.S.C., be named as Pastor. In October 1913, Rev. Szalewski left the parish due to continuing harassment by discontented St. Casimir parishioners and members of the newly formed Polish National Church parish. Rev. Szybowicz was also removed by Rev. Andrew Morrissey, C.S.C., the Provincial of the Congregation of Holy Cross, because he had encouraged parishioners to push for his appointment as Pastor. The parish remained closed from October 1913 to February 1914. The Bishop of the diocese, Herman Joseph Alerding, did not seem to take sides in the dispute; leading many parishioners to believe that Bishop Alerding was quietly taking their side. These tense circumstances of the dispute between the parishioners and church authority led to an event on Feb. 15, 1914 at the parish that was later named \\"Krwawa Niedziela\\" or \\"Bloody Sunday.\\" On that Sunday morning, Rev. Stanislaus Gruza, C.S.C., arrived at St. Casimir and was met by a crowd of opponents. Rev. Gruza had to be both assigned by the Provincial and appointed by the Bishop. A riot ensued when the priest arrived to begin his duties. A crowd of more than 1,000 people repulsed a squad of 23 police when they attempted to install Rev. Stanislaus Gruza, C.S.C in the rectory of the parish. Numerous people were injured in the melee. After the riot, Bishop Herman Joseph Alerding obtained a restraining order against the trustees of St. Casmir church for refusing Father Gruza admittance to the church; 28 people were arrested on various charges. In late March, Fr. Gruza was allowed to take possession of the parish but many parishioners vowed not to cooperate with him. The legal problems were settled and criminal charges dropped in the following months. In the summer of 1915, Rev. Gruza quietly left the parish and was replaced by Rev. Stanislaus Gorka, C.S.C. as Pastor without any opposition. The memory of the riot saddened Rev. Gruza and stayed with him all his life. Although Bishop Alerding remained above the dispute until just prior to the riot, afterwards he was blamed by the parishioners for not making his intentions known and not meeting with them. The parish was rebuilt under the leadership of Rev. Stanislaus Gorka, C.S.C. Perhaps because the dispute was limited to less than two years, most of the disgruntled parishioners returned. In the 1920s, a new church was built at the corner of Dunham and Webster Streets. This lot which was the site of much of the violence in 1914, now held the parish's greatest pride and joy. The church was blessed by the new Bishop, John F. Noll, O.D. on November 15, 1925. Most of the men of the parish were factory workers. Within one mile of the parish were Studebaker Automobile Corporation which employed 26,000 workers in the 1920s, Oliver Farm Equipment Company with about 3000 workers and several other factories plus many shops and businesses. With the bank crises of 1931 and 1932, unemployment soared and parish finances were bleak until the 1940s. Fr. Gorka often had hundreds of dollars in bills and no money to pay them. He would go to small groceries and shops in the neighborhood, because they had at least a little cash, and ask for small donations. In 1949 the parish celebrated its golden jubilee. Since the debt on the church was recently paid off, the church was consecrated by Most Rev. Roman R. Atkielski, Auxiliary Bishop of Milwaukee, on May 4, 1949. At this time, the school had 290 students. At least 20 clubs and societies were dedicated to church service, spirituality, youths and teenagers, athletics, drama and literature and civic improvement. Statue of St. Casimir at St. Casimir Parish, South Bend. Behind the statue, the former rectory, now convent of Felician Sisters is seen. Since the 1960s, the ethnic makeup of the neighborhood slowly changed from mostly Polish to a mixture of Mexican, Polish, black and others. Also the population of the city declined with smaller households and more empty lots. In 1975, Rev. Leo Wojciechowski, C.S.C. closed the parish school over the strong objections of many parishioners. The school had 156 students at that time but Fr. Wojciechowski did not see a future in the increasingly Hispanic enrollment. In 1994, pastoral leadership of St. Casimir Parish was consolidated with that of St. Stephen Parish, South Bend; this meant that the same priests would serve both parishes with Rev. Thomas Lemos, C.S.C. as pastor. From February 27, 1997 through March 8, 1998, the parish celebrated its centennial year. The year included, eucharistic processions, parade floats, festivals, a school reunion, and other parties. The year long festivities opened and closed with the annual 40-hour eucharistic devotion held near St. Casimir's feast day on March 4. In 2003, St. Stephen Parish was suppressed and merged with St. Adalbert Parish, South Bend. St. Casimir Parish has since shared its Pastor and priests with St. Adalbert Parish with the rectory being at St. Adalbert. In 2005, a Spanish language mass was added and welcomed. This mass is now the source of increasing membership and vitality in the parish. Since 2005, the former rectory is now a convent for the Felician Sisters. In 2009, the parish office of St. Adalbert Parish and St. Casimir Parish were combined into a joint facility at St. Adalbert Parish. The current pastor, Rev. Paul Ybarra, C.S.C. was appointed July 1, 2016.  Architecture  Nave of St. Casimir Church. Images of St. Casimir, Christ the King, and St. Stanislaus Kostka are painted on the aspe above the main altar. The church was designed by the architecture firm of Worthmann and Steinbach in the Polish Cathedral architectural style. It has Romanesque architecture with Italianate chandeliers. With the arcades running along both sides of the nave and the large arch framing the main altar, the church is remiminiscence of St. Paul's Within the Walls in Rome. Main Altar and Sanctuary The exterior is red brick in a traditional Polish style. Because of the beautiful and sophisticated design, St. Casimir church building was given the highest historical architectural ranking by the Historic Preservation Commission that possibly can be assigned - 13 of 13. There are only a few buildings in all of South Bend that have this designation.  Culture  St. Casimir celebrates its Polish American heritage in numerous ways. An annual celebration of Micholaj, a special Polish dinner feast. On the Eve of the Feast of St. Nicholas, the parish celebrates with pierogi, noodles, roast beef, herring, paczkis, and breads. After the meal, parishioners sing \\"kolendy,\\" that is, Christmas carols. Then, St. Nicholas pays a visit to the children, bringing fruit, candy, and prayer cards. St. Casimir annually celebrates Forty Hours' Devotion for the feast of its patron saint on March 4. .  Pastors  * Rev. Anthony Zubowicz, C.S.C. (July,1898‚ÄìApril 1899) * Rev.

History Badenoch is a traditionally strong area of shinty with Kingussie Camanachd and Newtonmore Camanachd Clubs being strong forces in the men's game. However, there was no permamanet presence for women's shinty in the area after the shortlived Kingussie women's team folded in 2004 until the B&S; was set up in 2008. The club uses both of the male team's grounds and is therefore not affiliated with one club in particular. The club has swiftly developed and has provided internationalists to the Scottish Women's Team. The club has won a lot of trophies and plaudits in a short time. The club stepped up to the National Division in 2010 and performed admirably despite finishing fourth out of four teams. The club dropped into the North Division Two and although they were very strong, they still required a play-off to win the division in March 2012 against Glengarry's second team. B&S; had already secured promotion to the National League as Glengarry were ineligible for promotion due to their first team already playing in the league. In the 2013 Valerie Fraser Trophy Final, against a highly fancied Glasgow Mid Argyll side, B&S; upset the odds with a 3-1 victory, capped by the winning goal of Jane Nicol who had helped set up the club in the final game of her career.

Prior to his political career, he was a central figure in the pre-war Mitsui zaibatsu and president of Oji Paper.  Biography  Fujiwara was born in Kamiminochi District, Nagano, currently part of Nagano city, where his father, a farmer, was also a trader in indigo and thus the wealthiest man in the village. Fujiwara originally intended to become a medical doctor, and travelled to Tokyo at the age of 16. However, on graduation from a school affiliated with Keio University, he found employment at the Matsui Shimpo newspaper instead, rising to the position of editor-in-chief. When the newspaper was in severe financial difficulties, he also assumed the post of president, but was unable to prevent it from falling into bankruptcy. In 1895, through the introduction of one of his former classmates, Fujiwara was hired by the Mitsui Bank. One of his close colleagues was Shigeaki Ikeda. He rose rapidly through the ranks, working at the branch office at Otsu, Shiga, and was assistant manager of a branch in Fukagawa, Tokyo. He was then appointed manager of the Tomioka silk mill, which was under Mitsui ownership. Under his management, he resolved labor dispute issues by a combination of wage increases and improved working conditions through negotiations. Due to his success at the Tomioka Silk Mill, he was called in to assume management of Oji Paper, when its workers went on strike in 1898; however, this time he was not as successful and had to call in workers from Fuji Paper (also owned by Mitsui) to break the strike. In 1899, he was transferred to Mitsui & Co., where he was made vice-manager of the company branch in Shanghai. He remained in Shanghai over ten years, becoming branch manager, and also director of procurement for wood. He returned to Oji Paper as vice-president in 1911, at a time when Oji Paper was in severe financial difficulties. Fujiwara turned the company around by replacing managers suspected of embezzlement, purchasing the latest production equipment from Europe, and suing major debtors who were delinquent on payments. In 1929, Fujiwara was appointed to a seat in the Upper House of the Diet of Japan. In 1933, he merged Oji Paper with Fuji Paper and Karafuto Industries, a paper company based in Karafuto to form New Oji Paper, with a market share of over 80%. He resigned his position as president of the new company in 1938 to become chairman of the board. The same year, he established a private university in Yokohama, of the Fujiwara Institute of Technology, to train engineers and managerial talent. The university is now the Faculty of Engineering of Keio University. In 1940, he was asked to join the cabinet of Mitsumasa Yonai as Minister of Commerce and Industry. In 1942, he was nominated a special advisor to the cabinet of Prime Minister T≈çj≈ç, with oversight over naval procurement, and in 1943 joined the T≈çj≈ç cabinet as a minister without portfolio. In 1944, under T≈çj≈ç‚Äôs successor, Kuniaki Koiso, he became Minister of Munitions. With the war situation quickly becoming critical, Fujiwara devoted his efforts to increasing the production of aircraft to defend Japan against the increasing Allied bombing attacks. He was astonished to find that aircraft built at Mitsubishi‚Äôs Nagoya works were being transported to the nearest airfields by ox cart.Yoshimura, Akira (1996) Zero Fighter. Greenwood Publishing Group, , p. 167 Following the end of World War II, Fujiwara, along with all other members of the former Japanese government were arrested by the Supreme Commander of the Allied Powers and was held in Sugamo Prison on war crime charges, but his case was dropped soon after. In 1959, he turned over much of his private fortune to a charitable foundation, the Fujiwara Foundation of Science. The Foundation awards the Fujiwara Prize to scientists who have made important contributions to the advancement of science and technology. Fujiwara died of a stroke in 1960. He was posthumously awarded the Order of the Rising Sun, 1st class. His grave is at the Tsukiji Hongan-ji in Tokyo.Ginjiro \\"The Paper Manufacturing King of Japan\\" Fujiwara.

(2010). Flabellina salmonacea (Couthouy, 1838). Accessed through: World Register of Marine Species on 2011-01-17 Distribution This species occurs in the Arctic seas; (Greenland, Iceland, Spitsbergen, North Pacific (Bering Strait, Point Barrow, Alaska, British Columbia), the Western Atlantic (Cape Cod (Mass.) north to Halifax (Nova Scotia)) and the Eastern Atlantic and northern European waters (north coast of Norway). Description The white, translucent, broad body of this species reaches a length between 25 and 50 mm, and ends in a thin, tapered tail. The cerata are swollen with a thin orange or pink digestive gland duct. There are opaque white markings at the tips of the cerata and on the outer parts of the rhinophores and oral tentacles. An orange color variation may occur, caused by a diet of anemones rather than ascidians. This was previously considered to be a distinct species, Coryphella stimpsoni.Shepard, A., 2006 (Mar 31) Sea Slug Forum : Color variation in Flabellina salmonacea; accessed : 17 January 2011 The maximum recorded length is 50 mm.  Ecology  These sea slugs can be found consuming the colonial tunicate Amaroucium constellatum Verrill, 1871 which is an unusual diet for an aeolid nudibranch. Juveniles have been found feeding on hydroids, especially Tubularia.Rudman, W.B., 2001 (June 18) Flabellina salmonacea (Cuthouy, 1838). [In] Sea Slug Forum. Australian Museum, Sydney. The salmon aeolis, like other nudibranchs, is a simultaneous hermaphrodite with reciprocal mating and sperm storage. They lay their eggs in a long, twisted, gelatinous mass.

The novel is set in East Berlin in the real-life street of Sonnenallee sometime in the late-1970s or early-1980s. The film Sonnenallee, also written by Brussig, is based upon the same characters, but depicts a significantly different storyline.http://www.literaturkritik.de/public/rezension.php?rez_id=668 Unusual is the fact that the screenplay for Sonnenallee served as the basis for the novel, rather than the other way around. Themes of the Novel The story is centered on the main character fifteen-year-old Michael \\"Micha\\" Kuppisch who lives with his parents and siblings, Sabine and Bernd, in a typical East Berlin flat. The story gives a nostalgic yet ironic outlook of living in the shorter end of Sonnenallee, a street which was divided during the creation of the German Democratic Republic, next to the Berlin Wall where the house numbering is comically told to start at number 379. Much of the story is based around Micha's love for the girl Miriam, another Sonnenallee resident, and the day-to-day lives of Micha and his friends. Another prominent character is Uncle Heinz, Micha's uncle from West Berlin. The character shows how many living in West Berlin had a tainted, sympathetic and often condescending view on life on the other side of the wall. Uncle Heinz often smuggles small gifts for the Kuppisch family on his trips, despite the fact that everything he \\"smuggles\\" is, in fact, legal to bring into the GDR. Throughout the story there is much focus on low-level rebellion by Micha and his friends, such as Wuschel's desire to listen to illegal music such as the Rolling Stones.

In pre-internet era the tenders were published only in the print media but the internet has made it possible to publish the tenders online and make these opportunities available to suppliers globally, on a click of mouse. Though some countries have moved completely to online publication of tender notification, but still there are many countries which are publishing tenders in print media as well. It depends upon the commitment and preparedness of the leadership to make the public procurement efficient and corruption free. The World Bank started bench- marking economies on the basis of legal and regulatory system, which can affect the ability of the suppliers to participate in public procurement process. The latest report from The World Bank - Bench-marking Public Procurement, 2017 assesses 180 economies around the world. Availability of tender notification on internet gave the birth to tender aggregators. The tender aggregation industry can broadly be divided in two types. One those who collects, collates and process the information from within the country and for the consumption of the suppliers from the same country. The other type is those who collect the tender notification from across the globe and make it available to all suppliers including from their home country.A tender aggregator addresses various challenges like:non availability of data in a structured format, multiple languages and terminologies etc. By making the tender notification information available to a wider supplier community, the tender aggregator plays an important role in making Public Procurement efficient and transparent, thus helping procurement entities spend tax payers' money judiciously. Types of notifications =Direct= These are normally opportunities that are sent direct from the system they were created on. For example, if a government institution used a certain brand of tendering software, then this brand would also offer a tender service to notify the user of tenders on that specific system. =Repacks= Repacks are normally provided by external organizations and software as a service providers. Feeds from multiple sources are combined, collated and then sent out. The aim of repacks is normally to give the supplier as many opportunities as possible on a daily basis. Normally where feeds from multiple sources are combined, collated and then sent out. The aim is obvious here, to give the supplier as many opportunities as possible on a daily basis. However, due to the information often being second or third hand, some data can be lost in the process, or may become inaccurate as it is passed down the line. The collated information tends include a range of sectors, from construction to healthcare tenders. Similar processes A request for tender and request for quotation is a closed tender where people are invited by a buyer to quote for specific work. A tender notification alerts potential suppliers of open tenders that they then have to register interest in before entering the tendering process. Invitation to tender is also a similar process to a tender notification. The major difference is the institution or organisation who created the tender chooses whom to invite, often in the form of a closed tender where they can then publish a Voluntary Ex-Ante Transparency Notice (VEAT) for transparency. Tender notification services provide a vast array of people and companies about an open tender that anyone can apply for. Benefits Tender notifications (sometimes called tender alerts), provide the client with given tender information that they desire. This is often delivered in the form of an email notification, saving the client visiting multiple websites to check for updates on potential clients. Most repacks provide both private and public sector tender opportunities. The idea is that tender notification systems deliver tender opportunities to the company, dramatically reducing the amount of time spent looking for these tenders.

It is located north of Williams Bay, Wisconsin, in the Town of Geneva, Wisconsin. It was closed in 1960. History In late 1951 Air Defense Command selected Elkhorn, Wisconsin site as one of twenty-eight radar stations built as part of the second segment of the permanent radar surveillance network. Prompted by the start of the Korean War, on July 11, 1950, the Secretary of the Air Force asked the Secretary of Defense for approval to expedite construction of the second segment of the permanent network. Receiving the Defense Secretary's approval on July 21, the Air Force directed the Corps of Engineers to proceed with construction. On 27 November 1950 the 755th Aircraft Control and Warning Squadron began operating a pair of AN/CPS-6B radars at the site, designated LP-31. The site was renamed Williams Bay Air Force Station on 1 December 1953, and initially the station functioned as a Ground-Control Intercept (GCI) and warning station. As a GCI station, the squadron's role was to guide interceptor aircraft toward unidentified intruders picked up on the unit's radar scopes. An AN/FPS-6 height-finder radar was added in 1959. In addition to the main facility, Williams Bay operated the following AN/FPS-18 Gap Filler sites: * Monee, IL (RP-31D) Williams Bay ceased operations in January 1960 as a budget reduction move, the mission and organization being transferred to the existing United States Army Arlington Heights facility C-80DC for the Nike Missile air-defense system, as part of the Chicago-Gary Defense Area. Approximately one acre, located in the southwest corner of the Air Force Station property, was retained by the Air Force as a Gap Filler site (RP-31F) for Arlington Heights, although it is unclear if any FPS-18 radars were installed. Most of the station was excessed to the General Service Administration, which sold it to the State of Wisconsin in 1962, and used as a Prisoner Re-Release minimum security prison on the site until 1972. The Gap Filler Annex was declared excess on 4 January 1968, and sold to private ownership on 5 November 1969. In 1974, the State sold the site to private interests, currently operating it as the Williams Bay Industrial Park, using some of the old USAF buildings. The former family housing units are maintained as private residences. Several auto junkyards are also on the former Air Force property. There is a small Wisconsin Historical Society Marker on the former air force station honoring the 755th AC&W; Squadron.

An industrial landscape shaped by mining and surrounded by the mythical landscapes of Harz and Kyffh√§user. His father Wilhelm Schleef was an architect, his mother Gertrud Schleef worked as a seamstress. He had one sibling, Hans Schleef.  Career  Einar Schleef started to train as a painter while he was still in school. He attended a socialist painting circle led by Wilhelm Schmied from 1958 onwards. In 1964 he started a degree in fine arts at the arts academy in Berlin Wei√üensee. After being expelled in 1965 Schleef switched to set design two years later and finished with a bachelor's degree in 1973.

Traglehn (\\"Katzgraben\\" in 1972, \\"Fr√ºhlings Erwachen\\" in 1974, \\"Fr√§ulein Julie\\" in 1975). Even though artistically successful Schleef was put under more and more political pressure. In 1976 he left East Germany and via Vienna finally settled down in West Germany. From now on Schleef produced more and more text.

He also wrote plays, radio plays and more fiction. From 1978 to 1982 he studied film making at the DFFB in West Berlin. Schleef returned to theatre in 1985 when he became a steady director at Schauspiel Frankfurt. In the following 5 years he developed his theatre vision. He re-introduced the choir as a dramatis person√¶ and celebrated the tragic potential of the classic, ancient text. This theatre work was controversially received, audiences as well as critics varied between harsh criticism and very positive feedback.\\"Das ist doch kein Theater\\" Martin Wuttke and Carl Hegemann, In: Einar Schleef Arbeitsbuch, Berlin, 2002, page 192-195 Through the 1990s he continued to produce a number of successful and influential productions such as ‚ÄúWessis in Weimar‚Äù by Rolf Hochhuth in 1993 at the Berliner Ensemble. ‚ÄúPuntila‚Äù by Bertolt Brecht in 1995 at the Berliner Ensemble.

He was three times Champion Jockey and three times Grand National winner. His son, (Ernest) Keith Piggott (1904‚Äì1993), was also a leading jump jockey and National-winning trainer, while his grandson is the 11-times British flat racing Champion Jockey, Lester Piggott. Jockey Championships Piggott began his English riding career in the late 1890s but from 1905 was based for several years in Belgium and France. He was champion jockey in France before returning to England where he won the 1910 British jump jockey championship with 67 winners. At the time this was the joint- record number of winners, although it was superseded the following year. His two other championships came in 1913 and 1915. Grand National His first Grand National victory came in 1912 on 4/1 joint favourite, Jerry M, trained by Robert Gore and owned by Sir Charles Assheton-Smith. Although this trainer- owner pair won the following year's National with Covertcoat, Piggott was not on board, and it wasn't until 1918, when the Grand National was held at Gatwick (as Aintree had been commandeered by the War Office) that Piggott got a follow-up success with Poethlyn. The same horse gave him his third and final National victory back at Aintree in 1919 when it went off 11/4 favourite, the shortest priced winner in the history of the race. In so doing, he became the first jockey to win three Grand Nationals since Arthur Nightingall in 1901. Piggott also notably rode the 14-year-old Manifesto into third place in the 1902 National under a weight of . This made it the oldest horse ever to have been placed in the National up to that point, and it remains the only horse ever to have been placed carrying such a weight.

It applies to England and Wales and creates criminal offences pertaining to attempting to commit crimes. It abolished the common law offence of attempt.Section 6 Provisions =Attempting to commit an offence= Section 1(1) of the Act creates the offence of attempt: Section 1 applies to any indictable offence triable in England and Wales, except conspiracy, aiding and abetting, and offences under sections 4 and 5 of the Criminal Law Act 1967 (which deal with assisting offenders and concealing information about crimes).Section 1(4) Section 1(2) reads: Section 1(3) states that a person is to be judged according to what the defendant thought the facts of the case were at the time of the attempt, rather than what the facts really were, in the event that the defendant was mistaken about what was happening. Section 2 states that rules regarding time limits for prosecuting, powers of arrest and search, and so on, are the same for offences of attempting to commit an offence as they are for the offence attempted. Section 3 provides that where another Act creates an offence of attempting to commit an offence under that Act, similar rules apply to that offence as the rules in section 1 (unless the other Act specifically says otherwise). Section 4 generally sets the penalties for attempting to commit an offence as the same as the offence attempted. The only exception today is murder, which carries a mandatory sentence of life imprisonment, whereas section 4 makes the sentence for attempted murder discretionary (up to a maximum of life imprisonment). Historically, offences under the Sexual Offences Act 1956 (repealed in 2004) were exempt from section 4, and attempts to commit sexual offences sometimes carried lower sentences than the completed offence. For example, rape was punishable with life imprisonment, but attempted rape carried a maximum of seven years, until the 1956 Act was amended by the Sexual Offences Act 1985. =Other offences= The Act abolished the offence of \\"loitering with intent\\" under the Vagrancy Act 1824.Section 8 Section 9 creates a summary offence called \\"vehicle interference.\\" This is committed by interfering with a motor vehicle or trailer, or anything in the vehicle or trailer, with intent to steal it or anything in it. It carries a maximum sentence of three months.

TPM is a \\"manager of managers\\", in that it does not manage any hardware itself, but issues commands to the hypervisors that do actually manage the hardware. TPM can orchestrate the various tasks, and provide a common interface for different platforms, notably Intel-based managed by VMware to host MS-Windows and Linux virtual servers; and IBM's own AIX servers running on pSeries.  History  TPM originated with Think Dynamics which IBM acquired in 2003.IBM grabs Think Dynamics Their \\"Think Control\\" product was good in provisioning and managing (virtual) servers in data centers. IBM added their \\"OPAL\\" Integrated Service Management Library, and marketed their new product as \\"Tivoli Intelligent Orchestrator\\" - hence the appearance of the letters \\"tio\\" in many product files of TPM. While TIO appears to not have been a huge success, IBM spun off the deployment engine as a product of itself. * v4: combined with the aging \\"ITCM\\" desktop management suite, was marketed as \\"TPM for Software\\" * v5: general provisioning resources * there appears not to have been a v6 * v7.2: has many improvements; most notably, the workflows are no longer extracted from the DCM database and executed line by line, but are converted to Java and run from bytecode, which is much faster.  Working  = Data Center Model = TPM works from an extensive Data Center Model that contains all server- and software-components, with their attributes and relations. As of v7.1, this is part of the Maximo database (maxdb71). = WorkFlows = All TPM's actions are executed by WorkFlows. These are written in a proprietary interpreted procedural scripting language. Most information must be drawn through queries from the DCM. Most string manipulation must be done by Jython calls - because both the WorkFlow interpreter and Jython parse, interpret, and manipulate these strings, great care must be taken in writing them. Actions on server systems are done through scriptlets, which generate (shell) scripts that are executed on the target servers. = Developing = For developing TPM workflows, one needs the so-called Automation Package Development Environment (APDE): this is the Eclipse Integrated Development Environment with a special TPM plugin. It needs to be configured to have access to the DCM database: all workflow code is stored by line in the database.

It is also used for conducting risk assessments of complex dynamic systems evolving over time.

EU 6th framework program. To facilitate the use of Ecolego in the field of radiology, specialized databases and other add-ons have been developed. For example, all radionuclides and their decay products have been integrated in the software. History Ecolego was co-founded by Swedish Radiation Safety Authority (SSM) Swedish Radiation Protection Authority Further AMBER and Ecolego Inter- comparisons SKI Report 2004:05 SSI Report 2004:01 , ‚Äò‚ÄôAMBER and Ecolego Intercomparisons using Calculations from SR 97 SKI Report 2003:28‚Äô‚Äô, SSI report 2003:11 , the authority in Sweden responsible for the regulation of radioactive waste management and disposal, and NRPA the Norwegian Radiation Protection Authority , the Norwegian Radiation Protection Authority. The software was initially developed as a complimentary user interface to create compartmental models in Simulink. Simulink had very powerful and fast solvers for ordinary differential equations, but lacked support for running probabilistic simulations and handling of parameter values. Also, Simulink is very detailed ‚Äì every equation is modeled by graphically operator blocks‚Äì making modeling time consuming and prone to mistakes. By relying on Simulink for simulations, full attention could be given to the development of an advanced user interface. As more and more features where added to Ecolego, the need for an integrated simulation engine grew. With the release of Ecolego 4 in 2008, a set of state-of-the-art solvers was incorporated and thus removed the dependence of Simulink. Today, SSM uses Ecolego for the review of SKB's the Swedish Nuclear Waste Management Company (the Swedish Nuclear Waste Management Company) license application for the siting and construction of a repository for the final disposal of spent nuclear fuel in Sweden. Releases December 2003: the first version, Ecolego 1.0, was released. In this early version, the software was dependent on Matlab/Simulink to perform simulations. February 2006: Ecolego 2.1 was released. The user interface of Ecolego was completely remade, and now used a tiling window manager to improve model transparency. 2007: Ecolego 3 was released. Ecolego now featured a crude integrated calculation engine, reducing the dependence on Matlab/Simulink. The support for probabilistic analysis was greatly improved. A built-in database for parameter values and radionuclide properties was added. Support for hierarchical containers. 2008: Ecolego 4 was released. Ecolego 4 now incorporated state-of-the-art solvers for ordinary differential equations, making Matlab/Simulink redundant. The user interface was improved with many new windows for navigation, report generation and presentation of simulation results. Copy/paste functionality was added. Fall of 2009: the current version of Ecolego, Ecolego 5, was released. Ecolego 5 added many features, such as unit checking, sub-version support and a model component library. The sensitivity analysis where extended, and a toolbox for advanced sensitivity analysis was created (see EIKOS). Modeling environment Screen-shot illustrating the use of interaction matrices to build models. Screen-shot of the simulation interface in Ecolego. The initial idea of Ecolego was to facilitate creation of large and complex models and to be able to solve difficult numerical problems. With the purpose to make complicated models with many interconnections easier to overview, the models in Ecolego are represented with the help of interaction matrices instead of the traditional flow diagrams. Combined with hierarchical containers (sub-systems), the interaction matrix greatly facilitates construction and documentation of large and complex models. Objects can be assigned comments, images, units, and hyper links to other documents or Ecolego objects. Ecolego can also create reports that contain everything from interaction matrices, to parameter values, equations, decay chains, plots and tables. The report can be saved in many different formats, including PDF and HTML. In order to increase the flexibility for the user, Ecolego has no restrictions on the order of creation ‚Äì for instance, a parameter can be used in equations before it is defined. A real-time validation engine reports problems to the user, such as not-yet- defined objects, objects lacking values or having invalid equations. =Quality assurance= Modules can be created by defining inputs and outputs for sub-systems. By adding modules to the integrated library, a user can create a palette of validated building blocks that can be combined to form new models. The library can be exported, so that users with Ecolego Player can use it to create models without the need of an Ecolego license. Several other features in Ecolego promote quality assurance: * Unit checking * Version handling of models through subversion * Parameter databases (internal or external) * Integrated database for radionuclide properties =Simulations= The typical Ecolego model is a compartmental model which requires a solver of differential equations. There is a wide array of numerical solvers to choose from. Some are optimized for stiff and numerically difficult models, others for trivial models. With an extensive list of probability density functions, together with Monte Carlo and Latin hypercube sampling and parameter correlation settings, Ecolego holds all the required tools to perform advanced probabilistic analysis. Ecolego Player The Ecolego Player interface. Ecolego Player Ecolego Player is a free software tool that makes it possible to perform calculations with Ecolego models without having access to Ecolego. The software features the same functionality as Ecolego, with the exception that the integral structure of the model cannot be changed. However, with a module library created in Ecolego, the user can assemble models by combining components from the library. Ecolego Sensitivity Analysis Toolbox (Eikos) Screen-shot of the GUI of Eikos.

Biography Brooke was born in Liverpool in 1791. His father, also named Richard, was a Cheshire man, who settled in Liverpool early in life, and died there on 15 June 1852, at the age of 91. Brooke practised as a solicitor in Liverpool. Brooke devoted his leisure time to investigations into the history and antiquities of his county, and into certain branches of natural history. He began this pursuit at a comparatively early age, during visits to his brother, Peter, who resided near Stoke Field. He particularly focused on exploring fields of battle in England, especially those which were the scenes of conflict between the rival houses of York and Lancaster. Brooke's primary research goal was to compare the statements of the historians with such relics as had survived and with the traditions of the neighbourhoods where the respective battles had been fought. Brookes died in Liverpool on 14 June 1861. Publications In 1825 he published Observations illustrative of the Accounts given by the Ancient Historical Writers of the Battle of Stoke Field, between King Henry the Seventh and John de la Pole, Earl of Lincoln, in 1487, the last that was fought in the Civil Wars of York and Lancaster; to which are added some interesting particulars of the Illustrious Houses of Plantagenet and Neville (Liverpool, 1825, roy. 8vo). In later years he carried on his researches, and communicated the result to the Society of Antiquaries, of which he was a member, and to the Liverpool Literary and Philosophical Society, in papers which were subsequently published in a volume in 1857, entitled Visits to Fields of Battle in England in the Fifteenth Century. To which are added some Miscellaneous Tracts and Papers upon Arch√¶ological Subjects (8vo). The battlefields described are Shrewsbury, Blore Heath, Northampton, Wakefield, Mortimer's Cross, Towton, Tewkesbury, Bosworth, Stoke, Evesham, and Barnet. The additional papers published in that volume are: * On the Use of Firearms by the English in the 15th Century. * The Family of Wyche, or De la Wyche, in Cheshire. * Wilmslow Church in Cheshire. * Handford Hall and Cheadle Church in Cheshire. * The Office of Keeper of the Royal Menagerie in the Reign of Edward IV. * The Period of the Extinction of Wolves in England. The following, in addition to some of those named above, are printed in the Proceedings of the Liverpool Literary and Philosophical Society: * Upon the extraordinary and abrupt Changes of Fortune of Jasper, earl of Pembroke, vol. x. * Life of Richard Neville, the Great Earl of Warwick and Salisbury, called the King Maker, xii. * Life and Character of Margaret of Anjou, xiii. * Visit to Fotheringay Church and Castle, xiii. * Migration of the Swallow, xiii. * On the Elephants used in War by the Carthaginians, xiv. * On the Common or Fallow Deer of Great Britain, xiv. In the Transactions of the Historic Society of Lancashire and Cheshire he published Observations on the Inscription of the Common Seal of Liverpool (i. 76), besides the three Cheshire papers reprinted in the volume of visits. In 1853, he published Liverpool as it was during the Last Quarter of the Eighteenth Century, 1775 to 1800 (Liverpool, roy. 8vo, pp. 558). Much of the information in it came from Brooke's father.

Briedis' upbringing, particularly his mother's influence, engendered in him a devout nature. He graduated with distinction from the local rural district (pagastsWhen translated as \\"parish\\" in English, \\"pagasts\\" refers to local rural organization as found in England by that name, unrelated to religion.) and local congregational church schools. He left his family home in 1902, traveling to Daugavpils, where he moved in with relatives and entered the six-year city school. A consistently excellent student, he devoted his spare time furthering his religious studies, tutoring to buy books, hoping one day to become a minister‚Äîhis goal to battle the moral decay which deeply affected him at the time of the Russo-Japanese War. By his own admission, he had time for few, if any, friends. Finished with school, Briedis determined to enter the Monastery at Belye Berega. Having arrived at the rail station, nearly at his destination, he encountered two inebriated monks. A shocked Briedis renounced any thought of entering the priesthood‚Äîhe held boozing to be the most vile immorality and would have no truck with any who engaged in it. To fill the void, in 1905, Briedis found a new calling‚Äîthe military. Military service =Russian Army units= In 1906 he was accepted into the St.Petersburg's Vladimir War School. Due to his excellent tactical knowledge he reached the rank of Senior sergeant by his last year at the school. Briedis graduated from the war school with the rank of Podporuchik, and afterwards he served in the 99th Ivangorod infantry regiment, which was deployed in Daugavpils. In 1912 he attained the rank of Poruchik and was appointed the company's Commander. He participated in World War I, initially serving in East Prussia, where he successfully led reconnaissance patrols and received numerous awards for valor and his accomplishments. Fridrihs Briedis presents awards to his soldiers. (1916) =Latvian Riflemen= When the formation of the Latvian Riflemen battalions begun in 1915 he was appointed to command the 1st Daugavgrƒ´va battalion. He and his men participated in battles near the Misa River, and near ƒ∂ekava. In March 1916 Briedis was severely wounded in the jaw, but he recovered and participated in the Christmas Battles as commander of a battalion. During the Christmas Battles he fought in Tƒ´reƒºpurvs, where he was wounded for a second time. Briedis was in hospital when the February Revolution broke out, triggering the collapse of the army. Many riflemen joined the Red Army, but Briedis was among those who refused to do so. In 1918 he joined an anti-bolshevist conspiracy in Moscow. On July 23, 1918, he was arrested by the Cheka, and on August 27, 1918, he was executed in Moscow by firing squad. He received all classes of the Order of LƒÅƒçplƒìsis for his valor in the Christmas Battles, and for participation in almost all the rifleman's operations on the Riga front. In Riga there is also street named in his name  References in popular culture  Latvian pagan metal band Skyforger has a song Pulkvedis Briedis (Colonel Briedis) dedicated to Frƒ´drihs Briedis. It is included in the Latvian rifleman album.

In Afrikaans this plant species is known as bergseldery (i.e., \\"mountain celery\\"). The plant is in the family Apiaceae, subfamily Apioideae. Although it is in the same family as edible plants such as the carrot and herbs such as fennel and dill, it is not edible and touching it can cause severe blistering particularly if the irritant chemicals are exposed to sunlight (phytophotodermatitis). Appearance The blister bush's leaves look like flat-leaved parsley or celery. The mildly glaucous, evergreen foliage is arranged around the heads of the plant's upright branches. Typically a small shrub, the blister bush can reach a maximum height of around 2.5 metres. The flower head has a very green and slightly yellow appearance and is made up of many tiny yellow flowers that occur in large green compound umbels from October to February. The umbel gives off flat winged seeds. Distribution and habitat The blister bush is native to the Table Mountain and western Cape Fold Belt region of the Western Cape in South Africa. It is usually found at medium- to high-altitudes in partially shady and damp areas but will also grow at lower altitudes and in areas of direct sunshine. The plant grows in the winter rainfall areas, which are relatively frost-free and have well-drained soils. Distribution of Notobubon galbanum across the Western Cape, South Africa. Effects on the body The surface of the plant is covered in a mix of chemicals including psoralen, xanthotoxin and bergapten that causes a phototoxic reaction resulting in blistering two or three days after exposure. The moment of exposure is innocuous, without any untoward sensations to the unwary. Exposure of the affected skin to ultraviolet light, such as contained in sunlight, triggers the effects of the plant's toxins, leading to severe itching and blistering. The welts and resulting blisters can be as small as the size of a coin to covering as much exposed skin as came into contact with the plant. Where more than 5% of the body is afflicted, the scarring can be a serious matter. Washing the affected area immediately after exposure may help but preventing any further exposure to ultraviolet light such as the sun or many artificial light sources will reduce and /or eliminate blistering. =Treatment= Preventing the blister from forming is the best way to deal with the affliction. Apart from covering the area and preventing any exposure to sunlight, it is useful to directly apply sunscreen lotion as well. Reapply the lotion as soon as the itching starts again. While the red itchy welt is best treated before the blister appears, all is not lost if you are late. Direct application of the spray-on types of sunscreen, particularly those high in alcohol, tends to both dry the welt and reduce the irritation with immediate effect. If sunscreen is applied soon enough, the process can be interrupted in its entirety. If untreated the welt should stop itching and weeping after the first five to seven days. Once this has happened, it should be left exposed to allow the affected area to breathe. Blisters sometimes subside into a tender scab or scar that can take many months to disappear altogether. = Medicinal uses = Surprisingly, considering its toxicity, it has been credited with a range of medicinal properties. In the traditional medicine of the indigenous peoples of the Cape, it has been recorded as a diuretic and as a treatment for rheumatism, gout, bladder ailments, water retention and high blood pressure. The medicinal application of the plant's foliage took the form of an infusion.E.J. Dykman: Kook-, Koek- en Resepte Boek. Paarl: Paarlse Drukpers Maatskappy. 1891.  Cultivation  Though undeniably an attractive garden subject, this fynbos plant is rarely propagated on account of its phototoxic foliage. When cultivated, it prefers a relatively sunny position, but tolerates a mildly shady or moist spot provided that this is coupled with well-drained soil. For obvious reasons, a location should be chosen where it will not be likely to come in contact with human skin.Breyer-Brandwijk: The medicinal and poisonous plants of Southern and Eastern Africa, edn 2.

Its main fa√ßade is on Via Ghibellina 88, while to the right it faces Via dei Pepi.  Description  Though at present there are at least four doors, each with its own street number, historically there are only two entrances: the main one in the centre, leading to the upper stories and to the cellars, and the tradesmen's entrance to the right. Along Via Ghibellina, at ground level, besides the doors, there are a series of square stone windows with grills. There is another service entrance on Via dei Pepi, as well as what seems to be a modern door, now closed by a glass pane, and an artisan's workshop. Both the first and second floors are marked by belt course and are almost entirely occupied by serried, large, arched windows, ten on each floor. This notwithstanding, the design is sober, even austere, as is typical of XV century Florentine architecture. Inside there are two staircases leading to the upper floors, as well as two doors leading to the cellars, to the right at the rear there is a door that leads into two interconnected large rooms. The main staircase, leading to the second floor occupied by private flats, has a stone handrail. At the back of the entrance there is a courtyard with blocked arches, dating to the end of the XIV century, which obviously constituted a loggia connected to the tradesmen's entrance. There is a small loggia giving on to the courtyard. The Gherardi coat of arms is still visible on the back wall of the courtyard. Besides private habitations on the second floor, the building also houses the Florentine Campus of the Sapienza; Unitelma La Sapienza University of Rome and the Istituto di Lingua e Cultura Italiana Michelangelo on the first floor. The building is cited in the 1901 compendium of the Direzione Generale delle Antichit√† e Belle Arti, as a monumental building, classified as a national artistic monument.

Katerina Cizek is a Canadian documentary director and a pioneer in digital documentaries. She is the Artistic Director, Co-Founder and Executive Producer of the Co-Creation Studio at MIT Open Documentary Lab (Massachusetts Institute of Technology). Highrise From 2008-2015, Cizek directed the National Film Board of Canada's Highrise series on life in residential skyscrapers, including the 2010 world's first 360 degree web documentary Out My Window, winner of the inaugural IDFA DocLab Award for Digital Storytelling at the International Documentary Film Festival Amsterdam and an International Digital Emmy for best digital program: non-fiction, and the 2011 webdoc One Millionth Tower, which lets users explore a highrise complex in 3D virtual space, as Toronto residents re-imagine their neighborhood. A Short History of the Highrise is an interactive documentary that \\"explores the 2,500-year global history of vertical living and issues of social equality in an increasingly urbanized world.\\" The centerpiece of the project is four short films by Cizek‚ÄîMud, Concrete and Glass‚Äîwith images culled from The New York Times's visual archives, that are \\"intended to evoke a chapter in a storybook, with rhyming narration and photographs brought to life with intricate animation.\\" The fourth short film, Home, is being made with user-submitted images. The interactive site will incorporate the films and also offer additional archival materials, text and microgames. It premiered as part of the Film Society of Lincoln Center‚Äôs New York Film Festival Convergence program on September 30, 2013 and online at NYTimes.com in October. In April 2014, Cizek received a Peabody Award for A Short History of the Highrise, followed by a News & Documentary Emmy Award in the fall of 2014. Cizek collaborated with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's OpenDocLab unit to develop the final production in the Highrise project called Universe Within.

M., & Palestine Exploration Fund. (1957). The objects from Samaria. London: Palestine Exploration Fund. For ESA, still no production centers have been identified but distribution patterns suggest an origin in northern Syria. ESA is distinguished by the fineness of its fabric, which stands out as very pale in comparison to the deep red-slip that usually covers all surfaces. When fully applied, the slip is of a consistent color and thickness across the vessel. There are many examples on which the thickness of the slip varies considerably or on which firing is inconsistent and very dark in patches. A full range of plates, bowls, cups and jugs was produced. Early forms develop in the context of an eastern Mediterranean Hellenistic Koine Greek, while later products are influenced by trends originating in Italian workshops. Many ESA forms are mold-made and exhibit distinct delineation between walls and floors as well as elegantly curved exterior and base profiles. A further technical feature is the frequent occurrence of a \\"double-dipping streak\\" that is the result of, first, one half of a vessel being dipped in dilute slip and then the other half being similarly treated. The consequent overlap produced a line of thicker slip that became visibly darker during firing. Eastern sigillata A bowl. ESA Hayes form 2 Profile.

Samuel Atkins Eliot, writing in 1913 about the seven Colonial mansions of Brattle Street's \\"Tory Row,\\" called the area \\"not only one of the most beautiful but also one of the most historic streets in America.\\" \\"As a fashionable address it is doubtful if any other residential street in this country has enjoyed such long and uninterrupted prestige.\\"Survey of Architectural History in Cambridge: Old Cambridge, 1973 , Cambridge Historical Commission, Cambridge, Massachusetts, pp. 55-67 Origins of Brattle Street as a forest path Even before the settlement known as \\"Newe Towne\\" was planted on the site of the modern Cambridge, at the first good Charles River crossing west of Boston, the path or trail from Charlestown to Watertown ran past the site of the current Harvard Square and westward along much of what is now Brattle Street. In early 17th century Newe Towne, according to historian John Fiske, \\"On the north side of Braintree Street, opposite Dunster, and thence eastward about as far as opposite the site of Linden, stood a row of six houses, and at their back was the ancient forest. Through this forest ran the trail or path from Charlestown to Watertown, nearly coinciding with the crooked line Kirkland - Mason - Brattle - Elmwood - Mount Auburn; this was the first highway from the seaboard into the inland country.\\" Where the current Ash Street intersects the current Brattle Street stood Newe Towne's West Gate, a palisaded fence to keep cattle out of the town. Eighteenth-century Brattle Street and \\"Tory Row\\" During the 18th century, seven mansions were built along the main road to Watertown (which included not only the modern Brattle Street but also what is now Elmwood Avenue). Because many of their owners were Loyalists during the American Revolution, these houses got the nickname \\"Tory Row\\". During and after the Revolution, many were confiscated by George Washington's army. Some of these were, however, later restored to the families of their former owners. Even as the Tory Row mansions were being built, however, the forest remained a nearby presence in Cambridge. As late as 1759, a Harvard student writing home reported \\"many bears killed at Cambridge and the neighboring towns about this time, and several persons killed by them.\\" In the same year, 1759, the house at 105 Brattle Street was built, of which more below. Provincial militia leader William Brattle, at one time the wealthiest man in the Massachusetts Bay Colony, is thought to be the Brattle for whom the street was named. He had the house at 42 Brattle Street built for him in 1727. Brattle tried to keep peace between patriots and the British, but after the 1774 incident known as the Powder Alarm, an angry mob surrounded his house and forced him to flee. The Baroness Riedesel, whose husband commanded the Brunswick regiments that supported the British, spent much of the wartime \\"imprisoned\\" at 149 Brattle Street, the old Tory Row mansion now commonly called the Lechmere-Sewall- Riedesel House. She has left a charming painting in words of the Tory society on Brattle Street before the Revolution came: \\"Never had I chanced upon such an agreeable situation. Seven families, who were connected with each other, partly by the ties of relationship and partly by affection, had here farms, gardens, and magnificent houses, and, not far off, plantations of fruit. The owners of these were in the habit of daily meeting each other in the afternoons, now at the house of one and now at another, and making themselves merry with music and the dance,‚Äî living in prosperity, united and happy, until, alas! this ruinous war separated them, and left all their houses desolate, except two, the proprietors of which were also soon obliged to flee.\\" 105 Brattle Street, Washington, and the Longfellows 105 Brattle Street, once General Washington's headquarters, later the home of Longfellow Another Loyalist who fled Cambridge in 1774 was John Vassall, owner of the handsome yellow Georgian house at 105 Brattle Street, built for him in 1759. This vacant house was turned over in 1775 to George Washington, who took command of the Continental Army there. Washington used the rooms at the building's southeast corner, upstairs and down, for his private apartments, where his wife Martha Washington joined him in December, 1775. Washington lived in the house until July 1776.Howard, Hugh. Houses of the Founding Fathers. New York: Artisan, 2007: In the summer of 1837, a young Harvard professor named Henry Wadsworth Longfellow began renting some rooms in the house at 105 Brattle Street, now being run as a boarding house by the widow of Andrew Craigie, Washington's Apothecary General. Longfellow proudly wrote to a friend, \\"I live in a great house which looks like an Italian villa: have two large rooms opening into each other. They were once Gen. Washington's chambers\\".Calhoun, Charles C. Longfellow: A Rediscovered Life. Boston: Beacon Press, 2004: . In 1843, Longfellow was given the house as a wedding gift by his father-in-law Nathan Appleton, when Longfellow married Nathan's daughter Frances.Wilson, Susan. Literary Trail of Greater Boston. Boston: Houghton Mifflin Company, 2000: 109. The price of the house at that time was $10,000.Calhoun, Charles C. Longfellow: A Rediscovered Life. Boston: Beacon Press, 2004: 167. . Longfellow's wife Frances, also called Fanny, was the first American woman to receive anesthesia during childbirth, giving birth in the house at 105 Brattle Street. Longfellow and his wife Frances had two sons as well as the three daughters memorialized in his 1860 poem \\"The Children's Hour\\" as \\"grave Alice, and laughing Allegra, and Edith with golden hair.\\" All three daughters later had houses on Brattle Street, Alice inheriting her parents' home while Allegra and Edith had stylish homes built for them, at 113 and 115 Brattle Street, respectively, in 1887. Brattle Street in the 19th century During the early days of the 19th century, Brattle Street saw just a few houses added to the \\"Tory Row\\" mansions on its northern side, while the south side was still \\"meadow-land and orchards.\\" Between 1805 and 1812, a decision was made and finally carried out to straighten the end of Brattle Street, where it joins Mount Auburn Street, renaming a part of the original Tory Row \\"Elmwood Avenue.\\" As a result, the Brattle Street of today is different from the original Watertown highway, whose original route went along what is now Elmwood Avenue. This is why \\"Elmwood,\\" one of the seven original Tory Row mansions (\\"on Elmwood Avenue, then a part of the Watertown highway, which here made a sharp serpentine sweep to the southward, lived Lieutenant- Governor Oliver\\") no longer has a Brattle Street address. James Russell Lowell, writing in 1868, conjured up Brattle Street (the \\"Old Road\\") as it was in the 1830s, seen from the top of a hill near where Mount Auburn Hospital stands now: > On your right, the Charles slipped smoothly through green and purple salt- > meadows, darkened, here and there, with the blossoming black-grass as with a > stranded cloud-shadow. Over these marshes, level as water, but without its > glare, and with softer and more soothing gradations of perspective, the eye > was carried to a horizon of softly-rounded hills. To your left hand, upon > the Old Road, you saw some half-dozen dignified old houses of the colonial > time, all comfortably fronting southward. If it were early June, the rows of > horse-chestnuts along the fronts of these houses showed, through every > crevice of their dark heap of foliage, and on the end of every drooping > limb, a cone of pearly flowers, while the hill behind was white or rosy with > the crowding blooms of various fruit-trees. There is no sound, unless a > horseman clatters over the loose planks of the bridge. As the 19th century lengthened, Brattle Street continued to attract wealthy families who built houses in the newest architectural styles, such as Greek Revival (#112 built in 1846), Stick style (#92, built in 1881), and Colonial Revival (#115, built in 1887). The Shingle style Mary Fiske Stoughton House at 90 Brattle Street has been called \\"the best suburban wooden house in America ... comparable only to the finest of Frank Lloyd Wright's.\\"Henry-Russell Hitchcock, as quoted in Arnold Lewis, American Country Houses of the Gilded Age (New York: Dover Publications, Inc., 1982), plate 36. Brattle Street after 1900 In 1969, the architect owners of the Design Research store created a four-story glass and concrete Modernist building at 48 Brattle Street to showcase the Scandinavian clothing and housewares they had been selling on Brattle Street since 1953.\\"We lived it here first\\" by Robert Campbell (2010-08-22) Boston Globe During the summer months, Harvard Square and Brattle Square host many street performers and buskers.

He has since helped to found two think tanks: the Asia Economic Forum, and the Asian Faiths Development Dialogue. In addition, he also helped to found the South East Asia Television network and radio station, known as SEATV and Radio. In 2014, he founded the Techo Sen School of Government and International Relations at The University of Cambodia, intended to provide high-class training for administrators, policy makers, and young leaders. And in 2015, he founded the College of Media and Communications at The University of Cambodia to promote quality journalism and communications education and provide students with hands on training at Southeast Asia Television (SEATV) and Radio (FM 106). Seeing the need for high quality language education, he founded the School of Foreign Languages in 2018 which offers full degrees in English, Chinese, Korean, Japanese, and French and provides short courses in Thai and German. Additionally, he established the School of Creative Arts, aimed to preserve and celebrate Cambodia's rich history of art, song, and dance. In July 2019, Prime Minister Hun Sen announced that he nominated Kao to become the Secretary-General of ASEAN for 2023-2027.  Education  After the Cambodian Civil War (1967‚Äì1975), the Khmer Rouge seized power and committed genocide (1975‚Äì1979). Kao received very little formal education during his childhood due to the unstable and violent conditions in Cambodia at the time. His family was granted refugee status in 1981, and eventually relocated to Herndon, Virginia. There, Kao enrolled in high school. He was 16 years old at the time and had very little educational experience and no English training. However, he was quite successful and graduated with a high school diploma with scholastic excellence three years later, in 1985. He then attended Baylor University in Waco, Texas, where he did his B.A. in Asian Studies He received a National Fellowship Scholarship to Ohio University in Athens for his master's degree program. And in 1991, he graduated with two master's degrees in Political Science and International Affairs. Additionally, he holds a Ph.D. in Political Science from the University of Hawaii at Manoa in Honolulu. He received an Honorary Doctorate Degree in Public Service from Ohio University in 2007, as well as another Honorary Doctorate Degree in Literature from the Kalinga Institute of Industrial Technology (KIIT University) of India in 2014.  Professional career  He was appointed as director of the Khmer International Relations Institute, and held that office from 1993 to 1994. During his time as director, he developed the Cambodia Public Accountability and Transparency project (CPAT) with funding support from the Asia Foundation. The project, one of the first counter-corruption projects in the nation, did not receive sufficient funding, and thus could not produce significant results. The project was later transformed into the Center for Social Development (CSD) when Kao became Director of the think-tank, the Cambodian Institute for Cooperation and Peace (CICP), launched earlier by His Royal Highness Prince Norodom Sirivudh in cooperation with the German Friedrich- Ebert-Foundation (Phnom Phenh Post 09. September 1994). Kao worked as CICP's first executive director for 10 years, until 2004, though he has remained as a Member of the Board of Directors (2004‚Äìpresent). The CICP was at the forefront of supporting Cambodia in becoming a member of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) in 1999, the ASEAN Institutes of Strategic and International Studies and the Council for Security Cooperation in Asia Pacific (CSCAP) during Kao's tenure. He has published many books on ASEAN and Cambodian-ASEAN relations, and gained significant experience in ASEAN through the activities of the ASEAN Institutes of Strategic and International Studies. His time at CICP also involved significant interactions with the Royal Government of Cambodia, as an advisor to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation. Kao served as Advisor to the Minister of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation of the Royal Government of Cambodia from 1996 to 1998, and again from 2001 to 2004 with the rank of Undersecretary of State. He also became a member of the Supreme National Economic Council with the rank of minister when SNEC was founded in 1999 and has been a member since then. In 2003, Kao founded The University of Cambodia (UC). UC offers degree programs based on the American credit-based system, with courses taught in the English language. Kao was inspired to create a Cambodian higher education institution modeled in a similar way to the United States that focuses on developing students' critical thinking and problem solving skills. Those values are reflected in the vision and mission of The University of Cambodia. The University offers Associate's, Bachelor's, Master's and Doctoral degree programs through its twelve colleges and schools: the College of Arts, Humanities and Languages, the College of Education, the College of Law, the College of Media and Communications, the College of Science and Technology, the College of Social Sciences, the Techo Sen School of Government and International Relations, and The Tony Fernandes School of Business. Additionally, the School of Graduate Studies oversees the university's graduate programs, and the School of Undergraduate Studies manages the undergraduate programs. In May 2018, the Ministry of Education, Youth and Sport approved two new schools which were launched later in the year: the School of Creative Arts and the School of Foreign Languages. The University of Cambodia has also established two think-tanks under the leadership of Kao: the Asia Economic Forum (AEF) and the Asia Faiths Development Dialogue, both of which fall under the umbrella of the university. Kao is a founding committee member, and vice-chairman of AEF, which was established by UC in May 2005. AEF is a think-tank promoting policy dialogue around major issues facing the Asia- Pacific region. AEF has generally been held on an annual basis in Phnom Penh. Kao is also the Secretary General of the Asian Faiths Development Dialogue (AFDD), which was founded by Dr. Haruhisa Handa in December 2006. The purpose of AFDD is to enhance dialogue between different faith groups, and bring faith communities together to achieve humanitarian and development aims. In 2004, he was appointed as Secretary of State for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation a position he held until 2013. During his tenure as Secretary of State, Kao worked extensively with ASEAN, developing relationships and managing Cambodia's participation in the organization's many mechanisms. As such, he was a key player in the development and negotiation of the ASEAN Charter, as the Cambodian representative to the ASEAN High Level Task Force on the Drafting of the ASEAN Charter. In addition to ASEAN, Kao was also responsible for the ASEAN Plus Three, the ASEAN Plus One mechanisms, the ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF), the East Asia Summit (EAS), as well as the Asia- Europe Meeting (ASEM) Since 2006, Kao has served as the Vice Chairman for the Advisory Board of the International Relations Institute of Cambodia at the Office of the Council of Ministers. In 2007, South East Asia Television and South East Asia Radio, popularly known as SEATV, were established by Kao. The SEATV headquarters is located on UC's Phnom Penh campus, and are used in conjunction with UC's College of Media and Communications for practical degree components. He has concurrently served as a Member of the Board of Directors of the Worldwide Support for Development based in Tokyo since 2008. He has also served as a member of the Standing Committee of the Cambodian Red Cross for two terms, with each term serving up to five years (first term: 2008‚Äì2013; second term: 2013‚Äìpresent). He was Alternative Member for Cambodia's National Representation for the ASEAN Political-Security Council from August 2009 to September 2013, as well as Secretary-General of the ASEAN National Secretariat of Cambodia from 2004 to 2013. In 2013, he was promoted to the position of Minister Delegate Attached to the Prime Minister of the Kingdom of Cambodia, in charge of Foreign Affairs and ASEAN, which he currently holds. From October 2016 to May 2017, he served as the vice chairman of Cambodia's Inter- Ministerial Committee for the World Economic Forum on ASEAN 2017. He currently serves as a Senior Fellow at the Jeffrey Cheah Institute on Southeast Asia and is also a Member of the Global Council of The Asia Society. In 2018, he was appointed to serve on the Board of the Cambodian Higher Education Association (CHEA) as both the Deputy Chairman of the Board of Directors and the Chairman of the Dissemination Affairs Committee. In September 2018, he was reappointed for a second term as Minister Delegate Attached to the Prime Minister of the Kingdom of Cambodia in charge of Foreign Affairs and ASEAN, from 2018-2023. In July 2019, Kao was nominated to be Secretary General of ASEAN from 2023-2027, and it is the first time a Cambodian will have held the post.  Personal life  Kao was born in 1966 in Koh Sotin District in Kampong Cham province in Cambodia. His father was a school teacher throughout his life, except during the Khmer Rouge period when education was outlawed and teachers were targeted and killed. Due to the incredibly violent conditions in the nation, he and his family spent time living in refugee camps on the Cambodian-Thai border after the Khmer Rouge were removed from power in 1979, and they eventually relocated to the United States as refugees. After taking a long break from formal education, Kao completed his extensive education in the United States.

The game was released in 2011/2012 on the Microsoft Windows, Nintendo 3DS, PlayStation 3, PlayStation Vita and Xbox 360. The game engine is based on EGO 2.0 engine. Details All twelve teams and twenty-four drivers that started the 2011 season are featured in the game, though mid-season driver changes did not take place due to licensing restrictions. The entire calendar of nineteen circuits from the 2011 season is present, including the new Buddh International Circuit in India. Certain circuits also feature day-to-night transitions. At E3, Codemasters announced that the focus of F1 2011 is to \\"Be the Driver, Live the Life, Go Compete\\". and that multiplayer aspects of the game are being emphasized as a part of this. Online multiplayer have a maximum of sixteen players in a race with the option to include an additional eight AI-controlled cars. Objectives are also included in multiplayer. A split- screen multiplayer mode is implemented, as is an online co-operative championship. In August 2011, Codemasters announced that the safety car would be implemented in the game following its absence in F1 2010, and that it would be available in races that are 20% of real race distance or longer. Red flags are also included for situations where the safety car cannot get around the track, but not for extreme weather conditions. Rule changes for the 2011 season, including KERS, DRS and Pirelli tyres are also featured in the game.

Reception The PC, PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 versions received \\"favorable\\" reviews, while the PlayStation Vita and Nintendo 3DS versions received \\"mixed or average reviews\\", according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. Early critical response was positive, with reviews praised improvements in handling and AI and the way new rule changes - in particular KERS and DRS - added an additional layer of strategy to the game. IGN remarked that the differences in using these features helped separate qualifying and racing into two separate gameplay modes. In Japan, where the game was ported for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 on 6 October 2011, for PC on the following day, for PlayStation Vita on 17 December 2011, and for Nintendo 3DS on 22 December 2011, Famitsu gave the game a score of one nine, one eight, one seven and one eight for the first two console versions; and one eight, two sevens and one six for the final two handheld versions. The Guardian gave the Xbox 360 version a score of four stars out of five and said it was \\"pretty much an essential purchase for any self-respecting petrol-head, and a lot more compelling and enticing than those who don't dream about lap times might imagine.\\" The Daily Telegraph similarly gave the same console version four stars out of five, saying that \\"Codemasters have made a plethora of improvements under the bonnet, polishing an engine that should prove a fantastic basis for the planned yearly iterations of their F1 franchise.\\" The Digital Fix gave the PlayStation 3 version a score of eight out of ten, calling it \\"a great racer but only a nearly-great game.\\" Digital Spy gave said PlayStation 3 version a similar score of four stars out of five, saying that \\"It's not a wholesale reinvention, but rather a confident leap forward from a publisher in tune with its sport. The career mode lacks a bit of personality, but it's still a good frame for what is most important - the racing.\\" The website also gave the PlayStation Vita version three stars out of five and called it \\"a laudable attempt at scaling down a sophisticated simulation racer for a handheld platform, but it would have benefited from stronger AI and more challenge. In its defense, it caters well for newcomers due to its casual Challenges mode and forgiving level of difficulty, but still falls marginally short of expectations.\\" However, the same website also gave the Nintendo 3DS version two stars out of five and said, \\"Sumo Digital should be commended for its attempts to pack as much as humanely possible into a Nintendo 3DS game. However, despite its wealth of options, game modes and extras, F1 2011 fails where it counts most, on the race track.\\" F1 2011 has sold 3.5 million units worldwide as in the sales.

He has made significant contributions to formal methods for program correctness. In recent years these advances have been employed in developing industrial software tools that conduct automated analysis of large industrial codebases. Education O'Hearn attained a BSc degree in computer science from Dalhousie University, Halifax, Nova Scotia (1985), followed by MSc (1987) and PhD (1991) degrees from Queen's University, Kingston, Ontario, Canada. His dissertation was on Semantics of Non-interference: A natural approach, supervised by Robert D. Tennent.Peter W O'Hearn, Curriculum Vitae , Queen Mary, University of London, UK. Career and research O'Hearn is best known for separation logic, a theory he developed with John C. Reynolds that unearthed new domains for scaling logical reasoning about code. This built upon previous research from O'Hearn and David Pym on logic for resources ‚Äî Bunched logic. With Stephen Brookes, Carnegie Mellon University, O'Hearn created Concurrent Separation Logic (CSL), extending the theory further. Tony Hoare, in discussing the grand challenge of program verification, described CSL as \\"solving two problems...concurrecy and object orientation\\".https://www.facebook.com/academics/videos/2228616734102290/?t=3775 https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/602382.602403 Separation logic has given rise to the Infer Static Analyzer (Facebook Infer), a static program analysis utility developed by O'Hearn's team at Facebook. After 20 plus years in academia, O'Hearn landed at Facebook in 2013 with the acquisition of Monoidics Ltd, a startup he cofounded. Since its inception, Infer has enabled Facebook engineers to resolve tens of thousands of bugs before reaching production. It was open sourced in 2016, and is used by Amazon Inc, Spotify, Mozilla, Uber, and others. In 2017, O'Hearn and the team open sourced RacerD, an automated static race condition detection tool that reduces the time it takes to flag potential problems in concurrent software, as part of the Infer platform. O'Hearn was an assistant professor at Syracuse University, New York, United States, from 1990 to 1995. He was a reader in computer science at Queen Mary University of London from 1996 to 1999 and then a full professor at Queen Mary until his move to University College London. At UCL he was granted a Royal Academy of Engineering/Microsoft Research Chair. In 1997 he was a visiting scientist at Carnegie Mellon University and in 2006 he was a visiting researcher at Microsoft Research Cambridge.. He now shares his time working as a research scientist at Facebook and a professor at UCL. =Awards and honours= In 2007, O'Hearn was granted a Royal Society Wolfson Research Merit Award. In 2011, O'Hearn and Samin Ishtiaq were awarded a Most Influential POPL Paper Award. With Stephen Brookes, Carnegie Mellon University, he was co- recipient of the 2016 G√∂del Prize, for the invention of Concurrent Separation Logic.

Nowadays, the term \\"Camba\\" is used predominately to refer eastern Bolivians population of Spanish mixed with some Chane and other Amazonian descent born in the eastern lowlands in and around Santa Cruz de la Sierra. Colla people, who are the population that lives in Western Bolivia, have always been in conflict with Camba people due to their different customs, behavior and appearance. Therefore, it may be common to hear Camba people use the term \\"Colla\\" as a swear word or to insult the Western population as such as it is possible to hear Collas curse on cambas. Camba may also be used as a colloquial term for \\"person\\", as in \\"Who is that person?\\" translated to \\"¬øQuien es ese camba?\\" (ignores the ethnicity of the subject and does not change depending on gender as most Spanish nouns do). Such use is predominant in eastern Bolivia.  Etymology and Context  According to a theory presented by Ram√≥n Rocha Monroy, some of the Bantu languages spoken by Angolans who were sold in America as slaves, were recorded in a book published by a Jesuit missionary named Pedro Dias in 1697, called Arte da Lengua de Angola (The art of the Angola language). This publication had recorded the word camba (Friend of the color black), among other words, and its plural form macamba. During that time, Angola, which was a Portuguese Colony, was responsible for more than a third of the slave trade on the Atlantic directed toward Brazil From there the slaves went to the Spanish colonies, from the R√≠o de la Plata (Plata River) to Eastern Bolivia. Kamba has become part of several Indigenous languages of the region, like Guaran√≠, as a demonym (nickname) for black persons (different than h≈©, which means 'the color black'), as well as to refer to the King Mago Baltasar. In several local Liturgies he was called el Santo Camb√°, or the Camba Saint. Today, the term camba is used as a demonym for mestizos cruze√±os, or people with Indigenous descent from Santa Cruz, Pando or Beni. African slaves got all the way to modern day Potos√≠, Bolivia, however, they were able to settle mostly in the yungas. The term could have begun as a demonym there, and then spread to the rest of eastern Bolivia. Another hypothesis states that the word camba comes from a town in Galicia, called Cambados. Some dispute this theory considering it to be improbable, insulting or politically incorrect to have a nickname for \\"cruce√±os\\" (persons from Santa Cruz) with an African origin. They support this based on the chronicles written by the Jesuits, which describe many traditions of Spaniards and Creoles in America, but don't make any mention that they would use African vocabulary to describe themselves.

He traveled by boat to Gda≈Ñsk where he was received by Joost Brasser, and then travelled to Elbing, where he was received by Bartholomeus Strobel. Gillis Schagen Biography in De groote schouburgh der Nederlantsche konstschilders en schilderessen (1718) by Arnold Houbraken, courtesy of the Digital library for Dutch literature Schagen painted a portrait of the King of Poland to \\"prove his mastership of the art\\" for him. From there he went home for a short stay before travelling by boat to Dieppe and onwards to Paris, where he painted portraits of many important people there and in Orleans. In October 1639 he set sail again, and crossed the English channel to England. He visited admiral Maarten Tromp there, who invited him to draw his ships and observe the sea battle for inspiration. At that moment he was about to wage the Battle of the Downs against the Spanish under Antonio D'Oquendo. After observing the battle however, Schagen decided to return to the Netherlands without drawing the ships. He settled in Alkmaar where he became a member of the vroedschap like his father. After the Peace of Westphalia in 1648 he made another trip to Brabant with Admiral van Dorp and van den Cornput van Dordrecht. In 1651 he made a trip to Liege and Cologne. He was a respected regent of the orphanage in Alkmaar when he died at 52.

It is used during prearranged educational events such as conferences, e-learning, and trainings to improve performance in democratic governance.March and Olsen. 1995; Doornbos, 2003. p. 3‚Äì17Finer 1997 Concept The technique consists of a nine-stage learning process divided into three phases, which include the planning and aftermath as well as the learning event itself. A major characteristic of this type of governmental learning event is facilitation by a learning brokerRose 1991 pp. 3‚Äì30; Dolowitz and Marsh 2000. p. 9. Blindenbacher and Nashat 2010, pp. 105‚Äì107 who oversees all aspects of event organization. These include logistics, content preparation, drafting and implementation of the agenda, moderation of the learning sessions, and follow-up activities. The learning broker designs the learning process according to the specific governance challenge at hand. The event must be structured based on several factors: * The specific challenge a government is facing * An analysis of the kind of knowledge a government needs to address it * The particular political and institutional environment, which determines who will participate in the activityBlindenbacher and Nashat 2010, pp. 84‚Äì88 The participants invited to the event must represent different substantive and organizational perspectives and play a precisely defined role as both knowledge holders and knowledge seekers. When this is achieved, participants have unlimited access to the collective wealth of the shared tacit and explicit knowledge. The effects of applying the governmental learning spiral technique are threefold: The primary effect is that governments gain access to the latest knowledge in democratic governance, which they can then apply to specific governance challenges with concrete, practical action. A second effect is that‚Äîbecause of the iterative character of the learning process‚Äîthe knowledge being learned is always validated and updated in real time to include the latest experiences on the subject. A third effect is that participation in the learning process evokes a sense of social belonging among the learning actors, which often leads to the creation of networks and communities of practice where governments continue to share their latest experiences and by doing so launch the next spin of the Governmental Learning Spiral. Template The governmental learning spiral technique consists of a nine-stage template.Blindenbacher and Nashat 2010, pp. 69‚Äì73 The stages of the learning process are organized chronologically in the template and split into three distinct sequences for a particular learning event. 1\\\\. Before (framing phase): The conceptualization, triangulation, and accommodation stages are the preparatory stages, where the specific governance challenge is defined, existing knowledge on the topic is framed, participants are selected and inivited, and trust is established between the learning actors and the event facilitator and between participants and the learning process itself. 2\\\\. During (reflection phase): The internalization, externalization, reconceptualization, and transformation stages represent the core of the educational process, where learning actors review and adapt new knowledge according to their personal needs. Thereafter the actors change their individual and organizational thinking and behavior in an elaborate inter- and intrapersonal procedure. 3\\\\. After (projection phase): The follow- up to the learning activity occurs in the configuration stage, where all the knowledge acquired during the event is made available and accessible to everyone involved in the event as well as to a wider audience. This new knowledge further serves in the final iteration stage as a frame for the next spin of the governmental learning spiral, as well as a feedback loop in the context of a new learning system. Because knowledge in governance has a short half-life and has to be updated constantly, the learning process itself must also be ongoing. This iterative procedure, where knowledge is constantly reviewed, renewed, and transformed into political action in a real-time, multi-turn process, can be illustrated as a spiral. Each of the nine stages of the learning process is bound together by a \\"spin,\\" which ends with the last iteration stage and restarts the next spin with its first configuration stage.

Trastuzumab alone stops growth of cancer cells by binding to the HER2 receptor, whereas trastuzumab emtansine undergoes receptor- mediated internalization into cells, is catabolized in lysosomes where DM1-containing catabolites are released and subsequently bind tubulin to cause mitotic arrest and cell death. Trastuzumab binding to HER2 prevents homodimerization or heterodimerization (HER2/HER3) of the receptor, ultimately inhibiting the activation of MAPK and PI3K/AKT cellular signalling pathways. Because the monoclonal antibody targets HER2, and HER2 is only over-expressed in cancer cells, the conjugate delivers the cytotoxic agent DM1 specifically to tumor cells. The conjugate is abbreviated T-DM1. In the EMILIA clinical trial of women with advanced HER2 positive breast cancer who were already resistant to trastuzumab alone, it improved median overall survival by 5.8 months (30.9 months vs. 25.1 months) compared to the combination of lapatinib and capecitabine. Based on that trial, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved marketing on 22 February 2013. Trastuzumab emtansine was developed by Genentech, a subsidiary group of Roche, and is manufactured by Lonza. The planned cost is expected to be $9,800 a month, or $94,000 for a typical course of treatment. Medical use In the United States, ado- trastuzumab emtansine was approved specifically for treatment of HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer (mBC) in patients who have been treated previously with trastuzumab and a taxane (paclitaxel or docetaxel), and who have already been treated for mBC or developed tumor recurrence within six months of adjuvant therapy. Approval was based on the EMILIA study, a phase III clinical trial that compared trastuzumab emtansine versus capecitabine (Xeloda) plus lapatinib (Tykerb) in 991 people with unresectable, locally advanced or metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer who had previously been treated with trastuzumab and taxane chemotherapy. This trial showed improved progression- free survival in patients treated with trastuzumab emtansine (median 9.6 vs. 6.4 months), along with improved overall survival (median 30.9 vs. 25.1 months) and safety. =Clinical trials= Since 2013 there have been some more clinical trials: * First line treatment for metastatic breast cancer: the MARIANNE study.

Oct 2013 Adverse effects During clinical trials, the most common adverse effects of trastuzumab emtansine were fatigue, nausea, musculoskeletal pain, thrombocytopenia (low platelet counts), headache, increased liver enzyme levels, and constipation. Severe adverse events identified during the EMILIA trial included hepatotoxicity (liver damage), including rare cases of liver failure, hepatic encephalopathy, and nodular regenerative hyperplasia; heart damage (dysfunction of the left ventricle); interstitial lung disease, including acute interstitial pneumonitis; thrombocytopenia; and peripheral neuropathy. Overall, trastuzumab emtansine was better tolerated than the control treatment, a combination of lapatinib (Tykerb) and capecitabine (Xeloda), with 43% of patients in the trastuzumab emtansine group experiencing severe toxic effects, versus 59% of those who received lapatinib/capecitabine; furthermore, fewer patients had to stop treatment due to adverse effects than with lapatinib or capecitabine. Anemia, low platelet counts, and peripheral neuropathy were more common among patients who received trastuzumab emtansine, whereas heart damage and gastrointestinal effects, such as vomiting, diarrhea, and stomatitis, were more common with lapatinib/capecitabine. In the United States, Kadcyla carries black box warnings for liver toxicity, heart damage (reduction in left ventricular ejection fraction), and fetal harm if given to pregnant women. UK pricing issues In the UK, Kadcyla was not recommended for use by the National Health Service by advisory body NICE, reportedly because an acceptable pricing agreement could not be reached with Roche. Originally it cost ¬£5,900 a month.Breast cancer drug Kadcyla to remain on NHS after manufacturer lowers price. Nov 2015 and NICE estimated it cost ¬£166,000 per QALYPressure grows on Roche to lower breast cancer drug price. Aug 2014 (well over the usual maximum). It has been funded by the English NHS Cancer Drugs Fund but in January 2015 it was proposed to remove it from the approved list. After a secret discount was agreed by Roche the Cancer Drugs Fund will continue to fund it. In June 2017, the NHS Confederation and NHS Chief Executive Simon Stevens announced that the NHS would be offering Kadcyla to a limited number of women after striking a deal with Roche on the price. Nomenclature In 2013, Kadcyla was approved in the United States with the generic name \\"ado-trastuzumab emtansine\\", rather than the original United States Adopted Name (USAN) issued in 2009, \\"trastuzumab emtansine\\". Trastuzumab is the anti-HER2 antibody; emtansine refers to the linker-drug (SMCC-DM1). The \\"ado-\\" prefix was added at the request of the FDA to help prevent dispensing errors. During preclinical development and clinical trials, the drug was also known as trastuzumab-DM1 or trastuzumab-MCC-DM1 (after the codename for emtansine), both abbreviated T-DM1, and by the codename PRO132365. Chemical properties Schematic representation of trastuzumab emtansine. The maytansine skeleton is shown in black at left. The thioether group that makes mertansine is shown in red. The linker group that makes emtansine is shown in blue at right, bound to the amino group (HN‚Äì) of a lysine residue in the trastuzumab molecule (‚Äìmab). Trastuzumab emtansine is an antibody-drug conjugate (ADC), a combination between a monoclonal antibody and a small-molecule drug. Each molecule of trastuzumab emtansine consists of a single trastuzumab molecule with several molecules of DM1, a cytotoxic maytansinoid, attached. SMCC, or succinimidyl trans-4-(maleimidylmethyl)cyclohexane-1-carboxylate, is a heterobifunctional crosslinker, a type of chemical reagent that contains two reactive functional groups, a succinimide ester and a maleimide. The succinimide group of SMCC reacts with the free amino group of a lysine residue in the trastuzumab molecule and the maleimide moiety of SMCC links to the free sulfhydryl group of DM1, forming a covalent bond between the antibody and the DM1. Each trastuzumab molecule may be linked to zero to eight DM1 molecules (3.5 on average). DM1 binds at plus ends of cellular microtubules and thereby inhibits cell division in the target tumor cells. History In 2013, ado-trastuzumab emtansine was approved in the United States for the treatment of adults with HER2-positive, metastatic breast cancer who previously received trastuzumab and a taxane, separately or in combination. Referred to as T-DM1 during clinical research, ado-trastuzumab emtansine was reviewed under the FDA's priority review program. The safety and effectiveness of ado-trastuzumab emtansine were evaluated in a clinical study of 991 patients randomly assigned to receive ado-trastuzumab emtansine or lapatinib plus capecitabine, another chemotherapy drug. Patients received treatment until either the cancer progressed or the side effects became intolerable. The study was designed to measure progression-free survival, the length of time patients lived without the cancer progressing, and overall survival, the length of time patients lived before death. Results showed that patients treated with ado-trastuzumab emtansine had a median progression-free survival of 9.6 months compared to 6.4 months in patients treated with lapatinib plus capecitabine. The median overall survival was 30.9 months in the ado-trastuzumab emtansine group and 25.1 months in the lapatinib plus capecitabine group. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved ado-trastuzumab emtansine in February 2013, and granted the application for Kadcyla to Genentech. In 2013, ado-trastuzumab emtansine was approved in the UK, and the EU. In 2019, ado-trastuzumab emtansine was approved in the United States for the adjuvant treatment of patients with HER2-positive early breast cancer (EBC) who have residual invasive disease after neoadjuvant taxane and trastuzumab-based treatment. Approval was based on KATHERINE (NCT01772472), a randomized, multicenter, open-label trial of 1486 patients with HER2-positive EBC. Breast tumor samples were required to demonstrate HER2 overexpression defined as 3+ IHC or ISH amplification ratio ‚â• 2.0 determined at a central laboratory using Ventana's PATHWAY anti-HER2-/neu (4B5) Rabbit Monoclonal Primary Antibody or INFORM HER2 Dual ISH DNA Probe Cocktail assays. Patients were required to have had neoadjuvant taxane and trastuzumab-based therapy with residual invasive tumor in the breast and/or axillary lymph nodes. Patients received radiotherapy and/or hormonal therapy concurrent with study treatment per local guidelines. Patients were randomized (1:1) to receive ado-trastuzumab emtansine 3.6 mg/kg intravenously or trastuzumab 6 mg/kg intravenously on day 1 of a 21-day cycle for 14 cycles. The trial's primary endpoint was invasive disease-free survival (IDFS), defined as the time from the date of randomization to first occurrence of ipsilateral invasive breast tumor recurrence, ipsilateral local or regional invasive breast cancer recurrence, distant recurrence, contralateral invasive breast cancer, or death from any cause. After a median follow-up of 40 months, the trial demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in IDFS in patients who received ado-trastuzumab emtansine compared with those who received trastuzumab (HR 0.50; 95% CI: 0.39, 0.64; p<0.0001). Overall survival data were not mature at the time of the IDFS analysis. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted the application for ado-trastuzumab emtansine priority review designation and breakthrough therapy designation for the adjuvant treatment of patients with HER2-positive early breast cancer who have residual disease after pre-operative systemic treatment.

On 13 September 1917, the U.S. Navy acquired her from her owner, Dempsey & Son of Norfolk, Virginia, for use as a section patrol boat during World War I. She was commissioned as USS L. A. Dempsey (SP-1231). Assigned to the 5th Naval District and based at Norfolk, L. A. Dempsey served as a section patrol boat for the rest of World War I and into 1919. The Navy decommissioned L. A. Dempsey on 11 July 1919 and returned her to Dempsey & Son the same day. References * *SP-1231 L. A.

The comparison of different types of measurement often involves model calculations, which may also be tested in this process. A common example for closure experiments are aerosol studies. Aerosols can be studied from space, from aircraft, and from the surface. The different properties of aerosols (chemical composition, particle size, particle number concentration, optical absorptivity, thermal emissivity, index of refraction, pattern of light scattering, etc.) require very different kinds of measurement techniques. Different instruments have been developed to perform each technique, and researchers usually specialize in one or a few of them. Due to the logistic efforts required to bring different groups of researchers with different measurement techniques together, such experiments stand out among routine experiments that are more focused on one or a few techniques and have fewer participants. An aerosol closure experiment might look like this: * Individual aerosol particles are sampled, and their size and shape are determined under an electron microscope; * A lidar emits a laser beam into the aerosol plume and detects the backscatter signal; * An aerosol flow is led through optical detectors that record the size distribution of the particles; * The sunlight attenuated by the aerosol is measured by a sun photometer, yielding the optical depth of the aerosol layer; * the spectral absorption of sunlight, as well as the scattering properties of the aerosol are measured by spectrometers; * The extent and total reflectivity of the aerosol plume are observed by a satellite radiometer. Additionally, measurements can be performed within the plume or outside, by means of remote sensing, from the surface, from aircraft, and from satellites in space. Different viewing geometries again introduce complexity, which can be assessed in closure experiments. Algorithms exist, for example, to predict the optical properties from a given particle shape, size distribution, and index of refraction. Closure is achieved if the predictions of such an algorithm agree (within the limits of measurement uncertainty) with the optical properties that have been derived from the independent radiation measurements; if the lidar information about the vertical distribution of the aerosol sums up to the total optical depth determined by the sun photometer; etc. References Quinn, P.

Season summary Only seven tropical cyclones were observed in the Eastern Pacific during this season, which is well below the 1995‚Äì2008 average of 15 per year. However, it is likely that other tropical cyclones in the Central or Eastern Pacific basin in 1950 went operationally unnoticed, due to small tropical cyclone size, sparse ship reports, relatively unpopulated coastlines, and lack of modern technology. Of the seven tropical cyclones, six attained hurricane status. None of the tropical cyclones became a major hurricane, which is Category 3 or greater on Saffir‚ÄìSimpson Hurricane Scale. In addition, a tropical cyclone developed within the Central Pacific basin. Similar to 1949, most of the seven tropical cyclones did not differentiate significantly in intensity during the duration, with the exception of Hurricane Hiki and Tropical Storm Five. Although there were no conventional date limits of an Eastern Pacific hurricane season, tropical cyclone activity began almost a month after the dates of the season set in subsequent years, from May 15-November 30\\\\. The first tropical cyclone of the season formed mid-June, and two more developed in the month of July. No tropical cyclogenesis occurred for 30 days, and ended with Hurricane Hiki developing on August 12, followed by a quick succession of two more tropical cyclones. No tropical cyclones developed in the Eastern Pacific basin in month of September, records show that this is the only known occurrence of such a meteorological oddity. The season ended after a hurricane developed on October 1 and dissipated two days later. Systems =Hurricane One= The first tropical cyclone of the season was initially noted on June 14, located 158 mi (254.27 km) southwest of Puerto √Ångel, Mexico. Hurricane One headed north-northwestward toward the coast of Mexico, but veered away near Acapulco on June 16\\\\. After veering away from Mexico, the hurricane began to parallel the coastline, until curving due north. On June 19, the hurricane passed within 20 mi (32.18 km) of Isla Maria Cleofas in the archipelago of Islas Mar√≠as offshore of Mexico. Hurricane One dissipated shortly thereafter. =Hurricane Two= The second tropical cyclone of the season developed 113 mi (182 km) southwest of Manzanillo, Colima on July 3\\\\. Similar to Hurricane One, this storm paralleled the coast of Mexico and then headed out to sea. Hurricane Two later headed northwestward, and paralleled Baja California. The hurricane dissipated July 6, 240 mi (386.24 km) north-northwest of Cabo San Lucas. =Hurricane Three= Hurricane Three was first observed 270 mi (434.52 km) south-southeast of Socorro Island on July 9\\\\. The hurricane passed within 70 mi (112.65 km) of Socorro Island on July 10\\\\. After passing near the island, the hurricane headed out into the open Pacific Ocean. Hurricane Three eventually dissipated on July 12. =Hurricane Hiki= A tropical depression formed over the Central Pacific on August 12, southeast of Hawaii. It tracked west-northwestward, strengthening to become Tropical Storm Hiki the next day (Hawaiian for Able). Hiki reached hurricane strength while a short distance north of the islands. A small hurricane, it paralleled the islands until August 17, when a high pressure system forced the storm southwestward. As the high receded, Hiki moved to the northwest and dissipated on August 21. The hurricane was also followed by the Air Weather Service, located on Guam. As described in \\"Report on the Post Analysis of Typhoons in the Western North Pacific ‚àí1950\\" this system was also assigned the name Salome from the North West Pacific Typhoon name list for 1950. The name Salome is not widely known and the system is usually referred to as Hiki.Air Weather Service \\"Report on the Post Analysis of Typhoons in the Western North Pacific ‚àí1950\\" The heaviest known rainfall from a tropical cyclone on the state of Hawaii occurred with Hiki, when over 52 in (1,320 mm) fell at Kanalohuluhulu Ranger Station. It was the highest amount in the state‚Äôs history until Hurricane Lane in 2018. Moderate damage was seen on Hawaii, and one person died. =Tropical Storm Four= The only tropical cyclone that failed to intensify into a hurricane developed on August 12, 394 mi (634 km) south-southwest of Socorro Island. By early on August 13, the system had weakened, and was downgraded to a tropical depression only twelve hours after forming. The storm dissipated 707 mi (1137.80 km) south of Guadalupe Island later that day. =Hurricane Six= Hurricane Six was first observed 1,590 mi (2,556.85 km) south-southeast of Ka Lae on August 26\\\\. The hurricane headed generally north-northwestward with no change in intensity. By August 29, Hurricane Six crossed 140¬∞W, which would become the Central Pacific Hurricane Center's forecast area in 1970. Hurricane six dissipated 788 mi (1,268.16 km) east of Hilo, Hawaii on August 30. =Hurricane Seven= The final tropical cyclone of the season was initially discovered 539 mi (867.43 km) southwest of Zihuatanejo, Mexico. Hurricane Seven initially headed northward, but curved northwestward later that day. No change in intensity occurred, and Hurricane Seven dissipated on October 3, 142 mi (228.52 km) southwest of Socorro Island.

At the time, P√©ronne was known as Perrona Scottorum on account of its fame as a home to Irish peregrini. He was a penfriend and correspondent of Aldhelm, and it is from a surviving letter that much of our knowledge of Cellanus originates. Ludwig Traube believed him to be identical with the Abbot Cellanus whose obit is recorded in the Annales Laureshamenses under 706; and was probably the Cellan mac Sechnusaigh, sapiens, recorded in the same year in the Annals of Ulster (pp. 96‚Äì119, 1900). Traube furthermore attributed two hexameter poems to Cellanus (Traube, pp. 105‚Äì08, 1900). Panegyric to Saint Patrick Cellanus was thought to have been the composer of a panegyric in honour of Saint Patrick after the manner of Virgil, which was inscribed on the walls of a basilica at Peronne which was dedicated to Patrick. However, Lapidge (1994 pp 110‚Äì15,) attributes this to Abbot Boniface. Against this, Hoffmann (2001 p 17) and Howlett (1998 p 38), think the poem is probably Hiberno-Latin.

The 40th edition of the Liberty Bowl, the game matched the Tulane Green Wave of Conference USA (C-USA) and the BYU Cougars of the Western Athletic Conference (WAC). The game was sponsored by the Axa Equitable Life Insurance Company and was branded as the AXA/Equitable Liberty Bowl. Tulane won the game, 41‚Äì27, to finish‚Äîalong with the Tennessee Volunteers‚Äîas the only undefeated Division I-A teams for the 1998 NCAA Division I-A football season. Teams =Tulane= The 1998 Tulane squad entered the season with returning C-USA Offensive Player of the Year Shaun King at quarterback and picked to finish tied for second place with East Carolina in the preseason conference rankings. Following their week two victory over SMU, local media started to mention the Green Wave as a potential at-large opponent to play in the Sugar Bowl as part of the inaugural Bowl Championship Series (BCS). Although Tulane finished the regular season with an 11‚Äì0 record, since they finished outside the sixth position in the final BCS standings, the Green Wave did not qualify for a BCS bowl game. Instead they were invited to the Liberty Bowl as C-USA champions. The appearance in the game marked Tulane's first bowl since the 1987 Independence Bowl, and their third all-time appearance in the Liberty Bowl. Following the conclusion of the regular season, on December 2 head coach Tommy Bowden resigned as head coach to accept the same position at Clemson. At that time offensive coordinator Rich Rodriguez was named interim head coach through at least the Liberty Bowl. Although Rodriguez was thought to be the top candidate for the coaching vacancy, on December 7 Tulane announced Georgia offensive coordinator Chris Scelfo as Tulane's new head coach. At the time of the announcement, officials also stated Scelfo would serve as head coach in the bowl game instead of Rodriguez, and that most of Bowden's staff would remain in place for the Liberty Bowl. =BYU= After opening the season 2‚Äì3, BYU won seven consecutive games to earn a spot in the WAC Championship Game. In that contest, the Cougars lost to the Air Force 20‚Äì13. Prior to the championship game, the Cougars accepted a bid to play in the 40th Liberty Bowl. The appearance in the game marked BYU's first New Year's Eve bowl, and their first all-time appearance in the Liberty Bowl. In mid-December, BYU head coach LaVell Edwards announced that starting running back Ronney Jenkins and defensive back Heshimu Robertson would be suspended for the Liberty Bowl for violating the Brigham Young University Honor Code. Game summary In a game ultimately dominated by Tulane, BYU scored the first points of the game. Early in the first, Kevin Feterik hit Ben Horton for an 11-yard touchdown reception, and after Owen Pochman missed the extra point the Cougars took an early 6‚Äì0 lead. The Green Wave responded on the following drive with a 31-yard Brad Palazzo field goal to cut the lead in half. With BYU driving on the ensuing possession, Michael Jordan intercepted a Feterik pass and returned it 79 yards for touchdown. The return was the longest in the history on the Liberty Bowl and gave Tulane a 10‚Äì6 lead. In the second quarter, Shaun King scored on a three-yard run and Palazzo hit a 23-yard field goal to give Tulane a 20‚Äì6 lead at the half. King continued the scoring in the third with a pair of touchdown passes to cap two 82-yard drives. The first came on a 60-yard pass to Kerwin Cook and the second on a 13-yard pass to Jamaican Dartez. With Tulane leading 34‚Äì6 entering the fourth quarter, BYU scored the first of three late touchdowns on a three-yard Aaron Cupp touchdown run. Tulane responded on the next drive with its final points of the game on a five-yard Toney Converse run to extend their lead to 41‚Äì13. The Cougars closed the contest with an 18-yard Cupp reception for a score and a three-yard Reno Mahe touchdown run to bring the final score to 41‚Äì27. For his 276 yards passing, 109 yards rushing and three total touchdowns, Tulane quarterback Shaun King was named the game's Most Valuable Player.

of the Byzantine Empire in two periods: the first extends from the late Roman period (3rd century) to the conquest of the island by Andalusian exiles in the late 820s, and the second from the island's reconquest in 961 to its capture by the competing forces of Genoa and Venice in 1205.  History  = First Byzantine period= Under Roman rule, Crete was part of the joint province as Crete and Cyrenaica. Under Diocletian (r. 284‚Äì305) it was formed as a separate province, while Constantine the Great (r. 306‚Äì337) subordinated it to the Diocese of Moesiae (and later the Diocese of Macedonia) within the praetorian prefecture of Illyricum, an arrangement that persisted until the end of late antiquity.Kazhdan (1991), p. 545Nesbitt & Oikonomides (1994), p. 94Detorakis (1986), pp. 128‚Äì129 Some administrative institutions, like the venerable Koinon of the island, persisted until the end of the fourth century,Detorakis (1986), p. 129 but as elsewhere in the empire these provincial civic institutions were abandoned in face of the increasing power of imperial officials. Few contemporary sources mention Crete during the period from the 4th century to the Muslim conquest in the 820s. During this time, the island was very much a quiet provincial backwater in the periphery of the Greco-Roman world.Detorakis (1986), p. 128 Its bishops are even absent from the First Council of Nicaea in 325, in contrast to neighbouring islands like Rhodes or Kos.Hetherington (2001), p. 60 With the exception of an attack by the Vandals in 457 and the great earthquakes of 9 July 365, 415 448 and 531, which destroyed many towns, the island remained peaceful and prosperous, as testified by the numerous, large and well-built monuments from the period surviving on the island.Kazhdan (1991), p. 546Hetherington (2001), p. 61Detorakis (1986), pp. 131‚Äì132 In the 6th-century Synecdemus, Crete is marked as being governed by a consularis, with capital at Gortyn, and as many as 22 cities. The population in this period is estimated as high as 250,000, and was almost exclusively Christian, except for some Jews living in the main urban centres.Detorakis (1986), pp. 130‚Äì131 This peace was broken in the 7th century. Crete suffered a raid by the Slavs in 623,Detorakis (1986), p. 132 followed by Arab raids in 654 and the 670s, during the first wave of the early Muslim conquests,Treadgold (1997), pp. 313, 325Detorakis (1986), pp. 132‚Äì133 and again during the first decades of the 8th century, especially under Caliph al-Walid I (r. 705‚Äì715).Detorakis (1986), p. 133 Thereafter the island remained relatively safe, under the rule of an archon appointed by Constantinople.Treadgold (1997), p. 378 In ca. 732, the emperor Leo III the Isaurian transferred the island from the jurisdiction of the Pope to that of the Patriarchate of Constantinople. A strategos of Crete is attested in 767, and a seal of a tourmarches of Crete is known. This has led to suggestions that the island was constituted as a theme in the 8th century, perhaps as early as the 730s.cf. Detorakis (1986), pp. 129‚Äì130 Most scholars however do not consider the evidence conclusive enough and think it unlikely that the island was a theme at the time. =Arab conquest and Byzantine reconquest= Byzantine rule lasted until the late 820s, when a large group of exiles from Muslim Spain landed on the island and began its conquest. The Byzantines launched repeated expeditions to drive them back, and seem to have appointed a strategos to administer what parts of the island they still controlled. The successive campaigns were defeated however, and failed to prevent the establishment of the Saracen stronghold of Chandax on the northern coast, which became the capital of the new Emirate of Crete.Makrypoulias (2000), pp. 347‚Äì348 The fall of Crete to the Arabs posed a major headache for Byzantium, as it opened the coasts and islands of the Aegean Sea to piracy. The Byzantines besiege Chandax, from the Madrid Skylitzes A major Byzantine campaign in 842/843 under Theoktistos made some headway, and apparently allowed for the re-establishment of the recovered parts of the island as a theme, as evidenced by the presence of a strategos of Crete in the contemporary Taktikon Uspensky. However Theoktistos had to abandon the campaign, and the troops left behind were quickly defeated by the Saracens.Makrypoulias (2000), p. 351Treadgold (1997), p. 447 Further Byzantine attempts at reconquest in 911 and 949 failed disastrously,Makrypoulias (2000), pp. 352‚Äì356Treadgold (1997), pp, 470, 489 until in 960‚Äì961 the general Nikephoros Phokas, at the head of a huge army, landed on the island and stormed Chandax, restoring Crete to Byzantium.Treadgold (1997), p. 495 =Second Byzantine period= After the reconquest, the island was organized as a regular theme, with a strategos based at Chandax. Extensive efforts at conversion of the populace were undertaken, led by John Xenos and Nikon the Metanoeite. A regiment (taxiarchia) of 1000 men was raised as the island's garrison, under a separate taxiarches and subdivided into tourmai. Under Alexios I Komnenos (r. 1081‚Äì1118), the island was ruled by a doux or katepano. By the early 12th century, it came, along with southern Greece (the themes of Hellas and the Peloponnese) under the overall control of the megas doux, the commander-in-chief of the Byzantine navy. Aside from the revolt of its governor, Karykes, in 1092/1093, the island remained a relatively peaceful backwater, securely in Byzantine hands until the Fourth Crusade. During the Crusade, Crete appears to have been granted to Boniface I, Marquess of Montferrat as a pronoia by the emperor Alexios IV Angelos.Treadgold (1997), p. 710 Boniface however, unable to extend his control to the island, sold his rights to the island to the Republic of Venice. In the event, the island was seized by the Venetians' rivals, the Republic of Genoa,Treadgold (1997), pp. 712, 715 and it took Venice until 1212 to secure her control over the island and establish it as a Venetian colony, the Kingdom of Candia. Governors =Office of governor= According to the Notitia Dignitatum and the Synekdemos, Crete was governed by a consularis belonging to the senatorial rank of clarissimus between the 4th and 6th centuries. It was one of only four provinces of this rank or higher in the praetorian prefecture of Illyricum, the other eight being of lower rank. In 539, there is a lone attestation of a proconsul with the rank of spectabilis, suggesting that the province had been upgraded. The status of the province after early Muslim conquests, when the theme system was being instituted is unclear. It may have been part of the theme of Hellas or Peloponnese. It was a separate province governed by archons (an archontia) from the first half of the eighth century. These are mostly known from seals and can be ordered and dated only approximately. An archontia lacked the military resources of a theme and Crete's lower status relative to the themes was probably a factor in its inability to resist the Arab incursions without major expeditionary forces sent from elsewhere. Crete is not included in any surviving list of themes, either Byzantine or Arab. In the Taktikon of 842/843, there is reference to both a \\"patrician and strategos of Crete\\" and an \\"archon of Crete\\", implying that Crete had recently been raised to a theme and its governors from archon to strategos. This was probably a response to the Arab invasion. According to the Continuations of Theophanes, the Emperor Michael II (820‚Äì829) appointed Photeinos \\"to govern the affairs of Crete\\", probably around 828. He was probably the first strategos, although his authority would have been limited by the Arab conquests. With the failure of the campaign of Theoktistos in 843, the theme of Crete ceased to exist. =List of governors= ;Proconsul *Helios (539) ;Archon *Theophanes Lardotyros (c. 764‚Äì767), also called strategos and archisatrap in the Vita of Stephen the Younger *John (8th century), paraphylax *Leo (8th century), imperial spatharios *Basil (8th century), imperial spatharios *Baasakios (8th/9th century), imperial spatharios *Nicholas (8th/9th century), imperial spatharios and hypatos *Nicholas (8th/9th century), imperial spatharios *Petronas (first years of the 9th century), imperial spatharios *Constantine (first quarter of the 9th century), imperial spatharios ;Strategos *Photeinos (c. 828) *Arab rule (843‚Äì961) *Michael (10th/11th century), dishypatos *Basil (c. 1000), patrician *Bracheon Philaretos (c. 1028), protospatharios *Eumathios (1028), protospatharios ;Doux (katepano) *Michael Karantenos (1088‚Äì1089), vestarch *Karykes (1090‚Äì1092) *Nikephoros Diogenes (before 1094), son of Romanos IV *Michael (11th/12th century) *John Elladas (1118), protoproedros *John Straboromanos (mid-12th century) *Alexios Kontostephanos (1167), nephew of Manuel II *Constantine Doukas (1183) *Stephen Kontostephanos (1193) *Nikephoros Kontostephanos (1197)  References   Sources    * Category:Themes of the Byzantine Empire Category:Provinces of the Byzantine Empire ","title":"Byzantine Crete"},{"id":"30507617","text":"Megatzedes (), is an uninhabited Greek islet, in the Aegean Sea, close to the eastern coast of Crete.

It was launched on 7 March 2000 and required the user to purchase a new remote control with a slideout keyboard to type on. It used the built-in 2400 bit/s modem in the set-top box to connect to the ONdigital email centre. The service continued until 22 May 2002, when the phone line stopped accepting incoming calls following the collapse of the then-now rebranded ITV Digital on 3 May 2002. Service launch The service became available via an over-the-air update to the ONdigital set-top box which added the OnMail interface. This was in addition to the already existing 'Inbox', which could be accessed via the main menu. This menu was never used due to limitations of the existing software. Interface The onscreen interface was accessed via the ONdigital menu system (as opposed to the system menu which access the 'Inbox' described above). The interface was in a purple colour, as opposed to the standard green that the rest of the ONdigital software used. The user could thus distinguish it form the television functionality of the box, and because the contrast in colours made text easier to read. Limitations The system had clear limitations in many aspects. The main one was that it could only be used to access ONmail accounts, which had the addresses @onmail.co.uk. Additionally, a problem that became increasingly salient as the service aged was that there was no way of accessing attachments via the set-top box interface. This was not only because of the limited interface, but also because of the slowness of the inbuilt modem. Move to ONnet With the launch of the ONnet Service in June 2000, and the replacement of the 2400bit/s modem with the plug-in 56K modem of the new ONnet plug-in box, the ONmail service became accessible on set-top boxes through the ONmail web site. The website (www.onmail.co.uk) provided additional features that were lacking in the set-top box interface. Though this caused most users to switch to accessing the service through ONnet, many people still used the original interface as not all users had purchased an ONnet box. This was exacerbated by the impending launch of broadband services and the comparatively limited modem integrated in the new box.

Vicoprofen combines the analgesic and antitussive properties of hydrocodone with the analgesic, anti-inflammatory, and antipyretic properties of ibuprofen. In contrast to hydrocodone/acetaminophen combination analgesics such as Vicodin, this hydrocodone/ibuprofen avoids some of the liver toxicity which may occur from acetaminophen, but still presents significant dangers in hydrocodone overdose, namely respiratory depression. Vicoprofen is supplied in a fixed dose combination tablet which contains hydrocodone bitartrate, USP 7.5 mg with ibuprofen, USP 200 mg. Additional strengths of generic Vicoprofen are now available, in combinations of 5 mg/200 mg and 10 mg/200 mg respectively.  Medical uses  Hydrocodone/ibuprofen has a labeled indication for \\"short-term (generally <10 days) management of acute pain severe enough to require an opioid analgesic and for which alternative treatments are inadequate\\". = Pregnancy = Opioids such as hydrocodone cross the placenta, and can therefore affect the fetus. Studies have shown a possible association between opioids and adverse outcomes such as birth defects, poor fetal growth, stillbirth, and preterm delivery. Prolonged use of opioids by a pregnant mother can also lead to neonatal withdrawal syndrome. NSAIDs such as ibuprofen should generally be avoided in pregnancy, as there are conflicting reports of birth defects after in utero exposure. However, it is accepted that NSAIDs prevent closure of the fetal ductus arteriosus, which happens during the later stages of pregnancy. Because of this, ibuprofen should be avoided after 30 weeks gestation. = Breastfeeding = Hydrocodone and ibuprofen are excreted in breast milk, so appropriate caution should be taken when prescribing to breastfeeding mothers. = Special populations = There is no evidence to support altered pharmacokinetic properties due to differences in gender or age. However, this drug combination has not been tested in children.  Adverse effects  The side effects for hydrocodone/ibuprofen are a combination of the side effects of the component drugs. Side effects experienced in more than 10% of the population taking the drug include: headache, drowsiness, dizziness, constipation, nausea, and dyspepsia.  Pharmacology  = Pharmacokinetics = The two active components of the drug, ibuprofen and hydrocodone, do not affect each other's absorption characteristics or other pharmacokinetic parameters. After an oral dose, the peak level of hydrocodone in the blood is reached 1.7 hours after administration. The blood levels of ibuprofen peak 1.8 hours after oral administration.  History  = Discovery and development = The patent for Vicoprofen was filed in December 1984, and U.S. patent number 4,587,252 was granted in May 1986. Although ibuprofen and hydrocodone were already available on the market at this time, the fact that they had never been supplied together in a single formulation required approval from the FDA as if it were a new drug. Knoll filed an investigational new drug application on 30 December 1986. A new drug application was later filed by Knoll on 25 April 1996, and received final approval from the FDA on 23 September 1997. Vicoprofen tablets were initially formulated and packaged by Knoll, with ibuprofen supplied by Albemarle Corporation and hydrocodone supplied by Mallinckrodt Pharmaceuticals. The validity of Knoll's patent on Vicoprofen has been challenged in federal court. In September 2002, the U.S. District Court for the Norther District of Illinois granted a motion of invalidity filed by Teva Pharmaceuticals against Knoll's patent on Vicoprofen, ruling the patent was invalid as obvious. This ruling paved the way for Teva's abbreviated new drug application to be approved by the FDA which would allow them to manufacture and market their own generic. Knoll appealed the decision. In April 2003, Teva announced that its abbreviated new drug application had been approved by the FDA, and its generic would begin shipping immediately. In May 2004, the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit vacated the previous judgment by the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, and the case was remanded back for further court proceedings. Teva continued to sell its generic during this time. The patent for Vicoprofen expired on 18 December 2004, officially opening the drug to generic manufacture. In July 2016, the FDA approved another generic equivalent, manufactured by Aurobindo Pharma Limited. = Ownership and promotion = Knoll pharmaceuticals, originally founded in Germany in 1886, became a subsidiary of BASF (a German chemical company) in 1975. It was under their control when Vicoprofen was originally developed and approved. In March 2000, Knoll Pharmaceuticals and Abbott Laboratories, an American health care company, announced a co-promotion agreement for Vicoprofen, in which Abbott would promote Vicoprofen to its network of buyers, including physicians, hospitals, and surgical centers. In June 2002, Abbott Laboratories, paid $6.9 billion to acquire the entire Knoll pharmaceutical unit from BASF, including Vicoprofen. = DEA classification = Vicoprofen was originally approved as a schedule III drug, but was later reclassified to a schedule II drug based on the DEA reclassification of hydrocodone containing products effective 6 October 2014.  Research  The new drug application for Vicoprofen was approved based on data from both single and multiple dose analgesia trials. The single dose analgesia studies occurred in multiple surgical settings, including dental, back, and abdominal/gynecologic surgery in the U.S. and Puerto Rico. There were 1,537 patients enrolled over all trials, with 79% of the participants being female. There were 10 single dose analgesia trials included in the new drug application. All studies were similarly designed: after completion of a procedure in which pain was rated as moderate or severe, patients would be randomized into various treatment groups. The treatment groups included: ibuprofen only, hydrocodone only, Vicoprofen (hydrocodone/ibuprofen), and placebo. The participant's pain would then be tracked over the next several hours by the self reporting of pain scores. There were four multiple dose trials included in the new drug application. These studies were all completed in the U.S., in settings including burn unit, post-operatively, and chronic pain settings. A total of 683 patients were enrolled in all of the multiple dose trials, with 57% of the participants being women. These studies also looked at self reported pain intensities over a 5-day period of multiple dosing. In these studies, patients were either given the trial drug Vicoprofen or one of two an active controls: codeine with acetaminophen (Tylenol #3) or oxycodone with acetaminophen (Percocet), depending on the trial. Patients were allowed to take a dose as needed but no more than every 4 to 6 hours for up to 5 days. These trials measured efficacy based on parameters including self reported pain scores, number of doses used, and duration of treatment.  Society and culture  = Cost = The average wholesale price (AWP) of generic Vicoprofen varies based on the strength of the preparation. Pricing data gathered from Lexicomp in October 2017 indicates the AWP for a 100 count bottle of 7.5 mg/200 mg strength to be $114.62, a 100 count of 5 mg/200 mg strength to be $356.62 and a 100 count of 10 mg/200 mg strength to be $470.35. These prices are all for generic equivalents of Vicoprofen. = Utilization = In 2003, at the time of the approval announcement for the first generic equivalent, it was reported that annual sales of brand name Vicoprofen totaled $104 million. According to IMS, the hydrocodone/ibuprofen tablets 7.5 mg/200 mg, had an estimated market size of $15.7 million for the 12 months preceding May 2016.

The Valentine's Day-themed episode was written by series creator Ryan Murphy, directed by Tate Donovan, and premiered on Fox on February 8, 2011. In this episode, Director Will Schuester (Matthew Morrison) assigns the McKinley High School glee club to perform love songs in honor of Valentine's Day. Club member Finn Hudson (Cory Monteith) sets up a kissing booth for the occasion, to take advantage of his rising popularity and raise money for the club. At the Dalton Academy, Blaine Anderson (Darren Criss) and the Dalton Academy Warblers make plans to perform a musical number outside of the campus, and Kurt Hummel (Chris Colfer) confesses his love for Blaine. \\"Silly Love Songs\\" was met with critical acclaim, with much of the praise stemming from the character development and the musical performances. Melissa Maerz of the Los Angeles Times, Emily VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club, and Lisa de Moraes of The Washington Post all deemed the storyline as entertaining, while Joel Keller of the TV Squad went on to call the episode \\"the best episode of the season.\\" The episode features cover versions of six songs, including a cover of \\"P.Y.T.\\" by Michael Jackson and \\"My Funny Valentine\\" from the musical Babes in Arms. Many of the covers and performances were met with positive reception from critics and fans alike, with much of the praise going to the Glee covers of \\"Fat Bottomed Girls\\" by Queen and \\"Silly Love Songs\\" by Paul McCartney, respectively. All songs with the exception of \\"My Funny Valentine\\" were released as singles and made available for digital download. Upon its initial airing, the episode was watched by just under 11.58 million American viewers, and it garnered a 4.6/13 Nielsen rating/share in the 18‚Äì49 demographic. Both the total viewership and ratings were significantly down from the previous episode, \\"The Sue Sylvester Shuffle\\", which aired immediately after the Super Bowl. Plot Glee club director Will Schuester (Matthew Morrison) gives New Directions a love song assignment. Having fallen for the group's newest member Lauren Zizes (Ashley Fink), Puck (Mark Salling) serenades her with Queen's \\"Fat Bottomed Girls\\". Lauren finds his song choice insulting and stands him up on a pre-Valentine's date, but eventually agrees to spend Valentine's Day with him as friends. Artie Abrams (Kevin McHale) and Mike Chang (Harry Shum Jr.) celebrate their respective relationships by performing Michael Jackson's \\"P.Y.T. (Pretty Young Thing)\\" for their girlfriends, Brittany Pierce (Heather Morris) and Tina Cohen-Chang (Jenna Ushkowitz). Tina later begins to sing \\"My Funny Valentine\\" to Mike, but is too overcome with emotion, and begins to cry while continuing to sing. Finn Hudson (Cory Monteith) sets up a kissing booth, to take advantage of his popularity in the hope of kissing his ex-girlfriend Quinn Fabray (Dianna Agron). He also wants to donate the proceeds to the glee club. Quinn initially refuses to buy a kiss from Finn, but does so at the insistence of her boyfriend Sam Evans (Chord Overstreet), who is suspicious of their relationship. The kiss further re-ignites Finn and Quinn's feelings for one another, and they begin an affair. Santana Lopez (Naya Rivera), angry for having recently had her bad behavior highlighted by the other club members, conspires to give them mono and reveal Quinn's infidelity. Finn's most recent ex-girlfriend Rachel Berry (Lea Michele) is dismayed by his renewed feelings for Quinn, but resolves to concentrate on her career instead of romance, and leads the female New Directions members in a performance of Katy Perry's \\"Firework\\". At Dalton Academy, a private school attended by former New Directions member Kurt Hummel (Chris Colfer), the object of his affection Blaine Anderson (Darren Criss) announces his intention to sing a love song to his crush. Kurt believes that Blaine has feelings for him, so is disappointed when his crush turns out to be Jeremiah (Alexander Nifong), the assistant manager at a local Gap store. The Dalton Academy Warblers accompany Blaine as he serenades Jeremiah with Robin Thicke's \\"When I Get You Alone\\". Jeremiah is subsequently fired and rebuffs Blaine. Kurt confesses his feelings to Blaine, who tells Kurt that he cares for him but is terrible at romance, and does not want to risk damaging their friendship. The episode ends with New Directions assembled at Breadstix, a local restaurant, where the Warblers perform the titular \\"Silly Love Songs\\". Production \\"Silly Love Songs\\" was first announced by Glee co-creator Ryan Murphy in an interview with a German journalist. The name of the episode and its airdate were announced shortly after the announcement of the show getting a short-term hiatus due to various cast members contracting the flu. Inspiration for the episode may be partially related to a lobbying effort by Paul McCartney to have covers of songs by The Beatles incorporated into Glee. In an interview with various reporters at the 2010 Teen Choice Awards, Murphy revealed that he received a mixtape that was sent from McCartney, who is reportedly a fan of the series. Recurring characters who appear in this episode include glee club members Mike Chang (Harry Shum, Jr.), Sam Evans (Chord Overstreet), and Lauren Zizes (Ashley Fink), football coach Shannon Beiste (Dot-Marie Jones), and Blaine Anderson (Darren Criss) the lead singer of the Dalton Academy Warblers. \\"Silly Love Songs\\" features cover versions of six songs: Katy Perry's \\"Firework\\", Queen's \\"Fat Bottomed Girls\\", Michael Jackson's \\"P.Y.T. (Pretty Young Thing)\\", \\"My Funny Valentine\\" from the musical Babes in Arms, \\"When I Get You Alone\\" by Robin Thicke, and \\"Silly Love Songs\\" by Paul McCartney and his band Wings. This was the fourth time a song by Katy Perry was used in a Glee episode, with the previous covers being \\"I Kissed a Girl\\" in the pilot, \\"Teenage Dream\\" on the episode \\"Never Been Kissed\\" and \\"California Gurls\\" on the previous episode \\"The Sue Sylvester Shuffle\\". All songs with the exception of \\"My Funny Valentine\\" were released as singles and made available for digital download. All five singles were included on Glee soundtrack albums: \\"Firework\\", \\"P.Y.T. (Pretty Young Thing)\\", and \\"Fat Bottomed Girls\\" were featured in the sixth soundtrack album, Glee: The Music, Volume 5, while \\"Silly Love Songs\\" and \\"When I Get You Alone\\" were featured on the seventh, Glee: The Music Presents the Warblers. Reception =Ratings= \\"Silly Love Songs\\" was originally broadcast in the United States on Fox on February 8, 2011. It received just under 11.58 million American viewers upon its initial airing, despite airing simultaneously with NCIS on CBS, The Biggest Loser on NBC, No Ordinary Family on ABC, and One Tree Hill on The CW. It garnered a 4.6/13 Nielsen rating/share in the 18‚Äì49 demographic, the highest rating of the night. This episode's total viewership and ratings were significantly down from the previous episode, \\"The Sue Sylvester Shuffle\\", which was watched by over 26.8 million American viewers and received an 11.1/29 rating/share in the 18‚Äì49 demographic. In Canada, where it also aired on February 8, 2011, the episode was watched by over 2.08 million viewers. It ranked number ten in the most- watched television programs of the week. The total viewership slightly declined from the previous episode, which attained 2.16 million viewers, as well as being the ninth most-watched television program of the week. In Australia, where the episode aired on February 21, 2011, it was viewed by 921,000 viewers upon its initial airing. It was the eleventh most-watched program on the night.

It placed tenth in the weekly viewership rankings. In the UK, the episode was watched by 2.629 million viewers (2.233 million on E4, and 396,000 on E4+1), becoming the most-watched show on E4 and E4 +1 for the week, and the most-watched show on cable for the week. =Critical response= The cover version for \\"Silly Love Songs\\" by Paul McCartney (pictured) was met with general acclaim. \\"Silly Love Songs\\" was met with critical acclaim from many television critics upon its initial airing. Erica Futterman of Rolling Stone gave a very positive review of the episode, and wrote, \\"This was our favorite type of Glee episode. Though we enjoy over-the-top spectacles [...], the show's real cleverness shines when they take songs from across the board and fit them into a cohesive storyline. Sue Sylvester didn't make an appearance and‚Äîdare we say it‚Äîwe didn't even miss her.\\" Bobby Hankinson of the Houston Chronicle enjoyed the episode, going on to write, \\"I thought it was a strong showing, if a little disjointed. Well, at least it was honest. If this show is one thing, it's disjointed. It's part of its spazzy appeal.\\" Melissa Maerz of the Los Angeles Times gave the episode a positive review: \\"On Tuesday night, Glee wasn‚Äôt only back at its usual time, it was back to doing what it does best: giving us entertaining [...] storylines involving characters we care about who sing songs that emerge organically and advance the story. It was like a perfect heart-shaped bubble of an episode reminding the show‚Äôs fans about all the things we‚Äôve missed about the show these last couple of months.\\" Robert Canning of IGN also gave the episode a positive review, and opined, \\"With the dissing of glee club temporarily put on hold, Glee the series was able to have a little fun with Tuesday night's episode. And fun it was, with the gang of New Directions taking on Valentine's Day, with flirting, kissing and, of course, singing. Without the bullying, this was a much lighter episode of Glee, and the results gave way to a lot more laughs and story development.\\" He went on to praise Ashley Fink's performance as Lauren Zizes, and said of Puck's falling in love with Lauren, \\"I can't decide if I want to root for this couple, but I certainly know I'm going to be rooting for Lauren.\\" Canning ultimately gave the episode an 8.5 out of 10. Wyndham Wyeth of Paste went on to praise the episode for its depiction of relationships in high school, as well as the backing vocals for Salling's performance of \\"Fat Bottomed Girls\\" by Queen. Emily VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club gave the episode a positive review and a grade of \\"A‚àí\\": Silly Love Songs' is a fine example of the show at what's very nearly its absolute best. There‚Äôs nothing too heady here, but if the show has one tone that it's nailed almost completely consistently, it‚Äôs the feeling of teenage romance, the sense that the person you're in love with is the only person you will ever be in love with [...] followed almost immediately by the crippling feeling of heartbreak, of losing that person too soon. Teenage life moves fast and is filled with heightened emotions. And like most musicals, Glee has always been at its best when it embraces those two sides of its characters' lives. As such, 'Silly Love Songs', which is pretty much just an excuse to play around with the show's many romantic pairings among its glee club characters, is a lot of fun without trying all that hard.\\" In conclusion of her review, she wrote, \\"The best episodes play that elation and devastation off of each other. The worst episodes flounder about for some sort of emotional foothold. But when Glee just tells small, sweet stories about these kids and the ways they're trying to cope with being in high school when they know they're meant for bigger things, it can be terrific. Tonight was one of those episodes, and tonight's episode was terrific. Here's to a good February sweeps.\\" Matt Richenthal of TV Fanatic gave the episode a 4.6 out of 5 stars, and went on to describe the episode as \\"A funny, touching, entertaining Glee episode that didn't feature a single line from Sue Sylvester? I never thought I'd see the day. But that's exactly what transpired on 'Silly Love Songs', as the show stopped feeling like a Public Service Announcement for a week and actually focused on well-paced, well-written relationship developments among its core characters.\\" Joel Keller of TV Squad gave the episode a positive review, and wrote, Silly Love Songs' strikes an interesting contrast to Sunday night's post-Super Bowl episode in that tonight was more about the kids and where they are in their stories than about big production numbers and Sue's cartoon evilness. It was also the funniest episode of the season, in no small part because we got some insight into the lives of two New Directions members we rarely get to hang out with for any length of time: Santana and Lauren.\\" James Poniewozik of Time Magazine praised the storyline and the musical performances of the episode. However, Soraya Roberts of the Daily News gave the episode a negative review: \\"This show sometimes sounds like it was written by a PIT, prime idiot TV writer. It's almost as bad as Tina breaking down into tears for no reason while singing 'My Funny Valentine' to Mike and Blaine attempting to channel Frank Sinatra while singing Paul McCartney's 'Silly Love Songs' in the middle of Breadsticks.\\" Lisa de Moraes of The Washington Post praised the storyline, calling it cohesive. =Musical performances= Critics reacted positively to Puck's (Mark Salling, pictured) rendition of \\"Fat Bottomed Girls\\". The musical covers and performances for the episode were mostly well received by critics and fans alike. Sandra Gonzalez of Entertainment Weekly stated that her favorite was \\"Silly Love Songs\\" by Paul McCartney, performed by the Warblers. In a review of the performance, she wrote, \\"This is much more Warbler-esque than 'When I Get You Alone'. I had also been worried we wouldn't get our weekly dose of dorky Warbler dance moves. Plus, major points for the blink-and-you'll-miss-it moment when Blaine sang the love 'won't come at all' line to Santana. It was probably my personal biggest laugh-out-loud moment of the episode.\\" She gave the performance an \\"A\\". She also praised Puck's performance of \\"Fat Bottomed Girls\\", and opined, \\"In general, I'm in love with Mark Salling's voice. He's right up there with Artie [...] in my book. And this song was smothered in awesome sauce. Bonus points for Puck's sort-of-feminine head bob, Brittany's background groovin', the club's reactions to him singing to Lauren, and Mr. Schu's mild eye-roll.\\" She went on to give the performance an \\"A‚àí\\". Kristin Coachman of the Seattle Post-Intelligencer was a bit more critical of Puck's cover of the song: \\"This week Mark Salling [...] is singing Queen's 'Fat Bottomed Girls'. I know this song fits in with Puck's storyline for the episode, but I feel like the song was in the wrong key for him. At times it sounded like he was straining to hit the higher notes. Because of this, I have to wonder if the backing vocals are purposely drowning his voice out. It seems depending on the song selection for him, Salling's vocal performances continue to be very hit or miss this season.\\" Tina's cover of \\"My Funny Valentine\\" stirred mixed emotions in Gonzalez. She criticized the ending: \\"When she started sobbing, it got weird. Then weirder. Then downright uncomfortable.\\" However, she liked the earlier part of the performance, and wrote, \\"It was √ºbersweet when Tina started getting choked up during her song, because let's face it, it happens. You can love someone so much it hurts. If she would have continued the song with a mild lump in her throat, I think I might have gotten choked up with her.\\" Rachel's cover of \\"Firework\\" by Katy Perry was reviewed negatively by Coachman. She wrote, \\"I'm not loving Michele‚Äôs vocals on this track. It was like they wanted to purposely make her sound like Katy Perry. As much as I really like Katy Perry, Michele has more of a tremendous voice. There are parts where I thought she sounded really great, but for the most part this song just wasn't my cup of tea. Michele has such a beautiful voice; I wish she was given songs that would allow her to showcase it to her advantage.\\" Katie Morgan of Billboard gave a positive review of the Warblers' performance of \\"Silly Love Songs\\", writing, \\"Not only do they sound great [...], but the song brings a sugary sweet end to a super-saccharine episode.\\" The Marquee Blog at CNN gave the music numbers a positive review. A notable segment reads: \\"I just loved seeing The Warblers get their groove on amidst the jeans and cotton T-shirts. And Kurt was super gracious trying to be supportive of Blaine, in spite of his own feelings. I also totally loved the music [...] and overall this was one of my favorite episodes this season. Brett Berk of Vanity Fair praised Salling's performance of \\"Fat Bottomed Girls\\", as well as the casts' performances of \\"P.Y.T.\\" by Michael Jackson and \\"When I get You Alone\\" by Robin Thicke. Erica Futterman of Rolling Stone gave Salling's performance a positive review. She wrote, \\"We were thoroughly entertained by Puck's attempt to win newbie Lauren Zizes over with his tribute to her larger figure. Only in Puck's world would Queen's raucous song qualify as a serenade‚Äîand our horror-turned-amusement was mirrored on his fellow New Directions' faces. Puck is no Freddie Mercury, but he handles the melody well and makes up for lack of range with swagger.\\" =Chart history= All five of the cover versions released as singles debuted on the Billboard Hot 100, and appeared on other musical charts. With these new Hot 100 debuts, plus the debut the same week of \\"She's Not There\\" from the prior episode \\"The Sue Sylvester Shuffle\\", which had aired two days before \\"Silly Love Songs\\", the Glee Cast passed Elvis Presley's record of 108 singles on the Hot 100, reaching 113 singles.
