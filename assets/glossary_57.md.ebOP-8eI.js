This gene encodes the IFNL4 protein, which is involved in immune response to viral infection. IFNL4 is similar to three neighboring genes (IFNL1, IFNL2 and IFNL3) in that proteins encoded by these genes bind to a shared co-receptor complex. Formation of this complex leads to activation of the JAK-STAT signalling pathway and upregulation of numerous interferon- stimulated genes. Genetics variants within or near this gene have been linked to clearance of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection and other phenotypes.  Discovery  The first three interferon lambda genes were discovered in 2003 by two independent research groups that used different nomenclatures in their reports. In 2013, Prokunina-Olsson et al. reported the presence a fourth gene in this region, which they discovered after treating human hepatocytes with polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid (poly I:C) to simulate HCV infection and induce expression of interferon lambda genes. RNA sequencing revealed the presence of IFNL4, which had been overlooked previously, in the interferon lambda region. In 2003, the Human Genome Organization Gene Nomenclature Committee (HUGO NC) had designated the first three genes found in this region as interleukins, but HUGO NC reconsidered that decision upon discovery of the fourth gene ten years later. Today, these four genes are recognized as interferon lambda genes, with official symbols of IFNL1 (formerly IL29), IFNL2 (formerly IL28A), IFNL3 (formerly IL28B) and IFNL4.  Structure  The interferon lambda genes lie in the 19q13.13 chromosomal region. IFNL4 is located between IFNL3 and IFNL2. The IFNL4 gene contains five exons and the full IFNL4 protein consists of 179 amino acids. The proteins encoded by the IFNL1, IFNL2, and IFNL3 genes have high amino-acid sequence similarity. IFNL2 and IFNL3 share ~96% amino-acid identity, and IFNL1 shares ~81% identity with IFNL2 and IFNL3. IFNL4 differs considerably from other members of this family. IFNL4 is most closely related to IFNL3, however, these proteins share only ~30% amino-acid identity. Similarity between IFNL3 and IFNL4 is greatest for the A and F helices, where lambda interferons interact with the IFNLR1 receptor, and least in the D helix, where they interact with IL10R2, the second component of the interferon lambda receptor complex. = Genetic variants = In 2009 (i.e., before the discovery of IFNL4), results from genome wide association studies (GWAS) indicated that single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) near IFNL3 (rs12979860, rs8099917, and others) strongly associated with response to pegylated interferon-Œ± and ribavirin treatment and spontaneous clearance of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. As the gene then known as IL28B was the closest known gene at the time, these genetic variants were called ‚ÄòIL28B variants‚Äô and it was assumed that the observed associations reflected differences in the structure or regulation of that gene. However, discovery of IFNL4 revealed many of these variants to be within or nearest to IFNL4. The rs12979860 SNP is located within intron 1 of IFNL4, while rs8099917 lies in an intergenic region, but nearest to IFNL4. IFNL4 contains a polymorphism that controls the generation of the IFNL4 protein. The IFNL4-ŒîG/TT (rs368234815, previously ss469415590) dinucleotide variant is composed of the rs11322783 (Œî/T) and rs74597329 (G/T) SNPs. Because those SNPs are in full linkage disequilibrium, rs368234815, rs11322783 and rs74597329 all provide the same information. In the NCBI dbSNP database, rs368234815 been merged into rs11322783. In the Genome Aggregation Database, however, IFNL4-ŒîG/TT is represented by rs74597329. IFNL4-ŒîG generates the complete IFNL4 protein while IFNL4-TT results in a frameshift that prematurely terminates the protein, producing truncated polypeptides without known biological function. Another functional polymorphism within IFNL4 alters the protein's biological function. A non-synonymous variant located in exon 2 (rs117648444) substitutes a serine for a proline at amino acid position 70 (P70S) when present on a haplotype that includes the IFNL4-ŒîG allele. In vitro studies have demonstrated the IFNL4 S70 protein has weaker biological function than IFNL4 P70. Specifically, IFNL4 S70 produced lower levels of interferon- stimulated gene expression and less antiviral activity compared to IFNL4 P70.  Population genetics  Although the IFNL4 gene is present in all primates (and most non-primate mammals except mice or rats), humans are the only species in which the allele that abrogates IFNL4 has been found. The chromosomal region containing IFNL4 has undergone the strongest selection of any region that harbors an interferon gene. Specifically, there has been very strong evolutionary selection for the IFNL4-TT variant, which ‚Äòknocks out‚Äô production of the IFNL4 protein. This allele likely arose just before the out- of-Africa migration and underwent immediate selection in the African population. That selection strengthened in European and Asian populations. As a result, whereas ~95% of individuals of African ancestry carry at least one copy of the IFNL4-ŒîG allele and are able to produce IFNL4, that percentage drops to ~50% in Europeans and <15% in Asians. Comparison of African and East Asian populations revealed the IFNL4-TT allele to be among the most differentiated variants genome-wide. It is unlikely HCV infection exerted the selection pressure that created these striking differences, as HCV did not become common until the twentieth century, and chronic HCV infection has too long of a course to majorly impact reproduction. There is high linkage disequilibrium between the IFNL4-ŒîG/TT variant and the rs12979860 and rs8099917 SNPs. Linkage disequilibrium between IFNL4-ŒîG/TT and IFNL4 rs12979860 is complete in Asian populations (r2=1.0) and strong among those of European (r2>0.9), but weaker in African populations (r2~0.7). For rs8099917, linkage disequilibrium with IFNL4-ŒîG/TT is strong in Asian populations, moderate in Europeans, and weak in Africans. The IFNL4-ŒîG/TT and rs117648444 variants present in three observed haplotypes that can modify or abrogate the IFNL4 protein. These haplotypes are: IFNL4-ŒîG: rs117648444-G, which creates the IFNL4 P70 protein; IFNL4-ŒîG: rs117648444-A, which creates the IFNL4 S70 protein; IFNL4-TT: rs117648444-G, which does not generate a full IFNL4 protein.  Associated phenotypes  IFNL4 genetic variants are associated with a variety of phenotypes, including immune response to HCV infection, selection for HCV variants, hepatic inflammation and fibrosis, as well as certain opportunistic viral infections, and cancers. = HCV clearance = Genotype for the IFNL4-ŒîG/TT variant (and SNPs in linkage disequilibrium with that polymorphism) associate with both spontaneous clearance of HCV infection and successful treatment of chronic hepatitis C. Interferon lambda became a focus of HCV research when studies associated the rs12979860 and rs8099917 SNPs with response to pegylated interferon-Œ± and ribavirin treatment for chronic hepatitis C, and spontaneous HCV clearance. Compared to populations of European or Asian ancestry, African American populations demonstrated a lower frequency of the rs12979860-CC genotype, which is associated with viral clearance. That observation provided an explanation for previously observed racial differences in HCV treatment response and spontaneous clearance. The demonstrated association between genotype for the rs12979860 SNP and treatment led the US Food and Drug Administration to recommend testing for ‚ÄúIL28B‚Äù in clinical trials for new HCV treatments. Studies have been predominantly conducted on HCV genotype 1, but the association between IFNL4 genotype and impaired HCV clearance has been observed for other HCV genotypes as well. IFNL4-ŒîG/TT is the likely primary functional variant that accounts for this association. High linkage disequilibrium between marker SNPs (e.g., rs12979860) and candidate explanatory genetic variants (e.g., IFNL4-ŒîG/TT) present a challenge in identifying functional polymorphisms. However, weaker linkage disequilibrium between IFNL4-ŒîG/TT and IFNL4 rs12979860 in populations of African ancestry facilitate comparison of those polymorphisms, and in African American populations IFNL4-ŒîG/TT was shown to be a better predictor than rs12979860 for response to treatment with pegylated interferon-Œ±/ribavirin therapy and spontaneous HCV clearance. These findings were confirmed in a larger study of spontaneous clearance in an African American population and extended to European populations. Associations between HCV clearance and genotype for the IFNL4-ŒîG/TT polymorphism are strong. Among patients enrolled in the Virahep-C Trial, odds ratios for achieving a sustained virological response after treatment pegylated-interferon alpha/ribavirin (IFNL4-TT/TT versus IFNL4- ŒîG/ŒîG) were 2.90 in African- Americans and 4.42 in European-Americans. In the HALT-C cohort, even larger odds ratios were observed for sustained virological response: 11.0 and 6.94 among African-Americans and European-Americans, respectively. Haplotypes that include the SNP (rs117648444),which controls the IFNL4 P70S protein variant, also associate with HCV clearance. In population studies, the variant that creates IFNL4 S70 associates with increased rates of spontaneous HCV clearance and better treatment response. In in vitro studies, the derived IFNL4 S70 protein produces reduced intrahepatic interferon stimulating gene expression and antiviral activity relative to IFNL4 P70. These results provide additional evidence that reduced IFNL4 activity improves HCV clearance. = Selection for HCV variants = IFNL4 genotype may affect the HCV genome by selecting for certain viral strains, including those that lead to resistance to treatment. A genome-to-genome analysis revealed IFNL4 rs12979860 to be associated with variation for many amino acids in the HCV genome. HCV-infected patients with the rs12979860-CC genotype (i.e., those who do not generate the IFNL4 protein) had a higher frequency of non-synonymous HCV variants than patients with non- CC genotypes. Certain direct acting antiviral agents (DAAs) used to treat HCV infection target the HCV NS5A protein. HCV variants in which histidine is substituted for tyrosine at amino acid position 93 (NS5A Y93H) may cause resistance to those agents and decrease treatment success. Patients with the NS5A Y93H variant are less likely to respond to NS5A inhibitors such as daclatasvir, ledipasvir and ombitasvir, which are commonly used in popular DAA regimens (e.g., Harvoni). Patients with the IFNL4-TT/TT genotype were shown to have a higher frequency of the NS5A Y93H substitution than those who carried the ŒîG allele. Consistent with those results, the IFNL4 rs12979860-C/C genotype was strongly shown to be associated with the prevalence of the Y93H variant in patients infected with HCV genotype 1b. = Hepatic inflammation and fibrosis = IFNL4 genotypes associated with increased HCV clearance and treatment response have also been linked to increased hepatic inflammation and fibrosis progression, which can lead to development of cirrhosis and liver cancer. The rs8099917-G allele, which is in high linkage disequilibrium with IFNL4-ŒîG and associates with reduced HCV clearance, has been associated with decreased necroinflammation, fibrosis and fibrosis progression. Consistent with that finding, individuals with chronic hepatitis C and the rs12979860-CC genotype tended to display higher portal inflammation, although analysis of paired biopsy results did not reveal associations between this genotype and fibrosis progression. Extending those findings, rs12979860-CC genotype was shown to be associated with increased inflammation and fibrosis not only in chronic HCV patients, but also in those with chronic hepatitis B or nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. Like with HCV, linkage disequilibrium poses a challenge in identifying the functional polymorphism for these associations. In a study of HCV-infected African Americans and European ancestry patients undergoing liver transplantation, donor genotype for IFNL4-ŒîG/TT was a stronger predictor of post-transplant fibrosis progression than genotype for rs12979860. However, in a second study on patients of European ancestry with chronic hepatitis C, linkage disequilibrium between IFNL4-ŒîG/TT, IFNL4 rs12979860 and another variant in IFNL3 3‚Äô untranslated region (rs4803217) was too strong to discern genotype differences for hepatic inflammation and fibrosis. In contrast to results from studies of HCV clearance, no differences between genotypes that generated different variants of the IFNL4 protein (IFNL4 P70S) were found for either fibrosis or inflammation. = Risk of cancer = GWAS have been conducted for a large range of malignancies. However, a GWAS association between IFNL4 genotype and cancer is limited to risk of a rare subtype of ovarian cancer. GWAS performed by an international consortium revealed the IFNL4-ŒîG allele, which generates the IFNL4 protein, was associated with a decreased risk of mucinous ovarian carcinoma. The explanation for this association remains to be determined. In a candidate gene studies, associations with IFNL4 genotype have been reported for prostate cancer and Kaposi's sarcoma. IFNL4-ŒîG associated with an increased risk of prostate cancer among men with sexually transmitted infections. In a Swiss cohort, men who carried the rs8099917-G allele, which is in linkage disequilibrium with IFNL4-ŒîG in European populations, had an increased risk of Kaposi's sarcoma. = Other infections = Studies on IFNL4 variants and other infectious diseases have yielded mixed results. In a European population, individuals who carry the IFNL4 rs12979860-T allele (and therefore generate IFNL4 protein) were found to have more episodes of severe herpes labialis, which is caused by the herpes simplex virus. However, in a large cohort of HIV-infected women, genotype for the IFNL4-ŒîG/TT polymorphism was not associated with herpes simplex virus-related outcomes, including episodes of oral or genital herpes. Human cytomegalovirus (human betaherpesvirus 5) infection can be reactivated in patients who become immunocompromised after organ transplantation or due to advanced HIV infection. Homozygosity for IFNL4-ŒîG has been linked to increased risk for cytomegalovirus retinitis in HIV patients. Additionally, the IFNL4-ŒîG allele has been associated with both higher rates of cytomegalovirus replication and more symptoms due to cytomegalovirus infection in both solid-organ and stem cell transplant patients.  Function  Interferon lambda proteins are signaling proteins involved in immune response to viral infection. These proteins are classified as type-III interferons because they use the IFNLR1 and IL10R2 receptors for signaling. Signaling initiated by IFNL or IFN-Œ± triggers the JAK-STAT pathway, leading to the expression of numerous interferon-stimulated genes with anti- viral and anti-proliferative effects. In contrast to the ubiquitous expression of receptors for IFN-Œ±, IFNLR1 is largely restricted to tissues of epithelial origin. Therefore, interferon lambda proteins may have evolved specifically to protect the epithelium. In vitro studies have revealed that interferon- stimulated gene expression and anti-viral activity induced by recombinant IFNL4 are comparable to that induced by IFNL3, however, the antiviral effects of IFNL4 have faster onset than those produced by other members of the interferon lambda family. Because interferons are generally considered to be antiviral cytokines and IFNL4 has demonstrated such anti-viral properties, it seems paradoxical that producing IFNL4 protein is linked to impaired clearance of HCV. The explanation for this paradox is not fully understood. Higher interferon stimulated gene expression associated with IFNL4 indicate that this protein does have in vivo antiviral effects, but, at least for HCV infection, other manifestations seem to override those influences. While most interferon stimulated genes have antiviral effects, some may enhance viral replication. IFNL4 induces expression of USP18 and ISG15, which interfere with the function of IFN-Œ±, although it is not clear that this occurs in vivo during HCV infection. SOCS1, another negative regulator of the immune response to viral infections, may also be induced by IFNL4. It is possible that IFNL4 interferes with the antiviral activity of other interferons. There is evidence that IFNL4 desensitizes the response to IFN-Œ± treatment in chronic hepatitis C through long-term induction of negative regulators of the interferon response and that IFNL4 acts faster than other type III IFNs in inducing such genes.  Research  Prior to the discovery of IFNL4, genotype for the rs12979860 SNP was used to predict response of HCV-infected patients to treatment with pegylated interferon-Œ±/ribavirin therapy. Newer regimens based on combinations of DAAs are much more effective than pegylated interferon-Œ±/ribavirin and testing for IFNL4 genotype is not currently recommended for those regimens. However, DAA regimens remain expensive. It could be cost effective to use IFNL4 genotype to predict response to shorter than standard duration treatment. Treatment duration could be personalized for individual patients or populations, such as for East Asians, who have a high frequency of the IFNL4-TT/TT genotype. Recent studies, primarily in mouse models, have demonstrated that other members of the interferon lambda family provide tissue barrier protection against a wide range of viral pathogens, including neuroinvasive West Nile virus infection, respiratory infections including influenza and gastrointestinal viruses such as norovirus and rotavirus. Given the strong evolutionary selection against the IFNL4 protein-generating IFNL4-ŒîG allele, genotype for the IFNL4-ŒîG/TT variant may play an important role in other infectious diseases, therefore, future epidemiological studies should examine those relationships. Interferons are generally considered to be anti-viral cytokines that are generated in response to viral invasion. Results from studies of IFNL4 variants challenge that paradigm. IFNL4 has anti-viral properties in vitro, yet individuals who cannot generate this protein (homozygous for IFNL4-TT), are more likely to clear infection with HCV. Furthermore, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease is not caused by a viral infection, so this condition would not be expected to induce expression of interferons. Unexpectedly, IFNL4 genotype affects the development of hepatic inflammation and fibrosis in patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. Future research aimed at understanding these paradoxes may further our understanding of interferon biology.

Gillmer and first built in 1978.Sherwood, Richard M.: A Field Guide to Sailboats of North America, Second Edition, pages 230-231. Houghton Mifflin Company, 1994. Production The design was built by C. E. Ryder in Bristol, Rhode Island, United States, but it is now out of production. Design The Southern Cross 28 is a recreational keelboat, built predominantly of fiberglass, with teak wood trim. The deck is fiberglass with a balsa core, while the hull is fiberglass with an Airtex foam core. The design has a cutter sloop rig, with a boom-mounted, self-tending staysail, a teak bowsprit, a spooned raked stem, a raised transom, a skeg-mounted rudder controlled by a tiller and a fixed swept fin keel. The keel design is a modified long keel, with a cutout for the propeller shaft, creating a fin keel. It displaces and carries of lead ballast. The boat has a draft of with the standard keel fitted. The boat is fitted with a Universal Atomic 4 gasoline engine for docking and maneuvering. The fuel tank holds and the fresh water tank has a capacity of . The galley is mounted on the port side at the bottom of the companionway stairs, with a sink and two-burner, alcohol-fired stove. The icebox is mounted to starboard and serves as a navigation table as well. The head is forward, just behind the bow \\"V\\"-berth and includes storage space and a hanging locker. It has privacy doors. Additional sleeping accommodation in the main cabin includes a port settee that extends under the head and a starboard settee that opens to a double. The interior wooden trim is all teak. Ventilation is provided by dorade vents, three cowl vents, a forward hatch and six opening portlights. A midship opening hatch was a factory option. The boat came factory-equipped with two halyard winches and two genoa winches. A topping lift and jiffy reefing were standard. Optional factory equipment included roller furling, a boom vang, spinnaker and tracks for the genoa. The design has a PHRF racing average handicap of 230. Operational history Sailor Donna Lange completed two solo global circumnavigations on board her Southern Cross 28, named Inspired Insanity. Her 2005 voyage lasted 17 months and she repeated the trip in 2015. During the latter voyage the boat experienced a knockdown and dismasting in winds. As a result, Lange took the boat though the Panama Canal instead of rounding Cape Horn. In a review of the design, Richard Sherwood wrote, \\"the keel is modified full, and the rudder skeg is substantial. Forward, the hull flares. Displacement is moderate. With a self-tending staysail, single-handing is simple. As with all cutters, the amount of sail carried can be varied significantly. As the manufacturer says, the Southern Cross 'looks like a sailboat.'\\" In a 2018 review, Sailing magazine writer David Liscio described the design as, \\"a diminutive sturdy cruiser that is capable of mighty bluewater passages\\".

Career Earlier the fort had been under the command of Skanderbeg. Perlatai was defended by 1,850 men from Dibra. Skanderbeg sent 5000 an 4000 riders to aid Perlati. The Sultan offered to let them go if they surrendered to which Perlati refused. On May 17, Murad II began bombarding the fortress with two large guns and ordered troops under the command of Ibrahim Pasha. Perlatis men however defended the attacks and his men, scattered on the fortress walls, threw big stones at the besiegers who suffered many losses. On June 21, Murad II ordered a second storm on the fortress which Perlati once again managed to halt. Perlati suffered 220 dead and more than 100 wounded. At the beginning of July, Perlatis men surrendered and Marlin Barleti writes that the reason was that Murad II had persuaded a villager to throw a dead dog in the well contaminating the water which Perlatis men refused to drink. The sultan offered them free departure in return. Perlati was defeated by the Sultan. But Murad, who could not find food in this hostile region, had to give up and return to Edirne immediately, even if he had planned to move to the inner regions.

He later served an executive with the Ice Hockey Federation of Russia and the International Ice Hockey Federation. Korolev has been recognized with the Order of Friendship, induction into the Russian Hockey Hall of Fame, and the Paul Loicq Award. Early life Korolev was born 6 June 1934, in Moscow, Soviet Union. He dreamed of being an ice hockey player but lacked the necessary skills. He chose to end his playing career by age 20 and transition to coaching. Career Korolev joined the State Committee for Sports and Physical Education in 1954, and began a career of educating athletes and coaches. From 1962 to 1974, he lectured at the State Committee for Sports and Physical Education and became its senior lecturer. He served as the head of the hockey department at the State Committee for Sports and Physical Education from 1974 to 1983, and was the head teacher of its school of hockey coaches. From 1983 to 1989, he was the head coach of the football and ice hockey committee of the All-Union Council on Physical Culture and Sports, and was the deputy of the council from 1987 to 1988. Korolev was also connected to both the Soviet Union national ice hockey team and the Soviet Union national junior ice hockey team. From 1964 to 1992, he was head of the research group for the national men's team, and contributed to the team winning seventeen Ice Hockey World Championships and seven Winter Olympic Games gold medals. At the end of his tenure, he was head coach of the national team from 1990 and 1992. At the 1987 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships, the Soviet juniors had a bench-clearing brawl versus the Canadian juniors, that later became known as the Punch-up in Piestany. Korolev expressed regret that the incident occurred but did not admit any guilt. He felt that the game should have been finished instead of both teams being disqualified from the tournament. During ice hockey at the 1990 Goodwill Games, Korolev spoke out against Sergei Fedorov leaving the Soviet national team and signing a five- year contract with the Detroit Red Wings. Korolev insisted that his player was stolen by premeditated actions and, rather than defecting on his own \\"under normal circumstances\\". He said that \\"having this happen on the eve of the goodwill games, is like a spoon of tar in a barrel of honey\\". Korolev retired from coaching then served as vice-president of the Ice Hockey Federation of Russia from 1992 to 2001, and as its secretary general from 2001 to 2003. He also represented Russia at international meetings, and was elected to the International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF) Council in 1992. He served for six years until 1998 as the chairman of its coaching committee. Korolev has served as a director of the hockey department at the International Scientific and Methodological Center since May 2003. Honors Korolev was made a recipient of the Order of Friendship by the Russian Federation on 20 December 1996. He was named an honorary life member of the IIHF in 1998.

The volcanic field is on a plateau bordered to the south bordered by the Pink Cliffs and to the west by the cliffs of Cedar Breaks National Monument, and features lava flows and over 25 cinder cones mostly between Panguitch Lake and Navajo Lake although older volcanics occur south of Panguitch. Some cones such as Hancock Peak, Henrie Knolls and Strawberry Knolls are up to high, and Miller Knoll cone is surrounded by three satellite vents. Past glaciation has eroded some vents. Some recent vents formed along lineaments and faults; this includes the chain of over 19 cinder cones that generated the Henrie Knolls flows. Lava flows in the Markagunt Plateau are blocky and have flow fronts which reach heights of ; many were erupted from fissure vents. Some of the lava flows of Markagunt Plateau are among the youngest in Utah; these are sparsely vegetated and blocky, while others are cut by streams and stream terraces. Bowers Cave and Mammoth Cave are lava tubes set in lava flows on the Markagunt Plateau, the long Duck Creek Lava Tube is among the longest and highest lava tubes in the United States. Perennial ice and pools of water are widespread in the tubes, which are typically accessible through collapsed portions of the tubes. Lava flows almost reach Panguitch Lake. Lava flows have blocked surface drainages, forming Navajo Lake which drains underground into two watersheds and was later further dammed by humans; another lava-dammed lake downstream from Navajo Lake is now a meadow and Blue Spring Valley also saw the development of lava dams. As a consequence, water on the Markagunt Plateau flows underground through sinkholes developed in limestone rocks, and the burial of surface drainages by highly permeable lava flows likely aided in their development; some sinkholes have formed in basalt and other karstic features are also found in the volcanic field. Many streams and ephemeral creeks head in springs or disappear into sinkholes.  Geology  Geologically, southwestern Utah is at the margin between the geologic provinces known as the Colorado Plateau and the Basin and Range Province, the former of which features flat lying sediments while the latter is characterized by steep horsts and grabens. After the Oligocene and Miocene, during which volcanism was characterized by calderas and stratovolcanoes, beginning 8 million years ago smaller volumes of mostly mafic magma formed lava domes, shield volcanoes, volcanic cones and volcanic plugs. The Markagunt Plateau is part of the High Plateaus geologic province, in the Colorado Plateau and at its margins with the Basin and Range Province. It is a wide fault-bounded block and the basement underneath the volcanoes is formed by various Cretaceous to Miocene sedimentary or volcanic rocks. Volcanism in the region has been ongoing for the last 5 million years. The volcanism is considered to be intraplate and unrelated to either mantle plumes or subduction. = Composition = Volcanic rocks erupted on the Markagunt Plateau range from alkali basalt over basalt and basaltic andesite to andesite and latite, and define calc-alkaline and tholeiitic suites which appear to become more silicic over time. Phenocrysts include clinopyroxene, olivine and plagioclase, with not all minerals present in all flows. Volcanic rocks at Markagunt Plateau are unusual for the common occurrence of subalkaline volcanics; most other recent volcanic centres in the Basin and Range Province have produced alkali basalts. Mixing between crustal melts and primitive magmas may explain this tendency, while the presence of tholeiite may indicate the occurrence of rifting processes in western Utah.  Climate and vegetation  Annual precipitation is about per year and mostly occurs in the form of snow from the Pacific Ocean, although summer monsoon precipitation also occurs. Most of the plateau is part of Dixie National Forest; trees include aspen, spruce and fir with an understory consisting of juniper, Mertensia arizonica and mountain gooseberry and the vegetation covers most surfaces except for the younger volcanoes and canyon walls. Additionally, in marshes vegetation includes hydrophilic plants such as cattails, while juniper grows on lava flows.

The first stage saw activity mainly at the margins of the Markagunt Plateau between 5.3 and 2.8 million years ago; the cinder cones and lava flows produced during this stage are heavily eroded. The second stage occurred along the Sevier fault and in the southern part of the field between 800,000 and 500,000 years ago; its cones and lava flows are moderately eroded. The third group was emplaced during the middle Pleistocene and Holocene. Some individual vents: * Dickinson Hill cinder cone and lava flows, 5.3 million years old. * Houston Mountain flows, vent probably buried beneath younger volcanics. 5.3 million years old. * Rock Canyon cinder cone and lava flow. Perhaps coeval with Dickinson Hill and may also be the source of the 4.98 - 4.94 million years old Red Canyon flows. * Sidney Peaks basalt, probably of Pliocene age. * Blue Spring Mountain cone and lava flow, 2.78 million years old. * Horse Knoll cone and lava flows, 750,000 years old. * Upper Bear Springs cone and lava flows, 750,000 years old. * Long Flat lava flows, 600,000 years ago. * Hancock Peak lava flows, probably same age as Long Flat. * Asay Knoll, Bowers Knoll, Cooper Knoll and Strawberry Knolls cinder cones and lava flows, all probably around 500,000 years old. * East Fork Deep Creek lava flow and eroded cinder cone, 300,000 years ago. * The most recent stage vents cannot be reliably dated by radiometric dating and include Lake Hollow, Duck Creek, Midway Creek, Horse Pasture, Henrie Knolls, Red Desert, Navajo Lake, Dry Valley and the various Miller Knoll and Panguitch Lake flows and cinder cones. = Latest Pleistocene and Holocene = Lava flow near Duck Creek The appearance and weathering characteristics of many volcanic structures imply that they have a recent age. Argon-argon dating has yielded an imprecise date of 58,000 ¬± 35,000 years ago for the Henrie Knolls lava flows. On the Miller Knoll flows, surface exposure dating has yielded ages of 38,000 - 36,000 years ago for the middle member and of 34,000 ¬± 4,000 and 32,000 ¬± 3,000 for two other flows which are likely of the same age. The middle member is overlaid by the Dry Valley flow which is also younger than the other two flows. The precise date of the last eruption is not known but eight cinder cones in the volcanic field appear to be less than 10,000 years old. The Southern Paiute settled into the region after 1,100 AD and their legends may contain references to lava flows. Aside from volcanism, landsliding, aeolian, alluvial fan and floodplain sedimentation took place in the area, beavers built beaver dams on watercourses and peat accumulated at several sites. During the Pleistocene, the Bull Lake glaciation and the Pinedale glaciation took place on the Markagunt Plateau and eroded and buried some lava flows.  Hazards  Large volcanic eruptions in the 1980s such as Mount St. Helens raised public awareness about the dangers emanating from volcanic activity. While most fatalities during volcanic eruptions occurred at silicic volcanoes, basaltic eruptions like these that occurred in Utah in the past are also potential sources of danger. The Markagunt Plateau is considered to be a low-risk volcano. Renewed activity may impact the reservoir and popular recreation site of Navajo Lake less than south of the Markagunt Plateau volcanic field as well as Utah State Route 14 and U.S. Route 89 which are constructed across lava flows from the volcanic field.

Outside Mainland China, it has also gained considerable popularity in other markets, topping the Google Play and Apple App Store's \\"Most Downloaded\\" lists in eight countries. In India, this app is known as Snack Video. It is often referred to as \\"Kwai\\" in overseas markets. Its main competitor is Douyin, which is known as TikTok outside of China. Kuaishou was founded by Su Hua (ÂÆøÂçé) and Cheng Yixiao (Á®ã‰∏ÄÁ¨ë). Prior to co- founding Kuaishou, Su Hua had worked for both Google and Baidu as a software engineer. The company is headquartered in Haidian District, Beijing.  History  Kuaishou's predecessor, \\"GIF Kuaishou\\", was founded in March 2011. GIF Kuaishou was a mobile app created to make and share GIF pictures. In November 2012, Kuaishou transformed into a short video community, and a platform for users to record and share videos depicting their everyday lives. By 2013, the app had already reached 100 million daily users. By 2019, that figure had surpassed 200 million active daily users. In March 2017, Kuaishou closed a US$350 million investment round led by Tencent. In January 2018, Forbes estimated the company's valuation to be US$18 billion. In 2019, the company announced a partnership with the People's Daily, an official newspaper of the Communist Party of China, to help it experiment with artificial intelligence in news. In March 2020, Kuaishou purchased the online video platform AcFun. In early May, Kuaishou launched a short-video app called Zynn, which paid users to use the app and refer other people. It was criticized for being a pyramid scheme, plagiarizing user interfaces from TikTok, and stealing user content from said platform. The app was removed from the Google Play Store on June 10. In June 2020, the Government of India banned Kwai along with 58 other apps, citing \\"data and privacy issues\\". Recent border tensions between India and China might have also played a role in the ban, as there has been an increasingly political \\"Boycott China\\" movement in India due to the competitive relations between the two countries in recent years.

Early life Watts was born on April 16, 1715 in New York City. He was the son and fourth child born to Mary (n√©e Nicoll) Watts (b. 1689) and Robert Watts (1678‚Äì1750), an immigrant to New York City from Scotland at the close of the 1600s. In 1715, colonial Governor Hunter appointed him to the board of the \\"Lords of Trade\\" of the city of New York. His paternal grandfather was John Watts and his family's seat was Rose Hill, then in the suburbs of Edinburgh. His maternal grandparents were William Nicoll, Speaker of the New York General Assembly (and son of mayor Matthias Nicoll), and Anne (n√©e Van Rensselaer) Nicoll. His grandmother was a widow of Kiliaen van Rensselaer and a daughter of Jeremias van Rensselaer, acting patroon of Rensselaerwyck. Career Watts, one of the most prominent and wealthy landowners in the colonies and was one of the original subscribers to the Tontine Coffee House. He served as president of His Majesty's council of New York from 1758 to 1776, and a member of the New York General Assembly from 1752 to 1759. It has been said that if the Revolution failed, Watts would have been the chosen Lieutenant Governor of New York and Acting Secretary of the Province. In 1754, he was one of the original founders and trustees of the New York Society Library. He was also a founder and original member of the Saint Andrew's Society of the State of New York, serving as its president from 1771 to 1772, and as the first president of the New York City Hospital in 1760. As the American Revolution approached, Watts and his wife, both Loyalists, went to Wales in 1775 where his wife died a few months later. In 1779, his properties, including his \\"Rose Hill\\" estate (which today is occupied by Fordham University), were seized by the New York State Legislature. Personal life Portrait of his daughter, Countess Anne Watts Kennedy, wife of Archibald Kennedy, 11th Earl of Cassilis, by Mather Brown. In July of 1742, Watts was married to Anne DeLancey (1723‚Äì1775), daughter of Anne (n√©e van Cortlandt) DeLancey and √âtienne de Lancy, a minor member of the French nobility. Her maternal grandparents were Geertruy Schuyler and Stephanus van Cortlandt, the Chief Justice of the Province of New York, and among her siblings was New York Governor James DeLancey and fellow loyalist Oliver DeLancey. Together, they were the parents of: * Robert Watts (1743‚Äì1814), who married Mary Alexander, eldest daughter of William Alexander, Lord Stirling. * Anne Watts (1744‚Äì1783), who married Archibald Kennedy, 11th Earl of Cassilis. * Susanna Watts (1749‚Äì1823), who married Phillip Kearney (1725‚Äì1798). * John Watts (1749‚Äì1836) who became a U.S. Representative, and married his cousin Jane Delancey. * Mary Nicoll Watts (1751‚Äì1815), who married Sir John Johnson, 2nd Baronet. * Stephen Watts, who was married to Sarah Nugent (1754‚Äì1841). * Margaret Watts (b. 1753), who was married to Robert William Leake. Watts died in Wales on August 15, 1789 and was buried in St James's Church, Piccadilly, London. After the War ended, his sons Robert and John petitioned for the attainder of their properties to be overturned, and were unsuccessful, but were allowed to buy back his properties in 1784, which included vast holdings in ships, mills, factories, banks, and investment houses. =Descendants= Through their children, the Watts became ancestors of the Marquess of Ailsa in Scotland, the Duke of Grafton and the Viscount Daventry in England. Through his daughter Susanna, he was the grandfather of Major General Stephen Watts Kearny (1794‚Äì1848) and great-grandfather of Gen. Philip Kearny (1815‚Äì1862), a United States Army officer notable for his leadership in the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War and American Civil War who was killed in action in the 1862 Battle of Chantilly.

Akiwowo was selected as the Amnesty International Human Rights Defender in 2018 and the Digital Leader of the Year in 2019. She is one of the Evening Standard's 2019 list of most influential people and appeared in Marie Claire in September 2019 as a Future Shaper.  Early life and education  Akiwowo grew up in the London Borough of Newham. Akiwowo attended Sir George Monoux College, where she completed A-Levels in Law, History, Government and Politics. Whilst at college Akiwowo successfully campaigned for a position in the Newham Youth Council. In this capacity she attended the UK Youth Parliament, where she campaigned to improve sexual health policy. She studied at the London School of Economics, where she earned a Bachelor's degree in social policy. Her dissertation considered whether the right questions were being asked about academy education trusts.  Research and career  After graduating, Akiwowo was an intern at the House of Commons and the European Youth Forum. In 2014, at the age of 23, Akiwowo was the youngest black woman to be elected as a councillor for the Labour Party in East London. She believes that involvement with local politics is important to mitigate the rise of the alt-right. She also believes in equal access to education and training for all young people. She is a senior project coordinator for Teach First. She was also a founding associate of Spark+Mettle, a charity which supports young people in the development of their resilience and soft skills using technology and coaching. Akiwowo delivered a speech at the European Parliament about how countries such as Britain, France and Italy should deal with the impact of colonialism. Her speech was met with boos by the audience in the room, to which she responded, \\"You can boo me all you like, baby,\\". After a video of her speech went viral online, Akiwowo was subject to racist abuse on Twitter. The tweets were reported to Twitter over 75 times, as well as to the Metropolitan Police. Initially the social media platforms failed to respond to her complains, but suspended some of the particularly racist accounts after Akiwowo went public with her story. In an Amnesty International ‚Äì Ipsos MORI poll, one fifth of women said they had suffered harassment on social media. Akiwowo designed the Fix the Glitch, a toolkit which supports organisations in how to end gender- based violence. The workshops have three pillars; awareness, advocacy and action. She believes that women need to reclaim their digital space and \\"assert their presence\\". Akiwowo does not want to restrict peoples rights or freedom of speech; but protect people from online trolls who can hide behind anonymity. She established Glitch, a platform and advice provider that helps young people stay protected online. Her campaign has been supported by Amnesty International. Glitch is supported by a Fairer Tech grant from Dot Everyone. Akiwowo was one of the founders of the #ToxicTwitter campaign, which looks to end the online abuse of women. She has written for Gender IT, a collection of feminist reflections on internet policies. She delivered a TEDx London talk on how to \\"fix the glitch\\" in online communities in 2019. = Recognition and honours = In 2018 Akiwowo was selected as the Amnesty International Human Rights Defender and as an Stylist magazine Woman of the Week. She has was featured in Yomi Adegoke's book Slay In Your Lane, as well as on the podcast Busy Being Black. In June 2019 Akiwowo was awarded Digital Leader of the Year. She has written for HuffPost and The Guardian. In 2019 Akiwowo was chosen as one of Marie Clare's Future Shapers; trailblazers who are working hard to make the world a happier, safer and better place for women.

The original clubs selected to the league were: *First Division: Ton-Pentre Thistles, Maindy Crescents, Pentre Blue and Whites, Mill Vue, Porth United and (Tre)Hafod Juniors *Second Division: - Ton-Pentre Juniors, Cwmparc Crescents, Ynyshir Albion, Tylorstown Crescents, Porth Reserves and Cymmer United. In 1927 they were called The Rhondda Valley (Amateur) Football League. At the time some clubs in the league were made up entirely of unemployed men. This resulted in the North Rhondda League being created because clubs were unable to afford travelling expenses. In 1929 the North Rhondda League was affiliated and in 1933 they were renamed The Upper Rhondda League. The Leagues remained separated until the 1962‚Äì63 season when they reformed back into one league. In 1931 a third League was formed called the Rhondda Fach League, this dissolved after the 1937‚Äì38 season. Throughout the Second World War The Rhondda League was one of the very few Leagues to continue playing football - because of the thousands of coalminers working in the collieries in the Rhondda.

Its owner was best known for stock fraud and also a contemporary, unsuccessful, scheme to surreptitiously use radio transmissions to gain an advantage in getting stock market quotes. History The San Francisco Bay- San Jose region of California was an important center of early radio development, including entertainment broadcasts dating back to at least 1912, when Charles Herrold in San Jose inaugurated a series of weekly concerts.\\"Musical Concert by Wireless Telephone\\", San Diego Union, July 23, 1912, page 19.

Lorden apparently had no previous experience in radio, and it is questionable what station use he intended, as there are no reports that KGB ever made any broadcasts. Lorden was a stock broker and the manager of the Aftergood and Company stock company, with its main office at 574 California Street in San Francisco. He also was operating under a legal cloud, and on March 21, 1922 an arrest warrant was issued charging him with embezzling shares of stock and money from multiple clients in San Jose and San Francisco.\\"Broker Faces Fraud Charge\\", San Francisco Examiner, March 22, 1922, page 5.

Originally a rowing club, the main sport has been hockey since the late 1960s. The other sport offered is tennis. History The rowing club was founded in 1908. The first boat was a gig four, a German row boat type mostly used for training purposes. By 1919, i.e. just after World War I, the club had 182 members. A number of notable events occurred in 1925: the club house was built, women's rowing commences, and members start playing hockey during the winter months. First founded in 1910 and re-founded in 1919, a second rowing club existed in R√ºsselsheim: Rudergesellschaft Undine R√ºsselsheim (RGUR). Both local rowing clubs stagnated during the 1930s; first due to the Great Depression and then due to sport becoming secondary in Nazi Germany. In 1938, the two clubs first formed a combined rowing eight and this led to the amalgamation of the two clubs in 1942, adopting the name of the older club. At the end of World War II, the club house was confiscated by the American Army and the club dissolved, as were all sports clubs in Allied- occupied Germany. The club was re-founded in April 1946. This was followed by a period where club rowers would often win the German rowing championships; to date 28 national titles have been won. The next notable year was 1952: the American forces released the club's boat house, and the city built two hockey fields that gave this sport a boost. In 1968, the club's men's team won the national hockey championship. Since 1968, hockey is the dominant sport at RRK 08. The other sport offered by the club is tennis.

The Limburgs Volkskundig Centrum was set up in 1987 by the Gedeputeerde Staten van Limburg and designated as a provincial museum.Overhof (17 januari 1987). It represented a merger of the Limburgs Volkskundig Museum, the Limburgs Volkskundig Instituut and the Volkskundige Activiteiten Limburg, a charitable foundation.Anoniem (24 september 1988). On 25 June 1984 it moved into a newly- restored Kasteel Limbricht. The nucleus of its collection was formed by buying the collection of the bankrupt Peelmuseum in Ospel. The Limburgs Volkskundig Instituut was also moved into the Kasteel Limbricht, with its collections including a library bequeathed by the folk-scholar Winand Roukens.Rousseau (7 juli 1984). The visitor numbers for the Limburgs Volkskundig Centrum proved disappointing, the space too small and the site too poorly connected to local transport.

Designed by Venlo-born architect Jeanne Dekkers, it was only completed in 2000.

History  = The Barnsley Canal = The Barnsley Canal was built in the 1790s to carry coal from the mines near Barnsley to the Aire and Calder Navigation near Wakefield. In 1808, the canal company's Annual General Meeting approved a plan to build a waggonway, and they applied to Parliament for an Act authorising the construction of a horse-drawn railway from Silkstone Cross to the canal's southern terminus at Barnby Basin. The Act was granted. = Construction = The canal company purchased the trackbed of the earlier Low Moor Waggonway. Construction of the new waggonway proceeded quickly and it opened in 1809. The success of the waggonway as a feeder to the canal prompted the construction of furnaces at Low Mill, and the opening of the Waterloo Colliery. In 1812, the Norcroft Colliery was connected to the waggonway. = Extension = In the 1830s, an extension of the waggonway to Silkstone Common was built. This used an incline powered by a steam engine and a self-acting incline to connected to Huskar Pit. = Closure = In June 1847, the canal company entered into an agreement to sell the waggonway to the Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway. However, this transaction was never completed. Coal traffic along the waggonway peaked in 1851 at 33,621 tons. That year, however, was the first full year of operation of the Silkstone Coal Branch Railway, which quickly took traffic away from the waggonway. By 1856, only 22,726 tons of coal was carried. By 1864, ownership of the waggonway had transferred to the Aire and Calder Navigation and in 1866 the waggonway carried just 3,246 tons of coal and in 1870, no coal was carried at all. In August 1872, it was reported that \\"the rails have been pulled up and sold\\".  Route  Barnby Basin in 1850, showing the Silkstone Waggonway on the left The waggonway ran from Silkstone Cross to Barnby Basin. The lower section, between the Basin and Barnby Furnace, followed the route of the Low Moor Wagonway. From there it passed by Norcroft Bridge, at the north end of Silkstone. Sketch of the U-shaped track used in the Silkstone Waggonway, 1809 It was built with stone block sleepers, probably supplied from local quarries owned by Walter Spencer Stanhope. Cast iron, L-shaped rails were laid on the sleepers. Rough stones were packed around the sleepers to hold them in place, with a layer of ash covering them to make a suitable surface for the horses to walk on. Where the waggonway crossed public roads, unusual U-shaped rails were used.

As a church department, Philanthropies continues to operate under the direction of the Presiding Bishopric.  Transparency and accreditation  The LDS Church, and its affiliated entities, do not publish a complete financial report on the amount of funds received or their use. Addressing this topic in 2018, the church's presiding bishop, G√©rald Causs√©, published a Q&A;, stating that \\"The Church is not a financial institution or a commercial corporation [and] chooses not to publish the details of its finances...\\". However, certain entities do publish limited details. For instance, BYU-Idaho stated it received 6.3 million dollars in donations in 2018, of which, 69% went to need- based aid for individual students, administered through a university grant. Due to these transparency practices, Latter-day Saint Charities does not meet requirements for evaluation by established charity-rating organizations, such as the BBB Wise Giving Alliance or Charity Navigator. However, due to the church's policy of using 100% of funds while leveraging volunteers for administration and overhead, Philanthropies would be among the most efficient charitable organizations. Educational efforts Some funds donated through Philanthropies are used by the LDS Church and its affiliated educational entities including: BYU, BYU-Hawaii, BYU-Idaho, BYU-Pathway Worldwide, and LDS Business College.

Gameplay  The player controls a variety of different species of dinosaurs from a third person perspective, exploring a large prehistoric forest and completing quests to earn experience points. Players can initially choose from ten available dinosaurs to play as, such as the Daspletosaurus, Styracosaurus, and Stegosaurus. Each of these dinosaur species uses a different playstyle in order to complete objectives and survive in their respective environments. The goal of the game is to allow dinosaur enthusiasts to roleplay as their favorite prehistoric beasts. Core mechanics include character customization, questing and events, attributes and abilities, swimming, diving, and fishing, modding, and cross-platform play between PC and mobile devices. Path of Titans will feature a Home Cave system that functions similarly to player housing as seen in other MMORPG games. Home Caves can be expanded over time through gameplay.  Development  Path of Titans was first announced in January 2019. Players with access to the demo feature can currently create sample dinosaurs using available skins and models, as well as observe AI dinosaur interactions, and test out their day/night and weather cycles. Players are encouraged to document and log observed bugs to help aid in development. Those who frequently find and report previously unrecorded bugs can earn in game rewards such as custom skins. As of yet, the release date is still unknown. The demo currently features 10 carnivorous dinosaurs and 8 herbivores. The current available Carnivores are Alioramus, Allosaurus, Ceratosaurus, Concavenator, Daspletosaurus, Deinonychus, Latenivenatrix, Metriacanthosaurus, Spinosaurus, and Suchomimus.

It was first broadcast in 1976 in the TV show Loriot, starring Heinz Meier and Claus Dieter Clausnitzer.  Plot  The central character of the sketch is 66 years old retiree Erwin Lindemann (Heinz Meier) who has won 500,000 Deutsche Mark in the lottery. Sitting in a chair in his living room, he is interviewed by a TV team for the evening news. Lindemann, visibly nervous, is only asked to give this short statement: Because of various technical issues and adjustments made by the increasingly frustrated director, Lindemann is repeatedly interrupted and has to repeat his text several times, which makes him more confused after each shot. Finally, the cinematographer warns that film is running out, and the director is satisfied with Lindemann's last attempt, which is performed reasonably fluently, but has become completely jumbled:  Broadcast and reception  Der Lottogewinner was the last of 15 sketches in the first episode of the six-part TV series Loriot, first broadcast on 8 March 1976 on ARD. It is considered one of the most famous sketches by Loriot and Heinz Meier's best-known role. Loriot originally intended the character of Erwin Lindemann to speak with a slight West Low German accent. Meier, who was from near K√∂nigsberg and perfectly spoke East Prussian (High Prussian) dialect, convinced Loriot of letting speak Lindemann in a slightly East Prussian idiom.Lukschy, p. 54 f. According to J√∂rg Thomann in the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, with the character of the confused Erwin Lindemann, Loriot created \\"a moving portrayal of the modern individual who is pushed by their fellow human beings (in this case: a director) towards self-denial and, through all their ambitions (such as the gentlemen's boutique in Wuppertal), losing their bearing ‚Äì until they forget their own name\\". Loriot, who usually starred himself in his sketches, was referring to the popularity of the character when he said to Heinz Meier: \\"I have made two big mistakes: I didn't build a basement for my house, and I let you play Lindemann\\".

History The castle was probably built in the 13th century, one of a number of castles protecting the boundaries of the ancient Hundred of Rhos. Its origins are obscure, but in the 14th century it was held by Thomas de Roche, Lord of Llangwm. A 1583 map of Pembrokeshire shows the castle on the west bank of the Eastern Cleddau (Clethy), and George Owen mentions it in 1603. The waterway was busy until recent times. The castle is said to have been held and damaged in the Civil War with some, including Benton, more or less destroyed. Richard Fenton, in his 1811 Historical Tour, says: Lewis's Topographical Dictionary of 1844 says: In 1888, Edward Laws describes the castle as one of a chain protecting south Pembrokeshire, especially Milford Haven, from invasion in the 12th and 13th centuries: =Renovation= The ruins were stabilised in the early 20th century, and it remained uninhabited until 1930, after which date it was renovated. The courtyard was roofed by 1954, and the building was sold in the 1960s and further restored. The castle is whitewashed and has been Grade II* listed \\"for its historic interest and rarity as a restored small medieval castle\\".

Leyden at Haverhill City Hall. Early attempts at giving the lecture In March 1916, Haverhill Mayor Albert L. Bartlett refused to grant Dr. Thomas E. Leyden a permit to use City Hall for a lecture regarding the appropriation of state money for parochial schools, called \\"Why the Roman Hierarchy Is Opposed to the Public Schools\\", which was seen as anti-Catholic. The lecture instead was instead given at the First Parish Unitarian Church's Unity Hall. Following the meeting, Leyden was attacked and he canceled the rest of his engagements in the city. The Haverhill Ministers' Association, which was made up of ministers from all of the city's Protestant churches, held a protest meeting and adopted a resolution objecting to Bartlett's decision to deny Leyden use of City Hall \\"irrespective of our several opinions of the issues to be discussed by Dr. Leyden\\". The board of aldermen overruled Bartlett's decision and granted Leyden permission to use City Hall for his lecture. On April 2 his lecture was disrupted by mock applause and he retreated to the police station until the crowd over 1,000 dispersed. Leyden was scheduled to give the lecture again the following night and elected to do so. Riot On April 3, roughly 10,000 people took to the city streets. Anticipating trouble, the entire 40-man police force had been called out for duty. About 150 people were granted admission to the hall to hear the lecture, but due to the presence of the mob outside, police commissioner Charles M. Hoyt appeared on stage to announce that the meeting had been canceled. However, Leyden and Rev. Robert Atikinson appeared and Atikinson requested that Leyden be allowed to speak. Leyden attempted to speak but was jeered so loudly he gave up. Atkinson attempted to quiet the crowd again, but was grabbed and rushed down the stairs by angry attendees. A glass door on the fire escape was broken and about 100 people surged into the hall. Hoyt promised those who had paid admission that they would be refunded, however Leyden and his secretary, Clarence Howland were nowhere to be found and it was believed that they had already left with the door receipts, which resulted in increased anger from those in the hall (Leyden was actually under guard in the aldermen's room at city hall). Bricks and stones were hurled at City Hall and the police station and a crowd of thousands attempted to force their way pass police into the hall. A revolver was fired at the police station and a group broke into the basement of the police station to demand the arrest of Leyden and Howland. The mob also ransacked the National Club and looted a coal pocket so that the coal could be used as projectiles. A police officer who attempted to prevent entry into city hall was trampled and an officer who attempted to arrest a youth who had been throwing stones was assaulted by the crowd. Another man was beaten in the National Club. A portion of the crowd went to Leonard House, where Leyden was said to have been staying, but they were turned away by City Marshal John J. Mack, who told them Leyden was not there. Another group stoned the home of commissioner Hoyt. Another went to stone the home of Dr. Herbert E. Wales, a member of the committee that had organized the meeting. However, as no one in the group knew which home was Wales', a number homes were stoned before they found the Wales residence. At 10 pm, Bartlett, arrived at the police station and asked the crowd outside to quietly disperse. The crowd fell back for a time, but the unrest continued. He eventually decided to sound the militia alarm, which alerted members of local command (Co. F of the 8th Regiment), who had been expecting trouble. They assembled the Haverhill armory and marched towards City Hall. They were ordered to charge the crowd with fix bayonets, which scattered the crowd. Two militiamen were injured by a projectiles. At 1 am, 15 officers from the Lawrence, Massachusetts police department arrived to assist the Haverhill police. The crowd was eventually dispersed and no arrests were made. Leyden was eventually able to exit City Hall through a rear door and was taken by car to Newburyport, Massachusetts. The following day he returned to his home in Somerville, Massachusetts. Upon Leyden's departure from Haverhill, City Marshal Mack told him not to return and if he did he would be arrested for inciting to riot. Criminal charges After the riot, Alderman Charles M. Hoyt and the Haverhill Ministers' Association requested a grand jury investigation into the riot. State detectives Arthur G. Wells and Fred F. Flynn spent several weeks investigating the case. On July 12, 1916, Essex County District Attorney Louis S. Cox issued 53 summons to Haverhill residents to appear before the grand jury investigating the case. On July 18, Mayor Bartlett and all four members of the board of aldermen (Roswell L. Wood, Albert E. Stickney, Charles M. Hoyt, and Christopher C. Cook) were all indicted on a charge of neglect to suppress an unlawful assembly. They were the first to ever be charged with this crime. On September 13, four more men were indicted in connection with the case. They were: *James Bradley - disturbing the peace, disturbance of a lawful assembly, and taking part in an unlawful assembly *William Herlihy - disturbance of a public meeting and taking part in an unlawful assembly *William F. Hamilton - taking part in an unlawful assembly *James Henry Sweeney - taking part in an unlawful assembly. The trial against the Bartlett and the aldermen began on October 23, 1916. The other four defendants were tried separate from the city officials. On October 28, the jury returned not guilty verdicts on the all of the charges against Charles M. Hoyt and on one of the two charges against Mayor Bartlett. They were unable to come to an agreement on the charges against Cook, Wood, and Stickney.

Life He was born in Belfast on 23 June 1916, the son of John Bright Wilson, an Ulster Protestant and was educated at the Methodist College in Belfast. He then studied History at Queen's College, Belfast before winning a place at Oxford University where he specialised in Economics graduating MA. Then obtained a doctorate (PhD) at the University of London under Evan Durbin and Nicholas Kaldor. Although a socialist and communist-sympathiser, his observations on the Russian delegates at the World Youth Congress of 1938 in New York led him to conclude the system as a tyranny. In the Second World War he worked first for the Ministry of Economic Warfare and Aircraft Production in Whitehall, then became an advisor to Winston Churchill's statistics branch under Lord Cherwell. Desiring more active duties in 1944 he was given leave to join the Merchant Navy and escorted the Mulberry Harbour to Arromanches. From 1946 to 1958 he was a Fellow of Economics at University College, Oxford, in succession to Harold Wilson. From 1958 to 1982 he held the Adam Smith Chair in Economy at Glasgow University. From 1963 to 1964 and from 1970 to 1983 he was economic advisor to the Secretary of State for Scotland (ironically to both Tory and Labour). In 1964/65 he was economic advisor to the Northern Ireland government creating the \\"Wilson Plan\\". In 1980 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. His proposers were Fraser Noble, Thomas Brumby Johnston, Anthony Elliot Ritchie, Neil Campbell and Douglas Grant. In 1984 he was invited to be an official assessor on the poll tax proposals by Margaret Thatcher. Much to the government's dismay, he was strongly opposed to the concept, but rather than follow his educated opinion he was instead replaced by more sympathetic \\"experts\\". He died at his cottage in Kilmahog near Callander on 27 July 2001. He is buried in the old churchyard at Balquhidder. Family In 1943 he married Dorothy Joan Parry (d.1998). She developed multiple sclerosis. They had a son and two daughters.

Ferdinand Ullrich, Verlag Kettler, B√∂hnen 2012, , page 76 He is known as a master of the color field style of abstract painting, closely related to abstract expressionism, in which he creates tension between a defined surface structure, his own method of applying paint to a canvas, and the relationship of various shades of white or color to each other in their placement as part of a composition on the flat plane of a canvas. In 1986 and 2008, he was awarded the Konrad-von-Soest Prize for Visual Arts by the Landschaftsverband Westfalen-Lippe (Landscape Society Westphalia-Lippe).  Life and Work  Ulrich Erben spent his youth on the Lower Rhine and in Rome, where his family moved in 1956. From 1958 to 1965, he studied painting, graphic techniques, fresco painting and drawing at art academies in Hamburg, Urbino, Venice, Munich and Berlin. Starting his career with landscapes and still lifes, his paintings increasingly used geometric forms. During this period he divided his time between Italy and his homeland on the Lower Rhine, interrupted by a longer stay in Paris in 1963. In 1966, Erben married the writer Ingrid Bach√©r and returned to the lower Rhine. In 1967, he took his first sojourn in the United States, where, in an intensive personal confrontation with landscape and architecture and their mythological meaning, he reduced the use of forms and colors in his works.

They are defined by a white zone in the center of the painting, which is distinct from the matte background, which is a dimmer white background. In this process Erben developed his primary theme of the reciprocal as understood in relationship to objectless and simple form-areas. He was interested particularly in the boundaries of connections; in the formation of space without perspective; and in the underlayment of white and, later, colored surfaces with paint layers of barely perceptible varying tonality. In 1972, Erben began his \\"wei√üe Bilder\\" period of white-on-white paintings, in which he engages with manipulated light effects to create light objects (Lichtobjekts) and murals. He showed his first light object installation, Lichtraum (Halogenobjekt) (Light space: Halogen object) in the \\"Szene Rhein Ruhr '72\\" exhibition at the Grugapark in Essen, organized by Dieter Honisch of the Museum Folkwang. There he hung an unpainted canvas behind a wall of stretched gauze and illuminated it with a halogen light from the front and the back sides, thus producing the illusion of an actual painting. In 1975, Erben moved to D√ºsseldorf, where he is a neighbor of the artist G√ºnther Uecker, without relinquishing his house in Goch on the lower Rhine. In the further development of his \\"wei√üe Bilder\\", the first colored, almost monochrome, works emerged in 1977, and were exhibited at documenta 6 in Kassel. =1978-2014= In 1978, Erben's paintings changed dramatically. He now joined pure colors and irregular forms on his canvases in a single painting process; he used it to create the \\"prima-vista\\" series, as well as paintings on bounded and unbounded space, \\"Interieurs\\" and \\"Exterieurs\\". Yet here as well the \\"relationship of tension between painterly autonomy and formal order\\"Volker Rattemeyer: Ulrich Erben ‚Äì Tr√§ger des Otto Ritschel Preises 2003, ed. Hanne Dannenberger and Volker Rattemeyer, Wiesbaden 2003, is a determining principle. From 1979 on, Erben has also created large spatial works, which consist of individual, serially arranged sheets of paper. The transformation of real space through painting repeatedly became the subject of his work. In 1980 Erben was appointed Professor at the Kunstakademie D√ºsseldorf, M√ºnster Division (later Kunstakademie M√ºnster). He has been a professor emeritus there since 2005. In 1988 Erben returned to stricter geometrical image partitions in his works, which display a clear connection to the early \\"wei√üe Bilder\\". In this changed painting technique using acrylic and pigments, a series of paintings arose that Erben calls \\"Farben der Erinnerung\\" (\\"Colors of Memory\\"): paintings whose colors mutually intensify one another into a luminous appearance that balances harmony and disharmony. A comparable, but even more enhanced, space and light effect is developed in the work group \\"Siria\\" from 2009‚Äì2010, which harkens back to a journey he made in 2007 through the desert landscapes of Syria. In 1992, Erben became a member of the Visual Arts Section of the Akademie der K√ºnste in Berlin. On the occasion of his solo exhibition at the Shiga Museum of Modern Art in Osaka, he took a study trip to Japan. Since 1993, Erben has been creating site-specific wall arrangements in public buildings in Hannover, Essen, Stuttgart and Berlin, among others. He also has wall paintings or installations for temporarily conceived spaces in museums or in the context of exhibition projects. Since 1988, he has also been using oil paint, initially for more representational small-format paintings, with echoes of Italian landscape motifs, under the theme \\"was ich sehe\\" (\\"what I see\\"). He began using oil paint for large-format, multi-panel paintings, and is increasingly taking up earlier themes and interpreting them anew. Subsequent to the \\"Siria\\" work group, Erben's paintings from 2010 on show a greater variety of geometric forms and their arrangements. As of 2014, through muted color transitions, Erben brings immaterial movement and simultaneously luminous quietude into his paintings, which are designated by the collective title \\"Festlegung des Unbegrenzten\\" [\\"Fixing of the Unbounded\\"].

On March 7, 1090 he became Bishop of Speyer. The family was closely connected with the Salians . Johann I was a faithful follower of Emperor Henry IV and remained in the investiture dispute at his side. In expiation of a consequent ban from the Pope, he founded Blaubeuren Abbey , together with his niece Adelaide. He also converted the collegiate church of Sinsheim to a monastery, for which he made rich endowments from his private possession. During the persecution of the Jews in connection with the First crusade in 1096 he took the Jews into his personal protection (see History of the Jews in Speyer#Massacres of 1096). Bishop Johann died on October 26, 1104, at the age of 41 and is registered on the day of his death with an annual memorial mass in the newer :de:Seelbuch of Speyer Cathedral . He was buried in the collegiate church of Sinsheim, in a tomb in front of the high altar, where his mother was laid to rest. Johann's father and brother Wolfram were buried there in front of the altar of the apostle.

Veach maintains an active social media presence, and has said ‚ÄúInstagram built our church. Isn‚Äôt that fascinating?‚Äù Veach has been the subject of significant mainstream press coverage, which often focuses on Veach‚Äôs taste in streetwear and sneakers and his links to celebrities like actor Chris Pratt and singer Justin Bieber, which have been chronicled on Veach‚Äôs Instagram. Early life and family Veach grew up on Whidbey Island, Washington. His father, Dave Veach, is a District Supervisor with Foursquare Church in Tacoma, Washington. As a young man, Veach ‚Äúwasn‚Äôt solid in his faith at all,‚Äù according to his father. In an interview with The Christian Post, Veach said that he had \\"a foot in, a foot out\\" of church as a teenager, but that attending a Promise Keepers event was a turning point for him: \\"it's the typical prodigal son story who has an experience and then says, 'Wait, what I had back home was way better. I'm going back home and to church.' I had sown some wild oats but nothing too crazy.\\" Veach‚Äôs two siblings are also pastors. Veach attended Life Pacific College, a Bible college located in San Dimas, California, graduating in 2002. Career In 2004, Veach took a job counseling teens and young adults for United Generation ministry in Puyallup, Washington. In 2013, he became associated with Judah Smith, spiritual adviser to Justin Bieber and lead pastor of Churchome, a multi-site megachurch based in Seattle and Los Angeles. In 2014, Chad Veach and his wife Julia Veach moved to Los Angeles and started their ministry with informal gatherings at their home. Zoe Church began its services in borrowed space in a small church in Santa Monica and, after one day at the 1 Oak nightclub in Hollywood, Zoe Church moved to the El Rey Theatre on Wilshire Boulevard. Veach told the New York Times that he modeled Zoe Church after Hillsong Church and Church of the Highlands. In 2017, Veach and Judah Smith accompanied Justin Bieber on his Purpose World Tour, reportedly to serve as ‚Äúpositive influences.‚Äù Videos of Veach hanging out with Justin Bieber have appeared on Veach‚Äôs Instagram account. Ruth Graham, writing in Slate, noted how Veach‚Äôs ‚Äúon-trend streetwear and friendship with Justin Bieber‚Äù made him the latest example of the ‚Äúcool- pastor phenomenon.‚Äù Describing Veach as an ‚ÄúInstagram-savvy pastor ... who dresses not like Ward Cleaver, but like a Supreme model,‚Äù Graham observed that ‚ÄúVeach and his cohort seem to have converted as many style writers as they have souls.‚Äù Pastoral style In a profile of Veach published in The New York Times, Veach was quoted as saying \\"I want to be loud and dumb. That's my goal. If we aren't making people laugh, what are we doing? What's the point?\\" Veach is described as frequently using street talk and changing his dialect depending on his audience, and occasionally mimicking Houston megachurch pastor Joel Osteen. Veach described his pastoral philosophy in an interview with The Christian Post, saying that he was motivated by a desire to reverse the trend of young adults becoming less affiliated with church: > We need to do whatever we can to become relevant and deconstruct some of > those false notions about what religion is. What resonates with young adults > is actually the message of Jesus and maybe that was convoluted or placed in > the back burner in the past but I think that's why you're seeing young > adults in the droves respond because if people can see a clear picture of > Jesus, that undeniable ... we obviously have something better than the world > can offer.\\" Books Veach has published four books. In 2012, Veach's first book, Do You See What I See? was published. In 2016, Veach‚Äôs second book, Unreasonable Hope: Finding Faith in the God Who Brings Purpose to Your Pain, was published, about his daughter Georgia‚Äôs struggle with lissencephaly. In 2017, Veach‚Äôs third book, Faith Forward Future: Moving Past Your Disappointments, Delays, and Destructive Thinking was published. In 2020, Veach‚Äôs fourth book, Help! I Work with People: Getting Good at Influence, Leadership, and People Skills was published. Personal life Veach is married to the former Julia McGregor. The couple has four children. Veach has a tattoo on his left arm that reads ‚ÄúBetter at 70,‚Äù in the handwriting of Justin Bieber. Controversies Veach‚Äôs church has been criticized by the actress Ellen Page for being unwelcoming to LGBTQ people. Actor Chris Pratt, defended Veach and his church, saying that all were welcomed and helped in church without distinction. Kelly McLaughlin, Chris Pratt says he 'believes that everyone is entitled to love who they want' after Ellen Page called his church 'infamously anti-LGBTQ', insider.com, USA, February 11, 2019 Veach has never spoken on LGBTQ people.

Hartley worked on several dialects of Lisp, implementing multiple parts of Interlisp, maintaining Macintosh Common Lisp, and developing concepts in computer science and programming language design still in use today. Hartley was a hobby gamer, playing and advising on early computer games in the 1970s and 1990s. Hartley was also an antiques collector, importer and dealer, and was the proprietor of Elephant and Castle, an antiques store in Boston. Hartley spent her career as a researcher at Litton Industries, MIT, BBN, an early employee and Vice President of Technology at Paladian Systems, and an engineer at Apple Computer before retiring in Boston, Massachusetts.  Early life  Alice Hartley was born in Bridgeport, Connecticut on December 13, 1937, to Lowell James Hartley of Minneapolis, Minnesota and Rachel Matilda Virta of Aura, Finland. Hartley graduated from Whittier Junior High School in Bridgeport and was valedictorian of the class of 1955. She was a member of the Newtonians science club and a cheerleader. She was a finalist in the Fourteenth Annual Westinghouse Science Talent Search. Hartley was accepted into MIT in 1955 on a General Motors Scholarship. She graduated with MSc in Physics on June 12, 1959.  Career  In 1961, Alice Hartley co-wrote a ‚ÄúStudy program of pattern recognition research‚Äù With George S. Sebestyen at Litton Systems Inc. This is the earliest record of her research-related employment outside of MIT. Following Litton Industries, Alice Hartley worked as a Senior Scientist at BBN Technologies (Bolt Beranek and Newman Inc.) from as early as 1969 when she ‚Äútook over Dan Murphy‚Äôs role in BBN Lisp‚Äù and added a number of new data types to the system including; ‚Äúarrays, strings, large numbers, floating point numbers‚Äù. During her time at BBN, Hartley co-developed the concept of the spaghetti stack with Daniel G. Bobrow, a form of stack tracing functionality in Interlisp which brought early debugging tools to the programming community. Hartley also worked with Douglas W. Clark on the implementation of the list-linearizing garbage collector. Hartley is listed as the maintainer of Interlisps Basic System in the 1974 ‚ÄúInterlisp Reference Manual‚Äù alongside Warren Teitelman (User Facilities) and JW Goodman (Special Arithmetic Functions). It reads: > A. K. Hartley Basic system: i.e., interpreter, input/output, garbage > collector; plus all subrs, i.e. hand-coded machine language functions such > as PRINT, CONS, PROG, GO, etc.; plus compiler. Hartley is thanked by Paul Graham in the introduction to ANSI Common Lisp and is mentioned as a collaborator by Guy Steele in The Evolution of Lisp. Hartley resigned from BBN on November 7th, 1984 to join a new AI engineering firm, Palladian Software, Inc, as Vice President of Technology, where she worked until 1987. While at Palladian, Hartley lead the development of various ‚ÄúArtificial Intelligence‚Äù systems for financial modeling and trading in the financial markets. After Palladian Software Inc, Hartley worked for Apple Computers on Allegro Common Lisp and tools for using Lisp on the Macintosh. Hartley single-handedly maintained Macintosh Common Lisp until 2007 when she open-sourced the source code under LLGPL.

Early life  Akashi was born in Numazu, Shizuoka prefecture on 5 July 1901. He was the third son of a farmer. At the age of twenty, he graduated from Shizuoka Normal School with a license to teach elementary school. He worked as a teacher until 1926. In 1924, he married Asako Furug≈çri, also an elementary school teacher. They had two daughters, born in February 1925 and late 1926.  Leprosy and poetry  Akashi began to show symptoms of leprosy in early 1926, and was diagnosed that same spring. He retired from teaching after his diagnosis and was soon subjected to the mandatory quarantine regime in practice in Japan at that time. In the following year, he was hospitalized in Akashi Rakusei hospital (),, ÊòéÁü≥Êµ∑‰∫∫Ôºà1901-1939Ôºâ, Ikeda's website (University of Osaka). which stood in what is now Nishi-ku, Kobe.Âπ≥Áî∞ÂãùÊîø, 1920Âπ¥‰ª£„ÅÆ„Éè„É≥„Çª„É≥ÁóÖÂïèÈ°å„Å®Á§æ‰ºö‰∫ãÊ•≠ÔºàÁ¨¨ÔºïÂ†±Ôºâ Ê≤ªÁôÇËß£Êîæ‰∏ªÁæ©„ÅÆÁ≥ªË≠úÔºàÊ•ΩÁîüÁóÖÈô¢Ôºâ„ÅÆÊ§úË®é, Japanese Society for the Study of Social Welfare, 2010. When this facility closed in 1932, he was moved to the leper colony Nagashima Aiseien Sanatorium. While at Nagashima Aiseien, Akashi learned to write traditional Japanese poetry, primarily tanka. His poems were published in the sanatorium's magazine, Aisei; and he became one of the best-known of a group of leprosy patients who wrote poetry and prose about their condition, a genre referred to as \\"leprosy literature\\" until the 1940s. Akashi's health deteriorated as a result of his condition, and in autumn of 1936, he went blind. On 11 November 1938, he underwent a tracheotomy as a result of difficulty in breathing. On 9 June 1939, he died at the sanatorium of intestinal tuberculosis. He published his most successful work, Hakuby≈ç, in 1939, shortly before his death. It sold over 250,000 copiesThe figure of 250,000 copies is generally cited, but the collection (Kaijin zensh≈´) says 25,000. This much lower figure does not seem to be a typographical error. and drew significant attention to the plight of leprosy patients in Japan.

The species was described from fossils discovered in 2008 at Saint Bathans, Otago, New Zealand. It is believed that the species stood up to tall and weighed approximately . Initial analysis suggests it is from the superfamily Strigopoidea, which consists of three confirmed genera of parrots: Nestor (kea and kaka), Strigops (kakapo) and the fossil Nelepsittacus. The species was likely flightless, its robust beak could crack open more than the conventional parrot foods of fruit, nuts, and berries. And like the kakapo, Heracles may have used it strong beak to climb trees. It shared its environment with five other species of parrot in the genus Nelepsittacus, as well as dozens of other bird species in the St Bathans Fauna. Heracles inexpectatus is the largest parrot known to have existed. Media releases described the new species as the \\"Hercules parrot\\" and reported the nickname given by the palaeontologist Mike Archer of \\"squawkzilla\\".  Taxonomy  The description of a new species and genus was published in 2019, emerging from research undertaken by Trevor Worthy, Suzanne Hand, Mike Archer, R. Paul Scofield and Vanesa L. De Pietri. Heracles inexpectatus was described from two incomplete tibiotarsi (leg bones), a left one and a right one, probably from the same individual. The left bone was nominated as the holotype. The fossils were originally presumed to be from an eagle, but were re-inspected after a PhD student at Flinders University noted that the bone morphology was significantly different from typical eagles. The etymology of the generic epithet Heracles alludes to the earlier naming of a genus, Nelepsittacus, also describing St Bathan Fauna, which referred to a mythic king Neleus who was slain by the Greek hero Herakles, who also slew all of his sons, save for Nestor. The authors distinguished the new species with the epithet inexpectatus to describe their astonishment at the unexpected discovery of an enormous parrot-like bird from the Miocene epoch.  Description  The largest known species of Psittaciformes, which comprises the modern parrots and cockatoos, it is estimated to have been around one metre in height, with a body mass of seven kilograms, and presumed to have been flightless, terrestrial and perhaps arboreal. Island gigantism has been observed in other orders of birds, especially in New Zealand and Fiji, but this species exceeds the proportions of any extant or fossil species of the parrot order. The previously known record for size was the arboreal and nocturnal Strigops habroptilus, the kakapo of modern New Zealand. The fossilised tarsi were deposited in a rich and mixed assemblage of animal remains, including other large species of Aves such as the moa, anatids and an eagle, the bones of which are usually fragmented. The type material of Heracles inexpectatus is the longest evidence obtained at the site, which rarely produces fossil longer than 100 millimetres. The time of deposition is determined as sixteen to nineteen million years ago, in an area associated with a freshwater lacustrine system, in wet forest dominated by cycad, palm and casuarina species, along with a diverse array of other avian fauna. The species appears to have occupied a niche in the region's ecology, unfilled by mammals, that favoured the insular gigantism exhibited by some other avian species of the region.

The siege was conducted alongside an unsuccessful siege of Byzantium. Both sieges took place in the period just before the Fourth Sacred War.Rickard, J (7 February 2017), \\"Siege of Perinthus, 340‚Äì339 BC\\" Macedonia under Philip II  In 357 BC, Philip II of Macedon marched against the Illyrians, and crushed them, killing about 7,000 Illyrians. Later that year, Macedonia and Athens came to an agreement, that Macedonia would give Athens Amphipolis and, in return, Athens would give Macedonia Pydna. Philip broke his promise by keeping both cities. This led to Athens declaring war on Macedonia. Many other campaigns were conducted against Athens. In 356 BC, Philip conquered the town of Crenides and changed its name to Philippi. In 349 BC, Philip started the siege of Olynthus. Olynthus was formerly allied with Macedonia but then had later switched their allegiance to Athens. In 345 BC, Philip conducted another campaign against the Ardiaei, under their King Pleuratus I, during which Philip was seriously wounded in the lower right leg by an Ardian soldier.Ashley, James R., The Macedonian Empire: The Era of Warfare Under Philip II and Alexander the Great, 359‚Äì323 BCE, McFarland, 2004, p. 114, In 342 BC, Philip led a great military expedition north against the Scythians, conquering the Thracian fortified settlement of Eumolpia which he renamed after himself, Philippopolis (modern-day Plovdiv). Siege of Perinthus  In the early spring of 340 BC, Philip started his campaign to besiege Perinthus. The city stood on a peninsula, connected to the land by a 200 yard wide heavily fortified isthmus. The coast was protected by cliffs, making any naval attack nearly impossible. The defenders of the cities were supported by Byzantium, as well as the Achaemenid Empire. The Athenian navy, under the control of Chares of Athens, kept the Macedonians out of the seas and helped maintain naval superiority. Reinforcements and supplies reached the city from its allies, and the Macedonian fleet was unable to stop the reinforcements from reaching the city. After several weeks laying siege to the city, the Macedonians finally broke through the outer wall. But to their dismay, they reached a new wall inside the city that the defenders had built between the houses. This new wall was much more solid and stronger than the previous one. Philip's army was more numerous and had siege engines. However, since Perinthus was receiving constant aid from Byzantium and the Achaemenids, the siege was difficult to maintain. Eventually, Philip had found the challenges of successfully besieging the city too much, and so withdrew.Thirlwall, Connop. The History of Greece. Google Books, University of Michigan. Page 63. Aftermath After the failed siege of Perinthus, Philip focused most of his attention on Byzantium. In the late summer of 340 BC, he led half of his army to Byzantium, but the city refused to surrender to him and prepared to resist. Most of the Byzantian army was still at Perinthus, but the defenders who remained at Byzantium managed to survive the initial attack. The Byzantines received aid in the form of weaponry and men from their allies at Chios, Cos, and Rhodes. After several weeks of laying siege to Byzantium, Philip decided to launch one last surprise assault on the walls, using nothing but moonlight to aid the night attack. However, the barking of dogs was said to have betrayed the attack, and Philip decided once again, to give up and withdraw.Rickard, J (15 February 2017), Battle of Chaeronea, August 338 BC The summer of 338 BC, Philip successfully defeated Athens and Thebes at the Battle of Chaeronea (338 BC). After Philip's death, Philip's son, Alexander, later defeated the Achaemenids on several occasions and conquered the entirety of the Achaemenid Empire, greatly expanding the Macedonian Empire.Briant, Pierre (2012).

Al-Zubayr ibn Bakkar says his name is \\"Nasr Ibn Rabiah Ibn Nasr Ibn Malik Ibn Sha Ωwoth Ibn Malik Ibn Ajam Ibn  ΩAmr Ibn Nimarah Ibn Lakhm\\".  His dream  One night Rabiah had a dream that terrified him, he sent to all the soothsayers, magicians, drawers of omens from the flight of birds and astrologers to interpret his dream. He didn't tell them what was his dream saying that the person who will know the correct interpretation would be able to know the dream without recounting it. They couldn't tell him what was his dream so they advised him to call Shaq and Satih. Rabiah called Satih and Shaq. Satih arrived earlier than Shaq. Shaq and Satih were two famously known priests. They were born on the same day when a priestess Tarifah Bint al-Khair al-Himyariah died. It is said that she spit in their mouths when they were born and that they inherited the kahina from her. She was the wife of Amr Muzaykiya. According to Arab historians' accounts, Satih had no bones in his body and his face was in his chest. His body inflates when he gets angry. According to Ibn Abbas, \\"Satih was created as a mass of flesh without any bones but his skull, neck, and hands; he could be rolled up from the feet to his collarbone like a garment, and could move nothing but his tongue\\".The Birth of the Prophet Muhammad, Marion Holmes Katz, 40 Shaq had half human body, he had one leg, one eye and one hand. Rabiah asked Satih what was his dream, Satih said, \\"you dreamed that there was a skull that came out of the darkness to Tihamah and started to eat heads of people\\". Rabiah said, \\"you weren't mistaken, so what is the interpretation?\\", Satih said, \\"I swear by the serpent which is between the two al-Harahs, that the Habash will take your land from Abyn to Jurash. Rabiah replied, \\"By your father! 0 Satih, this is indeed distressing and painful for us; but when will this take place-in my own time, or subsequently?\\" Satih replied, \\"No, it will be after sixteen to seventeen years later.\\" Rabiah asked, \\"Will they be in Yemen forever? or would their dominion cut shortly?\\" Satih replied, \\"it will cut shortly,\\" Rabiah asked, \\"who will come after them.\\" Satih replied, \\"a king known as Iram Bin Dhi Yazan he will come from Aden and expel all of them from Yemen.\\" Rabiah asked, \\"will Iram's dominion be forever or will it cut shortly?\\" Satih replied, \\"it will cut shortly.\\" Rabiah asked, \\"who will come after Iram?\\" Satih replied, \\"a prophet who will come and his dominion shall last until the end of time.\\" Rabiah asked, \\"is there an end for time?.\\" Satih replied, \\"Yes, the day when the first generation meet with the last generation. The righteous will have joyful on it but the evildoers shall be made wretched.\\" Rabiah asked, \\"is what you are telling us true? Oh, Satih.\\" Satih replied, \\"Yes, by the redness of the dying sun at evening-and the beginning of the darkness of night and the dawn when it is complete-what I have told you is undoubtedly true.\\" Shqiq came later and told Rabiah a similar interpretation. When Rabiah saw that both Shaqiq and Satih gave similar interpretation he sent his family to Iraq and wrote to a Persian king called Shabur Ibn KhurrazƒÅd on their behalf to allow them to settle in al-·∏§irah. al-Numan Ibn al-Mundir was a descendant of Rabiah Ibn Nasr.

Created by former students of the neo-fascist group Jeune Nation (1949‚Äì58), the Federation of Nationalists Students was launched in May 1960 after the publication of a manifesto calling for a nationalist cultural revolution. The text broke with the doctrine of street insurrection previously espoused by far-right groups like Jeune Nation in the 1950s, and is deemed influential on many nationalist movements that followed, especially Europe-Action and the GRECE. The organization reached its peak in influence and membership in the years 1964-1966, and was eventually dissolved by its head members in 1967.  Emergence and creation: 1959-61  The Federation of Nationalist Students (FEN) was established on 1 May 1960 by pro-colonial Algeria students Georges Schmeltz (known as \\"Pierre Marcenet\\"), Pierre Poichet and Fran√ßois d'Orcival, as a successor of the far-right group Jeune Nation, dissolved by official decree during the May 1958 crisis. The magazine Jeune Nation‚Äîcreated in July 1958 as an attempt to revive the defunct group, and joined in September 1959 by D'Orcival, Poichet and Marcenet‚Äîhad been shut down by the police on 28 January 1960. To avoid a new dissolution, the young militants infiltrated the far-left student society UNEF, then seceded from the organization to create the FEN. The founders published a Manifesto of the Class of '60, in reference to Robert Brasillach's Letter to a Soldier of the Class of '60, in which they committed themselves to \\"action of profound consequence\\", as opposed to \\"sterile activism.\\" For the FEN, the \\"ideological war\\" was not to be fought in the streets, but rather in \\"the biology laboratories, the archives of the National Library [and] the editorial rooms of the mainstream press\\". Far-right movements had to generate a cultural revolution, by promoting nationalist ideas until they reach political dominance and popular support, \\"[wearing] on the outside reassuring labels acceptable to the system, in order not to arouse attention before [their] war machine is sufficiently strong\\". This manifesto marked a break with the street insurrection previously promoted by Jeune Nation, and set the ground for the future meta-political strategy of Europe- Action and the GRECE. That stance however did not keep the FEN away from attacking UNEF meetings and confront the police in Algeria during Charles de Gaulle's tour. Alain de Benoist joined the FEN in 1961 and the following year became the secretary of the student society's magazine, Cahiers universitaires, in which he wrote the main articles along with D'Orcival. Fran√ßois Duprat, who had participated in the split from UNEF in 1960, was also a journalist in the magazine.  Political influence: 1962-66  Soon after having served his sentence at La Sant√© Prison in 1961-62, Dominique Venner undertook the takeover of the student society, which had been acting until then as the semi-avowed successor of the banned Jeune Nation. The organization had started to grow after the signature of the √âvian accords in March 1962 and, despite their pro-colonial stance, the FEN began to accept the new world order emerging from decolonization. They theorized a nationalism based on European identity, founded on \\"the defense of European pre-eminence\\" everywhere in the world, with France as a \\"privileged territory\\" where \\"the main racial branches that make up European ethnicity converge\\". They dismissed the political and military leaders as unable to pursue the revolution triggered in the streets: \\"Alger, it is over; forgotten. We will not say Alger as we say Budapest anymore.\\" In October 1963, the Cahiers Universitaires demanded the suppression of the military service in the name of the fight against the Fifth Republic: \\"serving in the army, that is serving in the army of the regime. [...] Not a single soldier for the regime.\\" This anti-military public campaign turned into a failure and led to internal disputes in the FEN. A dissident Parisian branch emerged in November 1963 after the exclusion of Fran√ßois Duprat. Endorsed by Pierre Sidos and escorted by Jeune Europe's supporters, this break-away group created Occident on 23 April 1964. Sidos also opposed the influence of Europe-Action in the FEN, along with their theories of pan-European nationalism‚ÄîSidos preferring a French-centered one‚Äîand their supposed leniency towards communism. The FEN reached its peak in the years 1964‚Äì1966, with an estimated membership of 2,500 in 1965. After they supported far-right candidate Jean-Louis Tixier-Vignancour in the 1965 presidential election through the \\"Tixier-Vignancour Committees\\", FEN lead members were among the founders‚Äîalong with Europe-Action magazine led by Dominique Venner‚Äîof the short-lived European Rally for Liberty (REL), a nationalist micro-party which ran candidates in the 1967 legislative election but failed with 2.58% of the votes. The electoral failure led many like De Benoist to question their political involvement. According to him, he decided in the fall of 1967 ‚Äúto make a permanent and complete break with political action‚Äù and to launch a review. Maurice Rollet also gives November 1967 as the moment several FEN veterans decided to ‚Äúchange course, radically‚Äù.  End and legacy: 1967  The Cahiers universitaires released their last issue in January 1967. If the FEN never succeeded in forming a lasting and in reaching majority approval among students‚ÄîUNEF remaining the main union‚Äîthe period was a \\"significant tactical moment\\" for the nationalists. After the FEN auto- dissolved in 1967, many of its members were involved in the foundation of the GRECE in 1968‚Äîescorted by adherents of the REL‚Äîall led in this project by De Benoist. Ideas promoted by the FEN, especially its meta-political ambition expressed in the founding manifesto, influenced Europe-Action (1963‚Äì66) and the Nouvelle Droite (1968‚Äìpresent). De Benoist has been a lead member in all three organizations. Raymond Bourgine offered positions to a number of FEN adherents in his magazines Valeurs Actuelles and Le Spectacle du Monde, most notably to Alain de Benoist (from 1970 to 1982), and Fran√ßois d'Orcival (1966‚Äìpresent).  Views and symbols  FEN members intended to \\"fight Marxization in the universities\\", to keep \\"French Algeria territorially bound to the Mother Country\\" and to establish a \\"rigorously hierarchical [state] not on election but on selection\\", with the governing elites necessarily of \\"European ethnicity\\". According to the FEN, the events occurring in Algeria were a manifestation of \\"the revolt of colored peoples against the order assured by the imperial sovereignty of white civilization\\". Lead FEN members, especially D'Orcival, were largely influenced by the meta-politic and agitprop methods of Marxism they intended to use against the very same Marxists. As such, the reading of \\"Left-Wing\\" Communism: An Infantile Disorder by Lenin was advised to nationalist militants for them to \\"understand how a revolutionary party must behave for the seizure of power.\\" The emblem of the FEN was a black Spartan helmet with a red flame.

Biography and education Boag was born in Glasgow in Scotland, and emigrated with her family to Australia in 1964. They settled in the remote industrial city of Port Pirie where she attended Port Pirie High School. Her art teacher, the ceramicist, Petrus Spronk, encouraged her to apply for entry to the South Australian School of Art in Adelaide. There she specialised in printmaking under Franz Kempf, graduating in 1976. In 1977 she moved to Melbourne where, at the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology she was able to work alongside an outstanding generation of printmakers including George Baldessin, Tate Adams and John Loane, along with Neil Leveson at the Victorian (now Australian) Print Workshop. In 1985, Boag moved to Sydney, where she exhibited with Australian Galleries and taught at the National Art School, Sydney College of the Arts, Western Sydney University and the College of Fine Arts. During the 1990s she conducted annual printmaking workshops at the remote Aboriginal community of Lockhart River in northern Queensland. She also worked and travelled extensively. She was artist-in-residence at the Aberdeen Art Gallery in Scotland, spent five years in Paris (including a residency at the Moya Dyring Studio in the Cit√© internationale des arts), worked in the Scuola Internazionale di Graphica in Venice, and was awarded the Australia Council's Japan Residency in 1998, having been Asialink's inaugural artist-in- residence in Seoul, South Korea in 1995. Since then she has regularly spent months at a time in South Korea teaching, exhibiting and consulting. She now divides her time between Seoul and Sydney. Work Living in different cultural contexts has led to the artist's preoccupation with displacement. The work becomes a response to Boag's own response to her new surroundings. Images are reduced to semi-abstract forms that combine areas of colour with line. The results are strong graphic forms which take on the character of signs. The pictures are simultaneously simple and complex. They become conversations between the artist and her context, reflecting the range of responses to being in a foreign place.

Several explanations have been proposed for this phenomenon, including mutual inhibition between the two brain hemispheres.

It largely consists of Engineer's Island. History The land which covers Baseco today was once the location of a dockyard of the National Shipyard and Steel Corporation (NASSCO). In 1964, during the administration of then-President Ferdinand Marcos, NASSCO was acquired by the Romualdez family, the kin of the president's wife Imelda Marcos through the Bataan Shipping and Engineering Company or BASECO. In the late 1970s, the urban poor population were resettled by the Marcos administration to give space for a possible international seaport. Baseco was formally declared a barangay (Barangay 649, Zone 68) in the 1980s. Following the People Power Revolution of 1986, the national government under Marcos' successor Corazon Aquino sequestered the property and the urban poor population began to resettle the area. People settled in an area within Baseco which would later be designated as \\"Block 40\\". At least 39 other blocks would be established. By 1999, Baseco attained full access to electricity. On February 12, 2002, then-President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo proclaimed Baseco as a residential site. Geography Engineer's Island Baseco consists of Engineer's Island including two stone breakwaters one which borders the Pasig River and another the South Harbor. Prior to 1980, the two breakwaters were two separate islands, Isla Laki (also known as borac beach/Baseco beach) and Isla Liit (. Baseco's area has been increased by reclamation both by the government,Non-profit organization, and residents. The area also has a beach which is frequented by some Manila residents despite dangerous levels of coliform in its adjacent waters. The area is prone to flooding by typhoons and strong monsoon rains.

Demographics From the 1960s to the 1970s, families of employees in then-existing shipyard in the area settled in Baseco. At that time only around 15-20 to families lived in Baseco.

She was a merchantman and letter of marque. She captured an American privateer in a notable single-ship action in 1813, some months before Lion was wrecked in 1813. Career By one account, Lion was built as a frigate for the British government to present as a present to the Turks.Niles Weekly Register, Volume 4, 7 August 1813, p.374. Plans changed and she was sold to private interests. Lion first appeared in Lloyd's Register (LR) in 1810 with Thompson, master, Elvine & Co., owners, and trade London‚Äìthe .LR (1810), Seq.‚ÑñL226. Captain James Thompson acquired a letter of marque on 22 September 1809. Lion sailed for the Brazils on 10 July 1810. Lion, Thompson, master, was last listed in LR in 1813 with Elvine & Co., owners, and trade London‚ÄìMalta.LR (1813) Seq.‚ÑñL282. Lion was reported to have sailed from Deal on 27 January 1813 bound for a cruize in the China Sea.Lloyd's List (LL) ‚Ññ4741, Ship arrival and departure (SAD) data. On 22 March 1813 Lion captured the American privateer schooner Matilda off Pernambuco in a severe single-ship action. Matilda, of Philadelphia, was armed with 12 guns and had a crew of 50 men. She had been cruizing for 52 days and had taken one prize. Lion suffered two men killed and Captain Thompson and eight men wounded. Matilda lost her captain, first lieutenant, and four men killed, and her second lieutenant and 21 men wounded.LL ‚Ññ4772. By one account, some of Matildas crew were killed after she had struck.Niles Weekly Register, Volume 5, 18 September 1813, p.44. American records show Matilda, H. Rantin, master, with 11 guns and 104 men. She captured one schooner and one brig. The brig Ranger, John Heard, master, that she captured resisted and had her master killed. Ranger, of six guns, had been sailing from Santo Domingo to London with a cargo of coffee and logwood. The capture took place at .LL ‚Ññ4706. The schooner Single-Cap, which Matilda had taken arrived at Philadelphia on 22 October 1812.Lloyd's List ‚Ññ4731. The American records showed Lion with 28 guns and 120 men. At least one account described Lion as a man-of-war.{{sfnpCoggeshall1856p=148} Another report stated that the action took place off San Salvador and that Dolphin had approached Lyon under the mistaken impression that Lyon was the weaker ship. Apparently Captain Rantin of Matilda had succeeded in boarding Lion as her British crew had fled below. However, a heavy sea parted the two vessels and the rest of Matildas crew were unable to follow. Lions crew rallied and over- powered the American boarders. Lion then approached Matilda, which struck. The British landed the surviving American crew at Bahia. William, Davis, master, then sailed for New York as a cartel.Niles Weekly Register, Volume 4, 31 July 1813, p.354. The British put a prize crew on Matilda. The American privateer Argus recaptured Matilda.Lloyd's List (LL) ‚Ññ4791. Then recaptured Matilda on 25 July. Lastly, the American privateer recaptured Matilda. Fate LL reported on 8 October 1813 that in mid-July the privateer Lion, Thompson, master, had wrecked between Pernambuco and Bahia, Brazil. Her crew was saved.LL ‚Ññ4811. Court case The sequence of captures and recaptures gave rise to a court case over head money due to Lion and Revolutionnaire. On 16 December 1813 the court ruled that head money for 80 men was due to Lion and 15 to Revolutionnaire. The recaptures did not extinguish the military character of the vessel. The court found that Matilda had had 81 men on board, of whom five were killed and 24 wounded. Lion had landed 24, and a surgeon, at Pernambuco. She landed 47 at Salvador where the US consul gave a receipt for the 24 men landed at Pernambuco. The four remaining men of her crew were officers and were released on parole.Reports...

Contents Blades is a 104-page softcover book designed by Louis Prosperi, Robin Laws, Sam Witt, Teeuwynn Woodruff, Nicole Lindros Frein, and Diane Piron-Gelman, with interior art by Kent Burles and John Dollar, and cover art by Steve Bryant. The book is a collection of five adventures, each designed to be completed in a single role- playing session of Earthdawn. The adventures revolve around a set of seven magical daggers and the key knowledge that a team of player characters must learn to be able to use them. Reception In the March 1996 edition of Arcane (Issue 4), Andy Butcher found a host of problems with this book, saying, \\"Blades is fundamentally flawed and won't work for most groups. There are some good ideas here, though, and taken individually the component adventures serve as useful examples of the kind of thing you should be running when your players want to learn about a particular magical item. Whether that's worth the asking price, though, is a debatable question.\\" Butcher concluded by giving Blades a very poor rating of 4 out of 10. In the October 1996 edition of Dragon (Issue #234), Rick Swan was enthusiastic about Blades, calling it \\"not only the best-ever anthology for Earthdawn, it‚Äôs among the best-ever fantasy anthologies, period.\\" Despite the many different contributors, Swan thought \\"the characters, encounters, and other basics are handled with effortless aplomb...The tone remains grim, the dangers ever present.\\" He concluded by giving the anthology a top rating of 6 out of 6.

He joined the Melbourne and County of Bourke Police in September 1852, which merged with other county forces a year later to become Victoria Police. Chomley rose through the ranks quickly‚Äîby 1854 he was a sub-inspector at Creswick, and was later one of four in charge of a detachment of 70 mounted police troopers held in reserve at the Eureka Stockade during the Eureka Rebellion. Promoted to paymaster and inspector, he was posted to supervise various minor gold rushes throughout the colony. In 1862, he returned to Bendigo and was promoted to superintendent, running the police station there, and later the Bourke and Geelong districts. During Chomley's posting at Geelong, the outlaw Ned Kelly and his gang were at large. Chomley volunteered to help pursue the Kelly gang, but was instead sent to Brisbane to recruit Australian native police for a permanent detachment of Aboriginal trackers in Victoria. After Kelly's capture and execution, the Victorian Government called a royal commission chaired by Francis Longmore to examine the conduct of the police during the Kelly outbreak. The commission claimed the career of the chief commissioner, Frederick Standish, with Chomley considered as his replacement along with fellow superintendents Charles Nicolson, Frank Hare, John Sadleir and Frederick Winch‚Äîhowever in 1881, the inquiry ended the police careers of the other candidates as well, who were forced to retire as police magistrates. Chomley, who had been in Queensland during the Kelly affair was the only candidate with his career untarnished by the Longmore commission's findings, and in March 1881, new premier Bryan O'Loghlen appointed him as acting chief commissioner‚Äîthe first career police officer to hold the role‚Äîwith a directive to report on his ideas for re-organising the force. Chomley was officially appointed as chief commissioner on 6 March 1882. Death Chomley died at his home, \\"Oyama\\", on Huntingtower Road, Armadale on 12 July 1906.

Early life He started his early life at Giridih, now in Jharkhand, where his father Nagendranath Mukhopadhyaya was a lawyer. In 1907, he was turned out of his school for participating in Banga Bhanga movement (Swadeshi movement). In 1908, he stood fifth in the entrance examination of the National Council of Education.Sengupta, Subodh Chandra and Bose, Anjali (editors), 1976/1998, Sansad Bangali Charitabhidhan (Biographical dictionary) Vol I, , p304, At Santiniketan He joined National Council of Education college at Bowbazar in Kolkata. There he had inspiring teachers like Benay Kumar Sarkar and Radhakumud Mukherjee, but he could not continue his studies because of ill health and death of his father. After coming in contact with Rabindranath Tagore, he arrived at Santiniketan in 1909, where had some informal education and joined as a school teacher in 1910. He was librarian of the City College at Kolkata during 1916‚Äì18. He returned to Santiniketan as a librarian and school teacher in 1918. In 1926, he was appointed as a professor in the college section. Works Rabindra Parichay Sabha, which he had founded, assigned him the task of writing the biography of the poet. It took around a quarter of a century to complete the project. The first volume, published in 1933, was the only one the poet himself could see. The four-volume Rabindra Jivani laid the foundation for further research on Rabindranath. His other books on the poet were: Rabindra Grantha Panji (1932), Rabindra Jiban Katha, Rabi Katha, Rabindranather Chenasuna Manush, Santiniketan Visva Bharati, Rabindranather Gaan ‚Äì Kalanukromik Suchi etc. Mukhopadhyaya was a profound scholar and writer. He wrote Prachin Itihaser Galpo (1912), Bharat Parichay (1921), Bharatey Jatio Andolan (1925) and Banga Parichay in two volumes (1936 & 1941). He wrote Gyanbharati, a short encyclopedia for children. When the noted orientalist Sylvain L√©vi came to Santiniketan, he learnt Chinese and Tibetan from him and engaged in research in that area. Honours In 1965, he was honoured with Deshikottama. Other universities conferred the honorary D Lit degree on him. He was honoured with a Padma Bhusan in 1981. Personal life He married Sudhamoyee, daughter of the Brahmo theologian Sitanath Tattwabhushan. One of the earlier period students of Santiniketan, she was founder of the Bolpur Balika Vidyalaya and was its headmistress for many years. Mukhopadhyaya spent his retired life in his own house at Bhubandanga in Bolpur. He died on 8 November 1985.

Baseball steaks differ from sirloin steaks in that the bone and the tenderloin and bottom round muscles have been removed; and the cut is taken from biceps femoris. A baseball steak is essentially a center cut top sirloin cap steak. This cut of beef is very lean, and is considered very flavorful. The USDA NAMP / IMPS codes related to this subprimal cut are 181A and 184. 181A is obtained from 181 after removing the bottom sirloin and the butt tender (the part of the tenderloin which is in the sirloin). 184 is obtained from 182 after removing the bottom sirloin. The foodservice cuts from 184 are 184A through 184F, its portion cut is 1184 and, the \\"subportion\\" cuts from 1184 are 1184A through 1184F. 181A is not further divided into foodservice cuts. Baseball steaks are made primarily from cut 184F.BEEF SERIES 100 In Australia, this cut is called D-rump in the Handbook of Australian Meat and assigned code 2100. Etymology Baseball steak (center cut top sirloin steak), topped with an onion ring. The name \\"baseball steak\\" refers to the shape of the steak following cooking, since a baseball steak is essentially a center cut top sirloin, after it has been cooked the center domes and swells and forms a rounded shape similar to a baseball. Cooking styles Baseball steak is usually served grilled, broiled, saut√©ed, or pan fried. It is considered more flavorful to prepare a baseball steak cooked to the medium or medium rare stage.  Nutrition  A baseball steak per ounce contains 57 calories, 3 grams of fat, and 6 grams of protein. Like other red meats it also contains iron, creatine, minerals such as zinc and phosphorus, and B-vitamins: (niacin, vitamin B12, thiamin, riboflavin), and lipoic acid.

History In 1679, when he was still a merchant captain, Cook abandoned his ship on the island of Bonaire to escape the Spanish. He then joined the assembly of buccaneers serving under Bartholomew Sharpe. The fleet separated in 1681 after disagreements between Captains Sharpe, John Coxon, and John Watling; Cook led a group electing to leave the South Seas and return to the West Indies. Among the sailors joining him were surgeon Lionel Wafer and navigator William Dampier. Cooke then sailed with the crew of William Wright and Jan Willems (aka \\"Yankey\\"), serving as quartermaster until granted command of a ship they had taken. Unfortunately, the French authorities of Santo Domingo confiscated the ship for piracy because he had failed to obtain a privateering commission. In 1682 Cook and a few men (including Edward Davis) joined the French captain Jean Tristan, whose boat he stole and sailed to the west coast of Santo Domingo. While back in the Caribbean Cook and other buccaneers were protected by Adolph Esmit, Danish Governor of St. Thomas. With his new ship Cook captured two others, one of which became his personal ship which he renamed Revenge after returning to Virginia to refit and sell their captured prizes. Leaving Virginia in 1683 with a crew of 70 (with Davis, Dampier, Wafer, and now Ambrose Cowley as well), Cook sailed to the Guinea coast off western Africa. With more than 70 men under his command he arranged a ruse, pretending to lead a wayward merchant vessel to capture a large Danish ship which he kept and renamed Bachelor's Delight. He took his new ship to the South Sea via the Strait of Magellan in 1684. That January they recorded sighting a \\"phantom island\\" which Cowley named Pepys Island. Cook joined then with English buccaneer John Eaton in March, visiting the Galapagos Islands where Dampier made many observations of flora and fauna. Cook soon took ill and died aboard Bachelor's Delight in the Gulf of Nicoya near Cabo Blanco, Costa Rica in July 1684. The crew then unanimously elected Edward Davis as new leader of the expedition.

Asphaltene compounds are the other primary component of asphalt.  Composition  As viscous liquids, maltenes consist of heavy, dark-colored asphaltic resins, first acidaffins, second acidaffins, and saturates,Heavy Oil Science Center, More About the Chemistry of Asphaltenes and Maltenes, Foster Learning Inc. (http://www.lloydminsterheavyoil.com/asphaltenes2.htm) combined with lighter colored oils.The Asphalt Institute, ES-8, January 1980 The resins provide the adhesive qualities in asphalts; the oils are the carrier medium for both the maltene resins and the asphaltene compounds. Maltenes are characterized by their lower molecular weight and their solubility, in comparison with asphaltenes. Using adsorption chromatography in the presence of an acid reagent, maltenes can be separated into four fractions: * The polar compounds are highly reactive petroleum resins that act as a colloidal dispersion stabilizer for the asphaltene substrate. * First acidaffins are aromatic hydrocarbons, with or without oxygen, nitrogen and sulfur. They provide a chemically compatible dispersing agent for peptized asphaltene. * Second acidaffins are straight chain or cyclic unsaturated petro-hydrocarbons (aka olefins). They are somewhat oily and somewhat resinous. * Saturates (aka paraffins) are either straight or branch chain saturated hydrocarbons. They are the truly oil component of asphalt binder, and function as the gelling agent for the asphalt compounds.  Analysis  It had long been suspected that asphalt pavement deterioration resulted from chemical reactions of specific asphalt components. In 1959, Fritz Rostler observed: ‚ÄúIt is generally recognized that failures of asphalt pavements caused by embrittlement and other changes in physical properties during the aging process are due to chemical reactions of all or some of the asphalt components.‚ÄùThe Role of Asphalt Rejuvenator in Pavement Preservation: Use and Need for Asphalt Rejuvenation, Jim Brownridge http://www.digitalrealitysolutions.com/prl/leaflets/Reclamite-paper-2010.pdf It was Rostler who undertook the necessary research to identify the asphalt components and chemical processes contributing to the aging process. His methodology was to separate the asphalt componentsIntroduction to the Science of Asphalt Binders, Brian J. Majeska, Adventure Material Strategies: https://adventusmaterialdotcom.wordpress.com/2016/07/19/introduction-to-the- science-of-asphalt-binders/ by first using sulfuric acid to separate the soluble components, then using an n-pentane solvent to separate the insoluble components. Rostler‚Äôs work in the rubber industry led to the development of ASTM Test D-2006-70, which accurately identifies the relationships between the light fraction maltenes, acidaffins and saturates. Although this test has not been updated since 1970, it remains an accurate standard for defining the desirable maltene content distribution in asphalt pavement. Rostler Analysis aka ASTM Test D-2006-70 Where PC represents Polar Compounds, A1 represents First Acidaffins, A2 represents Second Acidaffins, and S represents Saturated Hydrocarbons: Min. Max. Maltene Distribution Ratio D-2006-70 0.3 0.6 (PC + A1) / (S + A2) Rostler determined that the loss of the low-molecular-weight maltene components in asphalt is largely responsible for the cracking and hardening seen in aging pavement. This discovery led to the development of commercial rejuvenators that combine maltene fractions of asphalt with a carrier capable of penetrating asphalt pavements, in order to restore the proper balance of asphalt components.  Geochemistry  The geochemical composition of maltenes varies according to the crude oil source, with any given maltene fraction representing a wide variety of base elements of different concentrations, which may include, for example, cobalt, chromium, copper, iron, molybdenum, manganese, nickel, strontium, vanadium, or zincGeochemical implications of trace elements in the saturate, aromatic and resin fractions of crude oil from the Mara and Mara Oeste Fields, Venezuela, Liliana Lopez, Science Direct. https://www.researchgate.net/profile/L_Lopez2/publication/244067568_Geochemical_implications_of_trace_elements_and_sulfur_in_the_saturate_aromatic_and_resin_fractions_of_crude_oil_from_the_Mara_and_Mara_Oeste_fields_Venezuela/links/565d8ecf08ae4988a7bc6286/Geochemical- implications-of-trace-elements-and-sulfur-in-the-saturate-aromatic-and-resin- fractions-of-crude-oil-from-the-Mara-and-Mara-Oeste-fields-Venezuela.pdf -implications-of-trace-elements-and-sulfur-in-the-saturate-aromatic-and-resin- fractions-of-crude-oil-from-the-Mara-and-Mara-Oeste-fields-Venezuela.pdf  References  Category:Asphalt ","title":"Maltenes"},{"id":"61459457","text":"Bricks and Mortar (foaled March 2, 2014) is an American Thoroughbred racehorse who was named the American Horse of the Year in 2019. After winning four of six starts at age three, he missed most of his four-year-old campaign due to illness. At age five however, he established himself as the top-ranked turf horse in North America with wins in the Pegasus World Cup Turf, Muniz Memorial Handicap, Turf Classic Stakes, Manhattan Handicap and Arlington Million. He then won the Breeders' Cup Turf to complete a perfect year. Background Bricks and Mortar is a dark bay horse who was bred in Kentucky by George Strawbridge, Jr. His sire Giant's Causeway was known in Europe as \\"The Iron Horse\\" after earning five consecutive Group One victories in a time span of just eleven weeks. Giant's Causeway then became a three-time leading sire in North America, whose notable offspring include Footstepsinthesand, Shamardal and Take Charge Brandi. The offspring of Giant's Causeway have been successful on both turf and dirt. Bricks and Mortar's dam, Beyond the Waves, won the Prix des Tourelles and was group-stakes placed. \\"Beyond the Waves wasn't brilliant but was really good,\\" said Strawbridge. \\"She was known for trying very hard; hence you have Bricks and Mortar trying very hard, and he is a really tough horse.\\" Bricks and Mortars is the third stakes winner that she has produced. Bricks and Mortar was sold for $200,000 at the 2015 Keeneland September Sales to Klaravich Stables, owned by Seth Klarman, and William H. Lawrence. He was trained by Chad Brown. Racing career Bricks and Mortar did not race at age two. He made his first start on February 18, 2017 at Gulfstream Park over a distance of miles on the turf. He raced in mid-pack for the first six furlongs, shifted to the outside as they turned into the stretch, and closed steadily to win by lengths. In his next start, an allowance race on June 9 at Belmont Park, he ran the final quarter mile in under 22 seconds to win by three-quarters of a length. He then won the Manila Stakes on July 4, closing from last place with a quarter of a mile remaining to win by a neck. On August 4th, he made his graded stakes debut in the National Museum of Racing Hall of Fame Stakes at Saratoga. The favorite was Yoshida, who would subsequently win Grade I races on both turf and dirt. Bricks and Mortar rated just off the pace but ran into traffic problems in the stretch. His jockey shifted him away from the rail until they finally found running room, at which point Bricks and Mortar accelerated rapidly to win by three-quarters of a length. \\"With this horse,\\" said Brown, \\"if you set him down in the clear and give him a target, he gets there... He's done everything we've asked.\\" Bricks and Mortar was narrowly defeated in both of his next two starts, the Saranac and Hill Prince Stakes. After the latter race, he was diagnosed with stringhalt, a neuro- muscular condition that affected his right hind leg. The condition became so severe that the horse was unable to gallop. He was operated on by veterinarian Larry Bramlage and took over a year to return to the racecourse. \\"This is probably one of [Bramlage's] best pieces of work,\\" said Brown. \\"This horse took a long time and he then had some other issues, some bone remodeling. We tried him back and he needed some more time. When he finally made it back he was better than ever.\\" Because of the illness and recovery, Bricks and Mortar made only one start at age four, in an allowance optional claiming race at Gulfstream Park on December 22. He rated behind a fast early pace then made a \\"relentless rally\\" in the stretch to win by half a length. =2019: five-year- old campaign= Bricks and Mortar began his five-year-old campaign on January 26th, 2019 in the inaugural running of the Pegasus World Cup Turf. The race was developed as an evolution of the Pegasus World Cup, whose purse of $16 million in 2018 was split to cover two races ‚Äì the Pegasus World Cup (on the dirt) was run in 2019 with a purse of $9 million, while the Pegasus World Cup Turf had a purse of $7 million. Yoshida was the favorite, with two Grade I wins in 2018: the Turf Classic and Woodward Stakes. The field also included multiple stakes winner Channel Maker (Bowling Green, Joe Hirsch Turf Classic), Aerolithe (NHK Mile Cup, Mainichi Okan) and Catapult (Eddie Read, Del Mar Handicap). The surface was yielding and the distance of miles was the longest Bricks and Mortar had yet run. He again rated in mid-pack behind a fast early pace before starting to make up ground on the final turn. He swung wide and \\"blew by\\" the early leaders to win by lengths. \\"I got a perfect trip,\\" said jockey Irad Ortiz, Jr. \\"My horse put me in a good position and just held it together, saving ground. When I got... him out, he exploded.\\" On March 23rd, he was entered in the Muniz Memorial Handicap over a distance of miles at Fair Grounds Race Course. He broke well and settled in second place, being carried three wide around the first turn. Longshot Markitoff sent a slow early pace, completing the first six furlongs in 1:15.28. At the head of the stretch, Bricks and Mortar took the lead by a head, but Markitoff battled back. The two horses dueled down the stretch with Bricks and Mortar prevailing by a nose in a photo finish. Bricks and Mortar made his next start in the Turf Classic Stakes on May 4 at Churchill Downs, part of the undercard for the Kentucky Derby. The course was labeled good even though rain was falling. Drawing post position 12 in a field of 13, Bricks and Mortar was carried wide around the first turn while racing in ninth place. Markitoff again set a slow pace but gave way at the head of the stretch and finished sixth. Bricks and Mortar began his rally at the head of the stretch and closed steadily despite being bumped with an eighth of a mile remaining. He won by half a length over Qurbaan. \\"He had a tough post and the conditions were tough,\\" said Brown. \\"And he's carrying top weight and he found a way to get there again. He's just a remarkable talent, this horse.\\" On June 8, Bricks and Mortar entered the Manhattan Handicap at Belmont Park. He settled in mid-pack, moving two-wide around the first turn. Down the backstretch, he trailed by lengths but started to make up ground on the final turn. Swinging wide at the head of the stretch, he accelerated and drew off to win by lengths. His time for miles was an excellent 1:58.11 over a firm turf course. In the June 2019 version of the World's Best Racehorse Rankings, Bricks and Mortar was rated at 120 pounds, just one pound behind dirt-runner McKinzie as the top-ranked horse in America. In the National Thoroughbred Racing Association (NTRA) poll, he was ranked first. In August, it was announced that Teruya Yoshida's Shadai Farm had purchased the breeding rights to Bricks and Mortar. Having recently lost leading sire Deep Impact, Yoshida said, \\"We are very anxious to have [Bricks and Mortar] in Japan.\\" On August 10, he entered the Arlington Million as the 1-2 favorite in a field of nine. He raced in sixth place behind the early pace set by Bandua until they entered the stretch. Facing a wall of horses, Ortiz waited for racing room, then urged the horse through a hole. Bricks and Mortar responded with a powerful finishing drive to win by three-quarters of a length. The win moved Bricks and Mortar into contention for the Horse of the Year title. \\"I think there's a chance,\\" said Klarman. \\"I don't want to get ahead of myself. I do think this helps the turf division as a whole, though. I hope so.\\" The win earned Bricks and Mortar an automatic berth in the Breeders' Cup Turf on November 2 at Santa Anita Park. Brown was initially uncertain about entering the race though, since the horse had had a demanding campaign and needed a layoff. Also, Bricks and Mortar had never run at the distance of miles, a distance at which European challengers typically have an advantage. Brown contemplated entering the horse in the Mile, but was worried the horse would lack the explosive kick normally required at that distance after back- to-back races at 10 furlongs. Brown finally settled on entering Bricks and Mortar in the Turf, where his main rival was expected to be the European filly Magical. However, she was scratched shortly before the race. The field still included multiple Grade/Group One winners though, including Anthony Van Dyck (Epsom Derby), Old Persian, Arklow, and Channel Maker. Bricks and Mortar went off as the even money favorite. The pace set by Acclimate was slow, which made Bricks and Mortar somewhat hard to settle. He was seventh with just a quarter of a mile to race, but found racing room in the stretch and was able to win by a neck in the final strides. \\"Today, he was a little keen with me,\\" said Ortiz. \\"So I just tried to get him to relax. When I asked him to run, I looked behind me and saw we were clear. He saw that other horse in front of us, and he fought all the way to the wire.\\" In December, Bricks and Mortar was named the winner of the 2019 Secretariat Vox Populi Award, voted on by racing fans to recognize \\"the horse whose popularity and racing excellence best resounded with the general public.\\" Kate Chenery Tweedy, daughter of Secretariat's owner Penny Tweedy, commented that Bricks and Mortar's comeback from illness was \\"a favorite plot in American sports lore ‚Äì the return of a champion.\\" In recognition of his perfect campaign, Bricks and Mortar was named the 2019 American Horse of the Year at the 49th annual Eclipse Awards, earning 204 of 241 votes. He was also the unanimous selection as Champion Male Turf Horse.

Paul Li√©geois (fl.1650-1670) was a French still-life painter, active in Paris. He was probably of Flemish origin, as suggested by his name. Life and work The details of his life remain very poorly known. He seems to have been relatively successful and his works were acquired by many amateur art collectors. The famous painter, Philippe de Champaigne is known to have made positive comments about his work and he was a friend of the noted miniaturist and engraver, . According to surviving records, he also received commissions from the rural minor nobility. His work marks a transitional phase from the realistic still- lifes that dominated the first half of the 17th Century (represented by Louise Moillon, Lubin Baugin, Jacques Linard and ), and the generation that came to maturity during the reign of King Louis XIV (such as Jean-Baptiste Monnoyer and Jean-Baptiste Belin), who favored more theatrical, detailed and decorative compositions. He excelled in the representation of fruit, especially peaches and grapes, whose textures he faithfully rendered. Unlike his contemporaries, he eschewed obviously symmetrical compositions; favoring a disorderly effect with textural contrasts that made the arrangements look spontaneous. His dark palette and emphasis on blues bring to mind the work of another still-life painter, Willem van Aelst, who was active in Paris at the same time. His works may be seen at the Louvre, Mus√©e des beaux-arts de Chamb√©ry and the Mus√©e des Beaux-Arts de Rouen. Many are in private collections.

The House version of her legislation was introduced by Rep. Salud Carbajal and re-introduced on 14 February 2019, one year after the Stoneman Douglas High School shooting.https://augustafreepress.com/extreme-risk-protection-order-act- sponsors-respond-to-trump/ Sen.

In order for a state to get grants under the Act, it has to enact a red flag law meeting certain requirements, such as allowing family members, rather than only police, to petition the courts. Rhode Island, for example, would be unable to get grants under the Act without strengthening its red flag law.https://www.wpri.com/target-12/ri-red-flag-law- not-strong-enough-to-win-proposed-federal-grants/ A provision by Rep. Ken Buck (R) proposed \\"allow the issuance of a red flag order against anyone whose name appears in a gang database if there was probable cause to include that individual in the database\\". Rep. Eric Swalwell (D) requested to add \\"individuals affiliated with white nationalism\\" to the amendment as a Red Flag Indicator in exchange for her support. Rep. Ken Buck agreed, with the stipulation that \\"any type of supremacy\\" should be included, and revised the provision accordingly. The amendment failed 11-21 on September 14, 2019.https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/congress/democrats-frown-on- targeting-gang-databases-with-red-flag-laws/ Congressional action Feinstein and Blumenthal argued that federal legislation is needed because \\"there is still no nationwide tool that would allow law enforcement and the courts to prevent tragedies like Isla Vista.\\" Shortly after the 2019 El Paso shooting and 2019 Dayton shooting, Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham announced his support for such legislation, stating that \\"grants will be given to law enforcement so they can hire and consult with mental health professionals to better determine which cases need to be acted upon.\\" Feinstein and Rubio urged Graham to take up their bills. Blumenthal welcomed Republicans' openness to the plan as a \\"bipartisan breakthrough\\" and \\"major promising development.\\" Such legislation is also supported by Democratic presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg. According to Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer, Democrats will try to require any red flag measure that comes to the Senate floor be paired with a vote on legislation establishing universal background checks. He noted that Republican bills being proposed do not require states to adopt red flag legislation.https://www.politico.com/story/2019/08/07/chuck-schumer-universal- background-laws-gun-control-1451041 Schumer said that Democrats would not accept a half-measure, arguing, \\"The notion that passing a tepid version of an Extreme Risk Protection Order (E.R.P.O.) bill ‚Äî alone ‚Äî is close to getting the job done in addressing rampant gun violence in the U.S. is wrong and would be an ineffective cop-out.\\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/chuck-schumer-red- flag-laws_n_5d4b370be4b01e44e474847a Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said he expects background checks, assault weapons and red flag laws to be part of September's Senate debate about measures aimed at addressing gun violence.

Career Rorex's art uses the Bacone flatstyle, which employs little shading or dimension. Many of her paintings revolve around women, their work tending children and crops, and the different phases of their life, such as pregnancy, motherhood or friendship. She also incorporates symbolism, using native motifs like corn, and the sun and moon as woman's companion. Her figures typically are placed in landscape settings. She began exhibiting her art at regional events for Native American artists, winning numerous awards. She won the Jerome Tiger Memorial Award at the Trail of Tears Art Show hosted at the Cherokee Heritage Center in Park Hill, Oklahoma, for three consecutive years and won the award five times in total. In 1988, she was invited along with other artists to participate in the Cherokee Legends Exhibit at the Museum of the Cherokee Indian in Cherokee, North Carolina. In 1990, concerns with non-Indigenous people marketing imitation Native art led to passage of the Indian Arts and Crafts Act. Passage of the law meant that people who were not enrolled in recognized federal or state tribes or not tribally-designated artisans were unable to market their wares as \\"Indian artists\\". The law made it possible for violators to be subject to a five year prison term or fines up to $1,000,000. The passage of the law created factions ‚Äî those who believed it eliminated false advertising and misappropriation of traditional knowledge, those who believed it prevented poseurs from impersonating Native people, and those like Rorex, whose livelihoods were threatened. Describing herself as a \\"Native American artist\\" while selling her paintings could have resulted in fines or jail time. Though the law made provisions for non-members to be certified as \\"artisans\\" by a recognized tribe, Rorex refused to petition the council, believing such a request would imply \\"that her family, relatives and ancestors were all frauds\\" and their resistance to enrollment was dishonorable. In 1991, when the Cherokee Tribal Council passed a resolution for her uncle Willard Stone to be a certified Cherokee artisan, Rorex and other members of the Stone family asked that the certification be withdrawn, as it recognized his work, but not his heritage. She was barred from participating in the exhibitions of the Five Civilized Tribes Museum, the Philbrook Museum of Art's American Indian Heritage Competition, or the Tsa-La-Gi Annual, among other events. The Thomas Jefferson Center for the Protection of Free Expression took up her case and the argument of individual autonomy in violation of her First Amendment rights. No legislative action came of the involvement and in 1996, the protocols for enforcement of the act were finalized. Rorex was featured in a month-long solo exhibition in 1995, Harmony, Strength and the Spiritual: The Art of Jeanne Walker Rorex, held at the Institute for American Indian Studies in Washington, Connecticut. The following year, another solo exhibition hosted by the Red Cloud Gallery in St. Petersburg, Florida, showcased her art. The gallery had hosted some of her works over the previous five years, but the exhibition featured more than 200 pieces of her work. Around 2000, Rorex married James R. Bridges and changed her professional name to Jeanne Rorex- Bridges. Though she continued to produce artworks, she had to market herself as an Oklahoma artist. The couple traveled extensively, marketing her works in 17 different states, participating in events like the annual Rio Grande Arts & Crafts Festival of Albuquerque, New Mexico and the Native American and Wildlife Art Festival of Atlanta. In 2011, Rorex-Bridges had to learn how to paint left-handed after a stroke. Changing her former stance, she became an enrolled member of the state-recognized Echota Cherokee Tribe of Alabama, a tribe whose validity is questioned by the three federally-recognized Cherokee tribal governments. Rorex-Bridges' work has been featured on the cover of numerous books and she has worked as an illustrator, having 16 nationally- published books to her credit. One of these, Crossing Bok Chitto, an award winning children's book by Tim Tingle (Choctaw) features 18 of her paintings to illustrate the story of a Choctaw girl who helped a slave boy escape from pre-Civil War Mississippi. Another series she painted, Sisters (1991-1995), focused on the interconnections between African and indigenous people, as well as their shared ancestry. The series highlights their shared history, as there were many people of African descent who were forcibly relocated with Native people in the Trail of Tears. In 2012, she was interviewed as part of the Oklahoma Native Artist Oral History Project of Oklahoma State University. In 2016, the State of Oklahoma passed legislation which barred people who were members of state recognized tribes from showing their works. Rorex-Bridges, Peggy Fontenot, and others were once again barred from participating in major Native Art shows. They were allowed to return to venues in 2017, after Peggy Fontenot filed a lawsuit challenging the law, https://pacificlegal.org/case/fontenot-v-hunter-attorney-general-of-oklahoma/, and the Attorney General of the State of Oklahoma agreed to stay enforcement of the law while the case was pending. https://pacificlegal.org/oklahoma- agrees-stay-enforcement-indian-art-law/ In 2019, the United States District Court for the Western District of Oklahoma declared the state law unconstitutional, and permanently enjoined the law from being enforced in the future, on the grounds that the federal Indian Arts and Crafts Act of 1990 preempted Oklahoma's more restrictive law. https://pacificlegal.org/wp- content/uploads/2019/03/Fontenot-v.-Hunter-Court-Opinion.pdf Since the federal statute allowed artists who were members of any tribe in the United States, the state law could not narrow that to artists who were members of a federally recognized tribe. https://pacificlegal.org/wp- content/uploads/2019/03/Fontenot-v.-Hunter-Court-Opinion.pdf That year, she was one of the artists featured in the Women of the Five Civilized Tribes Exhibit hosted by the Five Civilized Tribes Museum of Muskogee, Oklahoma.

The album composed by A. R. Rahman, has been in development since 2015. The soundtrack consist of 14 songs each in Hindi, Tamil and Telugu languages, including background score. This is the first Indian soundtrack album to use Dolby Atmos technology. The original version of the soundtrack was released on 20 March 2020. Development According to the title \\"99 Songs\\", composer A. R. Rahman revealed that, the total number of the songs in the film, does not have 99 in number, but the film will present 14 original compositions for each language (Hindi, Tamil and Telugu) and features some background music. Rahman has been working on the soundtrack since 2015, which features some international artists. Lyrics for the original Hindi version of the soundtrack have been given by Navneet Virk, Dilshaad Shabbir Shaikh, Abhay Jodhpurkar, Munna Shaukat and Raftaar. Rahman had worked with Navneet Virk for some soundtracks like OK Jaanu, Kaatru Veliyidai and Viceroy's House, with awarding the World Soundtrack Award ‚Äì Public Choice, for his work in the latter. Shashwat Singh, who had played a role of a playback singer for the film's lead character Ehan Bhat, is an alumnus of Rahman's KM Music Conservatory, Chennai. During the film's production stage, Singh has recorded two songs with Rahman, Singh has heard on five tracks in the film. The audio rights of this film has been bought by Sony Music India. With this 99 Songs, marked the 23rd year of the label with Rahman. 99 Songs is the first Indian soundtrack album to use Dolby Atmos technology, and Rahman became the first Indian artist to create music album of the film in this technology. Songs O Aashiqa Sung by Shashwat Singh, with lyrics written by Navneet Virk; Scroll.in stated that \\"the song written as apaean to a lover who is half-muse and half-divinity, the tune balances subdued passion with fearful reverence. The singing and the production start off mellow and rise slowly to a rapturous crescendo.\\" Sofia The Ballad number \\"Sofia\\" is a lush melody which starts in a gentle manner backed by Keba Jeremiah's wonderful guitar strums. a gentle but expansively arranged romantic melody that touches a new high in the final minute when the choral harmonies kick in, arranged by Arjun Chandy and Leon D'Souza supplying the additional vocals, towards the end giving the terrific finish to this beautiful song. Nayi Nayi Nayi Nayi is the fast-paced rock number in the album but the track is more generic pop song material single-handedly prodded by Shashwat singh, Raftaar (crooning the Rap portions), with backing vocals by Ranjit Barot, Warren Mendonsa and Ardeshir Mistry. The arrangements are strictly confined to the hard rock genre with the brief lovely Tabla cameo in the middle of the track. Humnawaa Rahman shared recording of the song \\"Humnawaa\\" on Instagram, which was sung by Armaan Malik and Shashaa Tirupati. This was the second collaboration between Rahman, Malik and Tirupati after recording for \\"Mechanical Sundariye\\", the Hindi version of the Original song \\"Endhira Logathu Sundhariye\\" from 2.0. The song written by, Dilshad Shabbir Shaikh and Abhay Jodhpurkar, is based on classical music, rhythm and blues. This song was released on 20 March 2020, along with all the other songs in the film. The track definitely warrants multiple listen especially for the brilliance displayed by Rahman with the background piano score. Jwalamukhi During the post-production stage of the film, the male version of this song, was crooned by Arijit Singh, and was released first on 20 February 2020. The female version is sung by Poorvi Koutish, was released on 26 February 2020. This song is mastered in Dolby Atmos and each musical chord will strike an emotional connection with the listener. Soja Soja Sung by Shashaa Tirupati, the song is a fun track, filled with jazzy arrangements with the terrific mix of piano, handled by American keyboardist Randy Kerber, and the brass ensemble. The arrangement is once again clever ‚Äì a slow-burning prelude that belies what is to come, until the main song kicks in literally with a bang. Sai Shirdi Sai Rahman released a song Sai Shirdi Sai in three languages (Hindi, Tamil, Telugu), from the movie as a single on 5 April 2019. It is a devotional Sufi number, sung by Bela Shende. The soundtrack album, contained only the original Hindi version. Teri Nazar \\"Teri Nazar\\" was released as the fifth single of the album, on 13 March 2020, which is based on Indian Classical Music and Sufi Music, set on Charukesi Raga. Sung by Shashwat Singh, which reiterates feelings to recede from his/her love. Dilshaad Shabbir Shaikh who works for Rahman as music supervisor, wrote lyrics along with Navneet Virk. Gori Godh Bhari It is sung by Anuradha Sriram, Alka Yagnik and Shweta Mohan, which is based on Bageshri raga and Indian classical music, supported by a rich orchestration highlighted by sarod (Sarang Kulkarni), sitar (Asad Khan), shehnai (Omkar Dhumal) and tabla. O Mera Chand A lullaby number sung by Bela Shende; the tune though relatively treads along the familiar territory, the serene feel provided by the tune is a blissful one. The chorus from \\"Sai Shirdi Sai\\" makes a reappearance here, in the interlude. Veere Kadh De A fast- paced rap number sung by Sarthak Kalyan, Swagat Rathod, whom were a part of the composer's YouTube contests, \\"ARRived\\" electronic sounds with a smattering of Punjabi folk elements. The rap portions were performed by Shiv (thoughtsfornow). The track is an interesting attempt by the composer despite the multiple elements of the track didn't blend well as expected. The Voice Without Words The song filled with instrumental and, some with the expansive orchestration, but the whispery words of Poorva Koutish are packed with the hypnotic arrangements. The Oracle In pre-production period, When the first screenplay draft of 99 Songs was ready for review, A. R. Rahman and director Vishesh Krishnamoorthy, researched to find its sound. At the YM Movies Office in Chennai, Rahman played a melody that was echoing between them. After it revealed that the delicate melody was now a thunderous entity, it became the theme for the film, which was titled \\"The Oracle\\". The first bit of music to make it out into the world. This song was released as the film's first single on 14 February 2020, which coincides with the Valentine's Day. The song starts with the gentle piano keys, and a bit tentatively, the piece picks up pace and gravity as it goes, with the Budapest Scoring Orchestra and flautist Kareem Kamalakar joining the composer. Promotion On 27 April 2019, the lead actor of the film Ehan Bhat joined A. R. Rahman on Star Plus reality show The Voice, and performed the film's theme music, which was titled \\"The Oracle\\". Rahman performed live to the music of 99 Songs at the Busan International Film Festival, held in Busan, South Korea, where the film's premiere took place on 9 October 2019. The performance made the audience spellbound. The film's team also walked the red carpet and also took a selfie with over 3,500 audience members. Track listing  Reception  Koimoi rated the soundtrack album 4.5 out of 5, stating \\"A. R. Rahman Gives Us A Musical Treat We Deserve In The Times When Originality Almost Lost Its Touch\\". Scroll.in reviewed it as \\"A 14-song album is allowed to take a qualitative dip every now and then. There is enough in 99 Songs to live with and revisit.\\" The Hindu started that the film music have zero fuss and fanfare. The other speciality of this 14-track album is that it puts the spotlight on two supremely-gifted vocal talents in Shashwat Singh and Bela Shende. Music Aloud gave the album 4.5 out of 5 and summarized \\"An album that has been a very long time coming, and ends up being totally worth the wait. A.R.Rahman produces a thoroughly diverse soundtrack that is the best he has given Bollywood in a long time. And most importantly, it releases in its entirety, well before the movie‚Äôs release. Movie Crow, gave the soundtrack 4 out of 5 and started \\"The whopping 14 song soundtrack is a nostalgic blend of good old Rahman melodies as well as composer leaves his own touch backed by an exceptional set of singers.\\" A review by A Humming Heart concluded, \\"With that bit of purely nostalgic exercise out of the way, the soundtrack is a fairly impressive collection of genres, moods, and voices. AR Rahman, thanks to he also doubling as a producer, includes compositions ranging an impressively wide spectrum ‚Äî some, if not all, are likely to find takers in ardent fans and music-lovers alike. The boy-band rock song ‚ÄòNayi Nayi‚Äô, the devotional ‚ÄòSai Shirdi Sai‚Äô, the classical ‚ÄòGori Godh Bhari‚Äô, the dazzling jazz ‚ÄòSoja Soja‚Äô and more. The album overall succeeds in registering coherent, nostalgic yet refreshing sounds, and is one of AR Rahman's most definitive works since 2015\\", and gave 9/10 to the album. Background score In a tweet Keba Jeremiah confirmed that he has played guitar for background score.

Eharo masks (literally \\"dance head\\" or \\"dance mask\\") were a type of mask used by the Elema people of the eastern Gulf of Papua as part of the \\"hevehe\\" cycle of masked rituals. These masks were crafted from barkcloth, vegetable fiber, and various pigments. In contrast to the large sacred hevehe masks, the smaller eharo masks were meant for amusing the audience, and were used only twice during the 7 to 20 years long hevehe cycle (beginning and end). The cycle is not practiced anymore today. Some represented specific spirits, while others were simply humorous archetypes from stories. Because they are not as sacred compared to other masks, the women of the village were allowed to observe the mask's construction. These masks would later be burned about a month after the ceremonies, making it difficult to recover samples. It was during the time period of these practices that Vailala Madness took place. In an effort many rituals were destroyed and replaced with more European- accepted ones. Although this suppression took place, the Papuan Gulf people continued to practice these cycles and display their heritage. In modern-day these masks cycle through museums, along with photo galleries such as Hevebe: arts of the Papuan Gulf. This exhibition was where audience members were introduced to the vibrant and active nature of these masks to add a new dimension aside from the immobile items seen in collections.

It ended in a Romanian victory which led to the Romanian occupation of the west bank of the Cserna (Cerna) River for over two months. Background Romania launched its invasion of Transylvania on 27 August 1916. However, despite not being an actual part of Transylvania, the west bank of the Cserna had logistical importance, being the location of the city of Orsova (today Or»ôova), which was the end of a railroad as well as a port on the Danube. The Cserna River streamed from the Transylvanian Alps, forming the border between Romania and the Hungarian part of Austria-Hungary up to a point around north of Orsova, from where the border went south, overland, towards the Danube. The Romanian attack was carried out by the Romanian 1st Infantry Division, under General Ion Dragalina. The division was part of General Ioan Culcer's 1st Romanian Army. The 1st Division comprised seven infantry regiments, a force which reflected the importance of Dragalina's offensive. In reality, Orsova was rejected as a staging area by the Central Powers, due to its weak transportation links. Furthermore, the Romanians did not have to capture the town in order to deny its use to their enemy. It would have sufficed if the Romanians settled on capturing only the steep ridge east of Orsova, where their artillery could render the town uninhabitable. Opposed to the Romanian 1st Infantry Division was the Austro- Hungarian 145th Infantry Brigade, under Colonel Rudolf von Fiebich-Ripke. The brigade - part of General Arthur Arz von Straussenburg's 1st Army - had the equivalent strength of a regiment, consisting of three infantry battalions and one rear-area guard battalion, with three machine-gun sections, two batteries (31 artillery pieces) and the river monitor SMS √Ålmos. Despite being heavily outnumbered, Orsova's defenders benefited from the advantage provided by the steep ridge which ran north to south, named the Alion Height. It was a formidable barrier, and Fiebich-Ripke was well aware of this, as he had his units deployed along the ridge. Also, the Romanian 1st Division was isolated from the rest of the 1st Army.Michael B. Barrett, Indiana University Press, Oct 23, 2013, Prelude to Blitzkrieg: The 1916 Austro-German Campaign in Romania, pp. 1-2, 4, 20-21 and 103 Battle The battle started on the morning of 28 August, with a bombardment of Turnu Severin by the √Ålmos. The monitor had left Orsova at dawn, shelling harbor facilities, the rail yards, a cavalry barracks and some shipyards at Turnu Severin, where Dragalina's division had its headquarters. The Austrian warship fired almost 500 artillery rounds of 75 mm, as well as considerable machine gun fire. Returning upstream to Orsova, √Ålmos couldn't overcome the current until her crew threw 25 tons of coal overboard. In retaliation, the Romanians put Orsova under artillery fire that same day. The Romanian shelling was directed against the fortifications of Orsova, but it was indirect, as the Romanians fired across the Alion Mountain. Dragalina recognized the Alion Height, towering above the city on the east side of the Cserna's mouth, as the key to the Austro-Hungarian position. The Romanians launched a full-scale assault on 1 September, their numbers enabling them to take the Alion Height by the end of the day. A simultaneous diversionary attack to the north on that same day enabled the Romanians to capture Meh√°dia (today Mehadia) and Herkulesf√ºrd≈ë (today BƒÉile Herculane). On 2 September, the Austro-Hungarians had to withdraw to the eastern bank of the Cserna, enabling the Romanians to occupy the entire range of hills which dominated Orsova. The Romanians entered Orsova itself on the following day. The Austro-Hungarians conducted a rear-guard action, but the Romanians forced the passage of the Cserna River and captured a few more heights. On 4 September, the Austro-Hungarians abandoned the entire west bank of the Cserna, retreating north of Meh√°dia.The Times, 1917, The Times History and Encyclopaedia of the War, Volume 11, p. 213Michael B.

A wargame is a strategy game that realistically simulates warfare. History =Early German wargames (1780-1806)= The first wargame was invented in Prussia in 1780 by Johann Christian Ludwig Hellwig, who was a college professor in Brunswick. Hellwing wanted to design a game by which he could teach some principles of warfare to his students, many of whom were noblemen destined for military service, but he also wanted his game to be fun and accessible to the general public so that he could sell it as a leisure game. Hellwig chose to base his game on chess, believing that this would attract chess players and make it easier for them to learn the rules.In a letter from Hellwig, dated 26 September 1801, quoted in : \\"The first thought which presented itself to my mind was that the learning of my game ought not to be burdened with too many details if it was to fulfill its mission. I judged from the first that I should achieve my object in the quickest way if I took for its basis the game of chess, in favor with so many distinguished persons of all ranks. My idea was to adapt, as far as possible, the game of chess to my own game, in order so to interest amateurs that they would at least give mine a trial. [...] experience confirmed the wisdom of my expectations, for chess players were the first to welcome my invention [...]\\" Hellwig published a second edition of his rulebook in 1803. As in chess, Hellwig's game was played on a grid of squares, but it was a much larger grid, and the squares were color-coded to represent different types of terrain: mountains, swamp, water, trenches, etc. The layout of the terrain was not fixed, which allowed players to create their own custom battlefields. The pieces in the game represented real military units: cavalry, infantry, artillery, and various support units. As in chess, only a single piece could occupy a square, and the pieces moved square by square, either laterally or diagonally. Over normal terrain, infantry could move a maximum distance of eight squares, dragoons could move twelve squares, and light cavalry could move sixteen squares -- intuitively mirroring the speed at which these units move in the real world. But terrain could impede movement: mountains were impassable, swamps slowed units down, rivers could only be crossed with the help of a special pontoon unit, etc. A player could only move one piece per turn, or one group of pieces if they were arranged in a rectangle. A piece could capture an enemy piece by moving into its square, just like in chess, but infantry and artillery pieces could also shoot enemy pieces, at a maximum ranges of two to three squares. Unlike chess, the pieces had orientation: for instance, an infantry piece could only shoot an enemy piece if they were facing it and flanking it.: \\"Infantry and artillery units may discharge their firearms instead of advancing on an enemy; if an infantry unit destroys an enemy with gunfire, that enemy is removed from the board but the infantry unit does not advance to occupy the vacated position. The efficacy of rifles rests largely on the orientation of the opposing unit: infantry units facing one another enjoy effectively immunity to one another‚Äôs gunfire, so only flanking fire had an effect.\\" Hellwig's wargame could also simulate the fog of war to limited degree: while the players were arranging their pieces in their starting positions, they had the option of placing a screen across the board so that they could not observe their opponent's arrangement until the game started. Once the game was in progress, however, there was no hiding anything. Hellwig's wargame was a great success, and inspired other inventors to develop their own chess-like wargames. In 1796, another Prussian named Johann Georg Julius Venturini invented his own wargame, inspired by Hellwig's game. Venturini's game was played on an even larger grid.: \\"Although Venturini replaced the wargame board with a map, he still imposed a one-inch square grid over that map, and he imagined each square of the grid to be two thousand paces (Schritte) across, which if we assume a German military pace of rough thirty inches, means his game employs a scale around 1:60,000, or a bit shy of one mile per square.\\" Venturini's game also added rules governing logistics, such as supply convoys and mobile bakeries, and the effects of weather and seasons, making this perhaps the first operational- level wargame.: \\"Venturini increases the variety of terrain, takes into account seasons and weather, vastly increases the sorts of entrenchments and fortifications that combatants might construct, and adds significant, but not necessarily exciting, detail to the feeding, equipping and support of forces in the field.\\" In 1806, an Austrian named Johann Ferdinand Opiz developed a wargame aimed at both civilian and military markets. Like Hellwig's game, it used a modular grid-based board. But unlike Hellwig's game, Opiz's game used dice rolls to simulate the unpredictability of real warfare. This innovation was controversial at the time. Hellwig, who designed his wargame for both leisure as well as instruction, felt that introducing chance would spoil the fun.: trans.:\\"A secondary intention was to give a pleasant entertainment to a person who did not need such instruction through a game in which nothing depends on chance but on the direction of the player.\\" These games were popular among recreational gamers, but they weren't taken seriously by an army because they were too unrealistic. The chess-like grid forced the terrain into unnatural forms, such as rivers that flowed in straight lines and turned at right angles. A unit could only move from one square to the next, not within the square, and only a single unit could occupy a square at a time, even if that square represented a square mile.: \\"...the grid imposed on the wargames of Hellwig and Venturini significantly limited the capacity of these systems to represent the position of troops realistically. Effectively, in a board wargame divided into squares of a scale mile across, there is only one position that troops within a mile‚Äôs range could hold.\\": \\"In these early attempts the landscape had been forced into squares and triangles, with rivers, seas, villages, mountains, valleys and so on pushed out of their natural shapes and into straight lines. In the same way movements of troops, the representation of troop types, the effect of firepower, were also severely modified in such a way that a realistic picture of events failed to be produced.\\" =Kriegsspiel= In 1824, a Prussian army officer named Georg Heinrich Rudolf Johann von Reisswitz developed a more realistic wargame specifically for the Prussian army. Instead of a chess-like grid, the game was played on accurate topographical maps of the kind the Prussian army used in the field. This allowed the game to model terrain naturally and simulate battles in real locations. The scale of the map 1:8000, which was smaller than any wargame before it. Troop formations were represented by little rectangular pieces made of lead, which were painted either blue or red to represent the side they belonged to. Reisswitz used data collected during the Napoleonic Wars to accurately model how the units performed in battle. For instance, his manual provided tables which listed how far each unit type could move in a round over various types of terrain. The game used dice to model variable weapon damage, and firearms damage generally decreased the farther away the target was. Unlike chess pieces, the units could suffer partial losses before being defeated, which were tracked on a separate sheet of paper; Reisswitz's wargame was the first to use unit hitpoints. The most important innovation was perhaps the introduction of an umpire. The players didn't move the pieces across the map themselves. Instead, they wrote orders for their troops on scraps of paper which they discretely submitted to the umpire, and the umpire would move the pieces according to how he judged the virtual troops would carry out their orders. The umpire also managed secret information such as the location of hidden units. The umpire only placed a piece on the map when he judged that the unit in question had entered the enemy's line of sight. This was the first wargame to properly simulate the fog of war. A number of privately-funded kriegsspiel clubs were formed in Prussia. They were mainly frequented by army officers, but some had civilian members as well, so kriegsspiel was certainly being played recreationally during this time. In 1870, Prussia defeated France in the Franco-Prussian War. The Prussian army did not have any significant advantage in weaponry, numbers, or troop training, but it was the only army in the world that practiced wargaming, so naturally many people credited Prussia's victory to its wargaming tradition.: \\"In the aftermath of the 1870-1871 Franco-Prussian War, European and world military opinion suddenly became enamored of things German, including Kriegsspiel, to the use of which many experts attributed the German victories.\\": \\"During the wars of German unification, Prussian wargaming appears to have provided a significant advantage. How else can Prussia‚Äôs lopsided victories be explained? Prussian forces were more often than not outnumbered, weapon advantages were mixed, and training methods were similar, though some think Prussia had an advantage in the education of staff officers. At this time, though, the Prussian military had a monopoly on second- generation wargaming and had integrated it into its staff education and its staff planning methods, especially at the higher levels.\\" Armies around the world now took an interest in German wargames, which they referred to as kriegsspiel (the German word for \\"wargame\\"). Kriegsspiel also gained a substantial following among civilian gamers. The world's first recreational wargaming club was the University Kriegspiel [sic] Club, founded in 1873 at Oxford University in England. =Miniature wargaming= In 1881, the Scottish writer Robert Louis Stevenson became the first documented person to use toy soldiers in a wargame, and thus he might be the inventor of miniature wargaming. However, in his game, each toy soldier was used to represent an entire unit rather than an individual, and his playing field was just a chalk map drawn on the floor. Stevenson never published his rules, but according to an account by his stepson, they were very sophisticated and realistic, on par with German military wargames. In 1898, the British writer Fred T. Jane published the first rulebook for a naval wargame: Rules for the Jane Naval War Game. Jane's wargame was also the first published wargame to use miniature models. It used scale models of warships made out of cork and wires; the wires were used for guns and masts. Jane's rulebook described in great detail the capabilities of the warships, such as the range and armor-penetrating power of the guns. It also simulated localized damage, such as what would happen to a warship if its boiler was damaged, or its gun battery. H. G. Wells and his friends playing Little Wars. The English writer H. G. Wells developed his own codified rules for playing with toy soldiers, which he published in a book titled Little Wars (1913). This is widely remembered as the first rulebook for miniature wargaming (for terrestrial armies, at least). Little Wars had very simple rules to make it fun and accessible to anyone. Little Wars did not use dice or computation to resolve fights. For artillery attacks, players used spring-loaded toy cannons which fired little wooden cylinders to physically knock over enemy models. As for infantry and cavalry, they could only engage in hand-to-hand combat (even if the figurines exhibited firearms). When two infantry units fought in close quarters, the units would suffer non-random losses determined by their relative sizes. Little Wars was designed for a large field of play, such as a lawn or the floor of a large room. An infantryman could move up to one foot per turn, and a cavalryman could move up to two feet per turn. To measure these distances, players used a two-foot long piece of string. Wells was also the first wargamer to use scale models of buildings, trees, and other terrain features to create a three-dimensional battlefield.H. G. Wells (1913). Little Wars Wells' rulebook failed to invigorate the miniature wargaming community. A possible reason was the two World Wars, which de-glamorized war and caused shortages of tin and lead that made model soldiers expensive. Another reason may have been the lack of magazines or clubs dedicated to miniature wargames. Miniature wargaming was seen as a niche within the larger hobby of making and collecting model soldiers. In 1955, a California man named Jack Scruby began making inexpensive miniature models for miniature wargames out of type metal. Scruby's major contribution to the miniature wargaming hobby was to network players across America and the UK. At the time, the miniature wargaming community was minuscule, and players struggled to find each other. In 1956, Scruby organized the first miniature wargaming convention in America, which was attended by just fourteen people. From 1957 to 1962, he self-published the world's first wargaming magazine, titled The War Game Digest, through which wargamers could publish their rules and share game reports. It had less than two hundred subscribers, but it did establish a community that kept growing.Jon Peterson, in Around the same time in the United Kingdom, Donald Featherstone began writing an influential series of books on wargaming, which represented the first mainstream published contribution to wargaming since Little Wars. Titles included : War Games (1962), Advanced Wargames, Solo Wargaming, Wargame Campaigns, Battles with Model Tanks, Skirmish Wargaming. Such was the popularity of such titles that other authors were able to have published wargaming titles. This output of published wargaming titles from British authors coupled with the emergence at the same time of several manufacturers providing suitable wargame miniatures (e.g. Miniature Figurines, Hinchliffe, Peter Laing, Garrisson, Skytrex, Davco, Heroic & Ros) was responsible for the huge upsurge of popularity of the hobby in the late 1960s and into the 1970s.See James Dunnigan's Foreword to Donald Featherstone's Lost Tales, published 2009. Dunnigan clearly places Featherstone in his role as a key propagator of wargaming as a hobby and tool for professionals. In 1956, Tony Bath published what was the first ruleset for a miniature wargame set in the medieval period. These rules were a major inspiration for Gary Gygax's Chainmail (1971). From 1983 to 2010, Games Workshop produced what was the first miniature wargame designed to be used with proprietary models: Warhammer Fantasy. Earlier miniature wargames were designed to be played using generic models that could be bought from any manufacturer, but Warhammer Fantasy's setting featured original characters with distinctive visual designs, and their models were produced exclusively by Games Workshop. =Board wargaming (1954- )= Tactics (1954) was the first successful board wargame. The first successful commercial board wargame was Tactics (1954) by an American named Charles S. Roberts. What distinguished this wargame from previous ones is that it was mass-produced and all the necessary materials for play were bundled together in a box. Previous wargames were often just a rulebook and required players to obtain the other materials themselves.: \\"Unlike many earlier war games for the home, which amounted to little more than a set of rules and the occasional map, Tactics came with all the miniature tanks, infantry, and planes need to play in its box.\\" The game was played on a pre-fabricated board with a fixed layout, which is why it was called a board game. Roberts later founded the Avalon Hill Game Company, the first firm that specialized in commercial wargames. In 1958, Avalon Hill released Gettysburg, which was a retooling of the rules of Tactics, and was based on the historical Battle of Gettysburg. Gettysburg became the most widely-played wargame yet.Jon Peterson, in Board wargames were more popular than miniature wargames. One reason was that assembling a playset for miniature wargaming was expensive, time-consuming, and require artisanal skill. Another reason was that board wargames could be played by correspondence. Board wargames were usually grid-based, or else designed in some way that moves could be explained in writing in simple terms. This was not possible with the free-form nature of miniature wargames. =A smaller but continuing presence= The wargaming hobby declined in the 1980s. One factor was competition from role-playing games such as Dungeons and Dragons: the sort of person who would have gone into wargaming instead went into RPGs. A second factor was the rise of affordable and powerful personal computers and gaming consoles. Computer wargames were easier to learn and faster to play because the routine procedures and arithmetic were automated.

He withdrew from public activity in 2004 and is currently retired.  Biography  = Family = Jos√© Rivas Font√°n was born on 31st August 1941 in San Mart√≠n de Verducido - Xeve, in the municipality and province of Pontevedra.

Administratively the area where the hut stood belongs now to the Northeast Greenland National Park. The site is located in southern Hochstetter Foreland on the western side of Peters Bay, northeast of the mouth of Ardencaple Fjord, about from Cape Klinkerfues.Prostar Sailing Directions 2005 Greenland and Iceland Enroute, p. 124 History The station was built in 1932 by John Gi√¶ver's expedition, about northeast of the mouth of Ardencaple Fjord. It was named \\"J√≥nsb√∫\\" after Norwegian journalist John Schjelderup Gi√¶ver (1901‚Äì1970), who lived as a hunter and trapper in East Greenland from 1929‚Äì1934. The station had also been known as \\"Norsk Petersbugt Station\\". Together with Myggbukta, as well as Storfjord, Torgilsbu and Finnsbu further south, Jonsbu became part of the Norwegian contribution to the International Polar Year 1932‚Äì33. The original station was burnt down in August 1943 during World War II in an attack by Greenland Patrol ship . The ship destroyed the station in order to prevent its facilities from being used by the military of the Third Reich. In 1948, well after the end of the war, the new J√≥nsb√∫ Station was built in a new location south of Peters Bay, on the other side of Ardencaple Fjord by the mouth of Kildedal at . In order to differentiate the two huts, the ruin of the old station is also known as \\"Gamle Jonsbu\\" (Old Jonsbu) ‚Äîalthough the name \\"J√≥nsb√∫ Station\\" is still officially applied to it‚Äî and the new one as \\"Ny Jonsbu\\".

Her sister Anne married her third husband Sir Julius Caesar, Master of the Rolls, in April 1615.John Maclean, Letters from George Lord Carew to Sir Thomas Roe (Camden Society, London, 1860), p. 11. Lucy Russell, Countess of Bedford sent Lady Killigrew an invitation, seeing an opportunity to be a peace-maker for Sir Thomas Overbury, writing, \\"I doubt not but so well to play the umpire, as shall end Sir Thomas Overberie's quarrels, which I very much desire for both your sakes, and to witness the charity of your affectionate friend Bedford.\\"Catalogue of a Most Interesting Series of Autograph Letters, to be sold by Thomas Thorpe, part IX (London, 1836), p. 7 no. 61 (not dated). In May 1613 Robert Killigrew was caught talking to Overbury, a prisoner in the Tower of London, and sent to the Fleet Prison for a short time. He was later accused of involvement in Overbury's murder, because he had supplied white powder to his patron, the Earl of Somerset, but exonerated. At the funeral of Anne of Denmark in 1619, Lady Killigrew walked in procession with the ladies of the queen's privy chamber.John Nichols, Progesses of James the First, vol. 3 (London, 1828), p. 541. The Killigrews's circle of friends included; the poet John Donne, the philosopher Francis Bacon, the courtier Sir John Finet, the musician Nicholas Lanier, Jacques Gaultier the royal lutenist and favourite of the Marquess of Buckingham, and the artist and inventor Cornelius Drebbel.Matthew Spring, 'A Goose Among Swans', The Lute in the Netherlands in the Seventeenth Century (Cambridge Scholars, Newcastle, 2016), p. 130. She met Constantijn Huygens at her house in Lothbury in London in 1622 and they kept up a correspondence. Huygens was attracted to her, and later wrote a Latin poem mentioning her \\"snow-white throat\\" and \\"divine voice\\". This did not please Huygen's friend Dorothea van Dorp.Lisa Jardine, Temptation in the Archives (UCL: London, 2015), pp. 48-50, 74-80, p. 76.See Huygens's letters to Mary Killigrew here; 'Woodhouse, Mary', Briefwisseling van Constantijn Huygens 1607-1687, Huygens ING/ Killigrew had a house near Hampton Court, called Kineton or Kempton Park and in May 1623 the king saw the garden or \\"designment of a fine ground\\", a pretty lodge, a gracious lady (Mary Killigrew), a fair maid (probably Anne Killigrew), and the pools, deer, and heronry.John S. Brewer, Court of James the First, vol. 2 (London, 1839), p. 290-1, BL Harley 1580 p. 300. Lady Stafford Robert Killigrew died in 1633, and she later married Sir Thomas Stafford, a gentleman usher to Henrietta Maria, and was known as \\"Lady Stafford\\". A letter of February 1636 mentions a Sir Thomas Stafford at court, perhaps the usher, who was \\"piteously in love, and some times he's in hope and some times in despair, and what will be his end I know not\\".Richard Griffin Baron Braybrooke, The Private Correspondence of Jane Lady Cornwallis (London, 1842), p. 284. Lady Stafford was Constantijn Huygens's connection to the court architect Inigo Jones. When Jacob van Campen designed a new house for Huygens in The Hague, completed in 1639, he had a set of engravings made and sent a copy to Rubens. He sent another set to Lady Stafford so she could present them to Inigo Jones, with an invitation for her to see the new house and visit the court of Elizabeth Stuart, Queen of Bohemia. Huygens entrusted the package with the engravings to the English ambassador Sir William Boswell, and also involved Sir John Finet, master of ceremonies at court, to ensure Inigo Jones received the plans, which would show, \\"Vitruvius is not altogether exiled from Holland\\".Lisa Jardine, Temptation in the Archives (UCL: London, 2015), pp. 53-6. Lady Stafford was an acknowledged expert in the quality of musical instruments. Elizabeth Dudley, Countess of L√∂wenstein, a lady in waiting to Elizabeth Stuart, Queen of Bohemia, met Lady Stafford in London in 1639 and wrote to Huygens, saying that Lady Stafford often spoke of him and intended to send him a musical instrument called a theorbo.A Catalogue of an Invaluable and Highly Interesting Collection of Unpublished Manuscript Documents, Sold By Mr Sotheby, vol. 9 (London, 1825), p. 102 lot 448, now British Library Add MS 15093 ff.119-122. In 1649, unwell or uneasy about the questions, Lady Stafford would not recommend a lute that Jacques Gaultier was trying to sell to Huygens. This was a rare vintage instrument, made by Laux Maler. The family of the royal lutenist John Ballard had sold it to Charles I of England who had given it to Gaultier. Lisa Jardine suggests the sale of this lute once belonging to the deposed king may have been distasteful to Lady Stafford.Matthew Spring, 'A Goose Among Swans', The Lute in the Netherlands in the Seventeenth Century (Cambridge Scholars, Newcastle, 2016), pp. 131, 137-140: Lisa Jardine, Temptation in the Archives (UCL: London, 2015), pp. 62-3. Mary Boyle, Countess of Warwick wrote, \\"she was a cunning old woman who had been herself too much, and was too long versed in amours.\\"T. Crofton Croker, Autobiography of Lady Warwick (Percy Society, London, 1848), p. 9. Mary Boyle had lived at a house of Lady Stafford's, and her brother Francis Boyle, Lord Shannon, married Elizabeth Killigrew at Whitehall Palace in 1639.Thomas Birch, Works of The Honourable Robert Boyle, vol. 1 (London, 1744), pp. 10-11. Francis was sent to away to France after the marriage and Elizabeth and Mary Boyle were companions for a time, until Lady Stafford sent Mary Boyle to stay at her house near Hampton Court in 1641, angered by the visits of her lover Charles Rich. In August 1646 she asked Charles Louis, son of Elizabeth, Queen of Bohemia, to write to his mother asking her to take her daughter Kate Killigrew as a maid of honour in her household, and then sent Kate to The Hague with his letter of recommendation.George Bromley, A Collection of Original Royal Letters (London, 1787), pp. 135-6. Thomas Stafford died in 1655 and Lady Stafford considered moving to Maastricht or The Hague, possibly with her son Thomas Killigrew and his second wife Charlotte van Hesse. Huygens thought she would not find the conversation, pictures, performances, or music she enjoyed at Maastricht.DNBL, Briefwisseling. Deel 5: 1649-1663 (1916), pp. 245-6.

However, compared to Hamilton's original descriptions of the mahseers of trans-Himalaya, the meristic counts for the pectoral fin bear consideration. Tor barakae has 14 rays in this fin, whereas Tor putitora has 15, Tor tor has 18 and Tor mosal has 17. Distribution So far, the little research conducted on this mahseer species has all been done in the Barak River, mostly in the Indian state of Manipur. Given that this is a trans-boundary river, shared between India and Bangladesh, it may be assumed that Tor barakae is a resident of both. Wider distributions within the Brahmaputra River basin are not yet ascertained. In the Barak Bridge area where the initial studies were conducted, this fish is called 'Nung nga'. Ecology As all other mahseer species are omnivorous, it may be expected that Tor barakae is the same, with a diet that likely includes aquatic and terrestrial invertebrates, fruit and vegetation, small amphibians and other fish. It would seem probable that adult fish access headwaters for spawning during high water conditions. Conservation This species is currently assigned as Near Threatened by the IUCN. Given that the species is identified from the capture of only five specimens, and that little work has been done beyond the initial identification, the major constraining factor in any conservation strategy is the complete lack of understanding of the distribution and ecology of the species and how or if it interacts with other local mahseer species within the same habitat. With other mahseer species, the main threats are: loss of habitat due to urbanisation, encroachment on flood plains, dam building, sand extraction and pollution. Destructive fishing methods like dynamite, poisoning and electricity are in common use throughout South and Southeast Asia, and may be expected to be a major threat to the sustainability of populations. There has been some work completed on the habitat suitability and capabilities of the river system to support mahseers and other fishes . Given that the Barak River is known to be very dynamic, the plans to straighten and dredge the river for use as part of the national water highway system must raise the level of threat to these fish.

As a surgeon at the Birmingham General Hospital he was influential in the design of the new hospital in 1897 and was an active fundraiser for the project. An active supporter of the British Red Cross Society and the St John's Ambulance Brigade, he was knighted in 1905.  Early life  Chavasse was born in Wylde Green, Warwickshire, the sixth son of Thomas Chavasse (1800‚Äì1884), a surgeon with a practice in Birmingham and then in rural Warwickshire. Thomas the son began to study medicine at Queen's College, Birmingham with clinical teaching at Birmingham General Hospital. He then enrolled as an undergraduate at the University of Edinburgh Medical School. Here his teachers included Joseph Lister from whom he learned at first hand the value of antiseptic techniques in surgery. He graduated MB CM in 1876. After graduation he spent six months in Vienna attending the clinic of Theodore Billroth, who, at that time, was pioneering the surgery of the abdomen. Billroth's clinic attracted young surgeons from all over Europe and amongst Chavasse's fellow postgraduate students was an Edinburgh contemporary Dr (later Sir) George Andreas Berry. From Vienna he continued his studies at the Charit√© in Berlin under Bernhard von Langenbeck the surgeon credited with establishing scientific surgery in Germany. On return to Edinburgh he was house surgeon to Professor James Spence in the old Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh. Spence was resolutely opposed to the practice of antiseptic surgery, which meant that Chavasse had to be diplomatic about his enthusiasm for Listerian antisepsis. He furthered his knowledge of antisepsis, without offending his chief, by regularly attending Lister's Sunday afternoon clinic. In 1878 he obtained the higher degree of MD and passed the examinations to become a Fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh (FRCSEd).  Surgical career  In 1878 Chavasse applied for the post of assistant surgeon at the Birmingham General Hospital, but to be appointed he needed to present his fellowship diploma. Although he had passed the examinations he could not obtain the diploma as he had not reached the statutory age of 25. The RCSEd suspended this bylaw to enable Chavasse to receive his diploma and he was appointed to the post. He never forgot what he regarded as a great act of kindness by the College. Twenty-one years later he wrote to the then President, Sir Patrick Heron Watson expressing his thanks and donating a sum which the College used to buy the Chavasse Cup. He was appointed full surgeon in 1881 when aged only 27, an unusually senior appointment at that age. He became senior surgeon to the hospital in 1894, retiring in 1912 when he became consulting surgeon. Chavasse was influential in the design and the re-building of the hospital when it relocated to Steelhouse Lane in 1897. He helped to finance this by obtaining endowments from family and acquaintances. He was admitted to the FRCS(Eng) in 1899. Chavasse remained an ardent exponent of Listerian antisepsis throughout his career. He also acted as Consulting Surgeon at the Corbett Hospital, Stourbridge and also to the Dispensary at Sutton Coldfield. He was president of the Midland Medical Society, president of the Birmingham branch of the British Medical Association (BMA) and president of the Birmingham Medical Institute. At the meeting of the BMA in Birmingham in 1911 he was President of the Section of Surgery. He was an active supporter of the British Red Cross Society and the St John's Ambulance Brigade. Chavasse was knighted in 1905.  Death  While hunting on 13 December 1912, he fell and suffered multiple fractures of the femur. He appeared to be recovering from this but died suddenly at his home at Barnt Green, Worcestershire on 17 February 1913, probably from a pulmonary embolism.  Family  He was a member of the notable Chavasse family. His nephew Noel Chavasse (1884‚Äì1917), a doctor, was awarded the VC and Bar, and was killed at the Battle of Passchendaele.Ann Clayton, \\"Chavasse, Noel Godfrey (1884‚Äì1917)\\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004 accessed 28 August 2019 At the time of his death he was engaged to his first cousin Frances Chavasse, daughter of Frederick Chavasse. In 1885 Chavasse married Frances Hannah Ryland. Their son, Arthur Ryland Chavasse MD (1887‚Äì1916), became a Captain in the Royal Army Medical Corps and was killed in World War I. They had three daughters: Gwendoline, Frances and Esme.  Selected bibliography  *\\"Clinical remarks on amputation at the hip Joint\\".

The temple is classified as the second rank of royal temple of province alike Wat Paramaiyikawat of Ko Kret. It was build in 1849 by King Nangklao (Rama III) to dedicated to his mother (Queen Consort Sri Sulalai) and grandparents who resided in this area. He gave the name \\"Wat Chaloem Phra Kiat\\" since it was not completed. Somdet Chao Phraya Borom Maha Prayurawongse (Tish Bunnag) was a project director. The construction was not completed in the reign of King Nangklao due to his death. All construction were transferred to Prayurawongse's second son, Chaophraya Thiphakorawong (Kham Bunnag) in the reign of King Mongkut (Rama IV), construction was completed in 1858.

It was discovered by William Herschel on December 25, 1835. At a distance of 53 million light-years, it is one of the closer members of Fornax Cluster. It has a magnitude of 10.8, which makes NGC 1387 one of the brighter galaxies in the Fornax Cluster and it is 60 000 light-years across. It is only 12' from the central galaxy NGC 1399, and it makes it one of the closest galaxies to NGC 1399. NGC 1387 is an early-type galaxy with a Hubble classification of (R')SAB(s)0. It has a clear, normal-looking non-ansae type bar embedded in a very extensive envelope, which is structureless except for the bar. Observations in 2006 discovered a large nuclear ring around NGC 1387, in a bulge-subtracted 2.2 micron image. Despite their name, early-type galaxies are much older than spiral galaxies, and mostly comprise old, red-colored stars. Very little star formation occurs in these galaxies; the lack of star formation in elliptical galaxies appears to start at the center and then slowly propagates outward. This is an early-type lenticular galaxy, with similar nature to early-type elliptical galaxies. NGC 1387 is rich with globular clusters, with an estimated number of clusters of 406 ¬± 81. However, unlike similar galaxies NGC 1374 and NGC 1379, which have an almost equal number of blue and red globular clusters, NGC 1387's globular cluster system is mostly composed of red globular clusters, with only a small fraction of blue globular clusters. This may be caused by gravitational interactions with the massive central galaxy NGC 1399, which probably stripped off most of the globular clusters from NGC 1387. Globular clusters of NGC 1387, like globulars in NGC 1379 and NGC 1374, didn't show any evidences of multiple populations.

Since 2017, Labelcode is no longer mandatory. Labelcode is still used in some occasions, for example, CD publishing. Ways to get a Labelcode A label code is only issued by GVL after it has been published for the first time. However, there are several ways to get an LC. #The simplest is the way described below: Takeover of the LC of the press shop (keyword: assignment of ancillary rights). #After pressing a CD, for example, an application for an LC including a copy of the recordings is sent to GVL. After processing and issuing the LC, the GVL sends the sticker with the LC to the applicant. Only from the second production onwards can the LC be used permanently. #In consultation with the GVL, members of the Association of German Musicians (VDM) can receive their own label code via the VDM.

Usage Labelcode was created by GVL on May 1, 1976 and introduced by IFPI in 1977 in order to unmistakably identify the different record labels. The number of countries using the Labelcode is limited (it is mostly used in Germany), and the code given on the item is not always accurate to the label on which the album or single was actually released.

Background The operation was focussed on the C·ªß Chi and Tr·∫£ng B√†ng Districts of H·∫≠u Nghƒ©a Province and the Phu Hoa District of B√¨nh D∆∞∆°ng Province which were long-term Vietcong (VC) bases and supply routes. Numerous small unit actions were conducted including Bushmaster (extensive company size patrols), cordon and search of suspected VC hamlets, Roadrunner (mine sweeping of roads) and Checkmate (unannounced roadblocks to check for VC personnel or supplies being moved by surface transportation). In addition, search and destroy missions employing airmobile assaults into the Iron Triangle, and along the west side of the Saigon River south of the Iron Triangle were conducted, when intelligence reports located VC units in the area. Operation On 30 May 1st Brigade forces killed 10 VC. On 7 July northwest of Phu Cuong 1st Brigade units engaged a VC force losing 5 killed. On 13 July the VC attacked a 1st Brigade unit with Rocket-propelled grenades killing 1 US soldier. On 30 August the 4th Battalion, 9th Infantry Regiment conducted airmobile assaults against an entrenched VC battalion in the Iron Triangle. Small arms, automatic weapons, artillery and airstrikes were directed against the VC resulting in 4 VC killed while US losses were 11 killed. Operation Waimea was launched as part of the operation from 22 through 26 August. In addition to an organic battalion of the 1st Brigade, Waimea included the 4th Battalion, 12th Infantry placed under the 1st Brigade‚Äôs operational control and the Army of the Republic of Vietnam 2nd and 4th Battalions, 7th Regiment, 5th Division. The operation was conducted along the Rach Tra, from grid reference XT7507 () to the Saigon River and along the opposite bank of the Saigon River. The operation was designed to drive the VC from the area and to destroy their base camps and fortifications. Contact throughout the operation was limited, however, to engagement of VC in sampans and destruction of fortifications, many of which were booby trapped. The operation continued throughout September as a pacification operation, to which was added the security of jungle clearing operations. During 1-5 September primary emphasis was placed on platoon and company size patrols to deny VC units access to populated areas during the Presidential elections. After the elections were held jungle clearing operations were begun in the Rach Tra area. The purpose of this clearing was to eliminate foliage used by VC units for concealment when moving along the waterways flowing from the Saigon River. Clearing operations intensified with Operation Kunia, to eliminate the Ho Bo Woods as a VC base area. The operation continued as a search and destroy operation and security for jungle clearing. Aftermath The operation concluded on 7 December 1967. VC losses were 304 killed and 218 individual and 18 crew-served weapons captured for US losses of 152 killed.

It was built as a single-family home and later converted into a banquet and event facility. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1985. History Augustus Paddock was born in New York state, and later came to Michigan. He worked as a steamboat on the Grand River, and by 1865 was the manager of the Newaygo Company, a lumbering firm that established the village of Newaygo, Michigan. He became a partner in 1867. In 1872, Paddock purchased the land where Paddock Place now stands. The land had previously been owned by horticulturist Truman Kellogg, who in 1837 began cultivating apples, peaches, plums, and grapes in the area. Paddock built this house on the land in 1873 or 1874. Paddock lived there only a few years, eventually moving to Colorado. In 1879, he sold the house to Sarah Doubleday, who in turn sold it to prominent local physician Alban Botsford in 1881. It was sold again in 1884 to lumberman James M. Lane, and in 1890 to Samuel Scudder. In 1892, Melvin J. Clark and his wife, Emily, acquired the property as their residence. Clark was born in Canada and later came to Michigan, operating a shingle business, a sawmill, and later a wholesale grocery business. He was also involved in several lumber and mining companies and was a director of the Grand Rapids National Bank. The Clarks were also involved in many charitable activities, including establishing the Clark Memorial Home, the Clark Memorial Church, and helping establish the Children's Home Society. Melvin Clark died in 1909, and Emily Clark remained in the house. She made substantial additions to the building in the early 1910s, engaging architects Robinson & Campau to remodel and add a third story. She also continued to make philanthropic gifts, including funding a substantial portion of the Grand Rapids Art Museum. On her death in 1924, she willed her art collection to the museum. In the 1910s, the Clarks' daughter, Marguerite Clark Wurzburg and her husband Edmund Wurzburg, owner of the Wurzburg Department Store, moved into the Clark house with Emily. Edmund died in 1928, and Marguerite remained in the house until 1935. In 1941, the house was sold to the Franciscans, who refurbished the house and opened St. Bernadine's Friary. In 1983, the house was transformed into Gibson's Restaurant. The restaurant closed in 2005 and the house was sold to Greg Gilmore, who reopened it later that year as Mangiamo. Mangiamo closed in 2017, and the house became an events venue. Description Paddock Place is a 17,000 square foot structure with 17 rooms. The original house, constructed in 1873, is a two-story, brick veneer, Italianate structure. In 1910 and 1914, a third story with a tile roof was added, and the house was otherwise enlarged and remodeled. The house sits on a five-foot foundation of coursed gray and red cut granite. The first and second floors are faced in brick, while the third is covered with stucco. A wrap-around porch runs across the entire front facade and onto both sides. The lower floors contain round-corner windows with Eastlake rood moldings, as well as bay windows. The roof has projecting eaves, and is covered with red terra cotta tiles.

Involvement with skinhead movement  Widner became a skinhead at the age of 14, and he spent 16 years involved with racist White supremacy organizations in the midwestern United States. Described as a \\"pit bull\\", Widner co-founded Vinlanders Social Club, a white power group in Indiana that soon gained a reputation for excessive violence. This organization became one of the fastest-growing racist skinhead organizations in the US. In 2005, Widner married Julie Larsen, who had three children from a previous marriage. In 2006, the couple had a son. The responsibilities of fatherhood gave Widner the desire to reform and leave the racist movement, a desire shared by Larsen. Widner left his organization and endured years of death threats and harassment while attempting to turn his life around.  Tattoo removal  Widner's efforts to rejoin wider society were significantly hampered by his extensive facial tattoos, many of which were violent or racist. Larsen feared that Widner would take drastic action to remove the tattoos, such as immersing his face in acid. Larsen eventually contacted anti-racist activist Daryle Lamont Jenkins of One People's Project who put her in contact with the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC). After \\"several weeks of conversation,\\" SPLC representatives agreed to help Widner in his quest to remove his facial tattoos. They found a plastic surgeon who was willing to perform the procedure, and an anonymous donor provided $35,000 for the procedures. The complete removal of Widner's facial tattoos took a little over a year and a half and over a dozen individual procedures, all of which were excruciatingly painful.  Depictions  Widner is the subject of the 2011 American TV documentary Erasing Hate, and the 2018 biographical feature film Skin.

This phenomenon is essential in dedifferentiating a somatic cell to a pluripotent cell (induction of an induced pluripotent stem cell, iPSC) and also in transdifferentiating a terminally differentiated cell to another terminally differentiated cell.  Discovery  The transflamation process was first discussed by Lee et al. in 2012 in relation to the effectiveness of reprogramming somatic cells to pluripotent cells using viral and non-viral approaches. iPSC can be prepared from human fibroblast using a retroviral construct with the transcription factors Oct3/4, Sox2, c-Myc and Klf4 according to Takahashi, Yamanaka. However, these vectors are not completely safe and may accidentally integrate into cells DNA and impair the stability of the genome. This is why new methods of transmission (non- integration methods) are currently being developed. One of the available options is the transfer of small proteins or penetrating peptides across the membrane, which is safer but the yield is about 10-100x lower than viral approaches. These conclusions suggest that transcription factor transfer by the viral vector enhances reprogramming efficiency and processes that are involved in this phenomenon and affect epigenetic modifiers have been collectively referred to as transflamation.  Transflammation process  Transflammation scheme The viral vector stimulates pattern recognotion receptors (PRR): toll like receptors (TLRs) or RL-I-like receptors (RLRs), which trigger anti-inflammatory signaling of innate immunity and subsequently activate transcription factors NF-Œ∫Œ≤ and IRF3. These factors are involved in chromatin remodeling in the nucleus. The result is chromatin release and facilitating transcription factors to bind the genes. Signalling via oxygen and nitrogen radicals (ROS, NOS) enhance the inflammatory response by generating additional danger associated molecular pattern (DAMP) is also involved in successful cell reprogramming. Inducible NO synthase (iNOS) is responsible for the generation of nitrogen radicals in the cell and it is activated after binding of NF-Œ∫Œ≤ to promoter. iPSC forms oxygen radicals only in the initial phase of reprogramming. Later oxidation activity attenuates and up-regulation of antioxidant enzymes occurs. The correct timing and amount of ROS / NOS is critical to the overall efficiency of the process. A cell stimulated with poly I: C (a synthetic TLR3 receptor agonist) with low doses of poly I: C increase iPSC production but higher levels decrease IPSC. It means if the innate immune response is inhibited or the response is disproportionately large, the cell will not be reprogrammed (‚ÄûGoldilocks zone‚Äú).

Early life and education  Spear was born in Jonesboro, Indiana, the daughter of Amos Zophar Hunt and Mabel Elizabeth Ewry Hunt. She attended Peabody Elementary School, Washington D.C., followed by Eastern High School. She then studied at Strayer's Business College and George Washington University. She married Albert Austin Spear in September 1921.  Career  Spear worked as a graphic analyst for many United States Federal Government agencies between the 1920s and the 1960s, including for the Internal Revenue Service and the Bureau of Labor Statistics. She also operated her own studio for 22 years, and taught Graphic Representation of Statistics at the American University. She wrote two books, Charting Statistics in 1952 and Practical Charting Techniques in 1969, which described detailed techniques to design and create various types of statistical charts and graphs. She also explained the roles needed for successful development and presentation of charts: a graphic analyst, a draftsman, and a communicator. The same team-based approach is recommended by 21st century author and presentations expert Nancy Duarte. Spear has been recognised, by statisticians Edward Tufte and Hadley Wickham among others, as having presented the first formulation of the box plot. This was shown in Charting Statistics , which on page 166 shows a diagram of a range bar chart featuring an interquartile range box. The box plot was further developed seventeen years later by American mathematician John Tukey. Box plot nomenclature Reviewers of her first book noted approvingly Spear's inclusion of tips about presenting data in graphic form on television. Several reviewers felt that the book could have been longer, that more instructions about equipment and tools would have been useful, that the explanations were too short, and, although they were \\"thankful for a book containing many excellent illustrations, [were] regretful that author Spear did not impart more of her fund of knowledge.\\" An Italian reviewer felt it would be very successful in popularising the basic types of graphic data displays, while a French reviewer thought that economics teachers, administrators and entrepreneurs would all benefit from reading it. A review in Journal of Marketing highlighted three rules: \\"keep the presentations simple ... know your audience, know your material.\\" The Analysts Journal pointed out that, as well as being useful to those needing to create their own presentations of statistical information, it would be valuable for assessing those made by others. Spear's second book was an updated version of her first. It was also longer, although at least one reviewer still thought that parts were too short. It contained a chapter titled, \\"Cheating by Charting\\", on how not to mislead an audience, but made no reference to the growing field of plotting data by computer.

History  In 1945, there was a commemoration of the 250th anniversary of Purcell's death, raising interest in the composer. Britten began that year to arrange songs, duets and a trio by Purcell, writing out‚Äîor \\"realizing\\"‚ÄîPurcell's figured bass as an accompaniment for piano, sometimes taking great liberty with the original composition.

The Britten-Pears Foundation acquired a manuscript of one of the realizations in 2019, a version of The Blessed Virgin's Expostulation which Britten wrote for a concert at Wigmore Hall in 1945.

Every year, it offers around 100 music acts from Korea and around the world, as well as music industry delegates representing festivals and labels. In cooperation with foreign embassies, each year it offers national showcases. There are also conference events, secret shows, and various other networking events throughout the festival. There are many networking opportunities and a lot of deals get made at or because of Zandari. The 2019 edition features a Focus Wales showcase and a Music BC showcase from British Columbia, Canada. The 2015 event saw 261 acts playing in two dozen venues. The 2016 event had over 160 bands, 56 of which represented 18 foreign countries, with 163 individual concerts at 12 venues. In 2018 the number of music acts was capped at 100 and the music venues were reduced in order to improve the experience, including for the over 60 delegates. The festival coincides with Mu:Con, another Korean music showcase more closely run by the government, and foreign delegates are able to attend both. The Korean organizers in 2018 also started DMZ Peace Train Music Festival. Name Zandari is a historic name for the area. Zandari means \\"small bridge,\\" and its presence is still marked in local neighborhoods Seogyo-dong and Donggyo-dong, signifying the west and east sides of a stream that used to run through the area. Many streets and other place names take their name from Zandari, including West Bridge Live Hall which is a literal English translation of Zandari. The use of the name was intended to evoke a bridge that closes the gap between Korea and the outside world. \\"Festa\\" is a word commonly used in Korea for festival. Location The list of venues changes every year due to a high turnover rate of businesses in the area. The Hongdae area had been known as ground zero for Korea's indie music scene, but gentrification has weakened its prominence. Notable events Former Sex Pistols bassist Glen Matlock performed at Zandari 2018. In 2017, Elis Paprika became the first Mexican artist to perform at Zandari Festa, with a show at SangSang Madang. She went back to Zandari Festa in 2018, and performed at The Convent. Many Korean acts have made useful industry connections at the festival, being invited to play overseas festivals or signing record deals, including Busan's Say Sue Me and Daegu's Drinking Boys and Girls Choir. In 2013, K-pop group Crayon Pop made a surprise appearance, performing with metal band L.O.D.

Early life Bartlett was born on June 1, 1851 in Haverhill to Thomas and Patience (Hawkins) Bartlett. His father was a farmer and his ancestors included John Winthrop, Thomas Dudley, and Joseph Cilley. In 1872 he graduated from Dartmouth College. Teaching After college, Bartlett began a career as an educator. He was a master at the Academy at Sherborn in 1872 and sub-master of Haverhill High School from 1873 to 1875. He then served as master of Bradford High School until that town was annexed by Haverhill in 1882. Afterwards he returned to his former position as Haverhill High's sub-master. In 1888, Bartlett was named superintendent of Haverhill schools. He was removed from the position on June 2, 1897, when, after four years of trying, the anti-Bartlett faction on the school committee gained enough votes to prevent his reappointment. After leaving the public school system, Bartlett began writing. He was the author of an elementary school English text book as well as several books on the history of Haverhill. He also continued his work as a public official. In 1889, Bartlett was made a trustee of the Haverhill Public Library. From 1901 to 1911 he served on the city's park commission. In 1907, Bartlett donated land to the city of Haverhill upon which a school bearing his name was constructed. Politics In 1912, Bartlett was elected to the Haverhill board of Aldermen. In 1914 he was elected mayor of Haverhill. In March 1916, Bartlett refused to grant Dr. Thomas E. Leyden a permit to use City Hall for a lecture which was seen as anti-Catholic. The board of aldermen overruled Bartlett and Leyden was eventually given permission to use City Hall for his lecture. On April 3, roughly 10,000 people took to the city streets, resulting in a riot that required the deployment of the state militia. Bartlett and the board of aldermen were indicted for neglecting to suppress an unlawful assembly. They were the first to ever be charged with this crime. Bartlett was found not guilty on one count and the jury did not reach a decision on the other. In 1920, Bartlett returned to the board of aldermen, where he remained until his retirement in 1924. However, in 1931 Bartlett returned to public office as a member of the Massachusetts House of Representatives. He represented the 2nd Essex district until his death on May 14, 1934.

The company‚Äôs projects have received awards the World Architecture Festival in 2008. and at the Venice Biennale of Architecture in 2004, 2006 and 2012.

Europaviertel district ‚Äì terraced house, perimeter block development, slim high-rise (2016). New Henninger Turm during the design process (2017).  History  Since it was first founded in Frankfurt in 1997 the office has been managed by its three partners Claudia Meixner, Florian Schl√ºter and Martin Wendt. With its early, somewhat smaller projects the firm already elicited great interest among the specialist media. Today, its work ranges from exhibition design, architectural planning and design in the urban context, industrial buildings, schools, churches, cultural and residential buildings, all the way to residential high-rises. In parallel, Claudia Meixner and Florian Schl√ºter hold lectures at various organizations and have also taught at the university level.  Architecture  Very diverse in formal terms, the buildings by Meixner Schl√ºter Wendt have two basic things in common: They leave a very strong sculptural impression on viewers and they react to their contexts with sensitivity. Meixner Schl√ºter Wendt resolves this apparent conflict by using methods, principles, and strategies which are ‚Äì according to design expert Lilli Hollein ‚Äì established practice in the world of visual arts but, by contrast, rather unusual for German architecture firms. One common practice at the practice is to play calculated games with levels of perception. To this end, in their design process, the architects evoke specific associations with what is particular to a certain location and the relevant construction brief, associations which are the result of observing and analyzing everyday things or rather the way they are arranged. This can, for instance, include recourse to conventional building typologies and to well-known techniques from the history of construction, such as the kind of encrustations or reliefs which Meixner Schl√ºter Wendt sees as intellectual ready-mades, something which they can reinterpret and transform into buildings of a completely new kind. As a reaction to the differing heights of the surroundings in Frankfurt‚Äôs Europaviertel, for the Axis project, for instance, the architects combined a slim high-rise, a multistory building and a row of terraced houses to form a ‚Äúperimeter block high-rise‚Äù. In the case of the ‚ÄúSchmuck‚Äù detached family residence in Frankfurt‚Äôs Westend district, by contrast, the firm transformed the typologies that are the ‚ÄúHofreite‚Äù (a kind of courtyard ensemble), the patio house and the villa into a more complex ‚Äúliving space sculpture‚Äù, including in the process the connecting walls of the neighboring buildings. To use another example, in 2003, a pontoon served as the inspiration for the Caf√© des Licht- und Luftbades (Light and Air Bath Caf√©) on the banks of the flood-prone river Main in Frankfurt‚Äôs Niederrad district, the kind of ship-like construction that will float if there is flooding. In the case of the partial dismantlement of the Dornbuschkirche, the church in the eponymous district of Dornbusch, Meixner Schl√ºter Wendt reproduced what used to be the nave of the church in a new relief wall, thus preserving people‚Äôs memories of the demolished section of the structure in the form of an impression in the new architecture. For the reinterpretation of the Henniger Turm, which was knocked down in 2013, the firm also reacted to collective memories. Whereas both the contours and the side facing the city are strongly reminiscent of the original appearance of the old silo, the three other sides indicate the new building‚Äôs function as a residential tower.

When the Korps Mariner was founded in 1665, special drummer units had been attached to marine battalions, with the sole purpose of indicating the rhythm while marching. Around 1699, fifes were also added, which would give the entire unit a resemblance to a British Corps of Drums. During its 1864 establishment, the corps of drums was expanded to become a full wind band. It was dissolved in 1940 due to the involvement of the Netherlands in World War II and the Battle of the Netherlands. Today, it supports all marine and national events, including Koningsdag, Prinsjesdag, Veteranendag and Dutch Armed Forces Day as well as service days for the marines such as 10 December and 1 August.
