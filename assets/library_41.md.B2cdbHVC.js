History  Edinburgh has a history of providing free medical care to the poor. In first meeting of the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh, in 1681, the Fellows drew up a scheme to provide free medical care for the poor of Edinburgh. By the eighteenth century, Edinburgh remained overcrowded, disease-ridden, and overflowing with the poor. In 1705, the Fellows at the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh unanimously agreed to continue providing medical aid for the poor by two Fellows per year at their new premises in Fountain Close. This \\"Dispensary\\" service continued at Fountain Close until 1729 when it transferred to the new \\"Physicians’ Hospital or Infirmary for the Sick and Poor.\\" A Dispensary for the Infant Poor had already been established in London in 1769, although it did not survive, and the idea expanded. By 1776, Dispensaries had been established across England. Edinburgh's public dispensary was founded in 1776 by Andrew Duncan and provided the impoverished in the city with free medical advice. It opened in West Richmond Street in 1783. The Dispensary was established and financed as a public charity from the beginning and was an extension of Duncan's teaching program. Patients attending the Dispensary received free medicines and advice and in return agreed to be demonstrations in Duncan's classes. In June 1815, William Pulteney Alison and other Fellows of the Royal Public Dispensary of Edinburgh founded another public dispensary in Edinburgh's New Town. Alison felt a second dispensary was justified to meet the demands of the city's poor. The Royal Dispensary was only open two days a week and had no established system for home visiting. It received a royal charter on 13 January 1818, becoming the Royal Public Dispensary of Edinburgh. The trustees of the Royal Dispensary donated their building at West Richmond Street and its remaining funds to the University of Edinburgh in 1963. The University refurbished the building and renamed it the Mackenzie Medical Centre, after Sir James Mackenzie, a general practitioner. The Royal Dispensary also endowed the first Chair of General Practice in the world, at the University of Edinburgh, to which Richard Scott was appointed later that year.

The Vakarel Transmitter was inaugurated in 1937. It had one directional antenna consisting of three guyed masts and another consisting of two masts. The most remarkable mast of the Vakarel Transmitter was the 215 metre tall Pictures and description in Bulgarian (Predavatel.com)70 years of Bulgarian national radio Blaw-Knox tower, built in 1937 by the company Telefunken. Along with Lakihegy Tower, Hungary, Riga LVRTC Transmitter, Latvia and Lisnagarvey Radio Mast, Northern Ireland it was one of the few Blaw-Knox towers in Europe until its demolition on 16 September 2020. The transmitter was shut down at 22:00 UTC on 31 December 2014.  Transmitter internal structure  The modulation metod used by the transmitter in Vakarel is called a tube voltage modulation and was successfully used in all powerful AM transmitters at that time. The Vakarel transmitter is supplied with electricity from a substation in Samokov via a medium voltage transmission line. The transmitter uses six stages of amplification. The first stage contains a single radio tube, which generates alternating current at a carrier frequency of 850 kHz. The electrical oscillations of the anode circuit in the tube are coupled in series to the second and third stage. The signals in these three stages are only amplified, without any other changes. In the special fourth modulation stage, the form of signals is modulated with speech or music. The audio recordings are send to the transmitter with an underground communication cable from the main radio studio in Sofia. Due to the large distance of almost 36 km, the audio signal is amplified at both ends by separate blocks of amplifiers. The fifth stage consists of six transmitting tubes, two of which are in reserve, and four others can be switched on, if necessary. All of them are water-cooled. The final sixth stage consists of four high-power transmitting tubes amplifying the final output up to 100 kW. The energy is filtered by a high-power tuned circuit and sent to the feeder of the antenna, which is mounted on a large insulator on the ground and suspended with four guy lines with strain insulators.

It was originally planned through the 1960s and 1970s. Route description The highway was to begin from a connection with the Kennedy Expressway and Edens Expressway (I-90 and I-94) near Montrose Avenue on the city's Northwest Side. It was to follow an alignment parallel, and adjacent to the Belt Railway of Chicago, approximately one-half mile east of Cicero Avenue and extend southerly over railroad right- of-way through the West Side of Chicago, and across the Sanitary and Ship Canal to a connection with the Stevenson Expressway (I-55). South of this confluence, the route would continue south in a reverse direction, split- arrangement with the northbound highway lanes depressed along Cicero Avenue and the southbound lanes depressed along the Belt Railway of Chicago tracks. Continuing south past the proposed traffic interchange at Chicago Midway International Airport, the expressway alignment was to turn southeasterly at 67th Street and continue over Belt Railway right-of-way to Lawndale Avenue then turn easterly towards the Dan Ryan Expressway along Norfolk Southern Railway right-of-way (now Metra-South West Service) and 75th Street to an interchange with the Dan Ryan Expressway (I-94) north of 91st Street. Extra lanes were planned to extend north from the proposed Dan Ryan/Crosstown interchange to connect with the Chicago Skyway (I-90) near 66th and State Streets. The I-494 number was originally to be used for a freeway upgrade of Lake Shore Drive that was also cancelled; when the Crosstown Expressway inherited that number, the LSD proposal was then renumbered to I-694. History The origins of the Crosstown Expressway can be found in Burnham and Bennett's 1909 Plan of Chicago, which proposed a grand circumferential road to divert traffic around central Chicago. The route was incorporated in the Chicago Plan Commission's plans for post-war highway construction. The Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1956 spurred extensive construction around Chicago, but by 1960, the Crosstown Expressway was the only route included in the region's postwar transportation plans yet to break ground. The State of Illinois, Cook County, and City of Chicago formed the Crosstown Expressway Task Force in 1963. According to then Chicago Commissioner for Public Works, Milton Pikarsky, the task force aimed \\"to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed expressway... in sufficient detail so that the need for an expressway could not be challenged\\". Public resentment over the experience of highway construction in the late 1950s and early 1960s, however, prompted a comprehensive re-evaluation of the Crosstown route. = Cancellation = On February 25, 1967, the federal government proposed the Crosstown Expressway be redesigned as a \\"total development concept\\" that would integrate mass transit, high-rise apartment buildings, commercial and industrial zones, and green space. Mayor of Chicago Richard J. Daley stated the road would be \\"the most modern and beautiful expressway in the nation\\". By 1972, the Crosstown Expressway had emerged as the national testing ground for a new kind of urban expressway centered upon neighborhood integration rather than regional development. Community groups strongly opposed these plans; notably the Citizens Action Program (CAP) and the Anti-Crosstown Action Committee, who turned the proposed expressway into a pivotal issue in the 1972 local, state, and federal elections. Dan Walker, an independent Democrat defeated incumbent Illinois Governor Richard Ogilvie 51% to 49% on a strong anti-Crosstown platform. Governor Walker appeared at the 1973 CAP annual convention to declare the Crosstown Expressway will not be built. Political wrangling over the Crosstown Expressway continued between Walker and Daley until the latter's death in December 1976. Changing public opinion on urban highway construction, the mid-1970s energy crisis, and rapidly escalating costs (from the total development concept additions and runaway inflation rates) ultimately undermined the expressway. Restructured proposals for the southern leg of the Crosstown route were agreed by Mayor Michael Bilandic and Governor James R. Thompson in March 1977. However, in January 1979, the Crosstown Expressway project was finally cancelled by then-Mayor Jane M. Byrne and Governor Thompson. In the $1.916 billion in federal funds earmarked for the Crosstown Expressway and (never-built) Franklin Line Subway were then reallocated to Chicago's struggling regional transit agencies, and to other pressing road improvements across northeastern Illinois. These funds would eventually support the extension of the Blue Line to O'Hare International Airport and the construction of the Orange Line to Midway Airport. = Revival attempts = In 2001, Mayor Richard M. Daley announced plans for a Mid-City Transitway, using the alignment of the Chicago Belt Line Railway that the Crosstown Expressway route was to have followed. The Mid-City project was placed in the Chicago Area Transportation Study's Destination 2020: Regional Transportation Plan and still awaits study and approval. Proposals for a Circle Line providing circumferential transit options closer to the Loop have been prioritized over investment in the Transitway project by city officials and the Chicago Metropolitan Agency for Planning (CMAP). On February 21, 2007, Illinois House of Representatives Speaker Michael Madigan proposed legislation that would make a future Crosstown Expressway a part of the Illinois State Toll Highway Authority (ISTHA). However, the proposal was not previously looked at by the office of the mayor, governor, ISTHA or the Illinois Department of Transportation.

The location, at the north end of the city, overlooked the park that would soon house City Hall. French architect Marc Isambard Brunel collaborated with fellow émigré Joseph-François Mangin and his brother Charles on the design of the building in the 1790s. Construction costs mounted to precipitous levels, and changes were made in the design; the resulting theatre had a rather plain exterior. The doors opened in January 1798. In its early years, the Park enjoyed little to no competition in New York City. Nevertheless, it rarely made a profit for its owners or managers, prompting them to sell it in 1805. Under the management of Stephen Price and Edmund Simpson in the 1810s and 1820s, the Park enjoyed its most successful period. Price and Simpson initiated a star system by importing English talent and providing the theatre a veneer of upper-class respectability. Rivals such as the Chatham Garden and Bowery theatres appeared in the 1820s, and the Park had to adapt to survive. Blackface acts and melodrama squeezed Italian opera and English drama out of their preferential positions. Nevertheless, the theatre maintained its upscale image until it burned down in 1848. Construction Architectural rendering of the Park Theatre. The design had to be abandoned during construction due to budget constraints. In the late 18th century, New York's only playhouse was the decaying and increasingly low-brow John Street Theatre. Tired of attending such an establishment, a group of wealthy New Yorkers began planning the construction of a new playhouse in 1795.Barnham:839 Investors bought 113 shares at $375 each to cover the estimated $42,375 cost. To plan the structure, the owners hired celebrated architect Marc Isambard Brunel, a Frenchman who had fled to New York to avoid the Reign of Terror and was then the city's engineer. Part way through construction, however, the project ran out of money. The owners sold more shares for what would eventually mount to a construction cost of more than $130,000.Nagler:522-4 As a cost-saving measure, Brunel's exterior design for the building was not implemented. The resulting three-story structure measured wide by deep and was made of plain dressed stone. The overall effect was an air of austerity.Nagler:522-4 The interiors, on the other hand, were quite lavish. The building followed the traditional European style of placing a gallery over three tiers of boxes, which overlooked the U-shaped pit.Barnham:839 Early management The section of Manhattan where the theatre stood was not stylish: the New Theatre, as it was called, was neighbor to Bridewell Prison, a tent city's worth of squatters, and the local poorhouse.Henderson:49-52 Lewis Hallam, Jr., and John Hodgkinson, both members of the John Street Theatre company, obtained the building's lease. They hired remnants of the Colonial Old American Company to form the nucleus of the theatre's in-house troupe and thus give the establishment the sheen of tradition and American culture.Bank:115 Meanwhile, the men quarreled, and construction continued languorously. The theatre finally held its first performance on January 29, 1798, despite still being under construction. The gross was an impressive $1,232, and, according to theatre historian T. Allston Brown, hundreds of potential patrons had to be turned away.Brown:12 Interior of the Park Theatre New York newspapers generally praised the New Theatre: > On Monday evening last, the New Theatre was opened to the most overflowing > house that was ever witnessed in this city. Though the Commissioners have > been constrained to open it in an unfinished state, it still gave high > satisfaction. The essential requisites of hearing and seeing have been > happily attained. We do not remember to have been in any Theatre where the > view of the stage is so complete from all parts of the house, or where the > actors are heard with such distinctness. The house is made to contain about > 2,000 persons. The audience part, though wanting in those brilliant > decorations which the artists have designed for it, yet exhibited a neatness > and simplicity which were highly agreeable. The stage was everything that > could be wished. The scenery was executed in a most masterly style. The > extensiveness of the scale upon which the scenes are executed, the > correctness of the designs, and the elegance of the painting, presented the > most beautiful views which the imagination can conceive. The scenery was of > itself worth a visit to the theatre.The Daily Advertiser and the Commercial > Advertiser, 31 Jan 1798, quoted in Nagler:423 The theatre offered performances on Mondays, Wednesdays, Fridays, and Saturdays. William Dunlap eventually joined the management team. Hallam parted mid-season, and Hodgkinson waited for season's end before doing the same. Dunlap remained as sole proprietor; his expenses were so great that he had to make at least $1,200 per week to break even.Nagler:524 He left in 1805 after declaring bankruptcy. After a few more failed managers, the owners sold the theatre to John Jacob Astor and John Beekman in 1805. These men kept it until its demolition in 1848.Nagler:522 The Park as high culture Over three months in 1807, English-born architect John Joseph Holland remodeled the theatre's interior. He added gas lighting, coffee rooms, roomier boxes, and a repainted ceiling. After acquiring a controlling interest in the theatre, Stephen Price became manager in 1808. He instituted a star system, whereby he paid English actors and actresses to play English dramas there. Price spent much time in England, including four years (1826–1830) as manager of the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, where he recruited successful actors for the Park and for a circuit of theatres in other American cities. During this period, Price left much of the operating management of the theatre to Edmund Simpson. The Park at this point was already known for high-class entertainments, but Price and Simpson's policies helped to reinforce this as they booked English drama, Italian opera, and other upper-class bills, such as actress Clara Fisher. Price and Simpson also fostered the careers of many American performers, including Edwin Forrest and Charlotte Cushman. The Park burned down in May 1820, and was entirely destroyed except for its exterior walls. The owners rebuilt the following year, and reopened in September 1821. The Park Theatre c. late 1820s. The theatre had been rebuilt after burning down in 1820. Neighboring buildings include the City Coffee House, Sweeney's Porter House, the Theatre Hotel, and other commercial establishments. In the early 1820s, the New Theatre was New York's only theatre, and the lack of competition allowed the theatre to enjoy its most profitable period.Henderson:51 The Chatham Garden Theatre was built in 1823 and provided the first real challenge to the Park's primacy; the Bowery Theatre followed in 1826. The New Theatre, having lost its newness, became known as the Park Theatre around this time. At first, each of the rivals aimed for the same upper-class audience. However, by the late 1820s and early 1830s, the Bowery and Chatham Garden had begun to cater to a more working-class clientele. In comparison, the Park became the theatre of choice for bon ton.Henderson:49 This was helped by the evolution of its neighborhood. New York home owners had steadily moved northward from Bowling Green so that by this point, the Park stood in an upper-class residential area and fronted City Hall and a large park.Henderson:50 Coffeehouses and hotels soon followed. Despite its upper- class luster, however, some commentators found due cause to criticize the Park. In her landmark book, Domestic Manners of the Americans, the British writer Frances Trollope gave a mixed review: > The piece was extremely well got up, and on this occasion we saw the Park > Theatre to advantage, for it was filled with well-dressed company; but still > we saw many 'yet unrazored lips' polluted with the grim tinge of hateful > tobacco, and heard, without ceasing, the spitting, which of course is its > consequence. If their theaters had the orchestra of the Feydeau, and a choir > of angels to boot, I could find but little pleasure, so long as they were > followed by this running accompaniment of thorough base.Trollope:263-4; > emphasis in original Final years Another view, ca. 1831. By the late 1830s, blackface acts and Bowery-style melodrama had come to eclipse traditional drama in popularity for New York audiences. Simpson adapted, booking more novelty acts and entertainments that emphasized spectacle over high culture.Henderson:51 The patronage changed, as well, as the New York Herald noted: > On Friday night the Park Theatre contained 83 of the most profligate and > abandoned women that ever disgraced humanity; they entered in the same door, > and for a time mixed indiscriminately with 63 virtuous and respectable > ladies. ... Men of New York, take not your wives and daughters to the Park > Theatre, until Mr. Simpson pays some respect to them by constructing a > separate entrance for the abandoned of the sex.\\"Morning Herald: ...\\" Nevertheless, the theatre's traditional patronage continued to support it, and the Park largely maintained its high-class reputation.Henderson:52 Edgar Allan Poe wrote a more critical editorial in the Broadway Journal: > The well-trained company of rats at the Park Theatre understand, it is said, > their cue perfectly. It is worth the price of admission to see their > performance. By long training they know precisely the time when the curtain > rises, and the exact degree in which the audience is spellbound by what is > going on. At the sound of the bell [signaling the start of the show] they > sally out; scouring the pit for chance peanuts and orange-peel. When, by the > rhyming couplets, they are made aware that the curtain is about to fall, > they disappear—through the intensity of the performers. A profitable > engagement might be made, we think, with \\"the celebrated Dog Bill\\" [part of > William Cole's act in P. T. Barnum's American Museum].Poe's Broadway > Journal, 1 November 1845, quoted in Poe:454 The Park Theatre was finally destroyed by fire on December 16, 1848. The Astor family opted not to rebuild it, the more fashionable clientele having moved north to Washington Square and Fifth Avenue; instead they had stores constructed on the site.

In plants, the entrance portal for mineral uptake is usually through the roots. Some mineral ions diffuse in-between the cells. In contrast to water, some minerals are actively taken up by plant cells. Mineral nutrient concentration in roots may be 10,000 times more than in surrounding soil. During transport throughout a plant, minerals can exit xylem and enter cells that require them. Mineral ions cross plasma membranes by a chemiosmotic mechanism. Plants absorb minerals in ionic form: nitrate (NO3−), phosphate (HPO4−) and potassium ions (K+); all have difficulty crossing a charged plasma membrane. It has long been known plants expend energy to actively take up and concentrate mineral ions. Proton pump hydrolyzes adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to transport H+ ions out of cell; this sets up an electrochemical gradient that causes positive ions to flow into cells. Negative ions are carried across the plasma membrane in conjunction with H+ ions as H+ ions diffuse down their concentration gradient.

Agar has a BA from the University of Auckland, an MA from the Victoria University of Wellington, and a PhD from the Australian National University. He has been teaching at Victoria since 1996.  Work on human enhancement  Agar has written extensively on the debate about human enhancement. His first significant contribution was the 2004 book Liberal Eugenics: In Defence of Human Enhancement. In the state-sponsored eugenics defended by the followers of Francis Galton individuals would defer to the state and its experts empowered to impose on all a centrally-determined conception of the good life. Agar argued that a vigorous defense of procreative freedom could turn the morally misguided authoritarian eugenics into a morally defensible liberal eugenics. Agar would encourage prospective parents to consult their own conceptions of the good life to choose some of their children's characteristics. A liberal state should ban choices judged injurious to children's well-being. It would exercise the same kinds of control over harmful genetic choices that it currently does over choices about how to raise children. Later work clarified Agar's philosophical focus on enhancement. The 2010 book Humanity's End argued against the doctrine of radical enhancement sometimes identified with the transhumanist movement. Agar claims that enhancement is a good thing that it is nevertheless possible to overdo. He advances a species-relativist view about the value of human experiences and achievements. Viewed from the perspective of our species- relativist preference a little enhancement goes a long way. Humanity's End was a 2011 Choice Magazine Outstanding Academic Title. In his 2013 book Truly Human Enhancement Agar presented too much enhancement as an instance of transformative change. Agar defines transformative change as altering \\"the state of an individual's mental or physical characteristics in a way that causes and warrants a significant change in how that individual evaluates a wide range of their own experiences, beliefs, or achievements.\\" He uses examples from the movie Invasion of the Body Snatchers to make the case that there are transformative changes that we correctly predict we will endorse once we have undergone them but that conflict with our prudential values. The central characters in the body snatchers movies resist snatching by the aliens even if they expect to be content about this change once they have undergone it. We may predict that we will enjoy life as a radically enhanced being but nevertheless be justified in rejecting it.  Work on technological change  The 2015 book The Sceptical Optimist: Why Technology Isn't the Answer to Everything was a departure from Agar's focus on the debate about human enhancement. Agar challenges the techno-optimist view that expects great things from technological progress for human flourishing. He describes a phenomenon called hedonic normalization that leads us to significantly overestimate the power of technological progress to improve our well-being. We overlook hedonic normalization when we suppose that because we would be unhappy to find ourselves permanently transported back in time to the middle ages that people living back them must have been miserable too. The same distortions apply when we imagine a future with cures for cancer and colonies on Mars. Technological progress may make us happier but not nearly so much as we imagine it. This has implications for our collective prioritization of technological progress. In a 2019 book How to be Human in the Digital Economy Agar continues his defense of human values and experiences. Agar responds to the challenge from automation and artificial intelligence to human work and agency. Agar argues for a hybrid social-digital economy. The key value of the digital economy is efficiency. The key value of the social economy is humanness. A social economy would be centered on connections between human minds. We should reject some digital automation because machines will always be poor substitutes for humans in roles that involve direct contact with other humans. A machine can count out pills and pour out coffee, but we want our nurses and baristas to have minds like ours. In a hybrid social-digital economy, people do the jobs for which feelings matter and machines take on data-intensive work. But humans will have to insist on their relevance in a digital age.

Early life Hall was born in 1781 in Portland, Maine. He worked in his father's tannery until setting up his own woodworking and boat building shop in 1810 where he tinkered with guns in his spare time. He had taken an interest in firearms during militia service and focused on increasing the rapidity of loading.Rose, Alexander American Rifleman (March 2009) pp.51-83 Career On May 21, 1811, Hall patented a single shot, breech-loading rifle in collusion with Washington, D.C. architect Dr. William Thornton.Smith, Merritt Roe. \\"John H. Hall, Simeon North, and the Milling Machine: The Nature of Innovation among Antebellum Arms Makers.\\" Technology and Culture. 4th ed. Vol. 14. Johns Hopkins UP, 1973. 573-91. JSTOR. Web. 1 Dec. 2010 He began manufacturing his new rifles at the rate of 50 per year until the Ordnance Corps (United States Army) ordered 200 rifles in December 1814. He regretfully turned down the contract because he was unable to meet the Army delivery deadline of 1815. Hall recognized individually fitted parts as the factor slowing rifle production and adapted his breech-loading design to the “uniformity principle,” widely known as interchangeable parts. Hall proposed the concept of interchangeable parts to the Army in June 1816 and earned a contract for 1,000 of the \\"Model of 1819\\" Hall rifles from the War Department with interchangeable parts being the chief condition. To fulfill it, Hall spent more than five years (and $150,000 of government funds) at Harpers Ferry Arsenal, where he occupied an old sawmill on a small island in the Shenandoah River called Virginius Island. Hall's methods were novel for the time. Hall transferred water power through a system of leather belts and pulleys to power his machines with unusual pace, greater than 3,000 revolutions per minute with efficiency, while most artisans used hand cutters and files. Like his contemporary Simeon North, Hall began using this mill power to run machine tools and achieve the dimension controls necessary for interchangeable parts. He employed metal-cutting machines attached with cutters and saws in the place of the standard heavy labor, made from cast-iron frames to ensure structural integrity and minimize vibrations from the mill’s belts.Gordon, Robert B. \\"Simeon North, John Hall, and Mechanized Manufacturing.\\" Technology and Culture. 1st ed. Vol. 30. Johns Hopkins UP, 1989. 179-88. JSTOR. Web. 1 Dec. 2010 These machine-cut surfaces would then be hand filed to ensure fit and interchangeability, verified by a gauging system Hall had designed. =M1819 Hall rifles= Hall's contract for 1,000 rifles was completed in 1825. When a three-man committee deployed by the US Ordnance Department to verify Hall’s process in fulfilling his rifle contract visited Harpers Ferry, they were floored by his results, and especially the machines. They lauded Hall’s “system, in the manufacture of small arms, [as] entirely novel,” and one which could yield “the most beneficial results to the Country, especially, if carried into effect on a large scale”. A trial was devised to test the rate of fire of Hall's breech-loading rifles in comparison to muzzle-loading rifles and Army-issue muzzle-loading muskets. A company of 38 men were given 10 minutes to load and fire at targets 100 yards distant. The company scored 164 hits (35% of the 464 shots fired) with conventional muzzle-loading rifles and 208 hits (25% of the 845 shots fired) with the faster loading, but less accurate, army-issue smooth-bore muskets in comparison to 430 hits (36% of the 1198 shots fired) with Hall's rifles. Hall's rifle works design worked so well as that it had to undergo only minimal changes through the end of the Model 1819’s run in 1853. By 1842, 23,500 rifles and 13,682 Hall-North carbines had been produced, most at Harper's Ferry, earning Hall nearly $40,000 in royalty and patent-licensing fees. Despite a significant increase in rate of fire over muzzle-loading rifles and muskets, Hall's rifle design suffered from a gas leak around the interface of the removable chamber and the bore, resulting in the necessity of a heavier powder charge that still produced much less muzzle velocity than its muzzle-loading competition. No serious efforts were made to develop a seal to reduce the loss of gas from the breech. The penetrating ability of its .52-caliber ball for the rifle was only one-third of that of the muzzle-loaders, and the muzzle velocity of the carbine was 25 percent lower than that of the Jenks carbine, despite having similar barrel lengths and identical 70-grain powder charges. Hall worked at Harper's Ferry until 1840 and died February 26, 1841, in Randolph County, Missouri.Smith, Merritt Roe, \\"Harpers Ferry Armory and the New Technology: The Challenge of Change\\" Ithaca, NY: Cornell University Press, page 218 Legacy Hall's cutting machines were designed for simplicity, to the point that “activity [was] more necessary than judgment” and young boys or “common hands” could successfully run them. They both “functioned without any manual guidance but evidently ceased operation once the workpiece had been finished,” allowing the worker to operate several at once. Hall himself even claimed “one boy by the aid of these machines can perform more work than ten men with files, in the same time, and with greater accuracy”. Hall's innovations in construction, tools, controls, stops, and gauges all were advances in milling iron and machine tools. Together with Simeon North and other armorers, Hall contributed to the adoption of interchangeable parts and the American System as a whole. The men who had learned Hall's methods of interchangeable parts while working at Harper's Ferry went on to apply those methods to production of shoes, watches, clocks, bicycles, clothing, rubber goods, and, later, automobiles. Hall's methods transformed the United States from an economy of workshop craftsmen to a nation of industrialized mass production.

Its entire history is representative of many Greek companies who were engaged in the construction of simple utility vehicles.  Evolution of the Greek three-wheel truck  The first transformations of motorcycles into \\"trucks\\" in the country probably took place in the early 1940s by workshops in Athens, when Greece was still under occupation by the Axis powers. Immediately after the war, many British (Norton, BSA), Italian (Moto Guzzi), and mostly German (Zundapp, BMW) motorcycles were left, along with destroyed U.S. Willys and other military vehicles. Involving a lot of engineering ingenuity, parts from different vehicles were joined together into contraptions being half-motorcycles, half- trucks, with remarkably efficient results. Soon, there was \\"production\\", with parts being more or less standardized. Progressively motorcycle parts were replaced by automobile parts, power most frequently being provided by Volkswagen air-cooled engines. By the late 1950s this process started evolving into complete development of three-wheeler trucks that had nothing to do with motorcycles anymore (according to Greek law, though, three-wheelers did not fall into the same tax and other categories as four-wheeler automobiles). STYL KAR is considered a pioneering company in the development of the Greek three- wheeler truck technology, adopted by other companies. It is also one of the few that evolved into a real industrial corporation.  The Styl Kar Story  Stylianos Karakatsanis started business in Thessaloniki after World War II repairing and selling ex-military motorcycles, and, soon transforming them into light trucks. During the 1950s he produced entire vehicles and by 1959 STYL KAR's first \\"classic\\" three-wheeler trucks were produced. In 1965 it moved to Athens, and new, more advanced designs were introduced. During the military dictatorship in Greece (1967–1974) laws for type certification were made more flexible, while three-wheelers enjoyed a favorable tax treatment. That resulted in the development of the industry, with companies like STYL KAR, Alta, Ros, Apollon, Babis, Marz, SAM, MotorCar, Atlas, Motoemil, Pan-Car, Dinap, BIOMOT, Super Car, Mastraggelis, Simos, ETFA, Fall-Car, Ilion and others multiplying production, making this kind of vehicle common throughout the country (especially the smaller companies often used rebuilt engines and other parts). STYL KAR built a new, larger factory in 1967 and soon its most successful model, the 1300 (with Volkswagen air-cooled engine) was introduced. The company produced thousands of three-wheeler trucks, while in 1970 it developed a two-tonne four-wheel truck to replace the three-wheelers that were by that time becoming less appealing to the Greeks; this model, however, never reached production. Around the same time it developed a light sports car and worked on building a whole new factory in Thiva to produce it. However, a huge debt \\"discovered\\" by tax auditors (the company disputed it, claiming that it was due to an erroneous categorization of its activity) gave the final blow to a company that had progressively lost its basic market. All plans were abandoned and STYL KAR, the company that pioneered perhaps the most characteristic Greek vehicle, went out of business altogether.

The stadium was in its heyday in the first half of the 20th Century, but has been in decline since 1961. It was here, where in 1947 the Czechoslovak national team won the Ice Hockey World Championship for the first time. Early days Czech national hockey teams at first had to win five European titles, before players finally saw their first stadium with artificial ice rink. The stadium was built in the early 1930s and was entirely made of wood. On 17 January 1931, the first hockey match on the synthetic ice was played. After this, Štvanice stadium became the Ice skating centre of Prague for 30 years and countless numbers of hockey-players and figure skaters were brought up there. The Štvanice stadium hosted four Ice Hockey World Championships. The Czechoslovak ice hockey team won a medal on each occasion: * 1933 (bronze) * 1938 (bronze) * 1947 (gold) * 1959 (bronze). The next important date for the Stadium was 11 February 1955. The first televised hockey match was broadcast on this day. Decline of Štvanice Arena In 1961 a new arena at the fairground became home to HC Sparta Prague, although they continued to play there occasionally when booking conflicts arose. Subsequently, the rink at Štvanice started to grow old and waste away. Only regional ice hockey and public skating kept it alive. After several years the stadium had to be closed due to poor repair. As late as 1998, civil association APeX CLUB carried out repairs and Štvanice stadium was reopened. It was open for public skating and hockey returned. In 2000 Štvanice Arena was proclaimed a national cultural monument and was protected by the state. But it was not a happy ending. In Summer 2002, Prague was hit by catastrophic flood and a big part of the stadium was damaged. Sadly, not even the Czech Ice Hockey Association was able to help. Only thanks to APeX CLUB was it reopened in October of that year. In 2008 the city denounce contract to tenants due to not meeting contractual obligations to care.

Later, Joe's brother Adrian joined the business, and eventually bought the restaurant from Joe. In 1948, Mrs. Van's Restaurant at 214 North Linn Street came up for sale and was bought by another brother, Fritz, and his wife, Fran, which would become known as the Hamburg Inn No. 2. Adrian and Fritz formed a partnership and over the years developed several restaurants, the Hamburg Inns No. 1 and No. 2, the Big Ten Inn on Riverside Drive and the Airport Inn in Iowa City. They also had the Hamburg Inn No. 3 in Cedar Rapids on Center Point Road. Hamburg Inn No. 2 is the only location remaining of the three. Dave Panther, Fritz and Fran's son, bought the restaurant in 1979 from his parents and continued the tradition. In 2016 the diner was purchased by Michael Lee, who announced plans to expand the diner into a chain, with locations across the Midwest and in China. Food and drink The \\"Burg\\" has also been widely acclaimed as one of the best \\"greasy spoons\\" in Iowa. It serves breakfast all day long, and serves a wide variety of omelettes sided by homefries. One of the more famous Hamburg Inn concoctions is the \\"pie shake\\", a milkshake made by blending soft serve ice cream, milk, and a slice of cake or pie. Iowa Caucuses During the Iowa Caucuses, candidates seeking the presidential nomination of their party frequently meet caucus-goers at the Hamburg Inn.

He became chief executive officer of the bank Christiania Bank og Kredittkasse in 1920, and from 1930 he chaired the Norwegian Bankers' Association. He was also known for raising his godson Harald Damsleth, a later Nazi artist. Sandberg still held his offices in 1940, when the occupation of Norway by Nazi Germany started. On 25 September 1940, when Josef Terboven assumed full power in the country, Sandberg was named as Minister of Finance. The Norwegian Fascist party Nasjonal Samling had some influence in naming the cabinet ministers, but Sandberg was one of the non-political cabinet members (together with Sigurd Johannessen and Øystein Ravner) as demanded by Reichskommissariat Norwegen. Sandberg was persuaded to join the cabinet, and later supported in daily affairs, by Reichskommissariat since he wanted to limit the cabinet's financial spendings, especially that of the Ministry of the Interior. At the same time Sandberg was not a member of Nasjonal Samling, and was not chosen when Quisling formed his cabinet on 1 February 1942. Instead he became a high- ranking servant in the Ministry of Finance and Customs. He left on a sick leave on 11 March 1943, and lost the position on 15 September. In 1945, when the Nazis lost the war, Sandberg formally ceased to be bank director and banking association chairman. In reality he had not been active in the latter position since 1940. He was arrested after the war's end, as the victors wanted a legal purge of those involved with the Nazi rule. According to Kjell Fjørtoft he was abused during the summer, by being ordered to carry heavy corpses from a room at Rikshospitalet and put them in coffins.

Mrs. Korjev and Mrs. Ling: Middle-aged women who live in Charlie's building and frequently care for Sophie while providing comic relief. The Morrigan: Babd, Macha, and Nemain, Celtic war deities and denizens of the underworld. Along with Orcus, they are the villains of the novel. Orcus: Husband of the Morrigan, and powerful force of darkness.  Appearances of characters from previous novels  A few characters from Moore's earlier novels participate in this story: Minty Fresh from Coyote Blue and, because of the story's San Francisco setting (where Bloodsucking Fiends took place), Jody (unnamed in a cameo appearance), The Emperor (and his two \\"soldiers\\", Bummer and Lazarus), and detectives Alphonse Rivera and Nick Cavuto. Jody's meeting with Charlie Asher is seen from her perspective, in You Suck: A Love Story, the continuation of Bloodsucking Fiends. Charlie Asher is referenced several times in Bite Me: A Love Story.

Umar did not match his father's vitality and gradually allowed the kingdom to be ruled by advisers (wazirs). Umar ruled from 1837 until November 1853 when he was deposed by his brother \`Abd ar-Rahman ibn Muhammad al-Amin who became Shehu. The latter only reigned until 1854 when Umar reconquered his throne.Louis Brenner, The Shehus of Kukawa: A History of the Al-Kanemi Dynasty of Bornu, Oxford Studies in African Affairs (Oxford, Clarendon Press, 1973), pp.78-79. Umar ruled as Shehu for a second time from September 1854 to 1880. Borno began to decline, as a result of administrative disorganization, regional particularism, and attacks by the militant Ouaddai Empire to the east. The decline continued under Umar's sons, and in 1894 Rabih az-Zubayr, leading an invading army from eastern Sudan, conquered Borno.

Members of the genus lived during the late Permian period in Germany and Brazil. Once believed to have been an ancestor to lizards, Protorosaurus is now known to be one of the oldest members of the lineage that would eventually lead to archosaurs such as crocodilians and dinosaurs.  Description  Life restoration Protorosaurus grew up to in length, and was a slender, lizard-like animal, with long legs and a long neck. Its body form suggests that it was fast-moving, although it may have fed primarily on insects. Protorosaurus was closely related to Czatkowiella from the Early Triassic of Poland.  Discovery  In 1914, a new ceratopsian dinosaur found by Lawrence Lambe was again given the name Protorosaurus (in this sense meaning \\"before Torosaurus\\"). When Lambe found that the name had already been used for the early archosauromorph, he renamed his ceratopsian Chasmosaurus. In Geopark of Paleorrota, Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil, 3 vertebrae and some bones of the animal were found.

Peacocks is a fast-fashion retail chain from the United Kingdom based in Cardiff, Wales. The chain is now part of the Edinburgh Woollen Mill group, and employs over 6,000 people. There are currently over four hundred Peacocks retail outlets located in the United Kingdom; and more than two hundred stores located in twelve other countries throughout Europe. Originally selling home goods and basic clothing, Peacocks has been re branded over the years as a value fashion store. Richard Kirk, the former owner of the chain, worked hard to transform Peacocks into a major fashion player. The retailer won numerous awards, notably the Best Value Retailer award from Drapers. In January 2012, Peacocks entered administration and was bought by The Edinburgh Woollen Mill Group. Edinburgh Group also owns the Jane Norman chain, a fashion outlet for women. History =Founding= Peacocks was established in Warrington in 1884, as a family run business selling a wide range of goods. Over the years, Peacocks Penny Bazaar has expanded, opening more outlets and tailoring its look to keep up with the times and trends. It has remained a family business throughout the Peacocks family history. =Relocation and expansion= The company moved to Cardiff in the 1940s, where it remains headquartered. The move had a profound impact on the group's growth, which for many years concentrated its increasing network in south Wales and southern England. Peacocks expanded further in the early 1990s, and the company was listed on the London Stock Exchange in December 1999. =2005: Management buyout= In October 2005, a £400 million management buyout led by Richard Kirk was negotiated, funded and organized by Echelon Capital and sponsored by Goldman Sachs, as well as hedge funds like Och-Ziff and Perry Capital controlling 55% of the new holding company. On 1 February 2006, the company unlisted from the exchange, and again became privately owned. In line with the increased demand for value for money fashion, Peacocks began to provide high fashion women's wear, men's wear and children's wear. High street outlets were revamped and placed together, with a steer towards prime locations. =2012: Administration= On 16 January 2012, Peacocks confirmed that it planned to enter administration, putting up to 100,000 jobs at risk. On 18 January 2012, KPMG was appointed administrators to Peacocks. On 19 January 2012, 250 head office staff were made redundant. On 22 February 2012, it was announced that Peacocks had been sold to the Edinburgh Woollen Mill Group. EWM purchased the Peacocks brand, 388 outlets, concessions, the headquarters and logistics functions in Wales. 224 outlets were not sold to EWM, resulting in 3,100 immediate job losses. Some branches reopened, and EWM has stated plans to open hundreds more in the United Kingdom and abroad at some stage in the future. The Edinburgh Woollen Mill (Group) now consists of two core brands: Peacocks and Edinburgh Woollen Mill. Branches Branded as Peacocks London, Peacocks has more than two hundred franchise outlets outside United Kingdom, in Bahrain, Cyprus, Egypt, Georgia, Gibraltar, Greece, Kuwait, Malta, Poland, Romania, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Serbia, Slovakia, Ukraine and United Arab Emirates.

It is owned by Ross Biederman's Midwestern Broadcasting, who also owns WTCM-AM/FM and WCCW-AM/FM, all in Traverse City, MI. WWTV-FM and WKJF-FM WJZQ was originally WWTV-FM, co-owned with WWTV, then at channel 13. It was signed on in 1961 by John Fetzer, a well-known TV station owner in the midwest and a longtime owner of the Detroit Tigers baseball team. The station's transmitter was on the fabled \\"Fetzer Mountain\\" in Osceola County, which was one of the highest points in Michigan. Many would claim that you could hear WKJF-FM on a good radio almost anywhere in Michigan. During some conditions, it can be heard as far south as Grand Rapids, Michigan. The station aired beautiful music, but began simulcasting WWAM's \\"top-40\\" format when that station signed on in 1968 . Later, it split from the simulcast and its call letters were changed to WKJF (Kalamazoo's John Fetzer). In the 1980s, WKJF was airing adult contemporary music. In the early 1990s, the station was sold to Ross Biederman, who flipped the formats of both stations. WKJF-AM became a simulcast of news/talk WTCM-AM in Traverse City, and eventually standards, then sports WCCW (AM) also in Traverse City, and WKJF-FM became a WTCM-FM clone, marketing itself as WTCM though they only simulcasted part of the time, plus WKJF played more classic country than their Traverse City sister, and referred its own call letters only hourly with the FCC-mandated station identification. Smooth Jazz 92.9 The Breeze Plans were announced in the early 2000s (decade) to move WKJF-FM's tower to southern Kalkaska County. The move would allow 92.9 to have city-grade coverage in Traverse City, Michigan. People knew that a new radio station was in the works from the Biederman camp since WTCM-FM's transmitter's not too far from WKJF's. Shortly before the big move, on July 1, 2001, 92.9 The Breeze debuted. The station would start broadcasting from their Kalkaska County facilities in December that year. This was not the first time northern Michigan had smooth jazz, as WJZJ 95.5/94.5 (along with WAVC 93.9 Mio) used the Jones feed in the 1990s as \\"Coast FM\\". The station flipped to alternative rock in 1998 as The Zone, citing new ownership and low ratings. (WAVC eventually dropped out of the \\"Zone\\" network to simulcast country sister station WMKC 102.9 St. Ignace as \\"Big Country.\\") In 2004, it was announced that Ross Biederman was selling WKJF-AM to Good News Media, owners of WLJN-FM/AM Traverse City, for $80,001 - $1 for the station itself and $80,000 for the land. The station now rebroadcasts Christian talk WLJN-AM as WLJW. In 1982, Biederman donated the original WTCM-AM 1400 to Good News when he moved the station to 580 AM and boosted the station's power to 2,500 watts. Format shift When The Breeze started broadcasting from their new facilities, ratings for the station skyrocketed, though they have tapered off since then. In response, the station added local, yet voicetracked personalities, cut back on the Jones Smooth Jazz satellite programming to only nights and weekends, and evolved its playlist during local dayparts to Soft Adult Contemporary. Before long, the Jones Smooth Jazz programming was completely gone from 92.9 and it was one-hundred- percent locally programmed, with the playlist including \\"middle of the road\\" artists such as Carpenters, Barbra Streisand, Barry Manilow and Olivia Newton- John mixed with AC currents, a handful of remnants from the jazz format such as Sade and Anita Baker, and even the occasional song by a local northern Michigan act. In early November 2007, WJZQ began playing continuous Christmas music 24/7 - the first time this station had done so - to compete with WLXT 96.3 FM, which has traditionally been northern Michigan's first station to go all-Christmas for the holiday season. In March 2008, The Breeze shifted its format again, to a Modern AC sound, playing currents and recurrents from 3 Doors Down, Ferras, Sara Bareilles, Amy Winehouse, Plain White Ts, O.A.R. and Coldplay. The station eliminated most of their softer titles from acts such as Kenny G, James Taylor, Carpenters and George Benson. On September 28, 2009, the station shifted towards a Top 40 (CHR) format, renamed The New Z93 - Today's Best Hits, complete with new imaging and some jock changes. The station now incorporates more rhythmic and pop material, particularly during the evening hours, from artists such as Britney Spears, Lady Gaga, R. Kelly, The Black Eyed Peas and T.I.. With the format shift, the station did not go all-Christmas for the 2009 holiday season, leaving WLXT as the sole all- Christmas station in the market (save for WLXT's Dial Global America's Best Music sister station WMBN). The station broadcasts from Biederman's Radio Centre building in downtown Traverse City. The WJZQ calls were formerly used by the station now known as WIIL in Kenosha, Wisconsin. This is the second time Midwestern Broadcasting has owned a Top 40 station with the moniker \\"Z93\\". WATZ-FM in Alpena (then at 93.5) was known as \\"Z93\\" during its short stint as a Top 40 outlet during the early 1980s. Jingles The station started using jingles in 2010 with Kiss Boston 2003 and Kiss Boston 2006 from Reelworld. The station currently uses the Reelworld One CHR service. All sweepers and liners are voiced by Harry Legg. Competition The station competes with WKHQ, the market's only other CHR station.

She first came into the public eye as a participant on the 5th cycle on the television series America's Next Top Model, placing 6th, and eventually went on to win the All Star cycle (17th cycle).  Early life  D'Amato was born in Los Angeles, California. Her parents divorced when she was seven, with her mother raising her as a single parent. D'Amato started modeling at the age of 12.  Reality TV  = America's Next Top Model =  Cycle 5  D'Amato claims to have been dared to send in an audition tape to America's Next Top Model because her friends were obsessed with the show. After a year of persuasion, she decided to participate in the program realizing she had nothing to lose. On the show, D'Amato soon became known as the \\"most notorious\\" of the models, not scared to speak her mind to the other contestants. She explained that this support truly comes from her heart because she wants other models to look their best, especially on national television. D'Amato cites having been abused as a child as the reason for her hard-hitting, survivalist attitude. She shocked the other models by urinating in a diaper while on a shoot which Nicole Linkletter was disgusted about. D'Amato would run around with wigs, masks, and weird outfits; and once had a long conversation with a Pampas Grass bush she named \\"Cousin It\\". The judges eliminated D'Amato seventh (sixth in overall rank since fellow contestant Cassandra Jean quit in episode four) in London during her only ever bottom two appearance which Jayla Rubinelli had survived for the second consecutive time. D'Amato has been identified since cycle 5 as one of the most memorable contestants due to her entertaining personality, unconventional beauty, penchant for melodrama, and strong fan base.  Cycle 17 All-Stars  After her first appearance on the show, D'Amato was selected to return to America's Next Top Model for an All-Star Cycle. Her seemingly off the wall antics secured her spot on this season of the show and aided in her journey to the top. Like all the other contestants on cycle 17, D'Amato was given a branding word: \\"daring\\". Using this key term, she presented herself on the show accordingly; wearing bold outfits for panel, expressing her extroverted personality and molding the challenges to fit her image. During her time on the show she developed her own perfume called \\"Neon\\" and performed in a music video for her song \\"I Be Like Whoa.\\" On December 7, 2011, D'Amato won over fellow finalist Allison Harvard from a Cycle 12 who was the runner up in both of her cycles making her the oldest winner at the age of 30 . = Other = Prior to appearing on All Stars, D'Amato appeared in the sixth season teaching the girls about posing.

Although his mother died when he was at a young age, he was considered as bright and capable as his father was. When Lê Lợi became sick in 1433, he summoned his closest advisors (Lê Sát, Trịnh Khả, Pham Van Sao, Nguyễn Trãi, Tran Nguyen Han, and Le Ngan) to name Lê Thái Tông as his heir to the throne. At the time Lê Thái Tông was only ten years old. Upon Lê Lợi's death, Lê Sát assumed the regency of Vietnam. Lê Sát ruled Vietnam more for himself than for the young emperor. He eliminated many of his rivals by various means and tried to further solidify his power base within the government. Lê Thái Tông became increasingly unhappy with his regent's actions and sought support from rival factions. He struck an alliance with Trịnh Khả, who had been exiled to a distant locality due to not getting along well with Lê Sát. One of his first acts upon officially taking the throne in 1438 was to bring Trịnh Khả back and installed him as the head of the Palace Guards - against Lê Sát's strong objections. A few months later, Lê Sát was accused of lacking in virtue and usurping the power which belonged solely to the emperor. The erstwhile Grand Chancellor was then arrested, tried and executed shortly after. The silk painting of Nguyễn Trãi (15th century) In spring 1440, an ethnic chief named Hà Tông Lai rebelled in Thu Vật sub-prefecture in Tuyên Quang (Northwest Đại Việt). Lê Thái Tông launched and personally led a campaign against Hà Tông Lai. After only one week of fighting, the young emperor emerged victorious as Hà Tông Lai was beheaded and his son Tông Mậu was arrested. Not long after that, in 1440 another ethnic chief named Nghiễm broke loyalty with the court and gathered troops in the Gia Hưng prefecture, also in the nation's northwest area. Lê Thái Tông again personally led troops to the northwest. The imperial armies defeated Nghiễm, who subsequently presented the emperor with a buffalo as a clue of submission. That satisfied the emperor enough and he ordered the army to retreat, partly due to the fact that the weather was excessively hot causing difficulties to his troops. In the early part of 1441, Đại Việt's official history recorded that Nghiễm again took arms against the court. Lê Thái Tông made a third campaign to the northwest with his troops. Under the direct command of the emperor, the imperial hosts defeated a Laotian army having come to assist Nghiễm. They also captured two of Nghiễm's sons Sinh Tượng and Chàng Đồng. The campaign resulted in Nghiễm permanently submissing to the authority of the imperial court. Those military successes caused Thái Tông to be assessed by Vũ Quỳnh, high-ranking minister and court annalist during the reign of Lê Tương Dực, as a \\"heroic emperor\\". Although Lê Thái Tông proved to be a capable emperor, his one flaw was his desire for women, and the imperial court was soon filled with intrigue as he shifted his affections from one concubine to another. His first wife was the daughter of Lê Sát, his second wife was the daughter of Le Ngan, his third wife was Duong thi Bi, who gave birth to his first son Nghi Dân. He soon transferred his affections to Ngo Thi Ngoc Dao and Nguyễn Thị Anh. This last young woman gave birth to his third son (and immediate heir) Lê Nhân Tông. However, Ngo Thi Ngoc Dao would give birth to his most widely known son, Lê Thánh Tông.  Death  On 4 August 1442, the Emperor paid a visit to the eastern part of the country and paid a visit to Lệ Chi Viên, or Lychee Garden belonging to the Confucian scholar Nguyễn Trãi, located in Đại Lai, Gia Bình, Bắc Ninh Province. A concubine of Trãi, Lady Nguyễn Thị Lộ, was chosen to tend to the Emperor during the royal stay. The young emperor became very sick suddenly and quickly died. The next morning Trãi was accused of killing the Emperor, and together with members of his family was executed.Đại Việt sử ký toàn thư, Hà Nội Social Science Publisher, 1993, Electronic Edition, page 405 In 1464, Emperor Lê Thánh Tông issued a royal proclamation to vindicate Trãi, saying that he was wholly innocent in the death of Lê Thái Tông and praised him by stating that “Trai’s spirit shines like a star\\". The surviving son of Trãi, Nguyễn Anh Vũ was made an officer for the Royal Court. Despite the vindication Trãi was considered guilty by some historians and scholars, because of his relationships with Lady Nguyễn Thị Lộ. On the basis that killing an Emperor is an unforgivable sin, Lê Quý Đôn in the 18th century stated that Nguyễn Trãi should not be considered as a meritorious official despite his great contributions for country and the royal court during reign of Emperor Lê Thái Tổ.About Grand empress dowager Trường Lạc Some reports by Ngô Sĩ Liên, Phan Huy Chú and Quốc sử quán (National History School under Nguyễn Dynasty) also wrote that Trãi might be innocent in the death of the Emperor but not Lady Nguyễn Thị Lộ. Other scholars suggest that Lady Nguyễn Thị Lộ may have been an innocent victim of Nguyễn Thị Anh the emperor's wife.Lễ nghi học sĩ Nguyễn Thị Lộ và thảm án Lệ Chi viên Other scholars suggest that the emperor became sick and died of natural causes.nghi vấn nhân đọc Văn chương Nguyễn Trãi của Bùi Văn Nguyên  Family  * Father: Le Thai To * Mother: Empress Cung Tu Pham Thi Ngoc Tran 范氏玉陳 * Consorts and their Respective Issue(s): # Empress Tuyen Tu Nguyễn Thị Anh ( 1422 - 1459) ## Crown Prince Le Bang Co, so Emperor Lê Nhân Tông # Empress Quang Thuc Ngo Thi Ngoc Dao (1421 - 1469) ## Prince Le Tu Thanh, so Emperor Lê Thánh Tông # Imperial Consort Le Ngoc Dao of Le clan # Consort Le Nhat Le of Le clan # Consort Duong Thi Bi ## Crown Prince Le Nghi Dan # Lady Bui of Bui clan ## Prince Le Khac Xuong See also *List of Vietnamese dynasties References = Notes = =Bibliography= 1423 births 1442 deaths Thai Tong Murdered royalty Child rulers from Asia 15th-century Vietnamese monarchy Vietnamese murder victims ","title":"Lê Thái Tông"},{"id":"4322983","text":"Dillons on Gower Street in London; now a branch of Waterstones Dillons was a British bookshop founded in 1932, named after its founder and owner Una Dillon. Originally based on Gower Street in London, the bookshop expanded under subsequent owners Pentos plc in the 1980s into a bookselling chain across the United Kingdom. In 1995 Pentos went into receivership and sold Dillons to Thorn EMI, which immediately closed 40 of the 140 Dillons bookstore locations. Of the remaining 100 stores, most kept the name Dillons, while the remainder were Hatchards and Hodges Figgis. Within Thorn EMI, Dillons was placed in the HMV Group, which had been a division of Thorn EMI since 1986. EMI demerged from Thorn in August of 1996, and Dillons-HMV remained an EMI holding. Dillons was subsumed under rival chain Waterstones' branding in 1999, at which point the brand ceased to exist. History Una Dillon founded the bookshop in 1932, but bought out a failing bookseller on Gower Street (near University College London) in 1936, and moved into the building most associated with the brand. Dillon drove the business forward, including delivering books by bike within eight hours. Her customers and friends included C. Day Lewis, John Betjeman and other bibliophiles. Dillon subsequently sold the majority of the company to the University of London in 1956, with the proviso that it used her name. Dillon's share was created by her donation of stock and goodwill from her old business. The university invested £11,000 which had been given by an insurance company. A man had died during building work and because he had no relatives, the university redirected the payout. The business was soon worth £1 million a year, and expanded to nearby buildings. Una Dillon retired as managing director from the business in 1968, but remained as a board member until 1977.. Her place, as Managing Director was taken by Peter Stockham. then followed a period when Dillons was controlled by the unions (Actss). Then in 1977, Grant Paton, from Glasgow, was appointed Managing Director by the then owners, University of London. It was taken over shortly afterwards by Pentos Ltd. Back in private hands by the mid-1980s, the store undertook a major makeover and modernisation, announcing its relaunch with the advertising poster \\"Foyled again? Try Dillons\\" displayed prominently on the bus shelter opposite its London rival Foyles.Christina Foyle; Managed Noted London Bookshop, Los Angeles Times, 11 June 1999. Inspired by the success of Waterstones, demonstrating the potential for large modern bookshops with a depth of stock, the new owners Pentos plc rapidly rolled out the format across the country, ultimately building up a chain of 75 stores. However, having overreached itself financially, Dillons was acquired by Thorn EMI, which already held the HMV chain, for £36 million. HMV acquired the larger Waterstones chain in 1998, and the following year the Dillons brand ceased to exist as a separate entity when the branches were rebranded as Waterstones. A remainder were sold on to the smaller chain Ottakar's, which itself was later taken over by Waterstones in 2006.

Some of its concrete piers encase stone masonry piers from an earlier truss bridge on this site, completed in 1891 by the Philadelphia, Harrisburg and Pittsburgh Railroad, which was then acquired by the Philadelphia and Reading Railroad to connect its Harrisburg and Lurgan lines. The current structure was constructed from 1920 to 1924 by replacing the trusses with concrete arches one track at a time. The bridge has fifty-one concrete arches, three more than the nearby Rockville Bridge. History In Harrisburg, the first bridge over the Susquehanna was built at the beginning of the 19th century on the site of today's Market Street Bridge. This led over the river island City Island, which is today surrounded by six bridges, including two railway bridges, with only the Philadelphia and Reading Railroad Bridge is used. Their predecessor structure was built between 1890 and 1891 by the Philadelphia, Harrisburg and Pittsburgh Railroad (PH&P;), an association of several smaller railway companies that Harrisburg associated with about 75 kilometers southwest Shippensburg. The PH&P; was later acquired by the Philadelphia and Reading Railroad (P&R;), which thus made the connection of their rail network to the Western Maryland Railway in the southwest and strengthened their position in the competition with the Pennsylvania Railroad (PRR). The PRR controlled until then all railway bridges over the Susquehanna in Pennsylvania below Selinsgrove, as well as the upstream Cumberland Valley Railroad Bridge and Rockville Bridge. In the immediate vicinity of the Philadelphia and Reading Railroad Bridge are upriver on the Lemoyne side some pillars of a never completed railway bridge of the South Pennsylvania Railroad, whose construction in 1885 was set in the wake of a negotiated by the banker JP Morgan compromise in the fierce power struggle of the then major railway companies. The originally single-track bridge consisted of 23 wrought- iron truss girders with a length of 45.5 meters each, whereby the pillars of sandstone had already been designed for a later twin-rail expansion. Since such an expansion never came about, the one-sided load on the pillars over time led to their damage. With the emergence of more powerful and heavier steam locomotives at the beginning of the 20th century, the maximum load capacity of the bridge was reached. The P & R decided therefore for the conversion to a double-railed arch bridge made of reinforced concrete. The reconstruction of the bridge took place in the years 1920 to 1924. First, new concrete was built between the original pillars, then reinforced the old sandstone brick by a concrete coating and finally all pillars connected by 46 sheets of reinforced concrete, where one after the other always a complete Half of the bridge between the two banks was built. To ensure the ongoing operation of about 75 trains daily, used in the first conversion phase, the track on the old trusses. From July 1922 it was then used the first track on the downstream newly created first half of the arch bridge and continued with the construction of the second half. A later extension of the bridge on the Harrisburg side increased the total number of bows to 51. The exact date of this extension is unknown. However, it took place at the latest in the 1940s, as images from this decade prove. As a result of the bankruptcy of several railway companies in the 1970s - including the successors of the P&R; (Reading Company) and the PRR (Penn Central) - 1976, the state rescue company Conrail was formed, in their possession of the Susquehanna railway bridges went over. In 1999, Conrail was acquired by Norfolk Southern Railway and CSX Transportation. The Philadelphia and Reading Railroad Bridge went to the Norfolk Southern Railway, which it uses for its rail freight service between Harrisburg in Pennsylvania and Hagerstown in Maryland (Lurgan Branch), but also partially approved use by CSX Transportation. Description The 1924 completed part of the arch bridge consists of 45 arches with a span of just over 23 m and a final arc on the west bank (Lemoyne side) with 21.5 m (each measured from the center of the arrow). This is followed by the abutment a 21 m long girder bridge with solid wall girders. The total length of the original bridge is about 1090 m. Later, the bridge was extended by five arches of similar span on the east bank (Harrisburg side) and thus extended by about 100 m. From the west to the east bank, the bridge has a gradient of 7 ‰, which reduces the height of the track level above normal water level from 24 m to 17 m. The bridge was designed to guarantee a minimum clear height of 8.7 m, based on the highest known flood level at that time.

It is known from a single fossil neck vertebra of the species T. posthumus, found in the Middle Stubensandstein formation of what is present-day Germany. History The vertebra used to name Tanystrosuchus (specimen SMNS 4385) was originally found by S.F.J. von Kapff in the 1860s. Christian Erich Hermann von Meyer described the vertebra in 1865, but did not attempt to classify it. In 1907, Friedrich von Huene examined the fossil and recognized it as part of a theropod dinosaur. He thought it probably belonged to the genus Tanystropheus (thought to be a theropod at the time), and named a new species for it, Tanystropheus posthumus.F. von Huene, Die Dinosaurier der Europäischen Triasformation mit berücksichtigung der Ausseuropäischen vorkommnisse [The dinosaurs of the European Triassic formations with consideration of occurrences outside Europe, Geologische und Palaeontologische Abhandlungen Suppl. 1(1), 1908, p. 1-419] The vertebra was added to the collections of the Staatliches Museum for Naturkunde in Stuttgart, but was labelled as a specimen of the phytosaurid Nicrosaurus. In 2000, Oliver Rauhut and Axel Hungerbühler re-examined the specimen and concluded that, while it was similar in some respects to the same bone in the contemporary Liliensternus, and was definitely from a theropod, it could not be classified due to its incomplete nature. Tanystrosuchus is considered to be a nomen dubium for that reason.Rauhut, O.M.W. & Hungerbühler, A. (2000) \\"A review of European Triassic theropods.\\" Gaia, 15: 75-88.

Twenty-two police officers, three soldiers and two police dogs were injured in the incidents during which protesters attacked the watchtowers at Creevekeeran and Drummuckaval with iron bars, bottles, fireworks and petrol bombs. Two soldiers suffered serious head injuries after being hit with petrol bombs and had to be airlifted to hospital. Another soldier suffered serious burns. The barracks at Crossmaglen was attacked and protesters managed to smash through the main gate after igniting an oil barrel and pushing it into the entrance. *Attack on SDLP councillor's office - In January 2002, SDLP councillor P. J. Bradley claimed members of ÓSF were responsible for an attack on his offices in Warrenpoint during which eleven windows were smashed and paint was poured over the building and in through the windows. Caitríona Ruane disputed Bradley's comments. *Attack on Rosslea PSNI station 2002 - On 1 July 2002 ÓSF was blamed for an organised attack against Rosslea PSNI station. Up to 50 masked youths threw stones and bottles at the police station causing extensive damage to the exterior of the building.

The member had been removing a Union Flag from the roof. This incident occurred at a time when Orange halls in the area had been subjected to firebomb and arson attacks. Some people claimed that removing the flag was anti-sectarian and should be applauded. *Green Postbox campaign 2008 onwards - One campaign undertaken by ÓSF involved changing the colour of Royal Mail postboxes in Northern Ireland from red to green (green is the standard colour of postboxes in the Republic of Ireland). Sinn Féin MLA Barry McElduff described the campaign as \\"peaceful political statement\\". Other politicians claimed this amounted to the MLA condoning criminal damage. It is believed hundreds of postboxes were painted green in such republican heartlands as Derry, Strabane and West Tyrone alone. *Occupation of Green Party offices 2008 - On 4 December 2008, a number of ÓSF members took part in a protest organised by the student based \\"Free Education for Everyone\\" (FEE) group.

The bridge links downtown Harrisburg, City Island, and the western suburbs of Cumberland County, Pennsylvania. The bridge was originally constructed by the Cumberland Valley Railroad as part of the mainline from Harrisburg to Hagerstown via Chambersburg. The Cumberland Valley Railroad itself was leased as a subsidiary by the Pennsylvania Railroad. The first crossing, a wooden covered bridge, began construction in the summer of 1836 and opened on January 16, 1839. It was destroyed by fire on December 4, 1844. The four eastern spans remained, but were washed away during the spring floods in 1846. A second crossing in a slightly different location began construction on February 3, 1845, and was completed in 1846. This bridge had an upper deck for railroad traffic, and a lower deck for pedestrian and wagon traffic. Use of the lower deck was discontinued when the bridge was strengthened in 1850. The bridge's latticework timbers were removed and replaced with heavier braces from 1855 to 1856, and new wooden arches were built in 1872. From 1880 to 1886, the piers beneath the bridge were gradually replaced, allowing it to carry much heavier traffic. Construction on an open iron truss bridge parallel to the existing wooden span began in September 1886. The work was done by the Union Bridge Company and the Edge Moore Bridge Company. The new bridge, whose eastern piers were higher than the old span's, opened in July 1887. The present concrete structure was completed about 1916. Although the majority of the bridge has been abandoned for rail use over the past several decades, it has been suggested the bridge become the principal crossing for the Corridor One rail commuter system to serve the renewed rail needs of the metropolitan area and of Harrisburg's west shore. With its standing ownership agreements, this plan faces major challenges as the bridge is currently shared among three owners. Two of these are the railroads on either side which continue to operate on the tracks immediately off of the bridge on either side.

It is known from a single fragmentary fossil specimen of the species H. longotarsus, found in the Middle Stubensandstein formation of what is present-day Germany. The only known specimen was poorly preserved and may have been put together from bones of unrelated animals. Further research would be required to determine which of the bones belonged together, and what kind of theropod Halticosaurus was. However, most of the bones have been lost. For these reasons, Halticosaurus is considered to be a nomen dubium. Etymology The name Halticosaurus comes from the Greek words altikos (αλτικος) meaning \\"good at jumping\\"/\\"nimble\\" and sauros (σαυρος) meaning \\"lizard\\"; thus \\"nimble lizard\\". Halticosaurus was described and named by Friedrich von HueneHuene, 1908. Die Dinosaurier der Europäischen Triasformation mit berücksichtigung der Ausseuropäischen vorkommnisse [The dinosaurs of the European Triassic formations with consideration of occurrences outside Europe]. Geologische und Palaeontologische Abhandlungen Suppl. 1(1), 1-419. in 1908 and the type species is Halticosaurus longotarsus. Description Halticosaurus longotarsus, is known from the holotype SMNS 12353, which consists of partial jaw bones and teeth, incomplete neck, back, hip and tail vertebrae, a partial humerus, two partial femora, and fragments of an ilium and a metatarsal. The specimen was discovered in the Middle Stubensandstein Member of the Löwenstein Formation in Baden-Wurttemberg, Germany. It was recovered by A. Burrer, G. Mayer, and E. Fraas in 1902, at the Burrerschen Quarry, in gray/blue marl that was deposited during the Norian stage of the Triassic period, approximately 215-212 million years ago. The specimen is currently housed in the collection of the State Museum of Natural History Stuttgart in Stuttgart, Germany. According to Welles (1984) H. longotarsus could be distinguished from the similar species Liliensternus liliensterni based on the following features:Welles, 1984. Dilophosaurus wetherilli (Dinosauria, Theropoda), osteology and comparisons. Palaeontographica. Beiträge zur Naturgeschichte der Vorzeit. Abteilung A: Paläozoologie, Stratigraphie 185 p. 85-180. * the lower jaw is shallower and is pointed more in the front * shorter and taller middle neck vertebrae are present * a sharp keel is present on the bottom of the middle neck vertebrae * the hip vertebrae are narrower * lower third hip vertebra than in Liliensternus * a more outwardly placed front trochanter * the presence of smaller distal condyles on metatarsal II which extend less far proximally on shaft In 1992, Michael Benton noted that the skull was long but was lightly built, with large fenestrae. The legs of the specimen were strong, and its arms were relatively short. Benton estimated that Halticosaurus would have been about long.Benton, M. (1992). Dinosaur and other prehistoric animal factfinder. 1st American ed. New York: Kingfisher Books. Chicago / Turabian. However, the fossil material used by these previous researchers was later found to be mixed together with the remains of other animals, including a sauropodomorph (Sellosaurus gracilis). In 2000, Rauhut and Hungerbühler re- examined the fossil material and concluded that only the two partial femora could be reliably referred to H. longotarsus. Classification In 1908, Huene originally assigned this genus broadly to Dinosauria, and after additional analysis in 1909 he assigned Halticosaurus to Saurischia.Huene, 1909. Skizze zu einer Systematik und Stammesgeschichte der Dinosaurier [Sketch of the systematics and origins of the dinosaurs]. Centralblatt für Mineralogie, Geologie und Paläontologie. 1909, 12-22. In 1952, Bock observed enough unique skeletal features to assign it to its own family Halticosauridae. Welles (1984) and Chatterjee (1987) later agreed with this classification.S. Chatterjee. 1987. A new theropod dinosaur from India with remarks on the Gondwana-Laurasia connection in the Late Triassic. Gondwana 6: Stratigraphy, Sedimentology and Paleontology, G. D. McKenzie (ed.), Geophysical Monographs 41:183-189 Over the years there was an effort to refer Halticosaurus to Podokesauridae by paleontologists like Simmons (1965), Ostrom (1978), Battail (1986) and Carroll (1988). In their attempt at phylogenetic analysis, Norman (1990) and later, Rauhut and Hungerbuhler (2000) concluded that Halticosaurus was indeterminate because the available material is too poorly preserved. A second species, based on a partial skull SMNS 12353b was assigned to this genus as cf. Halticosaurus orbitoangulatus. In 2000, Rauhut and Hungerbuhler reassigned this material to the genus Saltoposuchus, a crocodylomorph, based on the morphology of the teeth and the antorbital fenestra in the skull.Rauhut, O.M.W. & Hungerbühler, A. (2000) \\"A review of European Triassic theropods.\\" Gaia, 15: 75-88. A new genus name, Apatosuchus, was created for this specimen by Hans-Dieter Sues and Rainer R. Schoch in 2013 when they realized that it represented a primitive loricatan archosaur rather than a dinosaur or a crocodylomorph, as a result of further preparation of the specimen. A third species, H. liliensterni, was reclassified as Liliensternus by Welles. Mortimer (2011) noted that between 1934 and 1984, Liliensternus was incorrectly considered to be a species of Halticosaurus.

It was a reformulation of the prior Drug Use Forecasting (DUF) program, which focused on five drugs in particular: cocaine, marijuana, methamphetamine, opiates, and PhencyclidinePCP. AS ADAM it included tests for 9 drugs and self report of a long list of others. Methodology Participants were randomly selected from arrest records in jails and booking facilities in major metropolitan areas; no personally identifying information is taken from each record chosen, and prevalence estimates can be generated regarding those arrested in the catchment area covered by the jail. ADAM began as the Drug Use Forecasting program in 1987, which tested arrestees in 13 (later 23) jurisdictions on a quarterly basis. In 1991, juvenile data was added for the first time, at select sites. In 1996, President Clinton requested that the program be expanded, as ADAM, and the program was redesigned in 1997 by Abt Associates. At most, 40 jurisdictions ever participated in the program at one time under the DOJ and 10 counties under ONDCP's ADAM II. Information was obtained from personal interviews and urine analysis obtained voluntarily and confidentially, on the day of arrest and within 48 hours of arrest to allow a reasonable match or window of detection related to the half life of each drug in urine samples. Under DUF, both male and female subjects were selected on a random basis. When ADAM was fully implemented in 2000, the redesigned methodology was adopted, whereby male subjects were chosen at random and female subjects were chosen where available (not all participating sites have sufficient numbers of women arrestees to be statistically sound. ADAM defined this as 25 women available to be interviewed). In addition, the interview portion of the ADAM program was expanded to cover behaviors and drug use that could not be tested for by urinalysis, such as alcohol abuse, participation in the retail drug market, prior arrests and treatment experiences. The catchment areas were redefined, from metropolitan area/city limits to counties to help standardize the data. Cancellation On January 29, 2004, the ADAM program was halted due to funding concerns. The program was reimplemented in 2007 funded by ONDCP and run by Abt Associates. ONDCP continued the program in 10 of the original site until 2014. Results can be seen on the ONDCP website. Testing areas These sites were used at some or all points of the DUF/ADAM studies as testing areas. Some of the smaller locations such as Woodbury County, Iowa and Rio Arriba, New Mexico were added late in the program's life, in an attempt to gain information about non-metropolitan areas. In 2007 ten of the original sites continued: NYC, Chicago, Washington DC, Denver, Charlotte, Indianapolis, Sacramento, Portland, Minneapolis, Atlanta.

Its main leaders were Marcelino Domingo, Álvaro de Albornoz, and Félix Gordón Ordás. History PRRS was an important force in the elections of 1931, winning 54 seats in the Cortes Generales that proclaimed the Second Spanish Republic on April 14. It suffered a major setback by 1933, when it only gained five seats. In the meantime, it formed part of Prime Minister Manuel Azaña's coalition between Left Republican parties and the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party (PSOE); Álvaro de Albornoz was one of the architects of the secular legislation passed by the Cortes, and also served as Justice Minister. The party was shaken by several crises during its existence. In 1932, Juan Botella Asensi left the PRRS to found his own group (IRS, Izquierda Radical-Socialista – Radical-Socialist Left); the following year, it was split over the issue of collaboration with the PSOE: the left-wing, led by Domingo and Albornoz, argued for continued participation in government, while the right-wing of Gordón de Ordás favored an agreement with Lerroux's PRR (which they later joined). Towards the end of 1933, the leftists created the Partido Radical-Socialista Independiente (Independent Radical-Socialist Party), which fused with Acción Republicana and the Organización Republicana Gallega Autónoma to create Izquierda Republicana (April 3, 1934).

It is paleontologically significant for being one of the first ornithomimosaur specimens known from England and represents the earliest record of Ornithomimosauria in Europe. Discovery and naming Thecocoelurus is known only from half of a single cervical vertebra, discovered by the Rev. William Darwin Fox on the Isle of Wight during the 19th century. After his death the Fox Collection was acquired by the British Museum of Natural History. William Davies was the first to notice the specimen and assumed a close affinity with Coelurus. It was described by Harry Govier Seeley in 1888. Seeley named the fossil Thecospondylus daviesi, referring it to a genus he had named earlier for the incomplete cast of a sacrum.Seeley, H.G., 1888, \\"On Thecospondylus Daviesi (Seeley), with some remarks on the classification of the Dinosauria\\", Quarterly Journal of the Geological Society of London, 44: 79-86 However, in 1901 Baron Franz Nopcsa renamed it Coelurus daviesi.Nopcsa, F., 1901. \\"Synopsis und Abstammung der Dinosaurier\\", Földtany Közlöny 30 (1901): 247-279 In 1923 Friedrich von Huene decided that it should be removed from either Thecospondylus or Coelurus and given its own genus, Thecocoelurus. The generic name is a contraction of \\"Thecospondylus\\" and \\"Coelurus\\".Huene, F. von, 1923, \\"Carnivorous Saurischia in Europe since the Triassic\\", Bulletin of the Geological Society of America, 34: 449-458 The holotype, NHMUK PV R181, was found in debris from a layer of the Wessex Formation, dating from the Barremian. It consists of the anterior end, about a third, of a cervical vertebra estimated by Seeley to have been nine centimetres long. Classification Von Huene originally assigned Thecocoelurus to the Coeluridae, but in 1926 speculated that due to the not inconsiderable size and typical structure of the vertebra it might belong to a member of the Ornithomimidae.Von Huene, F., 1926, \\"The carnivorous Saurischia in the Jura and Cretaceous formations, principally in Europe\\", Revista del Museo de La Plata 29: 35-167 Though it has been since been typically identified as an indeterminate \\"coelurian\\" theropod, Thecocoelurus was reidentified by Darren Naish and colleagues in 2001 as a member of the Oviraptorosauria, a group of omnivorous maniraptoran theropods, which would make it the only oviraptorosaur fossil that has ever been found in Europe. Numerous detailed similarities are shared by the specimen and the cervical vertebrae of caenagnathid oviraptorosaurs. Naish et al. also considered Thecocoelurus to be a nomen dubium.Naish, D., Hutt, S. and Martill, D.M., 2001, \\"Saurichian dinosaurs 2: theropods\\", In: Martill and Naish (eds). Dinosaurs of the Isle of Wight. The Palaeontological Association. pp. 242-309 In 2004 it was theorized by James Kirkland that Thecocoelurus might not be an oviraptorosaur, but a member of the therizinosaur lineage instead, closely related to Falcarius,Kirkland , J. I., Zanno, L. E., DeBlieux, D. D., Smith, D. K., and Sampson, S.

A 2014 re-evaluation comparing the specimens with European ornithomimosaur fossils found that Thecocoelurus was likely one of the oldest known ornithomimosaurs, and a possible senior synonym of Valdoraptor.R.

Powered by a Heinkel 200cc engine, the car was based on the German Fuldamobil (also produced by Attica in Greece under licence), but with Alta's own body design. The company moved production to a new, larger factory in Elefsis where it operated until 1978.

History In 1855 geologist Ferdinand Vandeveer Hayden sent a number of fossils to paleontologist Joseph Leidy in Philadelphia. Hayden had collected them from the surface of a rock formation then known as the Great Lignite Formation (now recognized as part of the Lance Formation) in the Nebraska Territory, near the Grand River (present-day South Dakota). Among them were two caudal vertebrae and a phalanx. In 1856 Leidy named the type species Thespesius occidentalis for these three bones.Leidy, J. (1856). \\"Notice of extinct Vertebrata, discovered by Dr. F. V. Hayden during the expedition to the Sioux country under the command of Lieut. G.K. Warren.\\" Proceedings of the Academy of Natural Science Philadelphia, 8(December 30): 311-312. The generic name is derived from Greek θεσπεσιος, thespesios, \\"wondrous\\", because of the colossal size of the remains. Leidy avoided using the suffix \\"saurus\\" in the genus name because Vandiveer Hayden had claimed the bones came from a layer from the Miocene so there was a chance that the animal would turn out to be a mammal, though Leidy himself was convinced it was a dinosaurian. The specific name means \\"western\\" in Latin. The caudal vertebrae, USNM 219 and USNM 221, and the middle toe phalanx, USNM 220, form the original syntype series. Classification Like Trachodon, another duckbill genus named by Joseph Leidy, Thespesius is a historically-important genus with a convoluted taxonomy that has been all but abandoned by modern dinosaur paleontologists. Around 1900 the name was used by some authors to indicate all late Maastrichtian hadrosaurids in North America.Creisler, B.S. (2007). \\"Deciphering duckbills.\\" Pp. 185-210 in Carpenter, K. (ed.), Horns and Beaks: Ceratopsian and Ornithopod Dinosaurs. Bloomington and Indianapolis: Indiana University Press. In 1875, E.D. Cope stated that he considered Agathaumas milo, known from partial limb bones and some vertebrae, to be a synonym of T. occidentalis (which he considered a species of Hadrosaurus at the time).Cope, E. D. (1875). Report on the vertebrate paleontology of Colorado. US Government Printing Office. In 1900, a short piece published in Science by F.A. Lucas noted that Leidy's original Thespesius occidentalis fossils were indistinguishable from more complete specimens which had been referred in the late 1800s to the species Claosaurus annectens. Therefore, Lucas argued, the name T. occidentalis should be used for this animal.Lucas, F.A. (1900). \\"Paleontological Notes.\\" Science, 12(308): 809-810. Lucas' opinion was supported by Charles W. Gilmore in a 1915 paper for Science re-evaluating the use of the genus Trachodon. A wide variety of hadrosaurid species had been classified as Trachodon or \\"trachodonts\\", most notably the large \\"duck-billed\\" specimens collected by E.D. Cope and mounted in the American Museum of Natural History. Gilmore noted that the holotype fossils of T. occidentalis were \\"inadequate\\", but that geologic work showed that they undoubtedly came from the same fossil beds as Claosaurus annectens, and that therefore the older name (T. occidentalis) should be used for the Lance-aged \\"trachodonts.\\"Gilmore, C.W. (1915). \\"On the Genus Trachodon.\\" Science, 41(1061): 658-660. Many later researchers, including L.S. Russell and Charles M. Sternberg, continued to use the names Thespesius occidentalis or Thespesius annectens for the Lance hadrosaurids through the 1920s and 1930s.Russell, L.S. (1930). \\"Upper Cretaceous dinosaur faunas of North America.\\" Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society, 69(1): 133-159.Sternberg, C.M. (1936). \\"The systematic position of Trachodon.\\" Journal of Paleontology, 10(7): 652-655.Sternberg, C.M. (1939). \\"Were there Proboscis-bearing Dinosaurs? Discussion of Cranial Protuberances in the Hadrosauridae.\\" Journal of Natural History, 3(17): 556-560. However, as early as 1913, paleontologist Lawrence Lambe regarded the type fossils of Thespesius occidentalis as inadequate and that any inferences based on them were too conjectural, as was the case for Trachodon. In an influential 1942 paper on hadrosaurids by Richard S. Lull and Nelda E. Wright, the authors classified most specimens of Thespesius annectens in the new genus Anatosaurus, and referred Cope's giant \\"duck-billed\\" specimens to Anatosaurus copei. Though they noted that T. occidentalis could possibly be distinguished from Anatosaurus based on its shorter tail vertebrae, they ultimately agreed with Lambe that, despite its historical importance, Thespesius occidentalis was too incomplete for good comparison.Lull, R.S. & Wright, N.E. (1942). \\"Hadrosaurian dinosaurs of North America.\\" Geological Society of America Special Papers, 40: 1-272. It has been generally ignored as a nomen dubium ever since. A referred species of Thespesius, T. saskatchewanensis, was named by Sternberg in 1926,Sternberg, C.M. (1926). A new species of Thespesius from the Lance Formation of Saskatchewan. Canada Department of Mines Geological Survey Bulletin (Geological Series) 44(46):73-84. but Nicolás Campione and David Evans found that it was a synonym of Edmontosaurus annectens in a 2011 study of edmontosaur diversity. Campione and Evans also found Thespesius edmontoni, named by Gilmore in 1924,Gilmore, C.W. (1924). A new species of hadrosaurian dinosaur from the Edmonton Formation (Cretaceous) of Alberta. Canada Department of Mines Geological Survey Bulletin (Geological Series) 38(43):13-26. to be a synonym of Edmontosaurus regalis.

He was born in Surnadal. At a young age he became involved in the Young Liberals, the youth wing of the Liberal Party. In the local chapter of Oslo he was a member of the board from 1937 to 1939, and deputy chairman from 1939 to 1945. From 1945 to 1947 he was a board member of their national organization. In 1948 he became a deputy member of the Liberal Party national board, advancing to regular board member in 1952. He continued in this position, becoming national party leader in 1970. He was elected to the Parliament of Norway from Oslo in 1953, and was re-elected on three occasions in 1957, 1965 and 1969. In between he headed the Liberal ballot in the 1961 election, but the Liberals had no MPs elected. In 1965 he was appointed Minister of Local Government in the centre-right Borten's Cabinet. He left in 1970, and was replaced by Helge Rognlien.Ministry of Local Government and Regional Development: Councillor of State 1948- - Government.no During his fifth term as parliament member, in December 1972, Seip joined the Liberal People's Party which split from the Liberal Party over disagreements of Norway's proposed entry to the European Economic Community. He was again succeeded by Helge Rognlien, this time as party leader of the Liberal Party. Instead, Seip became the first leader of the Liberal People's Party. However, Seip was not re-elected to parliament in 1973, thus disappearing from national politics. On the local level Seip was a member of Oslo city council from 1945 to 1947, and later of Bærum municipal council from 1951 to 1967, serving as deputy mayor from 1951 to 1955, and later another tenure from 1979 to 1991. Outside politics, Seip graduated from the University of Oslo as cand.oecon. in 1941 and cand.jur. in 1942. Among his jobs before becoming a cabinet member were consultant in the Ministry of Finance from 1946 to 1948, lecturer at the University of Oslo from 1947 to 1955, assistant secretary in the Ministry of Trade from 1948 to 1952, the same position at Statistics Norway from 1952 to 1954 and political chief editor in the newspaper Dagbladet from 1954 to 1965. In 1951 the idea of appointing Seip as a State Secretary in the Ministry of Finance was discussed, but it did not happen. He was secretary general of the Nordic Council from 1973 to 1977, and editor-in-chief of Norges Handels- og Sjøfartstidende (renamed Dagens Næringsliv in 1987) from 1977 to 1980. In 1980 he was appointed director of the newly created Norwegian Data Inspectorate. He left in 1989 to become Data Protection Commissioner for the Council of Europe, a position he held until his retirement in 1995. His brother Martin Fredrik Seip was a noted physician and professor of medicine.

A member of the Sucre family Sucre Figarella served as governor, minister and senator during his long and eventful political career. He was nicknamed \\"The Builder\\" and \\"The Czar of Guayana\\". Biography =Early career= He was born in Tumeremo in the state of Bolivar on August 1, 1925. He received his education as a civil engineer at the Universidad Central de Venezuela and soon entered public service as an engineer at the Ministry of Public Works in Miranda. During the 1950s, he actively opposed the dictatorship of Marcos Pérez Jiménez and had to go into hiding several times due to security concerns. In 1958 and with the fall of Pérez Jiménez, Sucre Figarella was named Governor of Bolivar by new president Romulo Betancourt. There he pushed for the creation of Santo Tomé de Guayana, today known as Ciudad Guayana, one of the most important and largest cities in the state. From 1960 to 1969 he served as minister of public works during the governments of Betancourt and Raul Leoni. From this position, Sucre pushed forward many important works such as the Angostura Bridge in Ciudad Bolívar, the General Rafael Urdaneta Bridge in Maracaibo, the Araña highway distributor, the Tejerías-Caracas highway, the Guri Dam in Bolivar, the famous Cota Mil in Caracas as well as pushing forth works on the Caracas Metro and the expansion of the Simón Bolívar International Airport among others. =Czar of Guayana= In 1984, President Jaime Lusinchi named him president of the Corporacion Venezolana de Guayana with the rank of cabinet member. From there Sucre Figarella gave an important push to the region's development, the likes of which had not been seen previously. During this time the Guri Dam project is finally completed, the Ciudad Bolívar-Ciudad Guayana and Ciudad Guayana-Upata highways are built along with other important roadworks including the completion of several bridges. He also expanded the production capacity of Sidor, Ferrominera, Venalum, Alcasa and Interalumina and created Bauxiven, Carbonorca, Proforca, Remorca and other important companies. The entire waterworks of the Guayana region was improved upon along with the health, justice, sports and agriculture infrastructure. Some, such as newspaper columnist José Ignacio Acevedo, consider Sucre Figarella's infrastructure construction to be the most useful and expansive during the whole of the democratic period in Venezuela. He would remain at the helm of the CVG during the presidencies of Jaime Lusinchi and Carlos Andrés Pérez, finally stepping down in 1993. During his time with the CVG, he had also been elected Senator for the state of Bolivar for the period between 1984 and 1989. After his resignation from the state-owned company, he was elected for another period lasting between 1994 and 1999. He was unable to complete this second appointment due to his sudden death on October 17, 1996 only a few months after the death of his brother General Juan Manuel Sucre Figarella.

Cliff Clavin?\\" is the fourteenth episode of the eighth season of the American television sitcom Cheers, co-written by Dan O'Shannon and Tom Anderson, and directed by Andy Ackerman rather than James Burrows, who directed most of other episodes of the series. It originally aired on January 18, 1990 on NBC. In this episode, Cliff Clavin (John Ratzenberger) appears on the game show Jeopardy! and game show host Alex Trebek guest stars as himself. Cliff racks up an insurmountable lead during the game, only to lose it all in the final round. The episode received praise from critics for its concept and its guest star. Plot Cliff Clavin (John Ratzenberger) competes on the television game show Jeopardy!, which has temporarily moved taping to Boston for a special occasion. Cliff amasses $22,000 by the end of the Double Jeopardy! round, more than twice the score of the second place contestant, theoretically ensuring a win. For the Final Jeopardy! clue of \\"Archibald Leach, Bernard Schwartz and Lucille LeSueur\\" in the category of \\"Movies\\", Cliff responds incorrectly with \\"Who are 3 people who've never been in my kitchen?\\", signing the amount of his wager as \\"$22,000 Big Ones!\\". Having overconfidently wagered his entire score as revealed, Cliff loses all of his winnings, and the match. Cliff objects and argues, demanding that his answer be accepted. The show's host, Alex Trebek, later arrives at Cheers, tells Cliff that his response should have been accepted earlier, and announces to Cliff his resignation as the host of Jeopardy!. However, Cliff convinces Trebek to remain as host by telling him how much the show and Trebek mean to him. After Cliff shares the news with others that he \\"saved Jeopardy!\\", Norm Peterson (George Wendt) praises Trebek for doing this just to make Cliff feel better. However, Trebek says that he did not realize that Cliff was at the bar and that meeting him had been a coincidence. Trebek says that Cliff scares him and that the story about quitting the show was a fabrication to placate him. Meanwhile, Sam Malone (Ted Danson) receives telephone calls from women whom he previously dated; they are angry with him for making dates, making them wear \\"French-cut panties and a miniskirt\\", and not arriving at a roller rink. He eventually discovers that his \\"little black book\\" has been stolen and enlists the help of bar patrons to find it. Through their detective work, Sam discovers that the thief has called Sam's women in alphabetical order, and that Rebecca Howe (Kirstie Alley) is the next recipient on the list. Carla uses her bluff to blackmail the reluctant Rebecca into helping Sam capture the thief. The thief calls Rebecca, who asks him to meet her at the bar instead of the roller rink. Then the thief enters, turning out to be a teenage boy named Timmy (Greg E. Davis), who wants to become a \\"babe hound\\" like Sam. After getting his little black book back, Sam lets Timmy go, advising him to start as a \\"babe pup\\" and to call girls around his age, and gives him $25 for a haircut and a tip for a shampoo girl. Production Dan O'Shannon and Tom Anderson co-wrote \\"What Is... Cliff Clavin?\\", and Andy Ackerman directed the episode. Bernard Kuby portrays Earl, a bar patron in the cold opening returning to Cheers for the first time since he moved to Alaska in the 1960s and explaining the bar's interior differences between 1960s and 1980s. Jeopardy! announcer Johnny Gilbert also made a guest appearance as himself announcing the game show. William A. Porter portrays one of Jeopardy! contestants, Milford Reynolds, a doctor of neurosurgery. Audrey Lowell portrays another contestant, Agnes Borsic, a lawyer who eventually becomes the top winner after Cliff wagered and then lost all of his winnings. Peter Schreiner and Steven Rotblatt are credited for their background appearances.  Reception  General Norman Schwarzkopf said this was the funniest episode of Cheers. Don Leighton from Superior Telegram called this episode the greatest and said the Final Jeopardy! moment was hilarious. Jeffrey Robinson from DVD Talk said the concept of the episode was a riot. Hot Springs Village Voice called Cliff's Final Jeopardy! moment a classic example of his mishaps caused by his own \\"know-it-all nature\\". Andrew Razeghi, in his book Hope, called this episode \\"one of the most memorable episodes\\" of Cheers, found Cliff's response to the Final Jeopardy! clue neither right nor wrong and an example of divergent thinking, and called Cliff a poster child of Joy Paul Guilford. Former Jeopardy! contestant Ken Jennings, in his book Brainiac, noted that Jeopardy!-related sitcom episodes had become common at the time.  In popular culture  On the first episode of Jeopardy! season 31, which aired on September 15, 2014, Jeopardy! champion Elizabeth Williams echoed Cliff Clavin's answer in her response to the Final Jeopardy clue. Williams's $600 wager combined with her opponents' incorrect responses allowed Williams to triumph that day, nonetheless. The question categories from the first round of the game Cliff Clavin played in (\\"Civil Servants\\", \\"Stamps from Around The World\\", \\"Mothers and Sons\\", \\"Beer\\", \\"Bar Trivia\\", \\"Celibacy\\", described in the episode by Woody as \\"Mr. Clavin's Dream Board\\") were used as categories in the Double Jeopardy! round of a Jeopardy! game played on May 10, 2005, during the 2005 Ultimate Tournament of Champions. The episode inspired the term \\"Clavin's Rule\\" in reference to maximizing all the winnings at the final round and losing them all. Trebek himself \\"ma[de] several references to contestants pulling 'a Cliff Clavin' \\" since the episode originally aired. Cameron Martin of The Atlantic magazine, Ashley Burns of Uproxx Tim Graham of ESPN blog, and Christopher Hair of an SBNation blog Five for Howling have also used the phrase \\"pull a Cliff Clavin,\\" coined as a \\"practice\\".

Biography Caricature of Capel dancing with Chanel Born in Brighton, Sussex, Capel was the son of Arthur Joseph Capel, a British shipping merchant, and his French-born wife, the former Berthe Andrée A. E. Lorin (1856-1902). He had three sisters: Marie Henriette Teresia Capel, Mary Josephine Lawrence Edith Capel and Berthe Isabelle Susanna Flora Capel who married Sir Herman Alfred de Stern, Baron Michelham, the son of Herbert Stern, 1st Baron Michelham. In the obituary of one of Capel's daughters, he was described as \\"an intellectual, politician, tycoon, polo-player and the dashing lover and sponsor of the fashion designer Coco Chanel\\".Lady Hutchinson, obituary, The Daily Telegraph, 4 October 2006. According to that obituary, Capel was a Roman Catholic and his wife had to convert to Catholicism to marry him, and her two daughters by him were raised as Catholics. There are hints in biographies of Chanel about Capel's reputed (illegitimate) connections with the Capel Earls of Essex, but no connection has been established. Capel’s father and grandfather were born in Kent. His paternal grandfather served in the navy, marrying and starting a family in Co. Waterford, Ireland, during his service. His grandfather joined the coastguard service, following his navy service, and was posted to the coastguard station at the Sizewell Gap in Suffolk. An alumnus of Beaumont College, he was a shipping merchant and already an apparently wealthy self-made man by 1909. Capel was killed in an automobile accident on Monday 22 December 1919, allegedly en route to a Christmas rendezvous with Chanel. He was buried with full military honours at Fréjus Cathedral on 24 December 1919.The Times, 24 December 1919, p. 10: \\"Lord Rosslyn, telegraphing last night from St. Raphael, stated that Captain Arthur Capel, who was killed in an automobile accident on Monday, is being buried today at 2.30 p.m. at Frejus with full military honours.\\". A roadside memorial was placed at the site of the accident, consisting of a cross bearing the inscription: \\"A la mémoire du capitaine Arthur Capel, légion d'Honneur de l'armée britannique, mort accidentellement en cet endroit le 22 décembre 1919.\\" Capel and Chanel His affair with Chanel apparently began in 1909, when he became acquainted with the then 26-year-old mistress of his friend Étienne Balsan.\\"At this time in 1909, at the age of 26, she became friendly with an Englishman Arthur Capel, nicknamed \\"Boy\\", who was one of Etienne [Balsan]'s friends...\\" Capel financed Chanel's first shops and his own clothing style, notably his blazers, inspired her creation of the Chanel look. The couple spent time together at fashionable resorts such as Deauville, but he was never faithful to Chanel. Their relationship lasted nine years, and even after Capel married he continued his affair with Chanel until his death in late 1919.\\"Even though he was married Capel still sought out Gabrielle when he was in Paris. But all this was to come to an abrupt end... Capel was driving to Cannes for Christmas when he was involved in a fatal accident.\\" Marriage and children In 1918, Capel married the Honourable Diana Wyndham, née Lister (born 7 May 1893—died 1983), a daughter of Lord Ribblesdale and widow of Captain Percy Lyulph Wyndham (killed in action, 1914), who was the half-brother of Hugh Grosvenor, 2nd Duke of Westminster. Diana's elder sister Laura was married to Lord Lovat, and another sister to Sir Mathew Wilson, 4th Baronet: after Capel's death, in 1923 Diana married Vere Fane, 14th Earl of Westmorland.The Times, Thursday, 13 May 1948; p. 7; issue# 51070 Capel had two daughters: * Ann Diana France Ayesha Capel (28 April 1919 – 4 May 2008). Ann was married three times and had children with her first two husbands. In 1940 she married firstly George Ward (1907–1988), who in 1960 was raised to the peerage as Viscount Ward of Witley.The Times, Saturday, 1 June 1940; p. 9; issue#48631 They had two children: a son who died unmarried at age 40, and a daughter, actress Georgina Ward (1941-2010), otherwise the Honourable Mrs Patrick Tritton. They divorced in 1951 and the same year on 7 August 1951 Ann married Richard Thurstan Holland-Martin (1907 — 1968) by whom she had two sons: Barnaby Robert (born 1952) and Giles Thurstan (born 1955 — died 4 May 2008). They divorced in 1966.Genealogy of Robert Martin (1908—1897) Thurstan Holland-Martin, fifth son of Robert Martin Holland, later Holland-Martin (R License, 14 August 1917), was the elder brother of Christopher Holland-Martin MP, and younger brother of Admiral Sir Deric Holland-Martin Ann Capel's third husband was Peter Higgins. When her youngest son's death was reported, she was described as the \\"late Mrs Peter Higgins\\". * June Capel (1920 — 2006), later Lady Hutchinson of Lullington. June was born after her father had died, apparently without his being aware of her conception. Hence there was no provision for her in his will which had to be contested to ensure that June got a share of her father's fortune (most of it subsequently stolen by a lawyer, according to Lady Hutchinson's obituary).Lady Hutchinson, obituary, Daily Telegraph, 4 October 2006 In 1948 June Capel married Franz Osborn, by whom she had a son, Christopher. Her second marriage took place in May 1966 to Jeremy Hutchinson, QC (born 28 March 1915). Hutchinson was the former husband of actress Peggy Ashcroft and was created a life peer on 16 May 1978 with the title Baron Hutchinson of Lullington, of Lullington in the County of East Sussex. Unrealized political legacy Two years before his accidental death, Capel had met in Paris a brilliant young Pole, Jozef Retinger, whom he inspired with his talk of federalism and the idea of world government based on an Anglo- French alliance. His ideas were strongly supported by Sir Harry Wilson, whose ADC he had been, and Capel aroused the interest of such statesmen, as Aristide Briand, Georges Clemenceau and Woodrow Wilson. He had also promoted his ideas in Vatican diplomatic circles. Retinger helped Capel with his proposed book, The World on the Anvil. The seed had been planted in Retinger's mind and, though transformed, it arguably influenced the creation of the League of Nations and came to fruition decades later in the European Union.M.B.

Its major units were 2nd Armored Division and 8th Infantry Division (8 DI). On 1 July 1979 the Corps was transferred to Lille and its HQ fused with HQ 2nd Military Region. In 1991 the functions were separated, and Generals Arnold, Vaujour, Billot, and Heinrich held command as commanders of 3rd Corps solely. With its transfer to Lille, the corps took control of a force of 50,000 personnel including reservists, with 380 AMX-30, 1,300 armoured vehicles, 106 artillery pieces, and 56 Roland anti-aircraft missiles. In 1984 the 6th Engineers Regiment joined the corps. At the end of the 1980s, the Corps comprised three major formations, the 2nd Armored Division and 10th Armoured Divisions and the 8th DI. There was also a logistics brigade stationed at Beauvais. On 1 July 1990, with the promulgation of the ‘Armées 2000’ plan, the 3rd Army Corps became the only army corps in the metropolitan territory, and the 7th Armored Division joined it, with the grouping rising to 44,000 men with 15,000 vehicles. : In 1993, after the disbandment of the 8th DI, the Corps was reorganised to include three armoured divisions, the 2nd, 7th, and 10th, the 12th Light Armoured Division with its command post at Saumur,In Isby's Armies of NATO's Central Front, p127, the Armour of the 12th Light Armoured Division (c. 1985) is the 507 Regiment de Chars de Combat, used AMX-30.

It has its headquarters in Bergen and is published in tabloid format. The newspaper webpage ba.no is Bergen's largest local newspaper webpage. In 2006, Bergensavisen had a daily circulation of 30,719 on Monday to Saturday, and 29,782 on Sundays. Approximately 108,000 read the paper every day. Pre-history Bergensavisen had a predecessor in Arbeidervennen, founded by the Danish trade unionist Sophus Pihl in 1885. When he died in 1888, a group of trade unionists and idealists continued his work. The newspaper Arbeidet, started as a daily in December 1893. They sold their newspaper to Bergens Arbeiderparti, the local affiliation of the Norwegian Labour Party in 1905. However, the Labour Party went through two party splits in the 1920s. As the Labour Party joined Comintern in 1919, a group broke away in 1921 to form the Social Democratic Labour Party. This group founded a new newspaper Bergens Social-Demokrat in 1922.List of historical newspapers The next year, the Labour Party left Comintern. As a result, the pro-Comintern faction broke away to form the Communist Party. In the city of Bergen, the communists controlled the local Labour Party chapter Bergens Arbeiderparti, and its newspaper Arbeidet. When the social democrats had lost the power struggle, the victorious communists changed the journalism of their newspaper from social democracy to communism in 1922, erased the local news and published long political articles, chasing their readers away from the newspaper. The few remaining Labour activists were left without a newspaper. Bergen Labour Party tried to run a newspaper called Bergens Arbeiderblad formerly, but it only existed from 11 April 1924 till October 1924. In 1927, the Social Democratic Labour Party reconciled with the Labour Party, and the two parties again became one. At the same time, a new newspaper Bergens Arbeiderblad was founded on the base of Bergens Social- Demokrat. 1927 is considered the official founding year of BA. The seven men commissioned to start the newspaper, also started the new Labour Party of Bergen, called Bergens Forenede Arbeiderparti. Three years later, they had bigger circulation than Arbeidet. Arbeidet closed in 1948. History Bergens Arbeiderblad eventually became larger than Arbeidet, and instead started competing with Bergens Tidende, which was dominant in the city. Bergens Arbeiderblad was stopped by the Nazi authorities in February 1941 during the German occupation of Norway, chief editor Oscar Ihlebæk was sent to a German concentration camp, where he died just after the camp was liberated by the Allied forces in May 1945. It resumed operations after the war. BA added a Sunday edition in August 1990, changed name to Bergensavisen in August 1992 and started one of the first online newspapers in Norway in January 1996.

Exciter Cat in Bowl Back of City Hall after 1906 San Francisco Earthquake Dead Horses photograph by Edith Irvine Lizzie Edith Irvine (7 January 1884 - 1949) was an American photographer who documented the 1906 San Francisco earthquake. Early life Irvine was born in Sheep Ranch, Calaveras County, California to Thomas Hanna Irvine and Mary Irene (Hills) Irvine. Her father was a gold miner. Edith’s grandfather, William Irvine, was the youngest in a family of nine children, and was born in Ireland. In 1846 William immigrated to New York with his older brother, James. Both William and James travelled to California to try to find gold in the 1849 gold rush. After successfully mining gold, James joined the upper class in southern California and owned the Irvine Ranch in Orange County. He also had a produce and delivery business in San Francisco, and owned a home in San Francisco at Folsom and Eleventh streets. When James Irvine died on 15 March 1886, he directed in his will that over US$100,000 should be provided his wife, brothers, sisters, and other relatives through the liquidation of many of his properties. Substantial land gifts, not to exceed the value of $5,000 were also to be given family members from his holdings in southern California. Wilma (\\"Billy\\") Plunkett, Photoarchivist at the Lee Library in 1988, indicates in her master’s project on Irvine, that the “family fortunes increased due to acquisitions of mines and other real estate,” and that the Irvine family became part of the “upper social strata of the area.” Irvine apparently often visited with family members in San Francisco and southern California. Irvine and her brother Robert lived together most of their lives as she never married and he didn’t marry until he was 60 years old. They continued to live together in the family home now in Mokelumne Hill, California. Photography By her early teens Irvine had created a darkroom in a rear corner of the house in Mokelumne Hill, or Moke Hill as the natives call it. At 14, in 1898, she was already photographing the extensive Electra Power Project – an early hydroelectric power project in California. This project, near her home on the Mokelumne River, California, was completed in 1902. Family tradition says that she was hired as a photographer for this project by Standard Electric of California, the predecessor of Pacific Gas & Electric Company, but no records have been found to substantiate that. Her work at that young age is impressive in documenting a monumental civil engineering project. Her next great photographic venture, and certainly the epitome of her brief photography career, came at the age of 22, documenting the 1906 San Francisco earthquake. Her photographs draw the viewer into the full range of the earthquake experiences, from devastation to even humor. In 1910 she considered herself a professional photographer as noted on the census, but for reasons unknown, by 1920 her occupation was school teacher. Anecdotal stories that Plunkett gathered for her master’s project indicate that Edith had long red hair and that she loved to ride her horses and drive her Model T Ford. In her later years no one outside of the family seemed to be aware of her photographs. One of her former students characterized her as fair, but strict, and a good teacher. Health and later years Edith’s life was difficult both physically and emotionally. She apparently suffered from severe joint pains of unknown origin, which were treated by her doctor with painkillers. Later she lapsed into alcoholism – all of which caused severe mental deterioration as well as the expected physical deterioration. In addition she began to lose her hearing at an early age, until by 45 years old, she had become severely hearing impaired. She never recovered from the medical and emotional problems that she suffered from in her later years. Not long after her brother, Bob, was granted legal guardianship for her on 8 June 1949, she died at age of 65. It was with the donation of her small collection of photographs to the Brigham Young University Library in 1988 by her nephew, Jim Irvine, Bob’s son, that her photographic talents became known outside of her circle of family and friends. Subject matter Her black and white photograph Dead Horses attests to her photographic vision. At least four dead horses which were pulling carriages lie in their traces among broken carriages and brick rubble from the San Francisco earthquake of 1906. The gelatin dry plate negative, exists in the L. Tom Perry Special Collections at Brigham Young University's Harold B. Lee Library. The library holds 293 images in the Irvine Collection.Edith Irvine Collection : Browse They range in subject matter from landscapes (such as the Bridalveil Fall) and bridges, to everyday life, family portraits, infant deaths and Mokelumne Hill townscapes. Her oeuvre includes much from a redwood forest to city buildings, as well as the earthquake and its effect on architecture, street scapes, fires and prevailing activities amidst the destruction. In 2005, five undiscovered photographs by Edith Irvine were found within a collection in southern California. They were all of San Francisco's 1906 earthquake and fire. Edith had visited the Irvine Ranch more than once during her lifetime and possibly gave them to the Irvine family. Subsequently, those photos plus the entire collection of 1906 earthquake photographs from James Irvine were published in a book: Two Weeks in San Francisco by Douglas Westfall and Henry C. Koerper, (The Paragon Agency, Publishers - 2006) and released in the city of San Francisco on April 18, 2006. Up to that time, a vast majority of Irvine's photographs had never been published.

She was convicted of plotting to assassinate members of the Japanese Imperial family. Early life Fumiko Kaneko was born in the Kotobuki district of Yokohama during the Meiji period in Japan. Her parents were Fumikazu Saeki, a man from a samurai family, and Kikuno Kaneko, the daughter of a peasant, and because they were not officially married, Fumiko could not be registered as a Saeki. She remained unregistered until she was 8 years old, at which point she was registered as her mother's sister, a fairly common practice for children born out of wedlock. Kaneko recalls that the first few years of her life were fairly happy, as her father was employed as a detective at a police office and cared for his family, though they were fairly poor. However, Fumikazu left his job at the police station, and the family moved around a considerable amount over the next few years. Fumikazu was also increasingly drawn to gambling and drinking, began to abuse Kikuno, and became involved with other women, including Kikuno's sister Takano. Eventually, Fumikazu left Kikuno and married Takano. During this time, Fumiko was first confronted with the problems of being an unregistered child. Her circumstances made her “invisible to educational authorities,” and she was not technically allowed to attend school.Ambaras, David R. (2006). Bad Youth: Juvenile Deliquency and the Politics of Everyday Life in Modern Japan. Berkeley: University of California. 41. Some schools eventually permitted her to attend classes, but she was not called in attendance, did not receive report cards, and was ineligible to receive the official certificate of graduation at the end of a class year. Despite these difficulties, including frequent gaps in her attendance, she did very well in school. After Fumiko's father left, her mother was involved with several other men, but none of these relationships led to better living circumstances and they were nearly always extremely impoverished. Kikuno even considered selling Fumiko to a brothel, claiming that it would be a better life for her, but she abandoned this plan when it turned out that Fumiko would be sent far away to another region of Japan. After several years of these difficult circumstances, Fumiko lived briefly with her maternal grandparents while her mother remarried again. In 1912, her father's mother, Mutsu Sakei- Iwashita, came to visit, and it was agreed that Fumiko would go back with her to her home in Korea, where she would be adopted by her aunt, who was childless. Before leaving Japan, Fumiko was finally registered as the daughter of her maternal grandparents. Life in Korea Shortly after her arrival in Korea, it became clear that Fumiko would not be adopted or provided with the higher level of living that she expected. For the first year or so, they kept up the pretense of including her in their family by allowing her to use the name Iwashita, but after that she was called Kaneko. Her grandmother introduced her to visitors as a child she had taken in out of pity from some people she barely knew and her grandmother and aunt treated her like a maid. It appears that they did initially intend to adopt her, but, at least from Fumiko's perspective, they decided quickly that she was too poorly brought up and unrefined to be their family heir. The only advantage she had was finally being able to attend school regularly, and even her education was limited because her relatives refused to let her read anything besides her required work for school. She was initially promised a high level of education that would eventually lead her to college, but they only allowed her to continue her schooling through the lower primary and higher primary grades and did not attempt to enroll her in a high school. After she finished school, she had to spend all her time working in the house, and she cites this period as the worst of her time in Korea. Fumiko was subjected to extremely poor treatment under her relatives in Korea. Despite their relative wealth, she was only provided with the bare minimum in terms of clothing and living circumstances, and was frequently beaten and deprived of food as a punishment for perceived wrongdoing, sometimes so badly that she contemplated suicide. Her time in Korea also allowed her to observe the mistreatment of the native Koreans by her relatives and other Japanese occupiers. Return to Japan In 1919, when she was 16, Fumiko was sent back to her maternal family in Japan, presumably because she was of marriageable age and her grandmother and aunt did not want to have to arrange a match for her. She stayed with her maternal grandparents again and began to form a strong relationship with her Uncle Motoei, who, because of the way she was registered, was officially her brother. By this time, she had reconnected with her birth father, living with him for short periods of time, and he attempted to arrange a marriage between Fumiko and Motoei. The arrangement fell through, because Motoei discovered that Fumiko had developed a relationship with another young man and claimed that her potential loss of virginity suggested by that relationship voided his agreement with her father. Fumiko was sent back to live with her father after this event, but her life there was unpleasant and she was not allowed to follow her desires for a serious education, so she decided to go to Tokyo and pursue a life there. Experiences in Tokyo When Fumiko arrived in Tokyo in 1920, she initially lived with her great uncle, but soon managed to get a position as a newspaper girl. She requested an advance on her wages in order to pay her enrollment fees at two different co-ed schools, and started to take classes in mathematics and English. Her job introduced her to a number of groups, most notably the Christian Salvation Army and members of the socialist movement who advocated their philosophies on the street. However, the job was difficult, her employer exploited his workers and was immoral in his personal life, and she hardly had any time to keep up with her school work, so she eventually quit. She then briefly maintained a relationship with the Salvation Army group, but she was not compelled by their beliefs and was abandoned by her one Christian friend after a time because he believed the feelings he was developing for her were threatening his beliefs. While she hoped to escape the hypocrisy she saw in this group by joining the socialist movement, she found that socialists could also behave in ways that seemed to contradict their beliefs, and she eventually abandoned them as well in favor of a more independent activism. Fumiko was able to attend school on and off in the midst of these life developments, and the major shift in her thinking, from socialism to anarchism and nihilism, began in 1922, when she met Hatsuyo Niiyama at her night school classes. In her memoirs, Fumiko calls Hatsuyo her “closest friend,” and mentions that she introduced her to foundational nihilist thinkers like Max Stirner, Mikhail Artsybashev, and Friedrich Nietzsche. Around this time, Fumiko was also introduced to a Korean activist named Pak Yol, who shared many of her ideas, and when she finally abandoned the socialist movement she worked with Pak to attempt to accomplish her vision. Fumiko Kaneko and Pak Yol Together, Fumiko and Pak published two magazines which highlighted the problems Koreans faced under Japanese imperialism (though they were never directly a part of the Korean independence movement) and showed influences of their radical beliefs. The articles Fumiko wrote for these publications were probably her most obvious activist activity. Sometime between 1922 and 1923, they also established a group called “Futei- sha (Society of Malcontents),” which Fumiko identified as a group advocating for direct action against the government. These activities soon brought Pak and Fumiko under government scrutiny. In September 1923, the hugely destructive Great Kantō earthquake led to massive public anxiety, with many people concerned that the Koreans, who were already agitating for independence from Japan, would use the confusion to start a rebellion. The government therefore made a number of arrests, mostly of Koreans, on limited evidence, and among those arrested were Pak and Fumiko. After lengthy judicial proceedings, Fumiko and Pak were convicted of high treason for attempting to obtain bombs with the intention of killing the emperor or his son. They confessed to this crime, and it appears that at least Fumiko made herself appear guiltier than she actually was, possibly with the intention of sacrificing herself for her cause. During the trial, Fumiko wrote the story of her life as a way of explaining “what made me do what I did,” and this memoir is the main source of information about her life, along with court documents. Pak and Fumiko, who had been romantically involved for most of their time together, were legally married a few days prior to their sentencing, which historian Hélène Bowen Raddeker identifies as a move to “underscore the obvious irony in the fact that the Japanese state had united them legally in life before uniting them legally in death.” Pak and Fumiko were initially given the death sentence, but an imperial pardon commuted that sentence to life imprisonment. Instead of accepting this pardon, Fumiko tore it up and refused to thank the emperor. While Pak survived his time in prison and was released years later, Fumiko was reported to have committed suicide in her cell in 1926, although there were suspicious circumstances around her death. Ideological views Though Fumiko considered the belief systems put forth by the Salvation Army group and the Socialists, she eventually settled on nihilism as her guiding philosophy. Her perception of nihilism changed over time, as is indicated by a statement she made to the court in 1925. She stated, in reference to the strictly negative version of nihilism she originally pursued, that “formerly I said ‘I negate life’... [but] my negation of all life was completely meaningless... The stronger the affirmation of life, the stronger the creation of life- negation together with rebellion. Therefore, I affirm life.” However, she also takes care to define what this affirmation of life means for a nihilist, which she expects to be very different from the perspectives of the officials: “Living is not synonymous with merely having movement. It is moving in accordance with one’s will… one could say that with deeds, one begins to really live. Accordingly, when one moves by means of one’s own will and this leads to the destruction of one’s body, this is not a negation of life. It is an affirmation.” The anarchist cause that she eventually followed was supported ideologically by her rejection of nationalism and the idea of the emperor, as well as a pessimistic belief about the nature of revolutions. In her testimony at her trial, she explained that she and Pak “thought of throwing a bomb [at the emperor] to show he too will die like any other human being,” and rejected “the concepts of loyalty to the emperor and love of nation” as “simply rhetorical notions that are being manipulated by the tiny group of privileged classes to fulfill their own greed and interests.” Initially, this rejection of the emperor system may have led her to believe in an alternative political system, but after seeing the way members of other groups behaved, she came to believe that any leader, whether the emperor, or other government officials, or a completely new government under socialists, would equally abuse power dynamics and oppress the people. For her, “[revolution] simply means replacing one authority with another,” and since she believed that no system of authority could or would operate without oppression, it is logical that she eventually directed her activities towards abolishing all authority. Though she believed, in line with nihilistic thought, that it was not possible to cure the evils in the world, her actions as an anarchist reflect her belief that “even if we cannot embrace any social ideals, every one of us can find some task that is truly meaningful to us. It does not matter whether our activities produce meaningful results or not… this would enable us to bring our lives immediately in to harmony with our existence.” While Fumiko did not formally associate herself with any sort of women's movement, she clearly held strong beliefs about the need for equality between men and women.Additional examination of Fumiko’s views about women’s rights can be found in . When her great-uncle repeatedly tried to persuade her to abandon the idea of education and “marry a working merchant,” she insisted that she could “never become the wife of a tradesman.” Though she does not appear to have fully verbalized her reasoning to her great-uncle, she states in her memoir that she wanted to be independent, “no longer… under the care of anybody.” Fumiko also expressed concerns that schools specifically for women did not provide equal opportunities, and committed to pursuing her own education only at co-ed schools. Finally, some of the hypocrisy she was most concerned about in the socialist groups had to do with their treatment of women in general, and her in particular. For instance, she broke off a relationship with a fellow socialist, Segawa, after he brushed off a question about the possibility of their relationship leading to pregnancy. She “expected him to take some responsibility,” and saw that she “was being toyed with and taken advantage of.” Within this context, she challenged the double standard that allowed men to participate in casual relationships without repercussions while women were expected to bear full responsibility for the possible consequences. Additionally, she saw this behavior as further evidence that these men were not truly committed to the ideas they espoused, as real socialism would require a greater level of equality.

Its entire length runs through Union County and serves as the primary connector between the towns of Waxhaw, Mineral Springs, and Monroe. The route roughly parallels a CSX railroad line for its entire span. Route description NC 200 NC 75 starts at the North Carolina-South Carolina state line, near Hancock, South Carolina. In South Carolina, it continues as SC 75 for to SC 5, in Van Wyck. Heading east from the state line, it becomes South Main Street in Waxhaw, where it connects with the southern terminus of NC 16, at Broome Street. Passing the Museum of the Waxhaws just outside town, it continues east to the town of Mineral Springs. It then goes northeast, passing Rocky River Road towards Monroe, where it ends abruptly at an auxiliary road to NC 200 (Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard). Before August 2011, NC 75 continued into downtown Monroe, ending at Charlotte Avenue. The entire route, with exception of within Waxhaw city limits, is known and labeled as the Waxhaw Highway. History The second and current NC 75 was established in 1934 as a renumbering of NC 25, it originally traveled from the South Carolina state line to US 74/NC 151 (Charlotte Avenue) in Monroe. Around 1957, NC 75 was extended east two blocks to NC 200 (Main Street), replacing part of US 74A. By 1962, NC 75 was extended again along Haynes Street/Skyway Drive to US 74/US 601 (Roosevelt Boulevard), in concurrency with NC 84 and NC 200. Between 1969 and 1982, the eastern terminus was moved back to Charlotte Avenue. On August 2011, the eastern terminus of NC 75 was truncated at the auxiliary road to NC 200 (Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard) after its completion as a bypass around Monroe. The first NC 75 was an original state highway (1921); it traversed from NC 18, in Lenoir, to the Virginia state line, northeast of Oxford. It went across the state, through several cities and towns including Statesville, Asheboro, Pittsboro, Chapel Hill, and Durham. In 1927, NC 90 replaced NC 75 from Lenoir to Pittsboro while it was also rerouted south, replacing NC 53 through Sanford to Rockingham. In 1934, NC 75 was decommissioned; replaced by US 220 (Rockingham to Ellerbe), NC 73 (Ellerbe to West End), NC 2 (West End to Pinehurst), and US 15 (Pinehurst to the Virginia state line). =North Carolina Highway 25= North Carolina Highway 25 (NC 25) was an original state highway that traversed from NC 20, in Monroe, southwest to SC 26, immediately across the state line. Around 1929, NC 25 was rerouted from Rehobeth Road to a more direct west route into South Carolina, towards Van Wyck. In 1934, the highway was renumbered as NC 75.

Design In appearance, the Jaguar Bass is largely faithful to the original Fender Jaguar, with exception of the neck, bridge, and pickups taken from both the Fender Jazz Bass and Fender Precision Bass, though the Jaguar Deluxe Bass has only Jazz bass components. Rather than the standard dot position markers, however, the Jaguar bass has aged pearloid block inlays, a feature generally reserved for premium instruments. The bass also has a standard vintage-style top-loading bridge and tuners. An onboard preamp is controlled by bass/treble boost rollers and an on/off switch located on the top control panel. The lower control panel holds on/off switches for each of the pickups, and a switch to toggle between parallel and series wiring of the pickups. Finally, the master control panel holds the master volume, master tone, and jack. Other features include an alder body, C-shaped maple neck, 7.25\\"-radius rosewood fretboard with 20 medium jumbo frets. The basic tone of the Jaguar Bass is very similar to its stablemate, the Jazz Bass, and retains the signature \\"growl\\" of the latter. The complex controls, however, lend it a unique tonal flexibility not found in any other Fender instrument. For example, Bass Player Magazine notes that the Jaguar Bass can \\"[deliver] a convincing P-Bass sound ripe for Motown fingerstyle.\\" Differences in models include: Fender Japan: first generation: 2005–2010.

Right-Handed versions only. Fender USA: 2014–present: Available in 3-Color Sunburst, Black, Olympic White, and Mystic Red. History In 1960, Fender introduced the Jazz Bass, which was originally known as the \\"Deluxe Model\\" (in relation to the previously released Precision Bass). Fender marketed the Jazz Bass as a stablemate to the Fender Stratocaster electric guitar, as it featured a narrower neck which was meant to appeal to jazz musicians. The following year, Fender released the Bass VI, which featured six strings and a short-scale neck. The Bass VI also had a switch-based control layout, and was essentially a precursor to the Fender Jaguar released in 1962. Fender produced the Jaguar electric guitar until 1975, when both the Bass VI and Jaguar lines were discontinued. However, the model was revived in 1999 due to the popularity of the Jaguar (and the similar Fender Jazzmaster) amongst indie rock musicians. From 2004 to 2006, Fender also produced the Jaguar Bass VI Custom, a cross between the Bass VI and the Jaguar. Prior to the forthcoming discontinuation of the Jaguar Bass VI Custom, Fender unveiled the Jaguar Bass at the 2006 annual NAMM show. The Jaguar Bass was originally made available in the United States in Black and Hot Rod Red with a matching headstock. Although the Jaguar Bass was also manufactured in Olympic White and 3-color Sunburst, these finishes were only available in the Japanese domestic market. The full range of finish options was launched globally in 2008. Variations =Squier Vintage Modified Jaguar Bass= 2010–present, available initially in Black, with Sunburst and Candy Apple Red models introduced in limited numbers starting in 2012. Right- Handed versions only. In 2010, Fender introduced the premium priced Squier Vintage Modified Jaguar Bass with a black body, matching headstock and pearloid block inlays. The bass is closer to the Jazzmaster than the Jaguar in appearance, due to the absence of any controls other than stacked volume/tone potentiometers similar in design to the early versions of the Jazz Bass. Other features include a P/J pickup layout, maple neck and rosewood fretboard. =Squier Vintage Modified Jaguar Bass Special= 2011–present, single coil version available in 3-Color Sunburst, Black and Crimson Red. Humbucker version in Black, Silver and Candy Apple Red. Right-Handed versions only. In 2011, the Jaguar Bass Special was introduced with the choice of P/J (\\"P\\" as in Fender Precision Bass and \\"J\\" as in Fender Jazz Bass, and mixes the sounds of both) or single humbucker pickups and Jazz Bass knobs/control plate. While the Jaguar Bass Special features a split-coil Precision neck pickup and a single- coil Jazz Bass bridge pickup paired with an active bass boost circuit and treble control, the Jaguar Bass Special HB uses a high-output humbucking pickup and a 3-band active EQ. Other features include a solid basswood or agathis body (depending the finish) and a maple neck with a 20-fret rosewood fretboard and pearloid dot inlays. The 5-string version was introduced in 2013. =Squier Vintage Modified Jaguar Bass Special SS= Released mid-2011, discontinued until further notice in 2019, available in Black, Candy Apple Red and Silver. Right-Handed versions only. This Short Scale model features a P/J set.

It was possibly a member of the Tyrannosauroidea, the clade that also contains Tyrannosaurus. Diplotomodon is only known from a single tooth, holotype ANSP 9680, found near Mullica Hill in either the Navesink or Hornerstown Formation, marine deposits dating to the Maastrichtian stage of the late Cretaceous period. Joseph Leidy originally described the tooth using the name Tomodon in 1865, considering it a carnivorous marine reptile, probably a plesiosaur.Leidy, J., 1865, Memoir on the extinct reptiles of the Cretaceous formations of the United States. Smithsonian Contribution to Knowledge. 14: 1-135 The generic name was derived from Greek τομός (tomos), \\"cutting\\", \\"sharp\\", and ὀδών (odon), \\"tooth\\". However, this name had already been used for the snake genus Tomodon Duméril 1853 and Leidy changed it in 1868 to Diplotomodon, adding a Greek διπλόος (diploos), \\"double\\", at that time suggesting it was a fish.Leidy, J., 1868, \\"Remarks on CONOSAURUS of Gibbes\\", Proceedings of the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia, 1868, 20: 200-202 The type species, Diplotomodon [=Tomodon] horrificus (Leidy, 1865) Leidy 1868 is the only species in the genus that has been described. The specific name horrificus is Latin for \\"dreadful\\". The tooth, with a preserved length of about three inches, is very broad, flat, and symmetrical and is not recurved.Weishampel, D.B., 2006, \\"Another look at the dinosaurs of the East Coast of North America\\", III Jornadas Internacionales sobre Paleontología de Dinosaurios y su Entorno, Salas de los Infantes, Burgos, Spain.

Revolutionary beginnings Born in a peasant family in Rybtsy (now part of Poltava in Ukraine), Muranov moved to Kharkiv in 1900 and worked as a railroad worker. He joined the Bolshevik faction of the Russian Social Democratic Labor Party (RSDLP) in 1904 and became a member of the local party committee in 1907. In 1912 Muranov was elected to the 4th State Duma from the city of Kharkiv and became one of 6 Bolshevik deputies there. Muranov was the only Bolshevik deputy (the other one, Roman Malinovsky, was later exposed as a secret police agent) who voted to break away from the rival Menshevik faction of the RSDLP on 15 December 1912.Robert B. McKean, St. Petersburg Between the Revolutions: workers and revolutionaries, June 1907-February 1917, New Haven, Yale University Press, 1990, pp. 140-1. After the outbreak of World War I in August 1914, Muranov and other Bolshevik deputies followed the lead of the exiled Bolshevik leader Vladimir Lenin, denouncing the war and calling on Russian soldiers to turn their weapons against their own government. Bolshevik deputies traveled around the country using their parliamentary immunity to foster revolutionary activities. They were arrested in November 1914, expelled from the Duma and put on trial on 10 February 1915 on charges of high treason. Facing the death penalty, some Bolshevik deputies and Lev Kamenev, who had been sent to Russia to direct their work in January 1914, wavered and moderated their position. Muranov, however, took an uncompromising approach, which enhanced his reputation within the Bolshevik party. In the end, the Tsarist government dropped most of the charges against the accused, who were skillfully defended by the future head of the Russian Provisional Government Alexander Kerensky and other lawyers. Muranov and other Duma deputies were exiled to the remote Turukhansk region of Siberia for life. The 1917 Revolution After the overthrow of the Romanov dynasty by the February Revolution of 1917, Muranov returned to the capital, Petrograd, with other Bolshevik exiles including Lev Kamenev and Joseph Stalin. On 12 March, he joined the Russian Bureau of the Bolshevik Central Committee and on 16 March he joined the editorial board of the Bolshevik newspaper Pravda. Muranov and Stalin were also made members of the Executive Committee of the Petrograd Soviet. Muranov used his political capital within the Bolshevik party, which he had earned with his behavior at the 1915 trial, to provide political cover for Kamenev, whose behavior at the trial had made him suspect in the eyes of rank and file Bolsheviks. Together, they took over Pravda and ousted its previous editors, Vyacheslav Molotov and Alexander Shlyapnikov. Once in control, they advocated conditional support of the newly formed liberal Russian Provisional Government \\"insofar as it struggles against reaction or counter-revolution\\". Kamenev, Stalin and Muranov also suggested that Bolsheviks should unite with the internationalist wing of the rival Menshevik faction of the RSDLP. These positions were adopted by the All-Russian Conference of the Bolshevik Party on 28 March-4 April 1917. When Lenin and Grigory Zinoviev returned to Russia on 3 April, they opposed the Kamenev- Stalin-Muranov line and called for a socialist revolution and a complete break with the Mensheviks instead. Once Lenin emerged victorious at the next All- Russian Bolshevik conference in late April 1917, Muranov was sent back to Kharkov to run the local Bolshevik newspaper, Proletarian. At the 6th Bolshevik Party Congress in late July and early August 1917, Muranov was elected to the party's Central Committee and became a member of its Secretariat. On 5 August, the Central Committee elected Muranov to its permanent bureau (uzkij sostav).USSR: Communist Party: 1917-1919 at www.archontology.org Political life Muranov participated in the Bolshevik seizure of power during the October Revolution of 1917 and was elected to the Bolshevik-dominated Presidium of the All-Russian Central Executive Committee at the Second Congress of Soviets. On 27 October, he became a member of the joint Bolshevik-Left Socialist-Revolutionary commission charged with preparing the Second Congress of Peasant Soviets in circumvention of the existing Central Executive Committee of Peasant Soviets.Yuri Georgievich Felshtinsky. Na Puti k Odnopartijnoj Diktature, Paris, Russian Social Fund for Persecuted Persons and their Families, 1985, Muranov was a Bolshevik candidate in the 1917 Russian Constituent Assembly election, being fielded in the Arkhangelsk constituency. As a member of the Bolshevik Central Committee, he supported Lenin during the intra-party debate over the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk in early 1918. Muranov was not re-elected to the Central Committee at the 7th Bolshevik party Congress in March 1918, but returned to the body after the 8th Congress in March 1919. He remained a member of the Central Committee until 1923. Between March 1919 and April 1920, he was a candidate member of the Central Committee's Orgburo.USSR: Communist Party: Orgburo at www.archontology.org During the intra-party struggles of the 1920s, Muranov was an ally of Joseph Stalin. At the 11th Party Congress in 1922 he was elected to the Central Control Commission, a member of which he remained until 1934. In 1923-1934 he was also a member of the Soviet Supreme Court. In 1934 he moved to the All- Russian Central Executive Committee. Muranov survived the Great Purge, which claimed the lives of most Old Bolsheviks, and was sent into retirement in 1939. He died in Moscow aged 86.

Life An influential French conservative and free market thinker, Rueff was born the son of a well known Parisian physician and studied economics and mathematics at the École Polytechnique. An important economic advisor to President Charles de Gaulle, Rueff was also a major figure in the management of the French economy during the Great Depression. In the early 1930s, he was as a financial attache in London, in charge of the Bank of France's sterling reserves. He was a member of the Société d’Économie Politique and was linked to the Éditions de Médicis. In 1941, Rueff was dismissed from his office as the deputy governor of the Bank of France, as a result of Vichy France's new anti-Semitic laws. Rueff published several works of political economy and philosophy during his lifetime, including L'Ordre Social, which appeared shortly after the Liberation of Paris After the war Rueff became one of the leading French members of the classical liberal Mont Pelerin Society, the president of the Inter-Allied Reparations Agency (IARA), and the minister of state of Monaco. He was strongly in favour of European integration and served from 1952 to 1962 as a judge on the European Court of Justice. He advised President Charles de Gaulle from 1958. That year, the Rueff Plan, also known as the Rueff-Pinay Plan, balanced the budget and secured the convertibility of the franc, which had been endangered by the strains of decolonisation. In the 1960s, Rueff became a major proponent of a return to the gold standard and criticised of the use of the dollar as a unit of reserve, which he warned would cause a worldwide inflation. A member of the Académie des Sciences Morales et Politiques, Rueff was elected to the Académie française in 1964. Foreseeing the emerging European Community's Common Market, Rueff recommended cutting barriers to competition in his second report. Along with co-writer Louis Armand and helped by an ad hoc committee of experts, the \\"plan Rueff-Armand\\", as the press called it, was published in 1960. The full title of the report is \\"Rapport du Comité pour la suppression des obstacles à l'expansion économique\\" (Report on suppressing barriers to economic growth). Rueff always remained a firm opponent of John Maynard Keynes. His first critique appeared in the Economics Journal, on the issue of transfers; specifically, German war reparations. Rueff was against such transfers in the late 1930s. In 1947, he critiqued Keynes' magnum opus, The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money. In 1958, US economist James Tobin became his main critic in the Quarterly Journal of Economics. Almost 30 years later, Rueff, repeated his beliefs in \\"The End of the Keynesian Era\\", which was first published in Le Monde.

It is one of the oldest and most prestigious private schools in Greece, after a very large number of students graduating from the school has excelled in politics, the arts, science and business. While at kindergarten and elementary school level no differentiation of school systems is made, high school is currently split into a German section (with students eventually graduating with the German high school diploma) and a Greek section (with students graduating with German and optionally an additional Greek high school diploma). Pupils take entry exams in order to become students of the latter section so the school is considered highly selective. However, the school is currently undergoing a transition phase towards a unitary high school system. Upholding the tradition of an environment friendly school, the German School of Athens had Greece's largest solar roof installed before the 2004 Olympic Games. The project was backed by German Federal Ministry of Economics and Labor (BMWA), the German Energy Agency and the Greek-German Chamber of Commerce and Industry.  School System(s)  The term \\"German School of Athens\\" really describes a complex of one kindergarten, one elementary school and a \\"split\\" (or dual) high school. For admission to kindergarten and elementary school, both following the German educational system, prospective pupils need to have achieved a reasonable level of competence in German for their age in order to be able to follow classes taught exclusively in German. For them to be admitted, they thus have to sit a short test or be interviewed by a member of the teaching staff. High school, or Gymnasium, at the DSA/ΓΣΑ is split, offering students a choice between the German and Greek section of the school: The German section follows a form of the German educational system optimised for German schools abroad, and pupils with no prior secondary education in Germany, at the DSA/ΓΣΑ itself, or at another German school sit a short test and/or are interviewed by the school principal to be admitted. This is to ensure they can easily follow lessons, which are held almost exclusively in German, with the exceptions of the following subjects: English Language, Greek Language and (Greek Orthodox) Religion. After their final year, students receive the German high school diploma (Abitur), formally \\"Allgemeine Hochschulreife\\" or \\"Reifeprüfung\\", and consequently often go on to study in Germany. The Greek section of the \\"split\\" high school follows the Greek educational system, allowing students to sit for Greek university entrance exams (Panhellenics) and gain their Greek high school diploma (Apolytirion) while simultaneously preparing students for a form of the German high school diploma examinations formally known as \\"Ergänzungsprüfung\\", allowing them easy entry into German universities. Pupils have to take entry exams in order to become students of the Greek section of Gymnasium. Lessons are held in both Greek and German. This duality of the separate sections has proven administratively challenging over the years. Therefore, the school is currently (2015/16) undergoing a transition phase towards a unitary high school system known as an \\"Integrierte Begegnungsschule\\", or \\"integrated communal school\\". Under this new regulation all high school students study towards a single degree, specially designed for German Schools abroad, the German International Abitur Examination (Deutsche Internationale Abiturprüfung, DIAP). Students are admitted to high school either after 4th grade (finishing German elementary school), or, having finished a Greek elementary school, after 6th grade; the latter are required to sit written and possibly oral entry examinations focused on (German) language competence. Lessons are held in both Greek and German (apart from foreign-language lessons English and French) for all students. However, instead of a one-size-fits-all model or splitting into sections, the school offers different \\"language profiles\\" for different students, allowing students to choose between curricula with a low (1), medium (2) or high (E) number of lessons taught in Greek. Those choosing the latter (E), will still have the option of sitting Panhellenic (Greek university entry) examinations. The first students to study under this new system will enter 5th and 6th grade in 2015/16 and graduate in 2020/21. Teaching staff at the DSA/ΓΣΑ are usually recruited from Germany for a period between 3 and 8 years, but a significant proportion of teachers have chosen to permanently live in Athens.  DSAMUN conference  The German School of Athens is known for its DSAMUN (Deutsche Schule Athen Model United Nations) conference. The conference is affiliated by THIMUN (The Hague International Model United Nations) and this makes DSAMUN conference one of the best conferences in the World. The DSAMUN is a three- day-long simulation of the work of the United Nations and takes place at the GSA campus. It is designed for secondary school students and is intended to provide an occasion for the participants to discuss world issues. The conference gives them the opportunity to experience the work of the United Nations and to get to know the world of diplomacy. The delegates at the DSAMUN conference are asked to prepare drafts resolutions and policy statements on various issues (from the view of the country they represent) and learn to negotiate and debate in a formal way. Foreign students, who attend DSAMUN, have the opportunity to visit Plaka, the National Museum, the Acropolis and other places of interest in Athens. In addition, excursions to Epidaurus and Nafplion are organized.  Dörpfeldianer Ball  The Dörpfeldianer Ball for graduates takes place every two years at the Hotel Athenaeum Intercontinental. It draws together people from the fields of politics, diplomacy, business, journalism and the academic world. The highlight of the Dörpfeldianer Ball is the debut of the 'débutantes' (female graduating students of the school) in dances like waltz and polka. The tradition of the débutantes signifies the step into adulthood and social life. The dress code is formal. Drama Groups The German School of Athens has at various times had between one and three drama groups staging plays in both the Greek, German and English language. These are classified as extracurricular activities or AGs (short for the German term \\"Arbeitsgemeinschaften\\"). While the English- and German language drama groups have been led by different members of the teaching staff over the years, and were periodically not offered as AGs, the Greek Drama Group had been consistently led by Mr. Stelios Papapetrou who in 2010 passed his experience and knowledge to Mrs. Elena Karakouli, the group's current leader. In the year 2010 the group celebrated its 30th anniversary, a time during which it had been awarded many times by theatre organisations in Greece. Most of the props and stage sets for the various plays are provided by the school's art department, particularly the Art and Stage Sets Group. Additionally, 20 graduates of the DSA/ΓΣΑ and former members of the school theatrical group are professional actors, such as Alexandra Pavlidou and Thalia Matika.  Greek Music Group The German School of Athens also has a Greek music group. The Group has been led for 15 years or more by philologists and musicians Dr. Giannis Mangidis and Dr. Theo Mangidis. Seven years ago Dr. Angelos Tylios, another philologist and musician, also joined the Group. The three teachers collaborate on stage with many students, who are either musicians or singers and they perform in front of the whole school more than 5 times per year. The group's best moment so far was the performance at Greek Music House (Megaro Mousikis) in 2005 for the celebration of the School's 110th birthday.  Extracurricular Activities (AGs) Extracurricular activities offered at the DSA/ΓΣΑ include: * Greek, German and English drama groups * an Art and Stage Sets Group * two orchestras and a chamber ensemble * two choirs * a Rock-Band * a Model United Nations group * debating, history, and chess clubs * as well as 25 sports groups, among them dancing, swimming, badminton, table-tennis and various kinds of team sport  Special Events  * DSA Open Day * Projects * Model United Nations conferences * European Youth Parliament * Educational trips to Germany * Exchange programs and participation in European educational programs in the Netherlands, Ireland, Turkey, Egypt and at various times also Germany, Austria, and Finland. * rock, Christmas and spring concerts by students and staff * plays staged by one of the drama groups Notable alumni * Kostas Axelos (1924–2010), Greek philosopher * Panagiotis Pikramenos, Judge and President of the State Court, announced as caretaker Prime Minister of Greece on 16 May 2012 * Dora Bakoyannis, former Greek Minister for Foreign Affairs, outgoing Mayor of Athens and winner of the 2005 World Mayor Award * Giannis Valinakis, former Greek Deputy Foreign Affairs Minister, former President of Hellenic Foundation for European and Foreign Policy * Georgios Rallis, former Prime Minister of Greece * Yannis Papathanasiou, former Greek Deputy Minister of Economy and Finance * Christos Verelis, former Greek Minister for Transport and Communications * Niki Goulandris, Deputy President of The Goulandris Museum of Natural History * Dimitrios Droutsas, former Greek Minister for Foreign Affairs * Nikos Perakis, film director * Kostas Sommer, actor * Mariana Efstratiou, singer and twice contestant at the Eurovision Song Contest References External links *School website *School graduates website *The official website of the DSAMUN conference, organized by the German School of Athens *DSA Summer Camp *\\"30 Years of Theatre\\", a collection of material by and about the Greek Drama Group spanning the years 1980-2010 Athens International schools in Attica Private schools in Greece Educational institutions established in 1896 1896 establishments in Greece Buildings and structures in North Athens Marousi ","title":"German School of Athens"},{"id":"4323467","text":"Holidays with Pay (Agriculture) Convention, 1952 is an International Labour Organization Convention.

Biography George Edward Anderson was born in Salt Lake City, Utah and apprenticed as a teenager under photographer Charles Roscoe Savage. At Savage's Art Bazar Studio, Anderson became friends with fellow apprentices John Hafen and John F. Bennett. Hafen later become an accomplished artist and Bennett was instrumental in preserving Anderson's glass plate negatives. At seventeen, Anderson established his photography studio in Salt Lake City with his brothers, Stanley and Adam. The railroad allowed Anderson to establish tent studios in Manti, Utah, Springville, Utah and Nephi, Utah. In 1886 Anderson opened a stationary studio he named Temple Bazar in Manti where the LDS Church was building a new temple. While in Manti he met Olive Lowry, whom he married on May 30, 1888. They were the second couple to be married in the newly finished Mormon temple in Manti, Utah. Later that year Anderson sold his Manti studio and moved to Springville. Anderson used his traveling tent studio, setting up in small towns throughout central, eastern, and southern Utah, where he documented the lives of residents in the years 1884 to 1907. =LDS mission= In 1907 Anderson was called to serve a mission in England. After traveling to the east to board his ship in April 1907, Anderson decided to take photos of religious landmarks. This culminated in almost a year taking photos in the Eastern United States. Anderson left the United States in April 1908 to travel to England where he proselyted and took photos. On March 27, 1910 Anderson was released from his mission, however, he stayed another year and a half while he continued proselyting and documenting the area with photography. Upon his return to America, Anderson took John Collett an eleven- year-old, crippled boy back to the states with him. Anderson returned to the United States setting up a photography studio in South Royalton, Vermont near the birthplace of LDS prophet Joseph Smith. He added a number of Church history site photographs, as well as portraits of Church members and local residents to his growing collection. In November 1913, almost seven years since Anderson left on his mission, he returned to his family and home in Springville, Utah. =Later years= After a seven-year absence his photographic business was unhealthy and his family life was strained. Business and money were not Anderson's motivating forces; art and religion were. Continuing to experience financial and marital strains, Anderson tried to revive his traveling tent studio but with little success. He was able to earn some money from the sale of The Birth of Mormonism booklet, which he published many years before. The last years of Anderson's life were spent in documenting families and life in Utah Valley and traveling to newly constructed temples. In 1923 he traveled to Cardston, Alberta, Canada with LDS Church authorities for the dedication of that city's LDS temple. He spent two years in Canada, returning to Springville in 1925. He became ill in the Fall of 1927, and despite his wife's urging not to go, Anderson went with LDS Church officials to document the dedication of a temple in Mesa, Arizona. It was his last trip. He died of heart failure on May 9, 1928 after being brought home to Springville, Utah.  Legacy  Although known as a portrait photographer, Anderson's studio portraits are complemented by thousands of documentary portraits taken near homes, barns, and businesses. These photos document families, small town Utah history, railroad history, mining history (including the Scofield mine disaster), and the building of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints temples. Landscape photography was not Anderson's main interest, but his photographs of Church sites are important documents of LDS history. He photographed these sites while traveling across the country to begin his LDS Church mission in England from 1909–1911. The Deseret Sunday School Union of the Church published some of the views, as Anderson called them, in a booklet entitled The Birth of Mormonism in Picture. Anderson was essentially unsung as a photographer during his lifetime, only in the last 30 years has Anderson been recognized for his photographic artistry. Primarily, the work of Rell G. Francis along with Nelson Wadsworth and Richard Holzapfel, has brought his work to the attention of this generation. Charles Reynolds, picture editor of the Popular Photography magazine, commented at a Brigham Young University photo seminar on 11 December 1973 about his introduction to Anderson's photographs. After attending an exhibition at the Springville Museum of Art, arranged by Rell Francis, he said \\"I go to shows several times a week in New York City . . . and I have rarely seen anything as impressive as those photographs. . . . It is awfully hard to astonish me. . . . The George Anderson pictures that I saw today weren't sensationalized pictures in any way. They were very sweet, beautiful, lovely pictures. . . .\\"Charles Reynolds, photo seminar, 11 December 1973, typescript from a recording made by the BYU Communications Department.

It links the Staffordshire and Worcestershire Canal (at Stourton Junction, affording access to traffic from the River Severn) with the Dudley Canal, and hence, via the Birmingham Canal Navigations, to Birmingham and the Black Country. History The Stourbridge and Dudley canals were originally proposed as a single canal in 1775, with a primary purpose of carrying coal from Dudley to Stourbridge. Robert Whitworth had carried out a survey, which was approved at a meeting held in Stourbridge in February, at which the estimated cost was promised by subscribers. The chief promoter was Lord Dudley, but the bill was withdrawn from Parliament following fierce opposition from the Birmingham Canals. Two bills were presented in the autumn, one for each of the canals, with the details largely unchanged, and both became Acts of Parliament on 2 April 1776, despite continued opposition from Birmingham. The Act allowed the promoters to raise £30,000, but unlike most such acts, did not make any provision for additional amounts. Thomas Dadford was appointed as engineer, with James Green as an assistant. Work started on the aqueduct which would carry the canal over the River Stour. The £30,000 of share capital had been spent by April 1778, and although not authorised to do so, the company issued bonds to raise more money. Construction was largely complete by 1779, and trading began. All of the canal was probably open by December. Dadford resigned in 1781, and the following year, a second Act of Parliament was obtained, to authorise the raising of an extra £10,000, and to legitimise the bonds already issued. The total cost was thus £43,000. Tolls on coal which originated on the canal and was then carried on the Staffordshire and Worcestershire Canal were higher than for other coal on that canal, and the Stourbridge Company had failed to get this clause repealed. They therefore sought to bypass the Staffordshire and Worcestershire Canal, and approached the Birmingham Canals in 1784, with a proposal for a link between the Dudley Canal and their system. This resulted in an Act to build the Dudley Tunnel, which opened in 1792. They also proposed a canal from Stourbridge to the River Severn at Diglis, which would have required two tunnels and 128 locks. The bill was rejected in 1786 when it reached the House of Lords, following opposition by the Staffordshire and Worcestershire company, but they reduced their tolls for Stourbridge coal two years later. A healthy trade in coal, ironstone and limestone developed, supplemented by iron products, bricks, clay, earthenware and glass. A dividend of 2.45 per cent was paid in 1785, which had risen to 6.3 per cent by 1789. =Operation= Trade continued to increase, reaching 100,000 tons in 1796, and continuing upwards as the iron and coal industries developed and the canal became part of a through route, following the opening of the Dudley Tunnel and the Dudley Canal's extension through the Lapal Tunnel to Selly Oak. Dividends increased steadily, with 13.75 per cent being paid in 1840. In order to maintain their position, they helped to fund the enlargement of Gad's Green reservoir, on the Dudley Canal, and also gave money to several coal mines to assist with pumping, on condition that the water was diverted into the canal. Stourbridge basin had to be enlarged in 1807 to cope with the volume of traffic. Further traffic came after 1815, when the Worcester and Birmingham Canal opened. Iron bound for London was shipped from Coalbrookdale via the canal and the Dudley's Selly Oak branch. In the 1820s, several wharves were built on the Fens Branch, to serve the developing collieries near Kingswinford, and the company considered applying for a new Act of Parliament in 1829, to give them powers to build extra lines in this area, but they did not proceed. Instead, plans were developed for the Stourbridge Extension Canal, which served a similar purpose and opened in 1840. On a more personal level, the lockkeeper at Stourton received a pay rise in 1830, as the locks were now in use all night and on Sundays, while the Stourbridge lock-keeper received a similar reward in 1834, and a larger one two years later. In 1836, 144,606 tons of coal were carried, besides all the other traffic. =Railway Age= In 1844, the Oxford, Worcester and Wolverhampton Railway (OWWR) announced their intention to build a line which would partly run parallel to both the canal and the Dudley Canal. Despite opposition by the canal company, the line was built and opened in 1852 and 1853. However, its effect was not immediately significant, and a proposed reduction in tolls was not deemed to be necessary. Some goods were transferred to the railway from a private basin, which ultimately led to an agreement on tolls for such transfers and the construction in 1858 of a transhipment siding on Stourbridge wharf. Trade held up well, derived from six ironworks and a tinplate works situated on the canal above the Stourbridge flight, traffic from the collieries on the Extension Canal, and various other industrial concerns, including fire-brick manufacturers and glassworks. In 1865, a new Act of Parliament introduced powers to charge mileage tolls for traffic using the upper level, but not passing through any locks. Income gradually dropped, and the dividend was below 8 per cent for the first time in 1873. For many canal companies, the Railway and Canal Traffic Act 1888 had a detrimental effect on revenue, but the Stourbridge tolls increased significantly, from £1,695 in 1894 to £2,718 in 1896. A programme of dredging and other improvements, which enabled local trade to continue, kept the company profitable until effective competition from road vehicles began. In 1929, tolls were £3,750, although revenue from other sources increased income to £5,270, and a 3 per cent dividend was paid. By 1938, the operating profit was just £222. Tolls were down to £1,278 in 1946, and commercial traffic continued to decline until it ceased. =Stourbridge Extension Canal= A separate company built the Stourbridge Extension Canal from the Fens Branch to Shut End (in Kingswinford) thus opening up another part of the coalfield to development. This passed into the hands of the West Midland Railway, the successor to the OWWR in 1860, which then became part of the Great Western Railway soon afterwards. It remained in use until after the Second World War. Most of it was then filled in, apart from a few yards at the Fens Branch end, which remain watered and serve as a mooring place. Course The canal leaves the Staffordshire and Worcestershire Canal at Stourton Junction, and immediately enters a four-lock flight to gain height. The pound above the locks is long, and crosses the River Stour on an aqueduct just before Wordsley Junction. At the junction, the Stourbridge Arm continues on the same level into the centre of Stourbridge, while a flight of sixteen locks takes the canal up the hill towards Pensnett Chase, where there were collieries. The bottom lock is just above the junction, and Leys Junction is just above the top lock. From here, the Fens Branch is a short, navigable feeder from Fens Pools and the main canal continues for to Delph Locks, a flight at the start of the Dudley Canal, which originally consisted of nine locks, but was rebuilt as eight in 1858. The canal forms part of the Stourport Ring, which is one of the popular cruising rings for leisure boating. The length of the route is , and it passes through 105 locks located on six inter-connected waterways. =Stourbridge Town Arm= At Wordsley Junction, the Stourbridge Town Arm heads south-east into the town of Stourbridge. The Stourbridge Town Branch Line railway was built in the 1850s from Stourbridge Junction railway station, via Stourbridge Town railway station to serve Stourbridge Basin. The basin was for interchange between the railway and the canal and this aided the canal's continued use. Restoration In 1958, the government-appointed Bowes Committee had listed the waterways which they thought ought to be retained for commercial operation, and the following year the Inland Waterways Redevelopment Advisory Committee (IWRAC) was set up to consider what to do with the rest. The Inland Waterways Protection Society, which had been formed in the East Midlands in 1958, produced a detailed proposal for the restoration of the Stourbridge and Dudley Canals, which they presented to the IWRAC in August 1959. The Inland Waterways Association also began campaigning for the waterway, after the Stourbridge flight was closed in 1960, to allow a bridge to be repaired. To assist their case, the Inland Waterways Association, in conjunction with the Staffs and Worcs Canal Society, organised a national boat rally at Stourbridge in 1962. British Waterways erected signs to announce that the Stourbridge flight could not be used, and the Stourbridge arm was already partially blocked by a shoal. After failing to get any assurance that the shoal would be removed, volunteers took action, and cleared the canal using a dragline excavator which they had borrowed. There were letters in The Daily Telegraph from both the IWA and British Waterways, which generated more publicity, and 118 boats arrived for the rally. Press coverage included sympathetic articles in The Times and The Daily Telegraph, local authorities showed support for a revived canal, and the role of the Staffordshire and Worcestershire Canal Society, who had jointly organised the event, was properly recognised. A \\"Closed\\" notice on the bottom lock following the 2008 breach The British Waterways Board published a report in January 1964, called The Future of the Waterways, in which they suggested that the case for retention of the Stourbridge Canal was borderline, but that if there was practical support from those interested in its survival, then that might alter the balance. With the 16 locks unnavigable, the Staffordshire and Worcestershire Canal Society (S&WCS;) proposed a restoration programme to the newly formed British Waterways Board in late 1963, where the navvying would be done by volunteers under the direction of British Waterways, who would also provide the materials. The Transport Act 1962 had paved the way for canals to be considered for their amenity value, rather than as purely commercial enterprises, and against this background, the S&WCS; proposal was accepted as a test case by the Board, and restoration began in 1964. Work of the canal was undertaken by weekend working parties, including members of the S&WCS;, the Dudley Tunnel Society and the Coventry Canal Society. A progress report issued by the IWA in April 1965 ultimately led to the formation of a publication called Navvies Notebook, which informed people about what was happening. It allowed volunteers to be drawn from a wider area, and in 1967, a record 45 people participated in a weekend working party on the canal. The canal was opened to through navigation again in May 1967. Following that success British Waterways went on to accept similar restoration working parties across the canal system. =2008 Breach= During flooding of the River Stour on 7 September 2008 a major breach occurred. This swept away a length of towpath and bank between Bellsmill and Stourton Locks, completely draining the pounds, including the Stourbridge Town Arm. The problem was caused by the River Stour flooding the area around the Stourbridge terminus, resulting in water level surges further along the canal. British Waterways restored navigation from the Dudley Canal, via Delph Locks and Wordsley Junction into the Town Arm fairly quickly. The canal was re-opened on 18 December 2008 after British Waterways completed repairs costing £650,000 ahead of schedule. The work included a concrete block constructed at the foot of the embankment to stabilise it.

It is no longer used clinically because it caused thrombocytopenia and platelet agglutination. It is now used solely to assay those functions in vitro in the diagnosis of conditions such as von Willebrand disease (vWD) and Bernard–Soulier syndrome. Platelet agglutination caused by ristocetin can occur only in the presence of von Willebrand factor multimers, so if ristocetin is added to blood lacking the factor (or its receptor—see below), the platelets will not clump. Through an unknown mechanism, the antibiotic ristocetin causes von Willebrand factor to bind the platelet receptor glycoprotein Ib (GpIb), so when ristocetin is added to normal blood, it causes agglutination. In some types of vWD (types 2B and platelet-type), even very small amounts of ristocetin cause platelet aggregation when the patient's platelet-rich plasma is used. This paradox is explained by these types having gain-of-function mutations which cause the vWD high molecular-weight multimers to bind more tightly to their receptors on platelets (the alpha chains of glycoprotein Ib (GPIb) receptors). In the case of type 2B vWD, the gain-of-function mutation involves von Willebrand's factor (VWF gene), and in platelet-type vWD, the receptor is the object of the mutation (GPIb). This increased binding causes vWD because the high-molecular weight multimers are removed from circulation in plasma since they remain attached to the patient's platelets. Thus, if the patient's platelet-poor plasma is used, the ristocetin cofactor assay will not agglutinate standardized platelets (i.e., pooled platelets from normal donors that are fixed in formalin), similar to the other types of vWD. In all forms of the ristocetin assay, the platelets are fixed in formalin prior to the assay to prevent von Willebrand's factor stored in platelet granules from being released and participating in platelet aggregation. Thus, the ristocetin cofactor activity depends only upon high-molecular multimers of the factor present in circulating plasma.

The bound antigen and antibody act as a unitary object, effectively an antigen of its own with a specific epitope. After an antigen-antibody reaction, the immune complexes can be subject to any of a number of responses, including complement deposition, opsonization, phagocytosis, or processing by proteases. Red blood cells carrying CR1-receptors on their surface may bind C3b-coated immune complexes and transport them to phagocytes, mostly in liver and spleen, and return to the general circulation. The ratio of antigen to antibody determines size and shape of immune complex. This, in turn, determines the effect of the immune complex. Many innate immune cells have FcRs, which are membrane-bound receptors that bind the constant regions of antibodies. Most FcRs on innate immune cells have low affinity for a singular antibody, and instead need to bind to an immune complex containing multiple antibodies in order to begin their intracellular signaling pathway and pass along a message from outside to inside of the cell. Additionally, the grouping and binding together of multiple immune complexes allows for an increase in the avidity, or strength of binding, of the FcRs. This allows innate immune cells to get multiple inputs at once and prevents them from being activated early. Immune complexes may themselves cause illness when they are deposited in organs, for example, in certain forms of vasculitis. This is the third form of hypersensitivity in the Gell-Coombs classification, called type III hypersensitivity. Such hypersensitivity progressing to disease states produces the immune complex diseases. Immune complex deposition is a prominent feature of several autoimmune diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis, scleroderma and Sjögren's syndrome. An inability to degrade immune complexes in the lysosome and subsequent accumulation on the surface of immune cells has been associated with systemic lupus erythematosus.  Functions  = Regulation of Antibody Production = Immune complexes can also play a role in the regulation of antibody production. B cells express B-cell receptors (BCRs) on their surfaces and antigen binding to these receptors begins a signaling cascade that leads to activation. B cells also express FcγRIIb, low affinity receptors specific to the constant region of IgG, on their surfaces. IgG immune complexes are the ligand for these receptors and immune complex binding to these receptors induces apoptosis, or cell death. After B cells are activated, they differentiate into plasma cells and cease to express BCR but continue to express FcγRIIb, which allows IgG immune complexes to regulate IgG production via negative feedback and prevent uncontrolled IgG production. = Activation of Dendritic Cells and Macrophages = Immune complexes, particularly those made of IgG, also play a variety of roles in the activation and regulation of phagocytes, which include dendritic cells (DCs) and macrophages. Immune complexes are better at inducing DC maturation than an antigen on its own. Again, the low affinity of many FcγR for IgG means that only immune complexes, not single antibodies, can induce the FcγR’s signaling cascade. When compared to single antibodies binding to FcγRs, immune complexes binding to FcγRs cause significant changes in internalization and processing of antigen, maturation of the vesicles containing the internalized antigen, and activation in DCs and macrophages. There are multiple classes of macrophages and DCs that express different FcγRs, which have differing affinities for single antibodies and immune complexes. This allows the response of the DC or macrophage to be tuned precisely, subsequently tuning the level of IgG. These diverse FcγRs cause different responses in their DCs or macrophages by initiating different signaling pathways that can either activate or inhibit cellular functions. The binding of the immune complex to the DC’s membrane-bound receptor and internalization of the immune complex and receptor begins the process of antigen presentation, which allows the DC to activate T cells. Via this process, immune complexes cause enhanced T cell activation. = Elimination of Opsonized Immune Complexes = Type I FcγRs, another type of IgG constant region receptor, can bind to IgG immune complexes and lead to the elimination of the opsonized complex. Immune complexes bind to multiple type I FcγRs, which cluster on the cell surface and begin the ITAM signaling pathway. This signaling pathway involves the phosphorylation of specific amino acids within a sequence of proteins and eventually leads to elimination of opsonized immune complex.

UIC (S) was formed in 1976 after the alliance of a number of Maoist groups carrying out military actions within Iran. The group prepared an insurrection starting in 1981, but it was dismantled by 1982. Although it has gone through several ideological changes, it has maintained a general Maoist viewpoint advocating that Iran is not a Capitalist society but a “semicolonial-semifeudal” one. In 2001 the UIC (S) became the Communist Party of Iran (Marxist-Leninist-Maoist).  History  =Foundation= The Union of Iranian Communists was founded in 1976 after the unification of the “Organization of Communist Revolutionaries” and “Pooya Group” (a remnant of “Palestine Group”). The term \\"Sarbedaran\\" was used later in 1981 after the organization armed its members in the forests near Amol in northern Iran in preparation for its armed uprising against the Islamic regime.ketab1131 This union was a minor group and mainly operated in student movements abroad. Theoretically, due to their Maoist stance, the UIC (S) backed the People's Republic of China in the Sino-Soviet Split and opposed currents such as those held by the Tudeh Party who backed the USSR. The UIC (S) expanded its activities inside the Iran after the Iranian Revolution in 1979 and some other groups such as “Group of struggle in the path of working class liberation” and “Red Battle” also joined. The UIC (S) did participate in some workers struggles at this time, such as “project syndicate of Abadan” and “Union of worker councils of Gilan” and also joined the war against the Islamic Republic in Kurdistan (and formed a guerrilla organization in Kurdistan named “Tashkilate Pishmargeye Zahmatkeshane Kordestan”). UIC (S) did also participate in peasant struggles in Turkaman, Sahra and Arab protests in Khuzistan. It also formed front organization such as “Militant Women Society” and “SETAD (Revolutionary Mass Organization of university and school Students)”. =Armed uprising= Group of Sarbedaran guerrillas in forest, during the Amol Uprising 1982 1982 was an important year in the history of the UIC (S) and the history of Maoism in Iran in general. In this year the UIC (S) mobilized forces in forests around Amol and launched an armed campaign against the Islamic Republic. It eventually organized an uprising on 25 January 1982. The uprising was eventually a failure and many UIC (S) and Maoist leaders were killed. =Aftermath= After the failure of the “Amol Uprising” the group went through a difficult period with most of its leadership and cadres arrested or killed. It also experienced various theoretical and political crises. In spring, 1983 the 4th council of Union of Iranian Communists was held and the union was reorganized. But again, most of the leadership and cadres were arrested and shot. In 1984 this union, together with Maoist organizations from all over the world, formed Revolutionary Internationalist Movement. In 1985 they again tried to organize militant struggle against the Islamic Republic but, again, this ended in failure. After this year they mainly operated in Kurdistan and against currents such as the Communist Party of Iran which they called \\"Reformist\\" and \\"Dissolvist\\". In the late '80s they dropped some of their old slogans and strategies such as \\"Peoples’ war in rural areas and uprising in cities\\", \\"Revolution Path\\" etc. Instead they launched a new strategy and their slogan became \\"Protracted People's War: siege the cities via Villages\\". They also formulated their current \\"Marxist- Leninist-Maoist\\" stance. =Rebranding= In April 2001 they held the 'Founding Congress of Communist Party of Iran (Marxist-Leninist-Maoist)' and after some debates they established the Communist Party of Iran (Marxist- Leninist-Maoist) on May Day, 2001. The Communist Party of Iran (Marxist- Leninist-Maoist) is seen as a continuer of the Union of Iranian Communists (Sarbedaran).

Most episodes revolve around Riff-Raff's get-rich-quick schemes or searches for food. Main characters =The Gang= The segment stars a group of cats who lived in a junkyard, lead by Riff-Raff. Riff-Raff The group is headed by Riff- Raff, an orange, short, tough, streetwise alley cat whose main residence is one half of an old transport plane which stands precariously at the top of a pile of junk overlooking the yard. Riff-Raff is a tough, but suave cat who fancies himself incredibly debonair even though he is an alley cat. He often has get-famous and/or get rich schemes, which form the basis of many of the episodes. He is shown always dressed with a blue scarf which he wears like a cravat and table leg which he uses as a cane, as well as a sideways cap. The other cats in the group are Hector, Wordsworth, and Mungo. Hector Hector, a brown and beige cat who speaks with a New Jersey accent, is sometimes depicted as feeling that he should be the head of the group, and becomes so on some occasions, such as the episode \\"Hector's Takeover\\". Riff- Raff and Hector's conflicts form the basis of a number of episodes. He is also second in command. Wordsworth Wordsworth, named after poet William Wordsworth, is a light-gray cat who wears roller skates, yellow headphones, sunglasses, and speaks in rhyme. In the episode \\"The Big Swipe\\", his full name is revealed as Wordsworth W. Wordsworth the 3rd. Mungo Mungo is a large, dim-witted, purple cat who acts as a lackey for Riff-Raff. Mungo is often seen wearing a red shirt with a red winter hat. Though dimwitted, Mungo has the skills of an idiot savant in cooking, and has astounding strength and fighting prowess. Mungo is a \\"gentle giant\\" and lighthearted in personality. =Cleo= Riff-Raff and his girlfriend Cleo Cleo is Riff-Raff's girlfriend, who lives in a music store. She is a cream-colored cat with long blonde hair. Her fur resembles a leotard and she wears a pair of pink legwarmers. The music store is constantly guarded by a sheepdog named Bush who has long hair and cannot see where he is going (a running gag involved Riff-Raff entering the store, then Bush attempting to chase Riff-Raff out and breaking a musical instrument in the process). In the flashback episode \\"Christmas Memories\\", it is revealed that Cleo is, in fact, one of the Catillac Cats herself, even going as far as to indicate that she coined the name. On more than one occasion, Riff-Raff ends up \\"two-timing\\" Cleo with another female cat (accidentally or otherwise). In fact, Riff-Raff agrees in one episode, \\"Kitten Around\\", to \\"go steady\\" with Cleo, but immediately falls for another cat named Roxy. As expected, Cleo is furious and soon gets payback. They both end up together again in the next episode. Sometimes Cleo is seen with another tomcat that Riff-Raff has to face off against. =Leroy= Another character, who also lives in the junkyard, is Leroy, a reddish-brown docked-tail hound dog with dark brown ears and a large spot over his right eye that resembles a black eye. He wears a nautical captain's hat. Leroy and the Catillac Cats have a love-hate relationship: Leroy often tries to chase them out, to no avail, though other times he is an ally, helping them chase out other outsiders. In the Christmas episode, it is revealed that Leroy is part of a gang put in charge of guarding the junkyard. The red and white Cadillac The group named itself the Catillac Cats after the red and white Cadillac that features prominently in their adventures. Hector, Mungo, and Wordsworth are shown to live in the car in the junkyard, while Riff-Raff has a more palatial home made out of a portion of a jet plane. The Cadillac itself has the ability to transform into an airboat and a camper. The camper possesses some additional parts, including a stove chimney and a TV antenna. When the car is shown transforming atop its customary mountain of trash, the extra parts are somewhat consistently shown to be shifted to stationary positions at the top of the junk pile (the chimney is even left attached to a small wood-burning stove always seen in the pile just below the car/camper). When the camper form is mobile, however, the parts simply vanish inside along with the other oddities of its transformation. In one episode, its car form is modified into a submarine. Despite usually being depicted with no tires, the Cadillac is also shown to be very fast. Its hood ornament is a silver trophy cup, and a blue and white striped wind-sock dangles from its radio antenna. Like all of the characters, the Cadillac is also featured in the credits (shifting from camper to car to boat). In many episodes, the car is used to drive around town. Association with Heathcliff Although both Heathcliff and The Catillac Cats are set in the city of Westfinster, only Hector, Wordsworth and Mungo appear in both segments. When the trio appears in Heathcliff episodes, Hector is depicted as the leader of the group. Riff-Raff and Cleo never appeared in a Heathcliff episode (though Riff-Raff is present in a crowd scene cheering for Heathcliff as he fights a dog, and is mentioned a couple of times), and neither Heathcliff nor any other characters from the Heathcliff series (with the small exception of the fish store owner who did have a brief cameo in one Catillac Cats episode) ever appeared in a Catillac Cats episode. The reason is unclear, but some suspect that the McNaught company who owned Heathcliff did not want any outside characters appearing on the series. Riff- Raff and Cleo were primarily invented by Jean Chalopin and Bruno Bianchi, while Hector, Wordsworth, and Mungo were created specifically so they could appear in either series. The only time Heathcliff and Riff-Raff appear on- screen together is in the end credits, when Riff-Raff snatches his hat back from Heathcliff. Hector, Wordsworth and Mungo never appear in any Season 2 episode of Heathcliff. =Appearances in the Heathcliff comics= The Catillac Cats (minus Wordsworth) appeared in a Heathcliff comic on July 20, 2016, which shows Heathcliff walking with them to the junkyard. The Catillac Cats (including Wordsworth) reappeared once again in the Heathcliff comic on February 20, 2018, in which the garbage men witness Heathcliff and the Catillac Cats sharing wild stories about the 80s. Alternate title In the end credits and on home videos, the Catillac Cats series is commonly referred to as Cats & Company as seen in the end credits, or Cats & Co.

Biography =Early life= William was born in Kassel, Hesse in 1743. His father, landgrave Frederick II (who died in 1785), had in 1747 abandoned the family and reverted to Catholicism. In 1755 he formally annulled his marriage. William's grandfather, Landgrave William, granted the newly acquired principality of Hanau to his daughter-in-law and grandsons. Technically, young William became the reigning prince of Hanau, while under his mother's regency. The young prince William, together with his two younger brothers, lived with their mother, the landgravine Mary. From 1747 they were supported by Protestant relatives and moved to Denmark. There they lived with Mary's sister, Louise of Great Britain, and her family; Louise died in 1751. =Marriage= On 1 September 1764, William married his first cousin, Wilhelmina Caroline of Denmark and Norway (1747–1820), who was the second surviving daughter of Frederick V of Denmark and Norway. They married at Christiansborg Palace and resided for two decades mostly in Denmark. In 1785 they moved to Kassel when William succeeded to the landgraviate. During the lifetime of his father, William had already received the Principality of Hanau, south of the Hessian territories near Frankfurt, as successor of its newly extinct princes. The Hanau people did not want to have a Catholic ruler. William's younger brother Charles in 1766 married another of their Danish first cousins, Princess Louise of Denmark. =Reign= Upon the death of his father on 31 October 1785, he became William IX, Landgrave of Hesse-Kassel. He was said to have inherited one of the largest fortunes in Europe at the time. William looked for help in managing his estate. He hired Mayer Amschel Rothschild as \\"Hoffaktor\\" in 1769, to supervise the operation of his properties and tax-gathering. The wealth of William's estate provided a good living for Rothschild and the men had a strong relationship; he founded the Rothschild family dynasty, which became important in financing and banking in Europe. Although they had been acquainted since 1775, William IX did not formally designate Rothschild as his overseer until 1801. The early fortunes of the Rothschild family were made through a conjunction of financial intelligence and the wealth of Prince William. During the Napoleonic Wars, William used the Frankfurt Rothschilds to hide his fortune from Napoleon. This money then saw its way through to Nathan Mayer, (N.M.) in London, where it helped fund the British movements through Portugal and Spain. The interest made from this venture was reaped by the budding banker barons, who used it to swiftly develop their fortune and prestige in Europe and Britain. It was not long before their riches outweighed those of their benefactor, William of Hesse-Kassel. In 1803, Landgrave William was created His Royal and Serene Highness The Prince-Elector of Hesse.http://www.london- gazette.co.uk/issues/17365/pages/997 In 1806 his electorate was annexed by the Kingdom of Westphalia, ruled by Jérôme Bonaparte, Napoleon's brother. William escaped to Denmark with his family and lived there in exile until the French were expelled from Germany. Following the defeat of the Napoleonic armies in the Battle of Leipzig, William was restored in 1813. He was a member of the Tugendbund, a quasi-Masonic secret society founded after the Battle of Jena–Auerstedt in June 1808 at Koningsberg. Several other prince-electors of the Holy Roman Empire had been recognized as kings at the Congress of Vienna (1815), and William attempted to join them by declaring himself King of the Chatti. However, the European powers refused to recognize this title at the Congress of Aix-la-Chapelle (1818) and instead granted him the grand ducal style of \\"Royal Highness.\\" Deeming the title of Prince-Elector to be superior in dignity to that of Grand Duke, William chose to remain an Elector, even though there was no longer a Holy Roman Emperor to elect. Hesse-Kassel would remain an Electorate until it was annexed by Prussia in 1866. He ruled until his death in Kassel in 1821. He was succeeded by his son William.

It encompasses the grounds of the former South Shore Country Club. The South Shore Country Club was founded in 1905 as a suburban counterpart to the urban clubs of Chicago, such as the Athletic Club. The original building was built at that time, designed by architects Marshall and Fox in a Mediterranean Revival style. In 1909, a theater was added, but in 1916, Marshall and Fox were engaged to design a newer building, still in the Mediterranean Revival style. This is the building that still stands. Originally built as a Protestant-only club, later, Irish-Catholics were admitted. Besides the main clubhouse, the Country Club also had stables, a nine-hole golf course, tennis courts, a bowling green, and a private beach on Lake Michigan. By the early 1960s, the character of the neighborhood was changing rapidly. As Hyde Park, Woodlawn, and South Shore became racially integrated, the wealthy whites who formed the membership in the club started to leave the neighborhood in droves. In 1967, the club considered opening its membership to Jews (for the first time since the 1930s) and African Americans (for the first time ever). The decision at that time not to open membership accelerated the decline of the club; in 1973, the decision was made to liquidate its assets, and in 1975, the property was sold to the Chicago Park District for $9.775 million. It was listed on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places in 1975. A coalition of neighborhood activists and historic preservationists successfully convinced the Park District not to demolish the buildings. Instead, the facility was renamed the South Shore Cultural Center. Over two decades, the main buildings were slowly renovated and repurposed. Other buildings were torn down. Today the Cultural Center houses the South Shore Cultural Center School of the Arts (youth and teen programs, community art classes, the Paul Robeson Theatre, a Fine Art Gallery, two dance studios, music practice rooms, and a visual arts studio with a kiln). In addition, there are banquet facilities for rent for weddings, receptions, and meetings. The golf course is still in operation, and is open to the public, as are the beach, picnic areas, gardens, and a nature center. The horse stables are currently used by the Chicago Police Department's mounted unit. The building houses the Parrot Cage Restaurant, which is operated as a teaching program of the Washburne Culinary Institute. The Chicago Lakefront Trail (abbreviated as LFT) is an 18-mile multi-use path in Chicago, Illinois along the coast of Lake Michigan and runs past the center. The center now competes with the Jackson Park 63rd Street Beach House and Promontory Point as South Side beachfront special use facilities in the Park District. The building's exteriors were used as the \\"Palace Hotel Ballroom\\" in The Blues Brothers. The Cultural Center was the site of Barack and Michelle Obama's wedding reception on October 3, 1992. On May 26, 2004, it became a Chicago Landmark.

She was the Norwegian Minister of Social Affairs from 1953 to 1955. She was born in Hof as a daughter of Casper Fredrik Solberg (1870–1932) and Zefra Eliagna Natterstad (1871–1949). She grew up in Eidsfoss, where her father managed Eidsfoss Station. Her mother was a hotelier. She commenced her studies in 1926, and took courses as a stenographer in 1927 and 1928. From 1929 she worked as a stenographer, in 1942 she left Norway due to World War II. She and her husband had been active members of the Norwegian resistance movement, among others starting the illegal newspaper Fri Fagbevegelse. She continued her work abroad, as a stenographer for the exiled Norwegian High Command in London. She was also a member of the program council of the exiled part of the Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation, from 1943 to 1945. Seweriin had been a member of Oslo city council from 1937 until the war broke out, and also served briefly in 1945. She was the deputy leader of the Workers' Youth League from 1937 to 1946. After the war she was a member of the Labour Party secretariat for women from 1945 to 1971--from 1953 to 1963 she chaired the secretariat, and was a member of the Labour Party's central committee. She was elected as a member of the Parliament of Norway in 1945 from the constituency Oslo, and was re-elected in 1949, 1953, 1957, 1961 and 1965. On 2 November 1953, she temporarily stepped out of parliament as she became Minister of Social Affairs in Torp's Cabinet. She had worked with social policy as a parliamentarian, but in an interview with Trond Nordby she confessed to having lacked a clear purpose with her position as Minister of Social Affairs. Legislative work in the ministry slowed, and as leader of the ministry she was clearly dominated by the bureaucrat staff, especially Karl Evang. She continued as Minister of Social Affairs until 1 August 1955, a few months after the formation of Gerhardsen's Third Cabinet. During this time, her seat in parliament was filled by Hjalmar Larsen, Aase Lionæs and Gunnar Alf Larsen. When she stepped down in 1969, her time of 24 years as a parliament member was a record for a woman in Norway. Seweriin was also a member of the board of the Norwegian Directorate of Labour from 1947 to 1953 and 1955 to 1967, and of the Norwegian National Opera from 1957. She was a member of several public committees, among others commenting on existing laws. From 1963 to 1971 she chaired Landslaget for språklig samling. Rakel Seweriin was married twice, first to teacher, journalist and writer Ernst Samuel Sørensen (1903–1972), then, from 1937, to physician Alf Christian Seweriin (1909–1961). She died in September 1995 in Oslo.

The program has a history of well-known affiliated faculty and of well-known program graduates. History The program was started in the first year of the Santa Cruz campus in a rather informal manner. A small group of faculty members, including the American historian Page Smith, philosopher Maurice Natanson, culture theorist Harry Berger, Jr., and psychology professor Bert Kaplan approached the University of California system-wide Graduate Council with a proposal for a new type of graduate program for the new campus. According to the founding Chancellor of the campus, Dean McHenry, they did not consult with him and the program was approved without his input. For over a decade, there were no direct faculty appointments to the program and all faculty teaching in the program was done by members of established Boards of Studies (at the time, the UC Santa Cruz equivalent of departments). This led to problems in budgeting and program continuity, and coupled with the unorthodox interdisciplinary nature of the program, it also presented challenges in placing History of Consciousness graduates in teaching jobs. The appointment of Norman O. Brown as Professor of Humanities in 1968 was in part intended to address some of these concerns. The first graduate student in History of Consciousness was Harvey Rabbin. Perhaps the best-known graduate of the program is Huey P. Newton, co-founder of the Black Panther Party. Newton received his Ph.D. in 1980. Faculty Historians Hayden White and James Clifford were among the first faculty members directly appointed to the department. White joined the faculty as Professor of History of Consciousness and Chair of the Board in July, 1978, having been recruited by then-Chancellor Angus Taylor to bring stability to the program. In addition to White and Clifford, Donna Haraway, Fredric Jameson, Teresa de Lauretis, Angela Davis, and Stephen Heath joined the program, while professors in other disciplines taught \\"HistCon\\" courses, supervised HistCon graduate students, and participated in new graduate student admissions. Among those most active at this time were political theorists John Schaar, J. Peter Euben, and Robert Meister, as well as philosopher David Hoy. Other notable faculty who have taught in the program: Herbert Marcuse, Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak, Victor Burgin, Kobena Mercer, Isaac Julien, Karen Barad, and Neferti Tadiar. As of November 2019, the non-emerita/emeritus members of the department's faculty include Banu Bargu, Carla Freccero, David S. Marriott, Robert Meister, Eric Porter, and Massimiliano Tomba. In 2018, Gopal Balakrishnan was the subject of an investigation regarding his violation of the university's sexual harassment policy. He was ultimately found guilty of violating it and was fired from the university.

Westbrae is \\"centered\\" on the intersection of Santa Fe Avenue and Gilman Street, although the main extent is east, south and west of this intersection, with the Albany city limit only a short distance north. It lies at an elevation of 79 feet (24 m). The neighborhood is mainly residential, with a small commercial section along Gilman from Santa Fe to Tevlin Street. In the past, businesses consisted of liquor and grocery stores but now are small restaurants, a natural food store, bakeries, and a nursery. The elevated tracks of the BART Richmond line cut diagonally across Westbrae, crossing over Gilman in the commercial section. There is a church called the Westbrae Bible Church located nearby on the corner of Hopkins and Ordway about three blocks from the center of the Westbrae neighborhood. The current, most notable business is the acclaimed Bay Area restaurant Lalime's. Until about 1979, the tracks of the Santa Fe railroad ran beside where the BART elevated and underground lines are today. Today, the Ohlone Greenway, a bicycle and pedestrian path, follows the old right-of-way. Paralleling the Santa Fe tracks to the east were the tracks of the Key System's G-Westbrae line. The \\"G\\" terminated at a small station just short of the city limits at Codornices Creek. The origin of Westbrae is directly connected to the Key System. The Key System was part of a larger enterprise which included real estate, the Realty Syndicate. The name \\"Westbrae\\" was given by the Key developers and included tracts north of Codornices Creek in Albany. A street through the heart of this area was, and remains, \\"Key Route Boulevard\\". There were future plans to extend the G-Westbrae line northward to serve the development area, but this never happened. The \\"G\\" remained a trolley shuttle between the terminal near Gilman and Santa Fe, connecting with the H transbay line at Sacramento Street and University Avenue instead of being extended and transformed into a full- fledged transbay line of its own. AC Transit operates a Transbay express bus line along Key Route designated G, and also an H line to this day; the designations are inherited from the Key System lines.

Members cooperate to deepen ecumenical unity in theological education and to broaden interfaith dialogue and understanding. The Consortium is one of the most diverse of its kind in the nation, as it includes Roman and Byzantine Catholic traditions, mainline Protestants, Evangelicals, and Historic Black Divinity schools; with partners in spiritual formation, Jewish, and Islamic education. A student enrolled at the master's level or above at a member institution may cross-register into courses offered by other member schools. In addition, a student or faculty member of one member institution may use and borrow from other institutions' libraries. Students (and members of the public) may also enroll in one of four Certificates of Study through the Consortium: Ecumenism, Muslim-Christian Studies, Ecology and Theology, and Criminal Justice and Reconciliation. Events for administrative consultation, faculty development, student dialogue, and public education are held throughout the year. In 2004, the consortium became the first group of its kind in the United States to include an Islamic graduate school, the Graduate School of Islamic and Social Sciences (GSISS), as an affiliate. The Consortium does shared programming with GSISS--now an institute, and with the Institute for Islamic, Christian, and Jewish Studies in Baltimore, the Paulist Father's House of Mission and Studies, and the Shalem Institute for Spiritual Formation.

The founding schools included the Catholic University School of Theology, the Dominican House of Studies, St. Paul's College, Wesley Theological Seminary, Virginia Theological Seminary, the Howard University School of Divinity, and the Lutheran Theological Seminary at Gettysburg. They joined forces to begin cross registration, library sharing, team taught Consortium courses, administrative consultations, and faculty development. In the early 21st century, schools have joined from Baptist, African-American, Reformed, and Byzantine Catholic traditions, and associates and affiliates have joined from institutes of Spirituality and Interfaith work, including the Shalem Institute, GSISS, and the Institute for Islamic Christian and Jewish Studies. The Board of Trustees of the Consortium has always included public trustees in order to check clericalism and school competition and to remind all members of the wider, public vision of theological education. Dedicated members of the Board have funded three annual public events: the Tachmindji Event for Interfaith Dialogue, the Figel Lecture in Ecumenism, and the Taha Al-Alwani Lectures in Muslim Christian Dialogues.  Programs and Services  The WTC offers core services of Library Borrowing, Cross-Registration of courses, and regular consultations between Presidents/Heads of Schools, Academic Deans, Librarians, and other administrative groups. It offers over 250 courses per semester for cross- registration, a dozen theological libraries with 2.2 million books and journals for research, and regular gatherings of school leaders to enhance their collaboration. In addition to member libraries, we have borrowing privileges with the Woodstock Theological Library at Georgetown University, the Taha Al-Alwani Library (formerly of GSISS), and an association with the Library of Congress that allows members to become research partners there. Theological faculties of member schools are served by the annual Faculties' Convocation, which addresses timely issues of theological education, and by interest area gatherings in Bible, Theology, History, Practical Theology, Worship and Homiletics, Arts and Religion, Science and Religion and more. Faculty area groups in Ecology and in Criminal Justice designed and oversee the Certificates of Study in those Areas, and the opportunities for team teaching or lectern exchanges are coordinated with the Academic Deans. Joint grant writing and publishing between faculty members are also encouraged through WTC networks. Students are served through a Student Board of the WTC, which has representatives from each of the theological schools. The Student Board develops and leads three student events a year: including an Opening Prayer Service and Dinner Conversations, a Pub Event (a quiz or informal faculty talk), and the spring Sermon Slam, with stellar preachers from each of the schools. They also plan and lead the annual Prayer Service for Christian Unity, which precedes the Figel Event on Ecumenism.  Public Outreach  The Public mission of the Consortium is defined by three annual public events. The annual Tachmindji Event for Interfaith Dialogue is made possible by an endowment given by Diane Tachmindji. The event has included notable speakers such as Dr. Leonard Swidler of Temple University, Dr. Marc Gopin of the Center for World Religions, Diplomacy, and Conflict Resolution at George Mason University; Dr. Lisa Schirch of the Center for Justice and Peacebuilding at Eastern Mennonite University; Joseph Montville, former U.S. diplomat and Senior Associate at the Center for Strategic and International Studies; Dr. Mohamed Abu-Nimmer of the School of International Service at American University, Khizr Khan, Esq., speaker at the DNC National Convention and Gold Star father of Cpt.

Henry Bull was one of the pioneers in the exploration of Antarctica.Henrik Johan Bull (Selected Families and Individuals) The Cruise of the 'Antarctic' (London & New York: Edward Arnold, 1896) Biography Henrik Johan Bull was born at Stokke in Vestfold County, Norway. He attended school in Tønsberg and worked for several years as a businessman in Tønsberg. During the late 1880s, he traveled to Melbourne, Australia, where he was associated with a company in shipping and trade. In 1893, Norwegian whaling and shipping magnate Svend Foyn agreed to financially support an Antarctica expedition led by Henrik Bull in search of the elusive Right whale. Svend Foyn was a businessman who patented the grenade-harpoon gun which was to be used for whaling. The ship provided by Svend Foyn was the Antarctic, a three masts barque equipped with a steam engine. It was also equipped with eleven harpoon guns, an arsenal of explosives, eight whaleboats and a thirty-one man crew. The ship was captained by Leonard Kristensen (1857-1911). The crew included Carsten Borchgrevink, who later lead the Southern Cross Expedition to Antarctica.Polar Record (Cambridge University Press) Over the course of the two-year expedition, they visited Tristan da Cunha, the Prince Edward Islands, Îles Crozet, Îles Kerguelen, the Balleny Islands, Campbell Island and Possession Islands. On 19 January 1895, a small party landed on Possession Island, a rocky island about 2 miles long. On 24 January 1895, a boat was put ashore with six men including Bull, Leonard Kristensen, Carsten Borchgrevink and seaman Alexander von Tunzelmann at Cape Adare, Antarctica. At the time they believed they were the first men to set foot on Antarctica – and they are certainly the best confirmed – but unknown to them sealer John Davis, had made a disputed claim that he stepped onto the Antarctic Peninsula much earlier in 1821.Antarctica first landings (Oracle Thinkquest) In 1898, Henrik Johan Bull wrote his memories of the expedition in his book, Sydover.

It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on March 24, 1996. The episode features Troy McClure, who tries to resurrect his acting career and squelch the rumors about his personal life by marrying Selma Bouvier. Show runners Bill Oakley and Josh Weinstein were fans of Phil Hartman and wished to produce an episode that focused on his character McClure. Freelance writer Jack Barth wrote the episode, and Mark Kirkland directed it. Barth's script underwent a substantial rewrite in the show's writing room, including the expansion of the Planet of the Apes musical and addition of the song \\"Dr. Zaius\\". The episode ran too long because of the slow pace of Troy and Selma's speech. Consequently, guest star Jeff Goldblum rerecorded his dialogue as MacArthur Parker at a faster speed. The episode received generally positive reviews, with particular praise given to Hartman's performance and the musical sequence. Entertainment Weekly placed the episode eighth on their list of the top 25 The Simpsons episodes. Plot Chief Wiggum stops Troy McClure for reckless driving and notices his driver's license requires him to wear corrective lenses. Because of his vanity, Troy dislikes wearing his glasses. He visits Selma Bouvier at the DMV and offers to take her to dinner if she lets him pass the eye test. After dinner, paparazzi photographers see Troy leaving with Selma and the story hits the news. His agent, MacArthur Parker, says that Troy can stage a career comeback if he continues seeing Selma. On his agent's advice, Troy asks Selma to marry him and she agrees. The night before the wedding, a drunken Troy tells Homer that he does not love Selma and is only using her as a sham wife to further his career. Marge and Patty try convincing Selma her marriage is a sham, but she accuses them of jealousy. She confronts Troy, who shamelessly admits that their marriage is a sham but claims she has everything she could want and will be \\"the envy of every other sham wife in town\\". Selma has her doubts but agrees to marry Troy because she fears being alone. Parker thinks he can get Troy the part of McBain's sidekick in McBain IV: Fatal Discharge if he sires children. Troy and Selma prepare to conceive a child, but Troy is uncomfortable sleeping with women because of his \\"bizarre fish fetish\\"; rumors of his unconventional sexuality once squelched his career and prevented his comeback. Selma decides that bringing a child into a loveless marriage is wrong and leaves Troy. A tabloid TV show confirms that Troy has turned down the role of McBain's sidekick to direct and star in his own film, The Contrabulous Fabtraption of Professor Horatio Hufnagel, produced by 20th Century Fox. Production Jeff Goldblum had to rerecord his dialogue as agent MacArthur Parker because the episode ran too long. Show runners Bill Oakley and Josh Weinstein were fans of actor Phil Hartman, who had been a recurring guest star since the second season. They decided to produce an episode entirely about his character Troy McClure to give Hartman as much to do as possible. Oakley wanted to explore Troy's character because he had never interacted with the show's other characters before, only appearing on television.Oakley, Bill (2006). Commentary for \\"A Fish Called Selma\\", in The Simpsons: The Complete Seventh Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox.Weinstein, Josh (2006). Commentary for \\"A Fish Called Selma\\", in The Simpsons: The Complete Seventh Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. The writers chose the plot idea of Troy's marriage to Selma Bouvier because she was \\"always marrying people\\". The episode's first draft was written by freelance writer Jack Barth, although the rest of the writing staff rewrote it. One aspect of the rewrite was the song \\"Dr. Zaius\\" from the Planet of the Apes musical, which the staff consider to be one of the greatest musical numbers ever written for The Simpsons. The two songs in the musical were composed by Alf Clausen, who had worked as a copyist on the original film of Planet of the Apes. Weinstein—who had not seen the film at the time—pitched it in the writer's room as \\"Rock Me Dr. Zaius\\", in parody of the 1985 song \\"Rock Me Amadeus\\" by Falco. It expanded into a full song primarily concocted by George Meyer, who included \\"corny\\" aspects of vaudeville. The line \\"From chimpan-A to chimpan-Z\\" in the final song of the musical was written by David X. Cohen. Oakley commented that he has heard the line \\"all over the world\\". Several of the staffers have commented on how writing the Planet of the Apes parody generated a great deal of enthusiasm in the writer's room: Oakley described it as \\"one of those rare bursts of creative brilliance. A lot of the things that people remember and love on The Simpsons were horrible late-night grinds, whereas this was just a magic visit from the joke fairy.\\" Director Mark Kirkland was pleased that Troy was the star of the episode; he enjoyed interpreting Hartman's voice performance because it allowed him and the other animators to \\"open [McClure] up visually as a character\\".Silverman, David (2006). Commentary for \\"A Fish Called Selma\\", in The Simpsons: The Complete Seventh Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. Due to the slow talking speed of Troy and Selma, the episode's audio track was 28 minutes long which meant that multiple scenes had to be cut, including Troy's bachelor party. After the cast had completed their original recording,Goldblum, Jeff (2006). Commentary for \\"A Fish Called Selma\\", in The Simpsons: The Complete Seventh Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. guest star Jeff Goldblum rerecorded his dialogue as MacArthur Parker at a faster speed to further shorten it. His character's design was loosely modeled on him, as well as a real-life \\"sleazy Hollywood agent\\". The animators watched several of Goldblum's films, including The Tall Guy, in order to get a better representation of his performance. Throughout \\"A Fish Called Selma\\", it is hinted that Troy engages in paraphilia. The writers initially did not know what the \\"unsavory\\" sexual preference would be, but eventually decided on a fish fetish, a suggestion from executive producer James L. Brooks, since it was \\"so perverted and strange, that it was over the top\\". At the episode's table reading, an attendee exclaimed that the line, \\"from now on she's smoking for two\\" has \\"got to go\\" from the script; however, her request was denied. On the walls of the Pimento Grove restaurant, the animators placed caricatures of every single guest star who had appeared on the show up to that point, as well as pictures of the fictional celebrities of the show.

It is also found in the non-canonical Gospel of Thomas. It describes a householder planting a vineyard and letting it out to husbandmen (tenants in some translations) who failed in their duties. A common Christian interpretation is that this parable was about the chief priests and Pharisees, and was given to the people present in Temple in Jerusalem during the final week before the death of Jesus. The parable > 33 Hear another parable: There was a certain householder, which planted a > vineyard, and hedged it round about, and digged a winepress in it, and built > a tower, and let it out to husbandmen, and went into a far country: 34 And > when the time of the fruit drew near, he sent his servants to the > husbandmen, that they might receive the fruits of it. 35 And the husbandmen > took his servants, and beat one, and killed another, and stoned another. 36 > Again, he sent other servants more than the first: and they did unto them > likewise. 37 But last of all he sent unto them his son, saying, They will > reverence my son. 38 But when the husbandmen saw the son, they said among > themselves, This is the heir; come, let us kill him, and let us seize on his > inheritance. 39 And they caught him, and cast him out of the vineyard, and > slew him. 40 When the lord therefore of the vineyard cometh, what will he do > unto those husbandmen? 41 They say unto him, He will miserably destroy those > wicked men, and will let out his vineyard unto other husbandmen, which shall > render him the fruits in their seasons. 42 Jesus saith unto them, Did ye > never read in the scriptures, The stone which the builders rejected, the > same is become the head of the corner: this is the Lord's doing, and it is > marvellous in our eyes? 43 Therefore say I unto you, The kingdom of God > shall be taken from you, and given to a nation bringing forth the fruits > thereof. 44 And whosoever shall fall on this stone shall be broken: but on > whomsoever it shall fall, it will grind him to powder. 45 And when the chief > priests and Pharisees had heard his parables, they perceived that he spake > of them. 46 But when they sought to lay hands on him, they feared the > multitude, because they took him for a prophet. – (King James Version) Exegesis The parable, according to the Q hypothesis, probably appeared first in Mark, then was copied and slightly altered by Matthew and Luke. Mark's source is in dispute, with the earliest tradition given by Papias as Mark's source being Peter. It is also found in the Gospel of Thomas as sayings 65–66, which some have suggested preceded the canonical Gospels, although its dating is still largely uncertain to scholars. Here is the version of this parable that appears in Thomas (Patterson–Meyer Translation): Verse 66 is a quote from Psalm 118:22–23. Many writers of the New Testament used this Psalm to sum up their understanding of Jesus' death as part of his role as the messiah.Kilgallen 227 It is notable that the Hebrew word for son, ben, is almost the same as stone, 'eben, which might be what generated seeing Jesus as a stone. Since the synoptics state Jesus said this in the Temple, this could reflect their view of Jesus as replacing the function of the Temple, bringing God's presence to humanity.Brown et al. 713 This could be seen as referring to the new Church's belief that they had superseded Judaism through Jesus' death, resurrection and role as the messiah. Others think it might be a reference to the Roman destruction of Jerusalem as seen by Christians as God's punishment for Jesus' death and their assumption that their new communities were the new Temple. Seeing Jesus as a \\"stone\\" to build on precedes Jerusalem's destruction, however. Paul, in his letter to the Romans chapter 9:33, refers to Jesus as a stone. Paul does not use the Psalms for his scriptural support but instead uses quotes from Isaiah 8:14 and 28:16. Luke stated, probably after Jerusalem's destruction, in Acts of the Apostles 4:11 that Peter used the same Psalm to describe Jesus shortly after Jesus' death. 1 Peter, which most scholars consider pseudepigraphal, uses both Isaiah and the Psalm as references in 2:6–8. Matthew's version states the method of killing the third servant, stoning, which the other versions lack. Stoning might be a reference to Christian martyrs' deaths, perhaps the death of James the Just. Matthew also has the priests and leaders say that the husbandmen should be killed,: New Century Version a joke on them when they later realize they are the husbandmen, whereas Mark and Luke have Jesus conclude the story himself in this way. Both Luke and Matthew have a statement about the stone's destructive power, which Mark lacks. Irenaeus used this parable to defend the link between Judaism's God and Jesus, in his Adversus Haereses.Irenaeus, Adversus Haereses, Book 4, Chapter 36 If one sees the servants as the Jewish prophets, then the owner who sent them must then be the same father of the son in the story, who are God the Father and Jesus, so the God of the Jews must also be Jesus' father. Interpretation The Sanhedrin, the supreme court of ancient Israel in the Temple in Jerusalem All the synoptic versions of the parable state that the priests of the Sanhedrin understood that Jesus' parable was directed against them, and thus that they are the husbandmen. The term husbandman is translated as tenant or farmer in the New International Version and as vine- grower in the New American Standard Bible. Workers often tended absentee estates and if the owner had no heirs the workers would have the first right to the land.Kilgallen 225 The tower and the winepress have been interpreted as \\"sanctuary\\" and \\"altar\\", respectively. The description of the vineyard is from Isaiah 5. Using a vineyard as a metaphor to describe Israel was a common practice for religious discourse at the time. It could also be God's covenant, or perhaps the world itself.Irenaeus, Adversus Haereses Book IV, Chapter 36 The produce made at the vineyard might be a metaphor for all the good produced by the people, which the authorities are not sharing with God, and trying to keep for themselves.Kilgallen 226 The owner of the vineyard is God and the son is Jesus. The traditional interpretation about the owner leaving the vineyard is expressed by Erasmus to argue that God leaving humans the free will to act, as is said by Bede the Venerable: \\"He seems to leave the vineyard so as to leave the keepers of the vineyard free choice of action.\\" A common interpretation of the servants is that of the Jewish prophets, although they could be all of God's preceding messengers.Brown et al. 621 The meaning of the \\"others\\" who will be given the vineyard is debated. Some proposed interpretations have seen them as other Jews, Gentiles (generally), Christians, or maybe even the Jewish Christians. They are usually seen as the new Christian community.Brown et al. 665 =Muslims view= Muslim scholars like Rahmatullah Kairanawi have discussed this parable in details. Rahmatullah Kairanawi interpreted the landowner as a metaphor for God, the vineyard as a metaphor for God's Law, the wall around it refers to that which God prohibited in the Law, the wine-press is a metaphor for the pleasures that are permitted in the Law. The husbandmen who rented the vineyard refers to the Jews. The servants who were sent repeatedly to the tenants to collect the fruits are God's prophets. The son of the landowner is a metaphor for Jesus, who is considered by Muslims to be one of the highly esteemed prophets. The stone the builders rejected is seen as a metaphor for Muhammad. Rahmatullah quoted this phrase from the parable \\"Anyone who falls on this stone will be broken to pieces; anyone on whom it falls will be crushed\\" and argued that this description fits Muhammad who triumphed during his life-time over all his enemies and against all odds. Muslims have also quoted the following Hadith of Muhammad in this context: > Narrated Abu Huraira: > Allah's Apostle said, \\"My similitude in comparison with the other prophets > before me, is that of a man who has built a house nicely and beautifully, > except for a place of one brick in a corner. The people go about it and > wonder at its beauty, but say: 'Would that this brick be put in its place!' > So I am that brick, and I am the Seal of the Prophets.\\"Sahih al-Bukhari, > Book of Virtues and Merits of the Prophet and his Companions, Chapter: The > Seal of all the Prophets, Hadith number: 44 See also * Life of Jesus in the New Testament * Luke 20 * Mark 12 * Matthew 21 * Ministry of Jesus Notes  References  *Brown, Raymond E. et al.

It is a timber with metal cladding construction, like many lighthouses in Queensland, made that way because it is cheaper than masonry, but also better suited for soft sandy soils. It was planned for only halfway up the point, but then it was realized the light wouldn't be visible to the north and so the tower was built on top of the point. The lantern was initially burning oil, then in 1923 vaporized kerosene was introduced. Later it was converted to electric power. In 1992 it was converted to solar power and demanned. The light characteristic is a single flash every 7.5 seconds, the focal plane is located 96 metres above sea level.

Clause was born on 2 December 1791, and was appointed a surgeon with the Royal Navy on 15 September 1813. In February 1826 he joined James Stirling's ship , serving with it until August 1828. Consequently, he was on board Success in March 1827 when it arrived at the Swan River, on an exploration expedition for the purpose of assessing the area's suitability for establishing a British colony there. After exploring the coastal waters off the Swan River, Stirling selected a party of eighteen men, including Clause, to explore up the river. About a mile north of the present-day location of The Causeway, a fresh water brook and lagoon was discovered, which Stirling named \\"Clause's Brook\\" and \\"Clause's Lagoon\\" respectively. These are now known as Claise Brook and Claisebrook Cove. The party camped at Clause's Lagoon on their first night. The party eventually travelled up the Swan as far as the junction with Ellen Brook. Before turning back, Stirling divided the party into three groups, sending them in different directions. Stirling and Clause explored to the west, where they found a fresh water brook, probably Bennett Brook. At the end of the expedition, Clause wrote a letter on the healthiness of the climate, in support of Stirling's observations on the territory, and Charles Frazer's comments on the soil. Some time later, Clause painted an oil painting of the party's camp at Clause's Brook. Believed to be based on a sketch by the expedition's artist Frederick Garling, it was etched and lithographed by the marine artist John Huggins, and published under the name Setting Camp of the Naval Survey Expedition at Clause's Lagoon, Western Australia. As Garling's paintings were considered part of the official correspondence of the expedition, they were not published, so Clause's painting was the only painting of the Swan River area to be published before the establishment of the Swan River Colony in 1829. Little is known of Clause's later life. In 1836 he married Mary Brooks at Hackney, Middlesex, England. He was still on the Navy lists as late as 1841, but was then listed as unfit for active duties. He died on 10 November 1852 at Milton-next-Gravesend, Kent at the age of 60.

In cellular automata, the Moore neighborhood is defined on a two-dimensional square lattice and is composed of a central cell and the eight cells that surround it. Name The neighborhood is named after Edward F. Moore, a pioneer of cellular automata theory. Importance It is one of the two most commonly used neighborhood types, the other one being the von Neumann neighborhood. The well known Conway's Game of Life, for example, uses the Moore neighborhood. It is similar to the notion of 8-connected pixels in computer graphics. The Moore neighbourhood of a cell is the cell itself and the cells at a Chebyshev distance of 1. The concept can be extended to higher dimensions, for example forming a 26-cell cubic neighborhood for a cellular automaton in three dimensions, as used by 3D Life. In dimension d the size of the neighborhood is 3d − 1. In two dimensions, the number of cells in an extended Moore neighbourhood, given its range r is (2r + 1)2. Algorithm The idea behind the formulation of Moore neighborhood is to find the contour of a given graph. This idea was a great challenge for most analysts of the 18th century, and as a result an algorithm was derived from the Moore graph which was later called the Moore Neighborhood algorithm. The following is a formal description of the Moore-Neighbor tracing algorithm: Input: A square tessellation, T, containing a connected component P of black cells. Output: A sequence B (b1, b2, ..., bk) of boundary pixels i.e. the contour. Define M(a) to be the Moore neighborhood of pixel a. Let p denote the current boundary pixel. Let c denote the current pixel under consideration i.e. c is in M(p). Let b denote the backtrack of c (i.e. neighbor pixel of p that was previously tested) Begin Set B to be empty. From bottom to top and left to right scan the cells of T until a black pixel, s, of P is found. Insert s in B. Set the current boundary point p to s i.e. p=s Let b = the pixel from which s was entered during the image scan. Set c to be the next clockwise pixel (from b) in M(p). While c not equal to s do If c is black insert c in B Let b = p Let p = c (backtrack: move the current pixel c to the pixel from which p was entered) Let c = next clockwise pixel (from b) in M(p). else (advance the current pixel c to the next clockwise pixel in M(p) and update backtrack) Let b = c Let c = next clockwise pixel (from b) in M(p). end If end While End =Termination condition= The original termination condition was to stop after visiting the start pixel for the second time. This limits the set of contours the algorithm will walk completely. An improved stopping condition proposed by Jacob Eliosoff is to stop after entering the start pixel for the second time in the same direction you originally entered it.

The station, which was once the terminus of a branch line from New Holland, is nowadays the terminus of the Barton line services operating from Cleethorpes. It is situated west of the resort. There is a connecting Stagecoach in Hull bus service from the town to Hull across the Humber Bridge which was introduced on the opening of the bridge to replace the New Holland Ferry. Approach to the branch was by a triangular junction at New Holland which enabled passenger trains to operate a New Holland Pier to Barton service in connection with the ferries and rail services from Cleethorpes and for freight to have direct access from the main line via Ulceby Junction. When the Humber Bridge opened the junction was removed and passenger services operated directly from Cleethorpes via the new platform at New Holland. History The station was opened as part of the branch line from New Holland to Barton-on-Humber in 1849. It was planned that the railway would extend westwards from Barton to Winterton and beyond, though this never happened. In the early years of the 20th century, plans were published, authorised in Parliament, and land bought and marked out on the ground, for the Barton Branch to link up with the North Lindsey Light Railway, at Winteringham. Initially, the plans were that the branch would join the Barton Branch via the coalyard, but this was later changed to an end on join to the 'main' line at Barton. People who owned property that would need to be demolished for this purpose were warned. Though the First World War was used as a reason to delay the extension, it was anticipated that post 1919, it would go ahead. A diversion of the A1077 was authorised for South Ferriby, and a crossing of Sluice Lane in Winteringham. Further pleas from Lindsey County Council, and the local MP were made to get the line built, including the reason of getting work for men to do in the 1920s. Even after the passenger service was withdrawn on the NLLR in 1925, the proposals were retained, and it was not until 1934 that plans to connect the Barton Branch and the NLLR were finally abandoned officially. At the same time as the proposal for a line from Winteringham to Barton was proposed, Immingham Docks was being built (started 1906, opened 1912). We can see the rationality of such a line for direct freight in to Immingham Docks - there was even talk of doubling the track on the Barton Branch, and a proposal for a new line direct from Barton to Goxhill so that the Goxhill - Immingham Docks Branch could serve the docks directly from Scunthorpe and Barton! Barton station was considerably larger until the early 1970s, but the old goods yard & buildings were all demolished by British Rail in 1973. The nearby bus station was added in 1981 when the Humber Bridge opened, whilst the station platform now in use was rebuilt to current specifications in 1998.

The service is now worked by a Class 153 all day - the practice of using a unit on the first service to Cleethorpes (which only used the doors on middle carriage of the three car unit due to it being longer than the platforms at many of the intermediate stations) ended at the December 2013 timetable change. However, since June 2018, this practice has been restarted. Freight services do not operate over the route aside from the occasional engineering train. A restriction now prevents mainline locomotives from entering the station. General goods facilities were withdrawn and the old goods yard closed back in the late 1960s, though the now-closed Albright and Wilson chemical works a mile or so to the east had a rail connection up until closure in 1988.Attractions and points of interest along the Barton lineFriends of the Barton Line; Retrieved 6 December 2013 This received regular trainloads of phosphoric acid from the company's plant in Cumbria until the early 1980s.\\"Freight operations on the Barton on Humber line\\"Lincolnshire Rail Gallery; Retrieved 5 May 2016 References External links Railway stations in the Borough of North Lincolnshire Former Great Central Railway stations Railway stations in Great Britain opened in 1849 Railway stations served by East Midlands Railway 1849 establishments in England Barton-upon-Humber ","title":"Barton-on-Humber railway station"},{"id":"4323933","text":"Nowhere Man may refer to:  Music  * \\"Nowhere Man\\" (song), a 1965 song by The Beatles ** Nowhere Man (EP), a 1966 EP by The Beatles featuring the song \\"Nowhere Man\\" * \\"Nowhere Man\\", a song by Anti-Nowhere League from We Are...The League * \\"The Nowhere Man\\", a song by The Veils from The Runaway Found  Film and television  * Nowhere Man (Taiwanese TV series), 2019 crime thriller drama series by Netflix * Nowhere Man (American TV series), 1995 drama series * Nowhere Man (Heroes), webseries based on the TV series Heroes * \\"Nowhere Man\\" (Law & Order), 2004 episode of Law & Order * \\"Nowhere Man\\", episode of TV series Haven * Nowhere Man, 1961 Soviet film starring Anatoli Papanov * Nowhere Man, 1991 Japanese film starring Jun Fubuki * Nowhere Man, 2005 film written and directed by Tim McCann * The Nowhere Man, 2005 film starring Lorenzo Lamas * Jeremy Hillary Boob or the \\"Nowhere Man\\", a fictional character from the 1968 Beatles film Yellow Submarine  Literature  = Comics = * Nowhere Man (comics), a title from Virgin Comics * Nowhere Man, a minor DC Comics character * Nowhere Man, a fictional character in the Malibu Comics series Protectors * \\"Nowhere Man\\", a chapter of the manga Peace Maker = Novels = * The Nowhere Man (Hurwitz novel), a 2017 novel by Gregg Hurwitz * Nowhere Man, a 2010 novel by John M.

The manager for this line is based at Portadown railway station, although the line extends to the border to include the Scarva and Poyntzpass halts and . Newry is on the fringe of the network, being the last stop before the border with the Republic of Ireland. The line follows the route of the northern half of the main Dublin–Belfast line, with the exception of calling at Belfast Great Victoria Street. Northern Ireland Railways operates an intensive local service on this line between Belfast and Lisburn, with other services operating to and from Portadown. Local services are operated with C3K trains, constructed by CAF, Spain. A less intensive local service operates from Newry, with only four local services a day operating from there. A single service operated by Iarnród Éireann also runs on weekday mornings between Newry and Dublin Connolly along the Belfast–Dublin line, calling at all stations in between. The station does, however, adequately meet passenger demand as a calling point on the popular Enterprise express service, which operates between and Dublin Connolly. These trains call at and stations at two hourly intervals throughout the day. The Enterprise also serves Lurgan and Lisburn at scheduled frequencies on Sundays. This service is operated in partnership with Iarnród Éireann . Translink announced in March 2006 that planning permission was sought from Newry and Mourne District Council to construct a new railway station to the east of the existing station at Newry. Platform improvement and extension is proposed, as are replacement canopies, a track maintenance building and a new 'Park and Ride' facility. Alongside this, a major upgrade is currently taking place to refurbish all the stations on this line with the exception of Bangor, Lanyon Place and Great Victoria Street. This project is estimated to cost £7 million Most NIR services continue on through Great Victoria Street and stop at stations on the Bangor line before terminating at Bangor.  Route  = Belfast =  Belfast Central Railway  Heading south from , the line passes under the Ormeau Road at the former gasworks- This is also where Ormeau railway station was sited, until its closure in 1885. The line snakes its way through an S-shaped cutting until it reaches Botanic station, where passengers intending for Queen's University Belfast and Botanic Gardens alight. The line enters the 270 metre-long Botanic Tunnel, which takes it under Botanic Avenue, University Road, and Lisburn Road (where Windsor railway station was located until its closure in 1885), after which it emerges just before City Hospital station. Crossing under Donegall Road, the line splits in two at City Junction, with most trains veering right along the Blythefield Curve to reach the triple track at Westlink Junction that takes them to Great Victoria Street. Trains reverse at Great Victoria Street and then proceed back down the triple track as far as Westlink Junction, but then carry on straight to Central Junction where there is a chord connecting to City Junction allowing trains- normally the Enterprise- to bypass Great Victoria Street. This arrangement creates a triangular junction with City Junction at the east corner, Westlink junction at the north and Central Junction at the south.  Great Northern Mainline  The line continues south from Central Junction, running through the numerous residential lands of South Belfast and roughly following the route of the A1 road. Immediately after Central Junction it passes under the Donegall Road once more as well as Tate's Avenue, before passing behind Windsor Park and reaching Adelaide halt, where a maintenance depot built on the site of the former freight yard is located. Continuing south, Lislea Drive sidings are passed on the right before the line crosses Stockman's Lane (Part of the Outer Ring) and passes Balmoral halt, Musgrave Park Hospital, and then Finaghy halt. At Finaghy is evidence of the GNR's plan to upgrade the line to quadruple track, with the Finaghy Road North bridge having been built with two double-track arches. The line then passes under the M1 motorway and Black's Road before reaching Dunmurry halt. The only level crossing between Belfast and Lisburn is located in Dunmurry on the Glebe Road, with a passenger foot crossing adjacent at Sunnymede Park. After passing over the Kingsway, Derriaghy halt is reached, and shortly thereafter, Lambeg and, the final intermediate halt on this section, Hilden. Entering Lisburn city proper, the line skirts Wallace Park before arriving at Lisburn railway station itself. = Lisburn = A small yard exists at Lisburn station, typically used by permanent way vehicles and, until recently, the storage of redundant stock. Lisburn is also the junction for the single-track Antrim branch, which runs adjacent to the double-track Newry line through the Lisburn suburbs, creating the illusion of triple-track. These lines pass under Thiepval Road and Causeway End Road in a deep cutting before reaching the former site of the second Knockmore halt, staggered across the Ballinderry Road bridge and demolished in 2014. After passing under the Knockmore Road, future site of Lisburn West railway station and site of the original Kockmore station, the Antrim Branch diverges to the right. Prior to 1956, this was also the junction for the Banbridge, Lisburn and Belfast Junction Railway's line to Hillsborough, Dromore, Banbridge and onwards to Castlewellan and Newcastle. This part of line runs through an industrial estate, with the Coca-Cola bottling plant to the right. The section between Lisburn and Moira is generally flat and straight. After crossing the Lissue Road on the level trains pass the former site of Damhead halt, and before reaching Moira will have passed other former halts at Broomhedge and Maze. The line then crosses the A26 Glenavy Road and enters Moira station.  Moira  Moira boasts the oldest extant railway building in Ulster, and along with Lisburn is an excellent example of restored GNR architecture. Immediately after leaving the station the line crosses the Lagan Canal on the Askew Bridge, and then runs parallel to the M1 motorway as far as Kilmore, where the railway passes under it. Kilmore is the site of the short-lived Pritchard's Bridge railway station, with the rest of the way to Lurgan being composed largely of agricultural land. Entering Lurgan from the north-east, the line crosses the Antrim Road and Lake Street on the level before passing under the Kilmaine footbridge and reaching Lurgan station.  Lurgan  Lurgan station was briefly known as Craigavon East for a time back in the 1970s. Immediately after the station, the line crosses William Street on the level and proceeds through the Lurgan suburbs, passing under the Eastway and running on a causeway between the two balancing lakes at Craigavon. Running behind Rushmere shopping centre, the line comes parallel with the Northway. It then passes under the M12 motorway and the site of the former Goodyear halt (Which served the nearby Goodyear Tire factory), and slightly further down the line, the site of the former Seagoe station, which was a temporary terminus during construction of the line to Portadown. The site of the first and third Portadown stations is passed, which today is a small maintenance yard with a siding. The line crosses its first, and only river- The Bann- and arrives at Portadown station. = Portadown = The current (Fourth) Portadown station is on the same site as the second one, and was formerly the junction between the mainline and the lines to Armagh and Derry Foyle Road. For a time in the 1970s it was known as Craigavon West. Most non-Enterprise trains, save for couple of peak commuter services, terminate here. The line leaves Portadown by means of a 90° curve to the southeast, adjacent to Portadown South Sidings, and once free of the suburbs runs parallel to the Cusher River, Newry Canal and River Bann as far Moneypenny's Lock, where the latter leaves the railway and veers towards Gilford. Continuing alongside the Canal towpath, the line runs through agricultural surroundings as it passes the former site of Tanderagee station, closed in 1965, before reaching Scarva station.  Scarva  Scarva was formerly the junction with the line to Banbridge via Laurencetown, which closed in 1955. The line continues out of Scarva station, still following the Newry Canal past Lough Shark and bypassing the village of Acton shortly before reaching Poyntzpass station.  Poyntzpass  Poyntzpass station retains a single siding, used by NIR as a loading point for ballast trains with stone brought in by road from a quarry near Banbridge. Poyntzpass is also home to the only GNR signal cabin still in its original location on NIR. The line continues to hug the Newry Canal, crossing it twice about halfway between Poyntzpass and Jerretspass. On the approach to Newry, the remains of Goraghwood railway station, once an important junction with the lines to Armagh and Warrenpoint, are passed, whilst the railway and canal part ways. The railway crosses the A28 and then the 18-arch Craigmore Viaduct, which takes it into Newry station. = Newry = Newry is the terminus of all local NIR trains, with the only trains extending further being the Enterprise and a daily Iarnród Éireann commuter service to Dublin. The line carries on south, crossing the A25 on MacNeill's Egyptian Arch. The embankment the railway is carried on soon becomes a cutting and the line is crossed by the A1 dual carriageway, the main road from the North to Dublin. From here the two run parallel as far as Cloughoge Chapel, where the railway diverges into another cutting before diving under the A1 again just north of Killeen. The railway then bypasses Meigh, in the shadow of Slieve Gullion, and passes the site of the long-closed station at Adavoyle. Finally, at Milepost 59 1/2, the line crosses the border and becomes Iarnród Éireann's Northern Line. Newry Canal Towpath Passengers can alight at Portadown, Scarva and Poyntzpass to access the towpath of the Newry Canal.

Located near Checkpoint Charlie, it was an influential club in the techno subculture from 1993 to 1997 and was eventually transformed into an all-purpose venue. History =Techno club= The club was operated by Hille Saul, Andreas Rossmann, Ralf Regitz and Lee Waters, while permanent resident DJs were DJ Disko, DJ Clé, Jonzon, Woody, Terry Belle and English Hazel B. International DJs were invited to perform at club events. On Fridays, the \\"Dubmission\\" parties were held, with resident DJs Kid Paul and Paul Van Dyk. Van Dyk paid homage to the club in 1998 by naming the remix for one of his most notable tracks, \\"For An Angel\\", the \\"PvD E-Werk Club Mix\\". =Venue= On 24 July 1997 the substation building closed as a techno club; however, the building was refurbished and reopened in 2005. The heritage-protected area that the building is located in maintains the unique architecture that was based on the plans of architect Hans Heinrich Müller. The building, built between 1926 and 1928, was badly damaged during World War II, but in 2014 the original quadrant-shaped control room at its centre remains intact—it is considered the oldest surviving architectural remnant of Germany's electricity industry. Following refurbishment, the building is now used as a venue that spans across multiple levels. In the 2001, the IT entrepreneur Holger Friedrich acquired the E-Werk from Bewag.

The station is managed by Abellio ScotRail and is on the Ayrshire Coast Line south of Glasgow Central, as well as the Glasgow South Western Line north of Stranraer. British Transport Police maintain an office here. The station has the most frequent service in Ayrshire, being served by all trains on both the Ayr main line and the branches to Ardrossan Harbour and Largs.  History  The station was opened on 23 March 1840 by the Glasgow, Paisley, Kilmarnock and Ayr RailwayButt (1995), page 133 and was built as an interchange, seeing traffic coming from Glasgow, Ayr and Ardrossan (and later Largs). Station facilities The station is located on Byers Road about from the town centre. There is a staffed ticket office, a toilet, a kiosk, a waiting room and a ticket vending machine. Train running information is offered via digital CIS displays, automated announcements, timetable posters and customer help points on each platform. In 2012, a new 130-space car park opened. In 2019 the station went under accessibility upgrades to add lifts to a new crossbridge and step-free access to all platforms. Station usage The station is popular with commuters travelling to Glasgow from Ayrshire and beyond. It is the last stop before the Ayrshire Coast line splits in two, so trains stop at this station more than any other in Ayrshire. British Transport Police The station houses a Neighbourhood Policing Team (NPT) from the British Transport Police. Officers from Kilwinning cover all stations south of Kilwinning and north of Kilwinning until ; Police Scotland officers will cover if British Transport Police officers are not available.

Other names for 3 Enoch include The Book of the Palaces, The Book of Rabbi Ishmael the High Priest and The Revelation of Metatron. Most commonly, the Book of Enoch refers to 1 Enoch, which survived completely only in Ge'ez. There is also a Second Book of Enoch, which has survived only in Old Slavonic, although Coptic fragments were also identified in 2009 Content Modern scholars describe this book as pseudepigraphal, as it says it is written by \\"Rabbi Ishmael\\" who became a \\"high priest\\" after visions of ascension to Heaven. This has been taken as referring to Rabbi Ishmael, a 3rd generation Tanna and a leading figure of Merkabah mysticism. However, this Ishmael lived after the destruction of the Second Temple in 70 CE and thus could not have been High Priest. An alternative identification would be the earlier Tanna Ishmael ben Elisha, who lived through the Siege of Jerusalem but is not attested as a High Priest either. The name Sefer Hekhalot (Hekhalot meaning palaces or temples), along with its proposed author, places this book as a member of Hekalot or Merkabah mysticism. Its contents suggest that 3 Enoch's contents and ideas are newer than those shown in other Merkabah texts.Swartz, Scholastic Magic, 178ff The book does not contain Merkabah hymns,. it has a unique layout. and adjuration.Schäfer, The Hidden and Manifest God, 144. All these facts make 3 Enoch unique not just among Merkabah writings, but also within the writings of Enoch. 3 Enoch contains a number of Greek and Latin words. The book appears to have been originally written in Hebrew. There are a number of indications suggesting that the writers of 3 Enoch had knowledge of, and most likely read, 1 Enoch. Some points that appear in 1 Enoch and 3 Enoch are: * Enoch ascends to Heaven in a storm chariot (3 Enoch 6:1; 7:1) * Enoch is transformed into an angel (3 Enoch 9:1–5; 15:1–2) * Enoch as an exalted angel is enthroned in Heaven (3 Enoch 10:1–3; 16:1) * Enoch receives a revelation of cosmological secrets of creation (3 Enoch 13:1–2) * The story about precious metals and how they will not avail their users and those that make idols from them (3 Enoch 5:7–14) * Hostile angels named 'Uzza, 'Azza, and Azaz'el/Aza'el challenge Enoch before God (3 Enoch 4:6) and are mentioned again in passing (5:9) The main themes running through 3 Enoch are the ascension of Enoch into Heaven and his transformation into the angel Metatron.

He cultivated an epistolary relationship with important Hispanic pensadores of that time, Leopoldo Alas (Clarín) in Spain, José de la Riva- Agüero in Peru, and, most importantly, with Rubén Darío, the most influential Latin American poet to date, the founder of modernismo. As a result of his refined prose style and the modernista ideology he pushed, Rodó is today considered the preeminent theorist of the modernista school of literature. Rodó is best known for his essay Ariel (1900), drawn from The Tempest, in which Ariel represents the positive, and Caliban represents the negative tendencies in human nature, and they debate the future course of history, in what Rodó intended to be a secular sermon to Latin American youth, championing the cause of the classical western tradition.G Brotherton, ‘’Arielismo’’ in P Hulme ed., The Tempest and Its Travels (London 2000) p. 216-7 What Rodó was afraid of was the debilitating effect of working individuals' limited existence doing the same work, over and over again, never having time to develop the spirit. Among Uruguayan youth, however, he is best known for Parque Rodó, the Montevideo park named after him. For more than a century now, Ariel has been an extraordinarily influential and enduring essay in Latin American letters and culture due to a combination of specific cultural, literary, and political circumstances, as well as for its adherence to Classical values and its denunciation of utilitarianism and what Rodó called \\"nordomanía\\" (explained below).A Vaughan, Shakespeare’s Caliban (Cambridge 1991) p. 148  Literary characteristics  Ariel belongs to the movement known as modernismo, characterized by its elegance, artistic prose, and worldly references and allusions. Even though it is an essay, its ideas are expressed through Prospero's narrative voice.G Brotherton, ‘’Arielismo’’ in P Hulme ed., The Tempest and Its Travels (London 2000) p. 216-7 Prospero, the teacher, and Ariel are references to the characters in William Shakespeare's The Tempest, and the use of their names is an example of modernismo's desire for cosmopolitism. In Ariel, Prospero's seminar includes both famous and lesser-known European authors.A Vaughan, Shakespeare’s Caliban (Cambridge 1991) p. 148 and p. 154 He makes frequent reference to Goethe, Gaston Deschamps, St. Francis of Assisi, Schiller, and Guyau. Prospero also focuses on locations such as Ancient Greece, and he emphasizes Hellenic beauty as the only ideal worthy of imitation. Rodó uses Ariel as a metaphor that symbolizes beauty, the spirit, and that which is good. The opposite of Ariel is the utilitarian, symbolized by Caliban, and he cites positivismo and nordomanía as two reasons why this movement has gained popularity. Ariel is structurally based on binary opposition, and the figures of Ariel and Caliban are diametrically opposed.A Vaughan, Shakespeare’s Caliban (Cambridge 1991) p. 153 Monument to José Enrique Rodó in Parque Rodó  Classical culture  In Ariel, Rodó surveys the situation Latin America was facing at the end of the 19th century. He points out that utilitarianism relies on specialization and materialism, and that consequently, the wealth of our minds is affected. Such practice can and will affect the spirit. In order for Latin America to revive its spirit, Rodó proposed strict adherence to the aesthetic ideals of the Greek and the Roman cultures. He believed both of these embody a sense of beauty, and most important, both realms recognize the significance of devoting oneself to an activity of the mind. Art is then a form of learning that finds and enriches the spirit and negates utilitarianism.  Denunciation of utilitarianism  Rodó denounced pragmatic utilitarianism, i.e. the philosophical movement that considered utility as the way to bring the most happiness to all those affected by it: “the name Ariel means the affirming of an idealist sense of life against the limitations of utilitarianism”.Quoted in G Brotherton, ‘’Arielismo’’ in P Hulme ed., The Tempest and Its Travels (London 2000) p. 217 He furthers his argument by stating that utilitarianism causes certain individuals to become specialized in very specific fields and as an effect of such specialization, they end up receiving an incomplete, deformed education. Rodó argues that due to specialization, an individual could be a genius in one aspect of life and completely inept in another. Rodó describes this as the mutilation of the person, because without a general understanding of life through knowledge, the person is no longer complete. The specialization of jobs causes societies to become underdeveloped as opposed to evolving towards maturity. It is this specialization that causes societies to arrive at mediocrity, and as Rodó informs us, another culprit of mediocrity is democracy as it is applied today. This is a strong statement, and Rodó justifies it by clarifying that because democratic societies give power to the masses, whom he deems less capable of making good decisions; but he is not against democracy but rather shows many ways in which its weak points can be strengthened,A Almandoz, Modernization, Urbanization and Development in Latin America (2014) p. 44 pointing for instance at the importance of the most capable educating the rest of society to pull the average upwards instead of letting the trend be the opposite.  The concept of \\"nordomanía\\"  Rodó warns against \\"nordomanía,\\" or the attraction of North America, and yankee materialism.M Lallosa, Neighbourly Adversaries (2007) p. 17 His thought reflects on history, when the United States was growing in the Western Hemisphere, especially in Latin America early in the 20th Century.A Vaughan, Shakespeare’s Caliban (Cambridge 1991) p. 150 Rodó echoes the importance of regional identity and how it should be rooted deeply into every country. However, to create and maintain regional identity proves difficult at times due to outside cultural and economic influence. There were many examples in Rodó's immediate past, mainly the Spanish–American War of 1898. Rodó posits that even though outside influence from other countries may be beneficial, it might destroy the principles on which that particular country or region were based from their origin. This is why Rodó argues that it is the responsibility of Spanish-American youth to help form and maintain regional and cultural identity to the best of its potential.Essay \\"Ariel\\" 1900, Montevideo.

South San Francisco Bay, California. Dunaliella salina orange-colored water of the salt lake Sivash. Dunaliella salina is a type of halophile green micro-algae especially found in sea salt fields. Known for its antioxidant activity because of its ability to create large amount of carotenoids, it is used in cosmetics and dietary supplements. Few organisms can survive like D. salina does in such highly saline conditions as salt evaporation ponds. To survive, these organisms have high concentrations of β-carotene to protect against the intense light, and high concentrations of glycerol to provide protection against osmotic pressure. This offers an opportunity for commercial biological production of these substances. History Dunaliella salina was named by Emanoil C. Teodoresco of Bucharest, Romania after its original discoverer, Michel Felix Dunal, who first scientifically reported sighting the organism in saltern evaporation ponds in Montpellier, France in 1838. He initially named the organism Haematococcus salinus and Protococcus. The organism was fully described as a new, separate genus simultaneously by Teodoresco and Clara Hamburger of Heidelberg, Germany in 1905. Teodoresco was the first to publish his work, so he is generally given credit for this categorization. Morphology Species in the genus Dunaliella are morphogically similar to Chlamydomonas reinhardtii with the main exception being that Dunaliella lack both a cell wall and a contractile vacuole. Dunaliella has two flagella of equal length and has a single cup-like chloroplast that often contains a central pyrenoid. The chloroplast can hold large amounts of β-carotene, which makes it appear orange-red. The β-carotene appears to protect the organism from long-term UV radiation that D. salina is exposed to in its typical environments. D. salina comes in various shapes and symmetries depending on the conditions in its current environment. Reproduction and lifecycle D. salina can reproduce asexually through division of motile vegetative cells and sexually through the fusion of two equal gametes into a singular zygote. Though D. salina can survive in salinic environments, Martinez et al. determined that sexual activity of D. salina significantly decreases in higher salt concentrations (>10%) and is induced in lower salt concentrations. Sexual reproduction begins when two D. salina’s flagella touch leading to gamete fusion. The D. salina zygote is extraordinarily hardy and can survive exposure to fresh water and to dryness. After germination, the zygotes release up to 32 haploid daughter cells.Lerche W. Untersuchungen über Entwicklung und Fortpflanzung in der Gattung Dunaliella. Arch f Protistenkd. 1937; 88:236–268. Commercial production of β-carotene From a first pilot plant for D. salina cultivation for β-carotene production established in the USSR in 1966, the commercial cultivation of D. salina for the production of β-carotene throughout the world is now one of the success stories of halophile biotechnology.Ben-Amotz A.

Harlow: Longman Scientific and Technical Press; 1989. pp. 91–114. Anti-oxidant & nutritional supplement Due to the abundance of β-carotene, which is an anti-oxidant as well as a vitamin A precursor, D. salina is a popular pro-vitamin A food supplement and cosmetic additive.Mokady S, Abramovici A, Cogau U. The safety evaluation of Dunaliella bardawil as a potential food supplement. Food Chem Toxicol. 1989;27:221–6. D. salina may also be a source of vitamin B12.Kumudha A, Sarada R. Characterization of vitamin B12 in Dunaliella salina. J Food Sci Technol. 2016;53:888-894. Glycerol D. salina lacks a rigid cell wall, which makes the organism susceptible to osmotic pressure. Glycerol is used as a means by which to maintain both osmotic balance and enzymatic activity.Craigie JS, McLachlan J. Glycerol as a photosynthetic product in Dunaliella tertiolecta Butcher. Can J Bot. 1964;42:777–778. D. salina preserves a high concentration of glycerol by maintaining a cell membrane with low permeability to glycerol and synthesizing large quantities of glycerol from starch as a response to high extracellular salt concentration, which is why it tends to thrive in highly salinic environments. Attempts have been made to exploit the high concentrations of glycerol accumulated by D. salina as the basis for the commercial production of this compound. Although technically the production of glycerol from D. salina was shown to be possible, economic feasibility is low and no biotechnological operation exists to exploit the alga for glycerol production.Chen BJ, Chi CH.

Located between Comox and Campbell River, the park includes a foreshore area in the Strait of Georgia, much of the Black Creek estuary, and a forested area. According to its Master Plan, it fulfills primarily a recreational role with a focus on beach play, picnicking, nature appreciation, and camping, and a secondary conservation role with a focus on the natural shoreline and estuary. I support of its recreational focus the park is developed with a day-use parking area with accessible trails leading to the shoreline and a camping area with 200 drive- in sites. The park is also hosts a nature centre building and a sheltered group picnic shelter. Vegetation in the park is typical for the region's second-growth forests with Douglas-fir most prominent. Common associates include Western hemlock, Sitka spruce, red alder and bigleaf maple. Salal and sword fern are the most abundant shrub. Black Creek, which flows through the park, is a spawning area for coho salmon. History Archaeological findings show that the Coast Salish used the area, though only one stone tool (a hammerstone) has been discovered within the park boundaries. The land was surveyed in 1886 and 1893 into individual lots for forestry use, primarily hemlock and fir, and it was all logged shortly after. A second cut was taken in the 1920s and 1930s. The property was purchased by a private citizen, Frank Pottage, in 1948 with the intention to subdivide and develop it for residential purposes. To achieve road access to proposed waterfront parcels, Pottage and the provincial government entered into an agreement involving the province purchasing 57.5 hectares for park purposes, 6 hectares at the mouth of Black Creek being gifted to the province, and the construction of a public road that would access both the park and the proposed residential lots. Miracle Beach Drive was constructed in 1952 and a year later, Seaview Road and the first set of residential lots were created adjacent to the park land. The provincial government officially established the Miracle Beach Provincial Park as a Class A park with in 1950 with Order-in-Council 2259. The following year, an additional south of the park was purchased from Pottage and added to the park. The foreshore component, which had remained crown land, was added to the park in 1956. A nearby property owner later donated of wetland that drains into the Black Creek estuary to be added to the park as an exclave. Several origins of the \\"Miracle Beach\\" name have been put forward. According to BC Geographical Names, it is the location where a messenger of the Great Spirit in the form of a lost and starving man was befriended by the We Wai Kai Other origins are that this is the place where the We Wai Kai witnessed a woman being turned to stone creating Mitlenatch Island, that this area was left untouched by a major forest fire that destroyed the surrounding areas, and that presence of several old growth trees despite forest fire and logging clearing the region is a miracle. Recreation and facilities For recreational purposes, the park is used for beach enjoyment, swimming, nature appreciation, scenic viewing, picnicking and camping. There are two day-use parking areas off Miracle Beach Drive where there is numerous pedestrian and wheelchair accessible paths to the beach. The forested trail network runs parallel to the beach and to Black Creek with branches off to the parking and camping areas. On the southern end of the beach there is an outdoor picnic area with a changehouse, flush toilet and water tap, as well as a picnic shelter suitable for hosting groups or events. The Miracle Beach Nature House is a nature centre, constructed in 1958 and the second such nature centre constructed in a BC provincial park located in the park which features natural history displays and offers seasonal educational programs. Outside the Nature House is an amphitheatre with a projection screen. Approximately of the park is used as a campground with 200 vehicle accessible campsites. The campground is also developed with a shower building, a sani-station for disposing sewage from recreational vehicles, a playground, and several water taps and outhouses. As the park is within the service area of the regional water system, which includes the Oyster River area down to Seaview Road, the water taps provide treated drinking water. The campground is open from April to October with limited off-season camping in March. Park usage has increased over the decades with the expansion and addition of facilities from 54,211 day users and 14,183 campers in 1980 to 88,451 day users and 52,564 campers in 2015. Geography and ecology Miracle Beach Park comprises , with approximately of shoreline along the Strait of Georgia on the east coast of Vancouver Island. The beach component of the park extends outward approximately from the shoreline to the tide's low water mark. The tide floods this sandy foreshore area twice daily. The extensive beach area is an intertidal sandbar, the result of coastal sediment transport from Williams Beach, and other nearby shorelines, driven by winds and waves from the southeast, as well as sediment from spilling out from Black Creek and Oyster River. Following this sediment transport pattern, the sands of Miracle Beach are being transported northward to Saratoga Beach. The shoreline is composed of a cobble and gravel surface with driftwood logs. Native species growing in the saline environment of the shoreline include gumweed, American dunegrass, Vancouver wildrye. The intertidal area is heavily trafficked by park visitors but animal life that can be found there include sand dollar, purple shore crab, green shore crab and green burrowing anemone. Coho Salmon swim up Black Creek from the sea in the fall. The terrestrial portion of the park lies within what the province terms the Coastal Western Hemlock Biogeoclimatic Zone, based on the climax vegetation, in the very dry maritime subzone (CWHxm1).http://cfcg-forestry.sites.olt.ubc.ca/files/2012/12/mapCWH4.gif The air masses coming from the Pacific Ocean loses much of its moisture as it passes the Vancouver Island Ranges, resulting in this area experiencing warm summers with little rain but wet winters. This leads to western hemlock being the potential dominant tree species. However, in second-growth forest the most abundant tree is usually Douglas-fir. Western redcedar and grand fir grow in the drier nutrient-rich sites and red alder and bigleaf maple grow where disturbance has resulted in sun exposure, like along the borders of clearings. In the mature forest areas, shade-tolerant plants grown in the understory, such as red huckleberry, salal, Oregon grape, sword fern, and vanilla-leaf. Most of the park's soils were mapped as well-drained gravelly loamy sands or sandy loams (Dashwood-Shawnigan complex, mapped as \\"D-S\\") and classified as brown podzolic in a soil survey published in 1959.*Soil Survey of Southeast Vancouver Island and the Gulf Islands However, the abundance of bleached sand grains on forest trails is evidence of an albic horizon characteristic of podzols.

History In 1959, the Province of British Columbia purchased Mitlenatch from a local family and in 1961 it was designated as a Provincial Nature Park. Mitlenatch is a First Nations word with a number of meanings. In Coast Salish it has been translated to mean ‘calm waters all around’. Perhaps the most descriptive meaning comes from the Sliammon language where ‘metl’ meant calm and ‘nach’ meant posterior. Calm (waters) behind is an apt description of the island during stormy weather. In the Kwak'wala language of the Kwakwaka'wakw, ‘mah- kwee-lay-lah’ meant \\"it looks close, but seems to move away as you approach it\\". Sea lions on Mitlenatch Island Conservation Mitlenatch Island Nature Provincial Park is home to the largest seabird colony in the Strait of Georgia. Glaucous-winged gulls, pelagic cormorants, pigeon guillemots, rhinoceros auklets and black oystercatchers also return to Mitlenatch each spring to breed. All sedentary marine life, including abalones, scallops and sea cucumbers are fully protected within this zone. Some of the largest garter snakes in BC reside here. These snakes are frequently encountered along trails and in beach and tide pool areas, where they feed on small fish such as sculpins and blennies. This park is a favourite haul out for harbour seals, northern and California sea lions. The sea lions are generally present from late autumn to mid-May. River otters, killer whales and harbour porpoises are often sighted offshore. Recreation The following recreational activities are available: canoeing and kayaking around the island and nature watching. Due to the sensitive bird habitat, most of the island is closed to the public. A short trail from Camp Bay to Northwest Bay is the only area accessible to visitors.

Since time immemorial, the Osoyoos Indian Band's Okanagan ancestors have inhabited and cared for the lands and waters in their traditional territory. The park is also located within the town of Okanagan Falls, protecting the area around the waterfall of the same name, which lies below the outlet of Skaha Lake in the course of the Okanagan River. History Okanagan Falls Provincial Park was created in 1956. In 2015, the park was renamed to reflect the traditional Okanagan place name for the area. sx̌ʷəx̌ʷnitkʷ means “little falls.” This place name signifies a connection to the historic Kettle Falls in Washington state. The step-like rapids of the outlet of the Skaha Lake were lost in 1950 when a flood control dam was built over them. Flora The park occupies an area of two hectares. The park has deciduous trees and is an important site for the conservation of riparian vegetation. In the 1950s, non-native tree species like Chinese elm, Norway maple, red ash and Lombardy poplar were planted in the park. Fauna Western wood-pewee (Contopus sordidulus) There is superb bird watching in the park. Rare species such as western wood pewees, American yellow warblers, northern orioles and least flycatchers are often spotted in the park. The park offers numerous nature-related activities such as wildlife viewing, nature study, and photography. The park also supports an astounding 18 species of bats, one of the highest concentrations in Canada. Activities The park offers several activities, such as cycling and fishing, though for the latter permits are required. There are many trails in the park for hiking. There are also camping sites within the park. Events sx̌ʷəx̌ʷnitkʷ park closes annually the third weekend of September for the Okanagan Nation Alliance's Salmon Feast. The event raises awareness of Okanagan history and culture, as well as the Nation's efforts to revitalise and restore sockeye salmon numbers in the Okanagan River.

It was written and directed by John R. Cherry III. It is the first film to feature the Ernest P. Worrell character. However, it has a slightly darker tone than his later films. The film was released on video in 1992 by GoodTimes Home Video. It was shot in Fall Creek Falls State Park, Boxwell Scout Reservation, and Nashville, Tennessee. The film is dedicated to famed editor Elmo Williams. A public apology to Williams appears in the end credits, with the promise that if another Dr. Otto film were made, \\"we'll make it up to you.\\" Plot synopsis In a pre-credits scene, Ernest P. Worrell is showing off a new device he has bartered from a guy off the street. He called it a \\"changing coffin\\" that transforms the user into any disguise. Ernest enters the coffin as Vern flips a switch, then Ernest gets pulled in screaming. Dr. Otto is a mysterious villain with a hand attached on top of his head. He is plotting world domination using his \\"gloom beam,\\" an electromagnetic device that he uses to launch attacks on financial institutions to erase their contents and cause worldwide chaos. In a broadcast signal intrusion, Dr. Otto announces the \\"Riddle of the Gloom Beam:\\" > \\"When the money is scrambled to the very last cent, > riots and hatred soon will commence. When all the world's commerce will be > put in a bind, > from the evil that lurks where the sun never shines. It is I, Dr. Otto von > Schnick-ick-ick-ick, > who has played on you this trick-ick-ick-ick.\\" \\"'But who's Dr. Otto?' you > may well ponder, > while all your magnetic cash is squandered. It's he who had an eye, and yet > couldn't see. > It's he who served bouillabaisse, when he was a she. It's he who gambled > with brains, and a gun. > It's he who had all, and yet had none. And to stop this horrible twisted > trick, > just exchange the poles of old Saint Nick. And if that doesn't do to save > the day, > put another quarter in and try another play.\\" Dr. Otto's first target is Cincinnati, Ohio, where a bank affected by the Gloom Beam decides to disrupt Dr. Otto's scheme before it can cause world chaos by sending in his archnemesis: all-American boy Lance Sterling, born on the same day in the same hospital as Dr. Otto. While Lance was a gifted child born to loving parents, Dr. Otto was the end result of a botched abortion, neglected by his parents (whom he later kills). To foil Lance, Dr. Otto uses a \\"changing coffin\\" and transforms himself into various characters in an effort to stop the heroes: Rudd Hardtack, Australian trainer of child militants; Laughing Jack O'Cockney, pirate captain; Auntie Nelda, the cantankerous elderly woman; and Guy Dandy, wealthy playboy. Lance and his sidekick Doris Talbert escape each disguise in unusual ways: they survive Hardtack's game of Russian roulette; when Laughing Jack uses Lance as bait to catch a swamp monster, the monster turns out to be an old friend of Lance's, who lets them free; when Auntie Nelda poisons them into a trap, Lance is able to sway Tina (a woman Dr. Otto used as bait) into using Dr. Otto's transporter blanket to get them out; and they stumble into an elevator that leads straight to Dr. Otto's lair during a chase with Guy Dandy. Meanwhile, the gloom beam continues to cause chaos around the world, with comical effects: the President of the United States, for example, is overjoyed that Dr. Otto has effectively wiped out the national debt. In a climactic showdown, Lance and Doris face off against Dr. Otto, all his disguises, and his robot henchman. In the end, it comes down to Lance choosing between a conspicuously labeled \\"Right Button\\" and \\"Wrong Button.\\" He chooses the Right Button—which he realizes too late that it was not the right button (thus implying that was the subject of the \\"switch the poles\\" clue)—and, as massive electric bolts fire off in all directions, the lair self-destructs. The scene then flash-cuts to Doris, Lance and Tina pushing their car down a road. At a gas station, they encounter Ernest, who informs them that they, have had no gas since the money went bad. As they all push the car down the road, Ernest takes his hat off to reveal Dr. Otto's third hand, as he says \\"Have a nice day, knowhutimean?\\" Cast *Jim Varney - Dr. Otto von Schnick, mad scientist, and his various disguises: **Rudd Hardtack, Australian trainer of child militants, \\"he who gambled with brains and a gun.\\" **Laughing Jack O'Cockney, pirate captain, \\"he who had one eye and yet couldn't see.\\" **Auntie Nelda, cantankerous old woman, \\"he who served bouillabaisse when he was she.\\" Auntie Nelda made numerous other appearances in Carden & Cherry's other commercials and films. **Guy Dandy, wealthy playboy, \\"he who had all and yet had none.\\" **Ernest P.

The microsomal and mitochondrial variants are membrane-bound, while bacterial and those from erythrocytes and other animal tissues are water-soluble. The family of cytochrome b5-like proteins includes (besides cytochrome b5 itself) hemoprotein domains covalently associated with other redox domains in flavocytochrome cytochrome b2 (L-lactate dehydrogenase; ), sulfite oxidase (), plant and fungal nitrate reductases (, , ), and plant and fungal cytochrome b5/acyl lipid desaturase fusion proteins.  Structure  3-D structures of a number of cytochrome b5 and yeast flavocytochrome b2 are known. The fold belongs to the α+β class, with two hydrophobic cores on each side of a β-sheet. The larger hydrophobic core constitutes the heme-binding pocket, closed off on each side by a pair of helices connected by a turn. The smaller hydrophobic core may have only a structural role and is formed by spatially close N-terminal and C-terminal segments. The two histidine residues provide the fifth and sixth heme ligands, and the propionate edge of the heme group lies at the opening of the heme crevice.

Playing career Mayock played high school football at The Haverford School in Haverford, Pennsylvania, and college football (and baseball) at Boston College. He was selected by the Pittsburgh Steelers in the tenth round of the 1981 NFL Draft, as the 265th overall pick. He was waived during first roster cuts on August 18, 1981. After his release, he signed with the CFL's Toronto Argonauts during the 1981 season. He played in just one game before being released. He returned to the NFL with the New York Giants for the 1982 and 1983 football seasons. In 1982, he played in the first two games of the season before the players' strike caused the cancellation of the next eight games. When the players returned on November 21, Mayock tore his rotator cuff in a game against the Washington Redskins, and was placed on injured reserve on November 24, 1982. Mayock was placed on injured reserve again before the start of the 1983 season on August 30, after undergoing arthroscopic knee surgery. He was activated from the list on October 16, 1983.

Broadcasting career After an 18 year career in commercial real estate, Mayock broke into broadcasting covering college football for Prime Network, NCAA Productions, Prime Sports Radio and the Big East Conference. Later he went to ESPN where he worked as an analyst and sideline reporter for the cable network's coverage of the Canadian Football League and college football from 1993–95. He moved from ESPN to CBS Sports in 1996 as a member of SEC on CBS' broadcast team—during which time he served as both a game analyst (1996, 1997 and 1999) and lead sideline reporter (1998). Mayock also worked as a reporter for CBS's coverage of the NCAA basketball tournament in 1997, 1998 and 1999. In 2000, he moved to Fox Sports Net where he called college football action. Between 2001 and 2004, Mayock served as a college football analyst for ABC Sports. From 2004 to 2018, Mayock worked with the NFL Network where he did his most notable work while a broadcaster. He was the color commentator for the Minnesota Vikings preseason games for several seasons. From 2015 to 2018, Mayock commentated on the Philadelphia Eagles preseason television broadcasts alongside play-by-play announcer Scott Graham and sideline reporter Dave Spadero. Mayock was an analyst for NFL Network and hosted the show Path To The Draft during the draft season as a draft guru. In 2010, Mayock replaced Pat Haden as the color commentator for NBC's coverage of Notre Dame football, teaming with play-by- play announcer Tom Hammond. On January 8, 2011, Mayock teamed with Hammond to call NBC's coverage of the Wild Card playoff game between the New Orleans Saints and Seattle Seahawks in what was later referred to as the Beast Quake game. This was his first NFL Playoffs game as a broadcaster. On January 5, 2012, Mayock commentated the AFC Wild Card game between the Cincinnati Bengals and Houston Texans. Mayock called Thursday Night Football on the NFL Network with Brad Nessler from 2011 through 2013. In February 2014, the NFL announced that CBS Sports and the NFL Network would share and co-produce the Thursday Night package, using the No. 1 CBS announce team of Jim Nantz and Phil Simms for the entire season, replacing Nessler and Mayock. Mayock was replaced by Doug Flutie as color commentator of Notre Dame football, beginning with the 2015 season. Executive career =Oakland / Las Vegas Raiders= On December 31, 2018, Mayock was hired to be the general manager of the Oakland Raiders. One of Mayock's first splashes as general manager was trading for embittered Pittsburgh Steelers wide receiver Antonio Brown. In his first draft with the team, Mayock used the team's three first-round picks on Clelin Ferrell, Josh Jacobs, and Johnathan Abram. Mayock was involved in a heated verbal exchange with Brown during a practice session prior to the start of the 2019 NFL season, in which Brown insulted Mayock racially as a \\"cracker\\". The altercation allegedly stemmed from an Instagram post in which Brown displayed a letter from Mayock that detailed approximately $54,000 in fines for absences during training camp, which led to Brown being released and eventually signing with the New England Patriots.https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/27543780/sources-raiders-suspend- ab-tiff-gm Personal life Mike Mayock has two children, Leigh and Mike, the latter of whom played football at Villanova.

The Vulgate, completed by Jerome and revised multiple times, had formed the textual basis for all Catholic vernacular translations until then. Divino afflante Spiritu inaugurated the modern period of Roman Catholic biblical studies by encouraging the study of textual criticism (or lower criticism), pertaining to text of the Scriptures themselves and transmission thereof (for example, to determine correct readings) and permitted the use of the historical-critical method (or higher criticism), to be informed by theology, Sacred Tradition, and ecclesiastical history on the historical circumstances of the text, hypothesizing about matters such as authorship, dating, and similar concerns. The eminent Catholic biblical scholar Raymond E. Brown described it as a \\"Magna Carta for biblical progress\\". Cited in . Description The encyclical appeared on the feast of Jerome to commemorate the 50th anniversary of Pope Leo XIII's 1893 encyclical Providentissimus Deus. With Providentissimus Deus, Pope Leo gave the first formal authorization for the use of critical methods in biblical scholarship.Prior, Joseph G., The Historical Critical Method in Catholic Exegesis, Gregorian Biblical BookShop, 1999, p. 90. Pius XII noted that advances had been made in archaeology and historical research, which made it advisable to further define the study of the Bible. Previously, Catholic translations of the Bible into modern languages were usually based on the Latin Vulgate, the text used in the Liturgy. They generally referred back to the source texts (in Biblical Hebrew, Biblical Aramaic and Biblical Greek) only to clarify the exact meaning of the Latin text. In his encyclical, Pius stressed the importance of diligent study of the original languages and other cognate languages to arrive at a deeper and fuller knowledge of the meaning of the sacred texts: Newer Catholic translations of the Bible have been based directly on the texts found in manuscripts in the original languages, taking into account as well the ancient translations that sometimes clarify what seem to be transcription errors in those manuscripts. However, the Latin Vulgate remains the official Bible in the Latin Rite of the Catholic Church.

It was the first Swedish endeavour to Antarctica in the Heroic Age of Antarctic Exploration.  Background  Otto Nordenskjöld, a Swedish geologist and geographer, organized and led a scientific expedition of the Antarctic Peninsula. The expedition's overall command was placed under the Norwegian Carl Anton Larsen, an experienced Antarctic explorer who served as captain of , and who had previously commanded a whaling reconnaissance mission in 1892–1893. Seven other scientists, including archaeologist Johan Gunnar Andersson, botanist Carl Skottsberg, and zoologist Axel Ohlin, along with 16 officers and men joined them on the voyage. On 16 October 1901, the Antarctic left the Port of Gothenburg.  Events  Despite its end and the great hardships endured, the expedition would be considered a scientific success, with the parties having explored much of the eastern coast of Graham Land, including Cape Longing, James Ross Island, the Joinville Island group, and the Palmer Archipelago. The expedition, which also recovered valuable geological samples and samples of marine animals, earned Nordenskjöld lasting fame at home, but its huge cost left him greatly in debt. Two key Antarctic islands are associated with the expedition: Snow Hill Island, where Nordenskjöld and five of his colleagues spent two winters—one of them planned and the second forced by the sinking of the Antarctic—and Paulet Island, where the crew of the Antarctic were stranded from February until November 1903. The expedition was rescued by the Argentinian naval vessel Uruguay. = Snow Hill Island = On the way to Snow Hill Island in 1901, Nordenskjöld had passed through Buenos Aires, where the Argentine government gave him supplies and other assistance on the condition that he include in his wintering-over party a young Argentine naval officer, Lieutenant José María Sobral. The American artist Frank Wilbert Stokes also joined the expedition and spent two years with Nordenskjöld at Snow Hill Island. In 1903, the Argentine government organized a rescue effort with the corvette , which successfully brought back all the surviving members of the Nordenskjöld party. = Paulet Island = After their ship sank, crushed by the ice about away, the 20 men from the Antarctic landed on Paulet Island in their lifeboat and built a sturdy double-walled stone hut whose remains are clearly visible today. Apart from the limited supplies they brought from the Antarctic, they survived on the thousand or so penguins they killed, as well as the birds' eggs.

In 1987 he presented his work in a video, which now is available for free at archive.org. Here is an extract of the interview, which took place in the end of the video. \\"What do students need to learn to be prepared to meet the challenges?\\" - \\"I would like to comment on the necessary courses a student should take to really be prepared to carry out research in model-based vision. As we can see the geometry of image projection and the mathematics of transformation is a very key element in studying this field, but there are many other issues the student has to be prepared for. If we are going to talk about segmenting images and getting good geometric clues, we have to understand the relationship between the intensity of image data and its underlying geometry. And this would lead the student into such areas as optics, illumination theory, theory of shadows and the like. And also the mathematics underlying this kind of computations would of course require signal processing theory, fourier transform theory and the like. And in dealing with algebraic surfaces such as this curved surfaces as we talked about here, courses in algebraic geometry and higher pure forms of algebra will prove to be necessary in order to make any kind of progress in research to handle curved surfaces. So, I guess the bottom line of what I'm saying is: math courses, particularly those associated with geometric aspects will be key in all of this.\\" See also * Computer Vision External links * University video communication on model- based computer vision * Machine Perception of Three-Dimensional Solids - the paper mentioned by Joseph Mundy in the video * A biography *CV Computer vision researchers Living people Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute alumni Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute faculty General Electric people Brown University faculty Year of birth missing (living people) ","title":"Joseph Mundy"},{"id":"4324385","text":"Alberto Nepomuceno Alberto Nepomuceno (July 6, 1864 – October 16, 1920) was a Brazilian composer and conductor. Career Nepomuceno was born in the city of Fortaleza, capital of the state of Ceará in Northeastern Brazil. His parents were Vitor Augusto Nepomuceno and Maria Virginia de Oliveira Paiva. He began to study music with his father, a violinist, organist, teacher and chapel-master at the Fortaleza Cathedral. In 1872, he and his family moved to Recife, also in Northeastern Brazil, where he initiated piano and violin studies. He went on to become an outspoken defender of Republican and Abolitionist causes in Brazil, and was active in campaigns that ultimately led to the overthrow of the Monarchy and the establishment of the First Brazilian Republic in 1889. At the age of eighteen, he became director of the Clube Carlos Gomes (Carlos Gomes Club) in Recife. thumbright290px Portrait of Alberto Nepomuceno (1895) by Eliseu Visconti.. In 1885, a series of songs in Portuguese by Nepomuceno was premiered at the Brazilian Musical National Institute. The concert was intended at defying those who thought Portuguese was inappropriate for the bel canto. As criticism poured, he embarked on a battle against newspapers and music critics. His struggle on behalf of nationalism in classical music led him to work at the Popular Concert Association from 1896 to 1906, where he pushed for the recognition of several Brazilian composers. In 1888, he left for Europe in order to further his musical studies. In Rome, he took lessons from Giovanni Sgambati. He moved to Berlin in 1890, where he studied composition with Heinrich von Herzogenberg and continued his piano studies with Theodor Leschetizky at the Stern Conservatory. In Leschetizky's class, he met Norwegian student Walborg Bang, whom he ended up marrying in 1893. Bang had been a student and friend of Edvard Grieg's. After the wedding, Nepomuceno moved to Bergen and lived in Grieg's house. As Grieg was also an advocate for nationalism in composition, the friendship was instrumental in convincing Nepomuceno to write music which reflected Brazilian culture. Before leaving Europe, he visited Paris, where he met Camille Saint-Saëns and Vincent d'Indy. String Quartet No. 3 by NepomucenoString Quartet No. 3, musicabrasilis.org.br Upon his return to Brazil, he taught at the Instituto Nacional de Música (National Music Institute) in Rio de Janeiro. Later on, Gustav Mahler engaged him to conduct at the Vienna Opera House, but illness prevented the deed from taking place. He went again to Europe in 1910 for a series of concerts in Brussels, Geneva and Paris. During this trip, he became friends with Claude Debussy. Back in Brazil, he championed the use of Portuguese in opera and song and remained the leading musical figure in the country until his death at age 56. Heitor Villa- Lobos was one of his students. Among his prominent works is his String Quartet No. 3 \\"Brasileiro\\" (Brazilian). According to Nepomuceno's handwritten note, it was composed in Berlin in 1890. It is probably the earliest example of the integration of Brazilian folk melody with the Central European romantic idiom. The \\"Brasileiro\\" String Quartet remained unpublished until 2005, and was only rarely performed before then. Also notable are the operas Abul (1905), Artemis (1898), Electra (1894) and O Garatuja (unfinished), the Orchestral Pieces (1888), the Sinfonia in G minor (1893) and the Serenata (1902).

Overview Mercato is the largest open air market in Africa, covering several square miles and employing an estimated 13,000 people in 7,100 business entities. The primary merchandise passing through the Merkato is locally grown agricultural products — most notably coffee. Prior to the current Mercato, there was an open market place in Addis Ababa near St. George Church at the site where the City Hall stands now, but it ended with the Italian occupation of the 1930s. The occupiers moved the market further west to the area around the premises of Fitawrari Habte Giyorgis Dinagde, which they named Merkato Indigeno. Thus, the present Addis Merkato was founded by the segregationist policies of the Italian occupational government. Meanwhile, the Italians restricted the historic St. George Merkato to Europeans, renaming it Piazza, which featured European style shops that displayed commodities through glass windows. The mostly Arab tradesmen who had shops there eventually relocated a half mile to the west. Over time, local shopkeepers displaced the Arab merchants and, since the 1960s, the Addis Merkato has had a mostly local flavor. The Mercato Dijino did not have any plan and gradually grew in width and breadth taking different categorical stocks called \\"terras\\". References * Zewde, Bahru.

Some tax resisters advocate legal recognition of a right to COMT, while others conscientiously resist taxes without concern for whether their stand has legal approval. Theory COMT is thought by its proponents to be a logical extension to conscientious objection to military service. A person with a religious or ethical scruple against taking part in killing people during war is likely to feel no less scruple about paying somebody else to do the killing or about purchasing the mechanism of killing. If a government can respect the right of a person not to participate directly in making war, can it also respect the right of the person to avoid this indirect participation? Proponents of COMT and of \\"Peace Tax Fund\\"-style legislation say that it will have numerous benefits that go beyond accommodating individual conscientious objectors, for instance: * It will free people who are unwilling by reason of conscience to pay taxes or to engage in taxed activities to go ahead and pay taxes without fear of violating their consciences. * It will promote freedom of religion and freedom of conscience and serve to educate people about their choices concerning warfare. As one advocate put it, \\"it will extend the legal recognition due to the absolute value of human life, and the freedom of the individual conscience to acknowledge it.\\" * It will increase government funding by encouraging tax resisters to become tax payers. * It will encourage other anti-militaristic legislation and reevaluation of military spending. =Terminology= In tax circles, to restrict a tax payment from a particular purpose, or to designate a tax payment for a particular purpose, is called hypothecation. Historical precedents and legislative proposals In the more general category of hypothecation, there are already well-established precedents: they include the gasoline tax in the United States, which is dedicated to the funding of transportation infrastructure. In the more specific category of military- related hypothecation, there was at least one legal, government-instituted historical precedent: An \\"alternative tax\\" related specifically to militia duty lasted for eight years in Upper Canada between 1841 and 1849, as we see in this quote: > \\"In 1793 in Upper Canada, Governor John Graves Simcoe offered Mennonites, > Quakers and Brethren in Christ an exemption from militia duty, to encourage > their immigration to Canada. They were however expected to pay a fee so that > others could serve in their place.... In 1841, after years of lobbying, the > government agreed to use this tax for public works. In 1849, the tax was > eliminated.\\" Notice that the above quote refers to tax in exchange for \\"militia duty\\" and does not mention militia equipment, etc. In that respect it could be perceived as simply another form of quasi-alternative civilian service for conscientious objectors. Nevertheless, this tax still stands as a precedent because an alteration was made to a taxation system (as opposed to simply requiring alternative civilian service). In the 1960s, a Quaker group in the United States drafted a prototype law that would allow conscientious objectors to pay their taxes to UNICEF instead of to the U.S. Treasury.Kaufman, Donald D. The Tax Dilemma: Praying for peace, paying for war Herald Press, 1978, p. 51 In the United States, legislation establishing a \\"Peace Tax Fund\\" has been proposed in Congress since 1972.War Tax Resistance War Resisters League (2003) p.125 , the current proposal is called the Religious Freedom Peace Tax Fund Act. Similar legislation is being considered in many other countries, and an international campaign to encourage such laws began in 1975, but no country recognizes a legal right for a taxpayer to direct his or her taxes for only non-military purposes. A legislative bill was tabled in the Parliament of Canada in 1983, and several others have been tabled, but not passed, since then. New Democratic Party Member of Parliament Bill Siksay tabled bills C-397 (38th parliament, May 2005) and C-390 (40th parliament, May 2009). The latest incarnation of this legislation occurred in 2011 as Bill C-363. It was a private member's bill proposed by NDP MP Alex Atamanenko and would put income tax paid by Canadians committed to COMT into a special account to be audited yearly by the Parliamentary Budget Officer and used exclusively for peace building purposes. Conscientious objectors would be able to register with the Canada Revenue Agency so their taxes could be diverted away from the military. Objections There are a number of common objections to COMT. Some people oppose legal recognition of conscientious objection even for military service and conscription, arguing that all citizens are obliged to serve in the military when the country requires it, and that nobody should be able to expect special treatment on conscientious grounds. This argument applies just as well or just as poorly against COMT. Others argue that COMT would be too difficult to implement. Another commonly raised objection is that COMT, if allowed, would establish a precedent for a general freedom for individual taxpayers to opt out of contributions for any tax-funded activity which they do not wish to support, including, for example, public education and healthcare. Anarchists argue that to fund government at all is to fund violence, and so the only true pacifist conscientious tax objection is complete tax objection. =Objections from conscientious tax resisters= Some conscientious tax resisters have a different set of objections to COMT. They argue that the legislative proposals that have been proposed so far that would legalize COMT actually would have the paradoxical effect of encouraging more conscientious objectors to pay for more war than before. They point out the ease with which the government can shift money from place to place in its budget, and borrow money when funds are not available. If a conscientious objector who had been unwilling to pay taxes started to pay into a \\"peace tax fund,\\" this would only mean more money for the government to spend, and the likely result of that is more money for the military. The Religious Freedom Peace Tax Fund Act in the United States, for instance, would give the government more tax revenue and would not change how much or how high a percentage of this money was spent on the military. The analogy to conscientious objection is flawed, these critics say: A conscientious objector to military service does not take up arms and kill. Perhaps somebody else is drafted to do so instead, but the conscientious objector does not. A “peace tax fund” payer, on the other hand, pays just as much money as the ordinary taxpayer, but just cherishes the illusion that her dollars were peaceful ones. It would be as if the government told conscientious objectors that they had to take up arms and shoot at the enemy just like everybody else, but that they didn't have to take credit for their kills if they didn't want to. Another objection is that to make COMT legal is to make it no longer a protest against or a confrontation with evil, but instead a compromise with it. One Christian tax resister wrote that \\"worldly priorities must be objected to in word and deed. If the objecting deeds are done legally, they register little if any protest. If consciously illegal, they register an unequivocal refusal to agree with the world's values. The latter gets the attention of the state, the former does not.\\"Schenk, Phil \\"World Peace Tax Fund\\" The Mennonite 13 December 1977, p. 735 See also * National Campaign for a Peace Tax Fund * National War Tax Resistance Coordinating Committee * Tax resistance * Tax resistance in the United States * War Resisters League * On the Duty of Civil Disobedience * Conscience: Taxes for Peace not War References External links * The Peace Tax Seven (peace tax fund advocates from the United Kingdom) * Conscience and Peace Tax International (International NGO works for recognition of the human right to conscientious objection to military taxation) * Advantages of a Peace Tax Fund * Conscience Canada (peace tax fund advocates from Canada) * Gross, David \\"A (critical) parable about peace tax fund plans\\" The Picket Line 27 September 2004 * Harding, David \\"Quaker Tax Protesters Challenge Law\\" Accountancy Age 10 March 2005 (includes a discussion of \\"hypothecation\\") * Pennock, Robert T. \\"Death and Taxes: On the Justice of Conscientious War Tax Resistance\\" (PDF) Journal of Accounting, Ethics & Public Policy Vol. 1, No. 1, Winter 1998 Tax resistance Military economics Anti-war protests Conscientious objection Tax law ","title":"Conscientious objection to military taxation"},{"id":"4324395","text":"Liu Wenjie (born 1944) is a Chinese official who has been the Deputy Chairman of the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade since 1998.

Dock workers went on strike, seeking higher pay, but manager called the PIDE, the Portuguese state police, who fired into the crowd, killing at least 25 people. The government blamed the revolutionary group PAIGC, arresting several of its members. The incident caused PAIGC to abandon their campaign of nonviolent resistance, leading to the Guinea-Bissau War of Independence in 1963. Background In the 1950s, the Portuguese conglomerate Companhia União Fabril controlled much of the commerce on the Pijiguiti docks through a subsidiary called Casa Gouveia. Although the Portuguese colonial government had enacted a number of reforms in these years to try and quell the growing anti-colonial and pro-independence sentiments in the region, low wages and poor working conditions still served as catalysts for social unrest. The first major dock-workers' strike by employees of Casa Gouveia occurred on 6 March 1956. On this occasion, the Portuguese security forces and PIDE (political police) were ordered not to use force against the striking workers, presumably to avoid escalating the conflict. The workers, realizing this development, attempted to take the docks by force, and police reinforcements were required. Arrests were eventually made, but the episode left the police humiliated. The 1956 strike was overall unsuccessful, and wages remained extremely low. The continued growing unrest among the port workers was evident even to high-ranking colonial officials, including Army Under-Secretary of State Francisco da Costa Gomes who remarked in late 1958 that a dock-workers' revolt was likely and advised the governor to grant the wage demands of the workers in the interest of stability. This advice, however, was never acted upon. Preparations for another strike were organized in late July 1959, with workers meeting under the quay palm trees to discuss the specifics. Indeed, Amílcar Cabral sometimes referred to the incident as \\"the massacre of Pijiguiti Quay\\". Massacre On the morning of 3 August, the dock-workers were set to meet with Antonio Carreira, the manager of Casa Gouveia, to negotiate their wage increase. They had decided beforehand to stop working altogether at 3 o'clock in the afternoon should their demands not be met. The meeting did not prove fruitful, and the workers ceased their labour as planned. Carreira summoned the PIDE who arrived around 4 o'clock and demanded the workers resume their work. The strikers refused, and proceeded to barricade themselves in by closing the gates to the quay. Brandishing oars and harpoons, the strikers armed themselves in an attempt to deter the police from rushing in. The police, rather than risk defeat in open combat, opened fire on the striking workers, even throwing grenades. The workers had nowhere to run, and a number were killed within about 5 minutes. A few managed to escape via the water in their own boats, but the majority of them were pursued and arrested, or shot dead in the water. Between 25-50 workers died at the scene, along with many more wounded. News of the massacre spread quickly, and members of the revolutionary group PAIGC arrived on the scene quickly. The PAIGC were aware of the strike plans, and had endorsed the maneuver as an act of civil resistance against the colonial government. The PIDE quickly arrested PAIGC members, including Carlos Correia. The PAIGC's involvement gave the colonial authorities a convenient scapegoat on which to lay the blame for the unrest. Aftermath The authorities blamed the PAIGC of fomenting discontent among the workers, and the party's supporters had to rethink long range strategies for achieving their goals. In September 1959 Cabral and several PAIGC members met in Bissau and decided nonviolent protest in the city would not bring about change. They concluded that the only hope for achieving independence was through armed struggle. This was the initial point in a 11-year armed struggle (1963–1974) in Portuguese Guinea that pitted 10,000 Soviet bloc-supported PAIGC soldiers against 35,000 Portuguese and African troops, and would eventually lead to independence in Cape Verde and all of Portuguese Africa after the Carnation Revolution coup of 1974 in Lisbon.Crónica da Libertação Commemoration The day of the massacre, 3 August, is a public day of remembrance in Guinea-Bissau. Near the docks, there is now a large black fist known as the Hand of Timba which was erected as a memorial to those killed.

His real name was Pierre Alphonse Léon Frédéric Bouclet. On 14 August 1930, he married Ferdinande Alice Andrée Bouclet in Lille. He is famous in France for his unique comic talent. He used to simulate stuttering while talking, in a humoristic way, trying to pronounce some words and finally replacing them by others. In a famous French sketch, \\"Les crêpes\\", he explained the recipe that way, with sentences like this one: \\"Then you add some mamerlade, oh sorry ! Some marlamade... Uh! Me, I pour some chocolate\\". Pierre Repp appeared in many theatre plays and TV shows, but mainly in music-hall and cabarets in Paris or on tour. Pierre Repp has his place in the French cinéma story due to many \\"third-roles\\" in about forty films.

He was a member of the Australian Labor Party (ALP) and served in the Victorian Legislative Council from 1976 to 1992, including as a minister in the Labor government of John Cain. Before entering politics he was a senior official in the Storemen and Packers' Union. Early life Landeryou was born in the Melbourne suburb of Moonee Ponds, the son of a timber worker. He left school at 15 and worked for a trucking company. In 1965 Landeryou was appointed as a research officer for the Storemen and Packers' Union (now the National Union of Workers), despite never having worked as a storeman or packer, after having been recommended to the state secretary by Labor Party contacts. A year later he was elected as an organiser, then as Victorian State Secretary in 1969, federal secretary in 1974 and federal president in 1979. He also became a director of 133 Sydney Rd Ltd, a company controlled by the union, which owned the R.J. Hawke Hotel, a hotel in Sydney Rd, Brunswick. Politics Landeryou joined the Labor Party at a young age, and was President of Victorian Young Labor from 1964 to 1966. A supporter of the party's right-wing faction, and a close ally of the president of the Australian Council of Trade Unions, Bob Hawke, Landeryou became a member of the party's Victorian Administrative Committee following the removal in 1971 of the left-wing group which had controlled the Victorian Labor Party since 1955. In 1976 Landeryou was elected to the Legislative Council as member for Doutta Galla Province, a safe Labor seat in the north- western suburbs of Melbourne. Immediately he became a member of the ALP frontbench. Clyde Holding, who had been Opposition Leader since 1967, appointed Landeryou shadow minister for ethnic affairs and consumer affairs. In 1980 Holding's successor, Frank Wilkes, appointed Landeryou shadow minister for local government. The previous year, Landeryou had become the ALP leader in the Legislative Council. During 1981 Landeryou became convinced that Wilkes could not win the next Victorian election (due in 1982) and supported the overthrow of Wilkes by John Cain, which took place in September of that year. Cain appointed Landeryou shadow minister for employment. When Cain led Labor to victory in the April 1982 election, forming the first Labor government in Victoria since 1955, Landeryou was appointed Minister for Economic Development and Tourism. In December 1982 he became Minister for Industrial Affairs and he was also made Minister for Labour and Industry. Landeryou continued to serve in the Legislative Council after Cain resigned as Premier, and until the defeat of Joan Kirner's government in 1992. Future premier John Brumby succeeded him in the constituency. Personal life After leaving Parliament, Landeryou remained active in Labor Party affairs and pursued a career in business. He died on 27 February 2019. Landeryou's son Andrew Landeryou became prominent as a businessman and political blogger. His wife Kimberley Kitching is a current Labor Party Senator for Victoria. In December 2019, former Prime Minister Bob Hawke's daughter Rosslyn Dillon claimed that Landeryou had committed rape against her three times in 1982, while she was a staffer employed in Landeryou's office. In an affidavit lodged in the Supreme Court of New South Wales in a suit against her late father's estate, Ms Dillon claimed that Hawke urged her not to report the matter to police due his political aspirations. Hawke's second wife Blanche d'Alpuget claimed neither she or Bob Hawke knew of Dillon's allegations.

On the eve of a battle between rival armies of Picts and Northumbrians in 832AD, Saint Andrew, who was crucified on a diagonal cross, came to the Pictish King Óengus II in a vision promising victory. The next morning the Picts saw a white cross formed by clouds in the sky.

She may be a model, celebrity or entertainer. The term would generally not be used to describe a casual, once-off appearance by a person on the cover of a magazine. The term first appeared in English about 1899. A less-commonly used term for the other gender is cover boy.  Types of cover girl  Women are on the cover of the majority of general-interest magazines in the west for both men and women, with exceptions as discussed below. Celebrities feature on the cover of magazines such as Redbook for women, or Gentlemen's Quarterly, Maxim or Esquire for men. The use of royalty or aristocracy is linked to the primary objective of recognition. Some magazines for women feature an unknown model that represents the style of the magazine, such as Seventeen. A parallel to this trend is reflected in men's magazines like Men's Fitness or Sports Illustrated. An intermediate category is the use of a model or supermodel who is recognizable due to exposure in magazines or advertising, a strategy often adopted by ELLE magazine. In most cases, the objective is to maximize sales and differentiation, while also expressing the brand values of the title. Editorial approaches and the market-place Editorial decisions concerning the positioning of the magazine in the market-place are a key influence on the portrayal of women on the cover. In the 20th century, numerous women's magazines would feature royalty or aristocracy on their covers. In the 1980s and 1990s, Diana, Princess of Wales would be a popular cover choice—but usually for weeklies, usually shot by paparazzi, so strictly these were not \\"cover girl\\" images. However, there were exceptions where authorized portraits of royalty, such as Diana, Princess Beatrice of York and Elizabeth II, were taken for Vogue, Tatler and Harper's Bazaar. Despite public complaints about exploitation in the 1990s, publishers have not shied away from using royalty when possible. Supermodel Gisele Bündchen is one of the most famous faces usually seen featuring the fashion magazine covers. New men's style magazines founded in the 1980s, like Arena and Gentlemen's Quarterly rarely featured women on the cover, and where they did they were intended not to be sexually provocative, deliberately distancing the magazine from ‘top shelf’ soft core pornographic magazines. Notably Esquire’s first edition featured a photograph of Brigitte Bardot that was over thirty years old. However, this trend changed during the 1990s, initially with Loaded in the UK, followed by FHM. GQ’s UK edition was eventually forced to follow suit. Later Peter Howarth, UK editor of Esquire famously removed semi-naked women from the covers in a move to once again differentiate the magazine from the competition. The result was a drop in sales but an increase in advertising revenue, as the magazine was able to attract advertisers for more high-end products than before. The rise of celebrity culture in the late 1980s and early 1990s has seen to the appearance of more actresses on magazine covers, especially among fashion magazines. This may be due to a convergence in the mass media between traditional models and actresses: models gained a greater profile in the 1980s, largely through the \\"supermodels\\", and became celebrities in their own right. Actresses, meanwhile, saw appearances in fashion magazines as beneficial to their careers and overall profiles. In addition, numerous models made the move into acting. Finally, there is the issue of sales: a recognizable face will, theoretically, shift more magazines. The choice of model depends in some part on one's potential recognition in the market-place in which the title is sold. For example, Lucire Romania saw its sales and profile increase after using a local cover girl, Monica Gabor, rather than those photographed by the \\"master edition\\" in New Zealand. While familiarity is a desirable trait for magazine covers—hence the top models and celebrities can charge large amounts for a photographic shoot—there is always the problem of overexposure and dilution of one's image. If, for instance, the majority of covers featured a small handful of celebrities, then the differentiation becomes minimal (e.g. in certain months in 2005, Paris Hilton featured on numerous covers), and there would, in theory, be a tendency to promote lesser known faces. In the 2000s, some have predicted the demise of the actress or celebrity from fashion magazine covers, citing overexposure and growing cynicism. However, with the success of magazines such as InStyle, which uses celebrity covers, there is little evidence that the predictions are being realized in the middle of the decade. Image editing Image editing is common practice for photographs used in advertising and publicity, and cover images are no exception. Image editing is an ongoing process of styling and selection, which invites debate on issues related to the representation of women. Arguably, advertising and cover images can help perpetuate an unattainable ideal of beauty, sometimes aided through methods of retouching to remove skin blemishes and shadows under the eyes, smooth out skin texture, widen pupils, or suggest an hourglass figure. A contrary viewpoint has been put forward by some in the trade, saying that a retouched photograph is actually more representative of the subject. The theory is that when one is in the presence of the person, one does not notice the blemishes. Retouching, therefore, restores the \\"energy\\" of the subject.

He was a three times great-grandfather of United States President Thomas Jefferson. Early life and marriage Branch was born in England around 1600. or 1602. His parents were Lionel Branch and Valentia Sparks of London. He married Mary Francis Addie, daughter of Francis Addie of Darton, Yorkshire, on September 2, 1619 in St. Peter's, Westcheap, London. Christopher and Mary Branch sailed to Virginia on the London Merchant in March 1621 and survived the Powhatan attack of 1622 the following year. They were living at Colledg Land in Henrico by February 1623 when their son Thomas was nine months old. According to the William and Mary Quarterly, Thomas was born in 1623. They then had two more sons. William was born in 1625 and Christopher was born about 1627. His granddaughter Mary became the great-grandmother of President Thomas Jefferson, making him the three times great grandfather of the president. Career Branch acquired land in Henrico (now Chesterfield) County near Potter's Creek beginning in or before 1634 and established the Kingsland and Arrowhallocks Plantations. Randolph first settled at Arrowhallocks on the north side of the James River. The Kingsland Plantation, which grew to 450 acres by 1639, was located across the river from Arrowhallows. Branch operated a tobacco plantation and due to a glut in the market, a limit of the tobacco crop to a percentage per planter was established by the Virginia General Assembly. The remainder of the tobacco crop was to be destroyed. In 1639 he was a member of the House of Burgesses from Henrico County and was named a tobacco inspector that year. He was a member of the House of Burgesses again in 1641. In 1656, he was the Justice of Henrico County. He died in 1681 while living on the Kingsland Plantation.

CoverGirl primarily provides a wide variety of consumer-grade cosmetics.  History  CoverGirl's first product line, Clean Makeup, launched in 1961. It was nominated as America's best cosmetic brand. Originally offering only six products, it was advertised as being a \\"medicated face makeup\\" as it used Noxzema's medicated ingredients of camphor, menthol, and eucalyptus. In 1963, model (and later, actress) Jennifer O'Neill signed on as CoverGirl spokeswoman at the age of fifteen, appearing in both print and television advertising that year. Her unprecedented thirty-year endorsement of the product catapulted CoverGirl into being the top-selling makeup line in the country. Cybill Shepherd was one of CoverGirl's earliest models, appearing in several print and television advertisements for the brand. In contrast to the \\"made-up\\" looking fashion models of the late 1960s, Shepherd demonstrated a fresh, wholesome look, appealing to a younger consumer's taste. These advertisements established the \\"girl-next-door\\" look that CoverGirl would become associated with. Sales of the line increased during 1985 due to an advertising campaign featuring supermodel Christie Brinkley. In 1997, CoverGirl launched what is now the famous slogan, \\"Easy, breezy, beautiful…\\" This was meant to imply the products would give the user a natural look.

It is best known by its nickname \\"Singing Sands\\", in reference to the pure white sand that \\"sings\\" when stepped on, due to a high silica content. This sand is geologically unique to the area. Basin Head Provincial Park features a fisheries museum, souvenir shops, and interpretive center. The beach itself is split into two sections, divided by a channel (known locally as the 'run'). A bridge spans the 'run', and is a popular attraction for jumping and diving. It is open as a tourist attraction, operated by Tourism PEI, during the summer months.  History  Basin Head, located 13 kilometres east of Souris (the closest town), received its name from its wide, hollow bowl shaped form, like a basin. For many years it was a productive fishing area, with many local fisherman making their living fishing off shore. In 1937, it was decided to build a harbour and maintain a wharf at Basin Head. Much dredging was done, and the result was the large sand dunes on the beach which still remain today. The harbour was opened in 1938, and dredged again in 1959. In the peak time of fishing at the Basin there were about 25-30 boats fishing out of Basin Head. As many as twenty shacks owned by many of the fishermen were also located on the cape, along with a bunkhouse that housed at least twenty or more people. This was Basin Head's most productive era. In 1973, the Basin Head Fisheries Museum was built under the direction of the Prince Edward Island Museum and Heritage Foundation and was open to the public. In 1995-96 huge renovations took place on the site by the Eastern Kings Development Association. This included a board walk which features access to the magnificent \\"Singing Sands\\" white sandy beach, gift shops, food, and beach services and a children's play village. = Natural attractions = Rocky formation The Basin Head area is rich in natural attractions. As mentioned above, one of the most unusual aspects of the beach is the sands high silica content. This silica, when heated by the sun and rubbed together, produces a high-pitched squeaking sound. Dragging one's feet through the sand is enough to elicit this effect. The tidal lagoon behind the dunes is the only natural habitat for a variety of giant Irish moss called Chondrus crispus. To protect the unique strain, the Basin Head watershed is designated a Marine Protected Area. The moss is distinctive because it has a unique life cycle, does not attach to the bottom and is significantly larger than the varieties found elsewhere. It also has a higher concentration of carrageen, a stabilizing and thickening agent used in many household products.

Life and work He was born at 1 Marshall Street in LocheeDundee Post Office Directory 1868–69 (Lochee) near Dundee the son of John Young Gray, an art teacher at the High School of Dundee, and his wife, Mary Young. Gray spent his childhood in Dundee, and was educated at the High School of Dundee, going on to study mathematics and economics at the University of Edinburgh, graduating MA in 1902. This was followed by periods of study at Göttingen University and at the Sorbonne in Paris. During the First World War he worked in the civil service, employing his linguistic skills to produce anti-German propaganda. In 1921 he was appointed professor of Political Economy at Aberdeen University, and whilst there he published one of his most important economic works, The Development of Economic Doctrine, in 1931. In 1934 he took up the equivalent post at Edinburgh University's School of Economics, which he held until his retirement in 1956. During the Second World War he returned to work for the civil service, returning to his professorship at Edinburgh after the war. In 1948 he published a study of the life and doctrines of Adam Smith. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 1942. His proposers were Edmund Taylor Whittaker, Sir Ernest Wedderburn, James Pickering Kendall, and James Ritchie. He served as the Society's Vice-President 1948 to 1951. In addition to his economic writings, Gray was an active composer and translator of poetry. His work consisted of original poems written in English, and translations of the folk and ballad poetry of Germany and Denmark into Scots. Some of his work featured in Northern Numbers, a periodical founded and edited by Hugh MacDiarmid. Of his English poems, Scotland is internationally renowned, the third stanza being frequently quoted. This quote features on the Canongate Wall at the new Scottish Parliament building: > This is my country, > The land that begat me. > These windy spaces > Are surely my own. > And those who toil here > In the sweat of their faces > Are flesh of my flesh, > And bone of my bone. His translations into Scots constitute the greater part of his work, and is the main basis for his reputation. His translations include a collection of ballads, Arrows, from German, and Historical Ballads of Denmark and Four and Forty from Danish. He translated many German poets, including von Kotzebue, Müller, Uhland, Herder but, above all, Heine. He died in Edinburgh on 17 February 1968. Family In 1909 he married Alice Gunn.

The buildings grew from an old cow / tin-ore shed in the 19th century to a pottery in the 1920s with the addition of a two-storey cottage added on to the lower end of the pottery, followed by a completely separate cottage at the top of the site added by Leach in 1927. In 1922 Tsuronosuke Matsubayashi came from Japan to rebuild an unsuccessful climbing kiln for the pottery. Matsubayashi built a three chambered traditional Japanese Noborigama, the first Japanese climbing kiln in the western world, and this was used until the 1970s. Bernard's son David Leach who trained at the North Staffordshire Technical College, became manager in 1937 abandoning production of earthenware, developing a new stoneware body and taking on local apprentices. Michael Cardew was an early student and William Marshall an apprentice. Katherine Pleydell-Bouverie became an apprentice in 1924 Warren MacKenzie from the US, Charmian Johnson from Canada and Len Castle from New Zealand also worked here. The pottery's Standard Ware was first issued in 1946 and can be found in the V&A; collection. Mail order catalogues were distributed and the range was produced until 1979. Three basic glazes were used for the ware: Celadon, Tenmoku and oatmeal with overpainting in brown and blue. After Bernard's death in 1979, his wife Janet Leach stopped production of standard ware to concentrate on her own pots until her death in 1997, after which the pottery was purchased by Alan Gillam. The property was acquired by Penwith District Council as part of the Leach Restoration Project The site was renovated and restored in 2005-08 before being reopened to the public in March 2008 as a working studio pottery, museum and gallery. The restoration cost £1.7 million which preserved the original buildings whilst adding an exhibition space and shop. It is now managed by the Bernard Leach (St Ives) Trust Limited, a registered UK charity founded in 2005. There are two exhibition areas, the Entrance Gallery with work by Bernard Leach, Janet Leach, David Leach, Shoji Hamada, William Marshall, Michael Cardew, and Kenneth Quick and the Cube Gallery with a changing exhibition.

The game's villain had shut down all the Compuminds and hid them. Eventually one of the Compuminds, named Kakos, was found. Together, Rad and Kakos must find the eight missing Compuminds, each on eight different unique planets, such as the cyberpunk world of Cyberia, the green jungle world of Sauria, and the caustic trash world of Effluvia. The game was notable for the planet Turvia, where gravity works in reverse. In that level the protagonist was drawn upside down, as were the enemies and the entire screen. His early game attack consists of a sort of a lightsaber. A possible inspiration for Rad Gravity is the 1989 arcade game Strider, the protagonist of which uses a plasma sword and in two levels walks on the ceiling upside-down when local gravity is reversed.

He was president of the Ijaw Youth Council for a time beginning in 2001 and later founded the Niger Delta People's Volunteer Force which would become one of the most prominent armed groups operating in the Niger Delta region. He is a Muslim with populist views and an anti-government stance that have made him a folk hero amongst certain members of the local population.  Early life  Asari was born in 1964 into a middle class Christian family headed by a court judge and a housewife in Buguma, Rivers State, who also had four other children. He received both primary and secondary education in Port Harcourt and was accepted into law school at the University of Calabar but dropped out after only three years in 1990, citing problems with university authorities as his reason for doing so. He made other attempts to complete his education but his activism caused him to quit on his degree at Rivers State University of Science and Technology for reasons similar to those at Calabar, Cross Rivers State, Nigeria Activism After dropping out of school, Asari converted to Islam and changed his name to Mujahid Dokubo-Asari to reflect this. He spent much of the 1990s attempting to become involved in regional politics, running for two offices in Rivers State in 1992 and 1998 but failing to win on either. In 1998, the Ijaw Youth Council (IYC) was formed and Asari, as a founding member, was appointed to the vice- presidency of the organization. The organization issued the Kaiama Declaration in November, expressing long-held Ijaw concerns about the loss of control of their homeland and their own lives to the Nigerian state and oil companies operating in the region. The declaration and a letter addressed to oil companies called on them to suspend operations and withdraw from Ijaw territory. The IYC pledged “to struggle peacefully for freedom, self- determination and ecological justice,” and prepared a campaign of celebration, prayer, and direct action - 'Operation Climate Change' beginning December 28. The Nigerian government responded with an immediate crackdown on the group. Asari became the IYC's president in 2001 and led the group to pursue an agenda of \\"Resource Control and Self Determination By Every Means Necessary\\". By 2004, Asari had retreated from public view. He would go on to create the Niger Delta People's Volunteer Force (NDPVF), which would emerge as a major catalyst for unrest in the Delta region. The NDPVF, a militant group, was funded in large part by local and regional politicians who sought great profits from the region's oil revenue. The NDPVF quickly escalated an armed conflict with a rival group, known as the Niger Delta Vigilante (NDV), who were also seeking to control the Delta's oil resources. Combat was concentrated primarily in Warri and subsequently, Nigeria's oil capital Port Harcourt, as well as areas to the city's southwest. Both groups engaged in oil 'bunkering' and other illegal forms of local resource extraction. A change in political ideals by the NDPVF caused the group's former sponsors to withdraw their financial support, and begin funneling funds to the rival NDV. Asari's NDPVF then made a declaration of \\"all-out war\\" against the Nigerian state. Although Asari has clearly stated that he does not align himself with any particular Biafra independence organization, he has appeared at events in the past with Ralph Uwazurike of MASSOB. He has also in various interviews praised Nnamdi Kanu of the Indigenous People of Biafra.  Crisis and arrest  The threats to attack oil wells and pipelines by the NDPVF caused companies operating in the area to withdraw most of their personnel from the Delta, resulting in a massive drop in oil production of 30,000 barrels per day and pushing up the price of petroleum worldwide significantly. Due to the crisis this precipitated, Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo called Asari and the leader of the NDV, Ateke Tom to Abuja for peace talks which were in large part a failure. After his refusal to endorse the legitimacy of the Olusegun Obasanjo government and due to his public support for self-determination of his native Ijaw people and independence for the Niger Delta, Asari was arrested and charged with treason by the Nigerian federal government. On 14 June 2007, Asari was released on bail as part of new President Umaru Yar'Adua's pledge to try and bring peace to the Niger Delta region.  $10M annual cash payment for Asari Mujahid  As part of Yar'adua amnesty incentives to eliminate terrorist activities in the Niger Delta, the federal government awarded massive cash rewards to Asari and other terror leaders of the Niger Delta. Asari received an annual cash payment of USD$10 million a year from Abuja as part of the federal \\"pipeline security protection fee\\" to protect the Rivers State pipelines and creeks that the terrorists bombed, kidnapped and killed the workers and guards in the areas. Citizenship of the Republic of Benin In 2013, Dokubo Asari became a citizen of Benin and moved his wealth and assets out of the Niger Delta, Nigeria and relocated to Cotonou, Benin Republic where he built several schools, colleges and a university for the school children and students in Cotonou.

Life Nicolaus von Tüngen came from a Teutonic Prussian burgher family in Tüngen (Bogatyńskie) near Wormditt (Orneta) in Ermland (Warmia). He worked in the Roman Curia for many years as a secretary, and accumulated many church offices, including in 1459 becoming Canon of Breslau (Wrocław) and Canon of Warmia. After the death of Warmia's Bishop Paul von Legendorf, Tüngen was chosen as his successor by the Warmia diocese chapter on 10 August 1467. Tüngen received the pope's agreement for his nomination on 4 November 1468 and obtained the bishop's insignia in Rome. The king of Poland, Casimir IV, did not accept the choice of Tüngen as bishop. He instead nominated Wincenty Kiełbasa, the bishop of Chełmno (Kulm) and administrator of the Poznań diocese, as the new bishop of Warmia. The Warmia chapter accepted the king's will, entrusting Kiełbasa with temporary administration of the Warmia diocese at Malbork (Marienburg) Sejmik) on 1 December 1467. Tüngen did not withdraw his candidacy, however, and soon the papal provision strengthened Tüngen's position. In September 1469, Kiełbasa withdrew his claim to the Warmia bishopric. One year later, Tüngen unofficially arrived in Warmia. Kiełbasa's resignation did not mean the resignation of the Polish king from his aim of putting his own candidate in office. Casimir IV intervened with the pope, Paul II, who ordered Tüngen to resign the Warmia bishopric (his successor, Pope Sixtus IV, nominated Tüngen bishop of Kammin). The new candidate nominated for the post in 1471 was Andrzej Oporowski, archdeacon of Gniezno and a royal secretary. Oporowski's nomination did not change the situation in Warmia. The nominee was not allowed to assume his office because of protests from the clergy and people of Warmia and the Prussian Estates. At the same time, Nicolaus of Tüngen began to strive to obtain his desired bishopric. Supported by the Teutonic Knights, Tüngen gained control of most of Warmia's castles and towns. He also gained the support of the king of Hungary, Matthias Corvinus, then in conflict with Poland, entrusting him with protecting the bishopric. In 1478, Polish forces intervened militarily in Warmia and regained control of most of it. This armed conflict is known as the War of the Priests. In 1479, an agreement reached between Casimir II and Matthias Corvinus further weakened Tüngen's position. Peace negotiations to end the conflict took place in Piotrków Trybunalski. The agreement reached on 15 July 1479 affirmed that Warmia was under the Polish king's sovereignty and required the bishops of Warmia to swear an oath of fealty to him. The Warmia chapter was also required to elect as bishop a person to the liking of the king. As part of the agreement, Tüngen was allowed to remain Bishop of Warmia, after he paid homage to the king, entitling him to be a senator of Poland, like other Polish bishops. After 1479, bishop Tüngen made efforts to rebuild the diocese after the devastations caused by the war. Tüngen funded the altar in St. George's church in Königsberg, and in his will he gave large sums to the monasteries and churches of the diocese. Death and legacy Tüngen made efforts in Rome to nominate Lucas Watzenrode as coadjutor bishop. These efforts were interrupted by his death, yet his will was respected when the diocese chapter selected Watzenrode as the next bishop, taking advantage of the fact that the 1479 agreement did not specify which candidate was to be chosen.

Early life and career Born in Kristiania into two of Norway's most wealthy and politically influential families with large estates. His father Ole A. Stang was a businessman and landowner, while his mother Emma Heiberg was Queen Mauds most trusted confidante and mistress. His brother was Thomas Stang, and thus brother-in-law to actress Wenche Foss and uncle to the former mayor of Oslo Fabian Stang. Political life Stang first joined the Nasjonal Samling (NS) in 1933 and served as district leader in Glåmdal, although he was largely a minor figure before World War II.Philip Rees, Biographical Dictionary of the Extreme Right Since 1890, 1990, p. 372 After the invasion of Norway in April 1940 he was put in joint charge of the NS political staff with Ragnar Skancke. The Germans thought it wise to include him due to his family's close ties to the royal court and recommended that he be a part of the new government despite his lack of experience and commitment. In September he was appointed to Vidkun Quisling's collaborationist government as Minister of Labour and Sports, a heavily ideological department.David Littlejohn, The Patriotic Traitors, London: Heinemann, 1972, p. 19 In this role he passed a law making service in the Arbeidstjenesten (modeled after the German Reichsarbeitsdienst) compulsory in 1941.Littlejohn, The Patriotic Traitors, p. 24 He also made service of all children in the \\"NSUF\\" (modeled after the Hitlerjugend) compulsory, this proved a disaster as it infuriated the population and was later scrapped altogether. Also his attempts to force all sports club to join the Nasjonal Samling Sports Organisation proved a failure, leading to an almost total boycott of organised sport for the duration of the occupation.Littlejohn, The Patriotic Traitors, p. 35 Whilst continuing as a minister he also enrolled in the SS Division Nordland and won the Iron Cross Second Class after seeing action in the Balkans.Littlejohn, The Patriotic Traitors, pp. 27-8 He also served 8 weeks at the eastern front in Finland during the summer of 1941. He was generally considered to be moderate and amicable among contemporaries, but unable to resist neither his German advisors nor the Norwegian hardliners in the government. Later life After the war, in 1946, he was sentenced to life in prison for his involvement in collaboration, which was subsequently commuted to 20 years of hard labour. At his appeal to the supreme court, a minority of 3 judges voted for the death penalty, among them his own cousin, Emil Stang. He received a full pardon in 1956 and retired to his estate at Rømskog, where he remained until his death.Rees, Biographical Dictionary of the Extreme Right, p. 373 References 1904 births 1974 deaths People from Oslo Government ministers of Norway Members of Nasjonal Samling Waffen-SS foreign volunteers and conscripts People convicted of treason for Nazi Germany against Norway Prisoners sentenced to life imprisonment by Norway Norwegian prisoners sentenced to life imprisonment Recipients of Norwegian royal pardons Axel Heiberg Recipients of the Iron Cross (1939), 2nd class ","title":"Axel Heiberg Stang"},{"id":"4324666","text":"Fredrik Stang (27 December 1867 – 15 November 1941) was a Norwegian law professor and politician for the Conservative Party.

National Hydrography Dataset high-resolution flowline data. The National Map, accessed January 3, 2012 blackwater river in the U.S. state of Michigan that flows in a generally eastward direction through the eastern end of the Upper Peninsula. It drains approximately of the Upper Peninsula, including large sections of Luce County and Chippewa County. It begins in the Tahquamenon Lakes in northeast Columbus Township of Luce County and empties into Lake Superior near the village of Paradise. M-123 runs alongside a portion of the river. Name The meaning of \\"Tahquamenon\\" is not known. Some called it the \\"River of the Head Winds\\" because they bucked the wind on the lower river no matter what direction they were paddling. Others called it the \\"River of a Hundred Bends\\". Twentieth century descendants of local Chippewa translated the name to mean \\"river up against a hill\\" or \\"lost river island\\" or \\"river with an island part way\\". In 1930 Jesuit scholar, Father William Gagnieut, concluded that the meaning of the name had been lost.\\"Tahquamenon Country\\", p. 2 Recorded variously as 'Otikwaminang,' 'Outakwamenon,' 'Tequamenen', 'Tanguamanon,' 'Tanquamanon,' 'Toumequellen' and 'Tahquamenaw', several suggestions on the meaning of its name have been made over the years: * The origin of the present spelling can be traced to a Jesuit map of Lake Superior published in 1672 that named the small island lying off the river mouth as \\"Outa koua minan'. The early French travelers called the Great Lakes region natives \\"Outaouaks\\".\\"Tahquamenon Country\\", p. 3. * \\"Shortcut.\\" The name referring originally to Tahquamenon Bay, which the Ojibwe used as a shortcut while traveling. The bay has a small island in it that facilitated the \\"shortcut\\" from Whitefish Point across the open and at times dangerous bay. The name \\"shortcut\\" was later given to the River that enters into the bay.Michigan Place Names However, although 'taqua' (dakwaa) does mean \\"short\\", the suffix for \\"road\\" or \\"trail\\" is -mon in Ojibwe, not 'menon', and although -ing would be a locative suffix, the locative form of -mon is -moong and not -moning. However, in the Algonquin language, the locative form of -mon would be -monaang, closely resembling 'menon'. Additionally, in the Potawatomi language, suffix for \\"road\\" or \\"trail\\" is -mii, and like in the Algonquin language, the locative form of -mii would be -miinaang, most closely resembling 'menon'. * \\"Marsh of the blueberries,\\" though 'menon' (miinan) does mean \\"blueberries\\" in the Ojibwa language, 'tahqua' does not mean \\"marsh\\" * \\"Short cornel\\" where 'tahqua' (dakwaa) does mean \\"short\\" and 'manan' (maanan) does mean \\"cornel\\", but cornels do not grow in swamplands * \\"Ottawa's good land\\" (Odaawaag minaang) due to an Ottawa village that used to be located near the mouth of the river * \\"Dark-colored water\\".Waldman, Carl and Molly Braun. of the North American Indian, p. 386 Although the river's water is dark, the word for \\"dark-colored water\\" in Ojibwe is makadewaagamin. The current name for the Tahquamenon River in the Ojibwa language is Adikamegong-ziibi \\"River where the Whitefish are found.\\" This name is also the naming basis for the Whitefish Point and Whitefish Bay, both known earlier as \\"Tahquamenaw\\". Tahquamenon Falls The river is best known for the Tahquamenon Falls, a succession of two waterfalls in Tahquamenon Falls State Park totalling approximately in height. Because the headwaters of the river are located in a boreal wetland that is rich in cedar, spruce and hemlock trees, the river's waters carry a significant amount of tannin in solution (i.e., it is a blackwater river), and are often brown or golden-brown in color. The Tahquamenon Falls are thus acclaimed as being the largest naturally dyed or colored waterfall in the United States. The state park preserves the falls area and some of the river. Recreation In Henry Wadsworth Longfellow's famous poem, The Song of Hiawatha (1855), the hero learned how to paddle a birchbark canoe in the Tahquamenon. The river is often used for canoeing to this day. The river's watershed and state park are also extensively used for fishing and hiking. In winter, the watershed welcomes snowmobilers. Tour boat The Toonerville Trolley Train and Riverboat Tour, a private firm, offers boat tours of the upper Tahquamenon as part of an overall family experience that includes a narrow-gauge rail ride and visit to the Upper Tahquamenon Falls.
