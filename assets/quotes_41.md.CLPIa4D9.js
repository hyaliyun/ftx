William Redd opened the resort as the Peppermill Resort in 1976, and later renamed it as Si Redd's Oasis. Until 1990, the Oasis was the only casino in Mesquite. In 2001, Redd sold the Oasis to Randy Black Sr. and Black Gaming. Portions of the Oasis were closed in December 2008, due to financial losses. The Oasis' casino was closed in 2010, although the hotel was still used for overflow guests at Black Gaming's other Mesquite casinos. The Oasis was demolished in 2013. History The property began in the 1960s, as the Western Village Truck Stop, with 28 motel rooms and 23 slot machines. In 1976, William \\"Si\\" Redd who founded the slot machine company International Game Technology purchased the struggling property and turned it into the Peppermill Resort, later renamed as Si Redd's Oasis. The Oasis was the only casino in Mesquite until 1990, when the Virgin River opened. A renovation was completed in 1995, which added a few hundred rooms to the hotel. In October 1996, Redd turned over control of the Oasis to his son-in-law, Alan Green, who was named as president and sole director. Redd's daughters, Sarah Green and Vinnie Copeland, were named trustees of the William S. Redd Family Trust, which owned the property. By 1997, management had changed several times at the Oasis in recent years, which was seen as evidence of possible problems at the resort, including new competition. In December 1999, the Mesquite City Council was sued for its decision to deny the installation of a 99-foot sign advertising the resort's Oasis Casino Liquor Store. In June 2001, employees at the Oasis had to reapply for their jobs at the resort when it was sold to Randy Black Sr. for $31 million, despite monopoly concerns; the Black family already owned two of the city's four casinos, and the Oasis gave them 91 percent of the city's casino hotel rooms, 85 percent of the city's table games, and 80 percent of the city's slot machines. Employees alleged that Black had lied to them and was planning to demote veteran employees and cut their salaries. Black claimed that he rehired 800 of the Oasis' 900 employees, and that any salary cuts would be caused by Mesquite market conditions. At the time, Redd said about the purchase, \\"I had lost touch with who I was -- my thing was tinkering with machines. I was never really a casino owner. The Oasis was a good idea and it was fun, but it never really was a money maker because it was not managed right.\\" Black took possession of the Oasis on July 1, 2001. The property generated a negative income of $900,000 during the third quarter of 2008, while Black Gaming's revenues dropped 23 percent during the same period, both due to a decline in tourism. In November 2008, after defaulting on a loan, Black Gaming considered briefly closing one of its three casinos, but the company did not specify which one could close or when the closure could occur. On December 1, 2008, Black Gaming announced plans to temporarily close the Oasis' casino, restaurants and night clubs on December 5, cutting 500 jobs as part of a bank agreement. The casino's 27 table games were closed on December 1, while other casino and restaurant operations would be gradually phased out by December 5. Restaurant operations were expected to cease on the night of December 5. Some slot machines were left operational at the resort's front counter to maintain a nonrestricted gaming license. Black said that \\"no assurances\\" could be made as to when the Oasis' facilities could reopen. The resort's hotel, RV park, golf course, and gun club were expected to remain open, as well as its timeshare facilities: the 34-unit Grand Destinations Vacation Club and the 39-unit Peppermill Palms at Mesquite, a total of 73 units. On December 5, much of the 900-room hotel was closed, leaving only 100 rooms. The casino's number of slot machines was reduced from 750 to 144. The casino's Denny's restaurant, owned by a separate company, remained open as well. The Oasis was among the top three employers in Mesquite, along with Black Gaming's other two resorts. Ultimately, 347 employees were laid off. In February 2009, Black Gaming's bank agreement was extended, allowing it to continue with reduced operations. That month, the Mesquite City Council extended the Oasis' gaming and liquor permits until July 31, 2009. In May 2009, Black Gaming closed a miniature golf course and go-kart track located on the property, and announced plans to close the Denny's restaurant on May 31, 2009. During a 2010 Chapter 11 hearing, company officials considered demolition of the Oasis. On May 19, 2010, Randy Black Sr. said there was no timetable for demolition, and stated that the resort could reopen entirely if the local economy improved. At that time, 16 slot machines remained operational at the casino. The same day, Black Gaming announced plans to demolish the Oasis, which was considered an \\"outdated, inefficient property.\\" Demolition was expected to begin in June 2010, with a cost of $1.1 million. At least 300 hotel rooms were expected to be kept and remain operational, depending on business conditions. No plans for the property's future had been decided at that time. Up to that point, the hotel, RV park, and convention facilities had been used only on an overflow basis for Black Gaming's other resorts when they were fully occupied. In June 2010, Black Gaming announced plans to cease operations of its 16 slot machines, and announced that nearly 400 hotel rooms would remain after demolition. The casino closed that year. In July 2011, Mesquite Gaming LLC took over operations of Black Gaming's resorts, including the Oasis, which was still being used for hotel guest overflow. At that time, five timeshare units were being maintained, while the new company was considering a refurbishment of the property, contingent on an improving economy. Demolition began on May 4, 2013, and was scheduled to last three months. The casino, six hotel buildings, a spa building, a pool, and the go-kart track were expected to be demolished. Approximately 90 percent of demolished materials from the buildings were expected to be recycled and re-used. Anthony Toti, chief executive officer of Mesquite Gaming, said the company would \\"start something very nice in a couple years\\" on the property. The Oasis' two timeshare buildings and its RV park were not demolished. A pedestrian bridge was also kept for future use. =Incidents= On March 10, 1996, Butch Laswell, a stunt performer from nearby Logandale, died while performing a televised motorcycle stunt on a pedestrian bridge connected to the Oasis. The resort paid $100,000 to set up the stunt, which attracted 23,000 spectators. In July 2000, an eight-year-old girl was sexually assaulted by a Utah man who lured her away from the resort's Family Fun Center Arcade. The girl's family sued the Oasis for a lack of adequate security in February 2001, seeking $5 million in punitive damages. On the night of May 13, 2005, the Oasis was partially evacuated when a Utah man began firing gunshots inside a hotel room. After a two-hour standoff and several unsuccessful attempts to contact the man, police entered the room and found that the man had shot and killed himself.

It is a negative element in mu'amalat fiqh (transactional Islamic jurisprudence), like riba (usury) and maysir (gambling). One Islamic dictionary (A Concise Dictionary of Islamic Terms) describes it as \\"the sale of what is not present\\" ‚Äî such as fish not yet caught, crops not yet harvested. Similarly, author Muhammad Ayub says that \\"in the legal terminology of jurists\\", gharar is \\"the sale of a thing which is not present at hand, or the sale of a thing whose aqibah (consequence) is not known, or a sale involving hazard in which one does not know whether it will come to be or not\\". Definitions, fiqh According to Sami Al-Suwailem, \\"researchers in Islamic finance\\" do not agree on the \\"precise meaning\\" of gharar, although there is not necessarily great difference among the Islamic schools of jurisprudence (madhab) in the term's definition. The Hanafi legal school defines gharar as \\"that whose consequences are hidden\\", (according to Sami Al-Suwailem). According to Md Akther Uddin, scholars of Hanafi school of fiqh (Islamic jurisprudence) have defined gharar as ‚Äúsomething which its consequence is undetermined.‚Äù Sarakhsi, an Islamic scholar of the Hanafi school, described gharar as \\"‚Äúanything that the end result is hidden or the risk is equally uncommon, whether it exists or not.‚Äù Similarly, the Shafi legal school defined gharar (according to Sami al- Suwailem) as \\"that whose nature and consequences are hidden\\" or \\"that which admits two possibilities, with the less desirable one being more likely.\\" Scholars of Shafi‚Äôi fiqh have described it as ‚Äúsomething which in its manner and its consequence is hidden.\\" The Hanbali school defined it as \\"that whose consequences are unknown\\" or \\"that which is undeliverable, whether it exists or not.\\" Ibn Hazm of the Zahiri school of jurisprudence wrote \\"Gharar is where the buyer does not know what he bought, or the seller does not know what he sold.\\" To the Islamic scholar Al-Qarafi, gharar is \\"that which has a pleasant appearance and a hated essence\\". Among modern scholars of Islam, Mustafa Al- Zarqa has written that \\"Gharar is the sale of probable items whose existence or characteristics are not certain, due to the risky nature that makes the trade similar to gambling.\\" Sami al-Suwailem, has used Game Theory to try and reach a more exact, measurable definition of Gharar, defining it as \\"a zero- sum game with unequal payoffs\\". Scripture While the word Gharar is not specifically mentioned in the Quran, two verses (2:188; 4:29) are thought to refer to it. There are \\"numerous hadiths\\" forbidding Gharar sales according to the Academy for International Modern Studies. In one, Ahmad and Ibn Majah narrated on the authority of Abu-Said al-Khudriy that: > The Prophet (pbuh) has forbidden the purchase of the unborn animal in the > mother's womb, the sale of the milk in the udder without measurement, the > purchase of spoils of war prior to their distribution, the purchase of > charities prior to their receipt, and the purchase of the catch of a diver. Varieties In Islamic economics and finance, jurists have tried to sort out different aspects of gharar to determine whether a given financial transaction is \\"shariah-compliant\\" or not when gharar is present. Because some amount of gharar is \\"always present in all contracts and conducts\\", Islamic scholars (at least in recent years) generally divide gharar into two types: *Gharar fahish (\\"excess\\" gharar) (also gharar-e-kathir, \\"too much\\" gharar) is prohibited (haram) and discussed in ahadith *Gharar yasir (\\"light\\" gharar) (also gharar qalil, \\"nominal\\" gharar) refers to small or trivial amounts of gharar which are tolerated (halal). = When not prohibited = Four conditions where gharar is not invalidated are:Al-Darir, M. S. (1997). Al-Gharar in Contracts and Its Effects on Contemporary Transactions, IDB Eminent Scholars‚Äô Lecture Series, no. 16 (IDB/IRTI, Jeddah). Cited in: Al-Zuhayli, W. (1997). Al-Fiqh Al-Islami wa Adillatuh (Dar Al-Fikr, Damascus). vol. 5, pp. 3415‚Äì31), Cited in: El-Gamal, M. (2001). ‚ÄúAn Economic Explication of the Prohibition of Gharar in Classical Islamic Jurisprudence,‚Äù Islamic Economic Studies, 8(2). Cited in: *in the aforementioned gharar yasir; *where the contract is \\"unilateral or charitable\\" (al tabarru'at) so that the other party to the contract is not exploited, such as a gift or bequest; *where there is a \\"public need for the transaction or contract\\" (maslahah, for example in the Islamic finance instruments of bay' al salam and istisna\`); *where risk (ghurm) \\"inherent in productive economic activities\\". While both gharar and riba (Usury) are negative elements in Islamic economics, there is much less material available about gharar in the literature of Islamic economics and finance than there is on riba, and \\"ghara is considered to be of less significance than Riba.\\" According to Muhammad Ayub, \\"a consensus\\" among Islamic scholars has emerged in the recent past \\"regarding its extent rendering any transaction valid or void\\". While the slightest involvement of Riba makes a transaction non- Shariah-compliant, some degree of Gharar\\" is acceptable. =Insurance and Takaful= Orthodox Islamic scholars argue that commercial insurance (as opposed to social or cooperative insurance) contains gharar and is haram (forbidden). In its place takaful or cooperative insurance \\"built on principles of voluntary contribution and mutual cooperation\\" has been proposed. =Khatar= Khatar (ÿÆÿ∑ÿ±) is a kind of gharar that occurs when the \\"liability of any of the parties to a commutative contract is, or becomes, uncertain or contingent on some unforeseen/uncontrollable event\\", according to the Islamic Investment and Finance website.

A mix of mystery, horror, and science fiction, the novel follows four strangers stranded on a mysterious planet who must work together to stay alive. Plot Traveling in sleeper pods to their first assignment on the Imperial flagship, new recruits Deilani, Salmagard, and Nils wake to find themselves on a strange, dying ship. A fourth pod supposedly holds an Admiral, but the man they awaken does not seem like any military officer they have ever encountered before. As the danger of their predicament increases, they must put aside their varying degrees of mistrust for the mysterious Admiral if they want to survive. Narrative Written from the first person point of view, Admiral combines military science fiction with elements of mystery and horror. Matt Stagg of Suvudu wrote, \\"With its warring empires and mix of aristocrat officers, fixers, scientists, and low-born grunts, Admiral reminded me of an earlier wave of science-fiction,\\" citing authors like Larry Niven, Isaac Asimov, and Harry Harrison, as well as the role-playing game Traveller. Danker called the novel \\"science fiction with a throwback premise and modern execution\\". He added that though the story is told from the title character's perspective, \\"there are four principal characters, and four key junctures where four distinct worldviews manifest during the crisis ... Everyone has a role to play. Those roles aren't all equally glamorous, but they're all equally important.\\" Writing for Nerd Much, Elizabeth Bernstein explained, \\"The tension mounts throughout the book as the characters continually solve one problem, only to be immediately faced with something more dire.\\" Reception Though noting that Admiral \\"workmanlike quality shows skill\\", Publishers Weekly criticized the novel's lack of character development, calling it \\"flat and unremarkable\\". Kirkus Reviews described the novel as a \\"not-very-thrilling thriller dressed up in mediocre sci-fi clothing\\". Bernstein called it \\"a fun, atmospheric story\\" and \\"thrilling\\". Sequels Admiral is the first novel in what Danker calls the \\"Evagardian series\\", which in May 2016 the author said had already been written in its entirety. A sequel, Free Space, was published in May 2017. The plot begins immediately after the events of Admiral. This was followed by The Glory of the Empress (2018) and Innocence (2019). In 2020 Danker published Almayer Station, a novel set in the same universe centering on Lieutenant Deilani and not featuring the Admiral.

The KX gene codes for a novel protein with characteristics of membrane transporters that has been proposed to be a Na+ -dependent neutral amine and/or oligopeptide transporter. It is predicted to be 444 amino acyl residues in length and exhibits 10 putative transmembrane Œ±-helical segments. The KX blood group antigen mRNA expression pattern correlates with McLeod syndrome. Structure Two covalently linked proteins, Kell and XK, constitute the Kell blood group system. Kell, a 93-Kd type II glycoprotein, is highly polymorphic and carries all but one of the known Kell antigens, and XK, which traverses the membrane ten times, carries a single antigen, the ubiquitous Kx. Transport Reaction The generalized reactions proposed to be catalyzed by KXA family members are: : 1) Amino acid or peptide (out) ‚Üí Amino acid or peptide (in) : 2) Phospholipid (inner monolayer of the plasma membrane) ‚Üí Phospholipid (outer monolayer of the plasma membrane) McLeod Syndrome The X-linked McLeod syndrome is defined by absent Kx red blood cell antigen and weak expression of Kell antigens. Most carriers of this McLeod blood group phenotype have acanthocytosis and elevated serum creatine kinase levels and are prone to develop a severe neurological disorder resembling Huntington's disease. Onset of neurological symptoms ranges between 25 and 60 years, and the penetrance of the disorder appears to be high. Additional symptoms of the McLeod neuroacanthocytosis syndrome that warrant therapeutic and diagnostic considerations include generalized seizures, neuromuscular symptoms leading to weakness and atrophy, and cardiopathy mainly manifesting with atrial fibrillation, malignant arrhythmias and dilated cardiomyopathy. Apoptosis A classic feature of apoptotic cells is the cell-surface exposure of phosphatidylserine (PtdSer) as an 'eat me' signal for engulfment. Suzuki et al. showed that the Xk-family protein Xkr8 mediates PtdSer exposure in response to apoptotic stimuli. Mouse Xkr8(-/-) cells or human cancer cells in which Xkr8 expression was repressed by hypermethylation failed to expose PtdSer during apoptosis and were inefficiently engulfed by phagocytes. Xkr8 was activated directly by caspases and required a caspase-3 cleavage site for its function. CED-8, the only Caenorhabditis elegans Xk-family homolog, also promoted apoptotic PtdSer exposure and cell-corpse engulfment. Thus, Xk-family proteins have evolutionarily conserved roles in promoting the phagocytosis of dying cells by altering the phospholipid distribution in the plasma membrane. Chen et al. report that CED-8, a Caenorhabditis elegans protein implicated in controlling the kinetics of apoptosis and a homologue of the XK family proteins, is a substrate of the CED-3 caspase. Cleavage of CED-8 by CED-3 activates its proapoptotic function and generates a carboxyl-terminal cleavage product, acCED-8, that promotes PS externalization in apoptotic cells and can induce ectopic PS exposure in living cells. Consistent with its role in promoting PS externalization in apoptotic cells, ced-8 is important for cell corpse engulfment in C. elegans. Thus, there is a link between caspase activation and PS externalization, which triggers phagocytosis of apoptotic cells.

Currently at the Museum of the American Revolution. General George Washington used a pair of campaign tents (marquees) throughout much of the American Revolutionary War. In warm weather, he used one for dining with his officers and aides, and the other as his military office and sleeping quarters. Canvas panels and poles from both tents survive, and are currently owned by four separate historical organizations. Revolutionary War Washington's headquarters staff consisted of his military secretary and (usually) four aides-de-camp. The office tent was their workplace, where they managed the commander-in-chief's correspondence and made copies of his orders. A divided section of the tent was where Washington slept. His enslaved valet William Lee also slept there. The dining tent was used for meals. Washington's first pair of campaign tents were made by Philadelphia upholsterer Plunket Fleeson in Spring 1776. They were used at the first Middlebrook encampment (1777) in the Washington Valley near Middlebrook, New Jersey: > The Army is now drawn together at this place, at least that part of it, > which have been Cantoned all Winter in this state. The whole of them now > Encamped in Comfortable Tents on a Valley covered in front and rear by > ridges which affords us security. His excellency our good Old General, has > also spread his Tent, and lives amongst us. Footnote 1 has an excerpt from a > letter from Gen. George Weedon to John Page dated May 31, 1777. The first pair of tents were used until the end of the 1777-78 winter encampment at Valley Forge. New tents were ordered by Deputy Quartermaster General James Abeel in June 1778, but the maker was not identified.George Washington Slept Here, from Valley Forge National Historical Park. > There were two marqu√©es attached to the headquarters during all the > campaigns. The larger, or banqueting tent, would contain from forty to fifty > persons; the smaller, or sleeping tent, had an inner-chamber, where, on a > hard cot-bed, the chief reposed. Within its venerable folds, Washington was > in the habit of seeking privacy and seclusion, where he could commune with > himself, and where he wrote the most memorable of his despatches in the > Revolutionary war.George Washington Parke Custis, Recollections and Private > Memoirs of Washington, (New York: Derby & Jackson, 1860), p. 279. In 2017, Philip Mead, chief historian at the Museum of the American Revolution in Philadelphia, and museum curators determined that a panoramic watercolor painting by Pierre Charles L'Enfant was of the 1782 encampment at Verplanck's Point and depicted the office/sleeping tent in field use. Civil War The panels and poles from both tents were inherited by Martha Washington's grandson, George Washington Parke Custis. He passed them on to his daughter, Mary Anna Custis Lee, and her husband, Robert E. Lee. Their enslaved housekeeper, Selina Norris Gray, kept the tent fabric safe when Union Army soldiers ransacked Arlington House during the American Civil War. The tents were among the Washington artifacts seized by the federal government in January 1862, and the grounds of Arlington House were converted into Arlington National Cemetery. Later history The tents were exhibited at the U.S. Patent Office, and transferred to the Smithsonian Institution in 1881. It wasn't until 1901, nearly 40 years after their seizure, that the tents and Washington artifacts were returned to the Lees' son, George Washington Custis Lee. In 1909, the exterior of the office/sleeping tent was purchased by Reverend Dr. W. Herbert Burk for the Valley Forge Museum of American History, predecessor to the Valley Forge Historical Society. It was exhibited in a museum on the grounds of the 1777-1778 Valley Forge encampment. Current locations Office/sleeping tent, on exhibit at the Museum of the American Revolution in Philadelphia, in 2017 Pieces of the tents are currently owned by four different historical organizations: * Colonial National Historical Park owns the interior of the dining tent roof, the office/sleeping tent interior, and the poles of the office/sleeping tent. All of these items are currently on display at the Yorktown Battlefield Visitor Center. * The Mount Vernon Ladies' Association owns the linen door to the office/sleeping tent. * The Museum of the American Revolution owns the exterior of the office/sleeping tent, poles of the dining tent, and a storage trunk.

History The Buttercups Sanctuary started in 1989 when Robert and Valerie Hitch took over the care of two goats from the RSPCA. As more goats arrived, having become unwanted or been neglected, the costs of keeping them soared, so they were granted charity status by the Charity Commission for England and Wales in September 2003. Animal welfare A goat at Buttercups Sanctuary The sanctuary now cares for over 140 goats and provides care to approximately an additional 120 goats in foster homes. Common problems for goats arriving at the sanctuary include malnutrition and ailments such as rainscald, foot rot, mud fever and other skin conditions. They may also be infested with worms. Neglect and cruelty may also mean, that on arrival, the animals may be very mistrustful of humans. Yet, many do recover human trust again. Educational work The sanctuary offers student work-placements to assist with their studies.

Discovery HPyV12 was first discovered in 2013 by generic PCR used to screen samples of the organs of the gastrointestinal tract. HPyV12 was identified first and most commonly in liver samples; it was also occasionally detected in the colon and rectum and in feces. Taxonomy The HPyV12 genome follows the typical organization for a polyomavirus, containing a small and large tumor antigen and three viral capsid proteins; it has no open reading frame corresponding to an agnoprotein. In the 2015 taxonomic update to the polyomavirus group, the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses classified HPyV12 as a member of the genus Alphapolyomaviridae, whose type species is murine polyomavirus (Mus musculus polyomavirus 1). In 2018, it was renamed to Sorex araneus polyomavirus 1. Prevalence The prevalence of HPyV12 is not well characterized. A survey of seroprevalence ‚Äî that is, prevalence of detectable antibodies against viral proteins indicating either past or present exposure ‚Äî found that between 15‚Äì33% of healthy adults exhibited evidence of exposure, with slightly lower rates in children.

She was a Labor member of the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly from 2016 to 2020, representing the electorate of Braitling, defeating former Chief Minister Adam Giles in a major upset. Early life and career Wakefield was born in Melbourne. She obtained a degree in social work from Latrobe and Monash University. After working in road trauma rehabilitation, Wakefield moved to Alice Springs in 2004. She has been a member of the Alice Springs Health Governing Council and was Chairwoman and Board member of Central Australian Women's Legal Service. Before entering politics, she ran the Alice Springs Women's Shelter for eight years. She was a NT finalist for the 2015 Telstra Business Women Awards. Politics Wakefield stood against Chief Minister Adam Giles in the 2016 election, in the south Alice Springs seat of Braitling. Going into the election, Braitling was the fourth-safest seat in the Territory; Wakefield needed a 19.6 percent swing to win it. Like Alice Springs as a whole, Braitling had long been considered Country Liberal Party (CLP) heartland; it had only been out of the party's hands for two terms since its creation in 1984, when CLP-turned-independent Loraine Braham held it 2001 to 2008. Labor had never won an inner Alice Springs seat before (though it held at least one remote-based seat that spilled into Alice Springs from 1983 to 2012), and had never come particularly close to winning Braitling. For example, even during the CLP's near-meltdown in 2005, Labor was pushed into third place behind Braham and the CLP. However, amid the massive Labor wave that swept through the Territory on election night, Wakefield was ahead of Giles as counting began. Preliminary returns had Giles on 49.9 percent to Wakefield's 50.1 percent‚Äîa lead that increased as returns came in during the week after the election. This was mainly because Giles lost 20 percent of his primary vote from 2012. While he was still 10 points ahead of Wakefield on the first count, Wakefield narrowly pulled ahead on preferences. By 2 September, Wakefield led Giles by 23 votes‚Äîwell within the threshold for a recount under Territory election law. The recount took place on 5 September, and confirmed that Wakefield was still leading on a knife-edge. When the final result was announced, Wakefield won the seat with a margin of 27 votes on a swing of 19.9 percent. This made Wakefield just the second challenger to oust a sitting Majority Leader/Chief Minister in their own seat, and the third to unseat a major-party leader in the Territory.Green, Antony. Northern Territory Election Result Updates. ABC News, 2016-08-28. She is also the first Labor member to represent an inner Alice Springs seat. Soon after her victory was confirmed, Wakefield was named to Cabinet as Minister for Territory Families. Despite a redistribution making Braitling contain a higher margin in favour of Labor, the 2020 Northern Territory election saw Wakefield defeated by CLP challenger Joshua Burgoyne with a swing of 4 points.

Chicago Lectures in Mathematics. University of Chicago Press, Chicago, IL, 2000. ; p. 87 because of its importance for the subject. Occasionally the name \\"fundamental observation in geometric group theory\\" is now used for this statement, instead of calling it the ≈†varc‚ÄìMilnor lemma; see, for example, Theorem 8.2 in the book of Farb and Margalit.Benson Farb, and Dan Margalit, A primer on mapping class groups. Princeton Mathematical Series, 49. Princeton University Press, Princeton, NJ, 2012. ; p. 224 Precise statement Several minor variations of the statement of the lemma exist in the literature (see the Notes section below). Here we follow the version given in the book of Bridson and Haefliger (see Proposition 8.19 on p. 140 there).M. R. Bridson and A. Haefliger, Metric spaces of non-positive curvature. Grundlehren der Mathematischen Wissenschaften [Fundamental Principles of Mathematical Sciences], vol. 319. Springer-Verlag, Berlin, 1999. Let G be a group acting by isometries on a proper length space X such that the action is properly discontinuous and cocompact. Then the group G is finitely generated and for every finite generating set S of G and every point p\\\\in X the orbit map :f_p:(G,d_S)\\\\to X, \\\\quad g\\\\mapsto gp is a quasi-isometry. Here d_S is the word metric on G corresponding to S. Notes In many sources the ≈†varc‚ÄìMilnor lemma is stated under a slightly more restrictive assumption that the space X be a geodesic metric space (rather that a length space), and most applications concern this context. Sometimes a properly discontinuous cocompact isometric action of a group G on a proper geodesic metric space X is called a geometric action.I. Kapovich, and N. Benakli, Boundaries of hyperbolic groups. Combinatorial and geometric group theory (New York, 2000/Hoboken, NJ, 2001), pp. 39‚Äì93, Contemp. Math., 296, American Mathematical Society, Providence, RI, 2002, ; Convention 2.22 on p. 46 Explanation of the terms Recall that a metric X space is proper if every closed ball in X is compact. An action of G on X is properly discontinuous if for every compact K\\\\subseteq X the set :\\\\\\\\{g\\\\in G \\\\mid gK\\\\cap K e \\\\varnothing\\\\\\\\} is finite. The action of G on X is cocompact if the quotient space X/G, equipped with the quotient topology, is compact. Under the other assumptions of the ≈†varc‚ÄìMilnor lemma, the cocompactness condition is equivalent to the existence of a closed ball B in X such that :\\\\bigcup_{g\\\\in G} gB=X. Examples of applications of the ≈†varc‚ÄìMilnor lemma For Examples 1 through 5 below see pp. 89‚Äì90 in the book of de la Harpe.

Gordon's early work focused on color vision and how this interacted with memory. Her work shifted mid-career and then she started to research within the realm of education. Specifically, she published work that addressed women's education with regard to the notion that women must be educated differently from men. Her focus of research shifted once more later on in life and started to keen in on imagination and how it related to her earlier works of memory and emotion.  Early life  Kate Gordon was born on February 18, 1878, to William A. Gordon and Helen J. Gordon. Kate had an older brother, also named William, as well as a younger brother named George J. and a younger sister named Sarah. Kate‚Äôs maternal grandfather, a clergyman, was born in Ireland, while her maternal grandmother was born in New York. Her paternal grandparents were both born in the U.S. Kate‚Äôs family had strong scientific and social values. Kate Gordon‚Äôs father was a physician and a surgeon, a profession that her brother would also eventually take on. Kate Gordon married Ernest Carroll Moore, an educator and philosopher in March 1943. Gordon met Moore at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), where they both worked. They were married until Earnest‚Äôs death in 1955. Kate died nearly ten years later in 1963, at the age of 85 from a brief illness. Education Kate Gordon enrolled at the University of Chicago in 1896 and received her PhB in 1900 and her PhD in 1903. In the winter of 1903-1904, Gordon studied psychology in Germany at the University of Wurzburg as a fellow. During her tenure in Europe, she had also attributed to the German Psychological Periodical with her research she had conducted while in Germany. Gordon was also the first woman to receive membership to the German Society for Experimental Psychology. Career From 1904 - 1906 she was the instructor of psychology at Mount Holyoke College and from 1906‚Äì07 she continued teaching at the Teachers College of Columbia University. During this time she focused her research towards assessing color vision in regards to the peripheral retina and the aesthetics of color. In 1908 she became a surveyor of educational institutions in Europe which was granted to her by Bryn Mawr College. This opportunity gave Gordon an opportunity to research aesthetics by allowing her to visit a number of international art congresses that took part in Europe. 1912‚Äì16 she held the position of associate professor of education at Bryn Mawr College upon her arrival back into the United States. During this time she also was the head of the department of education. This was also noted as the time when Gordon began researching education, specifically mental tests for schools. 1916‚Äì19 she was an assistant professor of psychology and education at the Carnegie Institute of Technology which quickly resulted into her becoming the associate professor at the Institute from 1919‚Äì21. During this time period, she was also a called for to be a consultant for the Children's Department of the State Board of Control of California where she would help develop mental tests and differing testing programs for children. Gordon, in 1922, then moved on to the Southern Branch of the University of California, or known today as the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) where she was continually employed until her death. In 1922 she was a lecturer of psychology and in 1923 she became an associate professor of the psychology department. In 1934, she became a full professor and also held summer school classes at Stanford University, University of Washington, University of Wyoming, and the University of Wisconsin. In 1930 she was given the opportunity following the death of her college, Shepherd Ivory Franz, to serve as the chair of the UCLA psychology department. Her work shifted once more at this time and focused primarily on the imagination and how it affected the previous psychology she had studied. In addition to this, she also served as the President of the Faculty Women's Group and the President of the Western Psychological Association. During her time at UCLA she developed a scholarship in education under her husband's name at the university, which is known as the Ernest Carroll Moore Scholarship. Dr. Kate Gordon retired in 1948 and was quickly given the position of professor emerita and even came back to UCLA to hold lectures when she was needed. During her career, Kate Gordon published a number of research papers, all on the various topics under the branch of cognitive psychology. The main areas of cognitive psychology that she focused on are color vision and perception, as well as aesthetics, memory, imagination, and attention span. In one of her papers, which was published while she was completing her Ph.D. at the University of Chicago in 1902, Gordon reviews the work of a Mr. W. McDougall. In this paper she states that there are issues with McDougall‚Äôs rejection of the Hering-Muller theory of light and color vision, and his support for the Young-McDougall theory, for which she stated, ‚Äúthere are certain facts which offer difficulties.‚Äù Gordon also wrote and published numerous textbooks for college students studying psychology; two such textbooks are Esthetics and Educational Psychology. Achievements and awards Gordon received the following awards: * 1903 The Collegiate Alumnae Association awarded Dr. Kate Gordon a fellowship in Europe * 1904 First woman to become a member of the German Society for Experimental Psychology * 1941 The Alumni Association at the University of Chicago awarded Dr. Kate Gordon a citation for public service as their \\"most useful citizen\\" of the year.

This article offers a chronological list of productions directed by Konstantin Stanislavski. It does not include theatrical productions in which Stanislavski only acted. Until he was thirty three, Stanislavski appeared only as an amateur onstage and as a director, as a result of his family's discouragement.Benedetti (1999a, 21, 24) and Carnicke (2000, 11). The prospect of becoming a professional actor was taboo for someone of Stanislavski's social class; actors had an even lower social status in Russia than in the rest of Europe, having only recently been serfs and the property of the nobility. When he was twenty five, he helped to establish a Society of Art and Literature, which aimed to unite amateur and professional actors and artists.Magarshack (1950, 52, 55‚Äì56). His professional career began in 1896 when he co-founded the Moscow Art Theatre (MAT) with Vladimir Nemirovich- Danchenko.Benedetti (1999a, 61‚Äì64). Later in his life, he created a series of studios whose aims were primarily pedagogical but which also presented public performances.Gauss (1999). This list of productions directed by Stanislavski includes amateur, professional, and studio productions. When the sources disagree about the exact date of a production's premi√®re, that given in the most recent biography of Stanislavski‚ÄîJean Benedetti's Stanislavski: His Life and Art (1988, revised and expanded 1999)‚Äîis listed here, with the alternative date detailed in the footnotes. Prior to 14 February 1918, the Julian calendar was in use in Russia, after which the Gregorian calendar was introduced.In the 19th century, the difference between the two calendars was twelve days; in the 20th, 13 days; see Gauss (1999, 6). The details of productions staged before that change are given in both Old Style and New Style dates.

Service The 126th Illinois Infantry was raised in response to President Abraham Lincoln's call for 300,000 volunteers in the late summer of 1862. The recruits were all from Moultrie, Shelby, Montgomery, Mercer, and Rock Island Counties. It was organized in Alton, Illinois beginning on September 2, 1862 and mustered in for three years service on September 4 under the command of Colonel Jonathan Richmond.http://civilwar.illinoisgenweb.org/history/126.html The regiment took the field on November 20, 1862, manning the fortifications along the Mississippi River at Columbus for a week before joining Ulysses S. Grant's army at LaGrange, and being attached to the XIII Corps. They spent the winter guarding supply lines and railroads around Jackson and Humboldt. Staying behind while the main force advanced down the Mississippi River and against Jackson, the regiment eventually joined in the Siege of Vicksburg on May 28, 1863. They were present for the Confederate surrender on July 4 and were then assigned to duty in Helena. From August 1 to early September 1863 they joined General Frederick Steele and his expedition against Little Rock. There they saw action at the Battle of Bayou Fourche where the Confederate forces under General Sterling Price were defeated and Union forces exercised control over most of Arkansas. After the Little Rock expedition, the 126th was stationed at DeValls until August 1864. During this time they saw little combat and simply endured the monotony of daily life in the army. The lone action was some light skirmishing that occurred on June 25‚Äì26, 1864 at the tiny settlement of Clinton. The regiment spent the rest of the war in the vicinity of Pine Bluff in central Arkansas. After spending almost their entire service serving in a rear echelon role the 126th Illinois was mustered out of service on July 12, 1865 at Pine Bluff. Detailed service Frederick H.

He is credited with musical contributions to many television series including Entertainment Tonight, Law & Order, Step by Step, and Rescue Me. St John's music has been used in numerous films such as the 2010 Mark Wahlberg and Christian Bale film The Fighter, which features the Keith St John song \\"Sweet Dreams.\\" Biography St. John's parents, both school teachers, recorded his first formal vocal performances at age two on cassette tapes. They decided to move to Long Island before he was enrolled in first grade. An only child, St. John grew up in an environment of classical music, folk music, jazz, and Broadway. He became a classically-trained tympanist and percussionist, and embarked on his first overseas tour at age 17. He eventually segued from performing in orchestras to playing clubs in heavy metal cover bands as a singing rock drummer. With a high-ranged, bluesy vocal sound, St. John decided to forgo the drums and become a rock frontman. =Early Years= Early in his career, St. John recorded his first demo tape which ultimately led to him being signed to Atlantic Records. Atlantic head of A&R; Jason Flom's new found band, Big Trouble, featured St. John as lead vocalist, drummer Bobby Rondinelli, guitarist Jon Levin, and bassist Tommy Henriksen. Following Big Trouble, St. John was recruited by an independent management company that wanted to build a 'supergroup' in Los Angeles based on St. John's own music and creative vision. In the 1990s, Keith emerged on the Hollywood rock scene with his newly formed band St. John. While still tweaking the St. John sound and vision, Keith received an offer from rock bassist Rudy Sarzo to join Sarzo's band Sun King, which was already signed to Giant Records by Irving Azoff. The band featured Sarzo on bass and John 5 on guitar. Throughout the late 1990s and 2000s, St. John was approached by many of Los Angeles' rock artists, managers, and record labels to sing and collaborate on up-and-coming projects. Many of these included former members of well-established L.A. bands such as: C.C. DeVille, James Kottak, Jeff Young, Chuck Wright, and Gregg D‚ÄôAngelo. St John also co- wrote and recorded the album Immoral Fabric with the band Medicine Wheel which featured guitarist Marc Ferrari and drummer Ray Luzier. =Montrose (1998-2012)= Montrose was a hard rock band formed by legendary guitarist Ronnie Montrose in 1973. By 1998, Ronnie Montrose was recording his first solo guitar album. Following almost two decades of solo projects, making records with his band Gamma, and producing other bands, he was introduced to Keith St. John by their mutual friend and session keyboardist Ed Roth. St. John and Montrose immediately hit it off both personally and musically, and Montrose was inspired to reform his band. St. John helped Montrose recruit new members from the L.A. scene, and the first new lineup included drummer Pat Torpey and bassist Chuck Wright. Other members who toured and/or recorded with the band while St. John was a member included: drummers Eric Singer, \\"Wild\\" Mick Brown, and Jimmy Degrasso, and bass players Ricky Phillips, Mick Mahan, David Ellefson, and Sean McNabb. After they met in 1998, St. John and Montrose began writing together and recording home demos of new songs, some of which would make it into live Montrose shows when the band was on tour. Pat Torpey and Chuck Wright also participated in recording some studio demos of Ronnie and Keith's music. With some revisions to those early songs, and with some added new fresh material, in 2006 Montrose and St. John went into the studio to record a new record with Eric Singer on drums and Ricky Phillips on bass. The untitled recording has not been released. St. John enjoyed the longest tenure of any musician who worked with Montrose, about thirteen years. Managed primarily by Scott Booray, the band toured mainly in the U.S. playing large outdoor festivals, arena shows, theaters, and clubs. Some touring highlites include performing at the Woodstock 40th Anniversary at Golden Gate Park in San Francisco where the opened their set with The Who's \\"My Generation,\\" and being billed over the years with iconic arena bands such as Journey, Def Leppard, The Scorpions, Cheap Trick, Sammy Hagar, Lynyrd Skynyrd, Whitesnake, Dokken and many other rock legends. Ronnie Montrose reportedly took his own life on March 3, 2012, after which St. John performed at a grand memorial concert in his honor at the Regency Ballroom in San Francisco. Other performers included: Sammy Hagar, Neal Schon, Steve Smith, Joe Satriani, Denny Carmassi, Eric Singer, and Tommy Thayer. Keith St. John and Doug Aldrich also performed a tribute to Montrose at the Iridium Theater in New York City on April 30, 2012, which was streamed over the World Wide Web and included the Les Paul Trio with Anton Fig. In 2015, St. John toured extensively in the U.S. with Tracii Guns and Rudy Sarzo playing their renditions of anthems from their prior bands. Every night their set included renditions of the Montrose hits \\"Rock Candy\\" and \\"Bad Motor Scooter\\" which were critically acclaimed in reviews of the show by rock journalists. =Burning Rain (1998-present)= In 1998, Keith met guitarist Doug Aldrich and the two demo'd their first few songs for the Japan-based record label Pony Canyon for what was to evolve into the band Burning Rain. St. John and Aldrich were introduced by bassist Ian Mayo, who was a member of St. John's Hollywood-based band, Crushed Flowers, and also a member of Aldrich's band Bad Moon Rising. Ian Mayo subsequently became the bassist for this new band, whose lineup was rounded out and completed by L.A.-based session drummer Alexx Makarovich. Following their debut album entitled Burning Rain, St. John and Aldrich recorded two more studio albums under the name Burning Rain. The song \\"Cherie Don't Break My Heart\\" officially charted at #1 on a German rock radio station and in the top 10 on many other European radio stations during the year in which it was released. The band has toured Japan, Europe, and the U.S. and current members include bassist Sean McNabb, and drummer Matt Starr.

Her disappearance sparked a search involving 2,000 people. In the first year following her disappearance, investigators questioned more than 3,500 people. , no trace of her has been found.  Disappearance  On October 24, 1953, Viggo Rasmussen, a professor at La Crosse State College (now University of Wisconsin‚ÄìLa Crosse), hired Evelyn Hartley, the daughter of a fellow professor, to take care of his 20-month old daughter. That evening, Evelyn's father Richard called the Rasmussen house several times after she failed to check in as planned at 8:30 PM; he received no answer. Concerned, he drove to the Rasmussen house. When Richard arrived, the doors were locked, the lights and radio were on, and items were scattered all over the house. The living room furniture had been moved around to different places, as were Evelyn's school books. Richard found her shoes in different rooms, one shoe upstairs, and one downstairs. He also found his daughter's broken glasses upstairs. Richard did not find Evelyn in the house. Richard also found every room in the house locked, except one in the basement that was located at the back of the house. An opened window there was missing a screen, and the screen was found leaning against an outside wall. He also found a short stepladder belonging to the homeowner positioned at the opened window. Pry marks were found on some windows, and footprints had been found in areas of the house. Blood was found both inside the house and in the yard, with bloody hand prints about 100 feet away in a garage and in a nearby house. The child Evelyn had been caring for was found asleep and unharmed.  Investigation  Police believe someone took Evelyn through the yard, but dropped her on the ground before carrying her further. The police used dogs to pick up her scent trail, which ended at Coulee Drive two blocks away. Police thought Evelyn was most likely put into a vehicle there and driven away. They were told by one neighbor they had seen a car repeatedly driving around the neighborhood, and another person who lived nearby claimed they had heard screams an hour earlier. The witness thought it was just children playing. Two days after the incident, local resident Ed Hofer told police that while driving his vehicle, he was almost hit by a Buick as it was speeding in a westerly direction. Inside the Buick, Hofer reported seeing one man was driving the vehicle while a second man was in the backseat with a girl. Several days later, various items of clothing, many of which were stained with blood, were found at different locations.Schechter, p. 49. Blood found on the jacket matched Evelyn's blood type. Over 1,000 members of the local community, including law enforcement officers, the National Guard, Boy Scouts, and La Crosse State College students and faculty, participated in a search in October 1953. The Civil Air Patrol and U.S. Air Force were also used in the search. A vehicle inspection program was also undertaken with the intent of searching every vehicle in the La Crosse County. Gas station attendants were asked to check cars for blood stains. Recent graves were reopened to determine if Evelyn's remains were placed with a recent burial. In May 1954, mass lie detector tests were conducted on La Crosse-area high school boys in an attempt to find more information about Evelyn's disappearance. Though local authorities had planned to test 1,750 students and faculty, the testing was controversial and was halted after around 300 were tested. After his arrest, murderer Ed Gein was considered a suspect in Evelyn's disappearance, as he was visiting a relative a few blocks away from the Rasmussen house at the time. However, Gein denied involvement in the disappearance and passed two lie detector tests; police found no trace of Evelyn's remains during a search of Gein's Fairfield property.Schechter, p. 177. In November 1957, authorities announced that Gein had been cleared of any connection with the disappearances of both Evelyn and Georgia Weckler, an 8 year old who disappeared in 1947. Despite this, some still consider Gein a suspect.  Aftermath  Evelyn's kidnapping led to one of the biggest searches in the history of Wisconsin. Public efforts to find her have included the Charley Project and the Soddy-Daisy-Roots Project. A reward fund established in the immediate aftermath of the event reached $6,600 (equivalent to $ in ). Her parents moved to Portland, Oregon in the 1970s, and are now both deceased.  Later developments  In 2004, a man named Mel Williams came forward with a conversation he recorded years earlier at a bar. Although his goal was to record a band which was performing, the conversation between two men was unintentionally recorded as well. On the tape, one of the men, Clyde \\"Tywee\\" Peterson, implicated himself, Jack Gaulphair, and an unnamed third party in the disappearance, claiming that Evelyn was murdered and buried in La Farge, Wisconsin after her kidnapping. Gaulphair and the unnamed party are now deceased. Although authorities promised to investigate the lead, no further developments were ever made. In 2016, her case was profiled on an episode of The Vanished.

The island has about 500 residents (in 2015), mostly living on the west side in Kirkehavn, where Hidra Church is located. The village of Rasv√•g is another main village on the south side of the island. In 2007, the government of Norway studied the possibility of building an undersea tunnel to connect the island to the mainland without a ferry, but it was deemed to be too costly for the small benefit. The island was the center of the old municipality of Hidra which existed from 1893 until 1965. Geography The island is almost entirely granite with some moraine deposits. The inner part of the island is much more hospitable, with oak and other deciduous trees. The island is divided nearly in two halves by the Rasv√•gfjorden, and the Eie Canal was built through the remaining isthmus so that small boats can pass all the way through. Name The Old Norse form of the name was Hitr. The name is probably derived from a word with the meaning \\"split\\" or \\"cleft\\" (referring to the fact that the island is almost split in two by the Rasv√•g fjord).

The facility holds a maximum of 1407 male and female prisoners, and was built in 1998.  History  Val Verde has had a troubled history. In early 2004 female detainee LeTisha Tapia reported to the warden that male and female prisoners were having regular sexual contact with the approval of guards. She was then sexually assaulted by inmates and an officer as punishment for being a 'snitch'. Tapia hanged herself. Her family sued and settled. The money damages were undisclosed but the settlement terms mandated a full-time county monitor. In 2006 GEO Group also settled a lawsuit brought by a former black guard whose supervisor \\"kept a hangman‚Äôs noose in his office and a Polaroid photo of himself in a Ku Klux Klan hood in his desk.\\" In July 2007 the Idaho Department of Corrections moved about 60 prisoners into Val Verde, roughly half of the Idaho prisoners withdrawn from another GEO Group facility in Texas for maltreatment.

The executive order established the first freedom of information (FOI) Program in the Philippines covering all government offices under the Executive Branch. It requires all executive departments, agencies, bureaus, and offices to disclose public records, contracts, transactions, and any information requested by a member of the public, except for matters affecting national security and other information that falls under the inventory of exceptions issued by Executive Secretary Salvador Medialdea. The landmark order was signed two days before Duterte delivered his first State of the Nation Address and just three weeks after he assumed the presidency on June 30, 2016. Provisions of Executive Order No. 02, s. 2016 The FOI Executive Order provides for full public disclosure of all government records involving public interest, and upholds the constitutional right of people to information on matters of public concern. The Order states: The Order defines \\"information\\" to include any The law expansively defines \\"official records\\" as \\"information produced or received by a public officer or employee, or by a government office in an official capacity or pursuant to a public function or duty,\\" while \\"public records\\" refer to \\"information required by laws, executive orders, rules, or regulations to be entered, kept and made publicly available by a government office.\\" It also emphasizes the obligation of all public officials to file and make available for scrutiny their Statement of Assets, Liabilities and Net worth in accordance with existing laws, jurisprudence, and implementing rules and regulations (IRR) of the Order. The Order covers the national government and all its offices, departments, bureaus, and instrumentalities, including Government-Owned and/or -Controlled Corporations (GOCCs) and State Universities and Colleges (SUCs). It also encourages all local government units (LGUs) to observe and be guided by this Order. =Inventory of FOI Exceptions = The Order instructs the Department of Justice (DOJ) and the Office of the Solicitor General (OSG) to prepare and submit an inventory of information that falls under any of the exceptions enshrined in the Constitution, existing laws or jurisprudence, within 30 days. It adds that the inventory of exceptions shall be periodically updated to \\"properly reflect any change in existing laws and jurisprudence.\\" On August 22, 2016, the DOJ and OSG submitted a list of 166 exceptions, 158 of which are \\"exceptions to FOI\\" and six (6) more listed as \\"other exceptions.\\" The draft list includes information that \\"directly relates to national security and internal or external defense of the state;\\" matters of foreign affairs which \\"could affect ongoing bilateral or multilateral negotiations;\\" law enforcement matters; and proceedings and investigations being conducted by public authorities. It also lists as exception information that might endanger a person's life or safety, such as medical records, bank deposits, and other information considered as privileged communication in legal proceedings by law or by the rules of court. Presidential Communications Operations Office (PCOO) Secretary Jose Ruperto Martin Andanar said the draft list of exceptions would still be reviewed by the Office of the Deputy Executive Secretary for Legal Affairs. When the Order took effect on November 24, 2016, the 166 exceptions submitted by the DOJ and OSG were categorized into nine (9) exceptions, as follows: : 1. Information covered by Executive privilege; : 2. Privileged information relating to national security, defense or international relations; : 3. Information concerning law enforcement and protection of public and personal safety; : 4. Information deemed confidential for the protection of the privacy of persons and certain individuals such as minors, victims of crimes, or the accused; : 5.

Prejudicial premature disclosure; : 7. Records of proceedings or information from proceedings which, pursuant to law or relevant rules and regulations, are treated as confidential or privileged; : 8. Matters considered confidential under banking and finance laws, and their amendatory laws; and : 9. Other exceptions to the right to information under laws, jurisprudence, and IRR. =People's FOI Manual= The Order directs all government offices under the Executive Branch to prepare and submit their own People's FOI Manual within 120 days upon its effectivity. It shall include: As of August 2018, the following agencies have submitted their People's FOI Manuals: * 100% or 190 out of 190 National Government Agencies (NGAs); * 85% or 100 out of 118 GOCCs; * 90% or 101 out of 112 SUCs; and * 34% or 176 out of 521 Local Water Districts (LWDs). =Process of Requesting Information= Filipino citizens may access government information either through the standard (paper-based) platform or the Electronic FOI (eFOI) Portal. The request for access to a government document by any member of the public shall be in writing and must include the name and contact information of the requesting party, a valid proof of his identification, the specific information being requested, and the reason or purpose for the request for information. Upon receiving the application, the government official must provide reasonable assistance to the requesting party, and shall respond and notify the applicant of their decision in relation to the request within 15 working days of receiving the request. If access has been denied wholly or in part, reasons must be provided to the applicant. The oOder states: \\"No request for information shall be denied unless it clearly falls under any of the exceptions listed in the inventory or updated inventory of exceptions.\\" The 15 working day response period may be extended to additional 20 working days, in cases where the information being requested requires extensive research or examination of voluminous records. The response period may also be prolonged in the event of unexpected disruption to government services. The government official is then required to notify the applicant of the extension. Failure to notify the requesting party of the action taken on the request within the response period will be viewed as a denial of the request. = Sanctions for Non-Compliance = Pursuant to the Order, failure to comply with its provisions may be a ground for administrative and disciplinary sanctions against any erring public officer based on the Revised Rules on Administrative Cases in the Civil Service. = Remedies in Case of Denial = A person whose request for access to information has been denied may file an appeal to the Central Appeals and Review Committee of the concerned agency. Written appeal must be filed by the same person making the request within 15 calendar days from the notice of denial or from the lapse of the period to respond to the request. The appeal shall be decided within 30 working days from the filing of said written appeal. Failure of such person or office to decide within the period shall be deemed a denial of the appeal. Upon exhaustion of administrative appeal remedies, the requesting party may file the appropriate judicial action in accordance with the Rules of Court.  The Freedom of Information ‚Äì Project Management Office  Through Memorandum Order No. 10, s. 2016, the Office of the Executive Secretary (OES) mandated the PCOO to act as the lead implementing agency for the FOI Program. To operationalize this, the PCOO established the Freedom of Information ‚Äì Project Management Office (FOI- PMO) through PCOO Department Order No. 18, s. 2017. The vision of the FOI-PMO is to regain public trust by revolutionizing how the government discloses information to the citizens and ensuring that government agencies respond to citizen concerns and provide the information they need, all within 15 to 35 working days. = Outside the Executive Branch = Although the Order only covers agencies under the Executive Branch, LGUs and other government agencies outside the Executive Branch are encouraged to observe and be guided by the Order Ref. As of August 2018, the following offices have submitted their FOI Manuals either in paper and/or digital format, and complied with the provisions in the said Order: # Office of the Ombudsman (OMB) News Art # Commission on Audit News Art = Localizing the FOI Program = Based on a thorough review of the top requested information from government agencies, it has been found that there is a high demand for local, granular information, News Art such as Internal Revenue Allotments, Regional Development Plans, and information on the Local Government Support Fund. Ref To address this, the PCOO has partnered with the Department of the Interior and Local Government (DILG) to establish measures to promote the issuance of local FOI Ordinances. The local FOI Ordinance serves as the local counterpart of the Order and sets the standards in providing access to information under the jurisdiction of LGUs. News Art A PCOO-DILG Joint Memorandum Circular is currently being drafted to further push and support LGUs in the local implementation of the program.

The book offers an explanation for the despotic governments in \\"Oriental\\" societies, where control of water was necessary for irrigation and flood-control. Managing these projects required large-scale bureaucracies, which dominated the economy, society, and religious life. This despotism differed from the Western experience, where power was distributed among contending groups. The book argues that this form of \\"hydraulic despotism\\" characterized ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia, Hellenistic Greece and imperial Rome, the Abbasid Caliphate, imperial China, the Moghul empire, and Incan Peru. Wittfogel further argues that 20th century Marxist- Leninist regimes, such as the Soviet Union and People's Republic of China, though they were not themselves hydraulic societies, did not break away from their historical condition and remained systems of \\"total power\\" and \\"total terror\\". The book was both welcomed as an historically grounded analysis of despotism that warned the West against the expansion of Marxist totalitarianism and criticized as a Cold War polemic. The materialist and ecological theories in Oriental Despotism influenced ecological anthropologists and global economic historians even though some of them found fault with its methodology and empirical basis or questioned Wittfogel's political motives. Background Wittfogel, who was educated in German centers of sinology and joined the German Communist Party in 1920, was dissatisfied with the debate on the Asiatic mode of production (AMP) that traced back to Montesquieu and Hegel.For essays and readings on the AMP, see During the 1920s and early 1930s he debated with orthodox Marxists who followed Joseph Stalin's dictum that all societies evolved through the same stages of historical growth, which Asia must therefore follow. When he was freed from a Nazi prison in Germany, he came to the United States with his wife in 1933 and made several trips to China for research. Wittfogel's interests in China and immersion in Marxist analysis led him to conclusions on the theory of Oriental Despotism that differed from Marxist tradition. Marx held that historical development outside Europe did not follow the pattern he saw in Europe. Europe, he wrote, developed through a process of class conflict from an ancient slave society to feudalism, then bourgeois capitalism, and from there to socialism and eventually communism. Modern Europe, in Marx's classic formulation, was created by the conflict between the emerging bourgeois and industrial capitalist classes, on the one hand, and the Ancient Regime of feudal economy on the other. Wittfogel suggested Asia was immobile because rulers controlled society but there were no slaves, as in Marx's slave society, nor serfs, as in feudal society: there were no classes, no class conflict, and thus no change. This proposition did not explain how rulers gained their absolute power and why no forces in society opposed them. Wittfogel asked whether there was an explanation found only in these societies. Marxists in both the Soviet Union and in Western countries explored these questions as important in themselves, but with special heat because both liberals and conservatives in the West wanted to decide whether Stalin's Russia was an authentic communist system in Marx's sense or whether it was itself an example of Oriental Despotism. One historian of the concept \\"Oriental Despotism\\" remarks that for Wittfogel, \\"the analysis of Asia was actually intended as a discussion of political relationships within the 'West'\\". In the late 1920 and early 1930s, orthodox theorists in Moscow spurned Wittfogel's views because they differed from Stalin's and Chinese Marxists rejected them also because they implied that China did not have the capability to develop. On a trip to Moscow, however, Wittfogel met the young Chinese scholar Ji Chaoding, an underground communist who became his intellectual disciple. Ji came to the United States for graduate work at Columbia University. Ji's doctoral dissertation, published in 1936 as The Role of Irrigation In Chinese History, argued that a dynasty's success depended on control of irrigation, which increased agricultural production, and especially water transportation, which gave the government both military and financial control. Wittfogel also had a productive intellectual relation in the 1930s with Owen Lattimore, whom he met in China. Lattimore, who shared Wittfogel's interest in ecological structures and material conditions, argued that the history of Inner Asia was dominated by the interaction between settled agricultural societies that flourished in the relatively well-watered rim and the pastoral societies that survived in arid Central Asia. Publication Beginning in the 1930s, Wittfogel pursued research projects that formed a background and preparation for Oriental Despotism and published articles presenting aspects of its argument. He finished a manuscript in 1954, but for several years publishers turned it down. Perhaps the topic did not seem attractive or perhaps the political atmosphere seemed hostile to a book with a Marxist argument even if that argument was strongly critical of the Soviet Union and the communist government in China. Wittfogel may have had to supply a publication subsidy to Yale University Press. The structure and argument of the book The book has ten chapters: * Chapter 1. \\"The Natural Setting Of Hydraulic Society,\\" explains the geographical settings of hydraulic empires, including ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia, Hellenistic Greece and imperial Rome, imperial China, the Abbasid Caliphate, the Moghul empire, Incan Peru, and 20th century Marxist-Leninist regimes. He prefers the term \\"hydraulic\\" rather than \\"Oriental,\\" but uses the terms interchangeably. * Chapter 2. \\"Hydraulic Economy,- A Managerial And Genuinely Political Economy\\" * Chapter 3. \\"A State Stronger Than Society\\" * Chapters 4 \\"Despotic Power, - Total And Not Benevolent\\": The absence of effective constitutional and societal checks and \\"beggars' democracy. * Chapter 5. \\"Total Terror, Total Submission, Total Loneliness\\" argue that \\"hydraulic government\\" is despotic by its very nature. This was a form of \\"total power\\" because there were no social, legal, or cultural constraints. Wittfogel also denies that in the case of imperial China there were \\"rights of rebellion\\", such as other Chinese and foreign scholars have seen, but he does hold that a \\"law of diminishing administrative returns\\" kept rulers from controlling all aspects of their subjects' lives, so that \\"genuine elements of freedom remained.\\" This freedom, however, amounted only to a \\"beggar's democracy.\\" The \\"rationality coefficient of hydraulic society\\" means the society's ability to get things done, operating at three levels at which the government must be effective: managing the agrarian economy, (\\"managerial\\"); using corvee and taxes, (\\"consumptive\\"); and maintaining peace and order, (\\"judicial) * Chapter 6. \\"The Core, The Margin, And The Submargin Of Hydraulic Societies,\\" * Chapter 7. Patterns Of Proprietary Complexity In Hydraulic Society * Chapter 8. Classes In Hydraulic Society * Chapter 9. The Rise And Fall Of The Theory Of The Asiatic Mode Of Production * Chapter 10. Oriental Society In Transition Reception The initial reaction to Oriental Despotism in the American press was wide and warm. Reviewers noted that Wittfogel had been working on these questions in some form since the 1930s but that the book was important for understanding the post-war world. The reviewer in The Geographical Review advised that \\"every geographer concerned with Asia, and every political geographer whatever the regional concern, should read it\\". He hoped that \\"historians, political scientists, deans, and college presidents will see it as evidence that ... 'most of the world' is just as important as traditional focus on North America and Western Europe.\\" He added that \\"the book makes impressively clear that there is a great mass of despotic practice in the most populous parts of the world that cannot be transformed magically by democratic catalysis.\\" Yet \\"environmental determinism\\" is \\"explicitly denied,\\" as Wittfogel speaks of \\"the opportunity, not the necessity\\" for agromanagerial despotism. Area specialist scholars, however, questioned the concept for their particular regions. Jerome A. Offner, for instance, disagreed with the scholars who used the concept \\"Oriental Despotism\\" for understanding of Aztec political organization and society. The concept is \\"demonstrably false,\\" wrote Offner, at least for the state of Texcoco: irrigation had no significant role, there was extensive private property in land, and the government did not dominate the economy, since the market was extensive. Ervand Abrahamian assessed the applicability of the theory to Qajar Iran. The British anthropologist Edmund Leach objected that most of the hydraulic civilisations of the past were in semi-arid regions where irrigation \\"did not require a despotic monarch to build vast aqueducts and reservoirs; it simply called for elementary and quite localised drainage construction and perhaps the diversion of river flood water into the flat lands on either side of the main stream.\\" Leach further objected that Wittfogel did not deal with India, the state which Marx saw as the ideal type of \\"Asiatic society\\", and ignored the other states of South and Southeast Asia, which were all \\"hydraulic societies.\\" The sociologist Shmuel Noah Eisenstadt questioned Oriental Despotism in regard to Islamic societies. He saw the earlier Oriental Despotism theorists and Wittfogel as \\"precursors, or manifestations of what would later be called the 'Orientalist' approach,\\" which Edward Said accused of imposing this type of analysis on Islamic societies. The reception among scholars of China was especially skeptical. The Princeton University sinologist Frederick Mote wrote that Wittfogel \\"presents effective arguments, and the neatness of his total view of Chinese despotism is compelling, yet when it is applied to any one period of history there appear certain difficulties in accepting his arguments.\\" Wittfogel \\"does not write of Chinese government and society as a historian; the reader does not sense any awareness of the steadily cumulative development through the centuries which gave each age its own character.\\" The Song dynasty emperors, for instance, had great power but did not use it despotically; Zhu Yuanzhang, the founder of the Ming dynasty, took advantage of accidents and timing to become absolute ruler. Mote was especially concerned to explain the limits of power and the limits of terror, which he believed Wittfogel did not appreciate. Thus \\"total power,\\" Mote wrote, \\"while not a meaningless phrase, must be understood in the context of a complex historical situation.\\" It existed in Ming China, but even then it did not mean that totalitarian power was \\"omnipresent and omnicompetent.\\" If this power concentrated on any single objective, it probably could accomplish that objective, but by the nature of the cultural environment, it could not accomplish many of them. Gregory Blue of the University of Toronto commented that \\"despite its analytical sweep and evident learning, Wittfogel's model made it difficult to understand why government involvement in Chinese social life seemed to have been distinctly limited during the imperial era (221 B.C.E. - 1911 CE.) or how Chinese society could have ever flourished at all\\". Wittfogel's reading of China as a hydraulic despotism, Blue speculated, also aimed to undermine John Fairbank's \\"Grand Alliance distinction between 'fascist-conservative and communist-progressive forms of totalitarianism'...\\" Another historian of the Ming dynasty, Timothy Brook, wrote that historians were burdened with the task of responding to Wittfogel's charge that the dynasty was \\"despotic,\\" one that he did not think was justified.Timothy Brook, Chinese State in Ming Society Perry Anderson objected that the concept of the Asiatic Mode of Production was too broad to be meaningful: ::A ubiquitous ‚ÄòAsiatism‚Äô [sic] represents no improvement on a universal ‚Äòfeudalism‚Äô: in fact, it is even less rigorous as a term. What serious historical unity exists between Ming China and Megalithic Ireland, Pharaonic Egypt and Hawaii? It is perfectly clear that such social formations are unimaginably distant from one another. Anderson continued that ‚Äúthis vulgar charivari, devoid of any historical sense, jumbles together pell-mell Imperial Rome, Tsarist Russia, Hopi Arizona, Sung China, Chaggan East Africa, Mamluk Egypt, Inca Peru, Ottoman Turkey, and Sumerian Mesopotamia ‚Äì not to speak of Byzantium or Babylonia, Persia, or Hawaii.‚Äù Wittfogel's biographer Gary Ulmen replied to these criticisms that to focus on \\"hydraulic despotism\\" was to misunderstand Wittfogel's general thesis. In fact, Ulmen continued, Wittfogel had considered a number of alternative ways to frame his proposition and there were many more demonstrations of the theory than \\"hydraulic\\" despotism. Wittfogel wrote in 1960 that the People's Republic of China was not a \\"hydraulic society,\\" but that it represented a \\"stronger form of Oriental Despotism.\\" Influence Oriental Despotism was influential for its methodology and its findings. Joseph Needham appreciated Wittfogel's early work for its combination of Weberian understanding of bureaucracy and Marxist political analysis. In developing his study, Science and Civilisation in China, Needham remarked that Wittfogel's Marxism in the period before he came to the United States was \\"chiefly an emphasis on social and economic factors in Chinese history which had been overlooked by others.‚Äù After World War II, John K. Fairbank invited Wittfogel to Harvard University to deliver a series of talks to his graduate seminar in Area Studies. Wittfogel was one of the influences on Fairbank's The United States and China (1948), a survey that synthesized the standard work of historians and social scientists. Wittfogel left Columbia University in 1949 to join the University of Washington study group on Modern China. One member, the historian Hsiao Kung-ch'uan, for instance, used Wittfogel's concept of \\"beggar's democracy\\" in his massive study, Rural China . Frederic Wakeman saw Wittfogel as the defining influence in the group, but the historian Alice Miller disagreed.Miller The water-control thesis encouraged the development of the field of ecological anthropology and ecological political science, that is, theoretical approaches that combined geographical and environmental factors. Wittfogel participated in a 1953 session at the American Anthropological Association and in a following conference organized by Julian Steward at University of Illinois in 1955. The appearance of Oriental Despotism in print further influenced anthropologists such as Robert McCormick Adams, Stanley Diamond, Morton Fried, Marvin Harris, Angel Palerm, and Eric Wolf. Wittfogel's work encouraged the development of cultural materialism, for instance in the work of Julian Steward. pp. 671- 674 These scholars tested and challenged Wittfogel's conclusions. Robert McCormick Adams, for instance, found that the archeological evidence in Mesopotamia indicated that irrigation might help consolidate political control but did not by itself cause despotic rule.\\"Hydraulic Civilization\\" Encyclopedia Britannica (Online) The political geographer James Morris Blaut credited Wittfogel with updating Marx and Weber but sharply criticized what he regarded as the misuse of Wittfogel in what he called ‚Äúthe myth of the European miracle,‚Äù that is, \\"the rather archaic doctrine\\" that environmental factors made Europe modern and the Orient stagnant and despotic. Blaut sees the influence of Wittfogel in the writings of \\"miracle theorists,\\" such as Eric L. Jones, and his book, The European Miracle: Environments, Economies and Geopolitics in the History of Europe and Asia , which cites Oriental Despotism extensively but not uncritically. e.g. pp. xxxi, 9-10, 203, 206, 211 These thinkers, Blaut charges, share ‚Äúthe most fundamental error,‚Äù that is, ‚Äúto believe, or assume, that one type of environment produces a particular type of society and the latter then persists down through history. Culture changes....\\" In the 1930s, Wittfogel's work was translated and used by scholars in Japan, but after the war not so much attention was paid. Political implications David Price, a scholar of Cold War social science, declared that Wittfogel's writings \\"become so mired in his personal anti-communist crusade that it can be difficult to disentangle his anti-totalitarian vehemence from his theoretical contributions.\\" Price argued that Wittfogel took advantage of the fact that he was one of the few Asia scholars to cooperate with Cold War investigations and that this cooperation protected his Marxist analysis from criticism; Wittfogel's ecological materialism escaped criticism even in the Cold War heightened fear of Communism because he was accepted as anti-communist. The scholar of political ecology, Paul Robbins, notes that Wittfogel, having been accused of being a communist sympathizer, protested loudly and accused Owen Lattimore and other colleagues of being communists; he wrote Oriental Despotism in the midst of this political struggle. Gregory Blue called final words of the book ‚Äî \\"not with the spear only, but with the battleax\\" ‚Äîthe \\"Spartan view on how Greeks should fight Persian imperialism\\" that \\"represented a highbrow version of 'better red than dead.'\\" David Landes, a Harvard historian of comparative East/West economic and social development, struck back: the \\"hydraulic thesis has been roundly criticized by a generation of Western sinologists zealous in their political correctness (Maoism and its later avatars are good) and quick to defend China‚Äôs commitment to democracy. Wittfogel is the preferred target.\\" Landes explained these criticisms by saying that \\"almost all these critics of the water connection are courting the favor of an umbrageous regime, dispenser of invitations and access.‚Äù, p. 27.

According to oral tradition, in the barra de Santiago lived a man named Pachacutec, who arranged a marriage between his daughter, Chasca, and a prince of the zutuhil tribe. Chasca, however, was already in love with a young fisher named Acayatl. She would sneak away from her father to the beach where Acayatl would serenade her. One horrible day, someone shot an arrow at Acayatl while he returned from fishing. The assassin was sent by Pachacutec. Chasca saw the murder and screamed with horror, and decided to join her lover in death. She tied a rock around her waist and threw herself into the water. The following night of a full moon, the spirit of Chasca appeared for the first time in a white canoe next to Acayatl, from this time, she has continued to appear in this way. Whenever the fishermen notice a full moon, they do not go out to fish because they wish to respect and not disturb the virgin of the water and her lover, who in return for that respect, bless the fishermen with bountiful fish.

Biography He was born in Lucca to a painter named Pietro de Servi. He left during the second year of gymnasium, despite his father's opposition, to enroll in the Regio Istituto di Belle Arti di Lucca, under the director Luigi Norcini. He first exhibited four works at the 29th Esposizione della Societ√† Promotrice di Belle Artists in Genoa. In 1883, along with his eldest sister, a seamstress, he travelled to Argentina while twelve siblings remain in Lucca. He sold a number of works in Buenos Aires, and soon obtained commissions for portraits, signing \\"Luis De Servi\\". He enticed most of his siblings to move to Argentina. In 1884, he painted frescoes for the \\"Casa Rosada\\" in Buenos Aires. He also decorated the entrance rotonda, depicting the primitive life of the Argentines, of the Museo de La Plata. In 1886, he painted a Triumph of the Province of Buenos Aires for the Vestibule of the Senate Chamber in Buenos Aires. In 1887, the province commissioned portraits of 70 governors from 1810 to 1877 to be exhibited in Casa Rosada. He lost nearly all his investments in a bank failure. He decided to briefly return to Lucca, but returned to Argentina for another year. In 1890-1891, he returned to Lucca, and opened a studio. He linked up with Michele Marcucci and Domenico Martinelli, to fresco 12 lunettes in the arches of the choir in the city cemetery. Due to scarce commissions in Lucca, he worked for 20 months in London mainly as a portrait artist. In 1892, he returned to Lucca to paint frescoes in Villa Lavarello, Varazze and for the church of Santa Caterina in Lucca. In 1893, he travelled to Paris to paint portraits for the Argentine Augusto Belin Sarmiento, but also gained local commissions. He returned to Italy to paint the apse of the church of Santa Maria degli Angeli ad Alassio. In 1898, he painted the decorations for the piano room of the house of Giacomo Puccini in Torre del Lago. He worked alongside Plinio Nomellini, Ferruccio Pagni, and Edoardo De Albertis. In 1905, he frescoed the railroad station of Genova Brignole. In 1906, he was named Cavaliere della Corona d'Italia. In 1909, he joins the \\"Giovane Italia\\", artistic group. He travels to Uruguay, Argentina and Paris. In 1910, De Servi returned to Buenos Aires to fresco the ceiling of the Presidential room in the Palazzo del Governo, and also painted panels depicting L'Italia al Mar del Piata for the Bank of Italy and Rio de La Piata. In 1914, De Servi returned to Italy, where he continues to paint portraits. In 1915, he painted the main altarpiece of the church of San Cristoforo in Lucca, depicting the name saint. In 1917 and 1918 he had personal expositions in Viareggio and Lucca respectively. In 1920-1922, he returned to Argentina. In 1923, he painted a portrait of Mussolini for Sena and Carlo Spiccani, that was gifted to Mussolini himself. In 1924, De Servi wrote an open letter to the \\"Giornale d'Italia\\", criticizing the paper's confrontation of the government. As a fascist, he declared he would now boycott the paper he once loyally read. In 1926, he was named secretary of the newly established Fascist Syndicate of Lucchese Artists. In 1926, he exhibited in the foyer of the Teatro Nazionale of Rome. In 1931, he had personal exhibitions at Lucca and Viarregio. In 1933, he painted two large canvases for the new Cassa di Risparmio di Lucca. In 1938, he exhibited at a \\"Mostra di pittori liguri dell'Ottocento\\", at the Palazzo Rosso, Genoa. In 1939, he had a personal exhibition at the Galleria Ger√¨ of Milan.Palazzo Ducale of Lucca , exhibition biography.

It also appeared on the 1981 French compilation of hits album \\"Hot Summer Nights\\" on the Arabella record label as well as being released as a single in France. The recording was co-produced by Jon Kelly and de Paul. While the song was not immediately as commercial as many of her other hits, it had a laid back feel ahead of its time that grows on repeated listening. The British DJ and music journalist James Hamilton wrote in the music paper Record Mirror, \\"MCA‚Äôs mystery Fleetwood Mac-sounding ‚ÄòStrange Changes‚Äô white label teaser turns out to be by Lynsey De Paul ‚Äì oh, goodie!\\",Record Mirror, 2 May, 1981 with other sources also noting a similarity to Stevie Nicks.

Writing on her website, de Paul revealed she wrote this song when she was living in the United States and wanted to come back home to the UK. \\"It meant leaving behind a life that had taken five years to build and a long term relationship with James Coburn. I literally felt that I was going through a strange change\\" she said. De Paul performed the song on a number of TV programmes including the German TV series WWF Club, and the second episode of the UK TV music programme Razzamatazz on 9 June 1981. It was included as a track on her Hit Singles album.

Since its creation, it has been responsible for publishing leaks of emails belonging to multiple prominent figures in the United States government and military. Cybersecurity research firms say the site is a front for the Russian cyber-espionage group Fancy Bear. On July 13, 2018, an indictment was made against 12 Russian GRU military officers; it alleged that DCLeaks is part of a Russian military operation to interfere in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. Identity In the summer of 2016 following the murder of Seth Rich, numerous media sources, which were critical of the Democratic National Committee (DNC) and the Hillary Clinton Campaign, were implicating Rich as a source for the DNC leaks found on DCLeaks, Guccifer 2.0, and Wikileaks. Roger Stone used his Twitter account to spread many statements implicating Rich as the source while Julian Assange and others refused to stop the falsehoods from circulating. Later, WikiLeaks would neither name Rich as a source nor state that Rich was not the source. Cybersecurity research firm ThreatConnect concluded in their analysis that the DCLeaks project shows the hallmarks of Russian intelligence, matching the attack pattern of the GRU hacker group Fancy Bear. ThreatConnect concluded that the site is likely linked to Russian persona Guccifer 2.0 and the GRU-linked hacker group Fancy Bear. The site is thought by private cybersecurity analysts and the US intelligence community to be a part of Russian interference in the 2016 US elections. According to the DCLeaks site's \\"About\\" page, their aim is \\"to find out and tell you the truth about U.S. decision-making process as well as about the key elements of American political life.\\" Of themselves, they say that they were launched by \\"the American hacktivists who respect and appreciate freedom of speech, human rights and government of the people.\\" On July 13, 2018 a federal grand jury for the District of Columbia indicted 12 members of Unit 26165 of the Russian Main Intelligence Directorate (GRU) for creating the false identity DCLeaks website, hacking the Democratic National Committee and releasing stolen data on the website.  History  The domain name dcleaks.com was registered on April 19, 2016, on the THCservers.com founded by Catalin Florica on a former farm near Craiova, Romania. Shinjiru Technology in Kuala Lumpur hosted the DCLeaks files during the electoral campaign. The dcleaks.com website was launched in June 2016. = Leaks = On August 12, 2016, the press reported that one DNC computer had been breached for nearly a year, from the summer of 2015 and another in April 2016. The attacker was knocked out of its network during the weekend of June 11 and 12, 2016. In late June 2016, Guccifer 2.0 informed reporters to visit the DCLeaks website for emails stolen from Democrats. With the WikiLeaks disclosure of additional stolen emails beginning on July 22, 2016, more than 150,000 stolen emails from either personal Gmail addresses or via the DNC that were related to the Hillary Clinton 2016 Presidential campaign were published on the DCLeaks and WikiLeaks websites. On July 1, 2016, DCLeaks released the emails of four-star General Philip Breedlove, the former NATO supreme commander in Europe. The emails allegedly show that Breedlove sought to overcome President Barack Obama's reluctance to escalate military tensions with Russia over the war in Ukraine in 2014. On August 12, 2016, DCLeaks released roughly 300 emails from Republican targets, including the 2016 campaign staff of Arizona Senator John McCain, South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham, and 2012 presidential candidate and former Minnesota Representative Michele Bachmann. The release included 18 emails from the Illinois Republican Party. On August 12, 2016, DCLeaks released information about more than 200 Democratic lawmakers, including their personal cellphone numbers. The numerous crank calls that Hillary Clinton received from this disclosure along with the loss of her campaign's email security caused a very severe disruption of her campaign which subsequently changed their contact information on October 7, 2016, by calling each of her contacts one at a time. On August 15, 2016, DCLeaks released 2,576 files predominately related to George Soros' Open Society Foundation. The leak included the Foundation's internal work plans, strategies, priorities and other worldwide activities by Soros. In August 2017, Dana Rohrabacher meets with Julian Assange in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London to offer Assange a pardon from President Trump if Assange could offer material supporting Seth Rich as the source of email leaks from the Democratic National Committee during 2016 and not Russians. In February 2020, Rohrabacher told Yahoo News his goal during this meeting with Assange was to find evidence for a widely debunked conspiracy theory that WikiLeaks' real source was not Russian intelligence agents for the DNC emails but former DNC staffer Seth Rich. Stephanie Grisham, White House spokesperson for President Trump, stated that Trump barely knows Rohrabacher except that he's an ex-congressman and has not spoken with Rohrabacher on almost any subject. On February 19, 2020, Edward Fitzgerald, Julian Assange's barrister, asserted at Westminster Magistrates‚Äô Court in London that Rohrabacher had been sent on behalf of President Trump in August 2017 to offer Assange a pardon from Trump if Assange could release material to show that Russian hackers were not involved in the 2016 United States election interference. However, on July 14, 2016, which is four days after the death of Seth Rich, WikiLeaks had received from Russian hackers the stolen documents file of emails. During November 2017, the Associated Press revealed that the FBI had failed to notify almost all of the persons in the cross hairs of the Kremlin-backed Fancy Bear's attack of 312 prominent government and defense officials who had their emails posted on DCLeaks. The FBI was in violation of its own policy of robustly informing victims of hacking. = Indictments = On July 13, 2018, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein announced that twelve Russian hackers, who were operating in multiple units including Units 26165 and 74455 with the Main Intelligence Directorate of the General Staff (GRU), were named on an 11-count indictment for obtaining access and distributing information from data about 500,000 voters from a state election board website as well as the email accounts of John Podesta, Hillary Clinton, and volunteers and employees of the Unites States Presidential Campaign of Hillary Clinton (Clinton Campaign), the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) and the Democratic National Committee (DNC). Following Donald Trump's request on July 27, 2016, during a rally in Florida that Vladimir Putin should have Russia hack into Trump's opponents networks, servers, and emails to make Hillary Clinton's 30,000 missing emails made public, Russian hackers tried for the first time to hack into Hillary Clinton's personal offices. The GRU mined Bitcoins to later purchase the DCLeaks domain and operate both the DCLeaks server and Guccifer 2.0 server to distribute information obtained from these hackers in order to discredit and disrupt the Clinton Campaign, the DCCC, and the DNC so that the Bernie Sanders Presidential Campaign, Republican candidates and the Donald Trump Presidential Campaign would benefit during the 2016 election cycle. They obtained the data about 500,000 voters by breaking into voter verification software and targeting local and state election officials. Although Roger Stone did not know the names of the Russian's sources, he had publicly stated that these Russians were in contact with the Trump Campaign and that he had communicated with them. Russians had passed embarrassing information from these hacks to Wikileaks, too. This damaging information about Hillary Clinton, John Podesta, the Clinton Campaign, the DCCC, and the DNC led to the resignation of the DNC Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman-Schultz in July, 2016. Using peer-to-peer exchanges and pre-paid cards, the Russians mined and used Bitcoins with public Blockchain recorded transactions using hundreds of emails with fictitious names to prevent monitoring by United States authorities on traditional financial transaction networks. The Internet Research Agency in Saint Petersburg spearheaded the operation.

The ranch actually consists of two separate parcels of land and also of the OH Pekisko, OH Longview, OH Dorothy, and OH Bassano ranches. Both parcels of land include both private and public land with the public land leased to OH Ranch Ltd. (the corporation that manages the ranch) for grazing. The approximate coordinates of the southern section of the ranch are 50.565065, -114.354775.  History  The ranch's origins date back to 1881 when a man named Orville Hawkins Smith, a mule skinner and Lafayette French, a buffalo hunter began to raise cattle illegally around the Highwood River. They registered the OH brand in 1883, to this day one of the oldest brands in Western Canada. The name OH is in fact a reference to Smith's first two initials. Then in 1883 Frederick Ings, from Charlottetown bought Smith and French's cattle, all 300 and began his own ranch. Later that year his brother, James Walter, came to the OH and together they named the ranch \\"Rio Alto\\" or High River in Spanish. The North-West Mounted Police also create a station on the ranch that was in operation until 1900. The original cabin burned in 1961 but a re-creation was built. The brothers later parted ways as Walter Ings bought Fred's interest. Fred then sold the ranch, cattle, and brand to Patrick Burns, a famous cowboy. However, Burns sold the property to a shipping company Mayer & Lage, although he eventually bought it back later. When Burns died his estate liquidated his assets, including the ranch in 1950. Then due to its size the original plan was to sell the ranch in pieces, but C. W. (Kink) Roenish and Bill Ardern intervened and jointly bought the ranch. They hence changed the name of the ranch to the OH Ranch Ltd. The same year Bert Sheppard was hired to manage the ranch and in 1957 along with Bill Ardern's son-in-law (A.D. (Doug) Kingsford) became full partners. The ranch was yet again put up for sale in 1986. The Department of National Defence was planning to buy and use the ranch for an artillery range and training ground. The ranch was saved once again but this time by Daryl \\"Doc\\" Seaman. In 2008 certain parts of the ranch, which were originally grazing leases, were set aside as provincial Heritage Rangelands, known as the OH Ranch Heritage Rangelands. In 2009 the private land was put under regulations for conservation easement. Following Seaman's death in 2009 the ranch was put on the market and bought by Bill Siebens in 2011. On June 19, 2012, the southern portion of the ranch was donated to the Calgary Stampede Foundation. The gift was valued at more than $11 million and is the largest gift ever received by the foundation. Since then the ranch has been used for field trip opportunities for grade 4 and 5 students.

It covers 12 million square meters, including a bonded private port and has a capacity to operate 12 million tons / year, and a railway complex with capacity to serve 4 million tons / year. The company has about 5,500 employees, of whom 5,300 work in its Cubat√£o Mill. The company produces non-coated flat steel (plates, heavy plates, hot-rolled and cold) that serve strategic sectors of the Brazilian economy, such as the automotive, railway, marine, construction, agricultural, packaging, mechanical, electronics, home appliances, machinery, equipment and distribution sectors.  History  The Cosipa was founded in 1953, a dream of S√£o Paulo entrepreneurs, among them Martinho Prado Uchoa, Pl√≠nio de Queiroz, Alcides da Costa Vidigal e Herbert Levi. After more than ten years of preparations and design, the plant was inaugurated on December 18, 1963 by President Jo√£o Goulart. In 1966, it became an integrated coke steel mill. After two major expansion plans in the 1970s and 1980s with many problems arising from the recession and administrative shortcomings imposed by successive directors appointed by the Government, the Cosipa entered the 1990s with the most negative results among Brazilian steelmakers. Since 1993, however, the Cosipa ceased to be a state enterprise. On August 20 in that year, the company was privatized through an auction on the State Stock Exchange of S√£o Paulo‚ÄîBolsa de Valores do Estado de S√£o Paulo (BOVESPA), and got to be controlled by a group of investors led by Usiminas. The privatization marked the beginning of a new era of goals and achievements. The renewal of its industrial park, completed in 2001, enabled Cosipa to operate at maximum capacity, that is, to produce 4.5 million tonnes / year of liquid steel and could cope with their environmental problems. These two objectives were consolidated through a R $1.1 billion investment plan in the equipment of the Cubatao plant, of which R $240 million was only for environmental control equipment. From mid-2005, after being formally integrated into the Usiminas System, it has shown a series of excellent financial results and other business indicators. Quite integrated into the community of Santos, one of the initial challenges in the post-privatization period for Cosipa was preparing to touch 5 million tons of annual liquid steel with a new Casting Machine 4, converter 7, Line Hot Rolling, the modernization of casting Machine Continuous 3 and the revamping of Blast Furnace 1.

She was known for her wise intellect and for her intense devotion to serving the will of God while being noted for being prone to ecstasies and other visions. Her beatification process culminated on 11 September 1754 after Pope Benedict XIV approved her beatification. Life Giovanna da Orvieto was born in the Umbria province in 1264 and was orphaned prior to 1269. Other relatives took care of her following the deaths of her parents. From the age of ten in 1274 she decided to devote herself to Jesus Christ and follow the Dominican path and aged fourteen she joined that order and received the habit around that time. She worked as both a seamstress and embroiderer and during her adolescence refused prospects of marriage to instead focus on her call to the religious life. She became a professed member of the Third Order of Saint Dominic in Orvieto. In the last decade of her life she received a range of ecstatic visions. Giovanna died in 1306. Her remains were later moved on 18 November 1307 and then transferred on two more occasions in 1610 and on 4 May 1743 for the final time. Beatification The request for a prompt beatification was made to Pope Benedict XIII in 1728 but it was not until 11 September 1754 that Pope Benedict XIV issued a decree that confirmed the late religious' local \\"cultus\\" - otherwise known as popular veneration - and thus approved of her beatification. The late religious is held as the patron of both seamstresses and embroiders while Pope Pius XI later made her the patron of all Italian working women in 1926.

Biography Nicholson was a trombonist in big bands of the 1930s and 1940s. After a tour of duty in World War II, and more work with dance bands in the Buffalo New York area, he was hired in October 1952 by NBC director E. Roger Muir, at the request of Bob Smith (who Nicholson had worked with in Buffalo), for The Howdy Doody Show, formerly known as \\"Puppet Playhouse.\\" Nicholson played various characters during the show's early years, among them J. Cornelius \\"Corny\\" Cobb. He assumed the role of Clarabell the Clown, after the show's original Clarabell, Bob Keeshan, was fired in late 1952 over a salary dispute. At Nicholson's request, he was replaced as Clarabell by musician Lew Anderson in 1954 and reverted to his role of Corny Cobb, which he kept until the end of the show in 1960. Nicholson also assumed the voice roles for several of the puppets after Allen Swift left the show in 1956. Prior to joining The Howdy Doody Show, Nicholson formed the studio Soundac, which is best known for producing the animated series Colonel Bleep. After Nicholson left, Robert D. Buchanan took his place. Nicholson got his nickname of \\"Nick\\" on the show, as there were up to six men named \\"Bob\\" on the cast and crew at any given time. He was also kept busy at NBC as a staff conductor of the NBC Symphony for ten years, including the early (pre-Doc Severinsen) years of \\"The Tonight Show,\\" when Skitch Henderson wasn't available for the show. He also did musical arrangements for various NBC shows and for many performers. Along with Muir under their company \\"Nicholson-Muir Productions\\", he helped create and produce several game shows, most notably the first two versions of The Newlywed Game. Nicholson also assumed the role of Corny Cobb for the revival of Howdy Doody in 1976-1977 and at a 40-year anniversary special in 1987. Nicholson spent most of the later years of his life as a trombonist, conductor, arranger, and composer. He was one of the founders of the Westchester Philharmonic in 1983, for which he also served as principal conductor, and he was also one of the founders of the Florida Symphonic Pops (later the Boca Raton Symphonic Pops).

It is a special collection of books and manuscripts of an erotic or pornographic character which, because of their rarity and value, may be seen only with authorization. The Enfer was established 1836‚Äì1844 and is one of the most famous Private Case collections.Alison Moore, Arcane Erotica and National ‚ÄòPatrimony‚Äô: Britain‚Äôs Private Case and the Collection de l‚ÄôEnfer of the Biblioth√®que Nationale de France. Cultural Studies Review 18 (1), 2012, 196-216. In 2013, the Enfer contained about 2,600 volumes, dating from the 16th century to the present.  Meaning  The roots of the Enfer at the Biblioth√®que nationale de France date to the end of the 17th century. The catalogue, which was introduced in the then Biblioth√®que du Roi (\\"Royal Library\\"), already separated \\"good\\" and \\"bad\\" books. In 1702, orthodox and heterodox theological treatises, literary and entertaining novels, love and adventure stories were given different Library classification press marks (or \\"call numbers\\"). By the mid-18th century, there were 24 \\"ouvrages licencieux\\" (\\"scandalous works\\"),Catalogue des livers imprim√©s de la Biblioth√®que du Roy: Belles-Lettres, 1re‚Äì2e partie, Paris 1750 including Pietro Aretino's prostitute dialogue \\"Ragionamenti\\". These scandalous works were kept mostly in a special \\"cabinet\\" (a bookcase), and there are likely to have been fewer than 50 before the French Revolution of 1789 ‚Äì although legal deposit was introduced in 1537 by Fran√ßois I. However, \\"ouvrages licencieux\\" were banned in France generally; so clandestine editions were printed in Holland or Switzerland and distributed and sold in secret. Such books found their way into the Royal Library only after seizures of banned books or, more rarely, as gifts or purchases. Such books were not made available to the reading public, although they appeared in library catalogues. During the French Revolution, the book collections of fleeing aristocrats and secularized monasteries contributed significantly to the growth of public libraries. However, as a result of strict censorship under Napoleon, many banned books were destroyed. In the Biblioth√®que nationale particularly notable books were first separated from the general library in 1795, and the foundations of the later R√©serve (Rare Books collections) was established. Between 1836 and 1844, the concept (not the press mark) \\"Enfer\\" appeared for the first time in the library inventories for morally dubious writings. The library director, Joseph Naudet, characterized these works as follows: \\"fort mauvais, mais quelquefois tr√®s pr√©cieux pour les bibliophiles, et de grande valeur v√©nale; cet enfer est pour les imprim√©s ce qu'est le Mus√©e de Naples pour les antiques.\\" (\\"extremely reprehensible from a book collector‚Äôs view but sometimes highly valuable and of great resale value; this hell is for the pamphlets, what the Napels Museum is for ancient art.\\").Marie-Fran√ßoise Quignard, Raymond-Josu√© Seckel: L‚ÄôEnfer de la Biblioth√®que. √âros au secret. Paris 2007. Pg. 26. The exact circumstances under which this closed-collection of books was built up during the reign of Louis Philippe are not known. However, a significant influence was likely to have been the increasing prudery of the bourgeoisie in post-revolutionary France. By establishing a sequestered collection of erotic material, the ordinary reader was screened from works that were considered objectionable and detrimental to the moral health of readers.  Name  The first collection of books called an Enfer is attributed to the Feuillants convent in Paris, on the Rue Saint-Honor√©. These monks reportedly kept in the attic, ironically described as \\"hell\\", a large number of Protestant writings that had been given to the convent in 1652. The name apparently played on the fate that frequently befell the authors and readers of forbidden and heretical works (i.e., burning). Collections of theological writings of a similar character, not always carrying this title, were widely used, most famously in the Vatican Library. At the time of the Second Empire, at the latest, the word \\"enfer\\" was widely used to refer to a clandestine or sequestered collection. Pierre Larousse‚Äôs Encyclopedia Grand dictionnaire universel du XIXe si√®cle (Paris 1866‚Äì1877) defined the word as \\"endroit ferm√© d'une biblioth√®que, o√π l'on tient les livres dont on pense que la lecture est dangereuse; exemple: l'Enfer de la Biblioth√®que nationale.\\" (\\"A closed area in a library, containing books whose reading is considered dangerous, for example: The 'hell' of the Biblioth√®que nationale.\\").Grand dictionnaire universel du XIXe si√®cle. Administration du grand dictionnaire universel, Paris 1866‚Äì1877, Vol. 7, pg. 557 In 1913, the Biblioth√®que nationale received a huge book collection from Auguste Lesou√´f and his sister (whose married name was Smith); 34 of these items were given the press mark Enfer Smith-Lesou√´f. The prints and photographs of the Biblioth√®que nationale also received a special press mark, if they were seen as morally questionable. Other libraries separated their Erotica from their general collections, in a similar way to the Biblioth√®que nationale. These libraries often used obscure collection names and press marks, such as The Private Case at the British Museum, the *** (or Triple star) collection at the New York Public Library, the Œî (Greek Delta) collection in the Library of Congress and the Œ¶ collection (Greek Phi) at the Bodleian Library.Dass die gr√∂√üte pornografische Sammlung in der Vatikanischen Bibliothek zu finden sei, ist allerdings eine weit verbreitete Legende.  Inventory and cataloguing  After the establishment of the Enfer, the public were curious about which, and how many, works were contained in the collections. It was assumed to be a very impressive collection, as many books had been seized during the French Ancien R√©gime, at the peak of literary libertinism, during the life of authors such as the Comte de Mirabeau, the Marquis de Sade or R√©tif de la Bretonne. From 1848 to 1850, the Enfer was subject to a public attack, accused of the negligent loss of a large numbers of books. Two-thirds of original 600 books were rumoured to have been lost, not least because unsupervised young employees had acted as attendants. In fact, the library then had, at most, 150 books. The first supplementary volume of the Grand dictionnaire universel du XIXe si√®cle of 1877 discuss the popular opinions about the Enfer: \\"Il existe √† la Biblioth√®que nationale un d√©p√¥t qui n‚Äôest jamais ouvert au public; c‚Äôest l‚ÄôEnfer, recueil de tous les d√©vergondages luxurieux de la plume et du crayon. Toutefois, le chiffre de ce recueil honteux n‚Äôest pas aussi √©lev√© qu‚Äôon l‚Äôimagine g√©n√©ralement, puisque le nombre des ouvrages n'y est que de 340 et celui des volumes de 730. Mais il est bon de noter que cette cat√©gorie ne comprend que les livres d‚Äôune obsc√©nit√© r√©voltante, ceux qu‚Äôil est d√©fendue de communiquer sous quelque pr√©texte que ce puisse √™tre.\\" (\\"In the Biblioth√®que nationale there is a stock that is not open to the public; it is the Enfer, the rendezvous of all the excesses of the pen and the pencil. However, the size this shameful collection is not as high as one generally imagines, as the number of books is only 340 and the volumes only 730. But it is good to note that this category includes only the repulsive obscene books, those that are forbidden to circulate under any pretext.\\")Grand dictionnaire universel du XIXe si√®cle. Administration du grand dictionnaire universel, Paris 1866‚Äì1877, Suppl. 1, pg. 366 The Enfer experienced renewed growth during the Second Empire, particularly due to the tightened censorship. In 1865 and 1866, the collection grew by more than 330 items; in 1876, there were 620 titles, of which more than half originated from seizures. In 1886, the collection had increased to slightly more than 700, including many cheap reprints of Libertine novels from the Ancien R√©gime. The Enfer remained virtually inaccessible. To be allowed to consult one of his books a strongly reasoned application needed to be made to the head office, and the decision of a committee was required. Between 1876 and 1886, the original press mark for the Enfer, which had been in use since the late 17th century, was replaced with Y2. This press mark is used in 1896 in the general catalogue of the Biblioth√®que nationale. From 1909 to 1913, Guillaume Apollinaire and others prepared, without the support or knowledge of library management, a special bibliographic catalog, which recorded 854 titles and described the works. (The library had managed to stop the first, less well disguised start, made by the linguist Robert Yve-Plessis after 1900.) Apollinaire's catalog was issued in an edition of 1,500 copies, a second edition of 1919 sold 2,000 copies, clearly showing the scale of the public interest in the Enfer. The 1978 catalog of the Enfer by Pascal Pia added around 700 titles.  Repurposing  The work of Apollinaire and Pia contributed largely to publicising the Enfer and the literature it contains. The stock of the Enfer was enlarged in the 20th century mainly through acquisitions from ordinary bookstores. In the 1980s, the renowned publishing firm Fayard published a seven-volume collection of out-of-copyright novels held in the Enfer, with contemporary photographs and explanatory introductions. Book historians are concerned with the material that is preserved in the Enfer, while new cultural historians study the pre- revolutionary pornography found in it. A prominent example is Robert Darnton, who points to the emancipatory potential of the texts in which social and religious criticism are often embedded in moral transgressions. The development of the book market, changing moral standards and the widespread repeal of censorship regulations have changed the character of the Enfer. Through the mass availability of erotic and pornographic works it has lost a sense of purpose. Already in 1909, serial fiction was kept in it to protect it against theft. The further growth of this cheaply produced literature led, in 1932, to a separate press mark within the collection, replaced between 1960 and 1969 by two more specific signatures of the general catalog, which in turn were abandoned without being replaced. The Biblioth√®que nationale closed the Enfer press mark in 1969, but opened it again in 1983, for practical reasons; for librarians and library users, it was easier to find all the erotic works under a single press mark. The acquisition policy of the Biblioth√®que nationale is, however, no longer based only on genre. While efforts are made to continue collecting erotic material, the decisive factor now is rarity or bibliophilic quality. Besides older works that were missing from the Enfer, contemporary and foreign books are added to the Enfer. By 2013, the collection had grown to 2,600 volumes, dating from the 16th century.The online catalogue of the Biblioth√®que nationale lists 2,706 entries, of which around 100 are empty (accessed on 9 February 2013). Since 1977, access to the Enfer is no longer stricter than for the rest of the R√©serve collections.

A native of Germany, Ettinger trained there before coming to the Tufts University School of Medicine. She had come for a visit to Boston to demonstrate the spot film imaging technique, and she decided to stay at Tufts permanently. Ettinger was associated with the school until she was 86 years old. She won recognition from several radiology societies, and Tufts established an endowed chair in her name. The spot film technique greatly enhanced X-ray diagnostic capabilities in the United States, particularly in gastrointestinal imaging. Early life and education Born in Berlin, Germany on October 8, 1899, Ettinger attended school at Chamisso Gymnasium in Berlin and was a member of the graduating class of 1919. Ettinger went on to pursue a medical degree at the Albert Ludwig University in Freiberg. She graduated in 1924, and she completed her residency and training in internal medicine and radiology at the Second Clinic of Charite, affiliated with Friedrich Wilhelm University. Upon completion of her residency, Ettinger went to work for Dr. Hans Heinrich Berg, who was world-renowned for his work in roentgenology. He invented a new device that allowed fluoroscopic images to be captured and printed onto X-ray film. Fluoroscopy was a popular X-ray technique at the time, but the disadvantage to this method was that it did not leave a permanent image on film until Berg's device was introduced. Move to the U.S. In 1932, after Ettinger had worked under Berg's tutelage and guidance for more than two years, Dr. Joseph Pratt of Tufts Medical School and Boston Dispensary wrote to Berg and requested one of his revolutionary devices as well as a member of his team to demonstrate its usage; Ettinger was selected for the task. She traveled from Berlin to Boston with the spot film device in her luggage. Ettinger was only going to stay in the United States for six weeks, but she permanently relocated to Boston, joining the faculty of the Tufts University School of Medicine. Ettinger's introduction of the spot film opened up the possibility of modern gastrointestinal imaging capabilities in the United States. Seven years after her arrival, Ettinger became the first radiologist-in-chief at both the Boston Dispensary and New England Medical Center Hospital in 1939. She then launched the Tufts radiology residency program and was involved in the creation of the Northeastern University program for X-ray technicians, one of the first of its kind. Ettinger was announced as a professor and chairwoman of radiology at Tufts School of Medicine in 1959. Ettinger was one of the first radiologists to recognize that the dye used in common imaging practices could damage a patient's kidneys. As a Jewish-German immigrant herself, Ettinger worked to help place other Jewish immigrants with jobs during World War II. Honors and awards In 1982, Ettinger received a Gold Medal from the Radiology Society of North America and in 1984 she won the Gold Medal Award from the American College of Radiology for distinguished service and dedication to the field of radiology. The American Association for Women Radiologists presents the Alice Ettinger Distinguished Achievement Award to recognize a career of service to the association and to the radiology profession. During her time as a professor, her students selected her to receive the faculty teaching award for thirteen consecutive years. There is an endowed position in her name at the Tufts Medical School, known as the \\"Ettinger-Dreyfuss Chair of Radiology\\". Later life Ettinger retired from the position of chairwoman in 1965, but continued as a practicing physician and professor until her retirement in 1985. She remained associated with Tufts' radiology teaching program until she was 86 years old. In 1993, Ettinger died of pneumonia in a nursing home in Norwood, Massachusetts.

It aired in three parts on ABC from February 8‚Äì11, 1981. It was directed by Harvey Hart from a teleplay by Richard Shapiro, and starred Timothy Bottoms, Jane Seymour, Bruce Boxleitner, Soon Tek-Oh, Sam Bottoms, Hart Bochner, Karen Allen and Lloyd Bridges. It ran for roughly 382 minutes. Plot Following the Civil War, Union veteran Cyrus Trask has two sons: Adam, a gentle, idealistic soul; and Charles, a hellraiser. Cyrus favors Adam and Charles is very aware of it, creating friction between the brothers. Cyrus, by now an influential diplomat who has amassed a fortune by embezzling from the government, pulls strings to get Adam into West Point. Adam rebels, however, and goes off to lead the life of a vagabond. Following Cyrus' death, Adam returns to the family farm in Connecticut and mends his relationship with Charles, with whom he shares a large inheritance. The series also concerns the life of Cathy Ames, an evil woman who delights in manipulating and destroying people. As a preteen girl, she falsely accuses two boys of trying to rape her. At 16, she drives her Latin teacher to suicide by toying with his affections. She then murders her parents and runs away, eventually becoming the mistress of a whoremaster named Jules Edwards. When Edwards realizes she is using him, however, he gives her a severe beating and leaves her to die. Adam finds her and nurses her back to health, and soon falls in love with her. Charles sees through her, but soon he too succumbs to her charms and sleeps with her. Adam and Cathy move to the Salinas Valley in California, where Cathy gets pregnant and gives birth to twin boys. Shortly afterward, she tells Adam that she is leaving him, and shoots him in the shoulder when he tries to stop her. Adam is devastated, but eventually recovers with help from his loyal Cantonese servant Lee and his old friend Samuel Hamilton. Lee and Hamilton relate to Adam the story of Cain and Abel, and tell him that God's admonition to Cain - \\"Timshel\\", Hebrew for \\"thou mayest\\" - symbolizes a human being's freedom to choose between good and evil and forge their own path in life. Inspired, Adam becomes a devoted father to his sons, whom he names Caleb (\\"Cal\\") and Aron. He tells them that their mother is dead. Meanwhile, Cathy changes her name to Kate Albey and finds work at a whorehouse in Monterey. She endears herself to the madam, Faye, who eventually puts Kate in her will; Kate then murders her and takes over the whorehouse. Adam tries to win her back, but she rejects him and tells him that Charles is the boys' father. (It is left ambiguous whether she is telling the truth.) The story moves ahead several years, with Cal and Aron as teenagers. They are opposites: Aron is virtuous and dutiful, Cal wild and rebellious. In a parallel situation to Adam and Charles, Cal believes that Adam favors Aron, and acts out to get his father's attention. Cal learns that Kate is still alive and goes to see her. Cal's goodness and professed love for his father makes Kate uncomfortable, and she spitefully tells him that he is just like her. Cal replies that she is merely afraid, and leaves. On his way out, she tells him not to tell Aron. When Adam goes nearly bankrupt after a bad investment, Cal resolves to prove his worth by making the money back. He goes into business with Samuel Hamilton's son Will growing beans, with the expectation that crop prices will skyrocket when the U.S. declares war on Germany. Their plan succeeds and they make a huge profit, which Cal proudly presents to his father. To his dismay, however, Adam rejects the gift as \\"dirty money\\". Cal lashes out by taking Aron to see Kate at the whorehouse and introducing her as their mother; Aron is horrified, and runs away to enlist in the war. Racked with guilt, Cal burns the money he made from the investment. Kate, meanwhile, loses her mind. In the following months, Cal and Aron's girlfriend Abra fall in love. Tragedy strikes, however: Adam receives a telegram saying that Aron has been killed in battle, and suffers a debilitating stroke. Cal feels responsible, and confesses to Adam what he did. Lee tells the dying Adam that he must give his only remaining son his blessing so he can live a good life. With his last ounce of strength, Adam says one last word to Cal: \\"Timshel\\".

Often when a community is gradually shifting away from an endangered language to a majority language, not all speakers acquire full linguistic competence; instead, speakers have varying degrees and types of competence depending on their exposure to the minority language in their upbringing. The relevance of speaker types in cases of language shift was first noted by Nancy Dorian, who coined the term semi- speaker to refer to those speakers of Sutherland Gaelic who were predominantly English-speaking and whose Gaelic competence was limited and showed considerable influence from English.Dorian, N. C. (1977). The problem of the semi-speaker in language death. Linguistics, 15(191), 23-32.Dorian, N. C. (1980). Language shift in community and individual: The phenomenon of the laggard semi-speaker. International Journal of the Sociology of Language, 1980(25), 85-94. Later studies added additional speaker types such as rememberers (who remember some words and phrases but have little or no grammatical competence and do not actively speak the language), and passive speakers (who have nearly full comprehension competence but do not actively speak the language). In the context of language revitalization, new speakers who have learned the endangered language as a second language are sometimes distinguished.Hornsby, Michael. \\"The ‚Äúnew‚Äù and ‚Äútraditional‚Äù speaker dichotomy: bridging the gap.\\" International Journal of the Sociology of Language 2015, no. 231 (2015): 107-125.Grinevald, Colette. \\"Speakers and documentation of endangered languages.\\" Language documentation and description 1 (2003): 52-72.Grinevald, Collette & Michel Bert. 2011. \\"Speakers and Communities\\" in Austin, Peter K; Sallabank, Julia, eds. (2011). Cambridge Handbook of Endangered Languages. Cambridge University Press. . p.50 In contexts of language acquisition and language teaching studies, there is sometimes a distinction between native speakers and second language speakers, depending on whether the language was learned as a language of primary socialisation or after having fully acquired a first language. In contexts of multilingualism a bilingual speaker may also be described as a heritage speaker (although a heritage language actually refers to a language whose speakers have moved from the original area where the language was spoken: e.g. Welsh is a heritage language in Patagonia, but not in Wales) if they have not been as fully exposed to one of their languages, leading to a diminished degree of confidence in themselves as speakers, and sometimes also limited competence in one of their languages. Typology = Rememberers = A rememberer knows individual words or phrases (sometimes entire texts) but cannot use the target language productively. Such persons are of particular interest when studying any endangered or dying language. Rememberers are contrasted with fluent or full speakers, who have a good command of the language, and semi-speakers, who have a partial command of it. The distinction between fluent speakers and rememberers is important in fieldwork, but accurately determining where a member of a language community falls on the speaker-rememberer continuum can be challenging. = Passive speakers = A passive speaker (also referred to as a receptive bilingual or passive bilingual) has had enough exposure to a language in childhood to have a native-like comprehension of it, but has little or no active command of it. Such speakers are especially common in language shift communities where speakers of a declining language do not acquire active competence. For example, around 10% of the Ainu people who speak the language are considered passive speakers. Passive speakers are often targeted in language revival efforts to increase the number of speakers of a language quickly, as they are likely to gain active and near-native speaking skills more quickly than those with no knowledge of the language. They are also found in areas where people grow up hearing another language outside their family with no formal education. = Semi-speakers = A semi-speaker is a speaker who has acquired a partial linguistic competence in a given language, but who does not generally use it regularly in conversation. Their speech can contain erroneous forms. Semi-speakers are often among the most motivated and engaged participants in language revitalization projects.Grinevald, Collette & Michel Bert. 2011. \\"Speakers and Communities\\" in Austin, Peter K; Sallabank, Julia, eds. (2011). Cambridge Handbook of Endangered Languages. Cambridge University Press. . p.50 As languages become obsolete and speech communities shift to other languages, they are spoken less frequently and in fewer social domains. Many speakers learn the language partially, often in a simplified way, with significant influence from the majority language. They are sometimes referred to as \\"semi-speakers\\", \\"quasi-speakers\\" or \\"rememberers\\". The word semi- speaker was introduced by linguist Nancy Dorian in describing the last speakers of the East Sutherland dialect of Scottish Gaelic.Dorian, Nancy C. 1980. Language Shift in Community and Individual: The Phenomenon of the Laggard Semi-Speaker. International Journal of the Sociology of Language. Vol. 1980, Iss. 25, Pages 85‚Äì94N. Dorian, \\"The Problem of the Semi-Speaker in Language Death,\\" International Journal of the Sociology of Language 12 (1977): 23-32. When semi-speakers form a significant part of the speech community, language contraction often ensues, as the linguistic norms are accommodated to the competences of the speakers. = Terminal speakers = A terminal speaker is the last speaker of a language. A terminal speaker may still be alive, or may have been the last person speaking what is now an extinct language.Polinsky, Maria. 1995. Cross-linguistic parallels in language loss. Southwest Journal of Linguistics 14.1-2 pp. 87-123. In the process of language death, the remaining speakers begin to lose some of the vocabulary and grammar of the language, so when there is only a last terminal speaker, that person will not remember a complete form of the language as it had been spoken by a larger community using it in all language domains. Being a terminal speaker means that the person is bilingual, remembering their heritage language but interacting with their community in another language. The importance of this distinction is seen in the story of Dolly Pentreath of Cornwall. She is popularly named as the last fluent, first-language speaker of Cornish, but there were others who still spoke it for many years, though possibly incompletely. Terminal speakers are sometimes found by linguists doing language documentation on a language before it dies. A clear example of a terminal speaker being contacted by a linguist is the case of Abegaz, the last speaker of the Mesmes language in Ethiopia.Ahland, Michael Bryan. (2010). Language death in Mesmes. Dallas: SIL International and the University of Texas at Arlington. He lived in an isolated hilly area and was about 80 years old when he was contacted by a team of sociolinguistic language surveyors; he has died since that contact. Ned Maddrell was the last speaker of the Manx language before its revival, having died in 1974.

The paper stated that whenever the interests of the native Africans clashed with those of Asian, European, or Arab settlers, those of the Africans should prevail. The Declaration blocked the move towards self- government advocated by the colonialists, and in its place advocated a policy of trusteeship, whereby the imperial state would protect the interests of Africans. Although the Paper had little effect on the welfare of native Africans, it nonetheless set a precedent for future conflict resolution between the various groups living in the colony. Background The Legislative Council established to govern the East African Protectorate originally consisted of three appointed white settlers. However, other white settlers in the colony resented the fact that they could not elect representatives to the Council, and, led by Lord Delamere, began to demand \\"no taxation without representation\\". In 1916, white settlers were elected to the Council, and focused predominantly on European settler issues. The Asian community had, in 1911, been granted appointed seats on the non-official (opposition) side of the Legislative Council, two occupied by Indians and one by an Arab. However, seeing the success of the European settlers in demanding elective representation, they began to demand the same privilege. They previously petitioned the colonial government for the right to purchase land in the fertile White Highlands, but this was denied and restricted to white settlers. Their demands for less restrictive policies on Indians, such as lenient immigration laws on Asians, frequently put them at odds with the European settlers. Meanwhile, in Southern Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe) and the Union of South Africa (now South Africa), the Boers and European settlers had managed to exclude the native African population completely from the governance of these territories. The British settlers in Kenya were increasingly interested in the political development of these places, and desired that such a form of government be implemented in Kenya. Therefore, in 1923, representatives of the white settlers were sent to London to negotiate for white minority rule in Kenya, as well as the exclusion of Asians from the White Highlands and restricted Indian migration into the colony. In turn, an Asian delegation was sent to lobby for the promotion of Asian interests, including their opposition to the restrictive immigration into the colony and restriction on land ownership in the White Highlands. The missionaries in the colony, sympathetic to the native African population, were similarly alarmed with the idea of white minority rule, and sent their own delegation to London to counter the settlers' proposals. The White Paper In Britain, various people such as John Ainsworth, Provincial Commissioner of Nyanza Province, and Lord Lugard, had previously argued that Kenya \\"is primarily a Black man's country and can never be a European colony\\" and that \\"it was contrary to ... British colonial policy that the small Kenyan settler community should have political control over large native communities.\\" On 23 July 1923, after deliberation on \\"the Indian question\\", the cabinet approved the right of the colonial government in Britain, and not the settlers, to impose limitations on immigration from India, but also continued to restrict Indian ownership of land in the so-called White Highlands. Based on this cabinet decision, the Duke of Devonshire, who was colonial secretary at the time, issued the \\"white paper\\", stating: Impact The Paper was intended to serve as a compromise between Indian interests and those of the Europeans, despite its affirmation of African paramountcy. Nevertheless, the Paper allowed for the (slow) improvement of African conditions, such as the establishment of technical schools for Africans by a 1924 Education Ordinance, as well as the appointment of Eliud Mathu to the Legislative Council, the first African to hold a seat. It also allowed for the formation of an African party, the Kikuyu Central Association, which presented African grievances to the colonial government. Although the Indians were prevented from settling in the White Highlands, they were granted five seats on the Legislative Council and immigration restrictions imposed on them by the white settlers were removed. The White Paper was used by the British government to retain control over the Kenya Colony, and is cited as one reason why Kenya did not develop as a white minority ruled country, as South Africa and Southern Rhodesia did.

Regulations  The directive required that all foodstuffs containing colouring, additives or flavouring, within member states in the EU, would have to be identified clearly on the packaging. The directive was an attempt to harmonise the identification of sweeteners and prohibit additives within certain foods. The directive would come into force in 1994, at which time all foods that did not conform would be banned from sale within the EU.  Prawn cocktail crisps  One particular euromyth about the directive was that it would lead to a ban of prawn cocktail-flavoured crisps in the United Kingdom. The source of the myth was a proposal by EU Commissioner Martin Bangemann to ban artificial sweeteners in crisps, thus leading to news reports that the EU wanted to ban prawn cocktail crisps altogether. As a result, Bangemann was called \\"The sour kraut who wants to ban our crisps\\" in the British media and journalists followed him in Luxembourg offering him prawn cocktail crisps. The potential ban was later proven to be as a result of a mistake on the part of the United Kingdom's civil service, who forgot to include specifically flavoured crisps when compiling a list of the nation's food items that were to be exempt from the directive. When the food industry pointed out this omission, the mistake was rectified.

B√ºsser's goal for MB&F; (for Maximilian B√ºsser and Friends) is for the company to remain small enough not to require a middle layer of management, which B√ºsser feels is detrimental to creativity. To that end he has capped the head count at 20 people and sells his timepieces in the hundreds rather than the thousands, although the majority of the brand's watches sell for upwards of $50,000. M.A.D. Gallery (2011 - present) B√ºsser created the first MB&F; M.A.D. Gallery in 2011 in Geneva, Switzerland. \\"M.A.D.\\" stands for Mechanical Art Devices. B√ºsser considers his timepieces to be kinetic art and created his own art gallery to display his sculptured Horological Machines in the context of mechanical art by other artists from all over the world. The M.A.D. Gallery concept has proved successful and, in addition to Geneva, there are now M.A.D. Galleries in Dubai, Geneva, Taipei and Hong Kong.

Family He was the younger son of John Vincent (d.1646) of Battens, North Hill, Cornwall by his wife Sarah and educated at Westminster School. In 1620 John Vincent was disclaimed at the heralds‚Äô visitation of 1620, and prosecuted in the court of chivalry for usurping the arms of the Surrey family. He then took holy orders but was unable to obtain a benefice before the Civil War and moved frequently. Matthias Vincent‚Äôs eldest brother became a fellow of All Souls in 1654. India Vincent joined the EIC as a factor in 1622 at a salary of ¬£20 per annum. In 1667 he was appointed to the company's governing council in Hooghly, becoming third in seniority at the Bay of Bengal factories in 1669. Following the death of John Marsh, he became Chief at Cassimbazar, arousing the wrath of Joseph Hall who said that Vincents \\"Actions will not admit of the Light, being works of Darkness's and therefore all he doth in the Companys Affairs must be in hugger muggur.\\" Nevertheless, on the death of Walter Clavell Vincent became \\"Chief of the factories in the Bay of Bengal\\". During his time at Hooghly, Vincent was accused by the Company of appropriating commissions due to it and of trading in goods, including pepper and copper, on his own account. Furthermore, a member of the Council at Hooghly claimed that Vincent had \\"practised Diabolicall arts with the Braminees (Brahmins)\\" and had bewitched him so that Vincent could \\"better fulfil his lustful desires with his Wife.\\" His accuser, to the horror of Vincent's superiors in back in London, also claimed he had used charms and poisons against people with the assistance of \\"Witches or other natives\\". After the notorious interloper Thomas Pitt married Vincents's niece, the EIC lost confidence in Vincent. In 1682 William Hedges, the EIC's new Bengal Agent, arrived in Hooghly with instructions to remove Vincent from his post. However, aware that he was about to be taken prisoner, Vincent appeared with a party of well armed soldiers and forced Hedges to retreat to the Dutch settlement of Chinsurah further inland. Vincent's position was further strengthened by the arrival of his protege Thomas Pitt with more men. After two futile years, Hedges gave up in his attempt and fled India for Persia. =Rugo the Podar affair= In 1673 a charge was brought against Vincent that he had been responsible for the death of the Hooghly Factory's cashier or podar. Streynsham Master, the Company's erstwhile Madras Agent was ordered to investigate the matter. It transpired that Rugo had been placed in the custody of Anant Ram, the Factory's broker on Vincent's orders to recover a sum of money he owed to the Company. Rugo died the first night he was in custody, with Ram claiming in a later deposition that he had only caused the Podar and his son \\"to be beaten with a few blows with a small stick, as little as the pen that is written withall.\\" The matter was closed (or hushed up) following a payment of 13,000 Rupees, which was charged to the Company's account. Although Vincent was cleared on the charge, the Company still sought his return to England and further legal action. At the same time he was ordered to repay the 13,000 Rupees. Subsequent career In 1683 Vincent returned to England aboard one of Thomas Pitt's ships to live in a princely style as a rich nabob. He was knighted by James I on 20March 1685, became treasurer of the Sons of the Clergy and was elected as MP for Lostwithiel, although he did not attend parliament. He was nominated as an alderman of the City of London in 1686 but died the following summer.

Brader served as a member of the missions in Ecuador for a brief period of time before being transferred to Colombia where she served as a catechist and evangelizer for the remainder of her life. Brader's canonization cause commenced on 24 October 1985 (she was titled as a Servant of God) and she was later made Venerable on 28 June 1999 before Pope John Paul II beatified Brader on 23 March 2003 in Saint Peter's Square. Life Maria Josefa Karolina Brader was born in the Saint Gallen canton on 15 August 1860 as the sole child of Joseph Sebastian Brader and Karolina Zahner. Brader was baptized on 16 August 1860. Brader was an intelligent child who excelled in her studies while at school in Kaltbrunn and she received the best education that her mother attempted to provide her with. There were high expectations for her future but she decided not to go through with further studies in favor of pursuing her call to the religious life. Brader entered a Franciscan convent at Maria Hilf in Altst√§tten on 1 October 1880 that the Sisters of the Third Order Regular of Saint Francis managed. Brader was clothed in the habit on 1 March 1881 - in which she was given a new name - and made her final vows on 22 August 1882. Her mother's initial opposition faded after her mother wanted Brader to remain at home due to being a widow and Brader being the sole child she had. Following her profession she was assigned to serve as a teacher. Brader volunteered to be one of the first six missionaries sent to work in Chone in Ecuador in 1888. Maria Bernarda B√ºtler was the head of the group and selected Brader herself and of that decision made known the fact that Brader \\"... will be able to render great services to the mission\\". The missionaries set off on 19 June 1888 and arrived that same month. Brader worked in Ecuador until 1893 as a catechist to children and as a teacher. Her superiors then transferred her in 1893 to T√πquerres in Colombia to teach the poor and the outcast. On 31 March 1893 she founded her own order - with the backing of the German priest Reinaldo Herbrand - in order to prepare additional missionaries that saw an influx of Swiss women before Columbians began to join. Brader served as the superior general for her new order in two terms from 1893 until 1919 and then again from 1928 until 1940. Her order received diocesan approval on 6 September 1893 while later being aggregated to the Order of Friars Minor Capuchin on 17 November 1906. It received the decree of praise from Pope Pius XI on 25 November 1922 and later went on to receive full papal approval in 1933 from Pius XI. Brader died in 1943 and when the news of her death spread the people visited her remains in droves to offer their respects to a woman hailed as a saint; her final words were to her nurse and she said: \\"Jesus ... I die ...\\". Before her death she said to her fellow sisters \\"I'm leaving\\" and urged them to continue the good work she began. Her funeral was celebrated on 2 March 1943 about a week following her death. There were a total of 614 religious in 103 houses as of 2005. Beatification The beatification process opened on 24 October 1985 after Brader became titled as a Servant of God once the Congregation for the Causes of Saints issued the official \\"nihil obstat\\" (nothing against) to the cause which allowed for the inauguration of the diocesan process that concluded not long after. The process received formal validation on 1 July 1991 from the C.C.S. once all documentation from the diocesan process was shipped in boxes to the department in Rome. The postulation later submitted the Positio to the C.C.S. in 1992 and it allowed for theologians to vote in favor of the cause on 29 January 1999. The cardinal and bishop members of the C.C.S. met and also approved the cause on 4 May 1999. Brader was named as Venerable on 28 June 1999 after Pope John Paul II confirmed that the late religious had lived a life of heroic virtue. The miracle needed for her to be beatified was investigated in the diocese of its origin and received validation in Rome on 20 November 1998 to which medical experts and theologians met to approve the cause; the C.C.S. issued their own approval to the miracle on 1 October 2002. John Paul II approved the miracle on 20 December 2002 and beatified Brader in Saint Peter's Square on 23 March 2003.

Yuen Ching Yan who appeared as an agile backpacker meets Tsz Kit while biking on the same lane and then when she is supposedly harassed by drug addicts at the beach, where Tsz Kit happens to teach surfing lessons, Tsz Kit saves her and brings her back to their B&B.; Ching Yan would eventually be living with them including she convinced Mei and Tsz Kit to also let her help out Tsz Kit with teaching surfing lessons for a reduced rent price living at their B&B; and even began to help out with servicing their customers at their B&B; business. Very soon, their B&B; becomes ambushed by assassins, which Ching Yan and Mei realized on time when they noticed the premises being surrounded by the assassins and then to Tsz Kit's surprising terrifying reaction, his adoptive mother Mei tosses a kitchen knife, which injured/killed one of the assassins and the agile backpacker Yuen Ching Yan brought out her gun shooting another assassin. The ambush battle then begins with Ching Yan shooting against the assassins coming in and then Mei brings out her gun from the kitchen counter and also starts firing against the assassins. Ching Yan and Mei then surround a terrified Tsz Git to protect him firing their guns against the assassins invading in and then ran into a safe house basement, where Mei and Ching Yan began grabbing weapons getting ready to fire back at assassins that have surrounded the premises and during this moment Tsz Kit is confused and questioning why Mei knows how to use a gun and why there is a secret safe house. Mei responded to not ask so many questions and must leave including Mei revealed she knew Ching Yan's real status as a bodyguard/assassin for them recalling how Ching Yan was able to manage holding an extreme hot scolding bowl of congee without using a tray to put it under to serve a customer at the B&B;, revealing she was trained to manage high temperature items on her hands as part of being an assassin and then as they are escaping outside, they are firing their guns against the assassins and Mei brings Tsz Kit into a bullet proof car and while escaping on the road, Tsz Kit begins asking questions about what their real statuses are and why there was an ambush, but Mei refused to answer and informed him she would be taking him to a new safe location to start a new life and it was best he did not know a lot. Unfortunately, Mei had suffered a gunshot wound and then the car crashes causing Mei to be trapped and unable to get out, which Tsz Kit was attempting to try to get her out, but then one of the assassins riding on a motorcycle is shooting at them causing the car's motor to catch fire, but luckily Ching Yan arrived on a motorcycle and shot the assassin, but with Mei being trapped and seriously hurt and knowing she cannot get out including the car was about to explode, she tells Tsz Kit to not seek answers to his real identity or the truth and to not get revenge for her and told him to run away immediately as far as possible. Mei then passes out and luckily Ching Yan saves Tsz Kit before Mei's car exploded, which killed Mei and then brought him into her car informing him that he is to stay with her if he wants to stay safe and to follow her orders. However, Tsz Kit ignored her orders and manages to escape and when he returns to their B&B;, he discovered it was bombed, but found a clue that his adoptive mother Mei left behind that led him to a buddhist temple finding a box with a lot of American Cash and several fake passports for different countries with different names and they all had Tsz Kit's picture on it including there were weapons in there that were disguised as beauty products. Tsz Kit realized Mei had arranged all of this in case if an ambush was to happen, he can use the passports to escape and have money to use and use the disguised weapons to protect himself. To probe into the matter, Tsz-kit uses the Hong Kong Passport his adoptive mother Mei had arranged and arrives to Hong Kong alone. With his best friend Tai Wah-koon pulling a few strings for him, Tsz-kit uncovers that his adoptive mother's death is connected to Ling Hung, an Iron Lady running multiple syndicates, who is so powerful that her decision will lead to a profound impact on the economy and livelihoods of the communities. Ling Hung has been known in Hong Kong to be one of the most ruthless and powerful tough mafia bosses in the underground mafia society, but she has a good warm-hearted side of her personality and being charitable when it came to family and being around normal average people. Tsz Kit notices that Ling Hung looks very much like his adoptive mother Mei, which raised Tsz Kit's suspicions even much more. It is soon revealed that Ching Yan was hired as a bodyguard by Ling Hung to protect Tsz Kit in Taiwan and when Ching Yan eventually catches up with Tsz Kit in Hong Kong, she orders him to stay with her and informed it is her job to protect him. At times, he manages to escape from Ching Yan's surveillance trying to find an opportunity to confront Ling Hung about his adoptive mother's death, but eventually Ling Hung had no choice, but to give in to explaining to Tsz Kit what happened and her relationship with his adoptive mother Mei. It was revealed that while Ling Hung was being ambushed in Hong Kong with her bodyguard Yik Fung and her adoptive son Kent Ling protecting her, the ambush that Tsz Kit and Mei experienced in Taiwan with Ching Yan involved also happened at the same time. It is later revealed Ling Hung is Tsz Kit's biological mother and that his adoptive mother Mei many years earlier had become good friends with Ling Hung. Mei and Ling Hung came from the same working-class neighborhood having their own stands on the street selling food products coincidentally on the same street, but they would soon have their own store business together. This time period was taking place approximately sometime in the late 1970s to early 1980s as the scene showed them meeting for the first time with Paula Tsui's song Seasons of The Wind(released in Hong Kong in 1981-82) playing in the background. Ling Hung's father passed away when she was at a very young age leaving her mother to be single and having to raise Ling Hung and her younger siblings Ling Hei(sister) and Lit(brother) living in a small apartment growing up being poor. Around the same time period when Ling Hung and Mei became great friends, Ling Hung's brother Lit became obsessed with wanting to make quick money and he joined an underground business as a young man, which Ling Hung and her mother tried to talk him out of, but he refused to listen. Very soon Lit gets into dangerous trouble, which involved Ling Hung and Mei trying to save him, but unfortunately this causes them to come into more complicated dangerous situations and the wrong kind of people, which resulted in them accidentally stepping into the mafia business and eventually Ling Hung's involvement in illegal business would lead her to have her own business with her being the leader. In Ling Hung's early stages of her illegal business during the 1980s, Ling Hung and her friend Mei including Yik Fung, who was their business partner, but now Ling Hung's bodyguard often got into gun battles with other gangs, which explains why Mei knew how to fire a gun when there was an ambush at the B&B.; During Ling Hung's early years of her illegal business, she was seriously hurt in gang violence at one period, which required her to be in hiding in Lantau Island from rival gangs as she needed significant time to recover from her injuries. During Ling Hung's time in hiding at Lantau Island, Mei was impersonating Ling Hung running the mafia business to protect it from being threatened by rival gangs, which Ling Hung was unaware of until Mei and Yik Fung came to visit her in Lantau Island and then Mei explained to Ling Hung that when she had made a request to Ling Hung two years earlier to allow her to leave the mafia society due to supposedly having enough of the blood battles, the reality was that she secretly had undergone plastic surgery to look like Ling Hung, which Yik Fung helped arrange. Mei's goal was to be Ling Hung's body double running and protecting the mafia business in needed desperate situations like this one and she was willing to sacrifice her life to allow Ling Hung to leave the mafia society to return to a normal safe life. This explains why Mei and Ling Hung looked like twin sisters even though they were not biologically related. While Mei was impersonating Ling Hung and leading the mafia business, Ling Hung was in hiding trying live a normal life in Lantau Island where she soon met a man immediately falling in love with him, who would soon impregnate Ling Hung giving birth to a male baby naming him Tsz Kit sometime in the mid to late 1980s. Unfortunately, Ling Hung's return to normal life was short lived after rival gangs found out the real Ling Hung was hiding in Lantau Island and there was an ambush once again, which involved Ling Hung's love of her life being killed in the process. Ling Hung is forced to give up her infant son Tsz Kit, which Mei took into her care and left for Taiwan to protect Tsz Kit from the dangerous violent mafia life. Ling Hung had no choice, but to return to the underground Hong Kong mafia business. Since she was accidentally forced in the mafia business, in order for her to survive and protect her family, she had to learn how to be ruthless and vicious when battling against enemies and later this would result in her business to grow to be very powerful over the next several decades running many large financial and real estate businesses in Hong Kong including some internationally and would become the head chairperson of the mafia alliance while Mei was raising and protecting Tsz Kit in Taiwan running a B&B.; While Mei was raising Tsz Kit in Taiwan, Ling Hung from Hong Kong continued to remain in touch with Mei on what was happening with Tsz Kit's daily life and how she can make arrangements to provide needed resources to Mei to raise Tsz Kit, which Yik Fung would be the one to help with making the arrangements often by traveling to Taiwan to check in on Mei. In addition, Ling Hung would buy birthday gifts every year for Tsz Kit with Yik Fung being the one to travel to Taiwan to give to Mei for Tsz Kit. In the beginning, Tsz Kit was angry at Ling Hung for being involved in the underground mafia society, which resulted in his adoptive mother being killed. Tsz Kit was brought to a buddhist temple by Ching Yan under Yik Fung's and Ling Hung's orders, where Mei's ashes were now interred in a resting place, which Yik Fung arranged for Mei's cremation and brought her ashes from Taiwan back to Hong Kong. Ling Hung and Yik Fung had arrived to the temple before Tsz Kit and Ching Yan did and in that moment Ling Hung was facing Mei's resting place thanking her for taking Tsz Kit to Taiwan more than 30 years earlier hoping that if they are not by Ling Hung's side, they would live safer simpler lives, but felt like she failed them as they were eventually ambushed and could not believe she was meeting Mei again in this form. Tsz Kit and Ching Yan then arrived to the temple to pay his respects to his adoptive mother and eventually he saw Ling Hung and Yik Fung in the same room realizing they arranged all of this and then he confronted Ling Hung with a lot of anger and promised that he would leave Hong Kong to live a safe normal life and never to see Ling Hung ever again. However, when there was an ambush happening against Ling Hung in a parking lot at the same building of where she was attending a musical event, which Tsz Kit found out about, he realized he could not stand to see his own mother be in danger and thanks to the fact he had some training from Ching Yan on how to use a gun, he came to save Ling Hung. But due to the fact that her bodyguard Yik Fung was involved with trying to save Ling Hung's nephew Ricky from a potential setup ambush earlier in the day, he was caught by police and at the police station's jailhouse at the time of the ambush and with Ching Yan not arriving into the parking lot yet to save Ling Hung as she was still caught in battling against the assassins in another part of the building and Ling Hung's adoptive son Kent Ling not available on site, Ling Hung and Tsz Kit who happened to come across guns lying around in the parking lot had no choice, but to defend themselves and they were rushing through the parking lot fiercely firing their guns against the assassins coming after them, which eventually ended and they were saved thanks to the law enforcement arriving to the scene. At this point, Tsz Kit decided to stay in Hong Kong realizing he could not live with the fact of leaving his own mother behind to let her live a dangerous life and wanted to protect her. Initially, Ling Hung was against his decision to stay behind in Hong Kong and warned him he could lose his life, but realizing Tsz Kit would never leave, she allows him to stay. Tsz Kit began learning how to use a gun and taking self-defense lessons with Ching Yan and even became Ling Hung's bodyguard to protect her. Ling Hung then slowly promoted Tsz Kit into working for her company starting off as an information file storage manager and later on he would become Ling Hung's assistant chairperson. Ling Hung's adopted son Kent Ling and his girlfriend Kate Wei are her think-tanks; whereas Yik Fung is her main bodyguard, but sometimes Ching Yan also fills in to protect Ling Hung. Kent Ling was abandoned by his biological parents as a child leaving him on the streets and Ling Hung happened to be strolling by finding him in starvation and stopped him from trying to grab food from the garbage can and then she would find a note attached by his biological parents they could not care for him. Ling Hung had treated him to congee at a nearby food stand when she found him on the day of 10/23, which also is the same birthday as Tsz Kit and since then, that date became an important date for Ling Hung and Kent Ling including Ling Hung adopted Kent eventually, which initially was because of Ling Hung's guilt of giving up her own biological son, however she would eventually grow to love Kent as he was her own biological son and every year on 10/23 they would go to the same stand to eat the same congee to honor Ling Hung taking him into her care. However, after Tsz Kit came back into Ling Hung's life, Ling Hung decided to go to Tsz Kit's birthday party with Yik Fung providing the suggestion since this was Tsz Kit's first birthday of not having his adoptive mother with him to celebrate with this year, which resulted Ling Hung to inform Kent Ling she could not arrive to the Congee stand to celebrate their important date as well as the congee food stand owner was about to retire soon. Kent Ling, however still held out hope Ling Hung would still make a late arrival and Kate, Kent's girlfriend called to let Ling Hung know this, which Tsz Kit would find out about this and selflessly told her to go to the Congee stand to celebrate this important date with Kent, which Ling Hung did make the late arrival. When Kent Ling found out that Ling Hung went to Tsz Kit's birthday party and being unaware of Tsz Kit's true identity, he became suspicious of Tsz Kit's frequent appearance around Ling Hung, which caused conflict between him and Ling Hung. Kent was also suspicious when he learned that Ling Hung decided to hire Tsz Kit as her bodyguard and eventually hiring him to work as an information file storage manager at the company and wondered why Ling Hung hired Ching Yan, one of the most top professional assassin to protect Tsz Kit. Eventually Ling Hung reveals to Kent Ling that Tsz Kit is Ling Hung's biological son, which he was the first one in the family to find out. When Kent Ling eventually realizes Tsz Kit is a kind hearted charitable person who came into Ling Hung's life to help her out and to protect her having no intention of fighting for any of Ling Hung's inheritances, he begins to accept Tsz Kit and becoming one of Tsz Kit's closest family members and his relationship to Ling Hung is back to normal. The rest of Ling family would then eventually find out about Tsz Kit's relationship to Ling Hung and he is accepted into the family. Meanwhile, Ling Hung's affiliates are waiting for an opportunity to wreak havoc, putting her life in imminent danger. Though Ching- yan and Tsz-kit join forces to strike back, they trigger a new wave of bloodshed that is about to engulf the whole society.... In the beginning, when Tsz Kit was introduced into the family, he was not used to having such a large family, which involved his mother Ling Hung, his adoptive brother Kent Ling, his grandmother, his aunt Ling Hei and her husband Sunny, his uncle Lit and his wife Tina, and his cousins Ricky, Anthony, Chloe, and Kelly including Anthony's wife Hilda whom all are living in the same household in a large mansion. Tsz Kit eventually gets used to being part of a large wealthy family including having meals with them, but still preferred to have his own independent life even though he was living in the same household with his partners Ching Yan, Ling Hung's bodyguard Yik Fung and his friend G-Force and wanted to still live the simple life he once had in Taiwan as much as possible, except when he was on dangerous missions and never had any intentions of wanting any of the Ling family inheritances. Tsz Kit then slowly learns the underground business operations and then becomes a hit man in order to protect his mother and his close loved ones against rival mafias and gangs often being involved in gun battles teaming up with his former body guard now partner Ching Yan, his adoptive brother Kent Ling, and Kent's girlfriend Kate. Very often, Ling Hung is at another location utilizing her cell phone/technology behind the scenes in managing/ordering the dangerous missions for the team to battle against the rivalries. Normally Ling Hung's bodyguard Yik Fung and sometimes her sons and other bodyguards would be with her to protect her from violent gun battles, but there have been times she has had to defend herself with a gun and shoot against the rival gangs coming after her. Tsz Kit and Ching Yan slowly began to fall in love throughout Tsz Kit's time in the mafia society, although at first they were in denial despite the fact there were many occasions where they almost kissed and even one time they were almost tempted into having sex in the living room when there were a few condoms lying around thanks to his friend G Force accidentally leaving them around. Eventually, Tsz Kit and Ching Yan embrace their love and are found kissing each other in more than one occasions. Throughout the series, some of Ling Hung's family members, which were her brother Lit, her nephews Ricky and Anthony, whom are also Lit's sons and her sister Ling Hei are shown to be corrupt and coming up with schemes often teaming up with the wrong kinds of people to gain profits and power for their greed including trying to take Ling Hung's chairperson position, which eventually caused all of them to be killed. Ling Hung's biggest rival enemy has been Wei Lui for many years. Wei Lui with greed and desire for power and profits has many times attempted to bring Ling Hung down including even trying take over her chairperson seat in the mafia alliance. Despite their rivalry statuses, Ling Hung's adopted son Kent Ling and Wei Lui's daughter Kate are a couple with no disapproval from the Ling and Wei families. Kate often is the mediator between the Ling and Lui families and despite trying to have her father stop trying to fight with Ling Hung and warning this would lead to lives being hurt, he never listened until there was a tragedy in the family. Tsz Kit was once an innocent average person in Taiwan, but after stepping into his mother's mafia society, he had to spend a lot of time learning how to make tough firm decisions when dealing with critical dangerous situations, which was not easy for him to learn and was still very soft-hearted and very forgiving even though he had corrupt family members that pose as dangerous threats to him and the rest of the Ling Family. Ling Hung, Ching Yan, and Kent Ling had to spend a lot of time teaching and reminding Tsz Kit of knowing how to be tough and firm even if it meant being ruthless when making decisions in dangerous moments. One time, Ling Hung discovered Ricky's selfish greedy decision to make profits with Johnny Cub, a Thailand mafia boss almost placed the lives of the Ling family and especially Tsz Kit in danger including Ricky's and also Tsz Kit's related young cousin Chloe being kidnapped by Johnny Cub, however Chloe was eventually rescued safely thanks to the efforts of Ling Hung, Tsz Kit, Kent, Kate, Ching Yan, Yik Fung and the rest of the crew coming in to rescue her, which involved Ling Hung with planting a bomb in a truck and blowing it up, which gave the whole crew a chance to shoot their guns against Johnny Cub's gang successfully including killing Johnny Cub. This resulted in Ling Hung giving Tsz Kit full familial authority to decide how to punish his cousin Ricky and reminded Tsz Kit again that he must know the game to be firm and tough in making prompt decisions when dealing with critical situations in the mafia society and this was Ling Hung's subliminal lesson to Tsz Kit that if someone has tried to hurt him especially if it placed his life and/or any of his loved ones in danger, to never hesitate to get revenge as needed, but because Tsz kit naturally always had a good heart who recently came from living an average normal life and was still very new in his mother's mafia society, he was unable to bring himself to do this and wanted to be forgiving being that Ricky was family and although Ling Hung had a more ruthless, likely deadlier intended punishment for Ricky, Ling Hung respected Tsz Kit's decision and instead made a much less harsher punishment, which was kicking Ricky out of the household and sent him to Taiwan. Ricky on his knees begged Ling Hung to let him have another chance and to not kick him out of the Ling family household, but because Ricky numerously have used harmful careless acts and getting involved with the wrong kinds of people; often Ling Hung's enemies to gain profits and never learning his lessons from them, Ling Hung stated to Ricky that he has been given so many chances already to correct and learn from his mistakes, but failed to do so and warned him to not force herself(Ling Hung) to have to make decisions she does not want to make. Ricky became infuriated with Ling Hung's decision to kick him to Taiwan and later on would trick Ling Hung, Tsz Kit, Kent Ling, Ching Yan, and Yik Fung to come to Taiwan to supposedly save Ricky from danger, but in reality it was a set up to have a respected mafia boss Tin Yeh in Taiwan be killed and frame Ling Hung for it and then this resulted in the Taiwanese mafias and gangs going after them and trying to kill them, so Ricky can take over Ling Hung's chairperson position to gain profits and power. This resulted in them to have to be on the run in Taiwan having to defend themselves with guns against the assassins coming after them, which involved Ling Hung's bodyguard Yik Fung to be injured in his leg in the process and since it was not safe for them to go to a hospital as the mafias and gangs would be able to track them down, luckily Tsz Kit remembered a house his adoptive mother Mei owned in Taiwan where they went to hide and Ching Yan did the procedure to take out the bullet from Yik Fung's leg with Kent, Tsz Kit and Ling Hung holding him down as the procedure was very painful for Yik Fung and while in hiding at the house, Yik Fung was recovering in a separate room. It was revealed that Wei Lui and his sons Michael Wei and George Wei were involved with Ricky to lure Ling Hung to Taiwan to have her killed, but when Kate found out about this, she arrived to Taiwan and found out the house Kent, Ling Hung, Ching Yan, Tsz Kit, and Yik Fung were hiding in and it was her attempt to stop her brothers Michael and George who were in Taiwan already from continuing this attack against Ling Hung as they were found out to be involved with this with the help of their father Wei Lui. In that period, Kent and Kate not knowing if they will be alive or dead took the chance to informally get married with Tsz Kit and Ching Yan as the witnesses and Ling Hung drinking the honorary teas in the house they were hiding in and later on there is scene showing Kate and Kent just finished having sex and naked in the bedroom. However, the Taiwanese gangs were still after them eventually found out where they were hiding and there was an ambush once more and due to Ling Hung's bodyguard Yik Fung still recovering from his injuries, the beginning scene of the ambush at the house they were hiding in showed Ling Hung having to fend for herself with a gun and shot one of the assassins outside the window and Kent shooting another assassin charging into the room Ling Hung and Yik Fung were sleeping in and Kate is shown with a gun on her hand looking outside to see if anymore assassins are coming in, but most of the ambush taking place at the house as shown in the series was in the living room where Ching Yan and Tsz Kit were sleeping in showing Tsz Kit and Ching Yan fiercely repeatedly shooting at them. Ling Hung and Kate are shown arriving into the living room with guns on their hands surrounding and protecting Kent unable to use a gun at the moment due to the fact he had to carry the injured Yik Fung. As they were getting ready to escape, Ling Hung noticed another assassin coming in aiming the gun behind her son Tsz Kit who was unaware and then pushed Tsz Kit out of the way causing her to be grazed in her side torso, but Ching Yan shot and killed the assassin. Kate then took an extreme measure to save Ling Hung and everyone else by going to another Taiwanese mafia boss Lui Yeh, who was responsible for ordering the deaths of Ling Hung, Tsz Kit, Ching Yan, Yik Fung and Kent Ling to convince him it was a set up by her father and Ling Hung was not responsible for Tin Yeh's murder, but this involved her being held hostage resulting in Michael and George needing to come save her as they were already in Taiwan working with Ricky and Kent also came along to save Kate. Unfortunately, Michael and George are killed when trying to save Kate and Kent leaving their wives and children on their own in Hong Kong and leaving Wei Lui without a living son. Ching Yan was able to secretly record Ricky's conversation with a gangster who also wanted to set up Ling Hung to be killed and the conversation contained proof that Ling Hung was being framed and that Wei Lui was responsible for Tin Yeh's death, which the video was uploaded on the Taiwanese websites and then all of the Taiwanese gangs and mafias would find out and Lui Yeh calls off the set up to kill Ling Hung and her crew and even apologized to Ling Hung for the mistake. Therefore, Ricky was exposed for trying to have Ling Hung killed and despite given many chances to correct his wrongful actions, Ricky continued to aggressively pursue trying to kill Ling Hung in the house they were hiding in leaving Tsz Kit no choice but to bring his gun out to shoot and kill Ricky to save Ling Hung's life with Ching Yan grabbing Ling Hung out of the way. Tsz Kit became horrified and shocked he had to make this ruthless action to kill Ricky to save Ling Hung and was feeling very guilty being Ricky was family, but Ling Hung, Ching Yan and Kent Ling reminded him this was the only and best option otherwise Ricky would have continued to be a dangerous threat to the Ling family and never would have learned from his mistakes being that Ricky was very greedy with wanting power and profits. Ling Hung, Tsz Kit, Kent, Kate, Ching Yan and Yik Fung return to Hong Kong from Taiwan and then had to break the news to the Ling family that Ricky was dead. Ricky's father Ling Lit would eventually find out about how his son was killed, but did not believe the truth about Ricky wanting set up Ling Hung to be killed, which then resulted in Ling Lit wanting to separate from the Ling family and teaming up with a corrupt politician Lau Zak Sing to benefit himself profitably and power-wise including attempting to kill Ling Hung, Kent Ling and Tsz Kit to avenge his son's death, which failed and instead Ling Lit is killed himself in an explosion set up by Lau Zak Sing with the help of a secret mafia boss named Rain Man. Tsz Kit slowly began to be more tough like Ling Hung with making firm decisions in handling dangerous situations and people; although at times he can be more extreme and ruthless than Ling Hung with his measures to manage dangerous enemies, but he still continued to retain his charitable good personality when it came to family and average people. Throughout the series, Ling Hung was shown trying to use her power to try to work with a good hearted politician Lee Tit Ngok to wipe out the corrupting and criminal businesses in Hong Kong and wanted to slowly leave the mafia life and do good deeds as a way to correct her past mistake of stepping into the mafia society accidentally, which had caused a lot of offense against the society of Hong Kong in the past and although Ling Hung made many attempts to work with Lee Tit Ngok, there was big barrier due to Rain Man, one of the most top secret mysterious behind the scenes mafia bosses who controls almost all of the underground illegal business activities and gang ambushes in Hong Kong finding out about this, which meant Ling Hung had decided to unknowingly go against Rain Man. As a result, Rain Man created situations that would either target her and/or her family members including members of her alliance, such as attempted ambushes against Ling Hung or manipulative setups to have her family members who were greedy for profits/power and members of her alliance to turn against Ling Hung. Of the ambushes that took place, one of them was when Ling Hung, Kent and Yik Fung attempted to meet with Lee Tit Ngok at a hotel to discuss how to make Hong Kong a better society and despite the fact they used careful procedures to keep the meeting a secret to avoid allowing other mafia bosses to know, Rain Man having heavy surveillance on the Ling family found out about this and stopped the meeting from happening with assassins dressed as hotel workers ambushing them, but luckily Kent and Yik Fung protected Ling Hung and fired their guns against the assassins. Coincidentally this ambush happened at the same time of when Tsz Kit and Mei were ambushed in Taiwan, but with Ching Yan protecting Tsz Kit also arranged by Rain Man. There was also another attempted ambush later on arranged by Rain Man against politician Lee Tit Ngo at a hospital, but was never injured thanks to Tsz Kit, Ching Yan and Kent along with their crew on scene protecting him and shooting their guns against the assassins trying to target Lee Tit Ngok. Very often, a corrupt politician Lau Zak Sing including Wei Lui, Ling Hung's long time enemy were involved with all of these situations as well. Later on, in one of the final episodes of the series, Ling Hung and the rest of the Ling family would find out the person to be Rain Man was Kam Tin, a corrupt police official and would also find out Kam Tin is the one who has been creating these attempted ambushes or manipulative setups targeting Ling Hung. Wei Lui who realized his mistake of constantly trying to go after Ling Hung, which resulted in his sons being killed had decided to work with Rain Man who he could only communicate with on phone initially and Rain Man was using a disguised voice. Wei Lui's real intention was to try to figure out Rain Man's identity and bring this person down to make up for what he did to his sons as it is revealed Rain Man was also involved in his sons being killed in Taiwan along with controlling almost all of the criminal and ambush activities happening in Hong Kong. Eventually when Wei Lui had a chance to speak to Rain Man in the same room with walls separating them both and with Rain Man still using a disguised voice, he was able to figure out it was Kam Tin due to the fact that Rain Man made a statement that strongly resembled Kam Tin's statement to him years ago when he was in a shootout war against Ling Hung, there was a set up to have him not killed in the shootout as a way to balance out the power between Ling Hung and the mafia alliance. Kent, Kate, Ching Yan and Tsz Kit attempted to save Wei Lui from Kam Tin, however before they could save him, Wei Lui is shot and killed when he discovered Rain Man's real identity, but left a clue with his blood on Tsz Kit's arm before he died, which led them to realize it was a top police official and then Ling Hung would figure out Rain Man is Kam Tin. Since Ling Hung refused to give up trying to clean up the mafia corruption system in Hong Kong and wanting to try to leave the mafia business slowly, Kam Tin would not stand for this, which would result in Kam Tin escalating manipulative deadly threats against her family members as a way to try to wipe out Ling Hung. Tsz Kit's aunt Ling Hei and his cousin Anthony being greedy for profits and power took advantage of the situation by creating a plot to try to force Ling Hung into signing over her power rights to her assets and the powerful corporate business over to them. Anthony revealed to Ling Hei that his father Lit had bought a poison potion from the black market years earlier in case Lit decided to use it one day to kill Ling Hung to gain access to her business and profits. Anthony's plan was to add the poison into Ling Hung's drink or food when the right opportunity comes, which would cause her to have heart attack like symptoms and to use that opportunity to try to make Ling Hung sign her power rights to her assets and her corporate business over to them and if she complied, she would be given an antidote or if she did not comply, she would be left to die either way as a chance for them to gain profits/power for their greedy needs in addition they would have the power to decide to not go against Rain Man and the mafia system of Hong Kong as their supposedly theoretical thinking to end Rain Man's vendetta against the Ling family. Ling Hei went along with Anthony's plan and one morning, Anthony added the poison into Ling Hung's soybean drink during breakfast to go on with this plan. However, this plot failed as the Ling family all discovered Ling Hei's and Anthony's tactics as Yik Fung, Ling Hung's bodyguard had recorded their conversation to poison Ling Hung, including that Ling Hung, Tsz Kit and Kent Ling tested them out by asking them that one of them should drink Ling Hung's glass of soybean milk, which contained the poison intended for Ling Hung and this would lead to their exposures of this attempt to kill Ling Hung. Tsz Kit even attempted to pour the poisoned soybean milk into Anthony's mouth as a warning to him. At this moment, Tsz Kit's tough mafia behavior has been slowly becoming more intense as he has experienced so many dangerous situations including losing his adoptive mother Mei and much later on his best friend G Force to mafia violence. Kent Ling then made a statement in that moment that the poison tumor must be eliminated immediately, which the expression means if there is a family member who is a potential dangerous threat to the family household, that person must be eliminated immediately, which likely meant death or more lives would be hurt. However, Ling Hung forgave them and gave them another chance after hearing pleas from other family members to not eliminate them. Ling Hung decided to end their very large corporate business they have had for many years, which actually was built up based on resources from the underground illegal businesses Ling Hung was involved with for many years. Ling Hung hoped this would be a way to leave the mafia business and to lead to a more simpler lifestyle, however Tsz Kit's aunt Ling Hei and cousin Anthony refused to accept this reality and being they wanted to continue to live the luxurious lifestyle they have had for so long and wanted power/profits, they formed their plot again in the final episode to kill Ling Hung to take over the business for their benefit to gain power/profits by trying to get in touch with Rain Man to help out, which Tsz Kit discovered on time and then at that moment Tsz Kit's ruthless tough mafia demeanor becomes even more intensely vicious, blood thirsty and unforgiving than Ling Hung ever was and this time he created a set up including playing games with them to sentence them to their deaths. Although Tsz Kit's mother had ordered him to bring Anthony and Ling Hei back to let Ling Hung punish them her way without violence because they are family, Tsz Kit who was now blood thirsty for Ling Hei and Anthony ignored Ling Hung's orders and unforgivably ruthlessly decided their punishment should be death, which he successfully accomplished. Tsz Kit devised a plan to have Ling Hung go into a safe shelter in hiding as it was revealed Rain Man had hired very high skilled professional assassins from mainland China meant to target Ling Hung and knowing that Ling Hei had heavy surveillance on Ling Hung's location and made attempts to contact Rain Man to kill Ling Hung, Tsz Kit created a set up to fool Ling Hei into thinking Ling Hung was kidnapped by Rain Man's henchmen, then in which Ling Hei went into Ling Hung's company office to create a false contract stating Ling Hung had signed over the rights of the company to her including even forging Ling Hung's signature, but Anthony walked in and threatened her with a gun into redoing the contract to have the company inherited to him, which Ling Hei did out of no choice and then tried to kill Anthony with a letter opener, but Anthony overpowered her and grabbed the letter opener stabbing and killing Ling Hei. Anthony then brings in the false contract stating he is now the head chairperson of the company into the meeting room with the rest of the alliance members, which were expecting Ling Hung to be at the meeting due to the fact Tsz Kit had posted a false meeting notice to the mafia public that Ling Hung was setting up the meeting with them as a way to fool Rain Man into thinking Ling Hung was going to be at the meeting and Tsz Kit knew that Rain Man would devise a sneaky set up to kill Ling Hung in the meeting room, but since Tsz Kit was so furious to find out Anthony and Ling Hei were trying to get Rain Man's help to kill Ling Hung, Tsz Kit wanting to protect Ling Hung made sure it was either Ling Hei or Anthony or both of them to fall into Rain Man's trap to be killed including he wanted the rest of the alliance members to fall into this trap since he knew how much they wanted to take down or kill Ling Hung to take over her chairperson seat and gain power, which was accomplished as Rain Man did set up a secret poison gas in the meeting room meant for Ling Hung, which killed all of the alliance members including Anthony, however Ling Hei was already killed by Anthony and placed into the trunk of his car. It is revealed Tsz Kit had bribed a telecommunications staff into exclusively redirecting all of Ling Hei's and Anthony's communication messages meant for Rain Man to Tsz Kit's cell phone, which is how Tsz Kit was able to figure out all of Ling Hei's and Anthony's plans to kill Ling Hung. At this point, the personality roles between Tsz Kit and Ling Hung switched where Tsz Kit is now making more extreme ruthless decisions and Ling Hung has become more soft- hearted. Ling Hung was devastated and in heavy tears by and questioned Tsz Kit's ruthless cold actions especially on why he did not stop Ling Hei's and Anthony's evil plans and bring them back to allow Ling Hung to manage the punishment for them and to give them another chance to correct their mistakes, however Tsz Kit responded that he knew that Ling Hung would be too soft- hearted to give an appropriate fair punishment to Anthony and Ling Hei and that they would have become more ruthlessly greedy with wanting power and profit including continuously pursuing to try killing Ling Hung to gain profit and power and would never learn from their mistakes. Tsz Kit also stated to Ling Hung and Kent Ling he will not stand to let his own mother along with any other innocent family members to die no matter what he has to do to protect them. Tsz Kit also bluntly said, if he was given another chance to handle the situation with Ling Hei and Anthony again, he would make the same decisions. Ling Hung responded with words saying he was ruthlessly conniving and too extreme and evil-spirited. Tsz Kit then reminded Ling Hung it was her who taught him to be firm and tough in making prompt decisions in critical dangerous moments in the mafia society. Ling Hung and Kent Ling whom were involved in the conversation with Tsz Kit over his ruthless actions started realizing and became too overwhelmingly and terrifyingly horrified and shocked as seen on their faces with guilt and fear that Tsz Kit who was once one of the most warm hearted easily forgiving member who was often more of a Peace maker as harmless as an Angel of the Ling family now have seemingly quickly turned into the most ruthless terrifying vicious blood thirsty Mafia as dangerous as the Devil/Satan of the Ling family who will now unforgivably and notoriously go to any extreme ruthless lengths to eliminate anyone who turns against or is a threat to the Ling family in any form. Ling Hung reacted almost in wanting to slap Tsz Kit for his vicious ruthless actions, but when she realized Tsz Kit was right about her teaching him to be firm and tough in the mafia society, she turned her hands and slapped herself and then fell to her knees in heavy tears feeling guilty and responsible that she turned Tsz Kit from an innocent warm-hearted easily forgiving person who was living a normal life to being a ruthless vicious cold unforgiving blood thirsty triad. Tsz Kit and Kent Ling started to tear up seeing Ling Hung's devastation and tried comforting Ling Hung and Tsz Kit even tried to tell her it is not her fault, but Ling Hung was too terrifyingly horrified and guilty to see what Tsz Kit has become as if she saw Lucifer took possession of Tsz Kit and pushed him away and Kent Ling brought her back into her bedroom to recuperate her emotions. It was revealed that Kam Tin, a corrupt police official is Rain Man, which is a name given to her to keep her identity a secret who is in a more higher ranking mafia position and has been pulling the strings controlling almost all of the illegal businesses and gang ambushes in Hong Kong and has been after Ling Hung and her entire family. Tsz Kit and his adopted brother Kent along with his team were able to expose Kam Tin as Rain Man, resulting in her identity no longer being a secret to the public. They were nearly successful in having Kam Tin captured by the authorities, but Kam Tin escaped through a slim chance and eventually she sets up an attempt to have her henchmen kidnap Ling Hung, which would cause Ling Hung's bodyguard Yik Fung to be killed in the process when he tried to save her. Kent Ling and his team of assassins are then forced to rescue Ling Hung, but it involved them and Ling Hung having to be in a very deadly gun battle against Kam Tin's henchmen and unfortunately Kent Ling's team are all killed in the process. Meanwhile, Tsz Git finds out who the most richest top Hong Kong mafia bosses are that gave Kam Tin the position to be Rain Man and with the incriminating evidence Tsz Kit had against Kam Tin, which also included involvement with these higher up mafia bosses along with proof that Kam Tin wanted to eventually betray them with the evidence she kept on them and since Kam Tin's secret identity as Rain Man was now exposed, he manages to convince the much higher up mafia bosses of Hong Kong to have Kam Tin's henchmen turn their guns against her executing Kam Tin to her death successfully saving Ling Hung and Kent Ling. Equivalent to Mei's attempt many years earlier to try to save Ling Hung and have her leave the mafia business, which unfortunately was a temporary success, Tsz Kit willingly took over the position as Rain Man working for them, being in one of the highest ranking ruthless mafia positions in Hong Kong far surpassing the highest status position Ling Hung has ever held in the mafia society. The motive was to save his mother and get her and the whole Ling family to leave the dangerous underground business safely to a normal simple safer life, which proved to be permanently successful this time unlike Mei's attempt many years ago. Including that Tsz Kit wanted to use the opportunity to get evidence to expose the most top Hong Kong mafia bosses of their illegal doings to prevent them from doing more harm to the Hong Kong society. Over the next two years, Ling Hung and her whole family have been living a normal simpler life and living in a new smaller house, where Ling Hung and her own mother now plant vegetables and potatoes in their yard. Ling Hung's two nieces Chloe and Kelly are also shown helping out with the yard and now living a more simpler average life. Kent Ling now is simply an average lawyer and his now wife Kate also living a simpler life and just became pregnant. By this point, they are the only remaining members of the Ling Family to be living together as Ling Hung's brother Lit, her nephews Ricky and Anthony, and her sister Ling Hei are now deceased due to their selfish greed. Ling Hei's husband Sunny, Anthony's wife Hilda, and Lit's wife Tina are assumed to have left. Ching Yan now is a traveler and helping with building a school in Thailand. Tsz Kit was presumed to be deceased initially to the Ling family, but Ching Yan and the whole family did not give up hope and believed that Tsz Kit created a convincing set up to fake his death to save the Ling family and to tear down the criminal empire of Hong Kong, which turned out to be true as it is revealed he has been working as Rain Man for two years helping out the higher up ranking mafia bosses of Hong Kong, but his true motive was to eventually get enough evidence to expose them of their illegal doings to the police including other authorities such as the CIA and FBI and to the public media, which proved to be successful overpowering their abilities and it is assumed that the authorities came to arrest them or other international mafia bosses came after their lives. Tsz Kit is then able to leave the mafia business and then by fate, he and Ching Yan meet on a rainy night on the streets and they are reunited officially as a couple. It is assumed that Tsz Kit has reunited with his family, but this was never shown at the end of the series.

Boon had strong chemistry with the A Fist Within Four Walls cast. Halfway into filming the drama, he started working on The Unholy Alliance with his Four Walls cast in mind. The Unholy Alliance was officially announced in mid-August 2016. The Hong Kong media regarded it as a \\"modern\\" version of Boon's A Fist Within Four Walls, which was set in the 1960s. Four Walls leads Ruco Chan and Nancy Wu were the first cast members to be announced for The Unholy Alliance in August 2016. Paw Hee- ching, who was in negotiations with TVB since March 2016, was announced next. The Unholy Alliance is Paw's first TVB production. Lam Tsz-sin, Elaine Yiu, Joel Chan, Oscar Leung, and Bella Lam were confirmed to be part of the cast days later. Four Walls actors Grace Wong and Benjamin Yuen were invited to star, but declined the offer due to schedule clashes.

History  = Up to 21st century =  1957: ‚ÄúThe Granarolo‚Äù is launched  In 1957 the Bologna Consortium of Milk Producers (CBPL) was founded in Milan, with the aim of producing, processing and marketing milk, and it took the name \\"Granarolo\\" as its trademark for marketing its milk.  1970s: CERPL, the first Italian unitary consortium  In 1972 the Cooperativa Felsinea Latte joined the consortium, giving rise to the Consorzio Emiliano-Romagnolo Produttori Latte (CERPL) which was immediately joined by the Cooperativa Latte Estense of Ferrara, the Cooperativa Produttori Latte of Forl√¨, the Cooperativa of Ravenna and the Cooperativa of Rimini. Subsequently, the CERPL consortium acquired the Bolognaise ice cream manufacturer, Sanbon.  1980s: Granarolo grows  During the nineteen eighties, the Cooperativa Latte Estense of Ferrara and the Cooperativa Produttori Latte of Forl√¨ left the consortium while at the same time CERPL was joined by the Consorzio Granterre of Modena and the Consortium acquired Daunia Natura of Foggia, Sogecla of Anzio, and the Cooperativa Latte Verbano of Novara (the latter went bankrupt in 1992).  1990s: the Granlatte Consortium and Granarolo S.p.A.  Under the guidance of Luciano Sita, who was appointed President in 1991, in 1992 the Group launched the Granarolo Felsinea S.p.A. Company and acquired Dilat S.p.A. in Soliera. Acquisitions during the nineteen nineties involved the following companies: Latte San Giorgio of Locate di Triulzi (MI) in 1994, Interpack S.r.l. of Gualtieri (Reggio Emilia), Fiore S.r.l. of Udine, Sail S.p.A. of Bari (operating in Puglia under the 'Perla' brand) and Latte Cerulli of Teramo. In 1998 the consortium that controlled the Granarolo Felsinea S.p.A. took the name Granlatte and the next year, Granarolo Felsinea changed its name to Granarolo S.p.A.. = Last years =  2000-2010: the acquisition campaign continues  In 2000 Granarolo completed further acquisitions: Centrale del Latte di Milano, Vogliazzi Specialit√† Gastronomiche of Vercelli, Centrale del Latte di Viterbo \\"Alto Lazio\\", half the capital in Centrale del Latte di Calabria S.p.A. and Latte Bianchi in Mogliano Veneto (Treviso). Also, in 2004 it acquired the Yomo Group to save it from bankruptcy, and with it came the Yomo, Torre in Pietra (excluding milk), Mandriot, Pettinicchio and Merlo brands, and the factories in Pasturago (Yomo), Sermoneta (Pettinicchio) and Acqui Terme (Merlo). The ex Yomo Group also included the CSL - Centro Sperimentale del Latte [Milk Experimentation Centre], tasked with producing probiotics for alimentary and pharmaceutical use (sold to the Sacco Group in 2013). During 2006 the \\"historical\\" Centrale del Latte factory in Milan closed, because it was not included in the acquisition. Its production was transferred to what was previously the Yomo plant in Pasturago. In 2008 the Group was reorganised, which lead to the closure of the subsidiary Agriok S.p.A. (which operated in the chain traceability sector), and the gastronomic branch of the Company (Vogliazzi) was sold off, as was the Sermoneta cheese factory (whereas the Pettinicchio brand was retained), and the plant in Acqui Terme (selling the Merlo brand). In 2010 the Group set up Zeroquattro S.r.l., an integrated logistics services Company with a specific, albeit not exclusive, vocation for transporting and distributing fresh food products, via a refrigerated chain at 0 ¬∞C to 4 ¬∞C. On the social commitment front, Granarolo was one of the promoters, along with CEFA Onlus, of the Africa Milk Project, an international self-development cooperation project, set up to create a milk sector in Njombe, one of the poorest parts of Tanzania.  2011-2014: from internationalisation to the first billion  In 2011 Granarolo unveiled its strategic internationalisation plan, based on four main pillars: dimensional growth, and diversification of products, markets, and countries. In line with this foreign development, Granarolo Iberica S.L. was set up for distributing food products in Spain, and the Italian Lat Bri cheese factories were acquired, the third largest fresh cheeses manufacturer in Italy, as well as Ferruccio Podda, a Sardinian Company with a 60-year history, which marked the addition of aged cheeses to the Group's range. Granarolo International S.r.l. was set up and its first operation was in France with the acquisition of the French cheese group, CIPF Codipal (now Granarolo France S.A.S.) that produces and distributes fresh and aged cheeses under the Casa Azzurra, Les Fromagers de Ste Colombe and Les Fromagers de St Omer brands, with two productive facilities. Subsequent operations abroad saw the opening of Granarolo UK, a cheese exporting company in the United Kingdom and Ireland, as well as of the first commercial branch in Shanghai, China. A partnership was also formed with the Vivartia Group, which includes the largest Greek manufacturer of dairy and cheese products, Delta Foods S.A., and that distributes Greek yoghurt and cheeses in Italy. Meanwhile, in Italy a partnership was sealed with Amalattea S.p.A., which manufactures and markets goat's cheese and derivatives, the Pinzani cheese factory in Tuscany was acquired, which specialises in making pecorino ‚Äúa latte crudo‚Äù (made from raw milk), and the Centrale del Gusto S.r.l. was inaugurated, a confectioners, ice cream parlour and coffee shop in Bologna, in collaboration with Gino Fabbri, President of the Accademia Maestri Pasticceri Italiani [Academy of Italian Master Confectioners]. CSR's activities gave rise to Allattami, a Bank for Donated Mothers' Milk in Bologna. This project collects mothers' milk in collaboration with the Sant'Orsola Polyclinic of Bologna. The 2014 financial year closed with turnover of more than a billion Euro.  2015‚Äìpresent: Expo and new acquisitions  At Expo Milano 2015, Granarolo represented the Italian milk sector as a partner of the Italian Pavilion. It recorded more than 510,000 visitors from more than 30 countries, and Africa Milk Project was chosen as the best of 800 projects worldwide, for Best Practice in the \\"Sustainable development of small rural communities in marginal areas\\" category. Various acquisition operations are part of the product diversification strategy, aimed at enhancing the Group's presence on international markets: Gennari S.p.A., a company in Parma that specialises in making Parmigiano Reggiano and Prosciutto di Parma, the long-standing Pastificio Granarolo, that makes and markets egg and semolina pasta, and CONBIO, an important Italian company that specialises in making vegetable and organic gastronomic products. Abroad, via the subsidiary, Granarolo International S.r.l., Granarolo Chile was set up, and Bioleche Lacteos was acquired, a long-standing Chilean cooperative of 300 dairy farmers, with a productive facility, and numerous other acquisitions were concluded: European Foods Ltd, the leading importer and distributor of Made in Italy products in New Zealand, Yema Distribuidora de Alimentos Ltda, a company that specialises in producing and marketing cheese products in Brazil, with two productive facilities, and Vinaio O√ú, renamed Granarolo Baltics O√ú, a company that operates in the cheese and dairy products marketing sector and in importing quality Italian products into Estonia. Then there was, Matric Italgross AB, a leading Swedish company that distributes Italian brands, Comarsa SA, a Made in Italy Food distribution company in Switzerland, Allfood Importa√ß√£o, Ind√πstria e Com√©rcio SA Brazil, the leading importer and distributor of European products in Brazil, and 50% of Quality Brands International Greece, a leading Greek distributor. In 2017, Granarolo's sixtieth anniversary, the company recorded a turnover of 1.27 billion euro, representing an increase of 7.8%. EBITDA fell by 13% to 70.1 million, while profits also decreased from 22.6 million in 2016 to 10.1 million in 2017. In terms of percentage, revenues from exports grew from 17% to 20%, revenues from Italy fell from 77% to 72% while revenues from Extra EU countries rose from 6% to 8%. In February 2018 the company acquired Midland Food Group, with central offices in London and two distribution centres in Basingstoke and Birmingham, with production facilities in the latter. The company was founded forty years ago by Peter Shirley, records revenues of 70 million euro and employs 224 employees. Granarolo now boasts two large hubs in Europe, one in France (the company's second market after Italy with revenues of over 150 million) and one in the United Kingdom, which is expected to become the third market of the company. In April 2019 in Friuli, a controlling interest was acquired in Venchiaredo, a stracchino cheese production specialist with 80 employees and turnover of almost EUR 27 million. This made Granarolo one the largest Italian producers of stracchino. Company structure The Granarolo Group is made up of: Granlatte Consortium is a cooperative company, a member of Legacoop and Confcooperative, and a holding of the Granarolo Group. The cooperative includes 557 individual affiliated producers and 3 collection cooperatives, operating across 77 farms in 12 regions of Italy: Emilia-Romagna, Piedmont, Lombardy, Veneto, Marche, Puglia, Lazio, Campania, Basilicata, Friuli, Molise and Calabria (updated at 31/12/2018).

EU/ME is a EURO Working Group, officially sanctioned and financially supported by EURO, the Association of European Operational Research Societies.  History  The Group was founded (under the name EU/ME ‚Äì EUropean chapter on MEtaheuristics) in 2000 by Marc Sevaux, Kenneth S√∂rensen and Christelle Wynants, following the 2000 EURO Winter Institute on metaheuristics for combinatorial optimization held in Lac Noir, Switzerland.Hertz, Alain, and Marino Widmer. \\"Guidelines for the use of meta- heuristics in combinatorial optimization.\\" European Journal of Operational Research 151.2 (2003): 247‚Äì252. In 2001, the group received its status as official EURO working group. In that same year, the EU/ME website (the main tool for communication among EU/ME members) was created. In 2010, the name was changed to EU/ME ‚Äì the metaheuristics community. The name was changed again (to EWG EU/ME ‚Äì EURO Working Group on Metaheuristics) in 2015 following a decision of EURO to harmonize the names of its working groups. EURO, the umbrella association to which EURO belongs The number of EU/ME members has been steadily increasing, from about 500 in 2001, and 1000 in 2004 to about 1860 now. In 2014, a special section on Variable Neighborhood Search was created.  Governance  The group is managed by 3 Coordinators and an Advisory Board of 3 members. The current coordinators are Andreas Reinholz, Marc Sevaux and Kenneth S√∂rensen. The special section on Variable Neighborhood Search has its own board (currently Abraham Duarte and Nenad Mladenovic).  Membership  Membership of EU/ME is free and open to anyone interested in metaheuristic optimization, either in the development of metaheuristics or in the use of metaheuristics to solve optimization problems. Membership of EU/ME consists largely of academic researchers, but the group has a limited number of industrial members from companies such as IBM, Thales Group, France Telecom, and Bombardier Inc. Currently (2016), the group has about 1,865 members from 85 countries. Members of EU/ME include many notable authorities in the field of metaheuristics, such as Fred W. Glover (a supporting member since 2000), and many others. In terms of membership, EU/ME is the largest platform for researchers on metaheuristics and also the largest EURO working group. Many researchers in the group are active in the field of multi- objective optimization.Coello, Carlos A. Coello, Gary B. Lamont, and David A. Van Veldhuizen.

More than 100 people were arrested in seven countries as a result of the plot. Organised by the Algerian Armed Islamic Group (GIA) and backed by al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden, the plot is thought to have targeted the England‚ÄìTunisia match on 15 June 1998, and involved infiltrating the Stade V√©lodrome in Marseille in order to attack players and spectators during the game, attack the hotel in Paris hosting the United States national team, and finally hijacking an aircraft and crashing it into the Civaux Nuclear Power Plant near Poitiers. Raids and arrests The original suspect of the plot was French-Algerian Farid Melouk, who had previously been sentenced in absentia to seven years in prison in France for his connection to the 1995 Paris M√©tro and RER bombings. Melouk had reportedly been tracked by intelligence services following his entry into Belgium, where he was found to be in contact with Ahmed Zaoui and a GIA-linked Brussels mosque.Robinson, 2002, p. 172 On 3 March, after two weeks of surveillance, fifty police officers stormed a house where Melouk was staying with others involved in the plot.Robinson, 2002, p. 173 Ten people including Swedish and Danish nationals were arrested in the 12-hour siege, amid a series of anti- terrorism raids in Belgium. Large amounts of liquid explosives were found during the raid, as well as detonators, a Kalashnikov rifle, several handguns and thousands worth of US dollars in cash. In addition, a large number of documents, brochures and maps relating to the World Cup were retrieved. More explosives were uncovered in a follow-up raid of another house. The March raid was part of a joint security operation between Belgium, France, Sweden, Italy and the United Kingdom. Despite initial Belgian claims denying links to any plot against the World Cup, the plot was later confirmed by the French counter-intelligence chief. Melouk was sentenced to 9 years in prison for charges including attempted murder. In early May, eight suspected militants linked to the plot were arrested in the United Kingdom.Robinson, 2002, p. 180 On 26 May, nearly 100 people were detained in coordinated operations across France, Belgium, Italy, Switzerland and Germany. In France, 53 men including Algerian, French and Tunisian nationals suspected of links to ex-GIA commander Hassan Hattab were detained across 43 locations, including in Marseilles, Paris, Lyon and Corsica; around 25 were arrested and charged or deported.Robinson, 2002, pp. 190‚Äì191 Five Algerians were arrested in Germany after raids across several cities, ten in Belgium, two in Switzerland, six in Italy, and many more detained.Robinson, 2002, pp. 188‚Äì189 French Interior Minister Jean-Pierre Chev√®nement said on French television after the arrests that investigators had found evidence of plots to attack the World Cup. Islamist paraphernalia and $150,000 in cash were found during the raids, but no explosives or arms. Some police sources have said that a goal of the May raids was to crush GIA support networks. According to counter-terrorism magistrate Jean-Louis Brugui√®re, the May raids were a preventive measure to protect the tournament. Plot and aftermath The plot involved terrorists infiltrating the Stade V√©lodrome in Marseille as stadium crew, in order to attack English players and spectators during the England-Tunisia match on 15 June. Terrorists had reportedly planned to blow up the England substitute bench (targeting youngsters David Beckham and Michael Owen), shoot English players and throw grenades into the stands. Other terrorists were then to storm the United States national team's hotel in Paris and attack American players watching the game there. The attacks would be followed by another group of terrorists who would hijack an aircraft and crash it into the Civaux Nuclear Power Plant near Poitiers, causing a nuclear meltdown. The details or even existence of the plot was kept secret from managers, players and the media, but was known to security including FA staff. In 2009, England manager in 1998 Glenn Hoddle revealed that he had only been informed of the plot \\"years later\\", while FA Director of Communications during 1998 David Davies said that he had been informed of the plot before the match by FA Head of Security Brian Hayes. The match was otherwise marred by supporter riots in Marseilles, with British vehicles being bricked while bottles were thrown across the streets, causing police to use tear gas as large numbers of supporters were injured and arrested. Although organised by GIA operatives, the plot reportedly had the backing and support of al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden. According to bin Laden biographer Yossef Bodansky, the World Cup plot being foiled was one of the reasons for \\"dormant terrorist networks\\" responsible for the August 1998 United States embassy bombings being \\"reactivated\\". A terror plot against the UEFA Euro 2000 was discovered after Dutch intelligence intercepted calls made between GIA operatives from inside French prisons. Three men were detained in French prisons as a result of the plot, and three were subsequently arrested in the Netherlands. One of the French prisoners detained for the plot was Adel Mechat, who served 6 years after having been arrested in Germany and extradited to France as part of the 1998 World Cup raids. The night before the first ever football match between France and Algeria in October 2001, police seized explosives and arrested four Islamist militants suspected of having targeted the game after a phone call had been intercepted with warnings to stay away from the Stade de France. Other items retrieved included bulletproof vests and explosives manuals. The match itself became marred with controversy, and was eventually stopped with 15 minutes left playing after Algerian fans stormed the field.

The installation was part of the 2009 Sydney Laneway Temporary art scheme, afterwards, due to the popularity of the installation, in 2011, the project was turned into a part of the 9 million dollar permanent laneway installations. The Laneway temporary art program ran between 2008 and 2013 with the main goal of laneways activation, innovation stimulation in the city and, in general, injecting new energy into the urban life. The program consisted of two stages. Forgotten Songs artwork was a part of the second Laneways program titled By George! Hidden Networks. The principal aim was to address two key issues of urban renewal in city's lanes and climate change. Other than Forgotten Songs installation, seven other artworks participated in this stage.  Artwork concept  right The artwork concept could be comprehended by the artist's words: \\"The installation explores how Sydney‚Äôs fauna has evolved and adapted to co-exist with increased urbanisation ‚Äì inviting contemplation of the city‚Äôs past, its underlying landscape, and the sustainability issues associated with increased urban development.\\" = Title = As a result, the artwork's title was selected to celebrate those birds which were living in central Sydney \\"before they were gradually forced out of the city by European settlement\\". The artist's intention was to return the birds' sounds to the city and make them an important part of city life.  Installation  = Birdcages = The artist has used 120 suspended bird cages in the laneway above the Angel Place accompanied by the sound recordings of extinct or threatened bird species of the central Sydney. = Bird songs = Recordings are played of the songs of fifty bird species which used to live in the central Sydney area on two audio tracks - day birds and night birds - with \\"a calendared sequence of triggers that progressively allows for longer days in summer and longer nights in winter\\". Some of these birds songs can still be heard on the city margins but not in central Sydney. Based on investigations of doctor Richard Major in regards to the city soil types and examining Australian Museum collection of bird skins, a list of 50 species of both diurnal and nocturnal birds was provided. Consequently, the sound files of those 50 species were gathered by the wildlife recordist, Fred van Gessel.  Practical development of the project  In terms of the practical aspect of the project, about 120 birdcages sources from various places, from eBay to second-hand stores. And the artist claims that in order to get all those birdcages, his mother, sister and his relatives have been involved in collecting and picking those cages. Sound installations have been done by putting all-weather speakers in some of the birdcages, which they continually play birdsongs.  Birds species  In addition to hearing the fifty birds' songs as you walk on the Angel Place, names of these fifty bird species can be read as well, since they have been installed into the ground as the part of the installation. The following list represents the bird species which sang in central Sydney. Some of these songs still can be heard in city margins, if these birds can find food to survive. # Barn owl # Brown gerygone # Brown thornbill # Brown-headed honeyeater # Brush cuckoo # Dollarbird # Dusky woodswallow # Eastern spinebill # Eastern whipbird # Eastern yellow robin # Fan-tailed cuckoo # Australian golden whistler # Grey fantail # Grey shrikethrush # Jacky winter # Leaden flycatcher # Little lorikeet # Mistletoebird # Owlet-nightjar # Pallid cuckoo # Powerful owl # Red-browed finch # Regent honeyeater # Rockwarbler # Rufous whistler # Scarlet Honeyeater # Scarlet robin # Shining bronze cuckoo # Southern boobook # Southern emu-wren # Spotted pardalote # Spotted quail-thrush # Striated thornbill # Superb fairywren # Superb lyrebird # Tawny frogmouth # Tawny-crowned honeyeater # Varied sittella # Variegated fairywren # Whistling kite # White-throated gerygone # White-browed scrubwren # White-browed woodswallow # White-eared honeyeater # White-naped honeyeater # White-throated nightjar # White-throated treecreeper # Wonga Pigeon # Yellow-tufted honeyeater # Yellow-faced honeyeater Example of bird species name set into pavement under the art work Based on the bird species, some of them used to sing during the daytime, while some others during the nighttime. Therefore, song recordings change from day to night. At night, Powerful owl, Southern boobook, Tawny frogmouth, Barn owl, Owlet-nightjar and White-throated nightjar songs might be heard.

The most famous examples were the skyscrapers of New York, including the Empire State Building, Chrysler Building, and Rockefeller Center in New York City. It combined modern aesthetics, fine craftsmanship and expensive materials, and became the symbol of luxury and modernity. While rarely used in residences, it was frequently used for office buildings, government buildings, train stations, movie theaters, diners and department stores. It also was frequently used in furniture, and in the design of automobiles, ocean liners, and everyday objects such as toasters and radio sets. In the late 1930s, during the Great Depression, it featured prominently in the architecture of the immense public works projects sponsored by the Works Progress Administration and the Public Works Administration, such as the Golden Gate Bridge and Hoover Dam. The style competed throughout the period with the modernist architecture, and came to an abrupt end in 1939 with the beginning of World War II. The style was rediscovered in the 1960s, and many of the original buildings have been restored and are now historical landmarks.

As a result, the United States soon took the lead in building tall buildings. The first skyscrapers had been built in Chicago in the 1880s in the Beaux-Arts or neoclassical style. In the 1920s New York architects used the new Art Deco style to build the Chrysler Building and the Empire State Building. The Empire State building was the tallest building in the world for forty years. The decoration of the interior and exterior of the skyscrapers was classic Art Deco, with geometric shapes and zigzag patterns. The Chrysler Building, by William Van Alen (1928‚Äì30), updated the traditional gargoyles on Gothic Cathedrals with sculptures on the building corners in the shape of Chrysler radiator ornaments. Another major landmark of the style was the RCA Victor Building (now the General Electric Building), by John Walter Cross. It was covered from top to bottom with zig-zags and geometric patterns, and had a highly ornamental crown with geometric spires and lightning bolts of stone. The exterior featured bas-relief sculptures by Leo Friedlander and Lee Lawrie, and a mosaic by Barry Faulkner that required more than a million pieces of enamel and glass. While the skyscraper Art Deco style was mostly used for corporate office buildings, it also became popular for government buildings, since all city offices could be contained in one building on a minimal amount of land. The city halls of Los Angeles, California and Buffalo, New York were built in the style, as well as the new capital building of the State of Louisiana. =Movie theaters= Following the lead of the skyscrapers of New York City, smaller in scale but no less ambitious in design, Art Deco office buildings and department stores appeared in cities across the United States. They were rarely built by banks, which wanted to appear conservative, but were often built by retail chains, public utilities, automobile companies and technology companies, which wanted to express modernity and progress. Syracuse, New York is home to the Niagara Mohawk Building, in Syracuse, New York, completed in 1932. was originally the home of the nation's largest electricity supplier. The facade, by the firm of Bley and Lyman, was designed to express the power and modernity of electricity; it features a statue called \\"The Spirit of Light\\" 8.5 meters high, made of stainless steel, as the central element of the facade. The Guardian Building, originally the Union Trust Building, is a rare example of a bank or financial institution using Art Deco. Its interior decoration was so elaborate that it became known as the \\"Cathedral of Commerce\\". The San Francisco architect Timothy L. Pflueger best known for the Paramount Theatre in Oakland, California, was another proponent of lavish Art Deco interiors and facades on office buildings. The interior of his downtown San Francisco office building, 450 Sutter Street, opened in 1929, was entirely covered with hieroglyphic-like designs and ornament, resembling a giant tapestry. The Streamline style =Hotels, Resorts, and the Miami Beach Style= File:U-Drop Inn.jpgThe U-Drop Inn, a roadside gas station and diner on U.S. Highway 66 in Shamrock, Texas (1936) File:Modern diner.jpgThe Modern Diner in Pawtucket, Rhode Island (1940) is modeled after streamlined railroad car. Because of its high cost of construction, Art Deco was usually used only in large office buildings, government buildings and theaters, but it was sometimes used in smaller structures, such as diners and gas stations, particularly along highways. A notable example is the U-Drop Inn in Shamrock, Texas, located along U.S. Highway 66. It was built in 1936, and is now owned by the City of Shamrock, and is an historical landmark. In the late 1930s and early 1940s, a number of diners modeled after the cars of streamlined trains were produced, and appeared in different cities in the United States. In a few cases, real railroad cars were transformed into diners. A few survive, including the Modern Diner in Pawtucket, Rhode Island which is a registered landmark.

In the 1932 the Public Works of Art Project was created to give work to artists unemployed because the Great Depression. In a year, it commissioned more than fifteen thousand works of art. It was succeeded in 1935 by the Federal Arts Project of the Works Progress Administration, or WPA. prominent American artists were commissioned by the Federal Art Project to paint murals in government buildings, hospitals, airports, schools and universities. Some the America's most famous artists, including Grant Wood, Reginald Marsh, Georgia O'Keeffe and Maxine Albro took part in the program. The celebrated Mexican painter Diego Rivera also took part in the program, painting a mural. The paintings were in a variety of styles, including regionalism, social realism, and American scenic painting. A few murals were also commissioned for Art Deco skyscrapers, notably Rockefeller Center in New York. Two murals were commissioned for the lobby, one by John Steuart Curry and another by Diego Rivera. The owners of the building, the Rockefeller family, discovered that Rivera, a Communist, had slipped an image of Lenin into a crowd in the painting, and had it destroyed. The mural was replaced with another by the Spanish artist Jos√© Maria Sert. =Sculpture= The Art Deco style appeared early in the graphic arts, in the years just before World War I. It appeared in Paris in the posters and the costume designs of L√©on Bakst for the Ballets Russes, and in the catalogs of the fashion designers Paul Poiret. The illustrations of Georges Barbier, and Georges Lepape and the images in the fashion magazine La Gazette du bon ton perfectly captured the elegance and sensuality of the style. In the 1920s, the look changed; the fashions stressed were more casual, sportive and daring, with the woman models usually smoking cigarettes. American fashion magazines such as Vogue, Vanity Fair and Harper's Bazaar quickly picked up the new style and popularized it in the United States. It also influenced the work of American book illustrators such as Rockwell Kent. In the 1930s a new genre of posters appeared in the United States during the Great Depression. The Federal Art Project hired American artists to create posters to promote tourism and cultural events.

Probably built in the late 18th century, it is a rare example in the state of a stone blacksmith shop, with a documented history of more than century's use for the purpose. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1975. Description and history The Old Stone Blacksmith Shop stands in a rural area of Cornwall, on the west side of Vermont Route 30 about midway between its junctions with Ridge and Robbins Roads. It is a single-story structure, fashioned out of irregularly coursed limestone and covered by a gabled roof. The building corners are set in a quoined fashion with more regularly cut stone. It is set into a sharp rise, so its front is fully exposed, but its rear wall is almost completely below grade. The front facade has a horizontally rectangular window at the center, and a two-leaf bay door to its right, fastened with wrought iron strap hinges. The gable ends have sash windows, and the protruding portion of the rear wall has narrow casement windows. with The shop has traditionally been given an early construction date of 1791, the year Thomas Pritchard purchased the property. Its construction style is consistent with other stone buildings built in the region as late as 1845. Pritchard is known to have sold an extant blacksmith shop in 1805, but it is unclear if it was this building. Regardless of its construction date, it is the oldest example of this type of service building in the community.

The decision by the International Paralympic Committee to remove his classification form the Paralympic programme between 1998 and 2010 meant Rebisz had a gap of 16 years between winning medals at the 1996 Summer Paralympics in Atlanta and the 2012 Summer Paralympics in London. Athletics history Rebisz was always interested in sport but took up athletics seriously in 1992. He was selected for the Poland national team at the 1996 Summer Paralympics in Atlanta, entering the shot put, javelin and discus throw events in the F46 classification. He won medals in all three, silver in the discus and shot put and bronze in the javelin. He followed this with three more medals at the 1998 IPC Athletics World Championships in Birmingham, including gold in the shot put. The International Paralympic Committee then decided to remove all F46 throwing event from their Paralympic schedule, leaving Rebisz unable to compete at the highest level of his sport. In the run-up to the 2012 Summer Paralympics in London the IPC chose to reinstate the F46 classification to their programme. Rebisz felt cheated by the original decision to remove the T46 category and when discussing the reintroduction he stated that \\"I felt like someone had done it to annoy me,\\". He entered the 2011 IPC Athletics World Championships in Christchurch, competing in the shot and discus. He came sixth in the shot put, but won gold in the discus. At London, he entered the only event available to him, the shot put, as his favoured discus event was not contested in the F46. He recorded a season's best of 15.01 metres, which was enough to win Rebisz a bronze, his first Paralympic medal in 16 years. Personal history Rebisz was born in Koszalin, Poland in 1974.

The coating of components with PVC has many applications. Plastic dip moulding is a technique where metal parts are coated with a plastic vinyl material. It is used to protect and make the metal parts more resistant to scratches and abrasions.  Applications  The main applications are the gloves, balloons, bellows...  Materials  Plastisol is the most used material for dip moulding because it is easy to use and affordable. Other materials are used, such as latex, leneoprene, polyurethanes, silicones and even epoxy.  Operating Mode  The plastic can be heated or not according to their physical state at room temperature. In the case of a powder, the plastic is fluidized. The following steps constitute the dip moulding process: * mould heating; * heated mould dipped into the plastic material; * removal of the mould; * excess drainage; * drying or curing of the plastics material still attached to the mould if it contained a solvent or was based reagents (monomers, prepolymers) reagents; * cooling of the plastic still attached to the mould; * releasing of the part from the mold after its solidification. The part may need to be submerged several times to give the desired thickness.  Control of the thickness  To control the thickness of the workpiece, it is important to control the following settings: * the mould temperature: higher the temperature, higher the thickness of the workpiece. * the temperature of the material; * the speed dipping of the mould; * the duration of the immersion: this time increases the thickness of the workpiece. * the output speed of the mould: this speed increases the thickness of the workpiece.  Advantages and disadvantages  Dip moulding presents advantages and disadvantages. = Advantages = * low investment cost; * low cost of production; * different possible thicknesses without the need to change the mold; * complex parts can be removed easily from the mold thanks to their elasticity; = Disadvantages = * relatively slow process; * control of the thickness is difficult.

Needs citation for the exact date 24 August retrieved from Russian Wikipedia. was a Russian revolutionary sergeant and army commissar. He played an 'unsung but crucial role' in turning the tide of the February Revolution, in words of historian Orlando Figes. He was a sergeant in the Finland Regiment of St. Petersburg.Figes, p. 314 For his role in leading a demonstration against Milyukov he was sent as a commissar to the army on the front by the Soviet. Here he became well known for convincing revolutionary units to continue fighting. He was killed trying to convince a group of soldiers to return to combat near Lutsk in 1917, and was hailed as a 'fallen fighter of the people's cause', receiving a hero's funeral. Biography =Early life= List of students admitted to Petrischule from 1863 to 1912. From the archives of the Petrischule. Fedor's name is here written Friedrich. Fedor Linde was the son of a German chemist and a Polish peasant woman. His mother grew up in a small farm near St. Petersburg, and was an innkeeper; the inn was popular among the Russian revolutionaries of the capital when they tried to avoid the police. In socialising with the guests, the 'tall, blonde and handsome', described as a 'romantic idealist', became involved in the revolutionary underground. He enrolled in the Mathematics Faculty of St. Petersburg University in 1899, and immediately became a leading figure in the student protest movement. =Political involvement and exile= During the 1905 revolution, Linde worked with the Social Democrats in St. Petersburg, organising the students into an 'academic legion' to spread revolutionary propaganda to the working class. For this he was arrested and imprisoned in Kresty Prison, before he was forced to go into exile in Europe. =Return, First World War and mutinies= Linde was allowed to return during the Romanov Tercentenary in 1913, as part of the political amnesties given. At the eruption of hostilities in 1914, Linde was mobilised by the Finland Regiment. He was soon promoted to rank of sergeant on the basis of his courageous leadership.Figes, p. 315 During the 1917 February Revolution, several army unit mutinies took place in Petrograd. In all of these mutinies, junior officers, mostly hailing from the lower-class or wielding democratic sympathies, played the 'decisive role'. Figes notes that Linde was 'typical in this regard'. In a letter written in the spring of 1917, to Socialist Revolutionary Boris Sokolov explained how he managed to convince the 5,000 soldiers of the Preobrazhensky Regiment to join the mutiny: Lying on the couch of the barracks of the Preobrazhensky Regiment near the Tauride Palace reading a book by Haldane, he was alerted to the events going on outside when a stray bullet shot through the window. Absorbed by the book, he didn't notice the shooting and yelling in the streets, but now quickly noticed how Cossack troops were attacking unarmed citizens. When he saw a young girl try to evade a Cossack horse, the girl being to slow, and subsequently being struck down and landed under the horse's feet, her 'penetrating inhuman scream' made something in him 'snap.' He now rallied his fellow soldiers standing on a table. Following him, not knowing to where or for what cause they followed him, they joined him in an attack on the police and Cossacks. Linde and his regiment killed some, with the rest retreating. He led a group of soldiers from the Preobrazhensky and Lithuanian Regiments, to the Finland Regiment to bring out his own soldiers. He later that night returned to his book by Haldane. Officers and soldiers like Linde provided what Figes calls 'the first signs of real organisation' to the revolution. Linde with his men commanded a lorry, which bore a large banner reading 'The First Revolutionary Flying Squad'.Figes, p. 316 During the Revolution, Linde took up command of the guard post at the gate of the Tauride Palace, having been elected by the Finland regiment to represent it in the Soviet council.Figes, p. 327 Soldiers and officers like Linde were displayed with portraits in shop windows in the wake of the Revolution for their part in the events, but, according to Figes, have since 'remained hidden from history books'.Figes, p. 318 An outraged Linde saw the Milyukov Note as a betrayal to the revolution's promise to end the World War. He led a battalion of Finland Regiment in April in an armed demonstration to the Marinsky Palace, in the expectation that the Soviet would establish Soviet power and demand the arrest of the government. By the time they had arrived at Marinsky, his regimental detachment had been accompanied by angry soldiers from Moscow and Pavlov regiments, swelling to 25,000 men. Linde's 'show of power' was not planned, but improvised, but he was convinced that the Soviet Executive would approve of his actions. The Executive however passed a resolution in which they condemned Linde's actions, saying that the Soviet was not ready to assume power but should rather help the Provisional Government reassert its authority.Figes, p. 381‚Äì2 Linde was denounced in the right-wing press a 'Bolshevik' in the wake of the events, depicting his demonstration as a bloody coup attempt (although it had dissolved itself peacefully after ordered so by the soviet).Figes, p. 382 As a punishment for his role in the demonstration against Milyukov, the Soviet sent Linde as a commissar to the Special Army on the front, where his leadership skills were to be used for the coming offensive;Figes, p. 413 & 439 he was satisfied with his new task.Figes, p. 439 He became 'something of a legend' for his trips to the most Bolshevized parts of the front, where he managed to convince them to continue to fight, and was something of a 'model commissar'. Death At the time, it was generally believed that 'Linde's own naive idealism' was 'to blame for his brutal murder.'Figes, p. 438 On his arrival to the front, the commissar had been warned of the large danger that groups of deserters could pose. One of the bands of deserters, the 443rd, 444th of the 3rd Infantry Division, had been terrorising the area surrounding Lutsk, and it was believed that the 500 Cossacks brought by General Krasnov should be employed to crack down on their camp. Linde, however, believed in the power of the 'revolutionary word', insisting that the old ally of the Tsarist regime should not be deployed against the 'freest army in the world'. He insisted that he was going to make them listen to sense, emphasising it was 'all a question of psychology'. Unswayed by the others' arguments, he was allowed to attempt to convince the soldiers.Figes, p. 438‚Äì439 Linde approached the camp consisting of approximately 5,000 deserters alone, with a group of officers following him some distance behind, and with mounted Cossacks riding to surround the camp. The soldiers, seeing the Commissar approach, arose from the ground and prepared their rifles. Linde, noticing two groups (one large, and one small, compact), addressed the smaller one which he realised contained the most 'Bolshevized' troops, on the basis of their hardened looks. He jumped onto a pile of logs and began speaking: 'I, who brought the soldiers out to overthrow the tsarist government and to give you freedom, a freedom which is equalled by no other people in the world, demand that you now give me those who have been telling you not to obey the orders of the commanders', calling on the soldiers to defend the 'Fatherland', pointing in the direction of the sounds of the enemy artillery. Linde, noticing his words had no effect, began to harangue the soldiers, dubbing them 'bastards' and 'lazy swine', undeserving of freedom. The agitated soldiers from the smaller Bolshevik group began heckling Linde, calling him a German spy and saying his methods were 'worthy of the old regime'. General Krasnov, spectating from a distance, realised the severity of the situation and sent in a car to rescue Linde. Linde however refused to leave. Only when the soldiers began moving towards him did he attempt to escape. Before he could escape however, he was struck down by a large soldier who struck the butt of his rifle into Linde's temple, with a second one 'shooting him to the ground'. A large crowd of soldiers 'shrieking' threw themselves onto the incapacitated Linde, stabbing him with their bayonets. Krasnov and the others attempted to escape, but the soldiers gave chase, while the Cossack troops struggled to gain control. A Colonel Girshfeldt was stripped naked and tortured before he was killed, and two other officers were also killed before the convoy managed to escape.Figes, p. 440 Linde's body was brought back to Petrograd and received a hero's funeral. The free, democratic press labelled him a 'fallen fighter of the people's cause', and lauded him as a brilliant example of the 'patriotic revolutionary' which the Russian army sorely needed.

The attachment behaviour of a goat. Despite their reputation for being slightly rebellious, goats are sometimes kept as pets because of their ability to form close bonds with their owners. Goats are herd animals by nature and typically prefer the company of other goats, but because of their herd mentality, they will follow their owner and form close bonds with them, hence their continuing popularity. Ideally, one requires a minimum or more for every goat. Although goats are relatively hardy animals, domestic goats benefit from being provided with shelter from wind and rain. Regular feeding is essential, as is the provision of clean water. Hay is a necessary food source and a manger keeps it off the ground where they might urinate and defecate upon it. Providing a salt lick is also a wise adjunct so as to provide them with essential minerals. Being cloven-hoofed animals, they also need their feet to be examined from time to time and to be trimmed if necessary, since some breeds evolved in areas where hard rocky surfaces continually wear down their hoofs, whereas on soft land pasture their hoofs may overgrow. Such overgrowth can lead to problems requiring veterinary visits. Another important consideration is to ensure that their enclosure has robust fencing, as goats rub up against things in order to scratch themselves and can destroy bad-quality fencing, only to then escape through the small gaps that they create. Goats are carriers for several diseases that can pass to humans such as Leptospirosis, Q fever, For owners who can provide all of these basic essentials, goats can be become very rewarding pets and companions.  Breed Outline  Regular Name: Goat Scientific Name: C. aegagrus Size: The size of the goat really depends on the breed. Smaller goats can weigh between 45 and 60 pounds, while a larger one like a Boer breed buck can weigh as much as 300 pounds. Life Expectancy: Goats can live 15 to 18 years in captivity, however, some can live much longer. Difficulty of Care: Advanced. Goats are social animals so they are considered herd animals. Never keep just one goat as they depend on one another for their own safety; they need at least one partner.  Feeding a Goat  Goats are more like deer when it comes to nutrition than they are to sheep or cattle, which eat a lot of grass. Goats should actually not have a diet of only eating fresh grass. To keep a goat happy and healthy, they must be fed a wide range of nutrients that have different sources and minerals. These can include things like: hay, chaffhaye, grain feed or pelleted grain mix, loose minerals, and sometimes even kitchen and garden scraps (in moderation).  Behavior and Temperament  Goats are naturally a herd animal and require to live at least with one or more of their kind as they are very social animals. Because they are considered 'social' animals this means that goats like to be petted by humans. Good environments for goats include rural areas, farms, or homes with acreage because sufficient space (such as a yard or pasture) is necessary for their comfort and well-being. All of this depends on the breed and the number of goats housed in one area. If you reside in a city, bylaws can keep you from housing goats as they are considered an agricultural species. Just like any other pet, you must be prepared for a long-term commitment to having goats. Pet goats tend to enjoy attention, being petted by their owners, and will even eat out of your hand. Goats can, in general, get along with most other livestock, although this varies between individuals. Goats have been known to accidentally trample small poultry such as turkeys and geese, so perches where these birds can roost out of reach of the goats is essential in avoiding such incidents. Some larger livestock like donkeys can be aggressive towards goats if they're not acclimated to them, or if the individuals have aggressive temperaments. Male goats tend to be more dominant according to age, when they reach the age of six years old their strength and dominance can decline. The horns and body size are just as important as their age when determining a dominant goat. Goats tend to display their dominance by lowering their head and pointing their horns at the subordinate animal. Animals tend to test their dominance by locking horns repeatedly until one of them wins. When they are in season, the male goat will mate with the females and he also protects the herd from any predators. The dominant male goat tends to keep his position until he dies or until he is challenged and defeated by another buck.

The project was simulated the visionary system by how it starts to convert the signals to image(actually the edges and colors) and then recognizing the shapes to find a relation between brain's information and image. The Objective Visionary system actually is concentrating on the separable sections, this separation gives the application visionary system the excellence processing result, because with this method the system do not waste much time on processing non significant sections and signals. this operation in the Objective Vision project called objective processing and because the O.V. mission is focused on human visionary simulation, so the developer refers with Objective Vision.

The gate was built in the 11th century AD over the foundations of a gate from Roman times (probably from the 2nd century AD). Hisar Kapia is one of the three entrances (Eastern, Northern and Southern) to the acropolis of ancient Plovdiv. During the rule of the Ottoman empire revival houses were embedded in the remains of the old stone walls around the gate.Strandel, Leslie/Patrick Erdley (2012): \\"Bulgaria (Other Places Travel Guide)\\", 234  History The arch and the construction technique The first gate on this place was built in the 2nd century AD. In the 6th century during the rule of Justinian the fortification system of the ancient town was expanded and the gate was strengthened. Archeologist suggest that only the foundations of the ancient Roman gate were preserved. The current structure of Hisar Kapia was formed in the Middle ages (13th - 14th century AD). A construction technique typical from the Second Bulgarian Empire is visible over the arch: a masonry of stones and brick pieces, filled with white mortar. The importance of the gate faded after the Ottoman invasion in the 14th century. In the 17th and 18th century the rich merchants of Plovdiv built their houses over the ruins of the fortification walls around Hisar Kapia. Today, the lower levels of those houses represent the remains of the ancient walls. Hisar Kapia was reinforced in the beginning of the 20th century due to its poor condition.Kay, Annie (2008): \\"Bulgaria.

Education and career  Fosha was born in Bucharest, but her family emigrated to the United States when she was 12 years old, settling in New York. She studied psychology at Barnard College and then went on to complete a doctorate in clinical psychology at the City College of New York. She also undertook post-doctoral training with Habib Davanloo, the developer of a form of psychodynamic psychotherapy called intensive short-term dynamic psychotherapy. In her early career Fosha held teaching positions at the City University of New York and Adelphi University. She was also an adjunct professor of psychiatry at Bellevue Hospital, and was on the faculty of New York University and the St. Luke's‚ÄìRoosevelt Hospital Center.  Accelerated experiential dynamic psychotherapy  Fosha developed a theory and technique of psychotherapy, AEDP, based upon several conceptual premises as points of departure from the prevailing psychodynamic psychotherapies. Her theory of how healing occurs in psychotherapy derives from her interpretation of research findings in several areas: the neuroscience of attachment, caregiver‚Äìinfant interaction research, positive psychology, emotion research, psychotherapy research findings on therapist qualities associated with positive therapy outcomes, and phenomenology of the psychological experience of sudden change. Her core premise is that the desire to heal and grow is a wired-in capacity, which she calls the transformance drive, and that healing change must derive from this innate resiliency. Emotional healing and brain re-wiring occur as the patient forms a new experience of a secure attachment relationship to the therapist, and the therapist helps the patient to experience emotions that, in the past, have been too overwhelming. Healing is accelerated through a tracking of emerging affect, so the patient can have a complete emotional experience, and then reflect upon the experience of healing change itself, with the help of the therapist,. Fosha terms this technique meta-therapeutic processing. This repeated and prolonged amplification of the experience of change has been called one of AEDP's \\"unique\\" contributions to the psychotherapy literature. The AEDP Institute was formed in New York City in 2004. The institute has satellite institutes throughout the US, and in Brazil, Canada, France, Italy, Sweden, Israel, China, and Japan.

Feminism in South Africa concerns the organised efforts to improve the rights of the girls and women of South Africa. These efforts are largely linked to issues of feminism and gender equality on one hand, and racial equality and the political freedoms of African and other non-White South African ethinic groups on the other. Early feminist efforts concerned the sufferage of White women, allowing them to vote in elections beginning from 1930s, and significant activism in the 1950s to demand equal pay of men and women. The 1980s were a major turning point in the advancement of South African women, and in 1994, following the end of the apartheid regime, the status of women was bolstered by changes to the country's constitution. Since the end of apartheid, South African feminism is a contribution associated with the liberation and democratization of the country, however, the movement still struggles with the embedded conservative and patriarchal views within some segments of South African society. History =Overview= Feminism in South Africa has been shaped by struggles for political and racial equality, as well as by national and transnational struggles for gender equality.Buiten, Denise. \\"Feminism in South Africa.\\" The Wiley Blackwell Encyclopedia of Gender and Sexuality Studies. Woman in South Africa have historically faced a myriad of state-facilitated and socially-practiced discrimination including pay discrimination. One example was the inability for all women to vote until 1983 and cultural sexism manifesting through severe violence against women. South Africa has high rates of rape and domestic violence which frequently goes unreported. Nearly one third of adolescent girls report being sexually coerced by men by the time they turn 16. This statistic lead to matriculating into high rates of sexual harassment, and assault experienced by women. As a response to these issues, and out of desperation for change in a politically unstable time in the 1980s, feminism in South Africa began to gain traction as women became more politically active. Specifically, feminism in South Africa gained new life in 1994 when the constitution was being rewritten to cater to a post-apartheid, democratic society. During this phase of reconstruction, women unified and lobbied for a more equitable positioning of women within the constitutional framework. Women benefited from the democratization of South Africa as women were the ones most significantly impacted and oppressed by the male dominated, state repression. It was the initial unification and women's rights movement during the negotiations of the constitution that spurred other activism related to women's rights and social circumstances. These progressive women led movements were later labeled one of the first examples of modern South African feminism. The 1990s South African feminist movement was also propelled forward by the momentum of other noteworthy women's rights movements in neighboring African countries. Countries such as Zimbabwe and Mozambique served as inspiration as women in both countries successfully organized themselves and lobbied to make the needs of women a concern of the state. Through the country's transition to multi-racial democracy in the mid-1990s, South African feminism contributed to the process of reconstruction, striving for a non-racist, non-sexist society. However, feminist activism and radical transformational politics were largely diluted in the process. Contemporary South African feminism continues to engage with questions of the role of feminism within broader national and international struggles for class and racial equality. South African feminism aligns with the agenda of global feminism as a continuous project designed to deconstruct and challenge the dualities and binaries between men and women in the eyes of society and the state. Feminism in South Africa is rooted in distinctly different epistemologies and beliefs of women and women's work than the beliefs that ground other modern inequitable social structures, such as worker's compensation. International feminist theory asserts that exclusive dualities between men and women serve as the groundings on which discriminatory laws and practices lie. Modern South African feminists aim to deconstruct these dualities by politicizing the lives of women and demanding gender equality laws. =Women's suffrage and civic engagement= In South Africa, adult white women were given the right to vote in 1930. The first general election at which women could vote was the 1933 election. Due to the patriarchal structure embedded in South Africa's cultural norms and governing bodies, women have faced adversity in the fight for equality, particularly women of color who, because of the unique racial history of the country, have faced even greater disadvantages due to apartheid. Asian and women of color in South Africa gained suffrage in 1983, more than five decades after suffrage was granted to white women . In 1933, Leila Wright, wife of Deneys Reitz, was elected as the first female Member of Parliament. On May 2, 1990 the African National Congress released a statement titled \\"The Statement of the National Executive Committee of the African National Congress on the Emancipation of Women in South Africa\\", which was the first national acknowledgment of the need for gender equity in order to advance a truly democratic nation. The statement also recognized that there was a striking imbalance of women in government positions, and that is detrimental as women's perspectives and issues are often overlooked. The document initially received high praise from feminists in the South Africa, but in later years women criticized the congress for not taking action to rectify the issues outlined in the statement. However, since 1990 women have gained more positions of power within government as today South Africa is ranked among the top five African countries that have high representation of women in the national legislature.Bauer, Gretchen, and Hannah Evelyn Britton, eds. Women in African parliaments. Boulder, CO: Lynne Rienner Publishers, 2006. This improvement is largely due to mandatory quotas now required by political parties in South Africa to ensure minimum female representation in government positions. =Equal pay= Due to a pay structure based on nuclear family ideals based in society, men were previously assumed to be the primary income for a home and all wages women made were supplementary to the family's income. The nuclear family structure is becoming less common among South African families as more women & men opt out of marriage and divorce rates rise, leaving single income homes. Although it is illegal in South Africa to pay either gender more or less for the same work per hour or per annum, women are choosing career fields that are devalued in compensation, leaving a general pay gap between men and women. Equal pay in South Africa has already, by law, been realised. Women in high-earning fields on average work less hours than their male counterparts due to having children and assigning more time to motherly responsibilities. This pay gap is entirely by choice, and women do now and have been dominating certain STEM fields such as Biology, Botany & Statistics for decades. In 2017, the World Economic Forum estimated that the estimated earned income (Purchasing Power Parity) in South Africa for women was US$9,938 while for men it was US$16,635. In South Africa, the proportion of unpaid work, also known as parental or adult responsibilities per day is 56.1 for women and 25.9 for men. =Anti- discrimination laws= On August 9, 1956, 20,000 women held a protest march at the Union Buildings in Pretoria to protest against passes for women. The march was organised under the banner of the Federation of South African Women (FSAW). This day later became known as National Women's Day in South Africa. The Matrimonial Property Act 88 was passed November 1, 1984 and overruled the economic, social, legal and property and subordination of White, Indian and colored married women to their male spouses. Prior to this act women were seen as legal minors in the eyes of the law once married, which stripped them of any legal protections or individual social liberties and outlined that all economic or property assets be passed through male lineage. On December 2, 1988 the Act was amended to also protect African women in civil unions. After the country's first democratic elections in 1994, many discriminatory statutes in South Africa were scrapped and replaced with the Domestic Violence Act of 1998. The 1994 Constitution also established the first Commission on Gender Equality to make sure that the rights and protections outlined in the new constitution were respected, followed and adapted to suit the evolving needs of South African women. =Marital rape law= Traditionally in South Africa, it was allowed for one to have non-consensual intercourse with one's wife, and not be constituted as rape. The Law commission proposed a law in 1987, which would criminalize marital rape in South Africa. The Minister of Justice introduced the bill to a preliminary committee who refused the draft, which stated marital rape as a crime. The bill was revised to make marital rape an aggravating circumstance of conviction for assault. This newly drafted bill was accepted by parliament and passed in 1989 becoming part of South African law. The reason parliament did not want to initially criminalized marital rape is because it would potentially increase the already high divorce rates in South Africa at the time. It was viewed by South African law that marital rape was not as serious as ‚Äúordinary‚Äù rape, therefore should not have as harsh consequences. In 1993, South Africa passed the Prevention of Family Violence act. This act criminalized marital rape, and other domestic violence. Marital rape has now been classified and incorporated into the offense of rape. This act also abolished the ‚Äúcautionary rule‚Äù, which allows a judge to decide the credibility of a rape survivor. South Africa is considered one of the most progressive states in Africa in relation to rights for women. However, there is a lot more that must be done in South Africa in regard to marital rape. Marital rape is deeply embedded into culture, especially in rural areas of South Africa. Laws have encouraged social change, but there needs to be more transformations within institutions throughout the country. The Domestic Violence Act 116 of 1998 was purposed to protect victims from domestic abuse. This is the state of South Africa announcing, and committing to stand against domestic violence. The act requires police to report any domestic violence act, and give them the ability to arrest any potential offender. It states that any complaint can be filed as a protection order for court. The act also states how the court system must handle such orders. Marital rape in South Africa has been often seen as a legacy of Apartheid. There was a culture of dominance, power, and aggression which led to more frequent raping. Scholars view rape as intertwined with racial injustice within the Apartheid system. Historians found that when researching the culture of rape in South Africa during this time, it was so common that communities just accepted it as a part of everyday life. Many women were embarrassed to admit to marital rape because the government and society was run by patriarchal power. =Persecution of activists= During the 1950s, activists from the Federation of South African Women (FSAW) were placed on trial for treason, alongside members of the African National Congress (ANC), the South African Communist Party and other organisations.Shimoni, Gideon. Community and Conscience: The Jews in Apartheid South Africa. UPNE, 2003. Challenges According to research on the history of the Federation of South African Women, initially, the struggle of women in South Africa was seen as a two-pronged issue: firstly, the issue of apartheid, which discriminated against non-whites, and secondly, the issue of laws and institutions that discriminated against women. During the time of apartheid, women of color experienced significant inequity as they were a part of both repressed groups. Women of color suffered from the structural violence tied to discrimination against non-whites in addition to the being subject to the inequalities assumed by all women. The oppression these women of color faced also impacted their socioeconomic standing, with the working class consisting almost entirely of women of color, thus forcing women of color to face three separate forms of oppression and discrimination. Additionally women of color were the primary demographic involved in agriculture and service work, two sections of labor that were not covered by protective labor legislation until 1994. For several decades, anti-apartheid causes and protests took precedence over gender equality initiatives. Following the abolition of apartheid in 1991 and a transition to democracy in 1994, more attention was devoted to women's rights. Some have argued that feminism in South Africa was often associated with white, middle-class women. For black South Africans, feminism may often be a highly charged position to take up; it has been seen as a colonial importation, white and middle-class. There are contemporary black African woman feminists, such as Thuli Madonsela. Broadly, feminism in South Africa has been met with varying responses. Some support the effort and see the advancement of women as a parallel issue to the advancement and liberation of the nation. Others reject the feminist movement because it is perceived to threaten customary patriarchal practices and male authority in South Africa. Organizations While there is no peak body organisation for women in South Africa, what passes for the women's movement is a collection of disparate NGOs such as People Opposing Women Abuse, Sonke Gender Justice and Progressive Women's Movement of South Africa. Women's organizations in South Africa fight not only for women's liberation but national liberation from the racial history of the country, as one liberation cannot fully exist without the other being reached as well. Other organisations that have played a historical role in promoting the rights and privileges of South African women include: * Federation of South African Women (FSAW) - a women's group active in protesting discriminatory pass laws aimed at restricting movement of coloured women. * African National Congress Women's League (ANCWL)Also referred to as African National Congress Women's Section. - initially established in 1948 and re-established in the 1990s, aimed at organising women politically and within the African National Congress in particular.Hassim, Shireen. \\"Voices, hierarchies and spaces: reconfiguring the women's movement in democratic South Africa.\\" Politikon: South African Journal of Political Studies 32, no. 2 (2005): 175-193. Today, the ANCWL has been criticised as being more of a recruitment arm for the ANC. * Women's National Coalition (WNC) - established in the early 1990s, with the aim of bringing the issue of gender equality into the public discourse. * Federation of South African Woman (FSAW) - umbrella organization established in 1954 for all women oriented organizations in South Africa. Other national and regional organisations include: * Progressive Women's Movement of South Africa (PWMSA) - a national women's movement founded in 2006. * Rape Crisis (RC) - a feminist nongovernmental organisation based in the Western Cape Province which advocates for gender equality and the freedom from gender-based violence.Blee, Kathleen M., and France Winddance Twine, eds.

Their alternative style has ranged from eccentric experimentalism to psychedelic pop. After expanding to become an octet in 2008, the band has used computer programmes, live electronics, guitars, bass, sax, percussion and drums in their live performances. Apart from releasing three albums and standing up at Tallinn Music Week, they have also performed at other festivals, such as Waves Vienna, Positivus in Latvia, Brainlove Festival of Brainlove Records in the UK and Sergey Kuryokhin International Festival in Russia. After establishing the group, the founding members Roomet Jakapi (vocals, lyrics) and Allan Plekksepp (guitar, bass guitar, programming) were soon joined by Liisa-Lotte K√§√§rd (percussion), Eerik Hanni (programming, video), Harri Altroff (keyboards) and Olavi Jaggo (drums). After some personnel change, the second wave additions in 2008 included Ingrid Aimla (percussion), Kaur Gar≈°nek (guitar, programming), Maria Lepik (alto saxophone) and Madis Paalo (drums). Several band members have been partaking in separate musical acts beside Kreatiivmootor, e.g., Roomet Jakapi in Punkt Nihu, AtgRuioFallA and Impromachine4000, Madis Paalo in Honey Power, Maria Lepik and Ingrid Aimla in Popsid, Alvin Raat in La Rabbia and Maikameikers, Kaur Gar≈°nek in The Princes.  \\"Irratsionaalne\\" (2007) release and performances  Kreatiivmootor's early recordings, published on two demo CD-Rs in 2005, received considerable attention from local music critics and radio DJs. A track called ‚ÄúIrratsionaalne‚Äù, featuring ecstatic jabbering of the singer Roomet, became a kind of underground hit in Estonia. In 2006, Erkki Luuk from an Estonian media outlet Eesti Ekspress reviewed these self-released eponymous demo albums, drew parallels with Frank Zappa and Captain Beefheart, found the music to be at the same time \\"hilarious and scary\\", pointed out the deliberate use of aleatoric techniques and randomness and found them to be important releases in regard to \\"cultural self- reflection\\", although somewhat questionable musically. Years later, in 2011, the abovementioned song, \\"Irratsionaalne\\", was chosen by Estonian Ministry of Culture to be on the compilation ‚ÄúEstonian Music Now 2011‚Äù, released by Red Orange and distributed with The Wire magazine. (Other musical contributions on this release included, e.g., classical composer Peeter V√§hi and guitarist Robert J√ºrjendal with his bands UMA and Weekend Guitar Trio.) The first official album of Kreatiivmootor, also called ‚ÄúIrratsionaalne‚Äù (since it contained the same song alongside several other compositions from the original demo recordings), was released by a small Estonian label Odessa Records in 2007. Critics approved the album for its eccentric experimentalism and used various catchy labels such as ‚Äúdada pop‚Äù and ‚Äúweird shit‚Äù to describe it. Tiit Kusnets from an Estonian media outlet Postimees reviewed the debut and classified it under such diverse genre labels as electropop, blues, punk rock, bossa, ambient, alternative pop, microhouse and stoner rock and said it to be one of the most \\"credible jokes\\" in Estonian pop music.  \\"Kaleidoskoop\\" (2010) release and performances  The second album ‚ÄúKaleidoskoop‚Äù was issued in 2010. Mart Kuldkepp from Eesti Ekspress reviewed it and pointed to the grandiose vocal experiments and monotonous, naivist backgrounds consistent with the previous release, but ultimately summed up the release as a departure from the syrrealist, anarchist, unconventional and unashamedly unprofessional approach of the debut and as saw it a halfway towards becoming \\"a real band\\" and making music in conventional sense. \\"Kreatiivmootor could be the best Finno-Ugric horror band, if their music, beside being weird and scary, wasn't also very childish and superficial,\\" said Kuldkepp. At the same time, Kuldkepp also drew attention to a very wide genre spectrum incorporating everything from pop songs, blues rock and industrial music to schlager. \\"Kaleidoskoop\\" was presented in 2010 at Tallinn Music Week festival. Tauno Maarpuu from the Estonian cultural newspaper Sirp gave a not-so-mixed review and described the concert in following words: \\"/.../ [G]enre defying Kreatiivmootor, led by the charismatic vocalist Roomet Jakapi, left a surprisingly professional impression, especially considering their so-called homespun dada-past. Experienced musicians who had joined the band after the release of the debut album in 2007 alongside the core members /.../ made the crowd cheer with enthusiasm.\\"Roomet Jakapi performing with Kreatiivmootor at Tallinn Music Week  \\"Algne s√ºlg esitab\\" (2016) release and performances  The material of the third album \\"Algne s√ºlg esitab\\" was performed and developed first during live shows beginning in 2011 and released five years later. In 2011, Tallinn was designated to be a European Capital of Culture, which brought a lot of attention to Estonian artists, Kreatiivmootor being one of them. The band made an impression on some of the foreign delegates attending Tallinn Music Week festival. What followed was a series of concerts in European capitals. Luke Slater from the UK-based music webzine Drowned In Sound wrote about the seminal concert: \\"The highlight of the Odessa Pop night ‚Äî and as it later turns out the entire event ‚Äì were Kreatiivmootor. The Estonian language utilises an awful lot of double vowels and naturally strikes a great deal of fear into the mind and mouths, should you get that far, of any foreigner trying their hand at being an adaptable and cosmopolitan member of the human race/European Union. Still, the aforementioned vowels really do emphasise the essential, well, for want of a better word, creativity in this jam-troupe (for extreme yearning for an alternative turn of phrase). Listening to them on record, although still retaining a sense and essence of their tangential and avant-garde wonkiness, won't come close to their live presence. Fronted by a man who we are told is a philosophy professor is telling. /.../ All of the philosophy professors I knew of at university were several chapters short of a treatise and Kreatiivmootor's approach does not betray this whatsoever with one extended session of beats, yelps, and bit-by-bit building blowing away the thought of my very existence out of my headspace. It's hard not to move your feet, as I do, even in the lamest manner, but Roomet Jakapi is a distracting man too, weaving in and around his bandmates, whose individual performances are also mesmerising, especially percussively ‚Äî actions which draw more than the odd wave of arm from an encapsulated audience. Of course there is structure, but like all good improvised music, it seems a distant thought. What isn't a distant thought, though, are any questions about the abundant intensity and quality of Kreatiivmootor. Mind. Blown.\\" In June 2011, Kreatiivmootor performed at Brainlove Festival of Brainlove Records, London. Webzine The Line Of Best Fit described the performance as a \\"/.../ frenzied, pulsing art-kraut-jazz-techno-improv of Estonian ensemble.\\" In September 2011, in regards to the performance at Popkomm festival, Berlin, Kreatiivmootor was introduced: \\"Originally a duo sporting weird lo-fi dada-pop of a kind that no one had ever heard before, Kreatiivmootor have by now expanded into a small orchestra, with music more diverse and polished ‚Äì hypnotic electronic grooves enriched with psychedelic acoustic sounds, instrumental and vocal improvisation. Their expressive nature is best revealed in live performances which, more often than not, threaten to turn into a kind of Witch's Sabbath or Bacchanalia.\\" In October 2011, Kreatiivmootor gave two concerts at Iceland Airwaves festival, Reykjav√≠k (one of them at Harpa concert hall). John Rogers wrote in Iceland Airwaves' webzine, \\"The best is saved till last. From Tallinn, Estonia, Kreatiivmootor are a band like no other. Their shrieking, babbling shaman of a frontman Roomet Jakapi (also a professor of philosophy) utterly smashes speech and language through his pedal array, uttering a crazed lexicon of sounds and syllables in a hyper-communicative language all of his own. The five-piece band smash music around him accordingly, breaking it down into beeping, drilling, oscillating sonic non-sequitors that grapple and flail in a compulsively weird whirlwind before congealing into a pounding, danceable racket. Half the audience giggle in stunned confusion, the other half rapt, rolling in the shards of sound, sweating and grinning at these joyful, brilliant lunatics who‚Äôve taken over the asylum. This kind of brazen invention is a far cry from the woefully insipid opening act ‚Äì Kreatiivmootor are the stuff legendary Airwaves performances are made of.\\" In October 2011, Kreatiivmootor also performed at Waves Vienna, Vienna. Robin Murray from Clash magazine wrote: \\"/.../ [A] great sonic onslaught of beats and attitude, like a Baltic version of the Lo Fidelity Allstars.\\" Following year, Kreatiivmootor performed at Tallinn Music Week 2012. Amy Liptrot from Clash magazine described Kreatiivmootor's performance in these words: ‚Äú/.../ [T]he astounding, perplexing Kreatiivmootor, whose constantly-moving frontman is like a glamorous toddler singing in an invented language, a rock ‚Äòn‚Äô roll tongues.‚Äù In 2013, Kreatiivmootor performed at Club Radio Free Europe concert, London. The Vinyl District webzine gave an overview: \\"/.../ The club brought together the eclectric, [sic] absurd, glam and gothic in the form of Kreatiivmootor, an electro-funk dada-ist experimental happening.\\" In 2016, after a long period of post production and editing, the material which originated and had developed from the improvisational performances of 2011 and 2012 was finally released under the title \\"Algne s√ºlg esitab\\" (in English: \\"Primary Saliva Presents\\") and distributed as a digital release as well as in compact cassette format. It took another sharp turn from the previous releases and offered a 7-part quasi-improvisational suite in experimental industrial and quirky noise rock vein. Instrumental performances followed a pre- programmed, but variable sequence of beats, glitches and harmonic themes. The original raw material was recorded in 2012 in Tallinn during a radio concert \\"Areaal LIVE\\" on Klassikaraadio, Estonian Public Broadcasting. Siim Nestor from Eesti Ekspress reviewed the album, viewed it through a makeshift genre label for uncategorizable music, \\"weird shit\\", and summed it up in words, \\"Weird shit dinner parties are finally possible.\\" The album was also reviewed in other Estonian media outlets.  \\"Mentalbau\\" (2019) release  The fourth album \\"Mentalbau\\" was released digitally on November 7, 2019 (with double vinyl release still pending). It features about 1 hour of new original music with guest performances from Estonian musicians Robert J√ºrjendal and Anne Aavik in addition to remixes from electronic music artists such as ekke, Kiwa, Forgotten Sunrise and Galaktlan. It features artwork by Juss Piho and design by Mauno Meesit. Within a month, the double album received numerous airplays on Estonian Public Broadcasting radio programs as well as on Latvian Latvijas Radio NABA and Austrian radio FM4. It was also covered in smaller independent music blogs such as Acid Ted, Last Day Deaf and The Playground. The album received favorable reviews from Estonian news outlets Eesti Ekspress, Postimees and M√º√ºrileht. At the end of 2019, Kreatiivmootor's album arrived at the 5th place of Estonian Public Broadcasting's Top 50, being preceded by artists such as FKA Twigs, Nick Cave & The Bad Seeds, Kim Gordon and Michael Kiwanuka. The album was financed via the Estonian crowdfunding vehicle Hooandja with additional support from Estonian Cultural Endowment and Estonian Performers' Association.

Newtown Abbey lies immediately to the northwest, across the river. History One of the main buildings of the priory. St. John's Priory was established by Simon Rochfort, Bishop of Meath, c. 1202 for the Crutched Friars. The first record of the priory is in 1281 when there was a grant of alms from the manor of \\"Magathtreth.\\" In 1513 Edmund Dillon was prior of this monastery; his brother Thomas Dillon was prior of Saints Peter and Paul's at the time. Their brother Robert was granted the priory at the 1540 Dissolution of the Monasteries.

There were of arable land near the Boyne, land and a mill on the Leinster Blackwater, a castle and land at Longwood, County Meath and various other lands in the county. He later sold it to the Ashe family. After they abandoned it, it was supposedly granted to the Catholic Bishop of Meath. After the Battle of the Boyne (1690) the building was granted to one of King William's men. According to one story, on his first night in the holy spot he saw a \\"most horrid vision\\" and at dawn he rode away never to return.

Saqr was an Arab nationalist, which undermined the British Empire's control of the Trucial States. In 1964, he supported the opening of an Arab League office in Sharjah, after a visit by an Arab League delegation lead by Abdul Khalek Hassouna, the Secretary-General at the time. The British viewed this move as a threat, which lead the British administration to intervene and initiate the ouster of Saqr as the ruler Sharjah. In 1965, Glencairn Paul, the British Political Agent in Dubai, was tasked to inform Saqr of his deposition. Saqr was then exiled to Bahrain and eventually Cairo. His cousin, Khalid bin Mohammed Al Qasimi succeeded him. On 24 January 1972, following soon after the creation of the United Arab Emirates on 2 December 1971, Saqr returned to Sharjah from Egypt with a number of mercenaries and seized power in an attempted coup. The group invested the Ruler's palace at approximately 2.30pm, with reports of gunfire and grenade explosions within the palace. Besieged by the Union Defence Force, which arrived an hour later, Saqr finally gave himself up in the early hours of 25 January to UAE Minister of Defence, Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum.

She has organised street markets in Mei Foo, Sham Shui Po and Wong Tai Sin to demonstrate that hawking can be conducted in an orderly manner. She urges the government to once again issue hawker licences, and to allow street markets throughout the territory to provide more choice to consumers. Until 2016, authorities had turned a blind eye to the Lunar New Year market on Kweilin Street, considered a staple of Hong Kong culture. On 7 February 2016, the eve of the Lunar New Year, the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) officers took a hardline stance against the market, chasing away the vendors. Lau set up a stall in the street and sold squid in defiance, and was arrested. In response to the crackdown, localist group Hong Kong Indigenous called on supporters to come out on 8 February to help \\"protect\\" the hawkers and the night markets, which are considered a staple of Hong Kong culture. The FEHD and police again took action against the markets, resulting in a major civil disturbance. In response to her arrest, Lau said the government's stance was unreasonable, as hawking provides jobs, lowers the cost of living, and gives residents choice in the face of neighbourhoods dominated by corporate powers. Lau appeared at Kowloon City Magistrates' Court on 20 June 2016. Two officers from the FEHD testified that they saw Lau heat up squid with a frying pan and sell a man a skewer for HK$10. She was convicted on three counts, namely: obstruction of a public space, hawking without a licence, and cooking food for the purpose of hawking without a licence. She was fined HK$1,800 and her hawking gear was seized under the Public Health and Municipal Services Ordinance. Lau stated that she would continue to hawk and would continue to support hawkers. Lau's educational career is under jeopardy due to her hawking-related activism. In mid-2016 the Hong Kong Polytechnic University launched a disciplinary hearing against her for \\"moonlighting\\" as she reportedly earned HK$10 selling snacks. Lau said that the university's actions were politically motivated, stating that senior figures at the institute had told her that the president was under pressure from the university's governing council to take action against her. Lau donated the $10 to her Democracy Groundwork and defended herself, stating that there was no conflict of interest, that hawking does not constitute formal employment, and that the ban on moonlighting applied only to full-time faculty (while she was a part-time lecturer at the time).  Political career = 2016 election and platform = Running under the banner of Democracy Groundwork, Lau was elected to the Legislative Council in the 2016 election, representing the geographical constituency of Kowloon West. During her election campaign, Lau stated that if elected her top priorities would be to \\"push back on 'white elephant' infrastructure projects, implement a universal pension scheme, legislate standard working hours, reform housing policy, and restart electoral reform.\\" Lau calls for the reform of Hong Kong's political system. She believes it is ineffective to fight against Leung Chun-ying on the grounds that, \\"You kick away Leung and Beijing will give you another one as bad as him, if not worse. We need to reform the system.\\" She has rejected the idea of Hong Kong independence as \\"unrealistic\\", but says the issue should be open for discussion. She advocates a \\"very high\\" degree of autonomy for Hong Kong and the protection of local culture. In addition to her above views on hawkers, Lau is critical of Link REIT, a private real estate company whose assets primarily comprise shopping centres, markets, and car parks in public housing estates. Link REIT exercises a de facto monopoly in many low-income areas, and has been subject to numerous protests due to rapid rent increases, eviction of local shops in favour of chain operators, and property management outsourcing. There have been calls for the government to buy back properties owned by the Link REIT, most of which were divested from the Housing Authority in 2005. Lau said that allowing more hawking and street markets would provide more choice and spur competition. The election was held on 4 September 2016, with a total of 36 candidates standing on 15 party lists in the Kowloon West constituency. Standing alone on her list, Lau garnered 38,183 votes, the third highest at 13.69 percent of the total, and the best supported pro-democracy candidate. She is regarded as a member of the localist camp, and pledged to work together with other newly elected localists Eddie Chu and Nathan Law. = Swearing-in and disqualification as legislator= At the Legislative Council swearing-in on 12 October 2016 Lau first read an altered version of the oath of office in protest. She was asked to read it again, and she did so extremely slowly. Other pro-democratic and localist candidates similarly added extra phrases of protest to their oaths. LegCo president Andrew Leung Kwan-yuen rejected the oath and sent Lau a notice that read: \\"The conduct of Ms Lau's oath-taking, objectively assessed, has shown that she was not serious about the affirmation and had no intention to be bound by it.\\" Leung asked Lau, Baggio Leung, Yau Wai-ching, and Edward Yiu, who had all protested during their swearing-in, to retake their oaths. The government challenged Leung's decision with regard to Yau and Baggio Leung, in an unprecedented action whereby the government sought to disqualify two democratically elected legislators. Lau, despite protesting in a similar manner to Yau Wai-ching and Baggio Leung, did not appear to be targeted by the court order. Lau was finally sworn in on 2 November 2016 by Andrew Leung, despite the protests of pro-Beijing camp. The judge presiding over Yau and Leung's case ruled in favour of the government on 15 November 2016, disqualifying the duo and barring them from the legislature. Jackson Kwan San-wai, who ran at the head of the Politihk Social Strategic list in the same constituency as Lau but lost, with his list (of two) gaining only 938 votes (0.34%), filed an election petition against Lau in November 2016 on the grounds that by her conduct during the swearing-in she did not uphold the Basic Law. Politihk Social Strategic is a group of pro-Beijing activists who opposed the 2014 pro-democratic protests. It was followed by the government launching a second legal action, against her and three other legislators, Leung Kwok-hung of the League of Social Democrats (LSD), Nathan Law of Demosisto and Yiu Chung-yim, on 2 December. The four members were eventually disqualified by the court on 14 July 2017. Lau and Leung pursued a legal appeal against their disqualification, meaning that of the six seats left vacant by the removal of pro-democracy Legislative Councillors, only the other four were contested in the by-election of 11 March 2018. However, on 29 May 2018, Lau announced that she was retracting her appeal, given uncertainty from the court about whether it could be heard with Leung's, as well as the cost and high psychological pressure of the case, and the delay it would cause to the opportunity for the democratic camp to regain the seat in a by- election.Former lawmaker Lau Siu-lai drops appeal against her disqualification to trigger by-election, Hong Kong Free Press, by Kris Cheng, 29 May 2018 =Kowloon West by-election, 2018 and disqualified= On 29 June 2018, Lau joined the Labour Party, and brought her Democracy Groundwork group on board the party also. She publicly discussed the possibility of running to regain her old seat, either with the Labour Party or independently. Also in June, it was announced that the by-election for Lau's seat, the geographical constituency of Kowloon West, would take place on 25 November 2018. On 20 September, Lau became the first person to announce her candidacy in a bid to regain it.Ousted lawmaker Lau Siu-lai to run in November‚Äôs Legislative Council by-election, Hong Kong Free Press, 20 September 2018 She was the candidate of the pro-democracy camp. On 12 October 2018, Lau was disqualified by the Electoral Affairs Commission. She was replaced by Lee Cheuk-yan, who was defeated by health ambassador and pro-Beijing Chan Hoi-yan on 25 November. Pro-democracy camp lost their majority status in the Geographical constituency part in the Legislative Council of Hong Kong. Notes : Lau served as member of the Legislative Council until 14 July 2017 when her oath was invalidated and her seat was vacated according to the ruling of the Court of First Instance.

Three follow-on sessions were held in May 2017, July 2018, and August 2020, respectively. The first Panglong Conference was held in the Panglong region of British Burma in 1947, and was negotiated between Aung San and ethnic leaders. As of August 2020, ten ethnic armed organizations have signed the Nationwide Ceasefire Agreement (NCA). Eighteen ethnic insurgent groups attended the first session of the conference, whilst three ethnic insurgent groups (The Arakan Army, the Myanmar National Democratic Alliance Army, and the Ta'ang National Liberation Army), who were actively engaged with the national army, did not attend. Ban Ki-moon, the Secretary-General of the United Nations, also attended the opening ceremony. The United Wa State Army left the conference early, saying they were only permitted observer status. The government planned to continue the conference sessions semiannually, until a permanent ceasefire and peace agreement was implemented. Originally, only signatories of the NCA would be permitted to attend, although this requirement was subsequently scrapped. The original schedule was optimistic and the second session was not held until May of 2017. The first session of the conference was chaired by Lt. Gen. Yar Pyae from the Tatmadaw, Tin Myo Win from the union government, Shila Nan Taung from the parliament, Khun Myint Tun from the ethnic armed organisations (EAOs) and Myint Soe from the political parties.

Fishing in the lakes and flooded forests provides an important source of food and income for the residents. History The Ituxi Extractive Reserve was created by federal decree on 5 June 2008 with an area of about . IT is administered by the Chico Mendes Institute for Biodiversity Conservation (ICMBio). It is classed as IUCN protected area category VI (protected area with sustainable use of natural resources). The purpose is to protect the livelihoods and ensure use and conservation of natural resources traditionally used by the communities in the reserve. On 18 September 2008 INCRA recognised the reserve as supporting 300 families of small farmers, who would be eligible for PRONAF support. The deliberative council of the reserve was created on 4 November 2010. An ordinance of 9 January 2012 established a joint planning process for conservation units in the BR-319 area of influence, which are the Abufari Biological Reserve, Cuni√£ Ecological Station, Nascentes do Lago Jari National Park, Mapinguari National Park, Balata-Tufari National Forest, Humait√° National Forest, Iquiri National Forest, Lago do Capan√£-Grande Extractive Reserve, Ituxi Extractive Reserve, M√©dio Purus Extractive Reserve and Lago do Cuni√£ Extractive Reserve. In July 2012 ICMBio arranged a three-day workshop in the Floresta community in the reserve, supported by a representative of the Tropical Forest Institute and others. Objectives included giving the residents an update on progress in preparing the community forest management plan, and informing the residents about the business plan for commercializing wood. The institutes had entered a partnership with the Association of Agroextractive Producers of the Assembly of God of Ituxi River to prepare a training plan for forest management. The Sustainable Forestry Management Plan was approved in June 2014, covering an area of divided into ten units of annual production. Sustainable logging is allowed in the reserve as an alternative source of income.

The company was founded by Jeremy Hodara and Sacha Poignonnec in 2013. Its headquarters are currently in the Yaba area of Lagos, Nigeria. The company initially started out as the Rocket Internet Company. However, the rapid growth of the company allowed it to secure strategic investors, including CDC, Goldman Sachs, Orange, MTN and the Millicom group. On June 23, 2016, Africa Internet Group (AIG), Jumia Market's parent company announced that it was bringing all its known e-commerce companies under the Jumia umbrella. History Jumia Market was founded by Jeremy Hodara and Sacha Poignonnec in February, 2013. The company started operations in Nigeria and Pakistan that same year under the name Kaymu; after receiving an undisclosed amount of seed funding from Rocket Internet. The company grew from an employee base of ten to sixty within first nine months and opened operations in Ghana and Morocco in October, 2013. By June 2015, Kaymu had expanded its operations to Algeria, Saudi Arabia, Croatia and Angola Mozambique, Bangladesh, Nepal, Myanmar, Slovenia, Sri Lanka, Bulgaria, Uzbekistan, and the Philippines, bringing the total number of countries to 35. Jumia Market employs eBay's business model, serving as an online mall where sellers and buyers meet to make transactions. The company launched its smartphone apps for Android, iOS and Blackberry in September, 2014 tapping into the tremendous growth of mobile technology, especially on the African continent. In March 2016, AIG announced that top tier investment bank, Goldman Sachs and French Insurance company AXA, had joined its list of investors with both investing a cumulative sum of over $300 million. The company is headed globally by Massi Spalazzi, who serves as Chief Executive Officer (CEO), while Andrea Di Natale serves as the company's Chief Operating Officer (COO). In June 2016, AIG, via a combination of a live Periscope broadcast and Twitter feed updates, announced that it was merging all its online brands into one company: Jumia. As a result, platforms exploring food, real estate, automobile and general goods market, became a part of the Jumia franchise. By the first quarter of 2019, Jumia was already operating in several countries in Africa, including Kenya, Nigeria, Egypt and Uganda among others. The Kenyan Jumia is the most popular online shopping platform in the country Products and services In October 2015, Jumia Market Village, an offline store, was created to help attract customers who were skeptical about the safety of online transactions. The store was designed to create an environment for customers who were looking to interact with sellers face to face and customers who could not complete payments through the Internet. Jumia Market launched AIG Express, a logistics network, in May, 2015 to help ease logistics and operations management in Africa. AIG Express aims to provide faster delivery time while creating 100,000 jobs in Africa. Jumia Market SafePay was launched in May, 2013 as an avenue for safe payments on its platform. SafePay is an escrow service that allows buyers to pay directly to Jumia Market for items bought plus the cost of delivery, while sellers have to ship the item purchased to the buyer before receiving the money from Jumia Market. In countries like Uganda, where Jumia is operating Mtn Mobile money as one of the payment methods, the customer pays into a Jumia mobile money account after which Jumia pays off the seller. Controversies Jumia Market, like other startups backed by Rocket Internet, has come under heavy criticism for its duplicate business model. Rocket Internet has been accused of not having any original business ideas and taking business models that have succeeded in Europe and the U.S. and cloning them in emerging economies. Jumia Market has been described as a company that copied the eBay business model.

The holiday was also established to acknowledge Aliyah, immigration to the Jewish state, as a core value of the State of Israel, and honor the ongoing contributions of Olim, Jewish immigrants, to Israeli society. Yom HaAliyah is also observed in Israeli schools on the seventh of the Hebrew month of Cheshvan. The opening clause of the Yom HaAliyah Law states in Hebrew: English translation: History Joshua Leading the Israelites Across the Jordan River into the Land of Israel on the 10th of Nisan, Benjamin West Yom HaAliyah, as a modern holiday celebration, began in 2009 as a grassroots community initiative and young Olim self-initiated movement in Tel Aviv, spearheaded by the TLV Internationals organization of the Am Yisrael Foundation. On June 21, 2016 the Twentieth Knesset voted in favor of codifying the grassroots initiative into law by officially adding Yom HaAliyah to the Israeli national calendar. The Yom HaAliyah bill was co-sponsored by Knesset members from different parties in a rare instance of cooperation across the political spectrum of the opposition and coalition. The key Knesset parliamentarians who initially worked on the final successful version of the Yom HaAliyah bill were Miki Zohar of Likud, Hilik Bar of Israeli Labor Party, and Michael Oren of Kulanu. There were previous failed attempts in other Knesset sessions to create similar legislation, none of which were related to the ultimate successful creation of the holiday, namely Knesset members Avraham Neguise, Yoel Razvozov, Robert Ilatov, and Yaakov Katz. https://www.jpost.com/Israel-News/Culture/Its-official-Aliya-Day-to-be-a- national-holiday-457390 http://www.jpost.com/Jewish-World/Jewish-News/Bill- seeks-to-establish-national-Aliya-Day-345758 Significance The original calendar date chosen for Yom HaAliyah, the tenth of Nisan, is laden with symbolism. Although a modern holiday created by the Knesset of Israel, the tenth of Nisan is a date of religious significance for the Jewish People as recounted in the Hebrew Bible and in traditional Jewish thought.http://www.jpost.com/Jewish-World/Jewish-News/Bill-seeks-to-establish- national-Aliya-Day-345758 =Biblical= 5th Century mosaic depicting the Ark of the Covenant carried by the Israelites across the Jordan River into the Land of Israel on the 10th of Nisan led by Joshua The Ark carried by the Israelites over the Jordan River into the Land of Israel on the 10th of Nisan by Italian Renaissance painter Raphael On the tenth of Nisan, according to the biblical narrative in the Book of Joshua, Joshua leading the Israelites crossed the Jordan River at Gilgal into the Promised Land while carrying the Ark of the Covenant. It was thus the first documented \\"mass Aliyah.\\" On that day, God commanded the Israelites to commemorate and celebrate the occasion by erecting twelve stones with the text of the Torah engraved upon them. The stones represented the entirety of the Jewish nation's twelve tribes and their gratitude for God's gift of the Land of Israel () to them. The 10th of Nisan is also significant as it was the first Shabbat HaGadol that took place five days before the Israelites left Egypt beginning The Exodus. This is also the date that Moses's sister Miriam died and according to the Biblical narrative her well that miraculously traveled with the Israelites through the desert dried up (Numbers 20:1‚Äì2). The tenth of the Hebrew month of Nisan, which is the first month according to the ordering of the Hebrew calendar, is referenced in association with Aliyah multiple times within the Biblical text.

Besides the individual religious implication of those Torah laws that can only be followed in Israel as opposed to when Jews are living around the world, there are traditional precepts that uniquely effect the Jewish People as an entire nation after having made Aliyah.http://www.israelnationalnews.com/Articles/Article.aspx/24504 When the Israelites crossed the Jordan River into the Land of Israel for the first time on the 10th of Nisan, according to traditional Jewish teachings they took upon themselves a special dimension to the concept of \\"arevut\\" or \\"mutual responsibility\\". https://www.etzion.org.il/en/shiur-20arevutandtokhacha Arevut is known also by the Talmudic Hebrew/Aramaic maxim mentioned in Shevuot 39a, \\"Kol Yisrael Areivim Zeh baZeh\\", \\"◊õ◊ú ◊ô◊©◊®◊ê◊ú ◊¢◊®◊ë◊ô◊ù ◊ñ◊î ◊ë◊ñ◊î\\", meaning \\"All Jews are Responsible for One Another\\". https://www.etzion.org.il/en/mutual- responsibility-jewish-state The Maharal of Prague, Rabbi Judah Loew ben Bezalel, comments on the Talmudic statement that the Israelites were not truly responsible for one another until after they had crossed the Jordan. http://traditionarchive.org/news/originals/Volume%2012/No.%203/The%20Torah%20of%20Israel.pdf Arevut implies an obligation on all Jews to ensure that other Jews have their spiritual and basic needs taken care of. Simply by virtue of being a Jew living in the Land of Israel, one has an elevated responsibility for the well- being of other Jews.https://www.myjewishlearning.com/article/all-of-israel- are-responsible-for-one-another/ Jews are expected to be a ‚Äúlight unto the nations‚Äù, presenting a model of morality and brotherly responsibility. Specifically in terms of \\"Kol Yisrael\\", the hope is that other nations around the globe will also see how Jews help each other when living in Israel and will try to do the same for their own people. http://www.jewishvaluesonline.org/200 =State of Israel= Marc Chagall - Les Isra√©lites Passent le Jourdain The Israelites crossing the Jordan River with the Ark, Old Sacristy, Milan Italy, 15th c. Aliyah (, ; , \\"ascent\\") is the immigration of Jews from the diaspora to the Land of Israel. Also defined as \\"the act of going up\\", \\"making Aliyah\\" by moving to the Land of Israel is one of the most basic tenets of Judaism and therefore Zionism. The State of Israel's Law of Return gives Jews and their descendants automatic rights regarding residency and Israeli citizenship. From the modern founding of the State of Israel, honoring Aliyah as a core value of the nation is evident even in the text of the Israeli Declaration of Independence, most profoundly in the opening few lines. Aliyah as a core value of the State of Israel can be seen in its national anthem, Hatikvah, \\"The Hope\\", which was adapted from a poem by the 19th century Jewish poet, Naftali Herz Imber. Honoring Aliyah has also been at the core of the State of Israel's religious sector. The Prayer for the Welfare of the State of Israel is a prayer said in many Jewish synagogues on Shabbat and on Jewish holidays, both in Israel and around the globe. The prayer requests divine providence for the State of Israel, its leaders, and that God helps with Aliyah, namely that still exiled Jewish People be gathered back into the Land of Israel. The prayer was instituted in 1948 by the Sephardic and Ashkenazic Chief Rabbis of the newly formed State of Israel, respectively Rabbi Ben-Zion Meir Hai Uziel and Rabbi Yitzhak HaLevi Herzog with assistance by Nobel laureate Shmuel Yosef Agnon. https://opensiddur.org/prayers/collective-welfare/government/medinat- yisrael/prayer-for-the-welfare-of-the-state-of-israel-by-yitshak-halevi- hertzog-1948/ =Jewish thought= James Jacques Joseph Tissot - The Ark carried by the Israelites over the Jordan River into the Land of Israel on the 10th of Nisan The Ark carried by the Israelites over the Jordan River into the Land of Israel on the 10th of Nisan Aliyah is an important Jewish religious concept and a fundamental component of Zionism. For much of Jewish history, the majority of the Jewish People have lived in the diaspora where Aliyah was developed as a national aspiration for the Jewish People. It is enshrined in Israel's Law of Return, which accords any Jew (deemed as such by halakha and Israeli secular law) the legal right to assisted immigration and settlement in Israel, as well as Israeli citizenship. Someone who \\"makes Aliyah\\" is called an \\"Oleh\\" (m.; pl. \\"Olim\\") or \\"Olah\\" (f.; pl. \\"Olot\\"). Many religious Jews espouse Aliyah as a return to the Promised Land, and regard it as the fulfillment of God's biblical promise to the descendants of the Hebrew patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. Rabbi Moshe Ben Nachman, also known as Nachmanides or the Ramban, includes making Aliyah in his enumeration of the 613 commandments. The Hebrew Bible is laden with references to a future when the Jewish People would have a mass return to the Land of Israel. The Bible recounts that when God sent the Jews to exile from the Holy Land approximately 2,500 years ago, He made a promise about the future of Aliyah: God promised that one day, He would gather His children from the four corners of the earth, and bring them back home, to the Land of Israel: Robert Hecquet, Israelites Crossing the Jordan River In the Talmud, at the end of tractate Ketubot, the Mishnah says: The discussion on this passage in the Mishnah emphasizes the importance of living in Israel: Sifre says that the mitzvah (commandment) of living in Eretz Yisrael is as important as all the other mitzvot combined. There are many mitzvot such as shmita, the sabbatical year for farming, which can only be fulfilled in the Land of Israel. According to the traditional Jewish ordering of books of the Tanakh (Old Testament), the very last word of the last book in the original Hebrew (2 Chronicles 36:23) is veya‚Äòal, a jussive verb form derived from the same root as \\"Aliyah\\", meaning \\"and let him go up\\" (to Jerusalem in the Land of Israel). As the tenth of Nisan occurs a few days before the Passover holiday, when Israeli schools are not in session, the school system will also honor Aliyah on the seventh of the Hebrew month of Cheshvan. That date is also symbolic as the Torah portion read in synagogues that week, Lekh Lekha, relates the story of how the biblical patriarch Abraham is ordered by God to leave his home, his birthplace, and his family and go up to the Land of Israel. This is also the date that the additional prayer for rain is added into the Amidah, and recited three times a day by Jews in Israel. =Modern= Am Yisrael Foundation logo representing the Twelve Tribes of Israel having made Aliyah to the Land of Israel en masse from the now emptied out four corners of the world, signified as the twelve stalks of wheat dreamt by Joseph Jay M.

Vingtieme  Damilaville is believed to have coauthored an article in the Encyclop√©die on the Vingtieme tax regime with Diderot, his trusted associate. His treatise is largely a discussion on the nature of government, of civil society and of the economy. Like Montesquie, Damilaville makes a clear distinction between the state, as an aggregate of people in society, and government. The treatise uses this dichotomy between the state and government to rationalize the necessity of taxes; however, Damilaville also argues tax simplification or reform. What is important in his contention for tax simplification is the purpose of having or raising taxes on participants in society. According to Damilaville, tax burdens should not be understood through the vice of ratios of an individuals' income, rather in through the ratio of taxes that concern an individual's sustenance after their monies have been deducted. Friendship with Voltaire Voltaire regarded him as a very close friend, and wrote him at least 539 letters over eight years.Davidson, Ian, Voltaire-A Life, Profile Books, 2010 p.305 They only actually met, for the first time, after they had been corresponding for five years, on 20 August 1765, when Damilaville visited Ferney.Davidson, Ian, Voltaire-A Life, Profile Books, 2010 p.344 Opinion of Damilaville was not universally positive: Melchior Grimm said of him:Davidson, Ian, Voltaire-A Life, Profile Books, 2010 p.304  References   Bibliography  * Emmanuel Boussuge et Fran√ßoise Launay, ¬´ L'ami D'Amilaville ¬ª, ', 2014, n¬∞ 49, (p. 25‚Äì41). * Emmanuel Boussuge et Fran√ßoise Launay, \\"√âtienne No√´l D'Amilaville (1723‚Äì1768)\\", Les collaborateurs de l'Encyclop√©die, projet d'Edition Num√©rique Collaborative et Critique de l'Encyclop√©die' (6 January 2015)  External links  Damilaville on Wikisource * G√©n√©alogie des Damilaville. * Autre publication: article \\"Paix\\" de l'Encyclop√©die. 18th-century French philosophers Enlightenment philosophers Contributors to the Encyclop√©die (1751‚Äì1772) People from Bordeaux 1723 births 1768 deaths Denis Diderot Voltaire ","title":"√âtienne No√´l Damilaville"},{"id":"51464323","title":"List of All-Ireland Senior Football Championship medal winners"},{"id":"51464374","text":"Jeanette Hain in 2015 Jeanette Hain (born 18 February 1969, Munich) is a German film actress.

He began his professional career in 2012 at the age of eighteen and reached the top makuuchi division in September 2015. His highest rank to date has been sekiwake. He has two gold stars for defeating yokozuna and two special prize for Outstanding Performance. He wrestles for the Oitekaze stable. Early life and education Hayato Takanishi was born on 10 November 1993 in Asaka, a city in Saitama Prefecture. He started sumo after winning a local tournament during his first year in elementary school. He attended , a school famous for its sumo club, and earned a place in the club's first team near the end of his second year. In his final year he contributed to the school finishing in second place in the team competition at national championships. After graduation he joined Oitekaze stable to pursue a professional sumo career. Career =Early career= Takanishi Hayato entered sumo under his birth name but adopted the ring name Daishoei for his first competitive tournament. He won the jonokuchi division with a 7‚Äì0 record in March 2012 and a 6‚Äì1 record in jonidan in May saw him promoted to sandanme where he recorded four wins in July. He then modified his ring name slightly and became Daieish≈ç. After winning records in the next two tournaments he was promoted to makushita but struggled in higher division and was relegated back to sandanme. A perfect 7‚Äì0 in May 2013 saw him take the divisional championship and secure a return to makushita. After three consecutive winning records (kachi-koshi) Daieish≈ç was promoted to the second highest j≈´ry≈ç division for the July 2014 tournament, the 14th former student of Saitama Sakae's coach Michinori Yamada to reach the rank. After performing consistently in j≈´ry≈ç for a year he earned promotion to the top division (makuuchi) with a 9‚Äì6 record in July 2015. =Makuuchi career= In September 2015 Daieish≈ç made his makuuchi debut at the rank of maegashira 13. He was the youngest man in the division at 21 years old. He won seven of his first fourteen bouts, including an upset victory over Takarafuji but a final day defeat against Takekaze saw him end the tournament with a 7‚Äì8 losing record (make-koshi). In November he recorded only six wins and was demoted to j≈´ry≈ç but returned to the top division after an 8‚Äì7 record in January 2016. In March 2016 Daieish≈ç produced a career-best effort, recording ten wins including victories over Ichinoj≈ç and Takekaze to place him in a tie for seventh place. In May, at career-high rank of maegashira 9 he stood at 6‚Äì4 after ten days but then slumped to five consecutive defeats. He struggled again in July, recording only five wins and dropped to maegashira 16 for September. His seven tournament run in the top division ended after a 5‚Äì10 record saw him relegated to j≈´ry≈ç for the November tournament but he responded with eight wins to put himself back in contention for promotion. In January 2017 he won the j≈´ry≈ç division with a 12‚Äì3 record to secure his promotion back to makuuchi. He produced his best result in the top division to date in the March 2017 tournament, winning his last eight bouts in a row to finish on 11‚Äì4. This saw him promoted to his highest rank to date of maegashira 3 for the May tournament. Facing all the yokozuna and ≈çzeki for the first time, he followed his eight consecutive wins in March with eight losses in his first eight bouts in May and finished with a 4‚Äì11 record. After falling to maegashira 13 with a poor 5‚Äì10 score in November 2017, he recovered somewhat to post consecutive 9‚Äì6 records in the January and March tournaments of 2018. He reached maegashira 2 in March 2019, and remained near the top of the maegashira ranks in the next few tournaments. In September he earned his first kinboshi with a defeat of Kakury≈´, his first win over a yokozuna in eleven attempts. He attained a career highest rank of maegashira 1 in the November 2019 tournament, and earned his career kinboshi on Day 2 with a first win over Hakuh≈ç in five attempts. Hakuh≈ç went on to win the tournament and as the only man to defeat him, Daieisho received the Outstanding Performance Prize. He made his debut at the komusubi rank in January 2020, narrowly failing to secure a majority of wins, finishing on 7‚Äì8. He returned to komusubi in July 2020, where he defeated Hakuh≈ç again, won his last six bouts to finish on 11‚Äì4 and won his second Outstanding Performance Prize. He was promoted to sekiwake for the September 2020 tournament, the first sekiwake from Saitama Prefecture since Wakachichibu in July 1963. Fighting style Daieish≈ç is a tsuki and oshi specialist, which means he relies on thrusting and pushing techniques to defeat his opponents rather than belt-wrestling. By far the most common of his winning techniques is oshidashi which accounts for 55% of his wins. Although he also used belt gripping techniques during his high school career, he has focused on pushing and thrusting since turning professional. In an interview upon the announcement of his promotion to Juryo in May 2014, Daieish≈ç was quoted as saying he wanted to thrust like former ≈çzeki Chiyotaikai.

It is a Scheduled Monument under the Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Areas Act 1979, list number 1017206. The site is in the Gunners Park and Shoebury Ranges nature reserve, which is managed by the Essex Wildlife Trust. This site is classed by Natural England as a 'slight univallate hillfort'. There are two sections remaining of the defensive banks of the settlement. The surviving part of the north-western arm is around 80 metres long, and it has an average height of 2 metres and width of 11 metres. The southern arm is slightly lower. There was an external ditch, which is now largely buried. Pottery vessels have been found dating to the Middle Iron Age, around 400 to 200 years BCE, together with four round houses and many post holes and pits. There is some evidence of earlier Mesolithic and Bronze Age occupation, but as this extends beyond the site it is thought to represent general utilisation of the area. The site was agricultural land until it was purchased by the Board of Ordnance in 1849, and some of the visible Iron Age remains were probably lost at that time, while other parts have been lost to coastal erosion. There is also evidence of Roman occupation in the south-west corner. The site is called the Danish Camp because it was thought to have been constructed by the Danish Viking leader Haesten, who is reported by the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle to have built a fort at Shoebury in 894, but there is no evidence of Viking occupation. There is public access to the site, which is between Ness Road and Warrior Square Road.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2014. At the time of its nomination it contained 53 resources, which included 41 contributing buildings, and 12 non-contributing buildings. The historic district covers a portion of the city's central business district between the Cedar River on the west and the former right-of-way for the Chicago Great Western Railway on the east. The buildings are generally brick and two stories in height, but there are one- and three-story buildings as well. The first floors continue to house commercial retail stores, while the upper floors house offices, apartments or are vacant. The exceptions are the Chicago Great Western Railway Depot (1904), the Waverly Municipal Hydroelectric Powerhouse (1909), the US Post Office building (1936), and the Lutheran Mutual Aid Society Home Office Building (1932, with later additions). The powerhouse is individually listed on the National Register. The period of significance is from 1855 to 1964, and the buildings are constructed during that time frame.

Lake Minchin is a name of an ancient lake in the Altiplano of South America. It existed where today the Salar de Uyuni, Salar de Coipasa and Lake Poop√≥ lie. It was formerly considered the highest lake in the Altiplano but research indicated that the highest shoreline belongs to the later Lake Tauca instead. The concept of a \\"Lake Minchin\\" was first coined in 1906 and the name is based on John B. Minchin. The dating of the lake varies but probably lasted until 22,000 ‚Äì 21,000 BP. A glacier advance was in progress in the Andes during that timeperiod. The name \\"Minchin\\" has also been used in other contexts, and it has been proposed that the lake was actually a combination of several different paleolakes.  Term  The name \\"Lake Minchin\\" has been used inconsistently to refer to either a lake existing 45,000 years ago, the highest lake in the Altiplano or sediment formations, leading to calls to drop the usage of the name \\"Minchin\\". An alternative theory postulates that Lake Minchin was formed by several lakes, including Ouki and Inca Huasi. Sometimes the term \\"Minchin\\" is also applied to the whole hydrological system Titicaca- Rio Desaguadero-Lake Poopo-Salar de Coipasa-Salar de Uyuni, or to the highest ancient lake in the Altiplano (usually known as Lake Tauca). There are also contradictions between lake level records in different parts of the system.  Context  During its history a number of lakes appeared and then disappeared on the Altiplano. Lake Minchin was one of the first of these ancient lakes to be described. These lakes were identified by the lake terraces, sediments and bioherms. Earlier lakes such as Lake Escara are documented from drill holes in the Salar de Uyuni. Later lakes include Lake Tauca and Lake Coipasa. As early as 1861 there are reports that lake deposits exist on the Altiplano. John B. Minchin in 1882 reported the existence of encrustations around Lake Poopo and the salars south of Coipasa. He postulated a lake with a surface area of left these encrustations and that the nitrate deposits in the Atacama and Tarapaca were likewise formed by water draining for this lake. Some estimates of the size of this lake claimed that it reached from Lake Titicaca as far as 27¬∞ south. The name \\"Lake Minchin\\" was applied in 1906 by Steinmann, who applied it to the Uyuni basin, while naming the lake covering the Poopo and Coipasa basins \\"Lake Reck\\". The name was applied in honour of John B. Minchin. Later it was found that Lake Titicaca was not part of Lake Minchin and the theory was put forward that meltwater from glaciers had formed the lake. A different lake Lake Ballivian was also defined which encompassed Lake Titicaca. The relationship between various deposits in the southern Altiplano and these around Lake Titicaca was unclear at the beginning of the research history.  Lake  Deposits left by Lake Minchin Lake Minchin was a saltwater lake, which covered the basins of the Salar de Uyuni, Salar de Coipasa, Lake Poopo and Salar de Empexa, including the towns of Llica, Oruro and the Desaguadero River valley. The lake had an extension of in east-west direction and of in north- south direction. A sill at Ulloma separated Lake Minchin from Lake Titicaca. Water levels reached an altitude of above sea level, indicating a depth of above the Uyuni basin. In the Poopo basin, water levels may have reached . At Cerro Lipillipi terraces between are dated between 25,700 and 31,750 BP. Another estimate is . Earlier estimates of the altitude are , resulting in depths of . Such water heights exceed these of preceding lakes, and together with even higher water levels of the subsequent Lake Tauca they are part of a trend of increasing water levels in the southern Altiplano which contrasts with progressively decreasing lake levels in the northern Altiplano. Earlier research suggested an opposite trend of lowering water levels in both basins. The surface area of Lake Minchin may have been , or . A lake terrace at is also attributed to Lake Minchin. The highest lake terraces at and were later found to belong to Lake Tauca, making it the deeper of the two lakes. If Minchin reached a water level of it may have spilled into the Pilcomayo River, draining from there via the Rio de la Plata into the Atlantic Ocean. It is also possible that the lake temporarily drained into the Pacific Ocean through its southwesternmost sector at Salar de Ascot√°n; such an outlet would have existed for only a brief time, however, before it was obstructed by volcanism. San Agustin, San Cristobal and Colcha formed islands in the lake, which was separated into a Coipasa half and an Uyuni half by a peninsula of the Serran√≠a Intersalar; straits at Llica and Salinas de Garci Mendoza connected the two halves. Bays developed close to Isluga, Empexa and Ollag√ºe. Sediments left by the lake indicate the presence of gastropods, ostracods and stromatolites. At Estancia Vinto, several different species have been found, including the ostracods Amphicypris, Candonopsis, Darwinula, Limnocythere, Limnocythere bradburyi, Limnocythere titicaca and the molluscs Anysancylus crequii, Ecpomastrum mirum, Littoridina poopoensis, Taphius montanus. Some species variation may indicate that water levels at the site fluctuated; for example the deepwater diatoms Cyclotella meneghiniana and Cyclotella stelligera but also benthic species. Around the lake, Polylepis expanded and quantities of water supported Isoetes and Myriophyllum. In comparison to Lake Tauca, the climate around Lake Minchin was more favourable to the development of vegetation, probably thanks to higher temperatures and a lower water level. On the other hand, the lake may have acted like a barrier and prevented the movement of animals and plants between the south and north of the lake. The repeated expansion and shrinkage of the Altiplano lakes like Minchin influenced the evolution of Orestias fish species. Salt content has been estimated at . It was dominated by NaCl, Na-Cl-CO3 and Na-Cl-SO4, as determined from studies on diatoms; close to the inlet of the Desaguadero River the waters were less salty. When the lake dried up, it left clay and sand deposits in the Altiplano. Also, the volume of about maximum of water induced the ground beneath the lake to sink by about .  Lake chronology  The early research in 1978 distinguished a Lake Minchin between 32,000-30,000 years ago and a later Lake Tauca. The exact history of Lake Minchin was little understood at that time, with uranium-thorium dating yielding ages of 34,000 ‚Äì 44,000 and 68,000 ‚Äì 72,000 years BP. These two phases were also called \\"Upper Minchin\\" and \\"Lower Minchin\\". However, it was later found that radiocarbon dates on these samples indicated much lower ages, from 28,000 years ago to dates too old for radiocarbon dating. Between 31,000 and 26,000 the lake would have reached its highest and around 27,500 BP its second highest level. The drying of the lake did probably occur after about 22,000 BP. Based on sedimentation rates in the Uyuni basin, it is likely that Lake Minchin was not continuous in existence during this timeperiod. Other dates extend the time period of Lake Minchin until 21,000 years BP, or set it earlier at 38,000 years BP, or define it as a humid period between 46,000 - 36,000 years ago or older. Yet another proposal postulates that the earliest deep lake occurred 120,000 ‚Äì 98,000 years ago. Finally, it has been suggested that Lake Minchin was actually the same wet phase as the Inca Huasi wet phase.  Origin  The formation of Lake Minchin was at first explained with glacial meltwater formed during an interglacial. This idea was disputed because the growth of lakes happens at the same time as the growth of glaciers rather than afterwards. An alternative explanation postulates an increase of precipitation over the Altiplano. Higher insolation may have played a role in the expansion of Lake Minchin. Water from Lake Titicaca may have contributed to the formation of Lake Minchin. An old theory that the Altiplano lakes were formerly part of the ocean is considered to be untenable in light of the lack of marine sediments and the fact that the fish fauna is made up of freshwater species.  Related events  A regional glacial maximum has been associated with the existence of Lake Minchin. The Choqueyapu II glacier advance was probably underway during the Lake Minchin phase and eventually led to the local Last Glacial Maximum, and the Canabaya glacier advance in the Cordillera Real may also be linked to the Minchin phase, as are the formation of glaciers on mountains of the Puna and in northern Chile. Summer insolation was increased during the Lake Minchin period. During the Lake Minchin period, precipitation on the Altiplano was higher than today. This precipitation increase started 54,800 years ago, while the time period between Lake Minchin and Lake Tauca featured a dry climate. ENSO variations also occurred during the Minchin period. Minchin is also the name of a highstand of Lake Titicaca at approximately of altitude. The highstand phase there ended about 20,000 BP. During the time of Lake Minchin, water levels in Lake Titicaca rose by about . Water level rises are also recorded from lakes in the southern Lipez region during the time of Lake Minchin and in lesser measure during the time of Lake Tauca, where they may have formed from increased precipitation. The Salar de Atacama likewise was wetter between 53,400 ‚Äì 15,300 years ago. Other phenomena associated with the Lake Minchin period are an increased landslide activity in northwest Argentina, the formation of lakes behind such landslides, a saline phase in the Laguna de los Pozuelos lake, an increase in runoff and of sediment deposition along the Pativilca valley and along the Rio Pisco in Peru as well as probable subsequent erosion.

It is an object designed to encode the asymptotic behaviour of the random walk, i.e. how trajectories diverge when the number of steps goes to infinity. Despite being called a boundary it is in general a purely measure- theoretical object and not a boundary in the topological sense. However, in the case where the random walk is on a topological space the Poisson boundary can be related to the Martin boundary which is an analytic construction yielding a genuine topological boundary. Both boundaries are related to harmonic functions on the space via generalisations of the Poisson formula.  The case of the hyperbolic plane  The Poisson formula states that given a positive harmonic function f on the unit disc \\\\mathbb D = \\\\\\\\{ z \\\\in \\\\mathbb C : z < 1\\\\\\\\} (that is, \\\\Delta f = 0 where \\\\Delta is the Laplace‚ÄìBeltrami operator associated to the Poincar√© metric on \\\\mathbb D) there exists a unique measure \\\\mu on the boundary \\\\partial \\\\mathbb D = \\\\\\\\{ z \\\\in \\\\mathbb C : z = 1\\\\\\\\} such that the equality : f(z) = \\\\int_{\\\\partial \\\\mathbb D} K(z, \\\\xi) \\\\, d\\\\mu(\\\\xi) where K(z, \\\\xi) = \\\\frac {1 - z^2}{\\\\xi - z^2} is the Poisson kernel, holds for all z \\\\in \\\\mathbb D. One way to interpret this is that the functions K(\\\\cdot, \\\\xi) for \\\\xi \\\\in \\\\partial \\\\mathbb D are up to scaling all the extreme points in the cone of nonnegative harmonic functions. This analytical interpretation of the set \\\\partial \\\\mathbb D leads to the more general notion of minimal Martin boundary (which in this case is the full Martin boundary). This fact can also be interpreted in a probabilistic manner. If W_t is the Markov process associated to \\\\Delta (i.e. the Brownian motion on the disc with the Poincar√© Riemannian metric), then the process f(W_t) is a continuous-time martingale, and as such converges almost everywhere to a function on the Wiener space of possible (infinite) trajectories for W_t. Thus the Poisson formula identifies this measured space with the Martin boundary constructed above, and ultimately to \\\\partial \\\\mathbb D endowed with the class of Lebesgue measure (note that this identification can be made directly since a path in Wiener space converges almost surely to a point on \\\\partial \\\\mathbb D). This interpretation of \\\\partial \\\\mathbb D as the space of trajectories for a Markov process is a special case of the construction of the Poisson boundary. Finally, the constructions above can be discretised, i.e. restricted to the random walks on the orbits of a Fuchsian group acting on \\\\mathbb D. This gives an identification of the extremal positive harmonic functions on the group, and to the space of trajectories of the random walk on the group (both with respect to a given probability measure), with the topological/measured space \\\\mathbb D.  Definition  = The Poisson boundary of a random walk on a discrete group = Let G be a discrete group and \\\\mu a probability measure on G, which will be used to define a random walk X_t on G (a discrete-time Markov process whose transition probabilities are p(x, y) = \\\\mu(xy^{-1})); the measure \\\\mu is called the step distribution for the random walk. Let m be another measure on G, which will be the initial state for the random walk. The space G^{\\\\mathbb N} of trajectories for X_t is endowed with the measure \\\\mathbb P_m = m*\\\\mu^{*\\\\mathbb N} (where * denotes convolution of measures). There is also an equivalence relation \\\\sim on G^{\\\\mathbb N}, which identifies (x_t) to (y_t) if there exists n, m \\\\in \\\\mathbb N such that x_{t+n} = y_{t+m} for all t \\\\ge 0 (the two trajectories have the same \\"tail\\"). The Poisson boundary of (G, \\\\mu) is then the measured space \\\\Gamma obtained as the quotient of (G^{\\\\mathbb N}, \\\\mathbb P_m) by the equivalence relation \\\\sim. If \\\\theta is the initial distribution of a random walk with step distribution \\\\mu then the measure u_\\\\theta on \\\\Gamma obtained as the pushforward of \\\\mathbb P_\\\\theta. It is a stationary measure for (G, \\\\mu), meaning that :\\\\int_G u(g^{-1}A) \\\\mu(g) = u_\\\\theta(A). It is possible to give an implicit definition of the Poisson boundary as the maximal G-set with a (G, \\\\mu)-stationary measure u, satisfying the additional condition that (X_t)_* u almost surely weakly converges to a Dirac mass. = The Poisson formula = Let f be a \\\\mu-harmonic function on G, meaning that \\\\sum_{h\\\\in G} f(hg)\\\\mu(h) = f(g). Then the random variable f(X_t) is a discrete-time martingale and so it converges almost surely. Denote by \\\\hat f the function on \\\\Gamma obtained by taking the limit of the values of f along a trajectory (this is defined almost everywhere on G^{\\\\mathbb N} and shift- invariant). Let x \\\\in G and let u_x be the measure obtained by the constriction above with \\\\theta = \\\\delta_x (the Dirac mass at x). If f is either positive or bounded then \\\\hat f is as well and we have the Poisson formula: : f(x) = \\\\int_\\\\Gamma \\\\hat f(\\\\gamma) \\\\, d u_x(\\\\gamma). This establishes a bijection between \\\\mu-harmonic bounded functions and essentially bounded measurable functions on \\\\Gamma. In particular the Poisson boundary of (G, \\\\mu) is trivial, that is reduced to a point, if and only if the only bounded \\\\mu-harmonic functions on G are constant. = General definition = The general setting is that of a Markov operator on a measured space, a notion which generalises the Markov operator f \\\\mapsto \\\\mu*f associated to a random walk. Much of the theory can be developed in this abstract and very general setting.  The Martin boundary  = Martin boundary of a discrete group = Let G, \\\\mu be a random walk on a discrete group. Let p_n(x, y) be the probability to get from x to y in n steps, i.e. \\\\mu^{*n}(x^{-1}y). The Green kernel is by definition: : \\\\mathcal G(x, y) = \\\\sum_{n \\\\ge 1} p_n(x, y). If the walk is transient then this series is convergent for all x, y. Fix a point o \\\\in G and define the Martin kernel by: \\\\mathcal K_o(x, y) = \\\\frac{\\\\mathcal G(x, y)}{\\\\mathcal G(o, y)}. The embedding y \\\\mapsto \\\\mathcal K_o( \\\\cdot, y) has a relatively compact image for the topology of pointwise convergence, and the Martin compactification is the closure of this image. A point \\\\gamma \\\\in \\\\Gamma is usually represented by the notation \\\\mathcal K(\\\\cdot, \\\\gamma). The Martin kernels are positive harmonic functions and every positive harmonic function can be expressed as an integral of functions on the boundary, that is for every positive harmonic function there is a measure u_{o, f} on \\\\Gamma such that a Poisson-like formula holds: : f(x) = \\\\int \\\\mathcal K_o(x, \\\\gamma) \\\\, d u_{o, f}(\\\\gamma). The measures u_{o, f} are supported on the minimal Martin boundary, whose elements can also be characterised by being minimal. A positive harmonic function u is said to be minimal if for any harmonic function v with 0 \\\\le v \\\\le u there exists c \\\\in [0, 1] such that v = cu. There is actually a whole family of Martin compactifications. Define the Green generating series as :\\\\mathcal G_r(x, y) = \\\\sum_{n \\\\ge 1} p_n(x, y)r^n. Denote by R the radius of convergence of this power series and define for 1\\\\leq r \\\\leq R the r-Martin kernel by \\\\mathcal K_{o,r}(x, y) = \\\\frac{\\\\mathcal G_r(x, y)}{\\\\mathcal G_r(o, y)}. The closure of the embedding y \\\\mapsto \\\\mathcal K_{o,r}( \\\\cdot, y) is called the r-Martin compactification. = Martin boundary of a Riemannian manifold = For a Riemannian manifold the Martin boundary is constructed, when it exists, in the same way as above, using the Green function of the Laplace‚ÄìBeltrami operator \\\\Delta. In this case there is again a whole family of Martin compactifications associated to the operators \\\\Delta + \\\\lambda for 0\\\\le \\\\lambda \\\\le \\\\lambda_0 where \\\\lambda_0 is the bottom of the spectrum. Examples where this construction can be used to define a compactification are bounded domains in the plane and symmetric spaces of non- compact type. = The relationship between Martin and Poisson boundaries = The measure u_{o, 1} corresponding to the constant function is called the harmonic measure on the Martin boundary. With this measure the Martin boundary is isomorphic to the Poisson boundary.  Examples  = Nilpotent groups = The Poisson and Martin boundaries are trivial for symmetric random walks in nilpotent groups. On the other hand, when the random walk is non-centered, the study of the full Martin boundary, including the minimal functions, is far less conclusive. = Lie groups and discrete subgroups = For random walks on a semisimple Lie group (with step distribution absolutely continuous with respect to the Haar measure) the Poisson boundary is equal to the Furstenberg boundary. The Poisson boundary of the Brownian motion on the associated symmetric space is also the Furstenberg boundary. The full Martin boundary is also well-studied in these cases and can always be described in a geometric manner. For example, for groups of rank one (for example the isometry groups of hyperbolic spaces) the full Martin boundary is the same as the minimal Martin boundary (the situation in higher-rank groups is more complicated). The Poisson boundary of a Zariski-dense subgroup of a semisimple Lie group, for example a lattice, is also equal to the Furstenberg boundary of the group. = Hyperbolic groups = For random walks on a hyperbolic group, under rather weak assumptions on the step distribution which always hold for a simple walk (a more general condition is that the first moment be finite) the Poisson boundary is always equal to the Gromov boundary. For example, the Poisson boundary of a free group is the space of ends of its Cayley tree. The identification of the full Martin boundary is more involved; in case the random walk has finite range (the step distribution is supported on a finite set) the Martin boundary coincides with the minimal Martin boundary and both coincide with the Gromov boundary.

Sneep was a civil servant working for the Dutch colonial government in a little village in the Sibil Valley. He spoke Malay and a few hundred words of Sibil, and was adept at making contact with inland tribes. In 1958 he had made the Sibil Valley an official Dutch outpost, and in 1959 he joined the expedition that mapped the Star Mountains, until then a white spot on the map. In 1959, he joined the French-Dutch expedition that crossed the island from south to north, across its central mountains. That expedition, whose account is the subject of the documentary film Sky Above and Mud Beneath, found the source of what they called the Princess Marijke River, which they followed as much as possible to descend from the mountains. Sneep got sick with yellow fever in February 1960, during the second leg of the expedition. After the expedition he moved back to the Netherlands, never to return to Papua; he said that seeing the people again, after the handover to Indonesia, would make him too sad.

Early in his career, he was a member of progressive metal band Personal Signet and pop band Popcorn Drama. His first solo album 19 Days in Tetbury was released in March 2014 with the following EPs Gold (2016) and Happiest Accidents (2017) marking a significant shift from pop to more folk and indie rock oriented sound. His second solo album The Hit was released in June 2020.  Career  Peter Aristone studied voice and music production at the Jazz Music Conservatory in Prague going on to become a sound engineer. He mixed and mastered many Czech albums afterwards. After going through a few bands he found success with his pop band Popcorn Drama that recorded an album Vƒçera bude with the renowned Carmen Rizzo producing. After topping a Czech pop chart with the single from the album, Peter disbanded Popcorn Drama to pursue his solo career. While songwriting and recording in studios in London, he met with the producer and frequent collaborator of the Welsh band Manic Street Preachers Greg Haver who then produced Peter's first album 19 Days in Tetbury (2014). It featured a guest appearances by the frontman of Manic Street Preachers James Dean Bradfield, and Melanie C from Spice Girls. After two years of extensive live performing and opening for major Czech and Slovak arena bands, Aristone released EP Gold (2016) that was produced by English producer and songwriter Sacha Skarbek. It was Skarbek who pointed a new direction in Peter's music as the EP represents a major shift to folk sound with indie elements. The eponymous single and the second single Fire Inside found a success in the USA as well as the music video for the former won the MTV U contest. Next EP Happiest Accidents (2017), again being produced by Skarbek and featuring heavier but still similar to Gold style, was released a year later. Both EP's brought him attention in the United States where he toured many times since. In June 2020 a new album The Hit was released. It was written and recorded with an array of international songwriters and musicians as well as Peter's own live band members for the first time. It was produced mainly by Mark Plati, known for being a producer, sound engineer and guitarist for David Bowie and for the first time co-produced by Aristone himself. For the first time Peter's own studio was one of those used for recording and producing the album. As of August 2020 the albums's second single Far was the fifth most played song in the Czech airplay. Apart from being an active musician, Peter is also acclaimed mixer, engineer and producer. He owns and runs recording studio Aristone Studio and in 2020 he launched his own label Funborn-music that seeks to discover and produce emerging artists.

The historic district is a residential area immediately to the south of the Waverly East Bremer Avenue Commercial Historic District, and within the bend of the Cedar River. The primary resources in the district are all houses, and the secondary resources are either carriage houses or garages. All but four houses contribute to the historical significance of the district, but a majority of the secondary resources do not. The houses range in size from single-story cottages to two- story front-gable-and-wing houses and two-story hipped-roof houses. They include a variety of the late 19th century and early 20th century architectural styles, with the Queen Anne and American Craftsman styles dominating the district. Most of the houses are of frame construction, but there are examples of brick and stucco construction as well. Most of the house construction took place between the 1880s and the 1950s. The oldest houses are located on the north side of the district. The secondary buildings date from around 1890 to 2010.

She is featured in Screaming Queens: The Riot at Compton's Cafeteria, a 2005 documentary co- directed and produced by Susan Stryker and Victor Silverman. Elizondo transitioned to female in 1974, while working as a long distance operator. She has worked at a number of other jobs, including receptionist, clerk, and nurse's aid. She was also a sex worker for a time. She has performed as a drag queen for charity, and at gay clubs under the name Felicia Flames. Elizondo was diagnosed as HIV positive in 1987. She has worked for non-profit organizations, including P.A.W.S., Shanti Project, and the San Francisco AIDS Foundation, that seek to improve quality of life for people living with serious illnesses. She has contributed panels to the AIDS Memorial Quilt, and helped raise funds for non-profits including Project Open Hand and the San Francisco LGBT Community Center. As a Latina, she has worked with other transgender women of color to combat racism in the community. Elizondo moved to San Francisco permanently in 1991. In 2014, she worked with San Francisco supervisor Jane Kim to get the 100 block of Turk Street renamed to Vicki Mar Lane in honor of her late friend, drag performer Vicki Marlane.

She was the first Dominican woman to be vice president of the country, during 2000‚Äì2004. She was senator of the Distrito Nacional twice (1994‚Äì1998 and 1998‚Äì2000) and Secretary of State (Minister) for Education of the Dominican Republic, for the same time period she was vicepresident (2000-2004). She was again a candidate for senator from the National District of the Dominican Revolutionary Party (PRD) in the congressional and municipal elections of 2010, being defeated by the candidate of the Dominican Liberation Party Reinaldo Pared P√©rez. In the Dominican Republic general election in 2016 she served as campaign manager for the mayoral candidate of the National District, who would be the winner, David Collado.  Early life and Career  Mar√≠a Milagros Ortiz Bosch was born in Santo Domingo on 26 August 1936 to Virgilio Ortiz Pe√±a (1896-1985) and √Ångela Bosch. When she was a young girl she would hear the name of her uncle Juan Bosch (uncle Juan) mentioned discreetly by many of her relatives. Over time her uncle continued to gain admiration and reverence from her relatives, while attracting enmity from Rafael Trujillo and his regime. = A life out of the ordinary = Ortiz's family lived under constant harassment from the dictatorship. Cali√©s (snitches) would stroll outside the family home with complete confidence, while local vendors and door-to-door trades people were suspected of being informants for the intelligence services of the regime. His uncle Pepito was called all the time for questioning by the SIM (Military Intelligence Service) and there were many occasions when he was jailed for being an enemy of the government and brother of Uncle Juan. In Santa Teresita School, where she studied, Milagros was fortunate that most teachers were opposed to the Trujillo regime. Among them were teachers Maricusa Ornes, Natalia Carmen Dom√≠nguez, Ligia Echavarr√≠a and Pontius Sabater. Santa Teresita was a secular school and was heavily influenced by the humanist school of Eugenio Mar√≠a de Hostos and, by way of consequence, almost all teachers were known by reference or friends of Juan Bosch. The regime era was a difficult period for the family. Some neighbors were persecuted because for befriending Ortiz Bosch. The maternal grandparents of Milagros went into exile after seeking diplomatic protection through their foreign citizenship. Do√±a Angelita's Milagros's mother and sister of Uncle Juan was persecuted, as were her husband and the rest of the family. On one occasion, and as a young teenager, Milagros was called by the mother of a friend whose 15 year birthday celebration was soon to take place. The mother told Ortiz that she could not go to the party because Trujillo's daughter Angelita Trujillo had confirmed her attendance to the same event. She resigned herself as Ortiz was already used to that kind of behaviour by friends, defenders and people wary of the Trujillo regime. Many people simply wanted to be careful not to fall out of favor with \\"The Boss\\", as Trujillo would often be called by his supporters. Even as a child Ortiz's parents and grandparents had warned her that the entire family was classified as not supportive of the regime, so discrimination of this kind was common against Ortiz and her cousins. One particular target was the son of the uncle Juan, Leon Bosch himself, who at the time was also a young man and he had grown up with his grandparents. = The dictatorship falls = On 30 May 1961 surprised Milagros and the whole family in frank conspiracy. Dominican Youth not take it anymore and university groups rebelled. Do√±a Angelita, his mother, still recovering from a stroke suffered a year before learning of the death of the Mirabal Sisters, with whom the Bosch family had narrowed friendship. Do√±a Angelita not withstand the torment that caused an officer recognized the SIM, C√©sar Villeta, threw all sorts of insults against young sisters killed hours earlier by agents of tyranny. Villeta lived outside his home. The celebration of the death of the tyrant and the joy of that event could not be higher, but had to observe caution, as security agencies unleashed their fury like never before against the resistance of the dictatorship. Many hid, not Milagros, who fought as could the Trujillo retentive until July 5, 36 days after the tyrannicide, when arrived at the airport in Punta Caucedo Airport advanced the Dominican Revolutionary Party, the party of Uncle Juan, the national hero, the famous writer, the party leader, the pride of the family ... And while Uncle Juan did not come in person, one of the envoys, Angel Miol√°n brought to \\"Milagritos\\" a very special gift: the book \\"Cuento de Navidad\\" by the uncle dedicated to his beloved niece. That was when she first saws her uncle's letters l. But was eager to meet him personally. = The first meeting = Milagros arrived that morning in early 1962 charged with emotion to San Isidro de Coronado in Costa Rica, to participate in a political training course with more than 70 Dominicans and three Ecuadorians among the latter Rodrigo Borja, then president of Ecuador. She had fallen behind because a companion, Asela Morel, had faced difficulty with their travel papers. The excitement of Milagros was greater than all others: I was going to finally meet Uncle Juan, a professor of that course, and who organized and its return to the motherland as leader of the PRD. When he reached the classroom, Milagros was surprised by the elegance and personality of the man. He was 52 years old, completely white hair, handsome, an extraordinarily handsome, say women type. He was at the head table, next to Jimmy Duran, Washington Pe√±a, Eduardo Tavarez, Antonio Canto, Jos√© Andr√©s Aybar S√°nchez, Arnaldo Senci√≥n and ... who could not miss, Jos√© Francisco Pe√±a G√≥mez. The dream came true. The embrace of Uncle Juan was memorable. The daughter of his sister Angelita was already a woman ... intelligent, beautiful, cultured and ... more than that, their political fan. Along with Pena Gomez and Rodrigo Borja, Milagros was the best course, for the pride of his uncle and leader. = The separation = Since that meeting in Costa Rica, Milagros would become one of the most important in the political life of Juan Bosch, his personal assistant figures, and was at his side in all circumstances of life. The output of Don Juan of the PRD found Milagros in New York, where he walked with his son John on his shoulder, busily seeking healing of his illness. She returned to the country at the call of the leader and immediately joined the work of formation of the new party, the PLD. Don Juan give her the charge of the education department and then entrusted with the task of organization. They spent the first five years, in a long process that caused many misunderstandings and some of the rising desertions of the PLD. Milagros stood beside the leader, but at some point began to realize that was losing its own political and professional identity, her life revolved around no longer the leader, but uncle. They began to weigh more family ties to politicians and supporters. Without even realizing what was happening inside, Milagros suddenly realized that I needed space for his own life. That was evident from the election results of 1978. Milagros was not in accordance with the proposed formula Bosch the country the same May 17 of that year at the outbreak of the crisis by the attempt of the military chiefs of ignoring the results of elections or a government of national unity was formed. The months would determine, thereafter, leaving the PLD and its political aloofness, and forever, Uncle Juan. The process was difficult and painful. Milagros gathered the closest relatives and informed them about their irreversible decision. The die was cast! There was no further explanation. It was not necessary. Many months later Milagros own career began in her old party And he walked. As one who does pinions and then taking its first steps ... until he learned to run his own feet. And he ran ... a lot! She has never uttered a disrespectful or profane word against his beloved uncle Juan. He did while he lived ... And much less after death. Because, for her, Uncle Juan's memory always be sacred.  Senator of the National District  She was senator of the Republic and in such a condition was part of the first National Council of the Magistracy that gave form and life to the current Supreme Court at the same time has made the rest of the judiciary. But its legislative history does not stop there. Since its senatorial seat Milagros promoted important initiatives to institutionalize the Republic, as the Judicial Reform Act, the Education Reform Act, Women Protection Act and so many others.  Vice President and Minister of Education  She was vice president of the Republic for four years, chosen by most of their fellow citizens, and simultaneously held the Ministry of Education, leaving their mark on a management that is conspicuous by its transparency. During the four years (2000‚Äì2004) when he was Vice President of the Republic, occupied the Ministry of Education, president of the National Council on Disability, and on 37 occasions the temporary presidency of the Republic before the exits and travel President. As Secretary of State of Education corresponded to him to sign loan agreements with the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) to establish the Multi-phase Programs for Basic Education and Media. Ortiz Bosch created and led the Strategic Development Plan of Education for the period 2003‚Äì2012, and put into operation the Decentralized Meetings of Education so that they will take care of maintenance of schools. Under his management the first national census was conducted school infrastructure. Among its major contributions include the establishment of TRANSPARENCY software, which allowed the Dominicans and foreigners know through internet all actions of the Ministry of Education (MINERD) in financial matters, including public payroll, purchases, procurement, among others. At different times when she held the interim presidency, she had to make decisions of significance as it was the ouster of then director of National Property, Victor Ti√≥, accused of corruption, the imprisonment of the Dominican consul in Cap-Ha√Øtien, mediate the Agrarian Institute Dominican before the temporary abduction of one of its executives, among other measures. After occupying the Vice Presidency of the Republic in the period 2000‚Äì2004, she was initially opposed the reelection purposes of Hipolito Mejia, although he ended up supporting Ocon some timidez√≥ the candidacy of his party in the presidential elections that marked the return to power of Leonel Fern√°ndez.

The farmstead property, including a barn, sheds, and period landscape elements, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1993. Description and history The Asa May House stands in a rural area of eastern West Fairlee, on the west side of Blood Brook Road. It stands on of land, now reduced from historically larger sizes, but with patterns of usage still evident in the presence of stone walls and foundational remnants of former outbuildings. The current farm complex includes the main house, a horse barn, shed, and woodshed. The house is a two-story wood frame structure, with a hip roof and clapboarded exterior. Its main block is L-shaped, with prominent five-bay facades facing both south and east. The eastern (street- facing) entry is more elaborate, with the door flanked by pilasters and sidelight windows, and topped by an entablature and cornice, while the southern entry is simpler, with a plain surround and four-light transom window. The interior of the house retains original fireplaces and woodwork in many places, although some rooms have been either modernized or repurposed. The crook of the L is filled with a single-story ell, to which further modern additions extend to the west. with The house was built about 1800 for Asa May, who served as the first town clerk of West Fairlee (incorporated 1797). May had acquired land in the Blood Brook area (named for early settler Elijah Blood) and built his first house (located elsewhere on the property and no longer standing) about 1789. The property remained in the hands of May's descendants until 1946.

It is dedicated to Saint Nicholas. Origins Dedication from Stephen's time According to chronicler Grigore Ureche, the church was established by Stephen the Great after the 1485 Battle of CƒÉtlƒÉbuga. While he named the right ktitor, the date is incorrect, and was fixed by Axinte Uricariul, who observed that 1491 is inscribed on the dedication above the entrance. The date of completion is also written there and has largely been read as 1492, including by Nicolae Iorga. Another opinion sides with the earlier reading by Melchisedec »òtefƒÉnescu, suggesting a date of 1493. The building is one of Stephen's city churches: large, tall, with a spire, side apses and an enlarged vestibule. The facade was of unworked stone, with buttresses that reached two-thirds of the walls' height. The exterior was decorated with two rows of recesses, as well as rows of enameled, colored terra-cotta discs representing people and animals. The apses were endowed with large arches. The church was in a trefoil plan, with semicircular apses on the exterior as well as the interior. The walls of the interior were painted and there was a single spire, with an angular roof. A wall separated the nave from the vestibule. CƒÉtƒÉlina Mihalache, History at the Ia»ôi County Cultural Office site In 1593, Trifon Korobeynikov, while passing through the city, noted the church's \\"height and grandeur\\". His description reveals that it had already been modified since Stephen's time: there was a stone bell tower above the entrance. Given the Russian traveler's mention, it is also likely that the church was painted on the exterior during the 16th century. Over the course of the following centuries, other modifications took place: the separating wall between nave and vestibule was replaced by two large stone pillars; and a large foyer was added, twice the size of the church, with a northern and a southern entrance. Two altars were set up in the area, probably during the 18th century, to Saints Barbara and Stephen. Other outbuildings were erected in the churchyard, bounded by a stone wall from the princely court. 17th-19th centuries Wall remnants Over time, the church suffered serious damage, so that in 1677, Prince Antonie Ruset ordered repairs and improvements; this is attested by chroniclers Nicolae Costin, Ion Neculce, Alexandru Amiras and Nicolae Mustea. However, not all the work was completed, and it was only in 1680, under George Ducas, that the interior painting was finished. Many historians believe that Ruset added the large foyer, particularly as he prepared his own grave there. A minority believe it is older, likely from the time of Alexandru LƒÉpu»ôneanu. As no documents mention the structure until 1786, another hypothesis suggests a date from the later part of the 18th century. This was the position taken by the historians' committee that opted for demolition in 1890. The church was hit by fire in 1725, 1753, 1784, 1822, 1827 and 1853, and by an earthquake in 1814, as well as being affected by normal wear and tear. In 1703-1705, it was repaired by Ana, the wife of Prince Mihai Racovi»õƒÉ; Prince Ioan Teodor Callimachi undertook repairs in 1758 and Scarlat Callimachi during his 1812-1819 reign. A document of March 1677 indicates that Antonie Ruset had decided, together with Metropolitan Dosoftei, to turn the church into a second seat for the Moldavia Metropolis, alongside that in Suceava. So it remained until another metropolitan see was built in 1695. While the chronicles indicate Ruset prepared his grave here, he died poor in Constantinople, and Prince Constantin Cantemir was placed in his crypt for a time. Others were subsequently buried there, very likely members of the princely families; several graves were removed from the narthex during the 1884 restoration. The church was the scene of welcoming ceremonies for princes who entered Ia»ôi in order to take up the throne, and many of them were anointed there during a ceremony described by Dimitrie Cantemir. The great religious feasts of the year were also celebrated in the church for the benefit of the royal court. The final anointment was that of Grigore Alexandru Ghica, in October 1849. The church is associated with the activity of Dosoftei, who ran a printing press there. One of the works he put out was a renowned Lives of the Saints from 1681 to 1686. However, after Dosoftei was taken to Poland, the printing press petered out and the next one was not set up until the time of Iacov Putneanul, in the middle of the following century. Moreover, it functioned in a different location, the courtyard of the current cathedral. The school from the Saint Nicholas Church, begun by Constantine Mavrocordatos and by Metropolitan Nechifor, was reorganized by Iacov, eventually becoming among Moldavia's most renowned. It lasted until the early 19th century as among the few institutions where Romanian was the language of instruction; pupils were taught writing, reading, grammar and liturgical music. The church was endowed with books, vestments and furniture that gradually disappeared. For example, when John III Sobieski took Dosoftei with him to Poland in 1686, he brought all the church's precious objects and clothing. Donors would constantly replenish the collection, which was fairly complete according to an 1803 inventory. When it was restored, all the church's remaining objects were divided among the city's other churches. This is how two 18th-century bells, repaired in 1817, ended up first in the cathedral yard and then behind Trei Ierarhi Monastery. It appears that when Sultan Mehmed IV spent a week in Ia»ôi in July 1672 while on the way to Poland, the church was used as a mosque and then remained closed until Ruset's renovation. Unusually, from the late 18th century, the church had three altars (some sources speak of two chapels), where the liturgy was officiated in three languages (Romanian, Greek and Slavonic). By the time the restoration was agreed upon, it had five dedications: Saints Nicholas, Barbara, Stephen, Mina and Catherine. Restoration After 1880, serious discussions about a restoration began. The building was in a very poor condition, particularly the added foyer, made of carved stone and irregularly- shaped boulders, the wooden ties of which had rotted. The limestone had oxidized and burst during fires, while the entire structure showed earthquake damage. The corners, particularly on the south face, showed enormous cracks. The French architect Andr√© Lecomte du Nou√ø was selected to lead the restoration work, assisted by Nicolae Gabrielescu. Operations began in 1884, when the 18th-century addition was demolished. Mihail KogƒÉlniceanu and others asked that this instead be rehabilitated, but the committee on historic monuments ultimately decided that only Stephen's original church should be restored. Moreover, Lecomte du Nou√ø agreed with complete demolition due to the degraded condition of the masonry. Reconstruction began in 1888, with a view toward a final form that expressed the artistic ideals of Stephen's era. From the annexes, only a nearby wall fragment surrounding the church was left standing. Lecomte du Nou√ø returned to the church's initial plan, placing the walls and the spire in one vertical sweep and eliminating the buttresses, thus giving the whole a much more sleek appearance. The exterior walls, above the stone base, were decorated with panels of visible brick and with traditional Moldavian elements such as rows of niches, discs of glazed and colored ceramic and large recesses. The interior, including the iconostasis, furniture and painting, was completely redone. Fragments of 17th-century painting that depicted Ruset, Duca and their families were saved; for a time, they were kept in the Old Metropolitan Cathedral, then in the Gothic hall of Trei Ierarhi before probably ending up in a museum. The new painting was done by three French artists in a neo-Byzantine style that deviates from the previous iconographic layout. Notable are the idealized portrait of the first founder, Stephen and the second, King Carol I of Romania. The latter is shown with his queen, Elisabeth of Wied; Crown Prince Ferdinand and his wife Marie; and the three children the couple had at the time: Carol, Elisabeth and MƒÉrioara. The symbolic significance of the paintings is underscored by the presence of traditional Romanian costume in the allegorical figures surrounding the king and in the children. Although subject to criticism, the idealized reconstruction became a prototype for other monuments built or restored over the coming years. For example, Nicolae Ghica-Bude»ôti drew inspiration from the project. The church was blessed in October 1904, during national celebrations marking 400 years since Stephen's death. For the 1906 Bucharest jubilee, it was reproduced in its entirety as a symbol of Carol's achievements. Today, the church functions as a chapel of Trei Ierarhi. It is listed as a historic monument by Romania's Ministry of Culture and Religious Affairs, as are the wall fragments. Lista Monumentelor Istorice 2010: Jude»õul Ia»ôi File:Biserica Sf.

The high-end version is the SolarPuff solar lantern, while the more economical version is the SolarHelix solar lantern. Each lantern includes a solar panel, a rechargeable lithium polymer battery, and 10 LEDs. Exposing the solar panel to bright sunlight for about 8 hours charges the battery. A button on the lantern switches between off, low, high and blinking. A fully charged lantern can provide 100 lumens of light for up to 8‚Äì12 hours. The SolarPuff lantern (expanded 4.5 x 4.5 x 4.5 inches, 2.9 oz (shipping weight 3.2 oz.), flat pack to 0.25 inches) is larger than the SolarHelix lantern (expanded 4.3 x. 4.3 x.4.3 inches, 3 oz (shipping weight 3.5 oz.), flat pack to 0.5 inches). The SolarPuff lantern's material, that functions as a light diffuser, is very high quality sailcloth used for upscale ship sails. The Solar Helix lantern's material is flexible, recyclable TPU (thermoplastic polyurethane).  History  Solight Design's co-founder, Alice Chun, is an architecture professor interested in solar-powered light. As explained in Chun's 2016 TEDx talk, in dealing with her son's asthma ‚Äìabout 10% of children in New York have asthma ‚ÄìChun realized that poor air quality caused by pollutants was a growing problem, motivating Chun to find ways to incorporate solar power into daily living. In 2008, Chun made experimental inflatable units having a solar panel, battery, LEDs, and fabric light diffuser; these experimental units were used in her studies for \\"skins\\" of buildings. Chun received a 2008 Brunner Grant from the Center for Architecture Foundation to explore energy efficient building skins. After the 2010 earthquake in Haiti, Chun challenged students in her design studio class at Columbia University‚Äôs Graduate School of Architecture to develop solutions for disaster relief that would help an individual, instead of city-sized or building-sized solutions that architecture students usually consider. Chun realized her experimental units could serve as individual solar lanterns. Chun's students contributed the concept of a handle. Chun and her students filed a patent application for her inflatable solar lamp. Chun's students were inspired to create their own company selling inflatable solar lanterns, LuminAID. In 2010, Chun founded a non-profit organization, Studio Unite, renamed to FAARM (Focus on Architecture Art Research Making), to help use architectural approaches to disaster relief and people lacking electricity. Some people lacking electricity use kerosene, with devastating effects to their health. While helping via FAARM, Chun met Dr./Ambassador Alison Thompson, who is now the executive director of FAARM. alt=Full-time volunteer, Dr. Alison Thompson is handing a Syrian family a solar lantern called SolarPuff to light their dark tent at the Idomeni refugee camp in Greece. 2015 alt=With no electricity in refugee camps in Idomeni Greece; Mother holds her solar lantern called the SolarPuff to check on her 2 little boys sleeping in sleeping bags.

Chun realized that her inflatable solar lantern could be improved by eliminating the mouth nozzle, which could transfer germs orally, and then invented the origami-like folding SolarPuff solar lantern, which does not require mouth inflation. A patent for her folding solar lantern was granted to Chun in 2015. In 2011, Chun founded Material Intelligence Project, Inc. (MIP), renamed to Solight Design, Inc. with Stacy Kelly as co-founder, to market her SolarPuff solar lanterns. FAARM has distributed Solight Design's SolarPuff solar lanterns to Cameroon, Ecuador, Ghana, Haiti, Liberia, Nepal, Senegal, Greece, Turkey and Syria, bringing much-appreciated light to poor people and disaster victims. In 2015, Solight Design began offering the more economical SolarHelix solar lantern. In 2015, the New York Times advised its readers that the SolarPuff solar lantern is a good gift. In 2015, Solight Design operated a Kickstarter fundraising campaign, achieving 1200% of its funding goal as one of Kickstarter‚Äôs featured projects, raising $446,940 to fulfill backer's pledges and to send solar lanterns to earthquake victims in Nepal and to an orphanage in Haiti. In 2015, Solight Design provided solar lanterns for Malala Yousafzai's talk at the opening day of the United Nations Sustainable Development Summit. In 2016, Solight Design provided solar lanterns for FAARM's 10 Million Rays of Light benefit concert.

Italian surnames were changing at the time, as the older system of male, female, and plural suffixes gradually gave way to the modern system whereby the plural \\"-i\\" suffix is used consistently throughout. The family therefore used both variants of their surname - Molteno and Molteni.http://www.cinematheque.fr/fr/catalogues/appareils/collection/lanterne- magiqueap-10-2534.html Antoine Molteni - Career From his premises at 11 rue du Coq Saint-Honor√©, Molteni ran his enterprise for the coming decades, from what became known as the \\"Maison Molteni\\". On 2 April 1817 he drastically expanded the company, together with Joseph Duroni, to include further workshops and stores such as at Palais-Royal. Molteni began working closely with Louis Daguerre in the 1830s, after they were introduced by Alphonse Giroux. Molteni made the first devices used by Daguerre in 1839, and they continued to work together until the Molteni family moved to the new No. 36 rue Saint-Nicolas in 1846 (which became No. 62 rue du Ch√¢teau d'Eau in 1851). They kept their strong interest in photography, but expanded to include a range of precision instruments. Their factory and warehouses were located on the same street, where their steam engines, rolling mills and metal smelters served the laboratories and manufacturing lines.¬´ Le principal but auquel ont tendu les efforts des diff√©rents chefs de cette maison a √©t√© d‚Äôobtenir la plus grande somme d‚Äô√©conomie dans la fabrication, sans l√©ser toutefois les int√©r√™ts des ouvriers, dont le nombre s‚Äô√©l√®ve √† 350 environ, et sans nuire √† la qualit√© des produits qui se sont au contraire toujours am√©lior√©s‚Ä¶ Les moyens m√©caniques ainsi employ√©s permettent de remplacer avec une grande pr√©cision et une immense √©conomie de temps le travail manuel et toujours lent des ouvriers dont toute l‚Äôhabilet√© a pu √™tre mise √† profit pour l‚Äôex√©cution d‚Äôautres travaux inabordables aux machines. ¬ª The Molteni family also designed and built naval & marine instruments, mathematical, geodesic and measuring devices, photography apparatus and many of the early lighting systems. Antoine Molteni married Marie Madeleine Alexandrine Saucli√®res (d. 26 Jan 1855), and the couple had two sons: Pierre Marie Joseph and Louis Jules, and a daughter Jos√©phine √âmilie (married the merchant Jacques Eus√®be Pougeois).Death notice of Marie Alexandrine Saucli√®res Successors From 24 December 1836, Antoine brought his eldest son Pierre Marie Joseph Molteni (1811-1852) into active management of the business. He then brought an employee who was very close to the family, Ferdinand Siegler, in as a partner in September 1841. The result was the founding of Molteni and Co. (\\"Molteni & Cie\\") on 2 September 1841; a firm dedicated to the design and manufacture of optics, physics and mathematical equipment. Meanwhile, his second son, Jules Molteni, launched an unprecedented expansion in 1843. New stores opened in 62 Rue du Chateau-d'Eau in 1852 and 53, (later to move up the street to number 44 in 1872). Joseph Molteni died (aged 62) on 10 December 1852, and Jules ran the firm alone for a while, under Antoine's guidance. In 1863 Jules and his elderly father brought Joseph's son Fran√ßois Marie Alfred Molteni (1837 - 1907), and the firm became known as \\"J. &. A. Molteni\\". Already from 1865 the dynamic Alfred played the most active role, and after Jules died on 25 May 1876, he directed the firm alone until 1899, when he handed it over to Radiguet and Massiot in 1899.

CCPC grew to a network of 21 neighbourhood depots throughout the city, cleared twice weekly by volunteers. With this expansion, and involvement with related environmental issues, CCPC membership rapidly grew to 1,000. The City of Burlington donated a recycling centre for CCPC's recycling program in 1971. Later, a larger building replaced the original recycling centre and remained in use until 1983. CCPC collaborated with the Government of Ontario and the City of Burlington in a pilot project to test public participation in a curbside pickup program from August 1971 to February 1972, with more than one thousand households. Materials collected were tin, glass, aluminum, cardboard and newspaper. The CCPC program proceeded as usual in the rest of the city during the months of the Pilot Study. A final report on the study was published by the Ontario Government under the title \\"Burlington Waste Reclamation Pilot Study\\". From its inception, CCPC had actively promoted the importance of government being responsible for recycling. There was no model for municipal recycling programs for Burlington to follow, but in 1977, Mayor Mary Munro established a Mayor's Task Force to consider the practicalities of running this type of program in the City of Burlington. Two CCPC Coordinators were part of the Task Force as Subcommittee Chairs. The results were formally reported to the City of Burlington. In 1981, the City of Burlington hired a contractor, becoming the first city in Ontario to run an ongoing curbside recycling program.Orde, Mary.

A supporter of women running for local elections as a springboard to gaining national voting rights, she ran for office on the Bolton School Board and was successful in her second attempt in 1899. She also ran for office as a Poor Law Guardian, and was successful, but was defeated in her attempt to become a member of the borough council. As a textile worker, Reddish knew first-hand the conditions and wages women experienced and joined unions, working as a paid organiser to help women improve their situations. She was both a socialist and a radical feminist, urging women's equality in the public sphere. Early life Sarah Reddish was born in 1850 in Bolton, Greater Manchester, England into a working-class family. Her father was a prominent member of the local Co-operative Society, serving as the honorary librarian and secretary of the society's Bolton branch. Leaving school at age eleven, Reddish began working at home, winding silk for her mother and neighbour's weavings. Career In the 1860s, Reddish began working in a cotton mill as a reeler and winder. In addition to her work, she was required to provide assistance for those who were accidentally injured by the machinery. She eventually became foreman at a hosiery mill. Cooperation In 1879, Reddish joined the Co-operative Society and developed a reputation in both the local and national organisations. By 1886, she was president of the Bolton Women's Co-operative Guild and served in that capacity until 1906. Between 1889 and 1891 and then again between 1895 and 1898, Reddish was elected to serve on the central committee of the Guild. In the intervening years, from 1893 to 1895 she was appointed to be regional organiser of northern England's Women's Co-operative Guild, as its first paid organiser. Reddish served as national president of the Guild in 1897. Reddish brought suffrage speakers into the organisational meetings and campaigned for wage improvements of women employees. Suffrage As a proponent of women holding local offices, believing that would help in their claim for the larger vote, she ran as a member of the Bolton School Board in 1897 but was defeated. When a board member resigned in 1899, she expected to be appointed to fill the term based on the custom that the defeated candidate who had received the most votes in the prior election filled unexpired terms. Though the board refused to appoint her because she was a woman, Reddish ran successfully later that year for the post. She continued serving until at least 1907. Reddish joined the Clarion Movement and the Independent Labour Party in 1896, travelling with the first women's Clarion van tour. The tours allowed Reddish to use her public-speaking skills at public meetings where women discussed the value of socialism. Two years later when the Independent Labour Party fused with the Social Democratic Party, Reddish urged members to join the Bolton Socialist Party. As with her politics, Reddish believed in equality throughout the public sphere for women. She urged in her union reports for men to become more active in home duties and for women to develop their civic roles. She belonged to that group of radical feminists who pushed for full equality, classifying their sex as a disability. By 1899, her concern for providing support for women workers led her to become an organiser for the Women's Trade Union League. Her focus with the Trade Union League was to improve both wages and conditions for working women. Between 1900 and 1901, Reddish helped circulate petitions for women's voting rights among factory workers and she was the one chosen to present the final compiled petition, which contained nearly 30,000 signatures, to Parliament. The campaign spurred wool workers in Yorkshire, as well as cotton and silk workers from north Cheshire to hold a similar petition drive. Reddish pushed the Guild to support enfranchisement and in 1904 at its annual conference, the Women's Cooperative Guild voted in favour of backing the pending franchise bill. She served as an organiser for the North of England Society for Women's Suffrage between 1903 and 1905 and occasionally worked as a paid organiser for the National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies in London. In 1903, Reddish became a founding member of the Lancashire and Cheshire Women Textile and Other Workers Representation Committee, along with Selina Cooper, Sarah Dickenson, Eva Gore-Booth and Esther Roper. The group, for which she would later serve as treasurer, was formed evaluate parliamentary candidates and select those who would fight for voting rights of women workers. She wrote articles, including Women and County Borough Councils: a Claim for Eligibility (1903) and Women and the Franchise: A Claim for Its Extension (1904) which put forward her views and were distributed in local newspapers. In 1905, Reddish ran for office as a Poor Law Guardian, having served on the committee of the Bolton Association for the Return of Women as Poor Law Guardians since 1897. She won the election and served as a Guardian until 1921. Reddish ran for borough council for the Halliwell Ward of Bolton in 1907, though she was unsuccessful. Later that same year, she went to Ghent and Brussels to study child care initiatives being launched in Belgium and upon her return, established the School for Mothers in Bolton. In 1911, she became president of the Manchester and Salford Women's Trade Society. She served as a delegate to the 1915 Women's International League for Peace and Freedom conference in The Hague and then in 1919 Reddish organised the Bolton Women's Citizens Association. In the 1920s, illness forced her to curtail her activism. Reddish died on 19 February 1928 at Townleys Hospital of Farnworth, Lancashire and was buried in the Heaton Cemetery on Bolton Wood Road.

The road briefly curves straight north between West Carroll Street/East Carroll Street and South Alice Street, then runs northeast again. At East Cottonwood Road it is joined by Alabama State Route 53, and all four routes run straight north, only to make a slight north-northwest turn at Washington Avenue.

Citibank had received money from the Troubled Asset Relief Program to put money into home equity, in order to prop up the housing market after the sub-prime mortgage crisis. Swanson had visited the bank, and was told she should apply along with her husband. She had refused to answer a question about race, but the bank employee pointed to a photo of his family who were part African-American also. Swanson disclosed that Washington Mutual Bank previously had denied her a home-equity loan. After Swanson applied to the bank, a preliminary home valuation was $240,000. Then an appraiser, Andre Lanier who worked for PCI Appraisal Services, visited the home and valued it at $170,000.

The game was released for Microsoft Windows and Xbox One in August 2016, PlayStation 4 released in January 2017, Nintendo Switch in February 2020, and Stadia in May 2020. Gameplay The Turing Test is a puzzle video game with gameplay experienced from a first- person perspective. The player assumes the role of Ava Turing, an International Space Agency (ISA) engineer working at a research station located on Europa, one of Jupiter's moons. The puzzles involve distributing power through a special tool that can collect and fire power spheres into special receptacles to unlock doors or activate other machinery in the game. As the player progresses, additional elements are introduced, including the ability to observe scenes and activate certain objects via the station's monitoring cameras, and control mobile robots that can be used to explore levels. Plot In the far future, engineer Ava Turing is one of several members of a research team sent via the International Space Agency (ISA) to excavate Jupiter's moon Europa. While Ava remains in cryogenic slumber, the other team members are woken and travel to the moon to set up their base and begin conducting their studies, with Ava scheduled to wake once the base is completed. Sometime later, Ava is awoken by the Technical Operations Machine (T.O.M.), an artificial intelligence that monitors the project. T.O.M. tells Ava that her crewmates are in danger and she needs to go down there to help them out. She sets out in a lander and enters the base on Europa. T.O.M. sees that the base's internal configuration has changed from their records, whereby to progress further into the complex, Ava must complete various tests, designed as puzzles. As Ava gets deeper in the complex, T.O.M. determines some of the team members are already dead and the others need their help, urging Ava to move faster. As the tests get harder, T.O.M. realizes that these are designed to be solved by a combination of human and artificial intelligence, a manner similar to that of the actual Turing test. They enter an area where one of the remaining crew-members, Sarah, warns Ava over the communication systems that she is actually being controlled by T.O.M. due to a special chip implanted in her hand when they left for the mission. Sarah directs Ava to a Faraday cage, which temporarily frees Ava of the control from T.O.M., revealing in the process that the player has not been playing as Ava, but as T.O.M., who has been controlling Ava. However, T.O.M. manages to convince Ava that the two of them need to continue to work together to save their colleagues. Though angered by the intrusion of T.O.M. into her body, Ava continues onward, allowing T.O.M. to reassert control over her body. T.O.M. eventually reveals that the Europa ground team had found a microorganism within the depths of the moon that could be used to infinitely regenerate DNA; this could potentially make humans immortal, but also infinitely regenerate bacteria and viruses. When ISA learned of this discovery, they ordered T.O.M. to take whatever actions needed to make sure the Europa team could never return to Earth, initially by taking actions such as trying to starve them to death or lock them outside the base, but eventually by using the hand chip implants to control them. The surface crew realized they were being controlled, and those that did not die from T.O.M.'s actions found a way to rid the chip from their body, including in one case severing their entire arm. With no way to control the Europa crew, ISA ordered T.O.M. to wake Ava and send her to prevent the others from returning. Completing the last of the tests set up by the surface crew, Ava finds Sarah in person, and she offers to remove the hand chip from Ava; Ava agrees. The two realize the only way to get off Europa is to stop T.O.M. and they begin to disable his databases. T.O.M. is no longer able to control Ava, but he retains control over his sentry weapons, which he can either use to kill Sarah and Ava, ensuring that the organism will not leave Europa, or do nothing, eventually leading to the end of T.O.M. and allowing Ava and Sarah to escape. Regardless of the player's decision, the test will result as \\"passed\\". Development and release In 2015, UK-based studios Deco Digital and Bevel Studios released their first- person puzzle game, Pneuma: Breath of Life. Towards the end of the year, the two studios merged to form Bulkhead Interactive, the developer of The Turing Test. The game was developed using Unreal Engine 4. The Turing Test was in a pre-production phase for six months, where the designers created puzzles and defined the gameplay curve. The game was in full production for a further year. Creative producer Howard Philpott cited Croteam's 2014 puzzle game, The Talos Principle, as a reference point for the progression of introducing gameplay mechanics in The Turing Test. The game was published by Square Enix as part of their indie initiative, Square Enix Collective. The game was released for Windows and Xbox One on 30 August 2016. The PlayStation 4 version was released on 23 January 2017. The Nintendo Switch version was set for release on 7 February 2020. Reception The Turing Test received \\"generally favourable\\" reviews, according to review aggregator Metacritic.

This form of Legendre's relation expresses the fact that the Wronskian of the complete elliptic integrals (considered as solutions of a differential equation) is a constant. Elliptic functions Legendre's relation stated using elliptic functions is : \\\\omega_2 \\\\eta_1 - \\\\omega_1 \\\\eta_2 = 2\\\\pi i \\\\, where œâ1 and œâ2 are the periods of the Weierstrass elliptic function, and Œ∑1 and Œ∑2 are the quasiperiods of the Weierstrass zeta function. Some authors normalize these in a different way differing by factors of 2, in which case the right hand side of the Legendre relation is i or i / 2\\\\. This relation can be proved by integrating the Weierstrass zeta function about the boundary of a fundamental region and applying Cauchy's residue theorem.

Including the town common as well as a few buildings and an adjacent cemetery, it is a well- preserved example of a village bypassed by economic development during the 19th century industrial period. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1990. Description and history The small town of Stockbridge was chartered in 1761, but was not settled until the 1780s. At that time Elias Keyes was granted land in the town, on the condition that he build a saw mill and grist mill. He chose a site on the White Riverfor the mills, a few miles above its confluence with the Tweed River. On a terrace north of the mill site he began to build a house, and gave land for use as the town common and cemetery; this area became what is now the village of Stockbridge Common. Although the village has some of the trappings of a town center, including a church and district schoolhouse, it was not economically successful, owing to its distance from the river and its placement on a rise above more convenient travel routes along the river. The village was eclipsed in the 19th century by the village of Gaysville, located on the White River, whose industries were decimated by Vermont's devastating 1927 floods. with The historic district is centered on the town common, which is surrounded by Stockbridge Common Road and Maplewood Road, the latter separating it from the Maplewood Cemetery to the south. Lining the north side of Stockbridge Common Road and the westernmost part of Maplewood are six 19th-century buildings that make up the district along with the common and cemetery. Included are the house begun by Keyes and completed by Seth Wright c. 1804, a massive example of Federal period architecture, and the 1826 Union Church, a vernacular Greek Revival building built on land donated by Keyes. The former district schoolhouse, built in 1884, is one of the newest buildings in the district.

Early life Iye Roy Mackay, 10th of Strathnaver, was the eldest son of Angus Roy Mackay, 9th of Strathnaver, and his wife who was a daughter of Mackenzie of Kintail, chief of Clan Mackenzie. Feud with the Rosses Map showing the Mackay chief's territory of Strathnaver in relation to Caithness, Sutherland and Ross to the south Iye Roy Mackay's father, Angus Roy Mackay, had been killed in 1486 at the Battle of Tarbat in a feud over lands with the Clan Ross. Soon after this the Mackays, under John Rivach Mackay (second son of Angus Roy Mackay) and William Mackay who was the chieftain of the Mackay of Aberach branch of the clan, invaded Ross and defeated the Clan Ross at the Battle of Aldy Charrish in 1487 where Alexander Ross of Balnagown, chief of the Rosses was killed, along with seventeen other landed gentlemen of the province of Ross.Mackay, Angus. (1906). The Book of Mackay. p. 70. Quoting: Gordon, Sir Robert, A Genealogical History of the Earldom of Sutherland. Quoting the Fern Abbey MS (manuscript). Historian Angus Mackay however disputes the account given by Sir Robert Gordon, 1st Baronet, who himself was a son of Alexander Gordon, 12th Earl of Sutherland, and who says that at this battle the Mackays were supported by a force provided by the Earl of Sutherland.Mackay, Angus. (1906). The Book of Mackay. pp. 70 - 71. Quoting: Gordon, Sir Robert, A Genealogical History of the Earldom of Sutherland. Mackay states that the feudal superiority of the Earls of Sutherland over the Mackays, as claimed by Sir Robert Gordon, \\"nowhere existed save in his own fertile imagination\\". Angus Mackay says that it is also unlikely that the Earl of Sutherland who was married to a daughter of Ross of Balnagown would have assisted against his own father-in-law. Thirdly, Angus Mackay says that the Earls of Sutherland are not mentioned in a remission from the king to John Rivach Mackay in 1494, and so it seems that Sir Robert Gordon had tried to snatch the victory of the Mackays over the Rosses at Aldy Charrish, but that the facts are against him. In 1490 James IV of Scotland granted to David Ross, nephew and heir of John Ross, and grandson of John Ross of Balnagown, the lands of Strathoikel and Strathcarron, which had formerly belonged to Morgan Neilson Mackay. Likewise, on 15 March 1504, Iye Roy Mackay 10th of Strathnaver secured from the king the lands of Ferencostrig, Strathhalladale, Creichmore, Assent, Coigach, Gruids and Strathfleet. On 15 February, 1506, Iye Roy Mackay caused the charter that had been granted by Donald of Islay, Lord of the Isles in 1415 to the Mackays who laid claim to these lands. However, the Lords of Council decided that the lands had belonged to Euphemia II, Countess of Ross. Although John Rivach Mackay received a remission from the king in 1494, the blood feud with the Rosses appears to have continued as David Ross of Balnagown and Iye Roy Mackay of Strathnaver were summoned to appear before the Earl of Argyll who was the Lord High Chancellor of Scotland. On 4 October 1496, each of them were bound by extending their hand to Argyll in the king‚Äôs name to keep the peace towards each other and that their \\"folks sal be harmless and skaithles\\", under the penalty of 500 merks if they failed. Notwithstanding the apparent reconciliation, David Ross of Balnagown and his brother Hucheon Ross, brought an action to the Lords of Council against the Mackays for spoils taken from their lands eight years earlier. Apprehension of Sutherland of Dirlot Sutherland of Dirlot who was Iye Roy Mackay‚Äôs nephew and who was pursued for some debts by Sir James Dunbar of Cumnock, murdered his relative, Alexander Dunbar, who in turn was the step-father of John, Earl of Sutherland. In consequence Sutherland of Dirlot was \\"put to the horn\\". Iye Roy Mackay was already bound to the king's service for maintenance and order and received a commission to apprehend Sutherland of Dirlot, and did so. Mackay was rewarded by a charter under the Great Seal of Scotland dated 4 November, 1499, for the lands of Dirlot, Farr, Armadale, Strathy, Rennvie, Davach, Lochnaver, Davach Eriboll, all in Strathnaver, and also Kinald, Golspie, and Kilcolumkill in Sutherland, and also Dirlot, Cattack, Bronach, two pennylands of Stroma, all in Caithness. Historian Angus Mackay says that Sutherland of Dirlot being a nephew of Iye Roy Mackay, his apprehension does seem heartless, but justifies it by the fact that Sutherland of Dirlot had by some means been able to get hold of lands in Strathnaver that had previously belonged to the Mackay family. Rebellion of Donald Dubh Towards the end of the 15th-century and at the beginning of the 16th-century, the king of Scotland who was irritated at the misconduct of the Hebrideans, cancelled many charters of the leading families which caused them to revolt. Around the same time Donald Dubh, grandson of John of Islay, Earl of Ross and Lord of the Isles, escaped from imprisonment on Innis Chonnell. Donald Dubh put himself at the head of the discontented confederates and it took three expeditions in 1503, 1505, and 1506 to quell the tumult. Historian Angus Mackay states that Iye Roy Mackay of Strathnaver, in all of these expeditions, did most effective work at the head of his clan. This included capturing Torquil, chief of the Clan MacLeod of Lewis, who the Parliament of 1505 had found guilty of treason. The Earl of Huntly, Mackay and others battered Stornoway Castle with artillery, after which MacLeod was taken prisoner. The king rewarded \\"Y Mackay\\" with extensive lands for helping to crush the Hebrideans in a charter dated 15 March 1504. However, it is Clan Cameron tradition that they defeated a joint force of Mackays and Munros at the Battle of Achnashellach in 1505, the Cameron chief having supported the rebellion of Donald Dubh. Battle of Flodden According to the Blackcastle MS (which was written by Alexander Mackay of Blackcastle who had access to the Mackay chief‚Äôs family charters and papers) when James IV of Scotland resolved to invade England, Iye Roy Mackay of Strahtnaver accompanied by his brother John Rivach Mackay, at the head of a contingent from Strathnaver, fought at the Battle of Flodden in 1513.Mackay, Angus. (1906). The Book of Mackay. p. 76. Quoting: Mackay, Alexander, Blackcastle Manuscript. Iye Roy Mackay escaped with his life, but his brother John was killed along with a number of clansmen. Relations with the Earl of Sutherland Shortly before his death, Iye Roy Mackay joined a band of friendship with Adam Gordon, Earl of Sutherland dated 31 July 1517. Historian Angus Mackay disputes the account given by Sir Robert Gordon, who himself was a son of Alexander Gordon, 12th Earl of Sutherland, and who Mackay says makes it appear that Mackay was acting as a vassal to his superior. Likewise, historian Sir William Fraser states that Sir Robert Gordon describes it as if it was granted by an inferior to a superior which is not the case, and that the agreement, except for the acknowledged fact that Earl Adam was Mackay‚Äôs overlord in certain lands, is in fact a transaction between equals.Mackay, Angus. (1906). The Book of Mackay. p. 77. Quoting: Fraser, Sir William, The Sutherland Book. Family Iye Roy Mackay, 10th of Strathnaver, married a \\"celebrated beauty\\" who was a daughter of Norman, son of Patrick O‚ÄôBeolan of Carloway on the Isle of Lewis. O‚ÄôBeolan was the lineal descendant of the family of Applecross, a well known priestly family whose progenitor was St. Maolrubha. This marriage did not conform with canon law, but Iye Roy Mackay secured from James IV of Scotland a precept of legitimation for his two surviving sons, John and Donald. Iye Roy Mackay and his wife had the following children: #John Mackay, 11th of Strathnaver, who succeeded his father in 1517. #Donald Mackay, 11th of Strathnaver, who succeeded his brother John in 1529. #Angus Mackay, who was killed fighting the Rosses, near Tain, before 1511. #A daughter, who married Hugh MacLeod of Assynt and had two children: Neil and Helen.

Self-released by Banks on January 25, 2013 through DatPiff, it was originally intended to be a pre-release bonus for Banks' second solo studio album, Banks (2012). In contrast to Interpol's rock music sound and Banks's solo work, the mixtape features hip hop tracks and lo-fi hip hop instrumentals, all produced by Banks. It also features guest appearances from rappers El-P, Talib Kweli, High Prizm, and Mike G. Critical reception Pitchfork critic Jayson Greene panned the mixtape, writing that none of the tracks from the record \\"is remotely salvageable\\". Greene also compared the instrumentals to those \\"on YouTube made by well-meaning college sophomores\\", concluding that there is \\"no effort, vision, or craft in this music\\".

The reserve straddles the Mexican states of Colima and Jalisco. It is located in the transition between the Nearctic and Neotropical realms and encompasses parts of the Sierra Madre del Sur, with a wide range of altitudes, climates and soils. The effects of tectonic and volcanic activities and erosion are notable within the reserve. Ecological characteristics Forest types in the reserve including mesophytic, cloud, dry deciduous and semi-deciduous tropical forests. Anthropologists know the region as Zona de Occidente, an area notably different to the rest of Mesoamerica. Some ceramic remnants, figurines and graves have been found, but there is little other material evidence of ancient human settlement. As of 1995 almost 8,000 people lived in the Sierra de Manantl√°n Reserve, engaged mainly in agriculture (corn, beans, tomatoes, sugar cane, watermelon, mangoes), livestock grazing, timber production, and extraction of wood for fuel and mining of coal or minerals. Another 30,000 lived in the surrounding communities and almost 700,000 in the surrounding region.http://www.unesco.org/new/en/natural-sciences/environment/ecological- sciences/biosphere-reserves/latin-america-and-the-caribbean/mexico/sierra-de- manantian/ The Sierra de Manantl√°n Biosphere Reserve is located to the extreme north of the inter-tropical zone. The climate in the region is influenced by its proximity to the coast, the effect of its landform (orographic shade) and the breadth of its altitudinal range. These characteristics explain the high biodiversity and the presence of numerous plant formations ranging from tropical forests to temperate-cold climates. The Sierra de Manantl√°n's varied and complex plant cover harbours a great wealth of flora. There are over 2900 species of vascular plants belonging to 981 genera. Wildlife is one of the important components of the high biodiversity in this reserve. Among the main values of the Sierra de Manantl√°n, in addition to its great wealth of species and its unique biogeographical characteristics, particular mention should be made of the presence of endangered or useful endemic species. So far 110 mammal species have been reported, including the Mexican vole subspecies Microtus mexicanus neveriae, the pocket gopher Cratogeomys gymnurus russelli, the oncilla, jaguarandi, ocelot, puma, bobcat, jaguar and four species of nectarivorous bats. There are 336 bird species which have been reported, among them are 36 which are endemic to Mexico, such as the charismatic species: crested guan (Penelope purpurascens), military macaw (Ara militaris), red- lored amazon (Amazona autumnalis) and the Mexican national symbol, the golden eagle. In terms of herpetofauna, 85 species have been recorded; of these 13 are endemic to the western and central region of Mexico: rattlesnake, black iguana, frog Shyrrhopus modestus, beaded lizard (Heloderma horridum) and the Autlan rattlesnake (Crotalus lannomi), an endemic species only reported for the area of Puerto de Los Mazos. Of the 16 species of fish identified, 13 are native and four are endemic to the region. Most plants in the list below can be found in Flora de Manantl√°n, and that should be assumed as a reference when no other is indicated. References to other sources are included where found. The herbarium web pages at the National Autonomous University of Mexicohttp://unibio.unam.mx/ and at the Missouri Botanical Gardenhttp://www.tropicos.org/ are used as authorities for names with adjustments for the system in use by Wikipedia.

His family moved to Colorado when he was six years old. He graduated from Heritage High School and the University of Colorado Boulder. While in college, he drew a comic strip called B Street. After college, Caldara worked as a roadie setting up stage equipment for rock bands. He later started a stage lighting business. Public policy career Caldara was elected to the board of directors for the Regional Transportation District, eventually becoming chairman. He replaced Tom Tancredo as president of the Independence Institute, a Colorado think tank, in 1998. =Voter registration protest= When the Colorado legislature relaxed voter registration requirements to allowed people to register in a jurisdiction if they declared their intent to move there, Caldara objected. He decided to test the law by declaring his intent to move to Colorado Springs (Caldara is a long-time resident of Boulder, Colorado) in order to vote in a recall election there. In September 2013, Caldara cast a blank ballot, but never moved to Colorado Springs, although he sublet a room there for a brief time.Lynn Bartels, ‚ÄúNew El Paso County resident Jon Caldara turns in blank recall ballot,‚Äù Denver Post, 24 April 2016.

However, Suthers noted \\"arguable ambiguity‚Äù in the same-day voter law, and took no action.

Sargent (1843-1896) was an American actor, magician, theatre manager and agent who promoted several female actors including Madame Modjeska, Hortense Rh√©a, Madame Janauschek and Adelaide Moore. He also promoted a series of exhibition bouts between boxers John L. Sullivan and Billy Madden. His final years were spent in England where he died in poverty. Early years His real name was Harry/Henry Sargent Jones and he was born in Machiasport, Maine, January 1, 1843, moving to Boston with his family whilst still a child. His mother was Sarah Ann Marston (c1805-1864) and father Thomas Jones (1794-1863). Jones took up amateur dramatics and became a utility man at the Boston Theatre during the season of 1858-59. In the 1860 Boston census his occupation was described as clerk. Civil War On April 18, 1861 at Brooklyn, Jones joined the 14th Regiment New York State Militia, Company F, as a private. The regiment, known as the Red Legged Devils, saw action in some of the major engagements of the Civil War including Bull Run and Gettysburg. Regimental losses during the war amounted to 721 men, including killed, wounded and missing. Jones was promoted to sergeant and later to sergeant major, leaving the army on June 6, 1864. In later life, when he performed as an illusionist, he elevated his rank and called himself \\"Colonel H.J. Sargent, the Wizard of the South\\".National Archives and Records Administration. U.S., Civil War Pension Index: General Index to Pension Files, 1861-1934 [database on-line]. Provo, UT, USA: Ancestry.com Operations Inc, 2000. Post war An entry in the Washington Evening Star dated September 29, 1864 reported that \\"H. Sargent Jones, of New York, has been appointed to a first class clerkship in the General Post Office Department, at a salary of $1200 per annum\\". On October 18, 1864, Jones married Ellen (Nellie) Amanda Hovey (1844-1889) in Lexington, Massachusetts. During this period and over the next few years he performed as a magician and in 1869, became a lessee and manager of the Lyceum Theatre, Boston. In 1870, now known as Harry Sargent, he was involved with the management of theatrical productions in Indianapolis. From there he moved to the National Theatre in Cincinnati, Ohio and after this managed the Athenaeum in Columbus, Ohio, for three seasons. In August, 1873, Harry and Ellen's five- year-old daughter, Alice Bell, died. In October of the same year Harry Sargent remarried to actress Hannah E. Bailey (1847-1900)Hannah Bailey's sister was fellow actress Josephine Bailey (1855-1939) who was married to actor Walter Eytinge (1854-1893). Madame Modjeska Poster for a Harry J. Sargent production of Boucicault's farce Contempt of Court, c. 1879. From the Library of Congress In 1875 Sargent was manager for the actor and playwright Dion Boucicault, who had recently returned to America from Europe. During a break Sargent went to California to arrange a tour for the magician Robert Heller. After the completion of this he remained on the west coast managing a minstrel show and in 1877 attended the California Theatre (San Francisco) to see a performance by Helena Modjeska, playing Adrienne Lecouvreur . She was a Polish actress, born 1840 in Krak√≥w, who moved to America with her husband in 1876 to start a new life farming. They failed to make a go of this, and Modjeska, who had a limited knowledge of the English language, secured an acting role on the stage of the California Theatre. After seeing her performance, Sargent signed her for a successful tour on the east coast. However, by November 1880 Sargent was in dispute with her, seeking a legal restraint to prevent her acting on the London stage without his sanction. Not long after this she was with another manager, John Stetson. She became a critically acclaimed and successful actress of the period. Other signings Sargent was the agent at some period for several other actors including Rhea, Janisch, Madame Janauschek, Alma Stuart Stanley, Adelaide Moore and Mrs Scott Siddon. He also promoted many stage productions in America and Britain. In 1882 Sargent signed a contract with boxer John L. Sullivan to give sparring exhibitions with Billy Maddon during the autumn and winter of that year. Sullivan was said to have been promised $500 per week, but by October disputes arose between the boxers and Sargent and later Maddon walked out on Sullivan. In about 1887 Sargent, who was running a theatrical agency in London, signed an English amateur actress called, Emily Jane Vertue Churchill-Jodrell (1850-1895). She had family connections to the aristocracy, her grandfather being Sir Richard Paul Jodrell, 2nd Baronet Lombe, of Great Melton, co. Norfolk. A tour was planned for her in England starting in Liverpool with her own company, managed by Sargent and Sidney Herberte-Basing. Her publicity claimed that she would be taking part in a world tour that included America and Australia. She and Sargent arrived in America in 1888 but success eluded them. They returned to England where Churchill-Jordell took a lease on the Novelty Theatre, Great Queen Street in London, with Sargent as her manager. It was renamed the Jodrell Theatre and opened on October 22, 1888, but in February 1889 had closed with financial losses. Their next venture together was a form of variety theatre called Cagliostromantheon in Waterloo House, Pall, Mall, London. Sargent was the proprietor on this occasion, with Churchill-Jodrell appearing on the bill with a monologue written for her by Sargent and others. Within a few months the undertaking had failed, and bankruptcy proceedings were brought against him in August 1891. One of the actors who had not been paid, Arthur Playfair, tried to sue Churchill-Jodrell for his loss, claiming that she was Sargent's business partner and, therefore, liable. She told the court that she had lent Sargent the money (¬£1300), but later paid him an addition ¬£500 to be released from any partnership agreement. At the later bankruptcy hearing it transpired that Sargent and Churchill-Jodrell lived at the same address in London, she had paid for a recent vacation they took together in Monte Carlo and had lent him the diamond rings that he wore. Final years In 1890 it was reported in American newspapers that Sargent had deserted his wife and their two children, leaving them destitute in Europe. A passport application made by Hannah E. Sargent in Berlin, Germany, dated March 1889, for herself and her two children, confirms that she was no longer able to travel on her husband's passport. Her reason for applying for the passport was given as ‚Äúlegitimation‚Äù. She returned to America in 1890 with her children and was offered acting work in the theatre by Madame Modjeska. Churchill-Jodrell died in London on July 24, 1895 and Sargent died in Leeds, Yorkshire, February 3, 1896. One report in 1894 said that he had been seen in London living as a tramp in rags, sauntering aimless and dejectedly about town, at night sleeping in a Salvation Army hostel. Reports in the newspapers after his death said that his last two to three year were spent in Leeds where he had sunk into extreme poverty. He eventually sought help from the Actors‚Äô Benevolent Fund, but it was too late; they took him to the infirmary but he could not be saved. He had been sharing lodgings with an acquaintance called Swainson who had little enough for himself, but shared what he had. In gratitude Sargent left him his belongings that included his war medals.

Sunbeam Commercial Vehicles was a commercial vehicle manufacturing offshoot of the Wolverhampton based Sunbeam Motor Car Company when it was a subsidiary of S T D Motors Limited. Sunbeam had always made ambulances on modified Sunbeam car chassis. S T D Motors chose to enter the large commercial vehicle market in the late 1920s, and once established they made petrol and diesel buses and electrically powered trolleybuses and milk floats. Commercial Vehicles became a separate department of Sunbeam in 1931. Ownership switched from S T D Motors to Rootes Securities in mid-1935, and later that year their Karrier trolleybus designs were added to Sunbeam production lines. In 1946 J. Brockhouse and Co of West Bromwich bought Sunbeam but in September 1948 sold the trolleybus part of the business to Guy Motors. In the early 1950s the amalgamated Sunbeam, Karrier and Guy trolleybus operation was the largest in Britain and possibly the world. In 1954 Sunbeam Commercial Vehicles moved within Wolverhampton from the Moorfield Works in Blakenhall to new extensions at Guy Motors Fallings Park. Guy Motors was bought by Jaguar Cars in 1961 and was closed by Jaguar's parent company, British Leyland, in 1982. Owners =Sunbeam Motor Car Company= The Sunbeam Cycles brand appeared in 1887 when John Marston made his first high quality bicycles and branded them Sunbeam. He added high-quality cars to his products and in 1905 formed the Sunbeam Motor Car Company after building, a mile or so south of his cycle works, his new Moorfield Works for his car workshops in Upper Villiers Street, Blakenhall, Wolverhampton. He had established Villiers Engineering there some years earlier. At its height in the 1920s, Sunbeam Motor Car Company's Moorfield works employed 3,500 staff on their 50-acre site. The buildings covered a full 15 acres. Sunbeam made a 3-axle bus chassis in December 1928 in an attempt to diversify. Known as the Sunbeam Sikh it had a Sunbeam 6-cylinder 7.98-litre engine developing 142 brake horse power in a chassis designed for a double-deck body carrying 60 to 70 passengers. A smaller 2-axle model Pathan appeared in August 1929 fitted with a 6.6-litre engine developing 110 bhp capable of carrying a 26-seater single deck or luxury coach body. Sales were disappointing despite Sunbeam's good build quality. Sydney S Guy had been Sunbeam Works Manager until May 1914 when he left to start his own business. His Guy Motors had produced the world's first 3-axle trolleybuses in 1926, and Wolverhampton Corporation had bought a number of them. In 1931 Sunbeam decided to follow suit and split off a commercial vehicles division. They took their 3-axle motor bus chassis and modified it to carry the electric motors and control gear of a trolleybus. The design was a success, and large numbers were sold. By the summer of 1933 Sunbeam trolleybuses were running on the Wolverhampton, Walsall and other British networks. =Rootes= In mid 1934 near the height of the Great Depression it became known that the Sunbeam Motor Car Company was unable to repay large sums borrowed for Sunbeam by parent company S T D Motors ten years earlier. In October 1934 a committee of the unhappy lenders asked the court to appoint a Receiver and Manager and though it was briefly avoided and a new company named Sunbeam Commercial Vehicles was hastily incorporated on 17 November 1934 it proved impossible to avoid the receivership.Companies House extract company no 294186 Pressed Steel Fisher Limited formerly Sunbeam Trolley Bus Company Limited The receivership held up the sale of the business. Rootes Securities Limited announced in early July 1935 that sanctioned by an Order of the Court a subsidiary, Motor Industries, had entered into possession of the share capital of Sunbeam Commercial Vehicles Limited along with the other undertaking, assets and goodwill of Sunbeam Motor Car Company. Motor Industries would change its name to include Sunbeam and would continue the manufacture of Sunbeam's cars and trolley buses. Rootes soon transferred manufacture of their recently acquired Karrier trolleybuses to Moorfield. AEC tried a joint venture with Sunbeam in 1935 and made a bus built on an AEC chassis with a Gardner engine and Sunbeam bodywork. It was not successful and sales were poor. Sunbeam also produced milk floats and other battery electric road vehicles in the late 1930s. AEC withdrew from the venture in 1944 and was bought by Leyland Motors in 1946. =Guy Motors= alt=1955 Willowbrook -bodied Sunbeam F4A trolleybus at Black Country Museum front nearside running up incline. Sunbeam Commercial Vehicles was sold to the Brockhouse Group in August 1946. In September 1948 the Sunbeam Trolley Bus Company was sold on to Guy Motors but Brockhouse kept Sunbeam's machine-tool section. Guy adopted the Sunbeam marque for most of their subsequent trolleybus sales. The bringing together of Sunbeam Karrier and Guy trolleybus factories created Britain's largest trolleybus manufacturer. At the beginning of 1949 contracts were in hand to provide trolleybuses for the systems at Newcastle, Teesside, Wolverhampton, Maidstone, South Shields, Glasgow, Reading, and Ipswich in Britain, Durban, Johannesburg, and Pretoria in South Africa, Coimbra in Portugal, and Adelaide, Brisbane and Perth in Australia. Production moved from Moorfield to new-built extensions at the Guy works during 1954. The first Sunbeam trolleybuses to be built at Guy's Fallings Park site were a batch for Penang, followed by a batch for Hull but by the end of 1956 it was clear that local and international demand for trolleybuses was declining. Guy Motors faced severe difficulties in the late 1950s exacerbated by an ill-advised decision to manage South African retail sales in-house and the failure of the Wulfrunian. The Wulfrunian, i.e. a resident of Wolverhampton, was a front- entrance, front-engined motor bus developed for the West Riding Automobile Company. Guy Motors last ordinary dividend had been paid in 1957. =Jaguar= Lloyds Bank appointed a receiver in September 1961. The next month Jaguar Cars bought Guy Motors from the receiver hoping it might be feasible to coordinate and rationalise output with their recently acquired Daimler Company's buses. Jaguar bought only the assets and business of Guy Motors Limited and Guy Motors Limited was wound up. London's trolleybuses were phased out in 1962 after a reign of 30 years. At the end of the 1930s they had run 1,700 trolleybuses over about one-fifth of their total bus routes. The same year saw the last deliveries in the United Kingdom, to Bournemouth. Further takeovers followed. In September 1966, Jaguar was bought by the British Motor Corporation (BMC), which became British Motor Holdings (BMH) in December 1966. By 1967 BMH Jaguar's Sunbeam, Britain's only manufacturer of trolleybuses, offered three models: a 2-axle design for single deck vehicles, another for double-deck vehicles and a 3-axle double-deck chassis. Each chassis was available with a number of different wheelbases to enable vehicles of different lengths to be built: the single deck vehicles with four variants, the 2-axle double-deck chassis with three, and the 3-axle chassis with two but there were no further sales. The last delivery was to Portugal in 1966. A trolleybus in Bradford in 1970.

The next year thirty-one nations adopted \\"plans to save Europe's Heritage by removing overhead trolleybus cables, electricity and telephone wires and big unsympathetic shop windows.\\" The dormant Sunbeam Trolleybus Company legal entity was renamed Pressed Steel Fisher in 1978 and given by Michael Edwardes British Leyland's freshly separated car body business. British Leyland's truck division closed in 1982. Products =Trolleybuses= Bradford Sunbeam F4 Cape Town Tramways Sunbeam Perth Sunbeam F4 The first trolleybus built by Sunbeam entered service on the Wolverhampton system in 1931. It was a model MS2 with bodywork by Weymann, and carried the fleet number 95. It had three axles and could carry 61 passengers. The 1930s saw a fairly rapid expansion in the number of trolleybuses which were operating in Britain. There were 400 such vehicles on the roads in early 1931, but the following years saw many tramway systems replaced by trolleybuses. Bournemouth Corporation Tramways began that process in 1933, when they placed an order for 103 double-deck vehicles with Sunbeam, which were fitted with electrical equipment manufactured by British Thompson Houston (BTH) of Rugby. Sunbeam exported their trolleybuses to a number of countries. In South Africa, Cape Town Tramways operated a fleet, where all of the 3-axle buses were bought from Sunbeam. An initial order for 60 was placed in November 1937, and the vehicles were fitted with BTH electrical equipment while the regenerative rheostatic braking system was produced by Ransomes. Bodywork was of all metal construction, and was made by Metro Cammell Weymann. 11 more vehicles were ordered in 1939. The Cape Town network ran into the foothills of Table Mountain, requiring them to negotiate long gradients, but they performed well. One of the worst routes in this respect rose in , with a maximum gradient of 1 in 8 (12.5 per cent). Following trials with two Swiss-built trolleybuses, Coimbra in Portugal ordered six Sunbeams in 1950, with a view to replacing the tram system if they proved successful. The vehicles supplied were based on Sunbeam's MF2B model, with two axles and a wheelbase of . They were fitted with single deck bodywork by Park Royal Vehicles, with 40 seats and room for 35 standing passengers. In order to enable them to be operated by just the driver, they included an overhang of beyond the front axle, allowing the entrance door to be mounted just behind the windscreen, so that payment could be made to the driver when entering the vehicle. To cope with the steep gradients of the Coimbra system, they were fitted with 600-volt motors, and each trolleybus carried two compressors, normally designed to work together, but each capable of maintaining the air supply for braking and door operation if one should fail. The expanding trolleybus network in Perth, Western Australia, placed an order for 50 F4 vehicles in 1950/51. These were shipped to Australia as chassis, with bodywork provided on arrival. Ten of the trolleybuses carried bodies by Commonwealth Engineering of Sydney, while the remaining 40 were bodied more locally, by the bus manufacturer Boltons of West Perth. Boltons and Commonwealth Engineering formed a close working relationship during this period, with Boltons effectively working as a sub- contractor. All of the vehicles had 2-axles, with an entrance in the centre of the vehicle. A variety of configurations was available and Hull Corporation trialled a Roe bodied Sunbeam in February 1953, which had a separate entrance and exit, and twin staircases. This reduced the seating capacity to 54, but the design, which was specified by the Transport Manager Mr G H Pulfrey, was well-received, and an order for a further 15 such vehicles was placed in April 1953. Electrical equipment was by Metropolitan-Vickers. Many early British trolleybuses were of 3-axle design, partly because of legislation which restricted the length of 2-axle designs and partly because of the difficulty of designing a back axle which could cope with the torque supplied by an electric motor. It took until 1954 for official attitudes to change, when Walsall gained permission to run long 2-axle trolleybuses, and it was the Sunbeam Trolleybus Company, by then owned by Guy, which built them. They were officially model F4A, and 15 of them were ordered. Bodywork was built by Willowbrook, later acquired by Duple Coachbuilders, and the vehicles could seat 70 passengers. They were of a lightweight design, weighing just 7.25 tons, and No. 851, the first to enter service, did so before the legislation had been changed to allow a bus of this length with only two axles. It therefore required special dispensation from the Ministry of Transport. Sunbeam manufactured a total of 1,152 trolleybusses for the United Kingdom market, with the last delivered in 1962 to Bournemouth. The last Sunbeam trolleybuses were built for use in Portugal in 1966. =Milk floats= Sunbeam Commercial Vehicles showcased two battery electric road vehicles at the Commercial Vehicle Show in November 1937. They were both 12‚Äì15 cwt models, with a British Thompson-Houston (BTH) motor, which was controlled by magnetic contactors, similar to those used on Sunbeam-BTH trolleybuses. One was fitted with an open deck milk float body, suitable for dairy work, while the other had a van body, manufactured by Glover, Webb & Liversidge, and was one of a batch of vehicles supplied to Selfridges, the London department store. The motor was mounted in the middle of the vehicle, and drove the rear axle through a Hardy-Spicer propellor shaft and double reduction gearing. The chassis carried three batteries, one on either side between the wheels, and one at the rear. When the vehicle was tested by Commercial Motor in 1940, it was available with five sizes of battery, rated at 128, 160, 192, 224 or 240 amp-hours, the larger sizes giving a longer range between charges. Control of the 12‚Äì15 cwt model was by a bar-type accelerator pedal, which controlled the operation of several electro-magnetic contactors. Series resistances were used to limit the current on the first two stages of the controller. The front hubs were mounted on taper roller bearings, while the back axle included double- reduction gearing and a removable differential, to assist maintenance. The transmission between the motor and the rear axle was by a shaft fitted with two Hardy Spicer universal joints. The brakes were manufactured by the Bendix Corporation, and both the foot and hand brakes operated on all four wheels. Although all models seemed to be classified as 12‚Äì15 cwt, the standard design had a load platform which was long, while short chassis and long chassis variants were also produced, with platforms of and . Manufacture of battery- electric road vehicles seems to have ceased at around the time that the Sunbeam Trolleybus Company was sold to Guy Motors, for the goodwill of the Sunbeam battery-electric operation was bought by Hindle Smart of Manchester, makers of Helecs milk floats, in early 1949. An advert in Commercial Motor magazine from 1 July 1949 mentions that there was a Jen-Helecs drivers club, for drivers of Jen-Helecs, Sunbeam and Wilson Electric vehicles.

Bred and owned by Maktoum Al Maktoum he was trained in England by Barry Hills. He showed his best form as a two-year-old in 1996 when he was placed in the Acomb Stakes, Champagne Stakes and Middle Park Stakes before recording his biggest success in the Dewhurst Stakes. He failed to win in four subsequent races and was retired from racing in 1998. He had no success as a breeding stallion. Background In Command was a bay horse bred in Ireland by his owner Maktoum Al Maktoum's Gainsborough Stud. The colt was sent into training in England with Barry Hills at Lambourn in Berkshire and was ridden in all of his races by Hills' son Michael. In Command was from the ninth crop of foals sired by Sadler's Wells, who won the Irish 2000 Guineas, Eclipse Stakes and Irish Champion Stakes in 1984 went on to be the Champion sire on fourteen occasions. In Command's dam Flying Melody was a successful racehorse who became an outstanding broodmare, producing Royal Applause and Lyric Fantasy. As a descendant of the broodmare Oola Hills, Flying Melody was related to many notable Thoroughbreds including Park Top and Pappa Fourway. Racing career =1996: two-year-old season= In Command began his racing career in a maiden race over six furlongs at Goodwood Racecourse on 31 July in which he started the 6/5 favourite in an eight-runner field. He took the lead a furlong out and won by half a length from the Mick Channon-trained Mile High. He was then moved up in class and distance for the Acomb Stakes over seven furlongs at York Racecourse on 20 August in which he started odds-on favourite but finished third behind Revoque and Symonds Inn. Despite his defeat In Command was stepped up again in class for the Group Two Champagne Stakes at Doncaster Racecourse on 13 September. Starting the 9/1 outsider of the four runners he took the lead a quarter of a mile from the finish but was overtaken and beaten three and a half lengths into second by the John Dunlop-trained Bahhare. On 3 October the colt was moved up to Group One class for the Group One Middle Park Stakes over six furlongs on good-to- firm ground at Newmarket Racecourse and started the 8/1 fifth choice in the betting behind Bahamian Bounty, Indian Rocket (Mill Reef Stakes), Hurricane State and Easycall (Richmond Stakes, Flying Childers Stakes). In Command was among the leaders from the start and stayed on well in the closing stages to finish third behind Bahamian Bounty and Muchea. Fifteen days after his run in the Middle Park Stakes, In Command returned to Newmarket to contest Britain's most prestigious race for two-year-olds, the Dewhurst Stakes on rain-softened ground. Bahamian Bounty started 7/2 joint favourite alongside the Ed Dunlop- trained Kahal with In Command starting at odds of 10/1. The other five runners were Desert King, The West (runner-up in the Prix de la Salamandre), Musical Pursuit and Air Express. After tracking the leaders In Command took the lead approaching the final furlong and held off the challenges of the outsiders Musical Pursuit and Air Express to win by a head and a neck. After the race Barry Hills said \\"he horse was helped by the rain which has made a difference between winning and losing. He has done well since the Middle Park and I was very reassured to see the rain.\\" Michael Hills commented \\"The extra furlong and the cut in the ground have made all the difference. He was getting a little tired close home and losing it a bit, but he will be much stronger next season. Very few of Sadler's Wells' offspring win Group One two-year- old races so he must be a bit special\\". =1997: three-year-old season= In Command began his second season in the Greenham Stakes (a major trial race for the 2000 Guineas) over seven furlongs at Newbury Racecourse on 19 April. After leading in the early stages he was overtaken in the last quarter mile and finished fourth behind Yalaietanee, Revoque and Muchea. In Command was off the racecourse for almost two months before he returned in the St James's Palace Stakes at Royal Ascot in which he started a 25/1 outsider and finished sixth behind Starborough. After another lengthy absence he contested the Park Stakes at Doncaster in September and finished seventh of the eight runners behind the four-year-old Almushtarak. =1998: four-year-old season= In Command remained in training as a four-year-old but made only one appearance. In the Doncaster Mile Stakes on 26 March he started the 9/4 favourite but finished last of the eight runners behind Hornbeam. Assessment In the 1997 International Classification of European two-year-olds In Command was given a rating of 117 making him the lowest-rated Dewhurst Stakes since Dr Devious in 1991. Stud record At the end of his racing career In Command was retired to become a breeding stallion. He had very little success as a sire of winners and by 2005 was standing at a fee of ¬£1,500 at the Bracklynn Stud in Ireland.

Distribution This spider wasp is found in Southern Africa, recorded from South Africa and Zimbabwe. Description These wasps are about 45 mm in length. They are largely black with orange antennae, orange dital parts of the legs, and largely orange wings, which are dark at the base and tip. Biology Females of T. ignites largely specialise in hunting and capturing rain spiders Palystes spp., which are stung by the wasp; the sting paralyses the spider which is dragged to the wasp's nest. In the nest, the wasp lays an egg on the spider and then seals the nest. When the larva hatches, it consumes the spider, starting with the less vital parts to keep the spider alive for as long as possible, eating the vital organs last. Once finished consuming the prey, the larva pupates, and males usually emerge before females and patrol nest sites looking for newly emerged females with which to mate. Baboon spiders have also been recorded as prey for this wasp. Adults feed on nectar from flowers.
