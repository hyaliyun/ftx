Their music often invoked religious imagery dealing with conflict, redemption, punishment, and guilt through David Eugene Edwards's lyrics and the heavy use of traditional bluegrass, gospel, and Appalachian instrumentation cross-bred with rock. For the bulk of its career, the band consisted of Edwards, Jean-Yves Tola, and Pascal Humbert, the latter two formerly of the French band Passion Fodder. After releasing four studio albums and touring extensively, the group broke up in 2005, citing \\"mostly political and spiritual\\" differences. The members remain active in the groups Woven Hand and Lilium. Band history David Eugene Edwards live in 2004. David Eugene Edwards and Pascal Humbert formed 16 Horsepower in 1992 in Los Angeles, California, where they had met building movie sets for Roger Corman's Hollywood Studios. Friend, co-worker and trained jazz drummer Jean-Yves Tola joined shortly after. The trio performed once as Horsepower before they parted ways with Humbert as Edwards and Tola relocated to Denver, Colorado. In Edwards's hometown of Denver, the band once again became a trio with the addition of Keven Soll, a luthier and accomplished double bass player. Frustrated by misconceptions about the name Horsepower being related to heroin and inspired by a traditional American folk song about sixteen horses pulling the coffin of a beloved to the graveyard, the name was changed to 16 Horsepower. The band spent the following years rehearsing and gaining a reputation for their intense live performances while touring extensively across North America and eventually they released a seven-inch single, \\"Shametown\\", in 1994 on Ricochet Records. By this time they had gained the attention of A&M; Records, and recording of Sackcloth 'n' Ashes began in 1995. For various reasons A&M; decided to postpone the release of the album, and so the band returned to the studio and recorded their eponymous debut EP which was released the same year. The debut full-length studio album Sackcloth 'n' Ashes was eventually released in 1996, garnering praise from the international music press. Pascal Humbert had relocated to Denver and joined the band as a second guitarist, although his primary instrument is the bass. Following differences about the musical direction, Soll was asked to leave and was replaced by Rob Redick, later known as the bassist for Candlebox. Redick did not last long because of what the band has referred to as \\"kind of a mutual unhappiness\\", and Humbert took over the bass duties. Jeffrey-Paul Norlander joined on second guitar shortly before recording began on the second album, Low Estate, with John Parish as producer. Edwards and Norlander had previously been in several bands together, most notably The Denver Gentlemen. Norlander departed in 1998 and was replaced by Steve Taylor, the band's guitar technician, who had already been performing on a handful of songs on the bands European tour in 1996. Spending two years touring and writing new material, 16 Horsepower's third full-length album Secret South was not recorded and released until 2000. The album marked a distinct change in sound and tone from earlier releases as the up-tempo rock influences had all but vanished completely and left room for a more melodic folk-inspired sound. The band toured in Europe in 2000 with the new album, and rumours of a break-up began to circulate shortly after. This rumour was further fueled by the fact that the band members had begun to focus on solo and side-projects. Humbert had released his solo-debut with his project Lilium the previous year and Edwards had begun recording and performing live with his new project Woven Hand. 16 Horsepower, short of Steve Taylor, returned in 2002 with Folklore. As hinted by the title, this fourth studio album took the band further into traditional folk territory and featured only four original 16 Horsepower compositions. While the band went on several tours in support of the album, their creative output was focused on Woven Hand and Lilium, Tola having also joined the latter. Olden, a compilation of previously unreleased versions of early material was released in 2003. This release was supported by a tour in early 2004, including their first US dates in three years, featuring a set split between early material and Folklore-era songs. In April 2005 the band announced their official break-up, as a result of personal, political and spiritual differences as well as finding the constant touring incompatible with their daily lives. Alternative Tentacles, a San Francisco-based record label run by former Dead Kennedys frontman Jello Biafra absorbed American distribution of the band's latter records shortly before their breakup. Since the band's demise, the label has released two DVD-format retrospectives, and in 2008 released a two-CD set Live March 2001. Humbert joined Woven Hand in 2007. Styles and themes It has always been difficult to describe the band's music in simple terms as it borrowed just as heavily from folk music, country, bluegrass, and traditional as it did from rock music. 16 Horsepower and Edwards' later project Woven Hand were described by one critic as \\"incendiary gospel, hallowed folk and mordant tones infused with a high, dark theatricality worthy of Nick Cave.\\" Edwards' grandfather was a Nazarene preacher and young Edwards often went along as his elder preached the gospel to various peoples. This experience colored his approach to songwriting as well as the instrumentation employed to develop the band's unique sound. On several tracks over the course of the band's career, Edwards evoked decisive Christian imagery, particularly that of the redemptive capacity of Jesus Christ. 16 Horsepower, especially in their early days, saw themselves first and foremost as a rock band. David Eugene Edwards, however, had an interest in all things from past times, including musical instruments. One instrument that was paramount during the nascent days of 16 Horsepower was the Chemnitzer concertina. It was erroneously credited as a bandoneon (a closely related instrument) on Sackcloth 'n' Ashes. The antique instrument used on the early tours and recordings was falling apart and quite cumbersome to tour with; some time before the sessions for Low Estate, it was replaced with the more modern American-made Patek brand instrument. Influences Acknowledged influences on the band included Joy Division, the Gun Club, Nick Cave and the Birthday Party. 16 Horsepower would eventually share the same management as Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds and tour with them. They also collaborated with Bertrand Cantat from French band Noir D√©sir on a cover of The Gun Club's \\"Fire Spirit\\" for the 1998 EP The Partisan and on \\"The Partisan\\" itself. Legacy 16 Horsepower are among the Denver-based bands credited for laying the foundation for what today has become known as \\"Gothic Americana\\". American metal band DevilDriver paid homage to 16 Horsepower with a cover of \\"Black Soul Choir\\" on their 2011 release, Beast. A post-rock interpretation of \\"Black Soul Choir\\" sung by Brandy Bones became a live staple of Canadian band Big John Bates during their 2012 Battered Bones tour. Their 2000 cover of \\"Wayfaring Stranger\\" was featured at the end of Bart Layton's 2012 documentary The Imposter.

Dean Taylor, is a Canadian singer, most notable as a recording artist, songwriter, and record producer for Motown during the 1960s and 1970s. According to Jason Ankeny, Taylor \\"remains one of the most underrated acts ever to record under the Motown aegis.\\" As a singer, American audiences know Taylor best for his chart-topping 1970 hit \\"Indiana Wants Me\\",\\"Top 50 Canadian Chart\\". RPM Magazine, Canadian Content, ‚Äì Volume 13, No. 23 July 25, 1970 which hit No. 1 in Cash Box in the United States and was also No. 1 in Canada and No. 2 in the UK. It peaked at No. 5 on the Billboard Hot 100. The song was featured in the opening minutes of the 1980 American movie, The Ninth Configuration. He is well known in the United Kingdom for other hits, including \\"Gotta See Jane\\" and \\"There's a Ghost in My House\\". Biography Born in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, Taylor began his career in 1961, as a pianist and singer with several music bands in Toronto. He also made his first recordings in 1961, for the Audiomaster record label. The next year, Taylor's \\"At The High School Dance\\", a single for Amy-Mala Records, was a minor success. His next single, \\"I'll Remember\\", on the Barry label, was a No. 23 success for Toronto rock and roll radio station CHUM, and the singer decided to relocate to Detroit, Michigan, to further his career. In Detroit, Taylor was hired by Motown Records in 1964 as a songwriter and recording artist for the Motown subsidiary V.I.P. label. Taylor's scheduled first single (March 1964) for V.I.P. was the topical satire \\"My Ladybug (Stay Away From That Beatle)\\", but it was deemed too weak for release and was never issued. It was not until November 1965 that Taylor's debut V.I.P. single, \\"Let's Go Somewhere\\", was issued. It was written by Taylor in conjunction with Brian Holland, and produced by the team of Holland and Lamont Dozier, who had already produced five No. 1 scoring songs for The Supremes. However, the song was only a regional success in several U.S. cities and Toronto. Taylor's next single (1967's \\"There's A Ghost In My House\\") was written by the team of Holland‚ÄìDozier‚ÄìHolland along with Taylor, and again produced by Brian Holland and Lamont Dozier. It was also a commercial disappointment in the US ‚Äì but it was a No. 3 hit in the UK Singles Chart in 1974. Taylor was also beginning to become a songwriter for other acts, as \\"I'll Turn to Stone\\" by the Four Tops, and \\"All I Need\\" by The Temptations were both charting US singles in 1967, co-composed by him. In 1968, Taylor's self-produced single \\"Gotta See Jane\\", (co-written with Brian Holland), became a Top 20 hit in the UK. However, his real success came as a member of the Motown writing and production team known as \\"The Clan\\". This production group was briefly the prime creator of material for Diana Ross & the Supremes after the Holland / Dozier / Holland team left Motown. Among Taylor's successful co- compositions and co-productions during 1968 and 1969 as a member of The Clan were Diana Ross & the Supremes' No. 1 US hit \\"Love Child\\" and their Top 10 follow-up hit \\"I'm Livin' In Shame\\". Taylor resumed his recording career in 1970, becoming one of the first artists assigned to Motown's new subsidiary Rare Earth, which was dedicated to white artists. In that year his first Rare Earth single, \\"Indiana Wants Me\\", became a No. 1 hit in his native Canada and in Cash Box magazine in the US. It peaked at No. 5 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart, and at No. 2 in the UK. \\"Gotta See Jane\\" was also reissued in 1971, and became a Top 10 success in Canada. His 1972 single \\"Taos New Mexico\\" did not do well on the Canadian charts, reaching number 48. Taylor continued recording for Rare Earth, and working as a writer / producer for other artists until Rare Earth was ended in 1976. Though he never again scored the charts as he had done with \\"Indiana Wants Me\\", his releases did moderately well, especially in Canada. As a Canadian citizen, he could be played on CKLW and other Canadian radio stations and counted towards the stations' Canadian content quotas. Taylor attempted a comeback during the early 1980s, after which he had a hiatus from the music industry. He also established his own record company, Jane Records, in 1973.

The design was presented to the public by the European Commission on 12 December 1996. It consists of a stylized letter E (or epsilon), crossed by two lines instead of one. In English, the sign precedes the value (for instance, ‚Ç¨10); in most other European languages, the reverse is true (for instance, 10‚Ç¨). Design Official graphic construction of the euro logo The euro sign in a selection of fonts The euro sign; logotype and handwritten There were originally 32 proposed designs for a symbol for Europe's new common currency; the Commission short-listed these to ten candidates. These ten were put to a public survey. After the survey had narrowed the original ten proposals down to two, it was up to the Commission to choose the final design. The other designs that were considered are not available for the public to view, nor is any information regarding the designers available for public query. The Commission considers the process of designing to have been internal and keeps these records secret. The eventual winner was a design created by a team of four experts whose identities have not been revealed. It is assumed that the Belgian graphic designer Alain Billiet was the winner and thus the designer of the euro sign. The official story of the design history of the euro sign is disputed by Arthur Eisenmenger, a former chief graphic designer for the European Economic Community, who says he had the idea 25 years before the Commission's decision. The Commission specified a euro logo with exact proportions and colours (PMS Yellow foreground, PMS Reflex Blue background), for use in public-relations material related to the euro introduction. While the Commission intended the logo to be a prescribed glyph shape, type designers made it clear that they intended instead to adapt the design to be consistent with the typefaces to which it was to be added.Typographers discuss the euro, from December 1996. Use on computers and mobile phones Generating the euro sign using a computer depends on the operating system and national conventions. Initially, some mobile phone companies issued an interim software update for their special SMS character set, replacing the less- frequent Japanese yen sign with the euro sign. Subsequent mobile phones have both currency signs. The euro is represented in the Unicode character set with the character name EURO SIGN and the code position U+20AC (decimal 8364) as well as in updated versions of the traditional Latin character set encodings. In HTML, the entity can also be used. An implicit character encoding, along with the fact that the code position of the euro sign is different in historic encoding schemes (code pages), led to many initial problems displaying the euro sign consistently in computer applications, depending on access method. While displaying the euro sign was no problem as long as only one system was used (provided an up-to-date font with the proper glyph was available), mixed setups often produced errors. Initially, Apple, Microsoft and Unix systems each chose a different code point to represent a euro symbol: thus a user of one system might have seen a euro symbol whereas another would see a different symbol or nothing at all. Another was legacy software which could only handle older encodings such as ISO 8859-1 that contained no euro sign at all. In such situations, character set conversions had to be made, often introducing conversion errors such as a question mark (?) being displayed instead of a euro sign. Widespread adoption of Unicode and UTF-8 encoding means that these issues rarely arise in modern computing. =Entry methods= Depending on keyboard layout and the operating system, the symbol can be entered as: * (UK/IRL) * (US INTL/ESP/SWE) * (BEL/ESP/FRA/GER/ITA/GRE/POR/CZE/EST/LTU/SWE) * (HU/PL) * (UK/IRL) * (US INTL/ESP) * in Microsoft Word in United States and more layouts * + in Microsoft Windows (depends on system locale setting) * followed by in Chrome OS, and in other operating systems using IBus. * followed by in the Vim text editor On the macOS operating system, a variety of key combinations are used depending on the keyboard layout, for example: * in British layout * in United States layout * in Slovenian layout * in French layoutMac OS: How to type the Euro glyph, Apple Technical Report TA26547 (11 September 2003). * in German, Spanish and Italian layout * in Swedish layout The Compose key sequence for the euro sign is followed by . Typewriters Classical typewriters are still used in many parts of the world, often recycled from businesses that have adopted desktop computers. Typewriters lacking the euro sign can create it by typing a capital \\"C\\", backspacing, and overstriking it with the equal (\\"=\\") sign. Use ‚Ç¨50 banknote A euro light sculpture at the alt= Placement of the sign also varies. Countries have generally continued the style used for their former currencies. In those countries where previous convention was to place the currency sign before the figure, the euro sign is placed in the same position (e.g., ‚Ç¨3.50).Euro: valutateken voor of achter het bedrag?, Nederlandse Taalunie.

Early years Born in New York City on July 10, 1824 into a poor Irish family, King was indentured as an apprentice to a jeweler in Manhattan at the age of 9. In 1835, he ran away from his indenture, stowing away on a ship bound for Mobile, Alabama. Upon discovery, he was adopted into the crew and trained in navigation, becoming a steamboat pilot by the age of sixteen. While serving in the end of the Second Seminole War in 1842, he met Mifflin Kenedy, who would later become his partner. From 1842 to 1847, King would operate steamboats on the Apalachicola and Chattahoochee rivers, in Florida and Georgia. Riverboating During the Texas revolution, King's friend and subsequent ranching and steam boating partner, Mifflin Kenedy, enlisted as ship master. Having run men and supplies to the United States Army along the Rio Grande. Kenedy convinced King in 1846 to join the war effort along the Rio Grande, where King worked on the transport Colonel Cross, ferrying army supplies between Reynosa, Camargo, and Matamoros. In 1850, following the war, King, Kenedy and two other partners formed the M. Kenedy and Company steamboat firm, renamed in 1866 to King, Kenedy and Company when the two other partners were bought out. This firm achieved \\"nearly monopolistic\\" control on the Rio Grande for most of the years between 1850 and 1874, when the partnership was dissolved.  American Civil War In addition to selling cattle to the Confederacy for food, King was active in the Cotton Road trade route during the Civil War which sold Confederate cotton through Mexico. King profited from both cotton road caravans stopping in King Ranch for supplies, and from steamboats operating under Mexican registry transporting cotton to Mexico and returning to Texas with military supplies. When the Union army invaded Texas to stop the Cotton Road trade, King participated in shifting the Cotton Road to Laredo. After the Battle of Brownsville, King Ranch was attacked by Union troops Christmastime 1863 by 80 men led by Captain James Speed. King was warned and fled the ranch house, leaving his family under the care of ranch hand Francisco Alvarado. When troops fired on the house, Alvarado was killed attempting to warn the soldiers that there were women and children inside. The troops searched the property for King, vandalized the house and took the ranch hands as prisoners. King continued to work the cotton trade throughout the war, and stayed in Matamoros, Mexico waiting to see if his request for amnesty from the President was approved. He acquired letters of amnesty and returned to Texas July 14th, 1865. Founding the King Ranch As soon as King had arrived in Texas, he began speculating in land, beginning with lots in Brownsville, Texas and Cameron County, Texas, and continued investing the large profits from the riverboat firm. In 1852, King purchased a false title to the southern half of Padre Island. That same year, he traveled overland from Brownsville to Corpus Christi, and became fascinated with the grasslands along Santa Gertrudis Creek in the \\"Nueces Strip\\" (the land between the Nueces River and the Rio Grande). In 1853 and 1854 King began land acquisitions in the region of the creek, purchasing valid titles to two ranches of a combined , forming the nucleus of the King Ranch. He continued acquiring land until his death in 1885, when the ranch had .  Death  In 1885, in obvious poor health, King traveled to San Antonio to see his doctor. He died of stomach cancer on April 14, at the Menger Hotel. Legacy The King Ranch continues to be a dominant economic force in the region. The town of Kingsville, Texas is named for King.

Biography Booh-Booh was born in Manak, Cameroon. Working at the Ministry of External Relations, he was Head of the Department of African Affairs, Director for Asia and Africa, Deputy Permanent Representative to the United Nations, and Ambassador to Morocco, Greece and UNESCO. He was Cameroon's Ambassador to the Soviet Union from 1981 to 1983 and its Ambassador to France from 1983 until he was named Minister of External Relations on May 16, 1988. He also wrote a book, published in Paris in 1982, called The Decolonization of Namibia: a Usurped Mandate. =Rwandan genocide= Booh- Booh's role in Rwanda has been the subject of harsh criticism, primarily by Lieutenant-General Rom√©o Dallaire and his supporters, contending that he played an instrumental role in forestalling any UN military preventive action against the Rwandan genocide that appeared imminent in the country in mid-1994. For his part, in his 2005 book Le Patron de Dallaire Parle (Dallaire's Boss Speaks) Booh-Booh strongly criticized the account and actions of Dallaire, who was the commander of the UNAMIR forces on the ground in 1994. In 1993, Booh-Booh was head of mission of a small force of UNAMIR military personnel (approximately 2,548) that was dispatched by the United Nations to Rwanda, in an effort to aid in the implementation of the Arusha Accords and to keep the peace between Hutu and Tutsi ethnic groups. According to Dallaire's autobiography, Shake Hands With the Devil, Dallaire had been given warnings from a reliable government source of an impending extermination campaign by Hutu extremists against the country's Tutsi minority and moderate Hutus. He passed this information along to the UN's headquarters in New York and reported his intent to inspect alleged arms caches. He was ordered not to intervene, and his later requests to increase the UNAMIR force by 5,000 peace- keeping soldiers were also denied. Shortly before President Juv√©nal Habyarimana's assassination, Booh-Booh was also criticized for spending Easter weekend 1994 with Habyarimana, raising questions about the SRSG's impartiality. While Booh-Booh claimed this was purely for fact-finding purposes, the Rwandese Patriotic Front filed a formal complaint regarding Booh-Booh's neutrality. This further worsened the RPF's confidence in UNAMIR.Shake Hands With the Devil: The Failure of Humanity in Rwanda: , pg. 213 The United Nations, restrained by the political interests of the permanent members of the United Nations Security Council and reluctance of the international community, remained passive before and throughout the predicted genocide of some 800,000 (some sources estimate one million) people that took place from April to July 1994, finally ending around the time the predominantly Tutsi Rwandan Patriotic Front took the nation's capital, Kigali, on July 18, 1994. As the genocide was occurring, the UNAMIR peace-keeping force was reduced from over 2,500 to a mere 270 soldiers. Booh-Booh was replaced as Special Representative on 1 July 1994 by Shahryar Khan of Pakistan.  See also  * ICTR Newsletter (Nov. 2005). 2005.

Biography He was born in Atlanta, Georgia on January 7, 1873. He attended the University of Georgia, where he was a member of the Chi Phi Fraternity and the Phi Kappa Literary Society. In 1897, he married the daughter of Henry W. Grady, the Atlanta journalist and orator. They had a son, Eugene Robert Black II.Eugene \\"Gene\\" Robert Black, Sr., was the first in the family to use the \\"Sr.\\" designation; his son was known as Eugene Robert Black, Jr. or Eugene Robert Black III. Black practiced law for 28 years until he became president of the Atlanta Trust Company in 1921, and in 1928, he became Governor of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta. He succeeded the longtime governor, Max Wellborn, who was also his daughter's father-in-law. When the Wall Street Crash of 1929 happened, he and two cashiers rushed to Nashville, Tennessee to supply currency and credit to banks in the city and surrounding region. The situation worsened with other cities in the region experiencing bank runs. Black kept his district afloat by rushing large quantities of cash to banks that were experiencing runs and extending credit to any bank that could offer any asset of value. He kept this policy active through the Great Depression into 1933. He, along with George L. Harrison, the Governor of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, recommended open market purchases to increase reserves. His insistence on expansionist policies led to the President appointing Black as chairman of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors in 1933. He died of a heart attack on December 19, 1934 in Atlanta, Georgia. References Further reading * External links * Statements and Speeches of Eugene R.

He succeeded to the title 14 October 1617 on the death in infancy of his elder brother Henry Willoughby, 4th Lord Willoughby of Parham. Francis Willoughby was second son of William Willoughby, 3rd Lord Willoughby of Parham The young and unexpected death of his elder brother Henry made Francis successor to the hereditary peerage and seat in the House of Lords, the upper house of Parliament. Francis Willoughby was an early supporter of the Parliamentarian cause during the English Civil War but later became a Royalist. He twice served as governor of English colonies in the Caribbean. Francis Willoughby died without male heirs of his body and the title passed to his younger brother William Willoughby, 6th Lord Willoughby of Parham, the third son of William Willoughby, 3rd Lord Willoughby of Parham. Background Francis Willoughby was born in perhaps late 1613 (since he was baptised in 1614) to William Willoughby, 3rd Baron Willoughby of Parham and Frances Manners, daughter of John Manners, 4th Earl of Rutland of Nottingham at Parham in Suffolk.Dictionary of National Biography: Willoughby, Francis, fifth Baron Willoughby of Parham (1613?-1666); Volume: Whichcord - Zuylestein (Vol 21); Ancestry.com. Dictionary of National Biography, Volumes 1-22 database on-line. Provo, UT, USA: Ancestry.com Operations, Inc., 2010. Original source: His father died in 1617, and the barony was held by his older brother Henry for one year until he too died barely five years old, at which point Francis inherited the seat in the House of Lords and with it the family title. As tensions between the king and Parliament grew in the 1630s, he found himself opposed to Charles I over the levying of ship money. His loyalty was further strained by the Bishops' Wars, in which he was reluctant to fight the Scots. Parliamentary Commander When the king in 1642 issued his Commission of Array to form a loyal army, Willoughby rejected his summons and instead took command of a horse regiment under the Parliamentary commander, the Earl of Essex. By January 1643 he was made commander-in-chief of Lincolnshire. On 16 July of the same year, he led his soldiers in a surprise attack on Gainsborough where he seized the town. Facing a counterattack, Willoughby's soldiers fought along with those under Oliver Cromwell to hold off an advancing Royalist force of superior strength. The main body of the Parliamentary army withdrew to Boston with only two dead. That September, Willoughby was a subordinate commander under the Earl of Manchester and Cromwell. He fought at the Battle of Winceby and accepted the surrender of Bolingbroke Castle in November. Willoughby's relations with the Parliamentarians began to fray in 1644. In March he joined with Sir John Meldrum in the assault on Newark, the failure of which has been partially attributed to Willoughby's supposed unwillingness to take orders from Meldrum. Willoughby quarrelled with Manchester and was forced to make an apology to the House of Lords as a result. Furthermore, Cromwell himself saw fit to complain about the conduct of Willoughby's soldiers. In the next few years, Willoughby became the leader of the Presbyterian force within Parliament, opposed the formation of the New Model Army and was elected as speaker of the House of Lords in July, 1647. However, when the Parliamentary army took London in September, Willoughby was imprisoned along with six other peers and held for four months at which point he was released without charge, fleeing to the Netherlands to join the Royalists. Royalist Supporter Now espousing the Royalist cause, Willoughby was promoted to Vice Admiral under the Duke of York, an appointment that may have been designed to engender sympathy among Scots and Presbyterians. He was also assigned a command in the 1648 invasion of England under the Prince of Wales. He later surrendered his naval command to Prince Rupert of the Rhine. When Parliament confiscated his estates, he travelled to the Caribbean. He was appointed Governor of Barbados by Charles II. He arrived at Barbados and took up the appointment in May 1650 and attempted to negotiate the strained politics of that island, which also experienced a division between Royalists and Parliamentarians. During this time he also sent a small colonizing party led by Major Anthony Rowse to Suriname, which established Willoughbyland in honor of the governor. The chief settlement was centred around Fort Willoughby (now Paramaribo). On 25 October 1651, a seven ship force under Commodore George Ayscue arrived off Barbados, demanding that the island submit \\"for the use of the Parliament of England\\". Willoughby's reply (tellingly addressed to \\"His Majesty's ship Rainbow\\") was unyielding, declaring that he knew \\"no supreme authority over Englishmen but the King\\". With some 400 horsemen and 6,000 militia, he was prepared to resist any attempt at coercion. Over the next month Barbados was blockaded. In early December, with the Royalist cause defeated in England, Ayscue began a series of raids against fortifications on the island and was reinforced by a group of thirteen ships bound for Virginia. On 17 December a force of more than 1,000 Barbadian militia was defeated by one of Ayscue's detachments. Governor Willoughby attempted to stem the spread of Parliamentary sympathies by hanging two of the returning militia soldiers and prohibiting the reading of documents from the blockading fleet. The Royalists held out for several more weeks until one of Willoughby's own commanders declared himself for Parliament. A battle was averted by a week of rain, after which Willoughby, perhaps having seen the hopelessness of his cause, sought negotiations. He was replaced as governor but Barbados and the Royalists there were not punished. Additionally, Willoughby's properties in England were restored. He returned to them in August 1652. Later years While he was twice imprisoned during The Protectorate for involvement in Royalist intrigues, Willoughby survived the Cromwell years and after the Restoration in 1660 he was again appointed to a governorship in the Caribbean, administering the colonies at Saint Kitts, Nevis, Montserrat, and Antigua. In June 1664 he organized an expedition from Barbados against the small French garrison at Saint Lucia, expelling it under the pretext that a half-Carib native had effectively \\"sold\\" it to England and establishing a short-lived English colony there. During the Second Anglo-Dutch War, Willoughby engaged in another expedition, sailing to the Dutch island of Tobago in July 1665. Finding a force under the English privateer Robert Searle already looting the settlement there, he put a stop to the destruction and installed a garrison of fifty men to maintain order. His last act on behalf of the English crown came in July 1666 when, having learned of the recent French seizure of Saint Kitts, he formed a relief force of two Royal Navy frigates, twelve other large vessels (including commandeered merchant ships), a fire ship, and a ketch, bearing over 1,000 men. He planned to proceed north to Nevis, Montserrat, and Antigua to gather further reinforcements before descending on the French. Leaving Barbados on 28 July, his force prowled off Martinique and then Guadeloupe, where he sent a frigate to assault the harbor and capture two merchant vessels on 4 August. This success could not be exploited however as that night most of his force was destroyed by a strong hurricane, including the flagship Hope, from which Willoughby did not emerge. Marriage and issue On 16 November 1628 Willoughby married Elizabeth Cecil (1606‚Äì1661), the daughter of the soldier Edward Cecil, 1st Viscount Wimbledon and Theodosia Noel. Francis Willoughby and Elizabeth Cecil had four children: #Diana, married 21 May 1673 Heneage Finch, 3rd Earl of Winchilsea #Frances Willoughby (1625 ‚Äì September 1680) married William Brereton, 3rd Baron Brereton #Elizabeth Willoughby (born about 1633 ‚Äì 1 August 1695) married 28 October 1662 Richard Jones, 1st Earl of Ranelagh #William Willoughby (born about 1635); died young and unmarried in his father's lifetime Legacy Willoughby died on 23 July 1666, at sea on board his ship Hope, in a hurricane off Guadeloupe. In his will, he left extensive holdings in Barbados, Antigua, and Suriname to his children and his nephew Henry Willoughby as well as smaller grants of currency or sugar to various associates and servants. He named his daughter Elizabeth as his executrix. Notes References * .

The entrance is usually protected by some means, such as a fixed wall on the outside, parallel to the door, which must be circumvented to enter and prevents direct enemy fire from a distance. It may include two sets of doors that can be barred independently to further delay enemy penetration. From around 1600 to 1900, a sally port was a sort of dock where boats picked up or dropped off ship crews from vessels anchored offshore. That meaning occasionally still occurs, especially in coastal Great Britain.  Etymology and historical usage  The Old West Sally Port at Edinburgh Castle in Scotland The word port is ultimately from Latin for door. Often the term postern is used synonymously. It can also mean a tunnel, or passage (i.e., a secret exit for those besieged). A sally, ultimately derived from Latin (to jump), or \\"salle\\" sortie, is a military maneuver, typically during a siege, made by a defending force to harass isolated or vulnerable attackers before retreating to their defenses. Sallies are a common way for besieged forces to reduce the strength and preparedness of a besieging army; a sally port is therefore essentially a door in a castle or city wall that allows troops to make sallies without compromising the defensive strength of fortifications. Targets for these raids included tools, which defenders could capture and use, and labor-intensive enemy works and equipment, such as trenches, mines, siege engines, and siege towers. Sometimes the defenders also attacked enemy laborers, and stole or destroyed the besiegers' food supplies. An extract from a 19th-century dictionary of military terms describes a sally port thus: > those underground passages, which lead from the inner to the outward works ; > such as from the higher flank to the lower, to the tenailles, or the > communication from the middle of the curtain to the ravelin. When they are > constructed for the passage of men only, they are made with steps at the > entrance, and outlet. They are about six feet wide, and feet high []. There > is also a gutter or shore made under the sally-ports that are in the middle > of the curtains, in order that the water which runs down the streets may > pass into the ditch ; but this can only be done when they are wet ditches. > When sally-ports serve to carry guns through them for the out-works, instead > of making them with steps, they must have a gradual slope, and be eight feet > wide.

He promoted the abolition of serfdom, with indemnification to territorial lords; subjection of the nobles to manorial imposts; and the establishment of a modern municipal system. Stein was from an old Franconian family. He was born on the family estate near Nassau, studied at G√∂ttingen, and entered the civil service. Prussian conservatism hampered him in his efforts to bring about changes. In 1807, he was removed from office by the King for refusing to accept the post of Minister of Foreign Affairs but was recalled after the Peace of Tilsit. After it became known that he had written a letter in which he criticised Napoleon, Stein was obliged to resign, which he did on 24 November 1808 and retired to the Austrian Empire, from which he was summoned to the Russian Empire by Tsar Alexander I in 1812. After the Battle of Leipzig in 1813, Stein became head of the council for the administration of the reconquered German countries. Early life Stein was the ninth child of Karl Philipp Freiherr vom Stein, and Henriette Karoline Langwerth von Simmern, the widow of von L√∂w. His father was a man of stern and irritable temperament, which his far more famous son inherited, with the addition of intellectual gifts, which the father entirely lacked. The family belonged to the order of imperial knights of the Holy Roman Empire, who occupied a middle position between sovereign princes and subjects of the empire. They owned their own domains and owed allegiance only to the emperor but had no votes for the Diet. The town of Nassau with the castle and family seat of the imperial knights of Stein (copper engraving by Matth√§us Merian 1655) In his old age, Stein would express his gratitude to his parents for the influence of their religious and truly German and knightly example. He added: > My view of the world and of human affairs I gathered as a boy and youth, in > the solitude of a country life, from ancient and modern history, and in > particular I was attracted by the incidents of the eventful history of > England. The influence of English ideas, so potent a factor in the lives of Voltaire, Rousseau, Talleyrand and many others in the 18th century, was therefore potently operative in the early career of Stein. He does not seem to have gone to any school except in 1773, when he went with a private tutor to the University of G√∂ttingen in Hanover. There, he studied jurisprudence and found time to pursue his studies in English history and politics. The latter, as he wrote, confirmed his predilection for that nation. Early career In 1777, he left G√∂ttingen and proceeded to Wetzlar, the legal centre of the Holy Roman Empire, to see the working of its institutions and thereby prepare himself for a career in law. Next, after a stay at each of the chief South German capitals, he settled at Regensburg to observe the methods of the Imperial Diet. In 1779 he went to Vienna. He proceeded to Berlin early in 1780. In Berlin, his admiration for Frederick the Great, together with his distaste for the pettiness of the legal procedure at Wetzlar, impelled him to take service under the Prussia monarch. He was fortunate in gaining an appointment in the department of mines and manufactures, as at the head of that office was an able and intelligent administrator, Friedrich Anton von Heynitz, who helped him to master the principles of economics and civil government. In June 1785, he was sent for a time as Prussian ambassador to the courts of Mainz, Zweibr√ºcken and Darmstadt, but he soon felt a distaste for diplomacy, and in 1786 and 1787, he was able to indulge his taste for travel by a tour in England, where he pursued his researches into commercial and mining affairs. In November 1787, he became Kammerdirektor (director of the board of war and domains) for the king's possessions west of the river Weser, and in 1796, he was appointed supreme president of all the Westphalian chambers dealing with the commerce and mines of those Prussian lands. One of the chief benefits he conferred on these districts was the canalization of the river Ruhr, which became an important outlet for the coal of that region. He also improved the navigation of the Weser and kept the main roads committed to his care well. War with France Stein's early training, together with the sternly practical bent of his own nature, made him completely impervious to the enthusiasm that the French Revolution had aroused in many minds in Germany. He disliked its methods as an interruption to the orderly development of peoples. Nevertheless, he carefully noted the new sources of national strength its reforms called forth in France. Meanwhile, Prussia, after being at war with France in 1792 to 1795, came to terms with it at Basel in April 1795 and remained at peace until 1806 though Austria and South Germany continued the struggle with France for most of that interval. Prussia, however, lost, rather than gained strength, for Frederick William III, who succeeded the weak and sensual Frederick William II in November 1797, was lacking in foresight, judgment and strength of character. He too often allowed public affairs to be warped by the advice of secret and irresponsible counsellors and persisted in the policy of subservience to France inaugurated by the Peace of Basle. It was under those untoward circumstances that Stein in 1804 took office at Berlin, as minister of state for trade (indirect imposts, taxes, manufactures, and commerce). He introduced useful reforms in his department, particularly by abolishing various restrictions on the internal trade of the nation, but he was hampered in his endeavors by the spirit of Prussian conservatism. He soon felt constrained to protest against the effects of the Francophile policy of the chief minister, Christian Graf von Haugwitz, and the evil influences that clogged the administration. Little, however, came of Stein's protests, but they were urged with his usual incisiveness and energy. Prussian policy continued to progress on the path that led to the disaster at Jena (14 October 1806). The Donnersches Palais (today Palais am Festungsgraben), Stein's residence as a Prussian Minister The king then offered Stein the portfolio for foreign affairs, which the minister declined to accept on the ground of his incompetence to manage that department unless there was a complete change in the system of government. The real motive for his refusal was that he desired to see Karl August von Hardenberg take that office and effect, with his own help, the necessary administrative changes. The king refused to accept Hardenberg and, greatly irritated by Stein's unusually outspoken letters, dismissed him altogether, adding that he was \\"a refractory, insolent, obstinate and disobedient official\\". Stein now spent in retirement the months in which Napoleon completed the ruin of Prussia. Stein got to see Hardenberg called to office in April 1807 and important reforms effected in the cabinet system. During the negotiations at Tilsit, Napoleon refused to act with Hardenberg, who thereupon retired. Strangely, Napoleon, who had as yet no idea of Stein's deep and earnest patriotism, suggested Stein as a possible successor. No other strong man was at hand who could save the ship of state, and on 8 October 1807, Frederick William, utterly depressed by the terrible terms of the Treaty of Tilsit, called Stein to office and entrusted him with very wide powers. Stein was now for a time virtually dictator of the reduced and nearly-bankrupt Prussian state. The circumstances of the time and his own convictions, gained from study and experience, led him to press on drastic reforms in a way that could not otherwise have been followed. First came the Edict of Emancipation, issued at Memel on 9 October 1807, which abolished the institution of serfdom throughout Prussia from 8 October 1810. All distinctions affecting the tenure of land (noble land, peasants' land etc.) were also swept away, and the principle of free trade in land was established forthwith. The same famous edict also abrogated all class distinctions respecting occupations and callings of any and every kind, thus striking another blow at the caste system that had been so rigorous in Prussia. Stein's next step was to strengthen the cabinet by wise changes. Stein issued a measure for municipal reform (19 November 1808), which granted local self- government on enlightened yet practical lines to all Prussian towns and even to all villages possessing more than 800 inhabitants. While Stein's efforts were directed more towards civil affairs, he also furthered the progress of the military reforms, which are connected more especially with the name of Gerhard Johann David von Scharnhorst. They refashioned the Prussian army on modern lines, with a reserve system. Military service was made obligatory for all classes. Exile Statue of von Stein at the town hall in Wetter, Hesse Coin with Vom Stein's likeness. Shortly afterwards, the reformer had to flee from Prussia. In August 1808, the French agents, who swarmed throughout the land, had seized one of his letters, in which he spoke of his hope that Germany would soon be ready for a national rising like that of Spain. On 10 September, Napoleon gave orders that Stein's property in the new kingdom of Westphalia should be confiscated, and he likewise put pressure on Frederick William to dismiss him. The king evaded compliance, but the French emperor, on entering Madrid in triumph, declared (16 December) Stein to be an enemy of France and the Confederation of the Rhine and ordered the confiscation of all his property in the Confederation. Stein saw that his life was in danger and fled from Berlin (5 January 1809). Thanks to the help of his former colleague, Count Friedrich Wilhelm von Reden, who gave him an asylum in his castle in the Riesengebirge, he succeeded in crossing the frontier into Bohemia. For three years, Stein lived in the Austrian Empire, generally at Brno, but in May 1812, in danger of being surrendered by Austria to Napoleon, he received an invitation to visit Saint Petersburg from Emperor Alexander I of Russia, who saw that Austria was certain to be on the side of France in the forthcoming Franco-Russian War. At the crisis of that struggle, Stein may have been one of the influences that kept the tsar determined never to treat with Napoleon. When the miserable remains of the Grand Army reeled back into Prussia at the close of the year, Stein urged the Russian emperor to go on and free Europe from the French domination. Freiherr von und zum Stein 1821 Bust of von Stein in front of the old University of Marburg Events now brought Stein rapidly to the front. On 30 December 1812, the Prussian general Ludwig Yorck von Wartenburg signed the Convention of Tauroggen with the Russian general Hans Karl von Diebitsch for neutralization of the Prussian corps at and near Tilsit and for the free passage of the Russians through that part of the king's dominions. The Russian emperor requested Stein to act as provisional administrator of the provinces of East and West Prussia. In that capacity, he convened an assembly of representatives of the local estates, which on 5 February 1813, ordered the establishment of a militia (Landwehr), a militia reserve and a final levy (Landsturm). The energy that Stein infused into all around him contributed not a little to this important decision, which pushed on the king's government to more decided action than then seemed possible. Stein now went to Breslau, to where the King of Prussia had proceeded, but the annoyance that Frederick William felt at his irregular action lessened his influence. The 1813 Treaty of Kalisz between Russia and Prussia cannot be claimed as due to Stein's actions, which were reprehended in court circles as those of a fanatic. At that time, the great patriot fell ill of a fever and complained of total neglect by the king and court. He recovered, however, in time to take part in the drafting of a Russo-Prussian convention (19 March 1813) respecting the administration of the districts that should be delivered from French occupation. During the varying phases of the campaign of 1813 Stein continued to urge the need of war √† outrance against Napoleon. The Allies, after the entry of England and Austria into the coalition, conferred on Stein the important duties of superintending the administration of the liberated territories. After the Battle of Leipzig (16‚Äì19 October 1813), Stein entered that city the day after its occupation by the Allies and thus expressed his feelings on the fall of Napoleon's domination: > There it lies, then, the monstrous fabric cemented by the blood and tears of > so many millions and reared by an insane and accursed tyranny. From one end > of Germany to the other we may venture to say aloud that Napoleon is a > villain and the enemy of the human race. Stein wanted to see Germany reconstituted as a nation but was frustrated by Austrian diplomat Prince Klemens Wenzel von Metternich, who gained the alliance of the rulers of south and central Germany for his empire, on the understanding that they were to retain their old powers. Austria and the secondary German states resisted all unifying proposals, and Stein blamed the Prussian chancellor Hardenberg for vacillation. Stein shared in the desire of Prussian statesmen to absorb Saxony; in that too, he was doomed to disappointment. On 24 May 1815, he sent to his patron, the emperor Alexander, a detailed criticism of the federal arrangements proposed for Germany. He retired after the Congress of Vienna and disliked the postponement of the representative system of government that Frederick William had promised to Prussia in May 1815. Later life His chief interest was in the study of history, and from 1818 to 1820, he worked hard to establish the society for the encouragement of historical research and the publication of the Monumenta Germaniae historica, of which his future biographer, Georg Heinrich Pertz, became the director. Stein died at Schloss Cappenberg in Westphalia on 29 June 1831. His burial ground is in the city of Bad Ems near Koblenz. Research has shown that Stein's credit for originating many of the far-reaching reforms of 1807/8 must be shared with Theodor von Sch√∂n and many others. A popular legend named him as the founder of the Tugendbund, an institution that he always distrusted. Stein's enlightenment, insight into the needs of the time, and energy gave momentum to the reform movement. Marriage and issue On 8 June 1793 he married the Countess Wilhelmine Magdalene von Wallmoden (22 June 1772 ‚Äì 15 September 1819), daughter of Johann Ludwig von Wallmoden-Gimborn, an illegitimate son of King George II of Great Britain. They had three daughters, including Henriette Luise (2 August 1796 ‚Äì 11 October 1855).

The elements that produce the head are wort protein, yeast and hop residue. The carbon dioxide that forms the bubbles in the head is produced during fermentation. The carbonation can occur before or after bottling the beer. If the beer continues fermenting in the bottle, then it naturally carbonates and the head is formed upon opening and/or pouring the beer. If the beer is pasteurized or filtered then the beer must be force carbonated using pressurized gas. The density and longevity of the head will be determined by the type of malt and adjunct from which the beer was fermented. Different mash schedules and cereal sources influence head retention. In general, wheat tends to produce larger and longer-lasting heads than barley. Closely related to the beer head is \\"lacing\\" or \\"lace\\", a white foamy residue left on the inside of the glass as the head recedes or as the beer is drunk. Just as the composition of the beer (proteins, hops, yeast residue, filtration) affects a beer's head, the amount of lacing is also closely controlled by the specific composition of the beer, and beer connoisseurs can tell much by the lacing, though strictly speaking beer quality is not readily apparent by the head or the lacing.  Importance  Consumers tend to place a lot of importance on beer heads: too much of a head is undesirable because it detracts from the mass of the drink (similar to carbonated soda drinks); on the other hand, a poured beer is viewed as incomplete unless it has the specific form of head expected for the type of beer. Some connoisseurs view the head on a beer as important because it helps provide the aroma of the beer. Another opinion is that it is important for the aesthetic look of the beer. The commercial significance of the head has led to academic studies. At least one study suggests that the head assists in transport of beer after pouring by damping oscillation (sloshing) and converting vertical movement into horizontal movement.(http://meetings.aps.org/link/BAPS.2014.DFD.H16.9) Formation through carbon dioxide The carbon dioxide may be produced naturally through the activity of brewers yeast, or artificially by dissolving carbon dioxide under pressure into the liquid. The beer head is created by the carbon dioxide produced as a byproduct of the metabolism of brewer's yeast acting upon starches and sugars found in the wort. Chemical composition While the actual foam activity of beer depends on the presence of carbon dioxide, it is the surface-active materials like amphipathic polypeptides from malt that determine size, shape and length of the foam. Beer foam consists of polypeptides of five different classifications, divided by their relative hydrophobicity. As the hydrophobicity of the polypeptide groups increases, so does the stability of the foam. Carbonation occurs when carbon dioxide is dissolved in water or an aqueous solution. This process is generally represented by the following reaction, where water and gaseous carbon dioxide react to form a dilute solution of carbonic acid. Importance of the glass A German wheat beer served in the traditional glassware. The glass has a half litre fill line and is designed with extra space specifically to accommodate the head. Beer glassware is often designed to accentuate or accommodate the head. Many other properties of the glass can also influence a beer head, such as a roughened surface at the base of glass known as a widget, providing for nucleation of carbon dioxide deep in the beverage rather than at the surface, resulting in a slower release of gas to the atmosphere. Glass surfaces can retain oil from the skin, aerosolized oil from nearby cooking, and traces of fat from food. When these oils come in contact with beer there is a significant reduction in the amount of head (foam) that is found on the beer, and the bubbles will tend to stick to the side of the glass rather than rising to the surface as normal. For proper foam formation, it is also important to dry the glass thoroughly after washing. Any water in the glass can prevent excitement of the gas by covering designs set in the bottom of the glass, thus making the beer flat. Conversely, some styles such as Belgian witbier benefit from being poured into a wet glass to control the often abundant head. Formation of 'nitrogen head' The creamy head on beers such as Guinness is created by a widget in cans or bottles using nitrogen, or by the process of drawing keg beer from a keg using nitrogen or mixed gas (carbon dioxide and nitrogen). The use of nitrogen, which was pioneered by Guinness, creates a firm head with small bubbles while reducing the excessively acidic taste often produced by using carbon dioxide alone. Destabilization One mechanism of destabilization of a beer foam is due to gravitational drainage. The water or liquid between the bubbles will drain and cause the liquid and gas phases to separate. This allows for the bubbles to become close enough to merge. This can be slowed down by increasing the viscosity of the liquid. Another mechanism of destabilization is ostwald ripening. Gas will diffuse from smaller bubbles to larger bubbles due to the high pressure associated with smaller bubbles. This can be explained by Laplace pressure. This can be slowed by a low solubility of the gas. An example of this is adding Nitrogen to the beer. A large effect can be seen with only a 20ppm addition of nitrogen gas. Beer froth has been scientifically demonstrated to decay exponentially. This research was awarded the 2002 Ig Nobel Prize in Physics.

Background McKay, a member of a prominent Republican family in the state, attended Seattle Preparatory School and the University of Washington, where he received a Bachelor of Arts degree in political science in 1978. After working as an aide to Congressman Joel Pritchard (R-WA) in 1978‚Äì79, McKay earned his J.D. degree at Creighton University School of Law in Omaha, Nebraska in 1982. He was admitted to the Washington State Bar and joined the Seattle law firm of Lane Powell Spears Lubersky in 1982, eventually becoming a litigation partner with that firm. He then joined Cairncross & Hempelmann in Seattle, leading its litigation group and serving as a member of its management committee. He was admitted to practice before the United States District Court, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, and the United States Supreme Court. Career as U.S. Attorney and dismissal McKay was one of eight U.S. attorneys fired by the Bush administration in 2006 which were, after the fact, publicly described as being for performance-related issues related to \\"policy, priorities and management.\\" Appointment as U.S. Attorney McKay was appointed United States Attorney by President George W.

Deputy Attorney General James B. Comey gave McKay the additional responsibility of overseeing a pilot program for a computer system (called Law Enforcement Information Exchange) for his success he earned the United States Navy's highest civilian honor. The Seattle Times noted in February 2007, \\"One of the most persistent rumors in Seattle legal circles is that the Justice Department forced McKay, a Republican, to resign to appease Washington State Republicans angry over the 2004 governor's race. Some believe McKay's dismissal was retribution for his failure to convene a federal grand jury to investigate allegations of voter fraud in the race.\\" On March 17, 2007, the Seattle Times reported, \\"Former Republican congressman Rick White, one of three candidates the Republicans have submitted to replace John McKay as U.S. attorney for Western Washington, cannot practice law in the state.

He was reinstated to the bar in 2005 after paying a small fee, but currently holds an 'inactive' status\\", which is common for attorneys that are not actively practicing law. In congressional testimony, Kyle Sampson, chief of staff to Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, testified that McKay may have been fired at least in part because of his advocacy for a more-aggressive investigation into the cold case murder of Assistant U.S. Attorney Thomas C. Wales of Seattle. His pursuit of the case and subsequent firing were the subjects of an article by Jeffrey Toobin in the August 6, 2007 issue of The New Yorker. Toobin noted that Gonzales assured Wales's family that the investigation was still a top priority of the Justice Department.

On September 17, 2007, Jonathan Klein, CEO of Getty Images, announced that McKay would be stepping down as general counsel to return to the law faculty at Seattle University where he will teach full- time. McKay is currently a partner at Davis Wright Tremaine in Seattle.https://www.dwt.com/people/JohnMcKay/ During his career as a U.S. Attorney, McKay was the prosecutor of Canadian marijuana activist Marc Emery for marijuana seed distribution from Canada.

Along with Dietmar Bartsch, she was the parliamentary chairperson of Die Linke from 2010 to 2019. Since 2009, she has been a member of the Bundestag.  Early life  Wagenknecht was born on 16 July 1969 in the East German city of Jena. Her father is Iranian and her mother, who worked for a state-run art distributor, is German. She was cared for primarily by her grandparents until 1976, when she and her mother moved to East Berlin. While in Berlin, she became a member of the Free German Youth (FDJ). She completed her Abitur exams in 1988 and joined the (then ruling) Socialist Unity Party (SED) in early 1989.\\"G√ºnter Gaus im Gespr√§ch mit Sahra Wagenknecht\\" from Rundfunk Berlin-Brandenburg (rbb), 11 February 2004.\\"Kurzbiographie \\" from www.sahra-wagenknecht.de (29 June 2007). From 1990, she studied Philosophy and New German Literature as an undergraduate in Jena and Berlin but dropped out. She then enrolled as a philosophy student at the University of Groningen where she earned an MA in 1996 for a thesis on the young Karl Marx's interpretation of Hegel, published as a book in 1997. From 2005 until 2012 she studied economics at the TU Chemnitz, where she earned a PhD with a dissertation on \\"The Limits of Choice: Saving Decisions and Basic Needs in Developed Countries\\", subsequently published by the Campus Verlag.Sahra Wagenknecht: The Limits of Choice: Saving Decisions and Basic Needs in Developed Countries. Campus Verlag, Oktober 2013, .  Political career  After the fall of the Berlin Wall and the transformation of the SED into the Party of Democratic Socialism (PDS), Wagenknecht was elected to the new party's National Committee in 1991. She also joined the PDS's Communist Platform, an orthodox Marxist faction. In the 1998 German federal election, Wagenknecht ran as the PDS candidate in a district of Dortmund, garnering 3.25% of the vote. Following the 1999 European elections, she was elected as a PDS representative to the European Parliament. Among her duties in the parliament is serving on the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Delegation, as well as the Euro-Latin American Parliamentary Assembly.Your MEPs : Introduction : Sahra WAGENKNECHT ‚Äì European Parliament profile Following the merger of the PDS and the WASG that formed the Left Party (Die Linke), Wagenknecht considered campaigning for the position of party vice- chair. However, party leaders such as Lothar Bisky and Gregor Gysi objected to the idea primarily because of her perceived sympathies for the former German Democratic Republic (GDR or East Germany). Following the controversy, she announced that she would not run for the post. Wagenknecht successfully contested a seat in the 2009 federal election in North Rhine-Westphalia.DIE LINKE.NRW (Party website), \\",\\" (21 April 2009). She became the Left Party's spokesperson for economic politics in the Bundestag. On 15 May 2010, she was at last elected vice-president of the Left Party with 75.3% of the vote. Early in 2012, the German press reported that Wagenknecht was one of 27 Left Party Bundestag members kept under surveillance by the security services. She has been one of the main driving forces in the formation of Aufstehen, a left- populist movement established in 2018, which exists outside of traditional political party structures and has been compared to the French movement La France Insoumise. In March 2019, Wagenknecht announced her withdrawal from her leadership role within Aufstehen, citing personal workload pressures and insisting that after a successful start-up phase, for which political experience was necessary, the time had come for the movement's own grass roots to resume control. She complained that the involvement of political parties at its heart had \\"walled in\\" (\\"sich eingemauert\\") the movement. She would nonetheless continue to make public appearances on its behalf.  Political views  Wagenknecht has argued that the Left Party must pursue radical and anti-capitalist goals, thereby remaining distinct from the more moderate Social Democratic Party (SPD) and Green Party. She has criticized the Left Party's participation in coalition governments, especially the Berlin state government, which has made cuts to social spending and privatized some services.\\"Nicht mitkungeln, sondern k√§mpfen,\\" statement co-signed by Wagenknecht (28 April 2007). She has expressed strong support for the rise of left-wing leaders in Latin America, such as Hugo Ch√°vez,\\"Kuba und Lateinamerika agieren selbstbewusster als fr√ºher\\" Linkszeitung (10 December 2005). and for SYRIZA's 2015 electoral victory in Greece. She serves as a spokesperson for the Venezuela Avanza solidarity network, and as an alternate on the European Parliament's delegation for relations with Mercosur. On 28 May 2016, an activist from the anti-fascist group Torten f√ºr Menschenfeinde (\\"Cakes for Enemies of Humanity\\") pushed a chocolate cake in Wagenknecht's face at a Left Party meeting in Magdeburg in response to Wagenknecht's calls for limits on the number of refugees. Wagenknecht has criticised Angela Merkel's refugee policies, arguing that her government has not provided the levels of financial and infrastructural support required to avoid increasing pressure on local authorities and the labour market, thereby exacerbating tensions in society. She has also claimed that Merkel's policies were partly to blame for the 2016 Berlin truck attack.

Two Chon languages are well attested: Selk'nam (or Ona), spoken by the people of the same name who occupied territory in the northeast of Tierra del Fuego; and Tehuelche spoken by the people of the same name who occupied territory north of Tierra del Fuego. The name 'Chon', or Tshon, is a blend of 'Tehuelche' and 'Ona'. Previous studies The Selk'nam people were widely studied by anthropologists such as Martin Gusinde and Anne Chapman throughout the 20th century. However, their language became extinct in the 1970s. History and demographics The northern Tehuelche were conquered and later assimilated by the Mapuche during the Araucanization of Patagonia. Some 1.7 million Mapuche continue to live in Chile and Argentina. Further south they traded peacefully with y Wladfa, the colony of Welsh settlers. Some Tehuelche learnt Welsh and left their children with the settlers for their education. A solid photographic record was made of this people. However, they were later nearly exterminated in the late 19th-century government-sponsored genocides of Patagonia.Brenzinger, 2007. Language diversity endangered. Walter de Gruyter.

It may affect the left ventricle, aorta, aortic valve, or mitral valve. Signs and symptoms Infant with cyanosis due to hypoplastic left heart syndrome Closing of the ductus arteriosus in a heart that is severely underdeveloped on the left results in cyanosis and respiratory distress which can progress to cardiogenic shock and death. The first symptoms are cyanosis that does not respond to oxygen administration or poor feeding. Peripheral pulses may be weak and extremities cool to the touch. HLHS often co-occurs with low birth weight and premature birth. In neonates with a small atrial septal defect, termed \\"restrictive\\", there is inadequate mixing of oxygenated and deoxygenated blood. These neonates quickly decompensate and develop acidosis and cyanosis. On EKG, right axis deviation and right ventricular hypertrophy are common, but not indicative of HLHS. Chest x-ray may show a large heart (cardiomegaly) or increased pulmonary vasculature. Neonates with HLHS do not typically have a heart murmur, but in some cases, a pulmonary flow murmur or tricuspid regurgitation murmur may be audible. Co-occurring tricuspid regurgitation or right ventricular dysfunction can cause hepatomegaly to develop. Causes Diagram of a healthy heart and one with hypoplastic left heart syndrome There is no known cause in the majority of HLHS cases. Some cases may have a genetic component, as HLHS has been shown to be heritable and associated with specific gene mutations. Not all, but some, cases of aortic stenosis in a fetus can put stress on the left ventricle in utero, that can eventually lead to decreased perfusion and stop the growth of the left ventricle. = Environmental causes = In a retrospective analysis of over 1,300 newborns (born between 1996 and 2006) from 24 children‚Äôs hospitals in the United States, researchers at Cincinnati Children‚Äôs Hospital in Ohio found that babies with HLHS were more likely to be born in summer months, suggesting that seasonality and environmental factors may play a significant role in causation. =Genetics= Genetic loci associated with HLHS include GJA1 (connexin 43), HAND1, NKX2.5, 10q22, and 6q23. There is a slight risk of recurrence in future pregnancies, estimated to be 2-4%, which increases to 25% in families with two affected children. This is thought to be mediated by genetic mutations with incomplete penetrance. HLHS is also associated with several genetic syndromes, including trisomy 13 (Patau syndrome), trisomy 18 (Edwards syndrome), partial trisomy 9, Turner's syndrome (XO), Jacobsen syndrome (11q deletion syndrome), Holt-Oram syndrome, and Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome. = Risk factors = Presence of a cystic hygroma increases the risk of HLHS in a fetus.  Pathophysiology  At birth, the ductus arteriosus is still open, and there is higher than normal resistance to blood flow in the lungs. This allows for adequate oxygenation via mixing between the atria and a normal appearance at birth. When the ductus begins to close and pulmonary vascular resistance decreases, blood flow through the ductus is restricted and flow to the lungs is increased. In typical anatomy, the left side of the heart receives oxygen-rich blood from the lungs and pumps it to the rest of the body. In people with HLHS, the aorta and left ventricle are underdeveloped (beginning in utero), and the aortic and mitral valves are either too small to allow sufficient blood flow or are atretic (closed) altogether. As blood returns from the lungs to the left atrium, it cannot be pumped to the rest of the body by the left ventricle. The neonate is reliant on blood flowing through an atrial septal defect to mix oxygenated and deoxygenated blood, and on a patent ductus arteriosus to allow blood to reach the aorta and the systemic circulation via the right ventricle. This is what defines HLHS as a \\"single ventricle\\" defect. Due to the underdevelopment of the left side of the heart in utero, the increased afterload causes hypertension of the left atrium, pulmonary edema, and therefore lung damage to the fetus before birth. Diagnosis Hypoplastic left heart syndrome can be diagnosed prenatally or after birth via echocardiography. Typical findings include a small left ventricle and aorta, abnormalities of the mitral and aortic valves, retrograde flow in the transverse arch of the aorta, and left-to-right flow between the atria. It is often recognized during the second trimester of pregnancy, between 18 and 24 weeks' gestation. Management =Medical= Without life-prolonging interventions, HLHS is fatal, but with intervention, an infant may survive. A cardiothoracic surgeon may perform a series of operations or a full heart transplant. While surgical intervention has emerged as the standard of care in the United States, other national health systems, notably in France, approach diagnosis of HLHS in a more conservative manner, with an emphasis on termination of pregnancy or compassionate care after delivery. Before surgery, the ductus must be kept open to allow blood-flow using medication containing prostaglandin. Air with less oxygen than normal is used for infants with hypoplastic left heart syndrome. These low oxygen levels increases the pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) and thus improve blood flow to the rest of the body due to the greater pressure difference between the lungs and body. Achieving oxygen levels below atmosphere requires the use of inhaled nitrogen. Nitric oxide is a potent pulmonary vasodilator, and thus reduces PVR and improves venous return. Any factor that increases PVR will impede right sided flow. =Surgical= Surgical operations to assist with hypoplastic left heart are complex and need to be individualized for each patient. A cardiologist must assess all medical and surgical options on a case-by-case basis. Currently, infants undergo either the staged reconstructive surgery (Norwood or Sano procedure within a few days of birth, Glenn or Hemi-Fontan procedure at 3 to 6 months of age, and the Fontan procedure at 1 1/2 to 5 years of age) or cardiac transplantation.Hypoplastic Left Heart Syndrome (HLHS)  The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia Current expectations are that 70% of those with HLHS may reach adulthood. Many studies show that the higher the volume (number of surgeries performed) at a hospital, the lower the mortality (death) rate. Factors that increase an infant's risk include lower birth weight, additional congenital anomalies, a genetic syndrome or those with a highly restrictive atrial septum.) For patients without these additional risk factors, 5 year survival now approaches 80%. Studies show that about 75% of those children who survive surgery show developmental delays in one or more areas, such as motor, cognitive, or language impairments, with about a third of single-ventricle children without a genetic syndrome having significant impairments. Current research focuses on charting the connections between neurodevelopment injuries, surgical and intensive care procedures, and genetic susceptibility with the goal of modifying interventions that impair neurodevelopmental and psychosocial outcomes. An alternative to the traditional Norwood is the Hybrid procedure. Some physicians offer compassionate care, instead of the surgeries, which results in the child's death, usually within 2 weeks of birth. Compassionate care is overseen by a physician, and may be carried out either in the hospital or at home. However, due to the vast improvement of surgical intervention, with many hospitals achieving over 90% survival, there is debate on whether or not compassionate care should still be offered to families. A study in 2003 concluded that a selection of physicians who are experts in the care of children with HLHS were evenly split when asked what they would do if their own children were born with HLHS, with 1/3 stating that they would choose surgery, 1/3 stating that they would choose palliative (compassionate) treatment without surgery, and 1/3 stating that they are uncertain which choice they would make. The three- stage procedure is a palliative procedure (not a cure), as the child's circulation is made to work with only two of the heart's four chambers.  Norwood procedure  The first step is the Norwood procedure. In this procedure, the right ventricle is used to pump blood into the systemic circulation. Since the right ventricle is no longer directly pumping blood to the lungs, a shunt is required in order to pass deoxygenated blood through the lungs. Either the subclavian artery can be connected to the pulmonary circulation (Blalock-Taussig shunt), or a shunt is made directly from the right ventricle to the pulmonary circulation (Sano shunt). The narrow aorta is enlarged using a patch to improve blood flow to the body. During this time the baby may be medically fragile and have feeding problems because the heart is working very hard. There is a considerable degree of venous mixing in the right ventricle, leading to lower oxygenation saturation. In addition, both the Blalock-Taussig and the Sano shunts expose the lungs to systemic arterial pressures, leading to long-term pulmonary hypertension and eventually heart failure. Hybrid procedure The Hybrid procedure may be used in place of the Norwood. The Hybrid procedure does not necessitate the use of heart-lung bypass or performing a sternotomy. Instead of a six-hour surgery, the Hybrid typically takes one to two hours. In this procedure, a stent is placed in the ductus arteriosus to maintain its patency, and bands are placed over both the left and right pulmonary artery branches to limit pressure and over- circulation to the lungs.Children's Hospital Boston  Pediatric Views Outcomes with the Hybrid approach are comparable to those with the Norwood. Glenn procedure The second stage--the bidirectional Glenn or Hemi-Fontan (see also Kawashima procedure)--relieves some of the problems introduced by Stage I palliation. In this operation, the superior vena cava is ligated from the heart and connected to the pulmonary circulation. At this time, the Blalock- Taussig or Sano shunt is taken down. The lungs are no longer exposed to systemic arterial pressures, but much lower venous pressures. Although venous blood from the upper half of the body is no longer mixing with oxygenated blood in the right ventricle, there is still venous mixing from the lower half of the body, leading to some degree of oxygen desaturation. Fontan procedure upright=1.5 The final procedure, the Fontan procedure, completes the repair of the hypoplastic left heart. Although there are several variations, the functional effect is to redirect venous blood from the lower body (through the inferior vena cava) away from the right atrium to the pulmonary artery. This should eliminate any mixing of oxygenated and deoxygenated blood in the right ventricle. The right ventricle performs the traditional job of the left, supplying the body with oxygenated blood, while the passive systemic venous pressure performs the traditional job of the right, passing deoxygenated blood to the lungs. = Fetal surgery = Interventions performed during fetal development are under investigation. In fetuses with hypoplastic left ventricles and an intact interatrial septum, percutaneous atrial septostomy has been attempted. Prognosis 95% of untreated infants with HLHS die in the first weeks of life. Early survival has improved since the introduction of the Norwood procedure. Since there are no long-term studies of HLHS adults, statistics are usually derived from post- Fontan patients; it is estimated that 70% of HLHS patients may reach adulthood. Prognosis is dependent upon the health of the child, as there is an increased demand on respiratory and heart rate in infants during common childhood illnesses. This fragile population has little cardiac reserve to accommodate these demands and provide hemodynamic stability during illnesses. Children with HLHS and other comparable single-ventricle conditions, as a group, have poorer neurodevelopmental outcomes than their healthy peers. Deficits in language, executive functioning, and higher rates of anxiety and depression disorders have been demonstrated. Some of these outcomes may be a consequence of genetic factors associated with HLHS, and others may be modifiable through changes to procedures and to the healthcare environment. There is an emerging clinical consensus around the importance of continuous neurodevelopmental surveillance from the earliest years into adulthood. As is true for patients with other types of heart defects involving malformed valves, HLHS patients run a high risk of endocarditis, and must be monitored by a cardiologist for the rest of their lives to check on their heart function. Heart transplantation may be indicated, typically after Fontan completion. One multi-center study (of patients undergoing the Fontan from 1993-2001) reported a 76% 1-year survival rate in patients who survived to transplant. Epidemiology HLHS occurs in an estimated 1 out of 4,300 live births in the United States, or an estimated total of 960 live births per year in that country. Overall, it is estimated to make up 2-3% of all cases of congenital heart disease, and is the most common single-ventricle defect. It is thought to be more common in male infants, 1.5 times as common as in female infants. References  External links  *Hypoplastic left heart syndrome information for parents.

She is a spokesperson for the Tiger Trade Campaign, an alliance of 38 organisations \\"to bring back wild tigers by stopping trade in tiger parts and products from all sources.\\" In an interview supporting the campaign, Vodianova said: \\"I'm proud that Russia, my country, is home to the most magnicifent of animals, the wild Siberian tiger. Today it is up to us to protect the tiger and its home, fewer than 350 Siberian tigers remain in the wild and no more than 3,400 tigers survive anywhere in the world. Unless we act now we will see the extinction of the wild tiger within our lifetime.\\" Since 2015, an annual \\"Fabulous Fund Fair\\" is co-hosted by Vodianova and Karlie Kloss.

A prominent politician in the state, Boon was instrumental the formation of the state Democratic Party, and he supported President Andrew Jackson's policies during his six terms representing Indiana in the United States House of Representatives. Early life =Background and education= Ratliff Boon was born January 18, 1781 in Franklin County, North Carolina, the son of Jesse and Kessiah Boon. At a young age he moved with his parents to Warren County, Kentucky where he attended a public grade school and later apprenticed as a gunsmith in Danville, Kentucky.Woollen, p. 42 In 1801 he was married to Delilah Anderson, together the couple had seven children. In 1809 he moved to what is now Boon Township of Warrick County, Indiana. Boonville, the county seat, was later named in his honor. At the outbreak of the War of 1812, Boon joined the Indiana Territorial militia and eventually rose to the rank of colonel.Woollen, p. 49 Public office =Legislator= Warrick County was organized in 1813 and Boon was appointed by Governor Thomas Posey to the position of County Treasurer. In 1816 he was elected to the first state legislature where he served two one-year terms. During his terms, his primary accomplishment was successfully promoting legislation to divide Warrick County into three separate counties. He was elected to the state senate in December 1818 but resigned after winning the election to become the second Lieutenant Governor in December 1819.Gugin, p. 49 Christopher Harrison had resigned his position as lieutenant governor after a scandal, leaving no incumbent. Two other men briefly competed against Boon for the position, but he defeated them in the general election, 7,397 votes to his closest competitors 3,882. In 1820 the legislature passed laws to lower the wolf population. Wolves had been creating havoc on the frontier. They offered a premium reward for wolf pelts, Boon capitalized on the new law and earned more than seven-hundred dollars by killing wolves. His success led to the rapid repeal of the law which quickly became a drain on the state's limited resources.Woollen, 50 =Governor= In 1822 he was re-elected as lieutenant governor on a ticket with William Hendricks. When Governor Jonathan Jennings resigned to take a seat in Congress, Boon succeeded him and became the second governor of the state on September 12, 1822 and served until Hendricks's inauguration on December 5, 1822. Boon's only act of consequence during his short time as governor was to conduct a census of the area purchased by the Treaty of St. Mary's and make recommendations for the creation of counties in the region. His proposal was adopted by the General Assembly, which organized county governments and created three seats in the assembly to provide representation to the subjects of the census. Boon returned to the lieutenant governor's office and remained in that position until January 30, 1824, when he resigned after winning the election to the United States House of Representatives.Woollen, p. 43Gugin, p. 50 =Congressman= Boon was elected as a Jacksonian and served in Congress from March 4, 1825 to March 3, 1827. He was unsuccessful in his re-election attempt in 1826, defeated by Thomas H. Blake who ran on an internal improvement platform which Boon's party was opposed to. During the term he sat out of office, he was instrumental in establishing the Democratic Party in Indiana. Up until that time, there were no formal political parties in the state, and all politicians loosely affiliated with the Democratic-Republican Party. He ran again for the office in 1828, and won. He served in Congress again from March 4, 1829 to March 3, 1839. While in congress he was chairman of the Committee on Public Lands from 1835 until 1839. He made an unsuccessful run for re-election in 1839, and was defeated by Oliver H. Smith. The same year of his defeat, Boon moved to Louisiana, Missouri. In Missouri he quickly rose in prominence and became a fierce opponent of Thomas H. Benton and the pro-slavery faction of the state government. In 1844 he ran for Congress again, hoping to defeat the pro-slavery candidate, but he became ill and withdrew from the race. Boon remained sick and died shortly after hearing of his party's victory in the election. He died there on November 20, 1844. He is interred in Riverview Cemetery of Louisiana, his son, Baily Hart Boon, later erected a monument over his grave.Woollen, p. 47 References Notes Bibliography External links *Biography from Indiana State Library *Ratliff Boon at FindAGrave 1781 births 1844 deaths Democratic-Republican Party state governors of the United States Governors of Indiana Indiana state senators Lieutenant Governors of Indiana Indiana Democratic- Republicans Indiana Democrats Indiana Jacksonians People from Louisiana, Missouri Members of the Indiana House of Representatives Members of the United States House of Representatives from Indiana People from Warrick County, Indiana People from Indiana in the War of 1812 People from Franklin County, North Carolina Jacksonian members of the United States House of Representatives Democratic Party members of the United States House of Representatives 19th-century American politicians ","title":"Ratliff Boon"},{"id":"1797941","text":"Commander Frank Ragan King (October 15, 1884 ‚Äì July 12, 1919) was an officer in the United States Navy who died while conducting minesweeping operations shortly after World War I.

Record collecting is the hobby of collecting sound recordings, usually of music, but sometimes \\"spoken word\\" (poetry reading ,comedy, historical speeches, etc.), in some cases (mostly on a smaller scale), other recorded sounds (e.g. ambient, airport, sounds of nature; bird calls, river, country, rural, forest, and other soundscapes etc.). Although the typical focus is on vinyl records, all formats of recorded music can be collected. Scope of a record collection The scope of a record collection may include a focus on any of the following categories: * genres (or subgenres), e.g. Blues, Soul, doo wopFunk, oldies, Go-go, reggae, hip hop, Jazz, Rare groove, country music, bluegrass, 60s/70s rock, rockabilly, ragtime, swing, gospel music, novelty records, Classical etc. * artists (or producers, etc), e.g. Grateful Dead , Frank Zappa, The Beatles, The Rolling Stones, Charlie Parker, Muddy Waters, James Brown, Miles Davis, P Funk, Bob Marley & the Wailers, etc. * recording labels (or sublabels), e.g. Blue Note, Stax Records, Motown, Hi Records, Goldwax Records, Fame, Philadelphia International Records, Apple Records, Sun Records, Yazoo Records, Charly Records, Rhino Records, Folkways Records(Smithsonian Folkways), etc. * periods (or music scenes), e.g. From 1920s to 1970s, Northern Soul, Philadelphia soul, country blues, bebop, Chicago blues, etc. * formats, e.g. 78s, 7\\"s, LPs, EPs, Mono, Reel-to-reel, Cassettes, 45s, SPs, CDs, etc. * specialisms, e.g. unusual physical specimens (odd shapes, colors, sizes, speeds) regardless of recorded content, records having original \\"stock\\" generic sleeves identifying the label, or variations in the record's label design as issued by particular companies. Demand is usually highest for the \\"original\\" or earliest pressings of records, often identified by variations in the label or cover. Avid collectors develop specialized knowledge about such details. =Pressings= One collectible record format is known as a test pressing. Five to 10 initial copies are often pressed for the purpose of checking the mix or levels on a record, or to ensure that the die is cutting properly. Though usually meant for the artist, producer, pressing plant, or record label to keep as reference, they are sometimes placed in special packaging (such as a photocopy of the real record sleeve) and given out to friends or devoted fans. First pressings of original commercial releases usually have higher values among collectors than later pressings. Also collectible are 45s with picture sleeves, and original editions of LPs (and other formats) which often have inserts and other features not on subsequent editions, or tracks or cover art later withdrawn or altered. Subsequent pressings often have the same label and catalog number but can be differentiated from the first pressings by the cover, colour of the label, matrix numbers on the disc itself, etc. =Promos, reissues and bootlegs= Promotional or \\"promo\\" copies are free records, cassettes or CDs sent to radio stations (and others) to announce a new release coming soon from the record company. They are identified by the label, which typically takes the form of plain text listing the name of the recording and its associated credits, as well as markings specifying it as \\"Promotional\\", \\"Audition,\\" \\"Demonstration\\" and/or \\"Not for Sale.\\" Record and cassette promo copies typically come in the form of white label discs and clear cassettes, respectively, while CD copies typically come in the form of CD-Rs with black-on-transparent labels. Because many commercial cassette releases use identical clear plastic and white print, promo copies are oftentimes distinguished solely by text on the J-card specifying them as such. Promo copies of best-selling records can have a slightly lower or higher value than \\"stock\\" first pressings. Occasionally promo copies were pressed for records that were never released; include other songs or features not found on the official commercial release (e.g. Talking Heads' 1988 album Naked). Reissues of popular records can be released by the same label many years later with the same catalog number and cover art, but are often undertaken by a different label, some of which (such as Rhino Recordss) specialize in reissues and have access to certain labels' catalogs and \\"vaults\\" of unreleased master recordings. \\"Bootlegs\\" are illegitimate releases. They vary in value and in sound and pressing quality, and come in several categories. Bootleg LPs, tapes and CDs often feature recordings from live performances or tracks not commercially released (including those never intended for release that were stolen or illegitimately acquired). Some bootleg 45s are re-releases of rare or valuable singles ‚Äì exact copies of rare records, with the original label graphics and numbers - known in the industry as \\"counterfeits.\\" History =Background= Record collecting has been around probably nearly as long as recorded sound. In its earliest years, phonographs and the recordings that were played on them (first wax phonograph cylinders, and later flat shellac discs) were mostly owned by the rich, out of the reach of the middle or lower classes. By the 1920s, improvements in the manufacturing processes, both in players and recordings, allowed prices for the machines to drop. While entertainment options in a middle to upper-class home in the 1890s would likely consist of a piano, smaller instruments, and a library of sheet music, by the 1910s and later these options expanded to include a radio and a library of recorded sound. After the phonograph cylinder became obsolete, the record was the uncontested sound medium for decades. The number of available recordings mushroomed and the number of companies pressing records increased These were 78‚Äìrpm, originally one-sided, then later double- sided, ten-inch shellac discs, with about two to four minutes of recording time on each side. Growth in the recorded sound industries was stunted by the Great Depression and World War II, when the recording industries in some countries were affected by a restricted supply of raw materials. By the time World War II ended, the economy of these countries began to grow again. Classical music (which was a large portion of 78‚Äìrpm releases) was slowly edged into a minority status by the influx of popular and new music, which was less costly and thus more profitable to record. =Early collecting= Music journalist Amanda Petrusich has reported that retrospective 78 collecting began in the 1940s, focusing on rare early Dixieland jazz recordings. In several articles and in her book Do Not Sell At Any Price, she writes about 78rpm record collectors such as James McKune, an influential collector of jazz from the late 1930s and of country blues. =1950s= The introduction of both the 33 rpm, 12-inch LP record and the 45‚Äìrpm, 7-inch record, coming into the market in 1948/1949, provided advances in both storage and quality. These records featured vinyl (polyvinyl chloride or polystyrene), replacing the previous shellac materials. Further groups of small labels came into existence with the dawning of the rock and roll era in the early-to-middle 1950s, and the growth of a market among post-war teenagers with disposable income to spend on 45‚Äìrpm singles. Rock and roll was much less costly and more profitable to produce than the big band jazz and professional singer/song- craftsman music that it replaced in popularity. Ronald D. Cohen relates that the hillbilly-focused Disc Collector magazine was formed in 1951. Various important online library catalogues list copies of Burke's Register of Record Collectors, which existed from 1957 at the latest. In the United Kingdom, rare 78‚Äìrpms were traded, usually American rock and roll, musicians and rekcord labels such as Little Richard Chuck Berry, and Sun Records. Labels such as London-American (now London Records), RCA Victor and Capitol were priced at a premium. One of the earliest UK record collectors was Mike Adams, who was first known for trading in 1958 on Merseyside. He later became a DJ on the BBC and broadcast on collecting records for many years. He wrote several books on collecting including Apple Beatle Collectables. In the UK, labels considered collectible, such as Atlantic Records, Sun Records, Motown, and Parlophone (EMI), turned into mainstream major record labels later on in the 1960s. In the US, New York's Times Square store is widely acknowledged for feeding the doowop revival of the early sixties, attention focusing on them from 1959. =1960s= With the folk music boom in the late 1950s to early 1960s, there was suddenly a demand for archival material. Record collectors fanned out in some countries, searching small towns, dusty barns and mountain cabins for older discs. Initially, the most-desired items were pre-World War II shellac discs containing \\"race records\\" (that is, blues, country blues and hillbilly music), the precursors to then-current rock and roll and country styles. Later generations of record collectors found their passion in digging up obscure 45s in the genre of doo-wop, or LPs from the late 1960s \\"garage rock\\" and \\"psychedelic\\" genres. The pop music scene changed with the rise in popularity of The Beatles between 1962 and 1964. In their wake, thousands of musical bands inspired by their fresh, lively take on rock music with a sharp British sensibility, picked up guitars, and many released records. Many of these acolytes released 45‚Äìrpm records in small batches to sell at local concerts and to their friends and families. Due to their relatively small pressings, these obscure local records became highly prized and valuable. One of the famous \\"collector's items\\" in record collecting is not a record at all, but merely an album cover. The Beatles themselves accidentally contributed what is probably one of the most well-known and valuable \\"collector's pieces\\" of the rock and roll era: \\"The Butcher Cover\\". This is an informal title for an album cover for the album Yesterday and Today. Until 1967, the Beatles' LP releases in the UK were substantially different from their LP releases in the USA. These American albums were shorter, had different songs, album titles and artwork. Another Holy Grail for some collectors is Bob Dylan's The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan, the 1963 pressing that has four songs that were deleted from subsequent pressings, known to fetch up to $35,000 in stereo and $16,500 in mono in excellent condition. =1970s= In the 1970s, the record collecting hobby was aided by the establishment of record collecting publications such as Goldmine, DISCoveries, and Stormy Weather, and in the UK, Record Collector. Price guide books were published, codifying exactly how much certain \\"rare items\\" were supposed to be worth. The \\"grading\\" of records based upon condition became more standardized across the hobby with the publication of these price guides. =1980s & 90s= The Blues Brothrs Jonh Belushi and Dan Aykroyd were record collectors, and they paid tribute to blues and soul musicians With the introduction of the compact disc in the middle 1980s, there began a stratification in the hobby; commonly found vinyl specimens that had been pressed in the hundreds of thousands or even millions of copies became relatively worthless, while the rarest of specimens became ever more valuable. These rare items included 45‚Äìrpm discs in the genres of blues, rhythm and blues, soul, doo wop, jazz, progressive rock, and psychedelic rock. Other rare and highly valued items include pieces from highly collectible artists such as The Beatles, Grateful Dead, James Brown, Bob Dylan, Janis Joplin, Jimi Hendrix, The Doors, and The Rolling Stones. Some are pressings from nations where they were pressed in very small quantities (such as the Sex Pistols' South African release of \\"God Save The Queen\\"). Thanks to the Hip Hop artists such at A Tribe Called Quest, DJ Premier, Monie Love and others, sampling older records that are household classics for Generation X from genres such as Funk, Jazz curated a dynamic where these records are repackaged & rebirthed for Generation Y. =2000s= Even in the 21st century, as music fans have often opted for digital downloads over physical releases (and indeed started to collect these in the same way as vinyl), certain contemporary bands have a following of record collectors. This is prominent for instance in the punk and alternative genres. For example, the special edition of NOFX's 1999 release, The Decline, on transparent vinyl has already reached prices of $1500. Due to the DIY ethic and constrained budget of many punk bands and labels, releases by lesser-known bands tend to be in limited edition. Specific pressing runs of records are sometimes printed on different colored vinyl, have new or different songs, contain spelling or mixing errors, or may be in lower quantity than other pressings. All such factors increase a specific record's collectibility. For instance, in 1988, New York City hardcore band Judge attempted to record their debut Bringin' It Down at Chung King Studios. The bad experience and low quality result left the band so disappointed that they scrapped the session and re-recorded the LP elsewhere. The older sessions, however, were pressed onto 110 copies of white vinyl entitled Chung King Can Suck It! and sent to fans who had pre-ordered Bringin It Down to reward them for their patience, as re-recording caused a major delay in the release. Copies of the record have been sold for up to $6,800 on sites like eBay. Other music genres also have fervent adherents. For instance, fans of folk rock, psychedelia and other genres have become ever more interested in original short-run vinyl private pressings. Even when these have been reissued, the originals can continue to attract high prices. The first wave of classical collectors concentrated on early stereo orchestral recordings on labels such as the British Decca and EMI, and the American Mercury Records Living Presence series and RCA Victor Living Stereo series. Some of these records still sell at auction for hundreds of dollars. However, the focus of the top classical collectors has now shifted to earlier material, and rare European monos from the 1950s by top artists have become highly sought after. The Far Eastern collectors who dominate this market tend to prefer chamber music, and solo violin and cello. Others still focus on antique 78s. As of 2011 many pressing plants have been reactivated and new releases in vinyl are appearing on an increasing basis, causing what many have called a revival of the format. The volume of product (9.2 million units sold in 2014, 6 percent of total music sales) confirms a continuing niche interest in the format, while formats such as CDs fail to compete with digital downloads. Sales of Cassette Music Tapes have also increased in recent years (2014-2019) with a Cassette Tape interest revival almost comparable to Vinyl Records.  Crate digging  A more intense method of record collecting, known as crate digging, involves thorough searching of record bins to find a recording of interest. This practice is associated with and holds a particular prestige for hip hop producers, who searched for rare records with sounds to sample for a newly created recording. In her account of the North American hip-hop crate diggers of the 1980s, media and culture theorist Elodie A. Roy writes, \\"As they trailed second-hand shops and car boot sales ‚Äì depositories of unwanted capitalist surplus ‚Äì diggers were bound to encounter realms of mainstream, mass-produced LP records now fallen out of grace and fashion. They primarily used them as raw material, seeking to create beats out of them.\\" Speaking of crate digging's broader role in hip hop culture, academic and ethnomusicologist Joseph G. Schloss says: While the practice of collecting in general was historically a bourgeoisie phenomenon tied to antiques and the fine arts, the North American hip-hop crate-diggers of the 1980s helped give rise to what material culture scholar Paul Martin calls the \\"popular collector\\" ‚Äì generally interested in \\"obtainable, affordable and appealing\\" items and a consequence of mass production. With the rise of digital media in the following decades, this transitioned to the \\"digital\\" and \\"electronic\\" collector. Concurrently, the demise of physical music stores allowed for websites to emerge as domains for crate digging, including the music review database AllMusic, the streaming service Spotify, and Discogs, which began as a music database before developing into an online marketplace for physical music releases.

Regency Records was originally a part of the C-R-Co (Cherokeeland Recording Company), based in Calhoun, Georgia near the 19th century national capital of the Cherokee Indians. The label operated as a part of Jay Enterprises when Carter moved to Tennessee in 1966, and became a part of Cherokee Album Corporation when Carter returned to Georgia in 1968. Regency released a series of singles, and one album in 1972 by a Tennessee garage band Neutral Spirits. The self-titled album by the group is a highly prized collector's item worldwide, because most copies of the disc were destroyed in a fire. The original analog master tape was preserved by the producer, and has been released on CD, as well as by Florida re-release label GearFab. Regency later became the home of the Dutch rock band Diesel in the early 1980s, releasing a pair of this band's albums, the first of which included the internationally successful hit, \\"Sausalito Summernight.\\" During this period, Regency was distributed by Warner Communications.

Early life, family, and education Fred Reinfeld was born in New York City, and lived his entire life within its metropolitan area. His father Barnett Reinfeld was of Polish-Jewish heritage, while his mother Rose (Pogrezelsky) was of Romanian-Jewish heritage.http://billwall.phpwebhosting.com/articles/reinfeld.htm Reinfeld learned chess in his early teen years, and played for his high school team. He joined the Marshall Chess Club in Manhattan in 1926.Wall He became involved in correspondence chess while in high school.chessgames.com, the Fred Reinfeld games collection Reinfeld attended New York University and the College of the City of New York, studying accounting. He won the U.S. Intercollegiate championship in 1929 while at NYU. He married his fianc√©e Beatrice in 1932. They had two children: Donald in 1942 and Judith in 1947. Chess writing Fred Reinfeld was a prolific author, having written or co-written well over 100 books. Reinfeld began writing about chess in late 1932.wall His first book, co-authored with Isaac Kashdan, was an account of the Bled 1931 master tournament. He became a charter writer for the new magazine Chess Review in 1933, and was a senior editor there by 1947. More than half of his books were about chess, including books on the opening (Winning Chess Openings), the middlegame (1001 Winning Chess Sacrifices and Combinations), and game collections (Great Brilliancy Prize Games of the Chess Masters), as well as biographies of Alexander Alekhine, Jos√© Ra√∫l Capablanca, Paul Keres, Emanuel Lasker (co-written with Reuben Fine), Paul Morphy (Andrew Soltis completed and published this book years after Reinfeld's death), and Aron Nimzowitsch. Most of Reinfeld's chess books, such as The Complete Chess Player, were geared toward novice players. Many players received their first introduction to the game through his books. Reinfeld also wrote books for more advanced players, but they sold fewer copies. He certainly had the chess knowledge, research skills and writing ability to write high-quality books, but decided to specialize in basic books for chess beginners, since they sold much better, and he was able to make a living from this. In 1996, Reinfeld became the 26th person inducted into the U.S. Chess Hall of Fame, and the first inducted primarily for his writing.Notes: See Wikipedia article on World Chess Hall of Fame, which also has U.S. Chess Hall of Fame inductees listed; every prior inductee of the U.S. Hall was either a national and/or international champion, a problemist, an organizer/promoter, or, if a writer, was also memorable for other achievements (such as Herman Helms, who was known for his writing but also for his promotion and organizing), while Reinfeld was a strong player but not a national champion, and did not contribute in other areas. Competitive chess =Playing strength= Although Reinfeld is remembered today mainly for his writing, he was also one of the strongest chess players in the United States from the early 1930s to the early 1940s, after which he withdrew from competition. He was ranked sixth in the country, with a rating of 2593, on the first rating list issued by the United States Chess Federation in 1950, after Reuben Fine, Samuel Reshevsky, Alexander Kevitz, Arthur Dake, and Albert Simonson.As of July 31, 1950, the top ratings were Fine (2817), Reshevsky (2770), Kevitz (2610), Dake (2598), Simonson (2596), Reinfeld (2593), Arnold Denker (2575), Isaac Kashdan (2574), I.

Although he was never formally awarded an international title in chess, his playing strength during his peak years, measured by his rating, places him at or near the International Master class. International titles were awarded by FIDE, the World Chess Federation, beginning in 1950, while international chess ratings were started in 1970. The United States was one of the first nations to implement a national rating system, using work done by Professor Arpad Elo, and his statistical methods were later adapted to international chess as well. The chessmetrics group, which retrospectively rates chess events and players, endeavoring to estimate the playing strengths of players on an historical basis, places Reinfeld with a peak rating of 2532 in May 1942, good for #70 in the world.

The character is voiced by Eddie Murphy. He is described as unattractive, awkward, and as the goofy best friend of the main character, Shrek. Donkey in Shrek films =Shrek (2001)= Donkey first makes his debut at a sale of mythical characters from beloved fairy-tales being sold to the evil Lord Farquaad's knights. An old woman attempts to sell Donkey, but magic pixie dust accidentally is unleashed upon him from a caged fairy, thus giving him the temporary ability to fly. However, the spell unleashed upon Donkey then breaks and he falls to the ground, being chased by Farquaad's knights into the woods, where he meets Shrek. Shrek is at first reluctant to meet the talkative and annoying Donkey, who begins following him around. Donkey requests to stay with Shrek since he has no one else. Shrek refuses, but finally gives in due to Donkey's constant begging, however, he only allows him to stay outside of his house and only for one night. When Shrek discovers all the fairy tale creatures are residing in his swamp, Donkey denies bringing them to the swamp, and the creatures reveal that Lord Farquaad evicted them there. Seeing how Donkey knows where Farquaad is and is the only one who is willing to help Shrek, he accompanies Shrek to Duloc, Farquaad's kingdom. When they arrive, however, Farquaad has his men try to kill Shrek in an arena to find the perfect champion to find and bring him back Princess Fiona, whom he wants to make his bride. Donkey and Shrek easily defeat Farquaad's men, and Farquaad decides to have Shrek be his champion instead. However, Shrek shows no interest, and only demands his swamp back. When Farquaad offers Shrek a deal to return him his swamp if he agrees to go on the quest, Shrek agrees, and Donkey follows Shrek on his quest to find Fiona. While coming to the castle, Donkey unintentionally catches the unwanted attention of the fire-breathing dragon. Shrek escapes, but Donkey is caught and cornered. Before the dragon attempts to doom him, he tries to avoid his fate by complimenting the dragon, whom he discovers is a female, and the dragon is greatly flattered by Donkey's compliments. She takes him to her lair to be intimate with him. However, Shrek rescues Donkey before things become too personal, and the two narrowly escape with the Princess. One night, during camp, Donkey asks Shrek why he hates everyone so much, and Shrek angrily reveals that everyone judges him a scary monster before getting to actually know him. Donkey acknowledges that he already knew that there was more to Shrek's character when they met. Donkey begins to notice a romance between Fiona and Shrek, despite their denials. The next night, Donkey goes inside a windmill to talk to the Princess, only to discover that she becomes an ogre herself after sunset. Shrek overhears them talking, and misinterprets the conversation as Fiona insulting him. The next day, Shrek berates her for what she said and Lord Farquaad comes to take her. Donkey tries to clear things up with Shrek, but Shrek berates Donkey as well, and even insults him. Hurt and angered, Donkey claims his half of the swamp for his hard work helping him. The two get into a heated fallout, whereupon Donkey finally explains that Fiona did not say that Shrek was ugly. Hearing this, the two make up and become friends. Donkey then has the dragon, whom he reconnected with earlier, take him and Shrek to Fiona's wedding to clear things up with each other. After Shrek saves Fiona from marrying Lord Farquaad and Dragon swallows Farquaad, Donkey sings \\"I'm a Believer\\" at Shrek and Fiona's wedding reception and takes his love, Dragon, as his wife. On Shrek in the Swamp Karaoke Dance Party!, he sings \\"Baby Got Back\\" by Sir Mixalot. =Shrek 2 (2004)= Donkey first appears in the film, having been remaining at Shrek's house while Shrek and Fiona were away on their honeymoon. When they return, Shrek tells Donkey to leave, but Donkey is hesitant. Fiona suggests that he should return for Dragon's sake, but then reveals that he is having troubles in his relationship with Dragon as she was acting strangely, but he could not determine the cause, so he decides to move back in with them. However, Shrek makes him leave. As Shrek and Fiona begin to have a moment, Donkey abruptly returns and interrupts, claiming that a chariot of royal men have arrived. A messenger appears and tells the newlywed couple that Fiona's parents have invited them to a royal ball to celebrate their marriage, as well as her father to give his royal blessing. Shrek is completely hesitant to accept, as he knows that her parents will never accept them as Ogres, though he eventually gives up and goes, accompanied by Donkey to the Far Far Away kingdom but keeps on asking every second \\"Are we there yet?\\" Shrek and Fiona keep answering no. He then meets Puss in Boots and becomes jealous as he is spending a lot of time with Shrek. By the end of the film they are great friends. At one point in the film, he reveals that he was the donkey traded by Jack for the magic beans, which greatly offended him. He and Shrek ended up drinking the \\"Happily Ever After\\" potion from the Fairy Godmother's workshop and while Shrek transformed into a human, Donkey became a magnificently bred and handsome white stallion (albeit with the same buck teeth and voice, and on the bottle it says that it is not for those with nervous disorders. After which Shrek and everyone else stares at Donkey as it is strongly hinted that he has one, but Donkey remains clueless as to the reason of why everyone is staring at him.) Donkey rides Shrek and Puss back to the castle. When Shrek goes inside, Fiona (who had also changed back to human form) comes running out to find Shrek. Donkey then explains why they changed, and that Shrek went inside looking for her. However, Shrek comes back outside heartbroken after Fiona went back in, as Charming and Fairy Godmother beat them both to it: Charming tricking Fiona into thinking he is Shrek, and Fairy Godmother convincing Shrek that Fiona is better off with Charming. Shrek, Donkey and Puss lament in a bar called \\"The Poison Apple,\\" only to discover Fiona's father Harold secretly talking to Fairy Godmother, revealing the scam. Unfortunately, they are both caught when Donkey's talking habits causes him to accidentally blurt out, completely exposing them. They are eventually caught and captured by Godmother's men, and are arrested. However, the other fairy tale creatures witness this, and break them out, and Gingerbread Man has The Muffin Man create a giant, Godzilla- sized Gingerbread man called \\"Mongo,\\" which Donkey helps lead to the castle. They succeed with getting in, but Mongo is defeated by the castle's guards. After the trio finished their mission with victory, both return to their normal forms, though Donkey seemed to be quite disappointed at returning to his original form although Shrek told Donkey he still sees Donkey as a noble steed, he later sings \\"Livin' La Vida Loca\\" along with Puss during the party. After the credits, Donkey and Dragon are reunited and he meets their newborn children, flying flame breathing miniature Donkeys, although he ends up exclaiming: \\"I gotta get a job!\\". He later sings \\"Disco Inferno\\" on Far Far Away Idol. =Shrek the Third (2007)= Donkey is enjoying fatherhood in Shrek the Third, and he is still first and foremost Shrek's sidekick and closest friend. When Far Far Away is in need of a new king, Donkey ventures off with Shrek in search of Fiona's cousin Arthur Pendragon, known simply as Artie at the Worcestershire boarding school where he resides. In their magical transport back to Far Far Away (aided by a slightly off-kilter Merlin), Donkey and Puss accidentally switch bodies. Puss finds Donkey's quadrupedal form hideous, while Donkey can't figure out how Puss can walk with such fancy accoutrements. They are forced to put their differences aside in order to save Far Far Away from a vindictive Prince Charming. After Charming is defeated, Merlin comes to change them back, but switches their tails (in the next scene, their tails have been corrected as well). He later is seen playing with Shrek's newborn ogre triplets. Donkey is last seen in the credits performing \\"Thank You (Falettinme Be Mice Elf Agin)\\", along with Puss, to the ogre triplets. =Shrek Forever After (2010)= In the fourth film, Donkey brings his \\"Dronkey\\" children over to Shrek's swamp often, much to Shrek's annoyance at the ensuing daily chaos. He takes part in innocently ruining Shrek's babies' birthday party. In Rumplestiltskin's alternate universe, Donkey first meets Shrek when he pulled a wagon the ogre was imprisoned in, forced to sing (reminiscent of a car stereo) by the witches, who whip him to change songs. After being taken to Rumplestiltskin, Shrek escapes and takes Donkey with him, much to the latter's chagrin. At first, Donkey fears Shrek and runs away, but returns after seeing Shrek crying over his babies' toy. Having never seen an ogre cry before, Donkey decides to trust Shrek and befriends him. Donkey also proves to be highly intelligent, and helps Shrek find a loophole in Rumplestiltskin's contract, comparing Shrek's situation to The Twilight Zone. The duo meet Fiona, Puss, and the rebellion of ogres in the woods, and Donkey befriends Puss in Boots and the ogres as well. Donkey later saves Shrek and Fiona from the Pied Piper (at Puss' urging), and then leads the assault on Rumplestiltskin's castle. He also attempts to seduce the Dragon, having learned from Shrek that she is his wife in the other reality, to stop her from eating Shrek and Fiona but he fails to do so, luckily, none of them are harmed. After Rumplestiltskin is defeated, Donkey sadly watches as Shrek begins to turn into pixie dust when his time is up. In the ending, with reality restored, Donkey celebrates Shrek's children's birthday. Later on, he is seen with Dragon, who playfully gobbles him up, and then he, along with the other characters, is last seen making a mud angel. Other appearances Donkey was also seen in the 2007 Christmas special Shrek The Halls, where he is trying to help Shrek get his Christmas Spirit. Donkey was voiced by original voice actor Eddie Murphy. He also appeared in the 2010 Halloween special Scared Shrekless, where Shrek challenges his friends to spend the night in Lord Farquaad's castle while telling scary stories. He is voiced by Dean Edwards, marking the first time that main cast member Eddie Murphy did not reprise his role. Another appearance Donkey made was in a short, which was released along with Shrek Forever After. Donkey also appears in Shrek the Musical. The role was originated on Broadway by Tony Award nominee Daniel Breaker. Alan Mingo, Jr. plays the role on the United States national tour, and Richard Blackwood plays the role in the West End production. Donkey also made an appearance in an episode of Father of the Pride, again voiced by Eddie Murphy. Two Donkeys appeared: One Donkey's stunt double and the other being the actual Donkey. In this episode, Donkey is portrayed as arrogant and self- centered actor, who plays his Shrek counterpart in the film series. He mistakenly claims that Shrek the Third is coming out in 2006. Donkey is the focus of the Donkey Live! attraction at the Universal Studios Singapore theme park. The show is a digital puppetry presentation in which Donkey, along with a live actor, interacts with the audience in the format of a stand-up comedy performance. Donkey also appears in many YouTube DreamWorks originals videos, voiced by Jason Lewis. The lead character of Rucio from the animated film Donkey Xote intentionally bears a resemblance to the character of Donkey. Creation Perry, a miniature donkey in Palo Alto, California, was used as the model for Donkey. Reception Empire listed Donkey as No. 21 on their \\"50 Best Animated Movie Characters\\".

Inflatable flying pigs were one of the staple props of Pink Floyd's live shows. The first balloon was a sow, with a male pig balloon later introduced in their 1987 tour. Pigs appeared numerous times in concerts by the band, promoting concerts and record releases, and on the cover of their 1977 album Animals. The image rights for the pigs passed to Roger Waters when he split from the rest of the group, though the pigs continued to be used by both post-Roger Waters Pink Floyd and Roger Waters in their gigs. Animals Algie replica flying over the Battersea Power Station on 26 September 2011 The original Pink Floyd pig was designed by Roger Waters and built in December 1976 by the artist Jeffrey Shaw with help of design team Hipgnosis, in preparation for shooting the cover of the Animals album. Plans were made to fly the , helium-filled balloon over Battersea Power Station on the first day's photo-shoot, with a marksman prepared to shoot the pig down if it broke free. However, the pig was not launched. On the second day, the marksman was not present because no one had told him to return. The pig broke free due to a strong gust of wind on the third day, gaining a lot of press coverage. It disappeared from sight within five minutes, and was spotted by airline pilots at thirty thousand feet in the air. Flights at Heathrow Airport were cancelled as the huge inflatable pig flew through the path of aircraft, eastwards from Britain and out over the English Channel, finally landing on a rural farm in Kent that night. The pig was recovered and repaired for the resumption of photography for the album cover, but the sky was cloudless and blue, thus \\"boring\\". However, the pictures of the sky from the first day were suitable; eventually, the album cover was created using a composite of photos from the first and third days. The pig that was originally floated above Battersea Power Station was called \\"Algie\\". In the Flesh After the album Animals was released in 1977, Pink Floyd began their \\"In the Flesh\\" tour. During concerts, the pig appeared around the PA stacks in a cloud of black smoke during performances of \\"Pigs (Three Different Ones)\\". The Wall Backdrop from a Pink Floyd tour The pig also appeared during each of Pink Floyd's The Wall concerts, black instead of pink, with a crossed hammers logo on its side. Waters would occasionally refer to it directly before \\"Run Like Hell\\" (the pig appeared during the end of the previous song, \\"In the Flesh\\"). A short speech in reference to either the pig or the song was given in every show, with each speech being different; this oddity has been used by bootleggers to identify which date a recording of the Wall tour was made. At the Berlin concert, it was only the head and it had fangs and red eyes. Pink Floyd's use of the pig post-Roger Waters Docklands Arena, July 1989 For the 1987‚Äì1989 tour, the band added testicles to the pig, which David Gilmour has said was an attempt to get around Roger Waters having the image rights for the pig. The pig briefly appeared on 10 June 1988 at Beaujoire stadium in Nantes, France; it flew above the crowd for a very short time, after which it was seen to deflate. The pig is shown to be flown over the audience during the performance of One of These Days in the Delicate Sound of Thunder concert video, where it appears black with illuminated eyes. Pink Floyd added a 'deflated' pig to Roger Waters' auction of animation art from the film The Wall at Christie's London, on 21 September 1990, but the lot was withdrawn before the auction started. During the 1994 tour, two warthog-like pigs with protruding tongues were shown at the top of the stage side's speaker towers, sometimes just deflated, sometimes dropped on the ground after \\"One of These Days\\". This was also during Pulse, but for the VHS, Laserdisc and DVD releases, footage of the pigs falling was edited out. The pig made another appearance before the release of Echoes: The Best of Pink Floyd, when Capitol Records flew a replica of the original pig from Animals over the Capitol Records Tower in Hollywood, California. One damaged inflatable pig, believed to be from the 1988 Pink Floyd tour, was repaired by Nga Keith and flown again over a concert by the band The String Cheese Incident in Austin, Texas on 20 September 2003. Reportedly purchased by The String Cheese Incident manager Mike Luba from a former Pink Floyd stagehand, the 40-foot pig flew again over the Austin City Limits Music Festival audience during a cover of Pink Floyd's \\"Another Brick in the Wall (Part II)\\". During their Live 8 reunion with Waters, footage of Algie, over Battersea Power Station, was shown on a giant video screen behind the band. A replica of Algie was tethered above Battersea Power Station on 26 September 2011 to promote the Why Pink Floyd...? campaign, involving the reissue of the band's first 14 studio albums.

Entering service in 1906, Milwaukee was deployed to the Pacific Ocean. On 13 January 1917, while aiding a grounded submarine, the cruiser grounded herself. The ship was decommissioned and sold for scrap in 1919. Service history Milwaukee was laid down on 30 July 1902 by Union Iron Works, San Francisco, California and launched on 10 September 1904, sponsored by Miss Janet Mitchell, daughter of U.S. Senator John L.

After a shakedown cruise off the coast of California and Mexico, from 14 March through 28 May 1907, Milwaukee departed San Francisco, California on 26 June 1907 and cruised off the coast of San Salvador and Costa Rica and engaging in target practice with the squadron in Magdalena Bay. On 26 March 1908, the cruiser sailed from San Francisco for Bremerton, Washington, where she was placed in reserve on 25 April. Except for a cruise in the summer of 1908 which took her to Hawaii and to Honduras, the ship remained in reserve status at Puget Sound Navy Yard until decommissioned on 3 May 1910. Milwaukee was recommissioned in ordinary service on 17 June 1913 and was assigned to the Pacific Reserve Fleet. In the next two years the ship made several brief cruises, one to Honolulu with a detachment of Washington State Naval Militia from 1‚Äì22 July 1914, and several along the coast of California. On 18 March 1916, Milwaukee was detached from the Reserve Fleet and assigned to duty as a tender to destroyers and submarines of the Pacific Fleet. Based at San Diego, the cruiser participated in exercises and maneuvers off the coast, patrolled Mexican waters, transported refugees, and performed survey duty. Milwaukee was then overhauled at Mare Island including the installation of heavy machine tools so the cruiser could act as a tender for the Coast Torpedo Force of destroyers and submarines. =The wreck of Milwaukee= Milwaukee beached at Eureka, California, in January 1917 after attempting to free the submarine . Under the temporary command of Lieutenant William F. Newton acting as Coast Torpedo Force Commander, Milwaukee sailed on 5 January 1917 for Eureka, California, to assist in salvaging the U.S. Navy submarine which had run aground off Humboldt Bay on 14 December 1916. On 13 January, while attempting to float the submarine and disregarding the recommendations of local mariners, the cruiser stranded in the first line of breakers at Samoa, California, off Eureka. Four hundred twenty-one enlisted and 17 officers were rescued safely by the Humboldt Bay Life-Saving Station and local volunteers but attempts to salvage the ship were unsuccessful. H-3 was ultimately salvaged and returned to service. =Decommissioning and fate= Milwaukee was decommissioned on 6 March 1917 and a storm in November 1918 broke the ship in two. Her name was struck from the Naval Vessel Register 23 June 1919 and her hulk was sold on 5 August 1919.

The band was formed around the year 1986 by Cucho and Nito, who invited Gast√≥n to join them. Their first hit was Veni Raquel, which set the tone for the irreverence and ironic humor of their later lyrics. Many of their songs are classic anthems of the Argentine nightlife, such as Coraz√≥n, Loco (Tu Forma de Ser), Entreg√° el Marr√≥n, La Guitarra and El Murguero. For some of their hit songs and videos, the Decandentes have engaged many Argentine icons such as former soccer referee Guillermo Nimo and the later candombe singer Alberto Castillo. As they draw from traditions such as canzonetta, murga bands and cantina songs, they are popular with many generations.

Meine was placed at No. 22 on Hit Parader's Top Heavy Metal Vocalists of All Time list in 2006. Biography Meine is noted for his unique tenor voice and polished delivery which ranges from high notes to soft ballads. Meine wrote most of the lyrics to Scorpions' songs.

The passenger train was carrying over 430 passengers to holy city of Varanasi, when at 3.30am it collided with the cement train which was on the same track. Local citizens rushed to help pull survivors from the wreckage, which did not catch fire. They were joined later in the day by soldiers armed with cutting equipment as well as police and medical personnel. Initial reports claimed that 24 people had been killed in the crash, but these were subsequently scaled down to 17 or 18, with at least 80 people seriously injured and requiring hospitalisation. The railway authority authorised a payment of 100,000 rupees to the families of the dead, and other provisions for those less injured. The cause of the crash was apparently the train's failure to stop at a signal warning the driver that there was an obstacle on the track ahead. The driver, Sita Ram, was killed in the crash, so his testimony will never be known, but the schools of thought on the cause of the crash are that either the driver did not see or did not pay attention to the signal, or that the signalman in Samlaya failed to produce the signal, or finally that the wiring from the box to the signal was faulty, thus mislaying the message. The manager of the rail line concerned, M. Z. Ansari provoked controversy, by declaring just a few hours after the crash that \\"Prima facie the accident appears to have been caused by human error on the part of the staff at B Cabin in Samlaya\\", which caused much anger amongst the local people aiding the rescue operations, particularly since Mr Ansari was not at the site, and could not have known the full details of what had caused the crash.

In the period between the end of the World War and 1949, when the Soviet Union detonated their first atomic weapon, little was given to the topic of civil defense. After the Soviets demonstration of their first atomic weapon there was a feeling of the need to do something throughout both the American public and government. This led to, among many actions, the creation of the Federal Civil Defense Administration by President Harry S. Truman in 1950.

Ellis @ 100. Early Life Ellis was born in Springfield, Illinois, on July 23, 1899. She was the youngest of four children in the family and the only daughter. Her parents were born in the last years of slavery in Tennessee. Ellis' mother, Carrie Farro Ellis, died when she was a teen, while her father, Charles Ellis Sr, was the first African American mail carrier in Illinois (originally born a slave). Ellis came out as a lesbian around 1915 (with help from a psychology textbook), but claims to never have had to come out as her family was rather accepting. She graduated from Springfield High School in 1919, at a time when fewer than seven percent of African Americans graduated from secondary school. In the 1920s, she met the only woman she ever lived with, Ceciline \\"Babe\\" Franklin. They moved together to Detroit, Michigan, in 1937. Career Ellis spent her days working for a printing company in Springfield but moved elsewhere for higher pay. Encouraged by this promise, of better wages, Ellis moved to Detroit in 1937. There she watched over a young boy in Highland Park for only $7.00 a week, today that is worth about $125.62. However, she soon put the knowledge she had of the printing press, which she had picked up in Springfield, to work and secure a position with Waterfield and Heath, where she worked until opening her own press out of the West Side home she shared with Babe. Personal life Her hobbies included dancing, bowling, painting, playing piano, and photography. Ellis and Franklin's house was also known in the African American community as the \\"gay spot\\". It was a central location for gay and lesbian parties, and also served as a refuge for African American gays and lesbians. She would continue to support those who needed books, food, or assistance with college tuition. Throughout her life, Ellis was an advocate of the rights of gays and lesbians, and of African Americans. Soon after her 70th birthday, due to her fame within the community, Ellis would become a staple at the \\"Michigan Womyn‚Äôs Music Festival\\". On her 100th birthday, she led and was sung happy birthday by the San Francisco‚Äôs Dyke March of 1999. Although Ellis and Franklin eventually separated, they were together for more than 30 years. Death Franklin died in 1973 from a heart attack on her way to work. Ellis was hospitalized for two weeks with heart problems but wanted to spend her last days at home. Ellis died in her sleep in the early morning hours of October 5, 2000. Her ashes were spread in the following Womyn's festival and into the Atlantic Ocean off of Ghana. Ruth Ellis Center The Ruth Ellis Center honors the life and work of Ruth Ellis and is one of only four agencies in the United States dedicated to homeless LGBT youth and young adults. Among their services are a drop-in center, street outreach program, licensed foster care home and an integrated Health and Wellness Center that provides medical and mental health care. Tributes and accomplishments  Her age did not slow her accomplishments, as her 100th birthday drew near, Ellis was being recognized in many major LGBT publications across the country, right as her documentary-like movie was coming out, \\"Living With Pride: Ruth Ellis @ 100.\\" The film won several top honors at different major film festivals. In 2009, she was inducted into the Michigan Hall of Fame. In 2013, she was inducted into the Legacy Walk, an outdoor public display which celebrates LGBT history and people.

A philosophical sin is a morally bad act which violates the natural order of reason, not the divine law. The idea of philosophical sin, as opposed to theological sin, was advocated by those who wished to construct a moral system independent of God. Those who believed in God and divine law yet contended for a distinction between philosophical and theological sin maintained that there are morally bad acts that, while violating the order of reason, are not offensive to God. They believed that the sinner can be ignorant of the existence of God and that, without the knowledge or consideration of God, it is impossible to offend him. This doctrine of philosophical sin was censured as scandalous, temerarious, and erroneous by Pope Alexander VIII in 1690 in his condemnation of the following proposition: The Catholic Church maintains the contrary view that sin can be offensive to God even if the sinner either does not know or does not consider God.

His 1950 book The Psychology of Dictatorship was an attempt to profile the Nazi German dictator Adolf Hitler using as reference the testimonials of Hitler's closest generals and commanders. Gilbert's published work is still a subject of study in many universities and colleges, especially in the field of psychology. Early life and education Gilbert was born in the state of New York in 1911, the son of Jewish-Austrian immigrants. He won a scholarship from the School for Ethical Culture at the College Town Center in New York. In 1939, Gilbert obtained his Doctor of Philosophy degree in psychology from Columbia University. Gilbert also held a diploma from the American Board of Examiners in professional psychology. During World War II, Gilbert was commissioned with the rank of First Lieutenant. Because of his knowledge of German, he was sent overseas as a translator. Nuremberg trials In 1945, after the end of the war, Gilbert was sent to Nuremberg, Germany, as a translator for the International Military Tribunal for the trials of the World War II German prisoners. Gilbert was appointed the prison psychologist of the German prisoners. During the process of the trials Gilbert became, after Douglas Kelley, the confidant of Hermann G√∂ring, Joachim von Ribbentrop, Wilhelm Keitel, Hans Frank, Oswald Pohl, Otto Ohlendorf, Rudolf H√∂ss, and Ernst Kaltenbrunner, among others. Gilbert and Kelley administered the Rorschach inkblot test to the 22 defendants in the Nazi leadership group prior to the first set of trials. Gilbert also participated in the Nuremberg trials as the American Military Chief Psychologist and provided testimony attesting to the sanity of Rudolf Hess. In 1946, after the trials, Gilbert returned to the US. Gilbert stayed busy teaching, researching, and writing. In 1947 he published part of his diary, consisting of observations taken during interviews, interrogations, \\"eavesdropping\\" and conversations with German prisoners, under the title Nuremberg Diary. (This diary was reprinted in full in 1961 just before the trial of Adolf Eichmann in Jerusalem.) The following is a famous exchange Gilbert had with G√∂ring from this book: Later life In 1948, as Head Psychologist at the Veterans Hospital at Lyons, NJ, Gilbert treated veterans of World Wars I and II who had suffered nervous breakdowns. In 1950, Gilbert published The Psychology of Dictatorship: Based on an Examination of the Leaders of Nazi Germany. In this book, Gilbert made an attempt to portray a profile of the psychological behavior of Adolf Hitler, based on deductive work from eyewitness reports from Hitler's commanders in prison in Nuremberg. In September 1954, while he was an Associate Professor of Psychology at Michigan State College, Gilbert attended the 62nd Annual Convention of the American Psychological Association in New York. Gilbert was part of a four-person panel discussing \\"Psychological Approaches to the Problem of Anti-Intellectualism.\\" In 1961, when he was the chairman of the psychology department of Long Island University in Brooklyn, Gilbert was summoned to testify in the trial of Adolf Eichmann in Jerusalem. Gilbert testified on May 29, 1961, describing how both Ernst Kaltenbrunner and Rudolf H√∂ss tried in their conversations with him to put the responsibility for the extermination of the Jews on each other's doorstep. Nevertheless, Eichmann appeared in the accounts of both men. Then he presented a document, handwritten by H√∂ss, that surveys the process of extermination at Auschwitz and different sums of people gassed there ‚Äì under H√∂ss as commandant and according to an oral report by Eichmann. The court decided not to accept Gilbert's psychological analyses of the prisoners at Nuremberg as part of his testimony. (Sessions 55, 56 and 57 contains the testimony of Gilbert) from the Nizkor Project In 1967, Gilbert convinced Leon Pomeroy, then a recent graduate from University of Texas at Austin, to build a clinical doctoral program in the field of psychology at Long Island University. At the time, Gilbert was serving as chairman of the psychology department of Long Island University in Brooklyn, New York. Gilbert died on 6 February 1977.

The Panic of 1837 occurred just before his election and the previous administration, which he had been part of, had taken on a large public debt. During his term the state entered a severe financial crisis that crippled the state's internal improvement projects. He advocated several measures to delay the inevitable insolvency of the state. Because of his connection to the internal improvement platform, his party refused to nominate him to run for a second term. The situation continued to deteriorate rapidly and led to state bankruptcy in his successor's term. After his term as governor, he became a congressman, then chairman of the Indiana Whig party before becoming a state judge, a position he held until his death. Early life =Family and background= David Wallace was born in Lewistown, Pennsylvania on April 24, 1799, the oldest of the seven children of Andrew and Eleanor Wallace. His father was a surveyor and tavern owner who became close friends with William Henry Harrison while the two served together in the War of 1812. The family benefited from Harrison's patronage. Wallace's brother, William H. Wallace, was appointed as the fourth governor of the Washington Territory and first governor of the Idaho Territory.Gugin, p. 80 His family moved to Ohio and settled near Cincinnati when he was a young boy. Wallace later attended Miami College before his family again moved to Brookville, Indiana in 1817. With the help of Harrison, Wallace secured entrance into the United States Military Academy. He graduated from West Point in 1821 and served as a lieutenant of artillery and taught mathematics at the school, but resigned his commission after about a year in the service. He later served as a captain and colonel in the 7th Regiment, Indiana Militia.Woollen, p. 70 When Wallace left the army he returned to his family in Brookville. There he began to study law in the office of Judge Miles C. Eggleston, and was admitted to the bar in 1823. He entered into a practice with Congressman John Test and married to his daughter, Esther French Test on November 10, 1824. They had four children together, one of whom was Lew Wallace, author of the novel Ben- Hur: A Tale of the Christ and Governor of New Mexico Territory. He is also the father of Edward Wallace, who fought in the Mexican-American war and the American Civil War. In 1836, after the death of his first wife, David married Zerelda Gray Sanders, a leader in the temperance movement, and together they had six children.Gugin, p. 81 Public office =Legislator= In 1828, Wallace was elected to the Indiana House of Representatives, where he served until 1831, when he was elected the sixth Lieutenant Governor on the Whig ticket with Noah Noble. As Lieutenant Governor he led the debate in the state senate to create the Bank of Indiana and gained a reputation as a skilled orator. Wallace was an outspoken advocate of the state's internal improvement projects, and painted a rosy picture of the state's situation during his campaign for governor. His family moved to Covington during his term. During his second term as Lieutenant Governor, the state passed the Mammoth Internal Improvement Act. Although it was at first extremely popular, it had soon become apparent to state leaders that it was leading the state to financial ruin. The problem was not fully evident when Wallace ran for governor in 1837, but was a small part of his election campaign. He was elected largely because of his prior support to the improvement act, which the public still supported, and his support from the popular governor Noah Noble.Gugin, p. 82 =Governor= Wallace's term as governor was marred by the Panic of 1837 and years of economic uncertainty which followed. Indiana had been enjoying a period of internal improvements of roads and canals, but nearly all such projects ended during this financial crisis. He was able to help arrange the state's finances to delay the inevitable bankruptcy of the state. The deficit only worsened, and by the end of his term, the state's income only covered 20% of its expenditures‚Äîinterest on the massive state debt being over two-thirds of the budget. The last year of his term, work on all the projects was halted. Wallace delivered an address to the General Assembly to inform them that the works were almost entirely worthless in their present condition and the state's credit had been exhausted. He informed the legislature that the state would be insolvent in the following year.Gugin, p. 83 The last of the Indian removals in Indiana occurred during Wallace's term, and only the few unwilling to leave voluntarily remained in the state. The Treaty of Chicago‚Äîsigned in 1833 with the Potawatomi‚Äîled to their removal. Wallace ordered General and U.S. Senator John Tipton to remove the band of 859 Potawatomi from the vicinity of Plymouth, Indiana and send them to the Kansas Territory. Forty-two Potawatomi, mostly children, died from disease and the stress of the two-month march in what became known as the \\"Trail of Death\\". During his term, Wallace set the date Indiana would observe Thanksgiving. On November 4, 1839, he issued an executive order making November 28 Thanksgiving Day. Wallace claimed to have done so at the request of representatives from different state churches.Dunn, 442 By the end of his term, the impending financial disaster was becoming apparent to the state's residents. Seeking to break away from failing projects, the Whigs moved against projects and nominated Samuel Bigger to run for governor, denying Wallace and his pro-internal improvement position a spot on the Whig ticket. Wallace then returned to his law practice.Woollen, p. 71 Later life After his term as governor, Wallace was elected in 1841 to the U.S. House of Representatives from the Indianapolis district, defeating Nathan B. Palmer. While in Congress he supported federal spending on the development of the telegraph, for which he was ridiculed by his opponents, but was later vindicated by the success of the technology.Woollen, p. 75 Wallace failed in his attempt for reelection in 1843, being defeated by William J. Brown who won by 1,085 votes. Wallace returned to Indiana where he became chairman of the state's Whig party in 1846. He served as a member of Indiana's constitutional convention in 1850-1851\\\\. His name is only mentioned nine times in the convention records and unlike the other former governors who attended, he did not play a major role in the convention. Wallace then became a judge of the Court of Common Pleas of Marion County from 1856 until his death. Wallace died suddenly, without having been ill, on September 4, 1859 in Indianapolis, Indiana and is buried in Crown Hill Cemetery.Gugin, p. 85 See also *List of Governors of Indiana References Notes Bibliography  External links * Biography from Indiana State Library * Profile from Directory of the United States Congress * 1799 births 1859 deaths Burials at Crown Hill Cemetery Governors of Indiana Members of the Indiana House of Representatives Members of the United States House of Representatives from Indiana People from Brookville, Indiana People from Warren County, Ohio People from Mifflin County, Pennsylvania United States Military Academy alumni Indiana Whigs Indiana state court judges Delegates to the 1851 Indiana constitutional convention Whig Party state governors of the United States Whig Party members of the United States House of Representatives 19th-century American politicians People from Covington, Indiana ","title":"David Wallace (Indiana politician)"},{"id":"1798186","text":"Rhythms NetConnections Inc.

Early life Becker was born in Leipzig, where he studied mathematics. His dissertation under Otto H√∂lder and Karl Rohn (1914) was On the Decomposition of Polygons in non-intersecting triangles on the Basis of the Axioms of Connection and Order. He served in World War I and returned to study philosophy with Edmund Husserl, writing his Habilitationsschrift on Investigations of the Phenomenological Foundations of Geometry and their Physical Applications, (1923). Becker was Husserl's assistant, informally, and then official editor of the Yearbook for Phenomenological Research. Work in phenomenology and mathematical philosophy Becker published his major work, Mathematical Existence in the Yearbook in 1927, the same year Martin Heidegger's Being and Time appeared there. Becker attended Heidegger's seminars at this period. Becker utilized not only Husserlian phenomenology but, much more controversially, Heideggerian hermeneutics, discussing arithmetical counting as \\"being toward death\\". His work was criticized both by neo-Kantians and by more mainstream, rationalist logicians, to whom Becker feistily replied. This work has not had great influence on later debates in the foundations of mathematics, despite its many interesting analyses of the topic of its title. Becker debated with David Hilbert and Paul Bernays over the role of the potential infinite in Hilbert's formalist metamathematics. Becker argued that Hilbert could not stick with finitism, but had to assume the potential infinite. Clearly enough, Hilbert and Bernays do implicitly accept the potential infinite, but they claim that each induction in their proofs is finite. Becker was correct that complete induction was needed for assertions of consistency in the form of universally quantified sentences, as opposed to claiming that a predicate holds for each individual natural number. =Paraontologie= In discussing Heidegger, Becker introduced the German neologism Paraontologie.Hans-Peter Hempel, Review of Dasein und Dawesen by Oskar Becker, Zeitschrift f√ºr philosophische Forschung, Bd. 21, H. 3 (Jul.‚ÄìSep., 1967), pp. 455-465, at p. 458. Published by: Vittorio Klostermann GmbH This usage is not connected with that made of \\"paraontology\\" in English more recently by Fred Moten, and others, in discussing blackness.The ALP Journals, pp. 59-93, at p. 84, in Them Goon Rules: Fugitive Essays on Radical Black Feminism (2019), Marquis Bey, Monica J. Casper, Tamura A. Lomax, Darnell L. Moore. Publisher: University of Arizona Press Intuitionistic and modal logic Becker made a start toward the formalization of L. E. J. Brouwer's intuitionistic logic. He developed a semantics of intuitionistic logic based on Husserl's phenomenology, and this semantics was used by Arend Heyting in his own formalization. Becker struggled, somewhat unsuccessfully, with the formulation of the rejection of excluded middle appropriate for intuitionistic logic. Becker failed in the end to correctly distinguish classical and intuitionistic negation, but he made a start. In an appendix to his book on mathematical existence, Becker set the problem of finding a formal calculus for intuitionistic logic. In a series of works in the early 1950s he surveyed modal, intuitionistic, probabilistic, and other philosophical logics. Becker made contributions to modal logic (the logic of necessity and possibility) and Becker‚Äôs postulate, the claim that modal status is necessary (for instance that the possibility of P implies the necessity of the possibility of P, and also the iteration of necessity) is named for him. Becker's Postulate later played a role in the formalization given, by Charles Hartshorne, the American process theologian, of the Ontological Proof of God's existence, stimulated by conversations with the logical positivist and opponent of the alleged proof, Rudolf Carnap. History of mathematics Becker also made important contributions to the history and interpretation of ancient Greek mathematics. Becker, as did several others, emphasized the \\"crisis\\" in Greek mathematics occasioned by the discovery of incommensurability of the side of the pentagon (or in the later, simpler proofs, the triangle) by Hippasus of Metapontum, and the threat of (literally) \\"irrational\\" numbers. To German theorists of the \\"crisis\\", the Pythagorean diagonal of the square was similar in its impact to Cantor's diagonalization method of generating higher order infinities, and G√∂del's diagonalization method in G√∂del's proof of incompleteness of formalized arithmetic. Becker, like several earlier historians, suggests that the avoidance of arithmetic statement of geometrical magnitude in Euclid is avoided for ratios and proportions, as a consequence of recoil from the shock of incommensurability. Becker also showed that all the theorems of Euclidean proportion theory could be proved using an earlier alternative to the Eudoxus technique which Becker found stated in Aristotle's Topics, and which Becker attributes to Theaetetus. Becker also showed how a constructive logic that denied unrestricted excluded middle could be used to reconstruct most of Euclid's proofs. More recent revisionist commentators such as Wilbur Knorr and David Fowler have accused historians of early Greek mathematics writing in the early twentieth century, such as Becker, of reading the crisis of their own times illegitimately into the early Greek period. (This ‚Äúcrisis‚Äù may include both the crisis of twentieth century set theory and foundations of mathematics, and the general crisis of World War I, the overthrow of the Kaiser, communist uprisings, and the Weimar Republic.) Later thought At the end of his life Becker re-emphasized the distinction between intuition of the formal and Platonic realm as opposed to the concrete existential realm, moved to the terminology, at least, of divination. In his Dasein und Dawesen Becker advocated what he called a \\"mantic\\" divination. Hermeneutics of the Heideggerian sort is applicable to individual lived existence, but \\"mantic\\" decipherment is necessary not only in mathematics, but in aesthetics, and the investigation of the unconscious. These realms deal with the eternal and structural, such as the symmetries of nature, and are properly investigated by a mantic phenomenology, not an hermeneutic one. (Becker's emphasis on the timelessness and formal nature of the unconscious has some parallels with the account of Jacques Lacan.) Contacts and correspondence Becker carried on an extensive correspondence with some of the greatest mathematicians and philosophers of the day. These included Ackermann, Adolf Fraenkel (later Abraham), Arend Heyting, David Hilbert, John von Neumann, Hermann Weyl, and Ernst Zermelo among mathematicians, as well as Hans Reichenbach and Felix Kaufmann among philosophers. The letters that Becker received from these major figures of twentieth century mathematics and leading logical positivist philosophers, as well as Becker‚Äôs own copies of his letters to them, were destroyed during World War II. Becker's correspondence with Weyl has been reconstructed (see bibliography), as Weyl's copies of Becker‚Äôs letters to him are preserved, and Becker often extensively quotes or paraphrases Weyl‚Äôs own letters. Perhaps the same can be done with some other parts of this valuable but lost correspondence. Weyl entered into correspondence with Becker with high hopes and expectations, given their mutual admiration for Husserl‚Äôs phenomenology and Husserl‚Äôs great admiration for the work of Becker. However, Weyl, whose sympathies were with constructivism and intuitionism, lost patience when he argued with Becker about a purported intuition of the infinite defended by Becker. Weyl concluded, sourly, that Becker would discredit phenomenological approaches to mathematics if he persisted in this position. Nazism and neglect It is possible that regard for Becker's earlier work suffered from his later Nazi allegiances, leading to lack of reference or published commentary by √©migr√© logicians and mathematicians who had fled Hitlerism. His lecture on \\"The Vacuity of Art and the Daring of the Artist,\\" presents a \\"Nordic Metaphysics\\" in fairly standard Nazi style. According to Oskar Becker, the \\"rhythm of Nietzsche's Dionysian-Dithyrambs was identical to the Will to power and physically in the sense of youth identical to the marching rhythm of the SA\\".Karl L√∂with: Mein Leben in Deutschland vor und nach 1933: Ein Bericht, Verlag J.B. Metzler, 2007, Oskar Becker was classified from an SS-point of view in the following way in the \\"SD-Dossiers √ºber Philosophie-Professoren\\" (i.e. SD-files concerning philosophy professors) that were set up by the SS Security Service (SD): \\"not a party member but loyal to National Socialism, tries to consolidate the National Socialistic ideology\\".Georg Leaman, Gerd Simon: Deutsche Philosophen aus der Sicht des Sicherheitsdienstes des Reichsf√ºhrers SS. Jahrbuch f√ºr Soziologie-Geschichte 1992. Original SD-file text: \\"kein Pg aber loyal zum NS, bem√ºht, die n-s. Weltanschauung zu vertiefen\\". Two able philosophers who were students of Becker, J√ºrgen Habermas and Hans Sluga, later grappled with the issue of the influence of Nazism on German academia. The application of Heidegger's ideas to theoretical science (let alone mathematics) has only recently become widespread, particularly in the English-speaking world. Furthermore, Becker's polemical replies probably alienated his critics still further. He died, aged 75, in Bonn.

It combines elements from the action film genre, as codified by Hollywood, with Chinese storytelling, aesthetic traditions, action choreography and filmmaking techniques, to create a culturally distinctive form that nevertheless has a wide transcultural appeal. In recent decades, American and European action films have been heavily influenced by Hong Kong genre conventions. The first Hong Kong action films favoured the wuxia style, emphasizing mysticism and swordplay, but this trend was politically suppressed in the 1930s and replaced by kung fu films that depicted more down-to-earth unarmed martial arts, often featuring folk hero Wong Fei Hung. Post-war cultural upheavals led to a second wave of wuxia films with highly acrobatic violence, followed by the emergence of the grittier kung fu films for which the Shaw Brothers studio became best known. Hong Kong action cinema peaked from the 1970s to the 1990s. The 1970s saw a resurgence in kung fu films during the rise and sudden death of Bruce Lee. He was succeeded in the 1980s by Jackie Chan‚Äîwho popularized the use of comedy, dangerous stunts, and modern urban settings in action films‚Äîand Jet Li, whose authentic wushu skills appealed to both eastern and western audiences. The innovative work of directors and producers like Tsui Hark and John Woo introduced further variety, with genres such as heroic bloodshed and gun fu films, and themes such as triads and the supernatural. However, an exodus by many leading figures to Hollywood in the 1990s coincided with a downturn in the industry.  Early martial arts films  The Swordswoman of Huangjiang (1930) co- starring Chen Zhi-gong.The signature contribution to action cinema from the Chinese-speaking world is the martial arts film, the most famous of which were developed in Hong Kong. The genre emerged first in Chinese popular literature. The early 20th century saw an explosion of what were called wuxia novels (often translated as \\"martial chivalry\\"), generally published in serialized form in newspapers. These were tales of heroic, sword-wielding warriors, often featuring mystical or fantasy elements. This genre was quickly seized on by early Chinese films, particularly in the movie capital of the time, Shanghai. Starting in the 1920s, wuxia titles, often adapted from novels (for example, 1928's The Burning of the Red Lotus Monastery and its eighteen sequels) were hugely popular and the genre dominated Chinese film for several years.(Chute & Lim, 2003, 14‚Äì15) The boom came to an end in the 1930s, caused by official opposition from cultural and political elites, especially the Kuomintang government, who saw it as promoting superstition and violent anarchy. Wuxia filmmaking was picked up in Hong Kong, at the time a British colony with a highly liberal economy and culture and a developing film industry. The first martial arts film in Cantonese, the dominant Chinese spoken language of Hong Kong, was The Adorned Pavilion (1938).  Postwar martial arts cinema  Scene from the wuxia film Buddha's Palm (1964). The magic qi rays are created using crude hand-drawn animation. By the late 1940s, upheavals in mainland China‚Äîthe Second Sino-Japanese War, the Chinese Civil War, and the victory of the Communist Party of China‚Äîhad shifted the centre of Chinese language filmmaking to Hong Kong. The industry continued the wuxia tradition in Cantonese B movies and serials, although the more prestigious Mandarin-language cinema generally ignored the genre. Animation and special effects drawn directly on the film by hand were used to simulate the flying abilities and other preternatural powers of characters; later titles in the cycle included The Six-Fingered Lord of the Lute (1965) and Sacred Fire, Heroic Wind (1966).(Chute & Lim, 2003, 2) A counter-tradition to the wuxia films emerged in the kung fu movies that were also produced at this time. These movies emphasized more \\"authentic\\", down-to- earth and unarmed combat over the swordplay and mysticism of wuxia. The most famous exemplar was real-life martial artist Kwan Tak Hing; he became an avuncular hero figure to at least a couple of generations of Hong Kongers by playing historical folk hero Wong Fei Hung in a series of roughly one hundred movies, from The True Story of Wong Fei Hung (1949) through to Wong Fei Hung Bravely Crushing the Fire Formation (1970). A number of enduring elements were introduced or solidified by these films: the still-popular character of \\"Master Wong\\"; the influence of Chinese opera with its stylized martial arts and acrobatics; and the concept of martial arts heroes as exponents of Confucian ethics.\\"Chinese Martial Arts: Philosophical influences\\"Chinese martial arts  \\"New School\\" wuxia  In the second half of the 1960s, the era's biggest studio, Shaw Brothers, inaugurated a new generation of wuxia films, starting with Xu Zenghong's Temple of the Red Lotus (1965), a remake of the 1928 classic. These Mandarin productions were more lavish and in colour; their style was less fantastical and more intense, with stronger and more acrobatic violence. They were influenced by imported samurai movies from Japan and by the wave of \\"New School\\" wuxia novels by authors like Jin Yong and Liang Yusheng that started in the 1950s.(Chute and Lim, 2003, 8 & 15) The New School wuxia wave marked the move of male-oriented action films to the centre of Hong Kong cinema, which had long been dominated by female stars and genres aimed at female audiences, such as romances and musicals. Even so, during the 1960s female action stars like Cheng Pei-pei and Connie Chan Po-chu were prominent alongside male stars, such as former swimming champion Jimmy Wang Yu, and they continued an old tradition of female warriors in wuxia storyte directors of the period were Chang Cheh with One-Armed Swordsman (1967) and Golden Swallow (1968) and King Hu with Come Drink with Me (1966). Hu soon left Shaw Brothers to pursue his own vision of wuxia with independent productions in Taiwan, such as the enormously successful Dragon Inn (1967, aka Dragon Gate Inn) and A Touch of Zen which was nominated for the Palme d'Or at the 1975 Cannes Film Festival. Chang stayed on and remained the Shaws' prolific star director into the early 1980s.  The 1970s kung fu wave  The early 1970s saw wuxia giving way to a new, grittier and more graphic (and Mandarin- speaking) iteration of the kung fu movie, which came to dominate through the decade and into the early 1980s. Seriously trained martial artists such as Ti Lung and Gordon Liu became some of the top stars as increasing proportions of running times were devoted to combat set-pieces. Chinese Boxer (1970), starring and directed by Jimmy Wang Yu, is widely credited with launching the kung fu boom. But remaining at the vanguard, at least initially, were Shaw Brothers and director Chang Cheh. Chang's Vengeance (1970) was another of the first trendsetters and his dozens of contributions included The Boxer from Shantung (1972), Heroes Two (1974), Five Deadly Venoms (1978) and Crippled Avengers (1979). Kung fu cinema was particularly influenced by Chang's concern with his vision of masculine values and male friendship;(Teo, 2003) the female warrior figures who had been prominent in late 1960s wuxia work were sidelined, with prominent exceptions such as the popular Angela Mao. Chang's only competitor as the genre's most influential filmmaker was his long-time action choreographer, Lau Kar Leung (aka Liu Chia Liang in Mandarin). Lau began directing his own movies for the Shaw brothers in 1975 with The Spiritual Boxer, a progenitor of the kung fu comedy. In subsequent titles like Executioners from Shaolin (1977), The 36th Chamber of Shaolin (1978), and Legendary Weapons of China (1982), Lau emphasized the traditions and philosophy of the martial arts and strove to give onscreen fighting greater authenticity and ever greater speed and intricacy. The kung fu boom was partly fueled by enormous international popularity, and not just in East Asia. In the West, kung fu imports, dubbed and often recut and retitled, shown as \\"B\\" films in urban theaters and on television, made Hong Kong film widely noticed, although not widely respected, for the first time. African-Americans particularly embraced the genre (as exemplified by the popular hip-hop group, the Wu-Tang Clan) perhaps as an almost unprecedented source of adventure stories with non-white heroes, who furthermore often displayed a strong streak of racial and/or nationalistic pride.African Americans, Kung Fu Theater and Cultural Exchange at the Margins by Amy Abugo Ongiri in the Journal of Asian American Studies. Project Muse PDF version . Retrieved 1 April 2006. The popularity of these movies in North America would continue into the 1980s when ninja movies were introduced. In popular culture, the films of this era were colloquially known as Kung Fu Theater or Black Belt Theater, names that many independent stations used for their weekly airing slot. The Brothers (1979), a Shaw Brothers production, was a significant departure from the kung fu films the studio was known for. The Brothers was an action crime-drama, about two brothers on opposing sides of the law. It was a remake of the Indian crime drama Deewaar (1975), written by Salim‚ÄìJaved. In turn, The Brothers laid the foundations for the heroic bloodshed genre of 1980s Hong Kong cinema, inspiring John Woo's breakthrough film A Better Tomorrow (1986). = Bruce Lee = No single figure was more responsible for this international profile than Bruce Lee, an American-born, Hong Kong-raised martial artist and actor. Lee completed just four movies before his death at the age of 32: The Big Boss (1971), Fist of Fury and Way of the Dragon (both 1972), and Enter the Dragon (1973). Eastern film historian Patrick Macias ascribes his success to \\"(bringing) the warrior spirit of old into the present day... developing his own fighting style... and possessing superhuman charisma\\". His first three movies broke local box office records and were successful in much of the world. Fist of Fury and Way of the Dragon went on to gross an estimated and worldwide, respectively. The English-language Enter the Dragon, the first-ever US-Hong Kong co-production, grossed an estimated worldwide, making it the most internationally successful film from the region. Furthermore, his decision at the outset to work for young, upstart studio Golden Harvest, rather than accept the Shaws' notoriously tightfisted standard contract, was a factor in Golden Harvest's meteoric rise and Shaw's eventual decline. Following Lee's untimely death, a cottage industry of faux Lee movies emerged, featuring either performers who adopted similar screen names (Bruce Li, Bruce Lai, etc.), or outtake footage of Lee, or some combination of both. The fad did little to engender mainstream respect in the West for the relatively new phenomenon of martial arts cinema. But despite such posthumous treatment, Lee continues to cast a long shadow over Hong Kong film. = Jackie Chan and the kung fu comedy = The only Chinese performer who has ever rivalled Bruce Lee's global fame is Jackie Chan. Like many kung fu performers of the day, Chan came out of training in Peking opera and started in film as a stuntman, notably in some of Lee's vehicles. He was groomed for a while by The Big Boss and Fist of Fury director Lo Wei as another Lee clone, in several movies including New Fist of Fury (1976), with little success. But in 1978, Chan teamed up with action choreographer Yuen Woo Ping on Yuen's directorial debut, Snake in the Eagle's Shadow. The resulting blend of physical comedy and kung fu action provided Chan with his first hit and the rudiments of what would become his signature style. Chan's follow-up movie with Yuen, Drunken Master (also 1978), and his directorial debut, The Fearless Hyena (1979), were also giant hits and cemented his popularity. Sammo Hung as a wise master in Tsui Hark's Zu Warriors from the Magic Mountain from 1983. The white eyebrows speak of extraordinary power on the part of the character. Although these films were not the first kung fu comedies, they launched a vogue that helped reinvigorate the waning kung fu genre. Especially notable in this regard were two of Chan's childhood Peking Opera School classmates, Sammo Hung and Yuen Biao, who also made careers of this specialty, sometimes co-starring with Chan. Hung, noted for the seeming paradox of his overweight physique and physical agility, also made a name for himself as a director and action choreographer from early on, with titles like Enter the Fat Dragon (1978).  Reinventing action cinema  Chan's clowning may have helped extend the life of the kung fu wave for several years. Nevertheless, he became a star towards the end of the boom, and would soon help move the colony towards a new type of action. In the 1980s, he and many colleagues would forge a slicker, more spectacular Hong Kong pop cinema that would successfully compete with the post-Star Wars summer blockbusters from America. = Jackie Chan and the martial arts stunt action film = In 1982, Jackie Chan began experimenting with elaborate stunt action sequences in Dragon Lord, which featured a pyramid fight scene that holds the record for the most takes required for a single scene, with 2900 takes, and the final fight scene where he performs various stunts, including one where he does a back flip off a loft and falls to the lower ground. By 1983, Chan branched out into action films which, though they still used martial arts, were less limited in scope, setting and plot, with an emphasis on elaborate yet dangerous stunt sequences. His first film in this vein, Project A (1983), saw the official formation of the Jackie Chan Stunt Team and added elaborate, dangerous stunts to the fights and typical slapstick humor (at one point, Chan falls from the top of a clock tower through a series of fabric canopies). The new formula helped Project A gross over in Hong Kong,Internet Movie Database Business Data . Retrieved 1 April 2006. and significantly more in other Asian countries such as Japan, where it grossed and became one of the highest- grossing films of 1984. Winners and Sinners (1983) also featured an elaborate action sequence that involves Chan skating along a busy high road, including a risky stunt where he slides under a truck. Chan continued to take the approach ‚Äì and the budgets ‚Äì to new heights in hits like Police Story (1985), which is considered one of the greatest action films of all time. Here was Chan dangling from a speeding bus, destroying large parts of a hillside shantytown, fighting in a shopping mall while breaking many glass panes, and sliding down a pole covered with exploding light bulbs. The latter is considered one of the greatest stunts in the history of action cinema. The 1988 sequel called for explosions on a scale similar to many Hollywood movies and seriously injured leading lady Maggie Cheung ‚Äì an occupational risk Chan had already grown used to. Thus Jackie Chan created the template for the contemporary urban action- comedy of the 1980s, combining cops, kung fu and all the body-breaking potential of the modern city with its glass, metal and speeding vehicles.Bright Lights Film Journal, An Evening with Jackie Chan by Dr. Craig Reid, issue 13, 1994 . Retrieved 1 April 2006. = Tsui Hark and Cinema City = Chan's move towards larger-scale action films was paralleled by work coming out of Cinema City, the production company established in 1980 by comedians Raymond Wong, Karl Maka and Dean Shek. With movies like the spy spoof Aces Go Places (1982) and its sequels, Cinema City helped make modern special effects, James Bond-type gadgets and big vehicular stunts part of the industry vernacular.(Bordwell 2000) Director/producer Tsui Hark had a hand in shaping the Cinema City style while employed there from 1981‚Äì1983(Teo, 1997) but went on to make an even bigger impact after leaving. In such movies as Zu Warriors from the Magic Mountain (1983) and A Chinese Ghost Story (1987, directed by Ching Siu-tung), he kept pushing back the boundaries of Hong Kong special effects. He led the way in replacing the rough and ready camera style of 1970s kung fu with glossier and more sophisticated visuals and ever more furious editing. = John Woo and the \\"heroic bloodshed\\" triad films = As a producer, Tsui Hark facilitated the creation of John Woo's epoch-making heroic bloodshed movie A Better Tomorrow (1986). Woo's saga of cops and the triads (Chinese gangsters) combined fancifully choreographed (and extremely violent) gunplay with heightened emotional melodrama, sometimes resembling a modern- dress version of 1970s kung fu films by Woo's mentor Chang Cheh. The formula broke another all-time box office record. It also jump-started the faltering career of co-star Chow Yun-fat, who overnight became one of the colony's most popular idols and Woo's favorite leading man.(Logan, 1995) For the remainder of the 1980s and into the early 1990s, a deluge of films by Woo and others explored similar territory, often with a similar visual style and thematic bent. They were usually marked by an emphasis on the fraternal bonds of duty and affection among the criminal protagonists. The most notable other auteur of these themes was Ringo Lam, who offered a less romanticized take in such films as City on Fire, Prison on Fire (both 1987), and Full Contact (1992), all starring Chow Yun-Fat. The genre and its creators were accused in some quarters of cravenly glorifying real-life triads, whose involvement in the film business was notorious.(Dannen, Long, 1997) = The wire-work wave = As the triad films petered out in the early 1990s, period martial arts returned as the favored action genre. But this was a new martial arts cinema that took full advantage of technical strides as well the higher budgets that came with Hong Kong's dominance of the region's screens. These lavish productions were often adapted from the more fantastical wuxia novels, which featured flying warriors in mid-air combat. Performers were trussed up on ultrathin wires to allow them to conduct gravity-defying action sequences, a technique known by Western fans, sometimes disparagingly, as wire fu.GreenCine primer: Hong Kong Action by Patrick Macias . Retrieved 1 April 2006. As so often, Tsui Hark led the way. He produced Swordsman (1990), which reestablished the wuxia novels of Jin Yong as favorite big-screen sources (television adaptations had long been ubiquitous). He directed Once Upon a Time in China (1991), which resurrected oft-filmed folk hero Wong Fei Hung. Both films were followed by sequels and a raft of imitations, often starring Mainland wushu champion Jet Li. He went on to receive a special award for a mainland China person at the 1995 Taipei Golden Horse Film Festival. The other signature star of the subgenre was Taiwanese-born actress Brigitte Lin. She made an unlikely specialty of androgynous woman-warrior types, such as the villainous, sex-changing eunuch in The Swordsman 2 (1992), epitomizing martial arts fantasy's often-noted fascination with gender instability.Unsung Heroes: Reading Transgender Subjectivities in Hong Kong Action Cinema by Helen Hok-Sze Leung. Web version 2004‚Äì05 . Retrieved 1 April 2006.  International impact  = First wave: kung fu craze (1970s‚Äì1980s) = Hong Kong's international impact initially came in the form of martial arts films, especially 1970s kung fu films and most notably those of Bruce Lee. His earliest attempts at introducing his brand of Hong Kong martial arts cinema to the West came in the form of American television shows, such as The Green Hornet (1966 debut) and Kung Fu (1972 debut). The \\"kung fu craze\\" began in 1973, with the unprecedented success of Hong Kong martial arts films at the North American box office. King Boxer (Five Fingers of Death) starring Indonesian-born actor Lo Lieh was the first Hong Kong film to top the US box office, paving the way for Bruce Lee's breakthrough with The Big Boss (Fists of Fury) topping the US box office. In May 1973, Hong Kong action cinema made US box office history, with three foreign films holding the top three spots for the first time: Fists of Fury, Lady Whirlwind (Deep Thrust), and Five Fingers of Death. Lee continued his success with Fist of Fury (The Chinese Connection), which also topped the US box office the following month. Kung fu film releases in the United States initially targeted Asian American audiences, before becoming a breakout success among larger African-American and Hispanic audiences, and then among white working-class Americans. Kung fu films also became a global success, across Asia, Europe and the third world. This eventually paved the way for Lee's posthumous Hollywood film breakthrough with the Hong Kong and US co- production Enter the Dragon (1973). Hong Kong martial arts cinema subsequently inspired a wave of Western martial arts films and television shows throughout the 1970s‚Äì1990s (launching the careers of Western martial arts stars such as Jean-Claude Van Damme, Steven Seagal and Chuck Norris), as well as the more general integration of Asian martial arts into Western action films and television shows by the 1990s. Sascha Matuszak of Vice said Enter the Dragon \\"is referenced in all manner of media, the plot line and characters continue to influence storytellers today, and the impact was particularly felt in the revolutionizing way the film portrayed African-Americans, Asians and traditional martial arts.\\" Kuan-Hsing Chen and Beng Huat Chua cited fight scenes in Hong Kong films such as Enter the Dragon as being influential for the way they pitched \\"an elemental story of good against evil in such a spectacle-saturated way\\". In Japan, the manga and anime franchises Fist of the North Star (1983‚Äì1988) and Dragon Ball (1984‚Äì1995) were influenced by Hong Kong martial arts films, particularly 1970s kung fu films such as Bruce Lee's Enter the Dragon and Jackie Chan's Drunken Master (1978). In turn, Fist of the North Star and especially Dragon Ball are credited with setting the trends for popular sh≈çnen manga and anime from the 1980s onwards. Similarly in India, Hong Kong martial arts films had an influence on Bollywood masala films. After the success of Bruce Lee films (such as Enter the Dragon) in India, Deewaar (1975) and later Bollywood films incorporated fight scenes inspired by 1970s Hong Kong martial arts films up until the 1990s. Bollywood action scenes emulated Hong Kong rather than Hollywood, emphasising acrobatics and stunts and combining kung fu (as perceived by Indians) with Indian martial arts such as pehlwani. Hong Kong martial arts films such as Enter the Dragon were the foundation for fighting games. The Street Fighter video game franchise (1987 debut) was inspired by Enter the Dragon, with the gameplay centered around an international fighting tournament, and each character having a unique combination of ethnicity, nationality and fighting style. Street Fighter went on to set the template for all fighting games that followed. The early beat 'em up game Kung-Fu Master (1984) was also based on Bruce Lee's Game of Death (1972) and Jackie Chan's Wheels on Meals (1984). The success of Bruce Lee's films helped popularize the concept of mixed martial arts (MMA) in the West via his Jeet Kune Do system. In 2004, Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) founder Dana White called Lee the \\"father of mixed martial arts\\".Wickert, Marc. 2004. Dana White and the future of UFC. kucklepit.com. See Wikiquotes for the text. Parkour was also influenced by the acrobatic antics of Jackie Chan in his Hong Kong action films, as well as the philosophy of Bruce Lee. = Second wave: modern action films (1990s‚Äì2000s) = Hong Kong action cinema's innovative developments in the 1980s had not only established Hong Kong as the dominant cinema in East Asia, but reawakened Western interest. By the 1990s, there was a second \\"Asian invasion\\" from Hong Kong action cinema, heavily influencing and revitalizing Hollywood action cinema. There was a significant crossover of Hong Kong stars, filmmakers and action choreographers from Hong Kong to Hollywood, in addition to the wide adoption of Hong Kong action filmmaking techniques in Hollywood. The wide adoption of Hong Kong action film conventions was referred to as the \\"Hong Kongification\\" of Hollywood. Building on the reduced but enduring kung fu movie subculture, Jackie Chan and films like Tsui Hark's Peking Opera Blues (1986) were already building a cult following when Woo's The Killer (1989) had a limited but successful release in the U.S. and opened the floodgates. In the 1990s, Westerners with an eye on \\"alternative\\" culture became common sights in Chinatown video shops and theaters, and gradually the films became more available in the mainstream video market and even occasionally in mainstream theaters. Western critics and film scholars also began to take Hong Kong action cinema seriously and made many key figures and films part of their canon of world cinema. From here, Hong Kong came to define a new vocabulary for worldwide action cinema, with the aid of a new generation of North American filmmakers. Quentin Tarantino's Reservoir Dogs (1992) drew inspiration from City on Fire and his two-part Kill Bill (2003‚Äì04) was in large part a martial arts homage, borrowing Yuen Woo-Ping as fight choreographer and actor. Robert Rodriguez's Desperado (1995) and its 2003 sequel Once Upon a Time in Mexico aped Woo's visual mannerisms. The Wachowski brothers' The Matrix trilogy (1999‚Äì2003) of science-fiction-action blockbusters borrowed from Woo and wire fu movies, and also employed Yuen behind the scenes. A number of Hollywood action stars also adopted the Hong Kong practice of training in martial arts and performing their own stunts, such as Keanu Reeves, Uma Thurman and Jason Statham. Martin Scorsese's crime film The Departed (2006) was a remake of the Infernal Affairs trilogy (2002‚Äì2003) by Andrew Lau and Alan Mak.  Influence of heroic bloodshed films  The heroic bloodshed genre had a considerable impact on world cinema, especially Hollywood. The action, style, tropes and mannerisms established in 1980s Hong Kong heroic bloodshed films were later widely adopted by Hollywood in the 1990s, reshaping the way Hollywood action films were made. Lam's City on Fire (1987) inspired Quentin Tarantino's Reservoir Dogs (1992); Tarantino was an admirer of the heroic bloodshed genre. The Killer also heavily influenced Luc Besson's L√©on: The Professional (1994). Eventually, John Woo himself introduced his brand of heroic bloodshed to Hollywood in the 1990s. By the late 1990s, Woo's style of cinema had become firmly established in Hollywood.  Exit of many leading figures  Due to the new-found international awareness of Hong Kong films during the 1980s and early 1990s and a downturn in the industry as the 1990s progressed, many of the leading lights of Hong Kong cinema left for Hollywood, which offered budgets and pay which could not be equalled by Hong Kong production companies. John Woo left for Hollywood after his 1992 film Hard Boiled. His 1997 film Face/Off was the breakthrough that established his unique style in Hollywood. This effort was immensely popular with both critics and public alike (it grossed over US$240 million worldwide). Mission: Impossible 2 (2000) grossed over US$560 million worldwide. Since these two films, Woo has struggled to revisit his successes of the 1980s and early 1990s.Asia Week, The Next Mission by Winnie Chung, 30 June 2000, Vol. 29 no 5 . Retrieved 1 April 2006. After over fifteen years of success in Hong Kong cinema and a couple of attempts to crack the U.S. market, Jackie Chan's 1995 film Rumble in the Bronx finally brought him recognition in the U.S. Since then, he has made several highly successful films for U.S. studios including Rush Hour (1998), Shanghai Noon (2000), and their respective sequels. Between his films for U.S. studios, he still makes films for Hong Kong studios, sometimes in English (Mr. Nice Guy and Who Am I?), often set in western countries like Australia or the Netherlands, and sometimes in Cantonese (2004's New Police Story and 2006's Rob-B-Hood). Because of his enormous U.S. popularity, these films are usually released in the U.S., a rarity for Hong Kong films, and generally attract respectable audience numbers. Jet Li has reduced his Hong Kong output since 1998's Hitman concentrating on Hollywood instead. After a minor role in Lethal Weapon 4 (1998), he has gone on to star in several Hollywood films which have performed respectably and made a name for him with American audiences. So far, he has returned to Chinese cinema for only two films: Hero (2002) and Fearless (2006). He claimed Fearless would be his last traditional kung fu film. Chow Yun-fat has also moved to Hollywood. After his 1995 film Peace Hotel, he has made a handful of films in Hollywood which have not seen as much success as Jet Li's: these include The Replacement Killers (1998), The Corruptor (1999), Anna and the King (1999) and Bulletproof Monk (2003). He returned to China for 2000's Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon and 2006's Curse of the Golden Flower.  Recent trends  The Hong Kong film industry has been in a severe slump since the mid-1990s. The number of local films produced, and their box office takings, are dramatically reduced; American imports now dominate in a way they had not for decades, or perhaps ever. This crisis and increased contact with Western cinema have probably been the biggest recent influences on Hong Kong action cinema.MovieMaker Magazine issue 49: The New Orient Express Hong Kong to Hollywood by Patrick J Gorman . Retrieved 1 April 2006. Luring local and regional youth audiences away from Hollywood is a constant concern. Action movies are now generally headlined by babyfaced Cantonese pop music idols, such as Ekin Cheng and Nicholas Tse, enhanced with wires and digital effects ‚Äì a trend also driven by the waning of a previous generation of martial arts- trained stars. The late 1990s witnessed a fad for Cantopop stars in high-tech, more American-styled action pictures such as Downtown Torpedoes (1997), Gen-X Cops and Purple Storm (both 1999). Andrew Lau's wuxia comic-book adaptation The Storm Riders (1998) earned a record-breaking gross and ushered in an era of computer-generated imagery, previously little used in Hong Kong film. Tsui Hark's lavish CGI-enhanced efforts Time and Tide (2000) and The Legend of Zu (2001), however, were surprisingly unsuccessful. Comedy megastar and director Stephen Chow used digital effects to push his typical affectionate parody of martial arts conventions to cartoonish levels in Shaolin Soccer (2001) and Kung Fu Hustle (2004), each of which also set a new box office record. Striking a different note were a series of crime films more restrained and actor-driven than the earlier, John Woo-inspired examples. The Milkyway Image production company was at the vanguard with examples like Patrick Yau's Expect the Unexpected (1998), Johnnie To's The Mission (1999) and Running Out of Time (1999). Andrew Lau and Alan Mak's blockbuster Infernal Affairs trilogy (2002‚Äì2003) has set off a mini-trend of brooding police thrillers. Collaboration with other industries, particularly that of Mainland China, is another increasingly common survival and recovery strategy. Hong Kong stars and other personnel have been involved in international wuxia successes like Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon (2000), Hero (2002) and House of Flying Daggers (2004).

Consequently, states should be the final arbiters over whether the federal government had overstepped the limits of its authority as set forth in the compact. =Arguments in favor= Leading proponents of this view of the U.S. Constitution primarily originated from Virginia and other southern states. Notable proponents of the theory include Thomas Jefferson.Jefferson to William B. Giles in letter dated 12/26/1825.

Meanwhile, James Madison had asserted in Federalist No. 39 that \\"the people\\" were not as individuals composing one entire nation, but as composing the distinct and independent States to which they respectively belong;\\" the Constitution was \\"to be the assent and ratification of the several States, derived from the supreme authority in each State, the authority of the people themselves;\\" and \\"the act of the people, as forming so many independent States, not as forming one aggregate nation, is obvious from this single consideration.\\" Likewise, as noted in Article VII of the Constitution, ratification took place not by a single popular convention but conventions of only the ratifying states and would carry the Constitution into effect only between those ratifying states. Former Confederate President Jefferson Davis was an avid supporter of the Compact theory, and devoted large portions of his two volume book \\"The Rise and Fall of the Confederate Government\\" to explaining the Compact Theory. Still concerned that people would not understand what the Compact Theory was, he made a second book, \\"A Short History of the Confederate States of America\\", to explain it once more. =Arguments against= Others have taken the position that the federal government is not a compact among the states but was instead formed directly by the people in their exercise of their sovereign power. The people determined that the federal government should be superior to the states. Under this view, the states are not parties to the Constitution and do not have the right to determine for themselves the proper scope of federal authority but instead are bound by the determinations of the federal government. The state of Vermont took that position in response to the Kentucky Resolutions.In response to the Kentucky Resolutions' assertion that the states formed the federal government by compact and retained the right to judge the federal government's laws, Vermont stated, \\"This cannot be true. The old confederation, it is true, was formed by the state Legislatures, but the present Constitution of the United States was derived from an higher authority. The people of the United States formed the federal constitution, and not the states, or their Legislatures. And although each state is authorized to propose amendments, yet there is a wide difference between proposing amendments to the constitution, and assuming, or inviting, a power to dictate and control the General Government.\\" Daniel Webster advocated that view in his debate with Robert Hayne in the Senate in 1830: > [I]t cannot be shown, that the Constitution is a compact between State > governments. The Constitution itself, in its very front, refutes that idea; > it, declares that it is ordained and established by the people of the United > States. So far from saying that it is established by the governments of the > several States, it does not even say that it is established by the people of > the several States; but it pronounces that it is established by the people > of the United States, in the aggregate.... When the gentleman says the > Constitution is a compact between the States, he uses language exactly > applicable to the old Confederation. He speaks as if he were in Congress > before 1789. He describes fully that old state of things then existing. The > Confederation was, in strictness, a compact; the States, as States, were > parties to it. We had no other general government. But that was found > insufficient, and inadequate to the public exigencies. The people were not > satisfied with it, and undertook to establish a better. They undertook to > form a general government, which should stand on a new basis; not a > confederacy, not a league, not a compact between States, but a Constitution; > a popular government, founded in popular election, directly responsible to > the people themselves, and divided into branches with prescribed limits of > power, and prescribed duties. They ordained such a government, they gave it > the name of a Constitution, therein they established a distribution of > powers between this, their general government, and their several State > governments.Webster's Second Reply to Hayne, January 26, 1830 The leading 19th-century commentary on the Constitution, Justice Joseph Story's Commentaries on the Constitution of the United States (1833), likewise rejected the compact theory and concluded that the Constitution was established directly by the people, not the states, and that it constitutes supreme law, not a mere compact.Story wrote: \\"In what light, then, is the constitution of the United States to be regarded? Is it a mere compact, treaty, or confederation of the states composing the Union, or of the people thereof, whereby each of the several states, and the people thereof, have respectively bound themselves to each other? Or is it a form of government, which, having been ratified by a majority of the people in all the states, is obligatory upon them, as the prescribed rule of conduct of the sovereign power, to the extent of its provisions?... There is nowhere found upon the face of the constitution any clause, intimating it to be a compact, or in anywise providing for its interpretation, as such. On the contrary, the preamble emphatically speaks of it, as a solemn ordinance and establishment of government. The language is, 'We, the people of the United States, do ordain and establish this constitution for the United States of America.' The people do ordain and establish, not contract and stipulate with each other. The people of the United States, not the distinct people of a particular state with the people of the other states. The people ordain and establish a constitution,' not a confederation.'... Nor should it be omitted, that in the most elaborate expositions of the constitution by its friends, its character, as a permanent form of government, as a fundamental law, as a supreme rule, which no state was at liberty to disregard, suspend, or annul, was constantly admitted, and insisted on, as one of the strongest reasons, why it should be adopted in lieu of the confederation.\\" In the years before the Civil War, the compact theory was used by southern states to argue that they had a right to nullify federal law and to secede from the union. For example, during the Nullification Crisis of 1828-1832, John C. Calhoun argued in his South Carolina Exposition and Protest that the states, as the parties to a compact, had the right to judge for themselves whether the terms of the compact were being honored. Calhoun described this \\"right of judging\\" as \\"an essential attribute of sovereignty,\\" which the states retained when the Constitution was formed. Calhoun said the states had the right to nullify, or veto, any laws that were inconsistent with the compact.\\"[T]he sovereign powers delegated are divided between the General and State Governments, and that the latter bold their portion by the same tenure as the former, it would seem impossible to deny to the States the right of deciding on the infractions of their powers, and the proper remedy to be applied for their correction. The right of judging, in such cases, is an essential attribute of sovereignty, of which the States cannot be divested without losing their sovereignty itself, and being reduced to a subordinate corporate condition. In fact, to divide power, and to give to one of the parties the exclusive right of judging of the portion allotted to each, is, in reality, not to divide it at all; and to reserve such exclusive right to the General Government (it matters not by what department to be exercised), is to convert it, in fact, into a great consolidated government, with unlimited powers, and to divest the States, in reality, of all their rights.... But the existence of the right of judging of their powers, so clearly established from the sovereignty of States, as clearly implies a veto or control, within its limits, on the action of the General Government, on contested points of authority.... May the General Government... encroach on the rights reserved to the States respectively? To the States respectively each in its sovereign capacity is reserved the power, by its veto, or right of interposition, to arrest the encroachment.\\" South Carolina Exposition and Protest, 1828 When the southern states seceded in 1860-61, they relied on the compact theory to justify secession and argued that the northern states had violated the compact by undermining and attacking the institution of slavery and the slaveholders' property rights. The Southern states stated that they were therefore justified in withdrawing from the compact among the states.For example, South Carolina's statement of secession stated: \\"Thus was established, by compact between the States, a Government with definite objects and powers, limited to the express words of the grant.... [T]he constituted compact has been deliberately broken and disregarded by the non-slaveholding States, and the consequence follows that South Carolina is released from her obligation.... Those States have assumed the right of deciding upon the propriety of our domestic institutions; and have denied the rights of property established in fifteen of the States and recognized by the Constitution; they have denounced as sinful the institution of slavery; they have permitted open establishment among them of societies, whose avowed object is to disturb the peace and to eloign the property of the citizens of other States. They have encouraged and assisted thousands of our slaves to leave their homes; and those who remain, have been incited by emissaries, books and pictures to servile insurrection.\\" Declaration of the Immediate Causes Which Induce and Justify the Secession of South Carolina from the Federal Union, 1860 The US Supreme Court has rejected the idea that the Constitution is a compact among the states. Rather, the Court has stated that the Constitution was established directly by the people of the United States, not by the states. In one of the Supreme Court's first significant decisions, Chisholm v. Georgia (1793), Chief Justice John Jay stated that the Constitution was established directly by the people. Jay noted the language of the Preamble of the Constitution, which states that the Constitution was ordained and established by \\"We the people,\\" and he stated: \\"Here we see the people acting as sovereigns of the whole country, and, in the language of sovereignty, establishing a Constitution by which it was their will that the State governments should be bound.\\"\\"[The people] made a Confederation of the States the basis of a general government [i.e. the Articles of Confederation]. Experience disappointed the expectations they had formed from it, and then the people, in their collective and national capacity, established the present Constitution. It is remarkable that, in establishing it, the people exercised their own rights, and their own proper sovereignty, and, conscious of the plenitude of it, they declared with becoming dignity, 'We the people of the United States, do ordain and establish this Constitution.' Here we see the people acting as sovereigns of the whole country, and, in the language of sovereignty, establishing a Constitution by which it was their will that the State governments should be bound, and to which the State Constitutions should be made to conform. Every State Constitution is a compact made by and between the citizens of a State to govern themselves in a certain manner, and the Constitution of the United States is likewise a compact made by the people of the United States to govern themselves as to general objects in a certain manner.\\" Chisholm v. Georgia, 2 U.S. (2 Dall.) 419 (1793). Jay went on to say that the people had delegated to the federal judiciary the task of interpreting the meaning, construction, and operation of the Constitution. In Martin v. Hunter's Lessee (1816), the Supreme Court explicitly rejected the idea that the Constitution is a compact among the states: \\"The Constitution of the United States was ordained and established not by the States in their sovereign capacities, but emphatically, as the preamble of the Constitution declares, by 'the people of the United States.'\\" The Court contrasted the earlier Articles of Confederation with the Constitution, characterized the Articles of Confederation as a compact among states, and stated that the Constitution was established by not the states but the people.\\"The Constitution of the United States was ordained and established not by the States in their sovereign capacities, but emphatically, as the preamble of the Constitution declares, by 'the people of the United States.'... The Constitution was for a new Government, organized with new substantive powers, and not a mere supplementary charter to a Government already existing. The Confederation was a compact between States, and its structure and powers were wholly unlike those of the National Government. The Constitution was an act of the people of the United States to supersede the Confederation, and not to be ingrafted on it, as a stock through which it was to receive life and nourishment.\\" Martin v. Hunter's Lessee, 14 U.S. (1 Wheat.) 304 (1816). Likewise, in McCulloch v. Maryland (1819), the Supreme Court stated that the federal Constitution proceeded directly from the people and was not created by the states. It stated that the Constitution was binding on and could not be negated by the states. It again contrasted the Articles of Confederation, which was established by the states, to the Constitution, which was established by the people.\\"The government proceeds directly from the people; is 'ordained and established' in the name of the people, and is declared to be ordained, 'in order to form a more perfect union, establish justice, insure domestic tranquillity, and secure the blessings of liberty to themselves and to their posterity.'... It required not the affirmance, and could not be negatived, by the State Governments. The Constitution, when thus adopted, was of complete obligation, and bound the State sovereignties.... To the formation of a league such as was the Confederation, the State sovereignties were certainly competent. But when, 'in order to form a more perfect union,' it was deemed necessary to change this alliance into an effective Government, possessing great and sovereign powers and acting directly on the people, the necessity of referring it to the people, and of deriving its powers directly from them, was felt and acknowledged by all. The Government of the Union then (whatever may be the influence of this fact on the case) is, emphatically and truly, a Government of the people. In form and in substance, it emanates from them. Its powers are granted by them, and are to be exercised directly on them, and for their benefit.\\" McCulloch v. Maryland, 17 U.S. (4 Wheat.) 316 (1819). After the Civil War, in Texas v. White (1869), a case discussing the legal status of the southern states that had attempted to secede, the Supreme Court stated that the union was not merely a compact among states but was \\"something more than a compact.\\"\\"When, therefore, Texas became one of the United States, she entered into an indissoluble relation. All the obligations of perpetual union, and all the guaranties of republican government in the Union, attached at once to the State. The act which consummated her admission into the Union was something more than a compact; it was the incorporation of a new member into the political body. And it was final. The union between Texas and the other States was as complete, as perpetual, and as indissoluble as the union between the original States.\\" Texas v. White, 74 U.S. (7 Wall.) 700 (1869). Compact theory in Canada In the Canadian context, compact theory posits that Confederation was an agreement between the two founding peoples, French and English, and that therefore Quebec should have special veto powers relating to its position in the federal structure.Stephen Brooks, Canadian Democracy: An Introduction, 5th ed. (Don Mills, Ontario: Oxford University Press, 2007), 201. However, compact theory was rejected by the Supreme Court of Canada in the 1981 Patriation Reference.Brooks, 201. Compact theory is often advanced by Quebec nationalists.

It may be sponsored by the local (municipal) government or self-supporting. These groups rehearse regularly and perform at least once a year. Some bands are also marching bands, participating in parades and other outdoor events. Although they are volunteer musical organizations, community bands may employ an Artistic Director (conductor) or various operational staff. Community bands can also be known as \\"town,\\" \\"citizen,\\" \\"municipal\\", or \\"civic\\" bands. They may use the terms \\"wind orchestra,\\" \\"wind symphony\\", or \\"wind ensemble\\" in place of \\"band\\". A group of this type often includes the name of the community or organization which sponsors it, the town or county where it is based, or a local geographical landmark or regional term in its name. Community bands in the United States In the United States, community band concerts are most frequently given during holidays and patriotic events, such as the Fourth of July, Memorial Day, Father's Day, and the lighting of community Christmas trees. During the summer, most community concerts are given outdoors. The size of a community band varies from about ten musicians to over one hundred. During the United States Bicentennial, having a community band was one of the criteria for being designated a \\"Bicentennial City\\". There are about 2,500 community bands across the United States. The modern American community band is rooted in European tradition. Immigrants, like the German Moravians who settled in Pennsylvania and North Carolina, brought the band tradition with them to the United States. The Moravians organized bands in towns where they settled, and they offered both secular and religious music selections. The Moravian bands are still playing in Moravian communities, such as in Winston- Salem, North Carolina. Community bands in the United States often emerged from militia or military bands. The earliest amateur bands in the United States did occasionally include woodwind instruments but band and band music emphasized primarily the brass instruments. The popularity of early community bands can be attributed to the participation of thousands of ordinary citizens in these ensembles and the patriotic appeal of the music and performance. There is one estimate that there were 10,000 bands in the United States in 1889. Of those, close to 100 are still active. Wartime patriotism, such as the War of 1812, the Civil War, World War I and II, and even the recent war with Iraq have added to the popularity and number of community bands. In 1921, famous band composer Karl King was influential in establishing the Iowa Band Law, which allowed cities to levy a local tax ‚Äúfor the maintenance and employment of a band for musical purposes.‚Äù This law was eventually adopted by 28 other states.http://karlking.us/timeline.htm Community bands experienced a great dying out after the end of World War I, victims of the automobile, new mass media, and a large cultural shift. This actually led to a rise in school music programs; the death of community bands left instrument manufacturers without a market for their product, so they marketed heavily to schools. The increased number of musicians that learned to play an instrument in high school or college bands but did not pursue music as a career has also provided a rich pool of amateur talent seeking an outlet for their musical abilities. An increased availability of music written for concert band has also benefitted the community band from after World War II to the present.

The character, a resident of contemporary London, is introduced in the first episode of the 2005 revival as the mother of Rose Tyler, a travelling companion of the alien time traveller the Doctor. Jackie is a recurring character during the 2005 and 2006 series of the show, and later makes one-off appearances in 2008 and 2010. The character has also appeared in expanded universe material such as the Doctor Who New Series Adventures novels and the Doctor Who Magazine comic strip. Within the series narrative, Jackie is a widow who lives alone with her daughter Rose until Rose leaves her mundane life behind to travel through time and space with the Doctor. Jackie's feeling of loss and of being left behind is explored in subsequent episodes. As the character is brought into danger by her proximity to the Doctor, she resents his influence over Rose. However, once he undergoes a regeneration, effectively becoming a new man, Jackie has a more cordial relationship with him. The character was written out at the end of the 2006 series, along with Rose, in a storyline which sees them trapped in a parallel universe where Jackie forms a new relationship with an alternate version of her deceased husband Pete Tyler. In reviving the television series after a sixteen-year hiatus (1989‚Äì2005), executive producer Russell T Davies was keen to provide a believable background for the Doctor's companion and a context for her travels to the past and future. The character of Jackie was created, along with Rose's on/off boyfriend Mickey, to keep the series grounded in reality. In writing Jackie, Davies incorporated both comic and tragic elements. Following the departure of the Tyler family, Davies was keen to bring Jackie back alongside Rose for future appearances. Reviewers generally reacted positively to the development of the character, though some identified unlikeable traits. Appearances =Television= Jackie is introduced in \\"Rose\\" (2005) as the late-thirties single mother of the episode's eponymous character, Rose Tyler (Billie Piper). After the Ninth Doctor (Christopher Eccleston) arrives at Jackie's flat in search of Rose, Jackie attempts to seduce him. She is later attacked by shop window dummies but is saved when Rose and the Doctor destroy the alien consciousness able to control plastic. When Rose returns to London, twelve months have passed; in the intervening year Jackie had organised a missing person campaign to search for her daughter and accused Rose's boyfriend Mickey Smith (Noel Clarke) of murder. She also suspects the Doctor of being an internet predator. She learns the truth about Rose's new life after battling the Slitheen and being present with Mickey as he organises a missile strike to destroy the aliens. The episode \\"Father's Day\\" depicts two younger versions of Jackie also played by Coduri. It is shown that whilst Rose was a child (Julia Joyce) Jackie told her idyllic stories of her deceased father, Pete (Shaun Dingwall). Rose attends her parents' marriage, in which Pete is unable to recite Jackie's full name, Jacqueline Andrea Suzette Prentice, and after then travelling ahead to 1987, learns that her father was a failed entrepreneur and that her parents' marriage had been stormy; Jackie suspects Pete is an adulterer and also threatens him with divorce. In the 2005 series finale, \\"The Parting of the Ways\\", Jackie is glad to have Rose home after the Doctor returns her to the 21st century from the far future in order to protect her. She is persuaded to help return Rose to save the Doctor after Rose mentions her encounter with her father, reminding Jackie that he would try anything rather than give up. In the 2005 Christmas day episode \\"The Christmas Invasion\\" Jackie is bewildered by the Doctor's new incarnation (David Tennant) and concerned about the side- effects of his regeneration. When he recovers, Jackie is happy for Rose to resume travelling with him. In \\"Rise of the Cybermen\\" and \\"The Age of Steel\\" (2006) Coduri plays a parallel universe Jackie, who is rich and famous because of the parallel Pete Tyler's success. This version of Jackie is intent on maintaining a facade; she hides the fact her marriage is deteriorating, denies turning forty and chastises Rose for speaking to her whilst posing as staff. Rose and the parallel universe Pete try to save her when the Cybermen invade, but she is killed during the attack. In \\"Love & Monsters\\", Jackie expresses how hard and lonely it has been to be left behind by her daughter. After learning a romantic interest, Elton Pope (Marc Warren), only befriended her to track Rose and the Doctor, Jackie, she throws him out of her house, stating a priority to defend the Doctor and Rose. In \\"Army of Ghosts\\" Jackie is unwillingly taken in the TARDIS, the Doctor's time machine, to the Torchwood Institute where he brings her on an investigation. In \\"Doomsday\\", due to invading Cybermen from the parallel universe, the walls between universes break down and Jackie meets the parallel universe version of Pete. The defeat of warring Cybermen and Dalek armies results in Jackie being sent to the parallel universe, where Rose is also later trapped. In the epilogue it is mentioned that Jackie is in a relationship with Pete and expecting a baby. In the series four finale episode \\"Journey's End\\" (2008), Jackie returns to her original earth with Mickey in order to find Rose, who has travelled back to stop the Daleks destroying reality. Comfortable carrying a large gun, Jackie blows up a Dalek to save former companion Sarah Jane Smith (Elisabeth Sladen). After a half-human genetic clone of the Doctor wipes out the Daleks, Jackie returns to the parallel universe with Rose, who is tasked with healing the new Doctor. It is revealed that Jackie and Pete now have a young son named Tony. Jackie cameos in David Tennant's final story, \\"The End of Time\\" when the dying Tenth Doctor visits the Powell estate on New Year's Day 2005 to bid a final farewell to Rose. =Literature= Jackie appears in several of the Ninth and Tenth Doctor New Series Adventures novels. In Winner Takes All by Jacqueline Rayner, published in May 2005, Jackie falls for a scheme to take humans \\"on holiday\\" to fight in an alien war. A thug who lives in Rose's estate mugs Jackie and takes the \\"winning ticket\\" that qualifies her for the trip. Jackie ends up in hospital, but her assailant fares worse: he takes her place as a remote-controlled soldier on an alien planet, and is killed. Jackie makes cameo appearances in Only Human by Gareth Roberts and The Stealers of Dreams by Steve Lyons published in September 2005. In Only Human, a time-lost Neanderthal flirts with Jackie at a London nightclub before Captain Jack Harkness steers him away from her, feeling that Jackie would not appreciate further Doctor-related strangeness in her life. In The Stealers of Dreams, Rose uses the \\"superphone\\" to call Jackie from a human colony world in the future. Jackie complains that Rose did not let her know she was going to be in Cardiff during her recent visit to that city. Jackie appears in the introductory section of The Stone Rose, released in April 2006, in which she and Mickey alert the Doctor and Rose to a strange statue of Rose in the British Museum. Released the same month, The Feast of the Drowned by Stephen Cole, is set wholly on contemporary earth and explores the context of Jackie's relationship with Rose further. When Rose is captured by the malevolent \\"waterhive\\", Jackie is targeted by ghostly apparitions seeking to lure her to the same fate. Jackie also appears in the Doctor Who Magazine comic strip \\"The Green-Eyed Monster\\" in which she and the Tenth Doctor feign a romantic relationship in order to free Rose from possession by a creature that feeds on jealousy. =Audio drama= Following the folding of AudioGO and Big Finish's acquisition of the new series license, Billie Piper and David Tennant reprised their roles as Rose Tyler and the Tenth Doctor in Doctor Who: The Tenth Doctor Adventures. Coduri reprised her role as Jackie in the story titled Infamy of the Zaross, released in November 2017. Cordui narrated two short trips titled The Siege of Big Ben and Flight into Hull. Coduri featured in the Ninth Doctor Chronicles alongside Piper and Adam Mitchell (Bruno Langley) and is due to return in Rose Tyler - The Dimension Canon. Development =Casting and concept= Members of the production team noted a resemblance between Coduri and Piper (pictured). In creating Rose as a new companion for the 2005 revival of Doctor Who executive producer and lead writer Russell T Davies felt that it would be necessary to examine the questions of \\"do her family miss her?\\" and \\"has she gone missing?\\" which he believed to be unavoidable questions. Davies created Jackie and Mickey and provided a story structure that would see Rose return frequently to them in order to make her \\"real\\" and to \\"give her a life\\". In Davies' original pitch for the series, Jackie was initially named Judy Tyler.Russell, p.53 The roles of Jackie and Mickey were cast alongside other guest characters for the 2005 series' first production block including Joseph Green and Indra Ganesh from \\"Aliens of London\\" and \\"World War Three\\". Camille Coduri was suggested to casting director Andy Pryor and the other members of the production team by executive producer Mal Young. Both producer Phil Collinson and executive producer Julie Gardner felt that Coduri and Billie Piper (Rose) physically resembled each other and this aided the portrayal of their mother/daughter relationship. Discussing Coduri's casting, Collinson stated that she \\"understood what Jackie was, from the very first scene she read\\". Coduri was already \\"very familiar\\" with Davies' work as writer and executive producer and so \\"was very excited and quite terrified\\" about being part of the series because of her level of respect for him.Russell, p.54 Coduri felt Jackie to share similarities with herself, insofar as she is \\"very protective of [her] children\\" and a \\"bit gobby\\". The Doctor Who Annual 2006, published in August 2005, gives further background information on Jackie in an article written by Russell T Davies. Davies states that Jackie supports herself financially by working occasionally from home as a hairdresser. In the Journal of Commonwealth Literature Lindy A. Orthia observes that the \\"giro-collecting\\" Jackie is part of the group of companions introduced in Davies' era of Doctor Who that are \\"drawn from a cosmopolitan vision\\" in that they are all \\"black, queer and/or working class.\\" Orthia contends that whilst working-class companions had featured previously in the show \\"none were unskilled workers nor chronically under- or unemployed like Rose, Donna and Jackie.\\" =Character development= Piper felt that in series one the relationship between Rose and Jackie is \\"like any mother-daughter relationship\\" in that as much as Rose loves her mother \\"there's also this resentment there\\" because Jackie tries to stop her \\"moving forward\\". Despite sometimes writing Jackie as a comic character, Davies chose to examine the sadder aspects of her character such as her loneliness and unwillingness to let Rose go. In his book The Writer's Tale, Davies expresses his contention that comedy and sadness are often inseparable and states that though ‚ÄúJackie Tyler makes us laugh\\" he knew he would \\"uncover something sad at the heart of her\\". He argues that even as far back as \\"Rose\\" Jackie is \\"holding Rose back\\" citing her suggestion her daughter work in a butcher's shop. Discussing Jackie's attempted seduction of the Doctor, Coduri stated that her character \\"has the hots for him\\" and in general \\"loves the company of men and is always looking for Mr Right\\". Promoting her role in the 2005 Christmas special, Coduri describes Jackie as being ‚Äúnot very good in a crisis‚Äù and \\"a bit of a screamer\\" in contrast to Rose who is adept at saving the world. Andy Pryor believes that Coduri's acting ability influenced the writing decisions regarding the character in the second series. He felt Jackie' actions in the second series were \\"incredibly moving\\" as a result of Coduri's acting range.Russell, p.55 Gardner concurred, stating in 2006 that \\"she's grown in performance, episode by episode\\". In the commentary for \\"Army of Ghosts\\" Davies expresses delight at having Jackie aboard the TARDIS. He stated that he had been \\"dying\\" to have Jackie take Rose's place for an episode. To explain Torchwood not realising that Jackie was not Rose, Davies amended the script for \\"Love & Monsters\\" to mention that Torchwood's files on Rose had been corrupted by the \\"Bad Wolf\\" virus. Ahead of 2006 series finale \\"Doomsday\\" Coduri expected the character of Jackie to be killed off in a \\"comic but sad moment.\\" She was therefore pleasantly surprised to discover that the character would be sent to live in a parallel universe instead.Russell, p.240 Davies had planned for the character to return in the fourth series finale since the episodes were first conceived and had asked Coduri to keep four weeks free for filming. In January 2008, whilst still writing the scripts, Davies became afraid that there was not space for the character. Her appearance was set to be reduced to a single scene at 'Bad Wolf Bay' at the end of \\"Journey's End\\". He also was concerned that because the character has a young son it would not have made dramatic sense for her \\"to enter a bloody battlezone.\\" Eventually, he decided to pair the character with Mickey and Sarah Jane and reasoned that seeking her daughter provided enough motivation for her to get involved in the conflict. Returning to the series in 2008 for \\"Journey's End\\", Coduri initially felt it was ‚Äúweird‚Äù to be playing Jackie again. She describes Jackie as being ‚Äúbraver‚Äù in this episode but frightened of \\"losing Rose full stop.\\" When asked in 2011 whether she would return to the series, Coduri stated that she would return if asked but felt it was not likely because she had already \\"been back to say goodbye at least twice\\" and believes that the story has been wrapped up. Reception James Chapman, author of the book Inside the Tardis: The Worlds of Doctor Who, identifies the presence of Jackie and Mickey as part of Davies attempt to \\"create a social context\\" for Rose. In a 2006 essay entitled \\"Jackie Tyler Leaves the TV On\\", television writer and author Paul Cornell notes that whilst some fans would rather see less time devoted to Rose's family, Jackie is emblematic of a section of the revival of Doctor Whos target demographic. Kay McFadden of The Seattle Times felt the character to be \\"antic\\" and overbearing\\" in the premiere episode, whilst SFX described the character's appearance in \\"The End of the World\\" as a \\"wonderful moment\\" that reminded the audience of the context of the adventure. Charles McGrath of The New York Times, in a review of \\"Rose\\" and \\"The End of the World\\", described Jackie as \\"vain\\" and \\"slutty\\". In their unauthorised guide to the revival of Doctor Who Graeme Burk and Robert Smith? identify \\"Aliens of London\\" and \\"World War Three\\" as a turning point in the character from comic relief to a character the audience \\"are invested in and care about\\". For the authors, the moment where Jackie and Mickey stand behind \\"Rose's mad dream\\" in \\"The Parting of the Ways\\" is the \\"stand up and cheer moment to end them all\\". SFX reviewer Nick Setchfield praised Davies' \\"populist voice\\" in relation to Jackie's characterisation in \\"Love and Monsters\\" stating \\"there‚Äôs something just right about Jackie seducing Elton to the Asda charms of Il Divo.\\" He commented that the script provided something \\"genuinely moving about Jackie‚Äôs desperation\\" which was \\"well played by Coduri\\". Similarly, IGN's Ahsan Haque felt that Jackie 's \\"attention seeking attraction towards Elton was handled extremely well.\\" Burk and Smith? identify Jackie's \\"because it's hard\\" speech as \\"Coduri's best acting in the series, bar none\\" opining that the actress \\"infuses her scenes with comic brilliance, wistful reflection and raw anger, all in the space of several minutes\\". They felt that Davies keeps \\"[her] humorous elements intact and shows us the bittersweet pain that underpins it.\\" In his review of \\"Army of Ghosts\\" Arnold T Blumberg, writing for Now Playing magazine, observes that the character \\"gets to be a companion for a little while\\" and \\"does a damn fine job of it too.\\" Burk and Smith? list the simultaneous reunion and first meeting between Jackie and Pete in \\"Doomsday\\" as one of the episode's poignant moments, stating that the scene \\"sings joyously\\" through the performances of Coduri and Dingwall. Commenting on Jackie's involvement in \\"Journey's End\\" Travis Fickett observed that having the Doctor tell her to stay away from the TARDIS console was \\"a fun moment\\", although he felt that having so many characters present in the episode was \\"a bit awkward.\\" Dave Golder of SFX stated that there being \\"not enough Jacqui \\" was one of the episode's low points. Reviewers also compared the character of Donna Noble's mother, Sylvia (Jacqueline King), who featured semi-regularly during the fourth series, against Jackie. Airlock Alpha's Alan Stanley Blair remarked upon the premiere of \\"Partners in Crime\\" that Sylvia \\"doesn't have the same appeal\\" as Jackie. Charlie Jane Anders of io9 comments that until the episode \\"Turn Left\\" Sylvia seemed like \\"a weak copy of Jackie Tyler\\" who lacked Jackie's \\"saucy warmth.\\" Of her role in the series, Jon Wise of People magazine opined that Coduri \\"adds a certain sexiness\\" to the role of Rose's mum. In an interview with Coduri, Gay Times magazine stated that she is \\"beloved\\" by members of the gay community because of her role as Jackie, something the actress felt was a \\"privilege\\". The exposure given to Coduri whilst playing the role led to her being recognised frequently on the street. The actress commented that she also received \\"heaps of fan mail, mostly from men\\" which verged more on the \\"respectful, romantic side than the drop-your- drawers side\\".

It is widely used in the synthesis of organic and organometallic compounds. PPh3 exists as relatively air stable, colorless crystals at room temperature. It dissolves in non-polar organic solvents such as benzene and diethyl ether. Preparation and structure Triphenylphosphine can be prepared in the laboratory by treatment of phosphorus trichloride with phenylmagnesium bromide or phenyllithium. The industrial synthesis involves the reaction between phosphorus trichloride, chlorobenzene, and sodium.: :PCl3 \\\\+ 3 PhCl + 6 Na ‚Üí PPh3 \\\\+ 6 NaCl Triphenylphosphine crystallizes in triclinic and monoclinic modification In both cases, the molecule adopts a pyramidal structure with propeller-like arrangement of the three phenyl groups. Principal reactions with chalcogens, halogens, and acids Triphenylphosphine undergoes slow oxidation by air to give triphenylphosphine oxide, Ph3PO: :2 PPh3 \\\\+ O2 ‚Üí 2 OPPh3 This impurity can be removed by recrystallisation of PPh3 from either hot ethanol or hot isopropanol. This method capitalizes on the fact that OPPh3 is more polar and hence more soluble in polar solvents than PPh3. Triphenylphosphine abstracts sulfur from polysulfide compounds, episulfides, and elemental sulfur. Simple organosulfur compounds such as thiols and thioethers are unreactive, however. The phosphorus-containing product is triphenylphosphine sulfide, Ph3PS. This reaction can be employed to assay the \\"labile\\" S0 content of a sample, say vulcanized rubber. Triphenylphosphine selenide, Ph3PSe, may be easily prepared via treatment of PPh3 with red (alpha-monoclinic) Se. Salts of selenocyanate, SeCN‚àí, are used as the Se0 source. PPh3 can also form an adduct with Te, although this adduct primarily exists as (Ph3P)2Te rather than PPh3Te. Aryl azides react with PPh3 to give phosphanimines, analogues of OPPh3, via the Staudinger reaction. Illustrative is the preparation of triphenylphosphine phenylimide: :PPh3 \\\\+ PhN3 ‚Üí PhNPPh3 \\\\+ N2 The phosphanimine can be hydrolyzed to the amine. Typically the intermediate phosphanimine is not isolated. :PPh3 \\\\+ RN3 \\\\+ H2O ‚Üí OPPh3 \\\\+ N2 \\\\+ RNH2 Cl2 adds to PPh3 to give triphenylphosphine dichloride ([PPh3Cl]Cl), which exists as the moisture- sensitive phosphonium halide. This reagent is used to convert alcohols to alkyl chlorides in organic synthesis. Bis(triphenylphosphine)iminium chloride (PPN+Cl-, formula [(C6H5)3P)2N]Cl is prepared from triphenylphosphine dichloride: :2 Ph3PCl2 \\\\+ NH2OH*HCl + Ph3P -> {[Ph3P]2N}Cl + 4HCl + Ph3PO PPh3 is a weak base. It forms isolable salts with strong acids such as HBr. The product contains the phosphonium cation [HPPh3]+. PPh3 is pyramidal with a chiral propeller-like arrangement of the three phenyl rings. The rigidity of PPh3 contributes to the ease with which its derivatives crystallize. Organic reactions PPh3 is widely used in organic synthesis. The properties that guide its usage are its nucleophilicity and its reducing character. The nucleophilicity of PPh3 is indicated by its reactivity toward electrophilic alkenes, such as Michael-acceptors, and alkyl halides. It is also used in the synthesis of biaryl compounds, such as the Suzuki reaction. =Quaternization= PPh3 combines with alkyl halides to give phosphonium salts. The facility of the quaternization reaction follows the usual pattern whereby benzylic and allylic halides are particularly efficient reactants: :PPh3 \\\\+ CH3I ‚Üí [CH3PPh3]+I‚àí These salts, which can often be isolated as crystalline solids, react with strong bases to form ylides: :440px Such ylides are key reagents in the Wittig reactions, used to convert aldehydes and ketones into alkenes. Aryl halides will quaternize PPh3 to give Tetraphenylphosphonium salts: :PPh3 \\\\+ PhBr ‚Üí [PPh4]Br The reaction however requires elevated temperatures and metal catalysts. =Mitsunobu reaction= In the Mitsunobu reaction, a mixture of triphenylphosphine and diisopropyl azodicarboxylate (\\"DIAD\\", or its diethyl analogue, DEAD) converts an alcohol and a carboxylic acid to an ester. The DIAD is reduced as it serves as the hydrogen acceptor, and the PPh3 is oxidized to OPPh3. =Appel reaction= In the Appel reaction, a mixture of PPh3 and CX4 (X = Cl, Br) is used to convert alcohols to alkyl halides. Triphenylphosphine oxide (OPPh3) is a byproduct. :PPh3 \\\\+ CBr4 \\\\+ RCH2OH ‚Üí OPPh3 \\\\+ RCH2Br + HCBr3 This reaction commences with nucleophilic attack of PPh3 on CBr4, an extension of the quaternization reaction listed above. =Deoxygenation= The easy oxygenation of PPh3 is exploited in its use to deoxygenate organic peroxides, which generally occurs with retention of configuration: :PPh3 \\\\+ RO2H ‚Üí OPPh3 \\\\+ ROH (R = alkyl) It is also used for the decomposition of organic ozonides to ketones and aldehydes, although dimethyl sulfide is more popular for the reaction as the side product, dimethyl sulfoxide is more readily separated from the reaction mixture than triphenylphosphine oxide. Aromatic N-oxides are reduced to the corresponding amine in high yield at room temperature with irradiation: : =Sulfonation= Sulfonation of PPh3 gives tris(3-sulfophenyl)phosphine, P(C6H4-3-SO3‚àí)3 (TPPTS), usually isolated as the trisodium salt. In contrast to PPh3, TPPTS is water-soluble, as are its metal derivatives. Rhodium complexes of TPPTS are used in certain industrial hydroformylation reactions. 3,3‚Ä≤,3‚Ä≥-Phosphanetriyltris(benzenesulfonic acid) trisodium salt is a water- soluble derivative of triphenylphosphine. =Reduction to diphenylphosphide= Lithium in THF as well as Na or K react with PPh3 to give Ph2PM (M = Li, Na, K). These salts are versatile precursors to tertiary phosphines. For example, 1,2-dibromoethane and Ph2PM react to give Ph2PCH2CH2PPh2. Weak acids such ammonium chloride, convert Ph2PM (M = Li, Na, K) into diphenylphosphine: :(C6H5)2PM + H2O ‚Üí (C6H5)2PH + MOH =Transition metal complexes= Triphenylphosphine binds well to most transition metals, especially those in the middle and late transition metals of groups 7‚Äì10. In terms of steric bulk, PPh3 has a Tolman cone angle of 145¬∞, which is intermediate between those of P(C6H11)3 (170¬∞) and P(CH3)3 (115¬∞). In an early application in homogeneous catalysis, NiBr2(PPh3)2 was used by Walter Reppe for the synthesis of acrylate esters from alkynes, carbon monoxide, and alcohols.* The use of PPh3 was popularized by its use in the hydroformylation catalyst RhH(PPh3)3(CO). Polymer-anchored PPh3 derivatives Polymeric analogues of PPh3 are known whereby polystyrene is modified with PPh2 groups at the para position. Such polymers can be employed in many of the applications used for PPh3 with the advantage that the polymer, being insoluble, can be separated from products by simple filtration of reaction slurries. Such polymers are prepared via treatment of 4-lithiophenyl- substituted polystyrene with chlorodiphenylphosphine (PPh2Cl).

To be awarded the rank, a Scout must lead in planning and doing two community service projects and earn a total of 23 merit badges consisting of 17 required merit badges and 2 specialist ratings (a specialist rating involves 3 related merit badges and a community service project). After achieving the rank of Eagle, a Scout may earn an Anahaw award for earning 2 additional specialist ratings. The term Eagle Scout, Eagle, or Agila is used to refer to a person who was given the award. The award's name was derived from the Eagle Scout awarded by the Boy Scouts of America (BSA). From 1923 to 1936 (when the Philippines was a protectorate of the United States), the BSA administered the Boy Scouts program in the Philippines through the Philippine Council, BSA. According to the BSP's Diamond Jubilee Yearbook from 1936 to September 1996 there are 121,369 Scouts awarded the highest rank by the Boy Scouts of the Philippines. The BSP's highest rank went through a number of name and requirement changes through the years after the Philippines gained its independence from the United States of America. * Eagle Scout (1936‚Äì1962) * Jos√© Rizal Scout (1962‚Äì1976) * Scout Citizen Award (1976‚Äì1994) * Eagle Scout (1994‚Äìpresent) All awardees are eligible for membership into the Eagle Scouts Organization of the Philippines, the fellowship and service association of all Eagle Scouts from the BSP and from the BSA having Filipino lineage and/or nationality and the National Eagle Scouts Association of the Philippines, the Premiere Honor Society of Eagle Scouts in the Philippines. Anahaw award The Anahaw Award is a metal Anahaw leaf that is pinned on the ribbon of the Eagle Scout Medal. The award is similar to the Boy Scouts of America's use of Eagle Palms for their Eagle Scout Award. The name derives from Anahaw, a Filipino common name of palm trees in the genus Livistona. After a Scout has earned the Eagle Scout Rank and before reaching the age of 17 years, he can go on to pursue the Anahaw Award. In addition to the 23 Merit Badges for the Eagle Scout Rank, the Anahaw Award may be granted as follows: * For any 2 additional Specialist Rating after earning the Eagle Scout Rank - Bronze Anahaw Award. * For any 2 additional Specialist Rating after earning the Bronze Anahaw Award - Silver Anahaw Award. * For any 2 additional Specialist Rating after earning the Silver Anahaw Award - Gold Anahaw Award. The Bronze Anahaw Award shall be given only after at least three-(3) months of active Scouting as an Eagle Scout. Subsequent Anahaw Awards may be made at intervals not less the four-(4) months of tenure following the conferment of an Anahaw Award of lower grade.

Raised in 1914 as part of the New Zealand Expeditionary Force, it was one of the first New Zealand units to sail for service overseas. The brigade was formed from three regiments ‚Äì the Auckland Mounted Rifles, the Canterbury Mounted Rifles, the Wellington Mounted Rifles ‚Äì and smaller support units. Altogether the brigade had an establishment of 1,940 men and 2,032 horses and by the end of the war over 17,700 men had served in the brigade. However, the entire brigade's dismounted rifle strength was the equivalent of only a battalion of infantry. By the end of 1914, the brigade had arrived in Egypt and was assigned to the New Zealand and Australian Division. Its first active service was, in a dismounted role, during the Gallipoli Campaign, where they fought against the forces of the Ottoman Turkish Empire. Seven months later, after the evacuation from Gallipoli, the brigade returned to Egypt, and in 1916, became part of the ANZAC Mounted Division. The brigade was then used in defence of the Suez Canal. Then following an abortive Turkish attack in the Sinai Desert, it took part in clearing the invaders from Egypt. Then in the next two years, it forced the Turkish forces out of Palestine, collectively known as the Sinai and Palestine Campaign. Following its successful conclusion in 1918, the brigade played a small part in the Egyptian Revolution of 1919, before being disbanded in June 1919. Background New Zealand Trooper, horse and equipment On 4 August 1914, the British Empire declared war on the German Empire. Two days later, to assist the war effort, New Zealand offered to send a New Zealand Expeditionary Force (NZEF) to fight alongside the British Army. That offer was accepted by the Imperial Cabinet and amongst the troops asked for was a mounted infantry brigade. Which became known as the New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade.Kinloch 2005, p.29 Being mounted infantry the brigade was expected to ride to the site of the battle, then dismounted and fight on foot, just like normal infantry.Kinloch 2005, p.31 The brigade's first commanding officer was Colonel Andrew Russell.Kinloch 2005, p.32 His command comprised a headquarters, three regiments, each with three squadrons, and support troops, formed from the New Zealand Territorial Force, The Territorial Force included a compulsory training system and the four New Zealand Military Districts were required to supply a mounted regiment for the NZEF. To meet that obligation the Territorial Force regiments, each provided a squadron, which kept their own regimental badges and traditions.Waite 1919, p.6 All together the brigade has an establishment of 1,940 men and 2,032 horses.Kinloch 2005, p.30 However the entire brigade only had a dismounted rifle strength the equivalent of an infantry battalion. Such was the nature of the fighting they were involved in, that by the end of the war over 17,700 men would serve in the brigade.Kinloch 2005, p.15 =Formation= Initially, in 1914, the brigade comprised a Brigade Headquarters, three mounted regiments, the Auckland Mounted Rifles, the Canterbury Mounted Rifles, the Wellington Mounted Rifles, and support units, from the New Zealand Engineers, a Field Ambulance and an Ammunition Subsection. New Zealand did not supply an artillery battery for the brigade, as it was always intended artillery would be provided by the British Army. Another regiment, the Otago Mounted Rifles, raised as a divisional cavalry regiment, was assigned to the brigade during the Gallipoli Campaign. Then in the early stages of the Sinai Campaign the Australian 5th Light Horse Regiment, for a time, replaced the Wellington Mounted Rifles.Powles 1928, p.106 In July 1916, the three regiments lost their machine-gun sections, which were amalgamated, to form the Brigade Machine-Gun Squadron.Luxford 1923, pp.178‚Äì179 =Training in New Zealand= In New Zealand, the brigade's reinforcements trained at Featherston Camp north east of Wellington where about 8,000 men were housed in nearly 300 buildings, including three billiard rooms, a post office, a cinema, sixteen dining halls, six cook-houses and stables for 500 horses. The training programme included eight weeks of dismounted drill, two weeks of shooting, eight weeks of mounted drill and lectures on sanitation, military law and discipline, animal management and stable duties. All mounted reinforcements had to pass confirmatory riding tests before being cleared to go overseas.Kinloch 2005 pp. 242‚Äì3 Once trained the men were sent to Sydney or Melbourne in Australia, where they embarked on Australian troopships bound for Suez.Kinloch 2005 p. 243 Egypt A little over two months after the declaration of war, in October 1914, the brigade sailed from New Zealand.Nicol 1921, p.12 Arriving in the Suez Canal on 3 December 1914, they disembarked at Alexandria two days later.Nicol 1921, p.20 Then entrained for Cairo, and established a camp in the western suburb of Zeitoun.Nicol 1921, p.21 The brigade was now assigned to the New Zealand and Australian Division, with the New Zealand Infantry Brigade, and two Australian brigades' the 1st Light Horse Brigade and the 4th Brigade.Waite 1919, p.40 On 18 December Egypt until then a Turkish province, came under the protection of the British Empire, and the Khedive was replaced by Prince Hussein Kamel Pasha, as the Sultan of Egypt. Three days after his coronation the brigade, in a display of strength, marched through Cairo.Waite 1919, pp.42‚Äì43 The brigade used their time training, which consisted of day and night marches through the desert, combined with rifle and machine-gun practice.Powles 1928, p.15 Culminating in a four-day exercise, in February, when they marched around each day.Powles 1928, p.17 In April the division's two infantry brigades were given orders to leave for a then-unknown destination.Powles 1928, p.27 Which was followed by the news of the Gallipoli landings. Then a week later the brigade was ordered to prepare to follow the rest of the division. However, they would leave their horses behind serving in a dismounted role.Powles 1928, p.28 Gallipoli ANZAC beach-head area defended by the brigade The brigade's transport ships arrived off Gallipoli on 12 May. The troops were kept on board until dark, then landed at Anzac Cove, camping that night on the beach.Wilkie 1924, p.15 The next day they took over the northern, No.4 Section, of the beachhead. Relieving the Royal Naval Brigade, on Walkers Ridge, brigade headquarters was set up on the highest point of the ridge, which became known as Russell's Top.Waite 1919, p.135 The Wellington Mounted Rifles were on the right, looking down into Monash Valley, the Auckland Mounted Rifles in the centre and the Canterbury Mounted rifles on their left, on the slopes down to the sea, with responsibility for the No.1 and No.2 Posts.Wilkie 1924, p.17 The No.2 Post was the beach-heads furthest north position, only from Chatham's Post the southernmost point.Waite 1919, p.136 The outlying position of the two posts meant that movement between them and the main lines, could only be done safely at night.Powles 1928, p.29 =Defence of Walker's Ridge= In May intelligence reports indicated that Turkish reinforcements were grouping around the ANZAC positions, preparing an attack.Waite 1919, p.138 Just after midnight 19 May, from No.2 Post to Chathams Post, the Turks opened fire with their small arms and artillery, and threw hand grenades at the ANZAC trenches. This continued until 03:30 when the Turkish infantry went over the top. In the brigade's sector their main effort fell on the Auckland Mounted Rifles. They held their fire until the Turks were around twenty yards (18 m) away. Then every weapon opened up, the machine-guns causing severe casualties amongst the attackers, who were forced to go to ground and take cover. At daybreak they Turks started to retire to their own lines leaving thousands of dead behind, 500 of them in front of the Auckland's positions.Nicol 1921, pp.44‚Äì45 The Canterbury Mounted Rifles defending in No.2 Post, then observed a Turkish force opposite Walker's Ridge, forming for another attack. One of their machine-guns catching them with enfilade fire, broke up the gathering and forced them to withdraw.Waite 1919, pp.141‚Äì142 The rest of the day was quiet, apart from both sides artillery, then on 20 May another Turkish attack began, but faltered in the face of the brigade's machine-gun fire and withdrew back to their own lines.Waite 1919, p.142 That afternoon white flags appeared above the Turkish trenches, and all the firing stopped. It appeared they wanted a truce to collect their wounded but instead started collecting arms and ammunition and bringing forward reinforcements. The brigade issued a warning that they would commence firing in ten minutes, and they returned to their trenches.Powles 1928, p.32 However an armistice was later agreed for the 24 May, between 07:30 and 16:30, so they could bury the dead. The Turkish troops, were also observed improving and constructing new trenches at the Nek, Baby 700, and further north on Battleship Hill and along the Sari Bair hills.Powles 1928, p.36 No. 3 Post with Chunuk Bair on the skyline =No.3 Post= On 27 May the brigade realised the Turks were building a new position, at the base of the foothills, around east of the No.2 Post and when completed it would be a danger to the New Zealand post. So it would have to be captured and the task was given to the 1st Squadron, Canterbury Mounted Rifles. The squadron assembled at No.2 Post and after dark, at 22:00, 28 May assaulted the position, and by 23:30 had forced the Turkish defenders to withdraw.Powles 1928, pp.36‚Äì37Nicol 1924, p.27 Once secured the 6th Squadron Wellington Mounted Rifles, carrying spades and picks to improve the defences, moved in to occupy the position. Now known as No.3 Post, the squadron was ordered to \\"hold the post till relieved\\". Digging through the night, at daybreak they had to stop and take cover when the post came under fire from the surrounding hills.Powles 1928, p.37 Unable to do anything but take cover all day, that night at 21:30 the 6th Squadron was relieved by the 9th Squadron Wellington Mounted Rifles. The squadron attempted to improve their defences, but thirty minutes later around 1,000 Turks had surrounded, and attacked the post and by 23:30 had cut the telephone wires to the rest of the brigade. The dead ground to their front meant the defenders had to expose themselves on the trench parapet to open fire, which for a time kept the attackers at bay. But the strength of the Turkish attack enabled them to advance to the edge of the New Zealander's trenches.Waite 1924, p.28 At midnight the 2nd Squadron Wellington Mounted Rifles, were sent forward to reinforce the position. But were unable to break through the Turkish lines and had to establish their own defensive position on the slopes between No.2 and No.3 Posts.Waite 1924, pp.28‚Äì29 At 03:00 the 9th Squadron, opened fire on and thwarted a Turkish assault building in the south of the post. Then thirty minutes later the Turks again attacked No.3 Post, with hand grenades and their small arms. However, the 2nd Squadron could now assist with covering fire, from their position.Waite 1924, p.29 At dawn one of the 2nd Squadron's troops, counter- attacked and cleared the Turks out of the trenches to the left of No.2 Post. At 06:30, using signal flags 9th Squadron re-established communications with brigade headquarters. Throughout the day both squadrons held their positions, but ammunition and supplies were running low. So the 6th Squadron Wellington Mounted Rifles was sent forward to join the 2nd Squadron, but in the face of the Turkish firepower, they could not advance any further. The Turkish, now estimated to number around 3,000 men, continued attacking all day to capture No.3 Post. At 19:10 the 9th Squadron reported they had lost the northern side of the post, which had been captured by the Turks. During the same time the 6th Squadron had managed to advance to within of the post. However, as it got dark the Turkish attacks petered out and at 22:30 the 10th Squadron and half of the 8th Squadron Canterbury Mounted Rifles managed to break through to No.3 Post and relieved the defenders. The Canterbury Mounted Rifles now occupied the post and fought off several Turkish attacks.Powles 1928, pp.37‚Äì38Waite 1924, pp.31‚Äì32 But events had convinced the high command that it was impossible to defend No.3 Post and it was abandoned the same night. The brigade's casualties, were forty-two dead and 109 wounded.Waite 1924, pp.32‚Äì33 On 28 May the Otago Mounted Rifles, which had been attached to the brigade, took over from the Canterbury Mounted Rifles in the front line.Powles 1928, p.40 Battle of Chunuk Bair locations =Chunuk Bair= The objective of the British August offensive was to seize Chunuk Bair, a high point in the Sari Bair mountain range. The New Zealand and Australian Division would provide the attacking force. The initial part of the attack was to clear the Turks from the foothills, which was given to the New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade, reinforced by a MƒÅori Pioneer Battalion.Powles 1928, p.45 The attack began over the night of 5/6 August the Auckland Mounted Rifles successfully captured the Old No.3 Post.Nicol 1921, p.75 To their left the Canterbury and Otago Mounted rifles without firing a shot, only using their bayonets, cleared the Chailak Dere valley, then advanced to Aghyl Dere in the north. Capturing Taylor's Hollow, Walden's Point, and finally Beauchop Hill.Powles 1928, pp.46‚Äì48 To the right the Wellington Mounted Rifles and the MƒÅoris captured Destroyer Ridge, and then scaled the north-east face of Table Top and at 22:55 attacked the Turks from the rear capturing the position.Wilkie 1924, pp.45‚Äì46 Wellington Mounted Rifles after Chunuk Bair The next day the Auckland and Canterbury Mounted Rifles, the New Zealand Infantry Brigade and two British battalions, were combined as No.1 Column commanded by Brigadier-General Francis Earl Johnston. The Column were to hold the ground already occupied and extend their lines to the south and east. When they reported to Johnstone at \\"Chailak Dere\\", where they ordered to hold the position \\"to the last man\\". All during the following day, the attacking Turks sky-lining themselves moving over the hill, becoming easy targets for the defenders, and were engaged with enfilade fire.Wilkie 1924, pp.51‚Äì55 Holding out until they were relived on 9 August, the brigade, which was understrength to start with, had virtually ceased to exist as a fighting unit. The Auckland Mounted Rifles only had sixty-six men from a strength of 310 all ranks that had started the battle. The Canterbury Mounted Rifles lost 105 men around forty percent of their strength.Powles 1928, p.54 The Wellington Mounted Rifles, had sixty-seven men left from 173 all ranks.Waite 1924, p.57 =Hill 60= Two weeks later the Canterbury and Otago Mounted Rifles were selected to take part in the next battle to capture Hill 60. At 15:30 21 August the battle began, the Canterbury Mounted Rifles charging straight at the hill suffered sixty percent casualties, among them their commanding officer. They did however succeed in capturing the Turkish trench, within fifteen minutes of going over the top. But on either side of them, the rest of the attack had failed, leaving the two regiments isolated from the rest of the force. By themselves, the two regiments did not have the manpower to continue the assault, so they were ordered to dig in and hold the position.Powles 1928, pp.56‚Äì57Waite 1919, p.252 Which they did until 23 August when they were relieved by the Auckland and Wellington Mounted Rifles.Powles 1928, p.59 Auckland Mounted Rifles after Hill 60 On 27 August a second attempt to capture Hill 60 began. At 17:00 the Auckland and Canterbury Mounted Rifles captured the Turkish front line. The Wellington and Otago Mounted Rifles following up, passed beyond them and captured the Turkish reserve line. On the other flanks the supporting assaults had failed, leaving the Wellington and Otago Mounted Rifles isolated on a narrow front. So the brigade consolidated the ground already captured and moved forward their machine-guns, to support the defence, the forward line of which only consisted of forty men. However, all four regiments suffered heavy casualties and had to fight off several counter-attacks. Until 29 August when they were relieved and moved to the rear.Nicol 1921, pp.81‚Äì84Wilkie 1924, pp.63‚Äì64 =Evacuation= In September the brigade, now only twenty officers and 229 other ranks, was relieved by the Australians and left the peninsula for the rest camp on the island of Lemnos, arriving at Moudros on 14 September.Waite 1919, p.261 While recuperating the survivors were joined by, thirty officers and 1,060 other ranks, replacements for their casualties.Waite 1919, p.266 On 10 November the brigade returned to Gallipoli,Wilkie 1924, p.68 Moving back into the front line, they were not involved in any more assaults. Then on 12 December orders for the evacuation were issued. The first men to leave were anyone with the slightest illness. Then one regiment or battalion from each brigade, the Auckland Mounted Rifles, were chosen, from the brigade.Waite 1919, p.280 This meant that the remainder had to extend their lines covering for them. The last men were due to leave over the night of 19/20 December.Powles 1928, pp.71‚Äì72 Each regiment was divided into three groups, the first group leaving at the 17:30 19 December, followed by the second smaller group at 21:35. The last group of men having to cover for the whole brigade kept up a steady rate of fire and moved their machine-guns around the position to support the deception that all defences were fully manned. The last group was also divided into three, the first of which left at 01:45 20 December. Followed by the next group who waited ten minutes then followed them and the last small group of men left at 02:05. Once on the evacuation beach, they boarded their transport ships they sailed back to Lemnos. Then on 22 December returned to Egypt, arriving at Alexandria on 26 December, and eventually arrived back at their old camp at Zeitoun.Powles 1928, pp.72‚Äì75 During the campaign 4,000 men served with the brigade and almost fifty percent of them, 727 dead and 1,239 wounded, became casualties. Sinai In January 1916, the brigade left Zeitoun and headed east camping that night beside the Great Bitter Lake on the Suez Canal. While here they conducted desert training and each squadron, in turn, was sent across the canal on reconnaissance patrols into the Sinai Desert. In February they carried out a dual role of manning trenches along the canal, dismounted, and doing long range mounted patrols into the Sinai.Briscoe Moore 1920, pp.18‚Äì19 Then in March, the brigade was assigned to the newly formed ANZAC Mounted Division, alongside the Australian 1st, 2nd and 3rd Light Horse Brigades.Gullett, p.57 Northern Sinai Desert =Katia= Without any notice at 20:30 23 April, the brigade was ordered to Kantara away on the Suez Canal. The reason was not then known, but it later transpired a Turkish force in the Sinai Desert had attacked British yeomanry positions at Katia and Oghratina.Powles 1928, pp.90‚Äì91 They reached Kantara at 07:00 and an hour later moved into the desert camping at Hill 70 for the night and sent out reconnaissance patrols into the desert and manned observation posts.Powles 1928, pp.92‚Äì93 Patrol activity was kept up, most of the time at troop strength, but some involved the complete brigade.Powles 1928, p.95 On 15 July 1916, the three mounted regiments lost their machine-gun sections, which were transferred to the newly formed brigade Machine-Gun Squadron. However, a shortage of equipment meant that they only had six of the newer Vickers machine guns and six older Maxim guns. Four days later, reconnaissance aircraft spotted a large Turkish force moving west across the desert.Powles 1928, p.103 =Romani= Mount Royston scene of the battle of Romani in 1916 =Abd= Four man mounted section, in action one man in four was assigned to hold their horses. =Magdhaba= Palestine =Rafa= =Gaza= =Beersheba= =Ayun Kara= =River Auja= Brigade headquarters outside Jaffa Jordan Valley Brigade crossing the River Jordan =Jericho= =Amman= =Es Salt= =Chaytor's Force= The Damieh bridge, captured by the brigade Post war The New Zealand Mounted Rifles were the probable main participants in the Surafand Massacre of Palestinian Arab civilians on 10 December 1918 in revenge for the murder of a New Zealand soldier and other previous incidents; some Australian and possibly British troops were also present.

The company was spun off from its former parent, Southern Company, on April 2, 2001. The company was merged into GenOn Energy on 3 December 2010. The company then became part of NRG Energy in December 2012.https://dealbook.nytimes.com/2012/07/22/nrg-energy-to-buy-genon- for-1-7-billion/ Mirant operated 13 plants in the states of California, Georgia, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, New York, and Virginia and has the capacity to generate approximately 10,300 MW of electricity. History =Southern beginnings and spinoff= Mirant began its corporate existence in 1981 as Southern Electric International (SEI), a small consulting division of Southern Company that provided engineering and technical services to industrial companies, domestic and international utilities. With the Energy Policy Act of 1992 deregulation arrived in the US electric power sector, and SEI ventured into global markets with the acquisition of a 50% stake in Freeport Power, a Bahamian utility. In the years to come, other acquisitions followed, notably the acquisition of a British distribution utility - South Western Electricity Board later renamed SWEB (now known as Western Power Distribution); a controlling interest in Hong Kong based Consolidated Electric Power of Asia (CEPA), a stake in a German utility BEWAG, controlling interest in Empresa Electrica del Norte Grande, S. A. (EDELNOR) in Chile, and a hydroelectric generating facility in Argentina known as Hydroelectrica Alicura; giving it worldwide business interests in the Caribbean, Asian, South American and European energy markets. On the domestic front the company forged a joint venture in 1999 with Houston-based Vastar Energy to create Southern Company Energy Marketing, an electricity and gas trading company. That same year the company also acquired power generation facilities in New England (Canal station, Martha's Vineyard Diesels, Kendall Station), New York (Lovett and Bowline stations), California (Pittsburg, Potrero and Contra Costa stations). That same year SEI was renamed Southern Energy, in keeping with the broader theme of the products and markets that it pursued. Soon afterwards, its biggest domestic acquisition till date came in December 2000 with the purchase of the Morgantown, Chalk Point, Dickerson and Potomac River power generating assets from Potomac Electric Power Company (PEPCO). After an initial public offering of Southern Energy common stock in the fall of 2000, parent Southern Company completely spun off its interests in Southern Energy in April 2001 and a new publicly listed entity named Mirant Corporation began trading on the New York Stock exchange with the ticker symbol MIR. Between 2000 and 2003, the company continued its expansion in the U.S. markets with the acquisition or greenfield development of various gas-fired power plants in markets like Nevada, Texas, Wisconsin, Indiana, Arkansas, Louisiana, Georgia and Florida. =2003 bankruptcy= Following the disruption to the independent power industry precipitated by the bankruptcy of Enron, on July 14, 2003, after months of attempting to restructure its debt, the company sought Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. The Mirant bankruptcy proceedings were unusual in that the court agreed to the appointment of a committee of equity holders. The usual reasoning is that if there is any positive equity in a company, the company should not be in Chapter 11‚Äîand if there isn't, there is no reason for a committee of people without such an interest. But the judge did find it sufficiently likely in Mirant that there would be equity interest after re- organization to create such a committee. Mirant's Morgantown Generating Station and the Governor Harry W. Nice Memorial Bridge In January 2006, Mirant emerged from bankruptcy and the company was relisted to the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol MIR. The equity holders from the pre-bankruptcy Mirant did retain a portion of the equity of the re-organized entity. Prior to the bankruptcy filing, Mirant had attempted to expand the Potrero plant, but neighborhood and community activists fought the proposal for five years and on March 2, 2006, the California Public Utilities Commission announced its rejection of Mirant's expansion plans. The plant was scheduled to be shut down sometime in 2007 in preparation for constructing a more modern replacement, but subsequently plans were scaled back and now call for the existing plant to simply be upgraded. In 2007, Mirant sold some gas-fired generating plants and its overseas power plants in the Philippines and in the Caribbean. =2010 Merger= On Sunday, April 11, 2010 Mirant announced it was merging with RRI Energy, a company formerly known as Reliant Energy. The merger, which was completed on December 3, 2010, resulted in a company known as GenOn Energy.

Efforts include providing artificial nesting structures and planting native trees, shrubs, and aquatic plants. *In 2004, Mirant's Canal generating plant (Sandwich, Massachusetts) became the first power plant in Massachusetts to reduce emissions as part of a new state effort to achieve the nation's toughest air emission standards for steam-electric plants. *The Potrero Generating Station in San Francisco is among the oldest electrical power facilities in California and located at the site of the first power station run by the company that eventually became Pacific Gas and Electric. It is now shut down. Controversy =Environmental record= Researchers at the University of Massachusetts Amherst identified Mirant as the 63rd-largest corporate producer of Air pollution in the United States, based on 2002 data, with roughly 19 million pounds of toxic chemicals released annually into the air.Political Economy Research Institute Toxic 100 (Study released May 11, 2006) retrieved 17 Aug 2007 Major pollutants indicated by the study include sulfuric acid, hydrochloric acid, and chromium compounds. =Chesapeake Climate Action Network blockade of Dickerson Power Plant= On November 10, 2004, a group of Chesapeake Climate Action Network activists, students, farmers, and religious officials held a protest against the coal-fired Dickerson Power Plant in Montgomery County, Maryland. During the protest, six people were arrested for trespassing on private property. The protestors called on the plant's owner, the Mirant Corporation, to stop opposing state and federal legislation against power plant pollution.Demonstrators Decry Mirant Corporation for Ignoring Public Health and Global Warming , Chesapeake Climate Action Network press release, November 10, 2004. =Tax issues= Mirant, which owns and operates two power plants in the Hudson Valley Region of New York State, failed to pay its property taxes in a dispute with tax authorities, claiming over- assessments by the Towns of Stony Point and Haverstraw New York, as well as the North Rockland School District. Under the terms of bankruptcy, Mirant held payment in excess of $180 million due this last several years while a settlement could be reached. This case, which has caused local residents to themselves file bankruptcy, cost the average taxpayer over $2000 in increased property taxes. The higher than average assessments paid to the local municipalities were part of a strategy used by the Consolidated Edison and Orange and Rockland Utilities, whose plants Mirant assumed after deregulation, to site their plants in the Hudson River Valley Area. Following proceedings in state court, a settlement was reached between Mirant and the towns in December 2006, with taxes based on lower assessed values of the two power plants. Federal Court Cases Local 369 of the Utility Workers Union of America (UWUA) recently succeeded in enforcing an arbitration award in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts. The court determined that Mirant did not have just cause to discharge two workers for viewing pornographic materials on a computer. Federal Judge Douglas P. Woodlock denied Mirant‚Äôs motion to vacate the award, and the union‚Äôs motion for judgment was granted.U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts. Mirant Canal, LLC v.

Styled as a folk tale, it tells a story of a left-handed arms craftsman from Tula (traditionally a center of the Russian armaments industry) who outperformed his English colleagues by providing a clockwork steel flea they'd made with horseshoes and inscriptions on them. Synopsis Tsar Alexander I of Russia, while visiting England with his servant the Cossack Platov, is shown a variety of modern inventions. Platov keeps insisting that things in Russia are much better (embarrassing a guide at one point when he finds something that appears well made that turns out to be a Russian gun), until they are shown a small mechanical flea. After his ascension the next tsar, Nicolas I, orders Platov (after he tries to hide the flea) to find someone to outperform the English who had created the clockwork steel flea (as small as a crumb, and the key to wind it up can only be seen through a microscope). Platov travels to Tula to find someone to better the English invention. Three gunsmiths agree to do the work and barricade themselves in a workshop. Villagers try to get them to come out in various ways (for example by yelling \\"fire\\"), but no one can get them to come out. When Platov arrives to check on their progress, he has some Cossacks try to open the workshop. They succeed in getting the roof to come off, but the crowd is disgusted when the trapped smell of body odor and metal work comes out of the workshop. The gunsmiths hand Platov the same flea he gave them and he curses them, believing that they have done absolutely nothing. He ends up dragging Lefty with him in order to have someone to answer for the failure. The flea is given to the czar, to whom Lefty explains that he needs to look closer and closer at the flea to see what they have achieved. He winds it up and finds that it doesn't move. He discovers that, without any microscopes (\\"We are poor people\\"), Lefty and his accomplices managed to put appropriately sized horseshoes (with the craftsmen's engraved signatures) on the flea (Lefty made the nails, which cannot be seen since they are so small), which amazes the Tsar and the English (even though the flea now cannot dance as it used to). Lefty then gets an invitation and travels to England to study the English way of life and technical accomplishments. The English hosts try to talk him into staying in England, but he feels homesick and returns to Russia at the earliest opportunity. On the way back, he engages in a drinking duel with an English sailor, arriving in Saint Petersburg. The sailor is treated well, but the authorities finding no identification on Lefty and believing him to be a common drunkard, send him off to die in a hospital for unknowns. The sailor, after sobering up, decides to find his new friend, and with the aid of Platov they locate him. While dying (his head is smashed from being thrown onto the pavement), he tells them to tell the Emperor to stop having his soldiers clean their muskets with crushed brick (after he sees a dirty gun in England and realizes it fires so well because they keep it oily). The message never arrives, however, because the man who had to inform the Emperor never does. Leskov comments that the Crimean War might have turned out differently if the message had been delivered. The story ends with Leskov commenting on the replacement of good, hard-earned labor and creativity with machines. Style This story is deeply embedded into Russian consciousness as an archetype of relationships between Russia and the West. The language of the story is unique; many of its folk-flavored neologisms and colloquialisms (many of them being replacements of borrowed non-Slavic words, very funny and natural, though mostly invented by Leskov) have become common sayings and proverbs. Both Slavophiles and Westernizers used the story in support of their views; indeed the story of Levsha may signify amazing Russian ingenuity and craftsmanship, it also exposes the Russian society which neglects most talented Russian people. Cultural influence In 1952, a ballet adaption was developed by Boris Alexandrovich Alexandrov and P. F. Abolimov. In order to maximize the ballet's patriotic message, the story was changed so that the flea keeps its leap and Lefty survives to return home to a love interest. The libretto was thought clumsy by the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party, however, and the ballet was only ever staged twice, in 1954 and 1976. In 1964, Soviet director Ivan Ivanov-Vano made an animated 42-minute-long film called Lefty (–õ–µ–≤—à–∞) that was based on the story. A live- action film The Left-Hander was made in 1986. This version is played several times a day at the Museum of Jurassic Technology. The book describes a microscope which can magnify up to five million times, The Tale of Cross-eyed Lefty from Tula and the Steel Flea, Chapter the fourteenth. \\"If you had a better microscope that could magnify five million times,\\" he said, \\"you would see that each gunsmith had put his name on the shoes he made so that you know which Russian craftsman made which shoe.\\"Google Books similar to actual microscopes that are now being used in nanotechnology. For this reason it is featured in a Nature Physics article from 2007.The dancing flea, nature.com In the Russian language, the hero's nickname, Levsha (Lefty), has become a reference to an exceptionally skilled common-folk craftsman, and the expression \\"to shoe a flea\\" has become an idiomatic phrase signifying a craftsman's feat.

The building is located at central campus, next to the College of Communication (COM) and across from the College of Arts and Sciences (CAS). Housing approximately 1800 students, it is the second-largest non-military dormitory in the country, behind Jester Center at The University of Texas at Austin. The closest MBTA stop is Boston University East on the Green Line B branch, located directly in front of B and C Towers, in a center reservation on Commonwealth Avenue. Name =Original name= Warren Towers Originally, the building‚Äôs name was simply \\"700\\", in reference to its 700 Commonwealth Avenue address. Its three towers were simply called, from east to west (left to right in the above photo), A Tower, B Tower, and C Tower. The building was first occupied in 1966; residents lived in A and B Towers while construction of C Tower was completed (this fact gave birth to the student \\"legend\\" that C Tower was constructed of spare parts from A and B towers). The third tower was completed and occupied in 1967. =Renaming= In 1976 the building was rechristened \\"Warren Towers\\" as a tribute to three generations of the Warren family at Boston University: William Fairfield Warren (the University's first president), William Marshall Warren (a Dean of the College of Arts and Sciences; son of William Fairfield Warren), and Shields Warren (a famous physician; son of William Marshall Warren and grandson of William Fairfield Warren). Additionally, each tower was renamed in honor of one of the men; A Tower is now \\"Fairfield Tower\\", B Tower is \\"Marshall Tower\\", and C Tower is \\"Shields Tower\\". Bronze plaques in the main lobby commemorate the three men. Although these are the formal names of the towers, it is rare to hear anyone refer to them in this way; the A/B/C convention is far more popular. Gender segregation The facility opened before the introduction of coeducational housing at BU, and as such A and B Towers housed women, and C Tower men. This reflected the high female-to-male ratio, a statistic that BU is still known for today. Although the building is now coeducational, some floors remain exclusively female. When in use by the university's summer programs (Academy of Media Production, High School Honors, Summer Challenge, Upward Bound, Upward Bound Math Science, Visual Arts‚Äô Summer Institute, Summer Theatre Institute, Program in Mathematics for Young Scientists), one tower is exclusively male, while a second is exclusively female. Layout Warren Towers rises over the Charles River. Warren Towers, 18 stories in height, is the largest dormitory on the Boston University campus. Its three towers sit atop a four-story base structure. The first three floors (and a basement) are a university parking facility; the fourth floor contains the dorm's lobby, dining hall, and other amenities including study lounges and laundry rooms. Each of the tower's 14 residential floors house approximately 40 residents, including the Resident Assistant (RA). Most floors are divided into 18 doubles, four singles (including one for the RA), and a quad, though there are exceptions to this. For example, some floors in C Tower are home to faculty- in-residence, for whom small apartments have been created from the existing floor plan. Almost all floors have two shared bathrooms (one for each sex), though some single sex floors have a single bathroom. In addition, all floors have a common room, except floors 5A and 5B, where a small laundry room is provided, and floor 17 of tower B, which is a boiler room for the facility. Like other campus housing facilities throughout campus, some floors are designated for certain schools. For example, the 11th and 14th floors of C Tower house only communication students. Retail space Originally the building presented one long blank wall along the 700 block of Commonwealth Avenue, with the exception of the plate-glass entryway leading to the escalator banks. One of the initiatives undertaken early in the tenure of President John Silber was to carve retail space out of the building at street level, to generate income. Today retail establishments accessible at street- level include Bank of America and Citizens Bank ATMs, Subway, Starbucks, a City Convenience store, a FedEx Kinko's outlet, and Jamba Juice. A Taco Bell closed in April 2008. In the 1980s, retail tenants included Rumple's (a full- service restaurant; this space later became a Taco Bell); Nikki's sandwich shop (immediately west of the escalator entrance for the dormitory); and a Store 24 convenience store, which later converted to a university-owned \\"Campus Convenience\\" store. Parking Despite the ample parking space afforded by the multileveled garage in the lower section of the building, student parking is not permitted. The exception to this is for a short time around move-in and move-out periods when parking is free and the elevator banks are permitted to drop to the third floor of the garage, bypassing security and easing the moving experience.

A xenon arc lamp is a highly specialized type of gas discharge lamp, an electric light that produces light by passing electricity through ionized xenon gas at high pressure. It produces a bright white light that closely mimics natural sunlight, with applications in movie projectors in theaters, in searchlights, and for specialized uses in industry and research to simulate sunlight, often for product testing. Xenon headlamps in automobiles are actually metal-halide lamps, where a xenon arc is only used during start-up to correct the color temperature. Types Xenon arc lamps can be roughly divided into three categories: continuous-output xenon short-arc lamps, continuous-output xenon long-arc lamps, and xenon flash lamps (which are usually considered separately). Each consists of a fused quartz or other heat resistant glass arc tube, with a tungsten metal electrode at each end. The glass tube is first evacuated and then re-filled with xenon gas. For xenon flashtubes, a third \\"trigger\\" electrode usually surrounds the exterior of the arc tube. The lifetime of a xenon arc lamp varies according to its design and power consumption, with a major manufacturer quoting average lifetimes ranging from 500 hours (7kW) to 1,500 (1kW).  History  An Osram 100 W xenon/mercury short-arc lamp in reflector Interest in the xenon discharge was first aroused by P. Schulz in 1944, following his discovery of its near-continuous spectrum and high colour rendering white light.Edelgasb√∂gen, P.Schulz, Reichsbericht f.Physik, Vol.1 (1944) p147 Owing to wartime limitations on the availability of this noble gas, significant progress was not made until John Aldington of the British Siemens lamp company published his research in 1949.Gas Arcs, J.N. Aldington, Transactions of the Illuminating Engineering Society of London, Vol.14 (1949) pp19-51. This triggered intensive efforts at the German Osram company to further develop the technology as a replacement for carbon arcs in cinema projection. The first successful public projection using xenon light was performed on 30 October 1950, when excerpts from a colour film (Das Schwarzwaldm√§del) were shown during the 216th session of the German Cinematographic Society in Berlin.Die Neuen Xenon-Hochdrucklampen, K. Ittig, K. Larch√©, F. Michalk, Technisch-wissenschaftliche Abhandlungen der Osram- Gesellchaft, Vol.6 (1953) pp33-38. The technology was commercially introduced by German Osram in 1952.Technik der Spezial-Entladungslampen, publ. Osram GmbH 1989, p24. First produced in the 2 kW size (XBO2001), these lamps saw wide use in movie projection, where they replaced the older, more labor-intensive (to operate) carbon arc lamps.  Modern Usage  The white continuous light generated by the xenon arc is spectrally similar to daylight, but the lamp has a rather low efficacy in terms of lumens of visible light output per watt of input power. Today, almost all movie projectors in theaters employ these lamps, with power ratings ranging from 900 watts up to 12 kW. Omnimax (Imax Dome) projection systems use single xenon lamps with ratings as high as 15 kW. As of 2016, laser illumination for digital theater projectors is starting to establish a market presence and has been predicted to supersede the xenon arc lamp for this application. The very small size of the arc makes it possible to focus the light from the lamp with moderate precision. For this reason, xenon arc lamps of smaller sizes, down to 10 watts, are used in optics and in precision illumination for microscopes and other instruments, although in modern times they are being displaced by single mode laser diodes and white light supercontinuum lasers which can produce a truly diffraction-limited spot. Larger lamps are employed in searchlights where narrow beams of light are generated, or in film production lighting where daylight simulation is required. All xenon short-arc lamps generate substantial ultraviolet radiation. Xenon has strong spectral lines in the UV bands, and these readily pass through the fused quartz lamp envelope. Unlike the borosilicate glass used in standard lamps, fused quartz readily passes UV radiation unless it is specially doped. The UV radiation released by a short-arc lamp can cause a secondary problem of ozone generation. The UV radiation strikes oxygen molecules in the air surrounding the lamp, causing them to ionize. Some of the ionized molecules then recombine as O3, ozone. Equipment that uses short-arc lamps as the light source must contain UV radiation and prevent ozone build- up. Many lamps have a shortwave UV blocking coating on the envelope and are sold as \\"ozone free\\" lamps. These \\"ozone free\\" lamps are used commonly in indoor applications, where proper ventilation is not easily accessible. The company WACOM has also a long history of xenon lamp production. Some lamps have envelopes made out of ultra-pure synthetic fused silica (such as \\"Suprasil\\"), which roughly doubles the cost, but which allows them to emit useful light into the vacuum UV region. These lamps are normally operated in a pure nitrogen atmosphere.  Lamp construction  An end-view of a 15 kW IMAX lamp showing the liquid-cooling ports All modern xenon short-arc lamps use a fused quartz envelope with thoriated tungsten electrodes. Fused quartz is the only economically feasible material currently available that can withstand the high pressure (25 atmospheres for an IMAX bulb) and high temperature present in an operating lamp, while still being optically clear. The thorium dopant in the electrodes greatly enhances their electron emission characteristics. Because tungsten and quartz have different coefficients of thermal expansion, the tungsten electrodes are welded to strips of pure molybdenum metal or Invar alloy, which are then melted into the quartz to form the envelope seal. Because of the very high power levels involved, large lamps are water-cooled. In those used in IMAX projectors, the electrode bodies are made from solid Invar and tipped with thoriated tungsten. An O-ring seals the tube, so that the naked electrodes do not contact the water. In low power applications the electrodes are too cold for efficient electron emission and are not cooled. In high power applications an additional water cooling circuit for each electrode is necessary. To reduce cost, the water circuits are often not separated and the water needs to be deionized to make it electrically non-conductive, which lets the quartz or some laser media dissolve into the water. Perspective view of 3 kW lamp showing plastic safety shield used during shipping. To achieve maximum efficiency, the xenon gas inside short-arc lamps is maintained at an extremely high pressure ‚Äî up to 30 atmospheres (440 psi / 3040 kPa) ‚Äî which poses safety concerns. If a lamp is dropped or ruptures while in service, pieces of the lamp envelope can be thrown at high speed. To mitigate this, large xenon short-arc lamps are normally shipped in protective shields, which will contain the envelope fragments should breakage occur. Normally, the shield is removed once the lamp is installed in the lamp housing. When the lamp reaches the end of its useful life, the protective shield is put back on the lamp, and the spent lamp is then removed from the equipment and discarded. As lamps age, the risk of failure increases, so bulbs being replaced are at the greatest risk of explosion. Lamp manufacturers recommend the use of eye protection when handling xenon short-arc lamps. Some lamps, especially those used in IMAX projectors, require the use of full-body protective clothing.  Light generation mechanism  Output profile of a xenon arc lamp. Xenon short- arc lamps come in two distinct varieties: pure xenon, which contains only xenon gas; and xenon-mercury, which contains xenon gas and a small amount of mercury metal. =Pure xenon= In a pure xenon lamp, the majority of the light is generated within a tiny, pinpoint-sized cloud of plasma situated where the electron stream leaves the face of the cathode. The light generation volume is cone-shaped, and the luminous intensity falls off exponentially moving from cathode to anode. Electrons passing through the plasma cloud strike the anode, causing it to heat. As a result, the anode in a xenon short- arc lamp either has to be much larger than the cathode or be water-cooled, to dissipate the heat. The output of a pure xenon short-arc lamp offers fairly continuous spectral power distribution with a color temperature of about 6200K and color rendering index close to 100. However, even in a high pressure lamp there are some very strong emission lines in the near infrared, roughly in the region from 850‚Äì900 nm. This spectral region can contain about 10% of the total emitted light. Light intensity ranges from 20,000 to 500,000 cd/cm2. An example is the \\"XBO lamp\\", which is an OSRAM trade name for a pure xenon short-arc lamp. For some applications such as endoscopy and dental technology light guide systems are included. =Xenon-mercury= A xenon arc lamp (Osram XBO 4000W). As in a pure xenon lamp, the majority of the light produced radiates from a pinpoint-sized cloud of plasma near the face of the cathode. However, the plasma cloud in a xenon-mercury lamp is often smaller than that of a pure xenon lamp of equivalent size, due to the electron stream losing its energy more rapidly to the heavier mercury atoms. Xenon-mercury short-arc lamps have a bluish-white spectrum and extremely high UV output. These lamps are used primarily for UV curing applications, sterilizing objects, and generating ozone.  Ceramic xenon lamps  A Cermax 2 kW xenon lamp from a video projector. A pair of heatsinks are clamped on the two metal bands around the perimeter, which also double to supply power to the lamp's electrodes. Xenon short-arc lamps also are manufactured with a ceramic body and an integral reflector. They are available in many output power ratings with either UV-transmitting or blocking windows. The reflector options are parabolic (for collimated light) or elliptical (for focused light). They are used in a wide variety of applications, such as video projectors, fiber optic illuminators, endoscope and headlamp lighting, dental lighting, and search lights. Power supply requirements A 1 kW xenon short-arc lamp power supply with the cover removed. Xenon short-arc lamps have a negative temperature coefficient like other gas discharge lamps. They are operated at low-voltage, high-current, DC and started with a high voltage pulse of 20 to 50kV. As an example, a 450 W lamp operates normally at 18 V and 25 A once started. They are also inherently unstable, prone to phenomena such as plasma oscillation and thermal runaway. Because of these characteristics, xenon short-arc lamps require a proper power supply that operates without flickering in the flame, which could ultimately damage the electrodes. Automotive headlamps In 1991 \\"xenon headlamps\\" were introduced for vehicles (BMW E32). These are actually metal-halide lamps; the xenon gas is used only to provide some light immediately upon lamp startup, as required for safety in an automotive headlamp application. Full intensity is reached 20 to 30 seconds later once the salts of sodium and scandium are vaporized by the heat of the xenon arc. The lamp envelope is small and the arc spans only a few millimetres. An outer hard glass tube blocks the escape of ultraviolet radiation that would tend to damage plastic headlamp components. The first xenon headlamps contained mercury; newer types do not. Xenon long-arc-lamps These are structurally similar to short-arc lamps except that the distance between the electrodes in glass tube is greatly elongated. When mounted within an elliptical reflector, these lamps are frequently used to simulate sunlight in brief flashes, often for photography. Typical uses include solar cell testing (with the use of optical filters), solar simulation for age testing of materials, rapid thermal processing, material inspection and sintering. Though not commonly known outside of Russia and the former Soviet satellite countries, long arc xenon lamps were used for general illumination of large areas such as rail stations, sports arenas, mining operations, and nuclear power plant high bay spaces. These lamps, –õ–∞–º–ø–∞ –∫—Å–µ–Ω–æ–Ω–æ–≤–∞—è –î–ö–°–¢, literally \\"lamp xenon DKST\\" were characterized by high wattages ranging from 2kW to 100 kW. The lamps operated in a peculiar discharge regime where the plasma was thermalized, that is, the electrons were not significantly hotter than the gas itself. Under these conditions a positive current-voltage curve was demonstrated. This allowed the larger common sizes such as 5 and 10kW to operate directly from mains AC at 110 and 220 volts respectively without a ballast ‚Äì only a series igniter was necessary to start the arc. The lamps produced around 30 lumens/watt, which is about double the efficiency of the tungsten incandescent lamp, but less than more modern sources such as metal halide. They had the advantage of no mercury content, convective air cooling, no high pressure rupture risk, and nearly perfect color rendition. Due to low efficiency and competition from more common lamp types, few installations remain today, but where they do, they can be recognized by a characteristic rectangular/elliptical reflector, and crisp blue-white light from a relatively long tubular source.

He became an influential spokesman for Aboriginal social justice and an important informant on Wurundjeri cultural lore. Biography Barak was born in 1824 at Brushy Creek near present-day Wonga Park at the Barngeong Birthing Site, in the country of the Wurundjeri people. His mother, Tooterrie, came from the Nourailum bulluk at Murchison, Victoria. His father, Bebejern, was an important member of the Wurundjeri clan. Barak was said to have been present as a boy when John Batman met with the tribal elders to \\"purchase\\" the Melbourne area in 1835. Before he died he described witnessing the signing of the treaty in a ceremony he called a tanderem. Ninggalobin, Poleorong and Billibellary were the leading song makers and principal Wurundjeri leaders in the Melbourne region. European colonisation had caused disruptions to initiation ceremonies. In response these three men gathered at South Yarra in the late 1830s and inducted the young Barak into Aboriginal lore. This entailed formally presenting him with the symbols of manhood: strips of possum skin tied around his biceps; the gombert (reed necklace) around his neck; given his ilbi-jerri, a sharp and narrow bone or nose-peg; and his branjep, the apron worn by men to cover their genitals. At the end of the ceremony Barak presented his uncle, Billibellary, a possumskin cloak.Isabel Ellender and Peter Christiansen, pp52, People of the Merri Merri. The Wurundjeri in Colonial Days, Merri Creek Management Committee, 2001 Barak attended the government's Yarra Mission School from 1837 to 1839. When he joined the Native Mounted Police in 1844, he was given the name of William Barak. He was Police Trooper No.19. In early 1863, Barak moved to Coranderrk Station, near Healesville, Victoria with about thirty others. Upon the death of Simon Wonga in 1875, Barak became the Ngurungaeta of the clan. He worked tirelessly for his people and was a successful negotiator on their behalf. He was a highly respected man and leader, with standing amongst the Indigenous people and the European settlers. Barak died at Coranderrk in 1903 and is buried at the Coranderrk cemetery. He was about 85 years old.  Legacy  Figures in left Barak drawing a corroboree Barak is remembered for his artworks, which show both traditional Indigenous life and encounters with Europeans. Most of Barak's drawings were completed at Coranderrk during the 1880s and 1890s. They are now highly prized and exhibited in leading public galleries in Australia. His work is on permanent display in the National Gallery of Victoria Ian Potter Centre at Federation Square, Melbourne. Ceremony (1895) is housed at the Ballarat Fine Art Gallery. In 2003 the National Gallery of Victoria held an exhibition Remembering Barak to commemorate his life and work. An education resource was developed to accompany the exhibition. In 2004 Nillumbik Shire Council registered the place name Barak Bushlands, previously known as the Falkiner Street Reserve, along the Diamond Creek in Eltham. In 2005 a 525-metre footbridge called the \\"William Barak bridge\\" was constructed stretching from Birrarung Marr to the MCG, improving the link between some of Melbourne's biggest sports and entertainment venues and the heart of the CBD. In 2006 a permanent sound installation called \\"Proximities\\" was installed on the bridge. It was designed by David Chesworth and Sonia Leber. Its central section features a welcome song sung in Woiwurrung by Wurundjeri Elder, and Barak's descendant, Joy Murphy Wandin. In 2011 Barak was inducted on to the Victorian Aboriginal Heritage Roll.Barak's grave and headstone at Coranderrk cemetery In 2015 a 279-foot-tall (85-metre-tall) image of Barak was used to form the facade of an apartment building called Swanston Square in Melbourne, Australia.

Series history When Penn State joined the Big Ten Conference in 1993, the Nittany Lions and Spartans were designated as permanent rivals, and met each other for the trophy in the last week of conference play. The trophy, designed by former Michigan State coach George Perles, features pictures of Penn State's Old Main and Michigan State's Beaumont Tower, as well as figurines of The Spartan and Nittany Lion Shrine statues. The trophy is infamous for its unwieldiness and hodgepodge appearance. On September 24, 2005 during Michigan week, a couple of Penn State students brazenly defaced the newly installed bronze Sparty statue. ‚ÄúIt happened during broad daylight, with people all around‚Äù according to MSU police Sgt. Randy Holton. The statue was splattered with blue paint and the base tagged with the letters PSU. The perpetrators were able to evade capture despite the incident occurring in the middle of the day, during the traditional period of time when the statue is guarded by MSU student employees and Spartan Marching Band members, in what is called Sparty Watch. In 2011, Nebraska joined the Big Ten, and the conference split into two divisions. Michigan State was in the Legends division and Penn State was in the Leaders division, so they no longer played each other annually. Instead, Indiana and Nebraska were designated as Michigan State and Penn State's permanent rivals, respectively. Under this setup, Penn State and Michigan State would compete on average two out of every five years,\\"Big Ten Schools to Play Nine Conference Games Beginning With 2017 Season\\" , Big Ten, August 4, 2011.

They may focus on special genres of literature, including science fiction and mystery. Some litbloggers prefer an objective or formal tone, while others are more conversational. Many litblogs feature reviews of books which may or may not be featured in the mainstream press. Some litblogs feature critiques of reviews in the mainstream press. Interviews with authors are another common feature. Litblogs can also be used as virtual reading groups for focused discussion on a specific piece or pieces of literature, with some litblogs following a particular piece of literature through an entire reading, and others reprinting diaries or letters from authors. Some litblogs are resources for information about the publishing industry, publicity, or writing craft. Many litblogs have one author, but collaborative blogs have many authors, one of whom may serve as the primary author overseeing contributors. There are also collaborative blogs focussing on significant international or national literary awards such as Read the Nobels and The Complete Booker where contributors share reviews of winning and shortlisted titles, information about award-winning authors or the history of the award. These are sometimes associated with so-called 'reading challenges' but they can become a useful repository of commentary about award winners and their books over time, especially in the case of less well-known authors. Other collaborative blogs include those focusing on the work of a single notable author such as La Comedie Humaine where members share their summaries and reviews as well as information about the French author, Honor√© de Balzac.

The blog's owner, Doug Bassett, is interested in bestsellers of the past, \\"partly because there seems to be a real dearth of information on these authors, partly because I'm interested in what books become popular, what these authors share (or don't share).\\" Bilingual literary bloggers include Book Around the Corner (France, written in English), Iris on Books (Holland, in English), Beauty is a Sleeping Cat (Switzerland, in English), Caravana de Recuerdos (bilingual Spanish/English). Some litblogs are profitable businesses while others are not run for profit. Some authors of litblogs are professional writers, academics, literature enthusiasts or industry professionals. Others are simply people who enjoy writing about books. In the democratic forum of the blogosphere, these groups can interact by reading and commenting on one another's posts. Increasingly newspapers and magazines are also creating litblogs. Dwight Garner of the New York Times Book Review writes a litblog called Paper Cuts that is hosted by the newspaper. The Guardian allows authors to chime in on books and current publishing gossip at a feature called Comment is free. Litblogs can also serve as adjuncts to literary journals or organizations, such as those of 3:AM Magazine, Inside Higher Ed, Spike Magazine, The Virginia Quarterly Review, and the Poetry Foundation. The National Book Critics Circle has its own litblog called Critical Mass that posts commentary that is very critical of nonprofessional litbloggers. LitBloggers have also entered the Literary Prize scene by hosting what are called Shadow Literary Prizes, which have no monetary value but offer valuable international publicity to the long and short-listed books, and provide an archive of reviews of the titles, since all the longlisted titles are reviewed by at least one member of the Shadow Jury, and all the shortlisted titles are reviewed by all members. The Shadow Giller Prize, founded in 1995, was the first of these Shadow Literary Prizes. Its origins were the inaugural Shadow Giller Lunch of literary critics and people in the publishing industry in 1995, but the concept migrated to the web in 2009. Coordinated by Kevin From Canada, who convenes a 'jury' each year, the Shadow Giller Prize Jury by consensus awards its own Shadow Prize to the book the jury prefers . In 2011, The Shadow Man Asian Literary Prize began : modelled on the Shadow Giller and coordinated by ANZ LitLovers in Australia , it also has an international jury of bloggers who commit to the same principle: to criticize a prize, a Shadow Literary Prize Jury makes its choice before the Real Jury makes its announcement.  Professional  Professional critics have litblogs at House of Mirth, About Last Night, Inside Higher Ed, The Dizzies, and more. In addition, the litbloggers from The Elegant Variation, Laila Lalami, The Old Hag, Maud Newton, Return of the Reluctant, Bookslut, Ready Steady Book, The Reading Experience, and Sarah Weinman are a few of the bloggers writing book reviews and criticism for major newspapers and magazines. The National Book Critics Circle has its own litblog called Critical Mass that posts commentary that is very critical of nonprofessional litbloggers. Litblogger Scott Esposito also established The Quarterly Conversation, a quarterly online publication featuring lengthy literary essays. Some litbloggers, including Laila Lalami and Mark Sarvas of The Elegant Variation, are also literary fiction authors. Many published authors have also started blogs. Some of these bloggers are Neil Gaiman, Alison Bechdel, and Cory Doctorow of the popular blog Boing Boing. Writers of young adult fiction increasingly are blogging as well. Some of these bloggers are Neil Gaiman, Holly Black, Justine Larbalestier, and Scott Westerfeld. Group litblogs continue to diversify. A group of academics runs a litblog called The Valve. The Litblog Co-op (disbanded) was a group of 20 litbloggers who voted to collectively recommend a book every three months. In the UK, six leading litblogs joined forces to create Britlitblogs.com. There have been blogs devoted to one book, like William T. Vollmann's Rising Up and Rising Down, and blogs that have reprinted the entire contents of Samuel Pepys' Diary and Franz Kafka's diary. Today in Letters provided letters and diary entries from each day in literary history. Making Light, John Scalzi, and Miss Snark (the latter now defunct) are written by professionals in the industry who have insights for writers. Flogging the Quill is a litblog about the craft of writing. Book Tour is a litblog creation of Virtual Book Tour founder Kevin Smokler, and Chris Anderson (author of The Long Tail. Buzz, Balls & Hype is devoted to the creation of buzz for writers. Edward Champion from Reluctant Habits has an author interview podcast series called The Bat Segundo Show.  Kidlitosphere  Recently children's literary bloggers have organized together and brought about an entity best known as the Kidlitosphere. These bloggers include professional reviewers, booksellers, librarians, parents, homeschoolers, authors, illustrators, and anyone else concerned in the field. Some blog professionally for the online editions of print journals, like A Fuse#8 Production on School Library Journal and ShelfTalker on Publishers Weekly. Others do a regular series of interviews and reviews, including Seven Impossible Things Before Breakfast, Big A little a, and bookshelves of doom. The Kidlitosphere has its own literary award it hands out once a year called The Cybils Award. They also meet once a year in October for a yearly conference.

Early life Peter McIntyre was born in Dunedin on 4 July 1910, the son of Peter McIntyre, an emigrant from Scotland, and his wife, Isabella Edith Cubitt. His father was a co-founder of the Caxton Printing Company and was well known for his lithographic work. He also worked as a cartoonist for the Otago Daily News. He was educated at Otago Boys' High School and, encouraged by his father, received instruction in art from Alfred O‚ÄôKeeffe, a local artist, executing several works for family and friends. After completing his schooling, he then went onto the University of Otago, intending to study journalism. However, by 1931, McIntyre had decided to pursue art studies and abandoned his courses in New Zealand. London McIntyre went to London where he attended the Slade School of Fine Art, studying for a Bachelor of Fine Arts. He enjoyed life in London, mixing with fellow students and attending exhibitions. Despite limited income, he often travelled to mainland Europe and painted scenes in France, Germany, Italy and Spain. In 1934, his final year of studies at Slade, he won prizes in composition and figure drawing. Following his graduation, McIntyre remained in England, working as a free-lance commercial artist. His work was varied; he did artwork for theatre productions, murals for restaurants, and serials for woman's magazines. He also did his own contemporary work in modern styles such as French cubism and English avant-garde. In 1937, he married an Englishwoman, Lillian , herself a painter in addition to being a model. Second World War On the outbreak of the Second World War, McIntyre attempted to enlist in the British Army but was declined. He soon found out that New Zealand expatriates were able to join a section of the 2nd New Zealand Expeditionary Force (2NZEF) that was being raised in London. He promptly enlisted, an act that he did not consider to be particularly patriotic but motivated more by self-defence against a fascist threat. The London section of the 2NZEF became the 34th Anti-tank Battery which received its training at Aldershot. In April 1940, the unit left England for Egypt, where it was initially based at Maadi Camp, on the outskirts of Cairo, and attached to the 2nd New Zealand Division. While in Egypt, McIntyre's artistic skills were soon recognised. He provided drawings for Parade, a military magazine and was invited to prepare artwork to form the basis of a security poster. The artwork was later used for a postcard and McIntyre also worked on the divisional Christmas card. On his own time, he also executed landscapes and portraits of fellow soldiers of the 2NZEF. His skills soon saw him transferred to the draughting office at the headquarters of the 2nd New Zealand Division, preparing maps and drawings of Italian defensive positions based on aerial photographs. His workspace was surrounded by some of his own artwork which soon attracted the attention of the division's commander, Major General Bernard Freyberg. For some time, the New Zealand Government had been considering appointing an official war artist to record the exploits of its men at war but was yet to make a commitment. In January 1941, Freyberg, tiring of the lengthy appointment process, selected McIntyre as the official New Zealand war artist, promoting him to lieutenant at the same time. =War artist= In his new role, it was proposed that McIntyre would execute portraits of decorated soldiers, battle scenes, and a series on the life of a New Zealand soldier, both in the frontlines and in the rear areas. McIntyre's first orders from Freyberg were to paint portraits of the brigadiers of the 2nd New Zealand Division, a task of which he soon tired. However, he soon found that Freyberg allowed him plenty of leeway in what was to be produced. McIntyre's depiction of the airborne attack by German forces at Canea, a city on Crete When the 2nd New Zealand Division was sent to Greece, as one of a number of Allied units dispatched to support the country in early March 1941 in anticipation of an invasion by Germany, McIntyre was ordered to remain in Egypt. Following the disastrous Allied campaign in Greece, the division was evacuated to Crete. He petitioned Freyberg for permission to be sent there, was successful, and arrived in Crete on 14 May. His first task was to paint a portrait of the King of Greece, who had been evacuated to the island. McIntyre was present during the airborne invasion of 20 May 1941 and it was at this time that he began to establish his methods for capturing events as they unfolded before him. He would work relatively close to the frontlines, executing sketches from which he would later work up paintings. In doing so, he moved away from his avant-garde influenced style and developed a romantic realism in his work. From the fighting in Crete, McIntyre produced a number of notable works; landings of Fallschirmj√§ger (paratroopers), bombing of divisional field hospitals, and crashed German gliders. The latter images features German war dead; he did not depict New Zealand dead although he would show wounded. On returning to Egypt after the division had been evacuated from Crete at the end of May, several of McIntyre's works were published in Parade magazine. He was not able to bring with him all his paintings; some of the larger watercolours had to be abandoned in Crete. In Egypt, McIntyre's initial focus was converting the many sketches he had made on Crete into proper paintings. Impressed by the output, Freyberg promoted him to captain. The first exhibition of his work was held in Cairo in July 1941 and some of his work was also used to illustrate an article in the Illustrated London News later in the year. The 2nd New Zealand Division was in the process of being rebuilt following the campaigns in Greece and Crete and McIntyre captured aspects of this process; he depicted many scenes of camp life and the daily activities. When authorities announced the award of the Victoria Cross to Lieutenant Charles Upham of the 20th Battalion, McIntyre was instructed to undertake a portrait of him. When the division moved to the frontlines to participate in Operation Crusader, McIntyre went with it, sketching battle scenes and depictions of New Zealanders on the move. He was among those that was able to get into Tobruk and once there made several sketches and paintings of the besieged port. Another exhibition of his work was held in Cairo in April 1942, which was well received. McIntyre also spent time with the Long Range Desert Group, which had many New Zealanders serving with it. He would produce several works from this experience. In 1943, selected pieces of McIntyre's art work was used by the New Zealand publishing company A.H. Reed Limited, to illustrate Passage to Tobruk, a memoir by Francis Jackson that was published under Reed's Raupo imprint. At the end of the war, he had been promoted to major. Return to New Zealand Returning to Dunedin in February 1946, McIntyre set up a studio on the city's Princes Street. He worked fulltime on commissioned portraits and landscapes. He had planned on establishing a school for the arts beginning with the development of a community of likeminded artists. However, this proved to be a challenge as he found the local art scene to be amateurish. In early 1949, his marriage to Lillian McIntyre ended in divorce and he promptly remarried. He and his new wife, Patricia and moved to Wellington, where he based himself in Mount Victoria. He was a professional portrait and landscape painter, critical of modernism and modern art. He was successful in art competitions, placing third in the 1957 Kelliher Art Award with a landscape of the Rangitikei River and winning outright two years later with a scene of Dunedin's Octagon. He was third again in 1960, 1961 and 1963. Later life In 1962 McIntyre was approached by Ray Richards, of A.H. Reed Limited, with a suggestion of writing a book on his career. This proved to be The Painted Years, the first of several books authored and illustrated by McIntyre. It was a success, and led to his commissioning by Reed to produce a volume with landscapes of New Zealand. This was Peter McIntyre's New Zealand, published in 1964. The first print run of 5,000 sold out within days and the book would remained in print for 20 years. His next book was Peter McIntyre's Pacific, published in 1966, was also a success and ended up being distributed into the United States. A Californian company, Lane Publishing Company, partnered with Reed and McIntyre to produce Peter McIntyre's West, containing scenes from the western states. This was published in 1970, selling over 27,000 copies and boosting McIntyre's profile in the United States. In the 1970 New Year Honours, McIntyre was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire for services to the arts. His work remained of public interest, with high prices paid throughout the 1970s and 1980s for his paintings. He also continued to produce books; a particularly personal project for McIntyre was Kakahi. Named for the small town in the King Country where he owned a holiday home, the book highlighted themes of conservation and rural landscapes. McIntyre's Country was published in 1979 and the last of his books was Peter McIntyre: War Artist. This was published in 1981 and returned his war art to the public eye. After journalists made enquiries, it was found that the works executed by the official war artists during the Second World War, and which was the property of the New Zealand Government, had been widely dispersed throughout the country. Many were displayed at Returned Services Associations, regional museums, and government departments without thought given to their care. The poor condition of many works resulted in public criticism being directed towards the nominal custodian of the works, the Department of Internal Affairs. After initially claiming it lacked hanging space for them, it set about centralising the war artist's work to the National Archives. It transpired that of the 160 Mcintyre works in the collection, 40 needed some restoration work. Death He died in Wellington on 11 September 1995, survived by his wife and two children. Earlier in the year, Wellington City Gallery held an exhibition of his war art; over 22,000 people had viewed his work by the time of his death. His work continues to be sought after; an auction held in November 2015 of paintings of farming scenes fetched prices well above of what was expected.

The Cy-Hawk Trophy is awarded to the winner of the game. It is named after the teams' mascots, Cy the Cardinal and Herky the Hawk. Conceived and created as a traveling trophy by the Greater Des Moines Athletic Club in 1976, the trophy was first presented to the winner by Iowa Governor Robert D. Ray in 1977. That game was the first meeting between the two since 1934. Trophy design The trophy design used through the 2010 season featured a football, a running back in the classic stiff-arm pose, and the likenesses of Iowa State's Cy the Cardinal and Iowa's Herky the Hawk. The trophy was replaced after the 2010 game, making Iowa and Iowa State the only schools in the country to sell out a rivalry trophy for corporate sponsorship. Since then the Cy-Hawk trophy makes an annual tour with WHO sportscaster Keith Murphy the week before the game. It remains the recognizable symbol of the contest and, according to Murphy, \\"people love it.\\" A new trophy, donated by the Iowa Corn Growers Association, was introduced to the public during the Iowa State Fair on August 19, 2011. A sculpture atop the new trophy depicted a farm family with small children huddled about a bushel basket of corn. Dean Taylor, president of the Association, called it \\"a work of art that represents Iowans and their hard work.\\" Within hours of its presentation, however, the new trophy was widely ridiculed in newspaper columns and internet postings by the public. Iowa Governor Terry Branstad publicly provided negative feedback, as did retired Iowa football coach Hayden Fry, who said, \\"The farmer, family and corn is all wonderful, but I don't really get the relationship to a football game.\\" On August 23, 2011, Iowa Corn Growers Association CEO Craig Floss announced that the new Cy-Hawk Trophy would be changed as a result of the negative public reaction. Selection of the new trophy would involve public input. A temporary trophy was used for 2011. With fan input, the newly, redesigned trophy was unveiled at the end of the 2012 game won by Iowa State featuring mascots of the two universities, a raised football, and corn making up the background. Game results The two schools played each other 24 times between 1894 and 1934, before the Cy-Hawk Trophy was established in 1977. The series halted after 1934 after then University of Iowa Athletic Director and head football coach Ossie Solem would not return calls to reschedule the rivalry; the series was restarted in 1977. Of the 67 games in the series played through 2019, 40 of them have been played in Iowa City while just 27 games have been contested in Ames. In 2015, the college football blog Every Day Should Be Saturday nicknamed the rivalry ¬°El Assico!https://www.bannersociety.com/2019/9/9/20856722/iowa-iowa-state- rivalry-el-assico (a vulgar reference to El Cl√°sico), for the perceived poor quality of play featured in the game. Games in the series are often low- scoring and decided by less than seven points, regardless of the pregame ranking of the teams. Through the 2019 season, Iowa has won the last five contests. The game was canceled in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, marking the first time since 1976 that the rivalry was not played.

According to the , it has a population of people. Located northeast of Tagbilaran, it may have been named after a town in the province of Navarre in northern Spain. Corella is known primarily as the home of the endemic Philippine tarsier, one of the world's smallest primates. The Philippine tarsier sanctuary run by the Philippine Tarsier Foundation, as well as the Research and Development Center, is in Canapnapan, east of the centre of town. The people of Corella are predominantly conservative Roman Catholics belonging to the parish of Our Lady of the Village whose feast is celebrated on 27 April. History Its former name was Nugas before it obtained its present name, Corella. It was then a barrio of Baclayon. The adoption of the name Corella was made at the behest of Fr Jose Maria Caba√±as del Carmen, then the parish priest of Baclayon and endorsed by Fr Felix Guillen de San Jose, the first Spanish priest. Corella was a name of a village in Navarra, Spain where this town's patroness, Nuestra Se√±ora del Villar, showered miracles. The creation of this town was due to the efforts of its inhabitants including Isidoro Ramo, who became its first gobernadorcillo. The stone church and the convent were constructed during the tenure of Fr Felix Gullen and completed by later priests, one of them being Fr Dionisio Llorete who also spearheaded the erection of two stone school buildings and the municipal building during the term of the gobernadorcillo, Celedonio Sayon. But the construction of Corella's present concrete church began in 1924 under Fr Pedro Montelbon, the parish priest of Tagbilaran who took over the administration of the Corella parish after the incumbent, Fr Eugenio Desamparados left. A battle of principles, rights, obligations, and duties raged in the municipality in 1920 between Simeon Sambola, the parish priest and the municipal president Nicanor C. Tocmo who were at loggerheads on the matter of school administration. From the pulpit, Fr Simeon lambasted the municipal administration and condemned the teachings in Corella schools as having originated from the mouth of hell. Enrollment in the school greatly diminished. Only close family friends and relatives of president Tocmo sent their children to school. The local civil administration complained to the provincial and national authorities. After a fact-finding investigation by the Department of Public Instruction whose report was submitted to the Governor- General, Fr Simeon was removed. During the Japanese occupation, the area at a distance halfway between Corella and Gaboc was \\"no-man's land\\". Several civilians were arrested there by the Japanese and executed on the spot. Honorio Butawan, a bolo volunteer, was caught by the enemy, and taken to Tagbilaran never to return. Other civilians of Corella suffered instant death from the Japanese as the latter tried to escape the US army of liberation. In October 1944, Capt. Martin Maliwanag, a guerrilla leader under Major Ismael Ingeniero established his headquarters in Corella, making the convent his command post and the primary school building east of the town plaza his detention cell. Several Filipino JCs (Japanese Constabulary) surrendered voluntarily. The first to surrender on 29 October 1944 was Lt. Victorio Sumodabila. He was shot on the spot by Capt. Maliwanag. Four other JCs from Corella who were killed and buried in common grave of Corella were Dandong Lamayo, his brother Fermin Lamayo, Felicisimo Guscal, and his brother-in-law, Celistino Formentera. In all, there were nine Filipino JCs who met their violent deaths in Corella on orders of Capt. Maliwanag, who met his own death when he attacked the Japanese garrison in Gaboc. His body was buried in the same cemetery as his victims. It was Maliwanag's men who captured the puppet Japanese governor Agapito Hontanosas. During the guerrilla period, Corella had four mayors closely succeeding each other: :* The Commonwealth-elected mayor Catalino C. Vale, who was suspected to be a Japanese puppet, was detained in Behind The Clouds (San Jose) in Batuan, where the Bohol Area Command (BAC) of the guerilla forces had its headquarters. :*Roman Calotes Tocmo who was named acting vice mayor by the guerillas and Tiburcio Aranas who was the acting mayor. :* After Aranas's death, Jose Clarin replaced him. :*When Clarin went on leave, he was substituted by Isaac Filo. Barangays Corella comprises 8 barangays, all classified as rural: { style=\\"background-color:white;margin:0 auto;border:0;\\"   style=\\"padding:4em 0 0 2em;vertical-align:top;background- color:white;\\"  } Climate Demographics From 1990, a marked decrease in population is noted. Groups of people migrated to other parts of the country, such as Mindanao, where they founded a new municipality, \\"New Corella\\". Economy Corella does not have any major industry.

Radville is a small valley town in southern Saskatchewan, Canada. A small river, Long Creek, runs through the north end of the town, providing fishing and recreation to the locals. The creek meanders by the east side of the town and then to the south where a second dam is located for the water supply pumphouse. The town is in the rural municipality #38 of Laurier (incorporated December 13, 1909). It was incorporated in 1911 after being settled in 1895, named after Conrad Paquin.

There was a large pool room, barber shop and bowling alley next door to Wong's cafe. Radville has had several theatres. The last one, the Oasis Theater, closed its doors in 1977, showing Star Wars as one of its last movies. After standing empty for a few years, the Oasis was bought by local entrepreneur George Hays and converted into the Alley Oops bowling alley. The newspaper South Saskatchewan Star was owned and operated by Oscar Stitt. A few years afterwards, George Hays purchased the local newspaper, the Radville Star, and moved the publication into the same building. The other theatre, owned by Ham Ferris, closed much earlier and was converted into a senior citizens hall in 1972. The theatre that became a bowling alley. The local pharmacy, the Radville Drug Store, was operated by Ron Zimmers from the late 1960s through to the 2000s.

There was also the Christian College located on the east side of Long Creek. The Radville Public School, a traditional 3-storey cube-shaped red brick building, burned to the ground on January 23, 1977.The Regina LeaderPost, \\"Radville fire destroys school\\", The LeaderPost, January 17, 1977Facebook post - Regina LeaderPost, \\"Radville fire destroys school\\", The LeaderPost, January 17, 1977 A mimeography machine with its alcohol-based image transfer fluid created an explosion in the staff office on the second floor. Picture windows across the street were cracked as a result of the explosion. The new Radville Elementary School opened a few years later. In the interim, the students were sent to some reserved classrooms in the high school, and the younger students were sent to the Catholic school. The principal at the time of the fire was Warren Blackstock. Churches in Radville were the United, Anglican, Pentecostal, Church of Christ, Catholic. Radville Regional High School. The high school was called the Radville Regional High School. Many students bore the letters of RRHS for the local Rebels team. The stability of certain teachers who had long terms in the school created a well balanced, solid background for graduates in furthering education. Floyd Cousins was a favorite principal during the 1940s and 1950s. The school principal was Charles Haggarty from 1967 until 1983. Other key teachers include Wayne Hurlbert, Miss Lecuyer, Estelle Johnston, Ethel Carlson (English), C.K. Lai (Algebra, Geometry), Richard (Dick) Schmidt (Coach). Eva McNaught, who was wife to the fire chief and drayman Harold, ran Eva's Popcorn stand for many years. Due to the warm long languishing summer nights typical of southern prairie towns, many people stayed out in the evenings and enjoyed the Saskatchewan summer weather. Radville uses a pumphouse for water treatment and supplying water pressure to its residents. The pumphouse is located on Saskatchewan Highway No. 28 junction into Radville. Radville CN Train Station located on the east side of Main Street. Radville used to be a major hub of activity throughout the 1920s to 1970s with a livery, the CN train and 5 grain elevators. Radville was a Canadian National Railway divisional point. It had a roundhouse with turntable, water tank, sand house, coal dock, ice house, bunkhouse, Roadmaster office, stores, stockyard, loading platform, freight and express service. The Radville railway station still remains though now used as a museum. All of the farm implement manufacturers had dealers, i.e. Massey Harris (Adrian Roy), John Deere, Ford, Case (Haden's). Automobile dealerships included General Motors (MacRobert Motors), Ford, and Chrysler. Claude Delaye operated a blacksmith shop. There were 4 general stores, Jack Seede's, Hussein Shibley's, Joe Carles, and Ham Ferris, Melda Morrissette's dress shop, Tetrault's bakery, Watson's hardware store, Clarke's Electric, appliance store, Credit Union, jeweller, 2 barber shops, dry cleaner (Legault's), 2 lumber yards, McIlrath and Security Lumber, Vennard's locker plant, liquor store, and a law office (George Thompson). This diminished when Highway No. 28 was upgraded in about 1975. With horses virtually gone and replaced by automotives and substantially improved roads, the next largest urban center of Weyburn received more and more of Radville's local regional commerce. =Larsen Dam= About a mile north of the town is a dam on the creek, commonly referred to as the Radville Dam or the Larsen Dam. This water reserve was used as the primary water reservoir for Radville until approximately 1984, at which time the town decided to use deep drilled water wells. The dam is stocked by the wildlife and fisheries department of the government. In the 1970s and the earlier 1980s, the dam was stocked with northern pike (or \\"jackfish\\") and fresh water perch. Later it was stocked with pickeral (or \\"walleye\\") and then with trout. People =Garbage Man= To the east of the town a small road leads to the local airport and to the old dump grounds. About in 1980, a new landfill was selected several miles away, southwest from the town. A walkway was built in 1994 and named Claffey Blvd, in honor of Vernon Claffey, who was the garbage man for Radville from the late 1930s to 1980s. Claffey provided many old toys that he personally gathered and fixed to the poorer families in Radville. =People= Radville has an active winter community, featuring a hockey rink with the Radville Nationals hockey team. Like most Canadian prairie communities, the town also has a curling rink. Professional hockey player Darcy Verot hails from Radville. In the 1980s, Tim Calibaba, son of local businessman Bill Calibaba, formed TWC. He caught the early adoption by Canadians of Mutual Funds and other financial instruments. TWC grew by association and agencies throughout western Canada until it was bought out by Berkshire Investments (Burlington, ON) in 2003 and became Berckshire-TWC Financial Group Inc. In 2007, Manulife Financial purchased Berkshire-TWC. The office continued to operate in Radville as Manualife Financial for a couple of years before being closed. Radville is home to artist and sculptor Scott Chandler Mcleod. Another prominent artist from Radville is Yvette Moore. Rodney MacDonald, a lawyer who practises and lives in the region, is an environmentalist who provided much support for the groups working against the Raferty Dam project in 1988. Many famous politicians are from the Radville district. The Websters, and recently Finance Minister Ralph Goodale. Another well-known politician is Roy Bailey (politician), and his brother, Ray Bailey, a founding member of the Western Canadian Concept (WCC) party.

Radville is part of the prairie boom town set in Southern Saskatchewan. Many pioneers set up homesteads with the encouragement of the Canadian government in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. At peak population in the early 1960s, Radville had approx 5000 residents. Throughout the 1970s and early 1980s, Radville's population was around 1000 people, and diminishing as better means of transport and lifestyle changes meant fewer people were interested in the small farm community lifestyle. Location Saskatchewan Highway 28 and Highway 377 pass through Radville. Nearby, the village of Ceylon is 23 km, and the city of Weyburn is 51 km to the northeast. Other nearby communities include Lake Alma, Minton, Gladmar, Pangman, Ogema, Midale and the Port of Regway. These communities heavily support the Radville economy as it is the largest centre in the area. Major urban centers include Regina, which is 148 km to the north, and Moose Jaw, 143 km northwest.

It is a tale of Aarne-Thompson type 571 ('All Stick Together'), with an episode of type 513B ('The Land and Water Ship'). Story (The Brothers Grimm) The hero is the youngest of three brothers, given the nickname Simpleton. His eldest brother is sent into the forest to chop wood, fortified with a rich cake and a bottle of wine. He meets a little gray man who begs a morsel to eat and a swallow of wine but is rebuffed. The eldest brother injures his arm falling into a tree and is taken home. The second brother meets a similar fate. Simpleton, sent out with a burned biscuit cooked in the ashes of the hearth and soured beer, is generous with the little old man and is rewarded with a golden goose. The goose has been discovered within the roots of the tree chosen by the little gray man and felled by Simpleton. Simpleton takes The Golden Goose to the inn. Simpleton takes the Golden Goose to market. With the goose under his arm, Simpleton heads for an inn where as soon as his back is turned, the innkeeper's daughter attempts to pluck just one of the feathers of pure gold and is stuck fast. Her sister comes to help her and is stuck fast too. The youngest daughter is determined not to be left out of the riches, grabs the sisters aprons and she ends up stuck to the second. Simpleton makes his way to the castle and each person who attempts to interfere is joined to the unwilling parade ranging from the parson, his sexton, and two laborers. In the castle lives the King with the Princess who has never smiled. The king offers the hand of the princess to anyone who succeeds in making her laugh. The despondent Princess, sitting by the window and glimpsing the parade staggering after Simpleton and his golden goose, laughs so hard she eventually cries. Some versions include an additional three trials. Simpleton succeeds in all with the help of his little gold friend and finally wins the princess's hand in marriage.  Story (The Jataka)  The Buddha (Bodhisatta) was born, grew up, and got married. During his life, he was a member of the Hindu caste group of hereditary priests and scholars. He also had three daughters named Nanda, Nandavati, and Sundarinanda. When he died, he was reincarnated as a golden goose with golden feathers, and after discovering his wife and daughters were being taken care of by others, he decided to give them some of his feathers; he hoped the feathers would help them live comfortably. Over time, he brought them more feathers to sell, and they were living in a continuous state of comfort and peace; until one day, when his wife became greedy and decided to formulate a plan to steal all of his feathers for money. His daughters did not like the idea of stealing his feathers, so they did not agree to the idea. Alas, the next time the golden goose came back, his wife plucked all of his feathers. When she did this, the feathers immediately changed from golden feathers to white crane feathers. The wife waited for the golden feathers to grow back, but they never did; they grew back white, and the goose flew away, never to return again. Literary examination of the story (The Brothers Grimm) The hero is the youngest of three brothers, given the nickname \\"Dummling\\" (Simpleton). His eldest brother is sent into the forest to chop wood (the Task), fortified with a rich cake and a bottle of wine. He meets a little gray man (the Disguised Helper) who begs a morsel to eat and a swallow of ale but is rebuffed. The eldest brother meets an accident and is taken home. The second brother meets a similar fate. Dummling, sent out with a biscuit cooked in the ashes of the hearth and soured beer, is generous with the little old man and is rewarded with a golden goose (the Fairy Gift). The goose has been discovered within the roots of the tree chosen by the little gray man and felled by Dummling. Tellers of this tale could not have been aware of the imprisonment of Osiris. For archaic Greek spirits within oak trees, see Dryads. With the goose under his arm, Dummling heads for an inn, where, as soon as his back is turned, the innkeeper's daughter attempts to pluck just one of the feathers of pure gold, and is stuck fast (Greed A-T Type 68A; Justice is Served). Her sister, coming to help her, is stuck fast too. And the youngest (Least of Three), determined not to be left out of the riches, is stuck to the second. Dummling makes his way to the castle, and each person who attempts to interfere is joined to the unwilling parade: the parson, his sexton, and two laborers. In the castle lives the king with the Princess (the Princess Prize) who has never laughed. But the despondent Princess, sitting by the window and glimpsing the parade staggering after Dummling and his golden goose, laughs until she cries. Dummling, after three more impossible trials including finding a ship that sails on land and sea, sometimes inserted in the tale, in each of which he is assisted by the little gray man, wins the Princess and everyone lives happily ever after. \\"The Golden Goose\\" falls in Aarne-Thompson Type 571, All Stick Together; the appended episode is of A-T Type 513B, The Land-and-Water Ship. Folklorist D. L. Ashliman has pointed out other versions of a Golden Fowl theme: The Goose That Laid the Golden Eggs (Aesop); The Golden Mallard (from the Jataka stories of the Buddha's former births); the Huma bird (Persia). Modern interpretations A musical version of The Golden Goose, written by Dieter Stegmann and Alexander S. Bermange was presented at the Amphitheater Park Schloss Philippsruhe, Hanau, Germany as part of the Brothers Grimm Festival in 2006. It was also featured as an episode of the PC game American McGee's Grimm where the goose is 10 times its size and its victims have their bodies completely stuck to the goose rather than falling in a conga line as in the story.

The Main Library is located at Civic Center, at 100 Larkin Street. The library system has won several awards, such as Library Journal's Library of the Year award in 2018. The library is well-funded due to the city's dedicated Library Preservation Fund that was established by a 1994 ballot measure, which was subsequently renewed until 2022 by a ballot measure in 2007. History In August 1877 a residents' meeting was called by state senator George H. Rogers and Andrew Smith Hallidie who advocated the creation of a free public library for San Francisco. A board of trustees for the Library was created in 1878 through the Free Library Act, signed by Governor of California William Irwin on March 18, which also created a property tax to fund the Library project. direct URL The San Francisco Public Library (then known as the San Francisco Free Library) opened on June 7, 1879 at Pacific Hall on Bush Street at Kearny Street and hired Albert Hart as the first librarian. In 1888 the Library moved to the Larkin Street wing of City Hall at Civic Center. The first three branches opened from 1888 to 1889, in the Mission, in North Beach, and in Potrero Hill. In 1889 the Library became a Federal depository by nomination of Senator George Hearst. Asian Art Museum In 1905, architect Daniel Burnham presented his plans for a new Civic Center for San Francisco, including a new library building. These plans were put on hold after the 1906 San Francisco earthquake, which destroyed about 140,000 volumes, nearly 80% of its holdings. The library moved to temporary quarters while a new building was designed and built. In 1917, the new main library building, designed by George W. Kelham, opened in the Civic Center.125th Anniversary Timeline History of the San Francisco Public Library Ten major murals by California Tonalist Gottardo Piazzoni were installed in 1931‚Äì1932; four more were completed in 1945, but left uninstalled until the 1970s. = New Main Library = In 1986, a task force was set up to complete the design of the Civic Center, including the use of Marshall Square, next to the main library at the time, for a new main library.125th Anniversary Timeline History of the San Francisco Public Library The building was completed in 1995 and opened a year later on April 18, 1996.

In March 2019, the San Francisco Public Library Commission voted to remove standing library fines and completely wipe out future fines because the fines serve as an impediment to access for community patrons who would otherwise use and visit one of San Francisco's twenty-seven public libraries. The vote still needs to be approved by a Board of Supervisors and the mayor of San Francisco, Mayor London Breed is supportive of this action. Sabatini, J.

Using the site of the old Lafayette School, architect John W. Reid, Jr. designed and landscaped the new branch building. The new branch was dedicated on April 10, 1932, with 11,823 new books on the shelves. Total cost for the building and its furnishings was $57,117.29. Anza Branch Library was the 17th branch established in the San Francisco Public Library system. The branch closed temporarily for renovation in May 2009. The Anza Branch reopened on Saturday June 18, 2011. = Bayview = The new Bayview Library opened February 23, 2013. The original Bayview/Anna E. Waden Branch Library was opened as a storefront facility in 1927. It was the 13th branch in the San Francisco Public Library system, replacing a \\"library station\\" that had been established in 1921. In 1969, a red brick building was built on the corner of the 3rd Street and Revere Avenue in the Bayview/Hunters Point district with a bequest from Anna E. Waden, a clerical employee of the City of San Francisco. Miss Waden's gift of $185,700 paid for the development of this cooperative community project. The building was completed in February 1969, and the formal dedication took place on July 12, 1969. The architect was John S. Bolles & Associates and the contractor was Nibbi Brothers. The fa√ßade included a sculpture by Jacques Overhoff. = Bernal Heights = Bernal Heights Branch (2010) The Bernal Heights Renovation was completed on January 30, 2010. A ‚Äúlibrary deposit station‚Äù was established in 1920 at 303 Cortland Avenue. As the neighborhood and library grew, it was moved, in 1936, to 324 Cortland. When that proved inadequate the neighbors lobbied for a new building. The one floor branch library at 500 Cortland, was the 21st in the system and built on the site of the original Bernal School at a cost of $94,600. It was designed by Frederick H. Meyer, one of the most prolific and versatile architects in San Francisco at the turn of the 20th century, funded by the Work Projects Administration and dedicated on October 21, 1940. = Chinatown = Chinatown Branch (2017) Chinatown Branch Library, built in 1921 by architect G. Albert Lansburgh is a Carnegie library originally named the North Beach Branch. It is the third branch in the system. Located in Chinatown on Powell Street between Washington and Jackson, the name was changed in 1958 to more accurately reflect the community served. In 1972, the Chinese language, and the Chinese American Interest collections were started in response to the needs and interests of the Chinatown community. In 1991, public and private funds were obtained for a major renovation and expansion of the Chinatown Branch Library. The branch was seismically retrofitted and expanded to twice its original size with a community meeting room and story-room available to use for programs and special events. The Grand Reopening of the Chinatown Branch Library was held on June 15, 1996. = Eureka Valley/Harvey Milk Memorial = Eureka Valley/Harvey Milk Branch (2010) The Eureka Valley Renovation was completed on October 24, 2009.

It was named the McCreery Branch in honor of Andrew McCreery who donated the land and paid for construction. It was damaged in the Daly City earthquake of 1957 and demolished. The site was used to construct a new building designed by Appleton and Wolford at a cost of $192,335 and opened on December 20, 1961. It was named the Eureka Valley Branch. In 1981 the Library Commission officially changed the name of the branch to Eureka Valley/Harvey Milk Memorial Branch Library to honor Harvey Milk, the first openly gay man to be elected to public office in California. Harvey Milk served as a member of the San Francisco Board of Supervisors until he was assassinated along with Mayor George Moscone on November 27, 1978. In 2006 the City honored Jos√© Sarria, the first openly gay man to run for Supervisor (in 1961) by renaming the section of 16th Street adjacent to the branch as Jos√© Sarria Court. Jos√© Sarria is best known for founding the Imperial Court System, one of the cornerstones of the GLBT community. = Excelsior = Excelsior Branch (2016) The Excelsior Branch Library was the 10th branch established in the San Francisco Public Library system.

The current building at 4400 Mission Street was opened to the public October 1, 1967. The branch was designed by architects Appleton and Wolfard and built for $248,000. The Excelsior Branch was the first to be renovated under the Branch Library Improvement Program and reopened on July 8, 2005. = Glen Park = Glen Park Branch (2016) Glen Park Branch Library first opened in January 1927, at 700 Bosworth Street. The branch was located at that site for almost 38 years, until the building that housed it was demolished during construction of Interstate 280. Glen Park Branch was then housed in several different locations over the course of 42 years until a multiuse building was constructed in the neighborhood at 2825 Diamond Street. Part of the new building was designated just for the library. The branch opened on October 13, 2007 and became the sixth branch to be renovated through the Branch Library Improvement Program. = Golden Gate Valley = Golden Gate Valley Branch (2016) In June 1917, to serve residents of the growing Golden Gate Valley, Cow Hollow, and Marina neighborhoods, construction of the Golden Gate Valley Branch Library was begun at a site on the southwest corner of Green and Octavia Streets that had been purchased by the City for $7,500. The resulting brick and terra cotta Beaux-Arts structure was designed in the shape of a basilica by local architect Ernest Coxhead. Though Carnegie grant funds paid for the building, City funds were used for the furnishings. The total cost of the building and furnishings came to $43,000, and on May 5, 1918, the branch was opened to the public. Golden Gate Valley Branch was the ninth branch established in the San Francisco Public Library system. = Ingleside = Ingleside Branch (current building, 2016) The new Ingleside Branch opened on September 12, 2009.

In 1914 a new Richmond Branch opened at the current location, the first library building in San Francisco constructed with Andrew Carnegie grant funds. In December 2000, the San Francisco Landmarks Board nominated Richmond Branch Library for designation as a city landmark. Funded by both a City bond measure and $6 million in Proposition 14 State bond funds, a newly renovated, seismically safe, accessible and technologically updated building opened in 2009. Services The San Francisco City Library offers a \\"homeless and poverty outreach library team\\" with the help of the Department of Public Health that helps find housing and other services for homeless patrons who set up camp among the stacks.

Giuseppe Bossi (11 August 1777 - 9 November 1815) was an Italian painter, arts administrator and writer on art. He ranks among the foremost figures of Neoclassical culture in Lombardy, along with Ugo Foscolo, Giuseppe Parini, Andrea Appiani or Manzoni. Biography He was born in the town of Busto Arsizio, near Milan. He was educated at the college of Monza; and his early fondness for drawing was fostered by the director of the college. He then studied at the Brera Academy of Fine Arts at Milan, and spent the years 1795‚Äì1801 in Rome, where he drew Roman remains and honed his skills in drawing anatomy at the morgue of a hospital and formed an intimate friendship with Canova, who made a portrait bust of Bossi . He met Jacques-Louis David in Lyon in 1802, though his own style employed a less rigorously classicizing technique. On his return to Milan he fell in with the circle of progressive young artists that formed the Cameretta PortianaBossi's group portrait of himself and four of the Cameretta Portiana was sold, Christie's Rome: Tuesday, 26 May 1998, lot328 (Illustrated). He became assistant secretary, and then secretary (1802‚Äì1807) of the Brera Academy, whose collection of paintings, the Pinacoteca he essentially founded. In 1804, in conjunction with Barnabo Oriani, he drew up revised organizational rules for the three academies of art of Bologna, Venice and Milan, which lent weight to the need for public collections of great examples of the arts, which were being supplied from the dissolved monasteries and secularized churches of Lombardy, under Napoleonic administration. He was rewarded with the Order of the Iron Crown. On the occasion of the visit of Napoleon to Milan in 1805, Bossi exhibited at the Pinacoteca a drawing of the Last Judgment of Michelangelo, and paintings representing Aurora and Night, Oedipus and Creon, and the Italian Parnassus. By command of prince Eug√®ne de Beauharnais, viceroy of Italy, Bossi undertook to make a copy of The Last Supper of Leonardo da Vinci, then almost obliterated, for the purpose of getting it rendered in mosaic. The drawing was made from the remains of the original with the aid of copies and the best prints. The mosaic, 9.18 m in length, was executed by the Roman mosaicist Giacomo Raffaelli, and was placed in the Minoritenkirche, Vienna.Illustration. Bossi made another copy in oil, which was placed in the Pinacoteca Brera. The Brera Academy owed to him its fine collection of casts of great works of sculpture acquired at Paris, Rome and Florence. For himself, Bossi collected books, drawings, prints, paintings, coins, sculptures, and antiquities. Bossi devoted a large part of his life to the study of the works of Leonardo, whose drawing manner he imitated accurately enough for his productions to have passed as Leonardos.Hans Ost, Das Leonardo-Portrat in der Kgl. Bibliothek Turin und andere Falschungen des Giuseppe Bossi (Gebr. Mann Studio-Reihe) 1980. and his last work was a series of drawings in monochrome representing incidents in the life of that great master. He left unfinished a large cartoon in black chalk of the Dead Christ in the bosom of Mary, with John and the Magdalene. In 1810 he published a special work in large quarto, entitled Del Cenacolo di Leonardo da Vinci, which had the merit of greatly interesting Goethe, who shared Bossi's urgent dream of saving Leonardo's fresco. Bossi's other publications were Delle Opinioni di Leonardo intorno alla simmetria de corpi umani (1811), and Del Tipo dell'arte della pittura (1816). His diary, 1807‚Äì1815, is a useful guide to the official artistic life of Napoleonic Milan. Bossi died at his home in via S. Maria Valle, Milan. A monument by Canova was erected to his memory in the Biblioteca Ambrosiana, and a bust was placed in the Brera.

( ) was an energy company based in Cincinnati, Ohio, United States, from 1994 to 2006. Its name is a play on the words \\"synergy\\", \\"energy\\", and \\"Cincinnati\\". History Cinergy was created on October 24, 1994, from the merger of the Cincinnati Gas & Electric Company (CG&E;) and Kentucky subsidiary Union Light, Heat & Power (ULH&P;) with Plainfield, Indiana-based PSI Energy (Public Service Indiana). Cinergy's Cincinnati headquarters, now known as the Duke Energy Building. Under its various operating names, the company operated a Holiday Model Train Display that has attracted over 9 million visitors since the event's inception in 1946. The authentic display measures long and imitates an O gauge, in which a quarter- inch on the model is equivalent to one foot on a real train. In 1996, Riverfront Stadium in Downtown Cincinnati was renamed Cinergy Field in a sponsorship deal with Cinergy. The stadium was demolished by implosion in December 2002 to make way for Great American Ballpark. In 2005, Cinergy announced a friendly acquisition by the larger Charlotte, North Carolina-based Duke Energy. The acquisition was completed on April 3, 2006. The combined company retains the Duke Energy name. Until the acquisition, Cinergy still operated under the names of the three local utilities (e.g., Cinergy/CG&E; in Cincinnati); since the acquisition, the names of the three former Cinergy utilities and Duke Power, the former Duke Energy utility subsidiary, have been phased out, although signs bearing the former logos still remain at some substations. Duke, in partnership with railway company CSX, continued to host the annual train display in Cinergy's former headquarters until 2011, when the display was donated to the Cincinnati Museum Center at Union Terminal. Environmental record In May 2006, Cinergy was fingered as a key contributor to major pollution in the American Midwest, prompting the New York State government to sue the company and forcing the company to install modern pollution control equipment. The Ontario government, across the border in Canada, followed suit at the request of New York Attorney General Eliot Spitzer. Researchers at the University of Massachusetts Amherst have identified Cinergy as the 49th-largest corporate producer of air pollution in the United States, with roughly 29 million pounds of toxic chemicals released annually into the air.Political Economy Research Institute Toxic 100 (Study released May 11, 2006) retrieved 15 August 2007 Major pollutants indicated by the study include sulfuric acid, hydrochloric acid, chromium compounds, and manganese compounds.

It was released between October 11 and November 19, 2004 in North America and Europe, respectively. On April 18, 2014, Nordic Games officially released SuperPower 2 on the Steam Store. Players may join a game as any of the 193 nations recognized by the United Nations at the time of its development. All standard games start in the year 2001, with the player taking control of their nation. They then must work toward their predefined goals, such as achieving world peace, balancing your nation's resources, or conquering the world, or, if they did not set any predefined goals, they have the opportunity to work toward developing their nation's infrastructure, increasing their military strength through new unit designs and development, and encouraging the economic and cultural growth of their nation. Any nation not controlled by a player is considered an AI nation. If there are predefined objectives, the player will attempt to reach this objective to win the game. The AI will have their own objectives, which they will try to reach as well. If and when the player and the AI have conflicting goals, it is up to the player, and occasionally the AI, to decide if diplomacy is the way to go, or if war is the answer to their problems. Because SuperPower 2 is a real-time game, there is no preset end date. This means that a single game can, in theory, run indefinitely. SuperPower 2 was released in English, French, German, Spanish, Korean, Chinese and Russian.  Spheres  = Political sphere = Political Sphere * Political sphere (menu structure) ** Constitutional ** Internal Laws ** Treaties *** New Treaty *** View Selected Political sphere consists of all political activity, domestic and international, of the selected nation. This sphere allows players to see (and modify if own nation is selected) internal laws, government type, and diplomatic agreements. = Military sphere = Military Sphere The Military sphere consists of all military and covert operations. This sphere allows players to buy, sell, build, train, deploy, disband a variety of military units. It also allows players to train intelligence cells and conduct covert warfare. In addition, strategic warfare is controlled from this sphere.  Strategic warfare  Strategic warfare consists of nuclear missiles being launched from land based locations, or from submarines. Nuclear warfare is devastating for both the attacker and the victim. When a nuclear missile is launched and detonates in another nation, relations with nations around the world decline, depending on the importance of the nation attacked. The attacker's nation also becomes less stable, increasing chances of a revolution. The Russian Federation launching a nuclear strike against the United States. = Economic sphere = The economic sphere consists of all financial activity. From this sphere player can view (and control if the selected nation is the same as the player's) income and expenses as well as trade and taxes. Players can set national interest rates, income tax levels, tariffs, and spending levels in this sphere. Players can also nationalize or privatize portions of their economy. This is also where the \\"Autarky\\" bug does most damage because in the game trade is almost always the most income generating source and when the bug sets in, this well of wealth inevitably dries up when no other nations buy your goods. However, playing country with high levels of raw resources like South Africa with precious metals, seems to not fall victim to the bug as quickly as countries relying on services and agriculture. Also, by invading nearby countries followed by annexation and high levels of taxes can also stave off autarky. At this point however, convincing the rest of the world not to invade is a bigger problem.  Reception  Although slightly improved over the original SuperPower, the sequel received \\"mixed\\" reviews according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. Many critics referred to the game as highly ambitious but critically flawed. One of the most positive reviews, from GameZone, said that \\"The number of options, the good graphics for the globe and almost limitless gameplay adds up a game that is worthy of United Nations attention.\\" However, many high-profile gaming publications panned the game, with common criticisms including frequent crashes, a poorly designed user interface, features that were either not implemented or apparently ineffective, and frequent implausible, nonsensical, and unexplained events occurring during the game (such as Poland declaring war on Burkina Faso for unclear reasons). A reviewer for GameSpy described SuperPower 2 as \\"a bunch of pointless hand-waving in a half-hearted attempt to pawn off a ponderous spreadsheet as a game\\", also stating that \\"...because the game is so devoid of personality, it's not even engaging as a way of experimenting with nightmare scenarios. There's nothing satisfying about taking control of the U.S. and changing it to a military dictatorship without freedom of speech or women's suffrage, only to see your political standing inch to the right and maybe your approval rating dip for a while.\\" IGN was also critical of the game, giving it a score of 4.5 out of 10 and stating, among other things, that \\"The art of international war itself is conducted here according to principles that would make Sun Tzu burn his book and restart life as a caterer.\\" The game also features plenty of mods to choose from which change and edit the game play to specific real time or fictional settings.  Steam release  After nearly 10 years from the original release date, the game was released on the PC game distribution platform Steam on April 18, 2014, after a successful Steam Greenlight campaign. The Steam version features updated code and patches for bugs that were long neglected in the older version. However, this version also came with its share of problems, such as fullscreen mode not being an option, and the updated code breaking user-made modifications from the older version. The former was fixed however. Steam achievements were also added, as well as a new authentication system and server browser, which replaced GameSpy, its former server browser service that discontinued the game earlier in the year.  GOG release  Remastered DRM-free version of the game was released on the PC game distribution platform GOG.com on August 13, 2015 with a 4 day -50% launch discount. Game is sold with additional manual, design document, concept arts and team photographs. Much like Steam version it lacked full screen mode. Remastering included support for widescreen resolutions, new multiplayer matchmaking with modified multiplayer user interface, and an updated source code to offer support for modern operating systems. Initial reviews were mixed.  Bugs  After playing for a long period (the exact amount varies from game to game), a bug called Autarky sets in. The Autarky bug will always happen if the game is going on for a long period. It makes it nearly impossible for a nation to trade because everyone has a surplus of many of the items they trade. This causes nations to begin to lose money, since they can no longer make money from trade. While in most cases the bug eventually occurs, the use of extensive measures within player controlled countries- such as explosive population growth manipulation, severe limiting of human development and minimal infrastructures and telecommunications development- can maintain a permanent, large, and increasing resource deficit, which results in permanent importing for the player country, and massive export growth for virtually all other countries. With extreme population manipulation through the building and canceling of large numbers of soldiers while paused, it is possible to sustain a pan-global computer nation export economy with one underdeveloped, vastly overpopulated nation. There are several patches made by the modding community fixing bugs.

One of the best-known and most respected playback singers in India. Many people believe that she could not reach the stature and position which her talent really warranted, in spite of having all the mandatory characteristics required to make a mark in the field of playback singing like great knowledge of classical music, a melodious voice and a wide range. Her voice was often mistaken to be that of Lata Mangeshkar.The Other Lata Suman Kalyanpur's career started in 1954 and was very popular singer in the 1960s and 1970s. She recorded songs for movies in several languages besides Hindi, Marathi, Assamese, Gujarati, Kannada,Maithili, Bhojpuri, Rajasthani, Bengali, Oriya and Punjabi.Suman Kalyanpur She is considered among the popular singers of her prime time and golden era of Hindi film music, along with Mohammed Rafi, Lata Mangeshkar, Mukesh, Geeta Dutt, Asha Bhosle, Hemant Kumar, Talat Mahmood, Kishore Kumar, Manna Dey, Mahendra Kapoor and Shamshad Begum. She has sung a total of 857 Hindi songs. Early life Suman Kalyanpur was born Suman Hemmady on 28 January 1937 in Dhaka, Bangladesh. Suman Kalyanpur's father Shankar Rao Hemadi hailed from an elite Saraswat Brahmin family belonging to Mangalore, Karnataka. Hemmady is a village in Kundapur Taluk of Udupi District, Karnataka. He served on a top post in the Central Bank of India and was posted to Dhaka (now Bangladesh) for a very long period. Apart from father and mother Seeta Hemmady, there were 5 daughters and one son in the family with Suman being the eldest among her siblings. In 1943, her family moved to Mumbai, where she received her musical training. Suman had always been interested in painting and music. After completing schooling from Mumbai‚Äôs famed St. Columba High School, she got admission in the prestigious Sir J. J. School of Arts for further studies in painting. Simultaneously, she started learning classical vocal from Pune's Prabhat Films' music director and a close family friend, Pandit Keshav Rao Bhole. According to Suman, initially singing was just hobby to her but gradually her interest in music increased and she started learning it professionally from Ustad Khan, Abdul Rehman Khan and Guruji Master Navrang.Suman Kalyapurhttp://beetehuedin.blogspot.in/2013/09/na- tum-hamein-jaano-suman-kalyanpur.html Meeting with Suman Kalyanpur Career According to Suman, Immediately after the film ‚Äò'Mangu‚Äô', Suman sang 5 songs under the baton of composer Naushad for the film Darwaza (1954), which was produced by Ismat Chugtai and directed by Shahid Lateef. Since ‚Äò'Darwaza‚Äô' released first, it is generally believed to be Suman Kalyanpur's first Hindi film. In the same year (1954), Suman sang the film version of O.P.Nayyar‚Äôs hit ensemble song \\"Mohabbat Kar Lo Ji Bhar Lo Aji Kisne Roka Hai\\" with Mohammed Rafi and Geeta Dutt for the film Aar Paar. According to Suman, she had a couple of solo lines to sing and her services were used, more, as a chorus singer in this song. This proved to be the only song she ever sang for O.P. Nayyar. Suman Kalyanpur's first film song was a duet with Talat Mahmood in Darwaza (1954). Talat Mahmood heard Kalyanpur singing in a musical concert and was highly impressed by her singing. A rank newcomer, her career hit the big league when Talat agreed to sing the duet with her, making the film industry sit up and take notice of her. She sang for the movie, Mangu (1954), Koi Pukare Dheere Se Tujhe. Kalyanpur provided playback singing for Miyan Bibi Razi (1960), Baat Ek Raat Ki (1962), Dil Ek Mandir (1963), Dil Hi To Hai (1963), Shagoon (1964), Jahan Ara (1964), Sanjh Aur Savera (1964), Noor Jehan (1967), Saathi (1968) and Pakeezah (1971). She sang for composers Shankar Jaikishan, Roshan, Madan Mohan, S. D. Burman, N Datta, Hemant Kumar, Chitragupta, Naushad, S. N. Tripathi, Ghulam Mohammed, Kalyanji Anandji and Laxmikant‚ÄìPyarelal singing the most songs for the first two in the list. She has sung over 740 movie and non-movie songs. She sang over 140 duets with Rafi in the 1960s. Suman's first song in Marathi was the super-hit \\"Bhaatuklichaa Khel Maandila\\" for Vasant Prabhu, for the film Pasant Aahe Mulgi. After that she never looked back for over 20 years. Putra Vhawa Aisaa, Ekti, Manini and Annapoorna were but a few of her memorable films. But even outside films, her hits are legion and include over 50 timeless gems of Marathi films, bhavgeet and bhaktigeet. Kalyanpur sang with Lata Mangeshkar the duet \\"Kabhi Aaj, Kabhi Kal, Kabhi Parson\\" under the direction of composer Hemant Kumar. She recorded some popular duets with male singers Mohammed Rafi, Manna Dey, Mukesh, Talat Mahmood, and Hemant Kumar. Some of her memorable duets with Rafi are \\"Aajkal Tere Mere Pyaar Ke Charche\\", \\"Na Na Karte Pyaar\\", \\"Tumse O Hasina\\", \\"Rahen Na Rahen Hum\\", \\"Parbaton Ke Pedon Par Shaam Ka Basera He\\", \\"Yeh Parbaton Ke Daayare\\", \\"Ajahuna Aye Balama\\", \\"Tumane Pukara Aur Hum Chale Aye\\", \\"Bad Muddat Ke Yeh Ghadi Ayee\\", \\"Mujhhe Yeh Bhool Na\\", \\"Dil Ne Phir Yaad Kiya\\", \\"Tujhko Dilbari Ki Kasam\\" and \\"Chand Takata Hai Idhar\\". With Manna Dey, she sang the popular duet \\"Na Jane Kahan Ham The\\" under the music direction of Dattaram. With Mukesh she has sung many popular duets like \`Yeh Kisne Geet Chheda', \\"Akhiyon ka noor hai tu\\", \\"Mera Pyar Bhi Tu Hai\\", \\"Dil Ne Phir Yaad Kiya\\", \\"Shama Se Koi Kehde\\", etc. Kalyanpur also recorded some memorable songs with a classical base, including \\"Manamohan Man Mein Ho Tumhi\\", \\"Mere Sang Ga Gunguna\\" and \\"Gir Gayi Re More Mathe Ki Bindiya\\". Similarity of voice with Lata Mangeshkar Suman Kalyanpur's voice was very similar to the singer, Lata Mangeshkar. Many of her songs are indistinguishable from Lata's style, because she sung with a quality comparable to Lata. Kalyanpur was very uncomfortable regarding the similarity between her voice and Lata's. She had once answered \\"I was quite influenced by her. In my college days, I used to sing her songs. Meri aawaaz nazuk aur patli thi (My voice was fragile and thin). What could I do? Also when Radio Ceylon relayed the songs, the names were never announced. Even the records sometimes gave the wrong name. Maybe that caused more confusion.\\"The other Lata In the era of 1950s and 1960s, the period was referred as the golden era of Hindi film music where the time when female playback singing was dominated by the Mangeshkar sisters Lata and Asha Bhosale. When Lata was not available for recording, or if the producers could not afford her rate of Rs 100 per song, the song used to be sung by Kalyanpur. During the similar period, Lata had refused to sing with Rafi over royalty issues and those songs were recorded by Kalyanpur with Rafi. She sang over 140 duets with Rafi in this period. Personal life Suman Hemmady married a Mumbai-based businessman Ramanand Kalyanpur in the 1958 and thus, became Suman Kalyanpur from Suman Hemmady. He accompanied her for every recording session after her marriage. She has a daughter named Charul Agni who is settled in the United States after marriage. Her grand daughter Aaishanni Agny returned to India and opened an NGO in Mumbai in her grand mother's name.

The name is Aramaized from the Persian bustan or bostan, meaning \\"Garden\\" (as proper name see Ferdinand Justi, Iranisches Namenbuch, p. 74). Almost the only exilarch of whom anything more than the name is known, he is frequently made the subject of legends. Bostanai was the son of the exilarch Hananiah. Hai GaonSha'arei Tzedek, p. 3a seems to identify Bostanai with Haninai, and tells that he was given for wife a daughter of the Persian king Chosroes II (died 628), by the calif Omar (died 644).See Rapoport, in \\"Bikkure ha-'Ittim,\\" x.83; B. Goldberg, in \\"Ha-Maggid,\\" xiii.363 Abraham ibn Daud, however,In his \\"Sefer haKabbalah\\" (Adolphe Neubauer's Medieval Jewish Chronicles, i.64 says that it was the last Sassanid king, Yezdegerd (born 624; died 651-652see N√∂ldeke, \\"Tabari,\\" pp. 397 et seq.), who gave his daughter to Bostanai. But in that case it could have been only Calif Ali (656-661), and not Omar, who thus honored the exilarch.See \\"Ma'aseh Bet David\\" It is known also that Ali gave a friendly reception to the contemporary Gaon Isaac;Sherira II's \\"Letter,\\" ed. Neubauer, ib. p. 35; Abraham ibn Daud, ib. p. 62 and it is highly probable, therefore, that he honored the exilarch in certain ways as the official representative of the Jews. The office of the exilarch, with its duties and privileges, as it existed for some centuries under the Arabian rule, may be considered to begin with Bostanai. The Dispute among his heirs The relation of Bostanai to the Persian princess called \\"Dara\\"In \\"Ma'aseh Bet David\\" or \\"Azdad-war\\"N√∂ldeke, \\"Isdundad\\" according to a genizah fragment had an unpleasant sequel. The exilarch lived with her without having married her, and according to the rabbinical law she should previously have received her \\"letter of freedom,\\" for, being a prisoner of war, she had become an Arabian slave, and as such had been presented to Bostanai. After Bostanai's death, his sons insisted that the princess and her son were still slaves and hence, their property. The judges were divided in opinion, but finally decided that the legitimate sons of the exilarch should grant letters of manumission to the princess and her son in order to testify to their emancipation. This decision was based on the ground that Bostanai had probably lived in legitimate marriage with this woman, and, although there were no proofs, had presumably first emancipated and then married her. Nevertheless, the descendants of the princess were not recognized as legitimate 300 years afterward.Hai Gaon, l.c. The statement in the genizah specimen (see bibliography below) is doubtless dictated by enmity to the exilarch; Abraham ibn Daud's statementl.c. is contrariwise prejudiced in favor of the exilarch; but compare genizah fragment published by Schechter.In Jew. Quart. Rev. xiv.242-246 Legends The name \\"Bostanai\\" gave rise to the following legend: The last Persian king (Hormuzd), inimical to the Jews, decided to extinguish the royal house of David, no one being left of that house but a young woman whose husband had been killed shortly after his marriage, and who was about to give birth to a child. Then the king dreamed that he was in a beautiful garden (\\"bostan\\"), where he uprooted the trees and broke the branches, and, as he was lifting up his ax against a little root, an old man snatched the ax away from him and gave him a blow that almost killed him, saying: \\"Are you not satisfied with having destroyed the beautiful trees of my garden, that you now try to destroy also the last root? Truly, you deserve that your memory perish from the earth.\\" The king thereupon promised to guard the last plant of the garden carefully. No one but an old Jewish sage was able to interpret the dream, and he said: \\"The garden represents the Davidic line, all of whose descendants you have destroyed except a woman with her unborn boy. The old man whom you saw was David, to whom you promised that you would take care that his house should be renewed by this boy.\\" The Jewish sage, who was the father of the young woman, brought her to the king, and she was assigned to rooms fitted up with princely splendor, where she gave birth to a boy, who received the name \\"Bostanai,\\" from the garden (\\"bostan\\") which the king had seen in his dream. The veracity of this account was disputed by Rabbi Sherira Gaon who claimed his own lineage traces to a pre-Bostanaian branch of the Davidic line. Bostanai at the Court of the King The figure of the wasp in the escutcheon of the exilarch was made the subject of another legend. The king had taken delight in the clever boy, and, spending one day with him, saw, as he stood before him, a wasp sting him on the temple. The blood trickled down the boy's face, yet he made no motion to chase the insect away. The king, upon expressing astonishment at this, was told by the youth that in the house of David, of which he had come, they were taught, since they themselves had lost their throne, neither to laugh nor to lift up the hand before a king, but to stand in motionless respect.Sanhedrin 93b The king, moved thereby, showered favors upon him, made him an exilarch, and gave him the power to appoint judges of the Jews and the heads of the three academies, Nehardea, Sura, and Pumbedita. In memory of this Bostanai introduced a wasp into the escutcheon of the exilarchate. The genizah fragment says that the incident with the wasp occurred in the presence of the calif Omar, before whom Bostanai as a youth of sixteen had brought a dispute with a sheikh, who filled his office during the exilarch's minority, and then refused to give it up. Bostanai was exilarch when Persia fell into the hands of the Arabians, and when Ali came to Babylon Bostanai went to meet him with a splendid retinue, whereby the calif was so greatly pleased that he asked for Bostanai's blessing. The calif, on learning that Bostanai was not married, gave him Dara, the daughter of the Persian king, as wife; and the exilarch was permitted to make her a Jew and to marry her legitimately. She bore him many children, but their legitimacy was assailed after their father's death by the exilarch's other sons (\\"Ma'aseh Bostanai,\\" several times printed under different titlesSee Benjacob, s.v.). This legend was made known only in the 16th century (compare Isaac Akrish), but the Seder 'Olam Zu·π≠·π≠a, composed in the beginning of the 9th century, drew upon the legends of the garden and the wasp (see Mar Zutra II). The name \\"Dara\\" for the Persian princess in Christian sources occurs also as that of Chosroes' daughter.Richter, \\"Arsaciden,\\" p. 554, Leipzig, 1804 The legend glorifying Bostanai probably originated in Babylon, while the genizah fragment, branding all the descendants of Bostanai as illegitimate, being descendants of a slave and unworthy to fill high office, comes from Palestine. This latter view is of course erroneous, as may be gathered from Hai's remark, above mentioned, for the post-Bostanaite house of exilarchs was not descended from the princess.

The book is a compilation of the author's lecture notes and a series of essays he wrote for Chinese journal Shiji Pinglun. Banned in Mainland China shortly after the communist takeover and in Taiwan due to Fei's perceived support of the Communist regime, the book only remained available in the Chinese-speaking world in Hong Kong until the 1980s, when Fei was rehabilitated and instated as a professor at Peking University. It was only translated into English in 1992. Fei wrote the book in an effort to develop a conceptual framework for depicting the moral and ethical characteristics of Chinese society, while simultaneously contrasting Chinese society's organizational structure with Western society. According to Fei, the title came from his trying to convey the idea that \\"the Chinese people come from the soil\\". Originally written with a Chinese audience in mind for the purpose of explicitly delineating the unique characteristics of their society, the book is also popular outside of China as a way to study and relate to Chinese society. History From the Soil is a compilation of lecture notes from courses author Fei Xiaotong taught on Chinese rural society in the 1940s, and a series of essays he wrote for Shiji Pinglun, a Chinese intellectual journal. Published in 1947, From the Soil quickly became one of Fei's most widely read books, and along with Reconstructing Rural China made Fei famous within China's intellectual circles. Even though Fei supported the Chinese Communist Party, following their consolidation of rule on the mainland his works were nonetheless branded as \\"rightist\\" and \\"anti-Marxist\\" and were subsequently banned; in neighboring Taiwan, Fei's works were similarly restricted because he had expressed support for the Communist party, although From the Soil remained available in Hong Kong. During these years, however, Fei's books (but not From the Soil) were translated into English and spread to the West, where they became widely read. After Fei was rehabilitated and sociology re-instated as a discipline in China in 1979, he was hired as a professor at Peking University and began teaching From the Soil as one of three required texts to small groups of graduate students. Themes Fei uses the imagery of water rippling from a center as a metaphor for Chinese society's focus on the self in regards to relationships and guanxi. The primary theme of From the Soil is that Chinese people were \\"inseparable from the soil\\" which nurtured Chinese society but also limits its potential, a description that Andrea Janku calls \\"the portrait of a rural and inward looking country\\". Fei also tackles the issue of selfishness in Chinese society, lamenting how the beautiful canals of Suzhou are routinely marred by garbage thrown in by residents with no sympathy for their fellow neighbors who use the canal's water to wash their clothes and vegetables. He uses the concentric ripples of a pebble hitting water as an analogy for Chinese societal structure to explain this selfishness, in what he calls a \\"self- centered quality\\" inherent in Chinese social relationships. In addition, he explains how kinship form the nexus of social relationships, governed under rules called guanxi, with every relationship falling under one of many distinct categories. Those falling further from the center (self) of the metaphorical ripples are categorized differently than those falling closer to the center. Fei further explains the unspoken rules of guanxi, explaining that rights and obligations to one another must be balanced and favors must be returned over set periods of time to prevent relationships from being severed. He also observes how Chinese political structure is on a \\"two-track\\" system: one centered on the central government and the other on local government, with each trying to influence the other with varying levels of success. Within this context, Fei offers suggestions on political reform that rest on restoring strong local power. Reception While From the Soil was banned in much of the Chinese-speaking world mere years after its publication, today it is one of Fei's most widely read books and, according to The New York Times, is a \\"cornerstone of modern sociology and anthropology. While Gary Hamilton and Wang Zhang called Fei's prose \\"disarming\\", they also observed that Fei possessed a deep understanding of Western sociological thought, mentioning and borrowing ideas from Western thinkers such as Emile Durkheim, George Herbert Mead, and William James. The University of California Press, its publisher in English, calls the book both \\"succinct and accessible\\" and \\"likely to have a wide impact on Western social theorists\\". According to Hamilton, \\"it is through this book that many Westerners can now learn about China.\\" Footnotes References * Anthropology books Sociology books 1947 non-fiction books ","title":"From the Soil"},{"id":"1798548","title":"List of Chinese sociologists and anthropologists"},{"id":"1798549","title":"Don't Stop (Funkin' 4 Jamaica)"},{"id":"1798552","text":"Bostonite, in petrology, is a fine-grained, pale-colored, grey or pinkish intrusive rock, which consists essentially of alkali-feldspar (orthoclase, perthite, anorthoclase, and albite).

He continued his work in Academia Sinica as the director and researcher of the Group of Anthropology in the Institute of History and Language. His research concentrated on somatometry, description of biological variation of ethnic minorities in China. He collected morphological measurements and described physical characteristics of living people in different parts of China. He also prepared the foundation of Institute of Physical Anthropology. He published more than 10 papers on physical anthropology, for example, in 1942, he published \\"the Physical Characteristics of Miao in South China\\" in \\"Journal of Anthropology\\" edited by Britain Royal Society. Moreover, Wu Dingliang set up and edited \\"Renleixue Jikan\\"(Communication on Anthropology). In 1941, Wu published the paper \\"Somatometry of Chinese in the Plain of North China\\" (including 190 indexes of somatometry) in Vol.2 of \\"Communication on Anthropology\\". In Sept.of 1947, the Department of Anthropology and the Institute of Anthropology were set up at Zhejiang University, Wu Dingliang assumed the dean of the department and the chief of the institute. Wu Dingliang educated many students that became prominent scholars of physical anthropology. Among them are Zhang Yinyun and Han Kangxin. In the period from 1946 to 1948, he also worked as part-time professor in the department of anthropology at Jinan University in Shanghai. In 1948,Wu Dingliang was elected as academician of Academia Sinica. During the 1950s, Wu and Liu Xian invited Dong Tichen and Zhao Yiqing to Fudan University.

Life =Youth= Anna Maria Mozart's birth home in St. Gilgen, now a museum She was born in St. Gilgen, Archbishopric of Salzburg, to Eva Rosina (1681‚Äì1755) and Wolfgang Nicolaus Pertl (1667‚Äì1724), deputy prefect of Hildenstein. Nicolaus had a university degree in jurisprudence from the Benedictine University in Salzburg and held many positions of responsibility, including district superintendent in St. Andrae. He was apparently a skilled musician. He suffered a severe illness in 1714 and had to change positions to one with a relatively small salary as deputy superintendent of H√ºttenstein. During the last portion of his life, he fell deeply into debt, and he died on 7 March 1724. Nicolaus's possessions were liquidated to help pay the debt, and his remaining family (Anna Maria's mother and her older sister Maria Rosina, born 24 August 1719) lapsed into poverty. They moved to Salzburg, not far away, and lived on a charity pension of just eight (later nine) florins per month, perhaps supplemented by low-level employment. Anna Maria's older sister died in 1728, aged nine. Anna Maria herself was not well when she was young: legal documents from the time describe her as \\"constantly ill\\" (1733) and \\"the constantly ill bedridden daughter\\" (1739). =Marriage and children= Maria Anna (Nannerl) Mozart as a child (1763), said to be by Pietro Antonio Lorenzoni She married Leopold Mozart in Salzburg in 1747; Abert writes, \\"the two were regarded at the time as the handsomest couple in Salzburg.\\" The couple moved (perhaps with Anna Maria's mother) into an apartment on the third floor of Getreidegasse 9. Their landlord was Lorenz Hagenauer, who was a close friend of Leopold's, and a frequent correspondent on the family's later travels.

Her womb retained the placenta, and its subsequent enforced removal at that time posed an extreme risk of fatal infection. The two surviving children achieved fame. The daughter Maria Anna was called \\"Nannerl\\" as a child. She was a talented musician who performed with her brother on tour, but whose later life was very limited in its experiences and possibilities. The son, Wolfgang Amadeus, born 27 January 1756, achieved distinction first as a child prodigy, later as one of the most celebrated of all composers. =Family life= Plaque in the Saint-Eustache church in Paris Assessing the evidence of the surviving letters, Abert writes of her role as spouse: \\"she understood her husband's phlegmatic and painfully conscientious nature and did all she could to spare him the numerous troubles and worries that stemmed from it, a task that cannot have been easy, given his perpetual mistrust, and there is no doubt that she will have drawn a veil over many an unpleasant incident not merely out of prudence, but also from fear. She was utterly devoted to him and willingly submitted to the strict regime to which he inevitably and unquestioningly subjected her.\\" Concerning Anna Maria as a mother, he says, \\"It was a pure and healthy spirit that reigned in the Mozart household... and Anna Maria must take much of the credit for this. Above all, she was a true mother to her children, who invariably sought refuge with her when their father's strict hand weighed unduly heavily upon them. Wolfgang loved and admired her to distraction.\\"Both quotations from The letters record that Anna Maria participated with zest in the family's tendency toward scatological humor, a tendency seen more strongly in Wolfgang; see Mozart and scatology. Anna Maria went on the series of tours (1762‚Äì1768) through Europe, during which the two children were exhibited as prodigies. She unwillingly remained in Salzburg with Nannerl during the tours of Italy that Wolfgang and Leopold took during 1769‚Äì1773. In 1777, she accompanied the now- adult Wolfgang (again unwillingly). From Mannheim she wrote Leopold telling him she was too old to take such a long journey. on a job-hunting tour that took him to Augsburg, Mannheim, and Paris. =Death= While in Paris she suddenly got sick and died on 3 July 1778 of an undiagnosed illness. She was buried in the cemetery of Saint-Eustache.

It flows from the Canadian Rockies to the city of Calgary, where it merges into the Bow River. The Elbow River is popular among canoers, rafters, campers and hikers and runs through several features including Allen Bill Pond, Forgetmenot Pond, and Elbow Falls. Sections of the river are closed to fishing, or are \\"catch-and- release\\" waters. The water flow of the Elbow River fluctuates significantly, and in June 2005 a flood occurred that was so severe (the heaviest in at least two centuries according to Alberta Government estimates) that the water flowed over the Glenmore Dam. Approximately 1,500 Calgarians living downstream were evacuated. Another, more extensive flood began on 20 June 2013, with tens of thousands of evacuations. 2013 floods The Elbow River flooding the Elbow Park neighborhood in Calgary on 21 June 2013 In June 2013, Alberta, Canada, experienced heavy rainfall that triggered catastrophic flooding throughout much of the southern half of the province along the Bow, Elbow, Highwood and Oldman rivers and tributaries. A dozen municipalities in Southern Alberta declared local states of emergency on June 20 as water levels rose and numerous communities were placed under evacuation orders. Course Elbow Falls on the upper course The Elbow River originates from Elbow Lake in the Elbow-Sheep Wildland Provincial Park in the Canadian Rockies, then continues through the Rocky Mountain foothills and flows into the hamlet of Bragg Creek. The Elbow River passes under Highway 22 and then travels through the rural community of Springbank and the Tsuu T'ina Nation 145 Indian reserve directly west of Calgary.

Founded in 2004, in 2005 the Genocide Intervention Fund changed its name to Genocide Intervention Network, and in 2011, it merged with the Save Darfur Coalition to form a new organization, United to End Genocide. History In October 2004, two Swarthmore College students, Mark Hanis and Andrew Sniderman, established the Genocide Intervention Network in hopes of empowering citizens to protect civilians from the atrocities occurring in Darfur. GI-Net's mission and policy goals were greatly influenced by the \\"Responsibility to Protect\\" doctrine, drafted by the International Commission on Intervention and State Sovereignty, in order to create a permanent anti-genocide grassroots movement. In 2011, GI- Net and the Save Darfur Coalition merged to establish United to End Genocide. =Supporting the African Mission in Sudan= Mark Hanis, Andrew Sniderman, Sam Bell, Cara Angelotta, Susannah Gund, Janessa Calvo-Friedman, Rita Kamani, Elisabeth Jaquette and others wanted the genocide in Sudan to be treated as a security issue, not as a humanitarian disaster, and did so by directly supporting the African Union Mission in Sudan (AMIS), an underfunded peacekeeping force. GI-Net's controversial idea of supporting military force for foreign intervention attracted the attention of Gayle Smith, who had two decades of experience in Africa and had been the senior director of African Affairs in Clinton's National Security Council. Smith provided the first positive interest in GI-Net's work. Smith helped GI-Net raise over $300,000 to support AMIS. After several disagreements on how to organize the fundraising money, GI-Net, in collaboration with the African Union, funded the Africa Humanitarian Action to support patrols that would protect displaced women, who put themselves at risk of rape when they left the internally displaced persons camps to collect firewood in order to prepare food. The program was canceled due to a lack of additional support and financial resources. =The Divestment Movement= In 2006, GI-Net looked for new methods to increase economic pressure on the Sudanese government. However, after the U.S. government had already maxed out the economic sanctions it could apply alone, GI-Net increased its involvement in the divestment campaign that had begun on Harvard's college campus in 2004. The goal behind the divestment campaign was simple: to engage students to pressure their universities to withdraw investments providing revenue to Sudanese government. This financial support allowed the Sudanese government to expand on their military assets. By April 2005, the student activism prompted college officials to change its investment policies. Harvard University declared that it would withdraw support in China National Petroleum Corporation, a business partner of the Sudanese government. Companies in the oil industry were the perfect target for divestment since oil is an essential source of revenue for the government, but is an industry that provides little benefit or relief to Sudanese civilians. By September 2006, the divestment movement grew substantially and adopted larger goals. The group eventually became known as the Sudan Divestment Task Force, which drafted legislation to influence state legislatures around the United States to divest. Feeling pressured by the U.S.-based advocacy campaign, the Khartoum spent close to a million dollars on an eight-page spread in the New York Times encouraging companies to invest in Sudan, a country with \\"peaceful, prosperous and democratic future\\". =Dream for Darfur= As the official Olympic torch made its way around the world prior to the beginning of the 2008 Summer Olympics, the Olympic Dream for Darfur team, a campaign to bring mass attention to the conflict in Darfur, began its own symbolic relay. The Dream for Darfur team had one and only goal: to convince China that the continuation of the Olympic Games in Beijing was at risk unless it withdrew support for Sudan's regime. Genocide survivors joined the relay led by Mia Farrow and traveled to Rwanda, Armenia, Germany, Bosnia, Herzegovina, and Cambodia. This led to the formation of a U.S.-based relay in September 2007. Jill Savitt and Mia Farrow organized and led the event, supported by GI-Net, the Save Darfur Coalition, and the Enough Project. The mission of the Dream for Darfur team was to break down the foreign policy information into digestible form, so that citizens, without the background to understand the complexities of the international policy-making process, could become involved in the anti- genocide campaign. The Dream for Darfur team encouraged the major sponsors of the Olympic Games, such as McDonald's, Anheuser-Busch, Microsoft, and Volkswagen to privately meet with Chinese officials to raise concern over affairs in Darfur. Eventually, the team encouraged Steven Spielberg to resign as creative consultant for the opening ceremonies. =Rebranding and reorganizing= In 2005, the organization changed its name from Genocide Intervention Fund to its current name, Genocide Intervention Network. GI-Net was publicly re-launched on April 6, 2005. GI-Net immediately broadened its efforts by introducing a membership and chapter program in order to educate and mobilize support for U.S. policies that could assist victims in Darfur. In 2011, the Save Darfur Coalition and GI-Net merged to create United to End Genocide. The organization's president is Tom Andrews. Advocacy Programs =Carl Wilkens Fellowship= GI-Net launched a program to build an engaged and permanent anti-genocide community. Named in honor of Carl Wilkens‚Äîthe only American to remain in Rwanda during the genocide in 1994‚Äîthe \\"Wilkens Fellowship\\" was a selective year-long program that exposed individuals to vital tools and resources in hopes of building permanent peaceful communities throughout the world. The program terminated in 2012 due to financial constraints. For more information about past fellowship recipients, visit: United to End Genocide =STAND: A Student Anti-Genocide Coalition= In 2004, a group of Georgetown University students created a campus community organization that focuses on genocide prevention. The program gained national recognition, and now colleges and universities across the United States host STAND chapters. STAND emerged as a grassroots-based campaign that networks students who are committed to ending crimes against humanity around the world. Since its debut, STAND developed as a key component in the anti-genocide movement alongside its previous parent organizations: the Genocide Intervention Network, which merged into United to End Genocide. In 2012, STAND became an independent organization, entirely student-run. =Sudan Divestment Task Force/Conflict Risk Network= Two college students co-founded the Sudan Divestment Task Force (SDTF) in 2005.Erin Kimura-Walsh and Walter Allen. \\"Globalization from Above: Globalization from Below, Mechanisms for Social Disparity and Social Justice in Higher Education in Rodney K. Hopson, Carol Camp Yeakey, Francis Musa Boakari, Power, Voice and the Public Good: Schooling and Education in Global Societies, (Bingley, UK: JAI Press) p. 220. The Task Force launched successful divestment campaigns around the world targeting university endowments, asset managers and city, state, and national investment policies. As a result of the Task Force efforts, twenty-two states, dozens of universities, eleven cities and fifteen countries adopted Sudan divestment policies. SDTF worked closely with Genocide Intervention Network, and in 2006 became part of GI-NET under the leadership of Adam Sterling, an original co- founder. The Sudan Divestment Task Force led to the enactment of the Sudan Accountability and Divestment Act (SADA) on December 31, 2007. As part of the campaign, the University of California, Brown, Amherst, Princeton, the University of Vermont, and the University of Washington are encouraging companies not to provide financial support to the Sudanese government. Instead, financial aid is given directly to the victims of the genocide. In 2009, SDTF became the Conflict Risk Network (CRN). Drawing upon successes in corporate engagement and the lessons learned from the Sudan divestment movement, the CRN calls on corporate actors to take steps towards responsible actions including acts that support peace and stability in areas affected by genocide and mass atrocities.

The first writers of the series were Brian Michael Bendis and Mark Millar for the first 6 issues. They were followed by Warren Ellis for 12 issues, Mike Carey for 2 issues before Mark Millar came back for a separate run of 13 issues, after which Carey came back for a longer run of 26 issues. The book ended with Joe Pokaski, writer of Heroes, for the remaining 3 issues, concluding through his Requiem story. Brian Michael Bendis and Mark Millar =The Fantastic (#1‚Äì6)= *Published between: February 2004 - July 2004 *Creators: writer Brian Michael Bendis, Mark Millar, artist Adam Kubert *Plot outline: A young Reed Richards is recruited by a government think-tank after they are affected by his experiments. *First appearances: Reed Richards, Susan Storm, Johnny Storm, Benjamin Grimm, Victor Van Damme *Notes: Putting H.E.R.B.I.E. into the Ultimate Fantastic Four continuity immediately was a chief concern of author Brian Michael Bendis. Warren Ellis =Doom (#7‚Äì12)= *Published between: August 2004 - January 2005 *Creators: writer Warren Ellis, artist Stuart Immonen *Plot outline: Reed and his friends must learn to adapt to their new situation. Victor Van Damme, also affected by the accident, decides to get revenge. *First appearances: *Notes: In issue #9, Doom, Part 3, artist Stuart Immonen's depiction of the Human Torch's increasing power was influenced by the energy ball that consumes Neo-Tokyo in the Japanese manga Akira. =N-Zone (#13‚Äì18)= *Published between: January 2005 - June 2005 *Creators: writer Warren Ellis, artist Adam Kubert *Plot outline: Issues #13-18 show the Ultimate Fantastic Four's first encounter with the bizarre and sadistic alien Nihil. Reed outfits a space shuttle, and the FF use it to travel to the N-Zone, a parallel universe experiencing heat death, an entropic state that signals the eventual end of that universe. Nihil follows them back to earth, and dies battling the FF and trying to take over the dimension. *First appearance: Nihil (based on Annihilus) *Notes: Artist Adam Kubert's depiction of Nihil's alien army closely resembles the Jawas from Star Wars, while their plasma weapons closely resemble the gaffi sticks of the Sand People. Mike Carey =Think Tank (#19‚Äì20)= *Published between: July 2005 - August 2005 *Creators: writer Mike Carey, artist Jae Lee *Plot outline:In issues #19-20 the Fantastic Four are attacked and kidnapped by Rhona Burchill, who failed the Baxter Building test the day before Reed arrived. Ben, Sue and Johnny are taken down, but Reed revives them. After a brief battle Rhona escapes using a sort of holographic duplication defense. Not knowing which is the true Rhona, the team has no choice other than to let her go. Later, Reed receives a strange contact from somebody that looks strangely like him. *First appearance: Rhona Burchill (based on the Mad Thinker) *Notes: Mark Millar returning = Ultimate Fantastic Four Annual #1: Enter the Inhumans= *Published: October 2005 *Creators: writer Mark Millar, artist Jae Lee *Plot outline:In the first Ultimate Fantastic Four Annual the Four run into the rogue Inhuman Crystal. Johnny sees her and instantly falls in love, similar to the Johnny and Crystal in the 616 continuity. She has run away from Attilan because she doesn't want to marry Maximus, brother of Black Bolt. The FF help her avoid the marriage, and she rewards Johnny with a kiss before the Inhumans depart. *First appearances: Inhumans: Black Bolt, Crystal, Maximus, Triton, Medusa, Karnak, Gorgon, Lockjaw *Notes: =Crossover (#21‚Äì23)= *Published between: September 2005 - November 2005 *Creators: writer Mark Millar, artist Greg Land *Plot outline:In issues #21-23 Reed receives contact from an older version of himself from an alternate dimension. After crossing over, Reed discovers he's been duped and it was instead an alternate Earth where all the superheroes became zombies. This storyline was promoted as a crossover with the mainstream Marvel Universe (Earth-616), which turned out to be a red herring. This led to the Marvel Zombies limited series, which started in December 2005. *Notes: =Tomb of Namor (#24‚Äì26) = *Published between: December 2005 - February 2006 *Creators: writer Mark Millar, artist Greg Land *Plot outline: Reed, Sue and Ben explore Atlantis in a bathyscaphe.

He leaves after threatening NY with a sea-giant; receiving a kiss from Sue as payment for not flooding the city. *First appearances: Namor *Notes: =President Thor (#27‚Äì29)= *Published between: April 2006 - June 2006 *Creators:writer Mark Millar, artist Greg Land *Plot outline:In issues #27-29 the Fantastic Four travel back in time and attempt to erase the accident which gave them their powers, inadvertently changing history so that Thor is the President of the United States and almost everyone on Earth has superpowers thanks to the Skrulls. Ben is the only unpowered human left, and he takes advantage of that fact to correct the timeline. *First appearances: Skrulls, Super-Skrull *Notes: In this storyline, the name \\"Chitauri\\" is retconned to be just the name of a faction within the Skrull race, as opposed to the name for the Skrull race as a whole. =Frightful (#30‚Äì32)= *Published between: July 2006 - October 2006 *Creators: writer Mark Millar, artist Greg Land *Plot outline:In issues #30-32 Johnny has one week to live, and only Doctor Doom can help him. Meanwhile, the Frightful Four escape. Ben spends time with Alicia, whom he met in issue #29. Doom has sickened Johnny, and he cures him in exchange for switching bodies with Reed. Dr. Doom battles the Frightful Four as well as exiling himself to the Zombie Universe along with the removed parasite from Jonny's body, and ends up battling the Zombie Galacti that just gained the powers of Galactus with the outcome of the fight unknown. *Notes: Due to Land's mistakes, Janet van Dyne is portrayed as being Caucasian, even though she is established to be of Asian descent in the Ultimate Marvel continuity, and wears one of her traditional Marvel 616 uniforms. Perhaps also due to Land's mistakes, Doom does not have his satyr-style legs, resembling \\"classic\\" Doctor Doom. This look is also in Ultimate Power, Ultimates 3, and Ultimatum.

Meanwhile, Molekevic is explaining his plans to the Think Tank and goes into a lengthy recollection of his childhood in Yugoslavia, his work with the Soviet military, his studies in western Europe, and his fondness for wearing women's clothing. The Think Tank children eventually chase away Molekevic, the Fantastic Four and the government officials, intending to recolonize the subterranean city. The final page implies that their reactivation of the artificial sun either awakens or attracts the various giant monsters and abominations hiding in the depths, which serve as a defense for the Think Tank children from the government coming back for them. =God War (#33‚Äì38)= *Published between: October 2006 - February 2007 *Creators: writer Mike Carey, artist Pasqual Ferry *Plot outline: Seed Nineteen show up and attack the FF while looking for \\"the seed.\\" The seed informs Seed Nineteen that they will need the FF's help to defeat Gallowglass, and the groups team up to do so. They are all transported to an alternate dimension, and interact with Thanos the Destroyer and Ronan the Accuser. *First appearances: Gallowglass, Seed Nineteen, Thanos, Ronan the Accuser *Notes: God War is a modern version of the 616 Fantastic Four's first encounter with the Kree.

It is Australia's leading gold mining company and its operations have expanded beyond Australia, for example Indonesia, thus becoming a prominent international mining corporation. Newmont Mining Corporation initially started the company as a subsidiary in 1966. The subsidiary became Newmont Holdings Pty Ltd. in 1980 and in 1990 acquired 100% of Australmin Holdings Ltd. taking the current name. Newcrest's primary gold and copper production in Australia is at Ridgeway (Cadia Valley Operations), the second Australian operation being the Telfer Mine in the Pilbara region of Western Australia. Newcrest also operates two mines in Papua New Guinea, Lihir and Hidden Valley, and one each in Ivory Coast (Bonikro) and Indonesia (Gosowong).Newcrest Mining Limited: Our business‚ÄîOperations. Accessed 5 April 2016. Past and present exploration was done in the Americas, Asia and Europe. In April 2010, Newcrest announced it was in merger talks with Lihir Gold, a move that would create the world's fifth-largest gold producer, with a combined production of 2.8 million ounces of gold in 2009.Newcrest Proposed Combination with Lihir Newcrest website, published: 1 April 2010, accessed: 9 May 2010 In August 2010, the deal was approved by Lihir shareholders (99.86%), and by the end of the month by the national court of Papua New Guinea (PNG), clearing the way for the deal. Under the deal worth US$9.45 billion, Newcrest will give Lihir shareholders 0.12 Newcrest shares, plus A$0.225 per Lihir share. As of 2015, Newcrest was the world's sixth-largest producer of gold. Background Newmont Mining Corporation was founded in 1921 in New York by Colonel William Thompson as a holding company to invest in worldwide mineral, oil, and relations companies. The Newmont name is an abbreviation of where Thompson lived and worked; New York and Montana. Newmont is now the world's second-largest gold producer. The Newmont Mining Corporation began an Australian subsidiary in 1966 and by 1971 they claimed to have discovered Telfer. In 1980 the subsidiary became Newmont Holdings Pty Ltd and was based in Victoria, Australia. Seven years later it was listed on the Australian Stock Exchange as Newmont Australia Limited. When in 1990 the company acquired 100% of Australmin Holdings Ltd and 92% of BHP Gold Mines Ltd, it acquired its current company name. Newcrest's primary focus was within Australia until 1991, when it commenced exploration overseas. Newcrest was determined to become a significant and internationally recognized gold mining and exploration company. The company established exploration offices and new companies offshore in Jakarta, Indonesia, and Chile, South America. In 1992, exploration discovered its first offshore gold in the Halmahera Islands, Indonesia. And in 1996, Newcrest stated that the company wished to transform itself into a world-scale and internationally recognized producer. In 2002, years of exploration around Australia and overseas were paying dividends and the Newcrest group was capitalized at over $2 billion. After restarting gold mining activities in Cracow, Queensland, in a 70:30 joint venture with Sedimentary Holdings in 2004, Newcrest sold its shares in this operation when Catalpa Resources, which had meanwhile acquired Sedimentary Holdings, merged with Conquest Mining in 2011 to form Evolution Mining Limited.Catalpa Resources and Conquest Mining unite to form top five Australian gold producer, accessed 5 April 2016.Newcrest Mining Limited: About Us‚ÄîHistory, accessed 5 April 2016. In addition to its primary listing on the Australian Stock Exchange, Newcrest Mining stock is also traded on the Port Moresby Stock Exchange in Papua New Guinea (since 2010) and the Toronto Stock Exchange in Canada (2012-14 and since 2020). Industry development The discovery of gold has been a major contributor to Australia's economy and infrastructure. Gold mining provided transportation, communication, road and rail and raw material for export around the colonies. This was especially prominent after 1851 in the Victorian goldfields. In the past, Australia has exported gold to the US and Europe, however over time the traditional consumers have changed. When alluvial gold deposits were exhausted in the 1800s, deeper mines were necessary. Working deep veins necessitated deep shafts, machinery and treatment plants, consequently this required investment. Individual miners were replaced by companies, employing dozens or even hundreds of men. Technology and mapping made gold exploration more accurate and efficient. Australia was seen to have very large mineral resources. This development, together with Australia's political stability, led to an influx of major overseas mining companies, such as Newmont, in the 1960s. The emergence of Japan as a major buyer of minerals, combined with technological advances in ore separation, saw a shift in many mines from uneconomic production to sustainable production. By the mid-1980s, one of the few productive mining industries in Australian was gold mining because its price had been fixed since World War II. Other factors lifted the production in gold, such as the development of the efficient carbon-in-pulp method for recovering very fine- grained and low-grade gold. It became feasible to mine entire zones of gold- bearing veins via open cut or underground mining instead of only main veins. In the 1990s, there was a period of consolidation with extensive focus on further improving efficiency and safety of operations and movement towards globalisation; customers of minerals and metals became more diverse. During this period, the industry continued to be a major source of export income for the Australian economy, despite far-reaching changes in world mineral production and consumption patterns. India and China recently became the top importers of Australian gold because it continues to function extremely well as an inflation hedge. Furthermore, environmental and social concerns in relation to the mining industry have become global with the widespread uptake of new communication technologies. From a corporate perspective, the Australian mining industry grew beyond being a large national sector into a world player. The industry is now diversified and integrated internationally through its exploration, mining and processing activities, and the supply of information technology, engineering, construction and other services. Annual surveys by the Minerals Council of Australia show that from the mid- to late-1990s, respondents spent over 40% of their total exploration budgets overseas. The industry is also making a wide range of major investments in overseas mines and forging international marketing and processing alliances in regard to many minerals and metals. However, investment has also flowed in the other direction, with significant overseas investment in Australia for exploration and the development or expansion of mining and processing facilities. Operations  Newcrest's mining operations are located around Australia, Indonesia, Ivory Coast, and Papua New Guinea. The Telfer Mine is a large open cut and underground mine in the Pilbara region of Western Australia. The mine has the potential to become the largest gold mine in Australia, with expected average production of 800,000 ounces (25,000 kg) of gold per year. Ridgeway is a large underground gold and copper mine being developed by Newcrest. In its first full year of operation and metal production of 377,539 ounces (11,742.8 kg) of gold was in line with the plan. Development of the Cadia Hill mine in New South Wales began in 1996 and production began in 1998. It produces 298,848 ounces (9,295.2 kg) of gold per year. Gosowong, Indonesia, is an open pit mine opened in 1999. It is 75% owned by Newcrest, and the rest is owned by joint venture partner Pt Nusa Halmahera Minerals. The mine has produced 772,018 ounces (24,012.4 kg) of gold and 812,815 ounces (25,281.4 kg) of silver over the first five years of production. Hidden Valley is an open-pit, gold-silver mine and processing plant in Morobe Province, Papua New Guinea. The mine is approximately 210 km north-north-west of Port Moresby, and 90 km south-southwest of Lae. It is operated by Morobe Mining Joint Ventures, a 50:50 joint venture between Harmony and Newcrest Mining. Newcrest's second Papua New Guinea mine is the gold mine located on Lihir Island in the New Ireland Province of Papua New Guinea. It was acquired by taking over Lihir Gold Ltd. in 2010 (see above). Newcrest owns 89.89% of the Bonikro gold mine in Ivory Coast. It is located 250 km from the nation's capital Abidjan. In December 2010, Newcrest announced that work at this mine had been suspended due to the controversial election in C√¥te d'Ivoire. Newcrest's headquarters are located in Melbourne, Australia since having been integrated with Sydney in 1995. Other offices are based at major mine sites to help communication between miners and the head office. A majority of Newcrest's copper-gold concentrate is sold under long-term contract to smelters in Japan. Feed for the Saganoseki Smelter and Refinery is transported to Japan's southernmost island, Kyushu, and the concentrate is turned into 99.99% pure gold bullion which is sold to Asia's metal market. However, Newcrest also operates in the sale of concentrate to merchants who deliver the material to various regional smelters under their own contracts. Criticism The company has been accused of human rights violations and accelerating environmental damage particularly on Halmahera Island in Indonesia.https://www.foe.org.au/media-releases/2004-media- release/newcrest%E2%80%99s-indonesian-mining-violations-challenged See also * Jean-Paul Turcaud References External links * *Mineral Policy Institute: Halmahera Mining companies of Australia Gold mining companies of Australia Companies based in Melbourne Non-renewable resource companies established in 1980 1980 establishments in Australia Companies listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange Companies listed on the Australian Securities Exchange ","title":"Newcrest Mining"},{"id":"1798584","text":"Gansevoort may refer to any one of the following: People *Guert Gansevoort (1812‚Äì1868), US Navy officer *Harmen Harmense Gansevoort (ca. 1634‚Äì1709), early American settler, landowner and beer brewer *Leonard Gansevoort (1751‚Äì1810), New York politician *Peter Gansevoort (1749‚Äì1812), Continental Army officer in the Revolutionary War *Peter Gansevoort (politician) (1788‚Äì1876), New York politician Places *Gansevoort Market, another name for the Meatpacking District, Manhattan *Gansevoort, New York, a hamlet in Saratoga County, New York *Gansevoort Peninsula, another name for Thirteenth Avenue (Manhattan) *Gansevoort Street, a street in the Meatpacking District, Manhattan Other * , United States Navy destroyer in World War II ","title":"Gansevoort"},{"id":"1798592","text":"thumb Vehicular cycling (also known as bicycle driving) is the practice of riding bicycles on roads in a manner that is in accordance with the principles for driving in traffic, and in a way that places responsibility for safety on the individual. The phrase vehicular cycling was coined by John Forester in the 1970s. In his book Effective Cycling, Forester contends that \\"Cyclists fare best when they act and are treated as drivers of vehicles\\". These techniques have been adopted by the League of American Bicyclists and other organizations teaching safe riding courses for cyclists. As a method for strong and confident riders to cope with fast motor traffic, many recommendations of vehicular cycling are widely applied. Vehicular cycling has at times been controversial, particularly on larger roads not designed for bikes. Technique A vehicular cyclist is one that travels within the roadway in accordance with the basic vehicular rules of the road that are shared by all drivers and adhering to traffic controls. Vehicular cyclists, Forester advises, should feel and act like vehicle drivers, and should smoothly and safely flow with other vehicles. In Effective Cycling, Forester introduced what he calls \\"the five basic principles of cycling in traffic\\". * Ride on the road, with the direction of traffic. * Yield to crossing traffic at junctions with larger roads. * Yield to traffic in any lane you are moving to, or when you are moving laterally on the road. * Position yourself appropriately at junctions when turning ‚Äî near the curb when turning off the road on the side you are travelling on, near the center line when turning across the other side of the road, and in the center when continuing straight on. * Ride in a part of the road appropriate to your speed; typically, faster traffic is near the center line. =Lane control= The Bicycles May Use Full Lane sign in the US Federal Highway Administration's Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices may be used when lanes are too narrow for safe vehicle-bicycle side-by-side sharing This sign indicates that there is not sufficient space for safe vehicle-bicycle side-by-side sharing Shared Lane Marking, called a Sharrow, which has a similar function to the message shown above Lane control is the practice of controlling a lane (also known as \\"using the full lane\\" or \\"taking the lane\\") to enhance safety. Controlling the lane is asserting control of the space one needs to be much more conspicuous (as compared to riding relatively inconspicuously near the road edge) to traffic ahead as well as behind, to be further from edge hazards, to preclude another vehicle from passing dangerously close within the same lane, and encouraging drivers of overtaking vehicles to change lanes when they pass. =Lane sharing= Due to the relatively narrow nature of bicycles, road lanes are sometimes wide enough to allow them to safely share lanes side by side with motor vehicles. In lanes where this is possible, vehicular cycling suggests riding about to the outside of overtaking traffic and about the same distance from roadside hazards such as the gutter seam. Cyclists can also filter forward past stopped motor traffic. Where they exist, wide outside lanes may also be shared in order to facilitate being overtaken by faster traffic.http://www.humantransport.org/bicycledriving/library/wol_width.pdf When riding in a lane sharing position, vehicular cycling specifies that cyclists must yield to overtaking traffic using the other part of the lane, or obtain right-of-way to move over through negotiation before moving laterally into that space. =Speed and destination positioning= Vehicular cyclists use \\"speed positioning\\" between intersections. The basic principle is \\"slower traffic keeps to the outside; faster traffic to the inside\\". When lanes are marked, vehicular cyclists generally operate in the outermost travel lane. When lanes are not marked, vehicular cyclists generally operate as far to the outside of the traveled way as is reasonably efficient and safe. As vehicular cyclists approach a junction of ways, the principle of \\"destination positioning\\" comes into play, and they should position themselves laterally according to their destination (left, straight or right): * Where lanes are marked, vehicular cyclists approaching a junction should choose the outermost lane that serves their destination. * When lanes are not marked, vehicular cyclists approaching a junction will travel along the inside of their side of the road if turning toward the inside, along the outer side if turning to the outside, and in between if going straight. Vehicular cyclists do not avoid riding in bicycle lanes, rather they decide whether to ride in the space demarcated as a bike lane based on their own judgement about safety. They are also advised to stay outside of the door zone; when passing motor vehicles that are parked parallel to the road, no closer than the largest estimated width of an open door, plus some margin for error. The cycling skills manual Cyclecraft, the foundation of Bikeability, the UK's national standard for cycle training, defines the terms primary riding position, where the cyclist will be more visible and predictable to motor vehicle traffic, as being in the center of the traffic lane, and secondary riding position as being to the side of moving traffic, but not closer than from the edge of the road. It states that it is sensible to use the primary riding position as the normal position, only using the secondary riding position when it is safe, reasonable, and necessary to allow faster traffic to pass. On multi-lane roadways, some vehicular cyclists ride on the inside of the outermost lane (on the side furthest from the road edge in the lane nearest the road edge), for enhanced visibility to motor vehicle traffic. This position may be indicated by road markings. =Looking back= Cyclists should always be looking back over their shoulders as an essential skill, in order to # maintain awareness of other vehicles on the road # safely navigate and merge with other traffic # broadcast the cyclist's desire (to move laterally or turn) to other road users so that they can better predict the cyclist's path # see if someone who's overtaking is about to make a mistake and enter the cyclist's path Particularly in slow traffic, a cyclist's look to the rear may serve as a signal, allowing the cyclist to keep both hands on the handlebar. However, a cyclist may also use a hand signal (arm extended to the side) to request that an overtaking driver make room. The cyclist then follows up with a second look to the rear to assure that the driver has made room. =Negotiation= Negotiation is a technique for cyclists to safely traverse one or more lanes by merging in with the flow of other traffic. The basic method is to negotiate for the use of the adjacent lane, move into that lane, and then repeat the process for any additional lanes. The cyclist moves only when there is a natural gap in motor traffic to move into, or after someone slows down explicitly to allow them to move over. The steps of the process for each lane change are: # Look back for traffic that may be overtaking in the target lane. # Wait for a sufficient gap to change lanes. Ideally, make eye contact with the other driver and use a hand signal to request an approaching driver in the target lane to yield right of way by slowing down and leaving unoccupied space in the lane in front of them. # Move into the lane and control it.  Praise  Some have claimed that transportation engineers in the US have become too focused on separating cyclists from pedestrians and motorists. According to an Institute of Transportation Engineers Journal piece by Martin Pion, the implementation of bike lanes can limit competent cyclists perceptions of where it is permitted to cycle. He also notes some sport cyclists prefer to ride in lane, compared with a parallel path, because it reduces the risk of collision with side turning motorists assuming there is not a strong separation of road users. Criticism The movement surrounding vehicular cycling has also been criticized for its effect on bicycle advocacy in general. In Pedaling Revolution, Jeff Mapes states that Forester \\"fought bike lanes, European-style cycletracks, and just about any form of traffic calming\\", and \\"saw nothing wrong with sprawl and an auto-dependent lifestyle.\\" Zack Furness is highly critical of vehicular cyclists in One Less Car: Bicycling and the Politics of Automobility, arguing that their criticism of 'political' cyclists \\"totally ignores all the relevant socioeconomic, physical, material, and cultural factors that influence‚Äîand in most cases dictate‚Äîeveryday transportation choices.\\" Critical Mass co-founder Chris Carlsson describes vehicular cycling as a na√Øve, polarizing \\"ideology\\" that \\"essentially advocates bicyclists should strive to behave like cars on the streets of America.\\" The makeup of vehicular cycling advocates as a group in the United States was criticized in the 1990s for being typically club cyclists that are well educated, upper- middle income or wealthy, suburban, and white, representing a social and economic elite that are able to dominate public discussions of cycle planning issues. Vehicular cyclists have also been disproportionately male. In the US, males make up 88% of total cyclist fatalities. = Distracted driving = The rise of cell phone distracted driving has increased the chance that if a motorist is drifting into a shoulder or bike lane, it is because they aren‚Äôt paying attention. Accordingly, if a cyclist attempts to ride where a motorist is drifting in order to ‚Äòreclaim their right of way‚Äô, it is likely that they won‚Äôt be seen. Citing the rise in US crash fatalities, David Dudley at CityLab wrote, ‚Äùthe swift erosion of America‚Äôs driving abilities is yet another reason to admit that the cause of ‚Äúvehicular cycling‚Äù‚Äîthe safe-biking philosophy that says bikes should ride assertively rather than cower at the side of the road‚Äîis increasingly compromised by reality.‚Äù = Anger between vehicular cyclists and drivers = In the blog Shifter, Tom Babin noted the sharing of road lanes through vehicular cycling was supposed to cause an increased level of mutual understanding between motorists and cyclists. ‚ÄúWhat happened instead was some hearty bicycle lovers adopted the tenets of vehicular cycling in the way they got around cities‚Ä¶ They asserted their rights to the road, and made those cross-traffic left-hand turns that make less confident cyclists gasp in horror. All of which pissed off those drivers who thought they owned the road.‚Äù As such, Babin believes vehicular cycling has failed to bring about its intended result. Yet, the part of the theory that encourages bikes to be forceful lives on through the actions of its remaining followers. =Segregated cycling as an alternative= Segregated cycle facilities Segregated cycle facilities exist in some areas, allowing cycling without sharing roads with motorized traffic. Cities that are structured that way report a high degree of bicycle usage and low injury rates, such as in the Netherlands. A 2001 study in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada concluded that cyclists found 1 minute of cycling in mixed traffic as onerous as 4.1 minutes on bike lanes or 2.8 minutes on bike paths. A study of cyclists in Washington D.C. found that cyclists were willing to spend on average 20.38 extra minutes per trip to travel on an off-street bicycle trail when the alternative was riding on a street with parked cars. Forester believes segregated cycle facilities to be more dangerous than on-road cycling due to increase risk from crossing conflicts and that, in the case of sidepaths, they can only be used safely by cycling \\"very slowly\\". Urban planning professor John Pucher writes that \\"Forester makes a number of theoretical arguments why bikeways are unsafe.\\" Forester objects to rejection of his test results. Pucher's various transnational studies of bicycle transportation lead him to conclude that \\"the overwhelming evidence is that cycling is much safer and more popular precisely in those countries where bikeways, bike lanes, special intersection modifications, and priority traffic signals are the key to their bicycling policies.\\" The authors of a 2009 meta-study on cycle infrastructure safety research at the University of British Columbia similarly conclude that \\"in comparison to cycling on bicycle-specific infrastructure (paths, lanes, routes), on-road cycling appears to be less safe.\\" Forester objects to Pucher's conclusions, primarily on the grounds that Pucher ascribes the increase in use of bikes and bike safety observed to the bikeways without showing that the bikeways are the actual cause of the increased use or safety. Jennifer Dill and Theresa Carr's research on bicycle transportation in 35 U.S. cities also suggests that \\"higher levels of bicycle infrastructure are positively and significantly correlated with higher rates of bicycle commuting\\"; and a 2010 study comparing streets in Copenhagen that had had cycle tracks and bicycle lanes added to them found that cycling volume increased 20%. However, on the cycle track streets bicycle accidents increased 10% more than would be expected from the changed bicycle and automobile traffic volumes, making the cycle tracks less safe for cyclists than the unmodified roads. Streets with bicycle lanes added saw a 5% increase in bicycle traffic but a 49% increase in bicycle accidents. Despite this, the study notes that \\"the gains in health from increased physical activity [from increased numbers cycling are] much, much greater than the losses in health resulting from a slight decline in road safety.\\" Although prior studies did not differentiate between new bike riders and those that had changed routes due to the new facility, recent research has shown that the greater level of protection, the greater number of new bike riders (as opposed to riders who used the route before construction or shifted routes).

Biography He was born at San Giorgio Canavese in Piedmont. He studied medicine at the University of Turin, and obtained his doctors degree when about twenty years old. Having rendered himself obnoxious to the government during the political commotions that followed the French Revolution, he was imprisoned for over a year; and on his release in 1795 he withdrew to France, only to return to his native country as a surgeon in the French army, whose progress he followed as far as Venice. Here he joined the expedition to Corfu, from which he did not return to Italy till 1798. At first he favored French policy in Italy, contributed to the annexation of Piedmont by France in 1799, and was an admirer of Napoleon; but he afterwards changed his views, realizing the necessity for the union of all Italians and for their freedom from foreign control. This work in turn cites: *C. Dionisiotti, Vita di Carlo Botta (Turin, 1867) *C. Pavesio, Carlo Botta e le sue opere storiche (Florence, 1874) *Scipione Botta, Vita privata di Carlo Botta (Florence, 1877) *A. d'Ancona e O. Bacci, Manuela della Letteratura Italiana (Florence, 1894), vol. v. pp. 245 seq. After the separation of Piedmont from France in 1814, he retired into private life, but, fearing persecution at home, became a French citizen. In 1817 he was appointed rector of the University of Rouen, but in 1822 was removed owing to clerical influence. Amid all the vicissitudes of his early manhood Botta had never allowed his pen to be long idle, and in the political quiet that followed 1816 he naturally devoted himself more exclusively to literature. Botta was elected a member of the American Antiquarian Society in 1821.American Antiquarian Society Members Directory In 1824 he published a history of Italy from 1789 to 1814 (4 vols.), on which his fame principally rests; he himself had been an eyewitness of many of the events described. His continuation of Guicciardini, which he was afterwards encouraged to undertake, is a careful and laborious work, but is not based on original authorities and is of small value. Though living in Paris, he was in both these works the ardent exponent of that recoil against everything French which took place throughout Europe. A careful exclusion of all Gallicisms, as a reaction against the French influences of the day, is one of the marked features of his style, which is not infrequently impassioned and eloquent, though at the same time cumbrous, involved and ornate.  Death  Botta died at Paris on 10 August 1837, in comparative poverty, but in the enjoyment of an extensive and well-earned reputation. Family His son, Paul-√âmile Botta (1802‚Äì1870), was a distinguished traveller and Assyrian archaeologist, whose excavations at Khorsabad (1843) were among the first efforts in the line of investigation afterwards pursued by Layard.

He is best known for his time with the New York Mets from - and was a member of their 1986 World Series-winning team. He was also the former manager for the Las Vegas 51s, the Mets' AAA minor league team, from 2013 to 2016. He served as the bench coach for the Pericos de Puebla of the Mexican Baseball League in 2017. He is currently the manager of the Long Island Ducks of the Atlantic League of Professional Baseball. Playing career =New York Mets= First round pick Backman was the Mets' first round pick in the 1977 Major League Baseball draft (sixteenth overall). He was assigned to the New York‚ÄìPenn League's Little Falls Mets upon signing, and batted .325 with six home runs in his first professional season. After batting .293 for the triple A Tidewater Tides in , Backman received a September call up to the Mets. Making his major league debut starting at second base against the Los Angeles Dodgers at Dodger Stadium on September 2, Backman got a single in his first at-bat, driving in Claudell Washington for his first major league run batted in. After battling for three seasons to earn a starting job, Backman finally emerged as the Mets' starting second baseman in . He batted .280, and finished second on the club to Mookie Wilson (46) with 32 stolen bases. 1986 Prior to the start of the season, general manager Frank Cashen brought in Tim Teufel, a right-handed hitting infielder from the Minnesota Twins for Billy Beane, Joe Klink and Bill Latham. He and Backman formed a platoon at second base, and along with Wilson and Lenny Dykstra, provided a \\"spark\\" at the top of the Mets' line up, and set the table for the heavy hitters who batted behind them. For his own part, Backman scored 67 runs, stole 13 bases and batted over .300 (.320) for the first time in his career for the team that won 108 games and took the National League East by 21.5 games. He batted .333 in the World Series against the Boston Red Sox and led off for the Mets in the now famous tenth inning of Game 6 with a fly out to Jim Rice. 1988 Backman and Teufel were still platooning at second base in when the Mets won their division for the second time during Backman's tenure with the team. Backman batted .303 for the division winners, and the Mets won 100 games that season, taking the NL East by fifteen games over the Pittsburgh Pirates. However, the heavily favored Mets lost to the Los Angeles Dodgers in the 1988 National League Championship Series. Backman played respectably in the division series (.273 avg., 2 runs, 2 RBIs). However, following the season, the Mets sent him and Mike Santiago to the Minnesota Twins for Jeff Bumgarner, Steve Gasser and Toby Nivens, none of whom emerged as a major leaguer. =Pittsburgh Pirates= Backman under-performed with the Twins, batting only .231 with one home run and 33 runs scored while driving in only 26 in . After only one season in Minnesota, Backman signed as a free agent with the Mets' division rivals, the Pittsburgh Pirates. With slick fielder Jos√© Lind already at second base for the Pirates, Backman received most of his playing time backing up Jeff King at third. The Pirates opened the against the Mets at Shea Stadium. In front of his former home crowd, Backman went two for five with a single and triple and scored two runs in the Pirates' 12-3 victory over the Mets. Against the San Diego Padres on April 27, Backman accomplished the rare feat of six hits in a nine inning game. For the season, Backman batted .292 and scored 62 runs for a Pirates team that went 95-67, and took the division by four games over the Mets. =1991‚Äì1993= Backman spent and with the Philadelphia Phillies.

Backman had a career .980 fielding percentage at second base. Managing career Wally Backman as manager of the Binghamton Mets After retiring as a player, Backman was inducted into the Oregon Sports Hall of Fame in 2002. In 1998, Backman managed the Bend Bandits of Bend, Oregon during their final season of operations in the Western Baseball League. They finished 2nd in the North Division at 43-46.Bend Bandits https://www.baseball-reference.com/bullpen/Bend_Bandits Backman led the 2002 Birmingham Barons (Chicago White Sox double A Southern League affiliate) to a 79‚Äì61 record. In 2004, he led the Lancaster JetHawks, the Arizona Diamondbacks High A team, to an 86‚Äì54 record and was named Sporting News \\"Minor League Manager of the Year\\". On November 1, 2004, Backman was promoted to manager of the Arizona Diamondbacks' major league squad. However, in its story about Backman's hire, The New York Times reported that Backman had serious legal and financial problems. He had been arrested in 1999 for DUI in Kennewick, Washington as documented on HBO Real Sports with Bryant Gumbel. A year later, he was arrested in connection with an altercation in his home in Prineville, Oregon. In addition, Backman declared bankruptcy to avoid paying over twenty creditors, including the IRS. The Diamondbacks initially stood by him, but fired him on November 5, just four days after his hiring. Managing partner Ken Kendrick admitted that the Diamondbacks had not fully vetted Backman before hiring him. He added that the Diamondbacks only learned about the extent of Backman's problems when the Times report prompted the team to conduct its own investigation, which revealed that Backman had misled team officials about his past. Backman began his managerial comeback with the South Georgia Peanuts of the independent South Coast League. His return to managing was documented by the TV series Playing for Peanuts. The Peanuts won their league with a 59‚Äì28 record. The South Georgia Peanuts then went on to win the league championship that season under Backman's leadership. In December 2007, Backman became manager of the Joliet JackHammers.

Two weeks later, the Mets changed their minds, and Backman was handed the reins to the Brooklyn Cyclones instead. Backman went on to lead the Cyclones to a league-best 51-24 record, winning the McNamara Division of the New York‚ÄìPenn League by 12 games. However, the Cyclones were ultimately swept by the Tri-City ValleyCats in the league championship series. Backman was a candidate to replace Jerry Manuel as the New York Mets' major league manager in 2011, having interviewed for the position with new General Manager Sandy Alderson. After a second round of interviews in which Backman was a finalist, however, the position went to Terry Collins. Backman was subsequently named manager of the Mets' double A affiliate, the Binghamton Mets. In Backman's first season in Binghamton, the club had a 65-76 record. Backman remained highly regarded in the Mets organization, and was promoted to manager of their AAA affiliate, the Buffalo Bisons for the 2012 season. In 2013, Backman managed the Mets' new AAA affiliate, the Las Vegas 51s, leading them to an 81-63 record and winning the Pacific Coast League's Pacific South Division title. Las Vegas lost to Salt Lake three-games-to-one in the Conference Championship Series. Backman returned to the 51s for the 2014 season, and the team once again advanced to the playoffs. On August 29, 2014, Backman was announced as the PCL Manager of the Year. Backman resigned from the Las Vegas 51s on September 12, 2016. However, in later interviews, Backman claims that he was forced out as manager, and received phone calls telling him that he'd be fired if he didn't resign. Backman told sportswriter Bob Klapisch that the Mets were angered at his perceived mishandling of two top Mets prospects, Michael Conforto and Brandon Nimmo. He also believed that general manager Sandy Alderson and owner Fred Wilpon believed him too independent-minded and outspoken for their liking.http://www.northjersey.com/story/sports/columnists/bob- klapisch/2017/01/10/klapisch-backman-says-mets-have-blackballed-him/96415678/ Spending the winter getting turned down by many clubs, Backman became convinced that Mets GM Sandy Alderson had \\"blackballed\\" him, and said a friend had tipped him off that Alderson was working against him. Alderson declined to respond to Backman's allegation, although a member of the organization insisted that despite their differences, Alderson would never go as far as to deliberately sabotage Backman.http://www.northjersey.com/story/sports/columnists/bob- klapisch/2017/01/10/klapisch-backman-says-mets-have-blackballed-him/96415678/ In 2017, Backman signed on as manager of the Acereros de Monclova of the Mexican Baseball League. On May 19, 2017, 42 games into the season, Backman was fired. Shortly after, Backman was hired as the bench coach for the Pericos de Puebla. Backman was named manager of the New Britain Bees of the Atlantic League of Professional Baseball for the 2018 season on November 17th, 2017.http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/baseball/wally-backman-hired-manager- independent-new-britain-bees-article-1.3637638 On November 28, 2018, Backman was announced as the new manager of the Atlantic League's Long Island Ducks for the 2019 season.

The band experimented with a variety of sounds and genres, particularly grunge, funk and psychedelic rock. The band consisted of Scott Hunter (vocals), Jesse Sprinkle (drums), Aaron Sprinkle (guitar), and Nick Barber (bass). Hunter was the lyricist who wrote on philosophical, metaphorical, and spiritually oriented topics. Common themes in the lyrics include introspective struggles with identity and spirituality, struggles with a superficial, secular, and modern society, and hope for life abundant. The Encyclopedia of Contemporary Christian Music calls the band \\"One of the most accomplished and creative Christian bands of the '90s\\". The name refers to The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, in which Lucy ('Lu'), returns from Narnia and tells her brother, Peter. Peter doesn't believe her story, however, and responds patronizingly, \\"Poor old Lu, hiding and nobody noticed.\\" History While sophomores in high school, Barber, Aaron Sprinkle, and Hunter started a band called \\"Bellbangvilla,\\" composed an album named 'In Love with the Greenery,' and performed shows around the Seattle, WA area. A few months later, Jesse Sprinkle joined the group, and the band changed its name to Poor Old Lu, and recorded its first album under the new band name, entitled Three Song Demo. In the spring of 1992, they recorded their first full-length release, Star-Studded-Super-Step in three days in an empty classroom in their church. The Sprinkle's father gave the recording to Randy Stonehill, who in turn passed it on to Terry Taylor, who approached Frontline/Alarma Records. In the summer in 1993, the band recorded Mindsize. This album, produced by Terry Taylor and Derri Daugherty, turned out to be their breakthrough. The following summer, the band recruited engineer/producer John Goodmanson, and Sin was recorded and released in 1994. In late spring of 1995, Poor Old Lu recorded the Straight Six EP (which featured Jeremy Enigk of Sunny Day Real Estate on one track). In early spring of 1996, Poor Old Lu recorded A Picture of the Eighth Wonder. In late 1996 the band broke up, playing their farewell concert in Seattle, Washington in November 1996. This concert was recorded and in 1998 was released as In Their Final Performance. In 2002 the band reunited and recorded The Waiting Room for Tooth and Nail Records. In support of this release the band reunited for a number of shows in 2002, playing at select venues in Seattle as well as a few select Christian music festivals that included Cornerstone, TomFest and Purple Door. After Poor Old Lu After the group's initial break-up, band members moved on to independent projects. In 1997 Nick Barber joined with Aaron Sprinkle in the group Rose Blossom Punch. Nick Barber played in the bands Meekin Pop and Blue Collar Love. By the time Rose Blossom Punch split up, Aaron Sprinkle had started a solo career,. He has release 7 albums since 1999. In 2005 Aaron Sprinkle formed the band Fair with Joey Sanchez, Nick Barber and Erik Newbill. Jesse Sprinkle moved to New York. He ran the recording studio the Illuminata in Dansville, New York until early 2006, when the studio closed. He opened a new studio, Bluebrick Recordings, in 2007. He has played drums in a number of bands, including Morella's Forest, Demon Hunter and Dead Poetic. He has also recorded a number of solo albums. In a December 2006 update on the Poor Old Lu website Hunter announced he had started a new band, This Diminishing West. While the band promised a debut sometime in early 2007, the band broke up after releasing an EP online. Post-2002 reunions Poor Old Lu reunited in 2011 for an acoustic house show. In 2013 the group gathered to record one song, \\"The Great Unwound\\". It was written and released in support of \\"Paradise Uganda\\", a ministry of Jesse Sprinkle. No statements about future releases were made. In 2014 the group recorded a Christmas song with Vekora: \\"The Brightest Star\\".

He was the son of Alice Jean McCullough and Hugh Milner Black. He became a world-famous aviator when he and C. W. A. Scott won the London to Melbourne Centenary Air Race in 1934. Early years Tom Campbell Black attended Brighton College and the records for the period summer 1915 to summer 1917 indicate that he entered Hampden House, May 1915, was appointed House Prefect, January 1917 and played Second XI Football, 1915 to 1916 and 1916 to 1917. Campbell Black attended Army Class II and entered the RN College at Greenwich and attained a commission in the R.N.A.S. (Naval Air Service). He served first as a pilot in the Naval Air Service and later in the RAF during the Great War, rising to the rank of Captain. Arriving in Africa as a soldier settler in 1922, he joined his brother, Frank Milner Black, who had been stationed as a soldier in Kenya and decommissioned in 1920.Tom Campbell Black Black family history has it that Tom and his brother managed a coffee plantation in British East Africa, in the 1920s. Their farm was between the towns of Rongai and Eldama Ravine, in the Rift Valley, about northwest of Nairobi. Tom was a noted horseman who was an award-winning show jumper, winning a competition in 1925. He later bred and raised race horses, which remained a passion of his throughout his life. It is stated in the Shuttleworth Collection Records, England, that an aircraft currently in their collection, a de Havilland DH.51, was built in 1925 and shortly after John Evans Carberry bought and shipped it to Mombasa. The DH.51 first flew in Africa on 4 April 1926. In June 1928, Tom Campbell Black, G. Skinner and A. Hughes bought the aircraft and on 10 September 1928, it became the first aircraft to be registered in Kenya. Named Miss Kenya, it was first registered G-KAA, but with the change in the registration system, it was re-registered VP-KAA. Wilson Airways After flying with Campbell Black in February 1929, Florence Kerr Wilson was encouraged by his enthusiasm to form Wilson Airways Ltd., in Kenya. At inception later in the same year, her airline possessed a single Gypsy Moth aircraft, primarily piloted by Campbell Black. The airline grew into a comprehensive air carrier across Kenya. Captain Hugo Dunkerley, the Editor of Aeroken and the Special Correspondent of the East African Standard, accompanied Campbell Black in the first flight from Nairobi to Mombasa and back in a single day, on 21 November 1929. He also accompanied Tom in November 1930 on a roundtrip flight from Nairobi to Dar es Salaam, Mombasa, and back to Nairobi in just over nine hours. Tom Campbell Black was the Managing Director/Chief Pilot of Wilson Airways, but in March 1932, he resigned from Wilson Airways and left Kenya to take up an employment offer made by Lord Marmaduke Furness, a renowned horse breeder, to be his personal pilot and live back in England. While the company was profitable, Wilson Airways was disbanded in 1939 with the outbreak of the Second World War. The Ernst Udet rescue In the 20 October 1934 Time Magazine report of the London to Melbourne Air Race, a mention is made of an incident that happened concerning Black: \\"Captain T. Campbell Black [was] famed for his spectacular rescue of Ernst Udet, German War Ace, in the desert wastes of the treacherous Nile country three years ago.\\" A reference to this act is found in Ernst Udet's Ace of the Iron Cross. An account of the rescue follows: The London to Melbourne Centenary Air Race de Havilland DH.88 Comet racer G-ACSS, Grosvenor House, flown by Tom Campbell Black. DeHavilland DH.88 Comet, \\"Grosvenor House\\" G-ACSS, in Martin Place, Sydney 12 November 1934. In 1934, Campbell Black and C. W. A. Scott were entered in the London to Melbourne Air Race, officially known as the \\"MacRobertson Air Race\\". Recorded as Captain T.

Held Saturday, 18 June, total Island course: . At the end of the two laps it was Ashwell Cook with Tom Campbell Black as navigator, who came through to win in a Cirrus Moth aircraft averaging . The following references to Tom Black are recorded in the history of \\"Firbeck Hall\\", an elegant country home in England dating from circa 1585, that in the mid-1930s was converted into one of the country's most exclusive sporting country clubs. Beryl Markham Campbell Black also had a long-term affair with Beryl Markham, an aviator who lived in Kenya who had been introduced to aviation by Campbell Black. He subsequently became her flight instructor, which Markham describes in her memoir West with the Night. In September 1936, Beryl Markham achieved fame by being the first solo female aviator to fly the Atlantic Ocean from East to West (from England to America), against the prevailing winds. The Schlesinger Race In the same year, Tom Campbell Black had entered an air race from England to Johannesburg, South Africa, \\"The Schlesinger Race\\", flown from 29 September 1936 to 1 October 1936, the race offered a prize of ¬£10,000 to the winner. Campbell Black was one of the three favourites to win the race, all flying Percival E2H Mew Gulls. On 19 September 1936, while preparing for the race, he was killed at Liverpool, Speke Airport, in a ground collision. A RAF bomber that had landed ran into Black's Mew Gull as he taxied out for take off. Black was reputed to have been looking down at his map at the time. The propeller of the large biplane tore through the side of Black's cockpit, striking and mortally wounding him in the chest and shoulder. He died on the way to hospital. He left a widow, the English actress Florence Desmond, whom he had married in 1935. The winners of the \\"Schlesinger Race\\" were C. W. A.

French Army and repatriation to Souli In 1803, after the capture of Souli by Ali Pasha, Botsaris and the remnants of the Souliotes crossed over to the Ionian Islands, where he served in the Albanian Regiment of the French army for 11 years and became one the regiment's officers. In 1815 he returned to Epirus.Nikos Giannopoulos, \\"Markos Botsaris, the absolute exemplar of heroism\\", Miltary History, issue 138, 2008, page 11, Publications PeriskopioIn 1820, with other Souliots, he came back to Epirus and fought against Ali Pasha in the Ottoman army at the Siege of Ioannina, but soon the Souliotes changed side and fought the Ottoman army with the troops of Ali Pasha, in exchange of their former region, the Souli. In 1821, Christoforos Perraivos arrived at Epirus and informed the Souliotes about the existence Filiki Eteria and the upcoming revolution.

He and other Souliot captains, including Kitsos Tzavelas, Notis Botsaris, Lampros Veikos, and Giotis Danglis only enlisted fellow Souliot kin into their bands. At the outbreak of the Greek War of Independence, he distinguished himself by his courage, tenacity and skill as a partisan leader in the fighting in western Greece, and was conspicuous in the defence of Missolonghi during the first siege of the city (1822‚Äì1823). Recognizing his bravery and excellent strategical mind, the Greek Government made him General of Western Greece. This angered the rest of the unranked Greek chieftains, so Botsaris responded by tearing his millitary diploma apart in order to show them that he didn't care for ranks, but only for the greater good of his country.Nikos Giannopoulos, \\"Markos Botsaris, the absolute exemplar of heroism\\", Military History, issue 138, 2008, page 16, Publications Periskopio On the night of 21 August 1823 he led the attack on Karpenisi by 350 Souliotes, against approximately 4,000 Albanian troops who formed the vanguard of the army with which Mustafa Pasha, the Pasha of Shkoder (modern northern Albania) and advanced to reinforce the besiegers.Nikos Giannopoulos, \\"Markos Botsaris, the absolute exemplar of heroism\\", Military History, issue 138, 2008, page 17, Publications Periskopio Botsaris' men ambushed the enemy camp and inflicted serious casualties, but Botsaris was shot in the head and killed. Botsaris was buried with full honors in Missolonghi. After the Ottomans captured the city, in 1826, his grave was desecrated by Ottoman Albanian groups. Family and companions Many of his family members became key figures of the Greek political establishment. Markos' brother Kostas (Constantine) Botsaris, who also fought at Karpenisi and completed the victory, lived on to become a respected Greek general and parliamentarian in the Greek kingdom. He died in Athens on 13 November 1853. His daughter, Katerina \\"Rosa\\" Botsari, was in the service of Queen Amalia of Greece.

Young. p. 13. 1996 The Johns Hopkins University Press. Legacy Many Philhellenes visiting Greece had admired Botsaris' courage and numerous poets wrote poems about him. American poet Fitz-Greene Halleck wrote a poem entitled Marco Bozzaris, Juste Olivier also wrote an award-winning poem for him, in 1825.Poetry Archive - Marco Bozzaris The national poet of Greece, Dionysios Solomos, composed a poem titled \\"On Markos Botsaris\\", in which he likens the mourning over Botsaris' body to the lamentation of Hector, as described in the last book of the Iliad. His memory is still celebrated in popular ballads in Greece. Botsaris is also widely considered to be the author of a Greek‚ÄìAlbanian lexicon written in Corfu in 1809, at the insistence of Fran√ßois Pouqueville, Napoleon Bonaparte's general consul at the court of Ali Pasha in Ioannina.Markos Botsarƒìs, Titos P.

The dictionary is of importance for the knowledge of the extinct Souliot dialect.JOCHALAS, Titos, To ellino-alvanikon lexikon tou Markou Botzari, Athens 1980. However, although the book is known as the Botsaris dictionary, scholar Xhevat Lloshi has argued in several works that Botsaris couldn't have possibly written that dictionary by himself, both because of his young age, and because of a note of Pouqueville that clearly says that the dictionary was drafted under the dictation of Marko's father, uncle, and future father-in-law. In Greek music, the Zakynthian composer Pavlos Carrer composed in 1858 the opera ‚ÄúMarco Bozzari‚Äù to his honour. In 1858 excerpts from the opera were performed in Athens in the presence of King Otto.A.

He often adorns posters in Greek classrooms, government offices, and military barracks, as a member of the Greek pantheon of national heroes. =The Greek‚ÄìAlbanian dictionary= The original manuscript of the dictionary is at the National Library in Paris (Suppl√©ment Grec 251). Botsaris titled his dictionary ‚ÄúLexicon of the simple Romaic and Arbanitic language‚Äù (ŒõŒµŒæŒπŒ∫œåŒΩ œÑŒ∑œÇ Œ°œâŒºŒ±œäŒ∫ŒøŒπœÇ Œ∫Œ±Œπ ŒëœÅŒ≤Œ±ŒΩŒ∑œÑŒ∑Œ∫ŒÆœÇ ŒëœÄŒªŒÆœÇ (sic)). The Greek terms are in columns on the left of the pages, not in alphabetical order, and the Albanian words on the right, written in Greek letters. Apart from single words, the dictionary includes complexes of words or short phrases. The Greek entries are in total 1701 and the Albanian 1494. On the first page there is a hand-written notice by Pouqueville: ‚ÄúCe lexique est √©crit de la main de Marc Botzari √† Corfou 1809 devant moi.‚Äù This manuscript, which includes also a kind of Greek‚ÄìAlbanian self-teaching method with dialogues written by Ioannes Vilaras and a French-Albanian glossary by Pouqueville, was donated by the latter to the Library in 1819. The dictionary was dictated to the young M. Botsaris by his father Kitsos (1754‚Äì1813), his uncle Notis (1759‚Äì1841) and his father-in-law Christakis Kalogerou from Preveza. Titos Yochalas, a Greek historian who studied and edited the manuscript, noticing that some Greek words are translated into Albanian in more than one way, believes that M. Botsaris was writing the Greek words and the elders were translating into Albanian. As many of the entries seem unlikely to be useful either for the Suliots or the Albanians of that time and circumstances, Yochalas believes that the dictionary was composed after Pouqueville's initiative, possibly as a source for a future French-Albanian dictionary. He also observes that the Albanian phrases are syntaxed as if were Greek, concluding that either the mother tongue of the authors was the Greek or the Greek language had a very strong influence on the Albanian, if the latter was possibly spoken in Souli (Yochalas, p. 53). The Albanian idiom of the dictionary belongs to the Tosk dialect of south Albanian and retains many archaic elements, found also in the dialect spoken by the Greco-Albanian communities of South Italy and Sicily. In the Albanian entries there are many loans from Greek (approx. 510), as well as from Turkish (approx. 190) and Italian (21).Yochalas Titos (editor, 1980) The Greek-Albanian Dictionary of Markos Botsaris.

It is published in English by Media Blasters Press. J√§ger means Hunter in German. Pilgrim J√§ger is a historical fiction that takes place in Europe in the year 1521, at the time of the Protestant Reformation. The story follows two women, Adele the acrobat and Karin the fortuneteller. Afraid of being accused of witchcraft, they disguise their special powers, working as common performers (professionisti) to earn enough money to buy indulgences from the Catholic Church that will hopefully free them from their sins. However, their powers soon get them involved in a great religious battle involving the Medici family, the Este family, Girolamo Savonarola's \\"prophecies,\\" and many others. Savonarola's prophecies or the Friar's Predictions are the main basis for the series. These prophecies made many predictions about the Catholic Church; even the demise of Rome. Before all these predictions, a battle was to take place. Characters * Adele - Is a street performing acrobat that teams up with Karin. Adele also carries around flint to produce flames for her performances, (they are said not to burn/hurt those who touch it.) She wields a long, cross- like spear that is supposed to symbolize the Alpha Cross or Fennel Stalk. It is quoted by To Ubukata, 'Those born under a certain star wield the Fennel Stalk to kill the demon Malandanti who comes in the dark of night. He is the warrior Benandanti. Only when this battle is won, will the village be assured a good harvest.' Throughout the first two books, there are rumors leading to this cross causing the holders' soul to divide into many. The previous carrier was said to have 12 souls/personalities. * Karin - Is Adele's traveling partner and a fortune teller. There are sharp daggers, knives, needles, and nails that come out of her hands in order to predict the intensity and importance of what she foresees. Karin was trained by her grandmother. At a young age, her mother sold her to a nunnery where she met Adele. Karin and Adele later left the nunnery due to a fire that may have been started by themselves.

These languages are believed to have been originally spoken by Southern Cushitic agro-pastoralists from Ethiopia, who in the third millennium BC began migrating southward into the Great Rift Valley. Classification The Rift languages are named after the Great Rift Valley of Tanzania, where they are found. Hetzron (1980:70ff) suggested that the Rift languages (South Cushitic) are a part of Lowland East Cushitic. Kie√üling & Mous (2003) have proposed more specifically that they be linked to a Southern Lowland branch, together with Oromo, Somali, and Yaaku‚ÄìDullay. It is possible that the great lexical divergence of Rift from East Cushitic is due to Rift being partially relexified through contact with Khoisan languages, as perhaps evidenced by the unusually high frequency of the ejective affricates and , which outnumber pulmonary consonants like . Kie√üling & Mous suggest that these ejectives may be remnants of clicks from the source language. The terms \\"South Cushitic\\" and \\"Rift\\" are not quite synonymous: The Ma'a and Dahalo languages were once included in South Cushitic, but were not considered Rift. Kie√üling restricts South Cushitic to West Rift as its only indisputable branch. He states that Dahalo has too many East Cushitic features to belong to South Cushitic, as does Ma'a. (The Waata and Degere may once have spoken languages similar to Dahalo.) Kw'adza and Aasax are in turn insufficiently described to classify as even Cushitic with any certainty.Roland Kie√üling, \\"South Cushitic links to East Cushitic\\", in Zaborski ed, 2001, New Data and New Methods in Afroasiatic Linguistics Iraqw and Gorowa are close enough for basic mutual intelligibility. Alagwa has become similar to Burunge through intense contact, and so had previously been classified as a Southern West Rift language. Aasax and Kw'adza are poorly attested and, like Dahalo, may be the result of language shift from non-Cushitic languages. Several additional and now extinct South Cushitic languages are deduced from their influence on the Bantu languages that replaced them. A pair of these, Taita Cushitic, appear to have been more divergent than extant Rift languages, co-ordinate with Proto-Rift within a larger group Nurse (1988) calls \\"Greater Rift\\".

","title":"South Cushitic languages"},{"id":"1798692","text":"In computer science, a linear grammar is a context-free grammar that has at most one nonterminal in the right hand side of each of its productions. A linear language is a language generated by some linear grammar. Example A simple linear grammar is G with N = {S}, Œ£ = {a, b}, P with start symbol S and rules : S -> aSb : S -> Œµ It generates the language \\\\\\\\{ a^ib^i \\\\;  \\\\; i \\\\geq 0\\\\\\\\}. Relationship with regular grammars Two special types of linear grammars are the following: * the left-linear or left regular grammars, in which all nonterminals in right hand sides are at the left ends; * the right- linear or right regular grammars, in which all nonterminals in right hand sides are at the right ends. Each of these can describe exactly the regular languages. A regular grammar is a grammar that is left-linear or right-linear. Another special type of linear grammar is the following: * linear grammars in which all nonterminals in right hand sides are at the left or right ends, but not necessarily all at the same end. By inserting new nonterminals, every linear grammar can be brought into this form without affecting the language generated. For instance, the rules of G above can be replaced with : S -> aA : A -> Sb : S -> Œµ Hence, linear grammars of this special form can generate all linear languages. Expressive power All regular languages are linear; conversely, an example of a linear, non-regular language is {anbn}, as explained above. All linear languages are context-free; conversely, an example of a context-free, non-linear language is the Dyck language of well-balanced bracket pairs. Hence, the regular languages are a proper subset of the linear languages, which in turn are a proper subset of the context-free languages. While the linear languages that are regular languages are deterministic, there exist linear languages that are nondeterministic. For example, the language of even-length palindromes on the alphabet of 0 and 1 has the linear grammar S ‚Üí 0S0  1S1  Œµ. An arbitrary string of this language cannot be parsed without reading all its letters first which means that a pushdown automaton has to try alternative state transitions to accommodate for the different possible lengths of a semi-parsed string. This language is nondeterministic. Since nondeterministic context-free languages cannot be accepted in linear time, linear languages cannot be accepted in linear time in the general case. Furthermore, it is undecidable whether a given context-free language is a linear context-free language. Closure properties If L is a linear language and M is a regular language, then the intersection L \\\\cap M is again a linear language; in other words, the linear languages are closed under intersection with regular sets. Furthermore, the linear languages are closed under homomorphism and inverse homomorphism.John E. Hopcroft and Jeffrey D. Ullman, Introduction to Automata Theory, Languages, and Computation, Addison-Wesley Publishing, Reading Massachusetts, 1979. ., Ex. 11.1, pp. 282f These three closure properties show that the linear languages form a full trio. Full trios in general are language families that enjoy a couple of other desirable mathematical properties.

Biography Yuri Bashmet was born on 24 January 1953 in Rostov-on-Don in the family of Abram Borisovich Bashmet and Maya Zinovyeva Bashmet (n√©e Krichever). His paternal grandmother, Tsilya Efimovna, studied singing at the conservatory for two years in her youth. His maternal grandmother, Darya Axentyevna, interpreted native Hutsul songs.(http://yanko.lib.ru/books/music/bashmet_vokzal_mechtu.htm#_Toc34416664) In 1971, he graduated from the Lviv secondary special music school. From 1971 till 1976, he studied at the Moscow Conservatory. His first viola teacher was Professor Vadim Borisovsky; after whose death in 1972 was succeeded by Professor Fyodor Druzhinin. Druzhinin was also the tutor of Yuri Bashmet for the probation period and for his postgraduate study at the Moscow Conservatory (1976‚Äì78). In 1972, Bashmet purchased a 1758 viola made by Milanese luthier Paolo Testore, which he uses for his performances to date. In the late 1970s through to the early 1980s, Bashmet developed his career as a solo performer. He began his active concert activities in 1976, with a tour of Germany with the Moscow Chamber Orchestra founded by R. Barshay. He has performed in leading concert halls the world over: in Europe, USA, Canada, Latin America, Australia, New Zealand and Japan. He was the first violist to perform a solo recital in such halls as the Amsterdam Concertgebouw, the Barbican in London, the Berlin Philharmonic, La Scala of Milan, the Great Hall of the Moscow Conservatoire, and the Great Hall of the Leningrad Philharmonic. Yuri Bashmet has performed under many noted conductors, including Rafael Kubel√≠k, Mstislav Rostropovich, Seiji Ozawa, Valery Gergiev, Gennady Rozhdestvensky, Colin Davis, John Eliot Gardiner, Yehudi Menuhin, Charles Dutoit, Neville Marriner, Paul Sacher, Michael Tilson Thomas, Kurt Masur, Bernard Haitink, Kent Nagano, Simon Rattle, Yuri Temirkanov, and Nikolaus Harnoncourt. He started his conducting activity in 1985, consistent with his reputation as a bold contemporary artist not afraid of taking risks. In 1992, Bashmet reconstituted the orchestra featuring some of the most talented young musicians of Russia who are graduates and postgraduate students of the Moscow Conservatory. This orchestra performs in the Great Hall of the Moscow Conservatory and has toured extensively abroad. Its performances have been recorded for broadcast by major radio companies, including the BBC, Bayerischer Rundfunk, Radio France, and Radio Luxembourg. The orchestra has recorded several CDs, among these a recording of the Alfred Schnittke Triple Concerto (EMI Records), soloists: Gidon Kremer, Yuri Bashmet and Mstislav Rostropovich. Another CD, of the Thirteenth String Quartet by Shostakovich and the quintet by Brahms (Sony Classics), was acclaimed \\"Best Album of 1998\\" by The Strad magazine, and was nominated for a Grammy Award. As a soloist and a conductor, Bashmet has performed with leading symphony orchestras: Berlin Philharmonic, Berlin Symphony, New York Philharmonic, –í–∞—Érische Rundfunk, San Francisco Symphony, Chicago Symphony, Boston Symphony, Vienna Philharmonic, French Radio Philharmonic Orchestra, Paris Orchestra, etc. Repertoire with these orchestras has included the symphonic works of Brahms, Haydn, Schubert, Mozart, Tchaikovsky, and Beethoven. A particularly noted concert at the Bolshoi Theatre in Moscow featured Shostakovich's Symphony No. 13. Bashmet has performed recitals, as well as his joint performances together with noted musicians including Mstislav Rostropovich, Gidon Kremer, Sviatoslav Richter, Isaac Stern, Anne-Sophie Mutter, Martha Argerich, Evgeny Kissin, Mischa Maisky, M. Portal, Shlomo Mintz, Oleg Kagan, Roberto Carnevale, Viktor Tretiakov, and Maria Jo√£o Pires. Of particular note were Bashmet's performances in collaboration with Sviatoslav Richter, two performers of different generations but with common artistic views. They performed together at the \\"December Evenings\\" festival in the Pushkin museum in Moscow, as well as on world tours. Another of Bashmet's longstanding artistic friendships, personal and in performance, is with Mstislav Rostropovich. Numerous modern composers have composed works especially for Yuri Bashmet or dedicated to him, including 50 viola concertos and other works: A. Schnittke ‚Äì \\"Concerto\\", \\"Monologue\\"; S. Gubaidullina ‚Äì \\"Concerto\\", E. Denisov -\\"Concerto\\", D. Tavener ‚Äì \\"The Myth Bearer\\"; M. Pletnev ‚Äì \\"Concerto\\", A. Golovin ‚Äì \\"Sonata-breve\\". A. Raskatov ‚Äì \\"Sonata\\"; V. Sharafyan - \\"Surgite Gloriae\\" viola concerto with duduk, descant, baritone and orchestra, G. Kancheli ‚Äì \\"Liturgy \\" and \\"Styx\\"; A. Tchaikovsky ‚Äì two \\"Concertos\\"; Barkauskas ‚Äì \\"Concert\\", A. Eshpay ‚Äì \\"Concert\\"; P. Ruders ‚Äì \\"Concerto\\". A. Schnittke ‚Äì \\"Concerto for three\\" (dedicated to Mstislav Rostropovich, Yuri Bashmet, Gidon Kremer), and many others. Yuri Bashmet has transcribed the \\"String Trio\\" by A. Schnittke for string orchestra; this work was issued by \\"Sikorsky\\" (Vienna) under the name \\"Trio ‚Äì Sonata\\". Particular works for which Bashmet is known include the Chaconne by J.S. Bach, Arpeggione Sonata by F. Schubert, Sinfonia Concertante for violin and viola by W. A. Mozart, Viola Sonata by D. Shostakovich, and the Concerto for viola and orchestra by A. Schnittke. Yuri Bashmet has participated in many festivals all over the world: Tanglewood (USA), Tours, Bordeaux, Biarritz, Menton (France), Brussels, Kainuu, Mikkeli (Finland), Kroyt (Germany), Siena, Sorrento, Camerino, Streza (Italy), and \\"March Music Lias\\" (Ruse, Bulgaria). He is an artistic director and one of the organizers of the festivals in Rolandseck (Germany), and Elba Island (Italy). He is a regular participant of the Promenade Concerts in Royal Albert Hall (London, UK). The highest appraisal of Bashmet's talent was his appointment to the position of the art director of the \\"December evenings\\" music festival in Moscow, a position held for 17 years by Sviatoslav Richter . Since 2006 Yuri Bashmet together with famous Belarusian pianist Rostislav Krimer has held the annual Yuri Bashmet International Music Festival in Minsk (Belarus), which has become one of the most prominent events in the Commonwealth of Independent States.http://www.belarus.by/en/about-belarus/culture/yuri-bashmet- international-musical-festival-in-minsk Yuri Bashmet is a founder and a Jury Chairman of the International Contest of Violists in Moscow, the only event of its kind in Russia. He is the President of the Lionel Tertis International Viola Competition in Great Britain, the member of Jury for the violists' contests in Munich and \\"Maurice Vie\\" in Paris. Cinema and TV broadcasting companies of different countries (Great Britain, France, Russia) have filmed several movies about his art. Several times his CDs won prestigious European awards, including the \\"Diapason d'Or\\" and \\"Choc\\". Yuri Bashmet has participated in many large-scale charity actions of the international importance, in Carnegie Hall (with Elton John and Stevie Wonder), in London (in the memory of Princess Diana); in the concerts, whose proceeds were transferred to the funds aimed to help the victims of the natural disasters in Armenia, Japan, and to the funds helping handicapped children. The International Charity Fund, established by Yuri Bashmet, has established the Dimitri Shostakovich International Award for outstanding achievements in the field of the international art. This award was granted to Gidon Kremer, Thomas Quasthoff, Victor Tretiakov, Valery Gergiev, Anne-Sophie Mutter, Olga Borodina, Irina Antonova, Natalia Gutman, and Evgeny Kissin. In March 2014 he signed a letter in support of the position of the President of Russia Vladimir Putin on Russia's military intervention in Ukraine. According to a statement from the Lviv National Music Academy (LNMA) on 12 March 2014, Yuri Bashmet has been stripped of his title as honorary professor at the LNMA in response to his signing of an open letter in support of Russia's military intervention in Crimea, Ukraine, the country where he grew up. =As educator= Since 1978, Yuri Bashmet has taught students of the Moscow Conservatoire. In 1988 he attained the position of docent, and in 1996 he was made a professor. Since 1980, Bashmet has conducted master classes in Japan, Europe, USA, and Hong Kong. He teaches summer courses at the Accademia Chigiana (Siena, Italy) and at the academy of Tours (France). His students have won many of the international contests and now are performing in orchestras worldwide. In 1996, he created and headed the \\"Experimental Chair of Viola\\", where in addition to the works of solo viola repertoire, the curriculum includes extended studies of the viola parts in the chamber, operatic and symphonic music, as well as advanced study of the performance styles of the past and the present. Yuri Bashmet leads national education projects, as a presenter and art director of the TV programs The Station of Dream and Music in the Museums of the World. Moscow Soloists In 1986, Yuri Bashmet founded the Moscow Soloists chamber orchestra. In 1991, when the orchestra was on tour in France, Bashmet, as Art Director, signed a temporary contract with the administration of the city of Montpellier. Afterwards the musicians of the orchestra decided to stay in France, a decision untenable for Bashmet himself, who was committed contractually to return to Russia. He consequently resigned his position with the orchestra, while inviting the musicians to return to Russia with him. Soon after that the orchestra disbanded, and its members have joined other ensembles abroad. Bashmet re-established the Moscow Soloists, after returning to Moscow, with new musicians. Honours and awards When he was a student, Bashmet was granted the Second Award at the International Contest of Violists in Budapest (1975) and Grand Prix at the ARD International Music Competition in Munich (1976), attaining worldwide recognition. His artistry has won recognition in various awards and regalia in Russia and abroad. He has been granted the high titles of the Honorary Artist of RSFSR (1983), Honorary Artist of the USSR (1991), State Award of the USSR (1986), State Awards of the Russian Federation (1994 and 1996), –êward-1993 \\"Best Musical Instrument Performer of the Year\\" (a title comparable to the \\"Oscar\\" in cinema). Yuri Bashmet is an Honorary Academician of the London Academy of Arts. In 1995, he was awarded one of the most prestigious awards in the world, of the \\"Sonnings Musikfond\\" in Copenhagen. Previous recipients include Igor Stravinsky, Leonard Bernstein, Benjamin Britten, Yehudi Menuhin, Isaac Stern, Arthur Rubinstein, Dmitri Shostakovich, Mstislav Rostropovich, Sviatoslav Richter, and Gidon Kremer. In 1999, by the Act of the Minister of Culture of the Republic of France, Yuri Bashmet was granted the rank of the Officer of Arts and Literature. In the same time the Prime Minister of Lithuania marked his invaluable impact to the Art by granting Bashmet the highest honor of the Republic of Lithuania. In 2000 the President of Italy granted him an honor \\"For Contribution to Motherland\\", and in 2002, the president of the Russian Federation Vladimir Putin presented him the honor \\"For Contribution to Motherland\\", 3rd grade. In 2003, Yuri Bashmet was granted the rank of Commander of the French L√©gion d'honneur. In 2000, the Russian Biographic Society granted Yuri Bashmet the honorary title \\"The Man of the Year\\", in 2001 ‚Äì \\"Zealot of the Enlightenment\\". In 2003, Bashmet became the laureate of the \\"Olympus\\" National Award. * Honored Artist of the RSFSR (1983) * USSR State Prize (1986) * People's Artist of the USSR (1991) * State Prize of the Russian Federation (1993, 1995, 2000) * Sonning Award (1995; Denmark) * Officer of the Order of the Lithuanian Grand Duke Gediminas (Lithuania, 18 June 1999) * Officer of the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres (2000, France) * Commander of the Order of Merit of the Italian Republic (Italy 2000) * Order of Merit for the Fatherland, 3rd class (15 April 2002) ‚Äì for outstanding contribution to the development of national art * Officer of the L√©gion d'honneur (2003, France) * Order of Merit (Ukraine), 3rd class (19 April 2004) ‚Äì a significant personal contribution to the development of cultural ties between Ukraine and the Russian Federation, many years of fruitful creative activity * Honorary Professor of Moscow State University (2004) * Honorary Citizen of Rousse, Bulgaria (2005) * Order of Honour (6 February 2008) ‚Äì for outstanding contribution to the development of national music and many years of creative activity * Grammy Award (February 2008; USA) ‚Äì with the orchestra \\"Soloists of Moscow\\" ‚Äì for the execution of works by Stravinsky and Prokofiev in the category \\"Best performance by small ensembles\\" * Honorary Member of the Royal Academy of Music, London. * Order of Francisc Skorina (Belarus) References External links *Yuri Bashmet official website *Yuri Bashmet official website (on \\"International Classic Artists\\" site) *Discography (not easy to find on the ICA page, above) *Yuri Bashmet International Music Festival *Yuri Bashmet - Spotlight *Yuri Bashmet interview, July 30, 1993 1953 births Living people People from Rostov-on-Don Russian Jews Jewish classical musicians Moscow Conservatory alumni Moscow Conservatory faculty Russian classical violists Contemporary classical music performers Grammy Award winners Recipients of the Order \\"For Merit to the Fatherland\\", 3rd class Recipients of the Order \\"For Merit to the Fatherland\\", 4th class Recipients of the Order of Honour (Russia) Recipients of the Order of Friendship People's Artists of the USSR Honored Artists of the RSFSR Recipients of the USSR State Prize State Prize of the Russian Federation laureates Chevaliers of the Order of Merit (Ukraine) Honorary Members of the Royal Academy of Music Deutsche Grammophon artists Officer's Crosses of the Order of the Lithuanian Grand Duke Gediminas Officiers of the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres Commanders of the Order of Merit of the Italian Republic Officiers of the L√©gion d'honneur Recipients of the Order of Francysk Skaryna ","title":"Yuri Bashmet"},{"id":"1798695","text":"Johann Wilhelm Meigen (3 May 1764 ‚Äì 11 July 1845) was a German entomologist famous for his pioneering work on Diptera. Life =Early years= Meigen was born in Solingen, the fifth of eight children of Johann Clemens Meigen and Sibylla Margaretha Bick. His parents, though not poor, were not wealthy either. They ran a small shop in Solingen. His paternal grandparents, however, owned an estate and hamlet with twenty houses. Adding to the rental income, Meigen's grandfather was a farmer and a guild mastercutler in Solingen. Two years after Meigen was born, his grandparents died and his parents moved to the family estate. This was already heavily indebted by the Seven Years' War, then bad crops and rash speculations forced the sale of the farm and the family moved back to Solingen. Meigen attended the town school but only for a short time. He had learned to read and write on his grandfather's estate and he read widely at home as well as taking an interest in natural history. A lodger in the household, a state surveyor named Stamm gave Meigen instruction in mathematics. Another family friend a Reformed Church organist and teacher called Berger, gave him lessons from his 10th year on in piano, orthography, and calligraphy. Later on, in 1776, he also taught him French. Meigen became Berger's assistant, going to M√ºlheim with him. There he saw for the first time a systematic collection of butterflies, and here he also learned how to collect and prepare insects. In the autumn of 1779 he returned to Solingen to help his parents, at first by giving private lessons in French, but in the following year he started a French school that lasted until early in 1784. During his few free hours in this period he studied history from Charles Rollin's 15-volume Roman History and that author's four-volume Ancient History (both in French). The only entomological work in his possession at this time was Moder's (or Kleemann's) Caterpillar Calendar. Later in 1784 he was recommended to Pelzer, a tradesman in Aachen, for the position of resident tutor. On taking up the post, he was treated as a family member. Pelzer had a cousin in Aachen by the name of Mathias Baumhauer (1759‚Äì1818), a wool merchant's son, who was a very able entomologist. Baumhauer had a butterfly collection including about 1200 species as well as numbers of insects of all other orders. =Early entomology= Meigen's first attempts to identify his collection which was mainly of Diptera were made with a two-volume work by Philipp Ludwig Statius Muller a German translation of Linnaeus's Natursystem published in the Netherlands by Houttyn. He soon made his first discovery. The Linnean genera were too inclusive and a better classification could be arrived at using wing venation. This conclusion had already occurred to both Moses Harris in England and Louis Jurine in Geneva but at the time Meigen was unaware of this. Sensing an important step forward he secured the works of Fabricius and from that time concentrated on Diptera. He soon found that wing venation alone was not enough to classify the Dipera correctly and he began to make drawings of the antennae viewed under a 20-power wooden-framed microscope purchased at the fair in Aachen, This, a lens of about 6-power, and his own very sharp eyesight and visual memory led him to the next important conclusion, that the Diptera could only be classified using character combinations; what is now known as an eclectic system. =Return to Solingen= In 1786 the Solingen organist, a younger brother of his former teacher Berger died in Solingen. That position, with a French school connected with it, was offered to Meigen and he went back to Solingen. There he became closely acquainted with a man called Weniger, who shared his interests in botany and entomology. His enthusiasm for entomology and botany became broader and he decided to extend his studies to world species. Weniger felt likewise and they contacted the banker and collector Johann Christian Gerning in Frankfurt. Gerning wrote to his son in the Netherlands, who bought insect specimens for him. A Swiss, Count von Meuron, who was in the Dutch service and whose brother was governor of Trincomalee on Ceylon heard of their wishes and obtained for them the offer of positions as surgeons on an East Indiaman, with an additional stipend. This plan was given up when Meigen's mother opposed it. =To Burtscheid= In 1792 Meigen took instruction in drawing. Then he was offered a teaching position in Burtscheid near Aachen. However, he could not leave Solingen because it was occupied by the French army during the Battle of Jemappes. Only when the French withdrew after the Battle of Neerwinden was he able to leave for Burtscheid and Aachen, where he then taught as well as collecting assiduously. In 1796, Meigen took a job teaching French in Stolberg, 2 hours from Aachen. Here he remained without further change of residence until his death. In Stolberg outside of school hours he taught drawing, geography, history and piano. He also met a brass-worker named J. A. Peltzer, who was a mathematician and owned a 60-power Tiedemann achromatic telescope. Soon Meigen was teaching astronomy as well. In 1801 Meigen met the French naturalist Count Lac√©p√®de who had come to Stolberg to visit the brass works. They talked about natural history and Meigen showed Count Lac√©p√®de his drawings of Diptera. The following day Meigen was asked to visit Count Lac√©p√®de who asked him to join Capt. Baudin's voyage around the world as a botanist. Meigen declined. In 1802 Johann Karl Wilhelm Illiger who must have heard of Meigen from Count Lac√©p√®de and was at the baths in Aachen with Johann Centurius Hoffmannsegg invited him to join them. Meigen took his drawings along, and made arrangements with Illiger and Hoffmannsegg for future work. Illiger had captured a new and unknown Dipteron and showed a pen drawing of it to Meigen, asking him how it should be classified. Meigen described it as Loxocera Hoffmannseggi. Illiger also agreed to proofread Meigen's first work on Diptera which was then published in 1804 by Reichard in Braunschweig. =Controversy= In 1804 the only classification of Diptera was that of Fabricius. Despite Meigen's more advanced, and more natural classification, Meigen's Die Fliegen found little favor with most entomologists, who were adherents of Fabricius, but that did not deflect Meigen. In the same year Fabricius visited Paris and saw Meigen's work. On returning home, he wrote Meigen and arranged to meet him in Aachen. A few days later Fabricius came to Stolberg. Here he was shown all of Meigen's new genera in order that he might use them in the projected new edition of Systema Antliatorum. Fabricius criticized Meigen for his eclectic method, asserting that a classification should be based upon one part of the body, (mainly mouthparts) not on several different parts. Meigen pointed out that Fabricius himself did not consistently follow his own precepts but even so Fabricius refused to use the eclectic method. =Marriage= In 1801 Meigen married Anna, the sister of the Reverend M√§nsse, a preacher at H√ºckelhoven near Linnich. Anna was clearly devoted to Meigen which was as well since hard times were ahead. Until 1808 the number of students of French steadily declined, resulting of course in a considerable reduction in Meigen's income. In this crisis, a merchant in Stolberg, one Adolf Pelzer, obtained for him the secretaryship for the Stolberg commercial committee, including keeping minutes of meetings and carrying on correspondence in both German and French. Then, in another reversal, he was replaced by a voluntary secretariat. =Coal fossils= In 1812 the French government provided Meigen with the job of finishing drawings of coal fossils. At this time his work day began usually at about 4 in the morning and lasted until late in the evening for 314 days of each year. All free time was spent with the study of entomology mostly Diptera, but also other orders. He also studied history and mathematics. At this time Meigen drew and colored many more species for Die Fliegen. From 1812 to 1814 Meigen drew some maps for the municipality of Stolberg. He also corresponded again with Count von Hoffmannsegg, until the latter sold his collection to the Natural History Museum of Berlin. =Offer from Wiedemann= In 1815, Meigen received a letter from State Attorney (Justizrat) Christian Rudolph Wilhelm Wiedemann asking if there was any prospect that his work begun in 1804 could be continued. He offered access to the Fabricius collection in the University of Kiel. Then in the summer of 1816 Wiedemann came to Stolberg and stayed 8 days to outline an ambitious project. He had material sent to Meigen from the Vienna Museum, from the Hoffmannsegg collection in Berlin, and from the Peter Simon Pallas collection. Meigen worked constantly and in 1818 the first volume of the new and enlarged edition of Die Fliegen came out, followed by the others until the 7th volume appeared in 1838. For this last volume Meigen had to make the lithographic plates himself to cut expenses. He also prepared 19 lithographic plates for Wiedemann's Aussereuropaische Zweiflugler. The first volumes of Die Fliegen were published by Meigen himself, but the costs were high, in spite of a considerable list of subscriptions. The Schulz bookdealers in Hamm took over the job with a sizeable honorarium. In 1818, Meigen's longtime friend, the tireless collector, Baumhauer died in Paris. His widow brought his collection to Aachen and got Meigen to determine it. He took on the determination of at least 50,000 specimens from Germany, France, the Pyrenees, the Alps and northern Italy and worked on it for a year and a half. The collection was then sold for 1100 Dutch guilders, part of it going to Leiden and part to Luttich. These years were very certainly hard. Because of poor harvests in 1816 and 1817, food prices rose enormously. There were 7 children in his family at this time and his income was extremely low, there being now no demand for a French teacher, the French Empire having collapsed. Eventually, through the intervention of the inspector of water supply, he got a well paid contract for some map-drawing lasting a couple of years. Astronomy also brought him some map-work. He was able, however to make a trip to the Siebengebirge chiefly for botany and Meigen made some drawings of plants for Prof. Johann Georg Christian Lehmann a Hamburg botanist. In 1821, Meigen made the acquaintance of Professor Heinrich Moritz Gaede of Luttich, whose name he gave to Trypeta gaedii and the tachinid genus Gaedia. =Wiedemann's second visit and a trip to Scandinavia= In 1822, Wiedemann made a second visit to Meigen, proposing that Meigen come to Kiel and revise the Fabrician collection, and offering to defray expenses. Meigen accepted, leaving for Hamburg on 23 June 1823. He was met in Hamburg by the entomologist Wilhelm Von Winthem, who invited him to stay at his home. Meigen, found himself in the house in which the great poet and dramatist Klopstock spent the last 30 years of his life and which Von Winthem's sister, Johanna Elisabeth von Winthem, Klopstock's widow, then owned. Here he studied the Winthem collection which contained so much that Meigen had to leave a more careful review of it for his return trip. He went on to Kiel to meet Wiedemann, He also met Heinrich Boie in Kiel. Next Meigen and Wiedemann went to Copenhagen to visit Westermann and work on the Museum collection, postponing the main job on the Fabrician collection. Meigen was permitted to take all of the material away for examination. On 19 July, the two of them went to Lund, where both Prof. Carl Fredrik Fall√©n and Johan Wilhelm Zetterstedt met them. Meigen examined Fall√©n's and Zetterstedt's collections at length. On 23 July, Wiedemann and Meigen returned to Copenhagen, where Meigen stayed. On 30 July they were back in Kiel, where everything in the collections of Fabricius and Westermann was carefully examined and compared and the unknown species drawn and described. After completing the research in Kiel, both left for Hamburg. There Meigen examined the Winthem collection, but there were so many new species in it that Winthem decided to send it all to Stolberg, where it could be worked on more conveniently. Also in Hamburg, Meigen met the entomologist Sommer from Altona and the botanist Johann Georg Christian Lehmann. The trip to Denmark and Sweden lasted altogether 12 weeks, the result of which was a series of colored drawings of more than 400 species of insects, together with their descriptions and a large number of notes and corrections. Studies of his collection of the Diptera in Fabricius' collection led to a very substantial revision. =Last years= Soon after 1822, the French school closed down completely and Meigen took the unpaid position of organist for his parish but he wrote a choral book, for which the church board paid him well. Meigen continued in this capacity until 1831. In 1825, Meigen made a translation of Fran√ßois F√©nelon ‚Äòs Telemachus, and in the same year he was enabled to attend a meeting of naturalists in Berlin. Meigen's expenses were organised by Nees von Esenbeck, and many to whom he was known through his works on Diptera. He also saw there again Wiedemann. He took advantage of this occasion to examine the collection of the Natural History Museum of Berlin and those of Ruth√© and Bouch√©. Von Winthem visited Meigen in 1826. Meigen also made a trip in that year to Crefeld and D√ºsseldorf. The following year, 1827, a Handbuch f√ºr Schmetterlingsliebhaber (Handbook for Butterfly Collectors) appeared under his name, and he also started a much larger work on Lepidoptera. This latter appeared in fascicles, each of 10 quarto plates lithographed by Meigen himself. It went as far as the Euphalaenae, where lack of funds brought it to a close. He colored the plates in a few copies. The figures, except a very few borrowed from other works, were drawn by Meigen from specimens, many from the collection of an old friend Seeger. After discontinuance of the work on Lepidoptera and the completion of that on Diptera with its 6th volume, Meigen had Diptera sent to him for identification from many sources. Outstanding among them were contributions from Joseph Waltl and Heinrich Georg Bronn. These induced him to work up a supplementary volume, which was notable for the division of the genera Tachina, Musca and Anthomyia into a number of genera based upon more critical characters than those used by previous French and English workers. At the same time Meigen worked industriously, on a Flora of Germany, which was not completed until a few years before his death. The last volume of this work, also containing numerous drawings made largely from nature by Meigen himself, appeared in 1842. It was his last work. When the French dipterologist Jean Macquart visited him in 1839 to see his collection, Meigen also showed him two thick quarto volumes of drawings containing 300 plates of colored and mostly enlarged drawings of all the species that he had described. Macquart told Meigen that he would like to buy them, quoting a price of 1800 francs on behalf of the Jardin des Plantes in Paris. He paid an additional 1200 francs for Meigen's collection of Diptera, which also went to Paris. Meigen then disposed of his library and the remainder of his collections. His books and fruit and plant collections were bought by the Verein f√ºr nat√ºrliche Wissenschaften und Gewerbe (Society for natural sciences and industry) in Aachen. All of his insects other than Diptera were bought by Arnold Foerster, along with a few manuscripts including colored drawings of Hymenoptera. In 1839, the Crown-Prince of Prussia awarded Meigen a pension of 200 thalers a year. On 3 May 1845 Meigen was presented with a doctor's diploma from the University of Bonn. Meigen died in Stolberg near Aachen (=Aix-la- Chapelle), on 11 July 1845 at the age of 81. Achievements Meigen is universally recognized as the \\"father\\" of Dipterology. Aside from his beautifully executed drawings Meigen's great achievement was to employ combinations of morphological characters to work out his scientific classification. This was in contrast to his Swedish contemporary Carl Frederick Fall√©n who had used mouthpart characters alone. Thus he had come to the same conclusion as Pierre Andr√© Latreille, Moses Harris and Louis Jurine though independently and an eclectic methodology was firmly established. Meigen described a vast number of European Diptera (mostly valid) and his work laid the foundations of all later work on this important insect group. Flies described by Meigen (not complete) Meigen described over 3,000 taxa. Here is a list of a few well-known ones. *the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, which is a model organism in the study of genetics. *Tephritis neesii *Phormia regina *Lucilia silvarum *Criorhina berberina *Thaumatomyia notata *Lucilia sericata *Muscina pascuorum *genus Microdon *genus Ctenophora *genus Chrysops *genus Haematopota *family Culicidae =Works= Diptera The two major works are: *Meigen, J.

The first volume was published in 1818, the last in 1838.

J. Fuchs, Librairie, Rue des Mathurins, No. 334. De I'lmprimerie de H. L. Perronneau/Rue du Battoir, No. 8). Nouvelle Classification is an octavo pamphlet of forty pages print dated both according to the French Revolutionary Calendar and according to the Christian Year as AN VIII (Year 8). Meigen's \\"Avant-Propos\\" (preface) is dated \\"le premier Germinal an 7\\" (21 March 1799) and Baumhauer's \\"Introduction\\" is dated \\"le 10 Messidor an 7\\" and so the work dates from early 1800. Nouvelle Classification is a \\"prodrome\\" (A prodromus is a preliminary publication intended as a basis for future work) to a planned larger work, following discussion. The Diptera are divided into 88 genera, each with a short diagnosis in French and the number of European species which Meigen recognised as belonging to each genus. No nominal species are cited. Of the 88 nominal genera, 25 had already been named by previous authors and 63 were new. *1803 Meigen published Versuch einer neuen Gattungseintheilung der europ√§ischen zweifl√ºgeligen Insekten. in Magazin f√ºr Insektenkunde (2: 259-281). This proposes a revised scheme. Meigen makes no reference to the 1800 Nouvelle Classification and only two of the new names proposed in 1800 are used. The total number of genera recognised in Gattungseintheilung der europ√§ischen zweifl√ºgeligen Insekten is 114, each with a brief diagnosis, and each with one or more nominal species referred to it. This is the basic plan for the two later works. In 1908 Hendel reintroduced Meigen's 1800 names and republished Nouvelle Classification des Mouches A Deux Ailes which had priority. This was controversial Stone, Alan, 1941 The generic names of Meigen 1800 and their proper application (Diptera) Annals of the Entomological Society of America Volume 34, Number 2, June 1941, pp. 404-418.. and in 1963 the 1800 names (and the publication) were suppressed by the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature. *1828-1830 Plates for Christian Rudolph Wilhelm Wiedemann, Aussereurop√§ische Zweifl√ºgelige Insekten / beschrieben von Christ.

There are other specimens, including types in the Natural History Museum of Vienna. Because Meigen exchanged specimens, including types with other entomologists the collection in MNHN contains not only Meigen type material, but types of other authors as well (such as Carl Fredrik Fall√©n, Johan Christian Fabricius, Christian Rudolph Wilhelm Wiedemann, and Pietro Rossi) and Meigen types are found in the collections of these authors of species names.

The Royal Spanish Academy and the Mexican Academy of Language give the definition of the word as referring to something \\"belonging to Mexico City\\",Diccionario de la lengua espa√±ola - Vig√©sima segunda edici√≥n in particular referring to people native to the capital. The term Chilango is widely used and refers to a variety of people, ranging from those who speak with a Chilango accent, to those who live, work or study in Mexico City. Two other terms used for a resident of Mexico City are Defe√±o (derived from D.F., Distrito Federal and not an official Spanish word) and Capitalino, which are also sometimes used both in a positive or a derogatory sense, although the latter is generally accepted as a neutral demonym. The terminology can also be used for a person born in the suburbs or surrounding areas of Mexico City who has moved to Mexico City. It has a negative connotation when used principally by someone in one of the States of Mexico. \\"Chilango pride\\" has also led to the term \\"Chilangolandia\\" in reference to Mexico City. The embracing of this term also led to the start of the publication of Chilango in November 2003. It is a monthly humorous magazine parodying elements of Mexico City and outsiders' perspectives of it while also including articles about actual events. It included within its pages the Time Out city guide, but this was retired in early 2007. Chilango was described in the December 2004 version as: There are many theories on the origin of the word \\"chilango\\". One of them is that it derives from the Nahuatl word IxachitlƒÅn, that actually refers to the whole of the American continent. The word \\"shilango\\" has also been documented to have been used in the Veracruz area to mean people from central Mexico, and coming from the Maya \\"xilaan\\" meaning curly or frizzy haired. Yet another theory is that it comes from the Nahuatl \\"chilan-co\\", meaning where the red ones are, and referring to the skin, reddened by the cold, and used to refer to Aztecs by the Nahua people in the Gulf of Mexicohttp://www.letraslibres.com/revista/letrillas/chilango-como-gentilicio Letras Libres - \\" Chilango como gentilicio\\" por Gabriel Zaid, Letras Libres, 1999 There is a popular phrase used by people outside Mexico City that says: \\"Haz patria, mata a un chilango\\" that means Be patriotic, kill a chilango. It's not intended to be used literally but with a mocking tone instead. The phrase, coined in the state of Sonora, reflects an attitude common in the northern states of disdain and rivalry against residents of Mexico City, that peaked in the 1980s.¬øYa nadie hace Patria? La muerte del antichilanguismo- Jesusa Cervantes, La Jornada 1999 Then, as a response to this used phrase, Chilangos themselves began to add \\"Haz patria, educa a un provinciano\\", which means, Be patriotic, educate a rural person.

He was also a draftsman and painter, and made celebrated series of engravings of working-class Parisians.Le Petit Robert des Noms Propres, Paris (2010) Biography Bouchardon was born in Chaumont-en- Bassigny, the son of a sculptor and architect, Jean-Baptiste Bouchardon. He learned sculpture first in the studio of his father, and then with Guillaume Coustou. He won the Prix de Rome of the Acad√©mie royale de peinture et de sculpture in 1722, and as a consequence lived and worked in Rome from 1722 to 1732. He resisted the more ornate tendencies of the Rocaille style, and moved toward neoclassicism. While in Rome, he specialized in busts of distinguished patrons, including Pope Benedict XIII. In 1726 he also began a copy of the Barberini Faun a Classical Helenic sculpture from the Barberini Palace in Rome. His copy arrived in France in 1732, and was greatly admired, and aided the transition of French sculpture toward neoclassicism.Le Petit Robert des Noms Propres, Paris (2010) In 1775 the duc de Chartres bought it for his elaborate garden at Parc Monceau. It is now in the Louvre. On his return to France, he was employed in the royal art workshops at the Palace of Versailles, Working alongside his two brothers, he made statues for the Gardens of Versailles, including the statue of Proteus in the Basin of Neptune. In his style, he resisted the flamboyant Rocaille style of his contemporaries, and tended toward more classical models. Bouchardon sculpted \\"Cupid Fashioning a Bow out of the Club of Hercules\\", now in the Louvre, for the Gardens of Versailles. It depicted a realistic, unidealized adolescent Cupid in a natural posture, which was completely in contrast with the classical ideals. He first presented the model in terra cotta at the 1739 Salon, then a full-scale model in 1746. He was commissioned to make a marble version, which he created between 1747 and 1750. The work established his reputation, and also his fortune; he was paid a remarkable 21,000 livres. His last completed major sculptural work was the Fontaine des Quatre-Saisons on the Rue de Grenelle in Paris, commissioned in 1739, and completed six years later in 1745. This work featured a classical colonnade, decorated with statuary. It was similar in its arrangement of statues made by Michelangelo in the Medici Chapel in Florence.Duby, Georges and Daval, Jean-Luc, La Sculpture de l'Antiquit√© au XXe Si√®cle, (2013) pp. 313 His sculpture was widely admired. It was featured, along with a fine engraving of the fountain, in the article on classical sculpture by J. F. Blondel in the French Encyclopedia of 1765.Encyclop√©die, \\"Sculpture,\\"' volume XIV, Neufchatel, 1765, pg. 834. However, it also drew considerable criticism, the colossal sculptural work on a narrow street provided only a tiny trickle of water. The project was criticized by Voltaire in a letter to the Count de Caylus in 1739, as the fountain was still under construction: Bouchardon was commissioned to make one last major work, an equestrian statue of Louis XV for the Place de la Concorde, to commemorate France's victory in the War of Austrian Succession. He died before the work was finished. It was completed by Jean-Baptiste Pigalle, but was destroyed during the French Revolution.

The subjects and themes were chosen by the Acad√©mie des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres and passed through an elaborate process of critiques before approval, which involved the King himself. Drawings and counterproofs for these jetons are now held at various museums and collections around the world including the Institut de France, the Mus√©e de la Monnaie, and the Biblioth√®que nationale. Family Bouchardon's brother, Jacques- Philippe Bouchardon, was also a sculptor, who became first sculptor to the king of Sweden. Drawings and etchings Bouchardon was particularly skilled at drawing, and produced two series of drawings of working people in the streets of Paris. His drawings, made with sanguine or reddish chalk, were originally used to make a series of smaller ceramic sculptures of Parisian characters, such as street vendors (see gallery). Later they were made into a series of etchings by the historian and engraver Anne Claude de Caylus, under the title Studies made of the Lower Class or the Cries of Paris. These became a very valuable source of information for later social historians.Le Petit Robert des Noms Propres (2010) Edm√© Bouchardon - Study for the Equestrian Statue of Louis XV - WGA02875.jpgStudy for the Equestrian Statue of Louis XV, c. 1750; Louvre Museum File:America MET DP805450.jpgDrawing of the continent America for a sculptural design (Metropolitan Museum of Art) Edm√© Bouchardon - Design for Fountain in Niche - Google Art Project.jpgDesign for Fountain in Niche, c. 1735; Cooper‚ÄìHewitt, National Design Museum File:Design for a Token- Tr√©sor Royal 1748 MET DP805457.jpgDesign for a royal jeton, or commemorative token (1748) File:Diana at the Bath After Returning from the Hunt MET 53.600.2443.jpgDiana at the Bath after Returning from the Hunt (1730‚Äì60) (Metropolitan Museum) File:√âtudes prises dans le bas peuple ou les Cris de Paris - Porteur d'eau.jpgA water carrier (1742) (Metropolitan Museum) File:√âtudes prises dans le bas peuple ou les Cris de Paris - Cotterets.jpgA firewood seller in Paris (1748) (Metropolitan Museum) File:Oyster Seller MET DP817840.jpgOyster seller in Paris (1738) (Metropolitan Museum) References Bibliography * Gerhard Bissell, Bouchardon, Edme, in: Allgemeines K√ºnstlerlexikon (Artists of the World), Vol. 13, Saur, Munich 1996, from p. 425 (in German). * Duby, Georges and Daval, Jean-Luc, La Sculpture de l'Antiquit√© au XXe Si√®cle, (French translation from German), Taschen, (2013), () * Geese, Uwe, Section on Baroque sculpture in L'Art Baroque ‚Äì Architecture ‚Äì Sculpture ‚Äì Peinture (French translation from German), H.F.

Ownership of the territory changed frequently during the medieval period, and Bohain continued to find its lordship disputed in the wars of the early modern period. Traces of fortifications (ditches, cannonballs, bases of walls) can not only be found near to the primary school, but also in other spots of the town.

Although being famous in biological sciences for the MWC model, the identification and purification of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor and the theory of epigenesis by synapse selection are also notable scientific achievements. Changeux is known by the non-scientific public for his ideas regarding the connection between mind and physical brain. As put forth in his book, Conversations on Mind, Matter and Mathematics, Changeux strongly supports the view that the nervous system functions in a projective rather than reactive style and that interaction with the environment, rather than being instructive, results in the selection amongst a diversity of preexisting internal representations. Biography Changeux was born in Domont, France to Marcel Changeux and Jeanne Beno√Æt. He entered the √âcole Normale Sup√©rieure in 1955, where he obtained a Bachelor's degree (Licence) in 1957 and a Master's degree (Diplome d'√âtudes Sup√©rieure) in 1958. He also received his agr√©gation in natural science the same year. He began his scientific career during his ENS years during summer internships in Banyuls-sur-Mer where he identified a new genus of parasitic Copepod. He pursued PhD studies at the Pasteur Institute under the direction of Jacques Monod and Francois Jacob, and gained his doctorate in 1964. Changeux then left France for postdoctoral studies first at the University of California Berkeley (1965‚Äì1966) then at Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, New-York (1967). He returned to France as attach√© to the chair of Molecular Biology held by Jacques Monod. In 1972, he became director of the Unit of Molecular Neurobiology at the Pasteur Institute, where he received a professorship in 1975. In 1975, Changeux was elected professor at the Coll√®ge de France, chair of Cell Communications, position that he held until 2006. Changeux is author of more than 600 scientific articles and several books, technical or for general audience. Scientific achievements All his scientific career, Changeux has been faithful to a handful of scientific questions, at molecular, cellular and brain levels. If one needs to seek a unifying theme to all of them, it is the conviction that selection is the basis of life processes, rather than instruction. While started as separate lines of investigations, all the research threads were tied in the recent decades within the study of allosteric mechanisms as a basis of for the involvement of nicotinic receptors in cognitive functions. =Allostery= Diagram representing an allosteric transition of a protein between R and T states, stabilised by an Agonist, and Inhibitor and a Substrate. Adapted from Changeux and Edelstein (2004) Nicotinic Acetylcholine Receptors: From Molecular Biology to Cognition. During his PhD studies in the laboratory of Jacques Monod and Francois Jacob, Changeux studied the allosteric regulations of enzymes, that is the modulation of their activity by compounds different from their substrates.Changeux J.-P. (1961). The feedback control mechanism of biosynthetic L-threonine deaminase by L-isoleucine. Cold Spring Harbor. Symp. Quant. Biol. 26: 313-318.Changeux J.-P. (1963). Allosteric Interactions on biosynthetic L-theonine deaminase from E. coli K12. Cold Spring Harb Symp Quant Biol, 28: 497-504Monod J., Changeux J.-P., and Jacob. F. (1963). Allosteric proteins and cellular control systems. J. Mol. Biol. 6: 306-329 This work led to the development of the model of concerted transitions for allosteric proteins.Monod J., Wyman J., and Changeux J.-P. (1965). On the nature of allosteric transitions: a plausible model. J. Mol. Biol. 12: 88-118.Rubin M.M., Changeux J.-P. (1966). On the nature of allosteric transitions ; implications of non-exclusive ligand binding. J. Mol. Biol. 21: 265-274. The main ideas behind this theory are: 1) proteins can exist under various conformations in thermal equilibrium in the absence of regulators. The allosteric regulators merely shift the equilibrium between the conformations, stabilizing the ones for which they display the highest affinity, and 2) all the subunits of a symmetrical multimeric protein exist in the same conformation, the transition taking place in a concerted fashion. The resulting model explains the observed cooperativity without a progressive change of biophysical parameters. This conceptual framework is still the principal model used to explain the function of cooperative proteins such as hemoglobin. In his PhD thesis, Changeux suggested that the recognition and transmission of signals by membrane, and in particular by synapses, could use the same mechanisms as the allosteric regulation of enzymes. More than forty years of research would follow, mainly focussed on nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (see below). In 1967, Changeux extended the MWC model to bi-dimensional lattice of receptorsChangeux J.-P., Thi√©ry J.-P., Tung Y., and Kittel C. (1967). On the cooperativity of biological membranes. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 57, 335-341. (an idea that would also be developed three decades afterward by Dennis BrayBray D, Levin MD, Morton-Firth CJ (1998) Receptor clustering as a cellular mechanism to control sensitivity. Nature, 393: 85-88.). He then applied this idea to the post-synaptic membrane of electric organs (analog to striated muscle).Changeux J.-P., Podleski T.R. (1968). On the excitability and cooperativity of electroplax membrane. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 59:944-950Cartaud J., Benedetti E.L., Cohen J.B., Meunier J.C., Changeux J.-P. (1973) Presence of a lattice structure in membrane fragments rich in nicotinic receptor protein from the electric organ of Torpedo marmorata. FEBS Lett. 33: 109-113. His team demonstrated the existence of several interconvertible states for the nicotinic receptor, resting, open and desensitized, displaying different affinities for the ligands, such as the endogenous agonist acetylcholine.Weber M., David-Pfeuty M.T., Changeux J.-P. (1975). Regulation of binding properties of the nicotinic receptor protein by cholinergic ligands in membrane fragments from Torpedo marmorata. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 72: 3443-3447.Sugiyama H., Changeux J.-P. (1975). Interconversion between different states of affinity for acetylcholine of the cholinergic receptor protein from Torpedo marmorata. Eur. J. Biochem. 55: 505-515.Heidmann T., Changeux J.-P. (1979). Fast kinetic studies on the interaction of a fluorescent agonist with the membrane-bound acetylcholine receptor from T. marmorata. Eur. J. Biochem. 94: 255-279. The transitions between the states followed different kinetics, and those kinetics plus the differential affinities sufficed to explain the shape of the post-synaptic potential. A full mechanistic model of the nicotinic receptor from striated muscle (or electric organ) was to be provided much later, when Changeux collaborated with Stuart Edelstein, another specialist of allostery, who worked decades on hemoglobin.Edelstein S., Schaad O., Henry E., Bertrand D. Changeux J.-P. (1996). A kinetic mechanism for nicotinic acetylcholine receptors based on multiple allosteric transitions. Biol. Cybern. 75: 361-379 In addition to the allosteric modulation of the channel gating by the agonists, many other regulations of the ligand-gated ion channels activity have since been discovered. The modulators bind to a variety of allosteric sites, whether on the agonist binding sites, other binding sites at the subunit interfaces, on the cytoplasmic part of the protein or in the transmembrane domain.Changeux J.-P. (2012). The concept of allosteric modulation: an overview. Drug Discov. Today 10: e223-e228 The concept of an allosteric pharmacology for ion channels was developed over the years. In addition to the well known GABAA receptor positive allosteric modulators (such as benzodiazepines and barbiturate drugs), one can find antiparasitic drug such as ivermectin and glutamate receptor modulators used against Alzheimer's disease such as aniracetam. =Nicotinic receptor structure= Neurotransmitter acetylcholine bound to the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor. Adapted from In 1970, Changeux isolated the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor of the eel electric organ, the first ever isolated membrane pharmacological receptor,Changeux J.-P., Kasai M., Huchet M., Meunier J.-C.

(1970). The use of a snake venom toxin to characterize the cholinergic receptor protein. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 67: 1241-1247.

Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 110:E3987-3996 =Stabilization of synapses by neuronal activity= In 1973, together with Philippe Courr√®ge and Antoine Danchin, Changeux proposed a model describing how, during development of the nervous system, the activity of a network could cause the stabilization or regression of the synapses involvedChangeux J.-P., Courr√®ge P., Danchin A. (1973). A theory of the epigenesis of neural networks by selective stabilization of synapses. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 70: 2974-2978. and illustrated it with the neuromuscular junction. This model is effectively the precursor of the \\"neural Darwinism\\" theory further promoted by Gerald Edelman. Changeux later extended and illustrated further this idea.Changeux J.-P., Danchin, A. (1976). Selective stabilization of developing synapses as a mechanism for the specification of neuronal networks. Nature 264: 705-712.

Nature. 1983 Apr 14;302(5909):609-11. =Nicotinic receptor function= Photo by Erling Mandelmann While until the 1990s, Changeux's group studied the structure of the nicotinic receptor present in electric organs of electric eel and torpedo, the investigations of the physiological role of those receptors were mostly focussed on two model systems: the nicotinic receptors of the neuromuscular junction, the synapse linking the motorneuron to the skeletal muscle, and the nicotinic receptors of the brain, notably in relation with nicotine addiction. From the mid-1980s, the group studied the compartimentalisation of the muscle cell upon development, as a model of synaptogenesis and in relation with the theoretical work on epigenesis. In particular, the group focussed on the accumulation of nicotinic receptors in the post-synaptic region upon development, concommitent to a switch of receptor identity. They were able to decrypt the different signalling pathways involved in the response to synaptic activity, showing that the accumulation resulted from an inhibition of gene transcription outside the synaptic region due to electrical activity triggering an uptake of calcium and activation of PKC,Betz H., Changeux J.-P.

The 1990s saw the progressive shift of interest of Changeux from the neuromuscular junction to the nicotinic receptors expressed in the brain. Among the notable achievements of the group is the discovery that neuronal nicotinic receptors are highly permeable to calciumMulle C., Choquet D., Korn H., Changeux J.-P. (1992).

Nature 436: 103-107 =Modeling cognition= From the mid-1990s, Changeux developed an activity of computational modeling in order to investigate the neuronal bases of cognitive functions. This research was mainly performed in collaboration with Stanislas Dehaene, now leading the INSERM-CEA Cognitive Neuroimaging Unit. They notably modeled the acquisition of song recognition in birdsDehaene S., Changeux J.-P., Nadal J.P. (1987). Neural networks that learn temporal sequences by selection. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Professional and non-scientific activities The publication of his book Neuronal Man: The Biology of The Mind in 1985 brought Changeux celebrity status among the wider public. Since then, he authored or co-authored several other books inspired by his teaching at the College de France: notably, Conversations on Mind Matter and Mathematics with the mathematician Alain Connes (1998), What Makes Us Think with the philosopher Paul Ricoeur (2002) and the Physiology of truth (2002) that are acknowledged as having initiated an instructive dialogue between the two often-hostile disciplines of neuroscience and philosophy. He has also been concerned by the relationships between aesthetic experience and the brain in Raison & Plaisir (1994), The true the good the beautiful: a neurobiological approach (2012) and recently Les neurones enchant√©s. (2014) where he debates the issue of artistic creation with the music composers Pierre Boulez and Philippe Manoury. Changeux received the Lewis Thomas Prize for Writing about Science, Rockefeller University, New-York, 2005. Changeux has also been the curator of three major exhibitions on Art and Science: De Nicolo dell'Abate √† Nicolas Poussin: aux sources du Classicisme 1550-1650 Mus√©e Bossuet Meaux in 1988, L'√Çme au Corps, Arts et Sciences, 1793-1993 (with G√©rard R√©gnier) Galeries nationales du Grand Palais Paris in 1993-1994 and La lumi√®re au si√®cle des Lumi√®res et aujourd'hui. Art et science : de la biologie de la vision √† une nouvelle conception du monde Galeries Poirel Nancy in 2005. Changeux has also chaired the inter-ministry commission for the conservation of the French artistic heritage since 1989, and has been member of the scientific council of the International Agency of museums since 2007. Last, throughout his career, Changeux has been concerned by the ethical consequences for the city and for the society in general of the recent progress in the Neuroscience. Changeux has headed the National Advisory Committee on Bioethics in France from 1992 to 1998. He organised a scientific conference on the topic, that led to a book he edited, fondements naturel de l'ethique.

It is the flagship project for both the director and the studio. Attempting to address the failures of Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within, the film is an attempt to merge anime-style visuals with a faster, action-oriented plot more palatable to Western audiences. The film's plot features many archetypes taken from Final Fantasy-style Japanese console RPGs; a young male resistance fighter, a young girl with special powers who unknowingly is her planet's Messiah, an evil \\"right-hand man\\", and a small, cute pet mascot. It is the spiritual successor to Elysium (2003) which takes place in the same universe as the film. Plot Ark takes place on a dying alien world in which a global war between two technologically advanced human civilizations has reduced the planet to a wasteland. The only way to escape the world is by activating the Ark, an ancient giant robot capable of supporting a human city as well as traveling through space. James Woods plays Jallak, the military general of the reigning civilization, the Storrians, who captured the Ark from the Ceveans. But they are unable to get the Ark to work in order to save their people. The Ceveans, having been enslaved and with only the wasteland to roam free are constantly attacked and brutalised by the Storrians. A leader of their resistance movement is a young resistance fighter named Rogan. Rogan is arrested during a resistance uprising, but manages to escape. He bumps into the general's adopted daughter Amarinth, whom the general had secretly rescued from a Cevean hibernation pod cluster where they had hidden their children for safety. They then meet again during a civilian protest rally and she offers to help hide him and tend to his wounds. Rogan goes with her back to her apartment and meets her pet JuJu, but then vanishes when he discovers she's the Storrian general's daughter. Baramanda, the Empress's manipulative right-hand man, arrives unexpectedly to take Amarinth into custody after discovering the truth of her lineage. Rogan helps her escape from Baramanda and takes her to the resistance base within the slave quarters of the Ark. There she meets with an elderly man who explains Amarinth's birthright with the help of JuJu, who turns out to have originally belonged to him. Unknown to Rogan, and to Amarinth herself, she turns out to be the daughter of the Cevean priestess who originally built the Ark, Amiel, who had disappeared 100 years earlier. Amiel helped construct not just the Ark the Storrians hold, but another known as The Ark of York. The plans for the Arks passed down from the Gods (another alien race). It took all her strength to create them, causing her to fall into a deep sleep and not awaken again. Before entering her eternal hibernation, she placed her very young daughter into the hidden hibernation pod. Then her body was secretly hidden by her people until discovered by the Storrians. They find Amiel's molecular structure enables her body to generate a pulsing electronic field throughout her bloodstream. Not only does this make her body perfectly preserved despite how long she had been inactive, it is the reason the Arks will not work: she and Amarinth are descendants of the gods themselves and only they have the ability to pilot the Arks. A cell of her dead blood can supply power to an entire building, but it becomes apparent that no matter how much energy Amiel's body retains, since she is dead it's not enough to move the ark. Both civilizations scramble to use Amiel's daughter, Amarinth, to activate their Ark and leave the other civilization behind to die. However, Amarinth, who has ties to both civilizations, wishes to try to find a way to use her power to save everyone. She is opposed by the lifeforce-stealing wraith Baramanda, who wishes to steal the power of the Ark for his own selfish purposes. Amarinth after going to the Ark of York, refuses to pilot it and leave the Storrians behind. Despite her lineage as a Cevean, she was raised as a Storrian. When she finds out her father, Jallak, had been arrested for high treason and was to be executed for hiding her, she demands that Rogan and the others help her rescue him if they want her help. They agree and return to save him. After freeing Jallak, Baramunda tries to drain Amarith's blood but is stopped by Amiel who awakens momentarily to stop him. All escape but Jallak remains behind to save his people, as the Ark starts to fall apart. Rogan takes Amarinth back to The Ark of York as Baramanda merges with the core of the other Ark and awakens it. Amarinth discovers that, just as her mother Amiel died in constructing the Arks, so she would perish to pilot one. Rogan and Amarinth kiss for the first and final time as she merges with the core of York just as The Ark comes stomping up to it. The Arks clash in a giant battle with the earth breaking down beneath their feet. Amarinth grabs the city plate off of SidArk as Jallak and his friend set the self-destruct mechanism. They perish in the explosion as the planet begins to crumble. Rogan narrates at the end as it shows The Ark of York kneeling with the SidArk city plate on another planet flourishing with vegetation. He states that no one knew both civilizations would make it and neither does anyone think it would work out, living together, sharing the planet. He continues saying that it was hard to imagine that their old world, which was now no more, might have looked like this before the war. So the Storrians and Ceveans are going to try to coexist, to preserve this planet and Amarinth's sacrifice. It's difficult at times, and Rogan wishes that Amarinth was there to bridge the gap between the two civilizations. He states that they could have learned so much from her, but that they already had.

He was called \\"one modest man who knows the power of music\\" by Edward Everett Hale. These include a masterful cantata and a large oratorio in three parts, modeled after Handel's Messiah. Early life and education Edwin Arthur Jones was born at 9 Pearl Street in Stoughton, Massachusetts on June 28, 1853. After studies at the New England Conservatory of Music in violin, organ and harmony, Jones entered Dartmouth College in 1872. That same year, when he was only 19, Jones was a violinist among the thousands of instrumentalists and singers who played at the World's Peace Jubilee and International Musical Festival in Boston, organized by bandmaster Patrick Gilmore. One of the special invited guests was the Viennese composer, Johann Strauss Jr., who performed some of his popular waltzes. E.A. Jones graduated from Dartmouth College in 1876, where he was Class President, Director of the Dartmouth Glee Club, First violinist in the Dartmouth College Orchestra, one of the editors of the college newspaper, and he was named Captain of the Dartmouth Big Green baseball team in 1875.Hall, Roger L. E.A. Jones: His Life and Music. p. 5-6. First Compositions After graduation, he went to Baltimore to help his family run a store. His first major composition was a delightful set of waltzes for solo piano, The Farewell Waltzes, which he had composed while at Dartmouth College. This composition was published in Baltimore in 1874. He also made an arrangement for chamber orchestra. Six years later, in 1880, his First String Quartet was performed at the Peabody Concervatory in Baltimore, where it was well received. He then returned to his home town in Massachusetts. Orchestra Leader and Composer After returning to Stoughton, Jones formed his own orchestra of 20 musicians. A photo of his orchestra was taken in 1885.Hall, Roger L.,E.A. Jones: His Life and Music. p. 16 In 1881, he composed his masterpiece ‚Äî a large cantata for soloists, chorus, organ and orchestra, Song of Our Saviour. This cantata was never performed during his lifetime and received its world premiere over one hundred years later on May 3, 1992. The cantata was a reworking of an earlier composition, The Nativity Hymn, one of only four to receive honorable mention in 1879 in the Cincinnati College of Music competition, judged by the distinguished American conductor, Theodore Thomas. The other major choral work by Jones was his oratorio, Easter Concert, for soloists, chorus and orchestra. It was published in 1890 in a piano-vocal score by White-Smith Music Publishing Company in Boston. This version received its first modern day performance on April 26, 1981. Unfortunately, the orchestral parts have not been located for the oratorio. Besides his two large choral works, Jones also composed other vocal works, including: Blessing and Glory: Fugue - Tenors and Basses (1874); Praise Ye The Lord - Tenors and Basses (1874); Wake, Maiden Wake - Tenors and Basses (1881); King Christian - Bass solo and SATB Chorus (1886); Old Stoughton - SATB Chorus (1886); Ode to Music - SATB Chorus (1888); Love Hailed a Little Maid - Soprano solo and piano (1888); Snowflakes - Soprano solo and piano (1888); Hail, Smiling Morn! - Bass solo and chamber ensemble (undated); Lord, Dismiss Is With Thy Blessing - SATB Chorus (undated). Among his instrumental works are: Two String Trios - in D Major and G Major (1878); String Quartet No. 1 in F Major (1880); Dedication March - for orchestra (1881); Suite Ancienne - for orchestra (1886); String Quartet No 2 in G minor (1887) - first performed at Mrs. J. L. (Isabella Stewart) Gardener's home in Boston by the Kneissel Quartet in 1889.Hall, Roger L., E.A. Jones: His Life and Music p. 7, 13-15. Jones was a member of the two choral societies in town: The Stoughton Musical Society, founded in 1786 and now the oldest choral society in America, and The Musical Society in Stoughton, founded in 1802, disbanded in 1982. He was largely responsible for the Stoughton Musical Society's invitation to perform at the World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago in 1893.Hall, Roger L. E.A. Jones: His Life and Music p. 10 Notes Civic Leadership E.A. Jones is also remembered for his participation as a member of the School Committee for fifteen years, Trustee of the Public Library, President of the Fortnightly Club, and Secretary of the Chicataubut Club. In addition, he designed the Stoughton Town Seal in 1892. Today, there is a school named for him on Walnut Street in Stoughton. He died at his family's home on Pearl Street on January 9, 1911, at the age of 57. External links *Edwin A. Jones and history of the Stoughton Town Seal *E.A.

The lyrics of the song describe how cannabis use is degrading the narrator's quality of life. The song, which was written in only a few minutes, rose from obscurity to popularity after it was circulated around the Internet and was featured on The Howard Stern Show. Overview The song explains how the narrator has forgotten to clean his room, failed his college class (which he plans to take next semester), sold kush (after losing his job), missed court dates, had his paycheck garnished due to missed child support payments, gambled away his car payment and became a paraplegic as the result of a police chase. The singer then reveals that he had \\"messed up [his] entire life\\" because he was \\"high\\", lost his \\"kids and wife\\" and ended up \\"sleeping on the sidewalk\\". He ultimately decides to end the song, and admits that he is \\"singing the whole thing wrong, because [he is] high\\". After this, Afroman mentions his name and birthplace (East Palmdale), describes the tumbleweed he smokes as \\"bomb as hell\\", says he does not believe in Hitler (a reference to John Lennon's \\"God\\") and ends the verse with \\"all of you skins...please give me more head\\" (a pun on skinheads). The music video was directed by Kevin Smith and featured Jay and Silent Bob smoking with Afroman, a cameo by 'Beer Man', as well as a glimpse of the Quick Stop where Clerks was filmed. Reception Afroman released his album Because I Got High in 2000; he distributed it mainly through concerts. The title track was soon posted on file-sharing service Napster and made it to The Howard Stern Show. This song was the theme song of the film Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back and was later featured in the films Disturbia, A Thousand Words, and The Perfect Score. After the success of this single, Afroman was signed to Universal Records. On the album Mobilize by punk band Anti-Flag, after several minutes of silence on the album's end track, a friend of the band called Spaz can be heard singing parts of the song with Anti-Flag. Track listing  Alternative versions  Afroman re-recorded the song with new lyrics for his 2009 album Frobama Head of State. A second re-recording of the song, called the \\"Positive Remix\\", was released by Afroman through YouTube on October 15, 2014 as part of a collaboration with Weedmaps and NORML. In contrast to the original version, the lyrics of this version deal with the positive effects of marijuana legalization. Parodies Bob Rivers included a Christmas-themed version, Be Claus I Got High, on the 2002 album White Trash Christmas, the fifth in Rivers's line of Christmas parody albums. BBC Radio 1 DJ Chris Moyles recorded a parody under the pseudonym \\"Afro-Blair\\" featuring Jon Culshaw and another impressionist singing in the guise of the serving Prime Minister Tony Blair, then Leader of the Opposition William Hague and former Prime Ministers John Major and Margaret Thatcher. The controversial parody artist Rucka Rucka Ali made a version of the song called \\"Because I'm White\\" about a white male.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJpisLytQGo A parody was made about British politician Michael Gove after his scandal involving cocaine use.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQSbav9GFfI Charts =Weekly charts= {class=\\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"text-align:center;\\" - !scope=\\"col\\"Chart (2001‚Äì02) !scope=\\"col\\"Peak position - !scope=\\"row\\" - !scope=\\"row\\" - !scope=\\"row\\" - !scope=\\"row\\" - !scope=\\"row\\" - !scope=\\"row\\"Europe (European Hot 100 Singles) align=\\"center\\"2 - !scope=\\"row\\" - !scope=\\"row\\" - !scope=\\"row\\" - !scope=\\"row\\" - !scope=\\"row\\" - !scope=\\"row\\" - !scope=\\"row\\" - !scope=\\"row\\" - !scope=\\"row\\" - !scope=\\"row\\"Portugal (AFP) align=\\"center\\"2 - !scope=\\"row\\"Romania (Romanian Top 100)  35 - !scope=\\"row\\" - !scope=\\"row\\" - !scope=\\"row\\" - !scope=\\"row\\" - !scope=\\"row\\" - !scope=\\"row\\" - !scope=\\"row\\" - !scope=\\"row\\" - !scope=\\"row\\" - !scope=\\"row\\" - !scope=\\"row\\" - !scope=\\"row\\"US Rap Songs (Billboard)  19 - !scope=\\"row\\" } =Year-end charts= {class=\\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"text- align:center;\\" - !scope=\\"col\\"Chart (2001) !scope=\\"col\\"Position - !scope=\\"row\\"Australia (ARIA)  14 - !scope=\\"row\\"Austria (√ñ3 Austria Top 40)  13 - !scope=\\"row\\"Belgium (Ultratop Flanders)  9 - !scope=\\"row\\"Germany (Official German Charts)  26 - !scope=\\"row\\"Netherlands (Dutch Top 40)  42 - !scope=\\"row\\"Netherlands (Single Top 100)  28 - !scope=\\"row\\"Sweden (Sverigetopplistan)  36 - !scope=\\"row\\"Switzerland (Schweizer Hitparade)  23 - !scope=\\"row\\"UK Singles (Official Charts Company)  10 - !scope=\\"col\\"Chart (2002) !scope=\\"col\\"Position - !scope=\\"row\\"Austria (√ñ3 Austria Top 40)  20 - !scope=\\"row\\"Belgium (Ultratop Wallonia)  42 - !scope=\\"row\\"France (SNEP)  26 - !scope=\\"row\\"Switzerland (Schweizer Hitparade)  54 } =Decade-end charts= {class=\\"wikitable plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"text-align:center;\\" - !scope=\\"col\\"Chart (2000‚Äì2009) !scope=\\"col\\"Position - !scope=\\"row\\"UK Singles (Official Charts Company)Radio 1 Chart of the Decade, as presented by Nihal on December 29, 2009  71 }  Certifications  References External links 2001 songs 2001 debut singles Afroman songs Number-one singles in Austria Number-one singles in Denmark Number-one singles in Germany Irish Singles Chart number-one singles Number-one singles in New Zealand Number-one singles in Norway UK Singles Chart number-one singles Songs about cannabis Songs written for films Number-one singles in Scotland Comedy rap songs Universal Records singles Uptown Records singles ","title":"Because I Got High"},{"id":"1798777","text":"Janey Godley (born Jane Godley Currie; 20 January 1961) is a Scottish stand-up comedian, actress and writer from Glasgow. Early life Jane Godley Currie was born on 20 January 1961 in Campsie, then part of Stirlingshire. Her parents were James ‚ÄúJim‚Äù Currie (died 2017), a chemical technician, and his first wife, Annie Fleming Currie (n√©e Percy; 1935‚Äì1982). Godley‚Äôs parents married in 1954 and went on to have four children together, of which Godley was the youngest. They separated in the mid-1970s. Godley was raised on Kenmore Street in Shettleston, a district in the East End of Glasgow. Living in poverty, which was rife in the East End during that time, Godley left school at 16 with no qualifications. Godley and her sister, Ann Crawford, were sexually abused by their maternal uncle, David Percy. Percy, who was 12 years older than Godley, molested her and her sister for a number of years during their childhoods. Percy was charged for the crimes in 1993 after the sisters decided to come forward, and was later found guilty and sentenced to two years in prison in 1996. In 1980, aged 19, Godley married Sean Storrie. Storrie, who has Asperger syndrome https://medium.com/@janeygodley_42972/living-with-a-man- who-has-aspergers-b015c02f3798, was born into a Glasgow gangster family.https://www.scotsman.com/news/mum-was-murdered-and-my-laws-are- gangsters-2463817 Godley and her husband have a daughter, Ashley (born 1986), who also has autism spectrum disorder like her father, and is also a stand-up comedian.

Greenshields was never charged by police for Annie Currie‚Äôs death despite calls for an investigation from her family. Career Godley began her stand up career in 1994. Godley decided to use a stage name, saying to her husband: \\"I don't want to be Janey Storrie any more, because your family let me down, and I don't want to be Janey Currie because my family let me down. I'm going to use my middle name and legally become Janey Godley. The only family who haven't let me down are the Godleys because I don't know them.\\" She legally changed her name from Janey Godley Storrie to Janey Godley in 1995.https://medium.com/@janeygodley_42972/my-dad-said-was-i-a-good- dad-67f258b9cf82 She won an award for the \\"Best Show Concept\\" at the New Zealand International Comedy Festival in 2002, and the \\"Spirit of the Festival\\" in 2006. In 2005 her autobiography Handstands in the Dark was published. In 2006, she was a finalist for the Edinburgh Evening Times' \\"Scotswoman of the Year\\" award. In 2002, 2006, 2008 and 2009, she was nominated as \\"Best International Guest\\" by the New Zealand Comedy Guild. Her TV appearances include River City, Sam Delaney's News Thing, The Alex Salmond Show and Have I Got News for You. She appears in the film Wild Rose. Godley often makes spoof voice-overs of videos.

Political activism Godley is a supporter of the Scottish National Party, and Scottish independence. In February 2016, Godley joined a group of comedians on a tour of the UK in support of Labour party leader Jeremy Corbyn, although she is a supporter of the Scottish National Party. In 2016, Godley was pictured standing outside Donald Trump's Turnberry Golf resort holding a sign stating \\"Trump is a Cunt\\", which went viral. She was prevented from approaching her subject by Police Scotland.

Godbe The Godbeites were members of the Godbeite Church, officially called the Church of Zion, organized in 1870 by William S. Godbe. This dissident offshoot of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints was aimed toward embracing all belief systems. Known for embracing spiritualism and mysticism, the church died out by the 1880s. In 1868, Godbe and other Mormon merchants began criticizing the economic demands and policies of Brigham Young in Utah Magazine, a periodical that would eventually become The Salt Lake Tribune. Godbe and several other proponents were excommunicated from the church on October 25, 1869. Godbe wanted to reform the LDS Church and believed that political reform‚Äînamely, breaking Young's control over secular matters in the territory‚Äîcould help spur religious reform. The Godbeites were the original core of Utah Territory's Liberal Party, although as the party became more explicitly anti-Mormon and critical of polygamy, the Godbeite influence on the Liberal Party died out.

After Minin's death his property rights passed to his widow, Tatyana Semyonovna, and his son. A royal decree was issued on July 5, 1616, confirming the family's possession of an estate in the Nizhny Novgorod district consisting of the town of Bogorodskoye with its associated villages. Additionally, Nefed Minin owned property in the Kremlin of Nizhny Novgorod, although after the completion of his service, he lived mostly in Moscow where he worked as a government clerk.

They work in shifts. The shifts are often rotational. Workers are considered to be part-time if they commonly work fewer than 30 hours per week. According to the International Labour Organization, the number of part- time workers has increased from one-quarter to a half in the past 20 years in most developed countries, excluding the United States. There are many reasons for working part-time, including the desire to do so, having one's hours cut back by an employer and being unable to find a full-time job. The International Labour Organisation Convention 175 requires that part-time workers be treated no less favourably than full-time workers.ILO Part Time Work Convention No 175 In some cases the nature of the work itself may require that the employees be classified part as part-time workers. For example, some amusement parks are closed during winter months and keep only a skeleton crew on hand for maintenance and office work. As a result of this cutback in staffing during the off season, employees who operate rides, run gaming stands, or staff concession stands may be classified as part-time workers owing to the months long down time during which they may be technically employed, but not necessarily on active duty. Part-time contracts in Europe =European Union= In the EU, there is a strong East‚ÄìWest divide, where: \\"in Central and Eastern European countries part-time work remains a marginal phenomenon even among women, while the Western countries have embraced it much more widely.\\" The highest percentage of part- time work is in the Netherlands (see below) and the lowest in Bulgaria. There is also a gap between women (32.1% EU average in 2015) and men (8.9%). The Netherlands has by far the highest percentage of part-time workers in the EU In 2012, 76.9% of women and 24.9% of men worked part-time. The high percentage of women working part-time has been explained by social norms and the historical context of the country, where women were among the last in Europe to enter the workforce, and when they did, most of them did so on a part-time basis; according to The Economist, fewer Dutch men had to fight in the World Wars of the 20th century, and so Dutch women did not experience working for pay at rates women in other countries did. The wealth of the country, coupled with the fact that \\"[Dutch] politics was dominated by Christian values until the 1980s\\" meant that Dutch women were slower to enter into the workforce. Research in 2016 led by professor Stijn Baert (Ghent University) debunked the idea that part-time work by students is an asset for their CV in respect of later employment chances. =United Kingdom= *Part-time Workers Directive *Part-time Workers (Prevention of Less Favourable Treatment) Regulations 2000 (SI 2000/1551) Part-time contracts outside Europe =Australia= Part- time employment in Australia involves a comprehensive framework. Part-time employees work fewer hours than their full-time counterparts within a specific industry. This can vary, but is generally less than 32 hours per week. Part- time employees within Australia are legally entitled to paid annual leave, sick leave, and having maternity leave etc. except it is covered on a 'pro- rata' (percentage) basis depending on the hours worked each week. Furthermore, as a part-time employee is guaranteed a ular roster within a workplace, they are given an annular salary paid each week, fortnight, or month. Employers within Australia are obliged to provide minimum notice requirements for termination, redundancy and change of rostered hours in relation to part-time workers. As of January 2010, the number of part-time workers within Australia was approximately 3.3 million out of the 10.9 million individuals within the Australian workforce. =Canada= In Canada, part-time workers are those who usually work fewer than 30 hours per week at their main or only job.The Canadian Labour Market at a Glance, Glossary, November 25, 2008 In 2007, just over 1 in every 10 employees aged 25 to 54 worked part-time. A person who has a part-time placement is often contracted to a company or business in which they have a set of terms they agree with. 'Part-time' can also be used in reference to a student (usually in higher education) who works only few hours a day. Usually students from different nations (India, China, Mexico etc.) prefer Canada for their higher studies due to the availability of more part- time jobs. =United States= According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, working part-time is defined as working between 1 and 34 hours per week.Labor force characteristics, Full- or part-time status, U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics Division of Labor Force Statistics. In 2018, between 25 and 28 million Americans worked part-time. Typically, part-time employees in the United States are not entitled to employee benefits, such as health insurance. The Institute for Women's Policy Research reports that females are nine times likelier than males to work in a part-time capacity over a full-time capacity as a result of caregiving demands of their family members. Increasing use of part-time workers in the United States is associated with employee scheduling software often resulting in expansion of the part-time workforce, reduction of the full-time workforce and scheduling which is unpredictable and inconvenient.

Full-time employment often comes with benefits that are not typically offered to part-time, temporary, or flexible workers, such as annual leave, sickleave, and health insurance. Part-time jobs are mistakenly thought by some to not be careers. However, legislation exists to stop employers from discriminating against part-time workers so this should not be a factor when making decisions on career advancement. They generally pay more than part-time jobs per hour, and this is similarly discriminatory if the pay decision is based on part-time status as a primary factor. The Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) does not define full-time employment or part-time employment. This is a matter generally to be determined by the employer (US Department of Labor). The definition by employer can vary and is generally published in a company's Employee Handbook. Companies commonly require from 32 to 40 hours per week to be defined as full-time and therefore eligible for benefits. Full-time status varies between company and is often based on the shift the employee must work during each work week. The \\"standard\\" work week consists of five eight-hour days, commonly served between 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM or 10:00 AM to 6:00 PM totaling 40 hours. While a four-day week generally consists of four ten-hour days, it may also consist of as little as nine hours for a total of a 36-hour work week. Twelve-hour shifts are often three days per week, unless the company has the intention of paying out the employee overtime. Overtime is legally paid out anytime an employee works more than 40 hours per week. The legal minimum for overtime starts at Base Pay + One-Half. The increased payout is considered to compensate slightly for the increased fatigue which a person experiences on such long shifts. Shifts can also be very irregular, as in retail, but are still full-time if the required number of hours is reached. There are some situations where a person who needs full- time work is dropped to part-time, which is sometimes a form of constructive dismissal to avoid paying unemployment benefits to a laid-off worker. Definitions by country Full-time workweeks: * : approximately 38 hours * : 38 hours * : 40‚Äì44 hours * : 45 hours * : 37.5 hours - 40.0 hours * : 37 hours * : 35 hours (government-mandated) * : 35‚Äì40 hours * : 40 hours * : 48 hours (as per the Factories Act 1948, a person cannot work for more than 48 hours in a week) * : 43 hours * : 40 hours * : 35‚Äì40 hours * : 40 hours (often regulated to 37.5 excl. lunch break) * : 40 hours * : 40 hours * : 40 hours (not formally defined) * : 35 hours (not formally defined), 37.5 hours, or 40 hours contracts are all commonplace. * : 30 hours or more, according to the definitions in the Affordable Care Act. \\"The Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) does not define full-time employment or part-time employment. This is a matter generally to be determined by the employer.\\" A person working more than full- time is working overtime, and may be entitled to extra per-hour wages (but not salary). Academic usage ‚ÄúFull-time‚Äù can also be used in reference to a student (usually in higher education) who takes a full load of course work each academic term. The distinction between a full-time and part-time student varies markedly from country to country. As an example, in the United States a student is commonly defined as being in full-time education when they undertake 12 or more credit hours. This translates to 12 \\"hours\\" (often of 50 minutes instead of 60 minutes each) in class per week. \\"Lab hours\\" often count for less, only as one-half or one-third of a credit hour. International students must maintain full-time status for student visas. Adult students (typically up to age 22 or 23) may also fall under their parents' health insurance (and possibly car insurance and other services) if they are full- time, except for one term per year (usually summer). Students may also be eligible for elected office in student government or other student organizations only if they are full-time. The Department of Labor has a full- time student program which allows employers to pay no less than 85% of the minimum wage to the student/employee. https://www.jobfind.online/2019/12/maharashtra-police-bharti-2019.html See also * Eight-hour day * Employment *Full-time equivalent * Wage labour References Employment classifications ","title":"Full-time job"},{"id":"1798798","text":"The Baltic Defense (also known as the Grau Defense, or the Sahovic Defense) is a chess opening characterized by the moves: :1. d4 d5 :2. c4 Bf5!?

Wesley Mission Wesley Mission operates out of over 200 centres and employs over 2000 staff with a budget of $160 million. Methodists began doing welfare work in Sydney in 1812. This work became Sydney's Central Methodist Mission in 1884. In 1946 it opened a psychiatric care facility, now known as Wesley Hospital Ashfield. It later opened another mental health hospital in Korgarah. In 1963, while led by Reverend Dr Sir Alan Walker, it established Lifeline, now Australia's largest national phone support service and operating in 19 countries. In 1977, it became known as Wesley Central Mission when it became part of the Uniting Church at its founding.

Early life DuBois was born in New Jersey, moving at age 11 to London, England, where he attended the American School in London, before moving to New York City in 1993 to attend Columbia University. DuBois holds a master's (1999) and a doctorate (2003) in music composition from Columbia (studying primarily with Fred Lerdahl and Jonathan Kramer), and worked as a staff researcher at Columbia's Computer Music Center until 2008.  Academic career  DuBois has taught interactive music and video performance at a number of institutions, including Columbia, Princeton University, the School of Visual Arts, and the Music Technology and interactive telecommunications programs at New York University. In 2008 he began teaching as a full-time professor at the NYU Tandon School of Engineering, where he currently serves as co-director of the Integrated Digital Media program and director of the Brooklyn Experimental Media Center; his academic position consists of a triple appointment between the Engineering School, Music Technology, and ITP. As a graduate student at Columbia he was a contributor to Real-Time Cmix. Since 2000 he has worked for Cycling '74 on Max/MSP/Jitter.  Collaborations  DuBois has collaborated with a wide range of artists and musicians, including Elliott Sharp, Paul D. Miller, Todd Reynolds, Toni Dove, Chris Mann, Michael Joaquin Grey, Matthew Ritchie, Eric Singer, Bora Yoon, and Leroy Jenkins. He was a founding member of the Freight Elevator Quartet, and has produced records for Bang on a Can composer Michael Gordon on the Nonesuch label. His music integrates real-time performer-computer interaction with algorithmic methodologies repurposed from other fields, most notably formal grammars such as L-systems. His research into issues of musical time revolves around a technique called time-lapse phonography, as used in his piece Billboard. His instrumental writing, like his artwork, is often based on techniques derived from stochastic music and data mining, using metaphors and information from cultural topics as source material in a postmodern style, as in the string quartet Hard Data, a six- movement sonification that, while its musical structure is based on the casualty stream of the Iraq War, borrows heavily from the instrumental writing of Stravinsky, Messiaen, Xenakis, and Crumb.  Conceptual artist  As a conceptual artist, DuBois takes on various topics in American culture and places them under a computational microscope to raise issues relevant to information theory, perception of time, canonicity, and gaze. For example, his trio of pieces on gestalt media, Academy, Billboard, and Play, look at three iconic cultural \\"canons\\" in American popular culture (the Academy Awards, the Billboard Hot 100, and Playboy magazine's Playmate of the Month). His piece Hindsight is Always 20/20, based on a statistical analysis of presidential State of the Union addresses, uses computational means as a lens into the politics of political rhetoric. Fashionably Late for the Relationship, his feature-length collaboration with performance artist Li√°n Amaris, uses the radical time-compression of a 72-hour film of a performance to deconstruct romantic obsession. For his large-scale artwork A More Perfect Union, DuBois joined 21 different online dating sites and constructed a census of the United States based on an analysis of the profiles of 19 million single Americans; shown as a series of colored and relabeled maps, the work investigates the lexicon of American self-identity in the 21st century.  Art and exhibitions  His work is represented by bitforms gallery in New York City, and has been exhibited worldwide, including at the 2007 Sundance Film Festival and the 2008 Democratic National Convention. In January 2014 R. Luke DuBois‚ÄîNow opened at the Ringling Museum of Art. This first solo museum exhibition, organized by curator Matthew McLendon, surveyed DuBois's output over the previous decade, and included performance, video, public installation, and generative works. The exhibition went on to the Orange County Museum of Art the following year and the Bowdoin College Museum of Art in 2016. In December 2016 Hyperallergic named R. Luke DuBois‚ÄîNow one of the top 15 exhibitions in the United States. Before becoming a well-known Laptop musician, DuBois did most of his improvisation and performance on Buchla and Serge modular synthesizers.  Awards and recognition  In 2013 DuBois was awarded an honorary Doctor of Humane Letters by Goucher College. He was named the inaugural artist for the Times Square Residency at the CrossRoads Program in 2015 and was a speaker for TED 2016. In 2018 the Cooper Hewitt, Smithsonian Design Museum commissioned DuBois and Zach Lieberman to represent the United States in the London Design Biennale.

Examples were the 1000, 2500 and 3000 series of LattisHub network hubs. LattisNet was the first implementation of 10 Megabits per second local area networking over unshielded twisted pair wiring in a star topology. Ethernet variants During the early 1980s most networks used coaxial cable as the primary form of premises cabling in Ethernet implementations. In 1985 SynOptics shipped its first hub for fiber optics and shielded twisted pair. SynOptics' co-founder, Engineer Ronald V. Schmidt, had experimented with a fiber-optic variant of Ethernet called Fibernet II while working at Xerox PARC, where Ethernet had been invented. In January 1987 SynOptics announced intentions to manufacture equipment supporting 10 megabits/sec data transfer rates over unshielded twisted pair, telephone wire. In August 1987 New York based LAN Systems, Inc. completed the equipment testing and praised SynOptics for successfully deploying a 10Mbit/s network that supported workstations up to 330 feet from the wiring closet, because of their careful control of EMI and RFI. Novell reported that the LattisNet equipment performed better than RG-58U coaxial cable. This same year HP proposed a study group be formed to look into standardizing Ethernet on telephone wires. SynOptics' investor, Menlo Ventures explained its position on joining the IEEE for standardization. In 1990 the IEEE issued an Ethernet over twisted pair standard known for transmitting 10 Mbit/s, or 10BASE-T (802.3i). Ethernet compatibility Of the SynOptics hubs, the 2500 series was only compatible with LattisNet twisted-pair Ethernet; the 1000 and 3000 series featured modules for LattisNet and standard 10BASE-T. In the 1000 series, the 505 modules are LattisNet and the 508 modules are 10BASE-T.

Brown is best known as the host of the television music show Club MTV which ran from 1987 until 1992. Life and career Brown's father was Jamaican and her mother British. Brown has two brothers and three sisters. Her father was in the Royal Air Force, and she grew up on air force bases all around the world, including Singapore and Cyprus, before returning to the United Kingdom, where they settled in Bridgend, Wales. After winning the UK Disco Dancing Championships, she went on to win the World Disco Dancing Championship in 1979. Soon after, Brown began a career on British television as presenter and guest on a number of children's programmes, including the long-running show Crackerjack. Brown also appeared as a dancer on Top of the Pops in the early 1980s as a member of the dance troupe Zoo. Brown became a presenter on the pan-European music channel Music Box and, after moving to the United States, eventually became an MTV VJ and went on to host the Club MTV show in the late 1980s. That show had a format similar to American Bandstand's but featured an exclusive lineup of dance music. From this came her catchphrase, \\"Wubba Wubba Wubba\\", after she accidentally read the T-shirt of a camera crewmember who was holding the cue cards while on live TV. MTV capitalized on the confusion between Downtown Julie Brown and comic actress Julie Brown by sending the pair together as correspondents for MTV News as well as by their \\"facing\\" each other on both their shows (Club MTV and Just Say Julie). Later career After leaving MTV, Brown went on to work for ESPN conducting on- and off-field interviews with football athletes. Brown then moved to Los Angeles to host the E Entertainment channel's gossip show. She also became the host of the syndicated radio program American Dance Traxx in March 1992 until its final broadcast in December 1993. Brown has appeared in a number of movies and TV shows, including Spy Hard; Spring Break '83; The Weird Al Show; B*A*P*S; Ride; Walker, Texas Ranger; Battle Dome; Hey Arnold!; I'm a Celebrity, Get Me Out of Here!; The Dog Whisperer; The Eric Andre Show; and RuPaul's Drag U. Most recently, she appeared in television's Wife Swap on 21 July 2013. She also appeared on the cover and posed nude for the August 1998 edition of Playboy. Brown is currently a host on the SiriusXM channel '90s on 9. In addition to hosting programmes, she also hosts \\"The Back in The Day Replay Countdown,\\" on which are played the 30 biggest songs of the week from a particular year in the 1990s.

In 1824, the Tonkawa entered into a treaty with Stephen F. Austin to protect Anglo-American immigrants against the Comanche. At the time, Austin was an agent recruiting immigrants to settle in the Mexican state of Coahuila y Texas. In 1840 at the Battle of Plum Creek and again in 1858 at the Battle of Little Robe Creek, the Tonkawa fought alongside the Texas Rangers against the Comanche.

BAB 93 junction near Rosenheim The A 8 is a significant East-West transit route. Its construction began in March 1934 during Nazi rule as a Reichsautobahn, the section between Karlsruhe and Salzburg having been completed by the time road works were discontinued in World War II. Although most parts have been modernized and extended since, significant sections remain in their original configuration from the 1930s - 2+2 lanes, no emergency lanes, steep hills and tight curves. In combination with today's traffic this makes the A 8 one of the most crowded and dangerous autobahns in Germany. Especially in winter the slopes of the Black Forest, the Swabian Alb near Aichelberg, as well as the Irschenberg become bottlenecks when heavy trucks traverse the A8 uphill. As of 2016, the following sections have three lanes in each direction of travel: Karlsruhe - Pforzheim-North, Pforzheim- South - Stuttgart - M√ºhlhausen, AK Ulm/Elchingen - Augsburg - Munich- Eschenried, and AK Munich-South - AD Inntal. Other sections in Saarland, Rhineland-Palatinate and Munich have two lanes in each direction of travel and follow current Autobahn standards. As of 2016, the following sections have sections which are either incomplete or do not comply with modern Autobahn standards: near Merzig (under construction), AK Neunkirchen - Zweibr√ºcken (no emergency lanes yet), Enz crossing near Pforzheim (modernizing planned), Alb crossing M√ºhlhausen - Hohenstadt (planned), Hohenstadt - Ulm-West (under construction), Ulm-West - AK Ulm/Elchingen (planned) and AD Inntal - Salzburg (planned). At least, complete section Karlsruhe - Salzburg will be extended to 3 + 3 lanes.  Incomplete  Plans for the section between Pirmasens and Karlsruhe were abandoned in the 1980s. Instead of this section B10 Pirmasens - Landau was expanded. Landau - Karlsruhe was built as a part of A65 in the 90s. In Munich there is also a gap: section from Augsburg ends in Munich- Obermenzing, section from Salzburg ends in Munich-Haidhausen. Transit traffic has to use A99 north around Munich or A99 west, \\"Mittlerer Ring\\" and A 995 (shorter but not complete autobahn) Along the route Near Merzig was a section with only one lane for each direction, but it is under construction and will be extended to 2+2. Near Heusweiler a wire netting was built as a faraday cage to protect vehicle electronics from radiation of Heusweiler radio transmitter. The transmitter has been deactivated but has yet to be removed - together with the wire netting. Pirmasens-Winzeln is one of only four \\"left slip roads\\" in German autobahn network: coming from Zweibr√ºcken, left lane is exit to Winzeln and right lane stays A 8; access from Winzeln leads to left lane. Towards Zweibr√ºcken exit and access are as usual. A 8 and A 62 should meet here in an interchange. After A 8 section Pirmasens -Karlsruhe had been cancelled the \\"interchange\\" was later used for Winzeln slip road. In Gruibingen (section Stuttgart - Ulm) motorway service Gruibingen was built according to feng shui philosophy. At Drakensteiner Hang between M√ºhlhausen and Hohenstadt (section Stuttgart - Ulm) A 8 is divided into separate northbound and southbound routes on either side of the peak. Near Adelsried (section Ulm - Munich) is Autobahnkirche (\\"motorway church\\") Maria, Schutz der Reisenden (\\"Mary, patron saint of travellers\\"). It was built 1956 as first of meanwhile 42 in Germany. For extension of section Ulm/Elchingen - Augsburg - Munich a new kind of financial funding was used, an operator model: consortiums of constructing companies funded their work for themselves and in return were remitted lorry road charges for 30 years. They are also responsible for maintenance during this period. For transit traffic around Munich road marks signalize to use orbital motorway A99 north/east at Eschenried and Munich-South interchanges. But those who are familiar with place often use A 99 west - Mittlerer Ring - A 995 as a shorter and faster route. However this route leads through Munich and therefore authorities want to keep transit traffic out of town. Austria demands toll for its autobahns, so many drivers who do not want to pay for the short section border - Salzburg use slip roads Bad Reichenhall or Schwarzbach and country roads which sometimes causes traffic jams.

It is basically used to test the amount of information carried in the documents. It is based on Harter's 2-Poisson indexing-model. The 2-Poisson model has a hypothesis that the level of the documents is related to a set of documents which contains words occur relatively greater than the rest of the documents. It is not a 'model', but a framework for weighting terms using probabilistic methods, and it has a special relationship for term weighting based on notion of eliteness. Term weights are being treated as the standard of whether a specific word is in that set or not. Term weights are computed by measuring the divergence between a term distribution produced by a random process and the actual term distribution. Divergence from randomness models set up by instantiating the three main components of the framework: first selecting a basic randomness model, then applying the first normalization and at last normalizing the term frequencies. The basic models are from the following tables. Definition The divergence from randomness is based on this idea: \\"The more the divergence of the within-document term-frequency from its frequency within the collection, the more the information carried by the word t in document d. In other words, the term-weight is inversely related to the probability of term- frequency within the document d obtained by a model M of randomness.\\"(By terrier.org) \\\\text{weight}(td) =k\\\\text{Prob}_M(t\\\\in d\\\\text{Collection}) (Formula 1) # M represents the type of model of randomness which employs to calculate the probability. # d is the total number of words in the documents. # t is the number of a specific word in d. # k is defined by M. It is possible that we use different urn models to choose the appropriate model M of randomness. In Information Retrieval, we have documents instead of urns, and terms instead of colors. There are several ways to choose M, each of these has a basic divergence from randomness model to support it. Model =Basic Models= D Divergence approximation of the binomial P Approximation of the binomial BE Bose-Einstein distribution G Geometric approximation of the Bose- Einstein I(n) Inverse Document Frequency Model I(F) Inverse Term Frequency Model I(ne) Inverse Expected Document Frequency Model =DFR Models= BB2 Bernoulli-Einstein model with Bernoulli after-effect and normalization 2. IFB2 Inverse Term Frequency model with Bernoulli after-effect and normalization 2. In-expB2 Inverse Expected Document Frequency model with Bernoulli after-effect and normalization 2. The logarithms are base 2. This model can be used for classic ad-hoc tasks. In-expC2 Inverse Expected Document Frequency model with Bernoulli after-effect and normalization 2. The logarithms are base e. This model can be used for classic ad-hoc tasks. InL2 Inverse Document Frequency model with Laplace after-effect and normalization 2. This model can be used for tasks that require early precision. PL2 Poisson model with Laplace after- effect and normalization 2. This model can be used for tasks that require early precision[7,8]. First Normalization When a specific rare term cannot be found in a document, then in that document the term has approximately zero probability of being informative. On the other hand, if a rare term occurs frequently in a document, therefore it can have a very high, near 100% probability to be informative for the topic that mentioned by the document. Applying to Ponte and Croft's language model can also be a good idea. Notice that a risk component is considered in the DFR. Logically speaking, if the term-frequency in the document is relatively high, then inversely the risk for the term of not being informative is relatively small. Say we have a Formula 1 giving a high value, then a minimal risk has the negative effect of showing small information gain. So we choose to organize the weight of Formula 1 to only consider the portion of which is the amount of information gained with the term. The more the term occurs in the elite set, the less term-frequency is due to randomness, and thus the smaller the associated risk is. We basically apply two models to compute the information gain with a term within a document: the Laplace L model, the ratio of two Bernoulli's processes B. Term frequency normalization Before using the within-document frequency tf of a term, the document-length dl is normalized to a standard length sl. Therefore, the term-frequencies tf are recalculated with the respect to the standard document-length, that is: tfn = tf * log(1+ sl/dl) (normalization 1) tfn represents the normalized term frequency. Another version of the normalization formula is the following: tfn = tf * log(1 + c*(sl/dl)) (normalization 2) Normalization 2 is usually considered to be more flexible, since there is no fixed value for c. # tf is the term-frequency of the term t in the document d # dl is the document-length. # sl is the standard length. Mathematic and statistical tools =The probability space= Sampling space V Utility-Theoretic Indexing developed by Cooper and Maron is a theory of indexing based on utility theory. To reflect the value for documents that is expected by the users, index terms are assigned to documents. Also, Utility-Theoretic Indexing is related an \\"event space\\" in the statistical word. There are several basic spaces Œ© in the Information Retrieval. A really simple basic space Œ© can be the set V of terms t, which is called the vocabulary of the document collection. Due to Œ©=V is the set of all mutually exclusive events, Œ© can also be the certain event with probability: P(V)= ‚àë(t‚ààV)P(t)=1 Thus P, the probability distribution, assigns probabilities to all sets of terms for the vocabulary. Notice that the basic problem of Information Retrieval is to find an estimate for P(t). Estimates are computed on the basis of sampling and the experimental text collection furnishes the samples needed for the estimation. Now we run into the main concern which is how do we treat two arbitrary but heterogeneous pieces of texts appropriately. Paragons like a chapter in a Science Magazine and an article from a sports newspaper as the other. They can be considered as two different samples since those aiming at different population. Sampling with a document The relationship of the document with the experiments is made by the way in which the sample space is chosen. In IR, term experiment, or trial, is used here with a technical meaning rather than a common sense. For example, a document could be an experiment which means the document is a sequence of outcomes t‚ààV, or just a sample of a population. We will talk about the event of observing a number Xt =tf of occurrences of a given word t in a sequence of experiments. In order to introduce this event space, we should introduce the product of the probability spaces associated with the experiments of the sequence. We could introduce our sample space to associate a point with possible configurations of the outcomes. The one-to-one correspondence for sample space can be defined as: Œ©=Vld Where ld is the number of trials of the experiment or in this example, the length of a document. We can assume that each outcome may or may not depend on the outcomes of the previous experiments. If the experiments are designed so that an outcome is influencing the next outcomes, then the probability distribution on V is different at each trial. But, more commonly, in order to establish the simpler case when the probability space is invariant in IR, the term independence assumption is often made. Therefore, all possible configurations ofŒ©=Vld are considered equiprobable. Considering this assumption, we can consider each document a Bernoulli process. The probability spaces of the product are invariant and the probability of a given sequence is the product of the probabilities at each trial. Consequently, if p=P(t) is the prior probability that the outcome is t and the number of experiments is ld we obtain the probability of Xt=tf is equal to: P(Xt=tfp)=(ld pick tf)ptfqld-tf Which is the sum of the probability of all possible configurations having tf outcomes out of ld. P(Xt=tfp) is a probability distribution because ‚àë(t‚ààV)P(Xt=tfp)=(p+q)ld=1 # ld The length of document d. # tf The term frequency of t in document d. # Xt The number of occurrence of a specific word in one list. Multiple samplings Already considering the hypothesis of having a single sample, we need to consider that we have several samples, for example, a collection D of documents. The situation of having a collection of N documents is abstractly equivalent to the scheme of placing a certain number Tot of V colored types of balls in a collection of N cells. For each term t‚ààV a possible configuration of ball placement satisfies the equations: tf1+...+tfN=Ft And the condition F1+...+FV=Tot Where Ft is the number of balls of the same color t to be distributed in the N cells. We have thus changed the basic space. The outcome of our experiment will be the documents d in which the ball will be placed. Also, we will have a lot of possible configurations consistent with the number of colored balls. # Ft The total number of tokens of t in the collection. # Tot The total number of tokens in the collection D Distributions =Binomial distribution= =Hypergeometric Distribution= =Bose-Einstein statistics= =Fat-tailed distributions= Conclusion The divergence from Randomness Model is based on the Bernoulli model and its limiting forms, the hypergeometric distribution, Bose-Einstein statistics and its limiting forms, the compound of the binomial distribution with the beta distribution, and the fat-tailed distribution. Divergence from randomness model shows a unifying framework that has the potential constructing a lot of different effective models of IR. Applications =Applications and Characteristics= # The Divergence from randomness model can be applied in automatic indexing in Information Retrieval. These can be explained as the dissertation elitenessÔºåthe notion of an informative content of a term within a document. # The effectiveness of the models based on divergence from randomness is very high in comparison with both BM25 and language model. For short queries, the performance of the models of divergence from randomness is definitely better than the BM25 Model, which since 1994 has been used as a standard baseline for the comparison of the models. # The Divergence from randomness model can show the best performance with only a few documents comparing to other query expansion skills. # The framework of Divergence from randomness model is very general and flexible. With the query expansion provided for each component, we can apply different technologies in order to get the best performance. =Proximity= Proximity can be handled within divergence from randomness to consider the number of occurrences of a pair of query terms within a window of pre-defined size.

Examples of divergence from randomness # Let t be a term and c be a collection. Let the term occur in tfc=nL(t,c)=200 locations, and in df(t,c)=nL(t,c)=100 documents. The expected average term frequency is avgtf(t,c)=200/100=2; this is the average over the documents in which the term occurs. Let N.D(c)=1000 be the total amounts of documents. The term's occurrence is 10% in the documents: P.D(tc)=100/1000. The expected average term frequency is 200/1000=1/5, and this is the average over all documents. The term frequency is shown as Kt =0,...,6. thumb The following table show the column nD is the number of Documents that contains kt occurrence of t, shown as nD(t,c,kt). Another column nL is the number of Locations at which the term occurs follows by this equation: nL=kt*nD. The columns to the right show the observed and Poisson probabilities. P obs,elite(Kt) is the observed probability over all documents. P poisson,all,lambda(Kt) is the Poisson probability, where lambda(t,c)=nL(t,c)/N D(c)=0.20 is the Poisson parameter. The table illustrates how the observed probability is different from the Poisson probability. P poisson(1) is greater than P obs(1), whereas for kt>1.the observed probabilities are greater than the Poisson probabilities. There is more mass in the tail of the observed distribution than the Poisson distribution assumes. Moreover, the columns to the right illustrate the usage of the elite documents instead of all documents. Here, the single event probability is based on the locations of elite documents only. =Further interest of examples= # Adjusting document length. # Applying DFR in content-only XML Documents # Introduction to DFR models References *Amati, G.

Pliny says dinner parties at his home were often enlivened by scenes from Roman comedy. Pliny admired Vestricius Spurinna for his active but orderly life as a septuagenarian. He enjoyed conversation, reading and writing, exercise, and bathing. His diet was simple but good, and he enjoyed the full use of his faculties, remaining both physically and mentally vigorous.Parkin, Old Age in the Roman World, pp. 73‚Äì74.  Life  \\"The origins of Vestricius Spurinna is nowhere documented,\\" writes Ronald Syme, then a few lines later states he was \\"presumably a Transpadane\\". Syme also notes that Spurinna's gentilicum and cognomen both are Etruscan, then states the gentilicum, Vestricius, appears only one other time in the entire Italian peninsula, an inscription at Florentia.Syme, Tactius (Oxford: University Press, 1958), p. 635 Spurinna first appears in history during the Year of the Four Emperors, when Appius Annius Gallus, one of Otho's generals, put him in command of a detachment of some 3,000 men, to garrison Placentia, while Gallus occupied Verona.Gwyn Morgan, 69 A.D.: The Year of Four Emperors (Oxford: University Press, 2006), pp. 113f Spurinna commanded an unruly force, far too eager to engage their counterparts on the Vitellian side. When he tried to keep this force inside the city, the troops threatened to mutiny; as a wily move, Spurinna agreed to their demands. The next day the soldiers marched forth; when nightfall came, they were surprised to find they must construct a camp. According to standard Roman practice, this would include digging a trench and erecting a wall around the encampment. When the soldiers started having second thoughts, their officers seized the opportunity to praise \\"Spurinna's foresight in selecting Placentia as a strongpoint.\\" The men acquiesced and marched back to Placentia where they enthusiastically set to work on improving the city's fortifications.Tacitus, Histories, II.18f Spurinna's role in the following the First Battle of Bedriacum is not recorded; Syme notes Tacitus allows him \\"to fade out, perhaps mercifully: there is no sign of his whereabouts during the battle or the surrender.\\"Syme, Tactius, pp. 171f It is possible that Tacitus learned of Spurinna's handling of his unruly troops from Spurinna himself; Syme suggests as much, then in a footnote admits, \\"Not, however, that Tacitus' account need derive anywhere directly from Spurinna, although the old fellow was still alive c. 105\\"Syme, Tacitus, pp. 176f He is said to have \\"held no office under Domitian after it became dishonorable to do so,\\"Miriam Griffin, \\"Nerva to Hadrian,\\" in Cambridge Ancient History: The High Empire A.D. 70‚Äì192 (Cambridge University Press, 2000), vol. 11, p. 89. but under Nerva, Spurinna was governor of Germania Inferior in 97,Parkin, Old Age in the Roman World, p. 122. at the age of 73.

Family  The wife of Vestricius Spurinna was Cottia, who was probably considerably younger. They had at least one son, who died around 97 or 98 AD before he had begun a political career, which typically began at the age of thirty.

The route between Forstinning and Heldenstein was the subject of a decades-long debate. History In the original plans for the A 94, the section between Simbach and Passau was not planned. Instead, the A 94 was supposed to cross the Inn to the Austrian border, at which point it would continue through the Innviertel to Ried im Innkreis and connect to the Austrian A 8 towards Vienna. This path would have decreased travel time from Munich to Vienna compared to the route via Salzburg. Provisions for such a routing were built in Simbach and in Ried. However, since Austria didn't want to burden the Innviertel with traffic, the plan was given up on the Austrian side. After this, on the German side, the plans were changed so that the A 94 connected with the A 3 at Pocking/Neuhaus am Inn. This makes an eventual northern extension to the Czech border possible. At one point, a route from M√ºhldorf to Pfarrkirchen to Pocking was planned. Under this plan, today's A 94 section from M√ºhldorf to Simbach would have been given the designation A 942.

The five-valve engine \\"Cutaway of Yamaha Genesis inline- four 20-valve engine\\" The DOHC Genesis engine has five valves per cylinder and downdraft carburetors. Yamaha adopted the 5-valve concept, using three intake valves and two exhaust valves per cylinder, because it allowed both excellent volumetric efficiency and high rpm. As designers began to appreciate the benefits of multi-valve layout, 4-valves-per-cylinder (and even 3-valves) became common. In a multivalve engine, maximum rpm is limited by the size of the largest valves: in a 3-valver, the exhaust valve is larger, and in a 4-valver, the inlet valves are larger. The significance of the five-valve engine compared to other multivalve configurations engines is that (like a 3-valver) there were more intake valves than exhaust ones; yet all valves were small and of very similar sizes and weights. Downdraft carburetors were adopted for improved gas flow, but, for motorcycles, a disadvantage was that the intake airbox was above the engine, taking up space from the fuel tank, rather than being sited conventionally behind the engine. Applications The Genesis engine first appeared on the 1984 Yamaha FZ750 and was later used on a variety of motorcycles for different kinds of markets. The design was used for parallel-twins (such as the TDM and the TRX) as well as for four-cylinder models. Both fours and twins had the cylinder block slanted forwards 45 degrees. The Genesis engine was also used in the Yamaha YZF-R1, FZX700, FZ750, and the USA-only FZ700. Other applications ranged from the Supersport YZF-R6 and YZF-R1 models using electronic fuel injection with YCCT and YCCI to the less extreme but still powerful Yamaha FZ6 (4 valve per cylinder) and FZ1 Fazer line which had a simpler fuel injection designs but was essentially the same basic engine design. The most significant changes made were the 4-valve per cylinder configuration and the crossplane crankshaft found on the YZF-R1 2009, along with the change of cylinder sleeves to steel for high precision and high temperature durability. Throughout its long period of production, the Genesis range has successfully provided performance and reliability. Because of its high performance capacity (usually from 100 BHP - 350 BHP), the engine has also been employed in various other uses such as gyroplanes and high power marine engines, making it an affordable solution for a high performance applications. The engine is also used in a racecar championship in Norway called SevenRacing. It is a copy of Lotus Super Seven, and is produced by MK and Stuart Taylor.

In order to avoid deportation of Danes to German concentration camps, Danish authorities suggested, in January 1944, that an internment camp be created in Denmark. The German occupation authorities consented, and the camp was erected near the village of Fr√∏slev in the south-west of Denmark, close to the German border. From mid-August until the end of the German occupation in May 1945, 12,000 prisoners passed through the camp's gates. Most of them were suspected members of the Danish resistance movement, Communists and other political prisoners. Living conditions in the camp were generally tolerable, but 1,600 internees were deported to German concentration camps, where 220 of them died (approximate numbers). Towards the end of the war, the Swedish count Folke Bernadotte tried to get all Scandinavian concentration camp prisoners to Sweden. Simultaneously the Danish administration negotiated with the Germans about rescue of the Danish prisoners in Germany. As a result of these efforts many Scandinavian prisoners came with the White Buses from the German camps. In March and April 1945, 10,000 Danish and Norwegian captives were brought home from Germany. Some of the returning prisoners came to Fr√∏slev Prison Camp. Among those were some of the 1,960 deported Danish policemen, which had been arrested and deported on 19 September 1944. After the war When the German occupation ended, the prisoners were released, only to be immediately replaced with suspected Nazi collaborators, and the camp's name was changed to F√•rhus Camp (F√•rhuslejren). The internment camp was now run by the Danish resistance movement, and among those interned was Frits Clausen, former leader of the Danish Nazi party. Later on, the Danish state took over from the resistance movement, using the camp as the country's largest correctional facility for convicted collaborators. Fence and guard tower By 1949 most collaborators had served their sentences, and the camp was converted to army barracks under the name of Padborg Camp (Padborglejren). The Fr√∏slev Prison Camp Museum (Fr√∏slevlejrens Museum) was inaugurated in 1969. According to a 2001 agreement, the camp will be preserved as a national memorial park. Some parts of the original 1944-45 prison camp, which had been demolished, have now been reconstructed, including a watchtower and a portion of the barbed-wire fence.

In 1875, he founded what became the Toshiba Corporation. He has been called the \\"Thomas Edison of Japan\\" or \\"Karakuri Giemon.\\"http://www.pinktentacle.com/2006/01/edo-period-robot-returns-to-life- in-japan/ Biography Tanaka was born in Kurume, Chikugo province (present- day Fukuoka prefecture) as the eldest son of a tortoise shell craftsman. Apprenticed at an early age, he was a gifted artisan. At the age of eight, he invented an inkstone case with a secret lock, which required a cord to be twisted in a certain manner to open it. At the age of 14, he had invented a loom capable of weaving intricate designs into fabric. From age 20 he began to make karakuri dolls, autonomous dolls powered by springs, pneumatics and hydraulics, capable of relatively complex movements, which were much in demand by the aristocrats of Kyoto, daimy≈ç in feudal domains, and by the Sh≈çgun's court in Edo. At age 21, he was performing around the country at festivals with clockwork dolls he constructed himself. He declined to take over the family business, surrendering his position to his younger brother and devoted his full attention to karakuri dolls. However, by his mid-thirties, these mechanical dolls had started to fall out of fashion. In 1834, he relocated to Osaka, where he experimented in pneumatics, hydraulics and forms of lighting based on rapeseed oil, including a pocket candlestick and an oil lamp with an air-pressurized fuel pump which proved to be very popular. He then moved on to Kyoto, where he studied rangaku, or western learning, and astronomy. He invented a pneumatic fire pump, and in 1851, he built a myriad year clock which is now designated as an Important Cultural Property by the Japanese government. With the development of the Sonn≈ç j≈çi movement, the atmosphere in Kyoto became increasingly dangerous towards foreign influences and technology, and Tanaka was invited by Sano Tsunetami to Saga Domain in Ky≈´sh≈´, where he was welcomed by Nabeshima Naomasa. While in Saga, Tanaka designed and built Japan's first domestically made steam locomotive and steam warship. Although he had no previous experience in the field, he had access to a Dutch reference book and had watched the demonstration of a steam engine by the Russian diplomat Yevfimy Putyatin during his visit to Nagasaki in 1853. He later was a student at the Nagasaki Naval Training Center. On its closure and the withdrawal of its Dutch advisors, Tanaka moved back to Saga and worked at the Seirenkata, where he built models of steam warships (both with screws and with side-paddles), a steam locomotive and experimented with making a telegraph and a glass factory. He was involved in the construction of a reverberatory furnace in Saga for the production of Armstrong guns. In 1864, he returned to his native Kurume Domain, where he assisted in the development of modern weaponry. In 1873, six years after the Meiji Restoration, Tanaka, then age 74 and still energetic, was invited by the Ministry of Industry to come to Tokyo to make telegraphs at the ministry's small factory. He relocated to the Ginza district in 1875. He rented the second floor of a temple in what is now Roppongi as a workshop that evolved into his first company‚ÄîTanaka Seisakusho (Tanaka Engineering Works), the first manufacturer of telegraph equipment in Japan. After his death in 1881, his son founded . The company changed its name after Tanaka's death to in 1904. After a merger in 1939 with Tokyo Denki it became Tokyo Shibaura Denki, more commonly known today as Toshiba. References *Morris-Suzuki, Tessa.

An add-drop multiplexer (ADM) is an important element of an optical fiber network. A multiplexer combines, or multiplexes, several lower-bandwidth streams of data into a single beam of light. An add-drop multiplexer also has the capability to add one or more lower-bandwidth signals to an existing high-bandwidth data stream, and at the same time can extract or drop other low-bandwidth signals, removing them from the stream and redirecting them to some other network path. This is used as a local \\"on-ramp\\" and \\"off-ramp\\" to the high-speed network. ADMs can be used both in long-haul core networks and in shorter-distance \\"metro\\" networks, although the former are much more expensive due to the difficulty of scaling the technology to the high data rates and dense wavelength division multiplexing (DWDM) used for long-haul communications.

It is located at an altitude of 622 m. Historically known as Kesh or Kish, Shahrisabz was once a major city of Central Asia and was an important urban center of Sogdiana, a province of the Achaemenid Empire of Persia. It is primarily known today as the birthplace of 14th-century Turco-Mongol conqueror Timur.  History  suzani, first half of 19th century.

Formerly known as Kesh or Kish (\\"heart- pleasing\\") and tentatively identified with the ancient Nautaca, Shahrisabz is one of Central Asia‚Äôs most ancient cities. It was founded more than 2,700 years ago and formed a part of the Achaemenid Empire or Persia from the 6th to 4th centuries BC. Throughout this period Kesh remained an important urban center of Sogdiana, a major province within the Empire. Documents from the late Achaemenid period speak of the renovation of the city's walls.Pavel Lurje, (2009), 'KE≈†' Encyclopaedia Iranica (online) Its name was officially changed to Shahrisabz in the modern era. Alexander the Great's general Ptolemy captured the satrap of Bactria and pretender to the Persian throne, Bessus, at Nautaca thus ending the once great Achaemenid Empire. Alexander the Great chose to spend his winters and met his wife Roxanna in the area in 328-327 BC. Between 567 and 658 CE rulers of Kesh paid taxes to khagans of Turkic and Western Turkic khaganates. In 710 the city was conquered by the Arabs and following the Mongol conquest of Khwarezmia in the 13th century, the region came under the control of the Barlas tribe, all of whose lineages seem to have been associated with this region.B.F. Manz, The rise and rule of Tamerlan, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge 1989, p. 156‚Äì7 Kesh was the birthplace of Timur in 1336, to the family of a minor local Barlas chief, and during the early years of the Timurid Dynasty, the city enjoyed his considerable patronage. Timur regarded Kesh as his ‚Äúhome town‚Äù and planned it eventually to be the location of his tomb. However, during his reign, the center of activity shifted to Samarkand instead. According to legend, the Khan of Bukhara, Abdullah Khan II had the city destroyed in a fit of rage over the death of his favorite horse from exhaustion on a steep approach to the city, but was later overcome with remorse for the damage he had done. The city struggled for autonomy under Bukharan rule and the Russians helped the Bukharan emir conquering the city in 1870.  Historical sites  upright Several remaining impressive monuments from the Timurid Dynasty have enabled the old part of the city to be inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List. However, destruction of vast areas of the medieval townscape in 2015 to create a park and tourist facilities have led to concern from UNESCO. It is possible that the listing could be lost. * Ak-Saray Palace Timur's Summer Palace, the ‚ÄúWhite Palace‚Äù was planned as the most grandiose of all Timur's constructions. It was started in 1380 by artisans deported by Timur from the recently conquered Khwarezm. Unfortunately, only parts of its gigantic 65 m gate-towers survive, with blue, white and gold mosaics.

However, the conqueror was buried in Samarkand, not at Shahrisabz, and mysteriously, his tomb in Shahrisabz contained two unidentified corpses.

In the 1870 census the Whakat≈çhea iwi of the Bay of Plenty had five named hap≈´ ranging in size from 51 to 165 people. Some of their hap≈´ were apparently overlooked as an iwi register from 1874 showed two more hap≈´ but these had small numbers: 22 and 44. The hap≈´ of this iwi ranged in size from 22 to 188. In 1874, hap≈´ still had a small male to female imbalance overall with six of the seven iwi having far more males than females. In the four-year period between the census and the register all the hap≈´ had grown significantly at a time when popular opinion was Maori population was in decline. NgƒÅti Rua gained 8, NgƒÅti Patu gained 28, NgƒÅti Tama gained 63, NgƒÅti Ira lost 4, NgƒÅti Ngahere gained 17.Opotiki-Mai-Tawhiti.p 142-143. Ranginui Walker. Penguin. North Shore. 2007. These population gains were at a time when the iwi had land confiscated by the government for their support of various anti-government movements. Some hap≈´ in other iwi were larger. A MƒÅori person can belong to or have links to many different hap≈´.  Pre-history and history  Before the arrival of Europeans in New Zealand the normal day-to- day operating group in MƒÅori society seems to have been the smaller whƒÅnau. By the 1820s MƒÅori had learnt the economic benefit of working in larger groups - especially when it came to trading with ships. The larger hap≈´ could work more effectively to produce surplus flax, potatoes, smoked heads and pigs in exchange for blankets, tobacco, axes and trade muskets. In warfare the hap≈´ operated as the standard grouping for warriors during the period of the Musket Wars (1807-1842). Hap≈´ would unite politically under their own chief, to form much larger armies of up to several thousand warriors, although it was common for hap≈´ to retain independence within the larger group. Each hap≈´ had its own chief and normally operated independently of the tribe (iwi) group. Te Maire Tau noted in his study of NgƒÅi Tahu migrations that hap≈´ size and names were volatile, with hap≈´ splitting into sister groups when they grew in size or when migrating. New hap≈´ often adopted names from events associated with the migration. Likewise the same group of people would change their name according to different circumstances. Name changes primarily asserted rights to resources given to a named hap≈´, or emphasised a link to an ancestor with mana in a particular area. Tau states that hap≈´ names and locations have become more stable in more recent times. NgƒÅi Tahu, A Migration History. Editors Te Maire Tau and Atholl Anderson. Bridget Williams. Wellington 2008, pp. 20‚Äì23 Missionaries such Henry Williams (1792-1867) noted that even in times of war against another iwi, hap≈´ usually operated independently. In the period of the Musket Wars (1807-1842) many of the battles involved fighting between competing hap≈´ rather than different iwi. It was not uncommon for two hap≈´ from the same iwi to clash. Hap≈´ frequently were the political unit that sold land to the Europeans. In the 20 years after the signing of the Treaty of Waitangi in 1840, according to Native Affairs Minister Chris Richmond, different hap≈´ or comparatively small groups of individuals sold half of all the blocks sold under the Treaty of Waitangi. Richmond said that hap≈´ or small groups sold all the land sold north of Auckland, some in Hawke's Bay, in the Wairarapa valley, in the Waikato at Raglan, and sales by Te ƒÄti Awa in Wellington and Taranaki.

Mishima did much research to prepare for this novel, including visiting locations recorded in the book and searching for information on the Shinp≈´ren Rebellion (Á•ûÈ¢®ÈÄ£„ÅÆ‰π± Shinp≈´ren no Ran).The Yukio Mishima Cyber Museum. Village Yamanaka. Accessed May 22, 2008. Japanese critics initially reviewed Runaway Horses negatively. Plot Set between June 1932 and December 1933, it tells the story of young Isao Iinuma, a rightist reactionary trained in the samurai code by his father. Isao becomes the instigator of a plot to topple the zaibatsu that he feels have corrupted the Yamato-damashii and betrayed the will of the Emperor. He is assured of the army's assistance by the young Lieutenant Hori. They plan to assassinate many key government figures simultaneously on December 3, 1932. Shigekuni Honda, a character who figured prominently in Spring Snow, the first novel of the cycle, appears again here as a judge and later lawyer. He comes to believe that Isao is the reincarnation of Kiyoaki Matsugae, the aristocratic schoolfriend whose story was told in Spring Snow. Realising that Isao too seems to be hurtling towards a \\"picturesque\\" death, he makes strenuous efforts to save him without revealing this personal connection. =Honda and Isao (ch. 1-8)= It is just after the May 15 Incident of 1932. Shigekuni Honda, the law student from Spring Snow, is now a junior associate judge at the Osaka Court of Appeals. He is asked by Judge Sugawa to give an address at a kendo tournament on June 16 at the ≈åmiwa Shrine in Sakurai, Nara Prefecture. At the tournament, the chief priest points out to him a promising athlete called Isao Iinuma. Honda realises that this is the son of Shigeyuki Iinuma, Kiyoaki's old tutor, now a right-wing \\"personality\\". After lunch, Honda climbs the sugi-clad Mount Miwa, and afterwards descends to Sanko Falls to bathe. Some of the kendoists are already there. Honda is startled to see that Isao has the same three moles on his side that Kiyoaki had, and remembers Kiyoaki's dying words: \\"I'll see you again. I know it. Beneath the falls.\\" The next day, at the Saigusa Festival at Izagawa Shrine in Nara, Honda is introduced to Mr. Iinuma. He now runs an \\"Academy of Patriotism\\" and is slowly going to seed, morbidly talkative, his face \\"marked by the years and by the common tribulations.\\" Honda invites him and his son to dinner that evening. Iinuma accepts, and responds by introducing Honda to the poet, retired Lt.-Gen. Kito, and his 30-year-old divorced daughter Makiko. Iinuma and his son leave for Tokyo after the dinner. Just before they go, Isao lends Honda a copy of his favourite book, The League of the Divine Wind by Tsunanori Yamao, and urges him to read it. =The League of the Divine Wind= Part 1: The Rite of Ukei \\"At the time of the... Imperial Restoration, the indications had been altogether favourable that the august wish of His Late Majesty Komei to expel the barbarians would be fulfilled. But clouds soon cut off the light of Heaven... swords were forbidden to the common people... it was decreed that samurai could cut off their topknot and that they might go without swords.\\" In 1873, four samurai worship at Shingai Shrine in Kumamoto Prefecture, and then await the results of a divination performed by the priest Otaguro, the heir of the late, revered Oen Hayashi, whose 200 followers will come to be known as \\"the League of the Divine Wind\\". The proposals they have put to the gods are: \\"To bring an end to misgovernment by admonishing authority even to the forfeiture of life\\" and \\"to cut down the unworthy ministers by striking in darkness with the sword\\". Both return the response \\"Not propitious.\\" In 1874, the proposal Otaguro puts is to take advantage of the vulnerability induced by the Saga Rebellion. Again, the Ukei rite returns \\"Not propitious.\\" On 18 March 1876, the wearing of swords is prohibited. Harukata Kaya resigns as priest of Kinzan Shrine and presents a petition to the prefectural governor. In May, the rite of Ukei is performed by Otaguro, this time returning \\"Propitious.\\" The others wish Kaya to join them in rebellion, but he is reluctant. A further rite convinces Kaya that it is his duty. Part 2: The Combat of the Ukei On arriving at Kumamoto Castle on the night of 24 October 1876, the 200 warriors split into three units. The first attacks the residences of the major officials; Governor Yasuoka is killed. The second attacks the artillery battalion, with great success; the third attacks the infantry encampment, breaking down barrack doors and throwing in grenades. The tide turns when ammunition is found for the garrisoned troops, and when the second unit rushes to the aid of the third, it is entrapped, and both Kaya and Otaguro die. Part 3: One with the gods The next morning, on the 9th day of the 9th month (lunar calendar), 46 survivors gather on Mount Kinpo, less than four miles (6 km) west of Kumamoto Castle. The six boats intended for escape are stuck in tidal mud and it is debated what they should do. The seven youngest rebels are sent away with Tsuruda, and the rest descend to Chikozu beach. A scouting party returns with the report that a crackdown is underway and no further military action can be taken. Accordingly, the survivors split up. One by one they surrender or commit seppuku, and a detailed accounting is given of each man's end. The pamphlet concludes with a quotation from The Romance of the Divine Fire, a book written by a surviving rebel. Honda's letter to Isao (ch. 10) Honda sends the book back with a letter that Isao reads when he arrives at school. In it, Honda expresses a new respect for the League, and for the forces of the irrational in general (influenced by his new belief in reincarnation, although that is a secret) and discusses the dead Kiyoaki and his passion for Satoko. However, he warns Isao that the tale of the League is \\"unsuitable\\" for him, and dangerous, and lectures him at length on the need for \\"the comprehensive picture offered by history.\\" Isao concludes that Honda's \\"age and profession have turned him into a coward\\", but that the judge is still in some sense \\"a man of 'purity'.\\" =Isao's circle (ch. 11-14)= After school, Isao and two schoolfriends (Izutsu and Sagara) go to the boarding-house of a right-wing army officer, Lieutenant Hori. (It is Kitazaki's--the same inn that appeared in Spring Snow.) Isao boldly announces his intention of organising a \\"Showa League\\" and voices extreme sentiments for which Hori expresses sympathy, although the lieutenant become tense when Isao asks direct questions about Hori's connections to men involved in the May 15 Incident. The three boys stay until 9pm, listening to him discuss current affairs. Isao lends him The League of the Divine Wind. On Sunday morning in July, Isao conducts a kendo practice for young boys in the drill hall of the neighbourhood police station. While a detective called Tsuboi talks to him, four Communists are brought to the prison, and Isao feels a stab of envy. Iinuma runs an \\"Academy of Patriotism\\" in a wing of his large house in Hong≈ç. We learn about what happened to Iinuma and Min√© between 1914 and 1932, and meet the 40-year-old student named Sawa. After Master Kaido's Sunday lecture, Isao shows his two schoolfriends a map of Tokyo, suggesting an air-raid on the areas he has coloured in purple. Later on they have dinner with Makiko at her house, and the four discuss who in Japan most deserves assassination. Isao names Kurahara. Makiko has kept the lilies Isao brought from Izagawa Shrine a month ago, and hands them one each. Isao visits Hori at the garrison. Hori expresses irritation with Isao's hot-headed talk. During kendo practice, he is impressed with Isao's abilities, and proposes taking him to an audience with Prince Harunori Toin, the military royal for whom Satoko had been intended. =The Capitalists (ch. 15-19)= Baron Shinkawa gives a banquet at his villa in Karuizawa. Five couples sit and chat in his garden before dinner: the Matsugaes, the Shinkawas, the Kuraharas, the Matsudairas, and the Minister of State and his wife. They discuss current affairs in great detail, with prominence given to the personality and monetaristic opinions of Kurahara. We discover the fate of members of the Matsugae household. The Marquis Matsugae himself is humiliated by his insignificance, even by the fact he has no bodyguard. Isao has an audience with Prince Toin, against Iinuma's wishes. Hori and the Prince chat for a while; when the Prince criticises the nobility, Isao uses the opportunity to give him The League and to express his ideas about bushido. By this time, Isao has gathered 20 more boys into his circle, and Izutsu and Sagara have studied explosives. Two weeks before the end of summer vacation, he sends all the boys a telegram ordering them to return to Tokyo for a meeting at the school shrine at 6pm. All turn up and are stunned when Isao tells them it was only a drill; three leave. Isao then has the remaining boys swear vows of fealty. To Isao's surprise, Makiko turns up, and takes them all to dinner at a restaurant in Shibuya. Chapter 19 gives a description of the opening of a Noh play attended by Honda in Osaka, called Matsukaze. While watching the two ghostly women ladle seawater into their brine-cart, Honda suddenly decides that his grief for Kiyoaki has deceived him and that there could be no real connection between Kiyoaki and Isao. =Isao's plot (ch. 20-30)= While hanging out his washing in October (on a certain Mr Koyama's 77th birthday), Sawa asks Isao if he can go with him and his \\"study group\\" to Master Kaido's training camp in the week starting on the 20 October. Isao makes no reply. Sawa, while serving him tea in his own room, starts to describe how three years ago Iinuma helped extort 50,000 yen from a newspaper and used his 10,000 yen share to bolster the Academy. Isao is disappointed, but not shocked until Sawa warns him, without explanation, that he cannot hurt Kurahara without betraying his father. Wondering if Kurahara is a secret patron of the Academy, Isao later returns to Sawa's room and demands an explanation. Sawa responds by begging to be allowed to kill Kurahara himself. But after hearing him out, Isao smilingly denies there is any plot. Honda hears an account of the coup d'√©tat that took place in Siam on 24 June, during which the country became a constitutional monarchy controlled by Col. Phahon Phonphayuhasena. On Friday 21 October, Honda attends a judicial conference in Tokyo, and on Sunday goes with Iinuma to see Isao at the riverside training camp at Yanagawa. Isao is in trouble: he has taken offence at the bland Shintoism espoused by Master Kaido and gone out to kill an animal after having been ritually purified. When he accompanies the whole group as they look for Isao, Honda is startled to realise that one of the dreams in Kiyoaki's journal is now being acted out in detail. Isao holds a secret meeting on Monday evening and shows the other boys his elaborate plan for a \\"Sh≈çwa Restoration\\" placing all government functions under the Emperor's control, through (1) destroying Tokyo's six electric transformer substations, (2) assassinating Shinkawa, Nagasaki and Kurahara, and (3) burning the Bank of Japan, events that would lead to the desired declaration of martial law, after which they would all commit seppuku. The plan mentions Hori and Prince Toin. They discuss details of the plot; Isao names December 3 at random as the date, and they receive an unexpected windfall of 1000 yen from Sawa, who claims he acquired the money by selling land. Honda visits Kiyoaki's grave before returning to Osaka. On November 7, Lieutenant Hori summons Isao and tells him he is being sent to Manchuria on November 15. When Hori suggests moving the date of the plot to this week, Isao realises that he has no intention of taking part. Hori suddenly urges Isao to give up the plot, and Isao pretends to be persuaded. At the group's secret headquarters (a rented house in Yotsuya Sumon) Isao tries to salvage the plan. Seyama, Tsujimura and Ui argue with Isao in private, and he dismisses them from the group. Within days, only 10 are left with Isao, and on November 12 they are joined by Sawa, who sets out a plan for the 12 of them to assassinate one capitalist each. Sawa is assigned Kurahara, and Isao is assigned Baron Shinkawa. Isao visits the Kitos one last time on November 29 to deliver a present of oysters, but Makiko follows him, guessing that he has resolved to die, and they kiss on a hill opposite Hakusan Park. Makiko promises to go to ≈åmiwa Shrine at Sakurai and bring them each back a talisman the day before they go ahead. Isao does not admit they already each have one of her lily petals. The morning of December 1, the boy conspirators are at their hideout, discussing the daggers they have bought, when they are arrested by detectives. In the afternoon Sawa is arrested at the Academy. =Discovery and trial (ch. 31-37)= On reading about Isao in the newspaper, Honda resolves to save him, and resigns his judgeship to act as defence lawyer for Isao. In Tokyo, Iinuma thanks him, and then claims that it was he himself who informed the police, and that he did it to save his son from death. Prince Toin summons Honda to his house on December 30. The prince expresses sympathy for the twelve, but is horrified when Honda informs him that he was mentioned by name in the propaganda leaflets they prepared, and loses interest in helping them. Honda saves the situation by persuading him to lean on the Imperial Household Minister to have that part of the evidence suppressed. Isao is moved to Ichigaya Prison in late January, and a long prophetic dream is described. He learns that Honda will be defending him, and realises that he has awakened popular sympathy. During an interrogation he hears Communists being tortured, and asks why he is not tortured; the interrogator replies that as a rightist he has his heart in the right place. In June he receives a Saigusa Festival lily from Makiko, which she has gone all the way to Nara to pick. The trial opens on June 25. The evidence of the leaflets has been suppressed, and it becomes clear that Lt. Hori is unlikely to be indicted. At the second session on July 19, Isao boldly admits to planning the assassinations. Honda tries to fudge the issue by bringing up the purchase of the daggers and leading the witness Izutsu to admit that, as imitators of the League of Divine Wind, these weapons would be more appropriate for committing seppuku than for murder. The innkeeper Kitazaki is called as witness, and he says he heard Hori telling a lone visitor to \\"Give it up!\\" although he did not know to whom Hori was speaking. Pressed to identify the person, Kitazaki points to Isao, but his strange words seem to suggest he is confusing Isao with Kiyoaki, although they had no physical resemblance. Most assume he is senile. Only Honda realizes the significance of his confusion of Kiyoaki and Isao. Makiko is called as witness, and while reading a mendacious diary entry for November 29, she manages to cleverly insinuate that Isao was not only planning to abandon the conspiracy, but that he was merely a schoolboy in over his head, boasting and play-acting all along. The manipulative older woman hopes that her young lover will surrender his ideals and save himself by lying, since he cannot contradict her in court without exposing her to a charge of perjury. Thinking fast, Isao sidesteps dishonor by claiming that he did indeed talk of giving up the conspiracy, but only to spare her from any consequences of his actions. The judge, who becomes sympathetic, allows him to enlarge on his motives, and he delivers a long address on the suffering of the common people and the need to destroy the deadly spirit poisoning Japan. The prosecutor expresses doubts about Makiko's testimony, but it is clear he senses defeat. =Denouement (ch. 38-40)= The verdict is handed down on December 26. They are found guilty, but punishment is remitted on account of their youth and pure motives, and they are released. That evening, a celebratory dinner is held at the Academy of Patriotism. Tsumura, the youngest student, is irritated by the jolly atmosphere and shows Isao a newspaper account of desecratory blunders made by Kurahara on December 16 at the Inner Ise Shrine. Iinuma, drunk, tells Isao that he was the informant. Isao is not surprised until Iinuma goes on to say that the Academy is run entirely with money paid by Baron Shinkawa as protection, and that Shinkawa made him promise, just before the May 15 Incident, never to allow Kurahara to be touched. Later, Honda hears the sleeping Isao mutter \\"Far to the south. Very hot...in the rose sunshine of a southern land,\\" predicting his next reincarnation. In the morning he meets Tsuboi, who asks him to teach kendo to children, and he has a vision of himself doing so till old age. Sawa takes Isao into his room and lets him know that it was Makiko (whom Isao has not seen since the trial) who told Iinuma of their plan by telephone. This is the final straw for Isao. On 29 December, Isao slips away from Sawa during a lantern procession, buys a dagger, and travels to Inamura, a seaside village near Atami, Shizuoka. He breaks into Kurahara's weekend house, stabs him to death because of his blasphemy at Ise Shrine, then runs through his tangerine orchards down to a cave on the shore where he commits seppuku. Major themes The book explores the history and atmosphere of the early Showa Period and also of the Meiji Period through Isao's increasing obsession with the League of the Divine Wind, a group that attempted an insurrection in Kumamoto in October 1876, eight years after the Meiji Restoration, in reaction to the prohibition of the wearing of swords. It also discusses the Wang Yangming school of thought (according to which, \\"to know and not to act is not truly to know\\"), espoused in Japan by Chusai Oshio, a rebel who died in 1837 while leading an insurrection in Osaka. While Mishima's vision is considerably darker, more ambiguous and more complex than that of J.D. Salinger, the theme of adult corruption versus adolescent purity is strongly present throughout the novel. Isao resembles Holden Caulfield in his disdain for adult duplicity, hypocrisy, and the dreary ugliness of adult sexuality, but differs from him sharply in terms of his greater courage, his charisma and natural leadership, his passionate eloquence and athletic skill, his reverence for the past, and above all his willingness to sacrifice himself for the greater good. Isao's final acts are to a certain extent nihilistic because he performs them after he has become aware of their falsehood and futility. In other words, it is a much more profound kind of suicide than the one he had been planning. The book explores the boundary between atheism and religious belief by presenting Honda with seeming evidence of reincarnation and exploring his emotional responses. The religions of Buddhism and Shinto are contrasted.

Quotations In a letter about The League of the Divine Wind, Isao's favorite book (a book which Mishima reproduces in full), Honda writes to him: \\"At your age, however, every excitement is dangerous.

For example, judging from that light that flashes from your eyes to disconcert those around you, I would think that your very nature makes a tale of this sort 'unsuitable' for you.\\" In prison, Isao considers the reasons for the failure of his plot and subsequent imprisonment. He determines that the very act or bonding with his comrades in a \\"blood brotherhood\\" had brought about, or in the words of the novel \\"crystallized\\", an evil that is only possible in the presence of purity, musing: \\"The purest evil that human efforts could attain, in other words, was probably achieved by those men who made their wills the same and who made their eyes see the world in the same way, men who went against the pattern of life's diversity, men whose spirits shattered the natural wall of the individual body, making nothing of this barrier, set up to guard against mutual corrosion, men whose spirit accomplished what flesh could never accomplish.\\" References 1969 novels Japanese novels adapted into films Novels by Yukio Mishima Novels set in Japan Shinchosha books ja:Ë±äÈ•í„ÅÆÊµ∑#Á¨¨‰∫åÂ∑ª„ÉªÂ•îÈ¶¨ ","title":"Runaway Horses"},{"id":"1799006","text":"Dark Night is a song by The Blasters.

In the Welsh tradition, awen is the inspiration of the poet bards; or, in its personification, Awen is the inspirational muse of creative artists in general: the inspired individual (often a poet or a soothsayer) is described as an awenydd. Emma Restall Orr, founder and former head of The Druid Network, defines awen as 'flowing spirit' and says that 'Spirit energy in flow is the essence of life'.Emma Restall Orr. Living Druidry. (Piatkus Books, 2004). In current usage, awen is sometimes ascribed to musicians and poets. It is also occasionally used as a male and female given name. It appears in the third stanza of Hen Wlad fy Nhadau, the national anthem of Wales. Etymology Awen derives from the Indo-European root *-uel, meaning 'to blow', and has the same root as the Welsh word awel meaning 'breeze'. Historical attestation The first recorded attestation of the word occurs in Nennius' Historia Brittonum, a Latin text of c. 796, based in part on earlier writings by the Welsh monk, Gildas. It occurs in the phrase 'Tunc talhaern tat aguen in poemate claret' (Talhaern the father of the muse was then renowned in poetry) where the Old Welsh word aguen (awen) occurs in the Latin text describing poets from the sixth century. It is also recorded in its current form in Canu Llywarch Hen (9th or 10th century?) where Llywarch says 'I know by my awen' indicating it as a source of instinctive knowledge.Canu Llywarch Hen ed. Ifor Williams Cardiff, 1935 On connections between awen as poetic inspiration and as an infusion from the Divine, The Book of Taliesin often implies this. A particularly striking example is contained in the lines: ban pan doeth peir ogyrwen awen teir -literally ‚Äúthe three elements of inspiration that came, splendid, out of the cauldron‚Äù but implicitly ‚Äúthat came from God‚Äù as ‚Äòpeir‚Äô (cauldron) can also mean ‚Äòsovereign‚Äô often with the meaning ‚ÄòGod‚Äô. It is the ‚Äúthree elements‚Äù that is cleverly worked in here as awen was sometimes characterised as consisting of three sub-divisions (‚Äòogyrwen‚Äô) so ‚Äúthe ogyrwen of triune inspiration‚Äù, perhaps suggesting the Trinity.Legendary Poems from the Book of Taliesin ed. Marged Haycock CMCS, 2007 p.296 Giraldus Cambrensis referred to those inspired by the awen as 'awenyddion' in his Description of Wales (1194): :THERE are certain persons in Cambria, whom you will find nowhere else, called Awenyddion, or people inspired; when consulted upon any doubtful event, they roar out violently, are rendered beside themselves, and become, as it were, possessed by a spirit. They do not deliver the answer to what is required in a connected manner; but the person who skilfully observes them, will find, after many preambles, and many nugatory and incoherent, though ornamented speeches, the desired explanation conveyed in some turn of a word: they are then roused from their ecstasy, as from a deep sleep, and, as it were, by violence compelled to return to their proper senses. After having answered the questions, they do not recover till violently shaken by other people; nor can they remember the replies they have given. If consulted a second or third time upon the same point, they will make use of expressions totally different; perhaps they speak by the means of fanatic and ignorant spirits. These gifts are usually conferred upon them in dreams: some seem to have sweet milk or honey poured on their lips; others fancy that a written schedule is applied to their mouths and on awaking they publicly declare that they have received this gift. (Chapter XVI: Concerning the soothsayers of this nation, and persons as it were possessed) Gerald of Wales Description of Wales and the Journey Through Wales trans Lewis Thorpe, Penguin, various editions In 1694, the Welsh poet Henry Vaughan wrote to his cousin, the antiquary John Aubrey, in response to a request for some information about the remnants of Druidry in existence in Wales at that time, saying Neo-Druidic symbol Awen of Iolo Morganwg. In some forms of Neo-Druidism the term is symbolized by an emblem showing three straight lines that spread apart as they move downward, drawn within a circle or a series of circles of varying thickness, often with a dot, or point, atop each line. The British Druid Order attributes the symbol to Iolo Morganwg; it has been adopted by some Neo-Druids. The Neo-Druid symbol of awen The Order of Bards, Ovates and Druids (OBOD) describe the three lines as rays emanating from three points of light, with those points representing the triple aspect of deity and, also, the points at which the sun rises on the equinoxes and solstices ‚Äì known as the Triad of the Sunrises. The emblem as used by the OBOD is surrounded by three circles representing the three circles of creation. Various Neo-Druidic groups and individuals have their own interpretation of the awen. The three lines relate to earth, sea and air; body, mind and spirit; or love, wisdom and truth. It is also said that the awen stands for not simply inspiration, but for inspiration of truth; without awen one cannot proclaim truth. The three foundations of awen are the understanding of truth, the love of truth, and the maintaining of truth.J. Williams Ab Ithel, Ed. \\"The Barddas of Iolo Morganwg, Vol. I\\" A version of the awen was approved by the U.S. Veterans Administration in early 2017 for use on veteran headstones.Terrence P.

Background and composition The tune was written in 1848. There are two conflicting narratives of Shaker origin as to the composer of the song. One account attributes the song to a \\"Negro spirit\\" heard at Canterbury, New Hampshire, which would make the song a \\"gift song\\" received by a Shaker from the spirit world. Alternatively, and more widely accepted, the song's composer is said to be Joseph Brackett (1797‚Äì1882) of Alfred, Maine. A lifelong resident of the state, he first joined the Shakers at Gorham when his father's farm helped to form the nucleus of a new Shaker settlement. Resurgence and enduring popularity The song was largely unknown outside Shaker communities until Aaron Copland used its melody for the score of Martha Graham's ballet Appalachian Spring, first performed in 1944. (Shakers once worshipped on Holy Mount, in the Massachusetts portion of the Appalachians). Copland used \\"Simple Gifts\\" a second time in 1950 in his first set of Old American Songs for voice and piano, which was later orchestrated. Lyrics These are the lyrics to his one-verse song: > ‚ÄôTis the gift to be simple, ‚Äôtis the gift to be free : ‚ÄôTis the gift to come > down where we ought to be, And when we find ourselves in the place just > right, : ‚ÄôTwill be in the valley of love and delight. When true simplicity > is gained, : To bow and to bend we shan‚Äôt be ashamed, To turn, turn will be > our delight, : Till by turning, turning we come ‚Äôround right. Several Shaker manuscripts indicate that this is a ‚Äúdancing song‚Äù or a ‚Äúquick dance‚Äù. \\"Turning\\" is a common theme in Christian theology, but the references to \\"turning\\" in the last two lines have also been identified as dance instructions. When the traditional dance is performed properly, each dancer ends up where they started, \\"come 'round right\\". Tune A manuscript of Mary Hazzard of the New Lebanon, New York, Shaker community records this original version of the melody: Image:SimpleGifts.png The song resembles to a slight extent several repetitions of the opening measures of William Byrd's renaissance composition, \\"The Barley Break\\", which Byrd intended to imitate country children playing a folk game. Similarly, Brackett is claimed to have come up with the song as an imitation of what folk music sounds like. A somewhat similar musical theme arises also in a brass ensemble work Canzon per sonare no. 2 by Giovanni Gabrieli (c.1555-1612). Many people have mistakenly believed that the tune of \\"Simple Gifts\\" was a traditional Celtic one but both the music and original lyrics are actually the compositions of Brackett. \\"Simple Gifts\\" has been adapted or arranged many times since by folksingers and composers. =\\"Lord of the Dance\\"= A well known version is by English songwriter Sydney Carter, who adapted the Shaker tune for his song \\"Lord of the Dance\\", first published in 1963. The Carter lyrics were adapted, in ignorance of the actual origins, without authorization or acknowledgments by Ronan Hardiman for Michael Flatley's dance musical Lord of the Dance, which opened in 1996. The melody is used at various points throughout the show, including the piece titled \\"Lord of the Dance.\\" Other adaptations of the lyrics by Carter have occurred in the widespread belief that they are traditional, and in the public domain. Subsequent usage *The Shakers' \\"Simple Gifts\\" melody appears in Aaron Copland's music for the ballet Appalachian Spring. For many years, an excerpt was used as the opening theme for the CBS News television documentary series, CBS Reports. *Classical guitarist Christopher Parkening included an arrangement for guitar of \\"Simple Gifts\\" on his \\"Simple Gifts\\" CD released in 1990. *For its Red Album (2008), the rock band Weezer recorded \\"The Greatest Man That Ever Lived (Variations on a Shaker Hymn)\\", on which the theme is clearly heard in the piano intro and the chorus. *The Turtles recorded a song called \\"Too Young To Be One\\" which owes much of its melody to the classic Shaker work. *Judy Collins included the song on her 1970 album Whales & Nightingales. *R.E.M. used this song to open their song \\"I Believe\\" during the last half of their Work Tour in 1987. *The British punk band Toy Dolls adapted the song in their song \\"My Girlfriend's Dad's a Vicar\\", from studio albums \\"A Far Out Disc\\" (1985) and the compilation album \\"Ten Years Of Toys\\" (1989). *The song is incorporated into both the opening and closing tracks of the 1990 album \\"Simple Gifts: Instrumental Arrangements of Shaker Melodies\\" by William Coulter and Barry Phillips. *In 1998, Windham Hill Records released a collective album titled \\"Thanksgiving\\" which featured an arrangement of \\"Simple Gifts\\" performed by Thea and Tracy Silverman. *John P.

Frank Ticheli also wrote a version of \\"Simple Gifts\\", presented in Simple Gifts: Four Shaker Songs. *Yo-Yo Ma and Alison Krauss performed a duet of \\"Simple Gifts\\" on his 2001 album \\"Classic Yo-Yo\\". *On their Grammy-winning CD Simple Gifts (2008), The King's Singers perform an a cappella version titled Gift to be Simple. *In 2009, singer Jewel released a version on her album \\"Lullaby\\". *\\"Simple Gifts\\" was performed in 2009 by the Santa Clara Vanguard Drum and Bugle Corps as part of their program \\"Ballet for Martha\\" (Copland's working title for \\"Appalachian Spring\\"Matthew Naughtin, Ballet Music, 2014, p. 147. Reference copied from Appalachian Spring). *The Norfolk, England, Kipper Family -- Sid and Henry Kipper (Dick Nudds and Chris Sugden) -- wrote and recorded a version of \\"Lord of the Dance\\", calling it \\"Bored of the Dance\\". It tells of the men attending a village hall social evening being forced by the women to join in the various dances when they would rather be drinking with their friends, or getting the women to bed. It has the memorable line: \\"It's hard to dance when you're lying on your back\\". *John Williams's Air and Simple Gifts was premiered at U.S. President Obama's inauguration on January 21, 2009. It was performed by Yo-Yo Ma (cello), Itzhak Perlman (violin), Anthony McGill (clarinet) and Gabriela Montero (piano). It was a classical quartet based on the original Simple Gifts. *The Appalachian State University and the West Virginia University marching bands play arrangements of \\"Simple Gifts\\" as part of their pre game shows for football games.

She has spent most of her career with CBS News, where she began as a producer in 1971. Since 1991, she has reported for CBS's 60 Minutes. Early life and education  Stahl was born in 1941 to a Jewish family in Lynn, Massachusetts, and was raised in Swampscott, Massachusetts. She is the daughter of Dorothy J. (n√©e Tishler), and Louis E. Stahl, a food company executive. She attended Wheaton College where she was an honors graduate, majoring in history.Donna Lee, \\"Facts Come First for Lady Reporter,\\" Boston Herald American, November 26, 1976, p. 14  Career  Stahl began her television broadcasting career at Boston's original Channel 5, WHDH-TV, as a producer and on-air reporter.Anthony LaCamera, \\"Of People and Programs.\\" Boston Herald, September 30, 1974, p. 10.

Reporting Live, Simon & Schuster, 1999, opening paragraph; citation from the unabridged Large Print edition, G. K. Hall & Co., Thorndike, Maine, 1999, p. 9. Stahl credits her CBS News hire to the Federal Communications Commission's 1972 inclusion of women in its affirmative action mandate: \\"the television networks were scouring the country for women and blacks with any news experience at all. A friend in New York had called to tell me about a memo floating around CBS News mandating that 'the next reporter we hire will be a woman.'\\"Stahl, Lesley. Reporting Live, Simon & Schuster, 1999; citation from the unabridged Large Print edition, G. K. Hall & Co., Thorndike, Maine, 1999, p. 10. According to Stahl, Connie Chung and Bernard Shaw were \\"the two other 'affirmative action babies' in what became known as the Class of '72.\\" Stahl reflected in an interview on her early days at CBS how, on the night of the '72 Nixon-McGovern election returns, she found her on-air studio chair marked with masking tape, not with her name as with her colleagues, but with \\"Female\\". Stahl was the mentor of CBS news producer Susan Zirinsky. President Ronald Reagan in 1986 Stahl's prominence grew after she covered Watergate. \\"I found an apartment in the Watergate complex, moved all my stuff from Boston, and didn't miss a day of work. ... June 1972. Most of the reporters in our bureau were on the road, covering the presidential campaign. Thus, I was sent out to cover the arrest of some men who had broken into one of the buildings in the Watergate complex. That CBS let me, the newest hire, hold on to Watergate as an assignment was a measure of how unimportant the story seemed: ... I was the only television reporter covering the early court appearances. When the five Watergate burglars asked for a bail reduction, I got my first scoop. Unlike my competitors, I was able to identify them. The next time the cameraman listened when I said, 'Roll! That's them!' And so CBS was the only network to get pictures of the burglars. I was a hero at the bureau.\\" She went on to become White House correspondent during the presidencies of Jimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan and George H. W. Bush. At the Republican Convention of 1980, she broke the news on CBS that Reagan's negotiations with ex-President Gerald Ford had broken down and the answer to the question of who would be vice-presidential nominee was: \\"It's Bush! Yes, it's Bush!\\" George H. W. Bush had been standing perhaps not far away, largely off by himself, looking discouraged because he was sure he wasn't going to be chosen. Stahl was the moderator of Face the Nation between September 1983 and May 1991. In addition, she hosted 48 Hours Investigates from 2002 to 2004. In 2002, Stahl made headlines when Al Gore appeared on 60 Minutes and revealed for the first time that he would not run for president again in 2004. When Katie Couric was hired, CBS News asked Stahl to reduce her salary by $500,000 to accommodate Couric's salary, bringing her salary down to $1.8 million. In October 2007 Nicolas Sarkozy, President of France, stood up and walked away from an interview with Stahl because she asked him about his relationship with his soon-to-be estranged wife, C√©cilia. Stahl in 1998 In 1998, she appeared on the NBC sitcom Frasier, playing herself in the episode \\"Desperately Seeking Closure\\". In 2014, she served as a correspondent for Years of Living Dangerously, a documentary show about climate change. Stahl has written two books, the first of which, Reporting Live, was published in 1999: > I had decided by August 1989, in my 48th year, that I had already had the > best day of my life. ... Then we went to Rwanda to see the mountain > gorillas, Dian Fossey's gorillas in the mist. ...

She was also Princess of Asturias by marriage. Early life = Birth = Blanche was born on 9 June 1424 in Olite, Navarre. =Heiress of Navarre= In 1427, she, her brother Charles, and her sister Eleanor were proclaimed the rightful heirs of the kingdom of Navarre. Blanche was promised to the heir of Castile in the peace treaty between Navarre and Castile in 1436. She married Henry IV of Castile in 1440. The marriage was reputedly never consummated. In 1453, after thirteen years, Henry sought the annulment of the marriage. An official examination confirmed the virginity of Blanche. A divorce was granted by the Pope on the grounds that some \\"witchcraft\\" had prevented Henry from consummating the marriage. After this, Blanche was sent home to Navarre, where she was imprisoned by her family: from 1462, she was under the custody of her sister. She remained childless throughout her life.  Claimant to the throne  After the death of her brother in 1461, some dissatisfied Navarrese elements and some of the anti-Aragonese party regarded Blanche as the rightful monarch, as they had regarded Charles. They proclaimed her queen. She would have thus become Blanche II of Navarre, had not her father (who wanted to keep the government of Navarre) already had her incarcerated and thus not capable to act. John tried to marry her to Charles, Duke of Berry, and younger brother of Louis XI of France to make an alliance, but Blanche refused, and her act irritated her father. In 1464, she came back to Pamplona with the help of its bishop Nicolas de Etchabarri, who was murdered shortly after, in order to attend the Courts of Navarre.Orpustan, Jean-Baptiste (2007), p. 3 She died by poison in Orthez less than a month later. Both her father and her sister Eleanor are suggested to have been responsible for her death. Upon her death, her rights to Navarre were inherited by her next sister, Eleanor of Aragon, Countess of Foix, who however was their father's ally and supporter, and did not press her own claims until his death in 1479.

He won the 1,000 m event at the 2002 Winter Olympics after all of his opponents were involved in a last corner pile-up. He was the first athlete from the Southern Hemisphere and Australia to win a Winter Olympic gold medal and was also part of the short track relay team that won Australia's first Winter Olympic medal, a bronze in 1994.  1991 World Championships & 1992 Winter Olympics In 1991, Bradbury was part of the Australian quartet that won the 5,000 m relay at the World Championships in Sydney. It was the first time Australia had won a World Championship in a winter sport. Australia's short track relay team went into the 1992 Winter Olympics as world champions, but the team crashed in the semi- finals.Gordon (1994), p. 426.Andrews, p. 3. The Australians were in third place when Richard Nizielski lost his footing; they finished fourth and failed to reach the final.McAvaney, p. 135. Bradbury was unable to help, as he had been named as the reserve for the team and was sitting on the bench. He was not selected for any individual events.The Compendium, p. 219.  1994 Winter Olympics  At the 1994 Winter Olympics in Norway, Bradbury was part of the short track relay team that won Australia's first Winter Olympic medal, a bronze. They scraped into the four-team final after edging out Japan and New Zealand to finish second in their semi-final.Andrews, p. 251. They adopted a plan of staying on their feet as first priority, and remaining undisqualified and beating at least one of the other three finalists.Andrews, pp. 252-253. During the race, the Canadians fell and lost significant time, meaning that Australia would win their first medal if they raced conservatively and avoided a crash. Late in the race, Nizielski was fighting with his American counterpart for track position for the silver medal, but took the safe option and yielded, mindful of the lost opportunity following the crash in Albertville. Thus Bradbury, Nizielski, Andrew Murtha and Kieran Hansen became Australia's first Winter Olympics medallists. Bradbury was also entered in the 500 m and 1,000 m individual events and was the favourite going into the latter. In the first event, Bradbury came second in his heat in a time of 45.43 s and then won his quarterfinal in a time of 44.18 s to qualify for the semifinal. In the semifinal, Bradbury was knocked over by a rival and he limped home fourth, in a time of 1 m 03.51 s and was eliminated. He came fourth in the B final and was classified eighth overall out of 31 competitors.The Compendium, p. 221. In the 1,000 m event, Bradbury fell in his heat after being illegally pushed by a competitor who was later disqualified. He came home in 2 m 01.89 s, more than 30 s off the leaders' pace and was eliminated. Nevertheless, because of the high rate of accidents, Bradbury came 24th out of 31 competitors.Smart and Bradbury During a 1994 World Cup event in Montreal, another skater's blade sliced through Bradbury's right thigh after a collision; it cut through to the other side and he lost four litres of blood. Bradbury's heart rate had been up near 200 at the end of the race and this meant that blood was being pumped out fast. All four of his quadriceps muscles had been sliced through, and Bradbury thought that he would die if he lost consciousness. He needed 111 stitches and could not move for three weeks. His leg needed 18 months before it was back to full strength.Gordon, p. 290.  1998 Winter Olympics  Bradbury, Nizielski and Kieran Hansen, three of the quartet that won Australia's maiden medal in 1994, returned for the 1998 Winter Olympics in Japan with new teammate Richard Goerlitz. There were hopes that they could repeat their Lillehammer performance. However, in their qualifying race, they placed third in a time of 7 m 11.691 s and missed the final by one place, even though they had been two seconds faster than their medal-winning performance of 1994. They completed the course four seconds slower in the B final and came last in the race, and thus last out of eight teams overall.Andrews, p. 314.The Compendium, p. 224. Bradbury was again regarded as a medal contender in the individual events, but was impeded in collisions with other racers in both the 500 m and 1,000 m events.Gordon (2003), p. 291. He came third in the heats of both races, posting times of 43.766 s and 1 m 33.108 s in each race. Neither of these times were fast enough to advance him to the quarterfinals and he came 19th and 21st out of 30 competitors respectively. In September 2000, Bradbury broke his neck in a training accident. Another skater fell in front of him and Bradbury tried to jump over him, but instead clipped him and tripped head first into the barriers. As a result, Bradbury fractured his C4 and C5 vertebrae. He spent a month and a half in a halo brace, and needed four pins to be inserted in his skull and screws and plates bolted into his back and chest. Doctors told Bradbury that he would not be able to take to the ice again, but he was determined to reach another Olympics. He wanted redemption after the crashes in the individual races in 1994 and 1998, even though he conceded that he would be past his best in terms of challenging for the medals. 2002 Winter Olympics Bradbury took an unlikely gold medal win in the men's short track 1000 metres event at the Salt Lake City 2002 Winter Olympic Games. He won his heat convincingly in the 1,000 m, posting a time of 1:30.956. However, in the quarter-finals, Bradbury was allocated to the same race as Apolo Anton Ohno, the favourite from the host nation, and Marc Gagnon of Canada, the defending world champion. Only the top two finishers from each race would proceed to the semifinals. Bradbury finished third in his race and thought himself to be eliminated, but Gagnon was disqualified for obstructing another racer, allowing the Australian to advance to the semi-finals.Gordon (2003), pp. 287-288. After consulting his national coach Ann Zhang, Bradbury's strategy from the semi-final onwards was to cruise behind his opponents and hope that they crashed, as he could not match their pace.Gordon (2003), pp. 287-299. His reasoning was that risk-taking by the favourites could cause a collision due to a racing incident, and if two or more skaters fell, the remaining three would all get medals, and that as he was slower than his opponents, trying to challenge them directly would only increase his own chances of falling. Bradbury said that he was satisfied with his result, and felt that as the second-oldest competitor in the field, he was not able to match his opponents in four races on the same night.Gordon (2003), p. 288. In his semi-final race, Bradbury was in last place, well off the pace of the medal favourites. However, defending champion Kim Dong-sung of South Korea, multiple Olympic medallist Li Jiajun of China and Mathieu Turcotte of Canada all crashed, paving the way for Bradbury to take first place and advancing him through to the final. In the final, Bradbury was again well off the pace when all four of his competitors (Ohno, Ahn Hyun-Soo, Li and Turcotte) crashed out at the final corner while jostling for the gold medal. This allowed Bradbury, who was around 15 m behind with only 50 m to go, to avoid the pile-up and take the victory. Bradbury became the first person from a southern hemisphere country to win a Winter Olympic event.Gordon (2003), p. 287. After a period of delay, the judges upheld the result and did not order a re-race, confirming Bradbury's victory.Gordon (2003), pp. 289-290. In an interview after winning his gold, referring to his two career- and life-threatening accidents,Gordon (2003), pp. 290-291. Bradbury said \\"Obviously I wasn't the fastest skater. I don't think I'll take the medal as the minute-and-a-half of the race I actually won. I'll take it as the last decade of the hard slog I put in.\\" He also said \\"I was the oldest bloke in the field and I knew that, skating four races back to back, I wasn't going to have any petrol left in the tank. So there was no point in getting there and mixing it up because I was going to be in last place anyway. So (I figured) I might as well stay out of the way and be in last place and hope that some people get tangled up.\\" He later said that he never expected all of his opponents to fall, but added that he felt that the other four racers were under extreme pressure and might have over-attacked and taken too many risks. Bradbury cited the host nation pressure on Ohno, who was expected to win all four of his events. Li, much like Bradbury himself, had won Olympic medals but was yet to take a gold medal, Turcotte only had one individual event, and Ahn had been the form racer at the Olympics so far. Bradbury felt that none would be willing to settle for less than gold and that as a result, they might collide.Gordon (2003), pp. 288-289. Bradbury had three other events at the 2002 Winter Olympics. In the relay event, the Australians came third in their heat in a time of 7:19.177 and failed to make the final. They came second in the B final and finished sixth out of seven teams.The Compendium, p. 226. In the 1,500 m event, Bradbury came third in his heat, before placing fourth in the semi-final and being eliminated. He then came fifth in the B final to finish 10th out of 29 entrants. He was unable to maintain his speed through the competition; after posting a time of 2:22.632 in the heats, Bradbury slowed by three seconds in each of his next two races. In the 500 m event, Bradbury came second in his heat and was eliminated after coming third in his quarter-final. He finished 14th out of 31 overall. = Legacy = The unlikely win turned Bradbury into something of a folk hero, comparable to ski jumper Eddie \\"The Eagle\\" Edwards and the 1988 Jamaican bobsleigh team. Many newspapers hailed Bradbury and held him as an example of the value of an underdog never giving up, regardless of the odds against them. The unusual manner of his victory made news across the world.Gordon (2003), p. 286. However, some unhappy American commentators also made fun of the race and used it to criticise what they perceived as a lack of merit required to win a short track event. USA Today said \\"The first winter gold medal in the history of Australia fell out of the sky like a bagged goose. He looked like the tortoise behind four hares\\",Gordon (2003), p. 289. while the Boston Globe said that \\"multiple crashes that allow the wrong person to win are part of the deal\\". Bradbury's feat has entered the Australian colloquial vernacular in the phrase \\"doing a Bradbury\\", or \\"Bradburied\\" (as a verb) meaning an unexpected or unusual success.http://www.abc.net.au/rn/talks/8.30/sportsf/stories/s1490956.htm Bradbury's triumph was celebrated by Australia Post issuing a 45-cent stamp of him, which followed on from their issuing stamps of Australian gold medallists at the 2000 Sydney Olympics. Bradbury's stamp was issued on 20 February 2002, four days after his victory. He received $20,000 for the use of his image. He said the fee \\"should get me a car. I haven‚Äôt had a car for a long time\\",\\"Gold medallists get framed stamps\\" Australian Olympic Committee 25 February 2002. and later described having a stamp issued as \\"a great honour\\". Before the Olympics, Bradbury had needed to borrow $1,000 from his parents to fix his old car in order to go to training. Bradbury was courted for sponsorship after his triumph and was interviewed on many American television shows. He had previously supported himself by making skating boots in a backyard workshop; his Revolutionary Boot Company supplied Ohno with free boots and Bradbury had asked Ohno to endorse his boots when he won in Salt Lake City, not thinking that he would defeat the American.Gordon (2003), p. 292. Retirement Bradbury retired after the 2002 Olympics. He commentated at the 2006 Winter Olympics, and for the Nine Network and Foxtel at the 2010 Winter Olympics. In 2005, Bradbury was a contestant in the second series of the Australian television show Dancing with the Stars. In 2019, he competed in the sixth season of Australian Survivor. He was eliminated on Day 12 and finished in 20th place. Motor racing career After retiring from skating, Bradbury participated in competitive motor racing. After placing fourth in the 2005 Australian Grand Prix Celebrity Race,http://www.natsoft.com.au/cgi- bin/results.cgi?06/03/2005.APGP.R14 Retrieved 2 March 2010 he competed in Queensland state-level Formula Vee championship events in 2006 and 2007, placing sixth in both years. Retrieved 2 March 2010 In 2007, he raced in the National Formula Vee Championships at Morgan Park Raceway, placing 15th. In 2009, Bradbury competed in the Australian Mini Challenge at the Tasmanian round and 2010 at Queensland Raceway as their Uber Star. He also made a one- off appearance in the V8 Ute Series at Adelaide in March 2010, driving with regular Ute racer Jason Gomersall on the support program of the 2010 Clipsal 500. Honours In 2007, Bradbury was awarded a Medal of the Order of Australia for his Olympic gold medal win. He was also inducted into the Sport Australia Hall of Fame in that year. In 2009, Bradbury was inducted into the Queensland Sport Hall of Fame.

It originally appeared as a series of essays in the New York Review of Books between 1973 and 1977. Contents In the book, Sontag expresses her views on the history and present-day role of photography in capitalist societies as of the 1970s. Sontag discusses many examples of modern photography. Among these, she contrasts Diane Arbus's work with that of Depression-era documentary photography commissioned by the Farm Security Administration. She also explores the history of American photography in relation to the idealistic notions of America put forth by Walt Whitman and traces these ideas through to the increasingly cynical aesthetic notions of the 1970s, particularly in relation to Arbus and Andy Warhol. Sontag argues that the proliferation of photographic images had begun to establish within people a \\"chronic voyeuristic relation\\"Sontag, Susan (1977), On Photography, Penguin Books, London to the world around them. Among the consequences of photography is that the meaning of all events is leveled and made equal. This idea did not originate with Sontag, who often synthesized European cultural thinkers with her particular eye toward the United States. As she argues, perhaps originally with regard to photography, the medium fostered an attitude of anti- intervention. Sontag says that the individual who seeks to record cannot intervene, and that the person who intervenes cannot then faithfully record, for the two aims contradict each other. In this context, she discusses in some depth the relationship of photography to politics. Criticism and acclaim On Photography won the National Book Critics Circle Award for 1977 and was selected among the top 20 books of 1977 by the editors of the New York Times Book Review. In 1977, William H. Gass, writing in The New York Times, said the book \\"shall surely stand near the beginning of all our thoughts upon the subject\\" of photography. In a 1998 appraisal of the work, Michael Starenko, wrote in Afterimage that \\"On Photography has become so deeply absorbed into this discourse that Sontag's claims about photography, as well as her mode of argument, have become part of the rhetorical 'tool kit' that photography theorists and critics carry around in their heads.\\" He added that \\"no other photography book, not even The Family of Man (1955), which sold four million copies before finally going out of print in 1978, received a wider range of press coverage than On Photography.\\" https://www.questia.com/library/journal/1G1-20582788/sontag-s-reception Sontag's work is literary and polemical rather than academic. It includes no bibliography, and few notes. There is little sustained analysis of the work of any particular photographer and is not in any sense a research project as often written by doctoral students. For example, in her discussion of The Family of Man exhibition she quotes almost word-for-word Roland Barthes' critique in his book Mythologies, without acknowledgement; \\"By purporting to show that individuals are born, work, laugh, and die everywhere in the same way, \\"The Family of Man\\" denies the determining weight of history - of genuine and historically embedded differences, injustices, and conflicts.\\" Many of the reviews from the world of art photography that followed On Photography at the time of its publication were skeptical and often hostile, such as those of Colin L. Westerbeck and Michael Lesy. In 2003, Sontag published a partial refutation of the opinions she espoused in On Photography in her book Regarding the Pain of Others. This book may be considered as a postscript or addition to On Photography. Sontag's publishing history includes a similar sequence with regard to her work Illness as Metaphor from the 1970s and AIDS and Its Metaphors a decade later, which included an expansion of ideas contained in the earlier work.

Like all Waters' films, it was filmed and set in Baltimore; this film was set in the Hampden neighborhood. The film, starring Edward Furlong, examines the rise to fame and potential fortune of a budding photographer. Co- starring Christina Ricci, Lili Taylor, Mary Kay Place, Martha Plimpton, Brendan Sexton III, and Bess Armstrong, the film received mixed reviews from critics and was a commercial failure, grossing over $2 million from a $6 million budget. Plot In a Baltimore neighborhood known for having the thickest local accent, Pecker is an unassuming 18-year-old who works in a sandwich shop and takes photos of his loving but peculiar family and friends on the side. Pecker, so named for his childhood habit of \\"pecking\\" at his food, stumbles into fame when his work is \\"discovered\\" by a savvy New York art dealer, Rorey Wheeler. Pecker's pictures, taken with a cheap Canon Canonet 28, are grainy, out-of-focus studies of unglamorous subjects, but they strike a chord with New York art collectors. Unfortunately, instant over-exposure has its downside. Rorey's efforts to turn Pecker into an art sensation threaten to ruin the low-key lifestyle that was his inspiration. He abandons his trusty old rangefinder camera for a new, full-featured Nikon N50. Pecker finds that his best friend, Matt, can't shoplift anymore now that Pecker's photographs have increased his visibility. Shelley, Pecker's obsessive girlfriend who runs a laundromat, seems especially distressed when the press dub her a \\"stain goddess\\" and mistake her good-natured \\"pin-up\\" poses for pornographic come- ons. When his family is dubbed \\"culturally challenged\\" by an overzealous critic, they begin to feel the uncomfortable glare of stardom. Pecker's mother Joyce, is no longer free to dispense fashion tips to the homeless clientele at her thrift shop. Pecker's grandmother, Memama, endures public ridicule when her experience with a talking statue of the Virgin Mary is exposed on the cover of a national art magazine. Tina, Pecker's older sister, is fired from her job emceeing go-go dancing at a gay bar because Pecker's edgy photographs chronicle the sex practices of the club's patrons. Even Little Chrissy, his six-year-old sister, feels the pressure of celebrity when her eating disorder is exposed, bringing unwanted attention from nosy child welfare agencies, and she's mistakenly diagnosed with Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder and prescribed Ritalin. After Pecker's new-found fame disrupts the lives of his family and friends, Pecker turns the tables on the art world by refusing to participate in a scheduled show at the Whitney Museum of Art. Instead, he forces New York art collectors to come to Baltimore to see his latest photographs, which portray the same people who disparaged his family in an unflattering light, one photo shows Lynn Wentworth adjusting her breasts in a mirror. Pecker is then asked what he plans to do next. He replies that he would like to direct a film. Cast Reception On Rotten Tomatoes the film has an approval rating of 52% based on reviews from 46 critics. On Metacritic it has a score of 66 out of 100 based on 24 reviews, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews\\". Describing it as \\"John Waters' first stab at making a mainstream movie,\\" Edvins Beitiks' review in The San Francisco Examiner said it \\"starts out well and winds up no worse than most of the stuff that comes out of Hollywood\\". In his review for the Chicago Sun-Times, Roger Ebert noted a \\"tension between the gentler new Waters and his anarchic past. In the scenes in the male strip bar, for example, we keep waiting for Waters to break loose and shock us, and he never does, except with a few awkward language choices.

It is located north of the Melbourne CBD, Victoria, Australia, in the suburb of Parkville. Many sporting facilities are provided including the North Park Tennis Club, Royal Park Golf Course, football and soccer ovals, baseball and cricket pitches, State Netball & Hockey Centre, and cycling and walking paths. On the corner of Gatehouse Street and Royal Parade there is a native garden. There are wide vistas of grassland and lightly timbered areas with eucalypts, casuarina, and acacias. The Melbourne City Council administers the park and instituted in 1984 a park management plan. A wetlands area was developed in 2005. The grassy hill between the Royal Children's Hospital and the Native Garden is ideal for kite flying during the day. Over the summer months, members of the Astronomical Society of Victoria set up telescopes and conduct evening talks and tours of the night sky from this vantage point. Wildlife The park is home to many native animals such as possums, and a rich variety of birdlife which includes: Pacific black duck, chestnut teal, white-faced heron, brown goshawk, collared sparrowhawk, Horsfield's bronze cuckoo, Australian hobby, galah, red-rumped parrot, eastern rosella, superb fairy-wren, white-plumed honeyeater, spotted pardalote, white-browed scrubwren, grey fantail and red-browed finch. The park is home to a regionally significant population of White's skink (Egernia whitii) and a section of habitat is maintained specifically for this species. History In the early years of European settlement Wurundjeri campfires were sometimes seen in the vicinity of Royal Park, although the Yarra people generally preferred camping beside the Yarra River or Merri Creek. Governor Charles La Trobe set aside in 1845 a reservation of for parkland and open space, however, by the time of its proclamation in 1854 this had been reduced to a reserve of . This was further reduced to with the rapid increase of population from the Victorian gold rush, to form the suburb of Parkville from three new residential areas, Parkville North, South and West. In 1861 the Royal Melbourne Zoological Gardens was allocated . Further excisions followed for roads, tramline and the Upfield railway line; University High School (1929), Royal Melbourne Hospital (1944), Royal Children's Hospital (1957), Royal Dental Hospital (1963). In 1860 the Burke and Wills expedition set out from Royal Park to cross Australia from south to north. They perished on the return journey. A cairn now marks the departure point of their expedition in Royal Park. The park was used for military encampments during World War One and Two, with Camp Pell being used by United States forces during the Second World War. After the war, the permanent buildings of Camp Pell were used for emergency housing accommodation until 1960. As of 2005, the one existing building from Camp Pell is used as an 'Urban Camp' to provide accommodation for rural school children and other groups when visiting Melbourne. =The Royal Park Master Plan Design Competition= Following many years of agitation by resident groups and various failed planning attempts, the Melbourne City Council held a design competition in 1984, judged by representatives of the Australian Institute of Landscape Architects, Royal Australian Institute of Parks and Recreation, Melbourne University's School of Environmental Planning, and the Melbourne City Council. The winning entry by landscape architects Brian Stafford and Ronald Jones expressed a philosophy that the character of the Park was inherent in its form ‚Äì 'a place where the earth swells, the dome of the sky soars overhead and the horizon beckons'. A sense of the landscape at the time of Europeans‚Äô first encounter with it was to be evoked by planting indigenous species and enhancing the park's spacious quality, principally through a process of 'editing' rather than adding new features. The aim was 'to provide a park for persons rather than machinery, for individual public activity rather than restricted private institutions, and for psychological recreation as well as physical activity'. The plan proposed extensive planting of indigenous trees, while the expansive hilltop in the park's south-east was to be cleared and planted with native grasses. A network of walking and cycle paths was proposed, along with works to reduce the impact of traffic and parking, including closing through roads, rebuilding a large section of Macarthur Road as a tunnel, and reorganising car parks. The plan was greeted with consternation. Sporting groups were concerned with a potential loss of facilities; the Zoo administration wanted more parking rather than any attempt at control; there was concern for maintenance of motor routes; and The Age highlighted the intent to 'rip out' exotic trees. Council adopted the Master Plan ‚Äì in principle and subject to various qualifications ‚Äì after three years of debate. The first works to implement the plan were completed in the early 1990s. Two new ovals were graded near Flemington Road to allow removal of the sports grounds, changing room and car park perched on the hilltop in the park's south-east, which now has uncluttered views of Melbourne's skyline. A new pond was formed, featuring rockwork by the landscape designer Gordon Ford. A new layout for access and parking around the Zoo was finally agreed upon after a decade of negotiation between the Council and Zoo. Reorganization of the car parks, closure of various roads, development of forecourts to the zoo's main entry and extensive new plantings were completed in 1997. A formal review of the Master Plan commenced in 1996. This included extensive public consultation that identified overwhelming support for the principles established by the winning entry in the 1984 Royal Park Master Plan Design Competition. The Master Plan as reviewed endorsed the objectives of the 1984 document and introduced proposals such as a major wetland water recycling project west of the railway line. It was approved by Council in November 1997. =Commonwealth Games Village= In 2003 the Labor Government of Steve Bracks selected the former Royal Park Psychiatric Hospital site, bordering on Moonee Ponds Creek and in the neighbourhood of Royal Park (but not in the park), for the athletes village for the 2006 Commonwealth Games. After the games, the site developers, Australand and Citta Property Group, sold the housing. Opponents of the village criticised the building of the village citing the destruction of more than 1000 trees, demolition of 4 of the hospital buildings pending a heritage listing, and denigration of the heritage value of the remaining buildings, a lost opportunity to return a development back to public parkland, and privatisation of public lands. Sporting groups criticised security arrangements for the athletes' village with large sections of the park and sporting grounds having security fencing erected for the exclusive use of athletes. This disrupted many community sporting associations from their regular use of sporting facilities. =Royal Children's Hospital extension= In 2005 the Bracks Labor Government selected an adjacent site in Royal Park to build a new Royal Children's Hospital. Sections of the old hospital were demolished and restored to parklands. While the move attracted some opposition from green groups, it was promoted with the claim that there would be no net loss of parkland at Royal Park. The basis of area calculations used to support this claim is unclear. Relocation of the hospital's helipad onto the roof of the new building has removed this impact from the park, but after completion of construction, it appears that the hospital buildings now occupy a substantially larger area than previously, and parkland has been lost.

Transport = Suburban railway = The Upfield railway line travels through Royal Park with Royal Park station being a convenient stop for the Melbourne Zoo. = Trams = A light rail for trams runs through the park, which is served by route 58 to both West Coburg and Toorak. The route 19 tram runs up Royal Parade, to the east of the park, which operates northbound to North Coburg, and southbound to Flinders Street station. Two tram routes also run up Flemington Road, to the west of the park. The routes 57 and 59 operate in a northbound direction to West Maribyrnong and Airport West respectively. Both routes operate to Flinders Street station in a southbound direction. = Cyclists and pedestrians = The Capital City Trail for cyclists follows the train line through Royal Park from the Moonee Ponds Creek Trail at Flemington Bridge, past Melbourne Zoo, and under Royal Parade along the converted Inner Circle railway line to Princes Park.

Minto died in the line of duty, killed by an escaped inmate. Early life Harry Minto was born in Salem, Oregon, in 1864, the son of Oregon pioneer John Minto. In 1890, Minto was married to Jessie Glenn (b. 1870 Salem, Oregon; d. 1956 Tampa, Florida). Minto was chief of police for the Salem, Oregon police department from 1891 to 1895 and he served two terms as the Marion County sheriff. He was elected sheriff in 1908, and served through 1913. His older brother, John Wilson Minto, was previously the sheriff as well as chief of police in Portland. In 1914, Minto was appointed as the Superintendent of the Oregon State Penitentiary by governor Oswald West. He replaced Berton K. Lawson, who had been involved in the events at Copperfield, Oregon early that year. As warden, he supervised the infamous serial killer Carl Panzram, in June 1915, when Panzram still was in his early twenties and before his known murderings. Death Warden Harry Minto believed in harsh treatment of inmates, including beatings and isolation, among other disciplinary measures. On September 27, 1915, inmate Otto Hooker escaped from a work gang at the prison and Minto was one of many law enforcement personnel who went searching for the escaped prisoner. After Hooker shot and wounded one law enforcement officer, Minto caught up with Hooker near Albany around 11:30 pm. There Minto challenged Hooker, and Hooker shot Minto in the head, killing him instantly. Hooker was mortally wounded the next day during capture. Minto‚Äôs remains were cremated in Portland, Oregon. Hooker's accomplice, Carl Panzram, was executed in 1930 for killing a prison employee at the United States Penitentiary, Leavenworth.

It is listed in the National Register of Historic Places, and is considered to be one of the best examples of Gothic Revival architecture in Washington.Eva Barsoum, 1994, It is located at the intersection of Massachusetts Avenue (Embassy Row) and Wisconsin Avenue, and occupies the 221,000 square foot (21,000 m¬≤) block between those two avenues and Garfield Street, Cathedral Avenue, and 38th Street. Diagonally across the Massachusetts-Wisconsin intersection is the St. Albans School, which occupies the southwestern corner of the grounds of the Washington National Cathedral. History The land Alban Towers is situated on was purchased by its developer from the Washington National Cathedral in the early 1920s. It opened in 1929 as the largest apartment building in Washington, D.C. By today's standards, however, it is modest in size at six stories tall. Its prominent architect/developer team, Robert O. Scholz, designer, David A. Baer, builder, designed the building in the Gothic Revival with tan-colored brick and limestone employed to simulate the monochrome composition of Gothic style architecture; popular in the 1920s and because it would complement the Washington National Cathedral. (Together Scholz & Baer were responsible for the construction of at least eight apartment buildings between the years 1922 and 1931. As a result, they earned a reputation as one of the more important apartment house architect/developer teams of the post-World War I decade. Representing the product of the collaboration, both whom specialized in 1920s apartment building construction, Alban Towers reflects the work of notable planners and architects who influenced the evolution of apartment construction in Washington, D.C.) The lobbies and hallways, with their richly ornamented Gothic/Art Deco elements, were integral to the exterior scheme. Paved in quarry tiles of brown, orange, and ocher laid in a geometric pattern, the lobby is topped by plaster crown molding composed of rope and infilled with alternating roses, acorns, and thistles. These symbols of Great Britain serve to reinforce the English Gothic tenor of the building. The walls of the upper- floor hallways are covered in rough-finished stucco, lending a ‚Äúsumptuous texture that is rarely found in apartment buildings.‚Äù Billed as an apartment hotel, Alban Towers offered its residents 24-hour maid service and a public dining room. Indeed, on the ground floor of the building were housed a beauty shop, a travel agency, a grocery store, and a lunch counter. Each of the upper floors contained a maid's lounge and a bathroom facility. Constructed during the decade in which apartment construction exceeded that of single-family houses, Alban Towers attempted to compensate for smaller family space by furnishing its tenants with luxurious amenities and public areas. The relative modesty of individual apartments is offset by the grandeur of the public spaces. Alban Towers was the Washington, D.C. headquarters of supporters of the presidential campaigns of John F. Kennedy, Eugene McCarthy, Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan. Its hotel suites were frequented by such celebrities as Bette Davis and Frank Sinatra. During World War II it was discovered that Japanese spies had used the Alban Towers residence of the Japanese Naval attach√© as a lookout point to the city as well as a place to tap into official radio frequencies. Its apartments were leased by the embassies of Great Britain, Canada, Australia, South Africa and others to house their diplomats. However, during the 1950s, this created controversy when the embassies of the newly independent African states attempted to lease some of its apartments; Washington was still a racially segregated city and the African diplomats were refused residence in Alban Towers and other area apartment buildings. Originally, the building featured 132 units, mostly of lavish one-bedroom apartment homes, as well as a number of hotel suites. In 1930, responding to the large demand for apartment in the building, the number of units was increased by 84 with the construction of an additional two wings on the south side of the building in 1930. In the 1960s, neglect of the owners to afford proper care and maintenance to the building led to its decline in status. In 1973 it was sold to Georgetown University for use as housing for some 450 students. In the 1980s and 1990s the building fell into a state of serious disrepair. The partnership of Edmonson & Gallagher contracted to purchase the building in 1986, but an association of tenants attempted to exercise a statutory right of first refusal, resulting in clouded title that was not resolved for several years. Sally Berk, president of the DC Preservation League, nominated the building as an historic landmark in 1990, and it was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1994. In 1995, after the sale to Edmonson had fallen through, Georgetown contracted to sell the building to a partnership led by Starwood. At the time of this sale, only 30 apartments in the building were occupied. Starwood paid several tenants to leave their apartments, and paid others to move to temporary housing while renovation work was to be conducted. The building was closed and renovation work began in the summer of 1997, but was stopped shortly thereafter for undisclosed reasons and ultimately abandoned. Finally, in 1999, the building was purchased by Charles E. Smith Co. Residential Realty, which undertook a costly restoration effort. Particular attention was paid to the preservation of the building's original architectural elements. The restoration included restoration architects and artisans to ensure that the original character of the building was retained. The exterior, lobby and hallways were restored, while the actual apartments -- which had been demolished by previous owners -- were completely rebuilt to serve modern demands. The total cost of the restoration was $63 million. The building was reopened in 2001. Today, the building provides residence to many diplomats and government officials, as well as to a lesser number of American University students, known to some as The AParty.http://eagle1.american.edu/~ad8172a/ Building Alban Towers' exterior comprises Limestone Tracery, bas-relief panels and brick, and has much Gothic-inspired ornamentation, including arched balcony openings, gargoyles, and rising spirals on the roof. The main entrance on Massachusetts Avenue features a crenelated porte-cochere with carved spandrels and corbel stones supporting its gothic arches. Also featured on the porte-cochere are six carved heads; five of medieval males and the sixth of an aviator inspired by Charles A. Lindbergh's historic flight. The grand lobby is spacious and designed using Tudor ideals, featuring Tudor strapwork and plaster ceilings. The hallways (which are protected under historic preservation laws) are designed with a rough plaster finish, pointed arches, and sculptural plaster pilasters and brackets. Sculptured plaster arches and panels and friezes in the public corridors resemble the signs of the zodiac. Today, the building offers 229 units in the form of studio and one, two and three bedroom luxury apartments between 486 and as rental properties. There are two indoor garages for the building's residents; attached and detached. The attached garage is incorporated into the building's basement level and accommodates a limited number of cars. The detached garage is located opposite the building on the building's access drive, and features two underground heated levels of parking spaces. Additionally, the detached garage serves as access to the private garages of a number of luxury townhouses -- Alban Row -- located above the garage on 38th Street. The building includes a grand lobby, a party room, fitness center, swimming pool, conference center, business center and rooftop garden. Grounds An access drive runs behind the building from Cathedral Avenue to Garfield Street. Originally, a large park was located behind the building, but under the current ownership, it was scaled down into a nationally recognized butterfly garden, which was designed in coordination with the Washington Area Butterfly Club. The purpose of the scaling down of the park was to provide land for the Alban Row townhouses, which were built to offset the costs of the expensive restoration of 1999-2001\\\\.

Since 2007, he has been the touring bass player for The Jesus and Mary Chain having previously toured with the group from 1997 to 1998. Career Circa 1987 King played bass for Felt, Biff Bang Pow! and The Servants. Featuring on the former's Bubblegum Perfume compilation. He also fronted Apple Boutique that released a single 1987. He appeared playing drums in Primal Scream's 1987 music video for \\"Gentle Tuesday\\", the opening track of the group's 1987 album entitled Sonic Flower Groove; chosen because of his haircut. The sound recordings of his drumming were not used for any release. He also worked as a researcher for NME. =Lush (1992-97)= In 1992, King replaced Lush bassist, Steve Rippon, before the release of Lush's first proper album, Spooky. In a 2008 interview with Von Pip Musical Express, King recalled how he joined Lush: \\"Miki called me up at work. I was a picture researcher at the NME at the time. I remember having read in the paper the story that Steve was leaving. We arranged to meet up in the not-that-famous-at-the-time pre-Britpop \\"The Good Mixer\\" in Camden Town. I lived just round the corner... We of course all got very drunk ...and I was in the band\\". He adds, \\"It was a bit of an eyebrow raiser ‚Äì but also a bit of a relief really ‚Äì that they didn't even want me to do an audition. In retrospect it made sense, as the most important thing when you're stuck together with someone 16 hours a day is that you get on pretty well\\". Lush was added to the Lollapalooza roster in 1992 by its organizer, Perry Farrell, the Jane's Addiction/Porno for Pyros frontman, who personally requested them for his new tour program. King said, \\"touring America that year was the most amazing thing for me. We had a tour bus, great audiences, and drove the length and breadth of the country\\". The 1992 Lollapalooza tour also featured The Jesus And Mary Chain. King was with Lush until they officially announced their breakup on 23 February 1997. =Post Lush (1997-2010)= After Lush, King stated, \\"I did do a bit of office work here and there ‚Äì Q, Vox, NME ‚Äì and was even a film extra for a short period of time\\".

It lies east of Munich and is the district‚Äôs biggest community. Vaterstetten is on the outskirts of Munich, roughly twenty minutes by S-Bahn from Marienplatz. Geography =Location= Vaterstetten borders in the north on the community of Poing, in the northeast on the community of Anzing, in the east on the unincorporated area of the Ebersberg Forest (Ebersberger Forst), in the southeast on the community of Zorneding (all in Ebersberg district), in the southwest on the community of Grasbrunn, and in the west on the communities of Haar and Feldkirchen (all three in Munich district). =Constituent communities= The community consists of the constituent centres of Baldham, Hergolding, Neufarn, Parsdorf, Purfing, Vaterstetten and Wei√üenfeld.  History  Wei√üenfeldchurch Soldier killed in action - USAAF B-24J Liberator shot down by german Flak on July 19th, 1944 Because of being on the border of the sandur of Munich, an early settlement in the southern part of today's community area is unlikely, because the tillage was disadvantaged here compared to the northern part. Consequently, the oldest town of the community is Purfing, where a settlement from the period between 750 and 600 BC was found. Vaterstetten was founded by the Old Bavarii Fater family. Until 1056 the district of Wei√üenfeld (Wizzinvelt) was in the possession of the Holy Roman Emperor Henry III as a Reichsgut. The fact he instructed his wife about negotiations over his ownership on these lands on his deathbed in the year 1056, shows how significant they must have been for him. It was here in the summer of 1800 that the Parsdorf Ceasefire was signed by Major General Franz Joseph of Dietrichstein and General Jean Victor Moreau, which later came to an end with the Battle of Hohenlinden. In 1818, when there was the Royal Bavarian territorial reform, the community of Parsdorf was founded and it replaced the former \\"Steuerdistricts\\". The administrative seat of the community was transferred to Parsdorf probably because of its important coaching inn. An increase of the population of the community began with the connection to the rail network in 1871. In 1913 physicist and philosopher Ernst Mach settled in Vaterstetten, where he died 1916. The district of Baldham was selected as a location for the studio of Hitler's sculptor Josef Thorak before the beginning of World War II. The building, which was created by Albert Speer, is now a branch of the Bavarian State Archaeological Collection in Munich. On 5 May 1945, the delegations of the German Army Group G and the 7th U.S. Army met here to discuss the surrender of the 200,000 German soldiers in southern Germany, which was finally signed in the neighbour community of Haar. On 19 July 1944, a US Consolidated B-24 bomber crashed into the forest between Vaterstetten and the neighbouring town of Ottendichl (part of Haar). In 2009, the place has been marked by a memorial plaque. The current community of Vaterstetten came into being with the municipal reform of 1978. The old community included all the same current centres as are now found in Vaterstetten, but it was named Parsdorf. On 1 May 1978, the community‚Äôs name was changed to Vaterstetten, by which time the community‚Äôs main centre had long been of that same name, along with Baldham. Before that reform, a part of Baldham (named Baldham-Kolonie) belonged to Zorneding. Economy =Transport= Vaterstetten is part of the Munich Transport and Tariff Association (M√ºnchner Verkehrs- und Tarifverbund, or MVV). The Munich S-Bahn‚Äôs lines S4 and S6 run over the Munich‚ÄìRosenheim line through the community serving the Vaterstetten and Baldham stations. Two buslines of the Vaterstettener Inner√∂rtlicher Personennahverkehr (Vaterstetten Local Passenger Transport, or VIP) run regularly in the local area. The name Vaterstetten is well known to many motorists for its Autobahn roadhouse lying on the A99. The Autobahn itself runs by the community about one kilometre away. Through the community‚Äôs south end runs the Wasserburger Landstra√üe (officially named B304), one of Munich‚Äôs main arterial roads. =Educational institutions= Within the community stand four elementary schools, a Hauptschule, a Realschule and the Humboldt-Gymnasium Vaterstetten, as well as a folk high school and a music school.

He was a substitute for the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs and the Committee on Fisheries and the Committee on Foreign Affairs. Biography Fava was born in Catania, Sicily. His father Giuseppe Fava, founder of the I Siciliani monthly magazine ‚Äì for which Claudio Fava also worked ‚Äì was killed by the Mafia on 5 January 1984. A graduate in law (1980) and a qualified journalist (since 1982). He was one of the founders of La Rete and was elected to the Chamber of Deputies in the Sicilian Regional Assembly in 1991. In 1992-1994 served as member of the Chamber of Deputies of Italy. Later he was the Regional Secretary of the Democrats of the Left (DS) in Sicily (1999‚Äì2001), and became a member of the national executive of the DS in 1999. On 5 November 2006, he worked as an International Observer of the Nicaraguan General Elections in 2006 for the European Union. Also in November 2006, he led the European parliament's special investigation into the role of European Union member states in the operation of CIA secret prisons. The report criticized the governments of Poland and Romania for failing to cooperate with investigations, and also chastised several top EU officials . In May 2007 at the 4th National Congress of the Democrats of the Left (DS) he supported the motion put to the congress by Fabio Mussi that opposed the formation of a larger center-left party, the Democratic Party and after its defeat and the formation of the PD subsequently left the Democrats of the Left and joined Sinistra Democratica (Democratic Left). He became the National Coordinator of Sinistra Democratica on the resignation of Fabio Mussi after the electoral defeat of Sinistra Arcobaleno (Rainbow Left) of which Sinistra Democratica was a constituent part. He is the Coordinator of the National Secretariat of Sinistra Ecologia Libert√† (Left Ecology Freedom). In the European elections of 2009 he was a candidate for Sinistra e Libert√† but failed to get elected. He is also a writer and a scenarist. He co-wrote the screenplay of the movie One hundred steps (I cento passi) about the life and death of Antimafia activist Giuseppe Impastato in 1978 that won the Venice Film Festival in 2001 for the best script. In December 2015, a new parliamentary group was created in the Camera dei deputati (Chamber of Deputies), the Sinistra Italiana (Italian Left). Sinistra e Libert√† (Left Ecology Freedom) was officially dissolved on 17 December 2016, while Sinistra Italiana became a party on 19 February 2017, with only 13 of the 37 initially elected with SEL in the 2013 general election remaining in the parliamentary group. In response to this re-configuration, on 25 February 2017, 43 MPs, including Fava, created Article 1 ‚Äì Democratic and Progressive Movement (, MDP), as a left-wing interest group supporting the Gentiloni Cabinet, but being independent from the Democratic Party. Fellow prominent members include the former party chairman and candidate for the 2013 general election Pierluigi Bersani and the former House Majority Leader Roberto Speranza. 16 senators also joined the group. On 4 September 2017, he was chosen as the candidate of the left for the presidency of the Sicilian Region in 2017, supported by SI, MDP, as well as Possible, the Communist Refoundation Party, Civil Action, Italian Communist Party, and other minor left-wing parties.

Biography Gothus was born at S√∂derk√∂ping in √ñsterg√∂tland County, Sweden. In 1588, Gothus travelled to Germany and studied in the Rostock University for three years. He was influenced by Pierre de la Ram√©e (1515-1572) and his philosophy.See entry of Laurentius Paulinus Gothus in the Rostock Matrikelportal After receiving a Master's degree, he returned to Uppsala in time for the Uppsala Synod in 1593 where the founding dogmas of the Church of Sweden were made final. He was appointed professor of logic at the recently reopened, and now Lutheran focused, Uppsala University. In 1598 he re-transferred himself to the professorship in astronomy. He was, along with some other professors, suspended from his duty, because of demands that professors to sign a petition supporting Sigismund III Vasa as king of Sweden. However in 1604, his Protestant uncle Duke Charles was crowned as King Charles IX of Sweden. When a comet appeared on the sky in 1607, Laurentius declared he could interpret what this signified. The belief in astrology and the significance of heavenly signs were still strong. His interpretations made an impression on King Charles and he was re-instated him at the university. Laurentius had acquired a belief in Ramism from the writings French educational reformer Petrus Ramus and defended his views rigorously. Later he was also involved in philosophical disputes with Jonas Magni Wexionensis (1583-1651) who was a professor and head of Uppsala University and who was an adherent of Aristotle. Gothus served as Bishop of the Diocese of Skara (1608‚Äì1609) and Bishop of the Diocese of Str√§ngn√§s (1609‚Äì1637). In 1628, he was tasked with the investigation of the visionary Margareta i Kumla. Her visions and alleged meetings with demons and angels were described by Bishop Gothus in a meeting of the Swedish clergy in 1629. During the reign of Christina, Queen of Sweden, Gothus served as Archbishop of Uppsala and Primate of Sweden from 1637‚Äì1646. Works Laurentius wrote many theological and astronomical works and also published calendars. He furthermore published a thorough Ethica Christiana 1615‚Äì30, a work in six parts in Swedish about Lutheranism. Following this, he in 1631 wrote a summary of this work which has been called the prime catechetical work from 17th century Sweden. He also wrote some historical works about Swedish history.

They exhibit unusual mechanical responses to applied stress or strain due to the geometrical constraints that the phase coexistence imposes. The mechanical response includes transitions between solid-like and fluid-like behavior as well as fluctuations. Their mechanical properties can be attributed to characteristics such as high disorder, caging, and clustering on multiple length scales. Example Shaving cream is an example of a complex fluid. Without stress, the foam appears to be a solid: it does not flow and can support (very) light loads. However, when adequate stress is applied, shaving cream flows easily like a fluid. On the level of individual bubbles, the flow is due to rearrangements of small collections of bubbles. On this scale, the flow is not smooth, but instead consists of fluctuations due to rearrangements of the bubbles and releases of stress. These fluctuations are similar to the fluctuations that are studied in earthquakes. Dynamics The dynamics of the particles in complex fluids are an area of current research. Energy lost due to friction may be a nonlinear function of the velocity and normal forces. The topological inhibition to flow by the crowding of constituent particles is a key element in these systems. Under certain conditions, including high densities and low temperatures, when externally driven to induce flow, complex fluids are characterized by irregular intervals of solid-like behavior followed by stress relaxations due to particle rearrangements. The dynamics of these systems are highly nonlinear in nature. The increase in stress by an infinitesimal amount or a small displacement of a single particle can result in the difference between an arrested state and fluid-like behavior. Although many materials found in nature can fit into the class of complex fluids, very little is well understood about them. Inconsistent and controversial conclusions concerning their material properties still persist. The careful study of these systems may lead to \\"new physics\\" and new states of matter. For example, it has been suggested that these systems can jam and a \\"jamming phase diagram\\" can be used to consider how these systems can jam and unjam. It is not known whether further research will demonstrate these findings, or whether such a theoretical framework will prove useful. As yet this large body of theoretical work has been poorly supported with experiments.

Tilting is closely associated with another poker term, \\"steam\\". Placing an opponent on tilt or dealing with being on tilt oneself is an important aspect of poker. It is a relatively frequent occurrence due to frustration, animosity against other players, or simply bad luck. One possible origin of the word \\"tilt\\" is as a reference to tilting a pinball machine. The frustration from seeing the ball follow a path towards the gap between the flippers can lead to the player physically tilting the machine in an attempt to guide the ball towards the flippers. However, in doing so, some games will flash the word \\"TILT\\" and freeze the flippers, causing the ball to be lost for certain; as in poker, this suggests that over-aggression due to frustration leads to severely detrimental playing techniques.Gambling with the Myth of the American Dream by Aaron M. Duncan While \\"tilting\\" originally applied to poker, it has recently become a common term when talking about other games, especially chess and esports titles. Tilting in esports causes players to \\"lose control due to anger\\".What to pay attention to in the OpenAI Five Benchmark  Common Causes of Tilt  The most common cause of tilt is losing, especially being defeated in a particularly public and humiliating fashion. In poker, a bad beat can upset the mental equilibrium essential for optimal poker judgment, causing frustration. Another common cause of tilt is bad manners from other players causing frustration which eventually leads to tilting. Though not as commonly acknowledged or discussed, it is also quite possible to go on \\"winner's tilt\\" as a result of a positive trigger: such as winning unexpectedly, or going on a string of good luck. Strong positive emotions can be just as dizzying and detrimental to one's play as negative ones. Tilting and winner's tilt can both lead to the same habits. Advice when tilted For the beginning player, the elimination or minimization of tilt is considered an essential improvement that can be made in play (for instance in the strategic advice of Mike Caro). Many advanced players (after logging thousands of table-hours) claim to have outgrown \\"tilt\\" and frustration, although other poker professionals admit it is still a \\"leak\\" in their game. One commonly suggested way to fight tilt is to disregard the outcomes of pots, particularly those that are statistically uncommon. So-called \\"bad beats,\\" when one puts a lot of chips in the pot with the best hand and still loses, deserve little thought; they are the product of variance, not bad strategy. This mindset calls for the player to understand poker is a game of decisions and correct play in making the right bets over a long period of time. Another method for avoiding tilt is to try lowering one's variance, even if that means winning fewer chips overall. Therefore, one may play passively and fold marginal hands, even though that may mean folding the winning hand. This may also imply that one plays tightly‚Äî and looks for advantageous situations. Once tilt begins, players are well-advised to leave the table and return when emotions have subsided. When away from the table, players are advised to take time to refresh themselves, eat and drink (non- alcoholic) if necessary, and take a break outside in the fresh air. If none of these work in lessening tilt, players are advised to leave the game and not return to playing until they have shaken off the results that led to the tilt. The intent of the advice is to prevent the upset person from letting negative emotions lead to bigger losses that can seriously hurt one's bankroll. Tilt must be taken seriously, requiring immediate attention following its presence. The progression in poker for chronically tilted players may be significantly hindered as their judgement becomes progressively impaired as agitation becomes more prominent. Paying close attention to playing statistics can assist in preventing this, as a statistical overview of recent hands can reduce the players likelihood to play impulsive hands habitually.  Tilting others  The act of putting an opponent on tilt may not pay off in the short run, but if some time is put into practicing it, a player can quickly become an expert at \\"tilting\\" other players (with or without using bad manners). In theory, the long-run payoff of this tactic is a monetarily positive expectation. Common methods of putting a table on tilt include: # Playing junk hands that have a lower chance of winning in the hope of either sucking out and delivering a bad beat (which can be an enjoyable occasional style which will make the table's play \\"looser\\") or bluffing the opponent off a better hand (with the option of showing the bluff for maximum tilting effect). # Victimising individuals at the table, (which is often considered a more old- fashioned tactic, identified with 1970s \\"verbal\\" experts such as Amarillo Slim.) # Pretending intoxication, i.e. hustling, excellently demonstrated by Paul Newman against Robert Shaw in The Sting (although his technique included cheating). # Constant chattering, making weird noises and motions whenever you win a hand, or other erratic behavior is a \\"tilting\\" or \\"loosening\\" approach first discussed by Mike Caro. # Taking an inordinate or otherwise inappropriate amount of time to announce and show your hand (also called \\"slow-rolling\\") at the showdown. (Such deliberate breaches of etiquette have the side effect of slowing play and risking barring, thereby limiting the earnings of the expert player. For this, and other social reasons, such tactics are mostly associated with novices.) These antics can upset the other players at the table with the intention of getting them to play poorly.

He also went on to manage sides West Brom,Arsenal, Galatasaray, Queens Park Rangers and Coventry City. Howe was also a successful coach and has been described as one of the most influential figures of the English footballing game. Playing career Howe was born in the Springfield area of Wolverhampton in 1935 and spent his secondary education at St Peter's Collegiate School. Howe joined the West Bromwich Albion ground staff after leaving school,Soccer Who's Who compiled by Maurice Golesworthy Sportsmans Book Club London 1965 joining the club as a youth player in December 1950. He turned professional in November 1952, but did not make his debut until 1955, against Everton. Playing as a full back, Howe went on to win the FA Cup of 1954 with West Brom. In all he played 379 league and cup games scoring 19 goals for the Baggies in twelve years. Howe was signed by Billy Wright's Arsenal in 1964, and was made club captain. However, in March 1966 he broke his leg playing against Blackpool and only played two further first team games both in September 1966. Firstly against Manchester City in the League on the 10th and then on the 13th against Gillingham in the League Cup. All together Howe was capped 70 times for Arsenal. In 2004, he was named as one of West Bromwich Albion's 16 greatest players, in a poll organised as part of the club's 125th anniversary celebrations. Coaching career Howe retired from playing and became Arsenal's reserve team coach under Bertie Mee, then stepping up to first team coach after the departure of Dave Sexton in October 1967. Arsenal won the Double in 1971 with Howe playing a crucial role. Not long afterward he returned to his old club, West Bromwich Albion, as manager. Howe's tenure at WBA was not a success, as the club were relegated to Division Two in 1973. Howe then joined Leeds United as a coach, later becoming assistant manager under Jimmy Armfield, before moving on to manage Turkish club Galatasaray in 1975. Howe rejoined Arsenal in 1977 as head coach, under Terry Neill. After Neill's sacking on 16 December 1983, Howe became Arsenal caretaker-manager and was appointed permanently after the game against Leicester City on 28 April 1984. Despite introducing young players including Tony Adams, David Rocastle and Niall Quinn to the team during the mid-1980s, he was unable to win trophies, as Arsenal finished either 6th or 7th under him, although they did briefly top the league in October 1984. After just over two years in the job, Howe resigned on 22 March 1986, shortly after Arsenal's match against Coventry City. George Graham succeeded him. This was subsequent to circulated reports that the board were looking at the time at FC Barcelona manager Terry Venables. Howe later joined Wimbledon as assistant to Bobby Gould in 1987, and helped them win the FA Cup with a shock win over Liverpool in 1988. His coaching expertise earned him a great deal of credit for Wimbledon's cup triumph. Howe then left Wimbledon to manage QPR between November 1989 and May 1991, with Gould briefly assisting him in the first half of the 1990‚Äì91 season. In early 1992, Howe assisted Barry Fry with defensive work at BarnetTony Thornton 'The Club That Wouldn't Die' Tiger Publications 1994 Shortly after leaving QPR, he became assistant manager to Terry Butcher at Coventry City and became manager in January 1992 when Butcher was sacked.

She was the daughter of Quintus Aquilius. The praenomen of Julia was given to her after becoming an empress. Life Severa was a Vestal Virgin and, as such, her marriage to Elagabalus in late 220 was the cause of enormous controversy ‚Äì traditionally, the punishment for breaking the thirty- year vow of celibacy was death by being buried alive.Plutarch, Parallel Lives, Life of Numa Pompilius, 10 Elagabalus is believed to have had religious reasons for marrying Severa ‚Äì he himself was a follower of the eastern sun god El-Gabal, and when marrying himself to Severa, he also conducted a symbolic marriage of his god to Vesta.Cassius Dio, Roman History LXXX.9 Both these marriages were revoked shortly afterwards, however. This was possibly on the urging of Julia Maesa, the grandmother who had engineered Elagabalus' rise to the imperial throne. Elagabalus then married Annia Faustina, a more generally acceptable choice to the senatorial elite. Within a short time, however, Elagabalus had divorced Faustina and returned to living with Severa, claiming that the original divorce was invalid. It is believed that Severa remained with Elagabalus until his assassination in 222. The two are not believed to have had any children. Severa's own opinions about the entire affair are not very well recorded. Some sources state that she was forced to marry against her will, and others go further, alleging rape. It is claimed by some historians, however, that many stories about Elagabalus have been exaggerated by his enemies, and so there is no certainty about what actually happened. It is unclear whether Elagabalus had any real feelings towards Severa, or whether he was more concerned with the symbolism of the marriage. Elagabalus also had relationships with men, and the historian Cassius Dio claims that Elagabalus had a more stable relationship with his chariot driver, Hierocles, than with any of his wives.

Thomas (1874‚Äì1958) was a Canadian-born American industrialist and entrepreneur. He was trained as a millsmith (specifically in woodworking), and moved to Cleveland, Ohio, where he was employed by a streetcar manufacturer. Thomas was born on a farm outside of Chatham, Ontario, grew up in the area and in 1901 he moved to the US settling in Detroit. He attended night courses at Case Institute of Technology, and learned technical drawing, design skills, and structural engineering. As the streetcar manufacturers transitioned from wooden to steel construction, his expertise allowed him to accept a better offer with Southern Car Company in High Point, North Carolina, where he became chief engineer, and he and his wife moved south in 1910. Thomas became chief engineer, draftsman and designer for the company, using both his mechanical skills and his experience as a skilled woodworker. After he was laid off there when the company folded in 1916, he was persuaded to undertake a contract to renovate streetcars for the Southern Public Utilities Company of Charlotte, North Carolina, using Southern's former facilities and many of its employees. The following year, he organized Perley A. Thomas Car Works, which became famous for its streetcars. Perley A. Thomas streetcars were renowned for their expert craftsmanship and solid construction, and operated in many large North American cities, including Detroit, Michigan, New York City, Miami, Florida and San Juan, Puerto Rico. A famous Tennessee Williams play and later film of the same name was set in New Orleans, Louisiana, where Perley A. Thomas streetcars were operated on the route labeled \\"Desire\\" around the period of 1947 in which the story was set; hence the name: A Streetcar Named Desire. Late in the 20th century, local employees carefully restored the cars, which operate on a heritage streetcar system. As he had noted and taken advantage of the transition from wooden to steel streetcars, he also recognized the transition from streetcars to buses which North America was undergoing in the 1930s. Thomas guided his company through a transition to bus manufacturing in 1936. The Perley A. Thomas Car Works was later reorganized as Thomas Built Buses, Inc., and became one of the three principal builders of large school buses in the United States by the end of the 20th century. It is still based in High Point, and is part of the Freightliner Group of Daimler AG, a worldwide automotive manufacturer. Perley A. Thomas was inducted into the North Carolina Transportation Hall of Fame in 2004. He was inducted into the North American Railway Hall of Fame, St Thomas, Ontario, in 2010.

Maurice's only son, Albert, died in infancy. Anna was the second wife of William the Silent. Anna was born and died in Dresden. Her wealth drew many suitors; before the proposal of Orange in 1560, there were negotiations with the Swedish royal house. She accepted the suit of William I of Orange, and they were married on 25 August 1561. Early life After the death of her younger brother Albert (born November 28, 1545 ‚Ä† April 12, 1546), Anna grew up as an only child, and might have been spoiled by her parents, particularly her mother. There are indications that Anna suffered from a physical deformity (a back problem or uneven shoulders) and that she might have walked with a limp. After her father's death on 11 July 1553, his younger brother, August (1526‚Äì1586), succeeded him as Elector of Saxony, resulting in a loss of Anna's in rank. Shortly afterwards, Anna's mother married Duke Johann Friedrich II of Saxony (1529‚Äì1595). On 4 November 1555, six months after her second marriage, her mother died under mysterious circumstances. The 11-year-old orphan then returned to her late father's Dresden court and was placed under the guardianship of her uncle August and his wife, Anne of Denmark and Norway. Sources indicate that the young princess chafed under her aunt's regime, was often unhappy and felt alone. At the same time, she was described as proud, defiant, and stubborn as well as intelligent and passionate. Due to her late parents' legacies, Anna was considered the wealthiest heiress in Germany at the time. In 1556, Erik, son of the Swedish king Gustav Vasa, sought her hand in marriage, followed two years later by William of Orange. A marriage with a rich heiress and relation to the important electoral houses of Germany for him seemed of great value. Money may have not been one of the main motives for the marriage, but was probably the furthest planned course of the marriage. Anna's maternal grandfather, Philip the Magnanimous of Hesse, was opposed to the marriage. First, he did not consider William of Orange, already having a male heir, as befitting for an elector's daughter, believing she could marry someone of even higher rank. Secondly, there would have been too much debt incurred in the event of William's death. Philip's negative attitude delayed the marriage for a full year. Ultimately, however, the decisive factor was probably that William was a valuable ally for Germany and his Dutch resources for the Protestant cause. Anna of Saxony‚ÄîEngraving by Abraham de Bruyn (1566) Marriage to William I of Orange-Nassau On 2 June 1561 the marriage contract was signed in Torgau. Anna's dowry would be the large sum of 100,000 thalers. The wedding took place on 24 August 1561 in Leipzig. On 1 September 1561 William of Orange, along with his young wife, relocated to the Netherlands. The marriage produced five children, of whom three survived to adulthood: #Anna (born and died Brussels, 31 October 1562). #Anna (Breda, 5 November 1563 ‚Äì Franeker, 13 June 1588), married on 25 November 1587 to William Louis, Count of Nassau-Dillenburg. #Maurice August Philip (Brussels, 8 December 1564 ‚Äì Brussels, 3 March 1566). #Maurice (Dillenburg, 13 November 1567 ‚Äì The Hague, 23 April 1625), later Prince of Orange and Governor of the Netherlands. #Emilia (K√∂ln, 10 April 1569 ‚Äì Geneva, 6 March 1629), married on 7 November 1597 to Manuel of Portugal. Just a few months after the wedding, in 1562 difficulties arose between her and her husband. Anna received letters from her uncle meant for William stating he should work more towards pleasing her. Both tried to end the rumours that they had an unhappy marriage. By 1565, it was well known in all the courts of Germany and the Netherlands that the marriage was an unhappy one. Her uncle August tried to save face by making claims that disputes arose due to his brother Louis antagonizing William. In 1566 William finally complained about the \\"contentious\\" nature of his wife to her Saxon uncle August and her Hessian uncle Landgrave Wilhelm IV of Hesse- Kassel (1532‚Äì1592). After the death of her first son Maurice in 1566, Anna fell to severe depression and suicidal thoughts for the first time. She also tried to drown her grief with excessive alcohol consumption. In 1567 William had to flee due to his opposition to the Habsburg Netherlands, and went with his wife to Dillenburg, the German headquarters of the family. On 14 November 1567 she bore a son and named him Maurice again. At the baptism of 11‚Äì19 January 1568 a message arrived for William in Burgundy stating that on 20 December 1567 all his Dutch lands and possessions had been confiscated. When Wilhelm on 15 August 1568 went back to Brabant to continue his war against the Spaniards, Anna decided on 20 October 1568 although pregnant again, to leave Dillenburg with her court (probably 43 people), to escape the antipathies of his mother and to create a new home in Cologne. Their two children, Anna and Maurits, had been taken by her mother-in-law to Braunfels due to the risk of disease. The next year, after a fierce battle with William's mother, she was able to bring her children back to him. Her daughter Emilia was born on 10 April 1569 in Cologne. On 4 March 1569 Anna met her husband in Mannheim. William's campaign against the Duke of Alba had failed, and King Philip II of Spain had forced him out. After this, he left Germany and went to support the Huguenots in France in their faith struggles. Since William could no longer provide for the family, Anna looked to other means of support. She considered either persuading the Duke of Alba returning their confiscated goods, or demanding payment from Wilhelm as specified in the contract of 12,000 guilders or the castles of Diez or Hadamar. This would have meant a severe financial burden to be borne for Nassau. Anna became a substantial risk to the family. To enforce their claims, they purchased the services of the successful lawyer Jan Rubens in the end of January 1569, the father of the painter Peter Paul Rubens, who had left Antwerp because of his Calvinist faith in 1568, and found refuge in Cologne. The case was begun in January 1570 at the Royal Brussels to take fiscal action for their confiscated goods in the Netherlands. Affair Anna desired to see her husband again and met with him in May 1570 in Butzbach to discuss financial matters as well as other important topics. In June 1570, Anna and William moved in together again in Siegen for a few weeks, where she had settled with her three children. It was there where she began an affair with her lawyer Jan Rubens. During the Christmas holidays from 24 to 26 December 1570 William visited his family there again. It was likely a harmonious time, because he persuaded Anna to visit him in January 1571 in Dillenburg, where she even was willing to forego, for the time, payments from her jointure. She was pregnant again, this time from her lover. William accused Anna of adultery at this point and made plans to separate from her. Rubens was often with Anna because he was their counsellor, financial advisor and attorney, and thus was suspected of adultery with Anna between 7 and 10 March 1571. He was arrested outside the city of Siegen when he was on his way to see her. He was blackmailed for a suitable confession. Anna was put under pressure too: either they must confess themselves or Rubens would be executed. Anna agreed on 26 March 1571 to plead guilty. On 22 August 1571 Anna's last child, Christine, was born. On the basis of the allegation, William of Orange didn't recognize the child as his daughter. Christine received the name van Dietz. On 14 December 1571 Anna had to sign their consent to the final separation from her husband. In addition, William of Orange was not willing to pay maintenance for her. Imprisonment and death In September 1572 Anna decided to challenge the Imperial Court's ruling for her financial rights. At this time her Hessian and Saxon relatives had already made plans to turn Beilstein castle into a prison, to hold her captive as an adulteress. On 1 October 1572, she was brought there with her youngest daughter Christine. Three years later, her daughter was taken from her. In March of that year, although the divorce was not finalized, the first news appeared of an impending remarriage of William of Orange. His chosen wife was the former Abbess of Jouarre, Charlotte de Bourbon-Montpensier, a daughter of Louis II of Bourbon, Duke of Montpensier, and his first wife, Jacqueline de Longwy. Outraged at this news, some of Anna's relatives demanded the return of large wedding gifts despite her possible infidelity. Her Uncle August also demanded of William, whom he now called \\"Head of all the rogues and rebels \\" claimed one of the counties of Nassau, Hadamar and Diez. He also insisted that the marriage of the prince was not legally ended yet, and thus he had no right to remarry or confiscate her property. Anna did not admit her adultery in court, and if she did, then she could have proven that the prince had broken his marriage agreement. He also ordered the immediate transfer of his niece from Nassau to Saxony. When Anna learned in December 1575 of her upcoming transferral to Saxony, she attempted suicide. After a long stay in Zeitz, she was taken to Dresden in December 1576. There, the windows of her room were walled up and fitted with additional iron bars. At the door was a square hole in the top panel that provided a narrow grid, which was closed off outside. Through this hole food and drinks were served to her. At the door there was also another iron gate, virtually guaranteeing no chance of escape. As of May 1577, Anna was continuously hemorrhaging. She died on 18 December 1577, shortly before her 33rd birthday. Her bones reportedly lie in the cathedral of Meissen near her ancestors in a nameless tomb. Literature *Hellmut Kretzschmar.

Roberto Busa - 2006 - In the background the Index Thomisticus Biography Born in Vicenza, the second of five children, he attended primary school in Bolzano and grammar school in Verona and in Belluno. In 1928 he entered the Episcopal Seminary of Belluno, completing high school there, and took the first two-year course of Theology with Albino Luciani, the future Pope John Paul I. In 1933 he joined the Society of Jesus, where he got a diploma in Philosophy in 1937 and one in Theology in 1941 and where he was ordained priest in 1940. From 1940 till 1943 he was an auxiliary army chaplain in the National Army and later in the partisan forces. In 1946 he graduated in Philosophy at the Papal Gregorian University of Rome with a degree thesis entitled \\"The Thomistic Terminology of Interiority\\", which was published in 1949. He was full professor of Ontology, Theodicy and Scientific Methodology and, for some years, a librarian in the \\"Aloisianum\\" Faculty of Philosophy of Gallarate. The Index Thomisticus In 1946 he planned the Index Thomisticus, as a tool for performing text searches within the massive corpus of Aquinas's works. In 1949 he met with Thomas J. Watson, the founder of IBM, and was able to persuade him to sponsor the Index Thomisticus. The project lasted about 30 years, and eventually produced in the 1970s the 56 printed volumes of the Index Thomisticus. In 1989, a CD-ROM version was produced. In addition, in 2005 a web-based version made its debut, sponsored by the Fundaci√≥n Tom√°s de Aquino and CAEL; the design and programming of this version were carried about by E. Alarc√≥n and E. Bernot, in collaboration with Busa. In 2006 the Index Thomisticus Treebank project (directed by Marco Passarotti) started the syntactic annotation of the entire corpus. The Busa Prize The Alliance of Digital Humanities Organizations (ADHO) awards the \\"Busa Prize\\", which honors leaders in the field of humanities computing. The first Busa Prize was awarded in 1998 to Busa himself. Later winners include: * John Burrows (Australia) (presented in 2001, New York, New York, USA) * Susan Hockey (UK) (presented in 2004, Gothenburg, Sweden) * Wilhelm Ott (Germany) (2007, Champaign-Urbana, Illinois, USA) * Joseph Raben (USA) (2010, Kings College London, UK) * Willard McCarty (UK) (2013, Lincoln, Nebraska, USA) * Helen Ag√ºera (USA) (2016, Krak√≥w, Poland) *Tito Orlandi (Italy) (2019, Utrecht, Netherlands) Recent projects Before his death, Busa had been teaching at the Papal Gregorian University in Rome, at the \\"Aloisianum\\" Faculty of Philosophy in Gallarate, and at the Catholic Sacred Heart University in Milan. He was also working at the LTB project (LTB stands for Bicultural Thomistic Lexicon), which aims at understanding the Latin concepts used by Thomas Aquinas in the terms of contemporary culture.
