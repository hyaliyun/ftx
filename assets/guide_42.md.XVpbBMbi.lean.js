As a playwright, her works have been produced all over the world, in places like Panama, New York City, Lisbon, the Azores, Los Angeles, Santa Cruz, London, Toronto, Seattle, Vancouver and Victoria. Her works have been noted for \\"frequently incorporating music, politics, and humor.\\" Pulitzer Prize winning playwright Suzan-Lori Parks has described Avila as a \\"wonderful writer, tremendously gifted, reliable and innovative\\".  Early life and education  = Early life = Born in Maryland, Avila spent the majority of her childhood in San Jose, California. On her father's side, she has a distinct Azorean-Portuguese heritage. Her grandfather, before he immigrated to America to get an education, was a photographer in his home village of Ribeiras, Pico. The specifics of her mother's history are less obvious. In an interview with arts advocate Chris Casquilho on the website HowlRound, Avila has mentioned that her mother was \\"a part of a state bureaucratic experiment in social engineering... [she was] given up for adoption at birth .. [and] placed with a family that was a ‚Äúclose genetic match‚Äù to her biological parents; then all information leading back to [her] birth parents was wiped out.\\" Avila was first introduced to theater when a childhood friend of hers asked her to come watch a play she was in. From that moment, Avila has said, that theater quickly became \\"all she ever wanted to do\\". She first showed interest in becoming either an actor or director. He first paid acting was as a reader at San Jose Rep. An early mentor of hers ‚Äì the executive director of the repertory Jim Reber ‚Äì taught her about management and producing. It was not until college, though, the she began to consider becoming a playwright. = Education = Avila was in the class of 1987 at Sara Clara University; she studied theater, acting, and art history. She wrote her first play inspired by a historical event she studied in a theater history course. It was about \\"a [commedia de'll arte] troupe in the sixteenth-century run by a woman that was captured by terrorists, which led to the overthrow of the French government\\". Often feeling like women were underrepresented on the stage, Avila was determined to tell the story of that artist. After graduating from Sara Clara, Avila received a full scholarship to attend California Institute of the Arts. There she was mentored by, now, Pulitzer Prize winning playwright Suzan-Lori Parks. Parks' work, specifically American Play, had a profound impact on Avila. It inspired to seek out stories that are often not seen on the American stage.

Through the program, around 150 young writers, 16 to 18 years old, are \\"mentored through the creation of original dramatic works\\". LEAP strives to cultivate in their students \\"positive relationships\\" with their creativity; it has been credited as a fundamental component in many of it artists' lives. Avila served as the director for one year before handing over the position to the current director Shawn Macdonald. =Program= All applicants are asked to submit multiple pieces of writing. Once accepted, students gain access to classes taught by the program leader, are given opportunities to network with theater professionals working on new plays, take trips to see select productions, and, lastly, get the chance to have their work workshopped and read by professional actors at their annual festival. By the end of the program, many of the artists will leave with a full length dramatic script.

Its type species is Anaerococcus prevotii. These bacteria are Gram-positive and strictly anaerobic. The genus Anaerococcus was proposed in 2001. Its genome was sequenced in August 2009. The genus Anaerococcus is one of six genera classified within the group GPAC (Gram-Positive Anaerobic Cocci). These six genera (Peptostreptococcus, Peptoniphilus, Parvimonas, Finegoldia, Anaerococcus and Murdochiella) are found in the human body as part of the commensal human microbiota. It can cause infection and is a normal part of the human microbiome. Most of the species in this genus can be found as part of the normal flora of the skin, human vagina, nasal cavity, oral cavity and feces. It is a pathogen of humans found in ovarian abscesses, chronic wounds and vaginal discharge. Moreover, some of the species can be isolated from foot ulcers and knee arthirtis. It can be present in urinary tract infections, chronic ulcers, pleural empyema, blood infections, and soft tissue infections. It is involved in polymicrobial infections. Farther more, strains of Anaerococcus were found in the armpit microbiota suggesting some species in this genus could play a role in axillary odor.  Physiology  The genus Anaerococcus are non motile bacteria who can not form spores and. Depending of the species the arrangement can be different. The most common arrangements within this genus are pairs, tetrads, short chains and irregular formations. Their cells size can differ from 0.6Œºm to 0.9Œºm. However, when they are grown using enrinched blood agar their size can go from 0.5Œºm to 2Œºm. In this genus, there a more than one major cellular fatty acids: C18:1, C16:1, C18 and C16. Most species in this genus are indole- negative and coaguase-negative. In general, the species of Anaerococcus presents susceptibility to penicillins but are resistant to tetracycline, erythromycin and clindamycin.  Metabolism  The genus Anaerococcus are classified as saccharolytic bacteria. Its species can be arranged from weakly saccharolytic (ex. A. prevotii, A. lactolyticus) to strongly saccharolytic (ex. A. hydrogenalis). This genus can ferment carbohydrates weakly. The major sources of energy use in the metabolism of Anaerococcus are peptones and aminoacids. The three major sugars fermented within this genus are glucose, mannose, fructose and sucrose. After fermenting the sugars, Anaerococcus produce weak acids as their metabolic end product. Within these metabolic end products, this genus ca produce butyric acid, lactic acid, and some propionic and succinic acid. Nonetheless, the major metabolite produced by Anaerococcus is butyrate. Species Until recently, the genus Anaerococcus have 14 known species. Six of the species were initially classified in the genus Peptostreptococcus but then based on their characteristics were re-classified in the new genus Anaerococcus: A. hydrogenalis, A. lactolyticus, A. octavius, A. prevotii, A. tetradius, and A. vaginalis. Throughout the years, the specie who has been more commolny found on the body within this genus is A. prevotii. = Anaerococcus hydrogenalis = A. hydrogenalis it is present in vaginal discharges and oarian abscesses. Presence of Anaerococcus hydrogenalis in the gut metabolism and their coline consumption has been associated to cardiovascular diseases. Contrary to most of the species in this genus, Anaerococcus hydrogenalis is indole-positive. Also, some strains in this specie can produce urease. = Anaerococcus lactolyticus = Anaerococcus lactolyticus is one of two species of the genus Anaerococcus who have been found from diabetic foot. Moreover, A. lactolyticus can be extracted from pressure ulcers. = Anaerococcus octavius = Contrary to most of the species in the genus, Anaerococcus octavius was not related to human infections. Nevertheless, recently a new case revealed A. octavius can cause bacteremia. Even though is uncommon, Anaerococcus octavius can be the cause for human infections. Other studies has found A. octavius as part of the nasal cavity, skin and vagina normal flora. This bacteria can ferment ribose, glucose, and mannose. = Anaerococcus prevotii = A. prevotii is normally found in vaginal discharges, human plasma and some types of abscesses as ovarian, peritoneal sacral and/or lung abscesses. Even more, Anaerococcus prevotii is part of the normal flora in the skin, oral cavity and the gut. Studies has shown Anaerococcus prevotii presents resistance to Ceftazidime, Clindamycin, Levofloxacin. Unlike the other species, A. prevotii can not ferment glucose. = Anaerococcus tetradius = A. tetradius was first isolated from vaginal discharges and ovarian abscesses. This bacteria can ferment glucose and mannose. = Anaerococcus vaginalis = A. vaginalis was first recovered from vaginal discharges and ovarian abscesses although this bacteria can also be found in pressure ulcers and diabetic foot. Some strains from this specie can be indole-positive. = Anaerococcus murdochii = A. murdochii presents resistance against antiobiotics clindamycin and kanamycin. Also, studies have discovered this species have intermedite resistance to pencillins. = Anaerococcus degenerii = A. degenerii = Anaerococcus provencensis = A. provencensis was isolated from a cervical abscess. This specie can ferment lactose, unlike A. tetradius, A. prevotii, and A. octavius. The first analysis made on Anaerococcus provencensis showed it is susceptible to penicillin G, imipenem, amoxillin, metronidazole, cefotetan and vancomycin. = Anaerococcus senegalensis = A. senegalensis is one of the few species in Anerococcus whose genome has been sequenced. The genome has a size of 1,790,835 bp. Analsis made did not show presence of a plasmid. Initially, Anaerococcus senegalensis was found in the fecal flora of a healthy person. = Anaerococcus rubiinfantis = A. rubiinfantis was discovered from a stool sample taken from an infant with severe acute malnutrition in Senegal. Based on a genomic analysis, Anaerococcus rubiinfantis has high antibiotic susceptibility. For that reason this bacteria can be treated with common oral antibiotics. A. rubiinfantis have catalase activity, which is not common from an anaerobic bacteria. = Anaerococcus marasmi = A. marasmi was first found in 2016 from a stool sample on a child with marasmus. Just like A. rubiinfantis, Anaerococcus marasmi is catalse positive. A. marasmi can grow in a range of pH between 6.5 to 8. Moreover, A. marasmi has a high sequence similarity (97.6%) with A. prevotii based on their 16S rRNA. = Anaerococcus urinomassiliensis = A. urinomassiliensis was isolated from an urine sample of a male adolescent with membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis and autoinmune hepatitis. It took 10 days of anaerobic incubation to observe growth from this bacteria. Anaerococcus urinomassiliensis does not have either oxidase or catalse activity. = Anaerococcus nagyae = A. nagyae was first found in a blood culture from a patient with ischemia and influenza. The cells of Anaerococcus nagyae are arranged in pairs. Although it can weakly ferment mannose, studies has shown this anaerobic bacteria can not ferment glucose and raffinose. A. nagyae is resistant to colistin, but it is susceptible to vancomycin and kanamycin.

Along with others, such as Norman Robinson, he was an early practitioner of Shotokan karate in South Africa and his establishment of the South African branch of the Japan Karate Association (JKA) in 1965 after training in Japan, along with his subsequent promotion of the art in South Africa, earned him the appellation of 'The Father of South African Karate'.Shotokan Karate Magazine, Issue 42, January 1995 In 1963, he was one of the first westerners to be invited into the JKA's famous Instructor Class in the Tokyo Honbu dojo and he was later one of four non-Japanese karateka to sit on the JKA's international Shihankai. He was also the first non-Japanese karateka to attain 7th dan from the JKA and also the first to attain 8th dan. Today, he is the highest ranking non- Japanese karate master of that organization.Robin L. Rielly, Karate Basics, Tuttle Publishing, 20 Dec 2011Black Belt, Dec 1984, p94, Vol. 22, No. 12, ISSN 0277-3066 He is also known for his acting roles in several martial arts films of the 1970s and 1980s. Early life Schmidt was born on 6 October 1936 in Kokstad, Transkei, South Africa. He was educated at King Edward VII High School and then studied at the University of South Africa where he obtained a master's degree in Communications. His route into martial arts was initially through judo in which he competed nationally and later karate. Karate Stan Schmidt is credited with formally introducing karate to South Africa in the 1950s along with other men such as Len Barnes, Richard Salmon, James Rousseau, Des Botes, and Norman Robinson.Antonio (Tone) Resende, Hajime: Karate History in a U.S. community, p31, Xlibris Corporation, 16 Sep 2013 Schmidt had been introduced to the concept of karate by his Judo instructor who gave him a karate book authored by Hidetaka Nishiyama entitled ‚ÄòKarate - The Art of Empty Hand Fighting‚Äô, whilst Schmidt was convalescing from a broken ankle. As with the other pioneers of South African karate, it was from textbooks such as this that Schmidt gained his knowledge of karate. He then began training himself at his judo dojo and there, he encouraged other judoka to join him, including Ken Wittstock, Norman Robinson and Eddie Dorey. Of those that were studying Shotokan, Schmidt was the first to realize the ambition of travelling to Japan for further training when, along with his wife Judy, he left for Tokyo in 1963 to train with the JKA. Whilst in Japan Schmidt fought the then All-Japan Grand Champion Hiroshi Shirai who had won both kata and kumite in 1962. This was despite Schmidt's then much lower rank of 7th Kyu. After this fight, the senior instructor Keinosuke Enoeda coached Schmidt privately and a few months later, before returning to South Africa from this first trip to Japan, Schmidt was graded to 3rd Kyu brown belt by Masatoshi Nakayama. Nakayama also previously invited Schmidt to train with the Instructors Class, which Schmidt dubbed 'The Hornet's Nest' due to the arduous nature of the training therein. Schmidt's visit to Japan helped forge relations with the JKA such that, in 1964, Taiji Kase visited South Africa. The next year, in 1965, Schmidt and Robinson brought four Japanese instructors to South Africa: the returning Taiji Kase; Keinosuke Enoeda; Hirokazu Kanazawa; and Hiroshi Shirai. These instructors stayed for six months from April to October 1965. Enoeda, stayed at Schmidt's house and trained him. Schmidt achieved his Shodan ('black belt') and then his Nidan (second dan) under Kase. He also went on to become the first South African karate kumite champion. Enoeda then left South Africa for the United Kingdom. In 1970, Schmidt was one of three South Africans (the others being Norman Robinson and Ronnie Renshaw) to be invited by Japan to participate in the inaugural Karate World ChampionshipsSouth African Scope, Published 1970, digitized 16 Dec 2010 at which they competed for Japan. In the late 1980s, when Schmidt was training for his 7th Dan in Japan he spent time under the teaching of Tetsuhiko Asai. He went on to become the first non- Japanese karateka to attain the level of 7th Dan from the Japan Karate Association and has remained as the highest graded westerner in that organisation latterly being awarded his 8th dan on 14 February 2015. Schmidt was the subject of an episode of SABC's People of the South, a talk show hosted by Dali Tambo that focused on celebrating the lives of different personalities from southern Africa to promote a sense of national identity and pride by reflecting on their achievements and acclamations. The episode featuring Schmidt was during the program's initial run from 1994‚Äì2002. Retirement After retiring, Stan Schmidt moved to Melbourne, Australia. Film career Stan Schmidt appeared in a number of films as a Martial Artist including in 1976, Karate Killer and in the 1981 box office success Kill and Kill Again. Schmidt and Norman Robinson choreographed the karate fight scenes in Kill and Kill Again and featured in them as the main protagonist's companions, 'The Fly' and 'Gypsy Billy' respectively, with one commentator citing these karate action scenes as the film's only commendation.Sarah Miles Bolam & Thomas J.

It was the first major art exhibition in fiber arts or textiles. Artworks were noted for their techniques, material, scale and three-dimensionality and were referenced both to their break from and use of tradition in those areas. The history of the artists in the show were directly attributed to the Austrian Wiener Werkst√§tte and the German Bauhaus, though mention was made of other inspirations such as Pre-Columbian Peruvian weavers. Ideology The 19 December 1968 Press release by the Museum of Modern Art for the exhibition Wall Hangings states: \\"During the last 10 years, developments in weaving have caused us to revise our concepts of this craft and view the work within the context of twenty-first century art. The weavers from eight countries represented in this exhibition are not part of the fabric industry, but of the world of art. They have extended the formal possibilities of weaving, frequently using complex and unique techniques.\\" Impact The only national art world press was written by Louise Bourgeois for Craft Horizons and was negative and suggested that the work was not fine art. As craft theorist Elissa Auther states in her 2009 book String Felt & Thread: \\"Despite the awareness of the negative art world attitudes concerning media traditionally associated with the crafts, the strategy Constantine and Larsen adopted to assert fiber's art status was to introduce the new genre into the fine art world on the terms set by that world.\\" Participating Artists References Museum of Modern Art (New York City) exhibitions 1969 in art Fabric sculptures Textile arts Textile arts exhibitions ","title":"Wall Hangings (exhibition)"},{"id":"53614398","text":"Tom√© Rodrigues Mendes (born 10 June 1986), known as Tom√©, is a Portuguese professional footballer who plays for AD Castro Daire as a defender.

Desmond was politically conservative, and once refused the use of one of her works on the cover of a novel by Nadine Gordimer, stating in justification that Gordimer was \\"not a loyal South African.\\"  Career  Desmond exhibited in South Africa from 1935 until her death, initially both as a member of the South African Society of Artists and the rival New Group. She was influenced by a number of artists active at the time, including Gregoire Boonzaier and Frieda Lock, becoming well-known for paintings of farm-related and rural subjects. Initially she worked from a studio in Loop Street, Cape Town. Later she painted at her homes in Hout Bay, Wynberg, Jonkershoek, and her last home in Onderpapegaaiberg, Stellenbosch. . In 1948 she painted extensively in South West Africa (now Namibia); and in 1953 similarly in Zanzibar and Mombasa, Kenya. A South African 1961 one-cent postage stamp carried a design by Desmond and in the same year she was elected as Fellow of the International Institute of Arts and Letters. She exhibited in all three Quadrennials of South African Art between 1956 and 1964, as well as at the S√£o Paulo Biennale (graphic), Brazil in 1961. She exhibited with the Women's International Art Club and the Royal Institute of Painters, and held solo shows in Johannesburg in 1962 and Pretoria in 1970. Her works are held in the following collections: Bloemfontein: Oliewenhuis Art Gallery; Cape Town: Iziko South African National Gallery; Durban Art Gallery; East London: Ann Bryant Art Gallery; Graaff- Reinet: Hester Rupert Art Museum; Johannesburg Art Gallery; Kimberley: William Humphreys Art Gallery; Pietermaritzburg: Tatham Art Gallery; Port Elizabeth: Nelson Mandela Art Museum; Pretoria Art Museum; SABC art collection. In addition, her works were acquired by HM Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother; William Ormsby-Gore, 4th Baron Harlech; and Alfred Beit.

He served as an informant for Euro-American scholars on the culture and history of the island. Family He was born on 4 March 1867 and was of full-blood Rapa Nui descent. His father was Iovani Rano. He was raised by his grandmother (sometimes referred to as his mother) Veri  ªAmo (or Veriamo), who was born in 1830 and died in 1936 and still remembered when the islanders were able to recite the Rongorongo script. Originally named Tepano Rano, he later adopted Juan (what he was called while he was in Chile) as a first name and used his baptismal name Tepano (Stephen) as his surname. He was from the Tupahotu clan while his grandmother was of the Ureohei clan. Juan Tepano, his wife Mar√≠a ‚ÄòAifiti Engepito Ika Tetono, and their son Tepano married Mar√≠a ‚ÄòAifiti Engepito Ika Tetono, daughter of King Enrique Ika (r. 1900) and a member of the Miru clan. In Chile Tepano accompanied the last Rapa Nui King Simeon Riro KƒÅinga to Valpara√≠so in late 1898 or early 1899 to air his grievances against the Enrique Merlet company which owned much of the land with the Chilean government who had annexed Easter Island. He and two other Rapa Nui soldiers were traveling to Chile to join the Maipo Regiment of the Chilean Army. The delegation was hosted by Merlet's men Jeffries and Alfredo Rodr√≠guez at a local tavern where the king was induced to drink heavily. The king was invited to lodge with Rodr√≠guez while the soldiers went to their barracks. On the following day, they were informed that the king had been sent to a hospital and died of alcohol poisoning. Merlet claimed that the young king drank himself to death while Rapa Nui oral tradition asserts that he was poisoned on the orders of Merlet while he was at the hospital. American anthropologist Grant McCall cast doubt on his military service, noting: \\"There is a nonsense story that he served in the Maipo regiment of the Chilean army in the War of the Pacific.\\" Later life Juan Tepano sitting beside a broken moai at Ahu Tongariki By 1901, Tepano had returned to Easter Island after serving in the Chilean Army. He was appointed by Henry Percy Edmunds, the company's manager and Chile's colonial subdelegado mar√≠timo, as cacique, or village head in 1902. He would become the mediator for the indigenous community at Hanga Roa and the company's base at Mataveri. Officers of the Chilean Naval corvette Baquedano later attempted to proclaim him \\"king\\" in April 1911, but none of the islanders ‚Äì including Tepano himself ‚Äì took the ceremony seriously. Tepano served as one of the informants and translator for the English anthropologist Katherine Routledge during her 1914‚Äì1915 Mana Expedition to Easter Island. He had a grasp of pidgin English and spoke a mixture of Spanish, English, Tahitian, and Rapa Nui. Routledge tried to learn Rongorongo from Tepano and the older islanders, but Tepano later admitted he had no knowledge of it while most of the other older residents had only secondhand knowledge of the mysterious script. It was noted that he had difficulty understanding Old Rapa Nui (the uncontaminated language spoken by the older generation) as well. He also served as one of the informants for the Swiss anthropologist Alfred M√©traux, who visited the island between 1934 and 1935. Tepano died on 8 November 1947, at the age of 80.

At first it was studied in Warmblood horses, but it is also present in Thoroughbreds, and potentially in any breed with Thoroughbred ancestry or outcrossing such as Quarter Horses, Standardbreds, and Morgans. It is autosomal recessive, so both sire and dam must be carriers for a foal to be affected. Foals with WFFS are naturally aborted, stillborn, or euthanized. WFFS is a genetic defect of connective tissue and foals born with it have hyper-extendible, abnormally thin, fragile skin that rips easily (similar to epidermolysis bullosa in humans). It is associated with mutations in the gene coding for Lysyl hydroxylase 1 that result in a non functional enzyme. A genetic test for Warmblood Fragile Foal Syndrome Type 1 was made commercially available in 2013. Approximately 9‚Äì11% of Warmblood horses are carriers, and a lower carrier frequency in Thoroughbreds and Knabstruppers. Horses heterogynous for WFFS are phenotypically normal, so genetic testing is necessary to prevent breeding carriers.

Although neither of her parents had a background in visual art, she showed an early interest and began taking art classes in a local storefront, deciding by her freshman year of high school that she wanted to attend art school. Guidi enrolled at Boston University, where she received a formal education in painting and printmaking that privileged traditional techniques and representations of the human body. As a result, Guidi primarily painted portraits, both of herself and of friends. After receiving her BFA in 1994, Guidi earned an MFA from the School of the Art Institute of Chicago in 1998 and relocated to Los Angeles in 2001.Gebremedhin, Thomas, ‚ÄúDifferent Strokes,‚Äù WSJ, Art Talk, September 2017, pp.136-137.

The exhibition consisted of large-scale sand and acrylic paintings, which were painted in the seven colors of the light spectrum and occupied the frescoed interior walls of the neoclassical Italian villa. Methodically-produced meditations on light and color, Guidi's most recent paintings feature mandala-like compositions and have been compared to the works of Agnes Martin, Georgia O‚ÄôKeeffe, and the Light and Space artists.

Biography  Ng was born in China and raised in Hong Kong. Ng got her first name, which means ascension, from an Italian priest when she was baptized. In 1971 at age 19, she immigrated to the United States from Hong Kong to attend the University of Washington (UW). Ng wanted to relocate to the U.S. because her parents had low expectations for daughters and Ng did not want to become a housewife, which was what was modeled to her as she was growing up. At that time, she had the perception that only in America could a woman be free. After the first year, Ng supported herself for the rest of her college education. Her first job was as a dishwasher in a school cafeteria, and it paid $2.50 an hour. Ng also baby-sat and worked in restaurants to keep afloat. She wrote for the Daily newspaper while at the UW, and she earned a bachelor's degree in international studies and education from the UW in 1974, a teaching certificate in 1976, and a master's degree in communications in 1979. Post-college, Ng taught social studies to children of immigrant families at Mercer Junior High School. She observed that many were lost in a strange new system. It was during this time that she became aware of the lack of information available to the local Chinese community. In 1982, Ng started with $25,000 of her own seed money and founded the Seattle Chinese Post. A year later in 1983, Ng founded the Northwest Asian Weekly, a Pan-Asian English-language weekly. In 1986, Ng was one of 15 women who joined the Seattle chapter of Rotary International, before the parent organization allowed women to join. In 1996, Ng founded Women of Color Empowered, a tri-annual networking luncheon series that honors women of color who have made an impact in their local communities. Through her nonprofit, the Northwest Asian Weekly Foundation, Ng has organized programs and scholarships to help disadvantaged youth and women, and she has raised more than $3 million for various charities and scholarships for foster children, University of Washington, Washington State University, Seattle University, and Seattle Community Colleges.

She was crowned Miss South Africa 2017, and is the second Miss Universe winner from South Africa, following Margaret Gardiner who was crowned Miss Universe 1978. Early life and education Nel-Peters was born on 28 June 1995 in Sedgefield, Western Cape, to Bennie Peters and Anne-Marie Steenkamp. Her half-sister, Franje, had cerebellar agenesis, and Nel-Peters said that she was the most significant motivator in her life; Franje later died on 4 May 2019, which Nel-Peters confirmed on her Instagram. While pursuing a bachelor's degree in business management and entrepreneurship from North-West University, Nel-Peters modeled part-time for Boss Models and Vision Management Cape Town. Nel-Peters graduated from university in March 2017, a few days before winning the Miss South Africa 2017 competition. She is fluent in both English and Afrikaans. Pageantry =Miss South Africa 2017= Nel-Peters began her pageantry career representing Western Cape in the Miss South Africa 2017 competition on March 26, 2017, which she won. As Miss South Africa, she had the right to represent South Africa in both Miss World 2017 and Miss Universe 2017, but since the dates of the two pageants coincided, she was sent only to Miss Universe, held in Las Vegas, Nevada. =Miss Universe 2017= In the final round Steve Harvey asked Nel-Peters, \\"What quality in yourself are you most proud of and how will you apply that quality to your time as Miss Universe?\\" She said: > As Miss Universe you have to be confident in who you are as an individual. > And Miss Universe is a woman that has overcome many fears and by that she is > able to help other women to overcome their fears. She is a woman that > nothing is ever too much to ask for and I think that is exactly who I am. When asked about what she thought was the most important issue regarding women in the workplace, she said: She went on to win the competition and was crowned Miss Universe 2017 by outgoing titleholder Iris Mittenaere. Nel-Peters is the second titleholder from South Africa; Margaret Gardiner won Miss Universe 1978. Nel-Peters said during a segment at Miss Universe that she wants to use her self-defence workshops to help as many women as she can. This stems from an incident a month after she was crowned Miss South Africa, when she was carjacked at Hyde Park. She handed over her car keys but was forced into her car by the carjackers. She punched one of them in the throat and managed to run away and get help. In her capacity as Miss Universe, Nel-Peters visited the Philippines (twice), Indonesia (twice), Thailand (twice), France, Mexico (twice), Ecuador, India, Lebanon, Egypt, Malaysia, various cities in the United States, and her home country, South Africa. Nel-Peters ended her reign on December 17, 2018 in Bangkok, Thailand, the host nation of the 2018 Miss Universe pageant. She eventually crowned Catriona Gray of the Philippines as her successor. Personal life During her reign as Miss Universe 2017, Nel- Peters began dating Tim Tebow, a former professional American football quarterback and current professional baseball outfielder for the New York Mets minor league affiliates. She celebrated her first American Thanksgiving with his family at their home. During her farewell at Miss Universe 2018, Nel- Peters thanked Tebow for his support. Nel-Peters and Tebow became engaged on January 9, 2019 at Tebow's family farm in Jacksonville, Florida. They married on January 20, 2020 in Franschhoek, South Africa, about an hour outside of Cape Town. Like Tebow, she is a Christian.

Moritomo Gakuen began as a kindergarten (preschool) operated by Yasunori Kagoike. Kagoike implemented a nationalist curriculum at the school which included daily recitations of the Imperial Rescript on Education, a practice employed at schools in the Empire of Japan from 1890 to 1945.  Elementary school scandal  Kagoike sought to expand the kindergarten into a full-fledged Japanese elementary school and applied to buy a parcel of government-owned real estate in 2013, but was turned down as he could not pay a satisfactory price to the government. In May 2015, he was able to negotiate a 10-year lease for the property provided that the school purchase the property in ten years. The school named Akie Abe as honorary principal of the elementary school, Mizuho no Kuni. On February 9, 2017, the scandal began when Asahi Shimbun reported that the central government of Japan had sold the property in Toyonaka, Osaka Prefecture, to Moritomo Gakuen for around ¬•134 million, about 14% of the land's estimated value. The Ministry of Finance explained that industrial waste (including concrete, wood and plastic) was found on the site and the reduction in the price of the land was to compensate for the estimated cost of cleaning up the waste, approximately ¬•819 million, that the school was to bear. The amount of the discount is the major issue in the scandal. How the ministry calculated the cost is not clear. Separately the government paid the school ¬•131.76 million to help decontaminate the land, reducing what the government earned to only about ¬•2 million. In Diet hearings later that month, the Ministry of Finance explained that all records of the transaction had been destroyed, other than the contract itself, in compliance with government document retention laws which allowed the documents to be designated for retention for less than one year. As the scandal unfolded, Abe resigned from her position as honorary principal in late February. Prior to her resignation, Moritomo Gakuen removed a message from Akie endorsing the school, praising its nationalistic moral education program. Osaka prosecutors eventually suspected that Kagoike and his wife had falsified the numbers of teachers and students at the school, and the expected construction costs, when applying for state subsidies. Kagoike and his wife were arrested in July on charges of fraud. Former Meiji University law professor Lawrence Repeta argued that the scandal was a factor in the timing of the 2017 general election called by Abe.  Day care center scandal  Osaka City filed suit against Moritomo Gakuen in 2017, demanding the return of over 61 million yen of subsidies improperly received in connection with the Koto Moritomo Gakuen day care center in Yodogawa Ward.  Bankruptcy  Moritomo Gakuen filed for civil rehabilitation (bankruptcy restructuring) proceedings in October 2017, seeking to write off around 97% of its approximately 3 billion yen debt burden.

It is found in Iraq, Syria and southeastern Turkey. It has yellow or cream flowers which have purple veining, a purple signal patch and a yellow beard. It has a known variety from Turkey called I. nectarifera var. mardinensis. Description I. nectarifera has a stout rhizome with long stolons. British Iris Society It has 6-8 leaves which are wide and falcate (sickle-shaped). Over all the plant can grow up to tall, with flowers blooming in April. They are in diameter and flushed purple on a white or yellowish base. The flowers are similar in form to Iris sari (from Turkey) but Iris nectarifera has more characteristic stoloniferous roots and the flowers are also similar in form to Iris heylandiana from Northern Iraq. Like other irises, the flowers have 2 pairs of petals, 3 large sepals (outer petals), known as the 'falls' and 3 inner, smaller petals (or tepals, known as the 'standards'. The standards are paler in colour than the falls. The standards are obovate shaped, slightly purple veined, long and wide. The falls are lanceolate or narrowly elliptic shaped, long and wide. They are heavily veined with brownish-maroon or deep purple signal patch, in the middle with a narrow strip of yellow hairs about 0.8 cm wide, (or beard). It has a nectary on each side of the base of the falls and long, style arms with erect to recurved lobes, The perianth tube is cm long. It has a green bract (modified leaf) and bracteole which is long. After the plant has flowered, it produces a fruit/seed capsule which is long, which is fusiform shaped and contains long seeds which are rugose (wrinkled) with a large aril (coating). =Biochemistry= As most irises are diploid, meaning having two sets of chromosomes. This can be used to identify hybrids and classification of groupings. It's chromosomes have not yet been counted. Taxonomy I. nectarifera is known as 'Ballƒ± kurtkulaƒüƒ±' in Turkish. It was first published and described by Adil G√ºner in 'Notes Roy. Bot. Gard. Edinburgh' (Notes from the Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh) Vol.38 on page 413 in 1980. It is an RHS accepted name and was last-listed in the RHS Plant Finder in 2009. There is a known variety called I. nectarifera var. mardinensis Guner which has thinner leaves than I. nectarifera var. nectarifera, which are 0.8-0.9 cm wide and it has a perianth tube which is 2.0-2.5 cm long. It was found in Turkey and also published and described by Guner in Notes Roy. Bot. Gard. Edinburgh 38(3): 413 (1980). The specific epithet mardinensis refers to the Turkish city of Mardin in Turkish Kurdistan. Distribution and habitat It is native to temperate Western Asia. =Range= It is found in mainly in Turkey, but also in Syria and Iraq. =Habitat= It grows on terra rossa (soil) on the steppes. Cultivation In cultivation, its growing requirement are similar to the nearby found Iris gatesii (from the mountains of Turkey and Iraq). =Propagation= Irises can generally be propagated by division, or by seed growing. Toxicity Like many other irises, most parts of the plant are poisonous (rhizome and leaves), if mistakenly ingested, it can cause stomach pains and vomiting. Also handling the plant may cause a skin irritation or an allergic reaction.David G Spoerke and Susan C. Smolinske  References  * Mathew, B. 1981.

The BookTube community has, to date, reached hundreds of thousands of viewers worldwide. While the majority of BookTubers focus on Young Adult literature, many address other genres. BookTube videos also generally follow a set of formats, often drawing upon the wider \\"bookish\\" culture and lexicon. There is a distinct set of recognizable faces within BookTube, as well as some content created by the publishing community. BookTube is often used to advertise new publications and is cited as a source of growth for the publishing industry.  Background  Though it lacks an exact origin, the BookTube community began around 2010 and has grown exponentially in recent years. Today, many channels have thousands (and sometimes hundreds of thousands) of subscribers. BookTube channels exist globally in English, Italian, French, and Spanish, among other languages. BookTubers often create videos reviewing and discussing Young Adult Literature, but other genres, such as classics, science fiction, fantasy, literary fiction, children's literature, comics, romance, and non-fiction, are also represented. Currently, Christine Riccio (PolandBananasBooks) is the most subscribed BookTuber with over 400,000 subscribers. Other notable figures include Jesse George (Jesse the Reader), Cindy Pham (readwithcindy), and Kat O'Keefe (katytastic).  BookTube and the publishing industry  The BookTube community has been noted by social media consultants as a potential source of revenue growth for publishing houses. Publishers themselves began to break into the Booktube community around 2009. Since then, they have advertised using book trailers, contracts with existing Booktubers, and their own BookTube web series, such as PaperCuts or Book Studio 16. Still, publishers often utilize independent Booktubers to advertise their books through word of mouth, usually by providing ARCs (Advanced Reader Copies). Often these ARCs will be shipped with other swag designed to increase the hype surrounding the release. Most of these ARCs are sent from the \\"Big Five\\" publishers: Hachette, Harper-Collins, MacMillan, Penguin Random House, and Simon-Schuster. This means that one book will often be reviewed many times by the BookTube community.  Types of videos  There are several different types of videos that BookTubers film. Some are reviews, with or without spoilers, which detail what Booktubers liked or disliked about specific books. Booktubers often review Advanced Reader Copies (ARCs) that are provided by book publishers who may wish to advertise using word of mouth. BookTubers also make haul videos where they discuss their purchases from a trip to the bookstore or give an overview of the books that they've bought within a period of time. Conversely, unhaul videos are videos where BookTubers talk about any books that they are removing from their collection.Booktuber Juli Ferraro interviews 301x301px Other common types of videos include: * Bookshelf tours, in which BookTubers show the viewer their bookshelves, usually describing each book as they go along. * Readalongs, in which BookTubers choose a book and encourage their audience to follow along. * TBR (to be read) videos, in which BookTubers list what they intend to read in the immediate future. * Wrap-up videos, which list books the BookTuber has read in a particular period of time, typically a week, month, or year. * Tag videos, which consist of a series of questions or challenges around a theme which the BookTuber answers, then tags other BookTubers to answer. * Discussion videos, which address themes across books or issues that arise in the BookTube community. * Collaborations, in which two or more booktubers will join in a video, often playing a game or doing a tag. * Interviews with authors.  Traditions and culture  BookTube, rather than a collection of disparate videos, is often considered a community of video makers and watchers with its own culture. There is a shared vocabulary (largely drawn from the wider bookish community), intertextuality (whereby BookTubers react and respond to other BookTubers), common traditions, and some broadly shared values.A classic rainbow shelfie is a staple of the bookish community, and is also a favorite BookTube backdrop. = Vocabulary = *Bookternet: the network of book and reading related internet enclaves, including book bloggers, book podcasts, BookTube, Bookstagram, goodreads, and Reblog Bookclub * TBR : to be read. These books can be: the next book a BookTuber will read, all unread books owned by a BookTuber, or books, not necessarily owned, that a BookTuber wants to read. * DNF : did not finish. A book that a BookTuber chose to not complete *Shelfie: a \\"selfie\\", or picture, of a bookshelf. Usually shelfies are specifically organized in some theme. *ARC : advanced reader copy. A not-for-sale copy of a yet-to-be-published book provided free by the publisher for publicity purposes. The aim of these is to promote a book through word of mouth prior to release. *Reading Slump: a period of time in which a BookTuber lacks the inspiration to read, or when reading is much slower than usual *Ship, Shipping: to support/endorse a relationship between fictional characters = Traditions = *Readathon: an event during which participants read together over a defined period of time. *Shout outs in which BookTubers recommend other BookTube channels in their videos. *NaNoWriMo: Many BookTubers, who are also avid writers, tend to participate in this challenge during which one attempts to write a 50,000 word novel in the month of November. *Read-alongs are when a Booktuber will read a certain amount of a book per week so that viewers can follow along and add discussion. Much of BookTube and its culture overlaps with the broader YouTube writing community. It's common for BookTubers to also be writers, and their videos can include writing advice or author logs. Individual BookTubers have had an impact on the community as they write, publish, and promote their own books on their channel. Outside of YouTube, BookTubers can be found at book and YouTube conventions like YallFest, BookCon, and VidCon.

In 1972 he co-founded Environmental Traveling Companions (E.T.C.) to offer environmental education and Outward Bound-type trips to disabled persons and disadvantaged youth. In 1973, he co- founded Friends of the River to fight the flooding of the Stanislaus River and canyon by the New Melones Dam. He reached national fame when he chained himself to a rock on the banks of the river to prevent the flooding of the river. He also co-founded International Rivers in 1984, and served as the International Coordinator of Earth Day 1990 and 2000. His personal papers from these organizations and other work from 1970‚Äì2002 are held by the Bancroft Library at the University of California, Berkeley. Biography =Early life= Mark Dubois was born in Sacramento February 24, 1949, and in his teen and adult years rafted and explored the Stanislaus River canyon. Being a canyon made of limestone, exploring caves was a significant part of his initial experiences there. At the time, he was only dimly aware that the US Army Corps of Engineers was working on a dam that would eventually flood the river canyon he was falling in love with. = Environmental Traveling Companions (ETC) = In 1972, Dubois co-founded (with Fred Dennis) Environmental Traveling Companions (ETC or \\"etcetera\\") to introduce inner city kids to nature through rafting. The organization continues today with the same mission. = Friends of the River = Friends of the River was born in 1973 from the effort to put an initiative on the California ballot to save the river, led by Jerry Meral and Mark Dubois, among others. Although the initiative failed, the act of working to pass it brought together enough individual effort to create the foundation of an organization (some 30,000 volunteers gathered half a million signatures to qualify the initiative). By 1980 FOR had 3,000 members. = International Rivers Network = In 1984, Dubois co-founded the International Rivers Network (now called \\"International Rivers\\") after a year-long trip around the world. The group aims to encourage grassroots organizing against large dam projects, and redirecting international funding away from such projects. = Earth Day 1990 = Dubois and Teresa McGlashan were the International Coordinators for Earth Day‚Äôs global efforts, coordinating with grassroots groups along with some government and business organizations in the 143 participating countries outside the US. An estimated 200 million citizens participated in Earth Day and Earth Week events around the world. 200 million people in 140 countries participated in the even that year. Philosophical and/or political views Dubois advocates ‚Äúheart politics.‚Äù Similar to Gandhi‚Äôs appeal to our better nature, Dubois notes that individuals respond better to encouragement and appeals to their conscience. He tries to help transform anger into constructive action, and believes that by having fun doing it means that success is more likely.  Honors, decorations, awards and distinctions  Dubois gained national attention when he chained himself to a rock beside the rising reservoir behind New Melones Dam in May 1979 to force the Army Corps of Engineers to stop the filling or kill him.

At that time, Neuralink announced that it was working on a \\"sewing machine-like\\" device capable of implanting very thin (4 to 6 Œºm in width) threads into the brain, and demonstrated a system that read information from a lab rat via 1,500 electrodes, anticipating to start experiments with humans in 2020. Overview The Pioneer Building in San Francisco, housing the offices of Neuralink and OpenAI Neuralink was founded in 2016 by Elon Musk, Ben Rapoport, Dongjin Seo, Max Hodak, Paul Merolla, Philip Sabes, Tim Gardner, Tim Hanson, and Vanessa Tolosa. In April 2017, the blog Wait But Why reported that the company was aiming to make devices to treat serious brain diseases in the short-term, with the eventual goal of human enhancement, sometimes called transhumanism. Musk said his interest in the idea partly stemmed from the science fiction concept of \\"neural lace\\" in the fictional universe in The Culture, a series of 10 novels by Iain M. Banks. Musk defined the neural lace as a \\"digital layer above the cortex\\" that would not necessarily imply extensive surgical insertion but ideally an implant through a vein or artery.Elon Musk thinks we will have to use AI this way to avoid a catastrophic future .

Atkins, in his 2001 book, Class Act (co-authored with Jacqui Malone), stated that, Against the backdrop of dance teams working in the blackface tradition, Atkins was one in a long list of virtuoso black male dance artists who rejected the minstrel show stereotypes of the grinning-and-dancing clowns lazy, incompetent fools and dandies who thought only of flashy clothes, flirtatious courting, new dances, and good looks.

It is a ground orchid with a single densely hairy leaf and a single pale green flower with red stripes along the sepals and petals. It is a poorly known species and there is insufficient information about its distribution and abundance to determine whether or not it is endangered. Description Caladenia villosissima is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb with an underground tuber and a single densely hairy leaf, 60‚Äì140 mm long and 6‚Äì9 mm wide, often with red blotches near its base. A single greenish flower with red stripes and 35‚Äì45 mm wide is borne on a thick, hairy spike 100‚Äì230 mm high. The sepals and petals have thick, yellowish, club-like glandular tips, 9‚Äì12 mm long on the sepals and 3‚Äì4 mm long on the petals. The dorsal sepal is erect, 30‚Äì45 mm long and about 3 mm wide. The lateral sepals are 28‚Äì40 mm long and about 4 mm wide and parallel to each other, held horizontally or turned slightly downwards. The petals are 20‚Äì25 mm long, about 2 mm wide and arranged like the lateral sepals. The labellum is pale green and white, 12‚Äì15 mm long, 13‚Äì16 mm wide with a red tip. The sides of the labellum have thin green teeth up to 3 mm long, the tip is curved downwards and there are four rows of dark red calli up to about 3 mm long, along its mid-line. Flowering occurs in September and October. Taxonomy and naming This orchid was first formally described in 1991 by Geoffrey Carr who gave it the name Caladenia dilatata var. villosissima. The type specimen was collected near Stawell and the description was published in Indigenous Flora and Fauna Association Miscellaneous Paper 1. In 2001, David Jones and others raised it to species status, giving the name Arachnorchis villosissima and 2004 Stephen Hopper and Andrew Brown revised the name to Caladenia villosissima. The specific epithet (villosissima) is the superlative form of the Latin word villosus meaning \\"hairy\\" (hence \\"hairiest\\"). Distribution and habitat The hairy spider orchid is only known from near Stawell where it grows in river red gum forest among grasses.

She played a key role in the Hindmarsh Bridge controversy and made many contributions to Indigenous activism. Early life Kartinyeri was born on 3 February 1935, in the Aboriginal reserve at Point MacLeay (now Raukkan) in South Australia, to parents Thelma Kartinyeri and Oswald (Oscar) Kartinyeri. She had two sisters, Doris and Nancy, and one brother, Ron. However, Doris was the only sibling with whom Kartinyeri maintained contact, as Ron was in prison and Nancy died on the operating table when having a tonsillectomy. Kartinyeri struggled with authority for most of her life, beginning when she was a child, after her mother died. Kartinyeri and her newborn sister, Doris, were placed in different childcare institutions. In an interview on ABC radio in 2007, Kartinyeri discussed this experience, saying: ‚ÄúI said I want to know where Doris is, what did you do with her, she's not in the home, someone took her. I didn't really know where she was, we didn't, I was only 13, just turned 13‚Äù. As the interview continued, Kartinyeri continued to reveal her passionate, stubborn and argumentative nature, describing herself as ‚Äúa fiery girl who talked too much‚Äù. She mentioned a particular time when she was trying to see her sister, Doris. ‚ÄúAll right,‚Äù Kartinyeri said, ‚Äúso I just kicked my shoes off, climbed the top of the wall, and said, ‚Äòif you don't tell me I'm going to jump,‚Äô so she told me where Doris was\\". =Education= Kartinyeri‚Äôs education began in her hometown, at the Raukkan Mission School. Kartinyeri said that she did not like her teacher at this school because he was ‚Äútoo strict‚Äù. After the death of her mother, Kartinyeri was, unwillingly, moved to the Salvation Army Home in Fullarton, on the condition that she would stay with her sister, Doris. Coincidentally, this was a lie - Doris did not go with Kartinyeri to Fullarton, but was instead sent to the Colebrook Home at Eden Hills.Kick the Tin by Doris Kartinyeri ABC Radio National, 3 September 2007. Retrieved 15 July 2018. Kartinyeri said that the conditions of this institution were ‚Äúmilitary style‚Äù, claiming that she was beaten on her first night for swearing. Kartinyeri did not do well in school - she was rebellious, was punished often, performed poorly, often did not do work, and when she did, teachers accused her of cheating. During her time at school, Kartinyeri found enjoyment in going to the pool and seeing boys. Often Kartinyeri would get into mischief with the other nunga (Aboriginal) girls, and Kartinyeri claimed that they were often the scapegoats for the white girls (herself especially). Later on, Kartinyeri was expelled for getting into a fight with girls who were bullying a disabled girl. From there, she never continued her formal education but she did go on to win many honorary academic awards and has since received much praise for her academic work. =Domestic Employment= After being expelled from Fullarton in 1949, Kartinyeri believed she was being sent back home to Raukkan; however, to her surprise she was sent to Joan and George Dunn's house in the Adelaide Hills to work as a domestic servant for the next two years. After the initial shock had subdued, Kartinyeri settled well into life at Adelaide Hills and came to love and respect Joan and George. After her two years with the Dunns were complete, Kartinyeri was offered another position, working for the Motterams, who lived in the Adelaide suburb of Kings Park. Having known the Motterams as friends of the Dunns and liking them, she accepted the job. While working there, Kartinyeri did few physical or taxing tasks, describing her main purpose as keeping Mrs Motterham company which was easy because she had a ‚Äúgood sense of humour and was very easy going.‚Äù At the age of 15, Kartinyeri returned to Raukkan to care for her sick grandmother. She took up a position as a domestic servant for the superintendent of the mission, where her small wages went to supporting her grandparents who weren't entitled to a pension because of their indigenous status. At the age of 16, Kartinyeri had her first experience as a full-time foster mother, taking care of her cousins and her cousin's children. Finding motherhood exhausting, Kartinyeri went back to working domestically, taking a job at the Maitland Hotel. Deciding that caring for grandmother back home was too stressful, Kartinyeri left Raukkan and took up work sorting grapes at Barmera. Hindmarsh Bridge Doreen played a significant and controversial role in the Hindmarsh Island Bridge Affair in the 1990s. All of her prior research sparked her passionate and argumentative side in 1993, when the South Australian State Government put forward a proposal to build a bridge between Hindmarsh Island and Goolwa. Doreen quickly became a key figure in the movement against this proposal, saying that Hindmarsh Island was sacred land, particularly for Indigenous women, for reasons which her and her group would not disclose. In early 1994, Doreen's group were successful in their application to the Federal Government to gain a heritage order to prohibit the bridge being built. However, in 1995, the Royal Commission conducted an investigation into Doreen's movement and concluded that their ‚Äúindigenous women‚Äù argument was fabricated. In addition, several Ngarrindjeri (the women native to Hindmarsh Island), said that they knew nothing of the spiritual importance that Doreen was talking about. Furthermore, in March 1996, the Howard Government re- approved the plans for the bridge and in the year 2000, it was built. During this time, there was much debate and discussion as to whether Doreen and her group were telling the truth or not. Doreen always maintained her passion and that what she was saying was true and as a result, she bore the brunt of the criticism and debate. Finally, in 2010, the South Australian government recognised the honesty of Doreen and her group, formally acknowledging that \\"women members of the Ngarrindjeri traditional owners were genuine in the mid-1990s when they said that the construction of the bridge would violate their most sacred beliefs.\\" Years later, in an interview on ABC radio with Mike Sexton in 2007, Doreen described her position on this ordeal, saying: \\"If I was a destructive person I would have went and blown it up, and that's the truth. I would have went and blown it up, but I hate destroying things.\\" Mike Sexton went on to say that \\"She was defiant to the end. A decade after the phrase 'secret women's business' entered the Australian vernacular, Doreen Kartinyeri maintained her rage against the bridge at Hindmarsh Island.\\" Family =Relationship with parents= Her mother Thelma Kartinyeri was classified as a 'quarter caste' Aboriginal woman. She was highly religious and wove baskets, knitted, crocheted and made clothes out of rags. Thelma continued to help people and soon became a member of the Red Cross where she cooked food and sent it to needy families. Her youngest daughter died on the operating table whilst she was getting her tonsils taken out. Soon after this occurred, she had another daughter named Doris. Thelma died within a month of giving birth, due to complications following the birth. Doreen was only ten at the time, and had described the early death as one of the most traumatic experiences of her life. Both mother and father had spent their days at Raukkan. Under the official classificatory system, Oswald (Oscar) Kartinyeri was considered as a 'full blood' Aboriginal. After the death of Thelma, the police took custody of Doris. He was described to be 'beside himself'. Doreen recalled her father travelling to Victoria to search for her. She also claimed that when he finally returned he was tired and dirty. As he grew old, Doreen and Terry had brought him up to live with them in Point Pearce. Oscar died in 1979 of a heart attack. =Marriage= Doreen married and had children with Terry Wanganeen, first meeting at Pearce Point when Doreen was visiting her Aunt Rose. Doreen became pregnant in 1954, leading to the decision for her and Terry to get married and move to Point Pearce together. Her relationship with Terry, who was heavily reliant on alcohol, and very violent and abusive when under the influence, was unstable. Both parties were hostile to one another, and their marriage was often unhappy. There was one particular instance when Terry threw a leg of lamb at the door because it was under-cooked, causing Doreen to become so angry that she broke a glass bottle and stabbed him in retaliation. Upon arrival to the hospital, authorities gave Doreen two choices for her consequence: she could either plead guilty to attempted murder or spend six weeks in a psychiatric hospital. She chose to be admitted into psychiatric care. When she returned, Terry's attitude had drastically changed. However, Doreen still came to the conclusion that their marriage was effectively over, and she moved to Adelaide. =Children= Doreen became a full-time foster mother for her cousins at the age of 16. She also took care of her cousins‚Äô children whilst she was pregnant. She described this experience as exhausting. She fell pregnant in 1954 and gave birth to a boy later that year in December. Her baby had died from an unknown illness at 7 months. She described his death as ‚Äúone of the most traumatic experiences‚Äù in her life, the other being the early death of her mother. During baby Terry's death, she fell pregnant again. Due to the death of her first born, she was terrified at the loss of another baby, so she considered inducing a miscarriage. From 1955 to 1699, she had given birth to six more sons and two daughters. She described the birth of her children as the ‚Äúbest thing that ever happened‚Äù. Projects She was living in Point Pierce with her family when she started to examine the histories and genealogies of the indigenous people in the Point Pierce and Point MacLeay area (and she discovered that most Aboriginals in this area were lost during colonisation. From this research, Doreen went on to write and successfully publish several books on the Indigenous people of this area, which led to her being awarded an honorary doctorate from the University of Adelaide and given a job offer from the South Australian museum in their Aboriginal Family History Unit. Awards In 1994, Doreen was named the South Australian Aboriginal of Year, and a year later she was awarded an Honorary Doctorate from the University of South Australia in recognition of her genealogical work. Death Kartinyeri died in the early morning hours of 2 December 2007, after battling stomach cancer and other illnesses. She was 72.

Sicherungs-Division), initially known as the 213th Infantry Division (213. Infanterie-Division), was a rear-security division in the Wehrmacht of Nazi Germany. The unit was deployed in German- occupied areas of the Soviet Union, in the Army Group South Rear Area. Operational history The 213th Infantry Division was formed on 26 August 1939 as part of the third Aufstellungswelle. It was raised in the 8th military district (Silesia) and initially consisted of the Artillery Regiment 213 as well as the Infantry Regiments 318, 354 and 406. Its recruits hailed from the Breslau area. The division's initial commander was Rene de l‚ÄôHomme de Courbiere. During the Invasion of Poland, the 213th Infantry Division served in the reserves of Army Group South (Gerd von Rundstedt). It did not play a significant role in the Poland campaign. After the campaign, the division served under XXXV Army Corps. In June 1940, the 213th Infantry Division was moved to the 7th Army in the Upper Rhine area, but did not see action in the Battle of France. It was sent on vacation to its home military district in July 1940. It was not reactivated as an infantry division, and instead prepared to be reformed into the 213th, 286th and 403rd Security Divisions starting in March 1941. The 213th Security Division was formed on 15 March 1941 in the Neuhammer area, prior the German invasion of the Soviet Union, Operation Barbarossa. Courbiere was replaced as the divisional commander by Alexander Goeschen on 18 August 1942. This would remain the division's only replacement of the commander, as Goeschen held command until the division's dissolution. The division operated in the occupied Ukraine and Southern Russia regions behind Army Group South's front lines. The division's duties included security of communications and supply lines, economic exploitation and combatting irregular fighters (partisans) in the Wehrmacht's rear areas. Along with other security and police forces in the occupied territories, the division participated in war crimes against prisoners of war and the civilian population. The division was subordinated to Karl von Roques, commander of Army Group South Rear Area. Similar to 454th Security Division, it coordinated its actions with Friedrich Jeckeln, the Higher SS and Police Leader for Army Group South.

She is a seminal figure in Australian \\"grunge fiction\\" or \\"dirty realism\\" literature of the mid-1990s and was labelled 'The Empress of Grunge'. Her second published novel is Marilyn's Almost Terminal New York Adventure (1996) but technically it is her first novel as she wrote Marilyn's Almost Terminal New York Adventure novel before she wrote The River Ophelia. She has also worked as a literary reviewer for newspapers such as The Observer, The Sydney Morning Herald, a teacher, and academic. The River Ophelia caught the public's attention due to its striking cover of a nude woman in black and white photography and the marketing of the book was widely discussed in literary circles. All of the major Australian newspapers like The Australian, The Sydney Morning Herald, and The Age featured prominent reviews and Ettler herself soon became 'news' and she appeared on television and was even interviewed by popular magazines like Who Weekly. Over 50,000 copies of the novel were sold in a market where 5,000 is considered a best-seller. The novel has also attracted significant scholarly attention with the novel now recognised as a significant \\"grunge\\" text (although that term and that genre are contested) and a notable example of a feminist text featuring erotic (some would say 'pornographic') content and this has been widely debated in literary circles with particular reference to the concept of abject bodies and abjection. Ettler herself describes the novel as a 'postmodern parody' rather than 'grunge'. In October 2017, Ettler re-released The River Ophelia in e-book format with an Author's Note and an Introduction analyzing the original reception of the novel. In April 2018, Ettler had a new novel published in May 2018 named Bohemia Beach (Transit Lounge, 2018). Early life and education Etter was born in Sydney to parents with Czech roots who worked in the hospitality industry. She grew up in Woollahra, New South Wales. Her mother and father operated a restaurant on Bondi Road, which they sold to the parents of Julia Zemiro in 1971. Ettler attended Woollahra Demonstration School, now known as Woollahra Public School, and the selective Sydney Girls High School in Moore Park, where classmates included fellow writer Hilary Bell, daughter of Bell Shakespeare founder John Bell. She was surrounded by artists and writers, commenting: \\"I sometimes think maybe if I had grown up in another part of Sydney and hadn‚Äôt been surrounded by that culture I wouldn‚Äôt have become a writer\\". She graduated from Sydney University of Technology (now University of Technology, Sydney) and she has a BA, MA, and PhD in literary studies from the Department of English, University of Sydney. Her PhD examined the Bret Easton Ellis novel, American Psycho (1991).

She discovered that selenium is required by the metabolism of coliform bacteria and described a new species of sulphur bacterium in the genus Chloroherpeton. She became Professor at Cornell University in 1979 and was editor of the scientific journal Applied and Environmental Microbiology. Early life Born Audrey Jane Pinsent on 5 October 1924 in Paris, her father was Gerald Hume Saverie Pinsent (1888‚Äì1976), later to become comptroller-general of the UK National Debt Office. Her mother was Katharine Kentisbeare (1884‚Äì1949), daughter of the Liberal MP, Sir George Radford. Her early years were spent in both Switzerland and in Devon. She was educated at The Maynard School in Exeter and, in 1946, obtained a first-class honours degree in biochemistry at Newnham College, Cambridge under the supervision of biochemist, Marjory Stephenson. In 1949 she obtained a PhD in microbiology at the Lister Institute of the University of London. Career and achievements Whilst based at the Lister Institute in 1954, Gibson published her discovery that the trace elements selenium (which was previously believed only to be toxic) and molybdenum are essential requirements for bacterial growth, specifically the production of formate dehydrogenase in coliform bacteria (e.g. Escherichia coli). Following receipt of a postgraduate fellowship from the Commonwealth Fund, Gibson then spent a year working with C. B. van Niel at the Hopkins Marine Station of Stanford University in California where she developed an interest in photosynthetic bacteria. On her return to Britain she took up a post at Professor Sidney Elsden's microbiology laboratory at the University of Sheffield. Her work there involved characterising c-type cytochromes from photosynthetic bacteria. Whilst at the University of Sheffield, Audrey Jane Pinsent met her future husband, biochemist Quentin Gibson, in 1951. They married, started a family, and eventually had four children. Jane Gibson continued working part-time whilst raising her family. In 1963 they emigrated to the United States, where she took up positions, first at the University of Pennsylvania and then, three years later, at the Section of Microbiology at Cornell University where, in 1970, she was made an associate professor. Her research focused on the transport and utilisation of ammonia and other small organic compounds by the main groups of phototrophic bacteria, and she became expert in their care and culture. Gibson also studied the growth of cyanobacteria, co-authoring a paper that demonstrated the close evolutionary relationship that many gram-negative bacteria such as E. coli have with purple photosynthetic bacteria. She was made a full professor in 1979 and in 1994 she won the Edith Edgerton Career Teaching Award. Gibson's research predominantly focused on green photosynthetic bacteria. In 1984 she described a new species of sulphur bacterium, Chloroherpeton thalassium, isolated from marine sediments found at Woods Hole, Massachusetts. In the latter part of her career, Gibson utilised the purple non-sulfur bacterium, Rhodopseudomonas palustris, to study the anaerobic degradation of the benzene ring - a significant step in the breakdown of polluting hydrocarbons in the environment. In 1983, Gibson was appointed to the editorial board of the Journal of Bacteriology, where she served until 1991. Between 1989 and 1995 she was also editor of the scientific journal Applied and Environmental Microbiology. She was also a Fellow of the American Academy of Microbiology. Later life When Gibson's husband developed a stomach ulcer in 1969, they both decided to spend their summers at Woods Hole. In 1970, they bought a house and a sailboat and spent the next 20 years there. Jane Gibson taught microbiology courses every summer at the Marine Biological Laboratory, whilst her husband collected fish blood for his research at Cornell University. The Gibsons both retired from Cornell University in 1996, and relocated to Etna, New Hampshire. However, their winter months were spent in Houston, Texas. Her husband worked in a kinetics laboratory at Rice University, whilst Jane Gibson was employed in the microbiology department at the University of Texas Medical School. Gibson died at her home in Etna on June 10, 2008, aged 83.

The album was independently released on 21 July 2017.  Background  In March 2017, the singer informed fans through his personal Facebook page that he had plans to publish mind control to steal the soul, which was to be his third solo extended play album, on an as of then undetermined date in July of that year. The following month, Danielsen announced the release date and track listing. In late June of that year, Danielsen announced the pre-order for his album, followed by a video teaser for \\"Paralyzed\\", the first single from the EP. He worked with film director Brooks Robinson, who has filmed motion pictures such Iron Man 3, Fantastic Four, and Inception in addition to music videos for Blink 182, No Doubt, and Weezer. The music video for the single was themed around an attempt to separate one's self from a bad situation. The music video was filmed at the Sybil Brand Institute women's correctional facility in downtown Los Angeles, California. On 20 July 2017, Danielsen published the music video. Regarding the single, Danielsen stated that: :\\"The Paralyzed song and video are about escaping from something, but I‚Äôd doesn‚Äôt really spell out exactly what‚Ä¶. leaving a lot to the imagination. I think we all have things in our lives we‚Äôd like to escape, so it‚Äôs definitely a relatable theme.

In addition to painting landscapes, portraits and still lifes, Colquhoun designed and supervised the construction of stained glass windows for three of Ballarat's churches, St Andrew's Kirk, Lydiard Street Uniting Church and Mount Pleasant Methodist Church. She studied in both Melbourne and Sydney, exhibited in England and Australia and taught in the school she started with her husband in Melbourne. Biography She was born Amalie Sara Field in Murtoa, a town in the Wimmera region of Victoria, Australia to parents Alfred Francis Field, a blacksmith, and Louisa Caroline, n√©e Degenhardt, both Australian born. They moved to Ballarat in 1904 where Amalie studied drawing and design at the Ballarat Technical Art School, becoming the Art Mistress there in the mid-1920s. She was described by Harold Herbert as one of the most brilliant students to ever pass through the school. She continued to advance her career when the Victorian Education Department supported her study of pottery and stained glass at Sydney Technical College. On returning to Ballarat she started the teaching of pottery at the school. She continued her studies at the well-known Max Meldrum School in Melbourne. She also taught at Melbourne Technical College. Amalie Field married Archibald Colquhoun in 1931 and they had no children. She died on 16 June 1974 in East Melbourne and was buried in Boroondara cemetery, Kew, with Anglican rites. Career In 1927 she was appointed to the Working Men's College in Melbourne, a post which she resigned in 1933. In the same year Archibald Colquhoun started an art school in that city. Amalie Colquhoun was one of Archibald Colquhoun's students and married him in 1931. Up until the time they bought their property at Swinton in Kew, the Colquhouns lived in their Melbourne studios. Colquhoun and her husband taught for many years and had portraits, landscape paintings, and reproductions of famous sculptures displayed on the walls of the school. Colquhoun was noted for her seascapes painted from their holiday house at Lorne, Victoria. In 1937 they spent a year painting in Edinburgh and London, and exhibited jointly at the Islington Galleries, London. While there they also exhibited with the London Portrait Society. Her husband's 1948 painting of her, Amalie Colquhoun, is in the Art Gallery of New South Wales. The husband and wife frequently exhibited their work together, and were referred to as the two A's. Amalie has been commended for her ability to keep children happy while painting their pictures. She uses a puppet show controlled by her foot, with theatre built by Archie and figures made herself. In 1950 the Colquhouns closed the school, and in 1954 moved from the city to Kew, establishing a studio and occasional gallery in their home. They continued to paint intensively, particularly landscapes and seascapes reflecting their travels. > I am convinced that everyone must benefit from the study of art.

The case was an influential decision concerning the construction of Section 44(ii) of the Constitution, which held that Rod Culleton's conviction for larceny meant that he was incapable of being chosen as a Senator and the subsequent annulment of that conviction did not operate retroactively to deny the legal effect to the conviction from the time that it was recorded. Background Culleton was declared one of the elected Senator for Western Australia as the lead candidate on the Pauline Hanson's One Nation ticket during the 2016 federal election, which was held on 2 July 2016. At that time, he had been convicted in absentia on a larceny charge over a vehicle key in New South Wales, but had not yet been sentenced. =Criminal charge= In April 2014, Culleton was involved in a dispute with a tow truck driver in Guyra, New South Wales. The tow truck driver was attempting to repossess a truck and the key to the tow truck went missing. Culleton was charged with larceny in relation to the missing key. When the matter came before the local court in March 2016 Culleton was not present, saying he did not have time to travel to the Court as he was required to be in court in Western Australia the day before on unrelated larceny charges. Culleton was convicted in his absence. He successfully applied for the conviction be set aside, with the conviction being annulled on 8 August 2016. Culleton then pleaded guilty to the offence, and was ordered to pay the truck driver's costs with no conviction being recorded. =Section 44 of the Constitution= Under section 44(ii) of the Constitution, any person who \\"has been convicted and is under sentence, or subject to be sentenced, for any offence punishable under the law of the Commonwealth or of a State by imprisonment for one year or longer\\" shall (section 44 continues) \\"be incapable of being chosen or of sitting as a senator or a member of the House of Representatives\\". Disqualification. Previous time in prison was not a disqualification and there have been numerous politicians who had spent time in prison before their election. The High Court had previously observed that the disqualification is not simply for the conviction for an offence, nor serving time in prison. The disqualification required both conviction and that the person was imprisoned at the time or awaiting sentence.. The WA larceny charge did not give rise to any question of disqualification as Culleton had only been charged and had not been convicted. At the time of Culleton's nomination and election, he had been convicted for the New South Wales offence but had not been sentenced. A former colleague lodged a petition with the High Court (sitting as the Court of Disputed Returns), claiming that Culleton was not able to nominate for the election as he was convicted and awaiting sentence in New South Wales at the time of the election. Subsequently, the Australian Government asked the Senate to also refer the matter to the High Court; the reference included a request to determine what should be done if Culleton's seat were found to be vacant. The primary issues before the High Court concerned the effect of the subsequent annulment of Culleton's conviction and whether Culleton was subject to be sentenced to a term of imprisonment for one year or longer. Judgment On 3 February 2017, the High Court determined the Senate reference, unanimously finding that Culleton had been ineligible for election to the Senate. At the time of the 2016 election he was subject to being sentenced to imprisonment for up to two years, which under Constitution section 44(ii) rendered him ineligible for election. This had not been affected by the subsequent annulment of the finding of guilt; the annulment had operated only from the time of the annulment. The vacancy should be filled by a special count of the ballot papers. Any directions necessary to give effect to the conduct of the special count should be made by a single Justice. However, the Court anticipated that a simple recount, as if Culleton had not been a candidate, would make the votes cast for him (so far as they were \\"above the line\\", which was 96% of them) would flow through to the next One Nation candidate. The Court ordered, as the Commonwealth had previously agreed, that most (with specific exceptions) of Culleton's costs of the action would be borne by the Commonwealth (Culleton had initially represented himself, but eventually he had been provided with counsel). The majority stated, in an introductory summary of their judgment (with which Nettle J differed only as to reasoning):. > Senator Culleton was a person who had been convicted and was subject to be > sentenced for an offence punishable by imprisonment for one year or longer > at the date of the 2016 election. That was so, both as a matter of fact and > as a matter of law. The subsequent annulment of the conviction had no effect > on that state of affairs. It follows from s 44(ii) that Senator Culleton was > \\"incapable of being chosen\\" as a Senator. In the result, there is a vacancy > in the representation of Western Australia in the Senate for the place for > which Senator Culleton was returned. Result Culleton had been found ineligible for election to the Senate. His vacancy was filled by a countback of the ballot papers in Western Australia, on the basis that Culleton's name was not on the paper. As had been anticipated, the recount resulted in votes cast for him, including the \\"above the line\\" votes (which were 96% of his vote) flowed through to the next One Nation candidate, which was Peter Georgiou, Culleton's brother-in-law. Georgiou's election was confirmed on 10 March and he was sworn in on 27 March 2017. The government has demanded repayment by Culleton, as \\"a debt to the Commonwealth\\", of payments he had received while disqualified, and indicated it might also seek repayment of superannuation payments, other entitlements and staff payments.

When the first of the Indiana regiments were ready to take the field in the War of the Rebellion, they were not provided with ammunition and as none could be readily procured it was necessary to have it fabricated. For this task, Lieutenant Colonel Sturm was engaged. He had studied the art in Europe and was thoroughly instructed in all its details. From the very beginning, he was successful in this work and his ammunition was pronounced the very best in use. With the demands of the war pressing hard upon this arsenal of his making, Colonel Sturm continued to direct it and meet every emergency. Not only did he supply the State's troops with ammunition, but sent large quantities to the West and South. Herman had charge of furnishing ordnance supplies to Union armies operating in West Virginia, Kentucky, Tennessee, Missouri, and Kansas.Robert H. Buck, Captain, Recorder. Military Order of the Loyal Legion of the United States Commandery of the state of Colorado, Denver. April 10, 1907. Indiana State Library.

French intervention in Mexico  After the War of the Rebellion, General Sturm was appointed and acted as agent for the Republic of Mexico from May 1, 1865 to June 30, 1868. In this office, he engaged in the purchase and shipment of material necessary for the prosecution of the war of French Intervention in Mexico lead by Maximilian I against Juarez. During this time he was also a secret, confidential agent for the Mexican government in the United States, rendering important political services to the Republic of Mexico.Indiana Magazine of History, Volume LVIII, March 1962, Number 1 His transactions and contracts under these appointments amounted to many millions of dollars, and his services were highly commended by the President and officers of Mexico.Robert H.

The Mexican republic and President Juarez were triumphant against Maximilian, in part because of large-scale shipments of guns and ammunition from the United States by Herman Sturm. Colonel Sturm ended his service with the department December 31, 1865 and his military record immediately made for him a place in a field of military endeavor that widened the scope of his life. General Sturm was a member of this Loyal Legion and was remembered by many war veterans then living in Indianapolis.  Railroad president  He became president of the Mexican Cuernavaca & Pacific Railway, a position he held for many years. Mexican mining ventures engaged his attention and other railroad affairs were shaped under his hand.  Mining president  Around 1891, he and his family relocated from Indianapolis, Indiana to Denver, Colorado, where he established the Vindicator Mining Company.

Taken as a prisoner of war during the Japanese occupation of Hong Kong, she remained in captivity for fourteen months. Upon her release, Waters returned to Canada and was honored with the Royal Red Cross. After her service in Canada, Waters moved to Hawaii, spending over a decade nursing lepers at Molokai. Early life Anna May Waters, known as May, was born on 21 January 1903, in Strathroy, Ontario, Canada to Mary (n√©e McDonald) and David Waters. When she was eight years old, she moved with her parents and three brothers to Winnipeg, Manitoba. She was educated at Lord Roberts School and Kelvin High School, before entering nursing training. In 1927, Waters graduated from Winnipeg General Hospital as a registered nurse. Career Waters began nursing in December, 1927 at the Manitoba Tuberculosis Sanatorium in Ninette and remained there for two years. She then went to work in the Central Tuberculosis Clinic in Manitoba. In 1940, she enlisted in the Royal Canadian Army Medical Corps (RCAMC) and was appointed as the nursing- sister-in-charge of the Fort Osborne Military Hospital. On 27 October 1941, she became one of the first two nurses to serve in a battlefield area during World War II, when she and Kathleen Christie sailed aboard the HMT Awatea for Hong Kong with the Winnipeg Grenadiers. After stops in Honolulu and Manila the ship arrived in Kong Kong on 16 November. She was assigned to the malaria and dysentery wards of the hospital. On December 8, when war was declared in the Pacific, the nurses moved to St. Albert's Convent. Within three days, they had established an Auxiliary Military Hospital at the convent and relocated all patients there. That same day, the first bombing of Hong Kong occurred, with the hospital taking seventeen direct hits. On Christmas Eve, rumors circulated that the colony had unconditionally surrendered to the Japanese forces and on Christmas day the Japanese occupation of Hong Kong began. On December 19, the St. Albert's Military Hospital was taken over by the Japanese. Though they were prisoners of war, the sisters continued to care for the patients under their charge until they were sent to Stanley Internment Camp in August 1942. After fourteen months of captivity, Waters was repatriated in 1943 to Canada. Waters recuperated with her family for several months, trying to gain back the weight she had lost during her internment. She was presented with the Royal Red Cross, second class, on 6 April 1944, by Brigadier J. C. Stewart, commanding officer of military district 6. In June, she was honored with the Colonial Hong Kong Gallantry Awards as a Royal Red Cross-Associate (ARRC). On 5 September 1945, she was shipped out to rejoin her unit as part of the staff on the TSS Letitia and was briefly reunited with some of her fellow former POWs in Hawaii in October. She served on the Letitia, a hospital ship operating in the Atlantic and Pacific war theatres, until August 1946. When she was discharged from the RCAMC, Waters returned to Winnipeg and remained until September 1950, when she went to work at the Oregon State Tuberculosis Hospital in Salem, Oregon. After serving for a year, she moved to Honolulu to work at the Leahi Hospital for tubercular patients. In October 1952, she returned to Manitoba to care for her ailing father, who died in 1955. In April 1956, Waters returned to Hawaii, where she nursed on the island of Molokai at the Kalaupapa Leprosy Settlement. In 1968 Waters retired and moved to Long Beach, California, where one of her brothers was living.

They were produced by the Royal Canadian Mint (RCM) in 2007, at their Ottawa facility where the first BML produced remains in storage. , the market value of a single Big Maple Leaf had reached approximately $4 million (USD). On 27 March 2017, one of the coins was stolen from a Berlin museum.  Description  A Big Maple Leaf measures thick and in diameter and is 999.99/1000 pure. The obverse of the BML shows Queen Elizabeth II as she has appeared on Canadian coinage , when Susanna Blunt's design became the third iteration of the queen's effigy to appear on coinage, (the others were 1965, and 1990). Blunt's design shows the queen in maturing dignity, without a tiara or crown, (only one other RCM design ever had the monarch not wearing a crown). The reverse design is the stylized maple leaf by RCM artist and senior engraver: Stan Witten.  Theft of one coin  In the early hours of 27 March 2017, a Big Maple Leaf was stolen from the M√ºnzkabinett (coin cabinet) of the Bode Museum in Berlin, Germany. The cabinet is known for its huge collection of coins ‚Äì more than 500,000 pieces, among them more than 100,000 Greek and 50,000 Roman ones ‚Äì though only a tiny fraction of these coins are shown at exhibits. A spokesman for the Royal Canadian Mint said \\"...the stolen coin does not belong to the mint. After creating the original (which is in storage in Ottawa), the mint manufactured five more that were sold to interested private individuals.\\" The coin was lent to the Bode Museum in 2010 by private owner Boris Fuchsmann, and was displayed there until it was stolen. In July 2017, police raids took place and arrests were made in connection with the theft. The suspects allegedly come from a family notorious for organised crime. Berlin Police assume that the coin was damaged during the theft when it was dropped from the train tracks onto the street. Investigators do not expect to find the coin as they found gold dust on seized clothing and a car and suspect the robbers may have melted the coin down. In January 2019, a trial in a juvenile court against four suspects began. Two brothers, Ahmed and Wayci Remmo, and their cousin Wissam Remmo, all belonged to a Berlin crime family of Lebanese origin known to local police as the 'Remmo Clan'. The fourth person, Denis W., was a school friend of the Remmo's and an employee of the Bode Museum. Denis was found guilty of advising the others on the museum's safety protocols. The trial ended in February of 2020 with a conviction and prison sentences for three of the accused. The fourth defendant, Wayci Remmo was acquitted due to inconclusive evidence. The whereabouts of the gold coin remains unknown.

He is a Professor of Political Science at the University of Nevada, Reno, and a senior fellow at the Claremont Institute.

Career Marini taught Political Science at the University of Dallas and Ohio University. He is now a full professor at the University of Nevada, Reno. He is also a senior fellow at the Claremont Institute, a conservative think tank. Marini is the editor of two books about the United States Congress, and the author of two more books about the American administrative state. In The Politics Of Budget Control: Congress, The Presidency And Growth Of The Administrative State, he argues that the growth of governmental bureaucracy is unlimited due to the absence of budgetary restraints, and that it is unconstitutional because it arrogates all powers. He adds that Congress is the main locus of the administrative state. In a review for the Journal of Political Analysis and Management, William A. Niskanen of the Cato Institute suggested it was \\"an elegant, profound, and disturbing book\\", but he regretted the lack of quantitative data or public choice theory in Marini's analysis. In Unmasking the Administrative State: The Crisis of American Politics in the Twenty-First Century, Marini writes about the growth of the administrative state at the expense of the Constitution over the course of the twentieth century, with the challenges it raises and the theoretical tools that could curtail it. For Marini, the administrative state is antithetical to America's populist tradition of self-government. In an essay for the Claremont Review of Books published in July 2016 and entitled Donald Trump and the American Crisis, Marini suggested then-presidential candidate Donald Trump should be commended for his recognition that neither the Democratic Party nor the Republican Party represented the American people any more.

Like several of his previous short films, Sleep Has Her House was shot on an iPhone. It also features still photography and hand drawn images by the artist. The film is considered part of the slow cinema movement due to its use of long takes; the longest of which is 11 minutes long, featuring the sun setting until dusk. The film features no dialogue.  Synopsis  In a world seemingly devoid of human beings and inhabited by only a select few animals, an undefined presence manifests, embodied as the wind. It passes through the valley, lake, and the woods, leaving only mysterious deaths in its wake. As the night creeps in, the supernatural forces at work transcend into the natural, with apocalyptic consequences.  Production  Sleep Has Her House was directed by Scott Barley, who was also the film's producer, cinematographer, sound designer and editor. It was independently produced through his production company, Ether Films. Sleep Has Her House was not originally made for film festivals or the internet. The film's first draft cut had a duration of four hours, and was planned as an installation where audience members would be welcome to - in the director's own words - \\"take a nap\\" during its screening. Barley eventually decided to rework the film into a more condensed, consumable form for the internet and later for festivals, but has not ruled out releasing a longer cut in the future. Principal photography was shot on an iPhone, and took place during 2015 and 2016 in Wales and Scotland, with post-production being completed alongside ongoing production for sixteen months. Some of the sequences in the film consist of up to sixty separate shots invisibly stitched together in post-production, that in some cases took months to render. The film was completed in December 2016. Reception = Critical response = Despite a niche audience, the film has received acclaim. In early 2017, it was nominated best \\"overlooked film\\" by film critic, Dustin Chang, in IndieWire's 2016 critic's poll, although this was before its official release. James Slaymaker of Mubi Notebook wrote, \\"Like the great Jean-Marie Straub, Scott Barley creates striking images by returning us to the basics of cinema, the natural world, but abstracting it through profilmic means by reducing the landscape to pure, basic forms [...] If Sleep Has Her House at first calls to mind the expressionist landscapes of Peter Hutton, Victor Sj√∂str√∂m, and Jean- Marie Straub, the formal apocalypse of its final act recalls the smeary digital cacophony of Lucien Castaing-Taylor and V√©r√©na Paravel's Leviathan. By removing his filmmaking from any traditional sense of narrative, character, and, even temporal/spatial unity, Barley invites us to see the world‚Äîand the cinematic image‚Äîanew. Sleep Has Her House is a vital reminder that the most potent visual abstractions can be created through something as simple as the shifting colour of the sky reflected in water, and the most jarring shock can come from a change in lens.\\" Influential American experimental filmmaker, Phil Solomon wrote of the film, \\"There are moments within Sleep Has Her House of such exquisite and subtle rendering of ‚Äòmoving light in place‚Äô that I have always dreamed of experiencing in the cinema. A black forest film to be entered into only with great care and caution [...] Scott Barley has dared us to imagine a cinema of such fragile - and terrifying - beauty (reclaiming once again that real definition of 'awesome', the sublime) that places both the film and the viewer on equal footing of corporal existence by the closing credits.\\" The film was later nominated in Sight & Sound's best films of 2017 poll. In casting his vote, writer and film critic, Tom Charity described the film as, \\"The single most momentous hour and a half in the dark this year, a tenebrous landscape film shapeshifting between reality and nightmare, cinema and dream.\\" In early 2018, Sleep Has Her House was nominated for best film, best first feature, and best director in The Village Voice 2017 Film Poll. = Accolades = Sleep Has Her House was awarded Best Film by the official jury at the Fronteira International Documentary & Experimental Film Festival in Goi√¢nia, Brazil.

He was the nephew of the previous duke, Avtandil I. Nugzar was a boy when his uncle died, and he was still young as well when he got control over the duchy from his \\"illegitimate cousins\\". In his early years as duke, Nugzar managed to force Mtiuleti into submission. In 1578, Simon I of Kartli (Shahnavaz Khan) was released from captivity by his Safavid overlords in order to fight the Ottomans during the Ottoman-Safavid War of 1578-1590. Some months after however, he took revenge on allies of Nugzar ‚Äì the eristavi of Ksani as well as the Amilakhori family, in retaliation for their behavior during Simon I's first tenure as ruler of Kartli. In 1580, Simon I defeated Alexander II of Kakheti, whom Nugzar was dependent on, but Nugzar himself apparently managed to evade Simon I's wrath. During David I's brief usurpation of the Kakhetian kingdom (1601-1602), Nugzar was defeated by David. Soon after however, Nugzar switched his allegiance to George X of Kartli. The latter had promised Nugzar a daughter in marriage to his eldest son, Baadur (Bahadur). During the Ottoman-Safavid War of 1603-1618, Safavid king Abbas I (r. 1588-1629) summoned George X and Nugzar, but he later sent them both back to Kartli in order to bolster their defences. In 1610, when Nugzar received his son-in-law Giorgi Saakadze (M≈´rƒÅv-Beg), he was reportedly the master of all lands situated between the three Aragvi streams. His last appearance in the records is in 1611. Nugzar I had two sons; Baadur and Zurab (Sohrab). Baadur succeeded Nugzar as eristavi of the duchy, who in turn was succeeded by Zurab (1619-1629).

With 400 beds, it is largest military medical facility in Afghanistan, and serves members of the Afghan National Army and other members of the Afghan law enforcement community, and also contains a teaching department. Established in 1973 by the Soviets, it is now described as the \\"crown jewel\\" of the Afghan healthcare industry.  History  The Daoud Khan Military Hospital was constructed by the Soviets in 1973. Today, with 400 beds, Daoud Khan Military Hospital is the largest and best-equipped medical facility in Afghanistan. On 22 October 2015, Afghan President Ashraf Ghani visited the hospital.  2011 suicide bombing  Midday on Saturday, 21 May 2011, a powerful bomb was detonated on the grounds of Daoud Khan Military Hospital, killing 6 people and injuring 26. It was the work of a suicide bomber who set off the blast inside a tent on hospital grounds while medical trainees were sitting down to eat lunch. It is unknown how the attacker infiltrated the hospital property, having someone gone through military checkpoints at the entrances. The Taliban claimed responsibility for the attack through a spokesman for the group, Zabiullah Mujahid. Afghan President Hamid Karzai condemned the attack as a \\"wild act\\" against human and religious values, saying in a statement, \\"The enemies of Afghanistan are so cruel and spiritless that they attack even patients and doctors of the hospital, which is against Islamic law and principles.\\" International Security Assistance Force spokesman Vic Beck called the strike \\"abhorrent,\\" saying it \\"represents the lowest, most cowardly attack.\\" The United Nations Afghanistan mission said in a statement, \\"All medical personnel and facilities must be respected and protected in all circumstances. Further, directing an attack against a zone established to shelter wounded and sick persons, and civilians from the effects of hostilities, is also illegal and prohibited. As parties to the conflict, all anti-government elements have clear responsibilities under international humanitarian law to protect civilians and to not attack them,\\" the U.N. Afghan mission said in a statement.  2017 terrorist attack  On 8 March 2017, the Daoud Khan Military Hospital in Kabul, Afghanistan, was attacked by a group of gunmen, some of them dressed in white hospital robes. Government officials confirmed at least 49 people were killed in the hours-long assault, while 63 others were injured. By March 13 the unconfirmed death toll had surpassed 100, with an unknown number injured. The Islamic State claimed to have carried out the attack, but officials suspected the Haqqani network instead. Afghan President Ashraf Ghani and Chief Executive Abdullah Abdullah both made statements condemning the attack, as did the United Nations. In the days after the attack, both Ghani and Abdullah visited the hospital to thank the doctors and assess damages. From the United States, Army General John W. Nicholson Jr., commander of the US Forces in Afghanistan, condemned the attack as an \\"unspeakable crime,\\" and praised security forces for their swift response, saying they deserved \\"our highest praise and respect.\\" The United States Embassy in Kabul released a statement saying, \\"Targeting a medical facility providing care for the brave Afghans working to protect their fellow citizens has no possible justification in any religion or creed.\\"  Administration and organization  The hospital was established to treat wounded Afghan soldiers, and is funded largely by the United States government. It is staffed entirely by Afghan doctors and nurses, with American military doctors and other U.S. personnel to serve as mentors and advisors.  Controversies  During the summer of 2010, allegations of corruption and abuses came to light regarding the Daoud Khan Military Hospital. This included widespread theft, mismanagement, and patient neglect, as well as firsthand allegations that Afghan staff would steal fuel from the hospital's generators and steal pharmaceutical drugs to sell on the black market. Furthermore, American- trained Afghan doctors and nurses would rarely show up to work. Hospital conditions were described as \\"deplorable\\" and \\"Auschwitz-like.\\" In September 2011, these abuses became public, and in October 2011, these issues were documented by the United States Department of Defense. The hospital has also been subject to controversy in Afghanistan for its treatment of Taliban fighters. The hospital devotes two floors for Taliban patients, who are cared for by doctors without discrimination.

She and her husband, John Lewis McAdoo, engaged in research concerning African- American families. She was the author of a well-regarded anthology, Black Families. Early life McAdoo was the first of three children born to William Harrison Pipes and Anne Howard Russell Pipes. She was born in the infirmary of Fort Valley State College. William Pipes taught at Fort Valley State and several other colleges, was president of Alcorn College and became the first African-American professor at Michigan State University. When McAdoo was a small child, her mother worked as a domestic servant in spite of having a master's degree because of poor job prospects for black people at the time. McAdoo grew up mostly in Little Rock, Arkansas, but her family moved to East Lansing, Michigan, when she was a teenager, and she finished high school there. McAdoo earned undergraduate and master's degree from Michigan State University and a Ph.D. in educational psychology and child development from the University of Michigan. She did postdoctoral work at Harvard University. Career After 21 years on the faculty at Howard University in the School of Social Work, two of which she spent as acting dean, she was named a Distinguished Professor at Michigan State in the Department of Sociology and the School of Human Ecology. McAdoo also held visiting professorships at several institutions, including Smith College and the University of Washington. McAdoo and her husband, researcher John Lewis McAdoo, started working on the Family Life Project in the 1970s. The project was an attempt to study African-American families. The couple felt that most of the sociological evidence on this subject reinforced long-held stereotypes because they came from dysfunctional families who had contact with agencies such as prisons and drug treatment programs rather than from middle-class families. McAdoo and her husband systematically looked at middle-class black families in Washington, D.C. The Association of Black Psychologists named McAdoo its 1978 Outstanding Researcher of the Year. During the Carter administration, McAdoo was an appointee to the White House Conference on Families. In 1994, McAdoo was the president of the National Council on Family Relations. She was the editor of a four-volume anthology known as Black Families. She and her husband established the Empirical Conference on Black Psychology. Death and legacy McAdoo died unexpectedly in 2009. She was predeceased by her husband. The National Council on Family Relations awards the John L. and Harriette P.

Manuscript and publication history The history of the Tolidah itself is based primarily on information in the manuscript of 1859. It is partially corroborated by the composite nature of the text, which suggests that parts were written at different times. The oldest section of the Tolidah was originally compiled in 1149 AD (554 AH) by Eleazar ben ◊≥Amram of Nablus. This chronicle was continued by Jacob ben Ishmael in 1346 AD (747 AH). Other scribes continued the work down to 1859. The Tolidah was brought to the attention of western scholarship by Adolf Neubauer, who purchased the manuscript of Jacob ben Harun, now MS or. 651 in the Bodleian Library, and published it in 1869. His edition was based on MS or. 651 and on a manuscript copied in 1797 AD (1212 AH) by Shlomo ben ·π¨obiah, which he could not buy but was able to view for a few hours in Nablus. In 1870, Moritz Heidenheim, apparently unaware of Neubauer's publication of the year before, published his own edition of the Tolidah. In 1954, John Bowman, claiming to have seen a manuscript with \\"the appearance of antiquity\\" that he believed to be the original Tolidah, published a new edition. He did not give a date or name the scribe of the manuscript. In 1977, he published an English translation of the \\"original\\" part of the chronicle. The latest critical edition, based on the more manuscripts than all previous and including an English translation and commentary, is that of Moshe Florentin, published in 1999. Contents The first part of the Tolidah, written in Aramaic, is a discussion of the meridian that passes through Mount Gerizim. The genealogies of the patriarchs from Adam to Moses are given, and that of Aaron down to Uzzi. It lists the High Priests of Israel (that is, mainly the Samaritan High Priests) from the destruction of the tabernacle at Shiloh down to the time of the original author, Eleazar ben ◊≥Amram. The most prominent Samaritan families are listed. Brief references to wider world exist solely to place these families in their context. Although the chronicle was compiled in the Crusader kingdom of Jerusalem, it does not mention the Crusaders. It does mentioned the Seljuk conquest of Ramla in 1070/71 AD (463 AH), and provides evidence for Samaritan communities in Gaza and Acre in the 12th century AD.Benjamin Z. Kedar, \\"Samaritan History: The Frankish Period\\", in Alan David Crown (ed.), The Samaritans (T√ºbingen: J. C. B. Mohr, 1989), pp. 82‚Äì94. The continuation of 1346 provides a list of jubilees from the Israelite conquest of Canaan down to the compiler's own time. The continuation mentions the devastation wrought on the Samaritan community at Nablus by a major raid in the mid-13th century AD. This was not the Templar raid of 1242, which devastated the Muslim inhabitants. Neubauer believed it to be the Khwarazmian raid that conquered Jerusalem in 1244, but it was more likely the Mongol raid of 1260.

It has all the classic Warrant ingredients that people have come to know, plus a lot of extras that keep it in the modern realm of today's music. It's a perfect mix between Balls and Ballads.

This herb is native to Asia, but distributed widely in Europe and Australia. It is used in South East Asian cooking. Description Persicaria minor is native to South East Asia, including Malaysia, Thailand, Vietnam and Indonesia. It grows wild in cooler highlands, but is also found in wet lowland areas near rivers, ditches, and canals. It is a creeping plant with slender stems, and grows upright to a height of 1 to 1.5 meters. The creeping stem is green with reddish tinge, is cylindrical in shape, and has short nodes about 9 mm apart. Its leaves are long and narrowly- tapering, alternately arranged, and green with short, reddish petioles. Its flowers are minute, pale violet, and are 12 to 15 cm long. Uses Persicaria minor is an edible herb. In Malaysia and Singapore, the shoots and young leaves are eaten raw as part of salad (ulam); used as an aroma spice additive in peppery dishes such as laksa, nasi kerabu, asam pedas and tom yam; used as tea leaves; and used for topical applications. Its oil has been used for aromatherapy and in treatments for dandruff. In Malaysian traditional medicine, P. minor has been used in post-natal tonics and for treatment of digestion. Pharmacological studies on P. minor have indicated anti-oxidant, LDL oxidation, anti-inflammatory and anti-microbial activities, digestive enhancing and anti-ulcer activities, as well as cognitive enhancing activities. Comparative studies have been carried out to analyse the metabolites not only in the plant's leaves, but also in its stem and roots.

Originally built by Clyde Engineering in the 1960s as Queensland Rails 1460 and 1502 class locomotives. They were purchased by Tranz Rail in 1995 to be rebuilt, as a cheaper alternative to buying new locomotives. Tranz Rail rebuilt 16 locos into the DQ class. Tranz Rail then sold the 12 DQs to AN Tasrail. Only eight out of the twelve DQs are still in service today. Introduction and service D class locomotives with a freight train in at Glenorchy Following the rebuilding of the DQ and QR class locomotives at Tranz Rails Hutt Workshops, Tranz Rail sold twelve DQs for the planned replacement of Tasrails English Electric locomotive fleet. DQs 2001 and 2002 were repainted into the ATN Red livery. Due to the Australian Transport Network not being impressed with the looks and the cost of the livery, the rest of the locomotives were repainted into the Wisconsin Central Maroon livery. With the sales of the twelve locomotives, they were renumbered in the 20XX series from the 60XX series (1502 class rebuilds) and 63XX (1460 class rebuilds), as they were in New Zealand. On 2 September 1998, DQs 2001 and 2002 arrived in Bell Bay. After arrival, the locomotives were towed to Tasrails East Tamar Workshops for adjustments and testing, before entering service later that month. A second batch of three locomotives arrived on 16 December 1998, with the third batch arriving on 3 March 1999. The last batched arrived on 5 October 1999. The locomotives have had a high number of main generator failures, since their arrivals. Reductions in rated haulage capacity in recent years have reduced the number of in service failures and train operating problems. The locomotives have also had vibration issues in Tasmania, and well as in New Zealand since being rebuilt. The locomotives were later sold to AN Tasrail. With Pacific National selling the Tasmanian railway system to TasRail, six locomotives have been repainted into the new grey and yellow livery. DQ 2001, which had just been reassembled, became the first loco to carry the new livery in August 2010. Two DQs are carrying special advertising panels, in-place of TasRails logo. 2006 carries a level crossing safety advertisement, while 2012 carries logos commemorating the 75th anniversary of the Rosebery Mine.

Due to the introduction of the TR class, DQs 2003, 2004, 2005, 2007 and 2008 were withdrawn from service, and would require heavy overhauls and other work before being available for use. with the rest to follow. By late 2015, with the failure of the TR class to be able to operate on the Melba Line, the serviceable DQs were forced to continue on Melba Line services. They also remained in use as yard shunters in Burnie and Devonport. The poorer than expected availability on the TR's has seen DQ's make occasional trips east/south. DQ 2008 has been reinstated to cover locomotive shortages. In 2017, it was confirmed that DQ 2007 would be converted into a driving trailer to a driving trailer for the Railton to Devonport cement trains to replace DV 1. In mid-2019, 2007 was converted and re-numbered DV2, replacing DV1 (Y7)..

As a woman who firstly worked in the traditional roles of research assistant and demonstrator in the non-traditional discipline of science, Dyason progressed to become a leader at a major Australian university, overcoming barriers of gender and culture at a national and international level, receiving awards and honors in the process. She broke through the gender-based 'glass ceiling' in the academic workplace to establish and develop the new interdisciplinary field of study of the History and Philosophy of Science that brings together The Two Cultures of the sciences and the humanities. She was a leader in the development of the new discipline of the History and Philosophy of Science in both Australia and internationally, and she overcame barriers as a woman in the non-traditional academic role of Head of Department and in the difficult cross-disciplinary task of bringing together the arts and sciences. Early life Dyason was born on 10 July 1919 in Sandringham, Melbourne to wealthy influential parents, the second child of Edward Clarence Evelyn Dyason and Anne Elizabeth, n√©e McClure, whom she described as 'sophisticated, free-thinking and rather unusual people'. Her father was a successful businessman, mining engineer and humanist with a strong belief in the power of reason, who enjoyed the company of academics, including his brother-in-law, Sir Ernest Scott, a professor of history at the University of Melbourne. She applied herself to her academic studies, especially science, as a boarder at Melbourne Church of England Girls' Grammar School from 1928 to 1937. From an early age she stood out as an independent thinker and was known for her lack of respect for authority. She recalled of her family life \\"that I wasn't to do something just because it 'wasn't the proper thing for a girl'. I was free to do anything my elder brother did, provided I'd reached the requisite size and muscle power\\". Another recollection was that she developed her life-long love of poetry while at school, especially during detention when she was required to memorize poetry as well as prose passages.  Professional life  At the University of Melbourne Dyason majored in physiology and bacteriology, gaining a B.Sc (Hons) in 1943 and M.Sc. in 1945 with first class honours and an exhibition. She was a resident of University Women's College from the beginning of her studies in 1938, and later became a committed member of the council (1945-1952) and eventually was appointed the governor (1961). She was first employed in 1943 as a demonstrator in the Physiology Department of the University of Melbourne while she carried out her M.Sc research. Her research on malaria led her to work with Professor (Sir) Douglas Wright, firstly as a research assistant and then in 1947 as a senior demonstrator in the Department of General Science. In 1949 she was employed as lecturer in the new Department of History and Methods of Science that was created under Wright's leadership. Dyason was assigned to teach first year medical students in a compulsory but non-examinable course, a difficult task that she nevertheless turned into a memorable experience for them. Her enthusiasm for the new academic field of History and Philosophy of Science led her in 1952-1953 to travel overseas where she attended lectures and seminars in the United States and Britain, including some given by James Bryant Conant at Harvard University and Sir Karl Popper at University College and the LSE in London. In 1957, when Dyason was now a senior lecturer, the department had another name change to History and Philosophy of Science. Dyason was put in charge in 1958 and was appointed Reader and Head of Department from 1965 to 1974. In 1961 she attended the famous Oxford presentation by T S Kuhn where he first presented his controversial ideas about historical changes in scientific theories and the importance of social factors. Her own research became increasingly interested in the social history of medicine, and in the 1970s she was a key figure in the introduction of courses in Science, Technology and Society at Melbourne University. Under her leadership the department grew and consolidated its position, and she continued to inspire with her wit and innovative, dedicated teaching An outstanding example was in the 1970s, when Dyason collaborated with the folk musician Danny Spooner to develop a highly popular course, titled \\"Glorious Smellbourne\\", on the topic of public health and the sewerage systems in Melbourne that included two volumes of resource materials she had compiled. As the new academic field of History and Philosophy of Science began to establish itself, Dyason played a leadership role in Australia and, later, internationally. In 1967 she became the founding president of the Australasian Association of the History and Philosophy of Science (later to become known as the Australasian Association of the History and Philosophy of Science (AAHPSSS)). She was instrumental in making her new discipline more relevant professionally to scientists when she became a founding member of the National Committee for History and Philosophy of Science in the Australian Academy of Science. Internationally, she became active as a delegate to general assemblies of the International Union of the History and Philosophy of Science in Tokyo (1974) and Edinburgh (1977). According to her successor, Professor R. W. Home, she helped bridge the gap in knowledge of those who wrote about the history of science or medicine, whether scientists, without an understanding of historical methods, or historians, without an understanding of the science they were describing. The AAHPSSS has established the Dyason Lectures at each year's conference in honour of her memory. Towards the end of her career she was still publishing in the area of history of medicine as well as reflecting on her professional life and was a member of the Council of the Royal Children's Hospital School (1983 to 1988). When she retired, The Second National Congress on Australian Medical History dedicated a whole day of presentations, as well as the published proceedings, to her. At the Congress she was elected to a committee to establish what became a national medical history society (now the Australian and New Zealand Society of the History of Medicine) and later became its foundation Vice-President. After retirement in 1985, she was appointed a Research Associate at the University of Melbourne, was awarded an honorary D.Litt. by Deakin University in 1985, and continued to enjoy her other interests in poetry, watercolour painting and bush-walking. Death and legacy Dyason died at Heidelberg on 30 September 1989 and was buried in Andersons Creek cemetery in Victoria. The Department of History and Philosophy of Science library at the University of Melbourne was named after her and contains a portrait of her by Wes Walters, a noted Victorian artist.

History Years ago, Harvard University's Office of Government and Community Affairs sponsored an in-depth study of the animal rights movement, examining its tactics, strategies, and long-term goals. Even those many years ago Harvard understood that there was a conceptual dichotomy in the movement, noting in its Report that \\"philosophically, animal rights/welfare groups can be classified as abolitionists or regulationists. The abolitionists, such as ISAR‚Ä¶constitute a minority within a movement. They are, however, also the most diligent, tactical and clear thinking. They use the law, publications and education to work for their ultimate goals.\\" (Our italics.) What Harvard said about ISAR those decades ago remains true today. International Society for Animal Rights, (originally known as National Catholic Society for Animal Welfare, then Society for Animal Rights), was chartered in the District of Columbia over a half-century ago, in 1959, making the organization one of the oldest animal protection organizations in the United States. ISAR is a 501(c) (3) tax exempt non-profit corporation. International Society for Animal Rights was the first organization in the United States (and probably the world) to express in its corporate name the moral principle guiding the organization: animal rights. The first federal and state court legal cases in the United States to use the word animal rights were in lawsuits brought by International Society for Animal Rights. ISAR's founder, the late Helen Jones, was one of the early and few pioneers in what would decades later become known as the animal rights movement. She fervently believed that humans have a moral responsibility to animals that can be satisfied only by working toward an end to cruelty to animals. In furtherance of that goal, Helen Jones originated dozens of innovative educational programs and campaigns on behalf of animal rights, one of the most prominent being the now decades-old International Homeless Animals' Day. Early in her career, one of Helen Jones's most profound insights was that an essential strategy for securing rights for animals was through public education, legislation, and the American legal system‚Äîa strategy that ISAR has employed for decades. During those years, ISAR has tried to close zoos (Do Not Sanction the Existence of Zoos (Part I), Do Not Sanction the Existence of Zoos (Part II), petitioned against simulated abuse of animals (Campaign to End Simulated Abuse of Animals in Entertainment and Product Sales), opposed the shooting of feral cats (Outdoor Life or Outdoor Death), condemned celebrities who were cruel to animals (Celebrities and Animal Abuse). ISAR and other organizations succeeded in obtaining the issuance of a United States spay/neuter postage stamp and have fought for a similar United Nations stamp (Campaign for a U.N. Spay/Neuter Postage Stamp). A brief history and accomplishments of International Society for Animal Rights can be found in ISAR's Quarter-Century Battle Against Dog and Cat Overpopulation publication. In the seminal law review article entitled \\"The Birth of Animal Rights Law: The Role of Lawyers in the Animal Rights/Protection Movement from 1972-1987\\" Joyce Tischler, Esq., founder and president of Animal Legal Defense Fund, \\"explore[s] the roots of a large scale, organized movement, which started in the early 1970s in the United States, spearheaded by attorneys and law students with the express purpose of filing lawsuits to protect animals and establish the concept of their legal rights, regardless of the species of the animals or the ownership interest of humans.\\" In that article, Ms. Tischler names as \\"the first animal rights lawyer\\" in the United States ISAR's long-time chairman, Henry Mark Holzer, professor emeritus at Brooklyn Law School. Ms. Tischler credits Professor Holzer with three accomplishments crucial to establishing the field of what today is known as animal rights law. With the support of ISAR, (1) Bringing the first federal and first state lawsuit to invoke explicitly the moral concept of animal rights; (2) Having founded the Animal Rights Law Reporter, which became \\"the legal clearinghouse for animal rights law information\\"; and, (3) Organizing the First National Conference on Animal Rights Law\\"‚Äîan undertaking, in Ms. Tischler's words, \\"[t]he significance of which cannot be overstated.\\"  Programs  To advance animal rights, ISAR engages in various activities and emphasizes five major programs. Dog and Cat Overpopulation: The literally countless annual deaths of unwanted dogs and cats is a moral obscenity, and ISAR is in the forefront of efforts to stop virtually all breeding. International Homeless Animals Day: A worldwide ISAR conceived and implemented consciousness-raising memorial to the countless dogs and cats that have fallen victim to overpopulation the previous year, at which countless adoptions are arranged and spay/neuter procedures are performed. Education: There are many aspects of animal rights, from understanding the philosophical rationales seeking to justify their abuse to humane education of children in their attitude toward animals. For decades, ISAR has created and disseminated animal rights materials. Animal law: To implement Professor Holzer's vision that the law can be used to foster, protect, and advance animal rights, under his direction ISAR is committed to a variety of law-based programs including legislation, litigation and monographs. Billboards: Outdoor advertising on ISAR's billboards has consistently proven to be a relatively inexpensive yet powerfully effective means of communicating the spay/neuter message to large numbers of motorists.

Soongsil University Festival (Daedongje) 2010-10-06 12h25m  University culture in South Korea  In the early 1950s, development of South Korean University culture was inhibited by the Korean War. At the time, the existence of universities and the lives of students had received many threats. Until the 1960s, the concept of university culture had not been used. After the war was over, universities regained stability. Around university towns, a unique and special culture unique to Korea has developed. South Korean university students usually enjoy doing activities in groups. For example, they would join a club such as dance, do volunteer work, study or travel, and spend a lot of time with other group members. The important aspect is that the student system is well developed and there are a lot of independent student organizations. The organizations host and manage many programs and events so that all students can enjoy university life. Among the various university cultures, the typical examples are OT (Student Orientation), MT (Membership Training), School Festivals, and Clubs. Events and programs represent university culture in South Korea.  Events  = OT (Student Orientation) = OT is the abbreviation for orientation. It is meant as an introduction for people so that they can understand the system and adapt to the new surroundings. Nowadays it is generally known as a welcoming event for freshman. Normally, the new lectures in the university start in March, but the university life of freshmen starts in February. There are a lot of events for freshmen held that month. For example, the welcoming event, classmate meeting, junior and senior meeting and so on. Among those things, the most important one is Orientation (a welcoming event). In this event, the freshman can not only make new friends and get to know the seniors, but also get some information about their classes and the university system. Orientation runs for 2 or 3 days. The student organization rents a large resort and all the students spend time together. The schedule varies at each university. Usually, the orientation introduces the university system and classes, includes some fun games that all students can partake in, or drinking games for the nighttime. The university recommends that freshmen bring some less formal clothes, writing utensils, and washing tools. For 2 to 3 days, freshmen can meet thousands of new people including their classmates, seniors, and other different major students. This time is a chance to make a lot of friends very easily and enjoy university life. Otherwise, there aren't many other chances to meet and become friends with upperclassmen. Freshmen don't need to be shy and just need go and make friends! = MT (Membership Training) = Membership training MT is the abbreviation for Membership Training. It means all same major students from freshman to seniors spending time at same place promoting friendship and harmony. April is the unofficial season of MT, one month after the beginning of the semester. April is very warm and a good month to do MT. It is one of the unique things about Korea's university culture that can't be seen in other university cultures. This is one of the aspects many exchange students from abroad appreciate about the Korean student life. Usually MT runs for 3 days. Same as in the orientation event before, they get organized to rent a big space for all students of the same major. *Major locations of MT *West of Seoul - Incheon Yung Jong Island / Eul-wang ri / Kang hwa do *East of Seoul - Gapyeoung-goon / Nearby Gang-chon station / PajuLimjin-gak / Po-cheun / Gwa cheoun Chung-gye mountain / Near Daeseong-ri Station *East of Gyeonggi-do- Chung-cheong do Ahn myeoun do / Dae chun / Dae bu island, Je bu island / Yong-in Gogiri valley / Everland (amusement park & Resort) *Gang-won do - Gang-reung si, Sok cho si (vallies located at Yang-gu goon, In je goon, Hong cheun goon) *Jeolla-do (including Gwang ju) - Jang-su goon, Nam won si / Gu rae goon / Dam yang goon / South coast *Jeju island - Internal of Jeju island *Gyung sang do - Daegu, North of Gyung sang do - Po hang si / Yung duk goon / Wool jin goon - Busan, South of Gyung sang do - Song jung beach / Yang san si / Geoje island The students spend the time cooking and eating food, sleeping and playing some games together. The schedule and program are managed by the student organization. They plan some events and games so that all students can join in and enjoy themselves. There are a lot of games like dodge ball, a speed quiz where the team that can answer the questions the fastest is winner and so on. At night, all the students get together and drink some beer, eat delicious food and play some drinking games. After 3 days, all the students may become close with each other. They also share some good tips for university life or on how to get good grades on the tests. If some text books that student need for class are too expensive, this time is a chance for freshmen to get the books from seniors. While it may sound at first like an event that students go to just in order to play games and drink alcohol, it provides many good opportunities for students to meet their classmates, make new friends and develop a firmer sense of value about their major.  Festivals  = Main festivals = Main big festival When it comes to 'Campus Romance', we can come up with festival. Festivals are named differently, depending on the university's character. Mostly it means all the students get together and have fun. The festival consists of many performances, exhibitions or flea markets. The university festival's history dates back to 600 years ago. There were festivals in 'Sungkyunkwan' which was the only national university in the Joseon Dynasty period. At that time, Sungkyunkwan's dormitory was opened and they permitted outsiders to come inside. Not only the students but also their parents, friends, and even relatives could participate in the festival and enjoy the many games and events. In the 1970s 'Mask dance', which is part of Korean traditional culture, was popular. Mask dance, Korean wrestling, and tug-of-war were the main events at university festivals. Also, traditional Korean performances or singing performances for political action had a role in the festival to criticize and satirize politics. In the 1980s, communal and cultural events like traditional performances, mask dance and tug-of-war were held at the festival called Daedongje which means 'become all-together'. Many academic seminars, mock trials and debates were also held. However, these festivals were sometimes delayed because of frequent demonstrations. In the 1990s, many traditional and political things had disappeared from the festival. The events at the festivals had started consisting of celebrity invitation performances, bars, flea markets and so on. The culture started putting more importance on personality and diversity than on the value of community. In the 2000s, most university festivals consist of many celebrity performances like Psy, Dynamic Duo, and IU. There are also a lot of bars set up by the students themselves. Not only the school's students but all university students in Korea can participate in and enjoy the festival. At night, some universities invite a club DJ and hold a DJ party. Normally, the university festivals are held in May for 3 days with many fantastic and enjoyable events. = Sub-festivals = There are sub-festivals organized by each department of a university. The festivals usually take place in the spring. The festivals include a range of events such as one-day pubs, quiz games and photo exhibitions. Student dormitories also host student festivals. Gwanaksa, the Seoul National University dormitory, hosts the Hanul Festival at the beginning of each fall semester. Residential dormitory students can enjoy a night at the festival. Student clubs usually take part in the main university festival, but rarely host their own festivals.  Student Clubs  Many Korean students join one or more student clubs. Various kinds of student clubs are available to university students. There are volunteer associations, debate clubs, religious clubs, bands and many others. Club activities are an important part of student life in South Korea. Many universities run student clubs for foreign students as well. Amateur orchestra clubs or student bands sometimes hold concerts for the students. Most universities have a student association that engages with the university administration. Four members of the Student Association at Sungshin Women's University were suspended after raising concerns about monetary dealings made by the university's president, but their suspension was ruled as unfounded in student disciplinary action.  Controversy  Many accidents occur during student orientation. In 2014, nine people were reported dead after a collapsed roof trapped dozens of people at a South Korean university orientation. More than 70 students were injured following the roof collapse. In 2015, a first-year female university student fell unconscious after drinking alcohol during a school-organised orientation event for newly enrolled students. She was immediately taken to a nearby hospital, but she remained unconscious. A bus driver died and 44 students were injured following a bus collapse in 2017. The bus was heading to Wonju for a school orientation.

It contains significant provisions that reaffirmed the primacy of Malay adat, while at the same time accommodating and assimilating the Islamic law. The legal code was largely modelled on the Undang-Undang Melaka and Undang-Undang Laut Melaka, and was compiled during the reign of the 12th Sultan of Pahang, Abdul Ghafur Muhiuddin Shah. It is regarded as one of the oldest digest of laws compiled in the Malay world. Historically, the Pahang Laws were adopted in Johor, following the union between Pahang and Johor in 1623, and had also significant influence in the promulgation of Perak and Brunei Laws. In 2012, the Hukum Kanun Pahang was included in the Nation Heritage List of Malaysia, under tangible heritage object category.Jabatan Warisan Negara - Warisan Kebangsaan 2012 History The adoption of various aspects of Melakan system of administration originated from the mid 15th century, when the Old Pahang Kingdom was conquered and brought into the realm of Melaka. Early rulers of the later Pahang Sultanate, which was established as a vassal to Melaka, promulgated court traditions based on the Melakan system as enshrined in both Undang-Undang Melaka and Undang-Undang Laut Melaka, and enforced the existing adat and religious rules to maintain social order. All rules, prohibitions and customs that have been codified as laws, were in turn collected through oral traditions and memorized by senior ministers. Between 1592 and 1614, under the order of the 12th Sultan of Pahang, Abdul Ghafur Muhiuddin Shah, the laws were improved with the details and most importantly, were recorded. The legal text would contains detailed provisions on ceremonial matters, settlement of social conflicts, maritime matters, Islamic laws and general matters. The original 44-clauses of Undang-Undang Melaka were expanded into the 93 clauses of the Pahang laws. Shortly after the death of Abdul Ghafur Muhiuddin Shah, Pahang descended into chaos after suffering devastating attacks from Aceh. The installation of a relative, Raja Bujang, to the Pahang throne, and few years later in 1623, to the Johor throne, had united both states under a single administration. Pahang Laws were part of the elements that were integrated into the new administration. It was mentioned in the surviving text of Hukum Kanun Pahang, that the laws were also enforced in Johor. The Pahang Laws had also significant influence in the promulgation of Hukum Kanun Brunei ('Brunei Laws') and Undang-Undang 99 ('the 99 Perak Laws'). Although both Perak and Brunei were never subjugated by Pahang, this was made possible as both states enjoyed strong diplomatic, trade and even marriage relations with the rulers of Pahang. Sultan Abdul Ghafur himself was married to a daughter of Saiful Rijal of Brunei, and he betrothed his eldest son to a grand daughter of the Sultan of Perak. Content Similar to the Melakan Laws, the Pahang Laws was an evolving legal code and heavily influenced by both Malay Adat and Sharia law. In general, Islamic influence is dominant throughout the text, although the adat law is also prevalent in certain clauses related to commercial, family and marriage laws. In the early chapters of the text, extending from clause 1 to clause 23, are evidences of pre-Islamic influences. The legal code was further expanded to clause 66 as a result of Islamic influence. It was again further expanded up to clause 93 after receiving Melakan influences through Undang-Undang Melaka and Undang-Undang Laut Melaka. The 93 clauses of the legal code are neither systematically arranged nor classified, but can be categorised as follows; *Criminal law :Includes punishments for criminal offences like murder, theft, robbery, and trespassing. Method of punishments includes qisas and fines. Other criminal offences mentioned are adultery, rape, sodomy. gambling, bribery and many others. All these provisions are found in the following clauses: 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 22, 46, 47, 48, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 63, 70, 72, 74, 79, 84, 86, 90, 92, and 93. *Commercial law :Includes rules of commerce, lease, secured loan, loan, wage and so on. It also contains the first codified laws pertaining to waqf in the Malay world. All these provisions are found in the following clauses: 2, 3, 9, 11, 12, 14, 16, 17, 18, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 41, 42, 43, 44, 62, 77, 81, 85, 87, and 88. *Family and marriage laws :Provisions for family and marriage laws are found in clause 67 of Hukum Kanun Pahang which regarded as directly copied from 3 clauses (25, 26, 27) of Undang-Undang Melaka. *Matters related to general religious offense and ibadah :Includes punishments for offences like apostasy and omitting salah, and the rules on jihad, witnesses and oaths. Such provisions are found in clauses 60, 61, 62, 64, and 65. *Adat law and constitution :Outlines the roles and special positions of the Sultan and his ministers. Provisions for adat law and constitution can be found in the following clauses; 1, 12, 20, 21, 23, 56, 57, 75, 76, 82, 83, 89, and 91. The most important part of the legal code, described as 'part one', states that the code was composed during the reign of Sultan Abdul Ghafur and applies not only to Pahang but also to Perak and Johor. A preface then states that the king should look after his subjects and appoints the leaders of the state, including the mangkubumi ('regent'), penghulu bendahari ('the treasurer'), temenggung ('leader of the army and the police'), hulubalang ('generals'), shahbandar ('harbour master'), and menteri ('ministers'). The duties of these officials are described, one by one.

In nine novels, she explored the turbulent decades between 1930 and 1980 in the Western United States and along the Atlantic Coast. Her work focuses on men and women dealing with the Great Depression, World War II, the birth of the women‚Äôs movement, the Sixties counterculture and the Vietnam War. Among her best-known books are The Last Night at the Ritz, the semi-autobiographical The Girls from the Five Great Valleys, Summer of Pride, But Not for Love, A Fall of Angels, and Happy Ending. Savage was married for 50 years to the equally celebrated novelist Thomas Savage, with whom she had three children. In novels such as But Not For Love, she captures the stresses caused by class distinctions, economic differences and male/female relationships within groups of friends or extended families, whether the combatants live in Maine beach colonies, remote Idaho ranches or Montana college towns.Leggett, John, New York Times Book Review, But Not For Love, July 26, 1970, p. 93. She also focuses on complex female friendships, stretching over many years. A strong sense of place permeates all her work.Pearl, Nancy, foreword to The Girls from the Five Great Valleys, 2014 Three of Savage's novels illuminate the American West, where she spent much of her childhood. Others are set in Maine, where she lived most of her adulthood. Early life Savage was born in Hingham, Massachusetts. She was the daughter of Mildred Ridlon and Brassil Fitzgerald. Her father was an English professor and freelance writer. ‚ÄúHe was a harbinger of this peripatetic century;‚Äù she once said. ‚ÄúHe attended Boston College, the University of Arizona and Stanford before he taught first at Utah and then Montana. So I grew up thinking of myself primarily as a westerner and was not surprised to marry one‚Äîalthough we met in the east.‚ÄùHart, Sue (1995) monograph,Thomas and Elizabeth Savage, Western Writers Series, Boise State University, Boise Idaho, p. 5. Known as ‚ÄúBetty‚Äù to her family and friends, Savage graduated from Missoula County High School in Missoula, Montana, and went east to enroll at Colby College, Waterville, Maine, in 1937. That summer, she began exchanging letters with ‚Äúa friend of a friend,‚Äù the young man who would become her husband. Thomas (then known as Thomas Brenner) was from Horse Prairie, Montana. Although he had been a student of her father‚Äôs at the University of Montana, Missoula, he had never met Elizabeth. After months of letters, he hopped on a Greyhound bus and traveled from Montana to Boston, where he met his future wife and her mother at the Copley Plaza Hotel, a scene she later fictionalized in her best-known novel, The Last Night at the Ritz.Hart, Sue (1995), monograph Thomas and Elizabeth Savage, Western Writers Series, Boise State University, Boise Idaho, p. 8. Afterwards, Thomas joined Elizabeth at Colby College.Colby College magazine, obituaries, 2004 The couple married in 1939, while still students, and received B.A. degrees in 1940. She graduated magna cum laude. The Savages lived in Chicago, Montana and Massachusetts before settling down in Maine, their home for the next thirty years.Hart, Sue (1995) monograph, Thomas and Elizabeth Savage, Western Writers Series, Boise State University, Boise Idaho, p 9-11. During the Maine years, both Savages established \\"big literary careers as novelists.\\"Bradley, Harrison, editor. All Our Stories Are Here: Perspectives on Montana, University of Nebraska Press, p. 17 Each published nine novels. In 1985, they moved to Whidbey Island, Washington, where Thomas had a recently discovered sister. Elizabeth died there in 1989. She was 71 years old.Hart, Sue (1995), monograph, Thomas and Elizabeth Savage, Western Writers Series, Boise State University, Boise Idaho. Career Savage wrote her first novel, Lacquer Lady, at the age of 10, featuring not only a ‚Äúsophisticated young woman who wore black but also ‚ÄúBinky, an older man of 18.‚Äù She won a National Scholastic prize for ‚ÄúThe Master in the House,‚Äù a one- act play set in Hingham, her birthplace.It was later published by Samuel French. After she married and got busy raising children, Savage wrote mainly poetry. She sold a story based on her husband‚Äôs grandmother,‚ÄúThe Sheep Queen of Idaho,‚Äù to the Saturday Evening Post for $1,000‚Äîa princely sum at the time. She was 42 years old before she published her first novel, Summer of Pride in 1960. The second novel, But Not for Love, came ten year later. ‚ÄùBut once she was freed up, she wrote quite rapidly,\\" said her husband. Seven novels followed, sometimes one a year. She also wrote for Writer magazine, Paris Review, Redbook and Saturday Evening Post. Savage's last work has a prophetic name, Toward the End. She died in Washington State in 1989, nine years after its publication. Asked about her influences, Savage listed William Makepeace Thackeray and Charles Dickens.Hart, Sue (1995), monograph, Thomas and Elizabeth Savage, Western Writers Series, Boise State University, Boise Idaho, p. 11. Her interest in Victorian literature is reflected in Willowwood: A Novel, (1978), an exploration of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood focused on the complicated relationship between artist Dante Gabriel Rossetti and his muse Elizabeth Siddal.Jane S. Bakerman, professor, University of Indiana, American Women Writers: A Critical Reference Guide from Colonial Times to the Present, The Gale Group Inc., 2000. In 2012, Nancy Pearl sparked new interest in Savage's work when The Last Night at the Ritz became a Nancy Pearl's Book Lust Rediscoveries imprint. A line from the novel had been a favorite of Pearl's for many years. \\"It is very dangerous to get caught without something to read.\\" Pearl notes that The Last Night In the Ritz is set in the Mad Men era and \\"there's a lot of drink, everyone smokes (cigarettes) and fornication, not to say adultery, is hardly an unknown event.\\"Pearl, Nancy, foreword, The Last Night at the Ritz, 2012 Last Night at the Ritz displays a \\"delicate interplay of past and present that is a pure delight ... \\" wrote Martin Levin in The New York Times. \\"The nostalgic aura surrounding these happenings is strong enough to make Elizabeth Savage's novel glow in the dark.\\"Levin, Martin, \\"New Novel,\\" New York Times Book Review, August 19, 1973, p. 296.

The Oakland Raiders relocation to Las Vegas saw the Oakland Raiders, an American football club in the National Football League (NFL), move from their longtime home of Oakland, California, to the Las Vegas, Nevada metropolitan area. The renamed Las Vegas Raiders play home games at Allegiant Stadium in Paradise, Nevada, which was substantially completed on July 31, 2020. The Raiders' move followed years of failed efforts by team owner Mark Davis to renovate or replace the Oakland Coliseum, which had been consistently rated as one of the worst stadiums in the NFL. NFL team owners approved the move, 31‚Äì1, at their annual league meeting in Phoenix, Arizona, on March 27, 2017. The Raiders became the third NFL franchise in the 2010s to announce a move, following the Rams' 2016 return from St. Louis, Missouri, to Los Angeles, California, and the Chargers' 2017 move from San Diego to the Los Angeles suburb of Carson, California. The Chargers and Rams now share SoFi Stadium in Inglewood, California. Background The Oakland Raiders were founded as a charter member of the American Football League (AFL) in 1960. The team joined the NFL as a result of the merger in 1970. From 1966 until 1981, it played home games at the Oakland Coliseum, which it shared with Major League Baseball's Oakland Athletics after that team moved to Oakland from Kansas City, Missouri in 1968. In 1980 Al Davis, dissatisfied with the stadium situation in Oakland and seeing luxury suites as the future of the NFL, came to an agreement with the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum commission to move the Raiders to Los Angeles. The NFL had refused to let the team move, but a court overruled the league, clearing the way for the Raiders to move to Los Angeles and become the Los Angeles Raiders in 1982. The Raiders played home games at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum from 1982 to 1994. In 1995, the Raiders returned to Oakland after the city and Alameda County agreed to build the luxury and club seats on to the Oakland Coliseum with a structure that would become known as Mount Davis. Davis chose to return the Raiders to Oakland after the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum Commission failed to deliver on promised renovations to build luxury suites (the Coliseum would not have luxury suites until a 2019 renovation) and after he was unable to secure a new stadium in the Los Angeles area. At one point a proposed a move to Sacramento that involved Davis taking ownership of the Sacramento Kings, looked possible but that deal fell apart. Las Vegas had been home to a number of other professional football franchises between 1994 and the Raiders' arrival, none of which were particularly successful. The Las Vegas Posse, part of the Canadian Football League's effort to enter the U.S. market, lasted one season in 1994 and suffered from a poor on-field product and low attendance. The XFL included the Las Vegas Outlaws in its lone 2001 season. Attendance and on-field performance were respectable, and the team embraced the city's culture, but the Outlaws' modest success was overshadowed by the failure of the XFL. The Las Vegas Locomotives of the United Football League were a major on-field success and were one of the UFL's best teams; it nonetheless suffered from poor attendance that continued to decline throughout the league's existence to the point that its last home game drew only 600 fans. The Arena Football League included three teams in Las Vegas over the course of its history: the Las Vegas Sting (1994 and 1995), Las Vegas Gladiators (2003 to 2007, who moved to Cleveland and became the Cleveland Gladiators before folding), and another Las Vegas Outlaws (2015). The Las Vegas Sin of the Lingerie Football League (now the Legends Football League) played in the city from 2011 to 2014. The hunt for a home Raiders owner Mark Davis Recent efforts to either renovate the Oakland‚ÄìAlameda County Coliseum or replace it with a new football stadium in Oakland or elsewhere began on November 18, 2009. In 2011, Al Davis died; control of the team was assumed by his son Mark Davis who made the three-decade stadium problem a top priority. The Raiders were free to move after the 2013 NFL season, when its lease on the Oakland‚ÄìAlameda County Coliseum expired. While exploring possible solutions in the Bay Area and elsewhere, the Raiders signed one-year extensions of its lease on the Coliseum. =2011: Levi's Stadium= The Raiders were talking with the San Francisco 49ers about sharing the planned Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara, California. However, the 49ers went ahead without the Raiders and broke ground on the $1.2 billion stadium on April 19, 2012, and afterwards sold $670 million worth of seats including 70% of club and luxury suites, making it more unlikely that the Raiders would want to explore any idea of sharing the stadium as they would then be secondary tenants with little to no commercial rights over the highly lucrative luxury suites. In October 2012, Mark Davis told NFL Network reporter Ian Rapoport that he had no plans to share the stadium but that he did recognize the Raiders' need for a new home and that he hoped the new home would be in Oakland. When Levi's Stadium opened on July 17, 2014, NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell mentioned to the live crowd that it would make a great home for the Raiders and that the team had to decide whether or not it wanted to play there or build a stadium on the site of the Oakland‚ÄìAlameda County Coliseum. =2012‚àí2013: Coliseum City= On March 7, 2012, then-Mayor Jean Quan unveiled an ambitious project to the media that was designed to improve the sports facilities of all three major league sports teams in the city (the Raiders, the Oakland Athletics, and the Golden State Warriors), as well as attract new businesses to the city. The project, dubbed Coliseum City, had entailed the redevelopment of the existing Oakland‚ÄìAlameda County Coliseum complex. The redevelopment would have seen the construction of two new stadiums on the present location, a baseball-only stadium and a football-only stadium, while Oracle Arena, home of the Warriors, would have been either rebuilt or undergone extensive renovations. A sum of $3.5 million was committed to preliminary planning on the project. However, no officials from either of Oakland's major league teams were present at the media conference. According to the San Francisco Business Times, Oakland's assistant city administrator Fred Blackwell said the Bay Investment Group LLC, an entity being formed by Colony Capital LLC, Rashid Al Malik (chairman and CEO of HayaH Holdings), and the city, had numerous details to continue working out for the prospective $2 billion Coliseum City project, which covered 800 acres surrounding the Oakland‚ÄìAlameda Coliseum Complex. The development team also included JRDV Urban International, HKS Architects, and Forest City Real Estate Services. In an ideal situation, construction could have started by the end of 2014. Meanwhile, the Warriors began to go forward with plans to build a new arena at Mission Bay, not far from Oracle Park, and move across the Bay from Oakland to San Francisco in 2019. =2013: Concord, California= The abandoned Concord Naval Weapons Station, 26.6 miles from Oakland, was announced in 2013 as a possible location for a new stadium but developments failed to materialize. =2014: San Antonio, Texas= In July 2014, San Antonio, Texas, emerged as a potential destination for the team, after Raiders owner Mark Davis visited the city for the induction of former Raiders wide receiver Cliff Branch into a local hall of fame. San Antonio, while a smaller media market than the San Francisco Bay Area, had a relatively new and NFL-ready stadium in the Alamodome, and less sporting competition. On July 29, 2014, the San Antonio Express-News reported that Mark Davis met with San Antonio government officials to discuss a move after the 2014‚Äì15 NFL season. The Raiders would have played at the 65,000-seat Alamodome until a new stadium could be built. San Antonio remained in contention through at least November 2014, when Raiders staffers scouted the stadium and began negotiating with city officials. In December 2018, Davis said that his main concern with the Alamodome was the stadium's artificial turf. =2015: Raiders attempt to put together a project with Athletics= It was reported in early 2015 that the Raiders met with Athletics owner Lewis Wolff in an effort to create a stadium solution where two separate stadiums (one for the Raiders and one for the Athletics) would have been built on the coliseum site. The Athletics balked at the deal. In an interview with J. T. the Brick on KGMZ on April 4, 2017, Davis revealed that he offered Wolff 20% of the Raiders in an attempt to get a deal done. Davis further elaborated that the closest the Raiders came to a deal in Oakland was in 2013 with Colony Capital, before the Athletics agreed to a 10-year lease extension at the Coliseum with the city of Oakland. =2015: Los Angeles project and losing to the Rams= On February 19, 2015, the Raiders and the then San Diego Chargers announced that they would build a privately financed $1.78 billion stadium in Carson, California if they were to move back to the Los Angeles market. Both teams stated that they would continue to attempt to get stadiums built in their respective cities. The Carson City Council bypassed a public vote and approved the plan 3‚Äì0. The council voted without having clarified several issues, including who would finance the stadium, how the required three-way land swap would be performed, and how it would raise enough revenue if only one team moved in as tenant. On January 12, 2016, the NFL rejected the Raiders' request to move in favor of a competing plan by Stan Kroenke to move the St. Louis Rams back to Los Angeles and construct a stadium and entertainment district in Inglewood, California. However, the NFL left open the possibility of the Raiders moving to Los Angeles by 2020 and playing in the new stadium under construction to house the Los Angeles Rams. The San Diego Chargers had the first option to join the Rams at the new stadium. The Raiders would have been authorized to negotiate an agreement if the Chargers did not exercise their option by January 2017. The Chargers exercised their choice and announced their move to Los Angeles in January 2017, shutting the Raiders out of the Southern California market. Around this time other markets expressed interest in luring the Raiders. Duluth, Minnesota, proposed to build a stadium for the team, a proposal that was not taken seriously because of the metro area's small size, proximity to the Minnesota Vikings, and unwillingness to commit money to the stadium proposal. Less than a month after the Chargers announced their move to Los Angeles, Las Vegas emerged as the most likely destination candidate for the Raiders. 2015‚àí2017: Negotiations to move to Las Vegas and last Oakland stadium effort 2015 view of the Allegiant Stadium site, next to Mandalay Bay and Interstate 15 =2015: Exploring Las Vegas= Al Davis often visited Las Vegas and sometimes considered moving the Raiders to the city. The first professional football game ever played in the Las Vegas area was a Raiders preseason game against the Houston Oilers in 1964 at the original Cashman Field. Mark Davis purchased LasVegasRaiders.com in 1998 and renewed the domain registration each year. On February 23, 2015, while still involved in the Carson project, Mark Davis attended a secret meeting at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas (UNLV) International Gaming Research Center to look at Las Vegas sports betting, its effect on pro sports, how it could affect a pro sports team in Vegas and how the Raiders and the NFL could possibly work in Las Vegas. At the time Las Vegas was seen as a long-shot candidate to win the Raiders. The meeting was set up by Napoleon McCallum, a former Raiders player turned Las Vegas Sands employee. McCallum approached Davis about moving the team to Las Vegas before a Broncos-Raiders game on November 9, 2014, in Oakland. McCallum was the first to suggest a meeting with UNLV about the idea. Previously, Las Vegas officials, notably Mayor Carolyn Goodman, had suggested building a stadium near Las Vegas Motor Speedway. At the meeting were Davis and McCallum, along with then-UNLV president Don Snyder and Bo Bernhard, executive director of the International Gaming Institute. The meeting would not be publicly revealed until two years later. While the Raiders were looking for a stadium solution, UNLV had been looking for a way to build a new stadium to replace the aging and outdated Sam Boyd Stadium since 2011. However, the university was having issues with coming up with the funds to build a stadium and the political will for helping fund a stadium for UNLV with public money was not there. By the beginning of 2016, the possibility was floated of building a stadium to house both the Raiders and UNLV. =2016= On January 29, 2016, Davis met with Las Vegas Sands owner Sheldon Adelson about moving to a $2.3 billion, 65,000-capacity domed stadium in Las Vegas. Davis also visited UNLV to meet with the university's president Len Jessup, former university president Donald Snyder, Steve Wynn, and former Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) owner Lorenzo Fertitta. The proposed stadium would replace Sam Boyd Stadium and would serve as the home of both the Raiders and the UNLV Rebels. Raiders officials visited Las Vegas to tour locations in the valley for a potential new home, including the 42-acre site of the proposed stadium. Interviewed by sports columnist Tim Kawakami of the San Jose Mercury News, Davis said that he had a \\"great\\" visit in the city. Davis also said that Las Vegas was a global city and that \\"it's absolutely an NFL city,\\" as well as saying that \\"the Raider brand would do well\\" and \\"I think Las Vegas is coming along slowly.\\" On March 21, 2016, Davis said, \\"I think the Raiders like the Las Vegas plan,\\" and \\"it's a very very very intriguing and exciting plan\\". Davis also met with Nevada Governor Brian Sandoval about the stadium plan. On April 1, 2016, Davis toured Sam Boyd Stadium to evaluate whether UNLV could serve as a temporary home of the team. He talked with UNLV football coach Tony Sanchez, athletic director Tina Kunzer-Murphy, adviser Don Snyder and school president Len Jessup. On April 28, 2016, Davis said he wanted to move the Raiders to Las Vegas and he pledged $500 million toward the construction of a proposed $2.4 billion domed stadium. \\"Together we can turn the Silver State into the silver and black state,\\" Davis said. At a media conference in UNLV's Stan Fulton Building, Davis also said the club had \\"made a commitment to Las Vegas at this point in time and that's where it stands.\\" In an interview with ESPN after returning from a meeting for the 2016 NFL draft he explained why southern Nevada might be a better location than the East Bay of the Oakland‚ÄìSan Francisco Bay Area and how he tried to make it work in Oakland; he also spoke of the meeting saying, \\"It was a positive, well-organized presentation that I believe was well-received\\", and said, \\"It was a very positive step in finding the Raiders a home.\\" On May 20, 2016, New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft said he would support Davis and the Raiders' move to Las Vegas: \\"I think it would be good for the NFL.\\" On May 23, 2016, the San Francisco Chronicle and other media outlets reported that a group led by former San Francisco 49ers safety (and Pro Football Hall of Fame member) Ronnie Lott and former quarterback Rodney Peete were looking into building a new Oakland stadium for the Raiders. The group met with team executives and Oakland city officials to brief them on their proposal. They also met with mayor Libby Schaaf. The Alameda County Board of Supervisors voted to begin negotiations with Lott's group and with the city of Oakland regarding the \\"price and terms of sale\\" for the 120-acre land of the Oakland Coliseum and Oracle Arena. Davis publicly reiterated his commitment to his announced plans to move the Raiders franchise to Las Vegas, Nevada with the support of the state of Nevada and casino mogul Sheldon Adelson, and said he did not want to negotiate further with Oakland while the Las Vegas deal was still actively in progress. A move to Las Vegas required approval by a three-quarters majority of NFL owners, and NFL commissioner Roger Goodell publicly stated his preference for keeping the Raiders franchise in Oakland if at all possible. However, it was reported that the NFL looked unfavorably on the Lott Group's financier Fortress Investment Group, known for defaulting on promises and backing patent trolls. On August 11, 2016, Raiders' officials met with northern Nevada officials about the possibility of Reno being the site of a new training camp/practice facility, and they toured several sites including the University of Nevada, Reno, Reno area high schools, and sports complexes. On August 25, 2016, the Raiders filed a trademark application for \\"Las Vegas Raiders\\" on the same day renderings of a new stadium (located west of Interstate 15 in Las Vegas) were released to the public. On September 15, 2016, the Southern Nevada Tourism Infrastructure Committee unanimously voted to recommend and approve $750 million for the Las Vegas stadium plan. On October 11, 2016, the Nevada Senate voted 16‚Äì5 to approve the funding bill for the Las Vegas stadium proposal. The Nevada Assembly voted 28‚Äì13 three days later to approve the bill to fund the new Las Vegas stadium proposal; two days later, Governor Brian Sandoval signed the funding bill into law. Davis told ESPN on October 15, 2016, that even if the Raiders were approved by the league to move to the Las Vegas metropolitan area, the club would play the next two seasons at the Oakland‚ÄìAlameda County Coliseum in 2017 and 2018: \\"We want to bring a Super Bowl championship back to the Bay Area.\\" The team would then play at a temporary facility in 2019 after its lease at the Coliseum expires. Davis has also indicated a desire to play at least one preseason game in Las Vegas, at Sam Boyd Stadium, as early as the 2018 season. (The Raiders' 2017 schedule has both preseason games in Oakland.) On October 17, 2016, Nevada Governor Brian Sandoval signed into law Senate Bill 1 and Assembly Bill 1 which approved a hotel room tax rate increase to accommodate $750 million in public funding for the new stadium. On November 12, 2016, a report from the NFL's in-house media team said Las Vegas might not be a done deal. The report said that most owners preferred the Raiders to stay in Oakland due to market size and stability. The vast majority of the NFL's revenue comes from TV contracts. So it made little sense for the other 31 NFL owners to allow one of their partners to leave the country's 6th-biggest media market for its 42nd. On November 30, 2016, a framework deal to keep the Raiders in Oakland was announced. In addition to the public land, the city of Oakland would commit $200 million to improve the infrastructure of the surrounding area. The Raiders would contribute $500 million to the stadium, while Lott's group would contribute $400 million; the NFL already committed $300 million when it rejected the Raiders' bid to return to Los Angeles in 2015. Ronnie Lott had no financial or ownership stake in the Raiders; some sources indicated that Lott was also asking for an ownership stake (reportedly around 20%) in the Raiders franchise as part of the deal, a condition that was unacceptable to Raiders owner Mark Davis. The Oakland proposal was officially announced in December 2016, and called for a $1.3 billion, football-only stadium built on the existing Coliseum site. It included mixed use development for possible office or retail space, hotel or residential living and parking, as well as 15 acres set aside for a new baseball-only facility for the Oakland Athletics if the A's so desired. The site also could have been expanded to include the land Oracle Arena sits on, with the Warriors cleared to move to their new San Francisco arena by the 2019 season. The Ronnie Lott proposal was voted on by the Oakland city and Alameda County elected officials on December 13, 2016 and approved by Oakland in a 7‚Äì0 vote and by Alameda County in a 3‚Äì2 vote. =2017= The Raiders officially filed paperwork to move to Las Vegas on January 19, 2017. The Raiders needed 24 of the 32 NFL club owners to vote to officially approve the move to Las Vegas. On January 30, 2017, it was announced that Adelson had dropped out of the stadium project, also withdrawing the Las Vegas Sands' proposed $650 million contribution from the project. Instead, the Raiders would increase their contribution from $500 million to $1.15 billion. One day after Adelson's announcement, Goldman Sachs (the company behind the financing to the proposed Las Vegas stadium) announced its intent to withdraw from the project. On January 31, 2017, in the aftermath of Adelson and Goldman Sachs' withdrawal from the Las Vegas deal, the San Diego Union-Tribune reported that Mayor Kevin Faulconer reached out to an NFL official to let them know they were eager to engage; a city official also spoke to a Raiders official on the phone. The Union-Tribune noted that any possible Raiders move to San Diego or bringing a team to the city would have been aided by a proposal for a soccer-specific stadium and mixed development. NFL commissioner Roger Goodell reiterated, during his State of the NFL address, that San Diego would need a new stadium in order to draw the team. Another roadblock for a Raiders move to the city would have been the owners of the current Los Angeles teams. Stan Kroenke and Dean Spanos would block any team from sharing Southern California, especially if that team is the Raiders (given the team's continued popularity in the region). San Diego, as an option for the Raiders, was remote. San Diego was previously home to the San Diego Chargers from 1961 until 2016 (when the team moved to the Greater Los Angeles Area); a Raiders move there would have been ironic given that the team's primary rival the Chargers were based in that city. On February 16, 2017, the San Diego Union-Tribune obtained a letter from Doug Manchester that stated he had \\"assembled a powerful group of associates\\" who would develop a 70,000-seat stadium on the land of SDCCU Stadium; the letter also stated the project would provide \\"a viable alternative\\" to the Raiders in case Las Vegas fell through; the group also stated that they were \\"open to working with the Chargers, Raiders, other NFL owners, or a new ownership group\\"; it also stated an NFL franchise could participate as a partner or tenant: \\"Our group will provide the funds previously allocated to be provided by the City of San Diego and guarantee the stadium's expeditious construction. Accordingly it will not require voter approval.\\" It also said they would provide \\"new state of the art scoreboards and upgrade Qualcomm Stadium while the new stadium is being constructed\\". On March 1, 2017, Fortress Investment Group submitted a tweaked version of the Oakland stadium plan to the NFL. Move to Las Vegas On March 6, 2017, the Raiders revealed that Bank of America would be replacing Sheldon Adelson's portion of the funding for the new stadium in Las Vegas. On March 27, 2017, the National Football League officially approved the Raiders move from Oakland to Las Vegas in a 31‚Äì1 vote, with the Miami Dolphins being the only team to vote against the measure. However, even though the Raiders were approved to move to Las Vegas, the club still played the 2017, 2018 and 2019 NFL seasons at the Oakland‚ÄìAlameda County Coliseum and will still be known as the Oakland Raiders as long as they play in the San Francisco Bay Area. The team expects the new stadium to open in 2020. The NFL issued a press release on April 14, 2017 outlining a statement of reasons as to why the league's ownership approved the Raiders' application to move from Oakland to Las Vegas. About one thousand season ticket holders asked for and received refunds after the move to Las Vegas was announced. Their tickets were sold to other fans within hours, and the Raiders' 53,250 season tickets were all sold out by late May. The league levied a $350 million moving fee on the Raiders, which will be paid in ten annual installments beginning in 2019. This figure is slightly more than half of the $650 million fee that the Rams and Chargers each paid to move to Los Angeles. On November 13, 2017, the Raiders officially broke ground on what was at the time tentatively called Las Vegas Stadium. =2018= Allegiant Stadium in December 2018 On January 2, 2018, the Henderson city council approved the sale of 55 vacant acres of land to the Raiders for their new headquarters and practice facility near Henderson Executive Airport. In January, construction crews began blasting caliche rock with dynamite to excavate and create the stadium bowl. By April 2018, more than 30 Raiders employees had already moved to Las Vegas from Oakland. On December 12, 2018, NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell announced that Las Vegas would host the 2020 NFL Draft, solidifying the NFL's support for the move, stating: \\"We look forward to working with the Raiders, Las Vegas officials and the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority to create an unforgettable week-long celebration of football for our fans, the incoming prospects and partners.\\" However, the draft was eventually held only via videoconferencing in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. During the 2020 draft, Goodell announced that Las Vegas would instead host the draft in 2022. =2019= On December 11, 2018, the city of Oakland filed an antitrust lawsuit against the Raiders and, individually, all 31 other teams in the NFL seeking millions of dollars in financial damages and unpaid debts on the Coliseum; the suit does not seek an injunction forcing the team to stay. In February 2019, it was reported that the Raiders were negotiating with Oracle Park in San Francisco, home of Major League Baseball's San Francisco Giants for 2019, but the San Francisco 49ers reportedly vetoed the deal using their territorial rights. The Raiders then, with admitted reluctance, resumed negotiations with the Coliseum and announced a renewal with that venue on February 25; the agreement, which ran for one or two years depending on whether the Allegiant Stadium was ready for play in 2020, required approval from the city of Oakland and the NFL. The Oakland‚ÄìAlameda County Coliseum Authority, the Alameda County Board of Supervisors and Oakland City Council all voted to approve the lease by March 21, clearing all legal hurdles in time for the NFL's owners meetings on March 24. =2020= Allegiant Stadium in March 2020 On January 9, 2020, the Raiders changed their social media handles from \\"Oakland Raiders\\" to \\"The Raiders\\". On January 22, 2020, the team was officially declared the \\"Las Vegas Raiders\\" in a ceremony at Allegiant Stadium. In February 2020, the Raiders sold their under-construction headquarters in Henderson, Nevada, to Mesirow Financial for $191 million in a sale-and-leaseback. As part of the sale, the Raiders signed a 29-year lease on the headquarters, with options to extend at the end of the lease for ten-year terms up to a total of 99 years. The new headquarters, called the Intermountain Healthcare Performance Center, opened in June 2020. Allegiant Stadium met its substantial completion deadline on July 31, 2020. The team held its first closed-door practice in the stadium on August 21. The team won its first game as the Las Vegas Raiders on September 13, 2020, defeating the Carolina Panthers, 34-30; they won their first home game in their new venue eight days later, defeating the New Orleans Saints, 34-24.

He emigrated to the United States in 1836, first living in New York City. Within a year, he joined his brother in New Orleans, Louisiana. Career Howard first worked as a builder/carpenter in New Orleans, where he built residential stairs. He was employed by architects James H. Dakin and Henry Molhausen. A few years later, he completed the Pontalba Buildings, started by James Gallier. Madewood Plantation House, designed by Howard in 1848. Nottoway Plantation house, completed by Howard in 1859.

This is also the third largest home in the entire Los Angeles metropolitan area. The enormous mansion was built between 2005 and 2011 for billionaire Anthony Pritzker, one of several heirs to the Hyatt Hotel fortune. Located in the exclusive Beverly Crest neighborhood, the gargantuan home has been dubbed the \\"Grand Hyatt Bel Air\\" by disapproving neighbors, in reference to its extraordinary size. History The previous home occupying a 3-acre tract at 1261 Angelo Drive was known as Ridgetop for its elevated location, situated on tract 6774, lot 24. The house was designed by architect David Lyle Fowler for his mother Carolyn Fowler Davis, completed in early 1963 in the Mid-century modern style embodying the utmost 1960s sophistication. The uniquely circular-shaped residence enclosed an inner courtyard with a swimming pool traversed by a footbridge, a home with an elliptical-themed motif including matching elliptical furniture. The one-story house contained 22 rooms and of living space including four bedrooms and six bathrooms. The structure was perched atop a promontory measuring roughly with sweeping views of Los Angeles and fronted by a single-space carport. The Hollywood film industry utilized the new home in the 1966 romantic comedy The Glass Bottom Boat starring Doris Day and Rod Taylor, appearing as the private residence of Taylor's character Bruce Templeton. Prior to the movie's release but unrelated in nature, the residence was featured in Architectural Digest magazine during the spring of 1966 (Volume 22, Issue 4, pages 102-105), captured by famed photographer Julius Shulman. The home was sold for US $2.8 million on September 17, 1999. Soon after, it appeared in two additional movies including the 2000 comedy titled Hanging Up starring Diane Keaton, Meg Ryan, and Lisa Kudrow. In that film, the home served as the private residence of Walter Matthau's character Lou Mozell in what would be the final appearance of the actor's 50-year Hollywood career. The following year, the house was featured in the 2001 film The Fast and the Furious appearing as the undercover headquarters of the LAPD and FBI. The movie script incorrectly states that singer Eddie Fisher built the house for his actress wife Elizabeth Taylor during the 1950s. The home was listed for sale on September 13, 2000 but delisted on March 13, 2001. The corporation known as 1261 Angelo Drive, LLC was created on June 3, 2002, a common tactic for high-profile individuals to anonymously purchase real estate. Later that year the Pritzker family acquired the home at 1261 Angelo Drive and the house was quickly demolished, despite efforts by the Los Angeles Conservancy to prevent its destruction. The lot was appealing because of its location near Beverly Hills and the high vantage point that offered 180-degree unobstructed views of Los Angeles. Construction Additional land was purchased on April 14, 2005, for US $14.7 million. The Pritzker family was granted permission to erect a 60-car parking lot on the site, an unusual request for an upscale residential area. Once approved, construction began in 2005. Over the next 3‚Äì5 years, a concrete platform was built into the side of the hill measuring approximately and lines for parking spaces were painted. Retaining walls stood tall. Permits were gradually secured over time to add a home, a basement, an additional basement, and finally a security house. The mansion was designed by Paris based architecture firm Designrealization, led by Ed Tuttle and built by Peter McCoy Construction. The mansion was finally completed in November 2011. With construction finished, the Pritzkers sold their Bel Air home of , where they had lived for a decade, for US $21,990,000. Description The main house at 1261 Angelo Drive features of living space and at least in additional structures. Ancillary buildings include a guest house of , a pool house of , and living quarters of for the caretakers and full-time professional staff. The home has two underground levels including a game room, a two-lane bowling alley, an entertainment foyer with a bar, and his and hers offices. The two levels above ground include a library, a fitness room, a gymnasium with an attached locker room, a spa, a beauty salon, and a restaurant-sized kitchen. The property features geothermal heating and cooling, energy-efficient lighting, climate control, and roof-mounted solar panels. The house has a plaza-sized central courtyard, a subterranean parking structure and a tennis court. The property hosted a political party for Mitt Romney in 2012 and a Cirque de Soleil performance in 2014. Controversy Typically notified about large construction projects, local residents were never alerted as the property was developed in small increments. Concerns were expressed regarding overloading the aging sewage line, the destruction of wildlife dens and native plant life, and an access road built outside the boundary of the property.

The goal of the program is to challenge student‚Äôs perception of science and engineering and experience aspects of those fields that they normally would not encounter in a school environment. The SEC focuses on inspiring students in year 10 to consider a future career in science and engineering by choosing to study science and mathematics in years 11 and 12. The SEC also includes other events such as Discovery Days and the S.M.A.R.T outreach program. History The SEC began at the University of Newcastle as an initiative of the Faculties of Engineering and Built Environment, and Science and Information Technology. Initially, information nights were conducted aimed at giving students and parents from rural areas the opportunity to find out about careers in science and engineering. Based on the success of these information nights, the first SEC event was held on the Central Coast in the year 2000, as an activity for National Science Week. Throughout 2001, events were held around the Newcastle area and other parts of NSW. 2002 saw the first Challenge Days held outside of NSW, this took place in Canberra. Over the next three years, Challenge Days were conducted in Queensland, Tasmania, South Australia and Victoria. In 2005 the winners from each state competed at the first National Final. In 2017 there were 110 SMART events, 49 Discovery Days for primary-aged students, and 99 Challenge Days for year 9-10 students. Overall more than 50,000 people were involved in one or more SEC programs. Almost 2,100 teachers and 3,600 other volunteers were also involved. Since 1998 over half a million people have taken part in a SEC event.  Discovery Days  In 2005 the Challenge expanded yet again to include events for primary school students, called Discovery Days. These are largely the same as regular challenge events; however, the actives are simplified and typical run for a shorter period of time.

Completed during the winter of 1807‚Äì1808, the work became an icon of the emerging style of French Romanticism. It depicts a moment from the aftermath of the bloody Battle of Eylau (7‚Äì8 February 1807) in which Napol√©on Bonaparte surveys the battlefield where his Grande Arm√©e secured a costly victory against the Russians. Although Napoleon on the Battlefield of Eylau retains elements of history painting, it is by far Gros's most realistic work depicting Napoleon and breaks from the subtlety of Neoclassicism. The painting is housed at the Louvre in Paris.  Background  In early February 1807, the Russian army, under the command of Levin August von Bennigsen, was in full retreat while being pursued by Napol√©on Bonaparte's Grande Arm√©e. The field armies of Russia's ally, the Kingdom of Prussia, had been decisively defeated by the Grande Arm√©e at the double Battle of Jena‚ÄìAuerstedt on 14 October 1806. This left the Russian army as the only major land force opposing Napol√©on in the War of the Fourth Coalition. After some failed attempts to disrupt the French advance, Bennigsen decided to regroup his retreating forces at the Prussian village of Eylau (now Bagrationovsk, Kaliningrad Oblast). Fighting began in the afternoon of 7 February when Napoleon's baggage section arrived at Eylau in preparation for the Emperor's arrival, unaware of the Russian presence still in the village. Thinking the French were attempting to capture the village, Bennigsen sent reinforcements to Eylau; Napol√©on reciprocated with his own fighting force. Intense engagements followed, especially around the village's church and cemetery, but the French held control of Eylau by the end of the day. The Russians countered in the early morning of 8 February with a massive artillery bombardment. On the brink of a disastrous defeat, Napol√©on called upon the Reserve Cavalry Corps to charge the Russian columns approaching Eylau. It disrupted the Russian offensive long enough for the French lines to stabilize. By nightfall, Bennigsen ordered his forces to withdraw: the French, though able to declare a victory, were left with a snowy battlefield riddled with blood and frozen corpses.  Commission  Napol√©on sought to ensure that the victory at Eylau, though costly, would not be forgotten, entrusting the director of the Louvre Vivant Denon with commissioning an artist as a part of a much larger propaganda campaign. One month after the battle, Denon announced a public competition for the commission: 26 artists sent in their sketches which were exhibited at the Louvre. Antoine-Jean Gros was declared the winner on 13 June, and completed Napol√©on on the Battlefield of Eylau during the winter of 1807‚Äì1808. According to Fran√ßois de Vergnette, Denon stipulated much of what was to be featured in the painting, including \\"the moment to be depicted, the number of 'extras', the cadavers in the foreground, and the large format\\".  Description  The painting portrays Napoleon arriving outside Eylau to survey the battlefield on 9 February 1807, the day after the fighting ended. The painting is on a monumental scale of 521 x 784 cm, such that most of the central figures are rendered life-sized. Some of the figures on the edges of the painting are intentionally cut off to instil a feeling of the work being an actual fragment of a real-life scene. The viewer's attention is immediately drawn to the large pile of corpses in the foreground whose faces are twice life-sized; another soldier, wounded, cries out in a state of madness. According to the 64th Grande Arm√©e Bulletin, the scene was designed \\"to instil in princes a love of peace and a horror of war\\". In the center of the painting Napol√©on is seen mounted on a light bay horse surveying the treatment of the wounded, his hand outstretched in a pose reminiscent of blessing the soldiers. \\"The consoling expression of the great man\\", wrote Denon, \\"seems to soften the horrors of death and spread a softer light on this scene of carnage\\". He is surrounded by members of his staff: Marshal Berthier, Marshal Bessi√®res, and General Caulaincourt are to the left, while Marshal Soult, Marshal Davout and Marshal Murat flank on the right. A wounded Lithuanian soldier, taken aback by the compassion of the Emperor, pledges his allegiance to Napol√©on while another former combatant embraces his leg.  Reception and legacy  Napol√©on on the Battlefield of Eylau was first shown at the Paris Salon in 1808. Initially, some politicians suspected the painting aimed to portray the Emperor unfavorably, but Napol√©on himself approved of Gros's work and presented him with the L√©gion d'honneur at the painter's award ceremony. Gros's depiction of Napol√©on displayed a degree of realism not present in his earlier painting of the Emperor, Bonaparte Visiting the Plague Victims of Jaffa (1804), nor those by any other artist. In its portrayal of the unpleasant truth of war, Napol√©on on the Battlefield of Eylau breaks with the prevailing style of Neoclassicism and was an early landmark in the emerging Romantic movement. Its influence is apparent in the works of French artists like Th√©odore G√©ricault and Eug√®ne Delacroix, themselves both pioneers of Romanticism.

Introduced by Jamaican dancehall group Ward 21, the Jamaican rapper is known for his rapid-fire flow; his style interchangeably fuses an exotic blend of hip-hop and Jamaican Patois. His viral single \\"Mek It Bunx Up\\" featuring Marcy Chin was signed to Sony UK's sub label Ministry of Sound and remixed by Australian rapper Iggy Azalea. Since its release, the single has garnered a combined total of 150,000,000 views on YouTube and over 20 million listens on Spotify.  Early life  Damone Walker was born in Kingston, Jamaica while raised in Spanish Town, St. Catherine, Jamaica. He attended St. Jago Preparatory School while graduating from St. Catherines High School in 1998. After high school, he pursued a career as a Medical Records Clerk at the Kingston Public Hospital.  Career  In 2006, Walker had his first child. Never one to be satisfied with the hustle and bustle of a mundane 9 to 5 life, DeeWunn found himself creatively bursting at the seams. Lacking the freedom he truly required to attack his aspirations, in 2007, DeeWunn made the leap into a recording career. In 2010, DeeWunn was scooped up as a songwriter and vocalist by legendary Dancehall Group, Ward 21, with whom he spent time penning songs for in-house artists such as Timberlee, Natalie Storm and more. In 2013, his hit \\"Mek It Bunx Up\\" featuring Marcy Chin and produced by Kunley McCarthy of Ward 21 was released. What started out as a challenge to a running joke turned out an unexpected success that even DeeWunn himself did not see coming. Attracting attention from DJs like Diplo, BBC 1Xtra's Seani B, ZJ Johnny Kool, New York's Hot 97's Massive B and more, \\"Mek It Bunx Up\\" has been spun on major radio stations and in some of the hottest nightclubs across the globe. In 2015, the song has also sparked an online dance craze after Parris Goebel (choreographer of Justin Bieber‚Äôs \\"Sorry\\" music video) recorded an impromptu performance to the single for YouTube alongside students from her class at Urban Dance Camp. Since her original upload, there have been many unique, independently made videos by dancers from around the world with combined views well into the millions. The track also made it to #30 on the Bulgarian Top 40 Radio Charts and reached #95 on Shazam's World Charts in January 2016. DeeWunn has garnered media attention from outlets such as the Jamaica Gleaner, The Jamaica Observer, Jamaica Star, Large Up, Reggaeville and Vision Newspaper. DeeWunn worked in Portland, Jamaica, where he was contracted as a songwriter by the legendary GeeJam studios. (Spearheaded by Jon Baker.) He wrote songs for artists such as Mystic Davis, Charlie B, A-Game, Nailah, Nordia Baker, Lily Allen and more. In October 2016, DeeWunn released his debut album Bunx Up - The Official Street LP. In December 2016, Parris Goebel featured DeeWunn on her single \\"Dynamite\\" which is featured on her debut album Vicious. In 2017, DeeWunn completed two European tours. In June 2017, \\"Mek It Bunx Up\\" made its TV debut during an episode of Fox's SYTYCD. In January 2018, DeeWunn collaborated with renowned Jamaican producer TJ Records for single \\"Tun Suh\\". The video was released in May and features Toronto's video vixen, fashion model, and recording artist, Aneesa Badshaw. The Indo-Guyanese model is known for her work with artists such as Cyhi The Prince and Drake. March 2019, DeeWunn released \\"Back It Up, Drop It\\" which was featured in the Samsung S10 commercial. Personal life In early 2015, Walker migrated to Montreal, Canada. He married his current spouse Reeva Ann Proctor on September 26, 2015.

Laws regarding same-sex sexual activity Law enforcement in ISIL controlled areas purport to carry out punishments. This means that homosexuals caught engaging in same-sex affairs should be thrown from rooftops. If they do not die on impact then they should be stoned to death. ISIL has published a list of offenses that will result in automatic execution, including homosexuality. According to Subhi Nahas, a gay Syrian who escaped Syria fearing for his life, he had heard that while ISIL was sparing effeminate gay men \\"for the pleasure of older men,\\" the \\"masculine\\" men suspected of being gay were being killed. He also stated that gay men joined ISIL to protect themselves and their families, sometimes reporting on fellow gays to conceal themselves more effectively. =Laws regarding same-sex child abuse= Abu Zaid al-Jazrawi, a senior commander of ISIL, raped a 15-year-old boy who was thrown off a building in Deir ez-Zor, Syria for being gay. It was reported that al-Jazrawi was reportedly flogged, forced to leave Syria, and join the fighting fronts in northwestern Iraq. The Sharia Court in Deir ez-Zor reportedly said that Abu Zaid should, like the boy, die for being gay, but ISIL commanders demanded he be sent to fight in Iraq instead. Documented executions in ISIL-controlled territory On November 23, 2014, ISIL fighters stoned to death a 20-year-old unidentified man in Mayadin, Syria and fighters stoned to death an 18-year-old unidentified man in Deir Ezzor, Syria. The men were known opponents of ISIL, and their supporters say ISIL had used the allegation that they were gay as justification to execute them. This was the first reported execution of LGBT people by ISIL. On April 30, 2015, it was reported that three men, accused of being homosexual, were executed by being shot in the head by the ISIL in Derna, Libya. Human rights activists consider this the first death sentence against homosexuals in the history of modern Libya. From December 9, 2014 to May 7, 2016, OutRight Action International estimated that 41 gay men were executed in ISIL controlled territories in Iraq and Syria. On July 22, 2016, it was reported by activists that ISIL executed a young Iraqi man in Kirkuk, Iraq by throwing him from the top of a building on charges of being gay. His corpse was later stoned by the crowd. ISIL arrested the man under the pretext that he was a homosexual.

Why Is Albanian Epic Verse So Neglected? N.p., n.d. Web. 6 Apr. 2017. This paper was a part of a conference on The Albanian Epic of Legendary Songs in Five Balkan Countries: ALbania, Kosovo, Macedonia, Serbia, and Montenegro on August 8th, 2014 Due to the Albanian language barrier, this tradition has lacked substantial international scholarship, translation, and recognition as an important source of cultural history.  History  Searching for refuge from the Huns, the Slavic people arrived in the area now known as the Balkans, just north of Greece, in the fifth century A.D. Contact with the Greeks and Greek culture was made, and it is widely thought that the Slavic oral tradition originates from this connection. Due to this link, many scholars became interested in Slavic epic verse in order to learn more about the composition of Homeric verse. Since Albanian oral verse is extant, it has played an integral role in allowing scholars to research how Homeric verse might have been created, survived, and altered. Until the end of the 19th century, Albanian epic verse was exclusively an oral tradition. No written accounts existed. In northern Albania, Albanian Franciscan priests started to record the verse and put the written recordings into collections. In 1937, as Albanian national awareness was growing, the priests published their work in books called Visaret e Kombit (The Treasures of the Nation). This national awareness is likely to be the source of the motivation to record the songs. In the late 19th century, Romanticism in Eastern Europe triggered a desire to cultivate and solidify national cultural identities. Thus, importance was placed on the Albanian epic verse because of the cultural history it contains. Lahutar in Shala, northern Albania Today, the Cycle of the Frontier Warriors, dubbed the Albanian national epic, is still sung by elderly men called lahutars, who sing while playing a one-stringed instrument called a lahuta or gusle. The gusle is an ancient instrument thought to be brought with the Slavs on their retreat from the Huns in the fifth century A.D. Many lahutars can be found in Kosovo (where the majority of the population is Albanian), northern Albania, and some in Montenegro. These men are considered to be the last traditional, European singers of epic verse. Albania = Epic Songs = * Songs of the Frontier Warriors (k√´ng√´ kreshnik√´sh‚ÄîAlbanian) * Cycle of Poems on Prince Marko  Scholarship  = Documentation = In the late nineteenth century, growing Nationalism and Romanticism raised interest in recording epic verse as a way to establish distinct ethnic and cultural history. In Albania, the first known recorder of the verse were Franciscan clergy. This initial documentation culminated in the 1937 publication of volumes titled Visaret e Kombit (The Treasures of the Nation). Meanwhile, Harvard Scholars Milman Parry and Albert Bates Lord began to explore the traditional Albanian songs. Parry and Lord sought to uncover how the Homeric epics were composed. In order to answer that question, they sought to illuminate and study first-hand the extant oral traditions. This led them to the mountainous regions of the Balkans, where reciters of the ancient songs were still around. Up until this point, documentation of any oral verse had been done by hand. Recording by hand caused the documentation to be done in an unnatural manner. Oral epics are \\"performance traditions\\", fundamentally a complex communication of emotion, culture, and history that imbue meaning by more than written text. Because of this, these songs are not done justice by a simple transcription. A by-product of transcription is the song cannot be performed the whole way through, it must stop and start to allow the transcriber to write what they hear. Luckily, Parry and Lord were researching at the right time and had support from the right people. Doing research for Harvard, the wound up in the Balkans with audio recorders, which made the process of recording the epic verse easier and yielded a product truer to the real performance. Over the course of their research, they compiled a massive collection of transcriptions and audio recordings of the songs. The Milman Parry Collection of Oral Literature at Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts \\"is the largest single repository of South Slavic heroic song in the world\\". = Difficulties in Access = Albanian literature as a whole is an under-translated and understudied material, relative to similar academic areas. This can be attributed to a few large reasons. First, the language barrier: Albanian is an Indo-European language, though dissimilar to all other modern languages. It maintains many archaic structures and its closest relative would be the very ancient Balto-Slavic languages. Dacian and Illyrian seem to be close relatives, predecessors, or ancestors. The second impediment to scholarship of the Albanian literature is its political history. Under tight control by Stalinist leaders in the second half of the 20th century, Albania was effectively isolated from the rest of the world. The closed borders kept out outsiders and kept in Albanians who wished to leave, cutting off external study, contact, and heavily impeded the development of substantive cultural exchange and research. Albanian's lack of representation in the world literary scene is not due to quality, but to dearth of external interest and difficulty of access. = Non-English-Language Historians of Albanian Epic Poetry = * Matthias Murko (1861‚Äì1952) * Gerhard Gesemann (1888‚Äì1948) * Fulvio Cordignano (1887‚Äì1952) * Maximilian Lambertz (1882‚Äì1963) * Joesf Matl (1897‚Äì1972) * Alois Schmaus (1901‚Äì1970) * Maximilian Braun (1903‚Äì1984) * Walther W√ºnsch (1908‚Äì1991) * Agnija Vasiljevna Desnickaja (1912‚Äì1992) = English-Language Historians of Albanian Epic Poetry = * Baron Edward Bulwer-Lytton (1803‚Äì1873) * Laza Kostiƒá (1841‚Äì1910) * Hector Munro Chadwick (1870‚Äì1947) * Nora Kershaw Chadwick (1891‚Äì1972) * Milman Parry (1902‚Äì1935) * Clarence Manning (1893‚Äì1972) * Albert Lord (1912‚Äì1991) * Anne Pennington (1934‚Äì1981) * John Miles Foley (1947‚Äì2012)  References  Epic poetry Albanian literature ","title":"Albanian epic verse"},{"id":"53618004","text":"Takifugu poecilonotus, the finepatterned puffer, is a species of pufferfish, one of 25 in the genus Takifugu.

They are the unified women's team of Gloucester Rugby and Hartpury University R.F.C. They were founded in 2014 and as of 2017, play in the Premier 15s.  History  In 2014, Gloucester and Hartpury College came together to found a women's team to be run under the jurisdiction of Gloucester Rugby to capitalise upon the popularity of women's rugby in the area. Hartpury College already had a women's team competing in the British Universities and Colleges Sport rugby union leagues. In their first year, Gloucester-Hartpury Women only played friendly matches, some of which were at Gloucester Rugby's home ground Kingsholm Stadium, whilst the Rugby Football Union decided which league to place them in. The team originally started with numbers as low as 4 and grew to a much bigger squad. The first captain was Stacy Hardie and vice-captain Jessica Morgan. The team won the Junior Cup in their first season. In 2015, the RFU placed them in National 2 South West. In their first season they finished second in the league. The following season, they were unbeaten. In 2017, to take advantage of an increase in women's rugby participation following England's victory in the 2014 Women's Rugby World Cup, it was announced that Gloucester-Hartpury Women were awarded a franchise in the new women's top flight, initially known as Women's Super Rugby and now as Premier 15s, as part of a reorganisation of women's rugby in England, despite never competing in the Women's Premiership or Women's Championship and moving up two leagues as a result. This was controversial as, despite the franchises being awarded by an independent body, Gloucester-Hartpury Women were awarded the position in top flight at the expense of Lichfield Ladies who had been competing in the top flight of English women's rugby for 15 years. There was speculation that this was due to geographical considerations.

The community is diverse, having a large Christian religious base, being mostly Maronite Catholics and Greek Orthodox, while also having a small Muslim group of both the Shia and Sunni branches of Islam. Lebanon, in both its modern-day form as the Lebanese state (declared in 1920, granted independence in 1943) and its historical form as the region of the Lebanon, has been a source of migrants to New Zealand for over two centuries. According to 2013 census, 1,044 Lebanese-descent people in New Zealand, with most of all people with Lebanese ancestry living in Auckland Region (44.0 percent), followed by the Wellington Region (22.4 percent), and the Otago Region (8.6 percent).[http://archive.stats.govt.nz/Census/2013-census/profile-and-summary- reports/ethnic- profiles.aspx?request_value=24771&tabname;=Populationandgeography 2013 Census ethnic group profiles: Lebanese: Population and geography] Furthermore, 68.4 percent were born in New Zealand, up from 67.2 percent in 2006.[http://archive.stats.govt.nz/Census/2013-census/profile-and-summary- reports/ethnic- profiles.aspx?request_value=24771&tabname;=Populationandgeography 2013 Census ethnic group profiles: Lebanese: Population and geography] History As part of a large scale emigration in the 1840s, numerous Lebanese (mostly Christians) migrated in great numbers out of Lebanon to various destinations. Most emigrated to Brazil and other Latin American nations, particularly Argentina, Venezuela, Colombia and Ecuador. Many also went to the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, or the United Arab Emirates and others to Australia and New Zealand. Thus, New Zealand's Lebanese population is one of the older established non-English speaking minorities in the country (though many Lebanese people now speak English, to a greater or lesser extent). In the 1890s, there were increasing numbers of Lebanese immigrants to New Zealand, part of the mass emigration from the area of the Lebanon that would become the modern Lebanese state, and also from the Anti-Lebanon mountains region of the border area with Syria. Some Lebanese people had settled in Auckland as early as 1890. The Lebanese blended into the community and attended local churches. Their language ability and entrepreneurial skills, along with a sense of belonging, gave them the confidence to integrate without losing their tradition and culture connection.Te Ara - The Lebanese Early Lebanese settler Assid Corban and his family were instrumental in introducing commercial winemaking to New Zealand. Religious diversity In New Zealand, 49% of Lebanese are Christian, while a minority (8%) are Muslim. 24.0 percent said they had no religion. All main Lebanese religious groups -- Christians, including Maronites, Greek Orthodox, Melkites, Protestants, Muslims, including Shi'a and Sunnis denominations; Druze, amongst others -- are now represented.

No previous government had negotiated collective bargaining to the downside. During the management of Alvarado a reduction of the time of seven to two months in the procedures of pensions of the teaching profession was achieved. It also managed to renegotiate the wage formula of the private sector in a unanimous agreement among workers, employers and the government, as well as a tripartite agreement among the same sectors to reduce informality, according to International Labour Organization (ILO) recommendation 204. As minister he also promoted the implementation of laws that cut luxury pensions, as well as the Ministry of Labor's defense of these laws before the Constitutional Court after appeals filed by several former deputies. Alvarado guaranteed that the Ministry of Labor will have the budget and the new places for the entry into force of the Labor Procedure Reform in July 2017. =President of Costa Rica= Alvarado speaking in 2018 On April 1, 2018 Alvarado won the presidential election (second round) with 61%, defeating Fabricio Alvarado Mu√±oz.

A large number of Waterloo Ladies' players took part in the 2006 Women's Rugby World Cup, which meant that Waterloo Ladies were unable to put out strong team leading to relegation from the Women's Premiership.

In 2013, Waterloo Ladies joined the Sale Sharks men's team for training. In 2016, Waterloo Ladies were champions of Championship 1 North. In 2017, Waterloo Ladies were selected as one of ten successful bids for a franchise in the new Women's Super Rugby competition, later renamed Premier 15s, designed to replace the Women's Premiership due to a reconstitution of women's rugby in England.

The church is situated on the corner of Wellfield Road and Malborough Road, with some referring to it as the 'church on the corner'. The church covers the ministry areas of Roath and Penylan. History =1897 to World War 2= In the late 19th Century, the population of Cardiff was enlarging. The Presbyterian church in Cardiff city centre (now the City United Reformed Church) was already full, and plans were put forward for an additional facility in a more suburban location. In 1895, a site was identified in Wellfield Road (which was then a country lane surrounded by fields), where a chapel was built, coming into use in 1897. Today this is now the church hall. The large numbers drawn to the new place of worship caused plans to be put forward just two years later for the building of a much larger building, which is now the main church building. Much of the money needed to build the church was raised with relative ease, and it opened on 20 June 1900.Childs, J. Roath, Splott and Adamsdown. 2010. History Press. p.57 The church was then called the Roath Park English Presbyterian Church. The main doorway is modeled on the one at Tintern Abbey, and the large west window on one in Melrose Abbey. The congregation was originally mostly Scottish, and the boy scout group wore kilts. The church's attendance peaked in the years before the First World War. During the conflict, the church lost many members of its congregation and its scout group. After 1918, the attendance fell to around 200, which was maintained until the post-war years. The church suffered no damage during the Second World War (even though a bomb fell on Angus Street, just a few streets away), and the church canteen served over 100 people a day. It is recorded that the church's collection plate was pawned to help towards this.Rose, J. Cardiff Churches through Time. 2013. Amberley. p.75 =1950s to present= In the post-war years, the church's pattern of worship altered. Weekly evening services ceased, and the church no longer has a choir, though retains a small Sunday school. It became St. Andrew's United Reformed Church in 1972, when the Presbyterian church amalgamated with the Congregationalists. The church has been Grade II* listed since 1975. The dwindling attendance figures observed by the church have been expected with changing religious attitudes. The majority of the congregation that still attend are mostly older people, although some families attend for usual Sunday services. The church's current minister is Rev'd Des Kitto. In the previous few years, the church has experienced many leaks through the old roof and the heating system had to be upgraded. These two things came at a cost to the church, and in mid-2018 the church reported that they were running out of funds and were struggling to keep the church open to the public., JustGiving Campaign Page. Date retrieved 2018-12-14. Local organisers Wayne Courtney and Nathan Wyburn co-operated with the minister Des Kitto to hold a series of fundraising events starting in November 2018 and continuing throughout 2019. As of August 2019, the fundraising had exceeded its ¬£10,000 target. Church buildings What is now the church hall used to be the original chapel (built in 1897) and the larger church was built in 1900. The main church building has a size III/35 Harrison & Harrison Organ; installed in 1900. (p.7) The main church can seat 500 on the main floor and an additional 200 on the balcony above, accessible from the narthex (main entrance lobby). The church was extensively rewired in 2012 and in recent years has had new heating systems installed. The church hall is used as a canteen, activity and meeting space for other organisations and a cr√®che during Sunday services and throughout the week. The hall has a balcony too, although it can only seat about 50. Off the hall are many side-rooms, such as the \\"South Room\\" which is used for prayer and reflection. Events and services Church Minister Des Kitto (middle rear) with elders and fundraisers The church holds regular services every Sunday, with holy communion services every first of the month. Each service has an attendance of roughly 50. The service consists of four or five hymns, Bible readings, a message or activity at the start, a sermon and a reflective prayer period. Children usually leave before the sermon and join the junior church in one of the side rooms. In addition to the regular Sunday services, Christian holidays are also observed - Christmas and Easter. At Christmastime, a toy service is held where the congregation donate children's toys to a charity that gives them to less-fortunate families. Midnight mass is also celebrated on Christmas Eve, as well as a Christmas Day service. The church also holds Remembrance Sunday services alongside St. John's Ambulance. The church also has a pop-up shop every November and December for 'Cards for Good Causes' with profits going to numerous different charities. The church is a thriving community hotspot, home to different groups and organisations that use the church on a weekly basis. Groups include dance, yoga, Zumba, Bible study, a toddler's play group and Women's Institute.'Community Use', St. Andrew's URC Cardiff, 01 Sep 2019. Retrieved 2019-09-01.

In her review of Eternity, in Your Arms, Clash writer Dannii Leivers described \\"Suzanne\\" as \\"raging pop punk capable of uniting the hardcore kids, crusty punks and goths in one uber-alt mob\\", comparing it stylistically to preceding album track \\"Poison Pens\\". Anita Bhagwandas of the NME also categorised the track as pop punk, as well as likening Gould's vocals to those of Meat Loaf. Promotion and release After their performances at the Reading and Leeds Festivals in August 2016, Creeper \\"vanished\\" from the public eye and began sharing clues for fans to follow in order to obtain information regarding the band. The clues eventually led to an answerphone message which detailed \\"the disappearance of James Scythe\\", the fictional subject of several songs to be featured on the album. The message also featured the line \\"On the 2nd of October 2016, we'll die holding hands\\", a reference to a line in \\"Suzanne\\". When the band resurfaced on 2 October, \\"Suzanne\\" received its worldwide premiere on the BBC Radio 1 Rock Show with Daniel P. Carter. It was made available as a digital download the following day, when it was also given free to customers who pre-ordered Eternity, in Your Arms on the official Roadrunner Records store. The music video, directed by Jamie Carter, was also released the same day. According to TeamRock, the video combines \\"found footage belonging to the missing Scythe\\" with \\"neon-bathed performance\\" footage, was released on the same day. On 11 January 2017, the version of the song featured on music streaming service Spotify was changed to feature new lyrics. Critical reception Media response to \\"Suzanne\\" was positive. Tom Connick of DIY claimed that the song \\"takes every facet of Creeper's delicately constructed world and polishes it to a blinding shine\\", hailing it as \\"nothing short of dazzling\\". Clash writer Robin Murray praised the band's \\"inherent live energy\\" on the recording. Upset magazine's Ali Shutler described \\"Suzanne\\" as \\"Snarling and built for mass participation but doused in young romance and a touch of magic\\", claiming that it \\"sees Creeper reaching scary new heights all over again\\".

A military officer from 1914, Barth took part in Norwegian neutrality protection duties during the First World War, mostly at Oscarsborg Fortress. Remaining in military service after the end of the First World War, he served at several different Norwegian fortresses, finally at Fossumstr√∏ket Fortress in south-eastern Norway. In the inter-war years, Barth continued his military career, as well as working as a journalist, schoolteacher and book editor, and ran a small business. During the Second World War, Barth again took part in neutrality protection duties, until the German invasion of Norway in April 1940. Barth led the garrison of H√∏ytorp Fort, which fought the German invasion forces before being encircled and surrendering. Close to two years later, in 1942, Barth was arrested by the German occupying authorities and sent as a prisoner of war to Germany. In the post-war years, Barth was involved with officer associations, and edited several military professional magazines. In this role he was often critical of the political leadership of the Norwegian Armed Forces. Early and personal life Barth was born in Kristiania on 14 April 1892 to bank manager Christian Andreas Barth and Marie Georgine Antoinette Keyser. Having attended Oslo Cathedral School, he achieved his Examen artium student qualifications in 1910. He first married Frenchwoman Madelaine Marie Quernel in Paris on 6 July 1922, having had wedding celebrations at the H√¥tel Lutetia the day before. The couple had a son, born in Bordeaux in April 1923. The marriage was later dissolved. He remarried to Solveig Elfrida Bj√∏rnstad in Oslo, Norway, on 26 June 1926. Barth and his second wife had two sons together, the first born in Oslo in October 1931 and the second born in October 1936. Barth was a freemason, having joined the Lodge St. Olaus to the white Leopard in January 1917. Career He graduated as military officer from the Norwegian Military Academy in 1914, becoming a first lieutenant in the Fortress Artillery on 13 October 1914. He then graduated from the Norwegian Military College in 1919. During the First World War he saw service on neutrality protection duties, serving from 1914 to 1917 at Oscarsborg Fortress in the Oslofjord, then from 1917 to 1919 with the 2nd Fortress Company. In 1919 to 1920 he served at T√∏nsberg Fortifications, before returning to the 2nd Fortress Company in 1920 and staying with that unit until 16 November 1926, when he was promoted to the rank of captain and transferred to Agdenes Fortress in the Trondheimsfjord. With his transfer to Agdenes he assumed command of the 16th Fortress Company. In 1930 he again transferred, this time to Fossumstr√∏ket Fortress in the south-east of Norway. In connection with his military service he travelled to France for studies in 1921‚Äì1922, serving with the French Army's 157th Artillery Regiment and attending a French artillery school in Mailly. In 1924, 1927 and 1930 he again travelled in Europe for studies, visiting France, Italy and Germany. From 1935 to 1946 Barth was a member of the board of the Norwegian Army Regular Officers' Association. In addition to his military service, Barth had several civilian occupations. From 1920 to 1921 he worked as a schoolteacher, at a primary school in Kristiania and at his old secondary school Oslo Cathedral School. He also worked as chief of advertising at the advertising agency H√∏ydahl Ohme. Starting in 1924, he ran an agency business in Oslo. From 1924 to 1928 he worked as journalist, and was then working as a procurator at the finance magazine √òkonomisk Revue from 1928 to 1942. He edited the book Norges milit√¶re embedsmenn 1929 with biographies of Norwegian regular military officers, published in 1930. In 1924 he was the secretary of the Norwegian memorial committee for the Scandinavian Corps and the Battle of Magersfontein during the Second Boer War. In connection with his work on the committee, he was awarded the Swedish Magersfontein Memorial Medal. =Second World War= After the outbreak of the Second World War, Barth was mobilized on 22 January 1940 for neutrality protection duties at H√∏ytorp Fort, one of the forts belonging to Fossumstr√∏ket Fortress. At Fossumstr√∏ket Fortress he was the designated substitute for the fortress commander, Lieutenant Colonel Lauritz Rodtwitt, in cases where the commander was absent. Map of the Norwegian Campaign in the southern part of Norway, with the operations around Fossumstr√∏ket Fortress occurring in the far south-east When the Germans invaded Norway on 9 April 1940, Barth was in command of Fossumstr√∏ket Fortress' signals unit. Fossumstr√∏ket Fortress' two forts immediately began mobilizing, although at H√∏ytorp Fort this was hampered by ill-maintained and outdated fortifications and the poor quality of the other facilities. During the decade before 1940 the role of H√∏ytorp Fort had been changed to one as a mobilization area for field artillery rather than a defensible fortification. At Tr√∏gstad Fort artillery ammunition was in very short supply.Faye 1963, pp. 141‚Äì143. Captain Barth was placed in charge of H√∏ytorp Fort, and took direct command of the fort's two 12 cm turreted artillery pieces.Faye 1963, p. 224. After their initial landings along the coast, the Germans began their inland advance. The 196th Infantry Division was tasked with seizing the far south-east corner of Norway, including the Fossum area. The unit began its advance from Oslo on 12 April 1940.Faye 1963, pp. 152‚Äì153. When one of the advance columns of the 196th Infantry Division reached the Askim area on 13 April, the cannon at H√∏ytorp Fort opened fire to cover the retreat of the Norwegian 1st Division. In the course of two hours a total of 100 high-explosive shells were fired from the fort in an indirect area bombardment without the aid of observers. The artillery fire was estimated by the Norwegians as having been reasonably effective. Having expended their stocks of artillery ammunition, the fort's crew redeployed for defence of the interior of the fort. In a post-action report, Barth praised the crew of H√∏ytorp Fort for their \\"fire discipline and good attitude in action\\".Faye 1963, pp. 224‚Äì225. On 14 April 1940 Fossumstr√∏ket Fortress surrendered after a meeting of the fortress commander and six of the other officers, including Captain Barth. The officers held a vote and unanimously agreed that the fortress could not continue fighting. At the time the fortress was encircled and under machine gun and artillery fire, while the Norwegian 1st Division had retreated from the area and no longer needed the fortress' support. Barth stated in connection with his vote that the fortress was in an impossible tactical situation, and was manned by poorly trained and demoralized crews.Faye 1963, pp. 317‚Äì318. Barth and another officer were appointed to approach the German forces and begin surrender negotiations on behalf of the fortress commander. The fortress guns were rendered inoperable by the destruction of vital parts at 14:05, and a flag of truce was raised over the fortress at 14:16.Faye 1963, p. 318. In a report written in 1941, Lieutenant Colonel Rodtwitt praised Barth's efforts during the fighting, describing him as \\"loyal, devoted to duty, able and brave\\", pointing especially to his leadership of H√∏ytorp Fort during the fighting and to his \\"rescue of important documents\\" after the surrender of the fortress. Rodtwitt concluded his report by stating that under \\"normal circumstances\\" (rather than Norway being occupied) he would have recommended Barth for a promotion and an award. Barth was arrested by the Gestapo on 12 January 1942, held at the Grini detention camp from the day of his arrest. At Grini he was assigned prisoner number 1234. He was transferred as a prisoner of war to the officers' camp Oflag XXI-C in Skoki in German-annexed Poland on 5 February 1942. At Oflag XXI-C Barth was prisoner number 22, as one of the first officers to have been sent to the camp. He was released from captivity on 28 September 1942, due to having fallen severely ill during his captivity. (a separate appendix to ) For his wartime service, Barth was decorated with the Defence Medal 1940‚Äì1945. In addition he had the Det frivillige Skyttervesen rifle association's silver medal. =Post-war years= In the post-war years, Barth edited the periodical V√•r H√¶r from 1946 to 1964, and Norges Forsvar from 1964 to 1966. V√•r H√¶r was published by the Norwegian Army Regular Officers' Association and spoke on behalf of the association's members, while Norges Forsvar was and still is the magazine of the Norges Forsvarsforening (Norwegian Defence Association). In a 1946 leader, V√•r H√¶r criticized the Norwegian Minister of Defence, Jens Christian Hauge and demanded his resignation. The resignation demand, which included claims that Hauge had ignored the advice of military professionals and involved himself too much in the details of military matters in the post-war reconstruction of the Norwegian Armed Forces, led to a debate in the national newspapers. Barth stated in the debate that \\"most army officers\\" would agree with the criticism of Hauge. In the debate Barth was himself criticised by the Norwegian Army Officers' Association which said it was too soon to judge minister Hauge's efforts, and that Barth's statements were too broad in nature. In the following years criticism of defence minister Hauge leadership increased among officers, media and politicians, and ended with Hauge announcing his resignation in late 1951. Barth wrote an editorial in V√•r H√¶r after Hauge's resignation where he stated that in his view the defence minister had had \\"increasingly dictatorial tendencies over the years\\" and \\"lacked an ability to cooperate\\". Barth was given an honourable discharge from the Norwegian Armed Forces on 15 April 1952. His last military position was at Fossumstr√∏ket Fortress. Barth had applied unsuccessfully for several positions during his last seven years in the Norwegian Armed Forces, the first of his post-war applications being to the position of general inspector and commander of the Norwegian coastal artillery service in 1945. In 1946, the officer appointed to the position for which Barth had applied the previous year, Colonel Gunnar Isaachsen Willoch, recommended that Barth should be promoted to the rank of colonel and given command of the coastal artillery in Western Norway. However, due to a bureaucratic mistake Barth was considered by the Commanding Admiral of the Royal Norwegian Navy, Admiral Elias Corneliussen, to be disqualified due to his age and another officer given the position. Admiral Corneliussen and army general Halvor Hansson had interpreted the age regulations for promotion to the rank of colonel without taking into account Barth's war service, which would have enabled him to be qualified for a promotion despite his age. Barth sent a written complaint after being disqualified. A parliamentary investigative commission concluded months later that Barth had been qualified for the position, and should be considered for other similar positions. Barth's case was brought up at the Storting (Parliament of Norway) in 1948 by Conservative Party politician Carl P. Wright, who stated that Barth should be given the next coastal artillery position that became available. Minister of Defence Jens Christian Hauge replied to Wright's statement by pointing out that Barth had been removed from consideration quite early in the process in 1946 due to the mistake made regarding age limits, but that he was now free to apply for and be considered for any military position. Wright brought up once more the cases of Barth and several other officers who claimed to have been unreasonably bypassed, in 1949. In 1948 Barth applied unsuccessfully for the position of commander of Coastal Artillery Brigade Eastern Norway. The next year he applied unsuccessfully for the position of director of the Norwegian Defence University College, and also for the position as military attach√© at the Norwegian embassies in Copenhagen and Stockholm. He died on 23 April 1972 at the age of 80, having lived at Akersborg terrasse in Oslo. He was buried on 5 June 1972 at Vestre Aker Cemetery in Oslo.
