English:Frederiksberg Circus) is a space in front of the main entrance to Frederiksberg Gardens, at the end of Frederiksberg All√©, in the Frederiksberg district of Copenhagen, Denmark. History Changing horses at Frederiksberg Runddel, 1863 Horse carriages in front of the main entrance to Frederiksberg Gardens Frederiksberg Runddel, which in spite of its name has never been particularly round, was established around 1670, when Queen Sophie Amalie had a small summer residence built on the site where the main entrance to Frederiksberg Gardens now stands. The three-winged property became known as the Prince' House (da. Prinsens G√•rd) after it was passed on to Crown Prince Frederik (IV) who later, after his ascent to the throne, replaced it with Frederiksberg Palace on a nearby hilltop. Nicolai Eigtved converted the south wing to an orangerie in 1744. After the main wing burnt down in 1753, it was not rebuilt, but instead the main entrance to Frederiksberg Have was established in 1755 between the two surviving wings. On 22 October 1863, the English-owned Copenhagen Railway Company opened the first tram line in Copenhagen which ran from Frederiksberg Runddel along Frederiksberg All√© and present day Str√∏get to Sankt Ann√¶ Plads in the city centre. Buildings and features The main entrance to Frederiksberg Gardens =Park main entrance= The entrance gate to Frederiksberg Gardens was built in 1755 after the fire two years earlier.

His many sermons and theological treatises had a significant influence on the Puritan movement in England. Life He was probably born about 1535, and went at a late age to the University of Cambridge where he matriculated as a sizar of Pembroke Hall on 27 May 1559. He graduated B.A. early in 1564, and was elected Fellow, proceeding M.A. in 1567. His Puritanism was moderate: he had scruples about vestments, and strong views about such abuses as non- residence, but was more concerned for the substance of religion and the co- operation of all religious men within the Church than for theories of ecclesiastical government. His name, 'Richardus Grenham,' is appended with twenty-one others to the letters (3 July and 11 Aug. 1570), asking Lord Burghley, the Chancellor, to reinstate Thomas Cartwright in his office as Lady Margaret's divinity reader. Daniel Neal's statement that at a subsequent period he declared his approbation of Cartwright's 'book of discipline' (1584) is somewhat suspect; but John Strype says he was at one of Cartwright's synods. On 24 November 1570 he was instituted to the rectory of Dry Drayton, Cambridgeshire. He used to still preach at St Mary's, Cambridge, where he reproved young divines for engaging in controversies, as tantamount to rearing a roof before laying a foundation. In his parish he preached frequently, choosing the earliest hours of the morning for sermon before the work of the day. He devoted Sunday evenings and Thursday mornings to catechizing. He had some divinity pupils, including Henry Smith. During a period of dearth, when barley was ten groats a bushel, he devised a plan for selling corn cheap to the poor, no family being allowed to buy more than three pecks in a week. He cheapened his straw, preached against the public order for lessening the capacity of the bushel, and got into trouble by refusing to let the clerk of the market cut down his measure with the rest. His unworldliness meant that his wife had to borrow money to pay his harvestmen. Richer livings were steadily declined by him. Nevertheless, he was not appreciated by his flock. He was cited for nonconformity by Richard Cox, bishop of Ely; Cox asked him whether the guilt of schism lay with conformists or with nonconformists. Greenham answered that, if both parties acted in a spirit of concord, it would lie with neither; otherwise with those who made the rent. Cox gave him no further trouble. His 'Apologie or Aunswere' is in 'A Parte of a Register' (1593), p. 86 sq. On the appearance of the Marprelate tracts (1589) he preached against them at St. Mary's, on the ground that their tendency was 'to make sin ridiculous, whereas it ought to be made odious.' His friends were anxious to get him to London. He resigned his living about 1591, having held it for about twenty years‚Äîhe told Warfield, his successor, 'I perceive noe good wrought by my ministerie on any but one familie.' He settled as preacher at Christ Church, Newgate. In 1592 (if Marsden is right) appeared his 'Treatise of the Sabboth,' of which Thomas Fuller says that 'no book in that age made greater impression on peoples practice.' The second of two sonnets (1599) on Greenham by Joseph Hall, is a tribute; it was the earliest of the Puritan treatises on the observance of the Lord's day, more moderate than the 'Sabbathvm' (1595) of his step-son Nicholas Bownde, who borrowed from Greenham. Greenham was one of the most famous and well known Elizabethan Puritan ministers of his time, and close friends with other great Puritan divines, such as Laurence Chaderton, Richard Rogers, and William Perkins. Greenham had a significant influence on the rise of English Puritanism through his many sermons and theological treatises. Death Samuel Clarke says Greenham died about 1591, in about his sixtieth year, while Fuller says his death was unrecorded, because he died of the plague which raged in 1592. It is mentioned by Waddington that on 2 April 1593 Greenham visited John Penry in the Poultry Compter. Henry Holland implies that he survived the affair of Lopez, February‚ÄìJune 1594. Works Greenham's Workes were collected and edited by H.H., i.e. Henry Holland, in 1599; a second edition appeared in the same year; the third edition was 1601, reprinted 1605 and 1612 ('fift and last' edition). 'A Garden of Spiritual Flowers,' by Greenham, was published 1612, and several times reprinted, till 1687. It is doubtful whether Greenham himself published anything, or left anything ready for the press. Of his 'Treatise of the Sabboth,' which had been circulated privately, Holland found three copies, and edited the best. It was originally a sermon or sermons; and the remaining works (excepting a catechism) are made up from sermon material, with some additions from Greenham's conversation. Family He married the widow of Robert Bownde, M.D., physician to the Duke of Norfolk, but had no issue; his step-daughter, Anne Bownde, was the first wife of John Dod.

Globe Derby Park was named after the stallion Globe Derby, who was considered the most influential Standardbred sire in Australian and New Zealand during the late 1960s. Harness racing in Adelaide was previously held at the 510-metre long Wayville Showground from 1934 until all Adelaide meetings moved to Globe Derby Park on 14 April 1973. This was necessary as unlike Wayville, Globe Derby did not have lights installed for night racing until that date.

Races are run in an anti-clockwise direction. Race meetings are held at Globe Derby Park every Saturday night and Monday afternoon of the week, and Friday nights as well during winter. Races are held all year round. Major race events include the Summer Carnival being held in January, Ladies Night Out in March, the Media Cup Night every May, and the Trotters Carnival held every June. There are full TAB facilities and bookmakers on site. Meetings are broadcast on Radio TAB. Other facilities include a large grassed area close to the action, trackside dining, and a bar.  Redevelopment  In 2014, plans were drawn up to develop a portion of the Globe Derby Park land alongside Port Wakefield Road. In December 2017, the South Australian Harness Racing Club voted to sell off 70 per cent of Globe Derby Park to investment company GIC. This was a much larger land area than the initial plans in 2014 included, and it led to protests by some local residents.thumb See also *Harness racing in Australia References External links *Harness Racing SA page @ Australian Harness Racing *Globe Derby Park page @ Australian Harness Racing Category:Harness racing in Australia Category:Horse racing venues in Australia Category:Sports venues in Adelaide Category:Sports venues completed in 1969 Category:1969 establishments in Australia ","title":"Globe Derby Park (harness racing)"},{"id":"30556785","text":"Globe Derby Park is a suburb of Adelaide, South Australia.

It is native to the floodplains along the Illinois and Mississippi Rivers in the United States, where the habitat has been drastically altered, leading to its decline. The plant was once distributed across 400 kilometers of riverside forest from LaSalle, Illinois, to St. Louis, Missouri.USFWS. Determination of threatened status for Boltonia decurrens. Federal Register November 14, 1988. As the rivers and riparian habitat alongside them have been developed, the plant's distribution has been fragmented into about 20 separate populations, mostly in Illinois.The Nature Conservancy At one point it was thought to have been extirpated from Missouri, but a few populations have been located near St. Louis since the mid-1980s.Center for Plant Conservation Despite having declined over time, several populations of the plant contain many thousands of individuals. Populations vary depending on the amount and duration of flooding that occurs in the area each year. The plant is a federally listed threatened species. This plant was long treated as a variety of Boltonia asteroides until 1985, when it was elevated to species status, a status it had held once before.Schwegman, J. E. and R. W. Nyboer. (1985). The taxonomic and population atatus of Boltonia decurrens (Torr. & Gray) Wood. Castanea 50:2 112. It is a bushy perennial herb sprawling to 1.5 meters in height, often exceeding two meters. The leaves are decurrent, their bases extending down the stem at their attachment. The blades are up to 15 centimeters long and linear or lance- shaped. The inflorescence is a large panicle of leafy branches and many flower heads with white or pale purple ray florets measuring 1 to 2 centimeters long. The center contains many yellow disc florets. Flowering occurs in August through October. The plant reproduces vegetatively by growing new shoots and sexually by making seed. The species produces a large amount of seeds, averaging 50,000 per plant. The seeds are dispersed on the water, particularly during floods. In general the plant is adapted to floods; it has been noted to grow underwater, produce an inflorescence above the surface, bloom and produce seeds in flooded conditions. The seeds germinate when they fall on wet substrate, or sometimes while they are still floating about on the water.Ketzner, D., et al. (2003). Results from the decurrent false aster recovery project FAP 999 and FAP 14, Madison and St. Clair Counties, Illinois. Illinois Natural History Survey. Today the land next to the rivers is protected with many flood control methods, and natural floodplain activity occurs in few places. The riverside landscape has been modified into cropland, with marshes and prairies drained, walled off, and plowed. The rivers are contained with levees, controlled by locks, and accessed via marinas. While the plant is adapted to periodic flooding, its seedlings can only germinate and grow in clear water that allows sunlight in; flooding that occurs now is more likely to be turbid with silt, a condition the plant cannot tolerate. Recent large floods have been noted to deposit thick layers of silt, destroying plants. Also, the disturbance of flooding is rare enough now that riversides become overgrown with brush, shading out the plants in a similar way. In fact, in some areas the plant now depends on periodic human disturbance, such as mowing, to clear away the brush the way severe natural flooding once did. Population sizes vary depending on the amount of disturbance, such as flooding, occurring in the area. Populations have been noted to contain anywhere between one plant and one million plants or more, and some populations disappear for a time. Several populations of the plant were noted to increase after the Great Flood of 1993, with the most severely swamped populations growing most.Smith, M., et al. (1998).

The office of Maharaja became hereditary among the descendants of Ala Singh until Phul, the Sikh ancestor of the dynasty, which came to rule over Patiala, Jind, and Nabha. =Early history= The history of Patiala state starts off with the ancestor of the Sikh Patiala Royal House, Mohan Singh being harassed by neighbouring Bhullar and Dhaliwal farmers . They would not allow Mohan to settle there. He was a follower of Guru Hargobind Sahib and the Guru appealed on behalf of Mohan but to no avail. The result was an armed struggle and the Bhullars and Dhaliwals were defeated by the Guru's men, which allowed Mohan to establish the Village of Meharaj in 1627.A History of Sikh Misals, Dr Bhagat Singh Battle of Mehraj Mohan Singh fought against the Mughals at the Battle of Mehraj 1631 on the side of Guru Hargobind Sahib. Mohan Singh and his eldest son Rup Chand were later killed in a fight against the Bhatti's (a tribe who also claim to be the descendants of Rawal Jaisal of Jaisalmer, but also an enemy of the Phulkians). Kala, Mohan's younger son succeeded the \\"chaudriyat\\", and was guardian to Rup Chand's sons Phul and Sandali. Phul When Kala Sidhu died, Phul formed his own village (Phul), five miles from Meharaj (under the blessings of Sikh Guru's) in 1663. Nabha and Jind trace their ancestry to the devout Sikh Phul. It was one of the first Sikh Kingdoms of Punjab to be formed. Apparently the appellation of dynasty \\"Phulkian\\" is derived from their common founder. One of his sons, Chota Ram, was baptised and blessed by Guru Gobind Singh. His son Ala Singh assumed the leadership in 1714 when Banda Bahadur was engaged in the fierce battle against the Mughals. A man with vision and courage, Ala Singh's general, Gurbaksh Singh Kaleka, carved out an independent principality from a Zamindari of 30 villages. Under his successors, it expanded into a large state, touching the Shivaliks in north, Rajasthan in the south and upper courses of the Yamuna and Sutlej rivers while confronting the most trying and challenging circumstances. =Baba Ala Singh= In the middle of the eighteenth century, Baba Ala Singh, unlike many of his contemporaries, displayed tremendous shrewdness in dealing with the Marathas and Afghans, and successfully established a state which he had started building up from its nucleus Barnala. He became traitor to the Sikhs, who made him a Sardar from a peasant and fought on the side of Ahmad Shah Abdali against the Sikhs . =Qila Mubarak= The main gate of the Qila Mubarak. In 1763 Baba Ala Singh laid the foundation of the Patiala fort known as Qila Mubarak, around which the present city of Patiala developed. After the Third Battle of Panipat in 1761 in which the Marathas were defeated, the writ of the Afghans prevailed throughout Punjab. It is at this stage that the rulers of Patiala began to acquire ensigns of royalty. Ahmad Shah Abdali bestowed upon Ala Singh furm and banner, and the title of Maharaja of Patiala. After his death, his grandson Amar Singh succeeded and received the title of Raja-I-Rajaan. He was also allowed to strike coins. =Treaty with the British= After forty years of ceaseless struggle with the Marathas and Afghans, the borders of the Patiala state witnessed the blazing trails of Ranjit Singh in the north and of the British in the east. Bestowed with the grit and instinct of survival, making self-preservation a priority the Raja of Patiala entered into a treaty with the British against Ranjit Singh in 1808, thus becoming collaborators in the empire building process of the British in the sub-continent of India. The subsequent rulers of Patiala, such as Karam Singh, Narinder Singh, Mahendra Singh, Rajinder Singh, Bhupinder Singh, and Yadvindra Singh were parties to a subsidiary alliance and were heavily influenced by the British, but retained the internal government of their state. =Maharaja Bhupinder Singh= Maharaja Bhupinder Singh of Patiala Maharaja Bhupinder Singh, who reigned from 1900 to 1938, gave Patiala a prominent place on the political map of India and also in the field of international sports. In the game of Polo, Patiala had the World's best Polo Back, General Chanda Singh, who later went on to play for England and Spain on the requests of King Edward VII and King Alfonso of Spain, winning both Kings a prestigious Polo Cup. The Maharaja was also fond of dogs, and he and the Maharaja Ranbir Singh of Jind were equally interested in a range of dog breeds. His son Maharaja Yadavindra Singh was the first Indian prince to sign the Instrument of Accession to the new Union of India, thus facilitating the process of national integration after the Partition of India and the departure of the British in August 1947. In recognition of his services, he was appointed as Rajpramukh of the newly established Patiala and East Punjab States Union (PEPSU), from its founding in 1948 until its merger with the Punjab Province in 1956. The downtown area of Patiala is called Adalat Bazaar, which means 'the court corridor', because this was used as the administrative building by one of the caretaker rulers, before Maharaja Bhupinder Singh had reached the age of majority. Rajmata Mohinder Kaur was the oldest member of the family till 2017, and the present head is Amarinder Singh, current chief minister of Punjab. =Rulers= Maharaja Mahendra Singh of Patiala.

Until the outbreak of First World War, New End Hospital's patients included the unemployed, homeless, and unmarried mothers, and their children. It also had an infirmary for the treatment of psychiatric patients. During the First World War New End Hospital was primarily used for the treatment of wounded and shell-shocked soldiers. The hospital was taken over by the London County Council in 1930, and became well known as a centre for endocrinology. It joined the National Health Service in 1948 under the management of the North East Metropolitan Regional Hospital Board.

The state bordered the Gilgit Agency to the south, the former princely state of Yasin to the west, Ishkoman to the north and Afghanistan (Wakhan Corridor) to the northwest. The state capital was the town of Sher Qila. The area of Punial now forms the above named tehsil of Ghizer District. Punial was an independent principality for several centuries. The British gained control of the area and the neighbouring valleys by mid 19th century followed by a military engagement of severe intensity.

Raja Nasir ul Din of puniyal Raja Nasir ul Din alias Jan Alam grandson of Esa Bahdur and the last ruler of Brosh dynasty in Punial. Jan Alam sustained two out of three uprisings against the autocratic rule by people of Punial. The first uprising was in 1895 which resulted in the First Constitution (Dastoor ul amal ) of Punial in 1898 by Raj. Second uprising was instigated by father of Jan Alam (Raja Anwar Khan) the ruler himself to contain his cousin Khan Bahdur by depriving him from the privileges given in the first dastoor ul amal in 1935. This uprising resulted in amendments in the first dastoor and abolished various categories of people like Darkkhan, Raihat and gushpur etc. The third uprising in 1951 was initiated by Syeds (father and uncle of Pir Karam Ali Shah). The uprising suppressed for the time being but it was converted into a movement and spread over to other regions like Nagar and resulted into end of autocratic rule in 1971 by Bhutto as part of his nationwide reforms by abolishing the princely states.

It is located southwest of Tierra Amarilla, New Mexico. It was closed in 1959. History In late 1951 Air Defense Command selected this site near El Vado, New Mexico, as one of twenty-eight radar stations built as part of the second segment of the permanent radar surveillance network. Prompted by the start of the Korean War, on July 11, 1950, the Secretary of the Air Force asked the Secretary of Defense for approval to expedite construction of the second segment of the permanent network. Receiving the Defense Secretary's approval on July 21, the Air Force directed the Corps of Engineers to proceed with construction. On 27 November 1950 the 767th Aircraft Control and Warning Squadron was activated at El Vado, New Mexico (L-44). The unit was later installed at the permanent site (LP-8) several miles to the north-northeast that was activated to provide coverage for Los Alamos National Laboratory. On 1 December 1953, the site was renamed Tierra Amarilla Air Force Station.Cornett and Johnson, A Handbook of Aerospace Defense Organization 1946‚Äì1980, p. 101 By September 1952, the 767th AC&W; Squadron commenced operation at this new permanent site, and initially the station functioned as a ground-control intercept (GCI) and warning station. As a GCI station, the squadron's role was to guide interceptor aircraft toward unidentified intruders picked up on the unit's radar scopes. The remoteness of the site from larger cities called for provision of activities at the site. A basketball league played on an outdoor court. Bingo nights and movies contributed to squadron morale. In 1953, an indoor gymnasium was constructed to provide year-round physical recreation. In the mid-1950s, the Air Force leased land for trailers for families. By 1953 AN/FPS-3 and AN/FPS-5 radars were in operation. A year before the site shut down, the AN/FPS-5 was replaced by an AN/FPS-6 height-finder radar. On 8 February 1959 the station was ordered closed and the squadron was inactivated. This became the first radar of the permanent ADC network to shut down. In 1961 the station was acquired by the State of New Mexico. The New Mexico Forestry and Resource Conservation Division occupied the site briefly, but it was ultimately abandoned, and turned over to Northern New Mexico Community College (NNMCC) by the New Mexico State Legislature for educational purposes. Northern New Mexico Community College, the owner of the site, did not have the resources to develop the site and operate it. The site was never used again. The former Tierra Amarilla Air Force Station was placed on the National Register of Historic Places on February 26, 2001. It was one of the first New Mexico sites from the Cold War to be nominated. Today, the site is abandoned with many decrepit buildings standing in various states of decay. It has all the appearance of a ghost town, unused for the past 50 years.

Biography Philip William was the eldest son of the Great Elector and his second wife, Princess Sophia Dorothea of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Gl√ºcksburg. One of her major endeavours was to ensure the financial security of her sons, mostly by the purchase of land. Shortly after the birth of Philip William, he was invested with his mother's dominion of Schwedt, later, the Brandenburg-Prussian government added the lands of Wildenbruch. Both dominions were improved by Princess Dorothea's care and investments. Following the death of his mother, Philip, in an accord of dating to 3 March 1692, reached agreement with his half-brother, the Elector Friedrich III, about income and lands left to him by the Great Elector, including the lordship, without sovereignty, of Halberstadt. Philip received for himself and his descendants guaranteed appanages generating an income of 24,000 thalers each year. Added revenue came in to the amount of 22,000 thalers from the rule of Schwedt, plus military salaries of about 20,000 thalers, so that with a total income of 66,000 crowns he was enabled to hold court, in some style, himself. He held, like all the male members of his house, the courtesy title, Margrave of Brandenburg. After the coronation of his elder brother, Frederick, he became Prince in Prussia, Margrave of Brandenburg with the style Royal Highness. The nomenclature \\"Brandenburg- Schwedt\\" came into use in the 19th Century, posthumously, to distinguish the lords of Schwedt from the main line of the Hohenzollerns. Philip William was the ancestor of the Schwedt branch of the Royal House of Hohenzollern. On 25 January 1699 Philip Wilhelm married Princess Johanna Charlotte of Anhalt- Dessau (1682‚Äì1750), daughter of John George II, Prince of Anhalt-Dessau. As a widow she became Abbess of the Imperial Abbey of Herford. Philipp Wilhelm served as a general in the campaigns against France and was promoted in 1697 to Inspector-General of the artillery. His half-brother, Prince Elector Friedrich III (later King Frederick I of Prussia), also gave him the proprietership of several regiments. During his time as governor of Magdeburg, he was raised by the University of Halle (Saale) to the post of \\"Rector magnificentissimus‚Äù. Philip's Berlin residence, the Margrave Weilersche Palace, was later used by Kaiser Wilhelm I. He was buried in the Berlin Cathedral, where most of the senior members of the House of Hohenzollern are buried. Since Philip's eldest son, Frederick William, was a minor at his death, the King of Prussia (Frederick I and Frederick William I) took over guardianship. With the death of his granddaughter, Anna Elisabeth Luise, the collateral line of Brandenburg-Schwedt became extinct in 1820.

The series was written by Peter Milligan and published by DC Comics; it lasted for 70 issues, from July 1990 to April 1996. The final 37 issues were published under the company's Vertigo imprint for mature readers. Shade, the Changing Man chronicles the adventures of Rac Shade, an alien from the planet Meta who becomes stuck in the body of Troy Grenzer, a convicted serial killer. The series' long-term story arc focuses on the relationship between Shade and Kathy George, a girl whose parents were killed by Grenzer. The series explores the themes of identity and love triangles, while offering a critique of American culture. Milligan conceived Shade, the Changing Man after writing Skreemer, his first comic for DC. Editor Karen Berger asked Milligan to start working on a new series; Milligan chose to write about Shade, who had been created for a short-lived series by Steve Ditko in 1977. Milligan sought to differentiate his series from Ditko's: he only used elements of Shade he deemed necessary and took the character in a different direction. Numerous artists contributed to the series throughout its run; the most recurring was Chris Bachalo, who illustrated 38 issues. Shade, the Changing Man has been called one of the most innovative comics ever published and one of Milligan's finest works. Reviewers found its take on the superhero genre bizarre and unconventional, and offered lavish praise for its originality and characters. Milligan considers it the series he is best known for, and has returned to write new stories about Shade on several occasions. The series was adapted as part of Cartoon Network's DC Nation Shorts in 2013. A spiritual successor, Shade, the Changing Girl, began in 2016, published under DC's Young Animal imprint. Synopsis Rac Shade, an alien poet from the planet Meta, is recruited by Changemaster Wisor to become a Changing Man. Shade is deceived into traveling to Earth, causing his body on Meta to rot. As humans die when taken over by a Changing Man, Shade possesses Troy Grenzer, a serial killer about to be executed. Shade befriends Kathy George, whose parents were murdered by Grenzer, and Lenny Shapiro. He also must avoid law enforcement, who believe he is still Grenzer. Shade's first mission on Earth is to fight the American Scream‚Äîactually Agent Rohug, another Metan Changing Man who went insane after undergoing deep-culture-tank training focusing on American culture‚Äîand stop the madness of Meta from flowing into Earth. Shade also battles with Grenzer, as a portion of his conscience survived and repeatedly tries to retake his body. Shade also develops an alter-ego, Hades, who causes Shade to give in to his own desires. After the first storyline, the series shifted its focus to telling the love story about Shade and Kathy. Shade is killed, but his spirit is transferred to the body of a recently murdered red-headed woman. After further strange adventures, Shade is killed again, but angels force him to return to Earth and do their bidding. They provide him with a human host created for just such an occasion. The strain of death and the afterlife cause Shade's mind to become both unhinged and combined with that of Hades. Thus, Shade has no permanent hold on sanity and will bounce from impulsive mania to thoughtful collection quickly. He reunites with Lenny and Kathy, opens the Hotel Shade, and meets John Constantine. Kathy and Shade also have a child. Kathy is eventually killed. Shade becomes a red- head again, but this time with a short mod cut. Lost in mourning, he removes himself from his old life and moves to the city, where he befriends a deaf dancer and the alleged reincarnation of Nikola Tesla. He also attempts to bond with his son only to find that the child is suffering from a fast-aging disease. Tired of suffering, Shade removes his heart and locks it in a metal box, becoming more apathetic to surrounding characters and events. Shade eventually loses control of the Madness, which begins feeding on his subconscious and maiming and killing innocents. Desperate to put things right, Shade gathers his remaining colleagues and develops a time machine. The resulting struggles are met with limited success‚ÄîShade's son, for instance, finds himself trapped in a female body‚Äîbut Shade is reunited with Kathy. Themes and analysis Shade, the Changing Man has been noted for its commentary on American culture. The second issue (August 1990), for example, is devoted to discussing the assassination of John F. Kennedy and the trauma it caused. Also, the American Scream represents everything bad about American culture infecting the entire world. Themes featured in the comic included racial tensions, gun violence, homelessness, and capital punishment. Many of the topics the series dealt with were controversial and distinct from other comics at the time, among them transgenderism. Issue #42 (December 1993) features Shade, Kathy, and Lenny arguing about abortion; Shade is horrified it is legal, let alone that it exists. Other common themes were identity‚Äîwith the series exploring what it means to be human and facing the consequences of others' actions‚Äîand the love triangle between Shade, Kathy, and Lenny. Composition and development =Background= Rac Shade was created by Steve Ditko in 1977 for his series Shade, the Changing Man, published by DC Comics. In the series, Shade was depicted as resident of the planet Meta who is falsely accused of murder and uses the power of his \\"M-Vest\\" to protect himself with a force field and project the illusion of becoming a large grotesque version of himself. The series only lasted for eight issues, as it was one of DC's books that fell victim to the company's sudden 1978 cancellation of over two dozen comics. By 1990, Shade was a regular character in John Ostrander's Suicide Squad (1987‚Äì1992). However, comics historian Matthew K. Manning regarded the character as obscure and unknown to most readers. During the late 1980s, DC editor Karen Berger began to recruit writers from the United Kingdom, such as Neil Gaiman, Grant Morrison, and Peter Milligan; Berger \\"found their sensibility and point of view to be refreshingly different, edgier and smarter\\". Gaiman began with Black Orchid, while Morrison wrote Animal Man and Doom Patrol. Then known for his stories in 2000 A.D. (1977‚Äìpresent), Milligan's first work for DC was a post-apocalyptic gangster series called Skreemer. =Production= After completing Skreemer, Milligan went on a brief hiatus from writing and began traveling across the United States. Berger asked Milligan to start writing a new series. Milligan chose to write a series about Shade, who he was fascinated by: \\"I thought, 'My God, to take on this character'... I liked the idea of changing. I liked the idea of madness. I liked the idea of madness almost like a force for change. ... I heard someone say a really good thing about schizophrenics... that, ah, for most people, schizophrenia is a break down, every now and again it's a breakthrough. The idea that madness can be a breakthrough.\\" Milligan also thought the character was \\"nebulous enough for me to really put my stamp on.\\" Though a self-proclaimed fan of Ditko's work, Milligan sought to distance his Shade from the character in the original series. Milligan retained elements he believed were necessary to the character (his \\"wacky\\" backstory and powers emphasizing madness) but took some of the character's qualities in a different direction. This allowed Milligan enough creative freedom to put his mark on Shade. Milligan views his Shade as a homage to Ditko's work rather than a direct continuation. As Shade, the Changing Man progressed, Milligan felt as if its narrative was becoming dry. He praised assistant editor Shelly Roeburg for telling him how innovative she thought it was. Milligan described the series as a whole as \\"a weird road movie with a girl and an alien\\". One of Milligan's desires for Shade, the Changing Man was to offer a critique of the United States, particularly at a personal level. Milligan felt as if England had become \\"culturally dwarfed\\" by the US, and thought that the series offered him the opportunity to portray how he viewed the United States and its culture. Milligan said he typically came up with stories between one and two months before writing them. He preferred to \\"know where the story's going\\", but also liked \\"to be surprised by the characters.\\" Milligan would typically notify his editors of what he planned for the series some time before publication, for advertising. One common request among fans was for Milligan to write a crossover with Shade meeting other DC characters, such as the Doom Patrol or the Sandman. Milligan joked that he wrote the storyline involving John Constantine when he realized the requests had died down. During its initial run, the series was established as taking place within the DC Universe (DCU), the shared, fictional universe that most of DC's publications take place in. The 2005 book Crisis on Infinite Earths: The Compendium declared the series non-canon to the DCU, having taken place in the same world as Elseworlds comics such as Batman: League of Batmen and Shazam: The New Beginning. Multiple artists contributed to the series throughout its run. The most recurring was Chris Bachalo, who illustrated a total of 38 issues. Other regular artists were Glyn Dillon, Colleen Doran, Philip Bond, Mark Buckingham, Sean Phillips, Michael Lark, Richard Case, and Jamie Tolagson. Bill Jaaska, Bryan Talbot, Jan Duursema, Brendan McCarthy, Duncan Eagleson, Peter Gross, Scot Eaton, Steve Yeowell, and Andy Pritchett each made the art for single issues. Mark Pennington, Rick Bryant, Pablo Marcos, Dick Giordano, Rafael Kayanan, and Phil Gascoine inked the series, while Daniel Vozzo and David Hornung were colorists and Albert de Guzman, Richard Starkings, and Sean Konot were letterers. Release and reception =Publication history= The final thirty-seven issues of Shade, the Changing Man were published under DC's Vertigo imprint The first issue of Shade, the Changing Man was published in July 1990. The series was part of DC's line of comics bearing an advisory \\"Suggested for Mature Readers\\" label on its cover, joining Hellblazer (1988‚Äì2013), Batman: The Killing Joke (1988), and The Sandman (1989‚Äì1996), among others. The series' first story arc was a lengthy, eighteen-issue tale called \\"The American Scream\\", detailing Shade's first adventures on Earth and his battle with the American Scream. The series was initially published with the traditional \\"DC Bullet\\" logo. In 1993, Berger started a new imprint for DC, Vertigo, to focus on publishing comics aimed at mature readers. Issue #33 (March 1993) was the first issue of Shade, the Changing Man published under the Vertigo imprint. Milligan has reportedly said he wanted the series to end after issue #50 (August 1994). However, it continued for another two years, ending with issue #70 (April 1996). The series was popular in the United States and, according to Milligan, it sold well. Shade, the Changing Man is yet to be completely reprinted in trade paperback. Only issues #1 through #19 (which comprise \\"The American Scream\\" and a Christmas special) have been collected, through three separate books. The rest of the series (issues #20 to #70) has never been rereleased. =Reviews= Shade, the Changing Man is remembered as one of Milligan's greatest works and one of the most innovative comics ever published. Many critics noted Shade, the Changing Mans bizarre, psychedelic, and unconventional take on superheroics. Hilary Goldstein (IGN) wrote that, out of all the strange comics DC published under Vertigo, Shade, the Changing Man was \\"the biggest headtrip of them all\\". Glen Weldon and Petra Mayer (NPR) took this notion further, believing the series' intent was to challenge the standard clich√©s of superhero comics. In an interview with MTV, Milligan said he thought the series is the one he is most known for. Reviewers were quick to point out the series' emphasis on madness. Reviewing \\"The American Scream\\", Publishers Weekly said this mobilized Shade, the Changing Mans outlandish premise in a short time. Brian Salvatore (Multiversity Comics) was more exclamatory: \\"What starts off as a straight tale of a murder and punishment quickly turns into a metaphysical mind fuck ... almost without warning.\\" Goldstein compared the series to reading a fairy tale-like dream, and expressed disappointment the collection he read ended so quickly. The series' commentary on America was widely noted, and Burgas found the series offered much more than just being bizarre, from love triangles to identity. The characterization of Shade and Kathy has been acclaimed. Goldstein thought Shade provided readers \\"the first step into the wonderful madness of [the series].\\" Brian Cronin (Comic Book Resources) called their pairing unusual (being a na√Øve poet and a depressed girl), and Publishers Weekly wrote the duo were well-crafted, empathetic, and said their pairing was perfect. Salvatore considered Kathy the series' true protagonist, calling her powerful considering the circumstances she faces. Burgas declared their relationship \\"one of the most magnificent love stories in comics\\". Bachalo's art was generally praised, and his work on Shade, the Changing Man has been called his breakthrough. Goldstein found the art less refined than some of Bachalo's later work, which he thought had \\"a more appealing, unprocessed look to it.\\" Salvatore called the art fluid and realistic, yet surreal. He said that, compared to future Bachalo art, Shade, the Changing Man clearly showed who influenced the illustrations (specifically Sam Kieth), giving it a rawness he found satisfactory. Publishers Weekly wrote the \\"expressionistic artwork and surreal tendencies perfectly complement Milligan's story\\". Burgas offered praise for Vozzo's digital coloring, feeling it enhanced the impact of Bachalo's art. However, Burgas felt that almost none of the series' artists lived up to the standards set by Bachalo, the exception being McCarthy. Burgas wrote that, after \\"The American Scream\\", Milligan turned his focus from storytelling to the romance between Shade and Kathy‚Äîdifferentiating it from the majority of Vertigo's comics. Burgas thought this caused the book to meander and thought this was frustrating. He stated issues released after Kathy's death, and Bachalo's departure from the series, marked a declining point. However, he still thought \\"the final 20 issues are still part of a marvelous love story... While Milligan couldn‚Äôt quite recapture the magic of the first 50 issues (and especially the first 26 issues), the entire series is a wonderful journey\\". Cronin thought the series should have ended with the 50th issue. Related works In 2003, as part of the Vertigo imprint's tenth anniversary special, Milligan and Mike Allred produced \\"One Crazy Girl's Story\\", a new story featuring Shade. During the 2011 crossover event Flashpoint, Milligan produced a tie-in story, Flashpoint: Secret Seven, which featured his Shade as the star. According to Milligan, he wanted to write a story about Shade for Flashpoint so he could \\"explore a different kind of Shade... After all this time I still feel I‚Äôm finding out more about Shade.\\" After Flashpoint concluded, DC's entire comics line was relaunched in an initiative called the New 52. Milligan began writing a new series, Justice League Dark, which featured Shade as one of the eponymous team's members. Shade left the team after the eighth issue (June 2012), after losing control of the M-Vest in Gotham City. In 2016, DC started a new imprint, Young Animal, to focus on comics set in the DCU and directed at mature readers. One of the imprint's launch series was a spiritual successor to Shade, the Changing Man called Shade, the Changing Girl, later retitled Shade, the Changing Woman. The series deals with Rac Shade's legacy, and he also has guest appearances. A two-minute adaptation of Shade, the Changing Man was produced for DC Nation Shorts, a series of animated shorts that aired on Cartoon Network. It was released on August 20, 2013.

In 1971, by virtue of the 26th amendment to the Constitution of India, the Government of India abolished all official symbols of princely India, including titles, privileges, and remuneration (privy purses).1\\\\. , \\"Through a constitutional amendment passed in 1971, Indira Gandhi stripped the princes of the titles, privy purses and regal privileges which her father's government had granted.\\" (p 278). 2. Quote: \\"The princes of India ‚Äì their number and variety reflecting to a large extent the chaos that had come to the country with the breakup of the Mughal empire ‚Äì had lost real power in the British time. Through generations of idle servitude they had grown to specialize only in style. A bogus, extinguishable glamour: in 1947, with Independence, they had lost their state, and Mrs. Gandhi in 1971 had, without much public outcry, abolished their privy purses and titles.\\" (pp 37‚Äì38). 3. Quote: \\"Although the Indian states were alternately requested or forced into union with either India or Pakistan, the real death of princely India came when the Twenty-sixth Amendment Act (1971) abolished the princes' titles, privileges, and privy purses.\\" (page 78). 4. Quote: \\"The third stage in the political evolution of the princes from rulers to citizens occurred in 1971, when the constitution ceased to recognize them as princes and their privy purses, titles, and special privileges were abolished.\\" (page 84). 5. Quote: \\"Her success at the polls emboldened Mrs. Gandhi to act decisively against the princes. Through 1971, the two sides tried and failed to find a settlement. The princes were willing to forgo their privy purses, but hoped at least to save their titles. But with her overwhelming majority in Parliament, the prime minister had no need to compromise. On 2 December she introduced a bill to amend the constitution and abolish all princely privileges. It was passed in the Lok Sabha by 381 votes to six, and in the Rajya Sabha by 167 votes to seven. In her own speech, the prime minister invited 'the princes to join the elite of the modern age, the elite which earns respect by its talent, energy and contribution to human progress, all of which can only be done when we work together as equals without regarding anybody as of special status.' \\" (page 441). 6. Quote: \\"The Indian princes survived the British Raj by only a few years. The Indian republic stripped them of their powers and then their titles.\\" (page 10). 7. Quote: \\"Indian States: \\"Various (formerly) semi- independent areas in India ruled by native princes .... Under British rule ... administered by residents assisted by political agents. Titles and remaining privileges of princes abolished by Indian government 1971.\\" (page 520). 8. Quote: \\"A monarchy is only as good as the reigning monarch: thus it is with the princely states. Once they seemed immutable, invincible. In 1971 they were \\"derecognized,\\" their privileges, privy purses and titles all abolished at a stroke\\" (page 91) The former Pataudi Palace has become a heritage hotel.

History Founded in 2004 by Bishop Crispian Hollis, it is the first monastery of Benedictine nuns to have been established in England for more than half a century. The founding members were originally nuns of Stanbrook Abbey, Worcester, but the community is an autonomous monastery of diocesan right with monastic rather than papal enclosure. Charitable works The nuns maintain themselves and their charitable undertakings by their work, principally book and web development. They make audio books for the blind and visually impaired and provide a postal library lending service. Their monastery web site is well known for its innovative use of new media and is an important element in the community's spiritual outreach. In 2009 it won the Premier Christian Media People's Choice Award.http://www.christianblogawards.com/winners09.html The monastery library has important collections of modern American and High Anglican theology and is open to students and others by appointment.

Arber has previously held the position of President of the British Sociological Association (1999‚Äì2001) and Vice-President of the European Sociological Association (2005‚Äì07). She is well known for her work on gender and ageing, inequalities in health and has pioneered research in the new field of sociology of sleep. Career Arber was born on 19 March 1949 in Chingford, Essex, England, and raised in Thames Ditton, Surrey. She graduated from the London School of Economics with a First in Sociology 1972. She went onto postgraduate study at University of London and University of Michigan before joining the Sociology Department of the University of Surrey as a Lecturer in 1974. She obtained her PhD by publications from the University of Surrey in 1991. She was made a Professor there in 1994, she acted as Head of Department (1996‚Äì2002) and Head of the School of Human Sciences (2001‚Äì04). She has served on various committees of the Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) since 1984 and was a member of the Grants Assessment Panel (2008‚Äì12). As well as presidency of the British Sociological Association, she has also acted as President of the International Sociological Association Research Committee on Sociology of Ageing (2006‚Äì10). She was a member of the 2014 REF (Research Excellence Framework) Panel for Sociology. Work =Ageing and gender= One of Arber's main areas of research has been in the field of the Sociology of Ageing and how gender inequalities develop in later life. Much of the seminal work in this discipline was developed together with Jay Ginn, such as Connecting Gender and Ageing in 1995 which won the Age Concern prize for best book on Ageing in 1996 and Gender and Ageing: Changing Roles and Relationships. In 2000 she established and is Co-Director of the Centre for Research on Ageing and Gender (CRAG) at University of Surrey. She is co-editor of Contemporary Grandparenting: Changing Family Relationships in Global Contexts. =Sleep= Sara has been pioneering empirical research on the sociology of sleep since 2001. Recent research was done through SomnIA (Sleep in Ageing), a four-year collaborative research project including researchers from sociology, psychology, neuroendocrinology, engineering, nursing and medicine. The SomnIA research covered various aspects of quality of sleep including amongst older people in care homes. Professor Arber has analysed survey data on the sleeping habits of 14,000 households finding that one in 10 people are using medication to assist in getting to sleep, and women have more problems getting to sleep than men. She has also researched \\"The biomedical and sociological effects of sleep restriction\\" for an EU Marie Curie research project focused on the effects of lack of sleep on health and wellbeing. Honours In 2000, Arber was elected into Academician of the Academy of the Social Science (AcSS): in 2014, after a change in name, she became a Fellow of the Academy of the Social Science (FAcSS). In 2008, she was elected a Fellow of the British Academy (FBA), the United Kingdom's national academy for the humanities and social sciences. In 2012, she was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Arts (FRSA). Sara was awarded the British Society of Gerontology Outstanding Achievement Award 2011 for her research on ageing.

An expert in the field of ornithology, Lewis is remembered as a pioneer female American scientist as well as an activist in the anti- slavery, temperance, and women's suffrage movements. Biography =Early years= Graceanna Lewis was born on August 3, 1821, on a farm near West Vincent Township, Chester County, Pennsylvania.\\"Graceanna Lewis,\\" National Cyclopaedia of American Biography: Volume 9. New York: James T. White and Company, 1899; pp. 447-448. She was the second of four daughters of a Quaker farmer named John Lewis and his wife, the former Esther Fussell.Barbara Morgan, \\"Graceanna Lewis,\\" in Women in World History: A Biographical Encyclopedia: Volume 9: Laa to Lyud. Farmington Hills, MI: Gale Group, 1999. (Subscription required). Graceanna's ancestors included a friend of William Penn who had emigrated to the new Province of Pennsylvania from South Wales in 1682. Lewis' father died when she was only three years old, leaving her mother to raise her alone.Marilyn Ogilvie and Joy Harvey, \\"Graceanna Lewis,\\" in Biographical Dictionary of Women in Science: Pioneering Lives from Ancient Times to the Mid-Twentieth Century: L-Z. Routledge, 2000. Her mother had been a school teacher prior to marriage and was instrumental in developing a keen affection for science learning in Graceanna. Esther Fussell Lewis made astronomy and weather observations as well as plant flowering times. She also serving as a role model in social activism by housing fugitive slaves as part of the Underground Railroad to freedom in Canada. Following her mother's death, Lewis made her own home available for this purpose, secretly providing overnight accommodation for as many as 11 runaways slaves at one time. Lewis attended the Kimberton Boarding School for Girls in neighboring Kimberton, Pennsylvania, at which she received instruction in many of the natural sciences, including astronomy, botany, chemistry, and zoology. Lewis also showed great aptitude as a painter of natural subjects. Following the completion of her studies in 1842, she entered the teaching profession ‚Äî one of the few fields of endeavor open to educated women in the day, taking a position as a teacher of botany and chemistry at a boarding school in York, Pennsylvania. =Scientific endeavors= Another women who influenced and inspired Lewis was her friend Mary Townsend, the sister of John Kirk Townsend. Mary had written a book on insects and Lewis expressed a wish to emulate her. During the 1850s Lewis moved to Philadelphia, where she worked closely with a small circle of Quakers who were active in the natural sciences. These included Ezra Michener and Vincent Bernard. She met one of America's leading ornithologists, John Cassin of the Philadelphia Academy of Natural Sciences, in 1862 and studied ornithology at an advanced level under his tutorship for the next half decade. In 1867 Cassin honored his protege with the naming of Icterus graceannae, the White-edged Oriole in Lewis's honor.\\"A Field Guide to American Ornithology in the Delaware Valley 1699‚Äì1900: Graceanna Lewis (1821‚Äì1912) in the Delaware Valley,\\" Delaware Valley Ornithology Club, www.dvoc.org/ From the middle of the 1860s Lewis began to give private lectures on the field of ornithology in Philadelphia. Her area of interest and expertise gradually spread throughout her life to include the broad spectrum of natural history, including plants, animals, and minerals. In 1868 Lewis published the book The Natural History of Birds, the first of an anticipated multi-part magnum opus.Scott Weidensaul, Of a Feather: A Brief History of American Birding. Boston: Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, 2007; pg. 91. Unfortunately for Lewis, her patron Cassin died in 1869 and she was unable to obtain a teaching position in the field which would enable her to further advance her work. Lewis's grand plans were also hampered by the fact that her ideas were seen by publishers as too complicated for a lay audience but not advanced enough for the scientific community.Daniel Patterson (ed.), Early American Nature Writers: A Biographical Encyclopedia. Westport, CT: Greenwood Press, 2007; pg. 256. As a product of a devout religious upbringing, Lewis was critical of the Charles Darwin's theory of evolution for much of her life, instead positing that God was responsible for an intricate and well ordered universe. Only in the 1890s did Lewis come to accept some evolutionary ideas, still seeing the process as part and parcel of a grand theist system. Lewis particularly rejected Darwin's idea that random variation was part of the process behind natural selection, arguing instead that evolution was a divinely directed process for the perfection of supernaturally created species. Held back by her theistic determinism and lack of higher education, Lewis was forced to limit herself to popular lectures on the naturalism to work as a freelance scientific illustrator, by which she made her living. With such an income stream unstable at best, in 1870 Lewis accepted a teaching position at the Philadelphia Friends School, where she would remain until the next year. In 1871 Lewis sold family land and used the proceeds to finance her further research. She envisioned a set of illustrative charts demonstrating the relationship of the plant and animal kingdoms, but she was unable to keep pace with the rapid influx of new information and was unwilling to publish her charts in an incomplete form, so the projects went unrealized. Lewis twice lectured at Vassar College, in 1874 and 1879. She applied for a number of academic posts throughout the period, including a vacant professorship of natural history at Vassar, but owing to her lack of formal education beyond the high school level and a pervasive sexism in academia she was unable to land a college-level teaching position. Lewis instead returned to lower level teaching, working at the Foster School for Girls of Clifton Springs, New York, from 1883 to 1885. In 1893 Lewis received a commission to paint a set of 50 watercolor illustrations of representative leaves of trees for display at the World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago. Lewis's work was regarded as a success, and the set of paintings was publicly displayed again at the 1901 Pan-American Exposition in Buffalo, New York, as well as the 1904 Louisiana Purchase Exposition in St. Louis. She was a member of the Academy of Natural Sciences in Philadelphia and the Delaware County Institute of Science. =Social beliefs= In addition to her direct action against slavery as part of the secret network which aided escaped African-American slaves in their flight to freedom in the years prior to the American Civil War, Lewis was active in several other social movements of her day. In accordance with her Quaker religious beliefs, Lewis remained throughout her life a dedicated pacifist.John Howard Brown (ed.), \\"Graceanna Lewis,\\" Lamb's Biographical Dictionary of the United States: Volume 5. Boston: Federal Book Company of Boston, 1903; pp. 52-53. She was also an activist in the movement for the prohibition of alcohol in the United States serving as Secretary of the Woman's Christian Temperance Union of Media, Pennsylvania and as that organization's superintendent of scientific temperance instruction for Delaware County. Lewis was also active in the movement for the granting of the right to vote to women. =Death and legacy= Graceanna Lewis spent the final decades of her life in her hometown of Media, PA with her nephew, artist Charles Lewis Fussell. She died on February 25, 1912, at the age of 90, following a stroke. Lewis's papers are part of the Lewis-Fussell Family Papers collection at Swarthmore College in Swarthmore, Pennsylvania.\\"An Inventory of the Lewis-Fussell Family Papers, 1698‚Äì1978.\\" Swarthmore College Friends Historical Library, Swarthmore, Pennsylvania, collection RG 5/087.

The Capture of Sint Eustatius took place in February 1781 during the Fourth Anglo-Dutch War when British army and naval forces under General John Vaughan and Admiral George Rodney seized the Dutch-owned Caribbean island of Sint Eustatius. The capture was controversial in Britain, as it was alleged that Vaughan and Rodney had used the opportunity to enrich themselves and had neglected more important military duties. The island was subsequently taken by Dutch-allied French forces in late 1781, ending the British occupation. Background St. Eustatius, a Dutch-controlled island in the West Indies, was an entrepot that operated as a major trading centre despite its relatively small size. During the American War of Independence it assumed increased importance, because a British blockade made it difficult to transport supplies directly across the Atlantic Ocean to US ports. St. Eustatius became a crucial source of supplies, and its harbour was filled with American trading ships. Its importance increased further following France's entry into the war in 1778 as it was used to help supply the French West Indian islands.Clowes, p. 480. It is estimated that one half of all the American Revolutionary military supplies were trans-shipped through St. Eustatius. Its merchant networks - Dutch, but also Jewish, many of whom were St. Eustatius residents \\\\- were key to the military supplies and goods being shipped to the revolutionary forces. US-European communications were directed through St. Eustatius. In 1776, St. Eustatius, hence the Dutch, were the first to recognize the American Revolutionary government when the US brig, Andrew Doria, fired thirteen guns announcing their arrival. The Andrew Doria was saluted with an eleven gun response from Fort Orange. The Andrew Doria arrived to purchase military supplies on St. Eustatius and to present to the Dutch governor a copy of the US Declaration of Independence. An earlier copy of the Declaration had been captured by a British naval ship. The British were confused by the papers wrapped around the declaration, which they thought were a secret cypher. The papers were written in Yiddish for a merchant in Holland. Fort Oranje St. Eustatius's role in supplying Britain's enemies provoked anger amongst British leaders. Rodney alleged that goods brought out on British convoys had then been sold, through St. Eustatius, to the rebels.Trew, p. 101. It seems to have fuelled a hatred for this island especially with Rodney who vowed to \\"bring this Nest of Villains to condign Punishment: they deserve scourging and they shall be scourged.\\" He had alreading singled out several individuals on St. Eustatius who were instrumental in aiding the enemy, such as \\"... Mr Smith in the House of Jones - they cannot be too soon taken care of - they are notorious in the cause of America and France ...\\" Following the outbreak of war between the Dutch Republic and Britain in December 1780, orders were sent from London to seize the island. The British were assisted by the fact that the news of the war's outbreak had not yet reached St. Eustatius.Trew, pp. 101‚Äì102. Capture The looting of the island causing great excitement. Rodney is called Nero and General Vaughan was compared to Caligula. (Dutch engraving) A British expedition of 3,000 troops sailed from Saint Lucia on 30 January 1781.Trew, p. 102. Rodney left behind ships to monitor the French on Martinique. He also sent Samuel Hood ahead to stop any merchant ships escaping from the harbour. The main force arrived off St. Eustatius on 3 February. Rodney's ships took up position to neutralise any shore batteries. Two or three shots were fired from the only Dutch warship on the roadstead, the frigate Mars under Captain Count Van Bijland.Teenstra, p. 344. Instead of disembarking the troops and launching an immediate assault, Rodney sent a message to Governor Johannes de Graaff suggesting that he surrender to avoid bloodshed. De Graaff agreed to the proposal and surrendered. De Graaff had ten guns in Fort Orange and sixty soldiers. Rodney had over 1,000 guns on his ships. By the following day the nearby islands of Saint Martin and Saba had also surrendered. There was a brief exchange of fire when two of the British ships shot at the Mars and Van Bijland answered with his cannons.Teenstra, p. 345. Rodney reprimanded the captains responsible for this lack of discipline.Trew, pp. 102‚Äì103. The only battle occurred near Sombrero. Rodney found out that a convoy of thirty richly loaded Dutch merchant ships had just sailed off for the motherland less than two days before his arrival, protected only by a single man-of-war. He sent three warships after them, and they quickly caught up with the convoy. The lone Dutch man-of-war was no match for the three British ships and, after a fierce 30-minute pounding, the mortally wounded commander, Rear-Admiral Willem Krul, while dying, ordered his captain to lower the flag. Eight of the Dutch crew were killed. Krul was taken back to St. Eustatius where he was buried with full honours.De Jong, p. 179. The crews of all Dutch ships taken at St. Eustatius and also those of Krul's convoy were stripped of all their possessions and taken to St. Kitts, where they were imprisoned- \\"with hardly anything more than the most necessary clothes.\\"Nieuwe Nederlandsche Jaerboeken. 1781. Tweede Stuk, pp. 1080‚Äì1081. Controversy The wealth Rodney and Vaughan discovered on St. Eustatius exceeded their expectations. There were 130 merchantmen in the bay as well as the Dutch frigate and five smaller American warships. In total the value of goods seized, including the convoy captured off Sombrero, was estimated to be around ¬£3 million.Trew, pp. 103‚Äì104. On 5 February 1781, Rodney and Vaughan signed an agreement stating that all goods taken belonged to the Crown.Trew, p. 106. Rodney and Vaughan, by British custom, expected to personally receive a significant share of the captured wealth from the king once it reached England. Instead of delegating the task of sorting through and estimating the value of the confiscated property, Rodney and Vaughan oversaw this themselves. The time spent doing this led to allegations that they had neglected their military duties. In particular, Samuel Hood suggested that Rodney should have sailed to intercept a French fleet under Admiral de Grasse, traveling to Martinique.Trew, pp. 104‚Äì105. The French fleet instead turned north and headed for the Chesapeake Bay of Virginia and Maryland. Rodney had further weakened his fleet by sending a strong defending force to Britain to accompany his treasure ships. After months on St. Eustatius, capturing additional merchants and treasure, Rodney was imposed upon to send part of his fleet under Hood north to aid General Cornwallis and British armed forces fighting the Americans, while he took the rest of the fleet back to Britain for some overdue refitting. Hood arrived at Chesapeake Bay and, finding no French fleet, continued to New York to join forces under Admiral Graves. The French forces under Admiral de Grasse (along with another French squadron from Rhode Island) arrived at the Chesapeake soon after Hood had left. Graves and Hood had been outmaneuvered and, although the resulting Battle of the Chesapeake was a tactical draw, it was a strategic defeat for the British. Cornwallis could not be supplied and was forced to surrender a few weeks later. The Americans had won the war, partially because of Rodney's anti-Semitism and avaricious delays. After returning home, both officers defended themselves in the House of Commons. As Rodney was a supporter of the government led by Lord North, it approved of his conduct, and he returned to the West Indies for the 1782 campaigning season. When the North government fell and was replaced in 1782, the new government sent orders recalling Rodney. However, before they arrived, he led his fleet to victory at the Battle of the Saintes ‚Äì ending a Franco-Spanish plan to invade Jamaica ‚Äì and returned home to be rewarded with a peerage. Rodney survived censure in parliament by a vote strictly along party lines. At the time, St. Eustatius was home to a significant Jewish community, mainly merchants and a few plantation owners with strong connections to Holland. Ten days after the island surrendered to the British, part of the Jewish community, together with Governor de Graaff, were forcibly deported, being given only 24 hours' notice.Norton, Louis Arthur. \\"Retribution: Admiral Rodney and the Jews of St. Eustatius\\" Jewish Magazine (August 2012). Rodney was particularly hard on the Jews. The harshness was reserved for the Jews alone as he did not do the same to French, Dutch, Spanish or American merchants on the island.Edmund Burke, in his speech to parliament, noted that the Jews had no army or navy to defend them from Rodney's actions, while the French did. He even permitted the French to leave with all their possessions. Rodney was concerned that his unprecedented behavior would be repeated upon British islands by French forces when events were different. Rodney imprisoned all the adult Jewish males (101) in the West India Company's weighing house on the Bay. Those who were not immediately shipped to St. Kitts (31 heads of Jewish families) were held there for three days. He looted Jewish personal possessions, even cutting open the lining of their clothing to find money hidden there. When Rodney realized that the Jews might be hiding additional treasure, he dug up fresh graves at the Jewish cemetery. Later, Edmund Burke, upon learning of Rodney's actions, rose to condemn Rodney's anti-Semitic, avaricious vindictiveness in parliament. British control of St. Eustatius only lasted ten months, and Rodney's work to manage the prizes was in vain. Many of the goods he seized were captured on their way to Britain by a French squadron under Toussaint-Guillaume Picquet de la Motte. The island was captured by French forces in November 1781, who returned it to the Dutch in 1784. The Jews and other expelled merchants returned, commerce and trade resumed and the island's population reached its all-time high in 1790.Hartog, pp. 200‚Äì202. =Recapture= Recapture of Sint Eustatius, 1781 On the evening of 26 November 1781, 1500 French troops from Fort Royal, led by Marquis de Bouill√©, landed covertly at St. Eustatius to take the island. Opposing them were the battalion companies of the 13th and 15th Regiments of Foot, which numbered 756 men. Unaware that the French were on the island, the British commandant, Lieutenant Colonel James Cockburn, was taking a morning ride when he was captured by troops of the Irish brigade in French service. The Irish and French troops subsequently surprised the British at drill outside the fort and those on guard. The French ran into the fort behind the British and forced the garrison to surrender. Cockburn was afterwards tried by a general court martial and cashiered (forced to retire). There were no significant casualties on either side.Historical Record of the Fifteenth Regiment of Foot, p. 54. Four million livres were taken‚Äî170,000 belonging to Admiral Rodney or his troops. These funds were distributed to the French troops and Dutch colonists.Under the Count de Grasse, p. 93. References Bibliography * *Hartog, J. Geschiedenis van de Nederlandse Antillen IV.

It is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade listed building, and is under the care of the Churches Conservation Trust. The church stands to the east of the A1031 road in the area of the village named Theddlethorpe All Saints, and is some northeast of Mablethorpe. It has been called the \\"Cathedral of the Marsh\\". History The church dates from the 12th century, with some additions and alterations undertaken in about 1380‚Äì1400, and more in the late 17th century. Minor repairs were carried out in 1865‚Äì66. The church was declared redundant in July 1973. Architecture =Exterior= All Saints is constructed in greenstone rubble and limestone rubble, with limestone dressings. In parts the stonework has been patched with brick. The roofs are lead. Its plan consists of a nave with a clerestory, north and south aisles and a south porch, a chancel, and a west tower. The tower is in four stages, with string courses, corner buttresses, and a battlemented parapet with gargoyles at the corners. On top of the tower is a central lead-covered crocketed pinnacle. On the west side of the tower is a doorway, with a four-light window above it. The third stage contains small ogee-headed windows on the west and south sides. On each side of the top stage are three-light louvred bell openings. The north aisle has a battlemented parapet with gargoyles and corbels. The north side of the clerestory is also battlemented, and has gargoyles and pinnacles; it contains five two-light windows. In the north aisle is a two-light west window, a three-light east window, and along its north wall are four three-light windows and a doorway. The north wall of the chancel contains a blocked three-light window. The east window has three lights. The south wall of the chancel contains a three-light and a two-light window, and a priest's door. The parapet at the east end of the nave is pierced with quatrefoils and has crockets. The east wall of the south aisle also has a crocketed parapet, and corner pinnacles. The west window of the aisle has three lights, and there are two three-light windows and one four-light window in the south wall. The south porch is gabled and contains benches along the sides. The door leading into the church has an ogee head and a round rear arch. =Interior= Both arcades have five bays and are carried on octagonal piers. Incorporated into the fabric of the north wall are 12th-century stone fragments carved with chevrons, and beaked voussoirs. The roof of the nave is decorated with fleurons, and the coats of arms of the church donors. In the east wall of the south aisle is a medieval altar slab carved with crosses. Above it is a stone reredos decorated with quatrefoils, fleurons, human heads, and pinnacles. On the north walls of both aisles are fragments of painted texts. In the north aisle is another medieval altar slab, a bracket for a statue, and a doorway leading to the rood loft. The south wall of the chancel contains a triple sedilia and a piscina, and on its east wall are brackets for statues carved with human heads. There are fragments of 15th-century glass in the south aisle windows. The altar rails date from the 18th century, and the marble altar was given to the church in 1717. The chancel screen dates from the 15th century and is in seven bays. The pulpit and lectern are from the 19th century. There is another pulpit at the back of the church dating from the 17th century; this is in carved oak and was formerly in Skidbrooke Church. The 16th-century pews are carved with poppyheads. The octagonal font is from the 15th century, and is decorated with quatrefoils, fleurons and human heads; it has a wooden 18th- century cover.

Manufacturing in the United States is a vital sector. The United States is the world's third largest manufacturer (after China and the EU) with a record high real output in Q1 2018 of $2.00 trillion (i.e., adjusted for inflation in 2009 Dollars) well above the 2007 peak before the Great Recession of $1.95 trillion. The U.S. manufacturing industry employed 12.35 million people in December 2016 and 12.56 million in December 2017, an increase of 207,000 or 1.7%. Though still a large part of the US economy, in Q1 2018 manufacturing contributed less to GDP than the 'Finance, insurance, real estate, rental, and leasing' sector, the 'Government' sector, or 'Professional and business services' sector. Though manufacturing output robustly recovered from the Great Recession to reach an all-time high in 2018, manufacturing employment has been declining since the 1990s. This 'jobless recovery' made job creation or preservation in the manufacturing sector an important topic in the 2016 United States presidential election. Employment Manufacturing jobs helped build out the U.S. middle class after World War II, as the U.S. established pro-labor policies and faced limited global competition. Between 1980 and 1985, and then again 2001 to 2009, there were precipitous declines in US manufacturing jobs; it is estimated that 1/3 of US manufacturing jobs vanished in the eight years 2001 to 2009, and few have returned. Some argue that the 2001-2009 period was worse for US manufacturing than the Great Depression.Robert Atkinson (2012), Worse Than the Great Depression, ITIF. https://itif.org/publications/2012/03/19/worse-great- depression-what-experts-are-missing-about-american-manufacturing There are several possible explanations for the decline. Bill Lazonick argues that legalization of company's buying their own shares of stock in 1982 has led to sustained stock market bubbles that distorted investment away from physical plant.William Lazonick September 2014, \\"Profits Without Prosperity\\" in Harvard Business Review https://hbr.org/2014/09/profits-without-prosperity Others point to automation or developments outside the United States, such as the rise of China, globalized free trade, and supply chain innovation. These have arguably resulted in the off-shoring of thousands of U.S. manufacturing facilities and millions of manufacturing jobs to lower-wage countries. Meanwhile, technological innovation has increased productivity significantly, meaning that manufacturing output in the United States has increased by 80% since the 1980s, despite large job losses in the manufacturing sector during that same period. The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) forecast in October 2017 that manufacturing employment would fall from 12.3 million in 2016 to 11.6 million in 2026, a decline of 736,000. As a share of employment, manufacturing would fall from 7.9% in 2016 to 6.9% in 2026, continuing a long- term trend. U.S. manufacturing employment U.S. manufacturing industry's share of nominal GDP The U.S. manufacturing industry employed 12.4 million people in March 2017, generating output (nominal GDP) of $2.2 trillion in Q3 2016, with real GDP of $1.9 trillion in 2009 dollars. The share of persons employed in manufacturing relative to total employment has steadily declined since the 1960s. Employment growth in industries such as construction, finance, insurance and real estate, and services industries played a significant role in reducing manufacturing‚Äôs overall share of U.S. employment. In 1990, services surpassed manufacturing as the largest contributor to overall private industry production, and then the finance, insurance and real estate sector surpassed manufacturing in 1991. Since the entry of China into the World Trade Organization in December 2001, the decline in manufacturing jobs has accelerated. The U.S. goods trade deficit (imports greater than exports) with China was approximately $350 billion in 2016. However it is possible that the import of goods from China is a result rather than a cause. The US stock market also ended a sustained fourteen year bubble in 2001, and the ensuing job loss pushed a significant portion of US population below the poverty line. The Economist reported in January 2017 that manufacturing historically created good paying jobs for workers without a college education, particularly for men. The jobs paid well enough so that women did not have to work when they had young children. Unions were strong and owners did not want to risk strikes in their factories due to large capital investments and significant on the job training. Such jobs are much less available in the post-2001 era in the U.S. though they remain available in Germany, Switzerland and Japan, leading to calls to bring those jobs back from overseas, establish protectionism, and reduce immigration. Making it illegal for companies to purchase shares of their own stock has not yet gained traction as a remedy for the diversion of operating profits away from reinvestment in equipment and people. Manufacturing continues to evolve, due to factors such as information technology, supply chain innovations such as containerization, companies un- bundling tasks that used to be in one location or business, reduced barriers to trade, and competition from low-cost developing countries such as China and Mexico. Competition from high wage nations such as Germany is also increasing. =History= Panel showing four manufacturing charts, illustrating trends in employment, output, and productivity Between 1980 and 1985, US manufacturing was hard hit by a twin dynamic: first, Japanese productivity rose at a rapid rate, so that Japanese products fell in price by 12%. Second, Fed Chair Paul Volcker raised US interest rates such that the US dollar appreciated. This was the opposite policy from that which a rise in Japanese productivity would have dicated, and the US policy action made Japanese products 30% cheaper than American until 1986. The US machine tool sector never recovered from this body blow.Duggan, MC (2017), \\"Deindustrialization in the Granite State, Part 1: Kingsbury Machine Tool\\" in Dollars and Sense, Nov/Dec. issue. https://www.academia.edu/35530846/Deindustrialization_in_the_Granite_State_What_Keene_New_Hampshire_Can_Tell_Us_About_the_Roles_of_Monetary_Policy_and_Financialization_in_the_Loss_of_US_Manufacturing_Jobs. Between 1983 and 2005, U.S. exports grew by 340 percent, with exports of manufactured goods increasing by 407 percent over the same period. In 1983, the primary export commodities were transportation equipment, computer and electronic products, agricultural products, machinery (except electrical), chemicals, and food and kindred products. Together these commodities totaled 69 percent of total U.S. exports. In 2005, the primary export commodities were largely the same: computer and electronic products, transportation equipment, chemicals, machinery (except electrical), miscellaneous manufactured commodities, and agricultural products. Together these commodities accounted for 69 percent of total U.S. merchandise exports. Between 1983 and 2005, exports of computer and electronic products grew by 493 percent, overtaking transportation as the leading export commodity (which grew by 410 percent). Though agricultural products exports grew by 26 percent during this period, its share of overall merchandise exports fell from 12 percent in 1983 to 4 percent in 2005. In 1983, the top trading partners for U.S. exports were Canada (21 percent of total merchandise exports), Japan (11 percent), United Kingdom (5 percent), Mexico (4 percent), Germany (4 percent), the Netherlands (4 percent), Saudi Arabia (3 percent), France (3 percent), Korea (3 percent), and Belgium and Luxembourg (2 percent). In 2005, the top markets for U.S. exports were Canada (24 percent), Mexico (13 percent), Japan (6 percent), China (5 percent), United Kingdom (4 percent), Germany (4 percent), South Korea (3 percent), the Netherlands (3 percent), France (2 percent), and Taiwan (2 percent). Between 1983 and 2005, exports to Mexico increased by 1,228 percent, allowing it to replace Japan as the second-largest market for U.S. exports. In the first quarter of 2010, overall U.S. merchandise exports increased by 20 percent compared to the first quarter of 2009, with manufactured goods exports increasing by 20 percent. As in 2009, the highest export commodities were transportation equipment, computer and electronic products, chemicals, machinery (except electrical), agricultural products, and miscellaneous manufactured commodities. In the first quarter of 2010, the primary markets for U.S. merchandise exports were Canada, Mexico, China, Japan, the United Kingdom, Germany, South Korea, Brazil, the Netherlands, and Singapore. With the exception of the Netherlands, exports to all of these countries increased in the first quarter of 2010, compared to the same quarter in 2009. Notably, exports to Canada increased by 22 percent, Mexico by 28 percent, and China by 47 percent over this period. Exports to the two NAFTA partners accounted for nearly one-third (32 percent) of U.S. merchandise trade in the first quarter of 2010. The panel chart in this section includes four diagrams describing manufacturing labor, output, and productivity historical trends through 2016: *Figure 1-Job measures: The blue line (left axis) is the ratio of manufacturing jobs to the total number of non-farm payroll jobs. It has declined since the 1960s as manufacturing jobs fell and services expanded. The red line (right axis) is the number of manufacturing jobs (000s), which had fallen by nearly one-third since the late 1990s. *Figure 2-Output measures: Real (inflation adjusted) GDP (blue line) and nominal GDP (red line) from the manufacturing sector. While both rose from the trough due to the Great Recession, the real GDP had yet to regain its pre-crisis (2007) level as of 2016. *Figure 3-Job measures, indexed: The red line shows the percent change in manufacturing jobs, measured relative to the 1999 as the starting point. The blue line shows construction jobs. Both were below pre-crisis levels in 2016. *Figure 4-Productivity measures, indexed: Measured from the end of the recession (June 2009), employment (green line) is up about 5%, but real output is up over 30%, indicating a significant gain in productivity (i.e., output per labor hour). =Forecast= The Bureau of Labor Statistics projected in October 2017 that: *10.5 of the 11.5 million net jobs created (90%) over the 2016-2026 period would be in services. The service jobs growth rate would be about 0.8%. However, the goods producing sector, which includes manufacturing, would only add 219,000 jobs over that period, growing at a rate of 0.1%. *Manufacturing employment would fall from 12.3 million in 2016 to 11.6 million in 2026, a decline of 736,000. As a share of employment, manufacturing would fall from 7.9% in 2016 to 6.9% in 2026. *Employment in production occupations (a subset of manufacturing) was expected to fall from 9.4 million in 2016 to 9.0 million in 2026 (a 4% decline), falling from 6.0% of employment to 5.4%. =Trade policy= U.S. manufacturing employment has declined steadily as a share of total employment, from around 28% in 1960 to 8% in March 2017. Manufacturing employment has fallen from 17.2 million persons in December 2000 to 12.4 million in March 2017, a decline of about 5.7 million or about one-third even as the U.S.population ballooned from 220 million to 330 million in the same time frame. An estimated 1-2 million of the job losses in manufacturing 1999‚Äì2011 were due to competition with China (the China shock), which entered the World Trade Organization in December 2001. The Economic Policy Institute estimated that the trade deficit with China cost about 2.7 million jobs between 2001 and 2011, including manufacturing and other industries. While U.S. manufacturing employment is down, output was near a record level in 2017 in real GDP terms, indicating productivity (output per worker) has also improved significantly. This is likely due to automation, global supply chains, process improvements, and other technology changes. Economist Paul Krugman argued in December 2016 that \\"America‚Äôs shift away from manufacturing doesn‚Äôt have much to do with trade, and even less to do with trade policy.\\" He also cited the work of other economists indicating that the declines in manufacturing employment from 1999 to 2011 due to trade policy generally and trade with China specifically were \\"less than a fifth of the absolute loss of manufacturing jobs over the period\\" but that the effects were significant for regions directly impacted by those losses. Modern overview The United States is the world's second largest manufacturer (after China) with a record high real output in Q1 2018 of $2.00 trillion (i.e., adjusted for inflation in 2009 Dollars) well above the 2007 peak before the Great Recession of $1.95 trillion. The U.S. manufacturing industry employed 12.35 million people in December 2016 and 12.56 million in December 2017, an increase of 207,000 or 1.7%. Historically, manufacturing has provided relatively well-paid blue-collar jobs, although this has been affected by globalization and automation. Manufacturing continues to evolve, due to factors such as information technology, supply chain innovations such as containerization, companies un-bundling tasks that used to be in one location or business, reduced barriers to trade, and competition from low-cost developing countries such as China and Mexico. Manufacturing is conducted among globally distributed supply chains, with various stages of production conducted in different countries. For example, automotive parts may be manufactured in the U.S., shipped to Mexico for assembly, then sent back to the U.S. In some cases, the components of the final product cross the border multiple times. An estimated 40% of the value of U.S. imports from Mexico is from content produced in the U.S.; this figure is 25% for Canada but only 4% for China. This \\"production sharing\\" is an indication of the integrated nature of the supply chains between the U.S., Mexico and Canada in the NAFTA region. = Trade balance = During 2016, the U.S. exported $1,051 billion in manufactured goods and imported $1,920 billion, a manufacturing goods deficit of $868 billion. The largest exports were transportation equipment ($252B), Chemicals ($174B), Computers and Electronic Products ($116B) and \\"Machinery- Except Electrical\\" ($109B). = Industries = As of 2019, durable and nondurable goods manufacturing account for $3.1t and $3t of gross output of GDP, respectively. The largest manufacturing industries in the United States by revenue include petroleum, steel, automobiles, aerospace, telecommunications, chemicals, electronics, food processing, consumer goods, lumber, and mining. A large portion of U.S. industrial output, the United States leads the world in airplane manufacturing. American companies such as Boeing, Cessna (see: Textron), Lockheed Martin (see: Skunk Works), and General Dynamics produce a vast majority of the world's civilian and military aircraft in factories stretching across the United States. International comparison The Congressional Research Service reported in January 2017 that: *\\"The United States‚Äô share of global manufacturing activity declined from 28% in 2002, following the end of the 2001 U.S. recession, to 16.5% in 2011. Since then, the U.S. share has risen to 18.6%, the largest share since 2009. These estimates are based on the value of each country's manufacturing in U.S. dollars; part of the decline in the U.S. share was due to a 23% decline in the value of the dollar between 2002 and 2011, and part of the rise since 2011 is attributable to a stronger dollar. *China displaced the United States as the largest manufacturing country in 2010. Again, part of China's rise by this measure has been due to the appreciation of its currency, the renminbi, against the U.S. dollar. The reported size of China's manufacturing sector decreased slightly in 2015 due to currency adjustments. *Manufacturing output, measured in each country's local currency adjusted for inflation, has been growing more slowly in the United States than in China, South Korea, Germany, and Mexico, but more rapidly than in most European countries and Canada. *Employment in manufacturing has fallen in most major manufacturing countries over the past quarter-century. In the United States, manufacturing employment since 1990 has declined in line with the changes in Western Europe and Japan, although the timing of the decline has differed from country to country. *U.S. manufacturers spend far more on research and development (R&D;) than those in any other country, but manufacturers‚Äô R&D; spending is rising more rapidly in several other countries. *Manufacturers in many countries appear to be spending increasing amounts on R&D;, relative to their value added. U.S. manufacturers spend approximately 11% of value added on R&D;, an increase of more than three percentage points since 2002. A large proportion of U.S. manufacturers‚Äô R&D; takes place in high technology sectors, such as pharmaceutical, electronics, and aircraft manufacturing, whereas in most other countries the largest share of R&D; occurs in medium-technology sectors such as automotive and machinery manufacturing.\\" See also *Economy of the United States *Manufacturing in the United Kingdom *National Network for Manufacturing Innovation *National Occupational Research Agenda, Manufacturing Sector Council, 2018. *U.S. Chamber of Commerce *Working: People Talk About What They Do All Day and How They Feel About What They Do ‚Äì American workers on their jobs in the 1970s *Made in USA Further reading * References Manufacturing ","title":"Manufacturing in the United States"},{"id":"30557095","title":"Sirpur (Assembly constituency)"},{"id":"30557097","text":"Cloverdale is an unincorporated community in Lane County, Oregon, United States.

Founded in 1770 CE by Pratap Singh Prabhakar, its last reigning ruler, H.H. Maharaja Sir Tej Singh Prabhakar Bahadur, signed the accession to the Indian Union on 7 April 1949. History After the death of Aurangzeb, internal dissensions encouraged the petty chieftains to acquire power. Maharaja Surajrmal of Bharatpur conquered the Alwar fort and some of the adjacent territory. But his son Jawahar Singh, after being defeated by the Jaipur ruler at the battle of Maonda-Mandoli and lost the territory gained by his father. Marathas occupied Tijara and Kishangarh. In 1775 Pratap Singh of Naruka family acquired Alwar fort and founded the State of Alwar. = Narukas = Naruka is a subclan of Kachchhwaha Rajputs, who claim descent from Kusha, the eldest son of Rama. They are said to have migrated from Ayodhya to Amber, where Rao Udai Karan (1367) had his son Nar Singh. Bar Singh who is said to be his eldest son, gave up his right of succession in favour of his brother Nar Singh. Bar Singh received the estates of Jhak and Mauzabad towns, a few miles south-west of Jaipur. His grandson was Naru who founded the Naru subclan. One of his descendants Rao Kalyan Singh lost his ancestral estate for his loyalty to his chief, Jai Singh and received in lieu of it, Macheri in 1639 which had been taken from Badgujars. = Maharao Raja Pratap Singh (1740-1791) = Later, Pratap Singh was the son of Muhabbat Singh of Macheri. He was born in 1740. When still young, he was sent to relieve the famous fort of Ranthambor in 1759 which was besieged by the Marathas under the leadership of Gangadhar Tautia. He showed great bravery and ability in the battle that, ensued at Kankod village. The Marathas fled away. Once an astrologer at the Jaipur court predicted that the Rao would attain kingly dignity. Fearing his rise, court intrigues were hatched against him. A shot was also fired at him in 1765. Sensing a danger to his life, he left Jaipur immediately reached Rajgarh. From Rajgarh, he went to Jawahar Singh of Bharatpur who welcomed him and bestowed on him the jagir of Dehra village.In 1768, Jawahar Singh insulted the Jaipur Chief by marching without intimation of his motive, through his Stale, to visit the holy lake of Pushkar near Ajmer. On his return journey, he was attacked by the Rajputs of the State he had insulted and defeated at Maonda-Mandholi in the Tanwarati hills, 60 miles north of Jaipur. ‚ÄúThe victory was, in a great measure, due to the transfer by Pratap Singh of his supporters to the side of his liegelord on the eve of the battle. He was moved to this either by the insult to his country, which a Rajput could ill bear, or by his desire to become reconciled with his own sovereign.‚Äù As a result of his loyalty, Pratap was restored to his fief of Macheri and was also allowed to build a fort at Rajgarh. Madho Singh of Jaipur had died only four days after the battle of Maonda-Mandholi and Pratap Singh II, a minor succeeded him under guardianship of the mother of his younger brother. Pratap Singh gained great influence at the court through friends in the Council. At this time Najaf Khan, the imperial commander aided by Marathas, proceeded to expel Jats from Agra and then attacked Bharatpur. Pratap Singh aligned himself with Najaf Khan and aided him in defeating the Jats, \\"This timely succour and his subsequent aid in defeating the Jats, obtained for him the title of Rao Raja and a Sanad for Machheri, to hold direct of the crown.‚Äù Pratap Singh found an opportunity of reducing the fortress of Alwar which then belonged to the Jat princes of Bharatpur and seized it. He entered the fort of Alwar in November 1775. The followers of Pratap Singh began to own him as their feudal lord as soon as the Alwar fort was taken. Some of estates were escheated to the new State. Lands were also snatched from the possessions of Jats. He increased his wealth by relieving a rich man at Thanaghazi of some of his possessions and by plundering Baswa, a town belonging to Jaipur State. This act resulted in a raid by the Jaipur ruler in person, upon Rajgarh fort. The Maharaja failed to take the place and to defeat his former vassal, on account of the alliance he had formed with the Marathas. He died on September 26, 1791. = Maharao Raja Sawai Bakhtawar Singh (1791-1815) = Pratap Singh left no sons to succeed him. He had adopted a curious method to select his successor. He invited all his relations and nobles with their sons at his palace. Then he called together all the boys whose relationship to himself and ordinary considerations would place them in the list of claimants and asked them to pick up the toys of their choice which were placed in the room. He then chose the one who selected a sword and shield, as the most worthy. This child was Bakhtawar Singh of Thana (near Rajgarh, Alwar), younger son of Dhir Singh. When Bakhtawar Singh was at Jaipur, the chief of Jaipur seized him and did not release him until he had given up five of fertile districts, Bakhtawar Singh soon recouped himself for his losses by occupying lands of other chiefs and strengthened his position by allying himself with the British Government. To checkmate the menacing power of the Marathas, he coalesced his troops with those of British Commander-in- Chief, Lord Lake in the battle that was fought on November 1, 1803 at Laswari, a small village eight miles south-east of Ramgarh, in the district. Maharaja Bakhtawar Singh of Alwar concluded a defensive and offensive treaty with the British on 14th November 1803. The treaty also stipulated that the foreign relations of Alwar were to be regulated by the British government but the government was engaged not to ‚Äúinterfere with the country of Maharao Raja‚Äù. The Bntish demanded no tribute. This victory established British supremacy in Northern India. The Alwar chief was rewarded with the grant of Parganas of Ismailpur and Mandawar together with the taluks of Darbarpura, Ratal (Karnikot), Mandhan, Gilot, Sarai, Bijwar, Nimrana (which was subsequently restored to the raja as a feudatory of Alwar), Dadri, Loharu and Budwana. The vakeel, Ahmad Baksh Khan received as reward the districts of Ferozpur (from British Government) and Loharu (285 sq. miles) from the Alwar ruler under the title of Nawab. He is said to have become deranged in the evening of his reign and showed his insanity principally by his cruelty to Muslims, The mosques were razed to the ground; the tombs of Ghalib Shahid at Alwar and that of Sayyad Jalaluddin at Bahadurpur were dug out and the dwelling of Kamal Chisti (nephew of Salim Chisti) at Alwar, was destroyed. Observing of namaz and offering the sacrifices were forbidden. Major Powlett states that he gave fakirs the option of their noses cut off or of performing miracles and that on one occasion, he sent a pot full of noses and ears to his old vakeel at Loharu. It is said that the British forces invaded the State on a request from the emperor at Delhi and when the forces reached Bahadurpur, the country was saved from destruction by offering several lakhs of rupees by Nawab Ahmad Baksh Khan. Others contend that the forces were sent not on the request from the emperor to retaliate the harm done to the Muslims at Alwar but because the Rao committed a breach of the treaty with the British by acquiring Dubbi and Sikrai. The Rao died in 1815. One of his concubines, Musi by name, became Sati. A magnificent chhatri or cenotaph was erected as a memorial at the side of the tank in the rear of the Alwar Palace. In the treaty with Lord Lake he was styled as Maharaja Sawai Bakhtawar Singh. There does not seem to have been any direct grant by the Moghul or British power of either of the title just mentioned, though the former, no doubt, was assumed as soon as the State became independent and the latter was adopted in imitation of Jaipur or perhaps in direct rivalry with it. = Maharao Raja Sawai Viney Singh (1815-57) = Bakhtawar Singh had desired to adopt his nephew Viney Singh, son of his brother Salah Singh of Thana, but the Rao died before the formal ceremonies were completed. The court factions conspired against Viney Singh and enthroned Balwant Singh, an illegitimate son of the late ruler. The pretender was only six years old. His most important supporter was the Nawab of Loharu. After a time, Viney Singh‚Äôs party got the upper hand and the imposter was made a prisoner. In 1826, at the advance of the British force the Maharaja yielded to give concession to Balwant Singh. The claimant who resided at Tijara, died in 1845 childless. Major Powlett assigns Viney Singh a high place and remarks that he was a paragon of a good native chief of the old school, though at times, he was cruel. The Government of the State had previously been carried on without system but with the assistance of some Muslim gentlemen of Delhi whom the Chief took into his service and made Diwans about 1838; great changes were made in the administrative system. He was a great patron of arts and letters, and attracted painters and skilled artisans from various parts of India to his service.He has left many splendid monuments to his name, such as a grand extensive palace in the city, and a smaller one called the Moti Dungri or Viney Vilas. But his greatest work was building of a large bandh at Siliserh, now a fine lake and tourist destination. During the last five years of his life he suffered from paralysis. Bedridden as he was during the Mutiny of 1857, he selected the best of his army and despatched a force consisting of about 800 infantry, 400 cavalry and four guns, to the assistance of the beleaguered British garrison at Agra. The cavalry, among whom were all Rajpuls-the remainder principally Mahomedans. The Nimach and Nasirabad brigade of mutineers came upon them at Achnera, on the road between Bharatpur and Agra. Deserted by their leader and the Mahomedan portion of the force, including the artillery the Rajputs suffered a severe defeat. Viney Singh died in August 1857, before the sorrowful news reached him. = Maharao Raja Sawai Sheodan Singh (1857-1874) = Viney Singh was succeeded by his only surviving son, Sheodan Singh, who was twelve years of age at the time. The actual administration passed on to his Dewan, The Dewan had a domineering influence over the young ruler, so much so that the latter adopted Mohammadan style of dress and speech. On a night of 1858, the Rajputs, under the leadership of Lakhdhir Singh, the Thakur of Bijwad, raised the standard of revolt and raided the dwelling of the Dewan. The Dewan, sensing the danger fled away. When Captain Nixon, Political Agent of Bharatpur was informed of the incident, he proceeded to Alwar. A council of Administration was appointed by Nixon under the presidentship of Thakur Lakhdhir Singh. Captain Impey was appointed Political Agent of Ulwur in November 1858. He constituted a new Council consisting of five Thakurs for salvaging the administration, ruined by Dewans. Another council was also constituted to carry on its duties in a most satisfactory manner until the Maharao Raja was invested with power in 1863. A protracted tussel had been going between the Alwar ruler and the Raja of Nimrana. The former considered the latter as a mere jagirdar of the Alwar State whereas the latter claimed complete independence. The dispute came to an cud in 1868 when the Raja of Nimrana was allowed to enjoy the civil and criminal powers within his estate subject to some rules. He was to pay an annual tribute to the Alwar State, equal to l/8th of his land revenue and Rs. 500/- as Nazarana. Thus, Nimrana was made a feudatory of Alwar. As soon as the Maharao acquired the reins of his State, he renewed his contacts with the expelled Dewan, who continued to exercise his influence through his agents at Alwar court. The Musalman ministers escheated the jagirs of Charans, Brahamans and Rajputs. This resulted in a general unrest. When the Maharao ignoredd their grievances,disgruntled Rajputs, assembled at Khohara with their troops and resolved to expel the Muslims from the State. However, Captain James Blaire, the Political Agent for East Rajputana took timely action and assured the restoration of their jagirs. But the Maharao was adamant and refused to buzz an inch. Thereupon the faction resorted to arms and besieged Hamirpur. The Maharao also sent his troops to protect the village but these were routed. Major Cadell, who was Agent at Bharatpur tried to bring about a reconciliation. With permission of the British Government, he interfered in the administration of the State by dismissing the unscrupulous and inefficient officers. The refractory jagirdars who had stopped paying the revenue, were punished. A plot to kill Major Cadell was unearthed timely which had been hatched at the connivance of the Maharao. The financial bankruptcy of the State was inevitable. The Council was composed of four Naruka Thakurs, and a Brahman. A fixed allowance and an establishment was granted to the Maharao. Reforms in the road system were effected, Post and Telegraph lines were laid and systematic survey of the land was made. The Maharao, being divested of all powers, led a miserable life, fell ill, and soon passed away. = Maharaj Sawai Mangal Singh (1874-1892) = The ruler left no heir to the throne and the families of the Barah Kothri were not unanimous in his selection. At last, the Government of India put up the two candidates before the Barah Kothri, Mangal Singh of Thana was supported by a majority and consequently, the Viceroy confirmed him as the ruler of Alwar. He ascended the throne on December 14, 1874. He was fifteen years and a month old at the time. The young ruler joined the Mayo College, Ajmer on October 22, 1875. On February, 1877, he married the second daughter of Maharaj Prithvisingh, ruler of Kishangarh. His second wife was from Ratlam whom he married in 1878. He was created an Honorary Lieutenant Colonel in the British army in 1885 and the following year, was enrolled as a Knight Grand Commander of the Most Exalted Order of the Star of India. He received the dignified title of Maharaja as a hereditary distinction in 1889. He died at the age of 34 years, on May 22, 1892 at Nainital, owing to excess dose of liquor. = Sawai Maharaja Sir Jey Singh (1892-1937) = Maharaja Mangal Singh was succeeded by his minor son, Jey Singh, He was educated at the Mayo College, Ajmer and was invested with ruling powers on December 10, 1903 by Lord Curzon, Under his reign, the police department of the State was reorganised, He attended the Delhi Darbar held on the occasion of coronation of Emperor Edward VII and met the Emperor the next year, on December 15, 1905 when he visited this country. In 1907-08 the official language was changed from Urdu to Hindi. The British Government conferred the title of K.C.S.I. upon him in 1909. The Alwar State liberally supported the war effort of the British Government during the World War I. The Mangal Lancers and Jey Paltan fought on various fronts-Suez Canal, Egypt, Sinai, Ghaza and Rapha. The Maharaja was appointed Honorary Lieutenant Colonel in the British army on January 1 , 1915 and an Honorary Colonel on 1st January, 1921. At the end of the war, the title of G.C.I.E, was conferred on him on January 1, 1919 and that of G.C.S.I., on June 3, 1924. He attended the Imperial Conference held in London in 1923 as a representative of India and was a prominent figure in the Chamber of Princes and at the First Round Table Conference. He was a fine polo and racquet player, a scholar of Hindu philosophy and an orator of higher order. He was an outstanding personality in many ways and participated in many National and International conferences. He frequently and fearlessly gave vent to his ideas of nationalism. He always spoke eloquently of the fine cultural heritage and greatness of India as a whole. He had equal command over English and Hindi and also knew Sanskrit. The high British officers in India were already unhappy with him because he would never acknowledge their superiority or submit to them.Bad finances of the State coupled with Meo agitation and the Neemuchana massacre, gave the British authorities opportunity to interfere in his administration and he was in 1933, ultimately asked to leave the State. He died in Paris on 19th May, 1937 leaving no lineal or adopted son.  Maharaja Tej Singh (1937-1947)  Sawai Maharaja Sir Tej Singh born on March 19, 1911, was installed on the throne on July 22, 1937. Education made strides during his reign. A number of schools were opened and upgraded. Various communities also started hostels with State aid. Sanskrit College was also opened. The area where Hope Circus now stands was made into a beautiful marketing centre. The closing period of the Maharaja‚Äôs rule was marred by communal frenzy in which several hundred lives were lost and many more, migrated from the State. After attainment of independence, the ruler signed the instrument of accession which made the Stale a component part of the United States of Matsya. Following the Partition of India in 1947, Alwar acceded unto the dominion of India with the state's forces participating in and encouraging the killings and expulsion of its Muslim population.https://www.jstor.org/stable/20837002 On 18 March 1948, the state merged with three neighbouring princely states (Bharatpur, Dholpur and Karauli) to form the Matsya Union. This union in turn merged unto the Union of India. On 15 May 1949, it was united with certain other princely states and the territory of Ajmer to form the present-day Indian state of Rajasthan.

It is located west of Albuquerque, New Mexico. It was closed by the Air Force in 1968 and turned over to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). The site is now data-tied into the Joint Surveillance System (JSS). History West Mesa Air Force Station was established as part of the planned deployment by Air Defense Command of forty-four Mobile radar stations across the United States to support the permanent Radar network established during the Cold War for air defense of the United States. This deployment had been projected to be operational by mid-1952. Funding, constant site changes, construction, and equipment delivery delayed deployment. A temporary Lashup (L-45) station was operational at Kirtland AFB by late 1949. The Lashup station provided coverage for the Albuquerque-Los Alamos region. The site used AN/CPS-5 and AN/CPS-4 radars, and initially the station functioned as a Ground-Control Intercept (GCI) and warning station. As a GCI station, the squadron's role was to guide interceptor aircraft toward unidentified intruders picked up on the unit's radar scopes. In late 1952 an AN/CPS-5 radar was still operating on a Lashup basis to provide temporary coverage. Meanwhile, plans to permanently site the radar on Mt. Vulcan (located within what is now the Petroglyph National Monument) were thwarted by an owner who refused to sell at the price offered. Instead, the Air Force selected a site twenty-two miles west of Albuquerque, on West Mesa. The 687th Aircraft Control and Warning Squadron (AC&W; Sq) was assigned to West Mesa AFS on 1 April 1956. At this site the 687th AC&W; Sq used AN/MPS-7 search and AN/MPS-14 height- finder radars. In 1960 West Mesa AFS was also handling air-traffic-control functions for the Federal Aviation Administration. In 1961 the site hosted an AN/FPS-20 search radar. On 31 July 1963, the site was redesignated as NORAD ID Z-94. By 1966 the 687th AC&W; Squadron was operating an AN/FPS-91A search set. In addition to the main facility, West Mesa operated an AN/FPS-14 Gap Filler site: * Zuni, NM (M-94B): The Air Force inactivated West Mesa Air Force Station on 8 September 1968. In July 1969 the station was officially surplused to the General Aviation Administration. 4.3 acres was transferred to the Federal Aviation Administration in January 1970. The remaining 38 acres were transferred, along with 54 buildings, to the Office of Economic Opportunity on July 1970, which then quitclaimed the property to three private owners. 10 acres of the housing area was then sold to individual private owners. The FAA continues to operate the AN/FPS-91A search radar and is now data-tied into the Joint Surveillance System (JSS).

Opened in 1868, it forms part of the Naples‚ÄìFoggia railway, and is also a terminus of three secondary railways, linking Benevento with Campobasso, Avellino, and Cancello, respectively. The station is currently managed by Rete Ferroviaria Italiana (RFI). However, the commercial area of the passenger building is managed by Centostazioni. Train services on all lines other than the Cancello line are operated by Trenitalia. Each of these companies is a subsidiary of Ferrovie dello Stato (FS), Italy's state-owned rail company. Train services on the Cancello line are operated by Ente Autonomo Volturno,:it:MetroCampania NordEst which is owned by the Consorzio UnicoCampania:it:Consorzio UnicoCampania group. Location Benevento railway station is situated at Piazza Vittoria Colonna, northwest of the city centre. History The station was opened on 18 April 1868, upon the inauguration of the Casalduni‚ÄìBenevento section of the Naples‚ÄìFoggia railway. On 1 August 1868, the station became a through station, when the next section of the Naples‚ÄìFoggia railway was completed, between Benevento and Montecalvo Irpino. Over the years, several other lines converged on the station. During its life, the station has undergone several changes, such as the construction of a new passenger building, and the restructuring of its underpasses. At the start of 2007, it was completely automated. Features The current passenger building is a two-storey structure that was built during the late 1960s. It is formed of a central section featuring five large arched windows, and two lateral wings. At ground floor level, there are services for passengers, while the first floor houses Trenitalia offices. There is also an office of the railway police. In the station yard, there are five through tracks used for passenger services. The station yard also has three platforms equipped with shelters and joined via a pedestrian underpass. Additionally, there are some dock platforms for terminating trains to and from Naples. The station also has a goods yard with several tracks, and a locomotive shed for diesel locomotives. Train services The station has about 800,000 passenger movements each year. In recent years, the number of passenger movements has fallen appreciably, due to poor patronage on some of the converging lines. All passenger trains passing through the station stop there, including Eurostar Italia and InterCity trains. The station is also the terminus of regional trains to and from Campobasso, Caserta, Salerno, Napoli Centrale, Avellino and Foggia. The station is served by the following services (incomplete): *High speed services (Eurostar Frecciargento) Rome - Foggia - Bari - Brindisi - Lecce *Intercity services Rome - Foggia - Bari (- Taranto) *Night train (Intercity Night) Rome - Foggia - Bari - Brindisi - Lecce *Regional trains (Treno regionale) Naples - Aversa - Caserta - Benevento - Ariano Irpino - Foggia Interchange The station has a city bus terminal for buses operated by AMTS, the local bus service.

Evolutionary Catastrophes: The Science of Mass Extinctions. Cambridge, Cambridge University Press, 1999; p. 95. The similarity between the geochemical data of Rajmahal volcanos and lavas of the Kerguelen Plateau confirms this. According to plate tectonics, the Indian subcontinent was over this hot spot during the Cretaceous Period. The original lava flow covered an area of nearly . Below the Bengal basin the flows cover . Lithology The Rajmahal volcanics are predominantly tholeiitic basalt, quartz tholeiite, olivine tholeiite and alkali basalt. The Intertrappean Beds are composed of sedimentary rock such as siltstone, claystone and shale. Structural evolution The western boundary of the Rajmahal Traps is faulted and down-thrown towards the east. The eastern boundary of this trap has a North-South trending, fault-controlled basement. This basement connects the Purnea basin of the Ganga valley with the Bengal basin. These faulted contacts, along with the Damodar Gondwana graben, form a triple junction at the mouth of the Bengal basin. The traps evolved along the then eastern continental margin of India, following rifting of Gondwanaland. Over the epochs, the upper part of the lava deformed in a cold, brittle fashion and formed graben structures. Fossils The Intertrappean Beds contain an assemblage of Lower Cretaceous plant fossils.

Breval was descended from a French refugee protestant family, and was the son of Francis Durant de Breval, prebendary of Westminster, where he was probably born about 1680. Sir John Bramston, in his Autobiography, p. 157, describes the elder Breval in 1672 as 'formerly a priest of the Romish church, and of the companie of those in Somerset House,This refers to the chapel built by Inigo Jones where Henrietta Maria of France, wife of King Charles I, could exercise her Roman Catholic religion. but now a convert to the protestant religion and a preacher at the Savoy.' Bramston gives 1666 as the date of his conversion. The younger Breval was admitted a Queen's Scholar of Westminster School in 1693, was elected to Trinity College, Cambridge, 1697, and was one of the Cambridge poets who celebrated in that year the return of William III after the peace of Ryswick. Breval proceeded B. A. 1700, and M.A. 1704. In 1702 he was made fellow of Trinity ('of my own electing,' said Bentley). In 1708 he was involved in a private scandal, which led to his removal from the fellowship. He engaged in an intrigue with a married lady in Berkshire, and cudgelled her husband, who ill-treated his wife. The husband brought an action against Breval, who was held to bail for the assault, 'but, conceiving that there was an informality in the proceedings against him,' did not appear at the assizes, and was outlawed. Thereupon the Master, Richard Bentley, took the matter up, and on 5 April 1708 expelled Breval from the college. Bentley admitted that Breval was 'a man of good learning and excellent parts,' but said his 'crime was so notorious as to admit of no, evasion or palliation' (State of Trinity College, p. 29 et seq. 1710). Breval, however, declared on oath that he was not guilty of immoral conduct in the matter, and bitterly resented the interposition of Bentley, who, he declared, had a private grudge both against his father and himself. His friends said 'that the alleged offence rested on mere rumour and suspicion,' and that the expelled fellow would have good grounds for an action against the college. Such an action, however, was never brought, probably on account of Breval's poverty. As Bentley wrote, 'his father was just dead [Francis Breval d. February 1707] in poor circumstances, and all his family were beggars.' Breval, in want and with his character ruined, enlisted in despair as a volunteer in our army in Flanders, where he soon rose to be an ensign. Here what Nichols calls 'his exquisite pencil and genteel behaviour,' as well as his skill in acquiring languages, attracted the attention of Marlborough. The general appointed him captain, and sent him on diplomatic missions to various German courts, which he accomplished very creditably. The Peace of Utrecht closed the war in 1713, and a few years after we find Breval busily writing for the London booksellers, chiefly under the name of Joseph Gay. He then wrote 'The Petticoat,' a poem in two books (1716), of which the third edition was published under the name of 'The Hoop Petticoat' (1720): 'The Art of Dress,' a poem (1717) ; 'Calpe or Gibraltar,' a poem (1717) ; 'A Compleat Key to the Nonjuror' (1718), in which he accuses Colley Cibber of stealing his characters, &c.;, from various sources, but chiefly from Moliere's 'Tartuffe,' for the revival of which Breval wrote a prologue ; 'MacDermot, or the Irish Fortune Hunter,' a poem (1719), a witty but extremely gross piece ; and 'Ovid in Masquerade' (1719). He also wrote a comedy, The Play is the Plot (1718), which was acted, though not very successfully, at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane. When altered and reprinted afterwards as a farce, called The Strollers (second impression 1727), it had better fortune. About 1720 Breval went abroad with George Cholmondeley, Viscount Malpas, as travelling tutor.Alicia M. Canto, \\"Los viajes del caballero ingl√©s John Breval a Espa√±a y Portugal: Novedades arqueol√≥gicas y epigr√°ficas de 1726\\", Revista Portuguesa de Arqueologia 7/2, 2004, 265-364 + 24 l√°ms., including some biographical novelties about Breval (in Spanish). It was probably during this journey that he met with the romantic adventure that gave occasion for Alexander Pope's sneer about being 'followed by a nun' (Dunciad, iv. 327). A nun confined against her will, in a convent at Milan, fell in love with and 'escaped to him.' The lady afterwards went to Rome, where, according to Horace Walpole, she 'pleaded her cause and was acquitted there, and married Breval ;' but she is not noticed in the account which Breval published of his travels, under the title of 'Remarks on several Parts of Europe,' four vols. (vols. i/ii, 1726; vols. i/ii. 1738), though we have a somewhat elaborate description of Milan, and an account of 'a Milanese Lady of great Beauty, who bequeathed her Skeleton to the Publick as a memento mori.' The cause of Pope's quarrel with Breval is to be sought elsewhere. The well- known poet John Gay, with the help of Pope and John Arbuthnot, produced the farce entitled Three Hours after Marriage, which was deservedly damned. At this time (1717) Breval, who was writing a good deal for Edmund Curll, wrote for him, under the pseudonym of 'Joseph Gay,' a satire called The Confederates,The Confederates. Open Library. in which 'the late famous comedy' and its three authors were unsparingly ridiculed. Pope is described in the prologue as one \\"On whom Dame Nature nothing good bestowed: In Form a Monkey; but for spite a Toad,\\" and he is represented (scene 1) as saying, 'And from My Self my own Thersites drew,' and then Thersites is explained as 'A Character in Homer, of an Ill-natur'd, Deform'd Villain.' In the same year Breval published, under similar auspices, Pope's 'Miscellany.' The second part consisted of five brief coarse and worthless poems, in one of which especially, called the 'Court Ballad,' Pope is mercilessly ridiculed. Revenge for these was taken in the Dunciad, and Breval's name occurs twice in the second book (1728). In the notes (1729) affixed to the first passage Pope says that some account must be given of Breval owing to his obscurity, and declares that Curll put 'Joseph Gay' on such pamphlets that they might pass for Mr. Gay's (viz. John Gay's). In 1742, when Breval had been dead four years, the fourth book of the 'Dunciad' was published. In line 272 a 'lac'd Governor from France' is introduced with his pupil, and their adventures abroad are narrated at some length (273‚Äì336). Pope, though, as he states, giving him no particular name, chiefly had Breval in his mind when he wrote the lines (Horace Walpole, Notes on the Poems of Alexander Pope, p. 101, contributed by Sir W. Fraser, 1876). After the publication of his 'Travels'J. D.

In the latter period of his life he wrote 'The Harlot's Progress,' an illustrated poem in six cantos, suggested by Hogarth's well-known prints, and said by Ambrose Philips, in a prefatory letter, to be 'a true Key and lively Explanation of the Painter's Hieroglyphicks' (1732); The History of the most Illustrious House of Nassau, with regard to that branch of it more particularly that came into the succession of Orange (1734) ; The Rape of Helen, a mock opera (acted at Covent Garden), (1737).

Its capital was at Saraikela. The state had an area of 1163 km¬≤ which yielded an average revenue of Rs.92,000 in 1901, and was one of the nine Chota Nagpur States under the authority of the governor of Bengal Presidency. The last ruler of the state, Raja Aditya Pratap Singh Deo, signed the merger agreement acceding to the Indian Union on 18 May 1948. History The state was founded in 1620 by Raja Bikram Singh (a forerunner to the ruling family's current nomenclature of Singh Deo). The state came under the influence of the Maratha rulers of Nagpur in the 18th century, and became a princely state of British India in 1803, at the conclusion of the Second Anglo-Maratha War at Deogaon of Orissa. After the war, the East India Company included the Saraikela princely state under the governance of the Chhota Nagpur Commissioner. In 1912 Saraikela came under the authority of the province of Bihar and Orissa, which was newly created from the eastern districts of Bengal. In 1936 the state was placed under the authority of the Orissa Province. Saraikela, along with 24 other princely states of the Eastern States Agency, acceded to the Government of India on 1 January 1948, with a will to merge the princely state with Orissa province of the Indian Republic. As a result both Saraikela and Kharsawan princely states were merged with Orissa in 1948. On 1 January 1948 itself, the tribals of these two princely states, who were in a majority, revolted against the merger with Orissa. This was supported by Patayet Sahib Maharajkumar Bhoopendra Narayan Singh Deo, third son of Raja Aditya Pratap Singh Deo, as a result of which he was imprisoned to ensure the popular movement died down. The central government appointed a commission under Mr. Baudkar to look into the matter. On the basis of the Baudkar commission report, Saraikela and Kharsawan princely states were merged with Bihar on 18 May 1948. These two princely states became part of Jharkhand when the state was separated from Bihar on 15 November 2000. From 18 May 1948 onward, many non-tribal Oriyas of the districts of Saraikela Kharsawan, East Singhbhum, and West Singhbhum have migrated and settled permanently in Odisha.

He was one of the supposed authors of Junius's Letters. Early life William Burke, the son of barrister John Burke and only very questionably a kinsman of Edmund Burke, called though \\"cousin\\", was born in London. He was admitted to Westminster School in 1743, and elected to Christ Church, Oxford in 1747. He contributed a copy of elegiacs to the university collection on the death of the Prince of Wales in 1751, and took the degree of B.C.L. in 1755. The two kinsmen were travelling companions in 1752, worked together on the Account of the European Settlements in America, which seems to have been written by W. Burke, and joined in befriending Emin the Armenian. In 1763 Burke appeared as the friend of Ralph Verney, 2nd Earl Verney, and a confidential mediator between him and George Grenville. He was under-secretary to Henry Seymour Conway, the Secretary of State for the Southern Department, and the following year was moved into the northern department. On the downfall of the Rockingham ministry Burke resigned his office, which brought him ¬£1,000 a year. He and Edmund Burke had befriended James Barry, a Cork painter, and sent him to Italy at their expense to study, and in a letter written to Barry in 1766 Burke says that their affairs‚Äîevidently speaking of his kinsmen Edmund and Richard‚Äîwere so \\"well arranged\\" that they were not uneasy at the prospect of a change in the ministry which would entail loss of place. In parliament Burke owed his return to parliament as member for Great Bedwyn in Wiltshire, on 16 June 1766, to his friendship with Lord Verney, who seems to have been a partner in speculations. In March 1768 Robert Brudenell was returned in his place, but, as the latter chose another constituency, Burke regained his seat in the following May, and held it until the dissolution in September 1774. Burke did not take a prominent part in the debates of the house. \\"As an orator\\", Horace Walpole says, \\"he had neither manner nor talents, and yet wanted little of his cousin's presumption\\".Memoirs of the Reign of George III, ii. 274 He was pushy and well acquainted with the leaders of the whig party, though generally disliked by them. He lived much with his cousin Edmund, first in Queen Anne Street and afterwards at Gregories. For a time Burke's stockjobbing transactions prospered. In 1769, however, a crash came, and he was ruined. With William Markham, his old schoolmaster, he had been on terms of friendship. About the time of his disaster, however, their intimacy ceased, and in 1771 Markham, then bishop of Chester, in a letter addressed to Edmund Burke, accused him of saying something in, as it seems, a private conversation with himself which rendered him liable to \\"a criminal prosecution in a matter of state.\\" This accusation was part of an attack made by the bishop on Edmund Burke, who in the draft of his reply speaks warmly of his kinsman's character, and of the kindness he had shown him in introducing him to Lord Rockingham, in the resignation of his office, and on other occasions. Burke's relationship to his cousin gained him admission to the club in Gerrard Street, and accordingly he appears in Oliver Goldsmith's \\"Retaliation\\". Among the various stories told about the occasion of this poem, it is said that the notices Goldsmith first wrote of the Burkes were so severe, that Hugh Boyd persuaded the poet to alter them and entirely rewrite the character of William, for he was sure that if the Burkes saw what was originally written of them the peace of the club would be disturbed. Having lost his seat for Great Bedwyn, Burke, in the summer of 1774, contested Haslemere in Surrey, was defeated, and petitioned unsuccessfully, the election being confirmed in May 1775. To India Broken in fortune and harassed by judgments against him for debt, Burke vainly sought a place in the East India Company's service. The feeling against him was strong, and he found no friends. In 1777 Burke went to Madras, carrying despatches for George Pigot, 1st Baron Pigot, from whom he hoped to obtain employment. On his arrival at Madras he found Pigot had died. He brought out with him letters of recommendation from Edmund and John Burke to Philip Francis, asking Francis to do something for him in case he should go to Bengal. These letters he sent to Francis, who wrote kindly to him, inviting him to his house, but telling him at the same time that he could do little to help him. He did not accept Francis's invitation, for having obtained the appointment of agent to the Rajah of Tanjore he returned to England. Last years In 1779 he went back to India as deputy paymaster of the king's troops, and in 1782 was made commissary-general of the forces in the East Indies. Lord Cornwallis considered that the sending of him out was ‚Äòan unnecessary job,‚Äô and said in a letter to Lord Rawdon, dated 1789, that he had done him what service he could, but that with Burke service meant putting large sums of money into his pocket, and that if he had done that he would have deserved to be impeached, giving two examples of the ‚Äòextraordinary‚Äô proposals which Burke made for his own advantage, and to which he refused to consent. After his return to England in 1793 Burke lived mainly at Beaconsfield, and Edmund Burke's letters document a decline in his health. He also was pursued for his debt to Earl Verney, who had died in 1791, on behalf of his heir, Mary Verney, Baroness Fermanagh (1737‚Äì1810), and was arrested in 1794. Released by an arrangement, his position was still precarious. Edmund had him moved covertly to the Isle of Man, with the help of an associate, Thomas Venables of the Home Office. William Burke survived Edmund, and died in 1798, on the Isle of Man. Works Burke came into notice in 1759, as the author of \\"Remarks on the Letter to Two Great Men\\", an answer to Lord Bath's \\"Letter to Pitt and the Duke of Newcastle\\" on the prospect of peace. In this pamphlet, and in another entitled \\"An Examination of the Commercial Principles of the late Negotiation\\", 1761, Burke, who held the office of secretary to Guadeloupe in 1762, strongly advocated the British retention of the island. Burke is said by Horace Walpole to have written with ingenuity and sharpness, and to have done good service to his party with his pen. An attempt has been made by Jelinger Cookson Symons to show that he was or may have been the author of Junius's Letters. Besides the share he had in the European Settlements in America, and the pamphlets on the peace negotiations, from 1764 onwards Burke appears occasionally to have written letters on political matters, chiefly under the signature of \\"Valens\\", in the London Evening Post and other papers. Some of these letters are said to have been written in conjunction with Edmund Burke. He also made a translation the address of Jacques-Pierre Brissot to his constituents in 1794, which was submitted to Edmund Burke, who amended it and wrote a preface. Some of Burke's letters are contained in the correspondence of Edmund Burke, and in Barry's works.

It was built from 1912 to 1914 for Fred Loring Seely, the son in law of Edwin Wiley Grove. He built the castle after his father-in-law gave him ten acres on top of Sunset Mountain. The property was added to the National Register of Historic Places on October 22, 1980. History The house has had five known owners. The Seelys lived there until 1942, when Mr. Seely died at age 70. In the winter of 1949, Evelyn Grove Seely, daughter of entrepreneur Edwin Wiley Grove and widow of Fred Seely, offered to sell her former home to the second owner, Asheville-Biltmore College. The college was there from 1949 to 1961, until they outgrew the available facilities. The limited area for developing new buildings caused the trustees to move the college to its current site on the northern edge of Asheville. The third owner was Mr. Jerry Sternberg. He upgraded the heating system from coal to oil fuel and put a new roof on the structure. He planned to turn the house into a museum but his plan never came to fruition. He then sought to turn the facility over to a non- profit organization. Overlook Ministries was the fourth owner. The fifth and current owner is the Wells family.

Alaus oculatus, preserved specimen Description Alaus oculatus can reach a length of about . They have an elongated body, black in colour throughout. The pronotum exhibits a large oval patch of darker scales, framed in white, on each side - the common name of the beetle derives from this feature. The elytra are striated and mottled with silvery whitish scales. The \\"false eyes\\" depicted on the pronotum are a defensive adaption designed to confuse or frighten potential predators. Like all click beetles, A. oculatus is also capable of suddenly catapulting itself out of danger by releasing the energy stored by a click mechanism, which consists of a stout spine on the prosternum and a matching groove in the mesosternum. Life Cycle Eggs are laid in soil. Larvae are predators of beetle larvae feeding in decaying wood, especially Cerambycidae. Diet Their diet consists of nectar and plant juice. The larvae diet consists of grubs of wood-boring beetles. Distribution and habitat This species is present in Central and North America. It can be found in deciduous/mixed forests and woodlands.

ESG manufactures and installs microseismic instrumentation and performs microseismic data processing and interpretation services. It is headquartered in Kingston, Ontario, Canada, with operations in Calgary, Houston, Denver and Beijing and offices in Perth and Dubai. 2013 marks ESG's 20th anniversary of providing microseismic services. The company was purchased by FTSE 250 Index constituent, Spectris, in December 2014. Leaders in Microseismic Monitoring ESG Solutions was founded in 1993 as Engineering Seismology Group Inc. The company performs microseismic monitoring services for the oil and gas, mining and geotechnical industries, but its roots lie in microseismic monitoring for the Canadian mining industry. The group was loosely formed out of the Engineering Seismology Lab at Queen‚Äôs University in Kingston, Ontario, Canada that was performing research on a form of seismology called microseismics, or 'passive seismic'. =History= Microseismic science is the study of very small scale earthquakes that are induced by industrial processes such as mining or oil production. In the 1980s, many mines in northern Ontario were experiencing increased seismic activity, including a large rockburst which killed 4 miners in Sudbury in 1984. In response to this accident, a consortium of mining companies was established with government support to develop monitoring systems to acquire seismic waveforms and to study the causes and mechanisms of rockbursts. The research lab at Queen‚Äôs University set out to develop instrumentation, software and processing routines to locate the source of microseismic activity in mines, and when the lab disbanded in the early 1990s, ESG‚Äôs founders continued this work in a commercial capacity. In December 2014, Spectris plc acquired ESG Solutions. Retsof Salt Mine, New York ESG's first permanent seismic system installation took place at the Retsof Salt Mine in the Genesee Valley near Retsof, New York. In 1994, the Retsof Salt Mine was the largest salt mine in North America, and the second largest in the world. Mining activities had caused the collapse of a 500 by 500 foot piece of the mine ceiling at a depth of 1,200 feet below the surface. The collapse of the shale ceiling rock compromised the caprock layer separating the mine from overlying ground water, and the mine began to flood. The failure caused a magnitude 3.6 earthquake that was felt on the surface, as well as release of natural gases, declining aquifer levels and surface subsidence. An ESG seismic system was installed using boreholes and surface- based sensors to evaluate the integrity of the mine as it flooded and track the sinkhole generated at the surface. Cotton Valley Consortium ESG began applying the knowledge gained from work in the mining industry to the oil and gas sector. ESG monitored well stimulations using microseismic instrumentation to define event locations and source mechanisms and analyzed microseismicity associated with compaction in the North Sea Ekofisk and Valhall fields.S.C. Maxwell and T.I. Urbancic (2001). \\"The role of passive microseismic monitoring in the instrumented oil field.\\" The Leading Edge (20): 636-639. In 1997, ESG pioneered the use of microseismic analysis in shale gas extraction by providing geometric and fracture growth characteristics for hydraulic fracture stimulations in the Cotton Valley fields in East Texas for Union Pacific Resources (UPR), a member of the Cotton Valley Hydraulic Fracture Imaging Consortium Project.T.I. Urbancic and R. J. Zinno (1998). \\"Cotton Valley Hydraulic Fracture Imaging Project: Feasibility of determining fracture behavior using microseismic event locations and source parameters. SEG Expanded Abstracts. (17): 964-967 The Cotton Valley Hydraulic Fracture Project was initiated in order to determine if microseismicity can be used to accurately map fracture geometry and depict hydraulic fracture growth, and be further employed to improve fracture design (fracture models), optimize the number and location of wells (reservoir drainage), and improve on-site production methodologies. Through this work with UPR and the Cotton Valley Consortium, ESG developed its Fracmap service; the petroleum industry‚Äôs first viable commercial hydraulic fracture imaging and interpretation service in January 2000. EOR in Alberta's Oil Sands Since 2002, ESG has been active in monitoring EOR activities in the heavy oil sands of Western Canada. Microseismic monitoring has proven to be a valuable resource to map steam movement during CSS and SAGD operations, as well as ensuring environmental compliance by mapping containment, caprock integrity and well casing failures. =More Recent Work= In recent years, ESG has been active in providing microseismic monitoring services for hydraulic fracture stimulations throughout North America, including in the Horn River Basin and the Marcellus shale, long-term reservoir monitoring of thermal steam injection operations, permanent monitoring of underground and open-pit mining operations, and CO2 sequestration and gas storage projects. The company has placed an emphasis on furthering advanced microseismic analysis techniques including seismic moment tensor inversion (SMTI) analysis within the hydraulic fracture market. SMTI evaluates the failure mechanisms of the rock as fractures develop and is used to calculate stimulated reservoir volume (SRV), fracture intensity and complexity and develop discrete fracture networks (DFN).A.

The case represents the longest known gap in a non-parental abduction in which the victim was reunited with the family in the United States. For years, Carlina was living with a woman she thought was her mother, who was in fact her kidnapper. She was portrayed by Keke Palmer in the Lifetime film Abducted: The Carlina White Story. Abduction Harlem Hospital Center in Manhattan Carlina was 19 days old when her parents, Joy White and Carl Tyson, took her to the hospital with a fever of on August 4, 1987. She had swallowed fluid during her delivery and had an infection. A woman reportedly dressed as a nurse had comforted the parents at the hospital, but was not a hospital employee. The woman had been seen around the hospital for three weeks prior to the abduction. The baby disappeared during the early morning, around 2 am when the shifts were changing. The hospital had video surveillance, but at the time it was not working. There was no way of knowing what the woman in white looked like except for the description given by Joy White and Carl Tyson. The baby had been receiving intravenous antibiotics when, between 2:30 am and 3:55 am, someone removed the IV line and abducted her. A guard said a woman matching the suspect's description left the hospital at 3:30 am, and that no infant was visible, although the baby could have been concealed in the heavyset woman's smock. The case was the first known infant abduction from a New York hospital. A $10,000 reward was offered by the city of New York in 1987 for the return of Carlina. Flyers with the baby's picture were distributed nationwide, with no success in locating her. Her parents filed a $100 million suit against the hospital in 1989, and obtained a $750,000 settlement in 1993. Carlina's parents separated the year after the abduction and remarried. Life as Nejdra Nance Carlina Renae White was raised as Nejdra \\"Netty\\" Nance by Annugetta \\"Ann\\" Pettway in Bridgeport, Connecticut, just 45 miles from where her parents had lived. White attended Thomas Hooker School and graduated from Warren Harding High School in Bridgeport. Pettway and White later moved to Atlanta, Georgia. White grew suspicious during her teens that Pettway was not her birth mother, because of her inability to provide a birth certificate. In 2005, when White was pregnant with her daughter, she requested Pettway obtain her birth certificate so she could get health insurance. Pettway acquired a forged Connecticut birth certificate, which White attempted to use as proof of identity so she could obtain the health insurance, but the officials told her the document was forged. Later that evening, in a state of shock, White confronted Pettway, who broke down and confessed that she was not White's biological mother. The revelation was not entirely surprising to White as she had begun to notice that she did not share physical traits with Pettway. Pettway lied and told White that she had been abandoned by a drug addict. At age 23, White turned to sites such as the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, where she found that the images of the kidnapped Carlina resembled infant photos of herself as Nejdra and those of her daughter, Samani. She called the center's hotline and was able to contact her birth family. DNA profiling confirmed in January 2011 that she was in fact the missing Carlina White. Investigation and legal proceedings In 1987, New York City Police Department detectives questioned a woman in Baltimore, who witnesses had identified as having been seen in the hospital, without apparent result. After the confirmation that Nejdra Nance was really Carlina White, the Federal Bureau of Investigation began a search for Ann Pettway. The statute of limitations for the state kidnapping law had expired in New York, but there is no statute of limitations for the federal law on kidnapping. An arrest warrant for Ann Pettway was issued by the North Carolina Department of Correction on January 21, 2011, for violating her probation from a conviction for attempted embezzlement. White stated, \\"I just hope that the officials be able to get her in their hands, so we can just hear her side of the story now.\\" Pettway turned herself in to the FBI office at Bridgeport on the morning of January 23, 2011. She had driven from North Carolina to Connecticut to arrange for her biological son to be taken care of. Pettway told federal investigators that she kidnapped White after enduring several miscarriages because of the stress over whether \\"she would ever be able to be a parent.\\" Pettway did not enter a plea at her arraignment at the U.S. District Court for Southern New York in Manhattan, where she faced between 20 years and life in prison for kidnapping. On February 17, 2011, a federal grand jury indicted Pettway on the kidnapping charge. On February 10, 2012, Pettway pleaded guilty to a federal kidnapping charge. As part of a plea bargain, prosecutors agreed to recommend to the judge a prison sentence of 10 to 12¬Ω years.Ann Pettway pleads guilty to baby kidnapping charges, CBSNews.com (February 10, 2012).

Pettway is serving her sentence in the Federal Correctional Institution, Aliceville in Alabama. Aftermath Upon being reunited with her biological parents, Carlina White's attorney advised her to ask them about the cash settlement from the hospital. Joy White and Carl Tyson both confirmed that most of this money had been spent during the years before their reunion, and that a trust fund that had been established was obtainable only if Carlina had been found before the age of 21. Joy White later stated that there had been a falling out over the issue of the money. In May 2011, public defender Robert Baum said that he met Carlina White during preparations for Ann Pettway's trial and that White agreed to testify on Pettway's behalf. By the following July, White became estranged from her biological parents. However, several months later, she contacted both of her biological parents individually, having had a bit more time to process the situation; she later publicly stated that the issue over settlement funds was \\"just a misunderstanding.\\" While \\"Carlina White\\" is her legal name, as it appears on official documents, she says that she will continue to go by \\"Netty\\" in public, since technically, it was neither the name her biological parents gave her, nor the name given to her by the woman who raised her, but rather is \\"[the name] I gave myself.\\" In 2014, White spoke at the Crimes Against Children Conference, the leading national training event for law enforcement professionals working to combat child victimization.https://blog.missingkids.com/post/94820511395/woman- abducted-as-infant-speaks-at-crimes-against As of 2014, she continues to have a relationship with her biological parents.https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/real- life-stories/snatched-girl-who-solved-case-3548709 See also *Child abduction *List of kidnappings *List of solved missing persons cases References Category:1987 births Category:1987 crimes in the United States Category:August 1987 events in the United States Category:Child abduction in the United States Category:Crime in New York City Category:Formerly missing people Category:History of Bridgeport, Connecticut Category:Kidnapped American children Category:Living people Category:Missing person cases in New York (state) Category:People from Harlem ","title":"Kidnapping of Carlina White"},{"id":"30557601","text":"Komsomol'skoe or Komsomolskoye (, Komsomol) is a town in Kobda District in the Aktobe Region of western Kazakhstan.National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency.

His parents moved Delaware County, New York, and Palmer later moved to Chautauqua County, New York and taught school. In 1824 he married Ruth Wells, and the couple had eight children. In 1843, they moved to Hudson, and the next year built the lot on which this house stands. In 1845, they built this house, likely doing the work himself. Ruth Wells Palmer died in 1853, and Palmer married Nancy Gamble. Lorenzo Palmer died in 1874. Description The 1845 Palmer house was built in the style of Greek Revival. It is one of the oldest houses in Hudson and shares a similar design to other houses built in Connecticut and New York at the time. While Palmer was one of many New York natives who moved to Michigan in the 1830s and 1840s, his house is unique among Lenawee County's early houses and retains most of its original characteristics. The house is a two- story central hall plan I-house with a front porch extending the entire length of the front. It sits on a stone foundation and is shingled. The entry door is flanked by beveled glass, and two windows flank the door. The second floor contains five windows. All windows are wood sash, double-hung windows, and either six-over-six, or eight-over-eight. The gable ends of the house display the frieze and cornice returns typical of Greek Revival style. On the interior, a hallway runs through the length of the house, and a closed staircase leads up to two upper bedrooms. On the main floor are a parlor and formal dining room. Two modern additions contain a kitchen, family room, and master bedroom.

Six years earlier, German Samoa was captured by the British shortly after the outbreak of World War I, but it would not be formally annexed by the British Empire until then.  History  =Occupation of German Samoa in World War I= The Union Flag raised in Apia, 30 August 1914 At the outbreak of World War I German Samoa was a German colony. On 7 August 1914, the British government indicated to New Zealand (which was at this time a British dominion), that the seizure of a wireless station near Apia, the colony's capital which was used by the German East Asia Squadron, would be a \\"great and urgent Imperial service\\". This was followed by the first action of New Zealand in the war, the sailing of a Samoa Expeditionary Force on 15 August, which landed at Apia two weeks later. Although Germany refused to officially surrender the colonies, no resistance was offered and the occupation took place without any fighting. Despite claims that German Samoa was the first enemy territory to fall to imperial forces, the first seizure of a German colony had occurred four days earlier when Togoland was captured as part of the West Africa Campaign. Colonel Robert Logan, who had commanded the Samoan Expeditionary Force, was the military administrator of the colony for the remainder of the war. By 1918, Samoa had a population of some 38,000 Samoans and 1,500 Europeans. Approximately one fifth of the population died in the Influenza epidemic of 1918‚Äì1919. In 1919, The Royal Commission of Inquiry into the Epidemic concluded that there had been no epidemic of pneumonic influenza in Western Samoa before the arrival of the SS Talune from Auckland on 7 November 1918, which was allowed to berth by Logan without quarantine precautions. Within seven days of this ship's arrival influenza had become epidemic in Upolu and had then spread rapidly throughout the territory. =Mandate= On 17 December 1920, the League of Nations formally conferred a Class C Mandate over the former German Colony of Samoa to the Dominion of New Zealand. The mandate was supported by the Samoa Constitution Order, 1920, which had replaced the military occupation with a civil administration on 1 May 1920.Samoa Constitution Order, 1920 (1 April 1920; N.Z. Gaz. 1920, p. 1619). Treaties of Peace Act 1919 (29 October 1919; 10 GEO V 1919 No 20); \\"[...] The Governor-General is hereby empowered to make, by Order in Council, such provisions as he deems necessary [...] for the government of the said Islands of Western Samoa[...]\\". The Western Samoa Order in Council, 1920 (11 March 1920; Statutory Rules and Orders 1920, vol 1, pp 745‚Äì746; Gazette, 21 May 1920, p 1819; 113 BFSP 18). On 1 April 1922, the Samoa Act 1921 came into force.Samoa Act 1921 (7 December 1921; 12 GEO V 1921 No 16) Under the Samoa Act the New Zealand Governor-General appointed an administrator based in Apia to hold executive power and to report to the New Zealand Minister of External Affairs in Wellington; lawmaking power was held by the administrator and a local legislative council, although Wellington had final authority. After 1945, the classification of the mandate was changed to a United Nations Trust Territory. =From Mau protests to independence= The Mau (translates as \\"strongly held opinion\\") was a popular non-violent movement which had its beginnings in the early 1900s (decade) in Savai'i. It was first led by Lauaki Namulauulu Mamoe, an orator chief deposed by the German administration. The 1920s saw the resurgence of the Mau in opposition to the New Zealand administration. One of the Mau leaders was Olaf Frederick Nelson, a half Samoan and half Swedish merchant. Nelson was exiled by the administration during the late 1920s and early 1930s, but he continued to assist the organisation financially and politically. On 28 December 1929, the newly elected leader, high chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III, led his fellow uniformed Mau in a peaceful demonstration in downtown Apia. The New Zealand police attempted to arrest the high chief. When he resisted, a struggle occurred between the police and the Mau. The officers began to fire randomly into the crowd and a Lewis machine gun, mounted in preparation for this demonstration, was used to disperse the Mau. Chief Tamasese was shot from behind and killed while trying to bring calm and order to the Mau demonstrators, screaming \\"Peace, Samoa\\". Ten others died that day and approximately fifty were injured by gunshots and police batons. That day would come to be known in Samoa as Black Saturday. The Mau grew, remaining steadfastly non-violent, and expanded to include a highly influential women's branch. After repeated efforts by the Samoan people, Western Samoa gained independence in 1962 and signed a Friendship Treaty with New Zealand. Samoa was the first country in the Pacific to become independent. In 2002, New Zealand's prime minister Helen Clark, on a trip to Samoa, formally apologised for New Zealand's role in these two incidents.

Head of state is a description used in official sources for the monarch. The Australian constitution does not mention the term head of state. In discussion it has been used for describing the person who holds the highest rank among the officers of government. A number of writers, most notably Sir David Smith, have argued that the term is better used to describe the governor-general. The difference of opinion has mainly been discussed in the context of Australia becoming a republic, and was prominently debated in the lead-up to the republic referendum in 1999. Background The Australian constitution dates from 1901, when the Dominions of the British Empire were not sovereign states, and does not use the term head of state. In respect of the government of Australia, the monarch, currently Queen Elizabeth II, who has reigned since 6 February 1952, is represented in Australia by the governor-general, in accordance with the Constitution. Elizabeth II is also the sovereign of fifteen other countries, including the United Kingdom (UK), that are informally known, with Australia, as the Commonwealth realms, and as the sovereign the Queen is regarded as head of state. But in Australia the term \\"head of state\\" has been used in discussion as a convenient term for describing the person holding the highest rank among the officers of government. In his 1993 book The Reluctant Republic, Malcolm Turnbull explained that, at Federation, the \\"Governor-General acted partly as head of state and partly as the local representative of the British Government\\", the latter being the Queen in her Privy Council of the United Kingdom. As with the other former Dominions, Australia gained legislative independence from the UK by virtue of the Statute of Westminster 1931, which was adopted in Australia in 1942 with retroactive effect from 3 September 1939. By the Royal Style and Titles Act 1953, the Australian parliament gave the Queen the title Queen of Australia and, in 1973, removed from the Queen's Australian style and titles any reference to her status as Queen of the United Kingdom and Defender of the Faith. Australia's full independence from the UK was achieved with the Australia Act 1986. Section 61 of the constitution states that \\"The executive power of the Commonwealth is vested in the Queen and is exercisable by the Governor‚ÄëGeneral as the Queen's representative, and extends to the execution and maintenance of this Constitution, and of the laws of the Commonwealth.\\" Section 2 provides that a governor-general shall represent the Queen in Australia. The governor-general is appointed by the monarch on the advice of the prime minister of Australia. In practice, the governor-general carries out all the functions usually performed by a head of state, without reference to the Queen; though the governor-general is the Queen's representative, he or she is not the monarch's delegate or agent. Under the conventions of the Westminster system, the governor-general's powers are almost always exercised on the advice of the prime minister or other ministers of the Crown. The governor-general may use the reserve powers of the Crown as prescribed by the constitution, though these are rarely exercised. One notable example of their use was by Governor-General Sir John Kerr during the Australian constitutional crisis of 1975. The question of whether the Queen or the governor-general is Australia's head of state became a political one in the years prior to the Australian republic referendum in 1999. Among arguments advanced in that campaign some were for retaining the office of governor-general as the monarch's (nominal) representative, and others were for a popularly elected head of state. Republicans included in their campaign the idea that the Queen is head of state and not Australian and, as such, should be replaced with an Australian citizen; this was summed up in their slogan \\"a mate for head of state\\". Opponents of the move to make Australia a republic claim in response that Australia already has an Australian as head of state in the governor- general, who, since 1965, has invariably been an Australian citizen. The governor-general in 2004, Major General Michael Jeffery, said at the time: \\"Her Majesty is Australia's head of state but I am her representative and to all intents and purposes I carry out the full role.\\" However, the following year, he declined to name the Queen as head of state, instead saying in response to a direct question, \\"the Queen is the monarch and I represent her and I carry out all the functions of head of state.\\" The governor-general normally represents Australia internationally, making and receiving state visits, but the Queen also carries out some official duties representing Australia outside Australia, such as in the United Kingdom. Various opinions Within Australia, newspapers, ministers, constitutional scholars and the general public have not always been consistent in references to either the monarch or the governor-general as the head of state. Sir David Smith's lecture reviewing the state of opinion in Australia, published as Papers on Parliament No. 27, March 1996,Sir David Smith \\"An Australian Head of State: An Historical and Contemporary Perspective [1]\\" Papers on Parliament No. 27, March 1996 ended by quoting some remarks made the year before by Sir Gerard Brennan, Chief Justice of Australia, on the oaths of allegiance and office: : \\"The first promise is a commitment of loyalty to Her Majesty the Queen, her heirs and successors according to law. It is a commitment to the head of State under the Constitution. It is from the Constitution that the Oath of Allegiance, which has its origins in feudal England, takes its significance in the present day. As the Constitution can now be abrogated or amended only by the Australian people in whom, therefore, the ultimate sovereignty of the nation resides, the Oath of Allegiance and the undertaking to serve the head of State as Chief Justice are a promise of fidelity and service to the Australian people. The duties which the oath imposes sit lightly on a citizen of the nation which the Constitution summoned into being and which it sustains. Allegiance to a young, free and confident nation, governed by the rule of law, is not a burden but a privilege.\\"(Spoken at a ceremonial sitting of the High Court on 21 April 1995.) Reviewing the position in 2000, former Justice of the High Court of Australia, Michael Kirby concluded that the governor-general would increasingly take over as virtual head of state of Australia and the office would continue to evolve as an Australian peculiarity; and that while most Australians would continue to feel republican in their hearts, many would continue to have a vague lingering affection for the monarch, and some feel a measure of respect for the idea of the Crown as \\"a notion above the transient allegiances of party politics with its vital but often banal concerns.\\"Michael Kirby, The Australian Republican Referendum 1999 ‚Äì Ten Lessons addressing the Faculty of Law, University of Buckingham, UK, 3 March 2000. When Quentin Bryce was Governor-General (2008‚Äì14) The Museum of Australian Democracy summed up the situation: \\"Because the Queen lives in the United Kingdom, she is represented in Australia by the Governor-General, who is in effect Australia's Head of State. Some authorities argue that the Governor-General is Australia's Head of State in every respect: others disagree.\\" =Official sources= The most authoritative sources published by the government of Australia have used the term \\"head of state\\" to refer to the monarch, with some providing explanatory statements. This includes Government House, Parliament House, Public Service Commission, and the Departments of the Attorney-General, Immigration and Citizenship, and Foreign Affairs. The Electoral Council of Australia in one document has used the term to describe the governor-general and state governors in their respective jurisdictions. Yet another calls the governor-general the \\"constitutional Head of State\\" and the Queen the \\"Head of State\\". Presently, the government website states: \\"Under the Constitution, the reigning British monarch is also the Australian monarch, and therefore Australia's Head of State\\". However, between 1992 and 1999, the Commonwealth Government Directory listed the governor-general in these terms: \\"Function: Under the Constitution the Governor-General is the Head of State in whom the Executive Power of the Commonwealth is vested.\\" A comprehensive guide (by David Hamer) to Australian government published by the Australian Senate, declares that Australia has two heads of state in the monarch, who performs a symbolic role, and the Governor-General, who is \\"the constitutional head of state.\\" Prime ministers of Australia have also used the term erratically: in 2009, a media release from Prime Minister Kevin Rudd referred to a tour by Quentin Bryce as a \\"visit to Africa of this scale by Australia‚Äôs Head of State\\" ; and the following year, his spokesperson told the press the Queen \\"held that position\\". In a press release issued that year by the Queen's private secretary to announce the Queen would make a speech to the United Nations, Elizabeth II was mentioned as head of state of Australia, amongst 15 other countries. In the Department of the Parliamentary Library's publication Research Note, Peter Ireland concluded that \\"the Constitution can be used to argue either proposition.\\" The issue has been occasionally raised in the High Court of Australia but never directly ruled on by that court. One ruling, cited first by Professor David Flint and later by Sir David Smith, is the 1907 decision of R v Governor of South Australia, wherein the court inter alia described the governor-general as the \\"Constitutional Head of the Commonwealth\\" (and the Governor of South Australia as the \\"Constitutional Head of the State\\")........ A judgement of the Supreme Court of Victoria, confirmed that aspiring legal practitioners must swear an oath to the Queen when obtaining an admission to practice, said it is known \\"Australia is a constitutional monarchy with Her Majesty The Queen as its Head of State.\\". A decision on freedom of information in 2019 by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal said: \\"While Australia is a self-governing nation, the Queen is the constitutional head of the Australian Government. As the constitutional head of State of Australia and the other Commonwealth realms ...\\".Secretary, Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet and Summers (Freedom of information) , decision of Justice M. A. Perry, Deputy President, [65]. Later, both the Queen and the Prime Minister are said to be \\"heads of State\\", [125]. Internationally, for the purposes of protocol, the United Nations list of heads of state has for Australia \\"(Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II)\\", in brackets, above the name and title of the Governor-General, \\"His Excellency Sir Peter Cosgrove\\"; this is the same as is done for other Commonwealth realms with a governor-general. The United States Department of State in 2010 listed the Queen as head of state and the CIA currently refers to the same person as \\"chief of state\\". Canada's Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade is less clear, listing the names of both the monarch and the governor- general as head of state. The Queen's Royal Household in the United Kingdom has updated the way the term head of state is used in relation to Australia: in 1999, the British monarchy website was altered to replace the description of Elizabeth II as head of state of Australia with one that mentioned her only as \\"sovereign\\". In 2010, the \\"head of state\\" description was restored, but, by 2014, this had again been changed, with the Queen described as \\"Sovereign\\" in the Commonwealth realms, of which Australia is one. =Scholarly sources= Former governor-general and Liberal politician Sir Paul Hasluck stated in 1979 that Australia's monarch is the country's head of state and the Governor- General is her or his representative. The same view has been expressed by former governor-general and legal scholar Sir Zelman Cowen. This position has been supported by many constitutional scholars, including Harrison Moore, George Winterton, and George Williams. Furthermore, George Winterton argued that, because the Governor-General only functions on a federal level, with Governors playing corresponding parts in the States, the Governor-General could not be the head of state for the nation as a whole. A founding member of the monarchist lobby group Australians for Constitutional Monarchy and former Justice of the High Court of Australia, Michael Kirby has long supported the view that the Queen is Australia's head of state. The same view was expressed by the former Chief Justice of the High Court, Sir Anthony Mason. However, Professor Colin Howard argued that, \\"It seems therefore that practice and law now coincide to support the proposition that, certain matters of ceremony and courtesy apart, the head of state in Australia is not the Queen but the Governor-General\\". Professor Owen E. Hughes commented that there was \\"ambiguity\\" on the issue, and described both the monarch and the governor- general as the head of state at different times in the same book. =Political sources= Michael Kirby's opinion aside, Australians for Constitutional Monarchy has often argued that the governor-general is head of state. Sir David Smith, a former Official Secretary to five governors-general, holds that the governor-general is head of state, while the Queen is Australia's sovereign, since the constitution directs the governor-general, and not the monarch, to carry out the duties of head of state; and Professor David Flint, convenor of Australians for Constitutional Monarchy, feels the same way, believing the High Court's 1907 decision R v Governor of South Australia resolves the issue as a constitutional description. Professor Flint asserts that the term head of state is a diplomatic one and is governed by international law and notes that, as the governor-general is sent overseas and received as head of state, she is, under international law, a head of state. He says this has only become an issue because the republicans have been unable to raise other reasons to change the constitution, highlighting that it was argued nine times by the republicans in the official Yes/No booklet sent to voters in the referendum. However, in 1995, the one-time Director of Australians for Constitutional Monarchy, and later Liberal prime minister, Tony Abbott, described the Queen as the \\"titular Head of State\\" of Australia. The Australian Monarchist League (AML) does not deviate from the official position. In an article titled \\"Monachists Affirm ‚Äì Queen is Head of State\\", National Chairman Phillip Benwell says this \\"has been advised in writing to me on several occasions by the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet\\" The view of the Australian Republican Movement is also consistent with official position. Leading republican and former prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull argued in 1993: \\"As long as we have the British Queen as our Head of State, other nations everywhere, not just in Asia, will regard us as somewhat less than independent.\\" =Media sources= Mainstream media sometimes uses the term head of state to describe the governor-general.The Canberra Times, Editorial, 8 December 1977Naomi Levin, Insight into Sir Zelman Cowen, Australian Jewish News, 14 October 2009, accessed 27 February 2011Simon Kearney, $3 million bill for Australia's former governors-general, Sunday Herald-Sun, 24 October 2010, accessed 27 February 2011Australia Network News, Australian head of state bound for Kuwait , 21 February 2011, accessed 27 February 2011 A detailed editorial is from The Australian, prior to the Queen making a United Nations speech, saying: > [T]he Queen has reasserted her claim on the title \\"head of state\\" of > Australia by using it in the announcement of her address to the UN in July > ... In recent years, particularly after the debate and referendum on a > republic in 1999, the local convention has been to recognise that the > Governor-General is Australia's head of state and that Elizabeth II is our > sovereign ... a spokesman for [Prime Minister] Rudd said: \\"Australia's head > of state is HM Queen Elizabeth II, represented by the Governor-General HE Ms > Quentin Bryce AC. The government is aware of the plan for the Queen to > address the United Nations.\\" In international media, the Queen has been presented as Australia's head of state, and in some cases the term \\"British monarch\\" is used. Comparison with other Commonwealth realms In some of the sixteen Commonwealth realms, the monarch is explicitly defined as the head of state. For example, Section 2 of New Zealand's Constitution Act 1986 states: \\"The Sovereign in right of New Zealand is the head of State of New Zealand, and shall be known by the royal style and titles proclaimed from time to time.\\" Likewise, in Part V of the Constitution of Papua New Guinea, the Queen is labelled Head of State of Papua New Guinea. In Canada, some difference of opinion exists over whether the Queen of Canada or the Governor General of Canada should be considered the country's head of state; and there is some inconsistency among politicians, scholars, and the media in the application of the description to either individual. Canadian monarchists assert the Queen is head of state. The Canadian constitution does not use the term \\"head of state\\". However, it does state that: \\"The Executive Government and Authority of and over Canada is hereby declared to continue and be vested in the Queen.\\"Constitution Act, 1867, s. 9.

In fact, it can be shown that in a vacuum, spacetime will always be locally flat (or de Sitter or anti-de Sitter depending upon the cosmological constant). This makes (2+1)-dimensional topological gravity (2+1D topological gravity) a topological theory with no gravitational local degrees of freedom. Physicists became interested in the relation between Chern‚ÄìSimons theory and gravity during the 1980s. During this period, Edward Wittenurl=http://srv2.fis.puc.cl/~mbanados/Cursos/TopicosRelatividadAvanzada/Witten2.pdf argued that 2+1D topological gravity is equivalent to a Chern‚ÄìSimons theory with the gauge group SO(2,2) for a negative cosmological constant, and SO(3,1) for a positive one. This theory can be exactly solved, making it a toy model for quantum gravity. The Killing form involves the Hodge dual. Witten later changed his mind, and argued that nonperturbatively 2+1D topological gravity differs from Chern‚ÄìSimons because the functional measure is only over nonsingular vielbeins. He suggested the CFT dual is a Monster conformal field theory, and computed the entropy of BTZ black holes.

Out of the convention came the impetus which gave birth to the roads which consolidated in 1853 to form the New York Central Railroad.

This was followed by the incorporation of the Auburn & Syracuse Railroad. At that time, Auburn, New York was a larger village than Syracuse therefore its name was mentioned first in the company title. =Auburn & Syracuse railroad= Syracuse railroad \\"subscribers\\" contributed $31,000 to the $400,000 stock authorized in the incorporation articles received on May 1, 1834. Among the 20 investors was Vivus W. Smith, who later was one of the founders of the Syracuse Journal. The Auburn & Syracuse Railroad was opened on January 8, 1838 with horse-drawn trains. On June 4, 1839, the first locomotive owned by the line, the \\"Syracuse,\\" traveled the wooden rails and pulled the first train by steam. By 1839, one of the trains achieved the run in 58 minutes. A year later, in 1840, the event was reported in the Western State Journal. Known as the Auburn road the company erected a new depot between Salina and Clinton streets in late 1838. The depot was replaced that next summer in 1839 when the depot of the Syracuse and Utica Railroad was ready for use. The depot of the Auburn road was not known for either beauty or finish, presenting a \\"striking contrast to its majestic neighbor across the street.\\" Only after the advent of the steam railroad did the train finally arrive in Syracuse. Originally, a mill pond on the site of the present State Armory in West Jefferson Street, blocked the right of way. It was not until a trestle was built across the pond, that passengers were no longer \\"forced to find other means of getting into the village of Syracuse from a temporary station at Geddes. Work on the trestle was completed in early 1839 as well as construction of a new railroad station. Vanderbilt Square in Syracuse, New York about 1920 =Vanderbilt square= Vanderbilt was the first railroad station in Syracuse, opening in early 1839 Railroads were such a dominant form of transportation in those days, the square was perpetually coated with soot from the locomotives running down tracks in the middle of the street. The new station had doors at either end which were closed after the arrival and departure of the trains. From 1839 on, Syracuse life for many years revolved around Vanderbilt Square, the magnet was the railroad station, and the hostelries that grew up around it. In the old station Henry Clay was welcomed on his visit to the New York State Fair in 1849. Daniel Webster, General Winfield Scott, Louis Kossuth, John Brown, Stephen A. Douglas, and other notables were greeted there. =Syracuse & Utica railroad= A second railroad was organized along a route from Syracuse to Utica. The route went through Oneida and Rome, a distance of . On July 1, 1837, the village of Syracuse gave consent to a right of way along Washington Street for the railroad. The station in Vanderbilt Square was used by this railroad as well as the Auburn & Syracuse Railroad. John Wilkinson, first postmaster of the village of Syracuse, who had given the village its name from the title of a poem, was president of the Syracuse & Utica Railroad. Vivus Smith served as the first secretary. As a result of their efforts, the railroad was headquartered in Syracuse instead of Utica, providing the village with an important industry. Daniel Elliott was the architect and builder of the Syracuse and Utica Railroad depot which was a \\"striking exhibition of architectural skill and beauty.\\" The depot was occasionally used for political or village meetings and public addresses. Noted characters were frequently received there including Martin Van Buren, Henry Clay and Gerrit Smith. At first, the building served its purpose very well, but soon became too cramped for convenience and the offices were \\"one by one removed to other quarters near by,\\" where they remained until a new depot was constructed on Franklin Street. Wilkinson, as president, ordered the construction of the first flat car for the line after passengers complained they needed a car in which they could carry purchases made in Syracuse back to Utica. This was the first \\"so- called\\" freight car in the nation, the forerunner of the modern freight business. The railroad celebrated its first public run on July 4, 1839. The company installed their tracks along Washington Street where the New York Central Railroad retained the right-of-way. =Syracuse & Utica Direct railroad= In 1852, a rival company to the Syracuse & Utica Railroad, called the Syracuse & Utica Direct Railroad, threatened to build a line from Syracuse to Utica by a more direct route, by way of Vernon, New York. This reduced the total travel time from four hours to three and one-half hours. It was at this time that the Syracuse & Utica Railroad decided to \\"double track its line through Washington Street.\\" =Syracuse Stone railroad= The Syracuse Stone Railroad Company connected the city with the Onondaga stone quarries. The small railroad connected the Auburn & Syracuse Railroad from Geddes into the city proper and the depot at Vanderbilt Square. =Railroad competition= the Oswego & Syracuse began business in 1848. =Syracuse & Binghamton railroad= The Syracuse & Binghamton Railroad, opened in 1854, a year after original New York Central Railroad consolidation. It linked to the earlier Syracuse & Oswego Railroad line shortly after both came under control of the Delaware, Lackawanna & Western Railroad in 1870. This was accomplished despite difficulties caused by the use of wide gauge rails by one railroad and standard gauge by the other. =Direct railway= The Direct Railway Company was incorporated in 1848 and was designed as a direct route between Syracuse and Rochester and reduced the total trip by as opposed to the Auburn & Rochester Railroad which was designed to provide local service to villages along the way, therefore a less direct route. =Rochester & Syracuse railroad= The Rochester & Syracuse Railroad Company was formed in 1853 and were granted authorization to construct a direct route line and acquire all rights of the Direct Railway Company. The railroad opened for business in June 1853, two months before the formation of the New York Central Railroad. =Salina street= Empire State Express about 1900 The first street railway was built in Salina street in 1859, exposing Syracuse to tourists. Travelers caught \\"intimate glimpses\\" of Syracuse, its people, stores and houses as the trains slowed on their way through town. On February 18, 1861, Abraham Lincoln, on the way to his inauguration, bowed from a coach platform and on April 26, 1865, his funeral train stopped for 30 minutes. The Oakwood and Geddes horse car lines were built in 1863. =New York central= New York Central Railroad ‚Äì 1908 The merger of seven railroads in Central New York was foreshadowed as early as 1842 when completion of a line between Buffalo and Attica made it possible to travel between Buffalo and Albany, with a change necessary only at Rochester. On January 31, 1843, the seven railroad companies operating along the route met in Albany and agreed to run two \\"through\\" trains daily between the Hudson River and Lake Erie terminals. The trip took 25 hours and cost $11.50 for first class. Average speed on the run was . Some consolidation of these roads had been effected by April 2, 1853 when the New York State Legislature passed an act authorizing the merger of any or all the ten railroads organized on routes between the Hudson River region and the Great Lakes. By July 7, 1853, an agreement had been reached by the \\"ready\\" railroad directors. This was the beginning of the growth of the New York Central Railroad which eventually spread westward from Buffalo and moved to New York City by the Hudson River Line. The old New York Central Railroad station was demolished on Sunday in February, 1870 and a new New York Central Railroad depot was built on Franklin and West Fayette streets at the edge of Armory Square which was in use until 1895 when a third station was constructed. The third depot was demolished in 1936. =Additional lines= During the 1870s, two new railroads were established including the Syracuse, Chenango & New York Railroad, through the Chenango Valley, and the Syracuse & Northern, to Watertown, New York. Both railroads later merged with the New York Central Railroad. =West Shore railroad= The West Shore Railroad opened a route to New York City in 1848. A \\"rate war\\" led to the demise of the road, which was leased to the New York Central Railroad. West Shore secured its franchise in Syracuse in 1881, and was opened on October 1, 1883 The Syracuse & Utica Railroad made its first arrival in 1889. The locomotive named Syracuse \\"drew the first train out of the old station on June 4, 1889, over the Auburn road.\\" References Category:Transportation in Syracuse, New York ","title":"Railroads in Syracuse, New York"},{"id":"30557885","text":"Feminism Unmodified: Discourses on Life and Law is a 1987 book by feminist legal scholar Catharine MacKinnon.

The Love-Sick King Brewer wrote The Love-sick King, an English Tragical History, with the Life and Death of Cartesmunda, the Fair Nun of Winchester, by Anth. Brewer (1655) It was revived at the King's Theatre in 1680, and reprinted in that year under the title of The Perjured Nun. William Rufus Chetwood included the Love-sick King in his Select Collection of Old Plays, published at Dublin in 1750, but made no attempt to correct the text of the carelessly printed old edition. The play was written in verse, but it is printed almost throughout as prose. Attribution of other works After all allowance has been made for textual corruptions, it cannot be said that the Love-sick King is a work of much ability; and it is rash to follow Kirkman, Baker, and Halliwell in identifying Antony Brewer with the \\"T. B.\\" whose name is on the title-page of the Country Girl (1647), a well-written comedy, which in parts (notably in the third act) closely recalls the diction and versification of Massinger. There is no known dramatist of the time to whom the initials T. B. could belong. There was a versatile writer named Thomas Brewer, and the title-pages to his tracts are usually signed with his initials, not with the full name. His claim to the Country Girl would be quite as reasonable as Antony [Tony] Brewer's. In 1677 John Leanerd, whom Langbaine calls \\"a confident plagiarist\\"', reprinted the Country Girl, with a few slight alterations, as his own, under the title of Country Innocence Another play formerly ascribed to Brewer was Lingua, or the Combat of the Five Senses for Superiority (1607), a well-known dramatic piece (included in the various editions of Dodsley), constructed partly in the style of a morality and partly of a masque. The mistake arose thus: Kirkman, the bookseller and publisher, in printing his catalogues of plays, left blanks where the names of the writers were unknown to him. Annexed to the 'Love-sick King' was the name Antony Brewer ; then came the plays Landgartha, Love's Loadstone, Lingua and Love's Dominion Phillips, who was followed by Winstanley, misunderstanding the use of Kirkman's blanks, promptly assigned all these pieces to Brewer. One other play, The Merry Devil of Edmonton (1608) has been with similar carelessness pronounced to be Antony Brewer's on the strength of an entry in the Stationers' Registry which refers to the prose tract of Thomas Brewer's Merry Devil.

It operated independently between its inception in 1911 until acquisition by Lawn-Boy in 1988. The company was probably most well known for its garden tillers, snowblowers and garden tractors produced from the 1960s through the 1980s. History John P. Gilson and his brother Michael Gilson were descendants of Theodore Gilson, who had emigrated to the United States from Colmar-Berg, Luxembourg and, in 1850, started what eventually became the Gilson Manufacturing Company. Brothers John and Michael, having both worked for that company, started the Gilson Brothers Company in 1911. At that time, the Gilson Brothers' main products were limestone grinders, feed cutters, and concrete mixers. In 1988, Gilson Brothers Co. was acquired by Lawn-Boy, which was itself acquired by the Toro company in the following year. It was at this point that production of Gilson- branded lawn and snow equipment ceased. The Gilson line of concrete mixers was sold to the Cleform company of Missouri, which was acquired in 2010 by the Marshalltown Company of Marshalltown, Iowa. As of January 2011, that company still sells concrete mixers under the Gilson name. Products right Gilson Brothers Co. has produced a wide range of products, including: *Crushers *Rotary tillers *Feed cutters *Concrete mixers *Minibikes *Snowmobiles *Barbecue grills *Snowblowers and snowthrowers *Lawn and garden tractors Those Gilson Brothers products that were sold under the Gilson brand were typically painted with the company's signature beige-and-crimson color scheme, starting in 1977 they used crimson-and-black. Gilson Brothers products were also re- branded and sold under the names Montgomery Ward, Lawn-Boy, Ford, Snow Charger, Wizard, Plymouth, Marshall Wells, and others. Most Gilson snowblowers were powered by Briggs and Stratton engines. =UniTrol= left UniTrol (or Uni-Trol) was a patented Gilson Brothers innovation in snowblower drive linkage that allows operation of the clutch and gearchange with a single lever. It was introduced in 1969 and was available on Gilson snowblowers until 1979. When a UniTrol snowblower is running, the engine is always turning a drive platter. The act of engaging a gear presses a rubber-edged wheel against the flat steel surface of the spinning platter, which transfers power through 90 degrees to the drive axle and at a ratio inversely proportional to the distance from the center of the platter at which the wheel is engaged. A neutral \\"gear\\" is available by simply lifting the wheel from the surface of the platter, and a reverse gear is available by engaging the wheel at a symmetric point across the center of the platter. The style of baffle used in the single-speed UniTrol snowblowers was also patented for its unique design. =Snow Cannon= The \\"Snow Cannon\\" was the Gilson line of compact snow throwers, for which a patent was granted in 1980. These machines were powered by two-stroke engines (manufactured either by Briggs & Stratton, Tecumseh or OMC (Outboard Marine Corp).

Leonte Filipescu was born in a family of workers in B√¢rlad, Romania. He worked from an early age, first as a dock labourer in the port of Gala≈£i, and after 1910 as a waiter in Bucharest, Romania's capital. In Bucharest he met several trade unionist active in the waiter's guild, such as Gheorghe Niculescu-Mizil, Iancu Olteanu and Marian Cristescu, who introduced him to socialist ideas. He took part in several waiters' protest, and, after the start of World War I, in the anti-war demonstrations organised in Bucharest by the Socialists. In the meantime, he also joined the Social Democratic Party, sitting on its far left wing. As Romania joined the war on the side of the Entente in 1916, Leonte Filipescu was drafted and sent to the front, but was soon captured by the German Army and interned in a concentration camp. He succeeded in escaping along with several prisoners, and by the spring of 1917 he was back in Bucharest, taking part in the demonstration organised by the Socialists in front of the German Army Headquarters in occupied Romania. In 1918 he was one of the editors of the socialist manifest TrƒÉiascƒÉ Socialismul (\\"Long live the Socialism\\"), and advocated its distribution by bypassing the military censorship. In the first post-war years Leonte Filipescu became one of the leaders of the left-wing grouping of the Socialist Party of Romania, and participated in the organisation of several strikes and mass demonstrations in Bucharest. In July 1919 he began contributing to the left-wing journal Federa≈£ia, advocating communist revolution and the transformation of the Romanian society into a socialist society. Following the authorities crackdown on the 1920 Romanian general strike, which he helped organise, he went into hiding, while continuing to spread pro-socialist manifestos and pamphlets. During the January‚ÄìFebruary 1921 conference of the General Council of the Socialist Party and Trade Unions, Leonte Filipescu was one of the advocates of the party's affiliation with the Third International, and its transformation into a communist party. The same year he went to Ia≈üi, in eastern Romania, where he organised, along with Pavel Tcacenco, the Socialist Conference of March 3‚Äì6. During the talks, he reiterated his support for the transformation of the Socialist Party into a communist one. Narrowly escaping capture during the crackdown on the Conference, he left for Bulgaria, missing the May Congress of the Socialist Party which saw its transformation into the Communist Party of Romania. Returning in Romania at the end of July 1921, he found most of the leadership of the Communist Party in prison, so he took part in the organisation of a provisional leadership, assuming the control of the party's youth wing. He worked in gathering support for the communist imprisoned at Jilava, VƒÉcƒÉre≈üti and Doftana among the workers in Bucharest's factories. In October 1921 he was captured by the secret police, and became one of the main defendants in the Dealul Spirii Trial. While in prison, he contracted a severe form of tuberculosis. Due to his health problems, he was granted severance, and was moved to a military prison in Bucharest. In April 1922 he was summoned to appear as a witness in the main trial, and the authorities decided to have him transferred to Jilava, despite Leonte's opposition. On the night of April 13/14, during the transport, he was shot in the head and in the heart, ostensibly because he was attempting to escape. His assassination provoked outrage among the Romanian working class and in the press. References * Felea, Ion (1970). \\"Leonte Filipescu\\" in Anale de Istorie, Vol. XVI, Nr. 2.

Life Burton was born in 1793 at Rhodes Hall, Middleton, Lancashire, the seat of his father Daniel Burton, a cotton manufacturer, of whom he was the youngest son. He was educated at the University of Glasgow and St John's College, Cambridge, where he graduated LL.B. in 1822. In 1829 he was incorporated B.C.L. at Magdalen College, Oxford, on 14 October, and received the degree of D.C.L. on the following day. His family were Wesleyans, and he was for a time a Methodist minister, but was ordained in the Church of England in 1816. The church of All Saints, Manchester was built by him at a cost of ¬£18,000 and consecrated in 1820, when he became rector, after serving for a short time as curate of St James's in the same town. Most of the church was destroyed by fire on 6 February 1850. Burton was a botanist, and his discovery in Anglesey of a plant new to science led to his election as Fellow of the Linnean Society. While on a visit at Western Lodge, Durham, he was attacked by typhus fever, and died after three weeks' illness on 6 September 1866.

Life The son of Edward Bury, he was born at Great Bolas, Shropshire, where he was baptised on 21 April 1663. He was educated at Thomas Doolittle's academy, at that time in Islington. Here he was contemporary with Matthew Henry, who entered in 1680, and made friends with Bury. Edmund Calamy, who entered in 1682, speaks of Bury as a student of philosophy, not divinity. Bury's first settlement was at Bury St Edmunds, before the Toleration Act of 1689. In 1690 a house in Churchgate Street was bought, and converted into a place of worship, with a substantial congregation. In Samuel Tymms's Handbook of Bury St. Edmunds it is stated that Daniel Defoe was an attendant on his ministry. In 1696, Bury was engaged in collecting a list of the nonconforming ministers; Oliver Heywood supplied him (14 August) with the names in Yorkshire and Lancashire, through Samuel Angier. On 11 August 1700, John Fairfax, ejected from Barking-cum- Needham, Suffolk, died (aged seventy-six) at his house in that parish; Bury preached two funeral sermons for him; the one at the actual funeral at Barking was, by an unusual concession, delivered in the parish church. A chapel in Churchgate Street was built in 1711, and opened 30 December. Bury preached the opening sermon. Bury, who suffered with the stone, went with his wife to Bath in the autumn of 1719, on a journey of health. Just before he set out on his return home, he received overtures from Lewin's Mead, Bristol. This was the larger of the two presbyterian congregations in Bristol, and it had been vacant since the death of Michael Pope in 1718. It counted 1,600 adherents. Bury agreed to go to Bristol for six months \\"to make a tryal of the waters there\\". He arrived there on 8 April 1720. In little more than a month he lost his wife. His stay at Bristol was permanent; he had as assistant (probably from 1721) John Diaper, who succeeded him as pastor, and resigned in 1751. Under Bury's ministry the congregation increased both in numbers and in wealth. In the Hewley suit, 1830‚Äì42, efforts were made by the Unitarian defendants to collect indications of concession to heterodox opinion on the part of Bury, as a representative Presbyterian of his time. Thomas Smith James's History of the Litigation and Legislation respecting Presbyterian chapels claimed that the 'Exhortation' at Savage's ordination, quoted to prove opposition to the Calvinistic Doctrine of Election, was not by Bury, but by John Rastrick, M.A., of Lynn (died 18 August 1727). In a farewell letter from Bury to his Lewin's Mead congregation, he says, 'I never was prostituted to any party, but have endeavoured to serve God as a catholic Christian,‚Äô and speaks of requirements which have no good Scripture warrant, as making 'apocryphal sins and duties.' The address is practical, avoids controversy, and is evangelical in tone. Bury died 10 March 1730, and was buried in St. James's churchyard, where there had been an altar tomb with Latin epitaphs to Bury and his wife. He married, on 29 May 1697, Elizabeth Bury, second daughter of Captain Adams Lawrence, of Linton, Cambridgeshire. Works Bury published: * A Scriptural Catechism, being an Abridgment of Mr. O.

At least six officers of the name appear to be distinguishable in the imperial service during the Thirty Years' War. The James Butler in question is said to have belonged to the branch of his house which traced its origin to Richard Butler, 1st Viscount Mountgarret, the second son of Piers Butler, 8th Earl of Ormond. Career =Imperial service= He is first met with in Poland, where he levied at his own expense a regiment of not less than fifteen companies (ten being the usual number in the Imperial Army). Very possibly, since Gustavus Adolphus is said to have cherished a deadly hatred against him, he was the Butler who, after having in 1627 shared in a defeat of the Poles near Danzig, in the following year contributed to the Polish success against the Swedes at Osterode. It was certainly he who, early in 1631, opportunely brought up his regiment, which had large number of Irishmen, including his kinsman Walter Butler, to Frankfort-on-the-Oder, in Silesia, where the imperialists under Tiefenbach were awaiting the approach of Gustavus Adolphus at the head of a much superior force. Before the arrival of the Swedes, James Butler, in order if possible to obtain more soldiers and supplies for Frankfort, proceeded to the camp of Tilly, who was marching upon Magdeburg. Butler came too late, but he appears to have taken part in the Sack of Magdeburg, the result of which terribly avenged the fall of Frankfort. After the capture of Magdeburg and before the Battle of Breitenfeld he appears to have rejoined Tiefenbach, who had invaded Lusatia with such forces as he could command, but whom the news of the great defeat of Tilly obliged to retreat into Bohemia, where he occupied Nimburg on the Elbe, November 1631. A Saxon army under Arnim having taken position on the other side of the river, Butler was with his Irish regiment, as it is now called, sent across a wooden bridge to fortify and hold the bridgehead on the enemy's side; and his defense, ending with the burning down of the bridge, was so vigorous that finally Arnim returned to Prague. =Mercenary= Not long afterwards, however, the Irish colonel, who had many adversaries or rivals, quit the imperial service, and, making use of the liberty which he had reserved to himself, returned into Poland, where he fought against the Muscovites in the Smolensk War. He was at least in so far consistent in his choice of side, that he served against an enemy who on principle excluded mercenaries professing the faith of Rome (Herrmann, Geschichte des Russischen Reiches, iii. 54). After this nothing certain is known of him, for there seems no reason for accepting a conjecture which identifies him with a Butler said to have fallen at Ross in March 1642, fighting in the Irish Confederate Wars on the side of the Irish Catholics under General Preston against the royal troops under the head of his house James Butler, earl (afterwards marquis and twelfth duke) of Ormonde.

Early life and education  Campbell was born in 1764 at Tombea, Loch Lubnaig, and first educated at the grammar school, Callander, was the second son of a carpenter who, falling into straitened circumstances, removed to Edinburgh, where he died when Alexander was eleven years old. The family was supported by John, the eldest son, afterwards a well-known Edinburgh character (John Campbell died 1795, was precentor at the Canongate church, and a friend of Burns; his picture appears thrice in Kay's 'Portraits'). The two brothers were pupils of Tenducci, then a music teacher in Edinburgh, who helped to establish them both in his own profession. Campbell was appointed organist to an 'episcopalian chapel in the neighbourhood of Nicholson Street.' He also gave lessons in singing. Among his pupils were the Scotts. But the lads had no taste for the subject; the master had no patience. The result was that 'our neighbour, Lady Cunningham, sent to beg the boys might not all be flogged precisely at the same hour, as, though she had no doubt the punishment was deserved, the noise of the concord was really dreadful' (Notes to Scott's Autobiography, in chap. i. of LOCKHART'S Life). While a teacher he published 'Twelve Songs set to Music' (1785?) About the time he became engaged in quarrel with Kay, whom he ridiculed in a sketch. This procured him a place in Kay's 'Portraits,' where he is represented turning a hand organ while asses bray, a dog howls, a bagpipe is blown, and a saw sharpened as an accompaniment (vol. ii. print 204).  Adult life  Campbell married twice at a comparatively early age. His second wife was the widow of Ranald Macdonald of Keppoch. Thinking that the connection thus formed might be useful in procuring an appointment, he resigned his music teaching and studied medicine at the university of Edinburgh. Though in 1798 he announced 'A Free and Impartial Inquiry into the Present State of Medical Knowledge' (a work apparently never published), he does not seem to have practised his new profession, but to have devoted himself to literary work. At this period he wrote 'Odes and Miscellaneous Poems, by a student of medicine at the university of Edinburgh' (Edinburgh, 1796), and also published some drawings of highland scenery made on the spot. Campbell's next work was 'An Introduction to the History of Poetry in Scotland' (Edinburgh, 1798). This contains a collection of Scotch songs; it was illustrated by David Allen, and dedicated to H. Fuseli. It is written in a curiously stilted style but contains much information about contemporary poets and poetasters. Though only ninety copies were printed, it excited some notice. L. T. Rosegarten supplements his translation (L√ºbeck and Leipzig, 1802) of T. Garnett's 'Tour in the Highlands,' 1800, with information drawn from it. Rosegarten specially commends the views therein expressed about Ossian, the authenticity of whose poem Campbell stoutly maintained. Pass of Killiecrankie, from \\"A Journey from Edinburgh Through Parts of North Britain\\" Campbell now produced 'A Journey from Edinburgh through parts of North Britain [1802, new edition 1811], with drawings made on the spot' by the writer. This is an interesting and even valuable picture of the state of many parts of the country at the beginning of the century. Francis Jukes worked throughout 1802 on publishing for him \\"A Journey from Edinburgh to Parts of North Britain\\" aka \\"A Journey to Scotland\\". Campbell's \\"A Journey to Scotland\\" It was followed by 'The Grampians Desolate, a poem in six books' (Edinburgh, 1804). More than half of this work, which is without literary merit, consists of notes. Its object was to call attention to the 'deplorable condition' of the highlands, brought about by the introduction of sheep-farming. A melancholy incident recorded in a note to page 11 led to the establishment of the Edinburgh Destitute Sick Society. After some interval there appeared 'Albyn's Anthology, or a select collection of the melodies and vocal poetry of Scotland, peculiar to Scotland and the Isles, hitherto unpublished' (2 vols. Edinburgh, 1816 and 1818). Campbell had projected this work since 1790, but it was not till Henry Mackenzie, Walter Scott (who obtained the prince regent's acceptance of the dedication of the book), and other Edinburgh men of note, gave him their help that the project was carried out. A grant was obtained from the Highland Society, and the author travelled between eleven and twelve hundred miles in collecting materials (preface). Among the contributors of verse are Scott, Hogg, Jamieson, and Alexander Boswell. In the 'Anthology' (p. 66) Campbell claims the authorship of the well-known air usually joined to Tannahill's 'Gloomy Winter's nou awa';‚Äô but the claim has been disputed (ANDERSON, Scottish Nation).  Later life  In the last years of his life Campbell fell into great poverty, and obtained his living chiefly by copying manuscripts for his old pupil Scott, though 'even from his patron he would take no more than he thought his services as a transcriber fairly earned.' Scott, however, tells a half-pitiful story of a dinner which Archibald Constable gave to 'his own circle of literary serfs,' when 'poor Allister Campbell and another drudge of the same class' ran a race for a new pair of breeches, which were there displayed 'before the threadbare rivals.' Scott thought the picture might be highly coloured, and at any rate Constable bestowed on him 'many substantial benefits,' as he gratefully acknowledges in a letter written the year before his death, which took place from an attack of apoplexy 15 May 1824. His manuscripts were sold 'under judicial authority.' Among them was a tragedy, which was never published. Campbell was a warm-hearted and accomplished, though somewhat unpractical, man. Scott, who wrote an obituary notice of him in the 'Edinburgh Weekly Journal,' says that, though his acquirements were considerable, 'they did not reach that point of perfection which the public demand of those who expect to derive bread from the practice of the fine arts.'

From Douglas Point immediately east of Hastings, Minnesota, the route connected Stillwater, Taylors Falls, Sunrise, Chengwatana, Fortuna, Scotts Corner, to Thomson and Superior. Several discontinuous sections of this road are still in use.  History  In 1852* the federal government began building the Point Douglas to Superior Military Road. Although intended as a highway for troop movement, this route from Hastings, Minnesota on the Mississippi River to Superior, Wisconsin on Lake Superior, was one of the first roads in Minnesota Territory and attracted a flood of civilian and commercial traffic. When Minnesota achieved statehood in 1858, responsibility for the road devolved to the state, which did not have the funds to finish the project. Although very rough and in places incomplete, the road was still the best route north until railroads were built in 1870. An alternative to the Military Road that ushered in the decline in use of the road came in 1895 when William Henry Grant built a spur of the Lake Superior and Mississippi Railroad to run to Sandstone, Minnesota. Traces of the unimproved military road can still be seen in Wild River State Park and Banning State Park. *See Singley, Grover, \\"Retracing the Military Road from Point Douglas to Superior\\", MHS Spring 1967  Landmarks  The Point Douglas‚ÄìSt. Louis River Road Bridge in Stillwater Township, Minnesota * Point Douglas to Superior Military Road: Deer Creek Section, Wild River State Park * Point Douglas‚ÄìSt. Louis River Road Bridge, Stillwater, Minnesota  Existing sections  * St. Croix Trail / County Road 21, Washington County, Minnesota * St. Croix Trail / Minnesota Highway 95, Washington and Chisago Counties, Minnesota * Lake Boulevard / U.S. Highway 8 / Minnesota Highway 95, Taylors Falls, Minnesota * Wild Mountain Road / County Road 16, Shafer and Amador Townships, Chisago County, Minnesota * Deer Creek Loop, Wild River State Park, Minnesota * River Road, Amador and Sunrise Townships, Chisago County, Minnesota * Sunrise Road / County Road 9, Sunrise Township, Chisago County, Minnesota * Government Road / County Road 57, Sunrise and Rushseba Townships, Chisago County, Minnesota * Government Road / County Road 55, Rushseba Township, Chisago County, Minnesota * Government Road / County Road 106, Rock Creek, Pine County, Minnesota * Government Road / County Highway 4, Rock Creek and Pine City Township, Pine County, Minnesota * Government Road, Pine City Township, Pine County, Minnesota * Cross Lake Road / County Highway 9, Pine County, Minnesota * Hinckley Road / County Highway 15, Mission Creek, Munch and Barry Townships, Pine County, Minnesota * Government Road / County Road 140, Barry Township, Pine County, Minnesota * Government Road, Barry and Sandstone Townships, Pine County, Minnesota * Old Military Road, Sandstone, Minnesota * Wolf Creek Trail, Banning State Park, Minnesota * Interstate Highway 35, Finlayson Township, Pine County, Minnesota * Old Military Road, Norman Township, Pine County, Minnesota * Military Road, Norman and Windemere Townships, Pine County, Minnesota * Military Road / County Highway 50, Pine County, Minnesota * Military Road, Windemere Township, Pine County, Minnesota * Military Road / County Road 13, Carlton County, Minnesota * Military Road / Township Road 389, Carlton County, Minnesota ; Original routing * County Road 4, Carlton County, Minnesota * County Road 1, Carlton County, Minnesota ; Extended routing * County Road 4, Carlton County, Minnesota * County Road W, Douglas County, Wisconsin * 31st Avenue East, Superior, Wisconsin  Further reading  * Payte, William.

Nearby localities include al-Bayda and Masyaf to the north, al-Bayyadiyah to the northeast, Nisaf to the east, Kafr Kamrah to the southeast, Mashta al-Helu to the southwest, Ayn al-Shams to the west and Wadi al-Oyun to the northwest. According to the Syria Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS), Ayn Halaqim had a population of 1,126 in the 2004 census.General Census of Population and Housing 2004. Syria Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS). Hama Governorate. Its inhabitants are predominantly Alawites. Name The name Ayn-Halaqim is composed of two Arabic words: \\"Ayn\\", which means spring of water and \\"Halaqim\\", the plural of \\"Houlkoum\\" meaning a tube or a pipe. Put together, the two words become \\"the spring of water with pipes\\". The village indeed has many water springs, the most important one is located in the heart of the village next to the new church and called the \\"big spring\\". Traces of pipes installed on this spring have been discovered, and it is thought that those pipes were supplying an old kingdom located on the opposite side of the mountain; this might be the reason behind the village name \\"the water spring with pipes. Another important water springs are spread inside and around the village, we can mention the one located next to the new elementary school in the eastern part of the village al-Hara al-Sharqiyah and in spite of its name the \\"small spring\\", it has a higher debit than the former one, another spring which is the most important one is located on a hill to the north of the village, and this one provides the village with its needs of water supply. Another significant spring located on the western extremity of the village and called the \\"coffee spring\\" or \\"nabe3 el kahwe\\", its name came from the fact that a coffee-restaurant was built around it and started receiving clients since early 60s, thus the coffee gave its name to the spring and vice versa. Climate Its considerable altitude (750-900 Meters) and special location give the village a cool and dry climate in the summer, making it one of the most important resorts in the country, especially for those who have high blood pressure or heart problems. The special geographic position of Ayn Halaqim is mostly due to the forests and the small mountain al-Nasoub, surrounding it from the west, while a long mountain Jabal al-Helou, faces it from the east. With an annual precipitation of about 900 mm, this position allowed the village to rank as one of the most rainy areas in Syria. . An important river al-Sarout, runs along the valley between the village and Jabal al-Helou, irrigating the fields and the big variety of fruit farms producing a considerable amounts of fruits like apple, apricot, prune, pear, grapes and olive.

We believe they'll be curious to see a re-creation of what they loved 15 and 20 years ago.\\" Lewis Stone, who had played the beloved Judge Hardy in the earlier films, had died in 1953, and his character's passing was noted in the film. Fay Holden, Sara Haden, and Cecilia Parker all reprised their roles. (The latter had been mostly retired since the series ended, devoting herself to raising her children). Mickey Rooney tried to persuade Ann Rutherford to return as Polly Benedict, Andy's on-and-off sweetheart in most of the original movies, so the two characters could be a married couple, but Rutherford's salary demands were too high, and the character was written out.Article on film at Turner Classic Movies accessed 11 Jan 2014 Andy's wife in the film, Jane (played by Patricia Breslin), had no prior connection to the town of Carvel. In line with MGM's practice of introducing studio contract players in the series, contractee Pat Cawley was given a role. The role of Andy Hardy Jr. was played by Rooney's real-life son, Teddy. Filming started on 7 May 1958. Reception According to MGM records, the movie earned $400,000 in the US and Canada and $210,000 elsewhere, making a loss to the studio of $5,000. Before the film was released, Hutshing and Donley worked on a sequel about Andy Hardy as a judge called Andy Hardy Carries On. There was also some talk of an Andy Hardy TV series. In the early 1960s, a pilot was shot for a prospective Andy Hardy sitcom for NBC, with a totally different cast and with the character of Judge Hardy returning, but NBC did not pick it up as a series.

It was built on an island on the River Derwent in Derby. It was built after John Lombe visited Piedmont in 1717 and returned to England with details of the Italian silk throwing machines ‚Äì the filatoio and the torcitoio ‚Äì and some Italian craftsmen. The architect was George Sorocold. At its height, the mill employed some 300 people.  Location  Lombe's Mill was built next to Thomas Cotchett's 1704 mill on the west bank of the River Derwent in Derby. At this point a weir had been constructed across the river, and the mill was built on an island downstream which separated the river from the tail race of three corn mills. The tail race was also called a fleam or a leat. Derby was a key location as the river had a fast flow, and it was here that it was crossed by the London to Carlisle road  History  Lombe's Mill was the first successful silk throwing mill in England and probably the first fully mechanised factory in the world. Thomas Cotchett's mill, built in Derby in 1704, was a failure. John Lombe had visited the successful silk throwing mill in Piedmont in 1716, an early example of industrial espionage. He returned to Derby with the necessary knowledge and a group of Italians. He designed the mill, and with his half-brother Thomas Lombe (born 1685) instructed George Sorocold to build it and fit it with the new machines. Between 1717 and 1721 George built the mill, beside the River Derwent to the south of Cotchett's Mill to house machines for \\"doubling\\" or twisting silk into thread. John Lombe's idea of mill was inspired by contemporary smaller and less effective mills he studied during the period in which he worked in Italy: traditionally the spinning wheel was used for producing small quantities of silk thread at the homes of local spinsters, the new machines were capable of producing far greater quantities of silk and provided serious competition for the Italians. The machines required large buildings and a power source. An undershot water wheel turned by the mill fleam on the west side of the new mill drove the spinning machines. Thomas Lombe was given a 14-year patent to protect the design of the throwing machines. The King of Sardinia reacted badly to the commercial challenge, placing an embargo on the export of raw silk. It is speculated that he was responsible for John Lombe's mysterious death, six years later, in 1722, perhaps poisoned by an Italian assassin paid by his Italian commercial opponents. John's elder brother, Sir Thomas Lombe, took over the business. Thomas died on 2 June 1739, leaving his estate to his widow and their two daughters. When the patents lapsed in 1732, other mills were built in Stockport and Macclesfield. An unpowered doubling shop was built to the north of the powered Italian works some time before 1739. The mill was sold to Thomas Wilson in 1739. An inventory was taken of the doubling shop, which still exists. Dame Elizabeth advertised the lease for sale in 1739, and the remaining 64 years of the lease were assigned to Richard Wilson junior of Leeds for ¬£2,800. Wilson remained in Leeds leaving the running of the mill to his partners, William and Samuel Lloyd, both London merchants, with Thomas Bennet as manager, taking a proportion of the profits. =Italian works = A description of the mill, dating from between 1739 and 1753, says: \\"The original Italian works of five storeys high housed 26 Italian winding engines that spun the raw silk on each of the upper three floors whilst the lower two storeys contained eight spinning mills producing basic thread and four twist mills.\\"Bygones: From Industrial Revolution to prized museum Little of the original mill remains. It was built of brick, in flemish bond, and was 33.5m long and 12m wide. It was built on a series of stone arches that allowed the waters of the River Derwent to flow through. The mill was 17m high, topped by a shallow pitched roof. The throwing machines were two storeys high and pierced the first floor. The winding machines were situated on the top three floors. All the machines were powered by Sorocold's 7 metres diameter, 2-metre wide external undershot waterwheel. Its axle entered the mill through a navel hole at first floor level. It drove a 0.45-metre square vertical shaft that drove a line shaft that ran the length of the mill. The torcitoios and filatoios took their power from the shaft. The vertical shaft was extended beyond the second floor by an iron gudgeon to another vertical shaft that reached the top 3 floors to drive the winding machines. The mill was heated to process the silk, and this was explained in the 1718 patent. It was reported that Lombe used a fire engine (steam engine) to pump hot air round the mill in 1732. The stair column was 19.5m high. Its layout is not known, and there is no information on how bales were hoisted between the floors. The circular spinning machines (also known as 'throwing machines'), were the most significant innovation of the factory. Together with the single source of power (water), and the large size and organisation of the workforce for the period (200-400, according to contemporary sources), the total process of production from raw silk to fine quality thread has led the Lombes' silk mill to be described as the first successful use of the factory system in Britain.Lombe's Mill: An Exercise in Reconstruction, Industrial Archaeology Review, Anthony Calladine (1993) The museum entrance and tower from Cathedral Green William Hutton was an employee and he later recalled the long hours, low wages and beatings. Work only stopped in time of drought, extreme frost or problems with the silk supply, although unofficial holidays were taken during elections and Derby races in August 1748. The partnership of Wilson and Lloyd ended in 1753 after acrimony and legal suits. Lloyd remained in possession of the building and machinery. In 1765 Thomas Bennet bought the premises from Lloyd subject to a mortgage to the Wilson family but neglected the building during years of trade recession and competition from other mills in Derby and Cheshire. Lamech Swift became the sub-tenant in 1780 paying an annual rent of ¬£7 to the corporation and ¬£170 to Thomas Wilson, brother of Richard and William. Despite a row with the corporation over repairs to the weirs in 1781, he remained in occupation until the lease expired in 1803 when the corporation advertised a lease to run for 60 years. The advertisement reveals that the \\"Italian works\\" was still used for throwing silk. =Historic tourism= The Silk Mill was a tourist attraction in Derby and was visited by Boswell in September 1777. Not all the visitors were impressed by conditions. Torrington commented on the \\"heat, stinks and noise\\", whilst Fairholt in 1835 was appalled by the sickly appearance of the poor children. Foreign visitors also included the mill in their itinerary. =19th century= November 1833 saw the beginning of industrial unrest in Derby which led to the formation of the Grand National Trades Union in February 1834. It predated the Tolpuddle Martyrs by several months. Taylor‚Äôs Silk Mill was not at the centre of the controversy although he was one of the employers who agreed not to employ any worker who was a union member. By the middle of April 1834 Taylor reported that two-thirds of his machinery was working and many of his former workers were applying for reinstatement. According to \\"The Derby Mercury\\" some of the former unionists were never able to find fresh employment in Derby. This event is commemorated by a march organised by the Derby Trades Union Council annually on the weekend before MayDay. The story of the Derby Lock-out was dramatised as a short film sponsored by Unite the union in 2015. This was first screened at Derby Quad cinema on 25 April 2015 Derby Silk Mill, probably in the early 1900s, before the 1910 fire. The Taylor family remained in occupation of the mill until 1865 when bankruptcy forced them to sell the machinery and lease. \\"The Derby Mercury\\" advertised several silk mills for sale that year when a general slump hit the industry. This took place four years before the Cobden Treaty with France which is said to have effectively destroyed the British silk industry. =20th century= Watercolour by Alfred John Keene of the 1910 fire. The connection with silk production ended in about 1908 when F.W. Hampshire and Company, the chemists, moved into the premises to make fly papers and cough medicines. On 5 December 1910 at 5.00 am, fire broke out in the adjacent Sowter Brothers flour mill and engulfed the Silk Mill. The mill's east wall fell into the river and the building was gutted. Great efforts were made by the borough fire brigade and the Midland Railway Company who saved the shell of the tower and the outline of the doorways leading into the original five floors. These can be seen today on the tower staircase. The building was rebuilt to the same height but with three storeys instead of five and remains that way today. During the 1920s, ownership passed to the Electricity Authority. It was used as stores, workshops and a canteen. Hidden from the road by the power station, its existence was forgotten by the public until the power station was demolished in 1970. It was then adapted for use as Derby‚Äôs Industrial Museum, which opened on 29 November 1974. Doubling shop  The main range was three storeys high, 42.4m by 5.5m. Each floor was used for doubling, and there were 306 doubling machines. The silk throwing process Silk is a naturally produced fibre obtained from many species of the silk moth. In 1700 the favoured silk was produced by a moth (Bombyx mori), that spun a cocoon to protect the larvae. The larvae fed on mulberry leaves grown in Italy. Silk fibres from the Bombyx mori silkworm have a triangular cross section with rounded corners, 5‚Äì10 Œºm wide. The silk is a protein, fibroin, that was cemented in place by the use of gum, another protein, sericin. The cocoons were harvested and placed in troughs of hot water to dissolve the gum and allowed the single thread to be wound into a skein. The skeins were placed into bales and taken to the mill for processing. Three sorts of yarn could be produced: no-twist which was suitable for weft, tram that had received a slight twist making it easier to handle, and organizine which had a greater twist and was suitable for use as warp. Reeling is the industrial process where silk that has been wound into skeins, is cleaned, receives a twist and is wound onto bobbins. Silk throwing is the process where the thread from the bobbins is twisted again to form tram and or organzine. The yarn is twisted together into threads, in a process known as doubling. Colloquially silk throwing can be used to refer to the whole process: reeling, throwing and doubling. In 1700, Italians were the most technologically advanced throwsters in Europe and had developed two machines capable of winding the silk onto bobbins while putting a twist in the thread. They called the throwing machine, a filatoio, and the doubler, a torcitoio. There is an illustration of a circular handpowered throwing machine drawn in 1487 with 32 spindles. The first evidence of an externally powered filatoio comes from the thirteenth century, and the earliest illustration from around 1500. Filatorios and torcitoios contained parallel circular frames that revolved round each other on a central axis. The speed of the relative rotation determined the twist. Silk would only co-operate in the process if the temperature and humidity were high, in Italy the temperature was elevated by sunlight but in Derby the mill had to be heated, and the heat evenly distributed. Today The Derby Silk Mill built on the foundations of Lombe's Mill. The mill passed through several owners and has been rebuilt several times, but the modified structure is extant and has been restored to house the Derby Silk Mill. There is a Bas relief sculpture of John Lombe at the nearby Exeter Bridge.

He served as the pastor of the York Unitarian Chapel, located in York, England. Cappe published various sermons and after his death his second wife, Catharine Cappe published many more.  Life  He was born at Leeds, West Yorkshire, the eldest son of the Rev. Joseph Cappe, minister of the nonconformist congregation at Mill Hill Chapel, Leeds, who married the daughter and coheiress of Mr. Newcome of Waddington, Lincolnshire. He was educated for the dissenting ministry. For a year (1748‚Äì49) he was with John Aikin at Kibworth, Leicestershire; then for three years he studied with Philip Doddridge at Northampton, East Midlands, and for three more years (1752‚Äì55) he lived in Glasgow, as a student of William Leechman. Cappe was chosen in November 1755 as the co-pastor with the Rev. John Hotham of the chapel at St. Saviourgate, York. After Hotham's death the following May, Cappe became the sole pastor to the congregation and remained in this position until his death. In politics he was a reformer and supporter of the Yorkshire Association, and in theology, while brought up in the orthodox Independent tradition, he followed Joseph Priestley and was of Unitarian views. In 1783 he supported the Society for Promoting the Knowledge of the Scriptures. Low and High Ousegate, 1813 engraving of York The large house in Upper Ousegate in which he lived was described by Robert Davies, in his Walks through York, and in it he gathered together men of letters. A literary club which he founded in 1771 existed for nearly twenty years. In later life, Cappe was frequently ill, and in 1791 he suffered a paralytic stroke. It was followed by other attacks until his strength failed, and he died at York. Charles Wellbeloved had taken over his duties, as assistant, in 1792.  Works  The writings of Cappe which appeared during his lifetime were quite slight. When Theophilus Lindsey left the Church of England in 1773, he published a Farewel Address, which was attacked by William Cooper as \\"Erasmus\\" in a letter to Etherington's York Chronicle in January 1774. The first reply to Cooper in the Chronicle was from Cappe, as \\"A Lover of good men\\", even if Lindsey and Joseph Priestley took it to be from another ally, William Turner. In 1783, Cappe printed a pamphlet of Remarks in Vindication of Dr. Priestley in answer to attacks in The Monthly Review. During the period of the American Revolutionary War, there were sermons preached on the days \\"of national humiliation\\" in 1776, 1780, 1781, 1782 and 1784. They had a pro-American tone. An earlier sermon delivered 27 November 1757, after the victory of Frederick the Great at the battle of Rossbach on 5 November 1757, was an exercise in rhetoric, and passed through numerous editions. In 1770, Cappe published a sermon in memory of the Rev. Edward Sandercock, and in 1785, he published his sermons. A Selection of Psalms for Social Worship and An Alphabetical Explication of some Terms and Phrases in Scripture, the first an anonymous publication, and the second \\"by a warm well-wisher to the interests of genuine christianity\\", were printed at York in 1786, and are known to have been compiled by Cappe. The second of them was reissued in Boston, Massachusetts, in 1818. A more elaborate work, Discourses on the Providence and Government of God, was published by him in 1795; a second edition appeared in 1811, and a third in 1818. After Cappe's death, his widow Catharine collected and edited his discourses, consisting of: * Critical Remarks on many important Passages of Scripture, 1802, 2 vols. * Discourses chiefly on Devotional Subjects, 1805 * Connected History of the Life and Divine Mission of Jesus Christ, 1809 * Discourses chiefly on Practical Subjects 1815 To the first and second of these publications she prefixed her own memoirs of his life. The second contained an appendix of a sermon on his interment by William Wood, and a memoir from the Monthly Review February 1801, pp. 81‚Äì4, by Charles Wellbeloved. Family In October 1759, Cappe married Sarah, the eldest daughter of William Turner, a merchant of Hull, East Yorkshire. She died of consumption (tuberculosis) in the spring of 1773, leaving six children behind her. His second wife, a promoter of female education and of Unitarian principles, was Catharine Harrison, and they were married at Barwick-in-Elmet, Leeds, on 19 February 1788. She was the author of tracts on charity schools, and the benefactor of the poet Charlotte Richardson.For Newcome's widow, see Unitarianism, Philanthropy and Feminism in York, 1782-1821: The Career of Catherine Cappe by Helen Plant.

It also marked the first season in which the Championship was divided into two divisions, with the clubs in both divisions having intermediate status. Championship 1 served as the second tier of Northern Irish football, with Championship 2 as the third tier. In Championship 1, Loughgall were crowned champions on 8 May 2010 after a 2‚Äì0 win over Ards. However, they were denied promotion because they did not gain the required licence from the IFA. Therefore, runners-up Donegal Celtic entered into a two-leg play-off with the bottom club of the 2009‚Äì10 IFA Premiership, and achieved promotion with a 1‚Äì0 aggregate win. At the other end of the table, Coagh United and Armagh City finished in the bottom two, and were relegated to Championship 2 for next season. In Championship 2, Harland & Wolff Welders won the title by 7 points, achieving promotion to Championship 1. Also promoted were Dergview who finished as runners-up. There was no relegation from Championship 2 this season. Team changes from 2008‚Äì09 The 2008‚Äì09 Championship consisted of one division of 17 clubs. The bottom 3 clubs (Tobermore United, Killymoon Rangers and Dergview) were relegated to the newly introduced Championship 2 for this season. Championship 2 was set up to replace the IFA Interim Intermediate League, introduced as a temporary league for the 2008‚Äì09 season only, consisting of the former members of the IFA Intermediate League (dissolved in 2008) who did not meet the criteria for the new IFA Championship 2; it consisted of 12 clubs. Members of the Interim League had one year to make improvements in order to gain entry to Championship 2 for this season. 10 of the 12 clubs managed to meet the criteria, along with Sport & Leisure Swifts and Knockbreda who both achieved intermediate status, with only Brantwood and Oxford United Stars failing to do so. Harland & Wolff Welders were the champions. There was no promotion from the Interim League which meant that Championship 1 would be reduced to 14 clubs, with Championship 2 having 15. Portadown were promoted to the 2009‚Äì10 IFA Premiership as 2008‚Äì09 Championship winners. Bangor entered Championship 1 after they announced that due to financial problems, they would not be able to renew their domestic licence required to take part in the Premiership.

In Morocco, a version made with a thin, phyllo-like pastry crust is called bastila. Early versions of the traditional Canadian dish of tourti√®re, currently made with meats such as pork or beef, were probably made of pigeon, likely the now extinct passenger pigeon. Historical record An early recipe for pigeon pie was given in A Proper Newe Booke of Cokerye, published in London in 1575. James Hart, a Scottish physician, wrote in 1633 that pigeon pies were usually served with far too much pepper.Joan Thirsk, Food in Early Modern England (London, 2007), p. 321. The diary of Samuel Pepys recounts his attendance at a dinner party on May 24, 1667, in Islington, London, where the guests \\"dined upon nothing but pigeon-pyes\\". Records in the British National Archives show that pigeon pie was a menu item at Kew Palace during the reign of George III. In 1879, the British Medical Journal reported a group of sailors aboard the Troop ship were poisoned by a bad pigeon pie which spawned an Admiralty investigation. Before the late 19th century in the United States, pigeon pie was a common dish. Archival records show that pigeon pie was a traditional dish for the American holiday of Thanksgiving, though is currently uncommon at Thanksgiving meals. Similarly, during the earlier part of the 19th century pigeon pie was a common Christmas meal in Detroit, but later was replaced by other meats. The reviewers in The Pacific Northwest Quarterly of the 1976 The Homestead Cookbook edited by Victoria Paul, noted that without publications of cookbooks like it, the traditional dish of pigeon pie would become culturally extinct in the United States. In Spain, pigeon eating was a common practice as early as the 14th century under the 1379 Order of the Pigeon created by King Juan I of Castile. The order ate pigeon regularly at their order banquets. In 1611, a recipe book by the royal chef at the court of Philip III of Spain included recipes for pigeon pie. Similarly, a chef at a university residence hall in Spain included recipes for pigeon pies in his 1607 collection of recipes.

Life Carey was the posthumous son of Henry Carey, and was brought up in the trade of a printer.Biog. Dram. i.86 About 1763 he resolved to go upon the stage. Garrick, Mrs. Cibber, and others encouraged him in this course.Inoculator, preface, p.vii He played at Covent Garden, where he failed to make his way and retired. He then wrote The Inoculator, a comedy in three acts, and The Cottagers, an opera; neither these plays were staged, but they were published with some poems in 1766 by subscription. In 1768 Carey, under the pseudonym of \\"Paul Tell-Truth, esq.\\", published Liberty chastized; or Patriotism in Chains, a Tragi-comi-political Farce; and wrote The Nut-Brown Maid (published in his Analects 1770). In 1769 he published Shakespeare's Jubilee, a Masque; in 1770 The Old Women Weatherwise, an Interlude, presented at Drury Lane; The Magic Girdle, a Burletta, acted at the Marylebone Gardens; The Noble Pedlar, another burletta; and a collection of trifles called Analects in Verse and Prose, chiefly Dramatical, Satirical, and Pastoral. Carey arranged, apparently about this time, a series of public entertainments at Covent Garden, the Haymarket, the Great Room in Panton Street, and other places, giving imitations of Foote, Weston, Ann Catley, and other popular actors and vocalists; and in 1776 he published a Lecture on Mimicry with a portrait, followed in 1777 by A Rural Ramble, to which is annexed a Poetical Tagg, or Brighthelmstone Guide.Monthly Review, lviii. 84 In 1787 he published Poetical Efforts;ib. lxxviii. 244 and in 1792, \`The Dupes of Fancy, or Every Man his Hobby, a Farce, in Two Acts, performed at Pilgrim's benefit. Meanwhile he continued his entertainments at Bath, Buxton, and elsewhere. By 1797 it was rumoured that his father was the actual author of God save the King, and that he himself had received a pension of 200 pounds a year on that ground.his Balnea, pp. 109-23 Corey announced that he had not received a pension, though his father had written the song; and he applied fruitlessly for an interview with the king to urge his claims. In 1799 came out his Balnea, or History of all the Popular Watering-places of England, with another portrait, which reached a third edition in 1801. In 1800 he published One Thousand Eight Hundred, or I wish you a Happy New Year, a collection of about sixty of his songs, some sung by Incledon. In 1801 he published The Myrtle and Vine, or Complete Vocal Library, containing several Thousands of Songs with an Essay on Singing and Song-writing'advertisement on cover of 'Balnea,' 3rd ed. In the summer of 1807 he was in London giving a series of entertainments, but he died suddenly of paralysis, aged 64, and was buried at the cost of friends.Gent.Mag.vol.lxxvii.pt.ii.pp. 781-782 An edition of his Old Women Weatherwise, in the form of a penny or halfpenny chap-book, was printed at Hull, without a date, but believed to be as late as 1825.

While checking reports of cattle wandering around a local council estate in Todmorden, West Yorkshire, on 28 November 1980, Godfrey claims he saw a bright light hovering above the road ahead that he described as a rotating ‚Äòdiamond shaped‚Äô object, about 20ft high and 14ft wide. Godfrey states that he tried to radio for help but that the equipment wouldn‚Äôt work, when the object suddenly vanished and he found himself 30 yards away further down the road. According to Godfrey, he experienced missing time of approximately twenty-five minutes, a split boot, and an itchy, red mark on his foot. Godfrey says that via hypnotic regression arranged by solicitor Harry Harris, he recalled how a beam of light blinded him and made him pass out, before waking up inside a room being medically examined by small beings and a tall man with a beard. At the age of 70, however, Godfrey told the Examiner that the abduction part he told under hypnosis was probably a dream, adding: ‚ÄúI never said I was abducted by aliens.‚Äù  Beliefs  Six months earlier, on June 9, 1980, Godfrey investigated the death of Zigmund Adamski, who had been missing since June 6 when he set off to buy groceries and didn't return, and whose body was found on June 9, twenty miles way from his home at a coal yard in Todmorden on top of a 10ft high coal pile by coal yard worker Trevor Parker. Adamski was wearing a suit but his shirt was missing together with his watch and wallet. His clothes were ‚Äòimproperly‚Äô fastened and his hair had also been cropped short in a ‚Äòroughly cut‚Äô manner. Godfrey told reporters that he believed it possible that Adamski may have been abducted by aliens and placed on the coal pile ‚Äúby someone or something‚Äù, saying ‚ÄúI am open minded. I can‚Äôt rule it out.‚Äù. Other theories put forward have suggested that Adamski was killed by KGB, or that he had been struck by ball lightning, gotten dazed and confused and wandered off to the coal pile and died. Adamski's wife, Lottie, initially suspected that her husband had been kidnapped. According to sceptics, ‚Äúthis case is just another example of a story that sounds good at first, but that dissolves under direct scrutiny. As are so many stories of space alien abduction.‚Äù Godfrey has self-published Who or What Were They?, a book that includes his speculations regarding the Adamski case, abduction claims by Travis Walton, and his own UFO sighting.

J. Alan, was an English magician, intelligence officer, short story writer and radio broadcaster. At the beginning of World War II he worked in naval intelligence at Bletchley Park. Life and career Lambert, son of Thomas Harrison Lambert and his wife Kate, was born in Nottingham and went to Rugby School before training to be a surveyor. He then learned to be a magician and became a successful member of The Magic Circle, performing especially at society events. Lambert became a radio ham and at the start of World War I he volunteered to work at a coastguard station in Norfolk which was a centre for intercepting German radio transmissions. By November 1914 he was employed by the Admiralty at Naval Intelligence Room 40 although even until after his death official records said he had been working at the Foreign Office since 1909. , giving National Archive and Churchill Archive sources HW3/35, HW3/6, HW3/185, ADM223/769, Clarke Papers, Denniston Papers In 1919 the staff at Room 40 became part of the new Government Code and Cypher School and Lambert was still working there at the outbreak of World War II. He was one of the many people from GC&CS; transferred to Bletchley Park by which time he was an important official in naval military intelligence. At Bletchley Park he was in Hut 8 and he was known to R V Jones who said that \\"in contrast to his outrageously unconventional stories\\" that he led his life on \\"a monotonously regular timetable\\". Lambert married but had no children. He lived at Holland Park, London and had a second home at Potter Heigham for sailing his boat on the Norfolk Broads. He was an amateur radio operator using call sign G2ST and an authority on food and wine. Radio broadcaster Lambert contacted a member of the then British Broadcasting Company to suggest he might tell one of his own short stories on the radio. This was accepted and so, as A. J. Alan, he broadcast My Adventure in Jermyn Street, on 31 January 1924. Following his immediate success, he quickly became one of the most popular broadcasting personalities of the time. He went to considerable trouble over writing each story, taking a couple of months over each one, and only broadcasting about five times a year. He carefully constructed an apparently extemporary, conversational, style making his stories seem like anecdotes concerning strange events that had happened to him. The endings were whimsical and unexpected. Contrary to the common belief that his stories were told \\"off the cuff\\", Lambert took immense care over his broadcasts which were, of course, live. He used cards rather than papers to avoid rustling noises and kept a candle lit in case the lights failed. He always wore a dinner jacket and Stuart Hibberd described him as \\"a neat figure in perfectly cut evening dress, with eye glass and a slim black brief case\\". It was known that \\"A. J. Alan\\" was not his true name but only once, in 1933, was his identity guessed when an old school friend, by then living in Jamaica, recognised his voice. Many of his stories were subsequently printed in newspapers and magazines and were included in anthologies of short stories. Three collections of his stories have been published. From 1937 his health was not good so he reduced his radio work and made his last broadcast on 21 March 1940. Publications =Books and stories= *Good Evening, Everyone!, Hutchinson (1928). *A.J.

It is the largest city park in New York outside of Manhattan, and is located along Hyde Park Boulevard (NY 61). Park facilities The park contains a golf course, bocce, lawn bowling, tennis and baseball. The largest structure in the park is Sal Maglie Stadium, named for Niagara Falls native and professional baseball player Sal Maglie. The park also features picnic pavilions, an Olympic-sized swimming pool, a rose garden, Hyde Park Lake (which is annually stocked with trout), and the Hyde Park Ice Pavilion. It is located in the geographic center of Niagara Falls. History Hyde Park was the brainchild of Charles B. Hyde, the owner of a paper company at the corner of Hyde Park Boulevard (then known as Sugar Street) and Pine Avenue. When he sold the paper company and retired, he bought a large tract of land on what was then the outskirts of the city. In 1921, he suffered a stroke and died. By that time, he had willed the land to the city for use as a park. A year later, additional land was purchased, and the city began to build the park. In the 1930s, a dam was built across Gill Creek, which flooded swampland and created Hyde Park Lake. In 1928, the Niagara Falls Power Company donated to the park. The company donated additional land in 1943. Sal Maglie Stadium was originally built in 1936 as a Works Progress Administration project during the Great Depression and dedicated by U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt. Originally known as Hyde Park Stadium, it was built as a multi-purpose facility. In the 1980s, the stadium was renamed Sal Maglie Stadium to honor the Major League Baseball player who had grown up in Niagara Falls. In 1998, it was demolished and rebuilt as a facility designed only for baseball.

The monastery was built up in the place full of flowing streams near Akner village \\"Sisuan\\" by Ghevond Alishan, Venice 1885 that geographically correspond to Eƒüner village at the present time. # Akants Anapat () in Armenian language means the temple at the streams.

Akner monastery consisted of three churches: # St. Astvadzatzin () meaning Saint Mother of God. # St. Hakob (or St. Nshan) () meaning Saint Jack (or Saint Sign). # St. Arakelots () meaning Saint Apostles. History Akner was one of the most significant monasteries of Cilician Armenia. It was built by the king Levon II in 1198‚Äì1203 AD and was anointed by the Catholicos of Cilician Armenia Gregory Apirat. Akner's foundation coincided with Cilician Armenia's golden age; that is why it was also functioning as the place of council of war and ecclesiastical council. We have eulogizing notes left from Armenian historians (listed below) about Akner monastery:\\"Cilicia's Monasteries\\" by H.

Besides the monastic functions it has: # High level of creating manuscripts and handwritten books. # Medieval school and university. # Matenadaran (storage of medieval Armenian books, manuscripts) and picture gallery.\\"Cilicia's Monasteries\\" by H. Voskyan, Vienna 1957 # House of Armenian church musics. In the short period Akner became famous of its high-level manuscriptal and drawing craft. Akner was highly associated with many other medieval Armenia's monasteries. Manuscripts of Petros, David, Barsegh, Ghazar, Vardan, Nerses, Serovbe (son of Nerses) and some other monks told about unsurpassed skill of hand-writing and graphical works in Akner monsatery. Since the early 13th century. Akner's religious house existed in the monastery.\\"Christian Armenia\\" Encyclopaedia, Yerevan 2002, p.29-30 In 1273 A.D. Grigor Aknertsi became a leader of Akner's order. He has written \\"The history of Nestorians\\" () book referring to Mikayel Asori's works. The 13th century was a period of growth and Akner's religious house collaborating with another Cilician Armenia's abbeys like Grner and Bardzraberd monasteries created a graphic's school famed in all medieval world.\\"Cilician Miniature 12th and 13th Centuries\\" ()by L. Azaryan, Jerusalem 1964, pages 76‚Äì88 In Akner monastery studied many enlightened personalities like Poghos (), Grigor (), Karapet (), Hovhannes (), Ruben (), Barsegh () monks and many others. Akner's religious house has a spirited participation in Cilician Armenia's different scopes of activity. Armenian Catholicos Grigor Anavarzatsi 7th () it the letter to the king Levon II in 1306 A.D. says \\"Akner's religious house consists of very decent, exemplary, clever people\\".

In Akner monastery was buried the heart of the king Levon II, Paghtin Marajakht, many princes, abbots and monks. Approximately in 1375 the monastery was damaged by Mameluks. But many years later it was reconstructed and in the 18th century, Akner was a functioning Armenian monastery \\"Christian Armenia\\" Encyclopaedia, Yerevan 2002, p30 in Adana province of Ottoman empire.

Constitutional establishment It is established by part V of the Constitution, adopted upon Nauru's independence from Australia in 1968. Art. 48 of the Constitution establishes the Supreme Court as \\"a superior court of record\\", with jurisdiction prescribed constitutionally and by law. Art.49 stipulates that the Chief Justice is appointed by the President and sits with other justices, likewise appointed by the President, whose number is to be determined by law. Only barristers and solicitors who have been practising for at least five years may be appointed to the Supreme Court. Articles 50 and 51 prescribe that a Supreme Court judge vacates his or her office upon attaining the age of 65 (unless that age limit be amended by legislation), or upon being removed for incapacity or misconduct by a motion adopted by at least two-thirds of members of Parliament, or upon tending his or her resignation to the President. Art.54 stipulates that \\"[t]he Supreme Court shall, to the exclusion of any other court, have original jurisdiction to determine any question arising under or involving the interpretation or effect of any provision of th[e] Constitution\\"; art.55 prescribes that Cabinet \\"may refer questions on Constitution to the Supreme Court\\", and that \\"the Supreme Court shall pronounce in open court its opinion on the question\\".Constitution of Nauru Thus the Supreme Court is empowered to deliver an advisory opinion, albeit only upon questions referred to it by Cabinet.Barry Connell CJ., Constitutional Reference; In re Dual Nationality and Other Questions (2004), Supreme Court of Nauru Jurisdiction The Supreme Court has both original and appellate jurisdiction. The Pacific Islands Legal Information Institute notes that the Supreme Court \\"has unlimited original civil jurisdiction and although the Courts Act [1972] does not so specify it is assumed that it has original criminal jurisdiction\\".\\"Nauru Courts System Information\\", Pacific Islands Legal Information Institute Additionally, as per the Appeals Act 1972, the Supreme Court hears appeals from the District Court in both criminal and civil cases, on questions of fact or law.Appeals Act 1972 The Family Court, however, functions separately, and no appeal is possible from this court to the Supreme Court. Despite its name, the Supreme Court is not the highest court of appeal in most cases. Its judgements on constitutional matters are final, but any other case may be appealed further to the Appellate Court.\\"Nauru: Courts & Judgments\\", United States Department of State In addition, art.57 of the Constitution stipulates that \\"Parliament may provide that an appeal lies as prescribed by law from a judgment, decree, order or sentence of the Supreme Court to a court of another country\\". This provision was implemented in an agreement between Nauru and Australia in 1976, providing for appeals from the Supreme Court of Nauru to the High Court of Australia in both criminal and civil cases, with certain exceptions; in particular, no case pertaining to the Constitution of Nauru may be decided by the Australian court., 6 September 1976 This appellate jurisdiction concluded on 12 March 2018 after the Government of Nauru unilaterally ended the arrangement, which had previously been advocated by the Australian Law Reform Commission) and others as sitting awkwardly with the High Court of Australia's other responsibilities. In a speech to parliament on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of Nauru's independence, President Baron Waqa stated: \\"Severance of ties to Australia‚Äôs highest court is a logical step towards full nationhood and an expression of confidence in Nauru‚Äôs ability to determine its own destiny.\\" Nauruan Justice Minister David Adeang cited the cost of appeals to the High Court as another reason for Nauru to establish its own Court of Appeal as the country's highest court. The termination of the agreement required 90 days notice, which Nauru gave on 12 December 2017, but did not become known until after the Supreme Court had reheard a case relating to a 2015 protest outside the Nauruan parliament that was remitted to it \\"for hearing according to law\\" by the High Court after quashing the original decision. The reheard case again imposed increased sentences on the defendants who, with the new Court of Appeals not yet established, have been left with no avenue of appeal, a situation that has been criticised as deeply unfair. As Nauruan law is derived from the English and Australian common law system, precedents set by the Supreme Court are integrated to national law, and the Supreme Court's interpretation of the law binds lower courts. Such precedents are, however, superseded by statute law.\\"Consolidation of Legislation Project\\", Parliament of Nauru Cases The Supreme Court heard its first case, Detamaigo v Demaure, in April 1969. The case consisted in an \\"appeal against a decision of the Nauru Lands Committee as to the persons beneficially entitled to the personality of the estate of a deceased Nauruan\\". In a very brief ruling, Chief Justice Thompson struck out the appeal, on the grounds that \\"this Court has no jurisdiction to entertain appeals from the Nauru Lands Committee's determinations in respect of personalty\\", as such jurisdiction was not specifically provided by the Nauru Lands Committee Ordinance 1956.Detamaigo v Demaure, Supreme Court of Nauru, 1969 The first constitutional case to reach the Supreme Court was Jeremiah v Nauru Local Government Council, decided in March 1971, on petition to the Supreme Court. The petitioner, Jeremiah, was a Nauruan man who wished to marry a non-Nauruan woman. The Nauru Local Government Council, whose consent was required for any lawful marriage between a Nauruan and a non-Nauruan (as per the Births, Deaths and Marriages Ordinance 1957), refused to grant consent, without providing a reason. Jeremiah argued this was a violation of article 3 of the Constitution, which provides that \\"every person in Nauru is entitled to the fundamental rights and freedoms of the individual\\". Chief Justice Thompson, however, ruled that the constitutional meaning of \\"fundamental rights and freedoms of the individual\\" was to be restricted to the rights and freedoms explicitly established by the Constitution. Thus, no constitutional right to marry existed.In re the Constitution, Jeremiah v Nauru Local Government Council, Supreme Court of Nauru, 1971 In October 2010, the Supreme Court ruled on its most recent constitutional case, In the Matter of the Constitution and in the Matter of the Dissolution of the Eighteenth Parliament, to determine whether the dissolution of a deadlocked Parliament and the ensuing proclamation of a state of emergency by President Marcus Stephen were constitutionally valid.

They have been present since the late 19th century, when their first members were selected by the Dutch colonizers from the former Dutch East Indies.  History  Javanese immigrants from the Dutch East Indies, picture taken between 1880-1900. After the abolition of slavery, the plantations in Suriname needed a new source of labor. In 1890, the influential Netherlands Trading Society, owner of the plantation Mari√´nburg in Suriname, undertook a test to attract Javanese contract workers from the Dutch East Indies. Until then, primarily Hindustani contract workers from British India worked at the Suriname plantations as field and factory workers. On 9 August, the first Javanese arrived in Paramaribo. The test was considered successful and by 1894 the colonial government took over the task of recruiting Javanese hands. They came in small groups from the Dutch East Indies to the Netherlands, and from there to Paramaribo. The transport of Javanese immigrants continued until 1914 (except 1894) in two stages through Amsterdam. Monument commemorating the 100 years (1890-1990) of Javanese presence in Suriname. Sana Budaya, Paramaribo, Suriname. The workers came from villages in Central and East Java. Departure points were Batavia, Semarang and Tandjong Priok. The recruited workers and their families awaited their departure in a depot, where they were inspected and registered and where they signed their contract. The immigrants were recruited to work on the plantations. The exception was a group in 1904, when 77 Javanese were recruited specifically to work at the Colonial Railways. From World War I Javanese also worked at the Suriname Bauxite Company in Moengo. Immigration continued until 13 December 1939. The outbreak of World War Two ended transplantation schemes.  Population  A total of 32,965 Javanese immigrants went to Suriname. In 1954, 8,684 Javanese returned to Indonesia, with the rest remaining in Suriname. The census of 1972 counted 57,688 Javanese in Suriname, and in 2004 there were 71,879. In addition, in 2004 more than 60,000 people of mixed descent were recorded, with an unknown number of part Javanese descent.  Diaspora  In 1953, a large group of 300 families (1,200 people), led by Salikin Hardjo, went back to Indonesia on the ship Langkuas of the Royal Rotterdam Lloyd. They intended to settle in Java or Lampung, but their request was not approved by the Indonesian government, and instead they were sent to West Sumatra. They established the village of Tongar, also referred to as Tongass in Kabupaten Pasaman, north of Padang, clearing land and building new houses. They integrated smoothly with the Minangkabau community, despite the fact that most of the Javanese were Christian. Marriages with the mainly Muslim Minangkabau were common. The current generation is said to identify more as Indonesian than Surinamese, but still maintain contacts with family and friends in Suriname and the Netherlands, sometimes traveling to those countries. In the 1970s, 20-25,000 Javanese Surinamese went to the Netherlands. They settled mainly in and around cities such as Groningen, Amsterdam, The Hague, Rotterdam and Zoetermeer. They are well integrated into Dutch society, but preserve their Javanese identity through associations and regularly organized meetings. Most still have relatives in Suriname and send remittances, and regularly visit Suriname.

Life Born at Cockington or Berry Pomeroy, Devon, he was the second son of George Cary of Cockington, and Elizabeth, daughter of Sir Edward Seymour. He was admitted a commoner of Exeter College, Oxford on 4 October 1631. He became a scholar of Corpus Christi College, Oxford in October 1634, and graduated B.A. 1635, M.A. 1638‚Äì9. He was probably fellow of his college. His kinsman, William Seymour, Marquess of Hertford, who was chancellor of the university, obtained for him the degree of D.C.L. in November 1644; and later promoted him to the rectory of Portlemouth, near Kingsbridge. Cary became intimate with the local presbyterians and was made moderator of his division of the county. On the Restoration, however, he was one of the first to congratulate the king, and was installed archdeacon of Exeter on 18 August 1662. He gave up his preferment, feeling threatened by 'some great men then in power' in 1664, and retired to his rectory, where he lived quietly till his death, on 19 September 1688. Works His major work was Palaeologia Chronica; a chronological account of ancient time, in three parts, (1) Didactical; (2) Apodeictical; (3) Canonical, (1677), an attempt to settle ancient chronology.

He was a pioneer of professional race-riding, developing a trademark late finishing style, known as the 'Chifney rush' and was the retained jockey of the Prince of Wales. He became the leading horseman of his day, winning four runnings of the Oaks and one of the Derby, but his career ended in ignominy after a scandal around a ride on the Prince of Wales's horse, Escape. Despite inventing a bit for horses that is still in use today, he died in debtors' prison in London. Riding career Chifney was born in Northwold, Norfolk around 1753Norfolk Transcription Archive - Surname CHIFNEY Retrieved 2010-11-01. and, entering Foxe's stables at Newmarket Racecourse in 1770, soon learned the rudiments of horse racing. He said of himself, \\"In 1773 I could ride horses in a better manner in a race to beat others than any other person ever known in my time, and in 1775 I could train horses for running better than any person I ever yet saw. Riding I learnt myself and training I learnt from Mr. Richard Prince, training groom to Lord Foley\\". In 1787 he rode for the Duke of Bedford, and two years later won The Derby on Skyscraper for the Duke. For Lord Grosvenor he won The Oaks on Ceres in 1782, and on Maid of the Oaks in 1783. In 1789 Chifney rode the winners of both the Derby and the Oaks, riding Skyscraper to victory in the Derby for the Duke of Bedford and Tagg for Lord Egremont in the Oaks,Country Life, vol. 118 (1955), pp. 330‚Äì331 becoming the first man to ride the double. The next year he won the Oaks again, riding Hypolita for the Duke of Bedford. Few people liked Chifney, many regarding him as an \\"arrogant little upstart\\" from Norfolk. He was also known to be something of a dandy, to an extent that bordered on the effeminate, with hair flowing out from the front of his cap, ruffs and frills on his clothing and bunches of ribbons on his boots. This self-confidence and attitude distinguished him as \\"the first professional jockey as we understand the term\\", although added to this, he had a reputation for dishonesty ‚Äì \\"he dressed like a mannequin, nurtured an ego the size of a house and was as bent as a paper clip.\\" Riding style Chifney was an instinctive horseman, whose considered approach contrasted with the untutored 'grooms' who had come before him. He is widely considered to have transformed race-riding, \\"from a ritual slogging match, to a mounted chess game.\\" Chifney's style of riding was to keep a slack rein ‚Äì a method which has never found much favour, but which in his case was successful. He wrote that when pulling up, one should never jerk the mouth of the horse, doing it \\"as if you had a silken rein, as fine as a hair, and you were afraid of breaking it\\" and that the horse \\"should be enticed to ease himself an inch at a time, as his situation will allow.\\" At Guildford for the King's Plate, he was given a heavy bridle for the horse Knowsley, a notoriously hard puller. He is reported to have said, \\"take away that silly gimcrack and bring me a plain snaffle.\\" He won easily that day, and again at Winchester subsequently. On Eagle, an idle horse that he advised the Duke of Dorset to buy from Sir Frank Standish, he ran in the King's Plate at Newmarket. Standish was so sure that no-one could get the best out of the horse, that he advised Dorset not to back him \\"for a halfpenny.\\" Chifney responded saying, \\"I'll let Sir Frank Standish see whether I can get him out or not and what's more, I'll neither use whip nor spur to him.\\" The horse won by a neck, with neither whip nor spur, as Chifney had said. Another favoured tactic of Chifney's was easing the load on a horse's back by constantly adjusting his seat throughout a race. \\"Suppose a man had been carrying a stone in one hand, would he not find much ease by shifting it into the other?\\" he himself argued. Most distinctively, Chifney was also one of the first to ride a waiting race, coming towards the finish with a tremendous rush. In fact, the idea of saving a horse for a late run became known as the 'Chifney rush'. Chifney's manner of riding has been described thus: \\"He approached a race as if it were a piece of music, playing it slow and quiet until coming at the end with a beautifully modulated crescendo, sweeping past his one-paced rivals.\\" He was considered the best horseman of his time; at tall, he could ride at 7 stone 12 pounds ‚Äì ‚Äì reducing from his natural weight of 9 stone 5 pounds during the summer. He was regarded by fellow jockey, Frank Buckle, as a \\"model of perfection\\". The Escape scandal On 14 July 1790 Chifney was hired as \\"rider for life\\" by the Prince of Wales to ride his racehorses at a salary of 200 guineas a year. However, in the second year of his commission, Chifney became embroiled in a scandal which would ruin his career. On Thursday 20 October, Chifney rode the Prince's horse, Escape, at Newmarket in a 60 guinea race over two miles of the Ditch in Course. He started as 2/1 on favourite but finished last of four, behind Mr Dawson's Coriander, Lord Grosvenor's Skylark and Lord Clermont's Pipator. The following day at odds of 5/1, Escape then overturned the form to win over four miles of the Beacon Course, ahead of Skylark in third. Suspicions were immediately raised that Chifney had pulled the horse in the original race to secure a better price for his money on the Friday. Warwick Lake, the Prince's racing manager, fearing the furore that was to break, immediately responded to the Prince, saying, \\"I give your Royal Highness joy, but I am sorry the horse has won. I would sooner have given a hundred guineas.\\" Charles James Fox wrote in a letter at the time, \\"... people will suspect\\". Chifney was duly summoned before the Jockey Club to explain himself. He stated that the horse had needed the race on the Thursday to \\"clear his pipes\\" and, knowing this, he had had no bet on the first run and 20 guineas on the second. The stewards did not accept the explanation and warned the Prince of Wales that if he continued to use Chifney, no gentleman would race against him. In consequence, not wanting to make an example of his jockey, the Prince of Wales sold his stable and ended his connection with the turf. He told Chifney he would be unlikely to return to ownership, \\"but if I ever do, Sam Chifney, you shall train and manage them. You shall have your 200 guineas a year all the same. I cannot give it to you for your life, I can only give it to you for my own. You have been a good and honest servant to me.\\" Seeing Chifney later at Brighton in 1802, he remarked, \\"Sam Chifney, there's never been a proper apology made; they [the Jockey Club] used me and you very ill. They are bad people ‚Äì I'll not set foot on the ground more.\\" It has been suggested that in the modern day, Chifney's justification for Escape's performance would have been accepted by stewards. Escape had never been a consistent horse, the two races were over different distances and he may indeed have needed a race. Moreover, he had won twice over the Beacon Course in October, but tried over the two-mile Oatlands Stakes at Ascot, he had been beaten into fourth. So, while there may indeed have been sharp practice involved, in the absence of evidence, the explanation would have to be accepted under modern rules. This has led some to conclude that the incident may just have been the opportunity the stewards needed to target Chifney, who had long been under suspicion. Warwick Lake was known to dislike Chifney's influence and arrogance and may, according to Jockey Club member Anthony St Leger, have been the driving force behind the case. Later life In 1795 Chifney, in reduced circumstances, wrote and published (or probably had written for him) a book entitled Genius Genuine, by Samuel Chifney of Newmarket. This book, although merely an octavo of 170 pages, sold for ¬£5. Sales must have been adequate, for a second edition appeared in 1804. In 1800, he published The Narrative or Address of Samuel Chifney, Rider for Life to his Royal Highness the Prince of Wales at a price of two shillings sixpence. The year before, he was again castigated for his riding of Mr. Cookson's Sir Harry, but it afterwards became apparent that in this case the horse and not the rider was at fault. Chifney left Newmarket for London in 1800, never to return. In 1806, he sold his annuity of 200 guineas from the Prince of Wales for ¬£1,260. Chifney invented a bit for horses, which is named after him and still in use. It consists of a curb and two snaffles, and exerts greater pressure on the sides of the horse's mouth. The Chifney bit is sometimes described as an Uppingham bit with pelham cheeks and a snaffle mouth.Patents 1805, No. 2809 He had hoped the Jockey Club might fund the bit, saying, \\"if the Jockey Club will be pleased to give me 200 guineas, I will make them a bridle as I believe never was, and I believe never can be, excelled, for their light weights to hold horses from running away.\\" The Jockey Club never took up the offer, and in connection with his bit he became indebted to a saddler named Latchford for ¬£350. He was committed to Fleet Prison for the debt, and died there aged 52 on 8 January 1807. Chifney is buried at St. Sepulchre- without-Newgate, Holborn. Family Chifney married the daughter of Newmarket trainer Frank Smallman. They had two sons, both well known, and four daughters. The elder son, William Chifney (born at Newmarket in 1784), became a trainer at Newmarket. On 31 May 1803 he publicly thrashed Lieutenant-Colonel George Leigh (an equerry to the Prince of Wales) for accusing his father of cheating during the Escape case. For that assault, he was imprisoned for six months in Cambridge. He died in Pancras Square, Pancras Road, London on 14 October 1862. Chifney's younger son, Samuel, was born in 1786. He also became jockey to the Prince of Wales, first riding for him at the Stockbridge meeting in 1802. He also used the slack-rein technique originated by his father and 'the Chifney rush'. He was five times winner of the Oaks, twice of the Derby and once, aged 57, of the 1,000 Guineas. One of his daughters married the royal trainer William Butler (c. 1783‚Äì1827), and became the mother of the well-known jockey Frank Butler, another married a Mr Weatherby of Newmarket.

In 1640, a large icon of the Hodegetria type (originally in Caffa) which belonged to the Dominican Church of S. Maria di Costantinopoli, located inside the walled city of Istanbul and in that year converted into a mosque, was moved here.M√ºller-Wiener (1977), p. 188. In 1660 the church and the monastery burned and, since the destruction had been total (except for the icon which could be rescued), according to the law the ground was returned to the Ottoman Government. Despite that, thanks to the intercession of the European Powers, a new church could be built again in 1702. Since 1706, after the Dominicans refused to deliver the Hodegetria Icon to Venice, the Republic quit paying the subsidy to the church. Around those years, the Icon was partially repainted (the mantle of the Virgin appears now embroidered with the Fleurs-de-lis of France), so that only her face and chest are possibly original. The complex burned again during the great fire of Galata in 1731, and was rebuilt with wood. From 1841 to 1843 the Swiss-Italian brothers Gaspare and Giuseppe Fossati erected the present building. Together with Saint Anthony and Saint Mary Draperis, SS. Peter and Paul was one of the three Levantine parishes in Beyoƒülu.Schmitt (2005) The parish jurisdiction extended over the lower part of the Galata neighborhood, a popular area which often became the first residence for European immigrants settling in the city. Due to that, the parish's birth, wedding and death registers represent an invaluable source for the history of the recurring waves of immigration in the 18th and 19th century. The church now serves the local Maltese community, with masses in Italian. Architecture The church is built in the form of a basilica, with a four side altar. The cupola over the choir is sky blue, studded with gold stars. The church's rear wall is built into a section of Galata's old Genoese ramparts. The church possesses several relics: those of Saint Renatus (found in the catacombs of Galata), and others of Saint Thomas, Saint Dominic and the Saints Peter and Paul. The yard East of the church's entrance takes the form of a narrow alleyway enclosed by high walls which are covered with sculptures and inscribed gravestones, most of them in Italian. More graves are contained in the church's crypt.

Life John Chorlton was born at Salford in 1666. On 4 April 1682 he was admitted to be educated for the ministry at Rathmell Academy under Richard Frankland. On completing his studies he was chosen (7 Aug. 1687) as assistant to Henry Newcome, the founder of nonconformity in Manchester. On 8 March 1689 he married Hannah, daughter of Joseph Leeche. On Newcome's death (17 Sept. 1695) he became pastor. The congregation on 14 Oct. 1695 invited Oliver Heywood to become his colleague, but the old man declined to leave Northowram. An assistant was obtained (1697) in the person of an adventurer passing under the name of Gaskeld, who, after pleasing the Manchester presbyterians with his learning and eloquence, disappeared (1698) with a borrowed horse, made his way to Hull (where he called himself Midgely, and falsely represented himself as one of the authors of Letters Writ by a Turkish Spy), and finally fled to Holland. On Frankland's death (1 Oct. 1698) at Rathmell, Chorlton, with great spirit, resolved to continue Frankland's 'northern academy', transferring it to Manchester. Accordingly on 21 March 1699 he ‚Äòset up teaching university learning in a great house at Manchester.‚Äô Eleven of Frankland's students finished their course with him, and the names of twenty others who studied under him are known. His most distinguished student was Thomas Dixon. James Clegg, one of the transferred students, is our chief authority on the mode in which the academy was conducted. He describes Chorlton as a worthy successor to Frankland, and superior as a preacher. Matthew Henry speaks of his ‚Äòextraordinary quickness and readiness of expression; a casuist, one of a thousand, a wonderful clear head.‚Äô Chorlton now wanted assistance both in the pulpit and in the academy. Applications were made in 1699 to James Owen of Oswestry and Thomas Bradbury, both of whom declined. Next year the services of James Coningham were secured. The ‚Äòprovincial meeting‚Äô of Lancashire ministers gave a public character to the academy, passing resolutions in its favour and raising funds for its support. At the summer assizes of 1703 Chorlton was presented for keeping a public academy, but through private influence the prosecution was stayed. Chorlton's labours were cut short in his prime. He suffered from stone, and died in his fortieth year on 16 May 1705; he was buried at the collegiate church (now Manchester Cathedral) on 19 May. Works *(Anon.)

Three years later he was also instituted to the rectory of Thurlow Parva in Norfolk, and in 1693 Dr. John Moore, then bishop of Norwich, who was well acquainted with his abilities and virtues, collated him to the archdeaconry of Sudbury. In 1704 he graduated D.D., and in 1707 he was instituted to the rectory of Hitcham, Suffolk. He died in January 1727, and was buried in the chancel of the parish church in which he had been so long preacher. He is reported to have been a good preacher, and a charitable and blameless man.

Works His early essays in the Gentleman's Magazine, under the signatures of \\"Indagator\\" and \\"Indagator Roffensis\\", obtained for him the friendship of Samuel Denne, the Kentish antiquary. In 1790 Denne communicated to the Society of Antiquaries, as an appendix to his own paper on \\"Stone Seats in the Chancels of Churches\\", some observations by Clarke on the same subject. Three years later Clarke returned the compliment by addressing to Denne his \\"Observations on Episcopal Chairs and Stone Seats; as also on Piscinas and other appendages to Altars still remaining in Chancels; with a Description of Chalk Church, in the Diocese of Rochester\\", a paper, with four plates from drawings by the author, printed in Arch√¶ologia, xi. 317‚Äì74. Clarke was elected F.S.A. on 7 April 1796. Other papers of his appeared in John Britton's Architectural Antiquities (vols. i. and iv.). He also revised and prefaced a work left by his near relative, William Oram, entitled \\"Precepts and Observations on the Art of Colouring in Landscape Painting\\" (1810). His other works are: * Observations on the intended Tunnel beneath the river Thames, shewing the many defects in the present state of that projection (Gravesend, 1799). The project was that of Ralph Dodd, for a subway from Gravesend to Tilbury. Clarke had previously written on the subject in the Gentleman's Magazine. * Some Account of the Rise and Progress of Early English Architecture, with descriptional Remarks on the Churches of the Metropolis, prefixed to Architectura Ecclesiastica Londini, a series of views by John Coney, George Sidney Shepherd, and other artists, of the churches of London, published 1819, and reissued with a new title-page the following year. * Architectura Ecclesiastica Londini; Or Graphical Survey Of The Cathedral, Collegiate And Parochial Churches, In London, Southwark, And Westminster...

It was built in the late 17th century and rebuilt after a fire in 1902. It is a grade II listed building, as is an 18th-century folly tower in the grounds. It is built in three storeys of roughcast brick with ashlar dressing and a hipped slate roof. The layout is H-shaped with a central block of 5 bays and an overall frontage of 9 bays. In the 1960s the estate covered 12,000 acres, much of it moorland and woodland, and included Bolton Castle. History The Bolton estate belonged to the Scrope family since mediaeval times, based on Bolton Castle. After the death in 1630 of Emanuel Scrope, 1st Earl of Sunderland, without any legitimate children, the estate was inherited by Mary, the eldest of his three illegitimate daughters. She married Charles, Marquess of Winchester. Bolton Hall was originally built in 1678 for the Marquess, who in 1689 was elevated to be the first Duke of Bolton by a grateful King William III for his support in the Glorious Revolution. It passed down through five succeeding Dukes of Bolton to Harry Powlett, 6th Duke of Bolton, an admiral in the Royal Navy. The sixth Duke died without a male heir in 1794 and the dukedom became extinct, the Bolton estates devolving on his brother's natural daughter Jean Browne-Powlett. She married Thomas Orde, who in 1795 assumed the additional surname of Powlett and was a Tory politician. He served as Chief Secretary for Ireland and was ennobled in 1797 as Baron Bolton. In 1902 the hall suffered a serious fire and was afterwards rebuilt. The estate has since passed down to Harry Algar Nigel Orde-Powlett, 8th Baron Bolton, who inherited on his father's death. The current Baron resides at Bolton Hall, which was originally built in 1675. His residence in 2016 was Wensley Hall, Wensley, Leyburn. Bolton Castle is run by his son and daughter-in-law, Thomas and Katie Orde-Powlett.

Clay was the fifth son of Thomas Clay of Liverpool, ship and anchor smith, who died in 1821, by Mary, daughter of Ralph Lowe of Williamson Square, Liverpool, tanner. He was born in Liverpool on 10 May 1796, and after receiving a commercial education entered a merchant's office, but the failure of his master left him at the age of twenty-one without employment. He had, however, mechanical genius, and invented a chair for persons suffering with spinal complaints, and an improved bow and arrow which long bore his name. After spending a considerable time in self-education he was ordained as a literate by the Bishop of Chester on 11 August 1821, and obtained a title for orders by acting as assistant-chaplain at Preston house of correction. On 22 September 1822 he was ordained a priest, and soon after entered as a ten-years man at Emmanuel College, Cambridge, but did not keep the three terms required until 1834‚Äì35, when he took his degree as bachelor of divinity. He became chaplain of the gaol in 1823, and held the post for thirty-six years. His one ambition in life was the reformation and reclamation of prisoners, and to this end he incessantly laboured. His experience soon taught him that the indiscriminate mixture of prisoners was the great hindrance to any improvement in their moral condition, and his chief efforts were made in the direction of the silent and separate confinement of criminals. He befriended all who deserved help, and communicated with their friends. He stated that in eighteen years he was only once insulted by a prisoner. From 1824 he commenced issuing annual reports, and after a time entered so minutely into the details of prison management that his report became a thick octavo volume and made him an authority on criminal reform. In 1836 his annual reports were reprinted in a parliamentary blue book, and in a debate on education three years afterwards Lord John Russell quoted Clay's description of the ignorance of many of the prisoners. The chaplain in 1847 gave valuable evidence before Lord Brougham's committee of investigation into the question of the execution of the criminal laws. Lord Harrowby, then chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster, offered him, when he was in pecuniary difficulties, the rectory of Castleford, Yorkshire, but with conscientious ideas about keeping curates there, he declined the gift. Ill-health obliged him to resign his chaplaincy in January 1858. He died at Leamington on 21 November 1858. He married, 11 March 1828, Henrietta, third daughter of Mr. Fielding; she died at Preston on 28 June 1858. Besides the prison reports already mentioned he was the author of: *Twenty-five Sermons, 1827. *Burial Clubs and Infanticide in England. A Letter to W. Brown, esq., M.P., 1854. *A Plain Address to Candidates for Confirmation, 1866.

Early career Clay was appointed ensign on 6 Nov 1782, in a Scottish independent company, commanded by Captain, afterwards Lieutenant-Colonel James Abercrombie, then stationed in the north of England. He was placed on half-pay when the company was reduced some months later, but exchanged to full pay in the 45th Regiment of Foot in December 1784, and joining that regiment in Ireland, accompanied it to the West Indies in 1786. He obtained his lieutenancy on 30 April 1788. In 1794 he served with the 2nd provisional battalion of light infantry in the expedition against Martinique, and highly distinguished himself at St. Pierre on the windward side of the island, where he led the forlorn hope in the attack on Morne du Pin. His party consisted of a sergeant and twelve men. With a few of them he gained the summit in rear of the enemy's position just at daybreak. Finding themselves unexpectedly assailed from that quarter, the French precipitately retreated, leaving a brass field-gun in the captors' hands, but not until after the officer in command had been wounded by Clay. Service at home After serving at the sieges of Forts Louis and Bourbon, and at the capture of St. Lucia, Clay returned home and purchased a company in the 105th Regiment of Foot, then raising at Leeds, in which, by priority of army service, he became senior captain, and in 1795 major, but the regiment being drafted into others soon after, he was placed on half-pay. In 1797-9 he served on the staff as brigade-major to Major-General Cornelius Cuyler at Brighton, and to Major-General Samuel Hulse at Lewes, and elsewhere in Kent and Sussex, and during the same period was detached for a time with the brigade of guards sent to Ireland in 1798. In 1800 a number of line regiments formed second battalions from the militia, the men being enlisted for two years or the continuance of the war, among them being the 54th Regiment of Foot, in which Clay was appointed major on 19 May 1800. Service overseas He accompanied the battalion to Quiberon, Ferrol, and Cadiz, and afterwards to Egypt, where he was present in the actions of 12‚Äì13 March 1801, and at the siege of Alexandria, and had his horse killed under him at Marabout on 21 Aug. during General Eyre Coote's operations against the city from the westward. For his services in Egypt he received the insignia of the Ottoman Order of the Crescent, and also the gold medal given by the Porte. His battalion ceasing to exist at the peace, Clay was again placed on half-pay. After the renewal of the war, he was brought into the 3rd Buffs, and sent to London to assist in organising the battalions of the army of reserve in Middlesex, London, and the Tower Hamlets, and in June 1804 was appointed assistant inspector-general of that force, returns of which will be found in the Annual Register, 1804, pp. 567‚Äì70. Disturbances in Manchester On its dissolution soon after, Clay was appointed to a lieutenant-colonelcy on half-pay of the 24th Dragoons, and made inspecting field-officer of the Manchester recruiting district. He was senior military officer there in May 1808, when very serious disturbances broke out among the operatives in Manchester and the neighbouring towns, which he succeeded in suppressing in a few days with a very small force, and received the special thanks of General Champagn√©, commanding the north-west district. Four years later riots again occurred, but a timely example made at Middleton, where the mob attacked the mill and burned the dwelling-house of Mr. Burton, a leading manufacturer, and attempted to fire on the troops, so completely dismayed them, that they ceased to assemble in any large numbers. On the arrival of three militia regiments as reinforcements, Clay was appointed to the command of a brigade at Manchester.

He is the author of six books. Three of them are Dead Machine E/Ditions: In The Great World (small) (his first novel),Conversations with Carlo (a collection of poetry), and The Greyhound Quarto (a small piece of non-fiction). The other three: Living Broke: Short Stories, and two collections of poetry, Lines from Another Book of Common Prayer and Fragments of Unidentifiable Form were published by Publish America. His work has been featured on semantikon.com and has appeared in The Dispatch Litareview, The American Mythville Review, The Smoking Poet, and Antique Children. These days he's traveling America on the cheap and writing about it at americanrevisionary.com. He has been a teacher, a factory worker, a file clerk, a small press publisher (The One Legged Cow Press), a freelance journalist, and a lifelong layabout. Works =Fiction= In The Great World (small) (2010) This debut novel, published exclusively as an e-book, is written in a series of interconnected episodes. Written in first person from the point of view of an unnamed young man in his mid-20s, the novel is an exploration of the American Dream in the 21st. The narrator is unapologetic, rude, lazy, occasionally noble, generally a coward, and always his own worst enemy. He‚Äôs somehow managed to create a comfortable ‚Äì if shaky ‚Äì bubble of comfort in Phoenix after being displaced by Hurricane Katrina. He lives in a cheap motel; he hangs out at the MTP Sports Bar and Grill ‚Äì when he has money ‚Äì and drinks in his room when he doesn‚Äôt. He scrapes by on day labor and a short-term work ethic. He‚Äôs got no interest in regular work, going back to college, doing anything, or maintaining a relationship. Through him we meet other people who are just as broken, though less aware of their situation, and we view the world the narrator lives in: a post 9/11 two-dimensional world without morality or ethics, where people get screwed over whether they do the right thing or not; a world of drug dealers, abused wives, manipulated boy toys, bookies, hookers, crooked cops, and a cocaine-addled bar owner. All of them are, like the narrator, just looking for some kind of shaky comfort in the world; and, just like the narrator, unable to find it. Living Broke: Short Stories (2010) These stories are a collection of darkly humorous, visceral, and honest images of life in America since the turn of the century. The characters are all trying to survive and get by in spite of living in a world where there is never enough, where hard work is not rewarded the way we are always told it will be, and where the divisions between the Haves and Have Nots are increasingly obvious. These are the In-Between People - the people who believed in the Middle Class American Dream and who have found it failing, but have nothing tangible to replace it with. The victories expressed are small and short lived, while the overarching machinations - institution, ambition, greed, loneliness, and isolation - are constants. =Poetry=  Conversation With Carlo (2010) These poems, written over the first year or so of his time in Arizona and published exclusively as an e-book, are at once sad, funny, geographic, and myopic. But like all good poetry, they work to move themselves and the reader outside themselves and into a larger conversation in which words may be the most overrated commodity. Lines From Another Book of Common Prayer (2007) The poems in this second collection, published by POD publisher Publish America, explore the interior landscapes of the spiritual, the spectacular, and the everyday cityscapes and countryside that make us who we are, and from which we are ultimately unable to really escape. For Parsons, the only option is acceptance and the hope that transcendence is still possible in this day and age. Fragments of Unidentifiable Form (2006) In this, his first published collection of poems, Parsons ties the internal geography of everyday life with the machinations of the outside world. By exploring the connections between these two seemingly isolated landscapes, the poems in this collection seek to outline a new geography‚Äîanother continent to explore in a world that seems to be depleted, overworked, and left behind. =Non-Fiction/Essays= The Greyhound Quarto(2010) Travel Writing for the real life traveler. Traveling across the country on a Greyhound bus, Mick Parsons talks about traveling the way you don't get it on the Travel Channel.

John Edwins Cussans. Life Cussans was born in Plymouth 30 October 1837, the fifth child of Thomas Cussans, who had been a lieutenant in the Madras Horse Artillery, by his wife Matilda Ann (n√©e Goodman). After education at North Hill School, Plymouth, he entered a commercial house, and he visited America (1858) and Russia (1861) on business. After his marriage in 1863 he took up writing, working on heraldic and genealogical studies, living in north London. The preface of his History of Hertfordshire was dated from 4 Wyndham Crescent, Junction Road, London, on Christmas Day 1880. Cussans subsequently moved to 46 St. John's Park, Upper Holloway, where he died on 11 September 1899. From 1881 to 1897 Cussans had been secretary of the Anglo-Californian Bank in Austin Friars. He married, on 10 March 1863, Emma Prior, second surviving daughter of John Ward of Hackney, by whom he left eight children. Works His first work, The Grammar of Heraldry, with the Armorial Bearings of all the Landed Gentry in England prior to the Sixteenth Century (London, 1866), was followed in 1869 by Handbook of Heraldry ... with Instructions for tracing Pedigrees and deciphering Manuscripts (London, several editions). He worked for fifteen years on his county history, A History of Hertfordshire, containing an account of the Descents of the various Manors, Pedigrees of Families, Antiquities, Local Customs, &c.; (Hertford, 16 parts forming three folio volumes, 1870‚Äì81). It supplemented the existing histories of Henry Chauncy and Robert Clutterbuck.

This area was one of the first fronts of the war that began in April 1975. The battle was fought for the possession of a small hotel complex, the St. Charles City Center, adjacent to the gilded Corniche seafront area on the Mediterranean, in the north-western corner of the downtown district of Beirut, and it quickly spread to other areas of central Beirut. The often fierce battles that ensued were fought with heavy exchanges of rocket and artillery fire from the various hotel rooftops and rooms. Sniper fire was commonly utilized. Background The Holiday Inn Beirut was used as a vantage point for militias and was badly damaged Situated between the Jounblatt and Minet el-Hosn quarters, the complex grouped a number of modern hotels, comprising the Holiday Inn in Rue Omar Daouk, St. Georges, Phoenicia Inter-Continental, Melkart, Palm Beach, Excelsior, Normandy and the Alcazar, some of them high-rise and not all of which had been completed when the civil war broke out in April 1975. Another tactically valuable multiple-storey building was the yet unfinished 30-story Murr Tower (Arabic: ÿ®ÿ±ÿ¨ ÿßŸÑŸÖÿ±, Burj al-Murr) in the Kantari District and the Rizk Tower (Arabic: ÿ®ÿ±ÿ¨ ÿ±ÿ≤ŸÇ ÿßŸÑÿ£ÿ¥ÿ±ŸÅŸäÿ©, Burj Rizk al-Achrafieh) in Achrafieh, Beirut's tallest buildings at the time which, together with the neighbouring hotels, towered over the residential quarters in adjacent areas, both Christian and Muslim. This district had been spared the effects of the ongoing conflict, and most of the hotels were able to continue functioning normally.O'Ballance, Civil War in Lebanon (1998), p. 28. The Battle of the Hotels =October 1975= The first rounds were exchanged on October 23, 1975, during the final phase of the Battle for the Kantari District, when a detachment of fighters ‚Äì nicknamed the \\"Hawks of az- Zeidaniyya\\" (Arabic: ÿµŸÇŸàÿ± ÿßŸÑÿ≤ŸäÿØÿßŸÜŸäÿ©  Suq≈´r az-ZaydƒÅnƒ´ya) ‚Äì from the Al- Mourabitoun, the militia of the Independent Nasserite Movement (INM) led by Ibrahim Kulaylat occupied the empty Murr Tower after they managed to dislodge its Christian Phalange Kataeb Regulatory Forces (KRF) defenders,Jureidini, McLaurin, and Price, Military operations in selected Lebanese built-up areas (1979), p. 5. and began firing rockets and mortars from the upper floors into the Christian-held neighborhoods below.Jureidini, McLaurin, and Price, Military operations in selected Lebanese built-up areas (1979), p. 8. During the battle, the Al-Mourabitoun reportedly committed some 200‚Äì300 fighters, even though other sources cite a higher number of 500.Khalidi, Conflict and Violence in Lebanon (1983), p. 77. The majority of the buildings were usually defended by an even smaller number of fighters, with no more than 60 militiamen participating on any given day.Jureidini, McLaurin, and Price, Military operations in selected Lebanese built-up areas (1979), p. 6, and Appendix A, Table 2. On October 26, the fighting in Kantari between the Muslim-leftist Lebanese National Movement (LNM) and Christian-rightist Lebanese Front militias spread to the Hotel district. The first hotel/restaurant to be burned down was the Austrian Myrtom House, located next to the Haigazian College in the Rue du Mexique. Customers, including three foreign diplomats, and staff were temporarily held hostage and then released, though two employees are still on the missing list.Newsweek, 10th November 1975.Randall, Going All the Way: Christian Warlords, Israeli Adventurers and the War in Lebanon (2012), page unknown. As a counter-move, Christian fighters of the Phalange KRF militia headed by William Hawi and Bashir Gemayel began to take positions between and around the main hotels, but quickly found themselves at a disadvantage as they were under constant observation and heavy machine gun fire from the Murr Tower. The Phalangists attempted ‚Äì with little success ‚Äì to silence and reduce the Murr Tower by directing small-arms fire at it from the Rizk Tower and Achrafieh.Jureidini, McLaurin, and Price, Military operations in selected Lebanese built-up areas (1979), p. 8. On October 27, backed by a small squadron made up of five makeshift armored cars,O'Ballance, Civil War in Lebanon (1998), p. 32.Kassis, 30 Years of Military Vehicles in Lebanon (2003), p. 30. the Phalangists then moved into the Holiday Inn and the Phoenicia, while militiamen of the NLP Tigers Militia headed by Dany Chamoun moved into the St Georges Hotel. A fierce five-day gun-battle between the INM, Phalange and NLP Tigers ensued, in which the Christian militias also attempt to retake the Murr Tower from its Muslim defenders in Kantari without success.Jureidini, McLaurin, and Price, Military operations in selected Lebanese built-up areas (1979), p. 5. The situation deteriorated further on October 28, when a shooting incident occurred on the steps of the Parliament House at Nejmeh Square in Christian-controlled territory. One car filled with Muslim militiamen from West Beirut managed to reach the Parliament building and after shouting slogans over a loudspeaker against the members of the Assembly, they opened fire on the deputies leaving the building after attending a parliamentary session. Two men were killed, one being a bodyguard of Phalange Leader Pierre Gemayel. He had been standing nearby at that moment, but was not harmed.O'Ballance, Civil War in Lebanon (1998), p. 27. Ruins of the St Georges Hotel, on the right in 2005 Nevertheless, a ceasefire was called upon the belligerents by Prime Minister Rachid Karami on October 29, in order to allow the evacuation of the staff and residents trapped in the hotels, such as the Holiday Inn which held more than 200 people, most of them tourists. The evacuation operation was carried out by a motorized Gendarmerie detachment sent by the Internal Security Forces (ISF), using their Chaimite V200 armored cars and loaned M113 and Panhard M3 VTT armored personnel carriers (APCs) by the Lebanese Army, and fighting resumed as soon as the operation had been completed. Another ceasefire was arranged on October 31 to enable the evacuees to return to collect their belongings, if they so wished. =November 1975= A new ceasefire came into effect on November 3. Prime Minister Karami then tried to demilitarise the Hotel district, but the Phalangists and the NLP Tigers refused to vacate their positions at the Holiday Inn, St Georges, Phoenicia Inter-Continental and neighbouring buildings until the Muslim militiamen who occupied the Murr Tower had been replaced by ISF Gendarmes. Although Karami did manage to persuade the Al- Mourabitoun leader Ibrahim Kulaylat to withdraw his fighters from the Murr Tower, no identical move was ever made by the Phalange militiamen who remained at their positions. Another ceasefire was called on November 8, but it began to break down ten days later as sporadic and occasionally heavy fighting erupted throughout the country. There was, however, little activity in the Hotel district until the following month.Jureidini, McLaurin, and Price, Military operations in selected Lebanese built-up areas (1979), p. 5. =December 1975= Despite the nominal ceasefire, hostilities were resumed on December 8 when the LNM militias launched a major two-pronged offensive to capture the Christian-held Mediterranean seafront and central Beirut. Units of the Lebanese Army moved into the Parliament House and central post office areas, thus blunting the Muslim-leftist drive toward the city centre.Jureidini, McLaurin, and Price, Military operations in selected Lebanese built-up areas (1979), p. 5. However, fighting continued on the Hotel district, as the Al-Mourabitoun, with assorted LNM allies and in conjunction with As-Saiqa, attacked the buildings occupied by the Christian militias. In this round of assaults Soviet-made RPG-7 anti-tank rocket launchers and vehicle-mounted 106mm recoilless rifles were employed in the direct fire support role for the first time in Lebanon.O'Ballance, Civil War in Lebanon (1998), p. 37. The operation was led by Ibrahim Kulaylat, the Al-Mourabitoun leader, who planned to occupy the district and inflict a crushing defeat on the Phalangist KRF militia that would eventually force them to sue for peace. On December 8‚Äì9 there was a seesaw, savage close-quarter battle for the Phoenicia Inter-Continental Hotel, and although the Phalangists were eventually forced out from some of the hotel buildings, they managed to hold- on to their main stronghold at the Holiday Inn. However, when the St Georges fell, the NLP Tigers simply withdrew from the seafront district, leaving the fighting to the Phalangists and the other, smaller Christian militias.Jureidini, McLaurin, and Price, Military operations in selected Lebanese built-up areas (1979), p. 6. On that same date, the Lebanese Army came to the aid of the Phalangists by launching an attack on the Phoenicia and St Georges Hotels, which was initially successful in recapturing the Phoenicia Hotel.Jureidini, McLaurin, and Price, Military operations in selected Lebanese built-up areas (1979), p. 5. Kulaylat's operation thus failed to deliver the expected results, and on December 10 it was the Muslims who were trying desperately to hold on at the Alcazar Hotel, even though parts of the building had gone up in flames. Pressured by the joint Army-Christian militias' counter-offensive, Kulaylat called the PLO for help and received it. The Phoenicia and St Georges Hotels changed hands several times during the night. Nevertheless, the Muslim militiamen were able to storm and secure the disputed Phoenicia Inter-Continental Hotel, and the next day they mounted another assault against Christian militia and ISF Gendarmerie positions. While the Christian militiamen repulsed the attacks on their own positions, the Gendarmes avoided confrontation and withdrew to the unfinished Beirut Hilton Hotel. The Al-Mourabitoun were forced out from the St Georges and Alcazar Hotels after a heavy artillery bombardment by the Lebanese Army, supported by the Phalangists. Fighting came to a temporary near-halt on December 12 when the exhausted combatants of both sides realised that they had more or less retained their original positions. Although Prime-Minister Karami had announced another truce two days earlier, it was ignored by the LNM leaders until December 11. However, even on that date fighting continued on the Hotel district as the Muslim-leftists retook the Phoenicia and St Georges Hotels, forced the Lebanese Army out of the area, and launched an unsuccessful assault on the Phalangist-held Holiday Inn.Jureidini, McLaurin, and Price, Military operations in selected Lebanese built-up areas (1979), p. 5. As a result, the ceasefire called earlier on December 10 did not became truly effective until December 15‚Äì16 when Syria, As-Saiqa and the PLO put pressure on the LNM political and military leaders to accept the ceasefire proposal. By nightfall, Lebanese ISF Gendarmerie detachments had replaced Muslim and Christian militiamen in all the hotel positions. A Syrian delegation led by General Hikmat Chehabi arrived in Beirut on December 18 to mediate peace talks between the warring factions, the day in which 40 or 50 bodies were recovered from the Phoenicia Inter-Continental Hotel.O'Ballance, Civil War in Lebanon (1998), p. 39. =January 1976= By late December 1975, fighting in the \\"Hotel front\\" subsided as the main contenders were distracted elsewhere. On January 1, the Christian militias set up a blockade cutting off supplies to the Palestinian refugee camp of Tel al-Zaatar and adjacent Muslim-populated slum districts in East Beirut.http://forum.tayyar.org/f8/facts-ag-tal-el- za3tar-28096/index2.html. The Muslim-leftist LNM militias retaliated on January 5 by launching an offensive in the south-eastern sectors of the Lebanese capital, and by January 10, fighting had spread to the Hotel district as the Phalangists occupied the Holiday Inn and the Muslim-leftists took the Phoenicia. The following day Muslim militiamen moved back to the Murr Tower. No further important changes in real estate control within the Hotel district occurred until the last phase of the battle, though all the contenders managed to maintain their positions thanks to a Syrian-sponsored ceasefire called later on January 22.Jureidini, McLaurin, and Price, Military operations in selected Lebanese built-up areas (1979), p. 6. =March 1976= The Hotel district flared up again on March 17, the day when the LNM-PLO joint forces, backed by the Lebanese Arab Army (LAA) ‚Äì a predominately Muslim splinter faction of the official Lebanese Army led by the dissident Lieutenant Ahmed al-Khatib ‚Äì launched an all-out offensive against rightist positions in central Beirut. Then on March 21, a major assault by special Palestinian PLO 'Commando' units using armored vehicles lent by the LAA and supported by the leftist-Muslim militias ‚Äì including the \\"Maarouf Saad Units and the Determination brigade\\" (Arabic: ŸÖÿπÿ±ŸàŸÅ ŸÖÿπÿ±ŸàŸÅ Ÿàÿ≠ÿØÿßÿ™ ŸàŸÑŸàÿßÿ° ÿ™ŸÇÿ±Ÿäÿ±  Merouf Maeruf Wahadat wa Liwa' Taqrir) from the Al-Mourabitoun ‚Äì finally managed to dislodge the Christian-rightist Kataeb Regulatory Forces (KRF) from the Holiday Inn. However, the leftist militiamen who had been handed the hotel by the Palestinians for propaganda purposes got so carried away celebrating that they did not clear all the hotel rooms, which allowed the Phalangists to sneak back in at dawn the next day and set up an ambush that killed a key Al-Mourabitoun militia commander. The Palestinians therefore had to do the job all over again, and on March 22, leftist-Muslim LNM forces backed by PLO guerrillas mounted a counter-attack in downtown Beirut, determined to eliminate any remaining Phalangist presence west of the Martyrs' Square. Over the next two days and amid intense shelling, the Phalange were gradually pushed back to their defensive positions at Martyrs' Square and Rue Allenby, after a costly battle that resulted in 150 dead and 300 wounded. The following day, March 23, the Al-Mourabitoun recaptured the Holiday Inn and the area known as the \\"4th district\\" (Arabic: ÿßŸÑÿ≠Ÿä ÿßŸÑÿ±ÿßÿ®ÿπ  Al-hayi al-ra'abie) from the Phalangists, which meant that LNM militias now dominated most of the strategic points around central Beirut. That same day marked the beginning of the battle for the Beirut port area when the LNM-PLO forces advanced towards that sector and captured the Starco building. Five days later, on March 28, they seized control of the Hilton and Normandy Hotels.O'Ballance, Civil War in Lebanon (1998), p. 47.Jureidini, McLaurin, and Price, Military operations in selected Lebanese built-up areas (1979), p. 6. The new battle front was established on the axis Starco-Hilton, while Phalangist militiamen faced assaults launched from the Riad El Solh Square and the Nejmeh Square towards the Port area and the Rue de Damas. Although the Christians had virtually lost the control of the Hotel district, it was not quite the end of the fighting in downtown Beirut. As the weeks went by, it was becoming painfully apparent to the Lebanese Front leadership that they were at risk of losing the war as the LNM- PLO-LAA alliance forced them to retreat farther into East Beirut. To counter this threat, the Lebanese Front finally agreed to form a \\"Unified Command\\" (Arabic: ÿßŸÑŸÇŸäÿßÿØÿ© ÿßŸÑŸÖŸàÿ≠ÿØÿ©  Al-Qiadat al-Muahada) for the Christian rightist militias headed by Pierre Gemayel, who issued an appeal to his supporters to rally to the defense of the Christian areas. Thus by March 26, the Kataeb Regulatory Forces alone were able to mobilize some 18,000 fighters to defend the eastern sector of the Lebanese Capital and the upper Matn District. The new Christian Command felt it imperative to retain control of Beirut's port district and began raising an elaborate defence barricade made of concrete and rubble at Rue Allenby. As the allied 'Lebanese Front' militia forces tried to stave off the Muslim-Leftist-Palestinian assault on the port district, units of the predominantly Christian Army of Free Lebanon (AFL) ‚Äì another ex- Lebanese Army dissident faction led by the right-wing Maronite Colonel Antoine Barakat ‚Äì now entered the fray. Officers and enlisted men from the AFL's Fayadieh barracks in south-east Beirut came to the aid of their beleaguered co-religionists, bringing with them much-needed armored vehicles and heavy artillery.O'Ballance, Civil War in Lebanon (1998), pp. 54; 56‚Äì57. During the fighting however, an artillery barrage fired by a unit under Barakat's command accidentally struck the campus of the American University of Beirut (AUB) at Rue Bliss in the neighboring Ras Beirut district, causing a number of casualties among the students. The LNM-PLO advance was finally stopped on March 31 at Rue Allenby, and after Syria threatened to cut the arms shipments to the Muslim factions, both the LNM and Lebanese Front leaders agreed to a ceasefire, which came into effect on April 2.O'Ballance, Civil War in Lebanon (1998), pp. 48‚Äì49. The Battle of the Hotels was over. Consequences In the end, the battle of the hotels and assorted conflicts provided valuable, if costly, lessons to all sides. The Lebanese Front leadership had grossly underestimated the military strength and organizational capabilities displayed by the Leftist-Muslim LNM coalition and their Palestinian PLO allies in Lebanon, as well as the political and logistical support they would receive from some Arab countries. For their part, the Lebanese National Movement leaders had also underestimated the military capabilities and mobilization skills of their Rightist-Christian Lebanese Front alliance adversaries, and the military support that they enjoyed from certain fractions of the Lebanese Army and Israel. Neither side achieved a clear, decisive victory and the ensuing result was stalemate; in fact, the battle of the Hotels only served to complete the division of Beirut into a Muslim-controlled western sector (known as \\"West Beirut\\") and a Christian-dominated eastern sector (known in turn as \\"East Beirut\\") through a demarcation line that eventually became the Green Line, and this partition remained for the following 15 years. In Arts and Popular Culture =Cinema= In Die F√§lschung (1981) (English title: \\"Circle of Deceit\\"), Volker Schl√∂ndorff makes an ambiguous use of the Phoenicia InterContinental Hotel, one of the hotels involved in the battle. Characters seem to be lodging in the hotel while it has already been damaged by the war. In fact, the outside scenes were shot on location, while the interior scenes were done at Casino du Liban. =Visual Arts= Lebanese painter Ayman Baalbaki painted the Holiday Inn Beirut, a landmark of this battle. His Holiday Inn Hotel 'Seeking The Heights‚Äô was sold for $47,500 at a Christie's auction in 2010. Lebanese visual artist and illustrator Lamia Ziad√© exhibited in 2008 Hotel's War, an installation of wool and fabric childlike models of buildings that makes a reference to the Battle of the Hotels. A scale model of the unfinished shell of the Burj al-Murr, a prominent sniper nest during the war, was crafted by Lebanese artist Marwan Rechmaoui. The piece is entitled Monument for the Living and is on display at the Tate Modern museum in London. https://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/rechmaoui-monument-for-the-living-t13193 See also * Hundred Days' War * Internal Security Forces * Lebanese Army * Lebanese Civil War * Lebanese Front * Lebanese National Movement * Le Commodore Hotel Beirut * Mountain War (Lebanon) * Philip Caputo Notes References * Denise Ammoun, Histoire du Liban contemporain: Tome 2 1943‚Äì1990, Fayard, Paris 2005.

Synopsis Filmmaker John J Doherty traces the life and work of the Irish artist, book illustrator and stained glass artist Harry Clarke (1889‚Äì1931) with major contributions from his biographer Nicola Gordon Bowe as well as many stained glass artists, poets and historians. The film takes the artist's work in stained glass, which was mainly religious an ethereal, and in book illustration, which was mainly dark & fantastical, as the basis for its title and tells a story of talent, struggle, success and the censorship of his final masterpiece 'the Geneva Window'. Harry Clarke brought his expertise in working in fine decorative detail in glass to his book illustrations, most notably in the tales of Hans Christian Andersen and Edgar Allan Poe where he is compared to Aubrey Beardsley and which are featured in the film and paralleled with German Expressionist cinema of the time. The film was made in conjunction with the Irish Film Board and national broadcaster TG4. Awards This film won the Best Arts Documentary award at the 2004 Celtic International Film Festival.

Granger grew up in Scooba, Mississippi and attended Kemper County High School (KCHS). He earned First Team All-District, First Team All-State and All-America honors after leading KCHS to the 3-A State Championship. Granger then attended Texas Southern University and became a four-year starter on the varsity basketball team while playing the point guard position. By the time he graduated in 1996 he had established himself as one of the school's all-time leaders in points, assists (467) and steals (146). Granger was named the Southwestern Athletic Conference Freshman of the Year, 1994 SWAC Tournament MVP, and was a two-time First Team All-SWAC and Black College All-American selection. He did not get selected in the 1996 NBA Draft so Granger took his game overseas. In three professional seasons, he played in Cyprus, Argentina (Regatas Corrientes) and Italy (Floor Padova). Upon returning to the United States, Granger became a high school basketball coach and special education teacher at Worthing High School in Houston, Texas. He left the school to become an assistant coach at his alma mater with the promise of becoming the new head coach once interim coach Robert Moreland resigned. Granger and TSU had entered a gentleman's agreement, but once TSU's old athletic director was fired by the school president, he was never given the opportunity to become the head coach and filed a lawsuit in response. Granger married his college sweetheart, Tracy, who was also a Texas Southern cheerleader, and they have four children together.

Life He was the son of William Clayton, bookseller, of Manchester, and was born 9 October 1709. He was educated at Manchester Grammar School, and gained the school exhibition to Brasenose College, Oxford, in 1725. In 1729 the Hulmean scholarship was awarded to him, and a little later he became a college tutor. He proceeded B.A. on 16 April 1729, and M.A. on 8 June 1732. One of his early friends was John Byrom, his fellow-townsman, and at Oxford he knew John and Charles Wesley, James Hervey, Benjamin Ingham, and other pious young collegians, who formed the little society of 'Oxford Methodists.' Fasting, almsgiving, and the visitation of the sick were among the main objects of the friends, and the influence of Clayton's devotional spirit and earnest churchmanship was felt in the little community. He left Oxford in 1732, and was ordained deacon at Chester on 29 December of that year. His first cure was that of Sacred Trinity Chapel in Salford. His house became the resort of John Wesley and others of the Oxford society whenever they came to Manchester, and Wesley on several occasions preached from his pulpit. George Whitefield also delivered one of his stirring addresses in Clayton's chapel. When Wesley was contemplating his mission to Georgia, he visited Manchester to take the opinions of Clayton and Byrom. Clayton acted as chaplain to Darcy Lever, LL.D., high sheriff of Lancashire in 1736, and published the assize sermon which he preached at Lancaster in that year. On 6 March 1740 he was elected one of the chaplains of the Manchester Collegiate Church, and twenty years later (28 June 1760) was appointed a fellow there. His high-church practices and strongly pronounced Jacobite views proved very obnoxious to the Whig party of the neighbourhood. He was attacked in a pamphlet by Thomas Percival of Royton, and subsequently by Josiah Owen, presbyterian minister of Rochdale, and John Collier, otherwise known as 'Tim Bobbin.' When the Young Pretender visited Manchester in 1745, Clayton publicly advocated his claims, and offered up prayer in the collegiate church for the deposed royal family. Afterwards Clayton had to suffer: he was obliged to conceal himself, and was suspended from his office for violating his ordination vow, and for acting as one disaffected towards the Protestant succession. He was reinstated when a general amnesty towards the adherents of the Prince was proclaimed. In Chetham's Hospital and Library at Manchester he took considerable interest, and in 1764 was elected a feoffee of that foundation. Clayton died on 25 September 1773, aged 64, and was interred in the Derby chapel of the Manchester Collegiate Church (now cathedral). His wife was Mary, daughter of William Dawson of Manchester. She appears to have died young. Legacy For many years Clayton ran an academy at Salford, and his pupils after his death formed themselves into a society called the Cyprianites, and at their first meeting decided to erect a monument to his memory in Manchester Cathedral. For school use he published in 1754 Anacreontis et Sapphonis Carmina, cum virorum doctorum notis et emendationibus. A library of 6000 books, collected by Clayton, was attached to this school: it was dispersed in 1773. In 1755 he published a short volume entitled Friendly Advice to the Poor; written and published at the request of the late and present Officers of the Town of Manchester, in which he wrote about the poorer inhabitants of the town. It was replied to in the following year in a jocular and sarcastic manner in A Sequel to the Friendly Advice to the Poor of Manchester. By Joseph Stot, Cobbler. The real author was Robert Whitworth, printer and bookseller.

The species was described by French zoologist Alphone Guichenot in 1855.http://reptile- database.reptarium.cz/species.php?genus=Uracentron&species;=flaviceps, The Reptile Database - Uracentron Flaviceps They are considered to be ant specialists and exhibit communal nesting and a harem-style breeding system in which one male mates with and attends to multiple females. Study of this species has been impeded by difficulties collecting and observing them. Taxonomy The species was originally named Doryphorus flaviceps by Guichenot in 1855. Since its original identification, the species has undergone a number of taxonomic changes. In 1881, it was renamed Uranocentrum flaviceps by O'Shaughnessy. This change did not last very long and the name was changed to Urocentron castor in 1885. Only minor taxonomic changes were made after 1885, until a change to U. flaviceps in 1925. This name lasted until 1992, when Darrel R. Frost renamed the species Tropidurus flaviceps. The name switched between T. flaviceps and U. flaviceps until 2003, when the genus Tropidurus was split into several genera and the tropical thornytail iguana was assigned to Uracentron.http://junglephotos.com/amazon/amanimals/amreptiles/thorniguananathist.shtml, Thorntail Iguana Natural History Distribution The species has been noted in the lowlands of eastern Ecuador, eastern Peru, northwestern Brazil, and the extreme southern regions of Colombia; they may be found in Bolivia, as well. Female or juvenile Habitat Tropical thornytail iguanas are only found in the Amazon Rainforest, and within it are generally found in lowland tropical rainforest; usually areas with lagoons, rivers, streams, and palm swamps. They are an arboreal species, spending the majority of their lives in high treetops. They prefer trees with high horizontal branches that allow for basking in the sun during the morning hours, and are almost only found in trees that contain hollow areas accessible through entrances in the tree branches and trunks. No specific species of tree has been found to be favored by the lizards; apparently the tree structure, rather than the species, determines what the lizards prefer. Physical description Males can reach up to in snout‚Äìvent length, while the smaller females only reach .Avila-Pires (1995). Lizards of Brazilian Amazonia (Reptilia: Squamata). Zoologische Verhandelingen 299(1): 1-706 They have a large, flat tail covered in scales that ends in a point; the function of these scales is currently unclear. The body is brown in color, speckled with yellow or gold spots. Some specimens found in Ecuador and Peru were noted as having a black collar around their necks. This collar is bordered by narrow, light-colored edges. =Sexual dimorphism= Example of a sexually mature male Sexually mature males differ from females and juveniles in appearance, and this may be the result of sexual selection. The males have longer and deeper heads, and longer limbs when compared to females. Females are also generally a little bit shorter in length than males. Sexually mature males also display different coloration from females or juveniles. They have orange heads and black bodies, in contrast to the much more subdued coloring and yellow heads of females, juveniles, and immature males. Males that reach sexual maturity also have enlarged testes when compared to those of males that have not done so. Feeding and diet Tropical thornytail iguanas are considered a sit-and-wait, or ambush predator. They are considered ant specialists, and various species of ants that wander the limbs and trunks of the trees inhabited by tropical thornytail iguanas make up a large percentage of their diet. Larger lizards eat slightly larger prey, such as stingless bees, true bugs, and beetles. Alates, which have been established as a prey item of the tropical thornytail iguana are not usually present on the limbs and trunks of trees. The lizards possibly break into the alate nests in the trees, or they may only eat the species when releases occur. Breaking into the nests a highly unusual behavior, as rarely does an ambush predator actively seek its prey. In studies investigating the eating behaviors of this species, no difference was found in the amount of prey consumed between male and female specimens. This indicates that resource partitioning is not the reason for the difference in head size between and male and female tropical thornytail iguanas. Behavior The species is diurnal, active during the daytime. The level of activity exhibited is at least partially dependent on the presence of sunlight. Individuals emerge once the sun comes out, and remain active unless cloud cover reduces sunlight. The rough times of activity are from 8:30 am until 5:00 pm, and males appear to emerge from holes in trees earlier than females and juveniles. Upon emerging from the trees, lizards bask in the sun to raise their body temperature until sufficient heat is absorbed. When approached by humans or startled, the lizards either run into their holes to hide or run out on limbs of the tree to avoid danger. Social structure Sexually mature male and a female or juvenile The tropical thornytail iguana has a resource-defense polygyny social structure with one sexually mature male to a group of females and juveniles of varied stages. Resource-defense polygyny means the females do not necessarily live in extremely close quarters, but the resources the females need are clustered together. This creates a group of females, and the resources they need, that a male can claim as his territory. This allows the male to be polygynous with minimal effort defending a resource-based territory.Alcock, John. 1998. Animal Behavior. Sixth Edition. 429-519http://faculty.vassar.edu/suter/1websites/bejohns/mateselection/files/polygyny.htm, Polygyny In the case of tropical thornytail iguanas, usually one group of lizards occurs per tree with one dominant male. In the few cases where two large adult males are found per tree, the older male took the dominant role and displayed the orange head and black body of a sexually mature male, whereas the other male displayed the coloration patterns of an adult female. The lack of coloration shown by the younger male may be because the presence of a large old male suppresses the reproductive receptivity of the younger male. In cases where only one lizard is in a tree, it is generally a male. Reproduction The breeding season for this species appears to be extended, based on observations of juveniles of different sizes in a single tree. During the breeding season, males become more territorial and engage in displays of head bobbing and body movements to warn away other males that may try to infringe on their territories. These displays are also used to attract potential mates. Like most reptiles, tropical thornytail iguanas are oviparous and lay clutches of eggs. For this species, clutches are usually two eggs per female, and clutches of one egg are very rare. The eggs are laid in nests deep within the holes of trees inhabited by a group of tropical thornytail iguanas. Conservation The conservation status of the tropical thornytail iguana is currently uncertain, but the loss of the species' preferred habitat to deforestation could be the main threat to the species.

Nycticebus linglom is a fossil strepsirrhine primate from the Miocene of Thailand. Known only from a single tooth, an upper third molar, it is thought to be related to the living slow lorises (genus Nycticebus), but the material is not sufficient to assign the species to Nycticebus with certainty, and the species name therefore uses open nomenclature. With a width of 1.82 mm, this tooth is very small for a primate. It is triangular in shape, supported by a single root, and shows three main cusps, in addition to various crests. The absence of a fourth cusp, the hypocone, distinguishes it from various other prosimian primates. Taxonomy ? Nycticebus linglom was described in 1997 by French paleontologists Pierre Mein and L√©onard Ginsburg in a report on the fossil mammals of Li Mae Long, a Miocene site in Thailand.Mein and Ginsburg, 1997, p. 805 The animal is known from a single tooth, and on the basis of comparisons with other prosimian primates Mein and Ginsburg concluded that it is most closely related to the living slow lorises (genus Nycticebus). However, in view of the very limited material, they only tentatively assigned the fossil species to Nycticebus, using open nomenclature.Mein and Ginsburg, 1997, p. 806 The specific name, linglom, is the Thai word for \\"loris\\". Description The single known tooth, a third upper molar (M3) known as T Li 41, is tiny, with a length of 1.29 mm and width of 1.82 mm. Mein and Ginsburg claim that it is the smallest known prosimian molar. The tooth is triangular in shape and shows a simple, reduced morphology. Three important cusps‚Äîthe protocone, paracone, and metacone‚Äîare present, connected by a crest. They are low and rounded. The metacone, located at the back of the tooth, is closer to the protocone, which is on the front lingual corner (the side of the tongue), than it is to the paracone on the front labial corner (the side of the cheeks). The protocone is rounded on the lingual side and is attached to a weak crest on the front and back. On the front labial corner, a lengthy crest, the parastylar crest, is present, which includes a minor cusp known as a parastyle. Some wear is visible on the parastylar crest, and at the front of the tooth where a contact facet with the preceding second upper molar is present. The tooth has a single, well-developed root, which contains a number of grooves, suggesting that it consists of three smaller, fused rootlets. ? Nycticebus linglom is much smaller than the fossil sivaladapinae primates, and unlike tarsier M3s, the single known fossil is reduced in form and lacks a fourth main cusp, a hypocone. With its reduced, triangular form, it more closely resembles lorises (family Lorisidae), but the absence of a hypocone also distinguishes it from the slender lorises (Loris), the angwantibos (Arctocebus), and the pygmy slow loris (Nycticebus pygmaeus). The fossil genus Nycticeboides lacks the rounded lingual face of the protocone seen in ? N. linglom and possesses additional cuspules. However, ? N. linglom strongly resembles the Bengal slow loris (Nycticebus bengalensis), from which it is distinguished by its smaller size and fused roots. Range and ecology Li Mae Long, the collection site of ? N. linglom, is dated to the latest Early Miocene, corresponding to the European zone MN 4, around 18 mya.Mein and Ginsburg, 1997, p. 783 It is in the Thai province of Lamphun. The fossil fauna encompasses 34 species of mammals,Mein and Ginsburg, 1997, pp. 784‚Äì785 including the tarsier Tarsius thailandica and the treeshrew Tupaia miocenica. Mein and Ginsburg conclude that the fauna represents a tropical forest environment close to a shallow lake.Mein and Ginsburg, 1997, p. 784 References Literature cited *Mein, P. and Ginsburg, L. 1997.

She was one of the early members of the Women's Engineering Society, and its president in 1931.Profile , steminist.com; accessed 24 February 2013. She was the first practising engineer to serve as president of the society. Early life She was born at Highworth, Ashford, Kent to Florence Mary Holmes (n√©e Syme) (d. 1927), and Edmond Gore Alexander Holmes, chief inspector of elementary schools for England. She was one of three children, her brother Maurice Gerald Holmes (1885‚Äì1964) became a leading British civil servant. Her sister Florence Ruth Holmes (1881-1969) was a writer. Holmes was educated at Oxford High School for Girls, and after leaving school worked briefly as a photographer before the outbreak of the First World War enabled her to start working at the Integral Propeller Company, Hendon, on the manufacture of wooden propellers. While working, Holmes attended night classes at Shoreditch Technical Institute She then moved to Lincoln to work for the industrial engine manufacturer Ruston and Hornsby, where she started as a supervisor for women employees. Due to the relaxation of working conditions in wartime, she was able to complete an apprenticeship at the company and by 1919 was working in the drawing office. Unlike most of her contemporaries, she continued to be employed by the company after the end of the war. As when she was working in Hendon, Holmes attended technical classes at a local technical college. In 1922, Holmes graduated from Loughborough Engineering College with a BSc(Eng) degree. Her fellow students at Loughborough included the engineer and international traveller Claudia Parsons. Professional career Her technical specialities included marine and locomotive engines, diesel and internal combustion engines. She became an associate member of the Institution of Marine Engineers in 1924 and was the first woman to be admitted to the Institution of Locomotive Engineers in 1931. In 1925, Holmes set up her own consulting company. Holmes patented a number of inventions, including the Holmes and Wingfield pneumo-thorax apparatus for treating patients with tuberculosis, a surgeon's headlamp, a poppet valve for steam locomotives, and rotary valves for internal combustion engines. She held patents for twelve inventions for medical devices as well as engine components.. From 1928-1931 she worked at the North British Locomotive Works, Glasgow, and from 1931-1939 at Research Engineers Ltd. During World War II Holmes worked on naval weaponry and in 1940 became adviser to Ernest Bevin, the minister of labour, on the training of munition workers. She was appointed headquarters technical officer with the Ministry of Labour (1940-1944). Support for women's engineering Together with Caroline Haslett and Claudia Parsons, Holmes was active in the Women's Engineering Society (WES), founded in 1919. She served that society in several capacities, including president in 1930 and 1931 and was involved in the complex discussions about the organisation's direction of travel which led to the resignation of the second president Katharine Parsons in 1925. She was a delegate at first International Conference of Women in Science, Industry and Commerce in July 1925. Her work in support of women in engineering was based partly upon her own experiences; although she had been admitted to the Institution of Mechanical Engineers as an associate member in 1924, it took twenty years for her to be admitted as a full member. In 1946 Holmes founded the engineering firm of Holmes and Leather in Gillingham, Kent, with Sheila Leather a fellow WES member and future President (1950‚Äì1951). They employed only women. Using a design created by Holmes, this firm created the first practical safety guillotine for paper, making it suitable for introduction into schools. In 1951 whilst also Managing Director of Holmes and Leather, Holmes took an additional part-time appointment as Technical Director of Calnorth Ltd., Engineers, of Marlborough St, London. In 1955 the Women's Engineering Society published a booklet compiled by Holmes, Training and Opportunities for Women in Engineering, which was revised by Holmes and Lesley S. Souter in 1958. She was influential in setting up the Women's Technical Services Register during the Second World War, which included a training course for women munitions workers to enable them to apply for roles such as junior draughtsmen and laboratory assistants. From 1969, the Women's Engineering Society supported a yearly Verena Holmes lecture, given at various venues across Britain to children aged nine to eleven to encourage interest in engineering Women's Engineering Society: Role Models; accessed 24 February 2013]Verena Holmes Lecture, wes.org.uk; accessed 22 June 2015. . The lecture series ran for many years until the lecture fund was wound up in 2009. The Institute of Mechanical Engineers now has a Verena Winifred Holmes award first awarded in 2015. Verena Holmes' birthday of 23 June coincides with International Women in Engineering Day and she is commemorated as part of that celebration.

Paterwic, Historical Dictionary of the Shakers (Lanham, Md.: Scarecrow Press, 2008), 250-51. At that time, a woman's leadership of a religious sect was a radical departure from Protestant Christianity.Catherine A. Brekus, Strangers and Pilgrims: Female Preaching in America, 1740‚Äì1845 (Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 1998). Childhood Lucy Wright was born February 5, 1760, the daughter of John and Mary (Robbins) Wright of Pontoosuck plantation (later Pittsfield, Massachusetts), in the Housatonic River valley of the Berkshire hills near the New York border.Frederic W. Evans, Compendium of the origin, history, principles, rules and regulations, government, and doctrines of the United society of believers in Christ's second appearing (for the Shakers, 1859), 184. At that time, Pontoosuck plantation was a frontier settlement, which was reached via path- like roads. Aside from Jonathan Edwards‚Äô Indian mission in Stockbridge, the area had no church until Wright was almost thirteen.Glendyne R. Wergland, Sisters in the Faith: Shaker Women and Equality of the Sexes (Amherst: University of Massachusetts Press, 2011), chapter 2. Wright was considered an attractive woman and a leader.Anna White and Leila S. Taylor, Shakerism: Its Meaning and Message (Columbus, Ohio: Shakers, 1905), 106. With Elizur Goodrich, she attended the New Light Baptist revival at New Lebanon, New York in 1779. Near the end of the revival, they heard a preacher expound on Romans 8:8 (‚ÄúThose who are in the flesh cannot please God‚Äù), which may have set the stage for their conversion to a new religion.Wergland, Sisters in the Faith, chapter 2. Marriage Lucy Wright married Elizur Goodrich on December 15, 1779. By mid-1780, Elizur Goodrich was drawn to the preachings of the Shaker leader, Mother Ann Lee, despite the new religion's requirements of celibacy and confession of sins. His bride, however, was reluctant to convert.White and Taylor, Shakerism: Its Meaning and Message, p. 107. Thus Elizur Goodrich and his wife Lucy lived ‚Äúuncommonly continent‚Äù.Wergland, Sisters in the Faith, chapter 2. Goodrich and twenty members of his extended family joined the Shakers. After several months of deliberation, Wright resumed her maiden name and replaced her marriage with a commitment to Shakerism, living apart from her husband, who became an itinerant Shaker preacher. Within a decade Wright rose to leadership within the Shaker sect, with the power and authority which women were not allowed in other religions.Wergland, Sisters in the Faith, chapter 2. Life as a Shaker As soon as Wright shifted her commitment from her husband to her new religion, Mother Ann Lee found it expedient to separate the young couple. She sent Goodrich on the road as an itinerant preacher and missionary. Wright moved to the Shaker community at Watervliet, New York, where Ann Lee mentored the young woman and she became a leader among her peers.Wergland, Sisters in the Faith, chapter 2. Ann Lee died in 1784. By late 1788, the society‚Äôs new leader Joseph Meacham had had a revelation that Shakers should practice equality of the sexes, or gender equality. He summoned Wright to New Lebanon, New York, and named her his female counterpart in leadership. Together, Meacham and Wright reshaped their religious society to include gender-balanced government, and gathering Believers into communal villages.Wergland, Sisters in the Faith, chapter 2. Lucy Wright worked with Joseph Meacham until he died in 1796. After his death, Wright was the acknowledged leader of the Shaker ministry (a team of two elders and two eldresses who governed the society).Wergland, Sisters in the Faith, chapter 2. Wright proved to be a good administrator. She survived the exit of disaffected young men in the 1790s and sustained ‚Äúpetticoat government‚Äù for 25 years.Jean Humez, ‚ÄúWeary of Petticoat Government‚Äù: The Specter of Female Rule in Early Nineteenth-Century Shaker Politics,‚Äù Communal Societies 11 (1991): 1-17. Her long tenure as the Ministry‚Äôs leader meant that she had ample opportunity to establish the principles of gender equality, and her leadership set an example for equality of the sexes.Wergland, Sisters in the Faith, chapter 11. Wright sent missionaries to preach across New England and upstate New York. After hearing of revivals at Cane Ridge, Kentucky during the Second Great Awakening, she sent missionaries into the western wilderness, where they recruited proselytes and established new Shaker villages in Kentucky, Ohio, and Indiana.White and Taylor, Shakerism: Its Meaning and Message; Carol Medlicott, ‚ÄúNow By My Motion‚Äù: The Life Journey of Issachar Bates, Soldier, Preacher, and Shaker on the American Frontier (Hanover, N.H.: University Press of New England, 2013). Under Wright's administration, Shakers standardized and increased book and tract publishing for the widely-scattered religious society. Their first statement of beliefs was Testimony of Christ‚Äôs Second Appearing in 1810, followed by a hymnal which served much the same purpose in 1813.David Darrow, John Meacham, and Benjamin Seth Youngs, Testimony of Christ‚Äôs Second Appearing (Albany, N.Y.: Hosford, 1810); Millennial Praises: containing a collection of gospel hymns, in four parts, adapted to the day of Christ's second appearing, Seth Youngs Wells, comp. (Hancock, [Mass.]: Josiah Tallcott, Jr., 1813). See also Millennial Praises: A Shaker Hymnal, Christian Goodwillie and Jane Crosthwaite, eds. (Amherst, Mass.: University of Massachusetts Press, 2009). Lucy Wright preached union among her followers. One of her sayings was, \\"There is a daily duty to do; that is, for the Brethren to be kind to the Brethren, Sisters kind to the Sisters, and the Brethren and Sisters kind to each other.\\"Mother Lucy‚Äôs Sayings, Sister Frances A. Carr, ed., (Poland Spring, Me.: United Society of Shakers, 1989), 105. She died in 1821.Paterwic p. 251. Her grave is beside that of Mother Ann Lee, in the Shaker cemetery in the Watervliet Shaker Historic District, now the town of Colonie, New York. After Lucy Wright's death, some Shakers evidently questioned Shaker sisters' equality to Shaker brethren; they must have thought that Wright alone had maintained equality of the sexes. Nevertheless, her successors made sure that equal rights did not end with her demise. A New Lebanon Elder said, ‚ÄúMother Lucy‚Äôs work was to establish and support an equ[ality] in the Church between brethren and sisters,‚Äù and he expected the believers to support it. He assured the sisters ‚Äúthat they have the same right as ever they had when Mother was with us, the[y] must not be deprived of their lo[t] & equality in the gospel .... It is in the perfect union between the two that we shall find our relation in the kingdom.‚ÄùWergland, Sisters in the Faith, p. 165.

Geography Elisabethpol Governorate consisted of Yelizavetpolsky, Nukhisky, Shusha, Zangezur, Kazakh, Aresh, Dzhebrailsky and Dzhevanshirsky Uyezds Javanshir Uyezd was made up of two parts: the northeastern lowland and southwestern mountainous part of Jraberd. The area covered 4,818.4 square verst. The lower part, called Arran was hot and dry during summers which made the inhabitants move to mountainous areas for the duration of season.

After the Russian Empire ceased to exist and Azerbaijan Democratic Republic was founded in 1918, Shusha, Javanshir, Jabrayil and Zangezur uyezds became a part of Azerbaijani- Armenian territorial disputes. In August 1919, as a result of a provisional accord Shusha, Javanshir, Jabrayil were placed under Azerbaijani Governor- Generalship of Khosrov bey Sultanov by the British command. Population According to census held in 1897, the population of uyezd was 72,719, of which 52,041 were Azerbaijani Turks and 19,551 were Armenians. The uyezd has 213 villages and its population was engaged primarily in agriculture and cattlebreeding with the population in lowland part of uyezd engaged in sericulture and gardening. The mountainous parts above wooden mountains were used as mountain pastures, the lower regions of the highland were cultivated for growing barley and wheat. The lowland area was used for growing cotton, rice and other various plants. The agricultural data from 1891 states the cattle stock numbered 52,800 while small cattle numbered 112,000. There were 34 factories with a total production output accounting to 37,914 rubles.

He came from a culture-loving family with deep rooted patriotic traditions. Being brought up in the Totaj family from his mother's side, Godo spent his youth in a literary and patriotic environment. Early life and education Godo attended primary school in the city of his birth, Delvina, south Albania. Then he transferred to Tirana for high school, which was forced to interrupt during the third year after being actively involved in the anti-fascist war. For 23 months, from July 1943 to May 1945, Godo was part of the 6th Brigade and took part in all of its battles throughout Albania and Yugoslavia, where he was awarded for remarkable bravery. He served as an officer in the army until 1948 and then was dismissed as \\"politically unwanted\\". In 1953 expelled from the communist party, which had joined in February 1944. With the expulsion begins his cavalcade through the years of the dictatorship. Because of the marriage with a girl from an aristocratic family (Vrioni) and his belonging to a family of intellectuals, opponents of the regime, who were shot, imprisoned and/or in exile, his life was multiple times of the razor's edge, up to the verge of incarceration. Literary career Godo is known as a \\"rare pen\\", with historical novels, the most sensational and discussed are Sk√´nderbeu and Ali Pash√´ Tepelena. He never stopped researching and rewriting these figures that exceeded the size of the nation. These critically acclaimed novels have been translated into several languages and reprinted and revised several times. As a connoisseur of the human character, he wrote novels and short stories about the war. The works suffered a hard censorship and the regime accused him of depicting the war in a non-heroic way. In 1974 he was expelled from the \\"League of Writers\\" for \\"deviations from socialist realism\\" and sent to \\"reeducation\\" for 11 years (1974-1985). Godo had an intense activity in journalism, particularly in the journal \\"Hosteni\\", with over four thousand published pages with critical articles and editorials. Political career In the 1990s, he was involved from the beginning in the anti-communist movement and on January 10, 1990, formed the Republican Party of Albania, (PR) a right-wing party, allied with the Democratic Party. PR had underlying in its program the respect for private property, family, and the nation's unification. For eight years, Godo was chairman of the party, to resign later, paving the way for the young people. From 1998 until his last days, he was Honorary President and Chairman of the National Assembly of PR. Sabri Godo was a Member of the Albanian Parliament in two legislatures, (1996-2002) simultaneously holding the position of the Chair of the Foreign Affairs Committee. During this period and later, he played an active role in the intensification of Albanian relationships with European structures and other countries, extending his recognition to the highest levels of important political personalities. Godo's role in resolving the Kosovo issue, for which he fought for 22 consecutive years, from the first day of the Republican Party establishment until the last days of his life, is undeniable. For this, the people and personalities in Kosovo have explicitly expressed their gratitude. It is known his role and struggles for the cause of the Cham Albanians, for the Albanians in Macedonia, Serbia and elsewhere. Godo played a crucial role as co-chairman in drafting the New Constitution of the Republic of Albania in 1998. Often referred to, as \\"Father of the Constitution\\". He was one of the most important figures in Albanian political life, especially in difficult moments. His unwavering stance in the most sensitive and controversial causes, during heated political terms, and his constant efforts to find the path of reason, brought the people, media, and politicians to call him \\"the wise old Godo\\". \\" Death Godo died after battling pulmonary cancer on 3 December 2011. He was buried in Tufine, Tirana, the following day. The government decided to make the following day a National mourning day, with flags flying at half-mast, from 12.30 to 14.30.

As a research student she was taught by Hyman Minsky (among others), although her interest in Keynes and his General Theory developed much later. After further study at the London School of Economics, in 1963 she secured a post at University College London where she remained for the rest of her career, being appointed to a Chair in 1993. At UCL her interests shifted from international economics to monetary theory and macroeconomics. Her first major book, The Theory of Monetary Policy (1973), was a critical evaluation of both the Keynesian and monetarist approaches to macroeconomics that were dominant of the time. In 1971 she was present at Joan Robinson's Ely Lecture to the American Economic Association, titled The Second Crisis in Economics, and at the meeting called by Joan Robinson and Paul Davidson which gave conscious expression to what became the Post Keynesian school of thought. At this point Chick returned to The General Theory and wrote a critique of Clower and Leijonhufvud's reappraisal (Leijonhufvud, 1968) of the Economics of Keynes, leading eventually to her magnum opus Macroeconomics After Keynes (1983).

(11 February 1557 ‚Äì 4 September 1644) was a Dutch Protestant minister, a leader of the Remonstrants. 1633 portrait of Johannes Wtenbogaert by Rembrandt. Life Born at Utrecht, he was brought up a Roman Catholic, and attended the school of St. Jerome there. He intended a legal career, but gave it up from 1578 with Catholicism when required to cease hearing the sermons of the evangelical Huibert Duifhuis (1531‚Äì1581). He went to Arnhem and the service of Count John of Nassau, and then returned to Utrecht to become a pastor. He found conflict between Duifhuis and a group of Calvinists called Consistorials. In 1580 Wtenbogaert was sent at the city's expense to study theology in Geneva and came into contact with Theodore Beza; but his sympathies were with Jacobus Arminius. On his return to Utrecht in 1584 he found himself in an awkward position in the continuing discord. Eventually in 1590 the magistrates removed the preachers from both sides. He then went to The Hague, invited by Maurice of Nassau, and the Walloon congregation there, in 1591. He was in favour, and also attracted the attention of Johan van Oldenbarnevelt. Influential, he became the leader of the Arminian party of Remonstrants, after the death of Arminius in 1609; in fact the name was taken from the Remonstrance of 14 January 1610 to the States of Holland, masterminded by Wtenbogaert and Oldenbarnevelt. At the same time Wtenbogaert published his Tractaet, causing a controversy and, despite the conferences of 1611 and 1613, an effective schism with the Calvinist or Gomarist Counter-Remonstrant party. Prince Maurice removed support from Wtenbogaert, and in 1617 the States decided for a synod, against the wish of the Remonstrants. Wtenbogaert lost heart in March 1618, and asked to be relieved of his charge; and when on August 29, 1618, Oldenbarnevelt, Hugo Grotius, and Rombout Hogerbeets were arrested, Wtenbogaert fled to Rotterdam and then to Antwerp. On May 24, 1619, he was banned from the Dutch Republic and his goods confiscated, the reason given being that he had introduced new views, contrary to the accepted Reformed theology. In October he sent a document to Prince Maurice in his defense, and continued to direct the affairs of the Remonstrants. In October 1621, he moved to Rouen. When Maurice died in 1625, and was succeeded as stadtholder by Wtenbogaert's pupil Frederick Henry, Prince of Orange, Wtenbogaert returned in September 1626. But Frederick Henry would not openly support the Remonstrants, though he granted protection to his old teacher. Wtenbogaert began to preach quietly at The Hague, and regained possession of his house. For the rest of his life he worked for his cause by his writings and by personal efforts. In particular he wrote an autobiography and a work of church history. He died at The Hague in 1644.

Initially there was strong support for such a society and by 30 September 1911 there were 239 members (192 original and a net 47 added during the first session). The society was run along similar lines to the British Astronomical Association. Sections were formed for general observation, meteors, Earth‚Äôs Moon and variable stars, experts were appointed to advise on instrumental matters and photography. A Library was established. The society was based in Calcutta and nearby Barrackpore. Sidney Gerald Burrard and John Evershed were Vice Presidents.

Smith, architect, 1910) The State Library of Iowa is a library service in the American state of Iowa. Founded around 1840, it is based in Des Moines and is run by the Iowa Department of Education. The State Library supports local libraries in the state and itself acts as a resource for the state government and its citizens. History The first legislative assembly of the Territory of Iowa convened at Burlington on November 12, 1838. In his first message to this assembly on November 12, 1838, Governor Robert Lucas referred to a library, reporting that prior to leaving Ohio, and with the assistance of several library friends, he had made a catalogue of standard works he deemed as most important as the foundation of a library, and had commissioned an agent in Cincinnati to purchase the books. This having been done and the books expected in a short time, he recommended to the assembly the appointment of a librarian, defining his duties, who should be custodian of the library. The second legislative assembly of 1840 passed an Act for the appointment of a librarian and defined his duties. The library was open every day during the sessions of the legislature and Supreme Court and for four hours on Wednesday and Saturday afternoons the remainder of the year. The library was moved to the new Capitol in Iowa City in 1857. In January 1894, the library was moved to its new quarters in the west wing of the new capitol building in Des Moines. The new library was an addition of true architectural beauty to the new capitol. Its four galleries were reached by winding stairs at either end of the room. It was furnished in ash and chestnut, with marble wainscoting and pilasters, and had an encaustic tile floor. This original state library is still occupied by the state law library and its architectural beauty is admired by thousands of tourists each year. While the legal materials remained in the capitol, in 1857 the rest of the state library‚Äôs collections were moved to the west wing of the new State Historical, Memorial and Art Building. The State Library moved to the east wing of the building in 1912 where it remains today. A total renovation of the building meant to bring back the original colors and design features began in 1999 and ended in 2001. The original mission of the State Library was to provide services to state government. Over the years, this mission grew to include the planning and development of library services on a statewide basis. Today, the State Library, a division of the Iowa Department of Education, offers a multitude of services and programs to the libraries and citizens of Iowa.

It is situated in the Southern District of Botswana. It lies between the coordinates 25¬∞24'23S and 25¬∞32'27E. It is situated between the villages of Gathwane, Pitsane, Kgoro and Digawana. Lejwana is about 30 km from Lobatse and about 100 km by road from the capital Gaborone. Political Leadership The MP is Mr. Alfred Madigele who is also the Assistant Minister of Health in the Current Cabinet, and the councillor is Mr Beach Mooketsane. Lejwana also has a Village Development Committee(VDC). There is also the landoverseer, Rre Koogotsitse Mmila, who is a representative elected by the Land Board authorities. As each and every village in Botswana, Lejwana has a member of parliament, who represents the whole of Ngwaketse South and a Councillor for the Digawana Ward, which includes Lejwana. Royalty and History The Kgosi of Lejwana (a small hill) is His Highness Neo Letlhare. The old man, Kgosi Taolelo Letlhare, has retired and handed over to the incumbent, being his son Kgosi Neo Letlhare. Taolelo is the son of Kgethelo, born of Letlhare. Letlhare was sent as a tribal headman of Mongala ward to establish Lejwana in 1902. This was a result of what happened after 'British Bechuanaland' was divided into two in 1895, between a Colony on the south of Molopo and a Protectorate (the modern day Botswana) on the northern side. Kgosi Montshioa of Barolong, along with the then leading Batlhaping Kgosi, Mankurwane, complained of being left out of a protectorate as they preferred to be on the protectorate side. The then High Commissioner, Sir Williams considered their plea and negotiated with Kgosi Bathoen I to give a piece of Bangwaketse Land. Bathoen relented and gave them land between Ramatlabama, Pitsane, Kgoro Hill, Mogobewakgomo, Mokgomane and Phitshane.Hence Good hope was established as a new capital of BaRolong baga Montshioa. Bathoen then took out his trusted men from Kanye to ensure that Batlhaping and Barolong tribes do not settle in the Ngwaketse Homeland. Letlhare was therefore one of the headmen taken out of Kanye and settled in an area then known as GaBatlhaping. Other headmen given the assignment were Makaba in Gathwane, Selerio in Mokgomane and little is known as to who was assigned to settle in Phitshane. All these men were Bathoen's uncles. Kgosi Letlhare arrived with his brother Motseotsile from Kanye and other tribesmen Nkgelepang and Sennye. Letlhare was born of Mmolaatshepe a Mere a Selohilwe a Makaba II a Mongala a Makaba I a Kutwane a Leema I a Ngwaketse a Malope a Masilo a Melore. Letlhare's younger brother, in the junior house, Magogodi, was left to take care of the Mongala kgotla in Kanye. Magogodi had issue, bearing Gaopatwe (recently deceased Chief of Ga-Segwagwa), Ramokhana and others. The prominent royals in the village are the paternal uncles to the Chief, Tika Letlhare, Letlhare Letlhare, Rasaki Letlhare and Letlharenyana Letlhare. Bo-rangwane are those of the house of Waseteke (Letlhare's younger son) being Oboletswe's house, Rabontle's house and Kebalebile's house. Climate The climate of Lejwana is similar to that of the rest of southern Botswana. Winter starts in May and ends in July. The minimum temperature is 4 ¬∞C and the maximum is 24 ¬∞C. The coldest months are June (Seetebosigo, which literally means, do not visit at night) and July. Summer is from August to April (as it is usually called by the local people though there are three seasons within ths time period being spring, summer and autumn), sthe temperatures range from 15 ¬∞C to 31 ¬∞C. This is the period in which it usually rains in Lejwana with the minimum of 5.8mm and the maximum of 143mm depending on the month. Demographics The population of Lejwana city according to the 2001 Central Statistics Office population census was 621. Since this census, the population has increased due to people migrating to the village and the high birth rate and low death rate, thanks to the recent increase in the Botswana life expectancy. Religion Lejwana is a 100% Christian community. There are a few churches, including the Lighthouse Jesus Ministry, which is situated on the outskirts of the village and is currently under construction and the ZCC which is situated near Mount Lejwana. Not all the population go to these churches, as some do not go to church at all, and some go to churches outside the village like those going to IPHC in Lobatse. Education Lejwana has one primary school called Lejwana Primary School which opened its doors to the students around 1984. There is no elementary school and students go to Nthwalang Secondary School in Digawana for junior education and then to either LobSec or GoodHope Senior Secondary School for high school education. Economy Lejwana is a small village with little development, and was rated one of the ten or twenty poorest villages in Botswana in 2015. The people are dependent on farming, with almost each and every household having a piece of land at the back of the house for ploughing (Segotlo, as the local people call it.) There are some farms owned by the 'whites' around the village which employs a number of village residents. Most of the residents live in towns such as Lobatse and Gaborone where they work. Lejwana Village has one shop named Lerothodi General Dealer which has been the core market for the village for many years now. It is owned by the Mahupu family, and there are a number of tuckshops, and a bar which opens during the festive season only.

Life Clayton belonged to a family living at Bush Hill, Edmonton. He was the brother of Samuel Clayton of Old Park, Enfield, and uncle of Nicholas Clayton. He was brought up to be a doctor, and served his time with the surgeon Samuel Sharp; but he did not manage to advance in the medical profession, and took up painting. The form of art he adopted was still life, especially fruit and flower pieces, painting both in oil and water-colours; he occasionally painted landscapes. Clayton exhibited in 1761 and the following years at the Free Society of Artists in the Strand, London, However by 1767 he had become a member of the Incorporated Society of Artists, and was one of those who signed the society's roll declaration on its incorporation by charter in 1765. He continued to exhibit with them. He lived in the Piazza, Covent Garden. In March 1769 a disastrous and extensive fire broke out which destroyed one side of the Piazza, and most of Clayton's best pictures were destroyed in the fire. After this he seems to have given up art, and retired, having married, to his brother's house at Enfield, where he devoted himself to gardening and music. He exhibited again in 1778. Clayton died on 23 June 1800 at Enfield, in his seventy-third year, leaving two sons and one daughter.

Some bacilli now identified as Cl. argentinense were previously classified as either Cl. subterminale, Cl. hastiforme, or Cl. botulinum toxin group G, respectively. Like Cl. botulinum, Cl. argentinense produces botulin, a neurotoxin that causes botulism in susceptible mammals.

Generally, it refers to any intermediate stream used to transfer heat between two streams that are not directly connected for reasons of safety or practicality. It may also be referred to as a run-around loop, a pump-around coil or a liquid coupled heat exchanger.D. A. REAY (1980), A Review of Gas‚ÄìGas Heat Recovery Systems, Heat Recovery Systems, Volume 1, No. 1, Pergamon Press Ltd., pgs 18 ‚Äì 21 Description A typical run-around coil system comprises two or more multi- row finned tube coils connected to each other by a pumped pipework circuit. The pipework is charged with a heat exchange fluid, normally water, which picks up heat from the exhaust air coil and gives up heat to the supply air coil before returning again. Thus heat from the exhaust air stream is transferred through the pipework coil to the circulating fluid, and then from the fluid through the pipework coil to the supply air stream. The use of this system is generally limited to situations where the air streams are separated and no other type of device can be utilised since the heat recovery efficiency is lower than other forms of air-to-air heat recovery. Gross efficiencies are usually in the range of 40 to 50%, but more significantly seasonal efficiencies of this system can be very low, due to the extra electrical energy used by the pumped fluid circuit. The fluid circuit containing the circulating pump also contains an expansion vessel, to accommodate changes in fluid pressure. In addition, there is a fill device to ensure the system remains charged. There are also controls to bypass and shut down the system when not required, and other safety devices. Pipework runs should be as short as possible, and should be sized for low velocities to minimize frictional losses, hence reducing pump energy consumption. It is possible to recover some of this energy in the form of heat given off by the motor if a glandless pump is used, where a water jacket surrounds the motor stator, thus picking up some of its heat. The pumped fluid will have to be protected from freezing, and is normally treated with a glycol based anti-freeze. This also reduces the specific heat capacity of the fluid and increases the viscosity, increasing pump power consumption, further reducing the seasonal efficiency of the device. For example, a 20% glycol mixture will provide protection down to , but will increase system resistance by 15%. For the finned tube coil design, there is a performance maximum corresponding to an eight- or ten-row coil, above this the fan and pump motor energy consumption increases substantially and seasonal efficiency starts to decrease. The main cause of increased energy consumption lies with the fan, for the same face velocity, fewer coil rows will decrease air pressure drop and increase water pressure drop. The total energy consumption will usually be less than that for a greater number of coil rows with higher air pressure drops and lower water pressure drops. Energy transfer process Normally the heat transfer between airstreams provided by the device is termed as 'sensible', which is the exchange of energy, or enthalpy, resulting in a change in temperature of the medium (air in this case), but with no change in moisture content.

(1733?‚Äì1797) was an English presbyterian minister. Life Clayton was the son of Samuel Clayton of Old Park, Enfield, Middlesex, and was born about 1733. He was educated by private teachers at St Albans and Chelmsford, at a dissenting academy in Northampton, and at the University of Glasgow. He was minister from 1759 to 1763 of the Presbyterian chapel at Boston, Lincolnshire From there he was invited in 1763 to the newly built Octagon Chapel, Liverpool; the promoters of this chapel had the plan of introducing a liturgy which dissenters and members of the established church might join in using. The scheme was carried on for thirteen years, but it was not supported by the members of the church who had professed to be dissatisfied with the Book of Common Prayer. The chapel was then sold to a clergyman of the church of England, and Clayton went to the chapel in Benn's Garden, Liverpool, as the colleague of the Rev. Robert Lewin. In the spring of 1781 he was appointed divinity tutor at Warrington Academy, in succession to John Aikin; but it was then in its final years. In 1783 he returned to Liverpool broken in health. While at Warrington, in 1782 he received the degree of D.D. from the University of Edinburgh. From 1785 to 1795 he ministered at the High Pavement Chapel, Nottingham as the colleague of George Walker. He then returned once more to Liverpool, and died there on 20 May 1797, aged 66. He married in 1765 Dorothy, daughter of James Nicholson of Liverpool. Works The sermon with which he concluded the services at the Octagon on 25 February 1776 was published under the title of ‚ÄòThe Importance of Sincerity in Public Worship to Truth, Morals, and Christianity.‚Äô Besides this sermon, he printed one in the same year entitled ‚ÄòThe Minister of the Gospel represented in a sermon on 1 Cor. x. 33‚Äô and another in 1776, on prayer.

The mine is part of the commune of Saint- Pardoux-la-Rivi√®re in the Dordogne. Extracted from the mine was galena, slightly enriched in silver.  Geography  The mine is situated about 1 kilometer north of Neuil, a small hamlet in the commune of Saint-Pardoux-la- Rivi√®re. The main production shaft, at an elevation of 250 meters above sea level, can be reached by following a small valley on the left side of the D 707 Nontron- Thiviers just before arriving at Neuil. The shaft is located on the right-hand side of the small stream; it is fenced in and closed to the public because of its hazardous nature.  Mine works  The partially collapsed main shaft was once 47.50 meters deep and led to three exploitation levels. An additional horizontal access is now flooded. The ore was taken to N√®grecombe, washed and then transported by train (on the now redundant railway line Angoul√™me-Thiviers) to a smeltering plant.  History  The mine was in operation mainly between 1921 and 1928, between 1956 and 1959 and once more between 1976 and 1984. Several hundred tons of ore were mined. The reserves are estimated at several thousand tons.  Geology  The Neuil Mine is emplaced in Neoproterozoic paragneisses of the Variscan basement of the northwestern Massif Central. The in places tightly folded paragneisses strike mainly N 130 and dip 35¬∞ to the northeast. The ore-bearing lodes crosscut the strike of the paragneisses, their orientation varying between N 045 and N 065. Their dip is generally 65¬∞ to the north. The lodes are therefore roughly parallel with the boundary fault of the Massif Central north of Saint-Pardoux- la-Rivi√®re. The lodes of the Neuil Mine are no single occurrence. To the northwest (towards Nontron) several other lodes follow, which were also mined (Le Puy Mine, Cantonnier Lode, Tabataud Quarry among others).  Mineralogy  The central part of the lode consists of a quartz matrix enriched more or less in baryte. The baryte can become very abundant so that it completely replaces the quartz. Abundant fractures cut through the quartz-baryte core. The sulfides galena, sphalerite and marcasite are enclosed within the quartz/baryte. The galena forms mats of octahedral crystals, the sphalerite is dense and anhedral and the marcasite powdery or displays its coxcomb habit. The lodes are mylonitized at the edges; the sulfide mineral aggregates within this zone are sheared. Secondary mineralisations cover the central fracture surfaces and the mylonitic edges. In the core region geodes of quartz and of chalcedony can occur. In the quartz geodes the habit of quartz is hexagonal- pyramidal but can show occasional bipyramids. Druses in baryte can be clad with gypsum. Apple green pyromorphite occurs forming hexagonal prisms. The mineralisation is due to hydrothermal circulation in the temperature range 150 ‚Äì 300 ¬∞C. The ores were deposited in two stages, each with a characteristic paragenesis: a higher temperature stage with galena and quartz and a lower temperature stage with baryte and marcasite. These minerals are accompanied by sphalerite, pyrite and chalcopyrite. The ore therefore belongs to the mineralisation type sphalerite-pyrite-galena-chalcopyrite.  Age  A radiometric lead isotope study on the basement lodes yielded an age of 300 to 250 million years BP (Lougnon, J. et al. 1974). The lodes belong clearly to a late Variscan phase and were definitely formed after the intrusion of the Pi√©gut-Pluviers Granodiorite into the paragneisses during the late Pennsylvanian (elsewhere lodes can be found that also formed within the granodiorite). Yet the metal impregnation is most likely genetically related to the granodiorite.  Conclusion  The spatial arrangement of the lodes points towards local southeasterly extension within the basement rocks. By that time the paragneisses had cooled down to below 300¬∞ C. Additionally the lodes experienced shearing motions as shown be the mylonitized edges. This fact combined with the variations in strike possibly hints at a shear zone oriented southeast: the lodes following N 065 can then be interpreted as antithetic surfaces, whereas the lodes following N 045 are probably R'- Riedel shears. Furthermore the fairly steep northwesterly dip of the lodes hints at a top to the southeast sense of motion (‚Äúbookshelfing‚Äù). The mineralizing hydrothermal solutions most likely came from the Pi√©gut-Pluviers Granodiorite.  Literature  * Guillot, P. - L. et al. Feuille Thiviers. Carte g√©ologique de la France √† 1/50000.

In his own lifetime he was notorious for his unorthodox beliefs, which led his critics to question whether he could properly be called a Christian at all, and at the time of his death he was facing charges of heresy.Clogher clergy and parishes : being an account of the clergy of the Church of Ireland in the Diocese of Clogher, from the earliest period, with historical notices of the several parishes, churches, etc\\" Leslie, J.B. pp18/19: Enniskille; R. H. Ritchie; 1929 James Latham. Life Clayton was born at Dublin in 1695, a descendant of the Claytons of Fulwood, Lancashire, whose estates came to him by inheritance. He was the eldest of eight children of Dr. Robert Clayton, minister of St. Michael's Church, Dublin, and dean of Kildare, and Eleanor, daughter of John Atherton of Busie. Zachary Pearce educated him privately, at Westminster School. Clayton entered Trinity College, Dublin, became B.A. 1714, a fellow the same year, M.A. 1717, LL.D. 1722, and D.D. 1730. He made a tour of Italy and France, and on his father's death in 1728 came into possession of a good estate and married Katherine, daughter of Lord Chief Baron Nehemiah Donnellan and his second wife Martha Ussher. He gave his wife's fortune to her sister Anne (who used it to fund the Donnellan Memorial Lectures at Trinity College), and doubled the bequest, under his father's will, to his own three sisters. A wealthy man, he lived in Dublin in what is now Iveagh House. One of the two houses (No. 80) that make up the current Iveagh House was designed for Clayton by Richard Castle, and built in 1736‚Äì7.Google Books. A gift to a distressed scholar recommended to him by Samuel Clarke brought him Clarke's friendship. Clayton embraced Clarke's Arian doctrines and held to them through life. Queen Caroline, hearing from Clarke of Clayton, had him appointed bishop of Killala and Achonry in 1729‚Äì1730. In 1735 he was translated to the diocese of Cork and Ross, and in 1745 to the diocese of Clogher. In 1752 he was made Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries, having some years before been elected a Fellow of the Royal Society. Last controversies and death Clayton proposed, 2 February 1756, in the Irish House of Lords, that the Athanasian creed and Nicene creed should be removed from the liturgy of the Church of Ireland.His speech, taken down in shorthand, was then published, and passed through several editions (as late as Evesham, 1839, and London, 1839). It is also given in Jared Sparks, Essays and Tracts on Theology, vol. vi. Boston, 1826. Despite the controversy this aroused, no proceedings were taken against him until the publication of the third part of the 'Vindication of ... the Old and New Testament,' Dublin, 1757, when he renewed his attack on the Trinity and advanced doctrines contrary to the Thirty-nine Articles. Horace Walpole said caustically that his Vindication seemed calculated to destroy anyone's faith in the Testaments. The government, by now seriously alarmed by the heterodoxy of Clayton's opinions, ordered that he be prosecuted for heresy: a meeting of Irish prelates was called at the house of the Primate of Ireland, and Clayton was summoned to attend. Before the appointed time he died, on 26 February 1758. Character Horace Walpole, in a satirical sketch of the Bishop's life, attributes his death to panic at the thought of having to defend his religious notions, but acknowledges that he was at least sincere in his beliefs, even if nobody else was able to understand what they were. His wife Katherine Donnellan had a reputation for arrogance: the artist and letter-writer Mary Delaney described her as giving herself \\"the airs of a Queen\\" after her husband was made a bishop. Works His first publication was a letter in the Philosophical Transactions, August 1738. In 1739 he published 'The Bishop of Corke's Letter to his Clergy,' Dublin, and 'A Sermon preached before the Judges of Assize,' Cork, and in 1740 'The Religion of Labour,' Dublin, for the Society for Promoting English Protestant Schools in Ireland. In 1743 he published ' A Replication . . . with the History of Popery,' &c.;, Dublin, directed against the author of 'A Brief Historical Account of the Vaudois.' In 1747 appeared 'The Chronology of the Hebrew Bible vindicated ... to the Death of Moses,' London, pp. 494\\\\. In 1749 he published 'A Dissertation on Prophesy . . . with an explanation of the Revelations of St. John,' Dublin; reprinted London. This work aimed at reconciling the Book of Daniel and the Book of Revelation, and proving that the ruin of popery and the end of the dispersion of the Jews would take place in 2000. Two letters followed, printed separately, then together, 1751, London, 'An Impartial Enquiry into the Time of the Coming of the Messiah.' In 1751 appeared the most notable work written by him (though often asserted to be that of a young clergyman of his diocese), 'Essay on Spirit . . . with some remarks on the Athanasian and Nicene Creeds,' London, 1751. This book, full of Arian doctrine, led to a long controversy. It was attacked by William Jones of Nayland, William Warburton (who described it as 'the rubbish of old heresies'), Nathaniel Lardner, and others. The Duke of Dorset, the lord-lieutenant of Ireland, refused on account of this work to appoint him to the vacant archbishopric of Tuam. Several editions appeared in (1752, 1753, and 1759). In 1752 a work having appeared called 'A Sequel to the Essay on Spirit,' London; Clayton published 'The Genuine Sequel to the Essay,' &c.;, Dublin. His next work was 'A Vindication of the Histories of the Old and New Testament, in answer to the Objections of . . . Bolingbroke,' pt. i., Dublin, 1752. In 1753 he published 'A Journey from Grand Cairo to Mount Sinai, and back again. In Company with some Missionaries de propaganda Fide,' &c.;, translated from a manuscript which had been mentioned by Edward Pococke in his 'Travels.' It included an account of the supposed inscriptions of the Israelites in the Gebel el Mokatab. The work was addressed to the Society of Antiquaries, and the author offered to assist an exploration in Mount Sinai, but the society took no steps in the matter. Edward Wortley Montagu, however, was induced to visit the spot and give an account of the inscriptions. The same year Clayton published 'A Defence of the Essay on Spirit,' London. His next work was 'Some Thoughts on Self-love, Innate Ideas, Freewill,' &c.;, occasioned by David Hume's works, London, 1754. The same year he brought out the second part of the 'Vindication of ... the Old and New Testament,' Dublin. This produced Alexander Catcott's attack on his theories of the earth's form and the deluge. In 1756 appeared 'Letters which passed between . . . the Bishop of Clogher and Mr. William Penn concerning Baptism,' London, in which he asserted the cessation of baptism by the Holy Ghost. Clayton's friend William Bowyer obtained a copy of the correspondence and published it. Thomas Barnard, later bishop of Limerick, who married Clayton's niece, and was his executor, had several of his works in manuscript, but they were not published. He gave copyright of all Clayton's works for England to the printer Bowyer, who issued the three parts of the 'Vindication' and the 'Essay on Spirit,' with additional notes and index to the scripture texts, London, 1759.

Life James Clegg was born at Shawfield in the parish of Rochdale, Lancashire on 26 October 1679 and was educated by Richard Frankland at Rathmell in Yorkshire and, later, by John Chorlton at Manchester. In 1702 he settled as minister of a Congregational chapel at Malcalf or Malcoffe in Derbyshire, in succession to William Bagshaw, the \\"Apostle of the Peak\\", and in 1711 he moved to Chinley, where a chapel had been built, partly from the old materials of the Malcoff meeting-house. He remained at Chinley until his death on 5 August 1755. He qualified himself as a doctor and obtained the degree of M.D. from the University of Aberdeen. This step was no doubt taken in order that he might have the means of adding to the slender income he would receive as a village dissenting pastor. During his long residence in the Peak District he gained great respect for his abilities and kindly character. Clegg began keeping a sporadic diary in 1708 and became more consistent about 10 years later. He records events concerning his family (his five sons and four daughters as well as his and his wife's parents and siblings), community and chapel events, his visits (sometimes several a day) to parishioners and others to treat their ailments, to pray with them, or just to visit, covering great distances on foot and on horseback. Occasionally he discusses politics and elections (Clegg was a Whig), and differences about matters of faith among the various Dissenting groups of the time - especially Congregationalists, Presbyterians and Wesleyans (Clegg discussed directly with Wesley). He writes about disputes between families including his son's apprenticeship disagreement with his master/teacher. He also discusses the weather, the state of the roads, catastrophes, accidental deaths and events like eclipses. Clegg was a renowned preacher and preached many sermons outside his Derbyshire parish and beyond the county too. In his own parish he preached twice on most Sundays and also \\"catechized the young people\\" every Sabbath. His sermons often lasted two hours or more. He was a pious man and confided his shortcomings to his diary and asked for divine help to correct them. He was also a bibliophile, collecting books himself and appraising libraries for estate sales. A facsimile of his diary (with some explanatory notes) was published by the Derbyshire Record Society in 1978. The original remains in a private collection. Clegg was married on 24 February 1704 to Ann Champion. After Ann's death in 1742 he married a widow, Sarah Eyre (n√©e Jones) on 2 August 1744; Sarah died 24 November 1748. Writings In 1703, in conjunction with John Ashe, he edited William Bagshaw's Essays on Union unto Christ, and shortly afterwards he wrote an \\"advertisement\\" prefixed to Ashe's Peaceable and Thankful Temper Recommended, the subject of which is the union of England and Scotland. In 1721, he published a discourse on the \\"Covenant of Grace\\", written in answer to Samuel De la Rose of Stockport; and in 1731 he printed a sermon which he had preached at the ordination of John Holland, jun., entitled The Continuance of the Christian Church secured by its Constitution. In 1736, Clegg wrote a book which is valuable for its biographical information, entitled A Discourse occasion'd by the sudden death of the Reverend Mr. John Ashe : to which is added a Short Account of his Life and Character, and of some others in or near the High Peak in Derbyshire, as an appendix to the Rev. Mr. William Bagshaw's Book \\"De Spiritualibus Pecci\\". He subsequently edited a collection of Seventeen Sermons preached by Ashe.

It was published by Johns Hopkins University Press in 2005. In it, Nelson discusses how the more general notion of free speech differs from that specifically applied to the First Amendment in American law. The book was positively received in reviews from academic and legal journals. Choice: Current Reviews for Academic Libraries recommended the book due to its thought-provoking propositions, and a review in The Journal of Politics described it as \\"a nice effort to explore free speech issues not covered by the First Amendment or constitutional law\\". A review in the journal Political Communication concluded of the author's argumentation: \\"His is indeed a theory fraught with possibilities both favorable and unfavorable to an expanded scope for the contents of free speech\\". Law and Politics Book Review concluded \\"Beyond the First Amendment is an intriguing and important contribution to the literature on free speech\\". Author Samuel Peter Nelson (2009) Samuel Peter Nelson graduated from Northwestern University with a Bachelor of Arts degree. He subsequently obtained a PhD from the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison. Nelson is an associate professor in the department of political science and public administration at the University of Toledo, having joined the department in 2001. Contents Nelson's work discusses the differences between concepts in the United States involving the First Amendment to the United States Constitution, and the larger notion of freedom of speech. The author discusses complex problems involving cyberspace communications and discourse which takes place on the Internet, and puts forth the supposition that such speech is not as easily addressed by the United States Constitution. Nelson points out that legal matters dealing with free speech in society often occur outside the United States or through regulation of online parties by sovereign state entities, and thus do not always directly fall within the jurisdiction of the United States government and American law. Nelson introduces the concept of a \\"pluralist framework\\" to address the various factors which drive free speech. Analysis Beyond the First Amendment is cited as a reference in the Encyclopedia of American Civil Liberties edited by Paul Finkelman, and Self- Examination: The Present and Future of Librarianship by John M. Budd. The book received a positive reception from a review in Choice: Current Reviews for Academic Libraries by M. W. Bowers of the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, who wrote: \\"The work is recommended reading for its provocative argument\\". In a review of the book in The Journal of Politics, Mark A. Graber of the University of Maryland pointed out how the book's author highlights areas of free speech which fall outside the jurisdiction of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution, and commented: > This effort to highlight important free speech issues in areas that are not > governed by the First Amendment offers a particularly promising avenue for > political scientists interested in American constitutionalism. Doctrinal > scholarship is dominated by law professors who have special training in > making legal arguments. By comparison, the constitutional issues that arise > outside of constitutional law discussed in Beyond the First Amendment > require the sort of special training in political theory and public policy > that marks education in the social sciences.\\" Graber concluded, \\"Beyond the First Amendment highlights how most crucial questions in institutional settings concern the value that ought to be placed on certain expressions rather than the legal right to engage in that expression\\". Peter G. Fish of Duke University reviewed Beyond the First Amendment for Political Communication, and wrote that Nelson's arguments within the book \\"provide able and well-crafted analyses of identifiable problems in communications\\". Fish analyzed the nature of Nelson's argumentation, and commented \\"Nelson is seemingly offering a cost (injury to society)-benefit analysis for specific exercises of all kinds of speech in the context of all sorts of social values and relationships irrespective of whether such relationships are found in the public or private sphere\\". Fish discussed Nelson's concepts within the framework of changing viewpoints on free speech through varying mediums of communication including online fora and speech in other venues: \\"How to weigh these elements also figures in Nelson's consideration of the Internet with its capacity for international communications‚Äîhow to weigh the intent of an Internet speaker against an unintended hostile foreign audience shielded by its own local laws or even remote, but culturally distinctive, domestic audiences for that matter\\". He posits that Nelson's plurality theory contains elements which would impact free speech in the future: \\"What Nelson terms 'incommensurable values' embedded in remote legal cultures not perceived by the speaker requires close attention to context, speaker's intention or lack thereof, and 'uptake' on the part of distant audiences. His is indeed a theory fraught with possibilities both favorable and unfavorable to an expanded scope for the contents of free speech\\". Professor Steven B. Lichtman of the department of political science at the University of Vermont reviewed the book for the Law and Politics Book Review, and identified Nelson's pluralist theory as a significant contribution. Lichtman commented, \\"The most important contribution of Beyond the First Amendment is its attempt to offer up a new model for understanding and safeguarding free speech\\". He praised the author for supporting his model with case history: \\"As a purely philosophical matter, Nelson‚Äôs pluralist framework is certainly intriguing. The model must be more than a mere talking point, though, and Nelson wisely endeavors to show how the pluralist framework can be deployed as a means of resolving actual cases\\". Lichtman concluded by recommending the work for academic scholars: \\"Beyond the First Amendment is an intriguing and important contribution to the literature on free speech. While it is likely beyond the grasp of all but the most talented undergraduates, its overview of First Amendment theory is an excellent resource for graduate students beginning to explore the field. For scholars, it is a challenging and provocative work sure to cause us to reassess how we teach and write about the subject\\".

Life Bahman Nirumand was born on 18 September 1936 to a wealthy family of civil servants in Tehran, Iran. His uncle was a consul in the Iranian embassy in Berlin before World War II. When he was 14 years old, Nirumand was sent to Germany to go to gymnasium, and attended Rudolf Steiner School. After his primary and secondary schooling, he studied German, philosophy and Persian at the Universities of Munich, T√ºbingen, and Berlin. He became a docent ƒ±n 1960 at the University of T√ºbingen with the subject \\"Problems of transplanting European dramas to Neo-Persian literature\\". After finishing his studies, he returned to Iran and worked there as a docent for comparative literature at the University of Tehran, and as a writer and journalist. Together with Mehdi Khanbaba Tehrani and Majid Zarbakhsh, he founded the Goruhe Kadreh (Kader Group), which understood itself as a Marxist- Leninist organisation and wanted to organize revolutionary cells for the anti- imperialist war in urban areas of Iran by acting as urban guerillas. In 1965, he returned to Germany to escape a purported imminent arrest. His book, Iran, The New Imperialism in Action, was published in January 1967 and had a large influence upon the internationalism of the May 1968 student uprising.On the influence of Nirumand's work on the West German New Left, see Quinn Slobodian, Foreign Front: Third World Politics in Sixties West Germany Duke University Press, chapter 5 Nirumand became a member of the Confederation of Iranian students. Freimut Duve invited him on a lecture tour for his book in Hamburg and he became acquainted with Ulrike Meinhof. They talked about the circumstances in Iran, whereupon in June 1967, for the official visit of Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi to West Germany, Meinhof alleged in an open letter to the Shah's wife, Farah Diba,\\"Revolution√§re Romantik\\"  Cicero Online that, among other things, for the peasants of Mehdiabad, a \\"Persian meal\\" consists of straw put in water.Ulrike Marie Meinhof Offner Brief an Fra Dibah In October 1967, Der Spiegel published a critical review of Nirumand's book, alleging that much of the information it contained was dubious or wrong.Der Spiegel, 46197096, Title=GEWALT AUF DEM CAMPUS In 1979, Nirumand returned to Iran before the Islamic Republic of Iran was founded. After staying there for three years, Nirumand went into exile in Paris, as he had not received permission to re-enter Germany. He later relocated to Berlin. Nirumand advocates for freedom in Iran. He holds that the forces around Ahmadinejad are sustained through terror and threats from the West, including the threats of sanctions and war. He believes that such actions serve to bolster the regime and that popular support for the regime is much weaker than is assumed in the West. He contends that artists, women, and the youth are not radicals and desire freedom. Nirumand argues that the image of Iran in the West has been reduced to that of only the Islamic regime itself. Nirumand is the author of several books and articles, including: *\\"Die Zeit\\" *\\"Der Spiegel\\" *\\"Die Tageszeitung\\" *\\"Frankfurter Rundschau\\" In addition to that, he authors numerous contributions that have been broadcast. He published, among others: *\\"Mit Gott f√ºr die Macht\\" (\\"With God for power\\"), a Khomeini-biography *\\"Feuer unterm Pfauenthron. Verbotene Geschichten aus dem persischen Widerstand\\" (\\"Fire under the Peacock's Throne: Forbidden stories from the Persian opposition\\") *\\"Iran - hinter den Gittern verdorren Blumen\\" (\\"Iran - behind the bars wither flowers\\") *\\"Sturm im Golf: Die Irak-Krise und das Pulverfass Nahost\\" (\\"Storm in the Gulf: The Iraq crisis and the Powder Keg Middle East\\" In addition, he has translated literature from Persian into German, among others: *Sadegh Hedayat *Gholamhossein Saedi *Samad Behrangi *He translated \\"The trip\\" of Mahmud Doulatabadi for the Unionsverlag. Since 2001, he is the composer of the monthly \\"Iran Reports\\" of the Heinrich B√∂ll Foundation.

He was born at Cyntwell, Cardiff, Wales and died at Weston-super-Mare, Somerset. Family and background Evelyn Hill's father was the Somerset and Oxford University cricketer Vernon Hill, who had moved back to south Wales to practise as a lawyer in the late 1890s. Vernon Hill's own father, Sir Edward Stock Hill, had a career that similarly straddled the Severn Estuary, with business interests and his home in Cardiff, but acting as Member of Parliament for Bristol South from 1886 to 1900. Evelyn's older brother, Mervyn Hill, played cricket for Somerset, Glamorgan and Cambridge University between 1921 and 1932. Cricket career Hill was a lower-order right-handed batsman and a right-arm fast bowler. He was educated at Eton College where in 1925 he took seven Winchester College first-innings wickets for 53 runs and was, according to Wisden Cricketers' Almanack, the team's \\"greatest potential match-winner\\", though he was rated as inconsistent: \\"He does bowl fast and he does make the ball bounce, though as yet he lacks strength and stamina,\\" it wrote, recommending that Oxford University take an interest in him when he went there after his school career was over. It is not clear whether Hill ever did go to Oxford: at the start of the 1926 cricket season, he was in the Somerset side for two matches, with a third in mid-June. In these matches he was more successful as a batsman than as a bowler. Against Middlesex at Lord's he made 32 of a last- wicket partnership of 59 with George Hunt and this was to be his highest first-class score. And in the June game he almost matched this by hitting an unbeaten 30 against Hampshire. Early in 1927, Hill joined the Territorial Army, where his induction record as a second lieutenant mentions his previous service only in terms of his membership of the officer training corps at Eton, suggesting he had not gone to Oxford University. In the 1927 cricket season, Hill played three further matches for Somerset and in the second of these, against Derbyshire at Taunton he finally made an impression as a bowler, taking four wickets for 98 runs in Derbyshire's first innings. He then improved on this in 1928, his best season, by taking five Worcestershire wickets for 36 in the match at Stourbridge, the best return of his career. In his next Somerset match, against Surrey at Taunton, Hill took five for 85 in Surrey's first innings. But just a week later he broke down in the match against Sussex at Hove. He returned for one final first-class match in 1929 but was not successful. Military career Hill joined the Territorial Army's Somerset Light Infantry unit and was promoted from second lieutenant to full lieutenant in February 1930. He resigned his commission in 1933. He returned to his rank as a lieutenant on the outbreak of the Second World War in September 1939. By the time he next relinquished his commission in September 1952, he had reached the rank of Major (Honorary Lieutenant-Colonel) and was allowed to keep the rank of lieutenant-colonel in retirement.

His parents built him a greenhouse when he was 8 years old and as a child he grew and sold plants as a hobby. Avent studied Horticulture at North Carolina State University under the late renowned horticulturist JC Raulston. He married his childhood sweetheart, Michelle Morgan (1957-2012), and after college, he worked for the North Carolina State Fairgrounds as its Landscape Director.Tony Avent's Biography While there, he purchased a home and property at 9241 Sauls Road in Raleigh. This parcel would eventually become Juniper Level Botanic Gardens and Plant Delights Nursery. When Plant Delights Nursery was established in 1988, it was operated as a part-time operation in Avent's back yard to fund the research and educational programs of the botanic garden. The business grew quickly and in 1994 Avent resigned his day job to focus on the nursery and garden full- time. Avent and his wife, Anita Avent, direct the daily operations of both Plant Delights Nursery and Juniper Level Botanic Gardens. From its initial production area of just one greenhouse, the business has grown to 30 greenhouses covering 28 acres.Plant Delights Information Web Page As the business expanded, Avent purchased adjacent properties. The nursery conducts extensive field trialsHistory of Plant Delights Nursery and Juniper Level Botanic Gardens in research beds at the Juniper Level Botanic Gardens before releasing new plants to the public. Tony Avent collects rare and unusual plants from all over the world during his frequent plant hunting expeditions. These and plants from other prominent collectors such as Dan Hinkley, Darrell Probst, Barry Yinger, Ozzie Johnson, Hans Hansen, Alan Galloway and Bleddyn Wynn-Jones are trialed for several years in the nursery's field trial beds before being made available for sale. In addition, the nursery evaluates plants from plant breeders, botanic gardens, and plant collectors all over the world to determine their suitability for gardens in the southeastern United States. Tony Avent also conducts his own plant breeding programs with a special focus on Agave, Amorphophallus, Arisaema, Crinum, Baptisia, Hosta, Mahonia, Trillium and Zephyranthes.Zephyanthes Photo Gallery on the Plant Delights Web Page The original residence on the 9241 Sauls Road property was converted into the main business office and Avent moved into a house on an adjacent property in 1996. The Avent's built a retirement home on the property in 2016, and the second residence became home to Juniper Level Botanic Garden's staff as well as the Plant Delights nursery management team. Today the nursery and botanic gardens employ more than three dozen full-time employees as well as many part-time and seasonal employees.List of Plant Delights Employees In addition, the botanic gardens employ a full-time staff, including a garden curator, along with volunteer workers who assist with garden upkeep and maintaining the research trial beds at Juniper Level Botanic Gardens. Controversy Owner Tony Avent has a history of publishing satirical catalog covers. These covers, created by Jack Pittman have historically provoked controversy as they typically present one sided political satire, evidenced by letters contained in a hate mail section on the Plant Delights website.Hate Mail In 2012, Plant Delights' Spring catalog cover ignited a strong reprisal from Penn State alumni, when the cover featured a caricature of former coach Jerry Sandusky dressed as a lion with a Penn State logo attached chasing children down a road.

He had a distinguished career in both Ireland and England, but his reputation was seriously damaged by the Leicester witch trials of 1616, which resulted in the hanging of several innocent women.  Family  He was born in Bedfordshire, second son of John Winch (died 1598) of Northill. He married Cicely Onslow, daughter of Richard Onslow (died 1571), Speaker of the House of Commons, and his wife Catherine Harding. They had two surviving children, including Onslow, who was the father of Sir Humphrey Winch, 1st Baronet. Richard Onslow, Speaker of the House of Commons and father-in-law of Humphrey Winch  Political career  He matriculated from St John's College, Cambridge; was called to the Bar in 1581 and became a bencher of Lincoln's Inn in 1596. He enjoyed the patronage of Oliver St John, 3rd Baron St John of Bletso. Through St John's influence he was elected to the House of Commons as MP for Bedford in 1593, and served in each successive Parliament up to 1606. In the earlier part of his career in Parliament he was identified with the Puritan faction in the Commons. He gave great offence to Queen Elizabeth I in 1593 by supporting a proposal by Sir Peter Wentworth, the chief spokesman in the Commons for the Puritans, to introduce a Bill to settle the royal succession, a subject on which the Queen absolutely forbade any debate in Parliament, let alone any attempt to legislate for it.Partly, it is believed, because her fear of death, and partly through a more rational concern that to name a successor would greatly diminish her own power: as she famously remarked \\"Men ever worship the rising sun\\". His offence was compounded by the fact that the meetings to discuss the Bill were held in his chambers at Lincoln's Inn. Compared to the fate of Wentworth, who was sent to the Tower of London and died there three years later, Winch's punishment was mild enough: he was forbidden to leave London for a time, but allowed to continue to attend Parliament. His disgrace was temporary, but thereafter he seems to have confined his speeches in the Commons to non-contentious matters. History of Parliament Online ‚Äì Humphrey Winche  Judge  In 1606, despite his earlier conflict with the Crown, he was recommended to King James I as a man who was suitable for judicial appointment, by reason of his legal ability and integrity. For this purpose he was made a serjeant-at-law and knight, then appointed Chief Baron of the Irish Exchequer. He received glowing reports as a judge, being praised as \\"understanding and painstaking\\".Ball, F. Elrington The Judges in Ireland 1221‚Äì1921 John Murray London 1926 Francis Bacon said that Winch's qualities of \\"quickness, industry and dispatch\\" made him a model for other judges to emulate. He was conscientious in going on assize and was regular in attendance at the Court of Castle Chamber (the Irish equivalent of Star Chamber). After two years he was promoted to the office of Lord Chief Justice of the King's Bench in Ireland. Winch, like many (though by no means all) transplanted English officials, disliked the Irish climate and complained of its effect on his health, and also grumbled about the lack of staff to support him and the \\"humiliating\\" fees he received.Crawford, Jon G. A Star Chamber Court in Ireland- the Court of Castle Chamber 1571‚Äì1641 Four Courts Press Dublin 2005 p.105 From 1610 onwards he was lobbying for a return to England. Despite the reluctance of the Dublin Government to lose a valued Crown servant, he was transferred to the English Court of Common Pleas in 1611. He returned to Ireland on official business in 1613, and was regarded as an expert on Irish matters, sitting on the Privy Council committees on Irish affairs.Crawford p.105  Leicester witch trials  See main article: Leicester boy Winch's illustrious reputation as a judge was dealt a serious blow by his conduct at the summer assizes in Leicester in 1616. Fifteen women had been charged with witchcraft on the sole evidence of a young boy called John Smith, who claimed that they had possessed him. The judges, Winch and Ranulph Crewe, found the boy to be a credible witness: while six of those accused were spared, nine were condemned to death and hanged. A month after the hangings King James I visited Leicester. The King had always shown a keen interest in witchcraft, but, although he was a firm believer in the power of witches, he could be quite sceptical about individual cases of alleged supernatural activity, and was quite shrewd in detecting impostors. He examined the boy John Smith and promptly declared him to be a fraud. The boy broke down and confessed, and the five survivors (one had already died) were released from prison.  Death  Despite the damage to his reputation caused by the witchcraft trials fiasco, Winch remained on the bench until he died suddenly at Chancery Lane from a stroke in February 1625. An impressive memorial was raised to him in his local church at Everton.

It centers on the death of a young woman (Jennifer Ferrin), who spontaneously combusts in the middle of a street. The Fringe team's investigation leads them to learn more about the drug trials Olivia (Anna Torv) experienced as a child, as well as other revelations. The episode's story was written by Akiva Goldsman, while the teleplay was co-written by executive producer Jeff Pinkner and supervising producer J.R. Orci. It was directed by Fred Toye. The title is based on the Robert Frost poem of the same name. Robert Chiappetta and Glen Whitman, frequent contributors to the series, aided in the episode's production by \\"find[ing] a new and gruesome way to blow people up,\\" and rooting its explanation in science. It first aired in the United States on May 5, 2009 on the Fox network. An estimated 9.245 million viewers watched the episode, making it the network's fifth most watched show for the week. \\"The Road Not Taken\\" received mostly positive reviews from television critics, with many praising Olivia's visions of the other universe and John Noble's performance. Plot The Fringe Division investigates the case of a woman (Jennifer Ferrin) who \\"spontaneously combusts\\" in the middle of a busy New York street. The team discovers that the victim is the subject of a ZFT experiment to cultivate pyrokinesis. As they investigate, Olivia (Anna Torv) experiences \\"visions\\" while awake. Walter (John Noble) suggests she is seeing a parallel universe which has branched off from our own. Olivia and Peter (Joshua Jackson) visit an agoraphobic website designer (Clint Howard) who is apparently aware of William Bell, the drug trials, and the coming war, although his credibility comes into question when he believes himself to be a character in the plot of Star Trek. Using information from her visions, Olivia tracks down the victim's twin sister, who only moments before was kidnapped for more ZFT experimentation. Harris (Michael Gaston) is revealed to be responsible for the crimes, and while closing in on him, Olivia gets locked in a room with the twin sister, whose unstable pyrokinetic abilities threaten both their lives. With Olivia's guidance, the woman focuses her energy on Harris and incinerates him. Olivia finds out that the sisters were part of the same nootropic drug trial that she was as a child. She presses Walter to reveal why he and William Bell were developing \\"supersoldiers,\\" but Walter only shares that it was for protection against some impending doom that he regrettably cannot recall. Meanwhile, Walter reveals that the ZFT manuscript was written by William Bell, and that the copy of the manuscript that ZFT uses is missing a chapter dealing with ethics. He locates the original, but the Observer (Michael Cerveris) shows up and takes Walter away, cryptically stating: \\"it is time to go.\\" Nina Sharp (Blair Brown) visits Broyles (Lance Reddick) to discuss the Observer, and is later shot in her hotel by two masked gunmen using a suppressed pistol. Production Akiva Goldsman wrote the story on which this episode is based. The episode's teleplay was co-written by supervising producer J.R. Orci and executive producer Jeff Pinkner, based on a story by Akiva Goldsman. Producer Frederick E. O. Toye served as director. Goldsman had joined the series halfway through the season by writing and directing the mythology-riddled episode \\"Bad Dreams\\", and was instrumental in convincing the showrunners to depict more Fringe mythology earlier than planned, most notably with the depiction of parallel universes. The title of \\"The Road Not Taken\\" is based on the Robert Frost poem of the same name. New Media consultants and scientists Robert Chiappetta and Glen Whitman aided in the production of the episode. They had worked on the series throughout the first season, with their role ranging from directly writing episodes to advising the others on scientific concepts. Whitman later explained that they \\"come to us with questions: Is this possible? Where can we go with this? Then we go and read the very technical articles, or talk with scientists, and then translate that into the storytelling medium of our show.\\" For \\"The Road Not Taken\\", he and Chiappetta were asked to again \\"find a new and gruesome way to blow people up,\\" this time by rooting it in the concept of pyrokinesis. Chiappetta explained, \\"They wanted to have someone spontaneously combust and burn up. So this is where we sort of leaned back into our mythology.\\" As the episode centered around the concept of pyrokinesis, several immolation stunts had to be performed carefully. They and the episode writers developed a storyline in which a victim's childhood experimentation, when they were injected with something, was now \\"coming back to haunt them.\\" Whitman noted that the concept, like others in the show, was based on real scientific knowledge, \\"The notion is, some kind of a medical treatment that they were given allowed their brain to command vibrations that would take place. It really is true that essentially what heat is is vibrations of atoms, so if your brain can cause some kind of vibration to take place, eventually you could create enough heat to even create a flame.\\" Pinkner added, \\"And if you haven't yet mastered pyrokinesis and the ability to excite molecules that are outside your body, well then you're going to excite the ones inside your body and you're going to blow up, sadly.\\" For Harris' immolation scene, first unit director Gary Rake emphasized safety, explaining that \\"everyone really has to think about what's going on and really focus tonight. This is a quintessential moment where we can't have any mistakes.\\" Everything in the scene was flame- retardant, and a special burn unit crew was present. Actor Michael Gaston's arm, immersed in a special gel, was actually inflamed and then extinguished after filming was cut. Then, Gaston's stand-in, stuntman Don Hewitt, Jr, was completely set on fire. Hewitt wore the same costume, a wig, a face shield, and was also covered in a flammable gel. It was Gaston's final episode with the series. Actress Jasika Nicole, who plays junior FBI agent Astrid Farnsworth, described the episode in a May 2009 interview, \\"It's about spontaneously combusting. This is the episode I get to get out of the lab. I remember thinking I can't wait to see what the set's going to look like and how they will make it look when the spontaneous combusting takes place. And we get there and it's just smoke on the walls, like a kitchen fire. I thought that was so funny because I thought there were going to be body parts everywhere, like a small explosion. But it's a really good episode, which leads you into the coolest parts of the finale episode.\\" Cultural references The episode contains many cultural references, which Annalee Newitz of io9 attributed to the episode's writers: \\"It was bound to happen that one day these four supernerds would get together and spawn an episode so packed with in-groupy pop culture references that smacking is probably in order.\\" Peter and Walter reference the 1984 supernatural comedy film Ghostbusters while investigating the opening scene's case, and later debate the origin of the term pyrokinesis, coined by author Stephen King in his 1981 novel Firestarter. Emmanuel Grayson, who lives at street address number 1701, refers to the titular character of the 1982 science fiction film Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan, as well as Romulans and the United Federation of Planets, when describing government conspiracies to Peter and Olivia. Grayson also believes himself to be Mr. Spock. This reference is made even more appropriate by the fact that Spock's mother was named Amanda Grayson. That Clint Howard played the character here gives further connection to Star Trek, having played Balok. Reception =Ratings= \\"The Road Not Taken\\" was first broadcast in the United States on May 5, 2009 on the Fox network. It was watched by an estimated 9.245 million viewers, making it the network's fifth most watched show for the week. The episode earned a 4.0/10 ratings share among adults aged 18 to 49, meaning that it was seen by 4.0 percent of all 18- to 49-year-olds, and 10 percent of all 18- to 49-year-olds watching television at the time of broadcast. Fox later aired repeats of season one episodes, including \\"The Road Not Taken\\", that featured Twitter posts by some of Fringes cast and producers. =Reviews= The episode received generally positive reviews from television critics. TV Squad's Jane Boursaw called the episode's case \\"an interesting premise\\" and was pleased that \\"things are really, REALLY starting to come together in a big way, which is good, considering that the finale is fast approaching\\". Annalee Newitz of io9 declared it to be \\"one of the most rewarding episodes ever for people who love the show's mythology,\\" and found Olivia's universe-hopping ability to be \\"truly cool\\". Newitz concluded that \\"this was a truly awesome episode with a lot of payoff for those of us who have been glued to the set every Tuesday night, looking for answers.\\" The website later listed \\"The Road Not Taken\\" as one of the \\"crucial\\" episodes new viewers must watch to get into the show. Television Without Pity graded the episode with a A-. Noel Murray of The A.V. Club complimented the episode's opening scene for providing a succinct synopsis of the season to new viewers who may have been newly discovering the series after watching its lead-in, American Idol. Though he graded the episode with an A-, Murray did however critique its climatic scene for being \\"clumsily paced and staged\\". Murray mainly found positive aspects with the episode, explaining, \\"For a show that started out being a fairly dour procedural with wacky mad-scientist elements, Fringe has really worked its way into that fantasy/sci-fi sweet-spot, where its own forward momentum makes the ridiculous look likely and arcane mythology seem well-worth the time to sort through and analyze.\\" Other highlights Murray found was Noble's performance, which he considered his \\"finest moment in the series to date,\\" and Olivia's visions of the other universe. IGN's Ramsey Isler rated the episode with a score of 9.2 out of 10. He thought that after a \\"stereotypical, over-the-top\\" characterization in past episodes, Gaston \\"stepped up his portrayal\\" as Harris and was \\"annoying... in a much more believable way.\\" Isler found the revelation surrounding Harris to be \\"deliciously surprising,\\" and wrote that the \\"last twenty minutes of the episode really ramped up the suspense and action.\\" However, the IGN reviewer thought that while the conversation with Grayson was an \\"hilarious homage to Leonard Nimoy, it seemed completely superfluous in terms of the overall storyline.\\" Isler concluded his review on a positive note by focusing on Noble's performance, calling it \\"one of the best scenes [he] has ever done as Walter Bishop. It was emotional, believable, and perfectly accurate for a character that has a high level of self-loathing and remorse for what he's done, and the hopeless frustration of not being able to remember exactly why he did it.\\" References ;Works cited * External links * \\"The Road Not Taken\\" at Fox Category:2009 American television episodes Category:Fringe (season 1) episodes Category:Television episodes written by Akiva Goldsman Category:Smart drugs in fiction ","title":"The Road Not Taken (Fringe)"},{"id":"30560481","text":"Phiona Mutesi (born c. 1996) is a Ugandan chess player.Tim Crothers (28 August 2016). \\"Chess queen of Africa\\". The Guardian. She has represented Uganda at four Women's Chess Olympiads, and is one of the first titled female players in Ugandan chess history. Mutesi is the subject of a 2012 book and a 2016 film called Queen of Katwe. Background Mutesi was born and grew up in the neighbourhood of Katwe, the largest of Kampala's eight slums. When she was roughly three years old, her father died of AIDS. Her older sister, Julia, subsequently died of unknown causes. At age nine, Mutesi dropped out of school because her family could no longer afford to send her. Mutesi sold maize in a street market. One day she followed her brother and discovered a project run by Sports Outreach Institute, a Christian sports led mission. In this after- school program run by Robert Katende, Mutesi began playing chess. During a trip to the US, Mutesi visited Northwest University in Kirkland, Washington. She was offered a scholarshiphttp://q13fox.com/2017/10/14/queen-of-katwe- receives-help-for-costs-to-attend-northwest-university-in-kirkland-during- chess-tournament/ and began attending Northwest University in 2017. She plans to major in sociology. After college, Mutesi said she wants to \\"come back home and serve my community,\\" and work with children who live in the slums of Uganda. Chess career In 2010, Mutesi played six rounds on board two and one round on board one for Uganda at the women's event of the 39th Chess Olympiad, held in Khanty-Mansiysk, Russia. She scored one-and-a-half points from the seven games she played. At this event, she attracted the attention of journalist Tim Crothers, who wrote a substantial piece on her for ESPN The Magazine. Commenting on one of her games from the 2010 Olympiad, British chess journalist John Saunders wrote that \\"Phiona's present playing standard is that of a modest but competent club player but, placed in the context of her environmental and educational deprivation, her achievement in reaching such a level has been awe-inspiring.\\"Xan Rice, Ugandan girl, Phiona Mutesi leads chess revolution from the slums, The Guardian, 18 February 2011 As of 2012, she was a three-time winner of the Women's Junior Chess Championship of Uganda.\\"Phiona Mutesi To Speak at Philly All-Girls Chess Workshop\\". United States Chess Federation. 29 November 2012. In 2012, Mutesi and Ivy Amoko were awarded the title of Woman Candidate Master after scoring the required 50% from nine games at the 40th Chess Olympiad in Istanbul, Turkey. This made them the first titled female players in Ugandan chess history. The same year she became the first female player to win the open category of the National Junior Chess Championship in Uganda. In 2013, she again played in the National Junior Chess Championship in Uganda and reached the finals against Lutaaya Shafiq of Makerere University. She won the under-20 girls category but not the open category. Mutesi represented Uganda at the 2014 41st Chess Olympiad and the 2016 42nd Chess Olympiad. She joined Northwest University's chess team in competing at the Pan American Intercollegiate Team Chess Championship, held in Columbus, Ohio, in December 2017.https://new.uschess.org/news/webster- university/ The team won the title of \\"Top Small College\\" for Northwest University, taking it from the title holders of four consecutive years, Oberlin College. Mutesi won three matches and drew one, playing on Board 2. Media In 2010, Silent Images made a short documentary film about her. Sports Outreach used this documentary to interest The Walt Disney Company in making a film about Mutesi's story, which came out in 2016. In 2012, a book was published about Mutesi titled The Queen of Katwe: A Story of Life, Chess, and One Extraordinary Girl's Dream of Becoming a Grandmaster and authored by Tim Crothers. Walt Disney Pictures optioned the rights to the book and began work on the film in 2012. That 2016 film, Queen of Katwe, stars Lupita Nyong'o and David Oyelowo. Mutesi is portrayed by Madina Nalwanga. Mutesi attended premieres of the film in Toronto, Canada (September 10), Hollywood, California (September 20), and Kampala, Uganda (October 1). The royalties from the book and movie have provided Mutesi and her family much more financial security than they have ever enjoyed. Mutesi said, \\"I think the film was a 90 per cent portrayal of me, although I did not want some scenes of dancing because I don't like dancing.\\"  References External links * Official website Interview with Robert Katende and Phiona Mutesi on impactmania *Phiona Mutesi at chessgames.com, where the moves of each of her games in Women's Chess Olympiads can be viewed (scroll down there to links) *of Katwe - A short documentary about Phiona Mutesi by Silent Images on YouTube *Phiona: A Virtual Reality Portrait of 'Queen of Katwe', ABC News, 2016 Category:1996 births Category:Living people Category:Ugandan chess players Category:Ugandan female chess players Category:Chess Olympiad competitors Category:People from Kampala Category:Young Achievers Award winners ","title":"Phiona Mutesi"},{"id":"30560501","text":"Nicolaas Grevinckhoven (Grevinchovius, Grevinghoven or Grevinchoven in German sources) (died 1632) was a Dutch Protestant minister, a combative proponent of the Remonstrant party.

In addition to its New York City Headquarters, EWI has offices in San Francisco, California, Brussels,\\"Sectarian tensions in Iraq will reinforce ISIS, Kurdish researcher cautions\\" . Rudaw 9/4/2016 Belgium, and Moscow, Russia. History The Institute for East-West Security Studies was founded in 1980, when then CEO John Edwin Mroz and Ira D. Wallach set out to study means of addressing areas of political dispute across the Iron Curtain. In 1984, EWI hosted the first track 2 military-to-military discussions between the NATO and Warsaw Pact countries. These talks, focusing heavily on the establishment of confidence-building measures (CBMs) between the two parties, ultimately resulted in an agreement requiring each side to alert the other of troop movements. After the fall of the Berlin Wall and the eruption of conflicts in Southeastern Europe, EWI worked to foster economic stability in the region, encouraging cross-border cooperation and training leaders for democratic states. In the 2000s (decade), EWI‚Äôs operations expanded geographically to China, Southwest Asia and the Middle East, focusing on issues like cybersecurity, economic security, and countering violent extremism. Since 2008, EWI has partnered with the China Association for International Friendly Contact to organize forums, termed the U.S.-China Sanya Initiative, between retired People's Liberation Army officers and retired U.S. military personnel. The Sanya Initiative is supported by the China-United States Exchange Foundation (CUSEF), a Hong Kong-based nonprofit established by billionaire Tung Chee-hwa. In May 2009, EWI released its Joint Threat Assessment on Iran, produced by senior U.S. and Russian experts convened by the Institute.

Through its work with Russia, EWI has sought to \\"build a sustainable relationship of trust between Russia, its G-8 partners, and the world‚Äôs new rising powers.\\" This program was responsible for establishing the 2009 Joint Threat Assessment on Iran. The China program, which was initiated in 2006, seeks to foster China's integration into the international sphere as a productive partner. An example of EWI's China work is the establishment of annual three-party talks between Republican Party, Democratic Party, and Chinese Communist Party leaders. The Strategic Trust- building Initiative also incorporates EWI's work in Weapons of Mass Destruction issues. The WMD program, which began in 2006, aims to reduce political obstacles to the elimination of the threat of nuclear weapons. EWI organized a series of events and meetings in 2007 and 2008 to address stalled arms discussions in the international community. =Regional Security= This program addresses specific regional problems requiring the attention of the international community. Current issues include: security and stability in Afghanistan & Southwest Asia, and Euro-Atlantic security. Regional Security is directly involved with the Parliamentarians Network for Conflict Prevention‚Äîa network, founded by EWI in October 2008, that has since grown to include 150 parliamentarians from more than 50 countries. Members of the network work to translate ideas into policy as well as advocate for a greater allocation of resources for preventive action. In 2010, EWI created the Amu Darya Basin Network, which links experts, researchers and policy makers from Central Asia, Afghanistan and Europe to create a place for key stakeholders to discuss trans-boundary water issues, forge agreements and share knowledge. The Amu Darya Basin Network highlights the need for local ownership and input in the management of shared waters, and for engagement in the region in more concrete ways. In addition, the regional security program initiated the Abu Dhabi Process, a set of meetings focused on regional cooperation between Afghanistan and Pakistan. The process emphasised that there is no military solution to the conflict in Afghanistan and has seen meeting take place in Abu Dhabi, Kabul and Islamabad among places. =Economic Security= EWI's Economic Security Initiative, launched in fall 2011, focuses on increasing resilience and response capabilities in regions threatened by water, food and energy scarcity. This program works with global investors to address dilemmas of growth and sustainability, and also focuses on the security of the digital economy. An example of this work includes the annual Worldwide Security Conference, first held in 2003, which assembles experts from governments, the private sector, NGOs, and academia to explore issues such as countering violent extremism, securing infrastructure, and energy security. The Worldwide Cybersecurity Initiative is a part of the ESI. It aims to reduce vulnerabilities in governmental and private cybersecurity policies by developing consensus proposals for new agreements and policy reform. The institute's chief method of achieving this goal has been the hosting of the Worldwide Cybersecurity Summit, an annual meeting of governmental and corporate actors in the field, first held in May 2010 at Dallas, Texas, which established policy recommendations for securing international cyber infrastructure.

Early life Clements was born in 1735, the son of a rector in Leicestershire.Chambers 1820, pp. 561562 He enlisted in the Royal Navy at the age of thirteen, serving as a captain's servant and then midshipman. On 17 November 1755 he passed the Admiralty Board examination for the rank of lieutenant, and was commissioned two weeks later as first lieutenant aboard .Duffy & McLeod 2011, p. 48 He was still serving in this position in 1757, at the outbreak of the Seven Years' War between France and England. In May 1757, Unicorn encountered and engaged L'Invincible, a French privateer from St Malo. The captain of Unicorn was killed, but Clements assumed command and secured the capture of the privateer. The French vessel was brought into Kinsale; and Clements immediately took Unicorn back to sea in pursuit of a second French vessel, which was also captured and brought in. For this service Clements was recommended for promotion; he spent four months as commander of HMS London, a 6-gun busse and was then named as post-captain of the 28-gun frigate from 29 September 1757. Royal Navy Captain Clements continued in Actaeon, attached to the Channel fleet, till the summer of 1759, when he was moved into of 36 guns, also with the fleet blockading Brest and Quiberon Bay. He was specially employed, with other frigates, in cruising against French privateers and in communicating with the home ports. By chance, Pallas, in company with and , put into Kinsale in the last days of February 1760, just as a message came from the Duke of Bedford, then lord-lieutenant of Ireland, that Fran√ßois Thurot's squadron was at Belfast. They immediately put to sea and, coming to Belfast on the morning of the 28th, succeeded in capturing Thurot's ships with small loss. The casualties among Clements' crew amounted to one killed and five wounded.

On paying off this ship Clements refused to give a certificate of service to the ship's master, whom he reported as 'inattentive to his duty.' The master made a counter-accusation that Clements had misused and wasted the ship's stores, but in November 1765 a Navy Board inquiry dismissed this allegation as both groundless and inspired by malice. In December 1765, Clements married a London woman, Miss Hopton, who brought with her a substantial personal fortune of ¬£10,000. In 1769 Clements commanded of 70 guns, guardship at Portsmouth, but which in 1770 was sent up the Mediterranean as part of the answer to a threatening armament of the French at Toulon. In March 1778 he was appointed to of 74 guns, which he commanded in the action off Ushant on 27 July and in the October cruise under Admiral Augustus Keppel. He was afterwards a witness for the defence in the admiral's trial, and spoke strongly in the admiral's favour, which was not to his personal advantage. Later life A few months later Clements was compelled by failing mental health to resign his command. In July he was granted leave from the Navy to go abroad with his family, and travelled to Ostend with his wife and daughter. His name continued on the list of captains till around 1789, when by virtue of seniority he was promoted to rear admiral on the superannuated list. His wife died in around 1786, after which Clements' mental health declined further and he was confined to an insane asylum. He died in around 1796.

The zerat system was particularly common in Bengal and Bihar. It refers to the private land of the landlord, which would often be cultivated by peasants. Zerat was mainly responsible for a change in traditional forms of agricultural organization in some parts of India, replacing the ryot system. It produced a strain on the peasant economy, despite peasants being free to grow their own crops. In indigo cultivation practiced by planters in Bihar and Bengal, the rayat and zerat were common practices which represented two labour hiring processes. The ryot (or raiyat) (\\"peasant\\") was a small land holder who took financial support from the planter and in return had to come to a written understanding to turn over the produce from his land to the planter at a predetermined amount. Zerat cultivation, which is direct cultivation by the planter, however, was an exclusive practice of the planter in which he hired labour to work on his fields to grow crops of his choice. 'Zerat' literally means ‚Äúthe Zamindars private land, demesne‚Äù, which had a direct impact on the peasants. The ploy of the planter in demesne was to encroach the land of the peasant and eventually claim it as his own and expand his control over the peasantry as a Zamindar. In the Magistrate of Darbhanga's Administration Report for the year 1876‚Äì77, he reports that indigo cultivation in Bengal is divided into three methods that planters refer to as \\"tirhut\\". These are characterized as systems of tenure and conditions of indigo cultivation. The first of these, \\"zerat\\", is used if the land is in the planter's sole possession, and the ryot employed to work the land is a hired labourer. The term \\"assamiviar\\" is relevant when the land is in the rayat's possession and he is compelled (being the planter's tenant) to grow indigo on it at fixed rates. Lastly, the term \\"khooshgee\\" is appropriate when the rayat, under no compulsion, grows the plant as a remunerative crop. Sometimes referred to as \\"compulsory labour\\", expropriated peasants made up the largest group of the zerat labour force. The ryot option was preferred by the planter, as his involvement was limited only to finance the cultivation and not pay for any other costs of labour and other inputs required to raise the crop or even loss of crop, particularly in indigo cultivation. The risk was entirely that of the peasant, who at times of loss of crop suffered losses and was even unable to cover the loan taken from the planter. The basic difference in the Zerat system was the planter had not only to pay for the labour costs but also bear all risks involved with raising the crop, and as such he did not prefer this option.

John Clench by Wenceslaus Hollar Life Clench was the son of John Clench of Wethersfield, Essex and Joan, daughter of John Amias of the same county, and grandson of John Clench of Leeds, Yorkshire. He was admitted a student at Lincoln's Inn on 11 February 1556, called to the bar in 1568, appointed recorder of Ipswich in 1573-1574‚Äîbeing the first known to have held office‚Äîelected reader at his inn in Lent 1574, took the degree of serjeant-at-law in Michaelmas term 1580, was appointed a baron of the exchequer in the following year (27 November), being assigned to the northern circuit, and on 29 May 1584 was transferred to the court of queen's bench. He was one of the judges appointed to hear causes in chancery in the six months which intervened between the death of the lord chancellor, Sir Christopher Hatton (20 November 1591), and the appointment of his successor. He remained, however, attached to the northern circuit, apparently until his retirement. In 1596 he took the Lincoln assizes with Chief-justice Anderson, the bulk of the criminal business consisting, as it would seem, of cases of ecclesiastical recusancy. The unknown writer of a letter preserved in the fourth volume of Strype's Annals says: > 'The demeanour of him (Anderson, a zealous high churchman) and the other > judge, as they sit by turns upon the gaol (with reverence I speak it) in > these matters is flat opposite; and they which are maliciously affected, > when Mr. Justice Clinch sitteth upon the gaol, do labour to adjourn their > complaints (though they be before upon the file) to the next assize; and the > gentlemen in the several shires are endangered by this means to be cast into > a faction' (Strype, Annals, fol., iv. 265). Clench is said to have been an especial favourite with Elizabeth. Nevertheless, he does not appear to have been knighted, or in any way honoured. In 1600, while retaining the emoluments of his office, he was displaced from attendance at court, on account of age and infirmities, and three years later he was pensioned. He died on 19 August 1607, at his seat at Holbrook, and was buried in Holbrook Church, his monument being inscribed as in memory colendissimi suique temporis antiquissimi judicis Johannis Clenche. A half-length portrait of Clench in his robes was long preserved at Harden Hall (the seat in the last century of Lord Alvanley) in Cheshire, but appears to have been among the works of art dispersed in 1815. A portrait of the judge was also in the possession of the town clerk of Ipswich in 1831. Clench was married to Catherine, daughter of Thomas Almot of Creeting All Saints, by whom he had issue five sons and eight daughters. His heir, Thomas, who married Margery, daughter of John Barker, merchant, of Ipswich, was sheriff of Suffolk in 1616, and junior M.P. for the same county in 1630, and one John Clench of Creeting was sheriff of Suffolk in 1630.

He was seated at Zelen Grad (Skobaljiƒá Grad), a fortified town just above modern town of Vuƒçje. History Nikola Skobaljiƒá is remembered in Serbian history for his military feats during the 1454 battles with the invading Ottoman Turks. After Ottoman Sultan Mehmed II had conquered Constantinople, he decided to quickly invade the Serbian Despotate in July 1454, with the goal of full annexation. Serbian despot ƒêuraƒë Brankoviƒá raised two armies with the goal of defending the despotate; 1st army, was stationed at Duboƒçica, led by Voivode Nikola Skobaljiƒá, and the 2nd army was on the banks of Sitnica river. As Skobaljiƒá's army was cut off from Serbia's north, the despot advised that the Serb armies surrender if they are not able to flee, until the Hungarian army led by John Hunyadi is eventually able to make a rescue attempt. Skobaljiƒá acted against the advice of his despot and decided to act alone and make a stand against the great Ottoman army. On September 24th, 1454, he decisively beat a large invading army near Banja, in the Battle of Leskovac. Babinger, Franz, William C. Hickman and Ralph Manheim, Mehmed the Conqueror and His Time, Princeton University Press, 1978. On the banks of Morava river, one of the sultan's generals, Feriz Bey, detached from the Sultan with his 32 000-strong army, in the attempt of preventing Serbs and Hungarians to mount a counter-offensive. Serbs didn't hesitate to make the first step, and the two armies met in a fierce battle. On October 2nd, Skobaljiƒá's army, helped by the army of John Hunyadi and ƒêuraƒë Brankoviƒá, destroyed the armies of Feriz Bey in the Battle of Kru≈°evac, and the Bey himself was captured. Skobaljiƒá's continued resistance to the Ottoman invasion lasted for two more months. Sultan Mehmed, furious at the failure of his generals against the Voivode, personally took command of his armies and finally defeated Skobaljiƒá's army at Trepanja on 16 November 1454. Skobaljiƒá was captured and killed by impalement, along with his uncle. Sultan Mehmed II ordered Nikola and his uncle's heads to be sent to Constantinople as a reminder of consequences of resistance to the Sultan. It is said that Nikola Skobaljiƒá was the first Serb to be impaled by the Ottomans, a practice that would continue and grow in centuries forward.

Davis (born Jacob Youphes) (1831‚Äì1908) was a Latvian-born American tailor who is credited with inventing modern jeans. Growing up in Latvia, he emigrated to the United States as a young man and spent some time in Canada as well. He invented jeans by using sturdy cloth and rivets to strengthen weak points in the seams, and partnered with Levi Strauss to mass-produce them. Early life Jacob Youphes was born to a Jewish family in the city of Riga, in 1831. During his time in Riga city, he trained and worked as a tailor. Immigration to America In 1854, at the age of 23, he emigrated to the United States, arriving in New York City where he changed his name to Jacob Davis. There he ran a tailors shop before moving to Maine and then, in 1856, San Francisco before moving on to Weaverville. Time in Canada After this itinerant spell in America, during which time it is believed he worked as a journeyman tailor, in 1858 Davis left California and moved to Western Canada to try to find more profitable work. There, Davis met a German immigrant, Annie Parksher, whom he married and together, Jacob and Annie had six children. During his time in Canada, Davis worked at the Fraser River panning for gold.Jacob Davis and the Copper-riveted Jeans Return to America In January 1867, Davis returned to San Francisco with Annie and his family. Later that year, they moved to Virginia City, Nevada where he sold wholesale tobacco and pork before beginning work once more as a tailor. By 1868, the family had moved, this time to Reno, Nevada which at that time was a tiny railroad town and there he helped Frederick Hertlein build a brewery. 1869 saw Davis revert to his original trade, opening a tailor shop in the main street of the town. Tailor shop in Reno In his tailor shop, Davis made functional items such as tents, horse blankets and wagon covers for the railway workers on the Central Pacific Railroad. The fabric Davis worked with was heavy-duty cotton duck cloth and cotton denim which he bought from Levi Strauss & Co., a dry goods company in San Francisco. To strengthen the stress points of the sewn items he was making, Davis used copper rivets to reinforce the stitching. The birth of jeans In December 1870, Davis was asked by a customer to make a pair of strong working pants for her husband who was a woodcutter. To create suitably robust pants for working, he used duck cloth and reinforced the weak points in the seams and pockets with the copper rivets. Such was the success of these pants that word spread throughout the labourers along the railroad. Davis was making these working pants in duck cotton and, as early as 1871, in denim cotton. Before long, he found he could not keep up with demand. Patent application Figure from US Patent No. 139,121 Davis had previously applied for patents for other inventions. Realising the potential value in his reinforced jeans concept, in 1872, he approached Levi Strauss, who was still his supplier of fabric, and asked for his financial backing in the filing of a patent application. Strauss agreed, and on May 20. 1873, US Patent No. 139,121 for \\"Improvements in fastening pocket openings\\" was issued in the name of Jacob W. Davis and Levi Strauss and Company. That same year, Davis started sewing a double orange threaded stitched design onto the back pocket of the jeans to distinguish them from those made by his competitors. This trademark feature became Registered U.S. Trade Mark No.1,139,254. U.S. Trade Mark 1,139,254 Working for Levi Strauss By this time, Strauss had set up a sizeable tailor shop in San Francisco for the production of Davis' working pants and Jacob and his family had moved back to San Francisco for Davis to run this shop. As demand continued to grow, the shop was superseded by a manufacturing plant which Davis managed for Strauss. Davis continued to work there for the remainder of his life, overseeing production of the work pants as well as other lines including work shirts and overalls. Death Davis died in San Francisco in 1908. Commemoration In 2006 a plaque was erected in Reno, Nevada, outside the premises where Davis's tailor shop was located, to commemorate the fact jeans were invented there.

After some schooling at Rochester he attended for two years the borough hospitals, whence he removed to Edinburgh and took the degree of M.D. on 24 June 1797 (inaugural essay, De Anasarca). With the object of further studying his profession, he went abroad, visiting Halle, G√∂ttingen, Vienna, and Paris. He was detained a prisoner in France for no less a period than eleven years, being confined successively at Fontainebleau, Verdun, and Valenciennes. At the latter depot, he passed the greater part of his detention. On his arrival he found the prisoners in the utmost need of medical assistance: \\"He accordingly proposed to the committee of Verdun, an association of the principal British officers and gentlemen in France, charged with the general distribution of charitable succours obtained from England, to give them his gratuitous care, which was gladly accepted, and a dispensary was in consequence established, though not without great difficulties from the French military authorities.\\" Cleverley was allowed to return home in 1814, when he received for his services at Valenciennes the marked thanks of the managing committee of Lloyd's.

Its goal was to take care of the administration of newly established Albania until its own political institutions were in order.  History  The Headquarters of the International Commission of Control (ICC) was in Vlor√´. The Great Powers authorized the commission to assume the administration of the country. A plot by the Young Turk government and led by Bekir Fikri to restore Ottoman control over Albania through the installment of an Ottoman-Albanian officer Ahmed Izzet Pasha as monarch was uncovered by the Serbs and reported to the ICC. Ismail Qemali supported the plot for military assistance against Serbia and Greece. The ICC allowed their Dutch officers serving as the Albanian Gendarmerie to declare a state of emergency and stop the plot. They raided Vlor√´ on 7‚Äì8 January 1914, discovering more than 200 Ottoman troops and arrested Fikri. During Fikri's trial the plot emerged and an ICC military court under Colonel Willem de Veer condemned him to death and later commuted to life imprisonment, while Qemali and his cabinet resigned. After Qemali left the country, turmoil ensured throughout Albania.  Members  The Great Powers established the Commission of Control composed of the representatives of each Great Power and one Albanian. Members of the commission were: * L√©on- Alphonse-Thad√©e Krajewski (France) * Harry Harling Lamb (United Kingdom) * Alessandro Leoni (Italy) * Aleksandr Mihajloviƒç Petrjaev () (Russia) * Aristoteles Petroviƒá (Austria-Hungary) * Julius Winckel (Germany) * Mufid Libohova (Albania) When Prince Wilhelm of Wied took control over the Principality of Albania in March 1914, the Albanian representative (Libohova) was replaced by Mehdi Frash√´ri on March 17, 1914. After that change, all the other members of the commission remained in their positions until September 9, 1914, except the representative of the Austria-Hungary who resigned his position before May 25, 1914.  Administration  Picture of the negotiations that lead to the Protocol of Corfu between the International Commission of Control and Northern Epirote representatives. After gradually assuming the administration of the country in 1914, the International Commission prepared a draft of the constitution () with 216 articles. It would provide for establishment of the National Assembly with power of legislation in Albania which was designed as hereditary constitutional monarchy. According to the constitution, the country would have, with few exceptions, the same administrative organization as during the Ottoman Empire suzerainty. It would be partitioned into seven administrative districts, each of them would choose three representatives for the national assembly by direct suffrage. The prince would nominate ten representatives and the heads of all three religions (Islam, Orthodox and Catholic) would also be represented in the national assembly, which would have a four-year term. The Council of Ministers, with executive powers, would be appointed by the prince.  Protocol of Corfu  On May 17, after the Greeks living in southern Albania declared the Autonomous Republic of Northern Epirus, the Commission intervened in order to avoid escalation of the conflicts. As a result, the Protocol of Corfu was signed, which recognized the autonomous status of Albania's southern provinces, which consisted of Northern Epirus. Moreover, the execution and maintenance of this agreement was entrusted to the Commission.  End  With Albania in a state of civil war from July 1914, Greece occupying the south of the country, the Great Powers at war with one another, the regime collapsed and Prince William left the country on 3 September 1914, originally to Venice. Despite leaving Albania, he did so insisting that he remained head of state. In his proclamation, he informed the people that \\"he deemed it necessary to absent himself temporarily\\". The prince handed over the government to the International Commission of Control, and only three days, it dispersed.

Offices held Cliderhou belonged to a family which had been for one or two generations settled at Clitheroe in Lancashire, and he held the manor of Bayley near that town. In 1302 some land at Aighton was conveyed to him by W. de Mitton, and in 1307 he brought an action against three brothers, Ralph, William, and Geoffrey, of Bradenull, who had assaulted him when on the king's service, and had beaten him until they left him for dead. The offenders were ordered to pay him compensation. During the reigns of Edward I and Edward II he was one of the clerks of the Chancery. When he ceased to hold that office is not stated, but from the abstract of the proceedings at his trial in 1323 (Parl. Writs, i. pt. ii. 240) we learn that he had occupied it for thirty years. In 1311 he acted as one of the itinerant justices for the counties of Kent, Surrey, and Sussex, and in the following year he was summoned, as one of the clerks of the king's counsel, to a parliament held at Lincoln. Subsequently (in 1316?) he was appointed the king's escheator north of the Trent, and seems to have retained that position for about two years. Support for Lancaster =Trial= In 1321, at the time of the outbreak of hostilities between Thomas, Earl of Lancaster, and Edward II, Cliderhou was parson of Wigan, and seems to have been an active supporter of the earl's cause. After Lancaster's defeat and execution, the king appointed Sir Robert de Malberthorpe, Sir John Stonor, Sir Hervey de Stanton, and Robert Ayleston, as commissioners to make inquisition respecting those who had been guilty of abetting the rebellion (Rolls of Parliament, ii. 406; the matter is curiously misunderstood in Baines' 'Lancashire,' ed. John Harland, ii. 172). Cliderhou was one of those who were accused by the commissioners, and he was brought to Nottingham to take his trial at Michaelmas 1323. The charges against him were that he had preached in the church of Wigan in favour of the rebel cause, telling his parishioners that they owed allegiance to the earl, and promising absolution to all who supported him; and, further, that he had sent his son, Adam de Cliderhou, and another man-at-arms, with four footsoldiers, to join the rebel army. Cliderhou is said to have met both charges with a full denial. The jury, however, found him guilty, and he was imprisoned, but afterwards released on bail, the name of his son Adam appearing in the list of sureties. In November of the same year he presented himself for judgement, and agreed to a fine of three hundred Marks. =Redress= He, however, retained his benefice, and in the reign of Edward III (the date is not stated) presented a petition for redress of his grievances. He did not on this occasion deny having furnished military aid to the earl, but pleaded that in this respect he had only done what was required of him by his duty to his feudal superior. With regard to the charge of advocating rebellion in the pulpit, he asserted that he had merely exhorted the people to pray for a blessing on the earl and the other barons of the kingdom, and for the deliverance of the king from \\"poisonous counsel\\". He further stated that in order to raise money to pay the penalty imposed upon him he had had to sell his land; he had paid two hundred Marks into the exchequer, besides thirty Marks to the queen's treasury, and Sir Robert de Leyburn, the High Sheriff of Lancashire, had levied upon him the remaining hundred Marks, but had never paid over the sum into the exchequer. The answer to this petition was that as Cliderhou had voluntarily agreed to the fine (\\"fit fin de gre\\") nothing could be done. Later career In another petition in parliament (also of unknown date) Cliderhou asks that the burgesses of Wigan may be restrained from holding unlicensed markets, which competed injuriously with the market on Mondays, from which the parson was authorised by royal charter to receive tolls. It was answered that the parson had his remedy at common law. In 1331 he assigned to the monks of Cockersand Abbey his manor of Bayley, where he had built a chapel dedicated to St. John the Baptist. He died in or before 1339, in which year a chantry was founded at Bayley by Henry de Clyderhowe \\"for the repose of the soul of Robert, late rector of Wigan\\". Edward Foss says that in 1334 he recovered possession of some land at Clitheroe and Dinkley; but the person to whom this statement refers is another Robert de Cliderhou, who is frequently mentioned in documents belonging to the locality. As Robert was clearly a priest, it is singular that he should have had a son bearing his surname; possibly, as Foss suggests, Adam de Cliderhou may have been born before his father took orders.

In April 2001, he resigned after the pressure from the political leadership. On 25 March 2003, twelve days after the assassination of Zoran ƒêinƒëiƒá, the unit was disbanded. Zemun Clan connection and ƒêinƒëiƒá assassination On 12 March 2003, some members of JSO who were connected to the notorious Zemun Clan, organized the assassination of Zoran ƒêinƒëiƒá, with Ulemek being named the main organizer. Following the assassination, Ulemek was named the prime suspect and after 14 months of hiding, he surrendered in May 2004. Ulemek claimed that he had been hiding in his house the entire time, which made lot of controversy in public. The ƒêinƒëiƒá murder trial was the first organised crime trial in Serbia. The trial saw widespread threats to the trial chamber, as well as witness intimidation and the murder of a witness. The first trial chamber president, Marko Kljajeviƒá, left the proceedings in August 2005.

Life Isaack van Ruisdael was born in Naarden in the Dutch Republic in 1599. According to Arnold Houbraken he was the teacher of Isaac Koene, and, assuming Houbraken meant Isaack when he referred to the father of Jacob, he was a woodworker specialized in making fancy ebony frames for mirrors and paintings. Isaack van Ruisdael Biography in De groote schouburgh der Nederlantsche konstschilders en schilderessen (1718) by Arnold Houbraken, courtesy of the Digital library for Dutch literature Isaack sent his sons to learn Latin and medicine, and they both became landscape painters, specialized in ruis-daal, or trickling water through a dale, after their name. According to the Netherlands Institute for Art History (Dutch abbreviation, RKD), Houbraken confused the members of the family Ruysdael.Isaack van Ruisdael, Netherlands Institute for Art History, 2015. Retrieved 7 January 2016. Isaack was the brother of Salomon, and they both had sons named Jacob. Their father was also called Jacob, but his name was Gooyer, not Ruisdael. Isaack and Salomon changed their name from Gooyer to Ruisdael when they moved to Haarlem, where they both became landscape painters, though it is also possible that Isaack kept doing business in picture frames, since at the time they were painting, there was a high demand for painter's panels and frames in Haarlem. Ruisdael was buried in Haarlem on 4 October 1677.

Biography Dimmick was born in Honesdale, Pennsylvania. He was the son of Samuel E. Dimmick, a Pennsylvania Attorney General. Dimmick was a Mayor of Scranton during a cholera epidemic. Dimmick had successfully run for Mayor of Scranton in 1906 with a specific aim of improving Scranton's sewerage system. Dimmick, Scranton's thirteenth mayor served until 1909. In 1914 Boies Penrose was re- elected as the Republican senator for Pennsylvania in preference to Dimmick. Dimmick took the message of the defeat and afterwards confined himself to local politics and public speaking. Dimmick died in Stratford, Ontario in 1920 and left a wife and two daughters. His widowed sister in law became Mary Dimmick Harrison when she married the former President of the United States, Benjamin Harrison.

A GNSS receiver, in general, is an electronic device that receives and digitally processes the signals from a navigation satellite constellation in order to provide position, velocity and time (of the receiver). GNSS receivers have been traditionally implemented in hardware: a hardware GNSS receiver is conceived as a dedicated chip that have been designed and built (from the very beginning) with the only purpose of being a GNSS receiver. In a software GNSS receiver, all digital processing is performed by a general purpose microprocessor. In this approach, a small amount of inexpensive hardware is still needed, known as the frontend, that digitizes the signal from the satellites. The microprocessor can then work on this raw digital stream to implement the GNSS functionality.  Hardware vs. software GNSS receivers When comparing hardware vs software GNSS receivers, a number of pros and cons can be found for each approach: * Hardware GNSS receivers are in general more efficient from the point of view of both computational load and power consumption since they have been designed in a highly specialized way with the only purpose of implementing the GNSS processing. * Software GNSS receivers allow a huge flexibility: many features of the receiver can be modified just through software. This provides the receiver with adaptive capabilities, depending on the user's needs and working conditions. In addition, the receiver can be easily upgraded via software.Real-Time Software Receivers, GPS World, September 1, 2009 by Pierre-Andr√© Farine, Marcel Baracchi-Frei, Gr√©goire Waelchli, Cyril Botteron * Under some assumptions, Software GNSS receivers can be more profitable for some applications, as long as sufficient computational power is available (and can be shared among multiple applications). For example, the microprocessor of a smartphone can be used to provide GNSS navigation with the only need of including a frontend (instead of a full, more expensive, hardware receiver). Currently, most of the GNSS receiver market is still hardware. However, there already exist operational solutions based on the software approach able to run on low-cost microprocessors. Software GNSS receivers are expected to increase their market share or even take over in the near future, following the development of the computational capabilities of the microprocessors (Moore's law).
