It is a merger of two former parks, the Kalmthoutse Heide in Belgium and De Zoom in the Netherlands, together extending over . A very large part of the park is covered with heath. The park is managed by a special commission in which both Flemish and Dutch organisations are represented. The park is owned by the state of Flanders, the municipality Kalmthout, Staatsbosbeheer, Natuurmonumenten and several private owners. The best known part of the border park lies in Belgium, in the north of the province of Antwerp (Kalmthout and Essen). The Dutch part lies in the municipality Woensdrecht (province North Brabant) and stretches from the border to the villages Huijbergen and Putte. Fauna As we walk in the Kalmthoutse Heide, we can notice some remarkable species, such as Smooth snake, Viviparous lizard and Crested newt, as well as Moor frog. Rare butterfly species are Green hairstreak, Grayling, Silver- studded blue, Chequered skipper and Clouded yellow. In nearby nature reserves, we can find even rarer species: Klein Schietveld: Grizzled skipper: one of the largest and last remaining populations of this species in Flanders. Groot Schietveld: Alcon blue: even threatened on European scale and ofcours very restricted in Flanders: only found in the north-east of Belgium. This species used to occur in the wet heathlands of the Kalmthoutse Heide, but because of the lack of larval foodplants, this species is now considered extinct, even though occasionally eggs are found.

Its origin is the subject of a debate, as some sources attribute the origin to the hamlet of Findon, Aberdeenshire, (also sometimes called Finnan) near Aberdeen,\\"Before bringing this introductory letter to a close, I shall remind the Stranger of the opportunity which he now so happily enjoys, of eating, in all their perfection, the far- famed Finnan Haddocks. These, he may be informed, are prepared at a small fishing village called Finnan, or Findon, about six miles to the south; and, like Rowland's 'Incomparable Oil Macassar,' have been the subject of innumerable imitations, 'of the most deleterious tendency.'\\" while others insist that the name is a corruption of the village name of Findhorn at the mouth of the River Findhorn in Moray.\\"Late as the hour was (and it was long past midnight), the whole family were still on foot, and far from proposing to go to bed; the dame was still busy broiling car-cakes on the girdle, and the elder girl, the half-naked mermaid elsewhere commemorated, was preparing a pile of Findhorn haddocks (that is, haddocks smoked with green wood), to be eaten along with these relishing provisions.\\" The \\"dispute\\" goes back to the eighteenth century, although it is hard to trace, as adherents fail to acknowledge even the possibility of the alternative view (except for the etymology note in the Oxford English Dictionary).\\"A place-name used attrib. apparently originally the name of the river Findhorn, or of a place so called on its banks; but confused with Findon, the name of a village in Kincardineshire\\". A testimonial in an early 20th century Boston cookbook describes the origin from a fire in a fish curing house in Portlethen, very near Findon. \\"Many years ago at a seaport town on the North Sea, Port Lethen, a fire occurred in one of the fish-curing houses, and partially burned the end of a structure which was piled full of lightly salted, freshly caught haddock, which were lying on beds of dry kelp.\\" Griffin, J. H. Recipes for Sea Food. Boston: Freeman & Cobb Co., 1913. https://archive.org/stream/recipesforseafoo00free#page/n175/mode/2up It may have been a popular dish in Aberdeenshire since at least as early as the 1640s.Perhaps the first reference to Finnan haddie, being served for breakfast at a country pub in 1643 Although known and admired in Scotland for a long time, Finnan haddie became a popular food item in London only in the 1830s. In earlier times, because of the light smoking that the fish received, it did not have a long shelf life—by most contemporary estimates, at most three days (although some suggested no more than one day). Thus, although the fish was often available in Aberdeen \\"within twelve hours of being [caught]\\", the distance to London was at that time nearly insurmountable if spoilage was to be avoided. The fish started making its first appearances in London when shipped by established mail coach, but became widely available with the construction of the railway link connecting Aberdeen to London in the 1840s. The association with Findon became strong because of the Aberdeen connection. Occasionally, confusion was so deep that Findon was referred to as Findhorn. Finnan has a long association with the traditional Scottish fish soup, Cullen skink and most old Scottish recipe books cite Finnan haddie as the smoked haddock to be used for this dish. The traditional preparation is to roast or grill the whole pieces of fish over high heat. Finnan haddie is also often served poached in milk for breakfast For many families, milk poached finnan haddie is a traditional Christmas breakfast, served with fried scones. In many areas of America finnan haddie is only available in grocery stores in the week or two before Christmas. Full recipe for Finnan Haddie from Scottish chef John Quigley and is an important part of traditional kedgeree and the Arnold Bennett omelette. In popular culture Finnan haddie is used as a sexual double entendre in the Cole Porter song \\"My Heart Belongs to Daddy\\", and is mentioned in the Lew Pollack/Sidney D. Mitchell song \\"At the Codfish Ball\\", as well as in Otto Preminger's 1953 comedy, \\"The Moon Is Blue\\". It was also humorously referenced in the title of the 1942 Warner Brothers cartoon Fin'n Catty, directed by Chuck Jones, as well as the Paramount movie \\"Finn and Hattie\\" (1931). It's mentioned in the song \\"My Heart Belongs to Daddy\\" sung by various artists, including Marilyn Monroe and Julie London.

It also has authority to investigate incidents that could have resulted in accidents. Creation and remit The Cullen Report into the Ladbroke Grove rail crash in 1999 recommended the establishment of an accident investigation body within the Department for Transport along the same lines as the Marine Accident Investigation Branch and the Air Accident Investigation Branch, bodies that have distinguished themselves by their professionalism and objectivity. In 2003 Parliament legislated – in the Railways and Transport Safety Act 2003 – to create the RAIB as an independent body charged solely with establishing the facts of the case and assessing and evaluating causes, but not apportioning blame or establishing liability; nor does the RAIB enforce safety law or conduct prosecutions. The RAIB became operational on 17 October 2005.\\"Rail Accident Investigation Branch launched\\" Railways Illustrated issue 35 January 2006 page 19 Founding director was Carolyn Griffiths. Before then, railway accidents were investigated by Her Majesty's Railway Inspectorate (which in 1990 became part of the Health and Safety Executive but is now part of the Office of Rail and Road), and the British Transport Police (if there were grounds for suspecting the commission of a crime, which in some cases there were). Whilst the police must always be involved when there may have been a crime, the involvement of HMRI as the principal safety investigating agency attracted criticism on the grounds that the HSE might be investigating itself, if, for example, the HSE had approved a track layout or a signalling scheme later suspected to have been at fault. The RAIB also satisfies the government's duty under European Union legislation (the European Railway Safety Directive 2004/49/EC) to provide an independent rail accident investigation body that investigates incidents and accidents in a blame-free manner.

One theory states it arrived directly from Arabia before the 9th century, while another credits Sufi merchants and preachers for bringing Islam to Indonesian islands in the 12th or 13th century either from Gujarat in India or directly from the Middle East. Before the arrival of Islam, the predominant religions in Indonesia were Buddhism and Hinduism (particularly its Shaivism tradition). Initially, the spread of Islam was slow and gradual. Though historical documents are incomplete, the limited evidence suggests that the spread of Islam accelerated in the 15th century, as the military power of Melaka Sultanate in Malay Peninsular today Malaysia and other Islamic Sultanates dominated the region aided by episodes of Muslim coup such as in 1446, wars and superior control of maritime trading and ultimate markets. During 1511, Tome Pires found animists and Muslims in the north coast of Java. Some rulers were Islamized Muslims, others followed the old Hindu and Buddhist traditions. By the reign of Sultan Agung of Mataram, most of the older Hindu-Buddhist kingdoms of Indonesia, had at least nominally converted to Islam. The last one to do so was Makassar in 1605. After the fall of Majapahit empire, Bali became the refuge for the Hindu upper class, Brahmins and their followers that fled from Java, thus transferring the Hindu culture of Java to Bali. Hinduism and Buddhism remained extant in some areas of East Java where it syncretized with animism. Their traditions also continued in East and Central Java where they earlier held a sway. Animism was also practiced in remote areas of other islands of Indonesia. The spread of Islam in eastern islands of Indonesia is recorded in 1605 when three Islamic pious men collectively known as Dato' Tallu came to Makasar, namely Dato'ri Bandang (Abdul Makmur or Khatib Tunggal), Dato'ri Pattimang (Sulaiman Ali or Khatib Sulung) and Dato'ri Tiro (Abdul Jawad or Khatib Bungsu). According to Christian Pelras (1985), Dato' Tallu converted King of Gowa and Tallo to Islam and changed their name to Sultan Muhammad. The spread of Islam was initially driven by increasing trade links outside of the archipelago. Traders and the royalty of major kingdoms were usually the first to convert to Islam. Dominant kingdoms included Mataram in Central Java, and the sultanates of Ternate and Tidore in the Maluku Islands to the east. By the end of the 13th century, Islam had been established in North Sumatra; by the 14th in northeast Malaya, Brunei, the southern Philippines and among some courtiers of East Java; and the 15th in Malacca and other areas of the Malay Peninsula. Although it is known that the spread of Islam began in the west of the archipelago, the fragmentary evidence does not suggest a rolling wave of conversion through adjacent areas; rather, it suggests the process was complicated and slow. Despite being one of the most significant developments in Indonesian history, historical evidence is fragmentary and generally uninformative such that understandings of the coming of Islam to Indonesia are limited; there is considerable debate amongst scholars about what conclusions can be drawn about the conversion of Indonesian peoples. The primary evidence, at least of the earlier stages of the process, are gravestones and a few travellers' accounts, but these can only show that indigenous Muslims were in a certain place at a certain time. This evidence cannot explain more complicated matters such as how lifestyles were affected by the new religion or how deeply it affected societies. It cannot be assumed, for example, that because a ruler was known to be a Muslim, that the process of Islamisation of that area was complete; rather the process was, and remains to this day, continuous in Indonesia. Nevertheless, a clear turning point occurred when the Hindu empire Majapahit in Java fell to the Islamised Demak Sultanate. In 1527, the Muslim ruler renamed newly conquered Sunda Kelapa as Jayakarta (meaning \\"precious victory\\") which was eventually contracted to Jakarta. Assimilation increased rapidly in the wake of this conquest. Early history Samudera Pasai Sultanate map Both Indonesia's colonial and republican governments have favoured Hindu and Buddhist sites in Java in their allocation of resources for excavation and preservation, with less emphasis on the early history of Islam in Indonesia. Funds, both public and private, are spent on the construction of new mosques, rather than the exploration of old ones. Before Islam was established in Indonesian communities, Muslim traders had been present for several centuries. Ricklefs (1991) identifies two overlapping processes by which the Islamisation of Indonesia occurred: (1) Indonesians came into contact with Islam and converted, and (2) foreign Muslim Asians (Indians, Chinese, Arabs, etc.) settled in Indonesia and mixed with local communities. Islam is thought to have been present in Southeast Asia from early in the Islamic era. From the time of the third caliph of Islam, 'Uthman' (644-656), Muslim emissaries and merchants were arriving in China who must have passed through Indonesia sea routes from the Islamic world. It would have been through this contact that Arabic emissaries between 904 and the mid-12th century are thought to have become involved in the Sumatran trading state of Srivijaya. The earliest accounts of the Indonesian archipelago date from the Abbasid Caliphate. According to those early accounts, the Indonesian archipelago was famous among early Muslim sailors, mainly due to its abundance of precious spice trade commodities such as nutmeg, cloves, galangal and many other spices.http://gernot-katzers-spice- pages.com/engl/spice_geo.html#asia_southeastIbn Khordadbeh The presence of foreign Muslims in Indonesia does not, however, demonstrate a significant level of local conversion or the establishment of local Islamic states. The most reliable evidence of the early spread of Islam in Indonesia comes from inscriptions on tombstones and a limited number of travellers’ accounts. The earliest legibly inscribed tombstone is dated AH 475 (AD 1082), although as it belongs to a non-Indonesian Muslim, there is doubt as to whether it was transported to Java at a later time. The first evidence of Indonesian Muslims comes from northern Sumatra; Marco Polo, on his way home from China in 1292, reported at least one Muslim town; and the first evidence of a Muslim dynasty is the gravestone, dated AH 696 (AD 1297), of Sultan Malik al Saleh, the first Muslim ruler of Samudera Pasai Sultanate, with further gravestones indicating continued Islamic rule. The presence of the Shafi'i school of thought, which was to later dominate Indonesia, was reported by Ibn Battuta, a Moroccan traveller, in 1346. In his travel log, Ibn Battuta wrote that the ruler of Samudera Pasai was a Muslim who performs his religious duties with utmost zeal. The school of thought he used was Al-Shafi‘i with similar customs to those he had seen in India. Influences of Zheng He's voyages Stamps of Indonesia commemorating Zheng He's voyages to secure the maritime routes, usher urbanization and assist in creating a common prosperity. Zheng He is credited to have settled Chinese Muslim communities in Palembang and along the shores of Java, the Malay Peninsula, and the Philippines. These Muslims allegedly followed the Hanafi school in the Chinese language. This Chinese Muslim community was led by Hajji Yan Ying Yu, who urged his followers to assimilate and take local names. Zheng He (1371–1433 or 1435), originally named Ma He, was a Hui court eunuch, mariner, explorer, diplomat, and fleet admiral during China's early Ming dynasty. Zheng commanded expeditionary voyages to Southeast Asia, South Asia, Western Asia, and East Africa from 1405 to 1433. His larger ships stretched 400 feet in length (Columbus's Santa Maria, for comparison, was 85 feet). These carried hundreds of sailors on four tiers of decks. As a favorite of the Yongle Emperor, whose usurpation he assisted, he rose to the top of the imperial hierarchy and served as commander of the southern capital Nanjing (the capital was later moved to Beijing by the Yongle Emperor). These voyages were long neglected in official Chinese histories but have become well known in China and abroad since the publication of Liang Qichao's Biography of Our Homeland's Great Navigator, Zheng He in 1904. A trilingual stele left by the navigator was discovered on the island of Sri Lanka shortly thereafter. By region It was initially believed that Islam penetrated Indonesian society in a largely peaceful way, (which is still largely true according to many scholars) and from the 14th century to the end of the 19th century the archipelago saw almost no organised Muslim missionary activity.Nieuwenhuijze (1958), p. 35. Later findings of scholars say that some parts of Java, i.e. Sundanese West Java and the kingdom of Majapahit on East Java was conquered by Javanese Muslims. The Hindu-Buddhist Sunda Kingdom of Pajajaran was conquered by Muslims in the 16th century, while the Muslim- coastal and Hindu-Buddhist-interior part of East Java was often at war. Organised spread of Islam is also evident by the existence of the Wali Sanga (nine holy patriarchs) who are credited for the Islamisation of Indonesia during this period.Ricklefs, M.C. History of Modern Indonesia Since c.1200. P.8. =Northern Sumatra= Mosque in West Sumatra with traditional Minangkabau architecture Firmer evidence documenting continued cultural transitions comes from two late-14th century gravestones from Minye Tujoh in North Sumatra, each with Islamic inscriptions but in Indian-type characters and the other Arabic. Dating from the 14th century, tombstones in Brunei, Terengganu (northeast Malaysia) and East Java are evidence of Islam's spread. The Trengganu stone has a predominance of Sanskrit over Arabic words, suggesting the representation of the introduction of Islamic law. According to the Ying-yai Sheng-lan: The overall survey of the ocean's shores' (1433) a written account by Zheng He's chronicler and translator Ma Huan: \\"the main states of the northern part of Sumatra were already Islamic Sultanates. In 1414, he visited the Malacca Sultanate, its ruler Iskandar Shah was Muslim and also his people, and they were very strict believers\\". In Kampong Pande, the tombstone of Sultan Firman Syah, the grandson of Sultan Johan Syah, has an inscription stating that Banda Aceh was the capital of the Kingdom of Aceh Darussalam and that it was built on Friday, 1 Ramadhan (22 April 1205) by Sultan Johan Syah after he defeated the Hindu and Buddhist Kingdom of Indra Purba whose capital was Bandar Lamuri. The establishment of further Islamic states in North Sumatra is documented by late 15th- and 16th-century graves including those of the first and second Sultans of Pedir; Muzaffar Syah, buried (1497) and Ma’ruf Syah, buried (1511). Aceh was founded in the early 16th century and would later become the most powerful North Sumatran state and one of the most powerful in the whole Malay archipelago. The Aceh Empire's first sultan was Ali Mughayat Syah whose tombstone is dated (1530). The book of Portuguese apothecary Tomé Pires that documents his observations of Java and Sumatra from his 1512 to 1515 visits, is considered one of the most important sources on the spread of Islam in Indonesia. In 1520, Ali Mughayat Syah started military campaigns to dominate the northern part of Sumatra. He conquered Daya, and submitted the people to Islam.http://www.kitlv.nl/pdf_documents/asia.acehnese.pdf Further conquests extended down the east coast, like Pidie and Pasai incorporating several pepper-producing and gold-producing regions. The addition of such regions ultimately led to internal tensions within the Sultanate, as Aceh's strength was as a trading port, whose economic interests vary from those of producing ports. At this time, according to Pires, most Sumatran kings were Muslim; from Aceh and south along the east coast to Palembang the rulers were Muslim, while south of Palembang and around the southern tip of Sumatra and up the west coast, most were not. In other Sumatran kingdoms, such as Pasai and Minangkabau the rulers were Muslim although at that stage their subjects and peoples of neighbouring areas were not, however, it was reported that the religion was continually gaining new adherents. After the arrival of the Portuguese colonials and the tensions that followed regarding control of the spice trade, the Acehnese Sultan Alauddin al-Kahar (1539–71) sent an embassy to the Ottoman Sultan Suleiman the Magnificent in 1564, requesting Ottoman support against the Portuguese Empire. The Ottomans then dispatched their admiral Kurtoğlu Hızır Reis he set sail with a force of 22 ships carrying soldiers, military equipment and other supplies. According to accounts written by the Portuguese Admiral Fernão Mendes Pinto, the Ottoman fleet that first arrived in Aceh consisted of a few Turks and largely of Muslims from the ports of the Indian Ocean. =East Sumatra and Malay peninsula= Founded around the beginning of the 15th century by Sultan Parameswara, the great Malay trading state The Sultanate of Malacca founded by Sultan Parameswara, was, as the most important trading centre of the Southeast Asian archipelago, a centre of foreign Muslims, and it thus appears a supporter of the spread of Islam. Parameswara, himself is known to have converted to Islam, and taken the name Iskandar Shah after the arrival of the Hui-Chinese Admiral Zheng He. From Malacca and elsewhere, gravestones survive showing not only its spread in the Malay archipelago but as the religion of a number of cultures and their rulers in the late 15th century. =Central and eastern Java= Demak, the first Muslim state in Java Inscriptions in Old Javanese rather than Arabic on a significant series of gravestones dating back to 1369 in East Java, indicate that these are almost certainly Javanese, rather than foreign Muslims. Due to their elaborate decorations and proximity to the site of the former Hindu- Buddhist Majapahit capital, Damais concludes that these are the graves of very distinguished Javanese, perhaps even royalty.Damais, Louis-Charles, 'Études javanaises, I: Les tombes musulmanes datées de Trålåjå.' BEFEO, vol. 54 (1968), pp. 567-604. This suggests that some of the Javanese elite adopted Islam at a time when the Hindu-Buddhist Majapahit was at the height of its glory. Ricklefs (1991) argues that these east Javan gravestones, sited and dated at the non-coastal Majapahit, cast doubt on the long-held view that Islam in Java originated on the coast and represented political and religious opposition to the kingdom. As a kingdom with far-reaching political and trading contacts, Majapahit would have almost certainly been in contact with Muslim traders, however there is conjecture over the likelihood of its sophisticated courtiers being attracted to a religion of merchants. Rather, mystical Sufi Muslim teachers, possibly claiming supernatural powers (keramat), are thought to be a more probable agent of religious conversion of Javanese court elites, who had long been familiar with aspects of Hindu and Buddhist mysticism. Central and East Java, the areas where the ethnic Javanese lived, was still claimed by the Hindu-Buddhist king living in the interior of east java at Daha. The coastal areas such as Surabaya were, however, Islamised and were often at war with the interior, except for Tuban, which remained loyal to the Hindu-Buddhist king. Some of the coastal Muslim lords were converted Javanese, or Muslim Chinese, Indians, Arabs, and Malays who had settled and established their trading state on the coast. This war between the Muslim-coast and Hindu-Buddhist interior also continued long after the fall of the Majapahit by the Demak Sultanate, and the animosity also continues long after both regions had adopted Islam. When the peoples of the north coast of Java adopted Islam is unclear. Chinese Muslim, Ma Huan and envoy of the Yongle Emperor of China, visited the Java coast in 1416 and reported in his book, Ying-yai Sheng-lan: The overall survey of the ocean's shores' (1433), that there were only three types of people in Java: Muslims from the west, Chinese (some Muslim) and the heathen Javanese.Ma Huan’s, Ying-yai Sheng-lan: The overall survey of the ocean's shores' (1433). Ed. and transl. J.V.G. Mills. Cambridge: University Press, 1970 Since the east Javan gravestones were those of Javanese Muslims fifty years before, Ma Huan's report indicates that Islam may have indeed been adopted by Javanese courtiers before the coastal Javanese. An early Muslim gravestone dated AH 822 (AD 1419) has been found at Gresik an East Javanese port and marks the burial of Malik Ibrahim. As it appears, however, that he was non-Javanese foreigner, the gravestone does not provide evidence of coastal Javanese conversion. Malik Ibrahim was, however, according to Javanese tradition one of the first nine apostles of Islam in Java (the Wali Sanga) although no documentary evidence exists for this tradition. In the late 15th century, the powerful Majapahit empire in Java was at its decline. After had been defeated in several battles, the last Hindu kingdom in Java fell under the rising power of Islamised Kingdom of Demak in 1520. =The Da'wah of Walisongo= The question is: why only in the period of 40–50 years, Islam can be received so widespread in Java, whereas before it was very difficult to develop? One significant key-factor of the success of Da'wah of Walisongo is how the Walisongo develop an abandoned civilization of Majapahit into a new civilization whose roots form the Majapahit but with Islamic characteristics. For example, until the early Demak era, society is divided into two major groups, such as Majapahit era. First, the Group of Gusti, namely people who live in the palace. Secondly, the Group of Kawula, people who live outside the palace. Gusti means master, Kawula means slaves or servants, who only have the right to lease, not the right of ownership, because the right of ownership is only belongs to the people with the social status of (Gusti). In the era of Majapahit, all property is owned by the palace (state, or nation, or the kingdom). And if the king wants to give a deserving subject, then by the King's order that person will be given sima land or perdikan land (fief). This also means, if he had been a Kawula, his social status will rise, and he will become a Gusti, and he also has the right of ownership as he was given the simah land (fief). Walisongo, especially Sheikh Siti Jenar and Sunan Kalijaga, created a new perspective in the cultural and society structure. From the cultural and society structure of \\"gusti and kawula\\", they introduce the new community structure which is so- called \\"Masyarakat\\", derived from the Arabic term of Musharaka, which means the community of equal and mutual cooperation. It is proven by the absence of the term of \\"masyarakat\\", \\"rakyat\\", and so on in the Javanese Kawi vocabulary. It's a new term that was brought by Walisongo during their Dha'wah. One of the methods that were used by the Walisongo is by changing the mindset of the society. People with social status of Gusti pronoun themselves as: intahulun, kulun or ingsun. While the people with social status of Kawula pronoun themselves as: kula or kawula (Javanese), abdi (Sundanese), saya or sahaya (Sumatran): hamba or ambo (Minangkabau). Walisongo changes all those self pronunciation or designation which indicates the meaning of slaves, and replaced it with the term of ingsun, aku, kulun, or awak, and other designations that do not represent the identity of slaves or persons with lower social status. That is the concept of society of Walisongo, society or community of equal and mutual cooperation, which does not possess any discriminations nor discriminate the terms of self designation between subject classes such \\"gusti and kawula\\", which is called \\"Masyarakat\\". In present days, the term of kula, ambo, abdi, hamba, sahaya or saya, are still being used for the purpose of showing respect toward others, for example: while speaking toward someone older, parents, strangers, and so on. At the time of Majapahit, in addition to class gusti, people do not have property rights, such as houses, cattle, and so on, because all of them belonged to the palace. If the palace had intent, like wanting to build a bridge or temple and require the sacrifice, the children of class subjects taken and victimized. By changing the structure of society, class subjects can finally rejected because of the equality of the new society system. The Javanese in the era of Majapahit are known to be very arrogant. Their principle of life is \\"Adigang Adigung Adiguna\\" (superior in power, authority, and knowledge). They are very proud to have been able to subdue and or humiliate others. According to the testimony of Antonio Pigafetta, at that time, there's no one is as arrogant exceed the Javanese. If they were walking, and there's also people from another nation who walk at a higher place, they will be ordered to get down. and if they refuse, they will be killed. That is the character of the Javanese. So in old Javanese Kawi, there's no term of \\"kalah\\" (\\"lose\\"). If someone at odds with others, then there is only \\"win\\" or \\"dead\\". As Ma Huan noted, in Chao-wa (Java) if a man touches their head with his hand, or if there is a misunderstanding about money at a sale, or a battle of words when they are crazy with drunkenness, they at once pull out their knives and stab [each other]. He who is stronger prevails. When [one] man is stabbed to death, if the [other] man runs away and conceals himself for three days before emerging, then he does not forfeit his life; [but] if he is seized at the very moment [of the stabbing], he too is instantly stabbed to death. The country has no [such] punishment as flogging; no [matter whether] the offence be great or small, they tie both [the offender's] hands behind his back with a fine rattan, and hustle him away for several paces, then they take a pu-la-t’ou and stab the offender once or twice in the small of the back or in the floating ribs, causing instant death. According to the local custom of the country no day [passes] without a man being put to death; [it is] very terrible. Walisongo then develop the terms of \\"ngalah\\" (\\"NgAllah\\"). It is not derived from the word of \\"kalah\\" such as in bahasa Indonesia. But it comes from the Javanese prefix \\"Ng\\" which means toward (a purpose, and or destination), for example: ng-alas (toward the forest), ng-awang (toward the clouds), and Ng- Allah means toward Allah (tawakkal), the word \\"ngalah\\" itself was then used by the Javanese as an expression in avoiding conflict. The other evidence of the arrogance of the Javanese is represented during the time when envoys from China (Meng Xi) came in order to deliver a message from their king (Kubilai Khan) to the king of Singasari (Kertanegara). The messages ordered Kertanegara to submit toward their kingdom. And in return, Meng Xi (the Chinese envoy) was wounded, humiliated, and sent back to China by Kertanegara (it is said that his ear was cut off instantly by Kertanegara himself). The term of Carok in Madura is also derived from the ancient Javanese Tradition. Carok in Javanese Kawi means fighting; Warok means a fighter; and Ken Arok means the leader of fighters. Therefore, Walisongo introduced a new term such as \\"sabar\\" (patient), \\"adil\\" (fair), 'tawadhu', including \\"ngalah\\" or ngAllah (avoiding conflict). Walisongo sees that Hinduism and Buddhism actually were only embraced by the Gusti society inside the palaces. The common religion that generally embraced by the general population outside the palace is Kapitayan, a religion whose devotee toward Sang Hyang Taya. Taya means \\"suwung\\" (empty). God of Kapitayan is abstract, it can not be described. Sang Hyang Taya is defined simply as \\"tan keno kinaya ngapa\\", it can not be seen, thought, nor imagined. And the might of Sang Hyang Taya whose then represent in various places, such as in stone, monument, trees, and in many other places in this world. Therefore, they makes their offerings over those place, not because they worshiping the stones, trees, monuments, or anything else, but they did it as their devotion toward Sang Hyang Taya whose his might is represent in all over those places. An exactly similar concept of Brahman is found in Hinduism. This Kapitayan religion, is the ancient religion, in which is studied in the archaeological study, whose its archeological remains and legacy in Western terminology is known as dormant, menhirs, sarcophagus, and many others in which indicates that there is an ancient religion around that place. And by the Dutch historian, this religion is referred to as animism and dynamism, because it worships trees, rocks, and spirits. Meanwhile, according to Ma Huan, such practices are called as nonbeliever. These Kapitayan's religious values was then adopted by the Walisongo in spreading Islam toward the regions. Because the concept of tawhid in Kapitayan is basically same with the concept of tawhid in Islam: the term of \\"Tan keno kinaya ngapa\\" in Kapitayan (\\"can't be seen, can't be thought, can't be imagined, He is beyond everything\\"), have the same equal meaning as \\"laisa kamitslihi syai'un\\" in Islam (\\"There is nothing like unto Him\\"; Qur'an Surah Ash-Syura chapter 42 verse 11). Walisongo also use the term \\"Sembahyang\\" (worshipping Sang Hyang Taya in Kapitayan) in introducing the term of \\"Shalat\\" in Islam. In term of places for worship or praying, Walisongo also using the term Sanggar in Kapitayan, which represents a four-square building with an empty hole on its wall as the symbol of Sang Hyang Taya in Kapitayan, not arca or statues as in Hindu or Buddhism. This term of place for praying or worshipping in Kapitayan also used by Walisongo by the name \\"Langgar\\" represents the term of Masjid in Islam\\" There's also a ritual in form of not eating from morning up until night in Kapitayan, which is called as Upawasa (Puasa or Poso). Incidentally, the ritual of fasting in Hinduism is also called \\"Upawasa\\" or \\"Upavasa\\". Instead of using the term of fasting or Siyam in Islam, Walisongo used the term of Puasa or Upawasa from the Kapitayan in describing the ritual. The term of Poso Dino Pitu in Kapitayan whose means fasting on the day of the second and the fifth day in which is equal to seven days of fasting, is very similar with the form of fasting on Mondays and Thursdays in Islam. The Tradition of \\"Tumpengan\\" of Kapitayan was also being kept by the Walisongo under the Islamic perspective as known as \\"Sedekah\\". This is the meaning of the terminology in which Gus Dur (Indonesian fourth president) mentioned as \\"mempribumikan Islam\\" (Indigenize Islam). At the time of Majapahit, there is a ceremony which is called as \\"Sraddha\\", a ceremony that being held 12 years after a person's death. There is a time in the Majapahit history, during the Sraddha ceremony a King of Majapahit (Bhre Pamotan Sang Sinagara), a poet namely Mpu Tanakung, composed the \\"Kidung of Banawa Sekar\\" (The Ballad of Flowers Boat), to describe how the ceremony was carried out with full opulence and grandeur. This tradition was then called by society around the lakes and beach with the term Sadran or Nyadran (derived from the word Sraddha). Walisongo who derived from Champa also brought religious traditions, such as ceremonies of 3 days, 7 days, 40 days, 10 days, and 1000 days after someone's death. This is a tradition in which derived from Campa, not a native Javanese tradition, nor the Hindu tradition. Because these traditions also exist in parts of Central Asia, such as Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan. In the books of Tradition of Champa, such tradition has already exist since a very long time ago. In the history of Majapahit's superstition, there are only Yaksa, Pisacas, Wiwil, Rakshasha, Gandharwa, Bhuta, Khinnara, Widyadhara, Ilu-Ilu, Dewayoni, Banaspati, and ancestral spirits, in which known by the people of Majapahit. The people of Majapahit was very rational. They all were sailors and get to know people from all across the globe such as Japan, India, China, Africa, Arabia, Pacific Ocean and many other place. In the Islamic era that detracted from Champa a lot of new superstition appears, such as pocong. This is clearly derived from the Muslim faith, because in Majapahit the dead was burned and not covered with sheet. There are also many other superstition like kuntilanak, tuyul, including the legend of Nyai Roro Kidul or Queen of the Southern Sea who came later. During the Dha'wah of Walisongo, Islam was spread without any force of arms, not even a single drip of blood was spilled. Only after the Dutch period, especially after the Diponegoro War, the Dutch really run out of funds, they even owe millions of Goldens because of it. And even after Prince Diponegoro arrested, his remains were never subject. The Dutch finally deconstructing the stories about Walisongo, as in Babad Kediri. From this Babad Kediri, it was then emerged the book chronicle of Darmo Gandul and Suluk Gatholoco. the one who authored the book is named Ngabdullah, a person from Pati East Java, who because of poverty, making it lapsed and leaves Islam. He later renamed by the name of Ki Tunggul Wulung and settled in Kediri. In the essay fiber, there are many stories that contrary to historical fact, such as Demak attacked Majapahit 1478 and the emergence of a fictional character Sabdo Palon Naya Genggong who swore that 500 years after the attack, Majapahit will bounce back. Yet according to the more authentic script and more ancient, in that year that attacked Majapahit is King Girindrawardhana, the Hindu king of Kediri. And because of the very strong influence of that tale, it makes President Soeharto, the second president of Indonesia was very confident so that he sets pass of Aliran Kepercayaan (Beliefs) in Indonesia in the year 1978 (500 years after 1478), as a symbol of truth of the oath of Sabdo Palon about the resurrection of Majapahit. Secretly, it turns out the Dutch make history essay of themselves to confuse the struggle of Muslims, especially the followers of Prince Diponegoro. The Dutch even made Babad Tanah Jawi of their own version, which is different from the original Babad Tanah Jawi. For example, the text of the Kidung Sunda, described the event of Bubad War, it is said that Gajah Mada kill the King of Sunda and his entire family. This is what makes the people of Sunda harbored a grudge against the people of Java. Tracking back from its historical record, the text itself only appeared in Bali in 1860, made by the order of the Dutch. Sunda is a great kingdom, if such an event was truly ever happened, it must have been written by the Kingdom of Sunda. The Kingdom of Sunda was very detail in describing its historical records. Even the Traditions of Sunda was written in very detail in the manuscript of \\"Sanghyang Siksa Kanda ng Karesyan\\". How come such great event was never mentioned even once in the Chronicle of Sunda (Babad Sunda). The event itself was never mentioned in the Chronicles of Majapahit, nor in any other historical records. Again, this is the tactic of the Dutch in dividing the society by creating a false history as part of the Dutch policy \\"Divide and Conquer\\". From all of the distortion of history, all must have originated from a script written by the Dutch post-Diponegoro War. In metallurgical technology smelting iron and steel, for example, people of Majapahit had already possess the ability of creating the Majapahit's heritage, such as keris, spears, arrows, even barunastra, a giant tipped steel arrows that functioned like an underwater torpedo, in which when it was fired, it have the ability to penetrate and bilge the ship. Demak kingdom as the descendants of Majapahit has the ability to create a large caliber of cannons in which exported to Malacca, Pasai, even Japan. The fact that Japanese bought guns from Demak sourced from the record of the Portuguese, during the conquered of the Port of Malacca, the Portuguese intelligences sourced that the Malacca fortress was complemented by large-size of cannons imported from Java. When the Portuguese was just newly arrived from Europe, their ships were uprooted by cannon fires when approaching the port of Malacca. The proof of this can be seen in Fort Surosowan Banten, where in front of it there is a giant cannon named \\"Ki Amok\\". As an illustration of the magnitude of the cannon, people can get into the cannon holes. Even the imperial seal of the Kingdom of Demak still clearly attached on the cannon, which is made in Jepara, a region in the Kingdom of Demak whose famous by its craftsmanship. The term of \\"bedil besar\\" (\\"big guns\\") and \\"jurumudi ning bedil besar\\" (\\"the driver of the big guns\\") describes \\"cannon\\" and \\"cannon operators\\". That was the military technology during the era of Walisongo. Majapahit famous puppet show is \\"Wayang Beber\\", whereas during the Walisongo era is \\"Wayang Kulit\\". Walisongo also changed the story of Mahabharata his in which is different from the original version of India. In the Indian version, Five Pandavas have one wife, Draupadi. This means that the concept of polyandry. Walisongo change this concept by telling that Draupadi was the wife of Yudhishthira, the eldest brother. Werkudara or Bima has a wife namely Arimbi, who later he married again with Dewi Nagagini who have children Ontorejo and Ontoseno, and so on. Illustrated that all the Pandavas were polygamy. Whereas the original version, Draupadi polyandry with five Pandavas. Similarly, in the story of Ramayana. Hanuman has two fathers, namely King Kesari Maliawan and God Bayu. By Walisongo, Hanuman referred to as the son of God Bayu. Walisongo even make the pedigree that the gods were descendants of Adam. This can be seen on the Pakem Pewayangan (the grip of puppet show) Ringgit Purwa at Pustaka Raja Purwa in Solo, which is a grip for every puppet masters in Java. So the grip that was used by the puppeteers in Java was the Pakem derived from Walisongo, not India. This puppet spectacle, not only as an entertainment but also functioned as guidance in the propagation of Islam by Walisongo. In context of literary, the kingdom of Majapahit had already created Kakawin and Kidung. By Walisongo, this literary richness was then enriched by the making of variety of song compositions, such as \\"Tembang Gedhe\\" (great song composition), \\"Tembang Tengahan\\" (mid song composition), and \\"Tembang Alit\\" (short song composition). Macapat flourished in coastal areas. Kakawin and Kidung could only be understood by a poet. But for the Tembang, even an illiterate people can understand. This is the method of Walisongo Propagation through the arts and culture. Another example of the Dha'wah of Walisongo is Slametan which is developed by Sunan Bonang and then followed by the other Sunans. In the Tantrayana (Tantric) religion embraced by kings of Nusantara archipelago, there's a sect in that Tantric religion which is called the Bhairawa Tantra sect that worships the Goddess of Earth, Goddess Durga, Goddess Kali, and others Gods. They have a rituals where they were creating a circle called Ksetra. The largest Ksetra in Majapahit is Ksetralaya, the place today is called Troloyo. The ritual ceremony itself was known as Upacara Panchamakara (the ceremony of five ma, the malima), namely Mamsya (meat), Matsya (fish), Madya (wine), Maithuna (sexual intercourse), and Mudra (meditation). Men and women formed a circle and all naked. In the center is provided meat, fish, and wine. After eating and drinking, they have sexual intercourse (maituna). After satisfying various desires, they meditated. For higher levels, they were using human flesh for Mamsya replacing meat, Sura fish (shark) for Matsa, and human blood for Madya replacing wine. At Indonesian National Museum in Jakarta, there is a statue of a character named Adityawarman height of three meters and stands on a pile of skulls. He is the priest of the Bhairawa Tantra, the one who performed the teaching of malima. He was inaugurated and then became the Bhairawa priest carrying the title of Wisesa Dharani, the ruler of the earth. The statue described that he sat on a pile of hundreds of corpses, drinking blood, and laughing uproariously. Witnessing such situation, Sunan Bonang created a similar event. He entered the center of Bhairawa Tantra in Kediri. As formerly the center of the Bhairawa Tantra, no wonder if the slogan of the City of Kediri now is Canda Bhirawa. During his Dha'wah in Kediri, Sunan Bonang stayed in the west of the river, in the village of Singkal Nganjuk. There he held a similar ceremony, made the similar circle, but all of the participants were all males, in the center of the circle there is the food, and then they pray together. This is called the Kenduri Tradition (festivity tradition) or Slametan. Developed from village to village to match the ceremony of malima (Panchamakara). Therefore, Sunan Bonang was also known as Sunan Wadat Cakrawati, as the leader or imam of Chakra Iswara (Cakreswara). Therefore, in the rural areas, people can be considered as a Muslim if he's already stated the Islamic creed, circumcised, and Slametan. So malima was originally not Maling (thievery), Maen (gambling), Madon (adultery), Madat (consuming opium), and Mendem (drunk), but the five elements of Panchamakara. Islam was then growing even faster because the people do not want their children get victimized as in Bhairawa Tantra. Then, they prefer to join Slametan with the aim of \\"slamet\\" (safety). This is the way of Walisongo spreads Islam without violence. In conclusion, about 800 years Islam entered the archipelago, since the year 674 until Walisongo era in 1470, but has yet to be accepted by society en masse. It was then after the era of Walisongo, Islam developed so widespread in the archipelago. And until now, the teaching Walisongo is still run by the majority of Indonesian Muslims. =Western Java= Pires' Suma Oriental reports that Sundanese-speaking West Java was not Muslim in his day, and was indeed hostile to Islam. A Muslim conquest of the area occurred later in the 16th century. In the early 16th century, the Central and East Java (home of the Javanese) were still claimed by the Hindu- Buddhist king living in the interior of East Java at Daha (Kediri). The north coast was, however, Muslim as far as Surabaya and were often at war with the interior. Of these coastal Muslim lords, some were Javanese who had adopted Islam, and others were not originally Javanese but Muslim traders settling along established trading routes including Chinese, Indians, Arabs and Malays. According to Piers, these settlers and their descendants so admired Javanese Hindu-Buddhist culture that they emulate its style and were thus themselves becoming Javanese. In his study of the Banten Sultanate, Martin van Bruinessen focuses on the link between mystics and royalty, contrasting that Islamisation process with the one which prevailed elsewhere in Java: \\"In the case of Banten, the indigenous sources associate the tarekats not with trade and traders but with kings, magical power and political legitimation.\\" He presents evidence that Sunan Gunungjati was initiated into the Kubra, Shattari, and Naqshbandi orders of sufism. =Other areas= There is no evidence of the adoption of Islam by Indonesians before the 16th century in areas outside of Java, Sumatra, the sultanates of Ternate and Tidore in Maluku, and Brunei and the Malay Peninsula. Indonesian and Malay legends Although time frames for the establishment of Islam in Indonesian regions can be broadly determined, the historical primary sources cannot answer many specific questions, and considerable controversy surrounds the topic. Such sources do not explain why significant conversions of Indonesians to Islam did not begin until after several centuries of foreign Muslims visiting and living in Indonesia, nor do they adequately explain the origin and development of Indonesia's idiosyncratic strains of Islam, or how Islam came to be the dominant religion in Indonesia. To fill these gaps, many scholars turn to Malay and Indonesian legends surrounding Indonesian conversion to Islam. Ricklefs argues that although they are not reliable historical accounts of actual events, they are valuable in illuminating some of the events is through their shared insights into the nature of learning and magical powers, foreign origins and trade connections of the early teachers, and the conversion process that moved from the elite downwards. These also provide insight into how later generations of Indonesians view Islamisation. These sources include: * Hikayat Raja-raja Pasai (\\"The Story of the kings of Pasai\\") – an Old Malay text that tells how Islam came to \\"Samudra\\" (Pasai, northern Sumatra) where the first Indonesian Islamic state was founded. * Sejarah Melayu (\\"Malay History\\") – an Old Malay text, which like Hikayat Raja-raja Pasai tells the story of the conversion of Samudra, but also tells of the conversion of the King of Malacca. * Babad Tanah Jawi (\\"History of the land of Java\\") – a generic name for a large number of manuscripts, in which the first Javanese conversions are attributed to the Wali Sanga (\\"nine saints\\"). * Sejarah Banten (\\"History of Banten\\") – A Javanese text containing stories of conversion. Of the texts mentioned here, the Malay texts describe the conversion process as a significant watershed, signified by formal and tangible signs of conversion such as circumcision, the Confession of Faith, and the adoption of an Arabic name. On the other hand, while magical events still play a prominent role in the Javanese accounts of Islamisation, such turning points of conversion as in the Malay texts are otherwise not as evident. This suggests a more adsorptive process for the Javanese, that is consistent with the significantly larger syncretic element in contemporary Javanese Islam in comparison to the relatively orthodox Islam of Sumatra and Malaysia.

Amongst other things, Volume 2 of the Crimes Act deals with offences against the administration of justice in federal proceedings, piracy, offences relating to postal services, etc. Historically, it was the most extensive legislative instrument that dealt with federal offences, but is now being gradually superseded with the passing of the Criminal Code Act 1995 (Cth), which is a compilation of all the federal offences in Australia.  Constitutional Basis of Federal Criminal Law  The Crimes Act 1914 is one of many current Commonwealth legislation that deals with federal crimes in Australia. Generally, criminal law is a state-law matter, as State and Territory Governments are mandated under their respective constitutions to legislate for the peace, order, and good government of their respective jurisdictions. But, while there is no general constitutional basis for the Commonwealth to legislate in criminal law, federal legislation exists to deal with crimes of a federal nature. There are currently three main bases in the Australian Constitution that the Commonwealth Parliament relies on as the constitutional basis to legislate relating to criminal law. The first basis relied on is section 51(xxxix) (the 'incidental power'), the second basis is the implied incidental power under the heads of powers in sections 51 and 52 of the Constitution, and the third basis being executive power under section 61 of the Constitution.

East of Glen Oaks (past Lake Success) is the unincorporated neighborhood of North New Hyde Park. South of North New Hyde Park is the Village of New Hyde Park. So even though Glen Oaks shares various postal city names with Nassau County villages, it is not adjacent to those villages and is not politically related to them other than being in the same state.

Typically the district 26 schools have been ranked among the best in the NYC public school system. Several institutions on or near Union Turnpike are associated with Glen Oaks, though they are not actually in Glen Oaks. For example, Bellerose Jewish Center, the Glen Oaks branch of the Queens library, and Glen Oaks School (P.S. 115) are all in the Floral Park neighborhood. So are M.S. 172 and Our Lady of the Snows.

He was also the younger brother of Wilhelm Schauman.  Life  Ossian Schauman was born on 30 March 1862 in Jakobstad to the pharmacist and businessman Victor Schauman and his wife Elise Wilhelmina Schauman (née Ekelund), who had 13 children in total. The father died of heart failure before the age of 50, when Ossian Schauman was only 10 years old. There seems to have been a genetic heart defect running in the family, since both Ossian Schauman and several of his brothers also died before they had turned 60 years old. He displayed an interest in botany already at an early age, and could often be found tending to plants in the garden. In 1872, Ossian Schauman was admitted to the Wasa Lyceum (high school) at the age of 10. This was also the year in which his father died, which devastated Ossian and the rest of the family. After graduating from high school in 1879 at the age of 17, Schauman moved to Helsinki to continue his studies at the university. In 1888, he graduated with a first medical degree, and in 1894 he became an M.D. in internal medicine. In 1897 he became an assistant professor in medicin and then finally in 1908, a professor in internal medicine at the University of Helsinki, a position he held until his death.  Folkhälsan  Schauman was one of the founders of the non-governmental organization Folkhälsan, as well as its first chairman. In his will, he donated a sum of money for the purpose of creating and maintaining a Swedish speaking institute for genetic research. Folkhälsan's objective was to reduce infant mortality and to lower the incidence of tuberculosis in Finland. Today, Folkhälsan provides social welfare and health care services, and employs approximately 200 researchers, studying among others, genetically transmitted diseases and diseases caused by lifestyle. Folkhälsan funds its operations by selling services to cities and communes, including child and geriatric care. Additionally, Folkhälsan receives funding from the state owned chance games revenues, and donations. Sources * Ellonen, Leena (ed.): Suomen professorit 1640–2007, pp. 910–911.

It was serialized between January and April 1882 in the periodical Le Gaulois before being published in book form by Charpentier in 1883. The novel is an indictment of the mores of the bourgeoisie of the Second French Empire. It is set in a Parisian apartment building, a relatively new housing arrangement at the time and its title (roughly translating as stew pot) reflects the disparate and sometimes unpleasant elements lurking behind the building's new façade. Explanation of the novel's title Like Zola's earlier novel L'Assommoir (1877), the title is extremely difficult to render in English. The word pot-bouille is a 19th-century French slang term for a large cooking pot or cauldron used for preparing stews and casseroles and also the foods prepared in it. The title is intended to convey a sense of disparate ingredients, the various inhabitants of the building mixed together, to create a potent and heady mix like a strong stew. The impression is to hint at the greed, ambition and depravity which lies behind the pretentious façade of the outwardly well behaved bourgeois apartment block. There is no equivalent word in English to convey this. The closest English term would probably be an expression such as melting pot. In the 1937 film The Life of Emile Zola, the novel's title is rendered as Piping Hot. Plot summary Pot-Bouille recounts the activities of the residents of a block of flats in the Rue de Choiseul over the course of two years (1861–1863). The characters include: *The Campardons. Madame Campardon has a mysterious medical condition that keeps them from having sex. The husband is having an affair with her distant cousin, who eventually moves in and manages the household while continuing the affair. Despite their best efforts, they cannot conceal this arrangement from their daughter Angèle, who learns all the secrets in the building from the family servant. *The Duveyriers. Monsieur Duveyrier detests the bourgeois respectability of his wife's household, particularly her piano playing and takes refuge with a bohemian mistress Clarisse, an arrangement that suits his frigid wife perfectly. When Clarisse aspires to domesticity and respectability, Monsieur Duveyrier attempts suicide and later begins an affair with one of the maids. *The Josserands. Madame Josserand is relentless in her hunt to find husbands for her daughters. Zola compares the business of husband-hunting to prostitution and indeed Madame Josserand trots her daughters out in society to snare any man who will have them, under the cover of respectability and decorum. Madame Josserand instills her contempt for men (including her husband) in her younger daughter Berthe, who is able to compromise Auguste Vabre and force a marriage. *The Vabres (Théophile and Valérie). The wife, described as neurotic and somewhat hysterical, is involved in multiple, loveless affairs (it is common knowledge that her son is not her husband’s). The husband is a hypochondriac living in perpetual suspicion of his wife's behaviour. *The Pichons. Going through the motions of marriage, they have subjugated all passion in every aspect of their lives, including rearing their daughter, subduing any romance (Madame Pichon has an affinity for the novels of George Sand) beneath cold, hollow propriety. Condoning the behaviour of these characters are the local priest and doctor, who use their positions to cover up everyone's moral and physical failings. The characters' habits and secrets are also guarded by the concierge, who turns a blind eye to everything going on. The sham respectability of the residents is contrasted with the candour of their servants, who secretly abuse their employers over the open sewer of the building's inner courtyard. The novel follows the adventures of 22-year-old Octave Mouret, who moves into the building and takes a salesman's job at a nearby shop, The Ladies' Paradise (Au Bonheur des Dames). Though handsome and charming, Octave is rebuffed by Valérie Vabre and his boss's wife Madame Hédouin before beginning a passionless affair with Madame Pichon. His failure with Madame Hédouin prompts him to quit his job, and he goes to work for Auguste Vabre in the silk shop on the building's ground floor. Soon, he begins an affair with Berthe, who by now is Auguste's wife. Octave and Berthe are eventually caught but over the course of several months, the community tacitly agrees to forget the affair and live as if nothing had happened, thereby restoring the veneer of respectability. Octave marries widowed Madame Hédouin and life goes on in the Rue de Choiseul the way it has always done, with outward complacency, morality and quiet. Relation to the other Rougon-Macquart novels Zola's plan for the Rougon-Macquart novels was to show how heredity and environment worked on members of one family over the course of the Second Empire. The family representative in Pot- Bouille is Octave Mouret, first introduced briefly in La fortune des Rougon and playing a larger but background role in La conquête de Plassans. Octave is the son of first cousins Marthe Rougon and François Mouret and great-grandson of Adelaïde Fouque (Tante Dide), the ancestress from whom the family members inherit varying degrees of what today might be called obsessive-compulsive disorder. Zola describes him in Le docteur Pascal (the last novel) as an example of indirect heredity, bearing a physical resemblance to his uncle Eugène Rougon (Son Excellence Eugène Rougon). Like his uncle, Octave is obsessed with power, in the nephew's case over women. He is not ruthless or predatory but uses his charm and good looks to captivate women. This aspect of his personality is explored further in Au Bonheur des Dames, the next novel, which finds Octave the owner of a giant department store catering to female desire. (Octave also appears briefly or is mentioned in La faute de l'Abbé Mouret, La joie de vivre, L'œuvre and Le docteur Pascal.) In addition to examining Octave as representative of the Rougon-Macquart line, Zola explores the effects of personal history and environment on the other residents of the apartment building. Translations Pot-Bouille was translated into English by Henry Vizetelly in 1886 and Percy Pinkerton in 1895; both translations are available in reprints. There have been other English translations since (as Piping Hot!, Pot Luck, Restless House and Lesson in Love), the most recent being by Brian Nelson for Oxford World's Classics (1999). * Piping Hot!

Since 2019, the Bohemian Shepherd has been provisionally recognized by the FCI. History The Chodský pes is an old sheepdog breed. They have been also guarding Bohemian southwestern borders and homes in the area of the Chod region (around Domažlice town). \\"Chodové\\" (the Chods), the local people living there, had an exceptional permission to hold large dogs for this purpose. Alois Jirásek, writing about a brave uprising of the local people, even assigned these dogs as a flag symbol of them. Though that is actually incorrect, the symbol became part of national knowledge due to drawings of a well known Czech painter Mikoláš Aleš. The symbol of the Chodský pes is still on Czech young scout's badges. As the Chodský pes is an old breed, it is possibly also one of the predecessors to the German Shepherd with the Old German Herding landrace dogs. The Chodský pes is known to have existed in the Czech lands as far back as the 14th century, and having been professionally bred as early as the 16th century, centuries before the Germans decided to try to make their own national breed. A modern breeding program for this dog was started in 1984 and there are now many breeders. About 3500 registered pups have been born since the program started (1984–2009). Therefore, there is no proof that they are related to German Shepherds.  Description  =Appearance= Bohemian Shepherd dog The Bohemian Shepherd has a medium size and length (48–55 cm (19 to 22 inches) in height and weigh about 15–25 kg (35-55 lbs)). Long, thick fur and a rich undercoat allow him to survive in harsh weathers. The body is compact and well proportioned with high set, small, pointed, erect ears and a long, elegant neckline. A fluid, light and unhurried gait is one of the typical characteristics of this breed. =Temperament= This is an ideal dog for someone who is very active, this breed is energetic, is not aggressive, can be easily trained, and relates well to children and other pets. Its great agility and a keen sense of smell make it a very good rescue dog, a great companion for handicapped people and an outstanding watch dog. This breed has a stable, calm and friendly temperament that allows it to be good with the owner, his family and especially with children.

Plot The film starts with a voice (Kader Khan) narrating a small town of Mumbai. A gangster named Kanta (Sadashiv Amrapurkar) wants to destroy the town and is in a battle with Karanjia (Kulbhushan Kharbanda), who wants to replace the town with a shopping mall. Ramesh \\"Rama\\" Kulkarni (Samir Soni) returns to his town after several years and is greeted by all of his friends, neighbors and youngest sister, Pinky (Mamta Mishra). It's only Rama's father, Vinayak Kulkarni (Govind Namdeo), a school teacher, who does not greet him and is angered with Rama. A few days later, Rama's younger brother, Satish (Faisal Khan) returns after completing his studies. Rama begins guarding his town from the gangsters of the town. Karanjia hires Rama and gives him some money and weapons for his protection. Rama buys gifts for his family, but everyone refuses to take the gifts and they refuse him into his family. Rama decides to marry Madhu (Sanober Kabir), a girl who has fallen in love with Rama. During a festival of Shi'a Muslims, Kanta and his gangsters start terrorizing it. Rama and his friends began fighting Kanta's gangsters, until Rama is killed by Kanta's gangsters. Karanjia hires Satish, who decides to take the revenge of his brother's death. Satish is in love with a girl named Priya (Shama Sikander), whom Karanjia treats like his daughter. Satish's family gets destroyed, when his sister Pinky is raped by the Minister (Pramod Moutho) and his father is heartbroken at hearing the news. Pinky commits suicide and Satish's father dies by a heart attack. Satish is outraged and kills Police Commissioner (Ranjeet), who is replaced by the new Commissioner of Maharashtra, Jabbar (Rajendra Gupta). Karanjia has an evil plan to finish Kulkarni family and rule over the town, where his partnership with Kanta is revealed. Karanjia's goons set out to kill Satish, where Priya saves Satish and gets shot in heart by herself. It is thought that Satish is also dead. One day, Kanta and his goons start spreading terror in the town, until Satish fights with them and kills Kanta and his goons and is arrested for the murders by Commissioner Jabbar. After Satish is imprisoned by the court, Karanjia pretends to be sad for Satish, until Satish begins fighting Karanjia and shoots him with his gun. At the same time, Commissioner Jabbar shoots Satish. Both Satish and Karanjia fall and die. The film's moral is that crime should not exist and everyone should leave peacefully because the end is always bad.

It is situated to the east of Goa's capital Panjim at a distance of 20 kilometres. The Cumbharjua canal is well known as a habitat of the Indian mugger crocodile.  Location  A 20-km eastward drive from Panjim through Ribandar, Old Goa, Corlim, Banastarim, Tivrem and Marcel brings you into Cumbarjua via its bridged entrance. But the 13-km journey through the cool confines of Gandaulim and ferry crossing is what throws up a kind of vintage charm. Merely a stone’s throw away from each other, the Gandaulim-Cumbarjua distance across the crocodile-inhabited canal is perhaps the shortest navigated route in riverine Goa. Crocodile sightings are a common feature along the Cumbarjua canal, but an absolute rarity in the rest of the state.  History  The name 'Cumbarjua' is said to be derived from the Konkani word kumbhars (translation: potters), who inhabited the area. Cumbarjua’s history dates back to the early 15th century. On the west was Gandaulim which marked the fortified border of the Portuguese-ruled Goa island (Tiswadi), and on the east was Marcel, which demarcated the end of the Bijapur’s Adil Shah empire. Sandwiched between the two warring powers, the island, which was considered as no man’s land was often used as a launching pad for attacks on each other by the two aggressors. Later, attempts were also made to capture it and it continued to bear the brunt and scars of these battles. On 25 November 1510, the Cumbarjua island was annexed by the Portuguese from the Muslim king Adil Shah. After Cumbarjua was captured, the Portuguese began to develop it and the then Governor Diogo Lopes de Sequeira in 1545 handed it over to a Catholic priest Fr. George Dias Cabral, for three generations, with the condition that one-tenth of the produce were to be given to the government in the name of God annually. In the 19th century, Cumbarjua was divided into four pieces and sold. Out of that sale, one piece was bought by the rich Shenvi Kenkre family. Another portion of the less populated was bought by one Peres. Later circumstances forced them to sell it. Shenvi Kenkre’s land was auctioned by the civil court for non-payment of a loan and thus it was forfeited to the Shree Mangueshi Devasthan, Priol. Peres’ property was sold to the Naique family. After the sale and change of ownership, the Mangueshi temple committee imposed heavy taxes on the residents of the island. This made people, who could not afford to pay the taxes, move to Gaudalim. The temple used to collect taxes from all houses, both Hindu as well as Catholic, but if one would pay a 20-year tax in advance it was considered as life-time tax. Besides the Kenkres and the Peres’, Pratap Rao Sardessai, Shenvi Dhume, Bhandari, Prabhu Lawande, were the Hindu landlords and de Sa's, Alvare's and de Sousa's were the prominent Catholic landlords. Mashel and Cumbharjua have long hosted the Sangodd, a water parade that features floats created by tying two boats to each other. These floats feature scenes from Hindu mythology.  Demographics  In an area admeasuring 2,401,550 sq. metres, living in perfect harmony is a population of approximately 7,144 Cumbarjuemkars; out of which 85 per cent are Hindus and the rest Catholics; all peacefully settled in Talapwada, Surchem Bhat (which got its name from the whispering palms near the river), Golwada, Takwada, Khadap Wada, Rambhuvan Wada, Mollo wada, Gavant and Thapan wada. According to historian Vinayak Narayan Shenvi Dhume, in 1770, Cumbarjua was made up of 486 houses (400 Hindus + 86 Catholics). The Hindu families comprised Goud Saraswat caste of Smarth and Vaishnau, Daivajnas, blacksmiths, carpenters, Kunbis, Gaudas, potters, washermen, fishermen and cobblers. Of the 86 Catholic families, ten were those of washermen and five of potters. Muslims were a skeletal few.  Attractions  Cumbharjua is mainly known for its crocodile sightings, and as a habitat of the Indian mugger crocodile. The island is also known for the festival of Shantadurga Kumbharjuvekarin Devi Shishirotsav, which signifies the arrival of goddess Shantadurga Kumbharjuvekarin back to her home. Cumbharjua is also famous for its annual sangodd (boat festival), which is celebrated on the seventh day of Ganesh Chaturthi.

Uses  Evaporation ponds have several uses. Salt evaporation ponds produce salt from seawater. They are also used to dispose of brine from desalination plants. Mines use ponds to separate ore from water. Evaporation ponds at contaminated sites remove the water from hazardous waste, which greatly reduces its weight and volume and allows the waste to be more easily transported, treated and stored. Evaporation ponds can also be used to evaporate the precipitation that falls on a contaminated site. The contaminants that the water picks up on the ground are left behind after it evaporates. This prevents the contamination from spreading further down the watershed. Evaporation ponds are used to prevent pesticides, fertilizers and salts from agricultural wastewater from contaminating the water bodies they would flow into. In California, selenium in agricultural wastewater has been especially problematic, causing birth defects in waterfowl.

It occurred when a large piece of cargo, cast iron, fell from a wagon and derailed the following carriages. It happened on the Hull and Selby Railway as the train was travelling from Leeds to Hull. The crash was one of the first railway accidents to be investigated by the Railway Inspectorate. One of the worst accidents to have occurred on the new UK rail network, it was also a new phenomenon for the public, although shipwrecks and coal mining accidents were frequent. Investigation Sir Frederick Smith, the first head of the Railway Inspectorate (his formal job title was \\"Inspector-General of Railways\\") found that the casting had been insecurely lashed to the wagon, and was unstable for carrying by train. The casting was part of a weighing machine intended to be used at Hull Station, and itself weighed about 2.5 tons. It measured 12 feet 6.75 inches by 5 feet 7 inches, and since the wagon was only 10 feet by 7 feet 6 inches, it must have overhung the wagon when being carried. The casting fell from the wagon onto the rails when the train was about 3/4 mile from Howden station. Since the wagon was just behind the tender, the following passenger carriages were derailed. The first five carriages were empty, but the sixth carriage held several passengers, some of whom were fatally injured. Smith's report gave the total number of dead as four, but contemporary newspapers reported two separate inquests; one upon three people killed instantly, another upon two who died subsequently of their injuries.: the three killed instantly were named as Nicholas Veltman, Thomas Stead and Elizabeth Lee; those dying later of their injuries as Thomas Craggs and James Aldersmith The inspector interviewed railway staff involved directly (driver and guard) as well as many others involved in loading the casting, or had seen the casting on its wagon before the accident. The railway staff all either asserted that the casting had been lashed to the wagon or said they could not remember one way or the other. Smith however noted: > A very respectable civil engineer, whom I met when engaged in the > examination of the competing lines of railway to Scotland, acquainted me > that he had travelled by the train to which the accident happened on the 7th > of August, and was in the carriage with the persons who were unfortunately > killed. This gentleman is of opinion, from observations he made at the time, > that the casting was not lashed ; but I do not think it right to press this > negative evidence against the positive assertions of the persons whose > statements I have given above,although it appears to me entitled to every > consideration If the casting had been lashed on to the wagon, clearly it had not been done adequately since the ropes apparently used had chafed through owing to movement of the casting on the wagon: > Had the castings been properly secured by chains, ropes, or wood framing, > the accident of the 7th of August would not have happened, and it is quite > clear that there was great and unpardonable neglect in the parties whose > business it was to attend to such matters at Selby, for it behoved them not > only to see that the casting in question was lashed, but that it was secured > beyond the possibility of accident. The truck on which the casting was > placed had a flush floor, with the exception of a small ledge round the > sides and ends ; and therefore as it was on the lashing alone that the > safety of the passengers depended, it is evident that proper precautions > were not taken in this instance ; indeed, I am given to understand that the > large casting was supported on the smaller pieces of iron-work which were > lying loose on the floor of the truck. Smith recommended that goods should only be carried where they were secure, and wagons should be fitted with a frame to enclose large items, to prevent their falling off. He also recommended that the foreman of the goods department should personally inspect goods wagons to ensure their security and safety, and confirm in writing that he had done so.

During that period, famous artists such as Richard Wagner, Ernst Ludwig Kirchner, Otto Dix, Oskar Kokoschka, Richard Strauss, Gottfried Semper and Gret Palucca were active in the city. Dresden also is home to several important art collections, world-famous musical ensembles and significant buildings from various architectural periods, many of which were rebuilt after the destruction of the Second World War. Nowadays Dresden once more attracts international artists such as Fabio Luisi, Daniel Libeskind and Norman Foster to work in and for the cultural life of the city. Musical ensembles The Sächsische Staatskapelle Dresden is the orchestra of the Saxon State Opera and was founded in 1548. It is one of the oldest orchestras and is known as Strauss-Orchestra. Nevertheless the musical ensemble was also moulded by Carl Maria von Weber and Richard Wagner as its conductors. The Dresdner Kreuzchor (Choir of The Cross) is a boy's choir. It consists of pupils of the Kreuzschule, which is a Gymnasium today; the Kreuzchor is the choir of the Kreuzkirche. Choir, church and school were first mentioned in the 13th century and are as old as the city of Dresden. The \\"Dresdner Kapellknaben\\" (which are not related to the Staatskapelle) are the choir of the Catholic cathedral. The Dresden Philharmonic is the orchestra of the city of Dresden. It was founded in 1870, originally called the Gewerbehausorchestra, and renamed in 1915. The is a symphony orchestra and a newcomer to the international musical ensembles in Dresden. The orchestra was founded in 1996 and became notable for its crossover of classic and modern music and for its cooperation with the Pet Shop Boys creating a soundtrack for the 1925 silent film Battleship Potemkin and releasing the album of that name. Museums, presentations and collections The German Hygiene Museum was built during the transition from Historicism to Modernism Dresden hosts the renowned Staatlichen Kunstsammlungen Dresden (Dresden State Art Collections). The art collections consist of twelve museums, of which the Gemäldegalerie Alte Meister and the Grünes Gewölbe are the best known. This cultural institution is owned by the Free State of Saxony. Many of its museums are located in Dresden Castle and the Zwinger Palace. Some of the museums, such as the Mathematisch- Physikalischer Salon (Royal Cabinet of Mathematical and Physical Instruments), exhibit art within the context of technology, such as globes, measuring equipment and chronographs. Also known are Galerie Neue Meister (New Masters Gallery), Rüstkammer (Armoury) with the Turkish Chamber, and the Museum für Völkerkunde Dresden (Museum of Ethnology). Other museums and collections owned by the Free State of Saxony in Dresden are: * The Landesmuseum für Vorgeschichte (State Museum of Prehistory) * The Staatliche Naturhistorische Sammlungen Dresden (State Collection of Natural History) * The \\"Universitätssammlung Kunst + Technik\\" (Collection of Art and Technology of the Dresden University of Technology) * Verkehrsmuseum Dresden (Transport Museum) Dresden hosts the Bundeswehr Military History Museum in the former garrison in the Albertstadt. The book museum of the Saxon State Library presents the famous Dresden Codex. The former convention house of the Farmer's Estate (called the Landhaus) is now the home of the Dresden City Museum, which exhibits a collection of historical objects and has a smaller collection of paintings. The city has some museums specialising in artists who lived in the city (for example the and the . Another museum, the Technische Sammlungen (Technical Collection) was established in the Pentacon building, the old factory where Praktika cameras were once built. The collection includes historic cameras, computing technology and entertainment technology. The Deutsches Hygiene-Museum was founded for mass education in hygiene, health, human biology and medicine. It stood in context of the Dresden industry of medicine and hygiene products and was founded by the industrialist , who produced ' hygiene products. The museum's Gläserne Frau, showing the organs of human beings as a see-through sculpture, became world famous. During Nazism, the museum diffused racist theories. A 1934 poster of the museum showed a man with distinctly African features and reads, \\"If this man had been sterilized there would not have been born ... 12 hereditarily diseased.\\" (sic)\\"Nazi racial purity exhibit opens in Germany\\", NBC News/AP, 9 October 2006 According to the current director Klaus Vogel, \\"The Hygiene Museum was not a criminal institute in the sense that people were killed here,\\" but \\"it helped to shape the idea of which lives were worthy and which were worthless.\\" Architecture View over Dresden Although Dresden is often said to be a Baroque city, its architecture is influenced by more than one style. Other eras of importance are the Renaissance and Historism as well as the contemporary styles of Modernism and Postmodernism. =Royal household= The Dresden Castle, one of the oldest buildings in Dresden The royal buildings are among the most impressive buildings in Dresden. Dresden Castle was once the home of the royal household. The wings of the building have been renewed, built upon and restored many times. Due to this segued integration of styles, the castle includes elements of the Renaissance, Baroque and Classicist styles. The Zwinger Palace is just across the road from the castle. It was built on the old stronghold of the city and was converted to a centre for the royal art collections and a place to hold festivals. Its gate (surmounted by a golden crown) by the moat is a notable part of the building. Another notable site is also on the former city wall: Brühl's Terrace was a gift to Heinrich von Brühl and became an ensemble of buildings. It was opened to the public in the 19th century; previously the whole area had been reserved for the nobility. The ensemble includes the Albertinum, the Sächsisches Ständehaus and the Secundogenitur (home of the second son of the electors and kings). August the Strong was very impressed by Venice with its Canal Grande and decided to model the Dresden Elbe Valley on this example using the Elbe's ample bends. Nevertheless he initiated the creation of a cultural landscape which became a World Heritage Site since 2004 and which differs from the Canal Grande with its meadows and forested yards. This landscape hosts vineyards not far away from the inner city. The World Heritage Site passes through almost the whole city. Due to conflicts involving a modern bridge to be built across the river at a sensitive spot, the site has been added to the list of endangered World Heritage sites. Pillnitz Castle was built as a summer residence in the style of Chinoiserie alongside the Elbe on the southern side and the slopes and vineyards on the other. =Religious buildings= Dresden Cathedral The Hofkirche was the church of the royal household. August the Strong, who wanted to become King of Poland, was forced to convert to the Catholic religion, as the Polish king had to be Catholic. At that time Dresden was strictly Protestant. August the Strong ordered the building of the Hofkirche (1739 to 1755) to establish a sign of religious importance in Dresden. The church is the cathedral \\"Sanctissimae Trinitatis\\" since 1980. The staggered facade is completed by two balustrades that are decorated width 74 statues of saints. The church hosts the crypt of the Wettin Dynasty. The Frauenkirche was built by the citizens of Dresden between 1726 and 1743. It is said to be the greatest cupola building in central and northern Europe. Furthermore, the Frauenkirche is the largest church in Dresden, leading Dresden to be one of the few places where a cathedral is not the largest Christian sacral building. The basilica of Santa Maria della Salute in Venice is said to be a model for the Frauenkirche whose cupola was originally planned as a timber construction. During this period, architectural style in Dresden was significantly inspired by Venice, Florence and other landmarks in northern Italy. The Kreuzkirche is another main church of the Protestants and is the oldest established church building of Dresden . The community of the Frauenkirche, which is in fact a few years older, was formerly located in the outskirts of the city. The Kreuzkirche has often been destroyed by conflagration and wars. The preserved style of architecture is that of the baroque edition supplemented by the elements of the Art Nouveau. =Contemporary architecture= Dresden has been an important site for the development of contemporary architecture for centuries, and this trend has extended into the 20th and 21st centuries. Historicist buildings made their presence felt on the cityscape until the 1920s. One of the most recent buildings of that era is the Hygiene-Museum, which is designed in an impressively monumental style but employs plain facades and simple structures. It is often but wrongly attributed to the Bauhaus school. New Terrace (the Saxon State Parliament, the Erlweinspeicher and the Congress Center) The architectural plans of the National Socialist regime for the city were not realised. As in Berlin, where Nazi architects planned the monumental restructuring of the city as \\"Germania, Capital of the World\\", large-scale buildings next to the Großer Garten park were meant to establish Dresden as a subsidiary, regional capital. Some of the contemporary buildings were found to be \\"un-German\\". Among them was the Kugelhaus (Globe House) which was torn down. Along with older constructions, many modern buildings were destroyed in the Second World War. Most of the present cityscape of Dresden was built up after 1945, a mix of reconstructed or repaired old buildings and new buildings of the modern and postmodern styles of the second half of the 20th century. Under the German Democratic Republic, Dresden was planned and reconstituted as a model socialist city. Streets were arranged to keep chimneys of industry in sight. Wide streets and squares were cut into the landscape. Central public spaces, such as the Altmarkt, were surrounded by neoclassical Socialist Realist structures of relatively high quality. Other structures were built with less sensitivity toward their historic or geographic context, for example the housing block at Prager Straße. Other buildings, including the Kulturpalast or the Centrum-Warenhaus (a large department store), represent the international style. Much of the new public architecture was influenced by public outcry and protest; the Kulturpalast, for example, was first planned as monumental tower like the Warsaw Palace of Culture and Science but arranged in a flatter form in context of the historic buildings. After 1990 and German reunification, new styles emerged. The Saxon State Parliament was under construction until 1993 and uses the old part of the former financial ministry in combination with a new wing of glass and steel in classic modern style. It represents the beginning of the so-called New Terrace (extending Brühl's Terrace). The youngest building of that ensemble alongside the river Elbe is the International Congress Center Dresden which is a postmodern building mirroring motifs of the historic terrace and of the Elbe landscape. left The New Synagogue, at the other end of the old city, is another award-winning contemporary structure. Built almost completely of stone, its vertical edges are sloped, to reflect Jewish religious rites. The locally controversial UFA-Palast The nearby UFA- Kristallpalast cinema is a recent design by the firm Coop Himmelb(l)au. It is one of the largest deconstructivist buildings in Germany. Another deconstructivist project been planned for Dresden by Daniel Libeskind: the Military History Museum in the classicist Arsenal building which is currently under reconstruction. Libeskind has designed an arrow breaking through the building in the direction of the inner city, symbolising the flight formations during the bombardment of Dresden 1945-- appropriate to the context of the military museum that has existed in that building since 1918. The transparent new facade is in foreground of the solid old facade and creates a contrast that emblematises open and democratic society and the new role of its armed forces in contrast to the historic past.Studio Daniel Libeskind: Military History Museum project description left Norman Foster is responsible for the final stage of the reconstruction of the Dresden Hauptbahnhof train station. He designed a new teflon roof using the old steel girders and a new glass cupola of the entrance hall. The large white housetop is a unique landmark that can be seen from many positions on the slopes above the Elbe valley. The Saxon State Library was built between 1998 and 2002 on the campus of the Technische Universität Dresden. It is mainly underground, with two cuboids rising up from below. While the walls are of other substances, glass is used extensively in the roof portion of the building. The central reading room extends two stories underground. =Technical buildings= View over the Blue Wunder Elbe bridge from the upper station of the Schwebebahn Dresden suspension railway Dresden is also known for some technical buildings. Most of them were built in the second half of the 19th century and at the beginning of the 20th century. Two areas where there are technical buildings are Schillerplatz and Körnerplatz. These two places are named after Friedrich Schiller and Carl Theodor Körner and are connected by the \\"Blue Wonder\\" Elbe bridge. This bridge is one of the oldest cantilever truss bridges in Germany. It is often said to be called a Wonder because it spans the river without a pillar or due to its colour, which is sometimes said to have changed from green to blue. Nearby, two cable railways connect Körnerplatz with two villa quarters. The Standseilbahn Dresden is a funicular railway which travels up 95 metres and connects the districts of Loschwitz and Weißer Hirsch. The Schwebebahn Dresden is the oldest suspension railway in the world and connects the lower and upper parts of Loschwitz. The city planner designed some industrial buildings in the city centre. His storage building near the Semperoper is adapted to neighbouring buildings by a dissected roof. Another building planned by Hans Erlwein is the slaughterhouse complex. This location became famous thanks to the novel Slaughterhouse-Five by Kurt Vonnegut. The Yenidze cigarette factory, built between 1908 and 1909 Another well-known technical building is the Yenidze which was built as a cigarette factory. Its architecture is greatly influenced by marketing and orientally designed in an Oriental style to bring to mind the countries where tobacco comes from. Even the chimneys are styled like minarets. At the time it was built, its architecture was controversial but today it is a listed building. It is used as offices. The Saloppe waterworks on the Elbe river bank extracts water running down from the Dresden Heath The Fernsehturm Dresden-Wachwitz is the city TV tower. It is 252 metres high and towers 373 metres above the valley. There are several waterworks in the city. Most of them use water from the Elbe river. One of the oldest waterworks is the \\"Saloppe\\", which extracts fresh water from small rivers in the Dresden Heath forest. =Bridges= Marienbrücke The place of the Augustusbrücke between Altstadt and Neustadt in the centre of the city is the location of the oldest bridges in Dresden. A bridge at that place is already reported in the 13th century. Also reported are the demolitions of that bridge in floods of the past as appeared the last time yet in the March floods of 1845. The first bridge passed by the river is the Loschwitzer Brücke (famously known as Blaues Wunder). The Albertbrücke at the border of the inner city is some kilometre downstream. The following bridges Carolabrücke, Augustusbrücke and Marienbrücke are in short distances. The Marienbrücke is divided into a road/tram bridges and a railway bridge. It connects the two train station of most importance in Dresden Hauptbahnhof and Dresden-Neustadt station on the historic Leipzig-Dresdner railway and is as like the Carolabridge which hosts four lines of an important road and an extra double-track of the tram. =Sculptures, monuments and fountains= There are more than 300 fountains in Dresden. Most of the wells serve only a decorative function, since there is a drinking water network in Dresden. The artesian aquifer at Albertplatz is the only spring in Dresden that is run all-the-year due to its warm water. It was planned to produce fresh water for the Neustadt districts. About 3,900 litres per hour are flowing upwards the 240 metre depth well naturally by pressure. Many springs in Dresden are historic monuments, such as the \\"Nymphenbad\\" in the Zwinger or the \\"Cholerabrunnen\\". The \\"\\" was financed by Eugen von Gutschmid in thanks that Dresden was untroubled by the cholera epidemics in the 1940s years. The Nymphenbad in the Zwinger Springs and fountains are also elements in contemporary cityspaces: Modern springs are arranged along the Prager Straße. Due to their styles of fountain, they are called \\"blowballs\\". The springs alongside the Hauptbahnhof train station are above the glass ceiling of an underground parking. A prominent sculpture in Dresden is the golden equestrian sculpture of Augustus II the Strong called the \\" (Golden Cavalier)\\" on the Neustädter Markt square. It shows August at the beginning of the Hauptstraße (Main street) on his way to Warsaw where he was elected King of Poland. Another sculpture is the memorial of Martin Luther in front of the Frauenkirche.

It was built by renowned architects and artists, amongst them Hermann Muthesius, Heinrich Tessenow, Theodor Fischer and Wilhelm Kreis. In 1911 Tessenow built the Hellerau Festspielhaus (festival theatre) for the Swiss music educator Émile Jaques-Dalcroze and Hellerau became a centre of modernism with international standing until the outbreak of World War I. During the Third Reich, this area was infamous. In 1950 Hellerau was incorporated into the city of Dresden. Today the Hellerau reform architecture is recognised as exemplary. In the 1990s the garden city of Hellerau became a conservation area. Cinemas and cinematics There still a lot of small cinemas and theatres of cinematic arts offering a programme of cult films and current films of low budget or weak promotion that were selected by their cultural worth. Dresden also has a couple of Multiplex Cinemas of which the Rundkino is the oldest. The cinema build in a circular building was out of order after the flooding of 2002 but was reopened in 2008. Dresden has been a centre in the production of animated films and of the optical cinematic techniques. The Dresden Filmfest hosts a contest of short subjects which is among the most endowed contests in Europe. Literature Dresden is a topic in German- language literature in various eras. Dresden was home to a number of authors or a place of their activities and influence. Friedrich Schiller published his Ode to Joy in Dresden which he began in Gohlis near Leipzig in 1785. E. T. A. Hoffmann's novella The Golden Pot. A Modern Fairytale is set in Dresden and was published in 1814. The Golden Pot has parts of realistic descriptions of Dresden and fades into a surreal world of myths. Hoffmann witnessed the Battle of Dresden in 1813. Erich Kästner grow up in Dresden. He worked off his youth in Dresden (The Flying Classroom) and his military training in an artillery battalion in the Dresden Albertstadt garrison (poem Sergeant Waurich). Kurt Vonnegut's novel Slaughterhouse-Five describes the bombing of Dresden in February 1945 seen from a slaughterhouse near the old city of Dresden. Vonnegut was prisoner of war in Dresden during that event. Contemporary novelists who are active in Dresden include Uwe Tellkamp and Ingo Schulze. Both broach up the theme of \\"Mythos Dresden\\". Tellkamp is known for his novel Der Turm (The Tower) plotting the life of an academic family in its educated social environment (ivory tower society) of Dresden in the last seven years of former East Germany. Lifestyle Filmnächte am Elbufer − Film night at the Elbe river banks The Saxon Switzerland is not far away from Dresden; its rock formations can be seen from some places in Dresden. Dresden's heterogeneous cityspace strongly influences the lifestyle of the city. Dresden can change from very urban to very rural in just a short distance. Dresden is renowned for its many events and concerts. The inner city is functionally split into a number of districts. The historic city centre serves as the most important tourist area and offers a variety of restaurants, bars, and pubs that are visited by tourists as well as the local inhabitants. The Seevorstadt, south of the historic town centre, is the most important shopping area in Dresden. It is crossed by the famous Prager Straße shopping street with large department stores and smaller shops. The intersection with the Altmarkt, which is the oldest market place in Dresden, extend this shopping area into the town centre. The Seevorstadt, with the main station and an important tram hub within a short distance, is also a very urban area of Dresden. The Neustadt is divided into the touristy Inner Neustadt and the Outer Neustadt. The Inner Neustadt offers a cornucopia of restaurants and retail shopping as well as important cultural institutions. The Outer Neustadt features importantly in Dresden night life. The Outer Neustadt is the centre of subcultural and youth culture in Dresden with many clubs, bars, small stages, and alternative culture institutions. Dresden is awash with green during the spring and summer. The huge parks and the long Elbe meadows are used day and at night for sports, parties and cultural activities. Local recreation takes place in the nearby National Park of Saxon Switzerland, in the Ore Mountains and in the countryside around Moritzburg, which are all close by. The cultural landscape of the Dresden Elbe Valley is a World Heritage Site but also part of the everyday life of many inhabitants. The site crosses the city and is passed through by commuter traffic, used in leisure time and libed in by tens of thousands of residents. Dresden is a student city with its own infrastructure of event locations and cultural institutions. There are 16 student clubs in the Altstadt and Südvorstadt near the university. Due to the Elbe river, rowing and canoeing are popular leisure activities in Dresden. Dresden is a chess centre and was the host city of the Chess Olympiad in 2008. Night inline skating events are held every week in the summer. The style of housing can vary strongly within Dresden. In some cases old village cores are only a few minutes away from urban districts. The city centre is enormously different compared with the southern outskirts of the city. The Outer Neustadt, with the highest density of inhabitants, is just a kilometre away from the Dresdner Heide forest in the north. The large area in the south eastern corner and its outskirts are the most densely populated areas. Districts like Blasewitz or Striesen are covered with dotted housings and small garden areas around the houses. The Elbe slopes are covered with expensive villas. These contrast sharply with some areas such as the high-rise concrete blocks such as those in Gorbitz where living standards are low.

The concert was performed at Ambedkar Bhavan, Bangalore on 17 February 2007. This concert was the first for the band since they broke up about 25 years earlier in 1981 and can, possibly, be said to be the first live concert of Moheener Ghoraguli outside West Bengal. Three original ghoras - 'Pradip Chattopadhyay', 'Ranjon Ghoshal' and 'Abraham Mazumder joined hands and performed with other artists from the 90s Moheen stable like Divya Mukhopadhyay and Tamojit Roy and modern Bangla Rock artists like Silajit Majumder and Anindya Bose. They were ably supported by the chamber orchestra of Abraham's music school - L'Atelier de Musique de Calcutta, and the young horses - Pradip's son Ritoban Chattopadhyay on the lead guitar and Ranjon's son Abhimanyu Ghoshal on the second guitar. A nostalgic evening It was an evening filled with nostalgia that rekindled the passions and probably revived the movement that revolutionized Bengali music forever. One could gauge from the audience, which consisted of people from different ethnicity and culture, reaction that it was an evening not only for the music lovers of Bengal but it managed to cross all barriers of language, signifying the USP of Moheen's music - that of both mass and class appeal. Performances Pradip 'Bulada' Chattopadhyay singing his famous Shattawla Baadi The concert was curated and hosted by Ranjon Ghoshal . He kept the audience enthralled with bits of trivia and anecdotes from the past days, that kept the folks glued to their seats throughout the three and a half hours of the show. Pradip Chattopadhyay was brilliant with the flute and with his on-stage antics kept the audience in splits. He was cleaning Abraham's piano at one time, dancing and prancing around to Anindya's performance at other times - but all was done in perfect rhythm and harmony. Abraham Mazumdar, was genius personified. He played the violin, the grand piano and the keyboard all with equal ease and elan. Such calm and composure on stage is a rare sight and his ever-smiling face was a joy to behold. His sense of assurance lifted the whole team and inspired all the members. If there was Abraham, then there was Anindya Bose of the band Shohor. He was electric and had the audience swaying to his steps. His rendition of \\"Priya Cafe\\" was a high point of the evening. Silajit Majumder (left) and Anindya performing Prithibi Silajit Majumder, another prominent guest singer - was excellent of his rendition of Shono Shudhijon and Shongbigno Pakhikul though one was really shocked at his going wrong on lyrics at a tribute concert. But the evening couldn't have been such a success without Tamojit Roy and Divya Mukherjee. Divya was calmness personified in his rendition of his classic \\"Akashe Chhodano\\". Tamojit was a revelation. His burlesque frame dupes one to believe otherwise, but once on stage the man was like a volcano, ready to erupt, bubbling with energy. With his powerful vocals he took the audience to a different world. One must also say a few words about Anupam Roy of L'atelier. He was the best of the lot, with his humble looks and attire but with a smooth confident voice like that of a maestro and not to forget his skills on the violin. Ranjon Ghoshal singing at the concert The Baul Jazz fusion was the piece de resistance of the evening. It was presented by Tamojit Roy and Divya Mukhopadhyay on vocals, Pradip Chattopadhyay on flute, Abraham Mazumder on the grand piano, Prakash Sontakke on slide guitar, Karthik Subramaniyam on percussion, Abhishek Roy on drums, Arnab on bass guitar, Ritoban Chattopadhyay on lead guitar, Abhimanyu Ghoshal on second guitar and Anubrata Ghatak on violin. Apart from their published songs, they also performed quite a few unpublished numbers like \\"Benojoler Gaan\\", \\"Sobuj Gomkhet(Mithye shwopno)\\", \\"Chhaya-ghera\\", which they had composed in the 1970s but didn't get a chance to publish in their releases. Similar concerts have been planned at Delhi, Kolkata, Hyderabad and Pune by the end of 2007.

The Portuguese defenders, including the city's governor and an admiral of the fleet anchored there, were unable to put up effective resistance in spite of numerical advantages. Four Portuguese ships of the line were lost, and the city had to pay a ransom to avoid destruction of its defences. Background There were multiple reasons for the French to plan an attack on Rio de Janeiro. Firstly, the commander Duguay-Trouin had a personal reason: he was almost bankrupt. The second reason was political. The War of the Spanish Succession had not gone well for France. After the defeat in the Battle of Malplaquet, the enemy was on French soil and French morale was low. A military success was urgently needed. The third reason was a question of honour. The previous year another buccaneer, Jean-François Duclerc had attempted an attack on Rio, but this expedition had ended in disaster; Duclerc and 600 of his soldiers were captured and held in unacceptable conditions. The Portuguese refused to exchange these prisoners as was stipulated in a Franco- Portuguese treaty from 1707; furthermore, Duclerc was killed in prison under mysterious circumstances in May 1711. The French wanted to liberate these prisoners, and possibly conquer some Brazilian territory. Preparations In December 1710 Louis XIV approved Duguay-Trouin's plan and provided him with a fleet of 17 ships, carrying in total 738 cannons and 6,139 men. The French treasury could not finance the armament of the squadron and therefore Duguay- Trouin had to search private financiers in Saint Malo and on the Royal Court; he received significant support from the Count of Toulouse. Finally the ships could be prepared and to fool the British Navy, allied to the Portuguese, the ships were prepared in different harbours, left at different times, and reassembled at sea off La Rochelle on June 9, 1711. British intelligence, however, were aware of Duguay-Trouin's goal, and had dispatched a packet to warn the Portuguese, both in Portugal and at Rio. They also dispatched a fleet under John Leake to blockade Duguay-Trouin before he sailed from Brest; they arrived two days too late.Boxer, p. 94 The battle In spite of the British warning, the French appearance in Rio's harbour on 12 September was a surprise. The British news, when it arrived in August, had led Governor Francisco de Moraes de Castro to call out his militia and increase preparedness, and rumours of sails off Cabo Frio in early September had again raised the alert. However, on 11 September the governor ordered the militia to stand down, just as Duguay-Trouin was preparing his approach to the harbour.Boxer, p. 95 The commander of Le Lys, Courserac, led the squadron directly in the Bay of Rio, between the forts lining the harbour entry, and straight at seven Portuguese warships that were anchored there. The Portuguese fleet commander, admiral Gaspar da Costa, could do nothing but cut the cables in hopes of getting his ships moving. Three of battleships grounded and were destroyed by the Portuguese to prevent their capture; the fourth was taken by the French and burned. Fire from the forts, undermanned after the order to stand down, did some damage to the French fleet, inflicting 300 casualties before the ships passed out of range. After 3 days of bombardments, the French landed 3,700 men to attack the city. The governor of Rio, Castro-Morais, had fortified the city after French attacks in previous years, but very feebly commanded the defense, which buckled under the French bombardment. After a council on 21 September in which Moraes ordered the city's defenders to hold the line, militia began deserting that night, after which there began a general flight from the city that included the governor. Under the disorganised circumstances, the French prisoners from Duclerc's expedition broke out of prison. Aftermath Duguay-Trouin, who had been preparing to storm the city, was alerted to the flight of the defenders by the arrival of one of Duclerc's men. Over the next few days, the French gained control of all of the bay's strong points, but the city's gold supply eluded him. Warned that reinforcements from São Paulo under command of António de Albuquerque were on their way, he threatened Moraes with the destruction of the city's defences if a ransom was not paid, which Moraes agreed to do. When the French left the city, it was with loot of estimated at 4 million pounds, including a shipment of African slaves, which Duguay-Trouin later sold in Cayenne. Two ships sank after a storm near the Azores. \\"One with considerable treasure aboard\\".Pillaging the Empire: Global Piracy on the High Seas, 1500-1750 Por Kris E Lane, Kris Lane, Robert M. Levine The fleet arrived back unmolested in Brest in February 1712. The expedition was a military success for the French, and a financial success for its investors. The French Navy had proven it was still capable to strike at large distances. This action would trouble Franco- Portuguese relations for many years to come.

The election was held on 25 January 1922, i.e. before the 1922 general election, which was held on 7 December. The seat of Southern Maori became vacant following the death of the sitting member John Hopere Wharewiti Uru on 29 November 1921. Four candidates contested the seat, which was won by the younger brother of the deceased member, Henry Whakatau Uru, known as Harry. He was a native agent, 49 years old, and born in Kaiapoi. According to the local Christchurch newspaper, The Press of Thursday, 26 January 1922 (page 6), the new member was a supporter of the Reform government led by William Massey, not an Independent as it had stated the day before, when Teone Erihana was described as a 'Government' candidate and all the others as 'Independent'. The election result given by The Press was two votes higher than the official result published in the New Zealand Gazette of 9 February (page 440) i.e. 814 not 812, with Uru as 365 not 364 and Pitama as 109 not 108.

It was built by a group of about 80 apprentices from Cammell Laird's shipyard, designed in part by Mr L Pinch, a draughtsman at the yard, for exhibition at the International Garden Festival in Liverpool in 1984. The Submarine was in a garden themed around the Beatles, one of 60 such themed gardens, and was highly popular. The garden took the form of an apple-shaped labyrinth, containing symbolic references to the group, and included a bronze statue of John Lennon, which now stands at Liverpool John Lennon Airport. The Submarine itself is some 51 feet long (15.62 m) and 15 feet (4.57 m) high, and weighed 18 tons. Built of steel, it has a replica control cabin containing genuine submarine equipment, and twin spiral staircases leading to the bridge, which gave a panoramic view of the garden. These were accessible via doorways at the side. Painted in vivid yellow, the hull was tilted as if about to submerge. After the Festival site closed, the Submarine found a home for several years in Chavasse Park, an open space in the city centre, where it was readily visible to traffic entering the city centre from the south. It was retired from public view when its condition deteriorated, but was renovated to find a new home at Liverpool John Lennon Airport in 2005, with airport boss Neil Pakey stating 'Other airports have the Concorde, we have the Yellow Submarine'.

'Pé-de-Moleque' () (literally \\"brat's foot\\" in Portuguese) is a traditional candy from Brazil. It is made of peanuts and jaggery or molasses. The candy is prepared by mixing roasted, peeled peanuts with melted brown sugar, with or without the addition of macerated peanuts as well. The mixture is gently stirred over low heat until it gets close to crystallizing. Then the mixture is placed on a plain stone or metal surface (preferably thinly oiled with butter to ease removal) in pieces similar in size to cookies. This traditional preparation results in soft, irregularly-shaped sweets of a dark brown color. Softness results from the incorporation of peanut oil. Pé-de-Moleque appeared in the middle of the 16th century, with the arrival of sugar cane in Brazil. The city of Piranguinho, in the south of the state of Minas Gerais, is known for the artisanal production of sweets, and has stood out on the national scene through the party of the biggest pé-de-moleque in the world, which is part of the municipality's cultural calendar of festivities. In India, mainly in the states of Gujarat and Maharashtra, they call it chikki. In Portugal, the pé-de-moleque is known as nougat. In Mexico, it's called palanqueta. There is a derivation of the candy in the version of a cake, common to festa juninas from places in Brazilian Northeast. Pé-de-moleque cake is also called \\"bolo preto\\" (black cake), in which cashew can replace peanuts, rapadura is kept and fermented cassava mass (pubada, puba mass) and other ingredients. Etymology The name \\"pé-de-moleque\\" has two hypotheses for its origin: ”Revista Gosto” - Editora Rickdan- Nº 25 - 10/2011 * reference to the paving of irregular stones found in historic Brazilian cities such as Paraty and Ouro Preto, which was so named. * motivated by the street vendors of the past who sold them and were robbed by the kids. In order not to be harassed anymore, they told the boys to ask, because they didn't need to steal: : - Pede, moleque! (ask for it, kid!) In the literature The sweet can still be found in the literature, such as in O dialeto caipira, AMARAL, Amadeu. O dialeto caipira (in Portuguese). São Paulo: HUCITEC, 1976. by Amadeu Amaral, there is reference to the \\"pé-de- moleque\\" .

Its members have been unchanged since 2003. Sodagreen emerged in the Taiwanese indie music scene after receiving the Grand Jury Award in the Hohaiyan Gongliau Rock Festival in 2004, after which it signed a contract with Willlin Music. The band is the first indie band to hold a concert in the Taipei Arena. History Sodagreen was named by Shih, the band's leader at the time, and Wu, the lead vocalist. The band was originally named Soda (蘇打), but Shih preferred a name with three-syllable. Wu then affixed the word green (綠), his favourite colour, behind Soda, completing the portmanteau. In May 2001, Sodagreen competed in the Golden Melody Cup held by the National Chengchi University and won the Best Popularity award with the composition \\"Peeping\\". With the support of Shiao-Ying, a judge at the competition, it recorded \\"Peeping\\" for the compilation Taiwan independent compilation 2001, released by TCM. In April the next year, after several changes to the line-up of the band (guitarists), Sodagreen participated in the Golden Melody Cup again, this time winning the awards for Best Band, Best Composition, Best Lyrics and Best Music. In March 2003, A-Fu and Jia-Kai, also from the National Chengchi University, and A-Gong from the Taipei National University of the Arts joined the band, forming its current line-up. In July the same year, the band decided to break up upon graduation and mark its dissolution with a final tour. Its first stop was the Hohaiyan Gongliau Rock Festival's Hot Wave Rock section, where it caught the attention of prominent indie producer Will Lin. In August 2004, Sodagreen were awarded the Grand Jury Award at the Hohaiyan Gongliau Rock Festival, after which the band was signed by Lin's Willlin Music. In September 2005, they released their self-titled debut album, sodagreen, which was preceded by a few singles and EPs. Through this album, the band garnered a handful of nominations at the 2006 Golden Melody Awards. In October 2006, they released their second album, Little Universe, followed by a single in December- My Future Is Not a Dream, a collaboration with A-pay, a band under the same label. In June 2007, Sodagreen were awarded the Best Band Award at the 18th Golden Melody Awards. Wu Tsing-Fong also received the highly coveted Best Melody award for Little Love Song, which was also nominated for best lyrics. Little Universe was nominated for the Best Album award. In November, Sodagreen released their third album, Incomparable Beauty. Shortly after, it held its first major concert, the Absolutely Beautiful Concert, which was held at the Taipei Arena, where it made history by being the first indie band to hold a concert there. The concert holds the record for being the longest concert ever held at the venue, with Sodagreen playing for five hours, incurring a large fine for playing too late into the night. In May 2008, the band released the live album Sing With Me, which included live tracks from the Absolutely Beautiful Concert as well as three new studio tracks. Lover Animal was the official Chinese language theme song for the film Juno. That year at the 19th Golden Melody Awards, they were awarded the Best Band Award for the second time in a row. In 2009, Sodagreen began its Vivaldi Project, planning to record and release four concept albums based on the four seasons within two years. The band recorded Daylight of Spring in Taidung and released it in May. They then travelled to London to record Summer/Fever, releasing it in September. Late that year, the band held a solo concert at the Taipei Arena for the second time, playing for two nights at the Daylight Fever Concert. However, the band's plans for the third and fourth Vivaldi Project albums were cut short by A-gong's conscription. In 2010, Sodagreen's two albums garnered a double nomination for the Best Band Award. The music video for the song Daylight won its directors the award for best music video. That year, the band released their second live album, Once in a Lifetime, comprising live recordings from the Daylight Fever Concerts and three studio-recorded songs. The tracks Once in a Lifetime and No Sleep came in 29th HITO Radio Hit Fm Annual Top 100 Singles Chart- 2010 (#1 to 50) Retrieved 2011-05-10 and 84th respectively on Hit Fm Taiwan's Hit Fm Annual Top 100 Singles Chart (Hit- Fm年度百首單曲) for 2010.

Following A-gong's discharge from military service in 2011, the band released its eighth album, What is Troubling You in November. The song Enjoy Loneliness received online prominence after Wu performed it on the talk show Kangxi Lai Le. The music video for the titular song What is Troubling You also trended worldwide on video-sharing website YouTube for a few days after its release. Shortly before A-fu's discharge in January 2012, the band announced that its third Taipei Arena concert, Walk Together, would be held in March that year. The Walk Together World Tour began at the Taipei Arena with two concerts from 3–4 March. This was followed by two sold-out concerts at the Kaohsiung K-Arena on 18 August and 19 August 2012. Shortly after ending the Walk Together World Tour at Shanghai on 3 August 2013, Sodagreen announced that Autumn: Stories, the third installment in the band's Vivaldi Project, would be released on 18 September 2013. The release of the album in September was accompanied by six live house performances in Beijing, with tickets to these mini-concerts selling out within ten minutes of the opening of online booking services. In 2014, the band held its tenth anniversary tour: Aerial Visions, Sounds and Illusions, the title of its first EP. The tour began at the Hong Kong Coliseum on 11 April and saw the band tour various Asian cities over eight months. In September 2015, Sodagreen announced that the last album in its Vivaldi Project, Winter Endless, would be released on 4 November. On 16 September, the band released the music video for Everyone, a song on the record, which featured members of the band playing in Berlin, where the album was produced and is set.

The ring-shaped accelerator is visible as a circular building that rises from the ground. The Proton Synchrotron Booster in its tunnel Artist's impression of the Proton Synchrotron BoosterThe Proton Synchrotron Booster (PSB) is the first and smallest circular proton accelerator (a synchrotron) in the accelerator chain at the CERN injection complex, which also provides beams to the Large Hadron Collider.\\"CERN -- Division PS -- LHC-PS project\\" Retrieved on 09 July 2018 It contains four superimposed rings with a radius of 25 meters, which receive protons with an energy of from the linear accelerator Linac 2 and accelerate them up to , ready to be injected into the Proton Synchrotron (PS). Before the PSB was built in 1972, Linac 1 injected directly into the Proton Synchrotron, but the increased injection energy provided by the booster allowed for more protons to be injected into the PS and a higher luminosity at the end of the accelerator chain. Historical background =1964 - 1968: Planning and start of construction= Before the PSB became operational in 1972, the protons were directly delivered to the Proton Synchrotron (PS) by the linear accelerator Linac 1, providing the PS with protons of 50 MeV, which were then accelerated by the PS to 25 GeV at beam intensities of approx. 1012 protons per pulse.\\"Klaus Hanke: Past and Present of the CERN PS Booster (2013)\\" Retrieved on 10 July 2018 However, with the development of new experiments (mainly at the Intersecting Storage Rings ISR), the demanded beam intensities in the order of 1013 protons per pulse exceeded the capabilities of this setup. Therefore, different approaches on how to increase the beam energy already before the protons enter the PS were discussed. Different suggestions for this new PS injector were made, for example another linear accelerator or five intersecting synchrotron rings inspired by the shape of the Olympic rings.\\"S Gilardoni, D. Mangluki: Fifty years of the CERN Proton Synchrotron Vol. II (2013)\\" Retrieved on 10 July 2018 Eventually, it was decided to go for a setup of four vertically stacked synchrotron rings with a radius of 25 meters, which was proposed in 1964.\\"The Second Stage CMS Improvement Study: 800 MeV Booster Synchrotron (1967)\\" Retrieved on 10 July 2018 With this special design, it would become possible to reach the aspired intensities of more than 1013 protons per pulse. In 1967, the budget of the overall update program was estimated to be 69.5 million CHF (1968 prices). More than half of this sum was devoted to the construction of the PSB, which started one year later, in 1968. =1972 - 1974: First beam and start-up= The first proton beams in the PSB were accelerated on May 1 in 1972, and the nominal energy of 800 MeV was reached on May 26. In October 1973, the intermediate intensity goal of 5.2 \\\\cdot 1012 protons per pulse delivered to the PS was reached. In total, it took around two years to achieve the design intensity of 1013 protons per pulse. =1973 - 1978: Update to Linac 2= During the first years of operation, it became clear that the linear accelerator Linac 1, CERN's primary proton source at that time, was unable to keep up with the technical advances of the other machines within the accelerator complex. Therefore, it was decided in 1963 to build a new linear accelerator, which would later be called Linac 2. This new machine would provide protons with the same energy as before (50 MeV), but with higher beam currents of up to 150 mA and a longer pulse duration of 200 μs.\\"E. Boltezer et al: The New CERN 50-MeV LINAC (1979)\\" Retrieved on 10 July 2018 Construction of Linac 2 started in December 1973 and was completed in 1978. Linac 1 continued to operate as a source of light ions up to 1992. =1988: Upgrade to 1 GeV= After more than ten years of operation, the constant increase of the beam intensity also demanded an increase in output energy of the PSB. Therefore, with only minor hardware adjustments, the PSB was upgraded to 1 GeV in 1988.\\"CERN Annual Report 1988 Vol. II (french), page 104\\" Retrieved on 11 July 2018 =1980s - 2003: Accelerating ions= From the beginning of the 1980s until 2003, the PSB was also used to accelerate light ions like oxygen or alpha-particles, which were delivered by Linac 1. After Linac 3 as a dedicated ion linear accelerator became operational, also heavy ions such as lead and indium were accelerated by the PSB. From 2006 on, the Low Energy Ion Ring (LEIR) took over PSB's former task of accelerating ions.\\"Belochitskii et al.: LEIR Commissioning (2006)\\" Retrieved on 11 July 2018 =1992: Connection to ISOLDE experiment= Up to 1992, the only machine that used the output protons from the PSB was the PS. This changed in 1992, when the On-Line Isotope Mass Separator (ISOLDE) became the second recipient of PSB's protons.\\"CERN ISOLDE Website: History\\" Retrieved on 10 July 2018 Before, ISOLDE had obtained protons from the Synchro-Cyclotron, but this machine had reached the end of its lifetime by the end of the 1980s. Thus, it was decided in 1989 to connect ISOLDE to the PSB. =1999: Preparation for the LHC and upgrade to 1.4 GeV= With the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at the horizon, another upgrade of the PSB to 1.4 GeV was necessary. This upgrade implied more severe adjustments of the hardware than the previous upgrade to 1 GeV, because the limits of PSB's design parameters had been reached. In 2000, the upgrade was completed. =2010 - 2026: Future upgrades for the High Luminosity Large Hadron Collider= In 2010, the cornerstone for another upgrade of the LHC was laid: the High Luminosity Large Hadron Collider.\\"C. Carli: Proceedings of the Chamonix 2010 Workshop on LHC Performance\\" Retrieved on 10 July 2018 The much higher required beam intensity makes it necessary to increase the PSB's output energy to 2.0 GeV. This will be implemented throughout the following years by the exchange and update of various key equipment of the PSB, for example the main power supply, the radio-frequency system, the transfer line to the PS and the cooling system. Additionally, the input energy of the PSB will be increased: Linac 4, currently being commissioned, will provide an output beam energy of 160 MeV and will replace Linac 2 by 2020. Linac 4 will enable the PSB to provide higher quality beam for the LHC by using hydrogen anions (H− ions) rather than bare protons (H+ ions). A stripping foil at the PSB injection point will strip the electrons off the hydrogen anions, thus creating protons that are accumulated as beam bunches in the four PSB rings. These proton bunches are then recombined at the exit of the PSB and further transferred down the CERN injector chain. Setup and operation The PSB is part of CERN's accelerator complex. By the time it was constructed, the Meyrin campus had just been enlarged, now covering French territory as well. The center of PSB's rings sits directly on the border between France and Switzerland. Due to the countries’ different regulations regarding buildings at the border, it was decided to build the main PSB construction underground. The only visible PSB infrastructure is located on the Swiss side. The PSB consists of four vertically stacked rings with a radius of 25 meters. Each ring is sectioned into 16 periods with two dipole magnets per period and a triplet focusing structure made up of three quadrupole magnets (focusing, defocusing, focusing).\\"PBS machine overview: Sketch of period 1\\" Retrieved on 10 July 2018 Every magnet structure consists of four single magnets for the four rings stacked on top of each other, sharing one yoke. Since the PSB consists of four rings in contrast to only one beamline in Linac 2 and one ring in the PS, a special construction is necessary to couple the proton beams in and out. The proton beam coming from Linac 2 is split up vertically into four different beams by the so-called proton distributor: The beam travels through a series of pulsed magnets, which successively deflect parts of the incoming beam to different angles. This results in four beamlets filling the four rings, as well as the rising and falling edge of the proton pulse, which get dumped after the proton distributor. Similarly, the four beamlets are merged again after they have gotten accelerated by the PSB. With a series of different magnetic structures, the beams from the four rings are brought to one vertical level and are then directed towards the PS. In 2017, 1.51 \\\\cdot 1020 protons got accelerated by the PSB. 61.45% of those were delivered to ISOLDE, and only a small fraction of 0.084% were used by the LHC.\\"CERN Annual Report 2017, page 23\\" Retrieved on 11 July 2018 Results and discoveries The only direct experiment that is fed by PSB's protons is the On-Line Isotope Mass Separator (ISOLDE). There, the protons are used to create different types of low-energy radioactive nuclei.\\"CERN Website: ISOLDE Facility\\" Retrieved on 10 July 2018 With these, a wide variety of experiments ranging from nuclear and atomic physics to solid state physics and life sciences are conducted.

These privileges were reiterated or confirmed by Pope Innocent III in 1200: Muzi, p. 70. In 1163, the Imperial Archchancellor, Archbishop Raynaldus of Cologne, promulgated an imperial decree of the Emperor Frederick Barbarossa, forbidding the Camaldolese from having any authority to depose and deprive an abbot of San Sepolcro, without the license and permission of the emperor.Muzi, p. 66. From 1350 to 1353, Borgo San Sepolcro was occupied by Ghibelline troops of the ambitious Archbishop Visconti of Milan, who was attempting to seize all of Tuscany and Umbria, with the help of local Ghibelline adherents, the Boccagnini, the Pallavicini and the Tarlati of Arezzo. On the withdrawal of the Milanese forces after the Peace of Sarzana in 1353, a civil war broke out between Guelphs and Ghibellines, between Borgo San Sepolcro and Città di Castello.Muzi, pp. 88-90. On 25 December 1352, a major earthquake struck the areas of Borgo San Sepolcro and Città di Castello, causing more than 500 deaths in Borgo. The bell tower of the monastery was destroyed, and there was major damage to the buildings of the cloister. Many sections of the town wall were thrown down. Graziani I, pp. 31-32, puts the death toll at more than 2000. =Creation of the diocese= On 22 September 1515, Pope Leo X issued a bull which erected the Camaldolese monastery church of S. Giovanni into a cathedral, creating Abbot Galeazzo, who had consented to the suppression of his monastery, the first bishop of Borgo San Sepolcro. The bull was not put into effect immediately, however, due to various difficulties.One difficulty was certainly the objection of the General of the Camaldolese Order, Pietro Delfini. As late as 1522 he was writing to Cardinal Giulio de' Medici against Bishop Galeazzo, Epistolae, Book XII, no. 76. Muzi, p. 110. It was not until 18 September 1520 that Graziani was preconised and obtained his bulls of institution.Muzi, p. 110. At the same time the prelature gained territories from the Diocese of Arezzo and Diocese of Città di Castello.Ughelli III, pp. 195-198. In the same bull of 1515, \\"Praeexcellenti praeeminentia\\", Pope Leo created the Chapter of Canons of the cathedral, composed of three dignities (the Provost, the Archdeacon, and the Archpriest) and nine other Canons. The cathedral was also a parish church, and the Archpriest had the \\"cure of souls\\" (i.e. served as pastor).Ughelli III, pp. 196, 198. Cappelletti, pp. 254, 257. On 7 October 1975, the diocese lost territories to the Diocese of Cesena and Diocese of Forli.Acta Apostolicae Sedis Vol. 67 (Città del Vaticano 1975), p. 679. =Suppression of the diocese= diocese of Arezzo-Cortona-Sansepolcro On 18 February 1984, the Vatican and the Italian State signed a new and revised concordat. Based on the revisions, a set of Normae was issued on 15 November 1984, which was accompanied in the next year, on 3 June 1985, by enabling legislation. According to the agreement, the practice of having one bishop govern two separate dioceses at the same time, aeque personaliter, was abolished. Instead, the Vatican continued consultations which had begun under Pope John XXIII for the merging of small dioceses, especially those with personnel and financial problems, into one combined diocese. In Tuscany, this particularly affected three dioceses: Arezzo, Cortona, and Borgo San Sepolcro (Biturgensis). On 30 September 1986, Pope John Paul II ordered that the dioceses of Arezzo, Cortona, and San Sepolcro be merged into one diocese with one bishop, with the Latin title Dioecesis Arretina-Cortonensis-Biturgensis. The seat of the diocese was to be in Arezzo, and the cathedral of Arezzo was to serve as the cathedral of the merged diocese. The cathedrals in Cortona and San Sepolcro were to become co-cathedrals, and their cathedral Chapters were to be a Capitulum Concathedralis. There was to be only one diocesan Tribunal, in Arezzo, and likewise one seminary, one College of Consultors, and one Priests' Council.

It is located in the municipality of Voždovac.  Location  Marinkova Bara (Serbian for \\"Marinko's bog\\") is located in the northern section of the municipality, along the southern side of the Belgrade-Niš highway, in the valley of the Mokroluški potok. It is bordered by the neighborhoods of Dušanovac (west), Braće Jerković (south), Medaković (south-east & east) and Konjarnik (north, across the highway).  History  Before the settlement was founded, it was a wooded area below what is today Central Cemetery. In the early 19th century it was part of the domain of Marinko Marinković, obor-knez of Avala. After him, the wood was called Marinkova šuma (Marinko's wood) and later, when the village developed, it was also named after him. Marinkova Bara originates from the 1920s and 1930s when the small village was the eastern suburb of Belgrade. One half of the settlement developed in the valley, at the confluence of the Duboki potok and Kumodraški potok creeks into the Mokroluški potok. Other half extended into the hills and slopes above, around the modern Zaplanjska street. In 1890s, location of the Belgrade hippodrome was moved from the area of the modern Vukov Spomenik neighborhood to Marinkova Bara. At the beginning of the 20th century, the hippodrome was moved to Banjica. In one of the efforts during the Interbellum to demolish the shanty town of Jatagan Mala, city administration demolished the largest part of the settlement in 1939–40, when 450 houses were razed to the ground, and the inhabitants were forcibly resettled to Marinkova Bara. From June 1945 to December 1946, Marinkova Bara was one of 5 administrative neighborhoods within Belgrade's Raion VI. In November 1968 city announced optimistic plans to resettle the entire Marinkova Bara, classified as an informal settlement at the time, and estimated to have a population of over 20,000. A total of 1,100 new building apartments were planned, which in turn developed into the Medaković neighborhood. Construction was planned to start in the spring of 1968, while the complete resettlement was to be finished by 1971. The sewage connection with the Kumodraž sewage collector was also planned. The city then dropped Marinkova Bara from the 1969 relocation plan and the construction of the new buildings was postponed for later that year. Though the new settlements of Medaković II and Medaković III were finished in the 1970s and early 1980s, the majority of Marinkova Bara wasn't demolished or resettled. Mokroluški potok was later conducted underground, into the city's sewage system. It has been conducted below the ground in Marinkova Bara, where the pouring cascade was built to carry the water into the sewage collector, while the bed of the Mokroluški potok, prior to reaching the cascade has been channeled. The entire complex was renovated in 2009 when the new parallel canal, the grid above the collector and the protective fence have been built.  Characteristics  It is mostly a low-class neighborhood, with the common yards and small, individual houses. Most of the population are the Romani, but as the neighborhood is old, it is fully urbanized and thus not classified as an informal settlement. It is known for many small stores, repair and craftsmen shops, etc. Some of the installations of the Serbian power company, Elektrodistribucija and facilities of the Belgrade's communal company are located in the western parts of the neighborhood.The Branislav Nušić elementary school was established in the neighborhood in 1935.  Siva Stena  Siva Stena () is the southern extension of Marinkova Bara, formerly considered to be one the same neighborhood. Today, center of the neighborhood is located around the street of the same name, which connects Braće Jerković street on the west and Zaplanjska street on the east. Many areas of former Marinkova Bara-Siva Stena neighborhood which was periphery of Belgrade before World War II are today occupied by the Central Cemetery, built in 1939, while the eastern and southern extensions were detached and since the 1960s urbanized into the modern neighborhoods of Medaković I and Braće Jerković, respectively. Today, Siva Stena forms a local community (mesna zajednica), administrative sub-municipal unit, within the municipality of Voždovac and forms urban connection between the neighborhoods of Marinkova Bara, Medaković I, Braće Jerković, Dušanovac and Voždovac itself. According to the last census from 2011, it had a population of 6,574. Despite the influx of refugees as the result of the Yugoslav Wars from 1991 and migrations from South Serbia, especially from the Leskovac region, population has been steadily declining for decades.

Although cattle ranching historically played an important role in the area, Mount Vaca and the nearby city of Vacaville are actually named for Juan Manuel Cabeza Vaca (1782-1856), who with Juan Felipe Pena received in 1843 the Rancho Los Putos Mexican land grant, which included the peak that now bears Vaca's name.

These roads intersect Blue Ridge Road, which follows the ridge top to the summit high point. Doppler Radar weather tower on top of Mt. Vaca.  High- definition Doppler weather radar  The San Francisco Bay Area is surrounded by mountain ranges that obstruct weather radar, even government broadcasts, thereby leaving blind spots in the weather prediction system. As a consequence, television station KPIX-TV, a San Francisco CBS affiliate, partnered with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) to build a Doppler weather radar on top of Mt. Vaca. Before this, the mountain blocked radar information about storms coming in from the Northwest, which compromised weather prediction and allowed for flooding, heavy rains, and high winds without prior warnings. This new radar system gives meteorologists a more complete view of precipitation and temperature patterns in the Bay Area, and allows for more accurate weather predictions.

Construction was planned to start in the spring of 1968, while the complete resettlement was to be finished by 1971. Since 1970s and especially 1980s, the neighborhood was transformed with the construction of the highrise.  Medaković II  Medaković II or colloquially Medak II, is the central section. It borders the neighborhoods of Medaković I (west), Marinkova Bara (north), Braće Jerković (south) and Medaković III (east). It is entirely residential area, with central part constructed of 11 half-sphered buildings, centered on the roundabout of the bus line 30.  Medaković III  Medaković III or colloquially Medak III, is the eastern and newer section of the neighborhood, mostly finished in the 1980s, but the full completion (arrangement of the green areas, streets, etc.) has not been done. It consists of similar, orange-white buildings with inclined, alpine-look rooftops. Medaković III is bordered by the neighborhoods of Medaković II (west), Padina (south) and Marinkova Bara (north, along the highway). It had the population of 13,333 in 2011.

Retrieved July 31, 2016Umberto Benigni, in: History It is not known when Cassano became an episcopal See. Some place the establishment in the 5th century, though without supporting evidence. In 859 Cassano and Cosenza were the headquarters of the Gastaldates of the Lombards of the Duchy of Benevento. In their turn the Lombards were attacked again and again, as were the Greeks in south Italy, by the Saracens (Arabs and Moors). The Greeks were able to drive the Saracens away, and reorganized Calabria as part of the Greek Empire and the Greek Church of Constantinople. Cassano was established around this time as a suffragan diocese of the Greek Metropolitan of Reggio Calabria.Duchesne, p. 11, p. 15. Canon Antonio Minervini, in: D'Avino, p. 152. In 1059 mention is made of a bishop of Cassano, whose name is not reported. He was engaged, along with the Provost of Gerace, in resisting the advance of the Normans, led by Robert Guiscard and his brothers. A battle took place against Count Roger at San Martino in Valle Salinarum, in which the Greeks, led by the bishop of Cassano, were defeated.Gaufredus Malaterrae, Historia Siculae Book I, chapter xxxii, in: Ludovico Antonio Muratori (ed.), Rerum Italicarum Scriptores Tomus V (Milan 1723), p. 557. Kehr, p. 25. In 1096 we read of a bishop of Cassano known as Saxo (Sassone), who was a Vicar of Pope Urban II and Pope Paschal II in the region.Kehr, pp. 26-27. In the 11th Century, the Diocese became a Suffragan of Reggio Calabria. Pope Paschal II (1099–1118), however, granted the Church of Cassano complete immunity from the jurisdiction of the Metropolitanate of Reggio Calabria, and took it directly under the protection of the Holy See.Kehr, p. 27 no. 2. On 20 October 1144, King Roger II of Sicily confirmed the privileges of the Church of Cassano.Kehr, p. 27, commentary on no. 2. Biagio Cappelli, \\"In document di Ruggiero II per la diocesi di Cassano Jonio,\\" Bolletino ecclesiastico della diocese di Cassano Jonio 42 (1964), fasc. 3, pp. 63-64. On February 13, 1919, the Diocese had territory transferred to create the Eparchy of Lungro for the Italo-Albanian Catholic Church.See Canon Antonio Minervini, in: D'Avino, pp. 159-160. On January 30, 2001, the Archdiocese of Cosenza-Bisignano was elevated to a Metropolitan See with Cassano all'Jonio as a suffragan diocese. =Seminary= In accordance with the decrees of the Council of Trent, Bishop Serbelloni (1561–1579) appointed a committee to plan the creation of a seminary for the diocese of Cassano. The seminary was formally created by a decree of Bishop Carafa on 6 March 1588, and in 1593 Bishop Audoeno (Owen Lewis) fixed the number of scholars at twelve, and for the next century the number never exceeded twenty. The seminary was perpetually short of funds.Canon Antonio Minervini, in: D'Avino, p. 162. =Cathedral= The old cathedral was consecrated by Bishop Tomacelli on 3 May 1491. The bell tower was completed by Bishop Gaetano in 1608. The new cathedral was consecrated on 22 March 1722 by Bishop Francesco Maria Loyerio of Umbriatico. The decoration of the Choir was completed in 1750. The stucco façade of the cathedral was completed by Bishop Coppola in 1795, and the marble pulpit installed. Many of the treasures of the cathedral were stolen or damaged during the revolutionary period 1798–1806.Canon Antonio Minervini, in: D'Avino, p. 155. The Cathedral was governed by a Chapter, composed (in 1752) of four dignities and eighteen Canons.Ritzler-Sefrin, VI, p. 152, note 1.

It is located in Rygge, outside Moss and outside Oslo. It also served as a regional airport for Østfold county and owned and was operated by the private company Rygge Sivile Lufthavn AS. Moss/Rygge shut down to all civilian traffic on 1 November 2016. The airport is however co-located with the still operational Rygge Air Station, operated by the Royal Norwegian Air Force, which also owns the land and runway. The control tower services (air traffic control) are operated by Avinor. The airport opened on 8 October 2007, but did not officially open until 14 February 2008, when regular scheduled services started. The airport has a capacity for 2 million passengers per year, but could not reach this because of a concession limit of 21,000 annual air movements. The airport handled 1,890,889 passengers in 2013. The airport used to be a major base for Ryanair from March 2010 until October 2016 and was also served to a much lesser extent by Norwegian Air Shuttle and few charter operators. The airport has been closed to all civilian traffic since 1 November 2016 due to a proposal from its main commercial operator, Ryanair, to shut down its base at the airport on that date after a new Norwegian passenger tax was introduced.en.ryg.no - Oslo Rygge Airport closing business November 1st 2016 28 June 2016 There are plans to reopen the airport for passenger traffic. There is interest from airlines, but aircraft delivery delays mean opening is planned for spring 2021 (as of spring 2020). History =Early years= The first aerodrome at Rygge was built in 1942 and 1943, but was located about west from the current runway. The aerodrome was closed in 1945, but reopened in 1949 as a military aviation school, although the school only remained for two years. In 1952 it was decided that Rygge was to become a military air station which met NATO specifications. This included the expropriation of of land, costing NOK 12 million. The new Rygge Main Air Station was established on 15 September 1954, after investments of NOK 127 million. The old airport was closed and remained a camp until it was closed in 2003. Rygge Main Air Station hosted the 332 Squadron, and later the 336 Squadron and the 720 Squadron 330 Squadron. From 2003, the fighter jets were moved from Rygge to Bodø Main Air Station. =The airport during the 1990s= On 8 October 1998, Oslo Airport, Gardermoen took over the role as the main airport serving Oslo and Eastern Norway from Oslo Airport, Fornebu. Several other locations, including Hurum, Hobøl and Ås, had been considered, all which were located closer to Oslo and the Oslofjord area. The choice of location was controversial, in part because Gardermoen would be located further than Fornebu from among other things Østfold and Follo. In 1998, a report was made by SCC Trafikon which concluded that by building a civilian section at Rygge Air Station, it would be possible to generate 130,000 passengers per year, of which 40,000 would be charter travels. This was a higher passenger potential than Torp. Several regional airlines, such as Teddy Air, Air Stord and Coast Air, all stated that they could be interested in routes from Rygge, while Scandinavian Airlines, Braathens and Widerøe stated that they were not interested in flying from the airport. The idea was initially supported by local parliamentarians, Østfold County Council and the Confederation of Norwegian Enterprise. The latter stated that the most important air routes were those to Gardermoen and Torp, while the Trafikon report recommended routes to Bergen, Stavanger, Trondheim and Copenhagen. In February 1999, Minister of Transport and Communications Dag Jostein Fjærvoll stated that he supported the opening of civilian traffic from Rygge. Estimates from then were for an investment of 80 million Norwegian krone for a capacity of 150,000 annual passengers. However, the plans allowed for further expansion to 500,000 annual passengers. In July, the operating company Rygge Sivile Lufthavn was established. Owners were Borregaard (46.7%), Østfold County Municipality (20%), M. Peterson & Søn (16.6%) and Capricorn Invest (16.6%). The share capital was initially NOK 3 million. Egil Ullebø was appointed the company's chair. According to the plans, the company would need NOK 50 million in share capital, and the Norwegian Civil Airport Administration was intended to own 34% of the airport. =Development since 2000= The control tower at Rygge in 1983 Two General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcons taking off from Rygge Check-in area Arrivals hall On 12 January 2000, Københavns Lufthavne, which operates among other things Copenhagen Airport, bought 33.3% of the shares in Rygge Sivile Lufthavn. The company stated that they had invited the Norwegian Civil Airport Administration to purchase part of the company, but that no decision had been made by the government agency. The company stated that they were therefore forced to invite a foreign airport operate to purchase part of the company to have sufficient competence in airport operations. In December, the Norwegian Civil Airport Administration stated that they were negative to the plans for civilian traffic at Rygge. The administration operates with the model that the large airports, in particular Gardermoen, make a profit, which is used to finance the deficits at smaller airports. The administration stated that establishing a civilian airport at Rygge would undermine the financial structure of Norwegian airports and would breach the political presumptions for constructing Gardermoen. If the administration was to be able to complete on price with Rygge, the state would have to give the necessary grants to cover the deficits at other airports. At the same time, Torp was required to pay their own air traffic control costs, which until then had been covered by the administration. In September 2001, the Norwegian Competition Authority supported the airport, stating that it would allow more competition on international flights from Norway, and could make it easier to establish domestic competition in the face of Scandinavian Airline's take-over of Braathens. In June 2002, Norwegian Air Shuttle stated that they would start flights from Rygge, should the airport be built. At the same time, the military and the airport company were discussing where the optimal location for the terminal should be. Once decided, the Rygge Sivile Lufthavn hoped to send an application for a concession to the Ministry of Transport and Communications. In March 2003, Rygge Labour Party stated they were opposed to the civilian airport, because of the local noise concerns. In May, the airport company confirmed that Ryanair, which was using Torp, had shown interest in using Rygge. In June, the Rygge Sivile Lufthavn stated that had changed their strategy, and that they now were going to primarily target low-cost airlines. The airport hoped to initially establish routes to Copenhagen, Stockholm, London and Amsterdam, and that international destinations would be prioritized before domestic destinations. In February 2004, the Civil Aviation Authority stated that 51 issues needed to be resolved before civilian traffic would be permitted. In a report published by the ministry in March 2004, it was estimated that the airport would have 700,000 to 800,000 passengers per year, making it the eighth largest in the country, and could have 1.3 million passengers by 2030. In a reply, the Federation of Norwegian Aviation Industries stated that they were opposed to establishing a new airport, and that there were sufficient airports in Eastern Norway. They also said that an airport outside Avinor (the new name for the Norwegian Civil Airport Administration) would result lower profits at Gardermoen, and thus higher fees for the rest of the airports. In addition, the airlines would have higher costs having to operate to additional airports in Eastern Norway. The project was also met with local protests. In particular, they were concerned about emission into the lake, Vansjø, or alternatively to a Ramsar site in Kurefjorden, and about the local noise pollution, with the airport being located close to Moss. Natur og Ungdom were also opposed to the airport, stating that it would increase the amount of air traffic and thus result in an increase in greenhouse gases. Københavns Lufthavne sold its ownership in the company during 2004, because they were not satisfied with the progress. On 18 November 2004, the air force received the necessary concessions from the ministry to establish a civilian section. The concession contained a limit of 750,000 passengers per year, and had a duration of 10 years. It also required the airport to be open from 07h to 23h every day and permit general aviation. Negotiations between the air force and Rygge Sivile Lufthavn started in June 2005 to establish an agreement regarding operations and financing. In September, the air force and the company came to an agreement regarding the company's compensation to the military. The agreement was approved by the Ministry of Defence in January 2006. On 22 February, all permissions had been granted, and the company was able to take an investment decision. The agreements involved, in addition to a new terminal, upgrades to the runway, taxiway and navigational systems, which would be paid for by Rygge Sivile Lufthavn. On 2 March, the Thon Group purchased 40% of the company. The remaining owners are the Orkla Group (40%), which at the time owned Borregaard, Østfold County Municipality (11%) and Østfold Energi (9%). On 12 June, activists from Natur og Ungdom chained themselves to the control tower in protest against the establishment of civilian aviation. The contract to build the terminal was awarded Skanska. In July, State Secretary Steinulf Tungesvik stated that if necessary, the ministry would use its right to set the prices at Rygge so it would not capture revenue from Gardermoen. At the same time, representatives from Torp, the Federation of Norwegian Aviation Industries and the Conservative Party stated that the agreement between the military and the operating company was illegal subsidies. In September, the Thon Group announced they would not build a planned tall hotel at the airport, as military regulations would not permit it. In January 2007, the charter operators Star Tour, Apollo and MyTravel Airways announced that they would start operating charter flights from 1 October. The initial construction was for seven gates, with possibilities to expand to fourteen. The first phase cost NOK 700 million and included a terminal with a capacity for two million annual passengers, parking for 1650 cars and various travel facilities, such as duty-free stores, bank and restaurants. By April the airport still only had a single weekly charter route planned and the airport considered postponing. Prof. Frode Steen at the Norwegian School of Economics and Business Administration said that the airlines were postponing to get a better negotiating position. On 7 September, the final agreements between Rygge Sivile Lufthavn and the military were signed. The airport was opened on 5 October 2007. The first flight from the airport took place on 17 October to Las Palmas de Gran Canaria, Spain. The operator later increased with three more charter destinations in early 2008. At the time of the first flight, the operator had sold 95% of the seats on their flights until the end of the year. 85% of the sales were to people living in Østfold. From that day, UniBuss started a coach service from Oslo in correspondence with all departures and arrivals at the airport. The Civil Aviation Authority introduced a non-flight limitation on the airport from 23 to 07, out of consideration for the airport's neighbors. This was despite the municipal councils in Råde and Rygge supporting night flights. The decision was appealed, with the airport wanting to operate from 06:30 to 23:30, stating that they could lose half of Norwegian's departures. The ministry granted such a permit on 25 January 2008. This prompted a lawsuit from 150 households within the noise zone, who stated that people with similar noise pollution around Gardermoen had been granted NOK 225,000 in compensation each. Norwegian Air Shuttle established a base at Rygge on 14 February 2008, with a second aircraft being stationed at the airport from 13 March. From February to April, Norwegian Air Shuttle started international flights to Alicante, Athens, Barcelona, Belgrade, Budapest, Istanbul, London, Málaga, Marrakech, Palanga, Szczecin, Valencia, Warsaw, with between two and four weekly services to each destination. In addition, the airline started two daily services to Bergen. Norwegian's services to Belgrade, Istanbul, Marrakech, Szczecin and Valencia were all terminated at Gardermoen the same time as they opened at Rygge. The airport stated that they had also been approached by Ryanair, who wanted to move the bulk of their services from Torp, but the airport stated that there was room for only one airline, and that they had prioritized Norwegian. The first Norwegian Air Shuttle plane took off at the 14 February 2008 heading for Budapest. The same day, the Norwegian State Railways started offering a shuttle bus service from Rygge Station on the Østfold Line to the airport. At the same time, Norwegian Business Aviation started offering executive jets from Rygge. From March, Widerøe started two daily services from Rygge to Copenhagen, the hub for their owner, Scandinavian Airlines. Apollo started flights to Chania from 11 May. Star Tour started weekly charter flights to Antalya, Chania and Palma de Mallorca during the first half of 2008. From 1 September, Widerøe terminated its Copenhagen route, while Norwegian terminated its London service. In October, Norwegian Air Shuttle introduced new international services to Las Palmas de Gran Canaria, Berlin, Kraków and Prague. New domestic routes were introduced to Trondheim, Stavanger, Tromsø and Bodø. The airport stated that at the growth rate they were experiencing, they would reach their passenger ceiling in 2009, and would not have room for any other airlines than Norwegian. In November, the airport stated that they in 2008 would lose NOK 100 million, and that they needed between NOK 200 and 300 million in new share capital. However, neither Orkla nor Thon were willing to invest more in the airport unless the passenger ceiling was lifted. In a vote in the Parliament of Norway on 11 December, the ceiling was not lifted, with the proposal only receiving votes from the opposition. However, the ministry stated that they were going to consider the limitations in the concession. In January, the owners invested 50 million in the company. The airport had 450,000 passengers in 2008. In January, Rygge was, with 24,400 passengers, larger than Torp in terms of domestic traffic. In February, the Civil Aviation Authority recommended that the airport's ceiling be lifted, and this was made effective by the ministry on 1 July. Instead, the airport was limited to 15,000 air movements per year. The ministry stated that the rationale was that the calculations for the original concession were based on smaller aircraft, and that the passenger ceiling was based on an estimated 20,000 take-offs and landings. From January through April, the domestic services from Rygge had captured 6% of the market share from Eastern Norway. In October and November, Ryanair established itself at the airport, and started flights to Alicante, Barcelona, Brussels, Bremen, Madrid, Milan and London. Norwegian stated that they were not worried about competition from Ryanair, and announced that they would continue with flights to the Mediterranean, Eastern Europe and domestically. However, they would not start the announced services to Amsterdam and London, and instead concentrate their growth at Gardermoen. The company stated that they made 3% of their revenue at Rygge. On 9 September, the ministry increased the air movement ceiling to 21,000 movements per year. On 24 November, Ryanair announced that they would establish a base at Rygge in March 2010. The airline would start services to Århus, Berlin, Dublin, Weeze, Eindhoven, Gdańsk, Kraków, La Rochelle, Málaga, Munich, Palma de Mallorca, Paris, Riga, Wrocław, Valencia and Venice. In December, the company announced further routes to Faro and Zadar. In 2009, the airport company lost NOK 102 million. From 5 May, Ryanair started flights to Kaunas. In mid-2010, Norwegian terminated its services to Berlin, Budapest, Palanga, Prague and Valencia, and reduced the frequency to Alicante and Málaga. However, it started new routes to Dalaman and Thessaloniki. In July, Norwegian stated that they were considering terminating all services from Rygge. In particular, the company stated that they were not satisfied with having higher fees than Ryanair, and that they were in negotiations with Torp to move their operations there. In September, Norwegian announced that it was terminating the services to Bodø and Tromsø. In November 2010, the instrument landing system (ILS) was upgraded from Category I to Category II. This included the installation of 800 light emitting diodes (LED) on the runway and taxiway, making Rygge the first airport in Europe with such an installation. It decreased the requirement for visibility from . The upgrades cost NOK 65 million, and made Rygge the second airport with ILS Cat II in Norway, after Stavanger Airport, Sola (Gardermoen has Cat III). The same month, Ryanair started new routes to London, Liverpool, Rome, Tampere. At the same time, Norwegian terminated its service to Stavanger. =Closure to civilian traffic= The airport announced on 24 May 2016 that it would cease civilian operations by 1 November 2016, stating that the Norwegian air passenger charge made Rygge uncompetitive. Ryanair, the airport's largest customer (the only other airline offering a few regular services being Norwegian Air Shuttle), had earlier announced it would pull out of Rygge if the air passenger charge was not removed.newsinenglish.no - Ryanair’s airport ‘will shut down’ 24 May 2016 Ryanair accounted for around two thirds of traffic at the airport and served 29 destinations, of which 16 were year-round, from Moss/Rygge as of October 2016. Business travellers did not really use the airport. Attempts were made by typical business airlines on domestic flights and destinations like London, which were not successful. Business travellers usually require frequent departures and Ryanair offered sparse schedules with often a few flights per destination and week. The attempts on domestic flights were also less attractive since Rygge could not compete with Gardermoen on frequency. On 1 June 2016, Ryanair confirmed it will close its base at Moss/Rygge by 29 October 2016. Ryanair subsequently cancelled 16 routes to/from the Oslo area entirely, while moving 8 routes to Sandefjord Airport, Torp and 2 routes to the primary Oslo Airport, Gardermoen. Ryanair wrote that the tax forced them to halve their traffic to and from Norway. Since Rygge could not sustain half the traffic, the decision was made to close it. The last aircraft to depart was an empty Ryanair Boeing 737-800 on a ferry flight to Göteborg on 30 October. Facilities =Overview= Apron view with two Ryanair Boeing 737-800s at Moss Airport, Rygge The airport is a joint military and civilian airport located in the municipality of Rygge, west of the lake Vansjø. The airport is primarily an international, low-cost airport, but also serves as a domestic regional airport for Østfold and Follo. The airport is owned by the Norwegian Defence Estates Agency, while the civilian terminal is owned by Rygge Sivile Lufthavn AS (\\"Rygge Civilian Airport\\"), a private company owned by the Thon Group (40%), the Orkla Group (40%), Østfold Energi (15%) and Østfold County Municipality (5%). The terminal building is , and is dimensioned for 2 million passengers annually. The terminal is open around the clock. There are eight gates and seven aircraft stands, of which two can switch between domestic and international departures. The runway is long and wide. It is equipped with instrument landing system Category II using solely light emitting diodes (LED) as lights. This allows landing with visibility. The airport has a taxiway and a de-icing platform. =Military= Rygge Air Station is home to the 720 Squadron of the Royal Norwegian Air Force (NoRAF), which operates Bell 412 helicopters, the 717 Squadron which operates Dassault Falcon 20 jets, and a detachment of the 330 Squadron which operates Westland Sea King search and rescue helicopters. The air station also hosts several support functions, including education, logistics of the air force, and branch of the Norwegian Home Guard. The military run all common functions of the airport, such as the runway, fire and rescue service, and the air traffic control. Airlines and destinations As of 30 October 2016, there is no longer any scheduled commercial traffic to and from Moss/Rygge. Ryanair shut down its entire operations on 29 October 2016 while the only other regular tenant, Norwegian Air Shuttle, left a few days earlier. Ground transport Rygge Station with a Class 73B electric multiple unit of the Norwegian State Railways =Car= Moss Airport, Rygge is located from Oslo; this compares to for Gardermoen and for Torp. The terminal building is located next to European Route E6. The airport is located 45 minutes from Oslo, and 12 minutes from Moss, and 25 minutes from Fredrikstad. Access to Buskerud runs via the Oslofjord Tunnel, while Vestfold is available via the Moss–Horten Ferry. There is parking for 2,500 cars at the airport. =Rail= The airport is located from Rygge Station on the Østfold Line. The railway station is from Oslo Central Station (Oslo S) and is served by the Norwegian State Railways, who operate an hourly regional train service between Oslo and Halden using NSB Class 73 electric multiple units, with an extra departure in the rush hour. Three of the daily services continue onwards south to Gothenburg, Sweden. Travel time to Oslo S is 50 minutes, to Halden is 55 minutes, and to Gothenburg C is 3 hours and 3 minutes. NSB operates a free shuttle bus to Moss Airport, Rygge, which takes 8 minutes. There is a waiting room in the station building =Coach= Prior to the closure of the airport, UniBuss operated Rygge-Ekspressen from Oslo with a travel time of 60 minutes. The bus service ran in correspondence with all of Norwegian's and Ryanair's flights, leaving 2 hours and 40 minutes before departure. NOR-WAY Bussekspress operated the service Flybussekspressen, which ran from Fredrikstad & Sarpsborg via Moss Airport, Moss and Follo to Oslo Airport, Gardermoen. Travel time to Fredrikstad was 30 minutes, Sarpsborg 20, and travel time to Gardermoen is 1 hour and 40 minutes.

A fullo was a Roman fuller or laundry worker (plural: fullones), known from many inscriptions from Italy and the western half of the Roman Empire and references in Latin literature, e.g. by Plautus, Martialis and Pliny the Elder. A fullo worked in a fullery or fullonica. There is also evidence that fullones dealt with cloth straight from the loom, though this has been doubted by some modern scholars.Ostia Topographical Dictionary In some large farms, fulleries were built where slaves were used to clean the cloth. In several Roman cities, the workshops of fullones, have been found. The most important examples are in Ostia and Pompeii, but fullonicae also have been found in Delos, Florence, Fréjus and near Forlì: in the Archaeological Museum of Forlì, there is an ancient relief with a fullery view. While the small workshops at Delos go back to the 1st century BC, those in Pompeii date from the 1st century AD and the establishments in Ostia and Florence were built during the reign of the Emperors Trajan and Hadrian. The fulling process Fulling consisted of three main phases. These include soaping, rinsing and finishing. =Soaping= Clothes were treated in small tubs standing in niches surrounded by low walls. The fuller stood with his feet in the tub filled with water and a mixture of alkaline chemicals (sometimes including ammonia derived from urine) and trampled the cloth, scrubbed it, and wrung it out. The aim of this treatment was to apply the chemical agents to the cloth so that they could do their work - which was the resolving of greases and fats. The installations in which this treatment was done are usually referred to as 'treading stalls', 'fulling stalls' or, erroneously, 'saltus fullonicus' and are typical for fulling workshops and are often used by archaeologists to identify fullonicae in the archaeological remains. =Rinsing= After the clothes were soaped in the chemicals, the dirt that they had resolved had to be washed out. This happened with fresh water in a complex of large basins that often were connected to the urban water supply. The typical rinsing complex consisted of three or four basins that were connected to each other: the fresh water entered on one side of the complex, the dirty water left it on the other side. Clothes followed the opposite direction of the water and went from the basin with the dirtiest water to the basin with the cleanest water.Flohr 2006, 193-200. =Finishing= The last phase of the fulling process consisted of a variety of treatments. The precise sequence is not exactly known and may have varied, depending on the nature of the workshop and the demands of customers. * The cloth was often brushed, with the thistle of plants, and sheared, as is indicated from finds in some Pompeian fullonicae.Flohr 2006, 194 * Sometimes, clothes were also treated with sulfur. The cloth was then hung on a basket woven structure called a viminea cavea.Smith, William, A Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities (London, England: John Murray, 1875), article: \\"Fullo\\", pp, 551-553. This structure can be seen in the figure above. Fullones added sulfur to white cloths to maintain the color, knowing that sulfur was volatile enough to destroy colors. * The clothes were also pressed in a screw press. Remains of such presses have been found at Pompeii and Herculaneum, and a depiction was found in a Pompeian fullonica and is now displayed in the National Museum in Naples. The fullo and the state According to Pliny the Elder, the work of fullones was taken very seriously. C. Flaminius and L. Aemilius wrote the proper method for fullones to practice in the Metilian Law. The law stressed the use of Cimolian earth (similar to Fuller's earth) to brighten and freshen colors that have faded due to sulfur. On the other hand, the law stated that the mineral saxum was useful for white clothing but harmful to colors.Pliny the Elder, Naturalis Historia, XXXV.57 Fullones were legally responsible for the clothes they were washing. Fullones were subject to penalties if they returned the wrong clothes or damaged the clothes. Furthermore, clothes once washed were considered devalued. In fact, Emperor Elagabalus said that he would not touch linen that had been washed because such cloth had already been devalued.Elagabalus, Historia Augusta, IIVI. Still, the profession of a fullo was highly reputable. Fullones in Ostia created their own guild, called Corpus Fontanorum. While the fuller guild of Pompeii dedicated a statue to Eumachia in the Building of Eumachia on the Roman Forum. It is not clear the connection between Eumachia and the Fullers, but the building may have been used for selling cloth, although it could have been a market for anything. These Roman launderers worshipped the goddess Minerva, as did many other professions. Therefore, the fullones were particularly involved with Quinquatrus, Minerva’s main feast held on March 19. The feast often took place in a fullo's workshops.Peck, H. (1898). Fullo at Harpers Dictionary of Classical Antiquities. New York: Harper and Brothers. Fullones are associated with representations of owls, such as in Roman graffiti found in Pompeii. There has been a lively scholarly debate whether the association is due to the owl of Minerva or due to Varro's proverbial phrase: \\"men fear him worse than the fuller fears the screech owl\\". Sat. Men. 86. 4 Archaeological remains of fullonicae Thus far, eleven fullonicae are known at Pompeii, the most famous of which is the Fullonica of Stephanus along the Via dell'Abbondanza, where the remains of the fulling workshop can be seen in the back of the house. Most other workshops are rather small and are hard to recognize. Recent fieldwork by the Radboud University Nijmegen has resulted in the definitive identification of three previously unknown fulling workshops Cleaning the Laundries 2006-2008 www.mikoflohr.nl/archaeology/ctl At Ostia, three extremely large fullonicae have been excavated along with two smaller ones. Best preserved is the large fullonica of the Via degli Augustali.A lot of material has been assembled on Ostia Antica An important recent development is the excavation of an exceptionally large fulling workshop in Casal Bertone, in Rome. This workshop is three times as large as the large Ostian fullonicae and was discovered during a rescue excavation for the construction of the high- speed railway from Roma Tiburtina to Naples. It was situated outside the ancient city in an area that also functioned as a necropolis.The excavation is currently unpublished, but has attracted some attention from international media: International Herald Tribune, July 31, 2007; Washington Post, August 1, 2007. The workshop is often erroneously referred to as a tannery. This workshop is probably the largest workshop from antiquity.

He was one of the most influential leaders in the pre-Duvalier era, a liberal labor organizer in Port-au-Prince so popular among urban workers that he could call upon them at a moment's notice to hold mass protests, known as \\"\\"—Haitian Creole for \\"steamroller.\\" Early life Fignolé was born in the coastal town of Pestel to an impoverished family and moved to Port-au-Prince in 1927 at age 14 to seek education and work. Despite constant ill health because of chronic malnutrition, he excelled in school and was accepted to one of the city's most prestigious institutions. He made a living tutoring the children of Haiti's wealthy elite. Political career Fignolé co-founded in 1942 a newspaper called Chantiers with a liberal noiriste political slant. In it he lambasted Haïtï's mulatto elite for their selfishness and argued for broad social programs to uplift the majority black-skinned poor. Then president Élie Lescot responded to harsh critiques by closing the paper, firing Fignolé from his government teaching position, and placing him under police surveillance. He continued his political activity, quickly becoming known among Port-au- Prince's poor working class as 'le professeur' or as in English, \\"the professor\\" for his impassioned orations, writing, and leadership of labor strikes. By 1946, he was known for having the power to flood the streets instantly with the urban poor in demonstrations. These flash mobs were called \\"woulos\\", or steamrollers. The following year he agreed to lead the Mouvement Ouvrier Paysan (\\"Peasant Worker Movement\\" or MOP), which would become most organized labor party in Haitian history and the largest mass organization in the pre-Duvalier era. It included factory workers, dockworkers, hydraulic workers, gas station workers, barbers, dessert chefs, and laborers from other sectors. He wanted to run for the Haitian presidency, but at age 33 he was barred by the Haitian constitution. Fignolé was at various points spied on, beaten, and imprisoned by authorities for his labor activism. Fignolé and François Duvalier shared in common a noirist politics of black empowerment and collaborated at times in political dissent against ruling regimes. Under the government of Dumarsais Estimé, Fignolé briefly held the post of Minister of Education. He refused to tone down his attacks on the mulatto elite, saying, \\"If anyone thinks they can stop what I am doing for my people, I will be forced to use my woulo to destroy them!\\" But unlike Duvalier, Fignolé had little political support in the countryside beyond the capital city. Short- lived presidency On 25 May 1957, amidst a chaotic election process and spiraling civil strife, Fignolé was designated as provisional president because of his unsurpassed popularity in Port-au-Prince. As Fignolé descended the steps of the National Palace on the day of his inauguration, crowds of ecstatic supporters waving MOP flags streamed into the streets and converged on the palace grounds. He pledged to raise the daily wage and expressed determination to remain in office, angering his opponents. Although Fignolé promised a Franklin D. Roosevelt-style New DealChaos in a Caribbean Hotspot Life magazine and was explicitly anti-communist, his politics had long made him suspicious in the eyes of the Cold War-era American administrations. United States Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) director Allen Dulles warned President Dwight D. Eisenhower that Fignolé had \\"a strong leftist orientation\\". The administration refused to recognize the Fignolé government, whose political program was seen as \\"comparable with the Soviets.\\" Eisenhower told the French Embassy in Washington, D.C. that he was worried that Fignolé \\"might eventually become another Arbenz\\", referring to the social-democratic President of Guatemala overthrown three years earlier in a CIA-backed coup d'état. With foreign governments and most elements of Haiti's traditional power structure arrayed against him, Fignolé could not hold on to power. After just 19 days, the Haitian armed forces, with U.S. foreknowledge, broke into the presidential chambers. They seized Fignolé, forced him at gunpoint to sign a resignation letter, and bundled him into a waiting car. From exile in New York City, Fignolé blamed Duvalier, a rival candidate for president, for his overthrow. But his demands for reinstatement fell on deaf ears. For days, rioting Fignolé supporters in poor districts were gunned down by soldiers under Antonio Kébreau's military regime. The morgues filled with thousands of bodies, according to media reports.HAITI: Fignole Falls Time magazine With ties to the army, Duvalier won a sham election and became head of state. His family's rule would last 29 years. Return from exile In 1986, after the fall of Jean-Claude Duvalier, who succeeded his father, an ailing 73-year-old Fignolé returned from a long exile to Port-au-Prince. Scores of supporters welcomed him at the airport. He died a few months later.

Geography The road is located in the Apennine Mountains and passes through Gran Sasso and Monti della Laga National Park, connecting Montorio al Vomano to Amiternum. The road ascends the Vomano Valley up to the altitude Capannelle Pass of the Apennines, then winds its way down, passing through the archaeological site of Amiternum, eastwards towards L'Aquila. The road is an enchanting portion of the old thoroughfare connecting the provincial capitals of Teramo and L'Aquila. On 1 December 1984 the tunnel under the Grand Sasso was open to the public and from then onward this ancient but important artery transversing the Apennines has mainly served the local population living nearby. To highlight its new role as a touristic mecca, the Gran Sasso National Park administrators rebaptized the road \\"Strada maestra del Parco\\" (Grand Highway of the Park). Recreation Over the years the canton buildings previously used by the road workers have been transformed one by one into forest ranger offices and tourist information centers. They serve as well equipped way stations for the many visitors who come to travel the area by car, on bicycle, or with a motorcycle. Lake Campotosto can be reached in just a few minutes from the Grand Highway of the Gran Sasso and Monti della Laga National Park. Also nearby are the important Abruzzo ski resorts, Prati di Tivo and Prato Selva. Not far from the Gran Sasso and midway between L'Aquila and Teramo, lies a high plain.

Originally, \\"MAS\\" referred to (armed motorboat SVAN, (Naval Automobile Society of Venice).Naval Weaponry: Italy's MAS Torpedo Boats MAS were essentially motorboats with displacements of 20–30 tonnes (depending on the class), a 10-man crew and armament composed of two torpedoes, heavy machine guns and occasionally a 37 mm or 20 mm cannon. The term \\"MAS\\" is an acronym for , (assault craft) in the unit name (assault craft flotilla), the most famous of which was the Decima MAS of World War II. World War I An early MAS, from a magazine article published in January 1917 An Italian sailor manning a quick-firing gun, a 1-pounder (37 mm) Hotchkiss, on a MAS, 1917 MAS were widely employed by Regia Marina during World War I in 1915–1918. Models used were directly derived from compact civilian motorboats, provided with petrol engines which were compact and reliable (characteristics which were not common at the time) . They were used not only in the anti-submarine patrol role, but also for daring attacks against major units of the Austro-Hungarian Navy. A significant success came in December 1917, when an MAS boat managed to sink the pre-dreadnought battleship in Trieste harbor. The greatest success of Italian MAS was the sinking of the Austro-Hungarian battleship off Pula on 10 June 1918 by a boat commanded by Luigi Rizzo. MAS boats later engaged in the Second Battle of Durazzo in October 1918. The main Austrian fleet remained securely at anchor in the harbour at Pola (now Pula in Croatia), protected by several layers of defensive booms, impassable to conventional MAS boats. A special version, the Grillo-class tracked torpedo motorboat or (Jumping Boats) were designed, which featured a pair of spiked continuous tracks, intended to allow them to clamber over the booms which were supported by large timber baulks. The boats were powered by an electric motor for a silent approach and carried two torpedoes. Four were built; the first two were scuttled when their slow motors failed to get them to the harbour booms at Pola before daybreak and in a second operation, another boat made such a loud clattering noise climbing the booms that it was spotted and destroyed by gunfire. Interwar Period and Spanish Civil War In 1926, four MAS boats were built for and purchased by the Royal Albanian Navy. They were named Tirana, Saranda, Durres, and Vlorë. During the Italian invasion of Albania they were seized and put into service by Italian forces. All survived World War II and in 1945 were returned to Albania. Four units were transferred to the Nationalist Navy during the Spanish Civil War in 1938: Sicilia (LT-18), ex MAS 100; Nápoles (LT-19), ex MAS 223; Cándido Pérez (LT-16), ex MAS 435; and Javier Quiroga (LT-17), ex MAS 436. World War II Italian MAS continued to be improved after the end of World War I, thanks to the availability of Isotta Fraschini engines. The MAS of World War II had a maximum speed of 45 knots, two 450 mm torpedoes and one machine gun. In 1940 there were 48 MAS 500-class units available. Older units were used in secondary theatres, such as the Italian East Africa. Notable war actions performed by MAS include the torpedoing of the Royal Navy C-class cruiser Capetown by MAS 213 of the 21st MAS Squadron working within the Red Sea Flotilla off Massawa, Eritrea; and the failed attack on the harbour of Malta in January 1941, which caused the loss of two motorboats, one of them recovered by the British, put in service as a tender and renamed XMAS. Five MAS were scuttled in Massawa in the first week of April 1941 as a part of the Italian plan for the wrecking of Massawa harbor in the face of the British advance. MAS 204, 206, 210, 213, and 216 were sunk in the harbor; four of the boats were in need of mechanical repairs and could not be evacuated. On 24 July 1941, amid heavy fire from the escorts, MAS 532 torpedoed and crippled the transport Sydney Star, escorted by the destroyer HMS Cossack and part of the British convoy GM 1. The steamer managed to limp to Malta assisted by the destroyer HMAS Nestor.Brown, David (2002). The Royal Navy and the Mediterranean: November 1940-December1941, Volume II. Routledge, pp. 147–148. On 1 December 1941, two Italian MAS boats engaged the Soviet icebreaker Anastas Mykoyan, en route from the Dardanelles to Suez, with machine gun fire and forced it to run aground on the Turkish coast off Kastelorizo. Even though the Soviet vessel was refloated and reached Haifa for repairs the next day, the action compelled the Turkish government to intern eight Soviet ships set to repeat the same journey. MAS 554, 554 and 557 sank three allied freighters on the night of 13 August 1942 off Cape Bon, in the course of Operation Pedestal, for a total tonnage of 48,500 tons.Greene, Jack & Massignani, Alessandro (1998). The Naval War in the Mediterranean, 1940–1943, Chatham Publishing, pp. 253–255. On 29 August 1942, a smaller type of MAS boat, the MTSM, torpedoed the British destroyer Eridge off El Daba, Egypt, disabling it for the remainder of the war.HMS Eridge (L68) The Italian torpedo boat MAS 528 on Lake Ladoga in June 1942, during the Siege of Leningrad A flotilla of MAS served at German request as reinforcements in the Black Sea for the planned attack on Sevastopol in June 1942. The MAS squadron came under intense air attack from Soviet fighter-bombers and torpedo boats but performed well. They sank the 5,000-ton steamer Abkhazia and disabled the 10,000-ton transport Fabritius, which was subsequently destroyed by Stuka dive-bombers. MAS boats destroyed troop barges and damaged Soviet warships. A MAS boat commander, Sub-Lieutenant Ettore Bisagno, was killed in battle. One MAS was destroyed and three damaged by fighter-bombers in September 1942 during a heavy attack on Yalta. In the early hours of 3 August 1942, three MAS boats torpedoed and disabled the Soviet cruiser Molotov south-west of Kerch. In May 1943, the seven MAS boats in the Black Sea were transferred to the Kriegsmarine. In August that year, they were transferred to the Romanian Navy. These seven boats were wooden-hulled, each displacing 25 tons. Top speed amounted to 42 knots, generated by petrol engines powering two shafts. They were armed with one 13 mm heavy machine gun or one 20 mm anti-aircraft gun, 6 depth charges and two 350 mm torpedoes.Conway's All the World's Fighting Ships, 1922-1946, Conway Maritime Press, 1980, pp. 313-314 Another flotilla of four MAS, the XII Squadriglia MAS, was deployed to Lake Ladoga in April 1942 to support the siege of Leningrad. They sank a Soviet gunboat of the Bira class, a 1,300-ton cargo ship and several barges.MAS operations on Lake Ladoga Soviet sources say that the gunboat, the Selemdzha, was only lightly damaged when the torpedo exploded in the lake's bottom, with two wounded on board. After the signing of the Cassibile agreement, MAS boats sank the German torpedo boat TA11 (ex French L'Iphigénie) at Piombino, on 11 September 1943. The obsolescence of small MAS became apparent during the conflict, and they were increasingly replaced by larger Yugoslavian E-boats built in Germany and by new improved versions, classified \\"MS\\" (Moto Siluranti) by the Regia Marina. A type of anti-submarine craft based on the MAS design was developed by the Italian Navy in World War II. This was the vedetta anti sommergibile, or \\"VAS\\", equipped with a good amount of anti-submarine warfare equipment given her small size.MAS, VAS, and MS Cultural legacy The Italian poet Gabriele d'Annunzio, who employed MAS in some of his World War I adventures, used the MAS acronym for his Latin motto: Memento audere semper (\\"remember always to dare\\").

Adjacent stations History Japanese Government Railways (JGR) built the station in the 1930s during the development of an alternative route for the Nagasaki Main Line along the coast of the Ariake Sea which was at first known as the Ariake Line. In the first phase of construction, the track was extended south from with opening on 9 March 1930 as the southern terminus. Hizen- Shiroishi, then named was opened on the same day as an intermediate station on the new track. On 1 December 1934, the entire route was completed and through- traffic achieved from Hizen-Yamaguchi through the station to Nagasaki. The line was then redesignated as part of the Nagasaki Main Line. On 1 April 1940, the station was renamed Hizen-Shiroishi. With the privatization of Japanese National Railways (JNR), the successor of JGR, on 1 April 1987, control of the station passed to JR Kyushu. On 15 October 2016, a new station building was opened.

Catherine Louisa Pirkis (6 October 1839 - 4 October 1910) was a British author of detective fiction. Throughout her career as a writer, Pirkis would sometimes write under the name of \\"C.L. Pirkis\\", as to avoid gender association.  Early life  Catherine Louisa Lyne was born to Lewis Stephens Lyne and his wife Susan, who were of a middle-class family. Her father was an accountant and comptroller for the Inland Revenue. Her grandfather was Reverend Richard Lyne, master of a grammar school at Liskeard, Cornwall and best known for authoring a widely used manual, The Latin Primer (1794). Catherine was baptized at Saint John The Baptist, Shoreditch, London on 6 November 1839.Ancestry.com. England, Select Births and Christenings, 1538-1975 [database on-line].

Catherine Lyne Pirkis is buried in Kensal Green Cemetery in London.  Career  Pirkis wrote a total of 14 novels in the years spanning between 1877 and 1894 and contributed to periodicals and magazines such as Belgravia.Kirk, John Foster. \\"Pirkis, Mrs. Catherine Louisa.\\" A Supplement to Allibone's Critical Dictionary of English Literature and British and American Authors. J. B. Lippincott Company, 1897, pg. 1237. Her first major novel, Disappeared from Her Home, represented her foray into the mystery genre with the story of a young girl disappearing from her home. This would also serve as a prelude to the creation of the female detective character Loveday Brooke, which she is best known for. The collection was serialized and featured in The Ludgate Monthly from February to July 1893, and formally published in physical book form by Hutchinson in 1894. The series followed a \\"casebook format\\", which was made popular by other reigning literary protagonists of the time like Sherlock Holmes, where detective characters had to identify the suspects of the mystery and actively set traps to capture them. The series was notable for being the first collection of detective stories that featured a female heroine created by a female author, which was unheard of in a time when most female protagonists were solely invented and described by male authors. The character Loveday Brooke was featured in \\"The May Magazines\\" edition of Glasgow Herald in 1893, where they reviewed Brooke as a character who \\"continues to outshine the detective Sherlock Holmes in preternatural prescience... We are just afraid Miss Brooke is too clever in catching criminals ever to catch a husband.” Specifically, this character was featured in Pirkis's final literary endeavor in 1894,The Experiences of Loveday Brooke, Lady Detective; a collection of seven detective stories that enjoyed a glowing reception. Loveday Brooke was dubbed the \\"female Sherlock Holmes\\" and her collection of stories were one of the bestselling successors to Sherlock Holmes. Frederick Edward Pirkis, husband of author Catherine Louisa Pirkis and social and animal rights activist.  Activism  Later in life, Pirkis would transition from literary endeavors to championing for animal rights. Together with her husband, Pirkis was one of the founders of the British National Canine Defense League in 1891. Pirkis and her husband helped to create the organization in cooperation with British aristocrat and fellow writer Lady Gertrude Georgina Stock, who wrote under the pseudonym George Douglas. Pirkis actively participated in the organization's \\"anti-vivisetionist movement,\\" which fought against cruel muzzling, chaining, experimentation, or treatment of dogs. In Pirkis' The Murder at Troyte's Hill in her collection The Experiences of Loveday Brooke, Lady Detective, Pirkis dramatizes the anti-vivisetionist movement by bridging the connection of human and animal physiology, satirizing vivisection, and comparing the experimentation of animals to the experiences of the working class. Known today by the name Dogs Trust, the organization is a nonprofit animal welfare charity and humane society whose mission is to \\"bring about the day when all dogs can enjoy a happy life, free of maltreatment, cruelty, and the threat of unnecessary destruction.\\" It is currently the largest charity for the welfare of dogs in the UK with 20 re-homing centers and an international re-homing center opened in November 2009 in Dublin, Ireland. The organization focuses on rehabilitation, neutering, and re-homing services for abandoned dogs while also focusing on protecting mentally-ill dogs from being euthanized.

It is part of the \\"Four Valleys\\" ski area, which consists of various ski resorts, including Verbier, Nendaz, Veysonnaz, La Tzoumaz, and Thyon. As such it has direct access to over 400 km of runs. Named after the word \\"tzoumer\\", meaning taking a break, La Tzoumaz nestles against the same mountain as Verbier, Mont Savolyres, and is at the same altitude (1500m). However, unlike Verbier, it is situated on North-facing slopes and hence enjoys a longer ski-season, lasting from early December all the way through to late-April. The resort has splendid views over the Rhone valley from the side of a small sunny valley on the north side of Verbier. Quieter than Verbier, it is a resort popular with families, having a small ski lift for children, a natural ice rink, a heated swimming pool and the longest sledge run in Western Switzerland (at 10 kilometres). The resort has a population of just over 300 and is popular with British, German and Dutch visitors as well as Swiss Nationals. Geography La Tzoumaz is located in a green valley above the Rhône, in the canton of Valais and has one main access road, which starts in the town of Riddes, 13 kilometres away (and at exit 24 of the Martigny motorway). La Tzoumaz is also at a base station of the Savolyres Cable Car, an 8-minute ride up and 11-minute ride down to Verbier. Coordinates: . Resort in winter The resort has 1 brand new 8-seat cable car, 5 chair lifts, 5 drag lifts and 1 children's ski lift. There are 12 ski runs with a total length 28 km (30% easy, 60% intermediate, 10% difficult), a snowboard piste, a natural ice rink and the Western Switzerland's longest tobbogan run (10 km long and a drop of 848m) which starts at the summit of the station (2,354m). The resort is also directly linked to the Four Valleys ski area, with 98 more ski lifts and a total of 400 km of ski runs. The [Verbier] zone of the Four Valleys is renowned for its off-piste opportunities. In particular Tortin, Mont Fort, Valon D'Arby and Creblet are popular excursions. Resort in summer The village offers 1 outdoor tennis court, fishing, paragliding, mountain biking and climbing. It is situated on the Bisse du Saxon (part of a 19th-century irrigation system that offers 100 km of gently inclined paths suitable for walking and mountain biking). Within a short drive of the resort are many family, cultural and historical attractions including Lake Geneva, the Grande Dixence dam, the medieval town of Sion, Aqua park, Thermal Baths and underground salt mines. The Verbier-La Tzoumaz Bikepark had 5 separate downhill tracks each with at least 700m of altitude drop. The \\"maison de la Forêt\\" has exhibitions of local wildlife and a popular cafe serving local produce. It’s also the beginning of the trail of the senses. The trail of the senses allows you to discover nature through sight, touch, hearing, smell and taste. Hikers can also discover the \\"bisses\\" and notably the bisse of Saxon.

He notably played for Preston North End and Dundee as well as playing in France for Ligue 1 side Toulouse. He also appeared for Tranmere Rovers, Grimsby Town, St Mirren, Ross County, Ayr United, Elgin City and Clydebank. Career Anderson became the youngest ever scorer in the Scottish Premier Division, when he scored with a penalty at the age of 16 for Dundee against Hibernian. In 1999 he had a trial at Chelsea. His trickery, pace and powerful right foot earned him a move to the French side Toulouse, where he continued his career. In 2000 Anderson was taken on loan by then division 2 side, Preston North End. Anderson scored two goals for the club in his loan period and set many more up for another loan player, Brett Angell. Together, they are widely credited with cementing Preston North End's promotion to division 1 (now known as the Championship.) His successful loan spell earned him a then club record £500,000 permanent move to Preston North End in July 2000, and he scored a number of high quality goals for the club, most notably against Wolverhampton Wanderers and Manchester City. Anderson was famed for cutting inside whilst playing on the left-wing and unleashing powerful efforts at goal. He was also useful from set pieces and surprisingly good in the air for a winger. His time at Preston was marred firstly by injuries and then by a change in manager, which saw Craig Brown replace David Moyes at the helm. Brown did not approve of Anderson's predominantly attacking play, and criticized him for his lack of defensive awareness. It is commonly thought that Anderson became unmotivated under Craig Brown and lost his focus. He was involved from the start in Preston North End's infamous victory in the Championship play-offs against Birmingham City (which Preston won following a penalty shootout, a game during which Birmingham City Manager, Trevor Francis, tried to take his players off the pitch in protest at the end the penalties were being taken from). Anderson also set up Richard Cresswell for Preston North End's goal against Chelsea in the FA Cup, whipping in a cross from a free kick, which Cresswell headed past Carlo Cudicini. Subsequently, he was loaned out to Tranmere Rovers (where he scored on his debut and became very popular with the Tranmere fans), then Grimsby Town. He eventually moved from Preston North End permanently and rejoined his former club, Dundee. He then moved to St Mirren, however in March 2007 his contract with the club was terminated by mutual consent, due to numerous injuries. He has since played for Ross County (where he scored once against Queen's Park), Ayr United (where he scored once, again against Queen's Park), Elgin City and Clydebank. Retirement Anderson retired from football aged 31 in 2009 due to personal reasons.

Description and habitat Hymenocallis coronaria requires a swift, shallow, water current and direct sunlight to flourish. The plant grows to about tall and develops from a bulb that lodges in cracks in rocky shoals. It blooms from early May to late June. Each fragrant flower blossom opens overnight and last for one day. They are visited and possibly pollinated by Paratrea plebeja, commonly known as the plebeian sphinx moth, and Battus philenor, the pipevine swallowtail butterfly. The plant was first observed in 1783 by William Bartram and described as the \\"odoriferous Pancratium fluitans which almost alone possesses the little rocky islets\\". He saw it growing in the Savannah River near Augusta, Georgia. Populations Hymenocallis coronaria is under consideration for protection under the Endangered Species Act, due to entire populations being wiped out by dam construction. There are only approximately 50 extant populations of Hymenocallis coronaria left, all in the states of Alabama, Georgia, and South Carolina. The three largest remaining populations are located in the Cahaba River in Alabama, the Catawba River in South Carolina, and in the Flint River in Georgia.

Baxter, used to estimate the amount of replacement fluid required for the first 24 hours in a burn patient so as to ensure the patient is hemodynamically stable. The milliliter amount of fluid required for the first 24 hours – usually Lactated Ringer's – is four times the product of the body weight and the burn percentage (i.e. body surface area affected by burns). The first half of the fluid is given within 8 hours from the burn incident, and the remaining over the next 16 hours. Only area covered by second-degree burns or greater is taken into consideration, as first-degree burns do not cause hemodynamically significant fluid shift to warrant fluid replacement. The Parkland formula is mathematically expressed as: :V = 4 \\\\cdot m \\\\cdot (A \\\\cdot 100) where mass (m) is in kilograms (kg), area (A) as a percentage of total body surface area, and volume (V) is in milliliters (mL). For example, a person weighing 75 kg with burns to 20% of his or her body surface area would require 4 x 75 x 20 = 6,000 mL of fluid replacement within 24 hours. The first half of this amount is delivered within 8 hours from the burn incident, and the remaining fluid is delivered in the next 16 hours. The burn percentage in adults can be estimated by applying the Wallace rule of nines (see total body surface area): 9% for each arm, 18% for each leg, 18% for the front of the torso, 18% for the back of the torso, and 9% for the head and 1% for the perineum.

Established in 1991, it has an area of , and it is mainly spread out across the province of Teramo, L'Aquila, Pescara, with small areas in the province of Rieti and Ascoli Piceno. The terrain is predominantly mountainous with alpine plains. It is managed by Ente Parco Nazionale Gran Sasso e Monti della Laga, with headquarters in Assergi, L'Aquila. The Grand Highway of the Gran Sasso and Monti della Laga National Park runs through the park between the Gran Sasso mountain peak and the chain known as Monti della Laga. Geography The park is one of the largest protected areas in Europe, and is centered around the massif of the Gran Sasso, which dominates the surrounding landscape; it rises vertically on the immense pastures of the Campo Imperatore. The land is very rocky and receives a large amount of snow and wind. The Calderone lies just beneath the tallest peak, the Corno Grande, and it is considered to be Europe's southernmost glacier. On the north side there is the profile of Monti della Laga chain, where thousands of migratory birds stop on the shores of Lake Campotosto. This area is completely covered by woods of beeches, firs, turkey oaks and chestnuts. There are over of dedicated horse trails that can be used to visit the park.

Abruzzo wild boars of the Gran Sasso National Park  Nature and wildlife  The park contains one of the most biologically diverse areas of Europe. The climate is between that of the Mediterranean and that of the rest of continental Europe. The park contains more than two thousand plant species, some of which are found exclusively in this area, such as the Abruzzo Edelweiss. Many species of wildlife inhabit the park, including rare animals such as the Abruzzo chamois, as well as wolves, Marsican brown bear, roe deer, wildcats, wild boars, foxes and squirrels. Notable birds include the golden eagle, the white-backed woodpecker, the goshawk, the common buzzard and the peregrine falcon. There are also a wide variety of insects, such as the apollo butterfly. Attractions The park contains a very long circuit of approximately featuring trails that can be visited on horseback, by mountain bike, or on foot. Many outdoor activities are possible within the park including hiking, Horse riding, mountain biking, Canoeing, Bird watching, Alpine skiing, ski mountaineering, and Cross-country skiing Educational projects are active in the park visitor centres, and trails and paths can be freely explored alone or with the assistance of mountain guides. Settlements Many old villages are located within the confines the national park. They tend to be quite small, with stone and brick houses and narrow streets. In many cases, the place names highlight the defensive nature of the settlement and a summit position, such as Castel (castle), Rocca, Pizzo (peak), and Colle (hill). *Province of L'Aquila Assergi, Barete, Barisciano, Cagnano Amiterno, Calascio, Campotosto, Capestrano, Capitignano, Carapelle Calvisio, Castel del Monte, Castelvecchio Calvisio, L'Aquila, Montereale, Ofena, Pizzoli, Santo Stefano di Sessanio, Villa Santa Lucia degli Abruzzi *Province of Ascoli Piceno Acquasanta Terme, Arquata del Tronto *Province of Pescara Brittoli, Bussi sul Tirino, Carpineto della Nora, Castiglione a Casauria, Civitella Casanova, Corvara, Farindola, Montebello di Bertona, Pescosansonesco, Villa Celiera *Province of Rieti Accumoli, Amatrice *Province of Teramo Arsita, Campli, Castelli, Civitella del Tronto, Cortino, Crognaleto, Fano Adriano, Isola del Gran Sasso d'Italia, Montorio al Vomano, Pietracamela, Rocca Santa Maria, Torricella Sicura, Tossicia, Valle Castellana.

History The first mention of the Krasnogruda manor and estate (the original name was Krasnyhrud) dates back to 1676. The early history of the estate is not exactly known, more is known since 1785, when the Krasnogruda estate (consisting of the Krasnogruda farm and the villages of Żegary, Gawieniańce and Bierżyn) was purchased by the Eysymonts. Their first owner in the family was Maciej Tadeusz Eysymont, incl. founder of the church in Żegary. At the end of the 19th century, the estate had 4 houses and 38 residents. The Krasnogruda estate consisted of the farms Krasnogruda and Wereszczeńszczyzna. It covered 1,815 morgens.Słownik geograficzny Królestwa Polskiego i innych krajów słowiańskich, Tom IV - wynik wyszukiwania - DIR In 1929, the estate covered 414 acres. The owner was Bronisław Kunat (according to other sources it was named Kunatte). The history of the manor and land ownership in the period from the end of the 18th century to the Second World War is closely related to the landed gentry families of Eysymont and Kunatów. The first owner of Krasnogruda from the Kunat family, from which Czesław Miłosz's mother Weronika came, was Teofil, followed by his son Bronisław Kunat. In the interwar period, the last heirs of Krasnogruda, sisters Gabriel Lipska née Kunat (1888–1962) and Janina Niementowska née Kunat (1898–1977) ran a holiday guesthouse at the manor. During the Second World War the property was taken over by the German authorities. After the war, as a result of the decree of the Polish Committee of National Liberation of September 6, 1944 on the land reform, the manor and land (then with an area of 344.5 ha) ceased to be private property, and the owners were forced to leave it. The non-parceled part, ie 154.5 ha, was taken over by the state. After the war, the user of Krasnogruda was first Aleksander Czyrowski, and then the District Board of State Forests, the Pomorze Forest District. The families of forest inspectorates lived in the manor. By the will of Czesław and Andrzej Miłosz and Janina and Andrzej Jurewicz - the last heirs of Krasnogruda, the Krasnogruda manor and the park were in 2002 taken over by the \\"Pogranicze\\" Foundation, which after revitalization is the seat of the International Center for Dialogue.Zbigniew Fałtynowicz: Historia Dworu (pol.).

In 1907 he played for New South Wales in the very first rugby match run by the newly created 'New South Wales Rugby Football League' which had just split away from the established New South Wales Rugby Football Union. Rugby union career Graves grew up in inner city Balmain in Sydney. He played rugby union at Fort Street School and later represented for his senior school Hawkesbury Agricultural College. From there he was graded to play rugby union with the West Sydney Juniors - an inner city club. He played with the Grosvenor Club (another inner Sydney club) until 1902. He then joined the Gipps Club in the Balmain area with whom he won the Sydney rugby union premiership in 1904. He joined the Balmain club in the metropolitan rugby competition in 1905 and from there was selected to represent Metropolis (Sydney) in a fixture against Country played over Easter in 1905.

He played in all three matches and along with the other Australian rebel players was promptly blacklisted by the New South Wales Rugby Union for breaching its fundamental principle of amateurism. Graves was at the foundation meetings of the break-away code in 1908 and was named as foundation captain of the Balmain Tigers. He led the Tigers in their first ever game on 20 April 1908 against Easts. Graves was selected in all three games against New Zealand for Australia's inaugural Test series of 1908. He was a member of the first Kangaroo side which toured Britain in 1908–09. He appeared in 23 games on tour including the deciding 3rd Test at Birmingham in February 1909. In 1909 he played in the 1st and 3rd Tests against New Zealand in Sydney. He captained his country in the 3rd Test victory becoming at that point Australia's sixth Test captain.

Despite having had to resign due to bankruptcy, he exploited a legal loophole and was re-elected to the 13th New Zealand Parliament. Background and election Joseph Ward first won election to the electorate in the 1897 election. He held many portfolios in the Seddon Ministry, including that of Treasurer (i.e. Minister of Finance), when Justice Williams declared him \\"hopelessly insolvent\\" in 1896. He was forced to resign his portfolios in Cabinet on 16 June. In 1897, he had to file for bankruptcy, and was adjudicated bankrupt on 8 July 1897. He was then legally obliged to resign his seat in Parliament, which he did on 14 July. A loophole, however, meant that there was nothing to stop him simply contesting it again. He did so, and was re-elected with an increased majority. His opponent, both in the previous general election in and in the by-election was Cuthbert Cowan, who had previously represented the () and (–1890) electorates. Parliament passed a special Act on 13 October, the Awarua Seat Enquiry Act 1897, which required the Court of Appeal to urgently decide whether he could be re-elected to Parliament, and the court decided in his favour. The court judgement was published as AJHR H32 of 1897. Ward actually gained considerable popularity as a result of his financial troubles; Ward was widely seen as a great benefactor of the Southland region, and public perceptions were that he was being persecuted by his enemies over an honest mistake. Gradually, Ward rebuilt his businesses, and paid off his debtors.

Heritage Gateway: architectural description of listed building The Manor of Fowberry was owned by the Fowberry family for over 400 years, and their 16th-century tower house incorporated the remains of an original pele tower. In the late 16th century Roger Fowberry mortgaged the estate to his neighbour William Strother of Kirknewton, and despite later legal attempts to dispute the debt, his son was obliged in 1591 to transfer the property to Lancelot Strother. The Strothers built a new manor house on the site in about 1666. When William Strother died in 1708 without a male heir the estate passed to William Kerr who married Blake’s heiress daughter. In 1776 their son John Strother Kerr sold the estate and house to Sir Francis Blake. Blake remodelled and substantially enlarged the house including delightful Strawberry Hill Gothic interiors; some of the more important interiors following this style in the North of England. He included the Blake family crest – a martlet surmounting a cap of maintenance – on a frieze in 22-carat gold leaf in the dining room. A new frontage was designed by the architect James Nesbit of Kelso. A feature of the new mansion was the creation of six false windows on the south elevation, which substantially improved the external appearance of the new building but avoided the burden of window tax. The Blakes sold the estate in 1807 to Matthew Culley (born 1778), son of the noted expert agriculturalist George Culley (born 1735).Matthew and George Culley.

The school opened in August 2008 to replace the three previously separate public high schools in the Harlan County district: Evarts High School, James A. Cawood, and Cumberland High School. (A fourth public high school in the county, Harlan High School, is operated by a separate district and did not participate in the consolidation.) The school has been met with mixed criticism, with praises for its unique architecture, design and educational value. History Main construction for Harlan County High School began in 2006 and finished in 2008. Opening orientation was held on August 24, 2008, and school was scheduled to open for students the next day. However, an arson attempt activated several sprinklers throughout the school, forcing the postponement of opening day until September. More than 1,701 students began attending the school on opening day. The teams were provisionally to be called the Knights, however, public opinion led to the decision to name them the Black Bears in honor of the Ursus americanus bears that inhabit the area. The school is the flagship of the Harlan County Public Schools, whose superintendent is Brent Roark. Architecture and design Although Harlan County High School is located in a rural community, the school was built with a generous budget and has been praised for its unique architectural design. Paired with a few defining characteristics - such as the multiple bear statues and giant bear paw painted on its grassy embankment - more remarkable qualities distinguish the school. The school's main entrance leads students through a lobby featuring images and artifacts of historic schools and into a three-story atrium, designed as a street that connects all the main functions of the school, from which one can almost view every area in the building as well. Other important areas include the main office, gymnasium, auditorium, lunchroom, library, security office, and classrooms. Sports, clubs, and organizations Tom Larkey served as the first head coach for the black bears, winning two regional titles and multiple district crowns as well. Larkey and the school parted ways after a 2-9 season, Eddie Creech took over for Larkey as the leader for the Bears on the sideline. The bears went 4-7 in Creech's first two-season, qualifying for the playoffs both years but facing first-round exits both years in close games. In 2017, the third season under Creech, the bears had their first winning season in three years as well as taking the schools third regional championship. The 2018 season found some success, giving the black bears a district title and one playoff win.

The disk is described as logical or virtual because it does not actually exist as a single physical entity in its own right. The goal of the logical disk is to provide computer software with what seems a contiguous storage area, sparing them the burden of dealing with the intricacies of storing files on multiple physical units. Most modern operating systems provide some form of logical volume management.  Levels  Logical disks can be defined at various levels in the storage infrastructure. = Operating system = An operating system may define volumes or logical disks and assign each to one physical disk, more than one physical disk or part of the storage area of a physical disk. For example, Windows NT can create several partitions on a hard disk drive, each of which a separate volume with its own file system. Each floppy disk drive, optical disc drive or USB flash drive in Windows NT becomes one volume. Windows NT can also create partitions that span multiple hard disks drives. Each volume is identified with a drive letter. = Storage area network = Storage area networks (SANs) consolidate inhomogeneous storage devices. As such logical disks or vdisks allow computer programs to access files stored on a SAN. = Storage subsystem = A hardware-level redundant array of independent disks (RAID) exposes itself to the operating system as one logical disk while the array itself consists of several disks. The operating system either does not know that the hardware with which it is interfacing is a RAID, or knows but still does not concern itself with intricate details of storage. In case of the latter, specialized management, maintenance and diagnostics software dedicated to that specific RAID may run on the operating system. Motivation When IBM first released the magnetic disk drive in the 1956 IBM 305, a single disk drive would be directly attached to each system, managed as a single entity. As the development of drives continued, it became apparent that reliability was a problem and systems using RAID technology evolved, so that more than one physical disk is used to produce a single logical disk. Many modern business information technology environments use a SAN. Here, many storage devices are connected to many host server devices in a network. A single RAID array may provide some capacity to one server, and some capacity to another. Therefore, logical disks are used to partition the available capacity and provide the amount of storage needed by each host from a common pool of logical disks. The IBM SAN Volume Controller uses the term \\"vdisk\\" to refer to these logical disks. Today, the rationale for the logical disk approach starts to be questioned and solutions that offer more flexibility and better abstraction are increasingly needed.

It sits at an altitude of 1300 meters above sea level in the Province of L'Aquila in Italy's Abruzzo Region. It is located on the Italian State Highway 80 which passes near the Gran Sasso in the Apennines. This famous pass probably takes its name from the small pastoral huts (\\"capannelle\\") which dot the landscape. They were used in times past by the local shepherds during the transumanza for protection from the elements, especially the rain and snow showers which can unexpectedly arise in the area. The Capannelle Pass is an important transportation point linking the Province of Teramo with the Province of L'Aquila. The area is well known for hosting the Grand Highway of the Gran Sasso and Monti della Laga National Park, a touristic byway running through the heart of the national park between Montorio al Vomano ad Amiternum.  Brigands  Although covered with snow in the winter and barely accessible at other times of the year, the Capanelle Pass in days past served as the only practical way to travel from one side of the Gran Sasso to the other. The pass became a favorite place for local brigands to attack hapless groups of travelers. Notorious for his bloody deeds was the infamous Giuseppe Palombieri. Palombieri was finally captured by Chiaffredo Bergia, a carabiniere (member of the Italian national police force) who had gained bragging rights for having put another brigand, Andrea Andreani, behind bars. During the struggle to subdue Palombieri which took place near the Italian village of Campotosto shots were fired and Bergia was wounded. Bergia's persistence was rewarded, however, and he was eventually able to prevail over his erstwhile rival. Palombieri was found to be carrying a document which he had written imploring his co-conspirators to carry out a vendetta aimed at the residents and mayor of nearby Fano Adriano. In recognition of his bravery, Bergia was awarded a silver medal and promoted to the rank of brigadier.  Visit by bicycle  The Capannelle Pass features gentle slopes in the direction of Teramo to the west and more difficult climbs in the direction of L'Aquila to the west. The Giro d'Italia has been staged in this area on several occasions. Nearby destinations include Lake Campotosto and Campo Imperatore.

The brand Viscount was registered in 1969 by Marcello Galanti, but the company was established in the late 19th century by his forefather Antonio Galanti. After 1969 Viscount’s primary focus has been on classic organs and digital pianos. Several alternative brands were formed in the 2000s to aim at expanding into other markets: VERSE and Voice Systems, respectively, for the high and low-end Pro-Audio markets and Physis for digital organs using Viscount’s physical modeling technology. The company also used the Oberheim brand for several years, to market vintage organs, synthesizers and guitar effects. Currently, Viscount’s manufacturing and R&D; activity is based in Italy. The company has been continuously owned by the Galanti family since its inception. History =Twentieth century= The company history begins in the late 19th century when Antonio Galanti, musician and craftsman, founded a small accordion production facility in Mondaino, Italy. This became a family business and in subsequent years was enlarged: in 1917 the first Galanti factory was established in Mondaino and afterwards the activity was inherited by his son Egidio. Along with the accordions, many guitars were produced under the Galanti Electro Music brand. Between 1910 and 1920 Domenico, Egidio and Robusto moved to the USA to import accordions to the Americas. During these years some patents were issued in the USA. After 1955 the Galanti brothers returned to Italy to establish their business back in their homeland. With the times changing, the production shifted to new instruments and in 1959 one of Egidio's sons, Marcello, began the production of electronic instruments, starting, in 1969 his own business called Intercontinental Electronics SpA and the Viscount brand name, mainly devoted to electronic organs. As is the case with most of the musical instrument manufacturers of the central Adriatic coast, such as Eko, Farfisa, FBT, the production included a wide variety of instruments through the years - such as electric guitars, home organs, accordions, synthesizers and loudspeakers. =Today= In 1999, Marcello Galanti died, leaving his business to his son Mauro and daughter Loriana, who renewed the product catalogue and expanded their R&D; personnel including a new R&D; Lab based in Ancona, Italy. During these years Viscount used the Oberheim brand to market new products: the MC master keyboard series, the OB-12 digital synthesizer and the OB-3 vintage organ line (now called DB organs and marketed directly under the Viscount brand) and the GM-1000 guitar processor. New digital pianos were also introduced using the brand Galileo. At the same time, the business over the past two decades has been focused primarily on classic organs. In 2007 Viscount launched a new series of digital amplified loudspeakers, under the VERSE brand, developed by a new R&D; team, with the D:SIDER line being the higher-end products and embedding together a class D digital amplifier, a DSP and a remote control system. In 2008 Viscount gave birth to a new brand, Physis, for the production of a new generation of classic organs, based on a new sound synthesis technology, physical modeling, patented in Italy and other countries. This synthesis technology, although common for the emulation of other musical instruments (such as guitars and brass instruments) is at the time of writing the only known implementation for the emulation of organ pipes. Products File:Galanti_Grand_Prix.jpg Galanti Grand Prix guitar File:Viscount Intercontinental.jpg Viscount Intercontinental (combo organ) File:OB12 synth.jpg Oberheim OB12 (synthesizer) =Discontinued products= Most notable instruments among the first half of the 20th century are: *Dominator accordion series *Super Classic accordions *Galanti Electro Music guitars (such as the Grand-Prix series) More recently, notable discontinued products are: *the Oberheim OB12 Virtual Analog synthesizer *the MC series of master keyboards *the OB-3, D9, OB32 vintage organ series (now superseded by the DB series) *the first Prestige series of classic organs (now superseded by a new Prestige series) *the Eclipse Digital amplified loudspeakers, an early attempt to the digital amplified loudspeaker concept =Recent products= The company started producing electric organs (home-organs, neon tonewheel organs, church organs, etc.) since the late 1960s. Many of these organs were marketed in the USA and UK with different brands, such as Baldwin, Vox and Fujiha. In the 2000s the company launched new products and brands and developed new technologies, some of which are covered by patents. Some of these products are: *the Unico line of physical modeling organs, using Physis technology *VERSE digital loudspeakers *Alpha digital mixers, an attempt to bring digital mixers to the low-end market File:Verse_D_SUB.png VERSE D:SUB speaker File:Voice_Systems_Bee-T-Five.png Voice Systems Bee T-Five speaker File:Screenshot_DSPEditor.png A screenshot from the D:SP Editor for VERSE speakers Physis Physis refers to the physical modeling technology developed by Viscount. Two series of organs have been produced with Physis technology at the time of this writing: Unico and Unico CL. The latter being a stripped-down version of the former. Unico organs are based only on physical modeling synthesis, hence they no longer use sampling technology, currently the most common synthesis technology for musical instruments. Unico organs also feature a Linux-powered core controller, hence it is capable of managing USB devices such as USB sticks, and several DSPs for the sound synthesis. With these new products, Viscount seems to have gained back some popularity in the USA, after a demo tour featuring Cameron Carpenter as a player. VERSE VERSE is a trademark used by Viscount to market a series of loudspeakers meant for sound reinforcement in big halls, theaters, live stages and so on. All VERSE speakers are equipped with an onboard digital amplifier and a DSP. They also feature a remote connection system based on RS-485 meant to create a daisy-chain network to control and set up the speakers. A PC editor software, called D:SP, is needed in order to control the speakers and adjust their parameters. Current VERSE products are: *D:SIDER and D:SUB speakers, equipped with a DSP unit and a digital amplifier. *INSIDER MkII and SUB speakers, equipped with a digital amplifier. Voice Systems Voice Systems was the first of the aforementioned brands to be created, in 2000, and sells products for the low-end market, specifically: small live gigs, light sound reinforcement systems for speeches or small venues. Under this brand many unique products were or are sold: tiny mixers, such as Micropad, quarter-rack reverb units, 8-channel digital mixers, compact all-in-one systems (e.g. Factotum).

Taking place largely at Ikuta Shrine, near the scene of the battle, it centers on Atsumori's fictional son, who seeks to meet his father's ghost. Plot summary A monk opens the play, introducing himself as a disciple of famous priest Hōnen Shōnin, and explaining how Hōnen once found a baby boy in a box at the Kamo Shrine in Kyoto. The monk says that Honen raised the boy, and, that many years later, a young woman came forth revealing herself to be the boy's mother, and explaining that his father was Taira no Atsumori. As the boy now longed to see his father's face, Hōnen suggested that he should go to Kamo and pray there for a week. The monk concludes his introduction by explaining that this is the last day of that week, and that he has come with the boy to Kamo once again, to pray. The boy then tells the monk that he had a dream while praying, in which a voice told him to go to Ikuta Shrine in order to see his father. Traveling to Ikuta, the pair come upon a small hut, where they decide to ask to spend the night. The man in the hut explains that he is the ghost of Atsumori. Through the intervention of the Kamo kami, Atsumori explains, he has been granted by Yama, the lord of death, a brief opportunity to appear here in the mortal world, to meet his son. He regales his son with the tale of the battle of Ichi-no-tani, in which he was killed. A messenger of Yama then appears, and takes Atsumori with him, back to the realm of the shura, the hell of constant battle. Taira no Atsumori Atsumori is a complex character. He is a great warrior from the Taira family but he also shows a sensitive side with his son. His philosophy on life also seems to contrast during the story. Before the meeting of father and son, Atsumori recites the five attributes of \\"beauty, perception, knowledge, motion, consciousness\\". He talks about how the body is weak and it is the soul that guards it from corruption. Yet, when he meets his son, he suddenly becomes concerned about the ratty garments he wears. The idea being that someone who comes from the Taira line should have a better presentation. When talking to his son, he has great pride in telling the story of the Taira family at its peak. As soon as he speaks of the downfall of the great Taira family, he is called back to Hell and just like the Taira family, he fades away. Subtext of play The play expresses the pain in loss of war. When the late father Atsumori, describes his son, he talks about him with such joy. He uses simile to compare his son to a flower. He compares his son to an earthly object in order to allow audiences to feel privileged that they lived in a generation in which they could feel grateful that they weren't in war. The play also goes on to detail Atsumori's descent, after being briefly reconnected with his son, back into the realm of Shuma, a realm of constant battle. This further warns against the consequence and sadness of war. Filial Piety Filial piety is a main theme in this story. Even though Atsumori and his son had never met, they were brought together by a deep spiritual connection. The boy’s prayers and longing for his father was so powerful that the gods allowed Atsumori to briefly leave Hell and meet his son. The following excerpt really describes the instant connection between father and son during their meeting: And lightly he ran, Plucked at the warrior’s sleeve, And though his tears might seem like the long woe Of nightingales that weep, Yet were they tears of meeting-joy, Or happiness too great for human heart.

He was a co-founder and bass-player for Skin Yard, a band that was active from 1985 to 1992, and was president and owner of C/Z Records, a Seattle-based independent record label that released music by many bands including 7 Year Bitch, Built to Spill, Coffin Break, Engine Kid, The Gits, Hammerbox, Love Battery, The Melvins, The Presidents of the United States of America, Silkworm, and Skin Yard. In 2003 he moved from Seattle to Los Angeles where he oversaw the development and creation of the now-defunct www.DownloadPunk.com as well as the music-centric (now offline) online dating website, RocknRollDating.com.  Musical career  House’s first band was the little-known Seattle band Death of Marat, named after a painting by Jacques-Louis David depicting the assassination of radical journalist Jean-Paul Marat during the French Revolution. The band lasted for a little over a year, starting in 1982 and breaking up in late 1983. In 1984 House formed an instrumental prog-rock three-piece band called feeDBack with Matt Cameron on drums and a guitarist named \\"Nerm\\" (real name Tom Herring). feeDBack lasted only 10 months but managed to record 9 songs on a 4-track recorder that Cameron owned. The songs have subsequently been remixed and mastered by Jack Endino, but have never been released. Shortly after forming feeDBack, House was recruited to play bass in 10 Minute Warning (TWM), replacing the recently departed David Garrigues. TWM was unique at the time in that they originated as a punk band, but had evolved into something slower, heavier and with psychedelic overtones. TMW are popularly regarded as one of the first progenitors of the grunge movement. 10 Minute Warning broke up at the end of 1984 after guitarist Paul Solger quit, and drummer Greg Gilmore left Seattle to join former 10 Minute Warning guitarist Duff McKagan in Los Angeles. = Skin Yard = In 1985 House envisioned a new band, one that would draw from elements of both feeDBack and Ten Minute Warning. He sought out Jack Endino whom he met through Nerm based on a tape that Endino had shared at a feeDBack rehearsal, and proposed his idea for his next band. They recruited Matt Cameron and began writing songs while looking for a singer. Eventually finding Ben McMillan to take on vocal duties, they named the new band Skin Yard. On June 7, 1985 Skin Yard played their first show opening for the U-Men. Skin Yard’s music was first released on the Deep Six compilation album which also featured tracks by Soundgarden, The Melvins, U-Men, Green River and Malfunkshun. Between 1987 and 1991, Skin Yard released 4 full-length records and embarked on several national and regional tours up and down the west coast. House quit Skin Yard in 1991 and has not actively played in a band since. = Later career = In 1988 House co-wrote and recorded The Last Laugh, Helios Creed’s first for Amphetamine Reptile Records with Jason Finn on drums. In 1989, House was the drummer for Seattle band, Yeast, who released one 7\\" single (\\"Crisco Wristwatch\\") and a track on Teriyaki Asthma Vol. I which also included tracks from Nirvana, Helios Creed and Coffin Break. The other members of Yeast were Milton Garrison from Vexed and Al Thompkins from Daddy Hate Box. Yeast highlights included sharing the bill once with Soundgarden and once with Tad. In 1993 House played one show with the band Pretty Mary Sunshine (opening for Red House Painters) while bass player Joe Skyward was in Europe playing with The Posies. Pretty Mary Sunshine asked House to become their permanent bass-player, but he declined. That was the last time House performed on stage.  As record label owner  Daniel House purchased the rights and ownership of fledgling Seattle-based label C/Z Records from Chris Hanzsek in 1986. Initially House intended the label as a vehicle to release music by Skin Yard, his band at the time. Skin Yard’s only previously released material was on C/Z’s Deep Six compilation, and House wanted to maintain the ongoing sales efforts for the remaining LPs still in stock. House continued to release records by other bands in the Seattle area, while working at a series of jobs, eventually working as Director of Sales and Distribution for Sub Pop Records in 1988. House left Sub Pop in 1991 in an effort to make C/Z a viable business. Over the next several years C/Z grew into an independent label with national recognition releasing material from 7 Year Bitch, Treepeople, Coffin Break, Engine Kid, Hammerbox, Built to Spill, The Gits, Love Battery, Silkworm and Monks of Doom. At its peak, C/Z employed 13 people and was a full-service label with distribution in North America, Europe and Australia. In 1993, C/Z entered into a production and distribution deal with Sony-owned RED Distribution. By 1994, that deal had drained C/Z of all its financial resources and effectively shut C/Z down, leaving House deep in debt. In 1996 the BMG-owned Zoo Entertainment partnered with C/Z for a third-party venture deal which helped to resolve the debt incurred during the RED Distribution deal. Zoo provided a modest operating and recording budget and assisted in the development of new artists. That same year, House appeared in the 1996 grunge documentary Hype!, the footage of which had been shot in 1992-1993. In 1997 Zoo was purchased and all third party ventures were dropped. C/Z would then be turned back to a part-time venture with House looking towards new opportunities that would still keep him involved in music. The shift would move him towards Internet-based music and entertainment ventures. In 1998, House began working in the music department at streaming media pioneer RealNetworks as an editor for their online content portal, the RealGuide.  Personal life  In 2003, House moved to Los Angeles.

Biography Cobham was the eldest son of Charles Lyttelton, 8th Viscount Cobham, and the Hon. Mary Susan Caroline Cavendish, daughter of William Cavendish, 2nd Baron Chesham. Alfred Lyttelton was his uncle. He was educated at Eton. Like his father and his uncle, Cobham was a successful cricketer. He represented Worcestershire County Cricket Club in three first-class matches during 1924–5. He was President of Marylebone Cricket Club in 1935, again emulating his father and uncle. Lyttelton was commissioned a second lieutenant in the Rifle Brigade on 4 December 1901, and served with the regiment in the Second Boer War in South Africa. He returned home with the SS Kinfauns Castle after the war had ended, leaving Cape Town in early August 1902. After a couple of months on leave, during which there were formal celebrations as he attained his majority, he re-joined the regiment in South Africa in late 1902. From 1905 to 1908 he was again back in South Africa as aide-de-camp to the High Commissioner. Lyttelton was elected to the House of Commons for Droitwich in the January 1910 general election, a seat he held until his resignation 1916 (being appointed Steward and Bailiff of the Manor of Northstead). During the First World War he fought at Gallipoli and in Egypt, the Sinai and Palestine, achieving the rank of lieutenant colonel. He succeeded his father as ninth Viscount Cobham in 1922 and entered the House of Lords. In 1939 he was appointed Under-Secretary of State for War in the government of Neville Chamberlain, a position he retained until May 1940.

(Pundole Art Gallery, Mumbai, 2008), n.p. As observed by Jeffrey Wechsler in his essay on Mohan Samant and his place in twentieth-century modernism, \\"Samant's practice was the antithesis of a signature style. Throughout his career, he delved into divergent materials and techniques and constantly shifted imagery. While some of his processes and forms can be perceived on a regular basis over long periods of time, there was no hewing to a given image, endlessly repeated.\\" He stated that \\"I find that stagnation in style and the search for the same forms cause an artist to suffer an immense amount of laboriousness in his work. Samant's art is, instead, determinedly far-reaching and inquisitive, and is inspired by the whole history of human visual creativity. Samant stated straightforwardly that his sources derived from five thousand years of art from varied civilizations. These included the cave paintings of Lascaux, Egyptian wall paintings and hieroglyphs, Indian miniatures and murals, Precolumbian ceramics, African sculpture, and the modernism of Pablo Picasso, Henri Matisse, and Paul Klee.\\"\\"Mohan Samant: Individualism and Context,\\" in Mohan Samant: Paintings, pp. 348-49. Personal life In 1971, Samant married Jillian Saunders (born Australia), a performer on the viola da gamba and recorder. At his spacious loft, he hosted performances by visiting Indian musicians. He also performed for friends and accompanied singers. A dedicated musician as well as artist, he practiced sarangi for three hours every morning. Afternoons were dedicated to painting. Samant and Jillian spent many Sundays at MoMA and the Metropolitan Museum of Art, where Samant would visit current exhibitions. At the Met, he would usually end up in the African or Egyptian galleries, which he found major sources of inspiration.Recollections of Jillian Samant Exhibitions and archives From his first showing until 1953, Samant took part in exhibitions around the world, held in galleries and museums in Canada, the United States, England, India and Japan.

For example, because interest on debt is a tax-deductible expense, taking on debt creates a tax shield. Since a tax shield is a way to save cash flows, it increases the value of the business, and it is an important aspect of business valuation. Example =Case A= *Consider one unit of investment that costs $1,000 and returns $1,100 at the end of year 1, i.e. a 10% return on investment before taxes. *Now assume tax rate of 20%. *If an investor pays $1,000 of capital, at the end of the year, he will have ($1,000 return of capital, $100 income and –$20 tax) $1,080. He earned net income of $80, or 8% return on capital. The concept was originally added to the methodology proposed by Franco Modigliani and Merton Miller for the calculation of the weighted average cost of capital of a corporation. =Case B= *Consider the investor now has an option to borrow $4,000 at 8% interest rate. *If the investor still pays $1,000 of his initial equity capital, in addition to borrowing $4,000 at the terms above, the investor can purchase 5 units of investment for $5000 total. *At the end of the year, he will have: ($5,000 return of capital, $500 revenue (due to the 10% return on each unit of investment), –$4,000 repayment of debt, –$320 interest payment, and $(500-320)*20%= $36 tax). Therefore, he is left with $1,144. He earned net income of $144, or 14.4% return on his $1000 initial equity capital. The reason that he was able to earn additional income is because the cost of debt (i.e. 8% interest rate) is less than the return earned on the investment (i.e. 10%).

Early life Seranella was born in Santa Monica, California and then grew up in Pacific Palisades. She left what could have been an idyllic childhood to run away at 13 to seek adventure. She hitchhiked to San Francisco and joined a hippie commune. While there she learned auto mechanics on the street (she liked to hang out with guys who had cars). Seranella married Walter Haring in spring of 1982. He was the father of Michera Nicole Colella (DOB March 4, 1982). Seranella raised Michera as her own, often picking up the slack where Michera's biological mother's addiction paired with Walt's psychological instability left Seranella to pick up the pieces. Not wanting to create a wedge between two sisters being raised by a single mother with two different fathers, Seranella made the decision to take in Maryann Colella as well and raise her as her own too, just to avoid the confusion of separating the two girls. In the worst of the girls' mother's addiction, Seranella would come to bring clean pillow cases and basic food supplies even years after her divorce with Michera's biological father.

Early life and education Fitzgeoffrey was born in Cornwall, the son of a Protestant clergyman named Alexander Fitzgeoffrey (a surname sometimes spelled Fitzgeffrey), who was Rector of the parish of St Fimbarrus, Fowey. His father died during Charles's childhood, perhaps while he was around eight years old, and his mother then married into the distinguished Mohun family, which gave her son financial and social security. After early schooling under the Rev. Richard Harvey, at seventeen Fitzgeoffrey went up to Oxford University, matriculating at Broadgates Hall on 3 July 1593. Fitzgeoffrey was admitted B.A. in 1597 and M.A. in 1600, but had apparently left Oxford by 1599. It is not immediately clear where he went or what he did, though verses in Affaniae make reference to a time spent in Wiltshire, where he had relatives named Bellott; and also to a severe illness which he suffered about this period. Elsewhere in his verse Fitzgeoffrey also alludes to a disability: he had the sight of only one eye. Writings Fitzgeoffrey was only twenty and still at Oxford when he produced Sir Francis Drake, His Honorable life's commendation, and his Tragical Deathes Lamentation,(1596) which was popular enough to go through a second printing. Fitzgeoffrey is mentioned by Francis Meres in his 1598 survey of contemporary English literature, Palladis Tamia, where he is admiringly described as \\"that high touring Falcon\\" for the epic quality of his verse and his patriotic choice of subject. Drake extolled the exploits of Fitzgeoffrey's fellow West Countryman, the recently deceased sailor Sir Francis Drake, and other English seafaring heroes. Of more interest to later literary historians are the kind of chatty Latin epigrams at which Fitzgeoffrey excelled, and which he eventually collected and published as Affaniae.Caroli Fitzgeofridi affaniae, sive, Epigrammatum libri tres, ejusdem cenotaphia, 1601 Affaniae is a non-classical Latin word meaning \\"trivial, trashy talk\\", and the epigrams in Fitzgeoffrey's book, generally light in tone, refer to a wide range of his neighbours in Cornwall, friends in Oxford and contemporary writers whose work he admired. It is this abundance of references to Elizabethan writers which chiefly makes his work interesting today. Significant authors he namechecks include Thomas Nashe, Ben Jonson, Michael Drayton, Edmund Spenser, Sir Philip Sidney, George Chapman, William Camden, Barnabe Barnes, John Marston, Joseph Hall and Mary Sidney. Other epigrams suggest the young Fitzgeoffrey was as interested in the work of Continental humanist authors as he was in native English writers. He also includes epitaphs on contemporaries, and his verse on the satirist Thomas Nashe illustrates why Fitzgeoffrey is so valued as a source of literary and cultural history. His poem is the first contemporary reference to the death of Nashe, which was otherwise unrecorded: it indicates Nashe's work had been officially banned from publication at the time he died: and it gives an insight into how the author was viewed by his contemporaries, saluting both his irrepressible verve and combative nature. Later life Shortly after leaving university Fitzgeoffrey must have taken holy orders, because in 1603 the father of one of his Oxford friends presented him with the living of St Dominick's at Halton, Cornwall. Financially secure and living close to the homes of good friends who shared his cultural interests, Fitzgeoffrey settled down. He must also have married, though his wife's name has not survived, as two years before his death the living was presented to his eldest son John. Later in life Fitzgeoffrey published some of his sermons and also produced a final book of English poetry on the subject of Christ's nativity, The Blessed Birth-Day.The blessed birth-day celebrated in some pious meditations on the angels anthem, 1636 A letter of his describing a violent storm which hit Fowey, damaging the church tower, also survives. Conventionally for the period Fitzgeoffrey interprets the storm providentially as a \\"warning piece from Heaven\\", but was somewhat troubled to find the only person injured in it was a maidservant who, he is at pains to point out, he has known \\"for this seven years... to be of sober, modest, religious conversation\\". Charles Fitzgeoffrey died on 24 February 1638 and was buried under the communion table of his church.

It is located in Belgrade's municipality of Zvezdara. After one of the central streets, it is also called Vojvoda Vlahović, but is also referred to as Braće Jerković II, because it makes urban connection to it. The neighborhood is sometimes also referred to as Medaković Padina (, ).  Location  Padina is located in the south-western section of the municipality, right on the border of the municipality of Voždovac, on the northern slope of the hill of Mokroluško Brdo, thus the name (Serbian padina, slope). It borders the neighborhoods of Medaković III on the north, Braće Jerković on the west while on the south-east, through the street of Cvetanova Ćuprija, it extends to the neighborhood of Veliki Mokri Lug. On the south it makes one urban section with the neighborhood of Braće Jerković II (or Mitrovo Brdo), where it descends into the Kumodraž Field, in the valley of the Kumodraški Potok stream.  Population  Padina mostly belongs to the local community (administrative sub-municipal unit) of Vojvoda Mišić, which was formed within the municipality of Zvezdara before the 1991 census. Prior to that, non-urbanized area belonged to Veliki Mokri Lug. Local community had a population of 2,127 in 1991, 5,520 in 2002 and 6,998 in 2011. This local community includes also parts of the neighborhoods of Medaković 3 and Cvetanova Ćuprija, and in 2020 it was estimated that Zvezdara's part of Padina has 2,500 inhabitants. However parts of the neighborhood spread outside of the local community, including parts of Veliki Mokri Lug, also in Zvezdara, and Mitrovo Brdo, in the municipality of Voždovac. By 2019, it was estimated that the entire neighborhood had a population of 10,000.  Characteristics  The neighborhood originates from the late 1980s. It is a residential area on the edge of the city, spreading from the central street of the same name, Padina, which has been renamed to Veselina Čajkanovića Street in 2005. Elementary school should be built in the neighborhood in 2022.

An appeal by way of case stated is made at the request of a party to the proceedings to the judge after the conclusion of a case.

Grant attributed the source of her information in this novel to her \\"Far Memory\\" extrasensory abilities, particularly the ability to remember her own past lives. Plot summary The story is narrated by Sekhet- a-Ra, familiarly known as Sekeeta. Most of the story takes place in the city of 'Me'n-atetiss', Memphis, Egypt, founded by Sekeeta's ancestor 'Meniss' (Menes). In the course of the narrative she becomes co-Pharaoh with her brother Neyah during the First Dynasty of Ancient Egypt. The narrative follows her life and training in the arts of war, statecraft, and metaphysics. All members of the royal family are routinely trained in the use of extrasensory abilities and taught a doctrine of esoteric discipline, reincarnation and karma. In the course of the story, she has an affair with a man named Dio from Minoas, and gives birth to a daughter she names Tchekeea, who becomes the fourth ruler of the First Dynasty, Den. Sekeeta rides a chariot into battle and engages in hand-to-hand combat to defend Egypt from invasion by the people of 'Zuma' (Sumer, which we are told is the land of the forerunners of the Babylonians), at the 'Amphitheatre of Grain', now the site of Tell el-Amarna. Sekeeta lives to an advanced age, dies, and is buried in Abidwa, the modern Abydos, Egypt. The name on her tomb is Meri-Nyet, her \\"priest name\\" which might be more properly rendered as Merneith.

Her naming scheme for these works generally follows the format \\"After [Artist]/[Work]\\". For example, her creation of the Mona Lisa using spools of thread is titled After The Mona Lisa 2. The spools are hung in long, adjacent columns to create a pointillist, inverted abstraction of a famous painting. When viewed by the naked eye, they are barely recognizable. When viewed through an optical device, usually a \\"viewing sphere\\" (a transparent sphere the size of a baseball) placed several feet in front of the spools), the abstractions are inverted and shrunk into a remarkably detailed and faithful image of the original painting. The resulting image is usually distorted the way objects are distorted when viewed through a fisheye lens: objects in the center are larger than they appear, and objects in the periphery are smaller than they appear. The horizon of the image viewed through the viewing sphere also bend and curve, depending on the viewer's perspective.

Great Officers of State may also refer to: *Great Officers of the Crown of France *Great Officers of the Realm in Sweden ","title":"Great Officers of State (disambiguation)"},{"id":"9689132","text":"The Great Officers of the Realm (Swedish: De högre riksämbetsmännen) were the five leading members of the Swedish Privy Council from the later parts of the 16th century to around 1680. With the constitution of 1634, the five officers became heads of five different branches of government (Swedish: kollegium). The same constitution also declared that the great officers were to act as regents during the minorities of kings or regnal queens. All great officers of the realm were abolished by king Carl XI of Sweden. The Lord High Steward and the Lord High Chancellor offices were revived in the late 18th century, but were soon removed again. The five great officers The great officers were, in order of a ranking which was established in 1634, the following: # Lord High Steward (or Lord High Justiciar) (Swedish: Riksdrots) # Lord High Constable (Swedish: Riksmarsk) # Lord High Admiral (Swedish: Riksamiral) # Lord High Chancellor (Swedish: Rikskansler) # Lord High Treasurer (Swedish: Riksskattmästare) =Lord High Steward= The title meant no particular assignment until 1614, when Lord High Steward Magnus Brahe was put in charge of the newly established Svea Court of Appeal, the highest court of Sweden at the time. The steward became responsible of supervising justice in Sweden. =Lord High Constable= The title meant no particular assignment until 1630, when Lord High Constable Jacob De la Gardie became president of the Council of War (Swedish: first Krigsrätten, later Krigsrådet and, from 1634, Krigskollegium). As such he was chief of the army. =Lord High Admiral= The Lord High Admiral was head of the Admiralty of Sweden (Swedish: Amiralitetskollegium from 1634) and the Swedish navy. =Lord High Chancellor= The Lord High Chancellor was assigned to ensure that the orders of the king and government were followed. Along the way, the assignments of the chancellor increased to the amount that a chancellery, the Privy Council Chancellery, had to be established. The chancellery became one of the governmental branches and the chancellor acted as head of it. Albeit fourth in rank among the great officers, the Lord High Chancellor became the most important figure in the Privy Council. The chancellor was head of the relations with foreign powers. =Lord High Treasurer= The Lord High Treasurer had the responsibility to supervise issues concerning the economy of the state. The office holder was head of the Chambers, which in 1634 was declared one of five departments of the government under the name Kammarkollegium. Lesser Officers of the Realm Below the great officers in rank, were a number of Lesser Officers of the Realm (Swedish: de lägre riksämbetsmännen). These were Marshal of the Realm (riksmarskalk), Equerry of the Realm (riksstallmästare), Forester of the Realm (riksjägmästaren), General Quartermaster (generalkvartermästaren) and rikstygmästaren. In the late 17th century, king Carl XI removed not only the great officers but the smaller officers as well. The Marshal of the Realm and the Equerry of the Realm offices were both revived by king Gustav III in the late 18th century. Among both the greater and smaller officers, the only title to exist in present-day Sweden, is the Marshal of the Realm.

Variations  Areas where kenkey is eaten are Ghana, eastern Côte d'Ivoire, Togo, western Benin, Guyana, and Jamaica. It is usually made from ground corn (maize), like sadza and ugali. It is popularly known as kɔmi (pronounced kormi) by the Gas or dokono by the Akans in Ghana. It is also known in Jamaica as dokunoo, dokono, dokunu, blue drawers, and tie-a-leaf. In Mexico, there is a version called \\"Tamale\\". Kenkey can also be found in an area of Northern Ghana called \\"Tamale\\". In Guyana, it is called konkee. In Trinidad it is called \\"paime\\" (pronounced pay-me) and differs in that it does not contain plantain but may include pumpkin and coconut. In the cuisine of the Caribbean, it is made with cornmeal, plantain, green banana, sweet potato (Asante and Jamaican version, which came from the Asante version) or cassava, wrapped in banana leaves. The food is derived from African cooking traditions. Fante kenkey Unlike ugali, making kenkey involves letting the maize ferment before cooking. Therefore, preparation takes a few days in order to let the dough ferment. Corn meal is mixed with cornstarch and water is added until a smooth and consistent dough is obtained. It is covered and left in a warm place for the fermentation to take place. After fermentation, the kenkey is partially cooked, wrapped in banana leaves, corn husks, or foil, and steamed. There are several versions of kenkey, such as Ga and Fante kenkey. The Ga kenkey is more common in most parts of Ghana. * References = External links = * Phil Bartle, \\"Kwasi Bruni; Corn and the Europeans\\", VCN.org. * \\"West Africa Recipe - Cooking Kenkey\\".

It was produced by SIFAL, a production company run by de Zavalia and his partner Luis Saslavsky. The production company disbanded the following year, after de Zavalia had made Escala en la ciudad, his feature film debut, and Saslavsky had completed his second and most famous movie, Crimen a las tres.  Plot  The story follows Jaime Lara, a passenger whose ship makes a stop in Buenos Aires for one day. Lara elopes, leaving his wife on board, and walks around the city at night, coming to meet a beautiful yet frivolous hooker, Isa. Jaime and Isa go to a bar, and later on to her house, but Jaime would rather talk to her than anything else. Meanwhile, the captain of another ship, Cristian, is looking for Isa \\"to settle a score\\". Drunk, he meets Isa's neighbor and fellow prostitute, Tita, who falls for him. Jaime and Isa walk around the city and make a stop in a clothes' shop. They have a chance encounter with a group of actors who are short of two people for rehearsal. When they see Isa try a gown, they immediately approach them and ask them to join them in the show. They're introduced to their ringleader, the pompous Pamela, who hosts a rehearsal for a few selected critics. Jaime and Isa perform marvelously, despite the fact they read from the script while acting. Pamela congratulates them and has them driven away to a n expensive hotel. Isa refuses to have sex with Jaime, and the following day they take a stroll on a riverside park. Isa, unaware that Jaime has a wife waiting for him on the ship, questions him about his uneasiness, but he dismisses her questions. He promises that he will never leave her, and that they will both move to the countryside. For once, Isa is happy. They return to her home, where Jaime is distracted by the bellowing of the ship. Tita comes up and asks Isa down to her apartment. Cristian confronts Isa in Tita's place. He tells her that he has changed, and asks her to come back to him. Isa, however, refuses, and goes back upstairs to find that Jaime has abandoned her and gone back to the parting ship. Tita, having heard Cristian's proposal to Isa, shoots herself dead with Cristian's revolver. A steward walks in and takes Cristian away back to his ship. The final scene shows Isa back in her usual spot, waiting to prostitute herself. As the screen fades to black, an embittered Isa remembers Jaime's promises of love and devotion.

It is located in Belgrade's municipality of Voždovac, while the northern section belongs to the municipality of Vračar. It is also known as Lekino Brdo () after the top Communist official, Aleksandar Ranković (1909–80), whose nickname was Leka (\\"Leka's hill\\").  Location  Pašino Brdo, as the name says it (Serbian for \\"Pasha's hill\\"), is located on the hill of the same name, in the extreme north of the municipality of Voždovac and extreme south of the municipality of Vračar. Geographically, the hill and its slopes cover much larger area than what is today considered the neighborhood of Pašino Brdo, which is generally bordered by the neighborhoods of Dušanovac on the south, Šumice on the east and extends into Crveni Krst on the north-east and Čubura on the north-west.  Geography  On the southern side, the hill originates from the Belgrade-Niš highway, that is, the former valley of the Mokroluški potok and it elevates to the terminus of the trolleybus line 22 which is, with the small park and a church, located on the top of the hill. Then it descends to the north until the South Boulevard, or the former valley of the Čuburski potok. Thus, geographically, parts of the neighborhoods of Dušanovac and Šumice are located on the hill as well.  History  Pašino Brdo, formerly a hill in the outskirts of Belgrade, is today a residential area. Construction began after 1920 as a planned neighborhood, with a web of straight streets crossing each other. Despite being a residential settlement on the outskirts of Belgrade, and not having industrial or military facilities, Pašino Brdo and the neighboring Dušanovac was partially demolished during the heavy „Easter bombing“ of Belgrade by the Allies on 16 April 1944.  Name  The hill was named after the local governor Suleyman Pasha. During the First Serbian Uprising, leader of the rebels Karađorđe made a deal with Suleyman Pasha, guaranteeing the safe retreat to the Ottomans and their families to Bulgaria. The rebels broke the deal attacking the retreating Ottomans, and Suleyman himself was killed in the modern neighborhood of Zeleno Brdo, further to the east from Pašino Brdo. A Pasha's Drinking Fountain was built on the location. After World War II, the name was officially changed to Lekino Brdo, after Aleksandar Ranković. Though the original name was officially returned in the 1990s, the name Lekino Brdo remained in wide use. Additionally, the local community which occupies the top of the hill, was officially named \\"David Pajić\\" for the 1981 and 1991 censuses.  Characteristics  It has a small park on top of it (Češki park) with a new Church of the Transfiguration of Jesus. As a curiosity for a small neighborhood, there is another church in Pašino Brdo, the older Church of the Holy Trinity. A section of the park was turned into a modern children playground in April 2008. It is first of the planned total of 7 playgrounds on the territory of the municipality of Voždovac, constructed under new standards: harmless and ecological colors and varnishes, protective measures, top quality woods, rubber placed as floor, etc. Name of the playground is \\"Vrbica\\", celebrating Lazarus Saturday, called Vrbica in Serbian and generally considered a children's holiday.  Features  = Church of the Holy Trinity = After World War I, a motion was started for the construction of a church somewhere on the hill, in the suburb of Vojvoda Stepa, as the neighborhood was called at the time. The idea was pushed by the retired teacher Živojin Radosavljević, who was also a member of the board for the construction of the new Church of Saint Sava on Vračar hill. The idea was to relocate the iconostasis from the old Church of Saint Sava to this new church. The Society for development of Vojvoda Stepa suburb opted for renting some of the already existing houses instead of building a new one. In 1922 they rented the summer house of vojvoda Petar Bojović at 89 Gospodara Vučića Street, and adapted it into the chapel, with added bell tower. During the Interbellum, it was the only church between the Church of Saint Sava in Vračar and the town of Grocka on the east. The church was paying rent to Bojović until 1945 and to his descendants until 1948. In the massive process of nationalization by the new Communist government after 1945, the house was taken away from the Bojović family and auctioned for sale. The Serbian Orthodox Church purchased the object, becoming its full proprietor. Preparations for the construction of the new building on the location of the old one began in the mid 2000s. The old parochial home was demolished in 2015 and the new one was finished in 2017. In August 2018 the church itself was demolished and the construction of a new one began. In the meantime, the church service will temporarily be held in the new parochial home. The construction works should be finished by the Easter of 2019, followed by the furnishing and paining of the church. The new building was designed by architect Aleksandar Lukić, in the Serbo-Byzantine Revival style.  Municipality  When Belgrade was divided into raions in 1945, Pašino Brdo became part of the Raion VI. From June 1945 to December 1946, Pašino Brdo was one of 5 administrative neighborhoods within the Raion VI. When districts were abolished in 1952 and municipalities created, Pašino Brdo got its own municipality, which however was abolished on September 1, 1955 when Pašino Brdo was annexed to the municipality of Voždovac. At the time, estimated population of the municipality was 25,000. According to the 2002 census the population of the administratively much smaller local community of Pašino Brdo was 3,808, with a few small adjoining neighborhoods 10,774, while in 2011 population was 3,997 and 10,656.

It is northwest of Cavan Town in the centre of County Cavan's lakeland and geopark region and the Erne catchment environment of rivers, lakes, wetlands and woodland. Together with the Lough Oughter Special Protected Area (SPA), it has been recognised by the EU programme for wildlife Natura 2000 since 2010. Killeshandra is noted by Fáilte Ireland as an \\"Angling Centre of Excellence\\", and as a hub for the Cavan Walking Festival which takes place in May each year. There are several looped walking and cycling trails in Killykeen Forest Park. The town is also home to Killeshandra Gaelic Football Club, known locally as the Killeshandra Leaguers. History Killeshandra owes its name to the old Church of the Rath (built originally in the 14th century by monks from Drumlane priory. The town was created during the Ulster Plantation, when Sir Alexander Hamilton of Innerwick, Scotland was granted lands by the crown in July 1610 to build a castle and create a Protestant community around the barony of Tullyhunco. The 1641 rising and civil war was a particularly difficult period in Killeshandra's history, as the Hamiltons with their neighbours the Craigs were forced out of their settled lands by the O'Reillys. It was not until after the war, during the Restoration period, that Sir Francis Hamilton regained control of the area. He set about building a market town with Scottish planters and migrant Huguenot settlers who were especially noted for their industry and thrift. The new settlers and their families quickly adapted to the local conditions, beginning to grow flax and process linen in the Cavan region. The earliest papal records of a church building in the area date from the fourteenth century on the site of a former rath (fort), then a dependency of Drumlane priory referred to as the 'Church of the Rath'. From the early 17th century the church was \\"reformed\\" for Protestant use and included the glebe lands allocated by the Hamiltons to the Anglican Kilmore diocese, for Scottish Episcopalian worship. Later in the century when peace was restored, the church was remodelled after the death of Sir Charles Hamilton in 1688. Recreated by the family (Barons of Castle Hamilton) as a lasting memorial to departed members of the original Scottish Hamilton family. The remains of this church today form part of a protected monument and can still be seen at the lower end of the town (opposite Lakeland Dairies). This church displays some unusual architectural characteristics; it is T-shaped, with a south-facing transept in the Renaissance neo-classical style, described in the Pevsner Guide to South Ulster as \\"arguably the finest Restoration building in Ulster, a handsome evocation of the improving architectural eloquence of the age\\". The east-facing window is in the more traditional Gothic style. Hamilton heraldic embellishment is visible on the south gable wall and gate pillars. When a new Anglican church was built (circa 1842) further up the main street, some of the earlier Hamilton family memorials attributed to well-known Irish sculptor William Kidwell were brought from the old church and placed inside the new building, where they can still be seen. The graveyard continued in \\"mixed\\" community use for well over a century after the church was closed; it is now also protected as a National Monument. This graveyard includes some interesting 19th-century mausoleums and heraldic memorials from families dating back to the early 18th century. Linen production around Killeshandra grew considerably following an incentive in 1760 from the Linen Board. It was later described in Pigot's 1824 Directory as \\"[t]he greatest linen market in the county, and the inhabitants of the town and neighbourhood are principally employed in its manufacture\\". However, failure to capitalise on industrial methods of linen production when market sales approached their peak meant that Killeshandra would inevitably lose in the race to compete with the bigger linen-exporting towns further north, eventually causing hardship and destitution for many local flax growers and linen producers. The Missionary Sisters of the Holy Rosary were founded in 1924 in Killeshandra, and are sometimes referred to as the Killeshandra Nuns.The Holy Rosary Sisters Story www.knuns.org Population and demographics According to the CSO 2016 census, at that time Killeshandra's population stood at 388 persons, an increase of 6.6% from 364 in the 2011 census, which in turn showed an 11% drop in population from the 2006 census. Compare population levels in 1911, when the town population was 566 persons (46% higher than present levels). However, in the electoral division, which includes the town and surrounding district, a slight increase in population up to 1,141 persons was recorded in 2011. In previous centuries, when there were several thousand people living near Killeshandra, local industry and agriculture sustained the local population. Economic changes Throughout the twentieth century, Killeshandra's economy was based on its agriculture base, while Killeshandra Creamery became one of Ireland's leading dairy and milk processing co-operatives. At one time Killeshandra was a hub of industry in the region, with several flax and corn mills in addition to Fletcher's sawmill, which was built on the site of an earlier brewery. From the 1860s the town was serviced by a railway line to Crosdoney and Cavan. However the closure of the railway to goods and passengers in 1960 was the first significant result of population decline throughout the region. The eventual closure of Fletcher's sawmill and the demise of street market trading would also signal the end for Killeshandra's linen market house, built around 1790 by then-landlord Robert H. Southwell. The market house fell into disrepair and was finally demolished in the late 1960s. Today Killeshandra, in addition to being a base for the Lakeland Dairy Company, is as tourist destination within County Cavan for anglers, walkers and wildlife enthusiasts. The Lough Bawn Hotel is located in the middle of the village and there are several B&Bs; nearby. Killeshandra has shops, two national schools, denominational churches, restaurants and several pubs. A community hall was completed in September 2013, replacing a hall built in the 1970s. The new hall has a large open space for indoor sporting events, as well as space for dancing, concerts and exhibitions. Public transport =Bus= From September 2018, Local Link Cavan-Monaghan route 929 will serve the town with four journeys in each direction, linking the town with Cavan, Newtowngore and Ballinamore. The town is also served by several Local Link Cavan Monaghan door-to-door routes. Bus Éireann serves the town once weekly on Tuesdays, with route 465 providing a return journey to Cavan via Arvagh and Ballinagh, and a one-way to journey to Carrigallen. =Rail= Killashandra railway station was the once terminus of a short branch railway line between Cavan and Crossdoney on the Midland Great Western Railway line. Opened in 1886, the Killeshandra branch line, along with the Crossdoney to Cavan line, discontinued passenger service in 1947. The line remained open for goods traffic until 1959, then was closed completely in January 1960. Most of the rail infrastructure is now gone, but the station and a nearby goods shed still remain. Dairy industry Lakeland Dairies, which is the second largest dairy co-operative and third largest dairy processor in Ireland, has its headquarters in Killeshandra. The dairy industry in Killeshandra began when the Drummully Co-operative Society was founded on 23 September 1896. A committee decided to establish a creamery in Killeshandra when local farmers promised the milk from 987 cows. In March 1898, the new dairy business became known as the Killeshandra Co-operative Agricultural Society. That business was successful, winning prizes for butter and dairy products at home and abroad. In 1996, a century after its founding, Killeshandra Co-op was handling the milk from over 4,000 farmer suppliers. Today this co-op has transformed through mergers with other companies to form Lakeland Dairies. The Lakeland Dairies co-operative operates on a cross-border basis, employing over 800 people and has 2,400 dairy farmers supplying milk to the co-operative across 15 counties. In October 2013, Lakeland Dairies purchased the former Ulster Bank premises in Killeshandra town, next door to the company's headquarters.

Biography He was born in Walthamstow, Essex, the eldest son of William Dillwyn (1743–1824) and Sarah Dillwyn (née Weston). His father, a Pennsylvanian Quaker had returned to Britain in 1777 during Philadelphia's worst period in the American War of Independence and settled at Higham Lodge, Walthamstow, Essex, UK. William Dillwyn was a vociferous anti-slavery campaigner and toured England and South Wales in his work for the Anti-Slavery Committee. William Dillwyn was related to George Haynes through the Emlen and Physick families in Philadelphia and it is likely that the opportunity to buy the Cambrian Pottery in Swansea, Wales, from Haynes came about through these family connections in America. William's letters to his daughter Suzanna are held by the Library Company of Philadelphia and stored at the Historical Society of Pennsylvania. These letters show that the factory was bought by William to keep Lewis active while the latter was suffering from gout. The highlight of this period of production of Swansea Pottery was the opening by Lewis Weston Dillwyn and George Haynes of the Cambrian Company, the Swansea Potteries London Warehouse on Fleet Street which operated between 1806–1807.See The Cambrian Company, Swansea Pottery In London 1806-1808, Jonathan Gray 2012 In 1814 the pottery took over the workforce of the Nantgarw Pottery and began to make porcelain. Lewis Weston Dillwyn however was also renowned for his published works on botany and conchology, including his 1809 work The British Confervae, an illustrated study of British freshwater algae. Dillwyn is credited with discovering several species of the Conferva genus. Among the botanical illustrators of The British Confervae are the artists William Jackson Hooker, Ellen Hutchins and William Weston Young. He was elected in 1804 as a Fellow of the Royal Society. In 1817 he temporarily retired from the pottery. In 1818 he became High Sheriff of Glamorgan and was elected to the First Reformed Parliament in 1834 as MP for Glamorganshire. He bought Sketty Hall near Swansea and was elected Mayor of Swansea in 1839.http://thepeerage.com/p37112.htm Dillwyn was also one of the founders of the Royal Institution of South Wales and its first President, and in 1840 he published a short history of Swansea. 1833 lithograph portrait by Eden Upton Eddis He married Mary Adams, the daughter of Colonel John Llewelyn of Penllergaer, Llangyfelach in 1807. They had six children, including the noted photographer John Dillwyn Llewelyn (1810–1882), MP for Swansea Lewis Llewelyn Dillwyn (1814-1892) and pioneering female photographer Mary Dillwyn (1816-1906). His granddaughters by his son Lewis were the novelist and industrialist Amy Dillwyn, and lepidopterist Mary De la Beche Nicholl. His granddaughter by John was the Welsh astronomer and pioneer in scientific photography Thereza Dillwyn Llewelyn. He died in Sketty Hall, Swansea, in 1855. .

A catcher, he appeared in 299 Major League games for the St. Louis Cardinals (1946–49), Philadelphia Phillies (1951–52) and Boston Red Sox (1952–54). The native of Lincoln Park, Michigan, threw and batted right-handed. He stood tall and weighed . Catcher with three MLB clubs Wilber signed with the American League St. Louis Browns in 1938, but was acquired by the Cardinals in 1940 and played in their extensive farm system until the outbreak of World War II; he missed the 1942–45 seasons while serving in the United States Army Air Force, where he attained the rank of captain. In , he resumed his baseball career and made his Major League debut, appearing in four games before being sent to the Triple-A Columbus Red Birds. He did not appear in the 1946 World Series. Wilber played in 51 games for the 1947 Cardinals and 27 more in 1948, but did not spend a full season in MLB again until , when he appeared in 84 games, 61 as the starting catcher, for the Phillies. After only two games played for the Phillies, Wilber was purchased by the Red Sox on May 12. He served for three seasons as the Red Sox' second-string and third-string receiver behind Sammy White, through 1954. Boston then traded him to the New York Giants for infielder Billy Klaus that December, but the Giants granted Wilber his release to enable him to join the coaching staff of the Chicago White Sox for the season. On August 27, 1951, Wilber hit three home runs to lead the Phillies to a 3–0 victory over the Cincinnati Reds.Wilber, p.8 Two years later, while playing for the Red Sox, Wilber had 27 hits and 29 runs batted in, making him one of the few big leaguers to have more RBIs than hits in a season.Wilber, p.58 In all or parts of eight MLB seasons, Wilber compiled 720 at bats, 67 runs, 174 hits, 35 doubles, seven triples, 19 homers, 115 RBI, one stolen base and 44 bases on balls. He batted .242 with an on-base percentage of .286, a slugging percentage of .389, 280 total bases and five sacrifice hits. According to The Sporting News' Official Baseball Register, Wilber had a unique hobby during his catching career. When a pitcher hurled an especially noteworthy game, Wilber would decorate a game baseball, writing the line score of the contest, as well as game highlights, on the ball, then present it to his pitcher.Spink, J.G. Taylor, publisher, The Official 1956 Baseball Register. St. Louis: The Sporting News, 1956. Manager, scout and coach Wilber managed in minor league baseball both during his playing career and after it ended. He led the Cardinals' Houston Buffaloes Double-A farm club as a catcher-manager in 1949. Then, after hanging up his catching gear, he managed at the Triple-A level with the Louisville Colonels, Houston Buffs of the American Association, Charleston Senators, Tacoma Twins, Denver Bears and Spokane Indians. He skippered affiliates of the Baltimore Orioles, both the original and expansion editions of the Washington Senators, and the Senators' current incarnations as the Minnesota Twins and Texas Rangers. His one-game stint as skipper of the 1973 Texas Rangers—as interim pilot between Whitey Herzog and Billy Martin on September 7, he won his only game as manager,Retrosheet box score: 1973-09-07 10–8 against the future world champion Oakland Athletics—occurred after Wilber led the Rangers' Spokane affiliate to the 1973 championship of the Pacific Coast League, one of three league titles in his minor-league resume. Wilber was a coach for the 1955–56 White Sox and the 1970 Senators, serving under former teammates Marty Marion and Ted Williams. He also scouted for the Orioles, Twins, Athletics, Cincinnati Reds and Detroit Tigers. He died in St. Petersburg, Florida at the age of 83. Wilber's son, Rick, is a writer, editor, and teacher. His two other sons, Del Wilber Jr. (Philadelphia Phillies) and Bob Wilber (Detroit Tigers and Oakland A's) both played professional minor league baseball and Bob Wilber followed in his father's footsteps as a scout (Toronto Blue Jays) after his playing days.

Sir Keith Joseph kept the seat for the Conservative Party with a slightly reduced numerical majority, but increased in percentage terms. Candidates The Conservative Party's choice of Sir Keith Joseph reflected his strong performance at the 1955 general election when he had failed to be elected, but only by 125 votes, in the London constituency of Baron's Court. Joseph was then a 37-year-old director of building and civil engineering companies and non-practising Barrister. The Labour Party chose Harry Waterman, who had fought the constituency in the previous election. He was a 38-year-old local solicitor and a member of the Fabian Society. The election was a 'straight fight' with no Liberal or Independent candidate intervening. Results Sir Keith Joseph won with a majority of 5,869 on a turnout substantially down on the general election. He achieved a slight swing towards his party compared to 1955.

Often, single blade propeller configurations are touted as having a much greater efficiency than multiblade propellers, but this is a falsehood outside the inertial losses in spinning a heavier propeller, and the minimal additional drag from added blades.

Captured by the Germans during the 1940 invasion of Norway and renamed Kamerun, she was returned to the Norwegians after the end of the Second World War and recommissioned in 1947. Rauma remained in service until being sold for scrapping in 1963. Description As the threat of war in Europe became ever more clear the decision was made to improve the Royal Norwegian Navy's mine warfare capabilities. At first a number of 2. class gunboats were rebuilt into minelayers and minesweepers, but with war looming it soon became clear that more capable vessels were required. Thus, two new purpose-built minesweepers were constructed at Nylands Verksted in Oslo; Otra and Rauma. Both ships were completed and commissioned only a short time before the German invasion of Norway. Otra class vessels used the Oropesa system of minesweeping. The invasion =Prelude= Shortly before the German invasion the UK announced that the Royal Navy had laid out a number of minefields along the coast of Norway to interfere with the German import of Swedish iron ore through the North Norwegian port of Narvik. The British government claimed to have mined three areas; off Stad, Hustadvika, and Landegode north of Bodø. In response to this report, the Norwegian government ordered the minesweepers Otra and Rauma to sail north from their base in Horten and sweep the minefields on 9 April 1940. =The invasion force is spotted= Before the order to go north could be carried out, however, the German invasion of Norway began in the early hours of 9 April. As reports of intruding warships started coming in Otra was sent out to investigate, and at 0410hrs reported that the intruders were German. The invasion flotilla blocked Otras return to Horten.Abelsen 1986: 88 =Battle of Horten harbour= An important part of the Germans' plan to invade Norway was the seizure of the Royal Norwegian Navy's main naval base at Horten in the Oslofjord. A force consisting of the R boats R.17 and R.27 and the torpedo boats Albatros and Kondor entered Horten harbour at 0435 hrs, shortly after the invasion was identified by Otra. Defending the naval base was Rauma and the minelayer HNoMS Olav Tryggvason. Rauma charged the enemy vessels with her single 76 mm gun and two machine guns, succeeding in helping Olav Tryggvason sink R.17 and force a damaged Albatros to flee the area. However, despite the intense fire from the two Norwegian warships, R.27 managed to land a small force of infantry in the harbour before running aground after repeated hits. While running the gauntlet between the Norwegian ships R.27 returned fire and hit Rauma repeatedly, severely damaging the minesweeper and killing her commander, Lieutenant Ingolf Carl Winsnes, and a sailor, as well as wounding six others.Abelsen 1986: 89 Only eight crew members remained unwounded. At 0735hrs, after threats of aerial bombardment of the naval base and the city right next to it, as well as a misguided impression of the size of the German landing force, the Norwegian forces at Horten surrendered. German service as Kamerun After the German capture of Horten the surrendered Norwegian vessels were pressed into Kriegsmarine service. Rauma was repaired and recommissioned as Kamerun on 18 April 1940. Kamerun first served as a Vorpostenboot in the Hafenschutzflotille Oslo, later being converted into a minelayer. Kamerun spent her entire war in Norway and was part of the German Mine Sweeping Administration (GM-SA) after the German surrender in 1945. Second World War Post-war service After the war Rauma was recommissioned in 1947 and in 1949 was rebuilt as a minelayer training ship. She was decommissioned in Horten 21 August 1959 and laid up until put out of service and sold in April 1963.

Founded in 1966, it is distinctive because of its multicultural and progressive educational philosophy, the diversity of its student body, its sliding scale tuition system, its incorporation of farm experiences and the activism of its students. History Manhattan Country School's origins are rooted in the social, ideological, and educational principles of the 1960s. Founders Gus and Marty Trowbridge were encouraged by judicial decisions in favor of equal opportunity and inspired by the leadership of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Curriculum The curriculum at MCS is very rigorous, demanding, and sufficiently challenging for students. Until the 6-7s (1st grade), students are not given any homework. Once students reach the 6-7s, homework is given to them weekly on Wednesday. The amount of homework starts to slowly increase while students are in the Lower School. In the 8-9s and 9-10s (3rd and 4th grades), students are assigned to read a certain amount of books every year, and record their weekly reading process in a reading log. From Pre-K until the 8th grade, there is a theme or central focus in the year's curriculum. For example, the 8-9s, the focus is on Native Americans, and eventually branches out to European Explorers. Students must put on plays inspired by the explorer that they have been assigned to study. In the 9-10s, the primary focus is Migration to the Americas, and students take class trips to Washington Heights and even Ellis Island. The themes and focuses in the classroom become more complex as students enter the Upper School. In the 5th grade, students study Sumarian life, environmental issues, and also Egypt. Toward the end of the year, an Egyptian market (which 5th graders put together), is held in the school Library. All classes can come and visit. In the sixth grade, students learn about the Civil Rights Movement, by delving into autobiographies, watching documentaries, and even putting together a play, which is presented at the annual Martin Luther King, Jr. assembly. In the 7th and 8th grade, History, Science and English are taught with a mixed group of 7th and 8th graders in the classroom. An alternating two-year program is put together for these three subjects. For example, an entering 8th grader would be learning about the topics that the last year's graduates learned about when they were in 7th grade). The English Department is particularly strong at MCS. Students read a wide variety of novels, and with 7th and 8th graders, a Shakespeare play is incorporated in the year's curriculum annually. Novels and plays that students have read as part of the curriculum include, The Catcher in the Rye, To Kill a Mockingbird and Romeo and Juliet . Farm program The Manhattan Country School Farm is a small working farm in the northern Catskill Mountains, located 150 miles from New York City in Roxbury, New York. Students tend the gardens, care for the animals (chickens, cows, pigs and sheep), learn to weave, explore fields, mountains and streams, and study traditional and contemporary life in the Catskills. Farm trips emphasize human dependence on natural processes and community members' reliance on each other. Working together to make the farm relatively self-sufficient, students learn to use farm products for food, fuel, and clothing. At the same time they examine the economies of nature, in the wild and on the farm, and determine the best measures for environmental conservation. Sharing these activities, attending daily classes, and performing household and barn chores, the students come to function as a mutually reliant community. The daily schedule begins at 7:00 a.m. Morning and evening barn chores include egg collecting, feeding animals and cleaning their pens. Household chores involve setting tables and cleaning up after meals, and cleaning the entire house. These jobs are rotated and every child has two or three tasks to do each day. Morning and afternoon classes include meal planning and cooking, churning butter, baking bread, and preserving garden produce; seasonal farm work such as planting and harvesting, assisting with sheep shearing, and collecting sap to boil into maple syrup; outdoor maintenance work such as fence repair, caring for nature trails, splitting fire wood, and keeping the wood bins stocked; textiles processes such as carding, spinning, dyeing and weaving the wool from our sheep; nature field trips in the woods and fields and along the streams on the farm; hikes to scenic promontories in the Catskills and visits to other farms or places of historical interest. A daily quiet hour is used for independent study, reading or journal writing. After-dinner activities might be an evening nature walk, a dramatic game or performance, story-reading, or an outdoor group game. Bedtime is 8:30 for younger children, later for older groups. Disregarding Farm rules such as safety, fire, bedtime and behavior guidelines can lead to suspension from a farm trip. The Upper School is made up of the 5th to 8th grades. These grades must complete requirements to graduate from the school, and with helpful staff, all students graduate (unless expelled). The completed requirements from the 7th grade are brought over to the 8th grade when they move up. The requirements are as the following: -One cooking requirement. -One use of yeast requirement. -The participation of 2 out of the 3 following classes given at the farm: -Meat Production Class -Milk Production Class -Reproduction Class -One textiles project completion requirement Tuition system Manhattan Country School has a distinctive sliding scale tuition system that was originally known as \\"Tuition Reform\\" and is now called the \\"Family Financial Commitment Plan.\\" The system was designed to eliminate the distinction between \\"scholarship\\" and \\"full tuition\\" students by encouraging all families to pay for school using a sliding scale tuition based on family income. Families of sufficient means are asked to voluntarily contribute a comparable percentage of their incomes to the percentage asked of other families. The concepts behind the plan were originally developed by Frank Roosevelt and Hugh Southern in the context of intense debates during early years of MCS. That process is described in Frank Roosevelt and Thomas Vitullo- Martin, Tuition Reform for Private Schools: The Manhattan Country School Plan . That scale is, in part, based on the \\"cost per child\\" which is the total budget divided by the number of students (with some adjustment for grade level). \\"Full tuition\\" is equal to the cost per child. The principle behind this is that families of means should not be subsidized by annual giving or the endowment; this is in contrast to many other schools which have a \\"gap\\" that represents the difference between tuition and the actual cost of educating a child. Each year, families receive a Family Financial Worksheet which is used to calculate their contracted fee based on household income with an adjustment for assets. Currently the highest rate for tuition is 12 percent of this adjusted figure. Families whose calculated rate yield an among higher than the cost per child are asked to pledge an amount equal to the difference between the two amounts. Student body Manhattan Country School was founded with the goal of being a model racially integrated school. Today it remains well known for the diversity of its student body. There is no racial majority. According to the MCS website 45% of the student body is white, 28% is African American, 19% is Hispanic/Latino and 8% is Asian American. About 22% of students define themselves as multiracial or biracial. Approximately 70 percent of MCS students pay less than the full \\"cost per child.\\" This is among the highest percentages of students receiving financial aid at any independent school. Enrollment typically consists of 190 students evenly divided between girls and boys. Notable alumni *Daisy von Scherler Mayer *Trina McGee- Davis *Kelis Rogers *John Burnham Schwartz *Debo Adegbile *Emory Cohen High school program MCS has a high school counseling program in which school faculty orchestrate a weekly high school placement class for eighth graders. During this class, which begins in the first weeks of school and ends near winter break, Deans or Associate Deans of Admission come to MCS and provide information about the schools that they represent. Schools that have visited MCS include: The Dwight-Englewood School, The Northfield Mount Hermon School, Suffield Academy and The Calhoun school. Only independent day and boarding schools are scheduled for appointments at the school. In addition, eighth graders are equipped with a public school directory book, listing the all public schools in New York City. The same is for parochial schools. An ISEE Test and SSAT guidance course is also offered to eighth graders, taught by an instructor from a testing organization from outside of the school. MCS faculty realize that applying to high schools is a toilsome experience, so students are always welcome to share their feelings with high school counselors in the Third Floor Office. MCS graduates have enrolled in Packer Collegiate Institute, Ethical Culture Fieldston School, PPAS, Saint Ann's School (Brooklyn), Friends Seminary, Bronx High School of Science, Trinity School (New York City), Fordham Preparatory School, Eleanor Roosevelt High School (New York City), LaGuardia High School, and many others. Some graduates have decided to branch out of the city. Boarding schools that MCS graduates have enrolled in are Groton School, The Lawrenceville School, Westtown School, Williston Northampton School, The Hotchkiss School, Phillips Academy, Northfield Mount Hermon School, and George School.

This phenomenon can be a result of the economy, a change in mortgage rates, consumer speculations, or other fundamental and non-fundamental reasons. Property values declining instead of rising Below information is not cited properly. Links listed below are no longer valid, thus the information is too. MSN reports that home prices have dropped by a record amount and illustrates with a chart of historical real estate prices.\\"S&P;/Case & Shiller Housing Price Indices\\" Real estate property values have trended upward in the range of 2–5% almost every year since World War II, but since 2006 they have declined. From 2007 to 2008 prices declined as much as 39% per year -though the average decline appears to be lower. Buyer agency growth At one time, all real estate brokers and agents, or Realtors, practiced \\"single agency\\", meaning they represented only the buyer or the seller. In the 1990s, the concept of buyer agency became popular, allowing a buyer to retain an agent who would represent the best interests of the buyer alone. The first national company to provide this service was The Buyer's Agent, Inc. A 2008 study by Consumer Reports indicates that prior to this development, a Realtor was presumed by state law to be working for the seller. The same study shows that buyers using buyer agents obtained a savings of $5000 in the price of the home as compared to prices paid by unrepresented buyers. It remains true that an unrepresented real estate buyer can still call the sellers agent to arrange a showing of the property. In such cases, the buyer should be advised by Agency Disclosure Laws (a state law in every state in the U.S.) that any information obtained, as well as all conversations and negotiations undertaken, will be for the benefit of the seller. Lower commission rates Historical rates are presented in a report by the Government Accountability Office, Congress's investigative arm. A 2005 studyGAO Report, August 2005, \\"Real Estate Brokerage, Factors That May Affect Price Competition\\", Gao.gov of real estate commission rates, reported that realtors tended to charge, \\"about 5 percent to 7 percent of a property's selling price...\\". More recently, CBS News, \\"60 Minutes\\" television news magazine reported in 2007 that competitive pressure resulting from a record number of licensed agents has driven down the average sales commission rates paid by sellers. A new breed of marketplaces that enable agents to compete for sellers further adds pressure to the commission rate structure. In some states, companies such as Redfin still advertise a commission but provide a rebate to sellers based on the quality of their surveys reflected in post- close surveys. This is also fraught with difficulties. Another trend is the emergence of alternatives to the commission model, including flat-fee, hourly home selling, and for sale by owner tools. Marketing trends The Internet has become a major lead generation method for real estate marketing, eclipsing local newspapers and all other sources as the consumer's most preferred method to learn about homes for sale. \\"An overwhelming majority (87%) of recent home buyers in the US say they used the internet as an information resource during their home-buying process, and nearly one-third say they first learned about their newly purchased home from an online channel, according to a study by the National Association of Realtors (NAR). Majority of real estate companies use popular internet marketing methods like SEO, advertising and social media. Websites like Craigslist (United States), Daft.ie (Republic of Ireland) and Gumtree (UK) became in the 21st century the main sources for both buyers and sellers. Rapid changes in the market environment forced some countries to introduce new laws regulating real property market on the web. Even with the introduction of the internet, traditional media and methods of generating leads were still an important part of Real Estate trade: Mobile applications are also changing the way real estate agents conduct business. Apps like Zillow, Trulia, Zumper and Rentberry are primarily accessed via mobile devices and have become very popular sources for listing properties for sale or rent. These applications function similarly to websites like Craigslist in that they allow agents or private sellers to list a property like they would in a classified ad albeit with more a more dynamic display as well as mechanisms for users browsing a listing to contact the seller directly from the app. Mobile applications are particularly prominent with millennial real estate customers. US government involvement The United States Department of Justice Antitrust Division announced the launch of a new website in October 2007 to \\"educate consumers and policymakers about the potential benefits that competition can bring to consumers of real estate brokerage services and the barriers that inhibit that competition.\\" Among other findings, they report that certain new sales models can reduce consumer home sales costs \\"by thousands of dollars. For example, in states that allow open competition, some buyer's brokers rebate up to two-thirds of their commission to the customer, and some seller's brokers offer limited-service packages that let sellers list their homes on the local Multiple Listing Service (MLS) for as little as a few hundred dollars.\\" The Justice Department updated their information in a new website in 2016.

He is the younger brother of Chong Houhu, the Grand Duke of the North. In appearance, Chong Heihu could be seen wearing a Nine-Cloud-Burning-Flame helmet equipped with a jade belt, a bright red robe, and golden chain mail. With a long red beard, eyes like two golden bells, and duel golden axes by his side, Chong Heihu was a feared man of great prowess. At the time of Chong Houhu's third desperate retreat, Chong Heihu would come from the Cao region with three thousand flying tiger soldiers to assist. In time, Chong Heihu, along with his elder brother, would approach the Ji province's city gate. However, Chong Heihu solely wished to talk matters through with his old friend, Su Hu. Su Hu's son, Su Quanzhong would appear before Chong Heihu and bark words of malcontent. Thus, Chong Heihu lifted his legendary golden axes to show Quanzhong his place. Through their battle, Chong Heihu was immensely surprised at the skill of Quanzhong with his spear. Chong Heihu would thus retreat, and Quanzhong pursued with persistence. However, Chong Heihu used this chance to unleash the legendary magical gourd from his back (a gourd previously given to him by a superiorman). Black smoke spewed forth even covering the entire sun in an instant. While summoning a sacred eagle as well, Chong Heihu would knock Quanzhong from his horse and effectively capture him. Some time following this point, the renowned crow commander Zheng Lun would appear before Chong Heihu's camp and ask for battle. Chong Heihu would retort with the words, \\"Man! How dare you made such bold speech? Your master, having rebelled against the king, will have his body broken and his bones powdered. You, my friend, will enjoy the same fate!\\" Thus Chong Heihu would exert his full renown within his battle against Zheng Lun. Zheng Lun, a great man destined to be a god, easily realized that Chong Heihu's large gourd was full of magic potential, and he would thus exert two large jets of smoke from his nostrils which would knock Chong Heihu from his saddle, unconscious. Once captured, Chong Heihu would drink with his old friend, Su Hu. Once Ji Chang took action and ended the coalition with a simple letter, Chong Heihu would head back to his region after expressing his immense respect and gratitude. Chong Heihu was appointed as the deity of Nanyue Emperor (南岳大帝) in the end.Fengshen Yanyi Chapter 99.

He has been with BBC Radio 5 Live since it started in 1994, and presented the Drive programme for 16 years from 1998 to 2014. Early life Allen was born in Rochford, Essex and attended the independent Brentwood School. At 18 he left school and started work with his local newspaper. He emigrated to Australia and worked for the Sydney Daily Telegraph. Broadcasting career In the 1970s Allen switched to working in radio, joining Independent Radio News, the newly launched news service for UK commercial radio. He eventually became the network's political editor while working at Westminster. He also worked as a presenter at its sister radio station LBC, the London news and talk station. Allen then switched to television and was ITN political correspondent until 1992, when he was one of \\"a string of high-profile resignations\\" following the company's budget cuts. He then joined London News Network. On 1 March 1994 the BBC announced that Allen was to host its new Breakfast programme on BBC Radio 5 Live. In 1997 Breakfast was extended by half an hour. Also in 1997, The Times described the \\"witty repartee\\" of Allen and co-presenter (and future protagonist) Jane Garvey as the best illustration of the station's tone, \\"friendly, informal, brisk, and mercifully, not terribly politically correct\\". Garvey describes him as \\"the legendary Peter Allen who taught me a lot about broadcasting, and even more about confectionery\\".https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/profiles/1rtmf0y9DWkzm3Pwb0cHP2g/jane- garvey On 31 August 1997, Allen and James Naughtie hosted the BBC Radio coverage of the death of Diana, Princess of Wales which saw Radios 2, 3, 4 and BBC Radio 5 Live taking a single programme. This coverage won a Sony Award for best news event. During 13 years working together at Five Live, following Breakfast with Drive, Allen and Garvey won six Sony Awards including the Gold award for news broadcaster of the year in 2002. In 2007, newspapers cited unnamed sources which said that Allen had been rejected as John Humphrys' replacement on Radio 4's Today programme because he was not \\"posh enough\\" and did not have an Oxbridge background. A BBC spokesperson responded \\"The reason we are not commenting is that it is about whether or not someone went for a job that may or not exist. Consequently, we cannot really get into it.\\" He has been with the network since 1994 and was the co-presenter of BBC Radio 5 Live's Drive programme for more than 16 years, from September 1998 to October 2014. He also chairs conferences and hosts events and award ceremonies, as well as performing as an after-dinner speaker. In July 2014 the BBC announced that he was moving to a morning slot for three days a week, replacing Victoria Derbyshire who was leaving the station. In August 2015, Allen presented a live programme from Hiroshima on the 70th anniversary of the dropping of the atomic bomb, speaking to several survivors of the attack and an American physicist who helped to design the bombs in the Manhattan Project. From November 2016, Allen co-hosted a 5 Live Sunday evening programme with Jane Garvey. From January 2018 to September 2019 he co-hosted a Sunday evening programme on the same station, Peter Allen and Caroline Barker, in which they \\"delve into the personalities behind the headlines\\".

Anitha's family rents one of Manorama's houses. Vijay and Anitha pretend to hate each other, while they actually are in love. But later Anitha's father comes to know of the love matter and he requests a transfer to Chennai. Before going, Anitha leaves her new address on several envelopes and she says that those are love letters given by Vijay, Anitha's father gets angry and takes the letters and went to Vijay's house and tells him to take his useless love letters. After that, Vijay takes it and as he looks at it he knows that those aren't love letters, they're all Anitha's new address in Chennai. Vijay tries to find her. One day Vijay goes to a restaurant in Chennai to eat and he asks the server where the washroom is. The server tells him that there are two washrooms, one on the upstairs and another on the current ground floor. The server tells him to not go upstairs because it's dangerous. Vijay goes upstairs to the bathroom to expose himself to the Chennai people, but there, he finds an illegal sex film shoot happening. By this, they blame Vijay for the death of the restaurant owner (who tripped) and Vijay just has to escape. This news reaches Anitha's father who is a police officer. He tries to capture Vijay. But at last, Raghavan understands Vijay's innocence and unites Anitha with him. Finally, Vijay kills the villain also, who was really responsible for the restaurant owner's death.

Administered by the Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission, it lies on the banks of the Ohio River and is surrounded by downtown Ambridge. The Village is the last of three settlements established by the Harmony Society in the United States (another in Pennsylvania and one in Indiana). Established in 1824, it was designated a National Historic Landmark District in 1966 under the name of \\"Old Economy.\\" Harmony Society The Harmony Society was a Christian theosophy and pietist society founded in Iptingen, Germany, in 1785. Due to religious persecution by the Lutheran Church and the government in Württemberg,Robert Paul Sutton, Communal Utopias and the American Experience: Religious Communities (2003) p. 38 the Harmony Society moved to the United States in 1803–1804, initially purchasing 3,000 acres (12 km²) of land in Butler County, Pennsylvania. On February 15, 1805, they, together with about 400 followers, formally organized the Harmony Society, placing all their goods in common. The Society was founded and led by Johann Georg Rapp (1757–1847) and his adopted son, Frederick (Reichert) Rapp (1775–1834), and lasted for 100 years – roughly from 1805 until 1905. Members of the society were sometimes called Harmonists, Harmonites, or Rappites. The Harmony Society is best known for its worldly successes, eventually building three successive communities, first at Harmony, Pennsylvania (1804–1814), then New Harmony, Indiana (1814–1824), finally settling in Economy (now Ambridge, Pennsylvania). Old Economy Village, Pennsylvania Harmonia in the Harmony Society gardens in Old Economy Village. The Harmonites named their last town Economy, after the spiritual notion of the Divine Economy. Here under the business acumen and efficient management of Frederick Rapp, they enjoyed such prosperity that by 1829 they dominated the trade and the markets of Pittsburgh and down the Ohio River. They were accused of being a monopoly, New International Encyclopedia and it was advocated that the society be dissolved by the State. At this time the community was not neglectful of matters pertaining to art and culture. Frederick Rapp purchased and installed a museum, containing fine paintings and many curios and antiquities; they had a deer park, a floral park, and a maze, or labyrinth; they also had a good orchestra, were fond of music, and gave much attention to its cultivation. In 1832, the society suffered a serious division. Of 750 members, 250 became alienated through the influence of Bernhard Müller (self-styled Count de Leon), who, with 40 followers (also at variance with the authorities in the old country), had come to Economy to affiliate with the society. Rapp and Leon could not agree; a separation and apportionment of the property were therefore agreed upon. This secession of one-third of the society, consisting mostly of the flower of young manhood and young womanhood who did not want to maintain the custom of celibacy, broke Frederick's heart. He died within two years. It resulted in a considerable fracturing of the community. Nevertheless, the society remained prosperous in business investments for many more years to come. After Frederick Rapp's death, in 1834, the business management passed successively into the hands of George Rapp, who died in 1847; R. L, Baker and Jacob Henrici, 1847–69; J. Henrici and Jonathan Lenz, 1869–92; J. S. Duss, 1892–1903; Susie C. Duss, 1903-06. The settlements were economically successful, producing many goods in a clothing factory, a sawmill, a tannery, and from their vineyards and distillery. They also produced high quality silk for garments. The Harmonites were industrious and utilized the latest technologies of the day in their factories. In Economy, the group aided the construction of the Pittsburgh and Lake Erie Railroad, established the Economy Savings Institution and the Economy Brick Works, and operated the Economy Oil Company, Economy Planing Mill, Economy Lumber Company, and eventually donated some land in Beaver Falls for the construction of Geneva College. The society exerted a major influence on the economic development of Western Pennsylvania. But since the group chose to adopt celibacy and the people in the group kept getting older, more work gradually had to be hired out. The high-water mark of the society's prosperity was at the close of the administration of R. L. Baker in 1868; its wealth at that time being probably $2,000,000. By 1890, however, it was hopelessly in debt, on the verge of bankruptcy, with a depleted membership of aged people. The society was overwhelmed with litigation on the part of would-be heirs. J. S. Duss won the lawsuits and paid the society's indebtedness. The great strain which he had undergone undermining his health, he was forced to resign his trusteeship in 1903. There being but few members left, the remaining land and assets were sold under the leadership of Duss's wife, and the society was formally dissolved in 1906. In 1916, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania acquired 6 acres (0.024 km²) and 17 buildings of Old Economy, which became the present-day historic site. Other parts of the society's land were acquired by the American Bridge Company to expand the borough of Ambridge. Today, much of Ambridge outside of Old Economy Village is a historic district (the Economy Historic District) listed on the National Register of Historic Places. George Rapp Johann Georg Rapp (George Rapp) 1757–1847. Johann Georg Rapp (November 1, 1757 – August 7, 1847) was the founder of the religious sect called Harmonists, Harmonites, Rappites, or the Harmony Society. Born in Iptingen, Duchy of Württemberg, Germany, Rapp became inspired by the philosophies of Jakob Böhme, Philipp Jakob Spener, and Emanuel Swedenborg, among others. In the 1780s, George Rapp began preaching and soon started to gather a group of his own followers. His group officially split with the Lutheran Church in 1785 and was promptly banned from meeting. The persecution that Rapp and his followers experienced caused them to leave Germany and come to the United States in 1803. Rapp was a Pietist, and a number of his beliefs were shared by the Anabaptists, as well as groups such as the Shakers. Rapp's religious beliefs and philosophy were the cement that held his community together both in Germany and in America – a Christian community and commune, which in America organized as the Harmony Society. The Harmony Society built three American towns, became rich, famous, and survived for 100 years – roughly from 1805 until 1905. By 1798, Rapp and his group of followers had already begun to distance themselves from mainstream society. In the Lomersheimer Declaration, written in 1798, Rapp's followers refused to serve in the military or attend Lutheran schools. In 1803, when the government began to persecute Rapp's followers, he decided to move the entire group to the United States. The initial move scattered the followers and reduced Rapp's original group of 12,000 to many fewer persons. In 1804, Rapp was able to secure a large tract of land in Pennsylvania and started his first commune. This first commune, 'Harmonie', (Harmony), Butler County, Pennsylvania, soon grew to a population of about 800, and was highly profitable. At Harmony, the Harmony Society was created and its members contracted to hold all property in common, to submit to spiritual and material leadership by Rapp and associates, and adopted the celibate lifestyle. In 1814, the first town was sold to Mennonites for 10 times the amount originally paid for the land, and the entire commune moved out west to Indiana where their new town was also known as Harmony. Ten years after the move to Indiana the commune moved again, this time it returned to Pennsylvania and named their town 'Ökonomie', Economy. The Indiana settlement was sold to Robert Owen, at which point it was renamed New Harmony, Indiana. George Rapp lived out his remaining days in the town of Economy, Pennsylvania, until August 7, 1847, when he died at the age of 89. The commune ultimately failed because the policy of celibacy prevented new members from within, and the majority of the outside world had no desire to give up so much to live in a commune. The society was formally dissolved in 1906. Today, many of their remaining buildings are preserved and open to visitors. The entire village was designated as a National Historic Landmark District in 1965.

He was the eldest legitimate son of Mōri Motonari. Life Born in Tajihi, Aki Province, Takamoto was sent at the age of 14 to Suō Province as a hostage of Ōuchi Yoshitaka. This was done to ensure his father's loyalties to Ōuchi. He was allowed to return home in 1540, three years later, to the Mōri castle of Yoshida Kōriyama. In 1555, Sue Harukata, one of Ōuchi's vassals, staged a coup and forced Ōuchi Yoshitaka to commit suicide. He was then attacked by Mōri Takamoto and his father, and was defeated in the battle of Miyajima. The Mōri, defeating the Sue/Ōuchi forces, thus rose to power in the Chūgoku region (the western area of Honshū), and would remain a powerful and influential faction for much of the rest of the 16th century. Upon his father's retirement two years later, Takamoto inherited formal leadership of the family, but his father Motonari continued to wield actual control over the clan's affairs. When Ōuchi Yoshinaga died that same year (1557), the Mōri saw an opportunity to seize the Ōuchi clan lands; they had to consider, however, the Ōtomo clan to the west and the Amago clan to the north who entertained similar ideas. Takamoto gained a considerable boost to his power, however, in 1560–1563, when he was appointed by shōgun Ashikaga Yoshiteru as Governor (shugo) of Aki, Nagato, Suō and Bitchū Provinces. Amago Haruhisa died suddenly in 1560, and Ōtomo Sōrin began to devote significant resources to attacking the Amago territory. At the advice or orders of his father, Takamoto seized the opportunity to attack the Ōuchi territory. He was leading the Mōri armies through Bingo Province when, on September 18, 1563, he suddenly died of poisoned food at the age of 41 (or, the first day, ninth month, of the year Eiroku-6, by the Japanese calendar). Historians have since identified Wachi Saneharu, a local Bingo samurai, of committing the deed. Mōri Motonari accused a number of samurai of conspiring in the assassination, and forced them to commit seppuku. Takamoto's son Mōri Terumoto was selected as his heir, but Motonari continued to wield the true power.

Lewis Weston Dillwyn became a partner in 1802 and sole owner when George Haynes left the pottery in 1810. In 1811 Dillwyn took T.& J.

Lewis Llewelyn Dillwyn (Lewis Weston Dillwyn's son) ran the pottery from 1836. He bought out the neighbouring Glamorgan Pottery in 1838. Many of the redundant staff went on to help found the South Wales Pottery at Llanelli, the competition from which, played a part in the ultimate demise of the Cambrian Pottery in 1870. Through its history, the Cambrian employed some notable artists, such as Thomas Baxter, Thomas Pardoe, William Pollard, Thomas Rothwell (1740-1807) and William Weston Young.

He was born in Groß- Dölzig, near Leipzig in Saxony, but spent the later part of his life in Bayreuth. He wrote tuneful music which is still played today on lute and guitar. Much of this music survives in the Bavarian State Library, Munich. He received his first musical instruction in the village of Knauthain, the native home of Johann Christian Weyrauch. Weyrauch was a pupil of Johann Sebastian Bach and transcriber of works by Bach for the lute. In 1713 Falckenhagen is mentioned as \\"gifted in literature and music,\\" and in 1715 as \\"Musician and footman of the young Lord of Dieskau.\\" The Dieskaus were a family for whom J.S. Bach later wrote the Bauernkantate in Merseburg. Falckenhagen stayed in Merseburg with the Dieskaus from about 1715, until in 1719 he succeeded Johann Graf in the position of Saxe Court lutenist. Falckenhagen attended Leipzig University from 1719 to 1720. It has been suggested that Falckenhagen also studied with Johann Jakob Graf, a pupil of Sylvius Leopold Weiss (1686-1750), and later with Weiss himself. Like many of his contemporaries, Falckenhagen travelled from court to court most of his life (Weissenfels, 1720-1727; Jena and Weimar (1729-1732)), eventually settling in Bayreuth, where he won the favour of Wilhelmine of Prussia, Margravine of Bayreuth, in 1734. Wilhelmine was a lutenist and sister of Frederick the Great; she invited him to be the court lutenist at Bayreuth. Falckenhagen held this position until his death in 1754. Falckenhagen's music is representative of the final flowering of 18th- century lute music in Germany.

It was one of the earliest phased array radars. AN/SPG-59 was intended to offer search, track and guidance from a single radar system and antenna as part of the Typhon combat system. Paired with the new Typhon missile, the system was to provide wide-area air defense out to about from suitable anti-aircraft cruisers. Both the radar and missile proved to be well beyond the state of the art of the era, and the project was eventually canceled in December 1963.Dranidis, Dimitris V. Shipboard Phased-Array Radars. Waypoint Magazine. February 2003. (Written to support wargames, but informative.) The Typhon Combat System The Typhon/SPG-59 started as a response to the introduction of sea-skimming anti-ship missiles into service with Soviet Naval Aviation groups. First-generation missile systems like Talos and Terrier used a combination of beam riding and semi-active radar homing (SARH) that required a special targeting radar to illuminate the target through the entire interception. Typical installations included either two or four such illumination radars, which limited the number of simultaneous interceptions. Facing volleys of missiles such systems could easily be overwhelmed. Adding additional radars was possible, but difficult to arrange as the radars were fairly large and required a clear view of the sky, limiting the number of suitable locations. This led to a \\"specification convergence\\"; since there could only be a small number of radars, the missile receivers were built to tune in only a small number of potential \\"channels\\". That meant that increasing the number of radars would also require the missiles to be updated as well. System Characteristics The AN/SPG-59 avoided this problem by acting as both the search and illumination radar. This reduced the problem of siting, as there needed to be only one radar on the ship, albeit a very large one. The Typhon missiles also helped solve this problem, switching from semi- active radar homing, and beam riding to tracking by a track-via-missile system. In this system the receiver on the missile is a wide-band receiver, and forwards its received signals back to the ship. The ship's on-board computers then calculate the interception course and forward it back to the missile from an omni-directional antenna. This is similar to the older command guidance system, but avoids the inaccuracies of that system by locating the receiver on the missile, which is closer to the target and therefore sees a stronger signal. Although this system required the missiles to be able to tune in a number of command radio channels, these are generally much simpler and smaller than radar receivers, allowing a much larger number of channels to be supported. Development Problems Development of the radar suffered from multiple problems from its start. The phased array radar required a very large number of individual broadcaster elements which proved to be unreliable and very expensive. Additionally, the power requirements of the system were so huge that only nuclear-powered ships could provide the necessary power to operate the system. Although such ships were then under construction, they were politically controversial. The radar was canceled in December 1963, because of mounting technical problems and being considerably over budget. Typhon Test Vessel In November 1962 was towed to Baltimore, Maryland for installation of the Typhon Weapon Control System, including the AN/SPG-59. The conversion was completed early in 1964, and Norton Sound was recommissioned 20 June 1964 to continue tasks in weapons research. Baltimore was designated homeport for Norton Sound, and for several months she operated in Chesapeake Bay, evaluating the Typhon System. Assigned to Port Hueneme, California in July 1965, she arrived there the last day of that month. During a three-month stay at Long Beach Naval Shipyard commencing 15 July 1966, all Typhon equipment was removed following discontinuance of the system.United States Navy.

The film is about Dave Speed, a bumbling Miami police officer who gains superpowers through an accidental nuclear exposure. The film stars Terence Hill and Ernest Borgnine. Plot The story starts as a retrospective, as police officer Dave Speed faces his fourth execution attempt (this time by the electric chair) for the alleged murder of his superior and friend, Sergeant Willy Dunlop. While taking his last walk once more, Dave reminisces about how this all got started. Coming fresh from the police academy, Dave is sent to deliver a parking ticket to the member of a tiny Indian village in the Florida Everglades. Unbeknownst to him, the U.S. government and NASA are preparing to conduct a secret radiation experiment in the town by firing a nuclear missile loaded with red plutonium into the village (which had long since been evacuated). Dave, the only person in the village, is hit by the radiation but does not die, and returns to civilization. His tale of having been close to the explosion is marveled at by most, but dismissed by Dunlop. As time passes, Dave discovers that he has picked up a wide range of superpowers, including super reflexes and speed, endurance, telekinesis, precognition, hypnotism, and the ability to survive a window drop from the 23rd story of a building unscathed. What is more puzzling is that sometimes his powers suddenly fail to work, without any apparent reason. But even with that limitation, his powers come as an advantage when counterfeit money is found throughout the city. The masterminds behind this scheme are a local businessman named Torpedo and his mistress Rosy Labouche, a former actress on whom Dunlop has a serious crush. Right now, however, Dave is less a danger to them than an old retired magician named Silvius, who had inadvertently discovered how Torpedo transports his counterfeit money and now finds himself chased by Torpedo's henchmen. As it turns out, Silvius had also gained superpowers the same way Dave did, and reveals his secret to the young policeman as he flees the city: Whenever he sees the color he saw at the explosion (namely, red), his power is nullified for as long as he observes it. Dave reveals his secret to Dunlop and Evelyn, who are less than ecstatic about it. While Dunlop points out that Dave's precognitive abilities, which helped uncover Torpedo's scam, is unlikely to be admitted as evidence in court, Evelyn is not overjoyed at having a too-perfect man in the house. One night, Dave and Dunlop proceed to Torpedo's clubhouse, where Dave has Dunlop dance with Rosie (with some hypnotic encouragement) while he poses as a corrupt cop who wants a share of the winnings. By using his hypnotic powers on Torpedo, he gets the gangster to blab out the location of his printing facility: the fishing trawler Barracuda. But in the meantime, Dunlop inadvertently tells Rosie about Dave's powers and weaknesses in order to impress her. Once the information is obtained, Dave and Dunlop proceed out to sea to find the Barracuda. Going aboard alone, Dunlop finds the printing press and the latest stash of money, but is knocked out by Torpedo's men, who lock him into a freezer and then sink the trawler to destroy the evidence. Upon his return to police headquarters, Dave is arrested following a trumped- up accusation by Rosie, who also makes sure that he keeps seeing something red to prevent his escape from prison, though she could not do so during the first three execution attempts. Despite Rosie's last-ditch attempt to ensure Dave's demise by having a bouquet of red roses left in the execution chamber, Dave finally manages to escape prison and jumps into the sea, where he promptly swims to the Barracuda. Once he finds Dunlop aboard, alive but frozen stiff, he uses a borrowed piece of bubblegum to create a balloon, and both men rise out of the ocean and float back to the city. Having heard of Dave's escape, Torpedo and Rosie prepare to flee with Evelyn as their hostage. Dave manages to intercept them by jumping onto their amphibian aircraft and redirecting it to an airfield where the police are waiting. Finally convinced of the validity of Dave's powers, Dunlop overconfidently jumps off the balloon while Dave races to save him with Rosie's red feather boa wrapped around his legs. At the last instant, he manages to catch Dunlop (though in the process they wind up plunging through the earth and straight up to China), and both return safe and sound to prepare for Dave's and Evelyn's wedding. However, Evelyn, still reluctant to have a super-powered husband, has decided to have the last word in the matter by having her hair dyed red.

Since the mid-1970s, Corbucci was known as one of Italy's most successful filmmakers within the field of comedy. The film was designed for an American audience and shot on location in Miami. Release Super Fuzz was released in Italy in 1980. The film was shown in heavy rotation on HBO in the early 1980s. Reception In contemporary reviews, Super Fuzz received a negative review in Variety who called the film \\"miscast to the hilt\\" and \\"all sheer shab both artistically and technically. Within a minute of the opening title, somebody belches and the tone is set for the remainder.\\" The New York Times stated that the film had Corbucci and his crew \\"have joined forces to provide employment for several oldtime performers. That is the film's major accomplishment.\\" and that there was only one funny gag within the film. From retrospective reviews, AllMovie found that Super Fuzz \\"still holds up as a fun, lightweight, and immensely entertaining way to spend a Saturday night with few friends.\\" The review concluded that Super Fuzz \\"can be enjoyed by equally by both adults who appreciate a mindless retro comedy, or children who enjoy such simple pleasures as the [sight] of Borgnine dancing atop a giant, floating bubble-gum balloon.\\" See also * List of Italian films of 1980  Footnotes  =References= External links  1980 films 1980s crime comedy films Italian comedy films Italian superhero films Italian films Films directed by Sergio Corbucci 1980s buddy cop films Italian crime comedy films 1980s science fiction comedy films 1980s police comedy films Superhero comedy films Films set in Miami Films shot in Miami Film superheroes 1980s superhero films 1980 comedy films ","title":"Super Fuzz"},{"id":"9689954","text":"Jason R.

In humans this protein is encoded by the SORD gene. Sorbitol dehydrogenase is an enzyme in carbohydrate metabolism converting sorbitol, the sugar alcohol form of glucose, into fructose. Together with aldose reductase, it provides a way for the body to produce fructose from glucose without using ATP. Sorbitol dehydrogenase uses NAD+ as a cofactor; its reaction is sorbitol + NAD+ \\\\--> fructose + NADH + H+. A zinc ion is also involved in catalysis. Organs that use it most frequently include the liver and seminal vesicle; it is found in all kinds of organisms from bacteria to humans. A secondary use is the metabolism of dietary sorbitol, though sorbitol is known not to be absorbed as well in the intestine as its related compounds glucose and fructose, and is usually found in quite small amounts in the diet (except when used as an artificial sweetener). Structure The structure of human sorbitol dehydrogenase was determined through crystallization experiments and X-ray diffraction (with a resolution of 2.20 Å). The method used for crystallization was “Vapor Diffusion, Hanging Drop” at pH 6.2 and at a temperature of 295.0 K. Sorbitol dehydrogenase consists of four identical chains (A, B, C, D), each of which being 31% helical (14 helices) and 26% beta sheet (23 strands).; MolProbity Ramachandran analysis was conducted by Lovell, Davis, et al. The results were that 97.1% of all residues were in favored regions and 100.0% of all residues were in allowed regions, with no outliers. All four chains have 356 residues each and a catalytic site. The catalytic sites contain both a serine and a histidine residue, which are hydrophilic sidechains. The residues require NAD+ and a zinc ion to be present for catalytic activity. Sorbitol dehydrogenase belongs to the oxidoreductase family, which means that it helps catalyze oxidation reduction reactions. As stated above, the enzyme helps in the pathway of converting glucose into fructose. Subunit interactions in SDH The interactions between subunits forming a tetramer in SDH is determined by non-covalent interaction. These non-covalent interactions consists of an hydrophobic effect, hydrogen bonds, and electrostatic interactions between the four identical subunits. For homotetrameric proteins such as SDH, the structure is believed to have evolved going from a monomeric to a dimeric and finally toward a tetrameric structure in evolution. The SDH proteins have a close evolutionary relationship with alcohol dehydrogenase, which also belongs to the protein superfamily of medium-chain dehydrogenase/reductase enzymes (MDRs). Mammalian ADHs are all dimeric enzymes but certain bacterial ADHs also share a tetrameric quaternary structure. SDH from silver leaf whitefly and that from yeast ADH1 both lack a structural zinc site and share a tetrameric quaternary structure, thus showing a close evolutionary relationship from a structural viewpoint between the two classes of proteins (ADH and SDH). The general binding process in SDH is described by the gain in free energy, which can be determined from the rate of association and dissociation between subunits. Assembly of the four subunits (A,B,C and D) in SDH A hydrogen-bonding network between subunits has been shown to be important for the stability of the tetrameric quaternary protein structure. For example, a study of SDH that used diverse methods such as protein sequence alignments, structural comparisons, energy calculations, gelfiltration experiments, and enzyme kinetics experiments could reveal an important hydrogen-bonding network that stabilizes the tetrameric quaternary structure in mammalian SDH. Clinical significance In tissues where sorbitol dehydrogenase is low or absent, such as in the retina, lens, kidney, and nerve cells, sorbitol can accumulate under conditions of hyperglycemia. In uncontrolled diabetes, large amounts of glucose enter these tissues and is then converted to sorbitol by aldose reductase. Sorbitol then accumulates, causing water to be drawn into the cell due to the increased osmotic pressure, impairing tissue function. Retinopathy, cataract formation, nephropathy, and peripheral neuropathy seen in diabetes are partly due to this phenomenon.

It was produced and directed by George Mendeluk and co-produced by John Ryan from a screenplay by Richard Murphy and Charles Templeton, based on Templeton's 1977 novel of the same name. The original music is by Nash the Slash and Paul Zaza and the cinematography by Mike Molloy. The film was made by Presidential Films and Sefel Films and distributed by Crown International Pictures. Plot During a state visit to Canada, President Adam Scott (Hal Holbrook) is warned by Secret Service agent Jerry O'Connor (William Shatner) about a potential threat to his life. Scott ignores O'Connor's warning and is consequently abducted (while walking through Nathan Phillips Square in Toronto) by South American terrorist Roberto Assanti (Miguel Fernandes) and his female accomplice. They demand $100 million in diamonds along with two airplanes as ransom for the president's safe return. While Scott is being held captive in an armored truck booby-trap with high explosives timed to detonate at midnight, O'Connor must find a way into the truck to rescue him before that happens, while also contending with a turf war between various U.S. federal law enforcement agencies and the political ambitions of the U.S. vice president, Ethan Richards (Van Johnson). Agent O'Connor eventually gets one of Assanti's terrorist group members to turn on Assanti, which caused Assanti's sister to die. O'Connor learns Assanti's plan for the president and develops a plan to save the President by going through the engine and firewall with a cutting torch.

The inevitable cross-cutting, from fanatical terrorists to the presidential cavalcade, and later, from a nearly unflappable security man (William Shatner) in Toronto, is well handed.\\"  Critical reception  The film received lukewarm ratings overall. It received a lot of talk from the New York Post and the Newark Star Ledger as well as outstanding reviews from Bergen Records and other newspaper organizations. Unlike Bergen Records and other newspapers, Janet Maslin, from The New York Times, disagreed with the reviews because she thought the plot was not fresh enough to be frightening and the characters were not brave enough to do anything new. Chris Lowry, a writer for Film Reviews, found George Mendeluk's directing uninspiring and Richard Murphy's screenplay mediocre for an action movie. Lowry stated, \\"the film disorients and disturbs the audience at the outset\\" since the subject of kidnapping a president isn't a funny concept in general.

The death occurred in their Manhattan apartment on July 7, 1985. Bierenbaum, a licensed pilot, took a two-hour flight in a Cessna 172 from Essex County, New Jersey over the Atlantic Ocean on the day that Gail had vanished. He failed to mention this fact to authorities during their initial questioning. The prosecution stated that Bierenbaum discarded his wife's dismembered body in the ocean. The victim's torso was first thought to be found in 1989 but after exhuming the torso, DNA testing in 1999 proved it was not Gail's. Despite eyewitness testimony for the defense who stated he saw the victim in a Manhattan bagel shop during the time that Bierenbaum took his airplane flight, Bierenbaum was convicted and sentenced to twenty years to life in prison in New York. He appealed, but the conviction was upheld in the New York State Supreme Court, Appellate Division in 2002. Bierenbaum is currently incarcerated in New York State and is not eligible for parole until October 2020. His offender number is 00-A-7114. Notoriety The Bierenbaum case was the subject of the 2001 New York Times non-fiction bestseller book The Surgeon's Wife. It was also one of the stories in the television show Dominick Dunne: Power, Privilege, & Justice on Court TV. In the ISBN database, the summary of the book includes:The Surgeon's Wife, by Kiernan Crowley, published by St. Martin's True Crime Library, Paperback; 2001-09-17, . Bierenbaum has been referred to as The Lady Killer. It has been said in Vanity Fair and New York magazine that women still find him attractive, even though he has been convicted of murdering his first wife. Legal precedent People of the State of New York v. Robert Bierenbaum was a landmark decision, setting precedent on upholding physician-patient privilege even when a Tarasoff warning is invoked: \\"Neither a psychiatrist issuing a Tarasoff warning nor a patient telling his friends he's in treatment constitutes a waiver of a patient's psychiatrist-patient privilege.\\" The case was also used as precedent in the California case of Glyn Scharf, where Scharf was charged with murdering his wife, even though the victim's body was never found. Medical status As a result of the New York state Medical Licensing Board's misconduct review following the court case, Bierenbaum surrendered his License to Practice medicine in November, 2000. In September 2002, New Jersey also revoked his medical practice license. In popular culture The Robert Bierenbaum case was featured by the television show Law and Order: Criminal Intent, in an episode entitled \\"The Good Doctor\\", which originally aired in November, 2001, and in an episode of the French series Paris enquêtes criminelles. Lisa DePaulo profiled the Bierenbaum case in her story, \\"Intimations of Murder\\" published in the September 2000 issue of Vanity Fair magazine. The case was featured in an episode of OWN series 'Devil You Know'.

Besides its communist base, the uprising was also supported by agrarians and anarchists. The uprising's goal was the \\"establishment of a government of workers and peasants\\" in Bulgaria. Background and organization The Bulgarian Communist Party leaders took up a neutral position on the 9 June coup d'état and the subsequent June Uprising because it regarded what was happening in the country as \\"struggle for power between the urban and rural bourgeoisie\\". This position was provoked by the belief of the party's older leaders, headed by Dimitar Blagoev and Todor Lukanov, that there were no ripe conditions for a revolution in Bulgaria yet. At the same time, a number of party organizations in the country proclaimed their support for counteraction to the coup d'état, with some even joining the June Uprising. Bulgarian Comintern General Secretary Vasil Kolarov sent a telegram to the BCP (Narrow Socialists) leadership, advising them to \\"act in determination, even together with Stamboliyski\\". However, no common BCP measures in support of the June Uprising were taken in the long run. In early August 1923, a plenary session of the BCP (Narrow Socialists) Central Committee was called. During the session, the young and radical party activists, headed by Georgi Dimitrov and Vasil Kolarov, backed by the Comintern, prevailed in support of the organization of a new uprising. The government took precautions to prevent the uprising, arresting more than 2,000 noted BCP activists on 12 September 1923. As a reaction to the arrests, the uprising broke out without plan in isolated areas, initially around Kazanlak. On 20 September, a BCP Central Committee meeting was held, during which a decision was reached to proclaim the uprising on the eve of 23 September, despite opposition by the supporters of legal activity. The plan involved a mass uprising around Vratsa followed by the formation of an organized militia which would capture the capital Sofia. Outbreak Insurrectionary activity was first started by the communists in the village of Maglizh near Kazanlak on the eve of 14 September. Their actions were backed by the BCP branch in Golyamo Dryanovo. The rebels seized the two villages, but received no support from the neighbouring branches, which decided to wait until the official proclamation of the uprising. Several hours after the outbreak in Maglizh, they withdrew into the mountains. On 12 September, a campaign committee was set up in Stara Zagora, which reached a decision that the region should be stirred up to revolt on the eve of 20 September. The uprising broke out in Stara Zagora at the arranged time, but was quickly suppressed by government forces. Nova Zagora revolted at the same time, with the city and the whole region being quickly seized by the rebels. The villages around Chirpan also revolted on the eve of 20 September and an unsuccessful attempt to capture the city was undertaken. The lack of an organized uprising around Burgas allowed the government to mobilize strong forces and crush the uprising around Stara Zagora. Particularly hard battles were fought at Maglizh, Enina and Shipka. Uprising in northwestern Bulgaria Aleksandar Tsankov's government, not enjoying wide popular support but relying on the army, declared martial law on 22 September and mobilized sizable forces to suppress the uprising. Groups of volunteers organized in shpitskomandi (paramilitary formations) also fought against the rebels. In support of the cavalry platoon in Lom, which was encircled by the rebels, the government sent relief from Vidin. The rebel forces were aided by one cannon operated by Father Andrey, but it failed to tip the balance in their advantage. After three days of small-scale urban warfare, the government restored control over Lom. At the morning of 25 September, rebels under Gavril Genov attacked the government troops heading to Ferdinand at Boychinovtsi and defeated them following a bitter fight. The victory raised their morale and they advanced to Vratsa, but were driven back. Rebel forces were also routed at Brusartsi by troops garrisoned at Vidin. The resistance of the rebels in the Petrohan Pass was also broken around the same time, and numerous heavily armed military units advanced to Ferdinand and Berkovitsa. In order to save the rebels from total extermination, the leaders issued an order to retreat to Yugoslavia. On 27 September, the government forces entered Ferdinand. On 28 September and 29 September, there were only occasional fights between the retreating rebels and the army. Uprising elsewhere In Plovdiv and the vicinity, an uprising practically did not break out. Only a handful of villages revolted around Pazardzhik, among which Muhovo and Lesichevo. On 24 September, the rebels attempted an unsuccessful attack of Saranbey. Following the departure of Dimitrov and Kolarov for the northwest, there were no preparations for the uprising in Sofia. The reason was that the Sofia branch of the BCP was dominated by supporters of legal action against Tsankov's government. Ultimately, a revolutionary committee was set up, consisting of Anton Ivanov, Dimitar Ginchev and Todor Atanasov, but it was uncovered and its members were arrested as early as 21 September. The lack of an uprising in Sofia allowed the government to use its best military units from Sofia to crush the uprising in other parts of the country. There was small-scale insurrection around Ihtiman and Samokov, as well as in individual villages in the vicinity of Sofia and Pirdop. Ihtiman and Kostenets were captured, but the rebels were quickly crushed by government detachments from Sofia. Before the beginning of the uprising, BCP and the Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization (IMRO) concluded an agreement, according to which BCP would not stir up the population in Pirin whereas IMRO would not obstruct the uprising's organization in other parts of the country. In practice, however, neither side respected the agreement, as the area around Razlog revolted and IMRO joined the conflict on the side of the government. Following short fights, the rebels withdrew into the mountains. Individual villages around Veliko Tarnovo, Shumen and Burgas also joined the uprising. Consequences Arrested rebels in Vratsa Following the suppression, the government, shpitskomandi and IMRO detachments committed atrocities against the civil population in the regions that revolted, with particularly large atrocities around the town of Ferdinand. Active communists and agrarians were killed, including some which did not take part in the September Uprising. According to a book published for the limited use of the nomenklatura by the BCP in 1972, entitled \\"Stars in the Centuries\\" the total number of casualties is 841Музей на революционното движение в България, Звезди във вековете, Издателство на Българската комунистическа партия, София, 1972, 791 стр. ,this is mostly in line with researches made after the fall of the Communist regime. Historiography during the communist rule of Bulgaria often considerably exaggerated the figures with political purposes. After the crushing of the uprising, its leaders Georgi Dimitrov and Vasil Kolarov fled to Yugoslavia and then to the Soviet Union. Some of the rebels remained in the country and acted as isolated militia in the mountains, other emigrated to Yugoslavia. In the Bulgarian communist historiography, Tsankov's government was regarded fascist and the September Uprising was called \\"the first anti-fascist uprising\\". In art Communist- era memorial of the September Uprising in Pazardzhik The September Uprising and the atrocities during its suppression provoked a powerful reaction among the Bulgarian intellectuals of the time. Among the more famous works dedicated to the uprising are the poem Septemvri by Geo Milev, the novel Horo by Anton Strashimirov and the painting Septemvri 1923 by Ivan Milev. Others include the books of poetry Proleten vyatar (Spring Wind) by Nikola Furnadzhiev and Zhertveni kladi (Sacrificial Stakes) by Asen Raztsvetnikov. The latter, together with Angel Karaliychev, author of the book Razh (Rye), were later classed as the \\"September generation of writers\\". Between 1944 and 1979, memorials of the uprising were erected in a number of places, the locals of which participated in it.

He was a Brigadier General in the Union Army during the American Civil War and was awarded the honorary grade of brevet Major General.Eicher 2001, p. 106. During the Civil War, Andrews served in a number of important commands, first as the Colonel of the 2nd Massachusetts, a regiment which saw heavy action in the Battles of Cedar Mountain and Antietam, among other actions. Mentored by Maj. Gen. Nathaniel Prentice Banks, Andrews became part of Banks's staff and was assigned several command roles in the Army Department of the Gulf during the later years of the war.Bowen 1889, p. 878. After the war, Andrews pursued a variety of vocations, including service as a United States Marshal, before returning to the United States Military Academy at West Point as a professor until his retirement.Heidler 2000, p. 52. Early career George Andrews was born in Bridgewater, Massachusetts, son of Manasseh and Harriet Leonard Andrews. In 1851, Andrews graduated first in his class from the United States Military Academy at West Point. After graduating, he was assigned to the Army Corps of Engineers with the rank of brevet second lieutenant. From 1851 to 1854, he served as assistant to Lt. Col. Sylvanus Thayer who was in command of the construction of Fort Warren in Boston harbor. From 1854 to 1855, he was assistant professor of engineering at West Point. He then resigned from the service and was engaged in civil engineering work until the beginning of the Civil War. Some sources have confused General Andrews with Colonel George Lippitt Andrews, U.S. Army (as both are George L. Andrews). Civil War =2nd Massachusetts= At the start of the Civil War, Andrews assisted with the organization of the 2nd Regiment Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry of which he was appointed lieutenant colonel. The 2nd Massachusetts was attached in July 1861 to the Army Department of the Shenandoah commanded by Maj. Gen. Nathaniel Banks. During 1861, they took part in minor operations in the vicinity of Harpers Ferry, Virginia.Bowen 1889, p. 115. In the spring of 1862, Banks's forces were confronted by Lt. Gen. Thomas Jackson's Confederate forces in a series of battles known as Jackson's Valley Campaign. In May 1862, Andrews succeeded Col. George Henry Gordon as commander of the 2nd Massachusetts and led the regiment during the First Battle of Winchester. On June 13, 1862, Andrews was promoted to colonel. Andrews remained in command of the 2nd Massachusetts until October 2, 1862, during which time he led the regiment in two more major battles. On August 9, 1862, Banks's forces again engaged Jackson, and were again defeated, in the Battle of Cedar Mountain. In early September, Banks was reassigned to the defenses of Washington and his forces were re-organized, becoming the XII Corps in the Army of the Potomac, and took part in the Maryland Campaign.Bowen 1889, p. 121. During this campaign, Andrews led the 2nd Massachusetts in the Battle of Antietam on September 17, 1862. The regiment took part in the assaults on the Confederate position through the infamous Cornfield and suffered heavy casualties before being forced to make an orderly retreat.Sears 1983, pp. 230-231. In October 1862, Andrews was elevated to brigade command and briefly commanded the 2nd Brigade, 1st Division of the XII Corps, then the 4th Brigade of the same division while the Army of the Potomac re-grouped in the aftermath of the Maryland Campaign. =New Orleans expedition= On October 26, 1862, Andrews was assigned to Maj. Gen. Banks's expedition to New Orleans and was promoted to brigadier general on November 9, 1862. As a key member of Banks's staff, Andrews spent the winter of 1862–1863 in New York City, playing a major role in organization and planning the expedition. Banks replaced Maj. Gen. Benjamin Butler as commander of the Department of the Gulf and intended to move north from New Orleans with a large force to assist in taking control of the Mississippi River.Heidler 2000, p. 175. Andrews reached New Orleans with the last detachment of new troops on February 11, 1863. He was briefly placed in command of the 1st Brigade, 3rd Division, XIX Corps but less than a month later, in March 1863, Andrews was appointed chief of staff to Maj. Gen. Banks. In this capacity, Andrews assisted in organizing the Siege of Port Hudson, a costly operation consisting of several naval and land assaults. Confederate forces in Port Hudson, the last Confederate stronghold on the Mississippi River, ultimately surrendered on July 9, 1863 after hearing of the surrender of Vicksburg, Mississippi. Andrews personally accepted the sword of the Confederate commander of Port Hudson during the formal surrender and returned it to him as a compliment to their bravery.Cunningham 1994, p. 119. =District of Baton Rouge and Port Hudson= The day after the fall of Port Hudson, Andrews was assigned to organize the African-American troops in the Army of the Gulf, forming the Corps d'Afrique. Andrews was also placed in command of the Army District of Baton Rouge and Port Hudson. He retained command of the district and the Corps d'Afrique until February 1865. To recruit African-Americans, Andrews dispatched soldiers to plantations throughout his district to enlist freed slaves. On February 27, Andrews was relieved from command of the District of Baton Rouge and Port Hudson and reported to New Orleans where he was appointed provost marshal general for the Department of the Gulf. He served as an aide to Maj. Gen. Edward Canby during the Siege of Mobile Campaign which forced the surrender of the last Confederate stronghold on the Gulf coast. For his service during this campaign, Andrews was given a commendation by Canby. After the Confederacy's surrender in April 1865, Andrews spent a portion of the summer as Maj. Gen. Canby's chief of staff, then resigned his commission on August 24, 1865. On January 13, 1866, President Andrew Johnson nominated Andrews to the honorary grade of brevet major general, United States Volunteers, to rank from March 26, 1865 and the United States Senate confirmed the award on March 12, 1866.Eicher 2001, p. 710. Post-war career After the Civil War, Andrews spent two years as a planter in Mississippi. He then moved back to Massachusetts and was a United States marshal from 1867 to 1871. He was a professor of French at West Point from 1871 to 1882, and of modern languages from 1882 until his retirement in 1892. Fort Andrews, a fortification on Peddocks Island in Boston Harbor, was named after him. Constructed in 1897, the fort held the largest garrison of any fortification in Boston Harbor in the early 20th century (two thousand troops). It was abandoned by the U.S. Army in 1946 and is currently in ruins.Kales, 112.

From the middle of the 20th century, research has provided increasing knowledge and answered many questions about sleep-wake functioning. The rapidly evolving field has become a recognized medical subspecialty in some countries. Dental sleep medicine also qualifies for board certification in some countries. Properly organized, minimum 12-month, postgraduate training programs are still being defined in the United States. In some countries, the sleep researchers and the physicians who treat patients may be the same people. The first sleep clinics in the United States were established in the 1970s by interested physicians and technicians; the study, diagnosis and treatment of obstructive sleep apnea were their first tasks. As late as 1999, virtually any American physician, with no specific training in sleep medicine, could open a sleep laboratory. Disorders and disturbances of sleep are widespread and can have significant consequences for affected individuals as well as economic and other consequences for society. The US National Transportation Safety Board has, according to Dr. Charles Czeisler, member of the Institute of Medicine and Director of the Harvard University Medical School Division of Sleep Medicine at Brigham and Women's Hospital, discovered that the leading cause (31%) of fatal-to-the-driver heavy truck crashes is fatigue related, (though rarely associated directly with sleep disorders, such as sleep apnea), with drugs and alcohol as the number two cause (29%). Sleep deprivation has also been a significant factor in dramatic accidents, such as the Exxon Valdez oil spill, the nuclear incidents at Chernobyl and Three Mile Island and the explosion of the space shuttle Challenger. Scope and classification Competence in sleep medicine requires an understanding of a plethora of very diverse disorders, many of which present with similar symptoms such as excessive daytime sleepiness, which, in the absence of volitional sleep deprivation, \\"is almost inevitably caused by an identifiable and treatable sleep disorder,\\" such as sleep apnea, narcolepsy, idiopathic hypersomnia, Kleine-Levin syndrome, menstrual-related hypersomnia, idiopathic recurrent stupor, or circadian rhythm disturbances. Another common complaint is insomnia, a set of symptoms that can have many causes, physical and mental. Management in the varying situations differs greatly and cannot be undertaken without a correct diagnosis. ICSD, The International Classification of Sleep Disorders, was restructured in 1990, in relation to its predecessor, to include only one code for each diagnostic entry and to classify disorders by pathophysiologic mechanism, as far as possible, rather than by primary complaint. Training in sleep medicine is multidisciplinary, and the present structure was chosen to encourage a multidisciplinary approach to diagnosis. Sleep disorders often do not fit neatly into traditional classification; differential diagnoses cross medical systems. Minor revisions and updates to the ICSD were made in 1997 and in following years. The present classification system in fact follows the groupings suggested by Nathaniel Kleitman, the \\"father of sleep research,\\" in his seminal 1939 book Sleep and Wakefulness. The revised ICSD, ICSD-R, placed the primary sleep disorders in the subgroups (1) dyssomnias, which include those that produce complaints of insomnia or excessive sleepiness, and (2) the parasomnias, which do not produce those primary complaints but intrude into or occur during sleep. A further subdivision of the dyssomnias preserves the integrity of circadian rhythm sleep disorders, as was mandated by about 200 doctors and researchers from all over the world who participated in the process between 1985–1990. The last two subgroups were (3) the medical or psychiatric sleep disorder section and (4) the proposed new disorders section. The authors found the heading \\"medical or psychiatric\\" less than ideal but better than the alternative \\"organic or non- organic,\\" which seemed more likely to change in the future. Detailed reporting schemes aimed to provide data for further research. A second edition, called ICSD-2, was published in 2005. MeSH, Medical Subject Headings, a service of the US National Library of Medicine and the National Institutes of Health, uses similar broad categories: (1) dyssomnias, including narcolepsy, apnea, and the circadian rhythm sleep disorders, (2) parasomnias, which include, among others, bruxism (tooth-grinding), sleepwalking and bedwetting, and (3) sleep disorders caused by medical or psychiatric conditions. The system used produces \\"trees,\\" approaching each diagnosis from up to several angles such that each disorder may be known by several codes. DSM-IV-TR, the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, Text Revision, using the same diagnostic codes as the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD), divides sleep disorders into three groups: (1) primary sleep disorders, both the dyssomnias and the parasomnias, presumed to result from an endogenous disturbance in sleep-wake generating or timing mechanisms, (2) those secondary to mental disorders and (3) those related to a general medical condition or substance abuse. Recent thinking opens for a common cause for mood and sleep disorders occurring in the same patient; a 2010 review states that, in humans, \\"single nucleotide polymorphisms in Clock and other clock genes have been associated with depression\\" and that the \\"evidence that mood disorders are associated with disrupted or at least inappropriately timed circadian rhythms suggests that treatment strategies or drugs aimed at restoring 'normal' circadian rhythmicity may be clinically useful.\\" History A 16th-century physician wrote that many laborers dozed off exhausted at the start of each night; sexual intercourse with their wives typically occurring in the watching period, after a recuperative first sleep.page 3 of Anthropologists find that isolated societies without electric light sleep in a variety of patterns; seldom do they resemble our modern habit of sleeping in one single eight-hour bout. Much has been written about dream interpretation, from biblical times to Freud, but sleep itself was historically seen as a passive state of not- awake.Kleitman, Nathaniel (1938, revised 1963, reprinted 1987) Sleep and Wakefulness (Introduction). The University of Chicago Press, Midway Reprints series, The concept of sleep medicine belongs to the second half of the 20th century. Due to the rapidly increasing knowledge about sleep, including the growth of the research field chronobiology from about 1960 and the discoveries of REM sleep (1952–53) and sleep apnea (first described in the medical literature in 1965), the medical importance of sleep was recognized. The medical community began paying more attention than previously to primary sleep disorders, such as sleep apnea, as well as the role and quality of sleep in other conditions. By the 1970s in the US, and in many western nations within the two following decades, clinics and laboratories devoted to the study of sleep and the treatment of its disorders had been founded. Most sleep doctors were primarily concerned with apnea; some were experts in narcolepsy. There was as yet nothing to restrict the use of the title \\"sleep doctor,\\" and a need for standards arose. Basic medical training has paid little attention to sleep problems; according to Benca in her review Diagnosis and Treatment of Chronic Insomnia (2005), most doctors are \\"not well trained with respect to sleep and sleep disorders,\\" and a survey in 1990–91 of 37 American medical schools showed that sleep and sleep disorders were \\"covered\\" in less than two (2) hours of total teaching time, on average. Benca's review cites a 2002 survey by Papp et al. of more than 500 primary care physicians who self-reported their knowledge of sleep disorders as follows: Excellent – 0%; Good – 10%, Fair – 60%; and Poor – 30%. The review of more than 50 studies indicates that both doctors and patients appear reluctant to discuss sleep complaints, in part because of perceptions that treatments for insomnia are ineffective or associated with risks, and: Also, an editorial in the American College of Chest Physicians' (pulmonologists') journal CHEST in 1999 was quite concerned about the Conundrums in Sleep Medicine. The author, then chair of her organization's Sleep Section, asked \\"What is required to set up a sleep laboratory? Money and a building! Anyone can open a sleep laboratory, and it seems that just about everyone is.\\" On the accreditation process for sleep laboratories, she continues: \\"This accreditation, however, is currently not required by most states, or more importantly, by most insurance carriers for reimbursements... There is also an American Board of Sleep Medicine (ABSM) that certifies individuals as sleep specialists. This certification presumably makes those individuals more qualified to run a sleep laboratory; however, the certification is not required to run a laboratory or to read sleep studies.\\" Her concern at the turn of the century was: In the UK, knowledge of sleep medicine and possibilities for diagnosis and treatment seem to lag. Guardian.co.uk quotes the director of the Imperial College Healthcare Sleep Centre: \\"One problem is that there has been relatively little training in sleep medicine in this country – certainly there is no structured training for sleep physicians.\\" The Imperial College Healthcare site shows attention to obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSA) and very few other disorders, specifically not including insomnia. Training and certification =Worldwide= The World Federation of Sleep Research & Sleep Medicine Societies (WFSRSMS) was founded in 1987. As its name implies, members are concerned with basic and clinical research as well as medicine. Member societies in the Americas are the American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM), publisher of the Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine; the Sleep Research Society (SRS), publisher of SLEEP; the Canadian Sleep Society (CSS) and the Federation of Latin American Sleep Societies (FLASS). WFSRSMS promotes both sleep research and physician training and education. =Africa= The Colleges of Medicine of South Africa (CMSA) provide the well-defined specialty Diploma in Sleep Medicine of the College of Neurologists of South Africa: DSM(SA), which was first promulgated by the Health Professions Council in 2007. The newly formed South African Society of Sleep Medicine (SASSM) was launched at its inaugural congress in February 2010. The society's membership is diverse; it includes general practitioners, ENT surgeons, pulmonologists, cardiologists, endocrinologists and psychiatrists. =Asia= WFSRSMS members in Asia include the Australasian Sleep Association (ASA) of New Zealand and Australia and the Asian Sleep Research Society (ASRS), an umbrella organization for the societies of several Asian nations. =Europe= The European Sleep Research Society (ESRS) is a member of the WFSRSMS. The Assembly of National Sleep Societies (ANSS), which includes both medical and scientific organizations from 26 countries as of 2007, is a formal body of the ESRS. The ESRS has published European Accreditation Guidelines for SMCs (Sleep Medicine Centres), the first of several proposed guidelines to coordinate and promote sleep science and medicine in Europe. =United States= Polysomnography (PSG) is a multi-parametric test used as a diagnostic tool in sleep medicine. The American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM), founded in 1978, administered the certification process and sleep medicine examination for doctors until 1990. Its independent daughter entity the American Board of Sleep Medicine (ABSM) was incorporated in 1991 and took over the aforementioned responsibilities. As of 2007, the ABSM ceased administering its examination, as it conceded that an examination process recognized by the American Board of Medical Specialties (ABMS) was advantageous to the field. Candidates who passed the ABSM exam in 1978–2006 retain lifetime certification as Diplomates of that organization. The American Board of Psychiatry and Neurology (ABPN), and the corresponding boards of Internal Medicine, of Pediatrics, and of Otolaryngology (ear, nose and throat, ENT) now administer collectively the Sleep Medicine Certification exam for their members. Each board supervises the required 12 months of formal training for its candidates, while the exam is administered to all of them at the same time in the same place. For the first five years, 2007–2011, during \\"grandfathering,\\" there was a \\"practice pathway\\" for ABSM certified specialists while additional, coordinated requirements were to be added after 2011. The ABPN provides information about the pathways, requirements and the exam on its website. Additionally, there are currently four boards of the American Osteopathic Association Bureau of Osteopathic Specialists that administer Sleep Medicine Certification exams. The American Osteopathic boards of Family Medicine, Internal Medicine, Neurology & Psychiatry, and Ophthalmology & Otolaryngology grant certificates of added qualification to qualified candidate physicians. Sleep medicine is now a recognized subspecialty within anesthesiology, internal medicine, family medicine, pediatrics, otolaryngology, psychiatry and neurology in the US. Certification in Sleep Medicine by the several \\"Member Boards\\" of the ABMS shows that the specialist: Pulmonologists, already subspecialists within internal medicine, may be accepted to sit for the board and be certified in Sleep Medicine after just a six-month fellowship, building on their knowledge of sleep-related breathing problems, rather than the usual twelve-month fellowship required of other specialists. Sleep dentistry (bruxism, snoring and sleep apnea), while not recognized as one of the nine dental specialties, qualifies for board-certification by the American Board of Dental Sleep Medicine (ABDSM). The resulting Diplomate status is recognized by the AASM, and these dentists are organized in the Academy of Dental Sleep Medicine (USA). The qualified dentists collaborate with sleep doctors at accredited sleep centers and can provide several types of oral appliances or upper airway surgery to treat or manage sleep-related breathing disorders as well as tooth-grinding and clenching. Laboratories for sleep-related breathing disorders are accredited by the AASM and are required to follow the Code of Medical Ethics of the American Medical Association. The new and very detailed Standards for Accreditation are available online. Sleep disorder centers, or clinics, are accredited by the same body, whether hospital-based, university- based or \\"freestanding\\"; they are required to provide testing and treatment for all sleep disorders and to have on staff a sleep specialist who has been certified by the American Board of Sleep Medicine and otherwise meet similar standards. Diagnostic methods Pediatric polysomnography The taking of a thorough medical history while keeping in mind alternative diagnoses and the possibility of more than one ailment in the same patient is the first step. Symptoms for very different sleep disorders may be similar and it must be determined whether any psychiatric problems are primary or secondary. The patient history includes previous attempts at treatment and coping and a careful medication review. Differentiation of transient from chronic disorders and primary from secondary ones influences the direction of evaluation and treatment plans. The Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), designed to give an indication of sleepiness and correlated with sleep apnea, or other questionnaires designed to measure excessive daytime sleepiness, are diagnostic tools that can be used repeatedly to measure results of treatment. A sleep diary, also called sleep log or sleep journal, kept by a patient at home for at least two weeks, while subjective, may help determine the extent and nature of sleep disturbance and the level of alertness in the normal environment. A parallel journal kept by a parent or bed partner, if any, can also be helpful. Sleep logs can also be used for self-monitoring and in connection with behavioral and other treatment. The image at the top of this page, with nighttime in the middle and the weekend in the middle, shows a layout that can aid in noticing trends An actigraph unit is a motion-sensing device worn on the wrist, generally for one or two weeks. It gives a gross picture of sleep-wake cycles and is often used to verify the sleep diary. It is cost-efficient when full polysomnography is not required. Polysomnography is performed in a sleep laboratory while the patient sleeps, preferably at his or her usual sleeping time. The polysomnogram (PSG) objectively records sleep stages and respiratory events. It shows multiple channels of electroencephalogram (EEG), electrooculogram (EOG), electrocardiogram (ECG), nasal and oral airflow, abdominal, chest and leg movements and blood oxygen levels. A single part of a polysomnogram is sometimes measured at home with portable equipment, for example oximetry, which records blood oxygen levels throughout the night. Polysomnography is not routinely used in the evaluation of patients with insomnia or circadian rhythm disorders, except as needed to rule out other disorders. It will usually be a definitive test for sleep apnea. Home Sleep Tests (HST)or Home Sleep Apnea Tests (HSAT) are types of sleep studies that can be performed in a patient's home to identify obstructive sleep apnea. These devices are increasing in utilization due to their convenience and cost effectiveness. A Multiple Sleep Latency Test (MSLT) is often performed during the entire day after polysomnography while the electrodes and other equipment are still in place. The patient is given nap opportunities every second hour; the test measures the number of minutes it takes from the start of a daytime nap period to the first signs of sleep. It is a measure of daytime sleepiness; it also shows whether REM sleep is achieved in a short nap, a typical indication of narcolepsy. Imaging studies may be performed if a patient is to be evaluated for neurodegenerative disease or to determine the obstruction in obstructive sleep apnea. Treatments CPAP (positive airway pressure) machine Normison ( Definition of Temazepam] When sleep complaints are secondary to pain, other medical or psychiatric diagnoses, or substance abuse, it may be necessary to treat both the underlying cause and the sleep problems. When the underlying cause of sleep problems is not immediately obvious, behavioral treatments are usually the first suggested. These range from patient education about sleep hygiene to cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). Studies of both younger and older adults have compared CBT to medication and found that CBT should be considered a first-line and cost-effective intervention for chronic insomnia, not least because gains may be maintained at long-term follow-up. Sleep physicians and psychologists, at least in the US, are not in agreement about who should perform CBT nor whether sleep centers should be required to have psychologists on staff. In the UK the number of CBT-trained therapists is limitedKenny, T. (2011). Cognitive Behavioural Therapy so CBT is not widely available on the NHS. Behavioral therapies include progressive relaxation, stimulus control (to reassociate the bed with sleepiness), limiting time-in-bed to increase sleep efficiency and debunking misconceptions about sleep. Pharmacotherapy is necessary for some conditions. Medication may be useful for acute insomnia and for some of the parasomnias. It is almost always needed, along with scheduled short naps and close follow-up, in the treatment of narcolepsy and idiopathic hypersomnia. Chronic circadian rhythm disorders, the most common of which is delayed sleep phase disorder, may be managed by specifically-timed bright light therapy, usually in the morning, darkness therapy in the hours before bedtime, and timed oral administration of the hormone melatonin. Chronotherapy has also been prescribed for circadian rhythm disorders, though results are generally short-lived. Stimulants may also be prescribed. When these therapies are unsuccessful, counseling may be indicated to help a person adapt to and live with the condition. People with these disorders who have chosen a lifestyle in conformity with their sleeping schedules have no need of treatment, though they may need the diagnosis in order to avoid having to meet for appointments or meetings during their sleep time. Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), Bilevel Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (BiPAP), or similar machines can be used nightly at home to effectively manage sleep- related breathing disorders such as apnea. In milder cases, oral appliances may be effective alternate treatments. For mild cases in obese people, weight reduction may be sufficient, but it is usually recommended as an adjunct to CPAP treatment since sustaining weight loss is difficult. In some cases, upper airway surgery, generally performed by an otolaryngologist/head & neck surgeon or occasionally an oral and maxillofacial surgeon, is indicated. The treatments prevent airway collapse, which interrupts breathing during sleep. A 2001 study published by Hans-Werner Gessmann in the Journal of Sleep Medicine and Sleep Psychology found that patients who practiced a series of electrical stimulations of suprahyoidal tongue muscles for 20 minutes a day showed a marked decline in sleep apnea symptoms after two months. Patients experienced an average of 36% fewer apnea episodes after successfully completing the treatments.Gessmann, H.-W.: The Tongue Muscle Training (ZMT®) in nCPAP Patients with Obstructive Sleep Apnea Syndrome (OSAS), Journal of Sleep Medicine and Sleep Psychology, PIB Publisher, Duisburg, 2001Randerath, W., Galetke, W., Domanski, U., Weitkunat, R., Rühle, K.-H.: Tongue muscle training by electrical neurostimulation in the treatment of obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome . Somnologie, Blackwell Verlag Berlin, Vol. 8, p. 14, Feb. 2004 The Effect of Cancer on Sleep, according to the National Cancer Institute (NCI), about 50% of cancer patients have trouble sleeping. Difficulty sleeping can include Restless Leg Syndrome (RLS), sleeping that is fragmented, or insomnia. Some reports show that up to 80% of patients who are undergoing cancer treatments experience some form of insomnia. One of the significant reasons for sleeping problems is stress, uncertainty, and fear. Other patients have difficulty sleeping directly due to their treatments while others experience pain that affects sleep quality. Other factors include diet and less than optimum sleeping conditions. Cancer has also been shown to be a cause of increased sleep apnea, which adds to the potential issues.

Rabbitpox was first isolated at the Rockefeller Institute in New York in 1933, following a series of epidemics in the laboratory rabbits. It is an acute disease only known to infect laboratory rabbits as no cases have been reported in wild rabbits; it also cannot infect humans. History Rabbitpox has not been recognised in wild rabbits, however a few outbreaks have been reported in the USA since 1930.Merck Veterinary Manual Symptoms *Pox lesions may or may not be present on the skin. *Most rabbits develop a fever and nasal discharge. *The mortality varies but is always high. *The most characteristic lesions seen at necropsy are a skin rash, subcutaneous edema, and edema of the mouth and other body openings. Infection Rabbitpox virus is a highly infectious airborne agent, which spreads very rapidly through laboratories which contain rabbits causing a high rate of mortality. Because of the edematous condition, “poxless” rabbitpox may be confused with myxomatosis. The virus may be isolated or the infection diagnosed serologically by methods appropriate to vaccinia. Spread through a rabbitry is rapid, but rabbits inoculated with smallpox vaccine are immune. Rabbitpox virus is closely related immunologically to vaccinia virus, consequently rabbits that have been inoculated with the smallpox (vaccinia virus) vaccine have immunity against rabbitpox.

He worked for the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA-ARS) for forty-six years as the pomologist in charge of research on deciduous fruit production, and authored a multitude of papers on planting and cultivating small fruits. Life and career Darrow was born in Springfield, Vermont on February 2, 1889. He graduated from nearby Chester High School in 1906, and in 1910 from Middlebury College with a BA. He went on to Cornell University, obtaining an MA in horticulture in 1911. During 1912-1917 Darrow partnered with future U.S. Senator George Aiken in \\"Darrow and Aiken,\\" a fruit growing enterprise in Putney, Vermont. By 1917, however, he was committed to full-time work with the U.S. Department of Agriculture. In 1927 he obtained a Ph.D in Plant Physiology from Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore. A prolific author, Darrow wrote over 230 research or review articles, bulletins, and book chapters; a majority were USDA publications and reports. The bulk of his career was spent in Maryland (Glenn Dale and later Beltsville). However, in the late 1920s-early 1930s he initiated small fruit breeding programs in Oregon for the USDA. Darrow was constantly looking for ways to improve strawberries, and was responsible for the development of twenty-eight strawberry cultivars, twelve of which remain significant. Another accomplishment that made a profound impression on small fruit scientists was Darrow's establishment of a foundation of genetic material that would figure prominently in breeding new strawberry varieties. He realized that improvement in small fruits had to occur by developing new varieties. In order to do this, he thought that scientists should possess an extensive knowledge of the make- up of a strawberry plant. Darrow is predominantly known for strawberry breeding and research, but he worked with all small fruits, including blackberries, raspberries, and blueberries. His personal hobby and passion was breeding daylilies. In the late 1920s, Darrow began tracking down reports of a large, reddish-purple berry that had been grown on the northern California farm of a man named Rudolph Boysen. He enlisted the help of Walter Knott, a Southern California farmer who was known as a berry expert. Darrow and Knott learned that Boysen had abandoned his growing experiments several years earlier and sold his farm. Undaunted, Darrow and Knott headed out to Boysen's old farm, on which they found several frail vines surviving in a field choked with weeds. They transplanted the vines to Knott's farm in Buena Park, California, where he nurtured them back to fruit-bearing health, making Knott the first to commercially cultivate \\"boysenberries\\". In 1948 Darrow received the Wilder Medal of the American Pomological Society for outstanding work on small fruits. In 1949 he was elected President of the American Society for Horticultural Science. In 1952 he served as U.S. Delegate for the 13th International Horticultural Congress in London, U.K. In 1954 Darrow received the USDA Distinguished Service Award, \\"For leadership and research contributions to the breeding and improvement of small fruits, thereby providing more dependable, productive, and better quality varieties of value to both the producer and consumer.\\" In 1956-1957 Darrow surveyed the native strawberries of Chile and collected germplasm in Andean South America. After retiring in 1957 Darrow wrote his classic book, \\"The Strawberry: History, Breeding and Physiology,\\" published in 1966. It is available online via the National Agricultural Library.Darrow, George M. (1966). \\"The Strawberry: History, Breeding and Physiology.\\" National Agricultural Library.

It is the second sequel to the 1969 film The Computer Wore Tennis Shoes, after Now You See Him, Now You Don't (1972). Flynn died by drowning in July 1974 after principal shooting had completed, and the film was released six months after his death. Plot Medfield College's Dean Higgins (Joe Flynn) is about to be fired for financial mismanagement due to extreme overspending by Prof. Quigley's (William Schallert) science class. Higgins finds out the high costs are for renting a cow as a test subject; they are feeding it various concoctions to make it fatter. In a rage, Higgins fires Quigley then threatens to have his entire class thrown out of college. When the dean slams the door as he leaves, Dexter Riley's (Kurt Russell) chemical experiment mixes with that of another student, Richard Schuyler's (Michael McGreevey) vitamin cereal mix. When the cow eats some of the cereal into which the mixture has leaked, the students learn that the cereal gave the cow the ability to produce a huge supply of milk, over 80 gallons. When Dexter eats it the next morning he gains super-strength, as does the fraternity house's pet dog. Dexter shows the dean and Quigley his super- strength by picking up an obese kid in a chair with the right hand and Schuyler with the left. Higgins jumps on this as an opportunity to get Medfield out of its financial slump and keep the Board of Regents from firing him. Higgins takes the formula-laced cereal to the board of the Crumply Crunch cereal company and demonstrates its effects to the board and its president, Aunt Harriet Crumply (Eve Arden). They decide to advertise the powers of the formula-laced cereal by challenging Krinkle Krunch, a rival cereal company run by Mr. Kirwood Krinkle (Phil Silvers), to a competition between their sponsored weight-lifting team and Medfield's to see which cereal can give the other greater strength. Krinkle sponsors the well-funded State College. Krinkle has a mole Harry (Dick Van Patten) on the inside who tells the Krinkle president about the formula. Hearing this, he hires A.J. Arno (Cesar Romero) and some of his goons, just released from prison, to steal it. They break in, but are almost caught before they can get it. They then kidnap Schuyler (as no one knows that Dexter's chemical was the vital ingredient of the formula, rather than Schuyler's vitamins). They take him to Chinatown where they use Chinese torture and hypnotism to get the formula. They then hypnotize him to return home and not tell what happened to him. This accidentally causes him to steal a police car, leading to a car chase which gets him thrown in jail. Fortunately, without Dexter's chemical added in, the formula Krinkle Krunch has in the cereal does not give super-strength; when Krinkle tries it, he ends up breaking his hand. While he berates the mole on the phone, the mole realizes that if they do not know that the formula does not work, then Medfield does not know either and will lose the weight-lifting competition. On the day of the competition, Dexter realizes it was his formula that gave the cereal super-strength; he sets off to the lab to get it, taking the Dean's beautiful but slow vintage car. When he finally gets there, he is confronted by Arno and ten of his goons. By drinking some of the formula, Dexter is able to beat up all the men, then uses Harry to strike Arno and his men down like bowling pins. He hears on the radio that he must return to the contest in four minutes or forfeit. He adds some formula to the car's fuel tank, which makes it race off at high speed, shedding parts as it goes. He makes it in time to compete last, but the car is a complete wreck, to the dean's horror. Medfield is losing badly, but Dexter uses the last of his super-strength to lift the 1,111 pound weight and win it for Crumply Crunch and Medfield. Higgins and Quigley get to keep their jobs, Arno is imprisoned yet again and the scheming Krinkle breaks his hand again after eating the wrong cereal.

Development history  The EBR is an 8x8 wheeled reconnaissance vehicle based on the previous Panhard AM 40 P/Model 201, a light armoured car born before the Second World War, but remained only at prototype level. After the war the new contest for a postwar armoured car saw the Panhard proposal as winner against other two french firms. Despite the two basic concepts developed with the M.201 were retained (8 wheels and oscillating turret), the new armoured car was a new project, much heavier (13 t vs 8), more crewed (4 vs 2), with a 75 mm gun (vs 25 mm) and with many other innovation, included a new anti-bullet tyres and very sloped armour, double pilot and machine gun inside the hull nose and aft. The production only started after several years of testing, as Modele 51 in 1950 (limited production), followed by full production in 1954 with over 1200 vehicles being manufactured until 1960. While being lightly armoured, the EBR was armed with the 90 mm FL-11 or 75 mm cannon known as the FL-10 or L/48 in a novel oscillating turret and supported by up to four 7.5 mm machine guns: one coaxial with the main gun, one operated by the driver, one by the co-driver, and one by the commander, though the latter was not found on all EBRs. The EBR had a crew of four (including two in the turret),Ogorkiewicz, R. M. AFV Weapons Profile 039 Panhard Armoured Cars (Windsor, Berks: Profile Publications). and was powered by a 6 literOgorkiewicz. 12HD horizontally opposed air-cooled 12-cylinder engine (with dual carburetors and 6.6:1 compression, enabling it to run on low-octane petrol). Based on Panhard's two- cylinder automobile engine, it was mounted under the floor of the fighting compartment, which had the unfortunate effect of requiring the turret to be removed to conduct major engine repairs. Designed in 1951 by Panhard, OBE used a symmetrical front and rear with two driver positions. The EBR can reach speeds of on -wide, -diameter wheels with Michelin tyres and Veil-Picard tubes, which feature a series of nitrogen-filled cells, enabling them to absorb bullet hits and not go flat. The armoured hull is mounted on an 8-wheel drive, with 4 inner metal wheels, which can be raised for driving on the road. The four central wheels have aluminum rims with steel grousers, separated by rubber blocks; with all eight wheels deployed, ground pressure is only per . The 1954 model improves armaments with a lengthened 75 mm barrel, giving a muzzle velocity of 1000 m/s. Finally, the 1963 version further strengthens firepower with a 90 mm gun. An armoured personnel carrier derivative known as the Engin Transport de Troupes (ETT) was produced for export, but only 28 were ever produced (for Portugal).  Service history  France has, since 1935, engaged in the manufacture and use of a prolific line of wheeled armored reconnaissance vehicles armed with weapons with an anti-tank capability. This being the result of reforms initiated by the Light Mechanized Divisions (DLM). French tactical doctrine required reconnaissance elements to cover and range over a large and extensive battlefield, especially within the context of the slow and high-maintenance tanks of the time. Also of note is the way that tanks are best deployed, massed and concentrated, which prevents their dispersion for safety and for screening. It is a particular trait of French reconnaissance vehicles to be heavily armed. From the prewar MD 178 armed with an anti-tank gun of 25 mm, (which was for the period a significant caliber for such a small vehicle) to the direct successor of the EBR, the AMX 10 RC, also used for wheeled reconnaissance, and armed with a powerful 105 mm gun with automatic firing, firepower equal to a main battle tank of the 1980s. A pattern repeated in the AML 90 and the ERC 90 Sagaie. These reconnaissance systems are not only aimed at discovery and investigation (missions that can be fulfilled by lighter vehicles with lighter weapons), but also with security missions upon the battlefield (for example flank-security and offensive protection) which requires a substantial firepower not only to destroy the enemy advance elements, but also to oppose armoured incursions. A turretless Panhard EBR vehicle carried the coffin of the late French president Charles de Gaulle at his state funeral.http://www.avbf.fr/wp- content/uploads/2013/07/char-EBR.jpg Portugal ordered 50 EBRs and 28 ETTs in 1956. After the outbreak of the Portuguese Colonial War, most of these vehicles were sent to Lisbon's African colonies for counter-insurgency operations, especially Portuguese Mozambique. During the Carnation Revolution, an EBR 75 FL10 of the Armed Forces Movement confronted an M47 Patton crewed by loyalist troops in the Praça do Comércio. The crews of both vehicles eventually stood down without incident. Aside from Portugal and a few newly emerging Francophone states in North Africa, the only export sales of the EBR were a few small quantities produced for the Indonesian Army and the West German Bundesgrenzschutz.

Cammerer Looking north from the Mt. Cammerer lookout Mount Cammerer is a mountain on the northeastern fringe of the Great Smoky Mountains, in the Southeastern United States. The mountain is situated on the state line between Cocke County, Tennessee and Haywood County, North Carolina. The Appalachian Trail traverses Cammerer's south slope and a restored fire lookout at the summit offers panoramic views of the eastern Smokies, Cocke County, and the Blue Ridge Mountains. Although a narrow ridge connects Mt. Cammerer to a nearby higher knob, leaving Cammerer with a very low topographic prominence, the mountain is clearly visible not only from the surrounding mountains, but from various points in the town of Cosby and along I-40 as it crosses Cocke County. Mt. Cammerer is a popular hiking destination, especially in Autumn, when the leaves of the trees in the forest around the mountain blaze red, orange and yellow for as far as the eye can see.  Geology  Mt. Cammerer is composed of Thunderhead sandstone, a type of rock common throughout the Great Smokies.Harry Moore, A Roadside Guide to the Geology of the Great Smoky Mountains National Park (Knoxville: University of Tennessee Press, 1988), 74-75. Thunderhead sandstone, part of the Ocoee Supergroup, was formed from precambrian ocean sediments approximately one billion years ago.Harry Moore, A Roadside Guide to the Geology of the Great Smoky Mountains National Park (Knoxville: University of Tennessee Press, 1988), 32. The Greenbrier Fault, which crosses the mountain's northern and eastern slopes,Harry Moore, A Roadside Guide to the Geology of the Great Smoky Mountains National Park (Knoxville: University of Tennessee Press, 1988), 37. thrust the Thunderhead sandstone over the Rich Butt sandstone during the Paleozoic era. Approximately 200 million years, the North American and African plates collided in the Appalachian orogeny, thrusting the rock upward.Harry Moore, A Roadside Guide to the Geology of the Great Smoky Mountains National Park (Knoxville: University of Tennessee Press, 1988), 26-27. One of Cammerer's key characteristics is the outcropping of contorted quartzite rock at the summit.Robert Mason, The Lure of the Great Smokies (Boston and New York: Houghton-Mifflen, 1927), 44.  History  Mount Cammerer was named for Arno B. Cammerer, Director of the National Park Service (1933–1940) and an instrumental figure in establishing a national park in the Great Smoky Mountains. Before its renaming, Mt. Cammerer was known as \\"White Rock,\\" referring to the bright white rocks that burst through the treeline at the summit.Michal Strutin, History Hikes of the Smokies (Gatlinburg: Great Smoky Mountains Association, 2003), 245. On some North Carolina maps, Mt. Cammerer is called \\"Sharptop\\".Robert Mason, The Lure of the Great Smokies (Boston and New York: Houghton-Mifflen, 1927). At least one story tells of a lightning blast that cut a hole in the summit, leaving a pool of water that attracted ravens. Throughout the late-19th century and early 20th-century, moonshining was rampant in the area around Mt. Cammerer, as what was then a virgin wilderness provided the perfect cover for the illegal stills. Most residents in the area, however, were law-abiding mountain farmers, as described in local resident Mary Bell Smith's In the Shadow of the White Rock. Ella Costner, designated by the state of Tennessee as the \\"poet laureate of the Smokies,\\" was born in the area of what is today the Cosby Campground, at the base of Mt. Cammerer. In 1934, the Civilian Conservation Corps built a camp at the base of the mountain, and constructed most of the trails and overlooks in the area.Michal Strutin, History Hikes of the Smokies (Gatlinburg: Great Smoky Mountains Association, 2003), 245-247. The lookout at the summit of Mt. Cammerer was built by the CCC in 1937, using nearby rock and timber (other materials had to be hauled up the mountain). The tower was manned by a fire ranger until the 1960s, after which it fell into disrepair before being restored in 1996.Michal Strutin, History Hikes of the Smokies (Gatlinburg: Great Smoky Mountains Association, 2003), 254.  Access  Mount Cammerer Trail With Heavily Rimed Trees. The quickest route to the summit of Mt. Cammerer is to ascend the Low Gap Trail from the Cosby Campground to the Appalachian Trail at Low Gap. From Low Gap, it's just over two miles (3 km) to the Mt. Cammerer Trail, which follows the ridge a half-mile or so to the summit. The total distance from the Cosby Campground to the summit is just over five miles (8 km). The Lower Mount Cammerer Trail follows the mountain's northern base over a seven-mile (11 km) up-and-down trail before intersecting the Appalachian Trail near Davenport Gap. Most hikers who use this route make the following loop: Cosby Campground + Lower Mount Cammerer Trail + Appalachian Trail + Low Gap Trail + Cosby Campground. The Appalachian Trail intersects the Mount Cammerer tower trail along this route. The total distance, including the tower trail, is appx. . Multiple hiking trails, horse trails, and walkways intersect at the Cosby Campground, which can lead to confusion. From the parking lot (near the campground), one path leads east to the Lower Mount Cammerer Trail. To reach the Low Gap Trail, simply follow the path parallel to Cosby Creek. Both trails are marked. A less-common loop follows the mountain's south slope from the Big Creek Campground (Exit 451 on I-40): Big Creek Trail + Low Gap Trail + Appalachian Trail + Chestnut Branch Trail. This loop is also approximately . Hiking in the Great Smoky Mountains, more specifically Mount Cammerer, can be hazardous. Early season snowfalls are not uncommon. Always check the weather before making any hiking plans.

On 19 January 2009, President Bush commuted the sentences of both Compean and fellow agent Ignacio Ramos, effectively ending their prison term on March 20, 2009, and they were released on February 17, 2009. Events Compeán was patrolling a section of border with Ramos when they spotted a man crossing the border. They stopped him in a van containing 743 pounds of marijuana, but he ran. Compeán said he thought the suspect had a gun and was going to shoot him so he fired at him first. His shot missed but his partner, hearing gunfire, fired in order to defend Compeán and \\"allegedly\\" hit the suspect in the buttocks. They lost sight of the man, but said they saw him on the Mexican side of the border. They mistakenly did not believe that he had been injured, so they did not report the incident even though it involved the discharge of their firearms. Trial and aftermath The two officers were arrested after the drug smuggler, Osvaldo Aldrete Dávila, filed a complaint against them. After a two- week jury trial, Compeán was found guilty on 11 counts, including discharging a firearm during the commission of a violent crime, which by itself carries a federally mandated 10-year minimum sentence. Without that charge, both agents involved would have received far shorter sentences. Instead, Compeán was sentenced to 12 years in prison, and his partner, Ignacio Ramos, was sentenced to 11 years in prison. Aldrete Dávila was granted immunity to testify against the two agents and received six border crossing visas to come to the United States and testify. The arrest, trial, conviction and imprisonment of Compeán and Ramos has created a firestorm of controversy from those opposing illegal immigration. Efforts have been launched in the United States Congress calling on President George W. Bush to pardon the two men. On 2007-12-06 a resolution was introduced in the Congress seeking to commute their sentences. On November 15, 2007, Aldrete Dávila, the man shot by Ramos, was arrested at a border crossing in El Paso, Texas. A sealed indictment had been issued for his arrest on a variety of drug smuggling charges. According to the indictment, his alleged crimes occurred after he testified for the United States against the agents. If convicted he faces up to 40 years in prison. Appeals The two men appealed their case to the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans. On 28 July 2008 the Fifth Circuit court of appeals rejected the appeals of both Ramos and Compean. Attorneys for Compeán and Ramos argued, that among other factors, Aldrete Dávila was improperly allowed to assert his rights against self-incrimination in the trial. They charged that in the written immunity deal with prosecutors, he was given immunity against any charges thus removing the possibility of self-incrimination during Compeán's trial. During oral arguments before the three-judge appeals panel, Judge E. Grady Jolly remarked that \\"For some reason, this one got out of hand it seems to me ... It does seem to me like the government overreacted here.\\" (PDF file) Disposition (Sentence Commuted) On January 19, 2009, President Bush commuted the sentences of Jose Compean and Ignacio Ramos. Petition for pardon Although Bush commuted the two men's sentences, he did not grant them a full pardon, thus leaving Compean and Ramos with criminal records that made it hard for them to find jobs. In September 2017, US Congressman Duncan D. Hunter wrote a letter to president Donald Trump asking him to give both men a full pardon.

The crown and coronets being worn during the opening of the Riksdag 1905 Sweden's regalia are kept deep in the vaults of the Royal Treasury (), underneath the Royal Palace in Stockholm, in a museum that is open to the public. The crowns and coronets have not been worn by Swedish royalty since 1907, but they are still displayed at weddings, christenings and funerals. Prior to 1907, the crowns and coronets were worn along with royal mantles by the king and other princes at the monarch's coronation, during the opening of the Riksdag, and displayed on other occasions. After the death of Oscar II (the last to be crowned) in 1907, the practice of wearing the crowns at the opening of the Riksdag ceased and the crowns were no longer worn. After this, the crown of the King and his sceptre were simply displayed on cushions on either side of the silver throne while the king's mantle was draped over it. The old opening of state lasted until 1974. Among the oldest priceless objects are the sword of Gustav Vasa and the crown, orb, sceptre and key of King Erik XIV.  Crown of Sweden and other regalia  The Crown of Eric XIV, as it appeared before a later 20th century restoration to its original 16th century appearance. The Crown of Eric XIV, made in Stockholm in 1561 by Flemish goldsmith Cornelius ver Welden, is typical of the Renaissance style of jewelry of his time. Originally his crown bore four pairs of the letter 'E' and 'R', the initials of the Latin form of his name, \\"Ericus Rex\\", in green enamel, each pair being on either side of the central stones on the front, sides and back of the circlet. When he was deposed by his brother, John III, John had each of these letters covered with identical cartouches each set with two pearls. The Swedish monarchs of the Houses of Palatinate-Zweibrücken, of Hesse and of Holstein-Gottorp preferred to use Queen Christina's crown rather than that of Eric XIV; however, the House of Bernadotte chose to use Eric's crown. However, they replaced the original monde and cross at the top of the crown with a new large monde enameled blue with gold star and set with diamond and with a cross of ten diamonds. They also replaced the original pearls on the top of the eight large ornaments on the circlet with diamonds and replacing the pearl cartouches with eight diamond rosettes, and moved the circlet 45 degrees. This is the form the crown has in the portrait of Oscar II painted by Oscar Björck. In the early twentieth century this monde and cross and these diamond rosettes were removed and the crown restored to essentially the form it had under John III. Eric also had a scepter, an orb and a key made for his coronation. This key is an item found only in the Swedish regalia (although a pair of gold and silver keys also were formerly presented to a new pope at his coronation). His scepter was made by Hans Heiderick in 1561 and is of gold, enameled and set with diamonds, rubies and sapphires and still used as the monarch's scepter. It originally was surmounted by a large round sapphire at the top enclosed by two intersecting rows of pearls. This sapphire was lost at the baptism of Gustav IV Adolf and was replaced by the present dark blue enamelled orb in 1780. The orb is also of gold and is unique among European regalia in that it is engraved and enamelled with a map of the earth according to the cartography current at the time it was made. At the top of the orb is a smaller orb in blue enamel and covered with stars, above which is a small cross formed of a table cut diamond surrounded by three pearls. The orb was made by Cornelius ver Weiden and probably engraved by Franz Beijer in Antwerp in 1568. The present blue enamel dates from 1751 and replaces the original black enamel that was badly damaged at the coronation of Charles XI. The original model used for the engraving is not known, but the engraver placed the northern hemisphere upside down, while placing the names where they would have been if the map were right side up. The anointing horn was made in 1606 in Stockholm by Peter Kilimpe for the coronation of Carl IX and is of gold in the shape of s bull's horn supported by a pedestal. The large end is closed by a lid with a chain and on the opposite point of the horn stands a small figure of justice holding a pair of scales. The horn is decorated in ornamental relief work with multi-colored opaque and translucent enamel and set with 10 diamonds and 14 rubies, including 6 Karelian 'rubies' (i.e., garnets). =Burial regalia= Crowns, orbs, and scepters at Strängnäs in 2018 The burial crowns, sceptres and orbs of King Carl IX and his Queen Christina have been kept at Strängnäs Cathedral. Such items are originally interred with the bodies but later have often been exhumed and put on display. On July 31, 2018, thieves stole the crowns and one orb and escaped on a speedboat.\\"Swedish crown jewels: Speedboat thieves steal priceless treasures\\", BBC News The lost regalia were found on February 5, 2019 in Åkersberga, Österåker municipality.Sweden royal jewels: Police 'recover stolen treasures' BBC News, February 5, 2019 Funerary regalia over the sarcophagus of King Eric XIV in Västerås Cathedral were also stolen in 2013, but were soon found& https://www.svt.se/nyheter/lokalt/orebro/article1204403.svt 2 articles by SVT & 2013-05-03 & 2013-05-07 and are now on display in a special case there.Article by Mats Adolfsson in Vestmanlands Läns Tidning 2018-08-01 Among other burial regalia in Sweden, those of King Carl X Gustav are on display at Livrustkammaren of Stockholm Palace, the burial crown of Queen Louise Ulrica (still used for the funeral of a king or queen) is shown in the Treasury there, and the crown of King Eric the Holy was on brief display at Uppsala Cathedral in 2014.  Crown of Queen Christina  Crown used by Queen Christina, made for her mother. As her coronation and state crown Christina of Sweden used the crown that her mother Maria Eleonora of Brandenburg had used as the queen consort of Gustav II Adolph. It was made in Stockholm in 1620 by German goldsmith Rupprecht Miller and originally had two arches in a very fine foliage design in gold with black enameling and set with rubies and diamonds (a reference to the colors of the arms of her father John Sigmund of Brandenburg), with a small blue enameled orb and a cross, both set with diamonds. Christina had two more arches added to her mother's crown matching the first two and had more diamonds and rubies added to it to enhance the crown's appearance as the crown of a queen regnant. She also added a cap of purple satin, embroidered in gold and set with more diamonds, to the inside of the crown. The circlet of the crown has eight large cabochon rubies set beneath each of the eight arches of the crown and diamonds in large rosette patterns in the intervening spaces of the circlet. Queen Christina's crown was the crown chosen to be displayed with other items of the Swedish regalia and artifacts from the Swedish royal collections in a 1988-1989 exhibition at the National Gallery of Art in Washington D.C. and the Minneapolis Institute of Art commemorating the founding of Delaware as a Swedish colony in 1638.  Crown, scepter and orb of the queen consort  Louise Ulrica's Crown, the crown of the Swedish queen consort. The Crown of Louisa Ulrika was made in Stockholm in 1751 by Andreas Almgren and was modeled on the crown made by Ronde for the French queen consort, Marie Leczinska to wear at her wedding to Louis XV of France in 1725. It was, in turn, the model for the Norwegian queen's crown. It is made of silver set entirely with diamonds. On the circlet rests representations of eight open crowns with trefoils for leaves (the heraldic symbol of Sweden) from back of which rise eight half arches which curl back on themselves at the top where they support a blue enameled orb and a cross also set with diamonds. Between each of these eight open crowns are eight small points each topped with a diamond. Inside the cap is a scarlet cap of velvet strewn with silver sequins. Two large diamonds are set between the circlet and the front crown, the central trefoil in the front of the crown being replaced with a large oval diamond. This is the crown from which Louisa Ulrika removed 44 diamonds and pawned in Berlin to finance her attempted coup in 1756. This is the crown still used on formal occasions such as the royal weddings and funerals of Swedish queen consorts. The scepter and orb made for Gunilla Bielke, the wife of John III, continued to be used by succeeding Swedish queen consorts, although this orb was habitually used by Swedish monarchs of the Palatinate-Zweibrücken, of Hesse and of Holstein-Gottorp dynasties, though those of the House of Bernadotte preferred to use the orb of Eric XIV. The use of an orb by a queen consort appears to be original to Sweden, although the practice was also adopted by Norway during the period of its dual monarchy with Sweden.  Crown Prince coronet  The coronet of the heir apparent The Crown Prince's Coronet was made for Charles X Gustav to wear at the coronation of Christina as her designated heir. It was hurriedly made in two weeks time from parts of an earlier queen's crown. It has the form of a radial crown with eight triangular rays or spikes and has survived intact except for the addition by Gustav III for his coronation in 1772 of two black enameled sheaves of grain, the heraldic emblem of the Vasa dynasty, one between the front two rays and the other between the back two rays, replacing the smaller ornaments still found between the other rays. Originally worn over an ermine lined hat, the heir apparent's coronet is now worn with a cap of light blue satin covered with gold embroidery. The heraldic crown for the heir apparent is based on the actual appearance of this crown and also shows a central Vasa sheaf between four rays of a jeweled radial crown.  Princes' and princesses' coronets  Example: coronet of Prince Carl Seven similar coronets, but of a simpler design and with rays in the central position in the front and back and with eight smaller sheaves of gold between the eight rays were made in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries for the other princes (i. e., Prince Karl (XIII), 1771; Prince Fredrik Adolf, 1771; Prince Oskar (II), 1844; Prince Wilhelm, 1902) and princesses (i. e., Princess Sofia Albertina, 1771; Princess Hedvig Elisabet Charlotta, 1778; Princess Eugenie, 1860), those of the princesses being of similar design, but much smaller. These coronets are set primarily with diamonds, emeralds and pearls. The heraldic crown for a duke (in Sweden always the son of a monarch) or duchess (always the daughter of a monarch or wife of a duke) is similarly depicted as a jeweled radial crown with five rays. Prince Wilhelm's crown is the newest among the princely crowns. It was made in 1902 for Prince Wilhelm, on the occasion of the declaration of his reaching the age of majority, during the opening of the Riksdag in 1903. The Crown Prince's Coronet and one of these princely coronets were displayed on either side of the altar in Storkyrkan, the cathedral of Stockholm, for the wedding of Crown Princess Victoria of Sweden and Daniel Westling on June 19, 2010.  Insignia of orders of chivalry  In addition to the royal regalia, the Royal Treasury also includes some jeweled insignia of the Swedish royal orders of chivalry, especially of the Order of the Seraphim. The Order of Charles XIII, the Order of Vasa, the Order of the Polar Star and the Order of the Sword.

As Wordsworth, BabeePower, and Master Fuol rap on the theme song: \\"Welcome to the lyricist lounge show, it's rappin' and actin', laughin', clappin', lights, cameras, action, we're the first ones to ever place a sketch to a beat, it's the avenue the street where hip hop and comedy meet...\\" The show is also noted as the first program to feature Tracee Ellis Ross prior to Girlfriends. History MTV's The Lyricist Lounge Show had its roots in New York City's \\"Lyricist Lounge\\", a hip hop show case founded by Danny Castro and Anthony Marshall, which featured up and coming musical artists, many of whom have gone on to huge success, including Sean Combs, Notorious B.I.G., and Eminem. The showcase quickly outgrew the studio apartment where it was originally held and was forced to move to larger sold out venues which eventually led to a record deal for compilation CDs featuring Lyricist Lounge performers. A national tour followed, headlined by top hip-hop artists and showcasing unsigned talent. The series was created by Danny Castro, Anthony Marshall, Perry Landesberg and Jacob Septimus of the Lyricist Lounge in New York along with the creative vision of executive producers Stacy Bronte and Rachel Broker. The show was pitched as a freestyle comedy jam with skits shot on location and in a loose studio setting. This approach was pushed aside by initial executive producer Claude Brooks, a product of sitcom television acting and producing, who insisted on shooting the show live to tape, with a studio audience. This approach proved to be too expensive and time-consuming and doomed the show at the outset. During the second season, executive producer Jim Beiderman tried to modify the format to return to the creators' original premise, but by that time the show had already established itself. Synopsis The Lyricist Lounge Show combined traditional comedic skits with the breakthrough concept of lyrical sketches, an innovative convergence of hip-hop music and theatrical narratives. Farcical comedic sketches pushed the envelope of political correctness, while lyrical acts showcased the talent of the show's resident rappers, who performed humorous vignettes with rhyming dialogue and hip hop beats. The lyrical sketches featured a variety of hip hop artists such as Q-Tip, Mos Def, Cee-lo, Common, Tash, Snoop Dogg, Erykah Badu, Krayzie Bone, Slick Rick, MC Lyte, and a host of others. The ensemble cast of the series included rappers Wordsworth, Master Fuol, and Baby Power (aka BabeePower). All three were responsible for creating, writing, and producing the lyrical sketches. Marty Belafsky, Tracee Ellis Ross, Heather McDonald, Mike Ricca and Jordan Black formed the comedic side of the cast, each with their own original brand of humor. Due to high production costs and conflict between the show's producers and MTV, the show lasted for only two seasons.

From then on, it helped organize the creation of a worldwide environmental advocacy campaign against mining operations in Sibuyan Island.  Advocacy  SAM adheres to responsible stewardship. Mining in the island is not sustainable because the island-people live by the island's bounties. Endemism and biodiversity are major factors why SAM is also looking for mining moratorium in the island since it is a center of endemism and critical plant site. They 'think that exploration could destroy the environment, the ecological balance, particularly the Mount Guiting-Guiting, which means posing a threat to the human beings of the area.'Fortuna, Julius F, East and West column, Manila Times.

In recent years, he is best recognized for his work as a pianist, guitarist and producer for Canadian singer-songwriter Dawud Wharnsby, co-writing the songs \\"War\\", \\"Eight Years Old\\" and \\"Let It Go\\" on Wharnsby's 2007 album \\"Out Seeing The Fields\\". The two artists tour together regularly as a duo worldwide and are currently at work on several collaborative recording projects. Early career Born Phillip Bubel, Phillips began playing classical guitar as a child and by his teens was also an accomplished pianist. Phillips found himself as a session player in a recording studio for the first time at the age of 16. Shortly thereafter, his composition and arranging skills piqued the interests of record label executives who saw the talented and handsome young prodigy as a possible candidate for investment. Music industry politics and pressures pushed Phillips and his music out on the road where live performance earned him his reputation as a versatile and skillful player, opening for the likes of other popular jazz performers like Mose Allison and crossing backstage circles with artists like Richie Havens and Livingston Taylor. Touring throughout the United States during the mid-1980s as a member of several jazz ensembles and rock bands, Phillips made his home in Phoenix, Arizona. In 1989 he embraced Islam and became known as Idris Phillips - Idris being the Qur'anic form of the name Enoch. Taking a break from cross country tours, Phillips worked briefly in the early 1990s as a hotel entertainment booking agent in Phoenix, AZ. He eventually found himself back on the road again, touring the U.S. and parts of Western Canada until the late 1990s when he settled outside Hollywood California to work as a session musician and composer for film and television music libraries. In 2009 Idris Phillips re-located to Nashville, Tennessee living and working more closely with his son Matthew Bubel, an active session musician in Nashville. Career as Idris Phillips Becoming formally and professionally known as Idris Phillips in 2005, the writer/performer has recently found recognition worldwide for his melodic compositions which blend varying musical styles (jazz, pop, new-age) with diverse instrumentation. Beyond his work as a composer for Hollywood music libraries, to the growing independent film industry of the Middle East, Phillips' music was recently used to underscore the Egyptian documentary \\"The Fog Is Lifting\\" and acted as the theme music for the Islam Channel program \\"Hayyat\\". Phillips returned to live performance in June 2006, reaching out to international audiences alongside Canadian folk/world-music artist Dawud Wharnsby at a concert in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia (performing alongside South African singer-songwriter Zain Bhikha and Malaysian a cappella group Raihan.) The concert also aired in Malaysia on the national holiday of Eid ul Fitr in November 2006. In November 2006 Phillips and Wharnsby also toured the United Kingdom with Canadian percussionists The Fletcher Valve Drummers, concluding their tour of UK with a brief performance of their song \\"War\\" at the Global Peace and Unity Event held in London's Excel Center, to an audience watching various acts and speakers throughout the weekend of over 20,000. The event was televised via satellite by England's Islam Channel throughout Europe and North Africa. As the lawfulness of \\"musical instruments\\" has long been a debate among teachers and students of the Islamic faith, Idris Phillips' rendition of \\"War\\" - with guitar - at the Global Peace and Unity event marked the first time in British history that a Muslim musician appeared on stage with a stringed instrument at a major mainstream Islamic religious conference. His performance challenged stereotypes that \\"music\\" is \\"categorically unlawful\\" according to some Islamic theological teachings, warming the audience and the stage for world-renowned singer-songwriter and peace activist Yusuf Islam (Cat Stevens) who performed immediately afterward, also with guitar. In 2009 Idris Phillips toured as percussionist with South African singer/songwriter Zain Bhikha in the United States and the Netherlands.

Franz Wickhoff (7 May 1853 – 6 April 1909) was an Austrian art historian, and is considered a member of the Vienna School of Art History. Early life Franz Wickhoff was born on 7 May 1853 in Steyr. He studied at the University of Vienna under Alexander Conze and Moritz Thausing. Career In 1879 he received a position at the k.k. Österreichisches Museum für Kunst und Industrie (today the Museum für angewandte Kunst) in Vienna, where he met Giovanni Morelli and became interested in his theories of connoisseurship. In 1882 Wickhoff began to teach at the University of Vienna. In 1895 Wickhoff published his major work, Die Wiener Genesis, a study of the development of Roman art from the time of Augustus to that of Constantine I. The book was significant for its appreciation of both \\"high imperial\\" Roman art, and indeed also late antique art, both of which had previously, under the overwhelming influence of Johann Joachim Winckelmann, been considered as stages of progressive decline following the achievements of Greek art. Wickhoff's study would prove to be of great importance for the later Spätrömische Kunstindustrie of Alois Riegl, his younger contemporary at the Museum, which continued the project of rehabilitating late antique art. It also sparked the extended feud between Riegl and Wickhoff, on the one side, and Josef Strzygowski, on the other, concerning the origins of the late antique style. Death and legacy Wickhoff died in Venice on 6 April 1909. His students included many of the major figures of the next generation of Viennese art history, including Max Dvořák, Walter Friedländer, Wilhelm Koehler, Erica Tietze-Conrat, Hans Tietze and Gustav Glück. He is buried on Isola di San Michele in Venice.

Reynolds was 38 years old, and a temporary captain in the 12th Battalion, The Royal Scots (The Lothian Regiment), British Army during the First World War when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC. On 20 September 1917 near Frezenberg, Belgium, Captain Reynolds' company were suffering heavy casualties from enemy machine-guns and a pill-box. Captain Reynolds reorganised his men and then proceeded alone, rushing from shell-hole to shell-hole under heavy fire. When near the pill-box, he threw a grenade which should have fallen inside, but the entrance was blocked, so crawling to the entrance he forced a phosphorus grenade in. This set the place on fire, killing three, and the remainder surrendered with two machine-guns. Afterwards, although wounded, Captain Reynolds captured another objective, with 70 prisoners and two more machine-guns.British Empire The Medal His Victoria Cross is displayed at the Royal Scots Museum, Edinburgh Castle, Scotland.

They are usually eaten in bars or taverns as a small snack while hanging out with friends or relatives; thus, they have a strong socializing component, and in the Basque country and Navarre they are usually regarded as a cornerstone of local culture and society. They are related to tapas, the main difference being that pinchos are usually 'spiked' with a skewer or toothpick, often to a piece of bread. They are served in individual portions and always ordered and paid for independently from the drinks. It is not impossible, however, to have the same item called \\"pincho\\" in one place and \\"tapa\\" in another. They are called pinchos because many of them have a pincho (Spanish for spike), typically a toothpick —or a skewer for the larger varieties— through them. They should not be confused with brochettes, which in Latin America and some parts of Spain are called pinchos too; in brochettes, the skewer or toothpick is needed in order to cook the food or keep it together. Basque Pintxo A typical snack of the Basque Country and Navarre, \\"pinchos\\" consist of small slices of bread upon which an ingredient or mixture of ingredients is placed and fastened with a toothpick, which gives the food its name \\"pincho\\", meaning \\"spike\\". Pinchos are usually eaten as an appetizer, accompanied by a small glass of young white wine (called txikito, ) or beer (zurito, quarter of a pint). Pinchos are very common in the taverns of the Basque Country, and in other near areas, such as Cantabria, La Rioja, northern Burgos, and Navarre, where a variety of pinchos is usually served on a tray at the bar. Pinchos in bar In this type of pinchos, the toothpick is used to keep ingredients from falling off the bread, as well as to keep track of the number of items that the customer has eaten. Sometimes, differently priced pinchos have toothpicks of different shapes or sizes. Almost any ingredient can be put on the bread, but those most commonly found in the Basque Country include fish such as hake, cod, anchovy; tortilla de patatas; stuffed peppers; and croquettes. Pinchos can be very sophisticated, sometimes consisting of very elaborate (and sometimes expensive) fish, seafood, or meats. Pinchos are used as an excuse for socializing. Typically, a group of friends will go from one tavern to another, drinking small glasses of wine or beer and eating pinchos. Pinchos morunos Pinchos can also refer to \\"pinchos morunos\\", which consists of pieces of meat, marinated in a mix of paprika and oil called \\"adobo\\" and roasted on a skewer.

This ship was named for Ensign Walter Michael Willis (14 January 1917 – 7 December 1941). He enlisted in the Naval Reserve as a seaman 2d class at Minneapolis. Willis received an appointment as reserve aviation cadet on 22 December 1939. Six days later, he reported to Pensacola Naval Air Station for flight instruction and, on 14 August 1940, emerged with his aviator's wings. Commissioned an ensign on 10 September, Willis soon joined Bombing Squadron (VB) 6, based in , and flew Douglas SBD Dauntless dive bombers until early in December 1941. On the morning of 7 December, as Enterprise was returning from Wake Island to Hawaii, the carrier sent up a flight of SBD's to scout the water ahead. Willis took off in one of these bombers for what was intended to be a routine flight to Ford Island, the naval air station at Pearl Harbor. However, instead of enjoying an ordinary scouting mission, these planes ran head-on into a war, for they arrived almost simultaneously with the start of the Japanese attack upon Pearl Harbor. In the ensuing aerial melee, Willis and his gunner were among the Americans shot down. An eye-witness account from Norman Kleiss describes an argument in the Enterprise ready room three days earlier between Willis, who had unusually good vision, and another officer, with Willis insisting he had sighted ships during a just-completed patrol flight; the other officer stopped Willis from reporting the sighting to then- VADM William Halsey Jr.. Operational history Willis (DE-395) was laid down on 17 July 1943 at Houston, Texas, by Brown Shipbuilding Co.; launched on 14 September 1943, sponsored by Mrs. Marie E. Willis, the mother of the late Ens. Willis; and commissioned on 10 December 1943, Lt. Comdr. G. R. Atterbury, USNR, in command. Leaving the shipyard, Willis's steering gear failed, and she ran aground almost immediately in the shipyard channel.Sotos, page 154. After fitting-out at Houston and loading ammunition at the San Jacinto Ordnance Depot, Willis departed Galveston, Texas, on 5 January 1944 in company with bound for the British West Indies and reached Bermuda on the 10th. Following shakedown, Willis departed Bermuda on 3 February-in company with Kretchmer and and arrived at Charleston, South Carolina, on the 6th. The destroyer escort underwent post-shakedown availability in the navy yard there over the ensuing week and sailed on 15 February for the Chesapeake Bay, escorting the merchantman to Hampton Roads where she arrived the next day. Two days later, Willis then proceeded-in company with to Staten Island, New York, and, upon arrival, reported for duty to Commander, Escort Division (CortDiv) 51. Subsequently, Willis joined Task Group (TG) 21.11 at Hampton Roads on 26 February, the hunter-killer group formed around the escort carrier . =Convoy Duty= That day, the task group put to sea for operations in the Central Atlantic that took its ships first to Casablanca-visited from 18 to 22 March- and then to the British West Indies in mid-April. Besides Bogue and Willis, the group was composed of , , , and . They scored their first success on 13 March when Hobson teamed with Haverfield, planes from Bogue's Composite Squadron (VC) 95, , and British aircraft to sink U-575. Willis continued to operate in Bogue's screen into the summer, calling at Casablanca for a second time from 29 May to 2 June, before TG 22.2 moved to Bermuda. On 24 June, southwest of the Azores, TG 22.2 destroyed another Axis submersible when planes of Bogue's VC-69 sank the Japanese submarine I-52. The task group completed that stint of hunter-killer operations on 30 June when it arrived at Port Royal Bay, Bermuda. Willis departed Bermuda on 1 July and proceeded to Hampton Roads, where TG 22.2 was dissolved upon its arrival there on the 3rd. The destroyer escort then underwent repairs at Bayonne, New Jersey, from 4 to 14 July, after which time she joined CortDiv 51 for a period of refresher training out of Casco Bay, Maine. Proceeding back to Hampton Roads upon completion of those training evolutions, Willis moored at the Naval Operating Base (NOB), Norfolk, Va., on 22 July. The next day, the destroyer escort sailed for Bermuda, again as a unit of TG 22.3 and screening Bogue. Other ships in the escort carrier's screen included Haverfield (with Commander, CortDiv 51 embarked) Swenning, Janssen, and . The group conducted antisubmarine warfare (ASW) training exercises and gunnery drills en route to Bermuda and arrived there on 29 July. Bogue and her escorts resumed hunter- killer operations on 2 August. Four days later, Willis obtained a sonar contact at 1353 and fired a full \\"hedgehog\\" pattern which produced no positive results. A little over a week later, the ship participated in a futile search for a lost plane from Bogue. Four days later, however, Bogue's planes scored again: aircraft from VC-42 found and destroyed U-1229. Willis arrived on the scene in time to take part in the search for possible survivors. She recovered three bodiesSotos, page 227. and obtained oil samples from the extensive slick covering the waters in the area. Soon after, the search for survivors was discontinued at 1730, she rejoined Bogue's screen. Four days later, TG 22.3 reached the Naval Air Base at Argentia, Newfoundland, for a brief period of in-port upkeep. The group subsequently resumed hunter-killer operations soon thereafter; and, during the ensuing patrols, Willis obtained a sonar contact at 1147 on 14 September. She fired a pattern of \\"hedgehogs\\" and made two depth charge runs before she laid a sonobuoy pattern. Swenning joined the search at 1600, and the two destroyer escorts made a coordinated attack. Willis and her sistership then combed the area thoroughly throughout the night but finally gave up the hunt at 1906 the following day. The next day, Willis contacted a lost carrier plane and vectored her back to her ship. The radio operator on duty in Willis was subsequently commended for his action that enabled a lost aircraft and her crew to reach home safely. Willis arrived at the New York Navy Yard on 25 September for repairs and got underway again on 7 October, bound for New London, Conn., in company with most of CortDiv 51. The destroyer escorts conducted ASW exercises out of New London for a week before they moved to Norfolk; whence, on 23 October they joined TG 22.3 and headed for Bermuda, their base for gunnery and ASW exercises from 25 October to 20 November. Willis proceeded back to New York for an emergency availability period late in November, reaching the navy yard there on the 25th. Shortly before she left the yard to shift to Pier 92, New York, on 28 November 1944, the ship received the Presidential Unit Citation \\"for outstanding performance in combat as an escort vessel in two task groups with USS Bogue during the periods: 26 February to 19 April 1944, and 4 May to 3 July 1944.\\" The destroyer escort sailed on 4 December for ASW operations with TG 22.3, again formed around the now famous Bogue. In ensuing days, the group operated off the northeastern seaboard, running into rough weather over a week after their departure from New York. At 1030 on 13 December, the wheelhouse inclinometer in Willis registered one roll of 62 degrees. The ships did not experience good hunting but investigated numerous sonar and radar contacts with negative results. On 16 December, Willis moored at the convoy escort piers, Norfolk, where she remained through Christmas. Underway for the British West Indies on 26 December, Willis and the rest of TG 22.3 operated out of Bermuda, conducting ASW exercises from 28 December 1944 to 14 January 1945 before heading north and touching at New York City en route to Casco Bay for gunnery and ASW maneuvers. Willis planeguarded for Bogue in the carrier qualification areas off Quonset Point and Narragansett Bay before the destroyer escort put into the New York Navy Yard for availability. She returned north upon completion of those repairs and alterations and resumed her training out of Casco Bay. After another brief, unscheduled availability-this time at the Boston Navy Yard, Willis again resumed training in Casco Bay before she shifted south to conduct ASW exercises out of New London. At the end of March, she became part of Task Unit (TU) 22.3.1 to conduct further training exercises before joining TG 22.14 on the last day of the month. For most of the first week of April, Willis carried out a scouting patrol well off the eastern seaboard before proceeding to Hampton Roads, arriving at Norfolk on 8 April. Underway again two days later, the destroyer escort shifted north, honing her ASW skills in exercises conducted in company with Bogue off the coast of Rhode Island, putting into Melville, R.I., in mid-April. On 16 April, Willis cleared Melville as part of TG 22.3 to conduct hunter-killer operations-known as Operation \\"Teardrop\\"-on \\"barrier patrol\\" to prevent the penetration of U-boats to the east coast of the United States. Four days out of Melville, TG 22.3 rendezvoused with TG 22.4. At 0840 on 24 April, U-546 torpedoed and sank , one of the other escort destroyers in combined screen. A search immediately began; and a covey of escorts flushed out the enemy submersible and sank her in a determined attack. Three days later, Willis picked up a sonar contact and decided that it was \\"a possible enemy submarine.\\" The destroyer escort fired a \\"hedgehog\\" pattern and was soon joined by , who likewise fired her \\"hedgehogs\\" at 2138. Both ships then began a retiring search in which they were soon joined by Swenning and Janssen. At 0040 the next day, the 28th, , , and joined forces with the four escorts already searching the area, but none of the ships achieved positive results. On 30 April Willis, in company with Swenning, TU 22.7.1 and TG 22.8, left the screen of the task group to investigate a disappearing radar contact reported by aircraft from . Rejoining TG 22.3 on 1 May, Willis suffered minor storm damage when a heavy wave tore loose her number 1 gun shield, ripping a hole in the deck; but a damage control party patched the tear as the ship proceeded independently to Bayonne, N.J., for permanent repairs. While the destroyer escort was there, Germany surrendered at Reims, France, on 7 May, ending the war in Europe. Upon completion of the repairs, Willis, now earmarked for service in the Pacific, a theater of war-underwent a month-long availability at the Norfolk Navy Yard before sailing for Guantanamo Bay, Cuba to conduct refresher training. From 2 to 15 July, the ship carried out those evolutions, after which time she sailed in company with most of the ships in CortDiv 7 for the Canal Zone. =Transfer to the Pacific= Transiting the Panama Canal between 17 and 19 July, Willis reached San Diego, Calif., on 26 July and pushed on toward Hawaii at the end of the month. She arrived at Pearl Harbor on 7 August and reported for duty to the Commander, Destroyers, Pacific Fleet. For Willis, however, there were to be no more active combat operations- because a week later, Japan-reeling under the unexpected power of a pair of atomic bombs -capitulated. World War II was over. =Post War Activity= Willis trained in the Hawaiian Islands until 20 August and then departed Pearl Harbor, bound for the Marianas as part of TU 12.5.1. She reached Saipan on 30 August but got underway again the next day, escorting to the Marshalls. The ships reached Eniwetok Atoll on 3 September. Willis subsequently escorted the attack transport to Saipan between 6 and 9 September and, on 13 September, proceeded from Saipan to Guam, reporting for duty upon arrival to Commander, Submarines, Pacific Fleet. She remained on operations out of Guam, probably as a target vessel for submarines, through the end of the year. She ultimately departed Apra Harbor, Guam, on 10 January, bound for home. Reaching San Pedro on 28 January, via Pearl Harbor, Willis transited the Panama Canal on 19 and 20 February and reached Houston on the 26th. From there, she pushed on to Green Cove Springs, Fla. Decommissioned on 14 June 1946, Willis was placed in reserve and berthed at Mayport, Fla. Reserve Status, Decommissioning, and Final Status Willis remained inactive for the next decade in Florida waters until transferred to the Philadelphia group of the Reserve Fleet on 29 August 1957. She remained there into the 1970s. Never modernized, Willis was considered \\"unessential to the defense of the United States\\" by mid-1972; and, on 1 July of that year, her name was struck from the Navy list. She was stripped and, on 17 August 1973, was sold to Edward O. Sanchez, of New Bedford, Mass., and scrapped. Awards and Citations Willis was awarded one battle star for her World War II service and three Presidential Unit Citations for her work with Bogue in the Battle of the Atlantic.

Like contemporaries such as Crank! and Century, Tales of the Unanticipated strove from its inception to showcase fiction, poetry and articles that are ostensibly speculative fiction. History The first issue of Tales of the Unanticipated was launched in August 1986. Over the years, notable authors who contributed fiction, articles and/or poetry have included Kate Wilhelm, Eleanor Arnason, Damon Knight, Bruce Bethke, John Sladek, Stephen Dedman, and Neil Gaiman. Writers who had their first published short stories premiere in TOTU include Peg Kerr, Jason Sanford, Kij Johnson, Carolyn Ives Gilman, and others who had important early appearances of their work in the magazine include Lyda Morehouse.Encyclopedia of Science Fiction article The short story \\"Koan\\" was eventually made into the short film The Gnostic starring Francesco Quinn. TOTU has published interviews with top speculative fiction authors, such as Gaiman, Knight, Wilhelm, Sladek, Chelsea Quinn Yarbro, Larry Niven, Fritz Leiber, Kim Stanley Robinson, and George Alec Effinger and Ursula K. Le Guin. The editors pay notice to many authors of speculative fiction who are not always marketed as “genre writers,” interviewing Gore Vidal, Jonathan Carroll, and Karen Joy Fowler. Operations TOTU is an anomaly in the speculative fiction magazine market in that traditionally nearly all magazines have submissions, particularly the unsolicited submissions in what is known as the slush pile, screened by lower- level readers and editors first. As of 2009, all submissions to TOTU have been read and evaluated by editor-in-chief Eric Heideman before being passed on to other editors or readers for evaluation.

It is found on the surface of mature B cells and to a lesser extent on some immature B cells. Generally speaking, CD22 is a regulatory molecule that prevents the overactivation of the immune system and the development of autoimmune diseases. CD22 is a sugar binding transmembrane protein, which specifically binds sialic acid with an immunoglobulin (Ig) domain located at its N-terminus. The presence of Ig domains makes CD22 a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily. CD22 functions as an inhibitory receptor for B cell receptor (BCR) signaling. It is also involved in the B cell trafficking to Peyer's patches in mice. As a drug target An immunotoxin, BL22, that targets this receptor is being tested at the NIH.

Background The 14th UNESCO Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission (IOC) agreed that China would establish five observation posts for worldwide ocean survey, including one in the Spratly Islands, and they commissioned China to build an observation post there in March 1987. The Delegate of the People's Republic of China (PRC) spoke highly of GLOSS (Global Sea Level Observing System) during the meeting of the UNESCO IOC in Paris, but he noted what the PRC considered to be a few mistakes in the text of Document IOC/INF-663; for example, \\"Taiwan\\" is listed as a \\"country\\" in relevant tables contained in the document.Taiwan's official title is in fact the \\"Republic of China\\", though within Taiwan and internationally the nation is commonly referred to as \\"Taiwan, Republic of China\\", or simply \\"Taiwan\\". The scientists from the GLOSS did not know that the PRC claims that Taiwan is not a separate country; nor did they know about the territorial disputes in the South China Sea. They agreed that China would install tide gauges on its coasts in the East China Sea, and on what the PRC calls its Nansha Islands in the South China Sea. The scientists did not know that Taiwan occupied one of the Spratly Islands, but (despite its territorial claims), at that time China occupied none.\\"South China Sea Treacherous Shoals\\", Far Eastern Economic Review, 13 August 1992: p14-17 After numerous surveys and patrols, in April 1987 China chose Fiery Cross Reef as the ideal (from their point of view) location for the observation post, because the unoccupied reef was remote from other settlements, and it was large enough for the observation post. On the other hand, Johnson South Reef in the Union Banks sunken atoll, (150 km east of Fiery Cross Reef), is close to the Vietnamese inhabited Sin Cowe Island (also in the Union Banks), and it is also within the Philippine claimed 200 nautical mile Economic Exclusion Zone; in other words, Johnson South Reef is in a high profile and highly disputed area. \\\\- Version dated 19 August 2011 is available at: In January and February 1988, Vietnamese forces began establishing a presence at surrounding reefs, including Collins Reef and Lansdowne Reef in the Union Banks, in order to monitor Chinese activity. This led to a series of confrontations. Course = China's account= On 13 March, the frigate Nanchong detected People's Army of Vietnam (PAVN) armed naval transport HQ-604 heading toward Johnson South Reef, transport HQ-605 heading toward Lansdowne Reef, and landing craft HQ-505 heading toward Collins Reef in a simultaneous three-pronged intrusion upon the disputed reefs. At approximately 07:30 on Johnson South Reef, Vietnamese troops attempted to erect the Vietnamese flag on the reef. It was reported that PAVN Corporal Nguyen Van Lanh and PAVN Sub Lieutenant Tran Van Phuong argued over the flag raising with People's Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) sailor Du Xianghou, which led to a pitched battle between the opposing forces on the reef. In response, Vietnamese forces, with naval transport HQ-604 in support, opened fire. PLAN forces and the frigate Nanchong counter-attacked at 08:47 hours. Transport HQ-604 was set ablaze and sunk.\\"Secrets of the Sino- Vietnamese skirmish in the South China Sea\\", WENWEIPO.COM LIMITED, March 14, 1988. At 09:15 hours, the frigate Xiangtan arrived at Lansdowne Reef and found that nine Vietnamese marines from transport HQ-605 had already landed. The frigate Xiangtan immediately hailed the Vietnamese and demanded they withdraw from the reef. Instead, the Vietnamese opened fire. HQ-605 was damaged heavily and finally sunk by the Chinese. PLAN \\"314\\" documentary The PLAN filmed the skirmish and consequently produced a historic documentary called \\"314\\" meaning \\"March 14\\" . =Vietnam's account= In January 1988, China sent a group of ships from Hainan to the southern part of the South China Sea. This included four ships, including three frigates, despatched to the north-west of the Spratly Islands. The four ships then began provoking and harassing the Vietnamese ships around Tizard Bank and the London Reefs. Vietnam believed this battle group intended to create a reason to \\"occupy the Spratly Islands in a preventive counterstrike\\". In response, two transport ships from the Vietnamese Navy's 125th Naval Transport Brigade, HQ-604 and HQ-505, were mobilized. They carried nearly 100 army officers and men to Johnson South Reef (Đá Gạc Ma), Collins Reef (Đá Cô Lin), and Lansdowne Reef (Đá Len Đao) in the Spratly Islands. On 14 March 1988, as the soldiers from HQ-604 were moving construction materials to Johnson South Reef, the four Chinese ships arrived. The three Chinese frigates approached the reef: * Frigate 502 Nanchong, (Type 65 (Jiangnan class)). Displaces 1,400 tons, equipped with three 100 mm guns and eight 37 mm AA guns. * Frigate 556 Xiangtan, (Jianghu II class / 053H1). Displaces 1,925 tons, equipped with four 100 mm guns and two 37 mm AA guns. * Frigate 531 Yingtan, (Jiangdong class / 053K). Displaces 1,925 tons, equipped with four 100 mm guns and eight 37 mm AA guns. Commander Tran Duc Thong ordered Second Lieutenant Tran Van Phuong and two men, Nguyen Van Tu and Nguyen Van Lanh, to rush to the reef in a small boat and protect the Vietnamese flag that had been planted there the previous day. The Chinese landed armed soldiers on the reef, and the PLAN frigates opened fire on the Vietnamese ships. Both the HQ-604 armed transport and HQ-605 armed transport were sunk. The HQ-505 armed transport was ordered to run aground on Collins reef to prevent the Chinese from taking it. Vietnamese soldiers, most of them unarmed, formed a circle on the reef to protect the Vietnamese flag. The Chinese attacked, and the Vietnamese soldiers resisted as best they could. A skirmish ensued in which the Chinese shot and bayoneted some Vietnamese soldiers to death, but the Chinese were unable to capture the flag. The Chinese finally retreated enabling PLAN frigates to open fire on the reef's defenders. When all of the Vietnamese had been killed or wounded, the Chinese occupied the reef and began building a bunker. 64 Vietnamese soldiers had been killed in the battle according to Vietnamese reports. Vietnam also accused China of refusing to allow Vietnam's Red Cross ship to recover bodies and rescue wounded soldiers. =Independent account= Cheng Tun-jen and Tien Hung-mao, two American professors, summarized the skirmish as follows: in late 1987, the PRC started deploying troops to some of the unoccupied reefs of the Spratly Islands. Soon after the PLA stormed the Johnson South Reef on 14 March 1988, a skirmish began between Vietnamese troops and PRC landing parties. Within a year, the PLA occupied and took over seven reefs and rocks in the Spratly Islands. Koo Min Gyo, Assistant Professor in the Department of Public Administration at Yonsei University, Seoul, South Korea, reported the battle's course was as follows: On 31 January 1988, two Vietnamese armed cargo ships approached the Fiery Cross Reef to get construction material to build structures signifying Vietnam's claim over the reef. However, the PLAN intercepted the ships and forced them away from the reef. On 17 February, a group of Chinese ships (a PLAN destroyer, escort, and transport ships) and several Vietnamese ships (a minesweeper and armed freighter) all attempted to land troops at Cuarteron Reef. Eventually the outgunned Vietnamese ships were forced to withdraw. On 13 and 14 March, a PLAN artillery frigate was surveying the Johnson Reef when it spotted three Vietnamese ships approaching its location. Both sides dispatched troops to occupy Johnson Reef. After shots were fired by ground forces on the reef, the Chinese and Vietnamese ships opened fire on each other. Aftermath China moved quickly to consolidate its presence. By the end of 1988, it had occupied six reefs and atolls in the Spratly Islands. On 2 September 1991, China released the nine Johnson South Reef Skirmish Vietnamese prisoners. In 1994, China had a similar confrontation by asserting its ownership of Mischief Reef, which was inside the claimed EEZ of the Philippines. However, the Philippines only made a political protest, since according to the Henry L. Stimson Center, the Philippine Navy decided to avoid direct confrontation. This was partly based on the Johnson South Reef Skirmish, in which the Chinese had killed Vietnamese troops even though the conflict took place near the Vietnamese-controlled area.

Dominated by the species Avicennia marina, known locally as the \\"hara\\" or \\"harra\\" tree, the forests represent an important ecological resource. The \\"Hara Protected Area\\" on Quesm and the nearby mainland is a biosphere reserve where commercial use is restricted to fishing (mainly shrimp), tourist boat trips, and limited mangrove cutting for animal feed. Hara tree characteristics The hara tree, Avicennia marina, grows to heights of three to eight meters and has bright green leaves and twigs. The tree is a salt-water plant that is often submerged at high tide. It usually blossoms and bears fruit from mid-July to August, with yellow flowers and a sweet almond-like fruit. The seeds fall into the water, where wave action takes them to more stationary parts of the sea. The hara seeds become fixed in the soil layers of the sea and grow. The area on the north shore of Qeshm and the neighboring mainland is particularly suited to the growth of the plant, and large mangrove forests have developed. The long, narrow, oval leaves of the tree have nutritious value for livestock roughly equivalent to barley and alfalfa. The roots of the tree are knee-form, aerial, sponge-like and usually external. There is a filtration property in the hara tree's bark which allows the plant to absorb sweet water while salt is eliminated. Forest extent and significance The hara forest on Qeshm and the opposite mainland covers an area of approximately 20 km by 20 km, with many tidal channels. The traditional stock breeders of Qeshm Island used the leaves of the hara tree for feeding livestock. In 1972 the Hara Protected Area was established to preserve suitable conditions for the growth and maintenance of the forests. The area is a major habitat for migratory birds in the cold season, and for reptiles, fish, and varieties of arthropoda and bivalves. Green (or hooked) turtles and venomous aquatic snakes are also indigenous to the forests. Bird life includes herons, flamingos, pelicans, and angler eagles. Another important feature of these forests is the appropriate and suitable seabed conditions for the ovulation of fish in the Persian Gulf.

He is famous for a great many roles, and for his rivalry with the Kamigata (Kyoto-Osaka) actor Nakamura Utaemon III. Names Like most Kabuki actors, and many artists of his time, Mitsugorō bore a number of names. The third to bear the name Bandō Mitsugorō, he was also called Bandō Minosuke I, Morita Kanjirō II and Bandō Mitahachi I earlier in his career. A member of the Yamato-ya guild, he could be called by this name as well (see yagō). Finally, Mitsugorō was known in poetry circles as Shūka, and as he developed something of a reputation on the streets of Edo, he acquired the nickname \\"Eiki no Oyagata\\" (boss of the Eiki district). Lineage Born into a family of actors, his parents were Bandō Mitsugorō I and Morita Kanya VI's daughter; Morita Kanya V and Nakamura Jūsuke I were his grandfathers. Mitsugorō was adopted by Morita Kanya VIII, and was the son-in-law of Ogino Izaburō II. Later in his career, he adopted three sons, Morita Kanya X, Morita Kanya XI and Bandō Shūka I, and raised them in the theatre. Life and career Born in Edo in 1775, he made his stage debut at the age of three, at the Morita-za, under the name Bandō Mitahachi I. The young actor took a number of different stage names over the course of his childhood, becoming the third Bandō Mitsugorō at the Nakamura-za in 1799. His father died in 1782. As the 19th century began, Mitsugorō performed in a great number of plays and a myriad of roles, both male and female, at the Morita-za, Nakamura-za, and Ichimura-za theatres. He came to be known for his dancing, and in particular for hengemono, dance plays in which he would quick-change through a number of roles. Though he played mostly women in these dance plays, he also frequently played sumo wrestlers, and lead hero roles in some of the most popular and famous kabuki plays. In May 1815, he performed at the Kawarazaki-za alongside Iwai Hanshirō V, Matsumoto Kōshirō V and Ichikawa Danjūrō VII, some of the most famous actors of the time. Over the years, he developed a rivalry with kamigata actor Nakamura Utaemon III, also known as Shikan. These types of rivalries were not uncommon in the kabuki world, particularly between actors from Edo and Kamigata, but were likely friendly rivalries, promoted more by the fans and by the theatre managers, rather than by genuine ill-feelings on the parts of the actors towards one another. The two would perform together many times, both in Edo and in Kamigata, their rivalry extending over many years. Following a hengemono farewell performance, Mitsugorō left Edo and moved to Osaka in December 1820. There, he performed primarily at the Kado no Shibai, and frequently alongside Utaemon III. He also spent time performing in Nagoya, and in Kyoto at the Kitagawa no Shibai, two cities where kabuki was far less prolific than in Edo and Osaka. Mitsugorō was ranked as goku-jō-jō- kichi (extreme-superior-superior-excellent) in the 1822 hyōbanki (a popular publication ranking and evaluating actors and performances). In February of that year, his rivalry with Utaemon III reached its climax. Both actors simultaneously played the popular and powerful role of the thief Ishikawa Goemon at different theaters. He returned to Edo soon afterwards, marking the end of his 13-month stay in Kamigata. Over the following years, he would perform many more times, primarily at the Ichimura-za.

Description  Females reach a length of , one of the world's heaviest insects, and the males a length of . The females of this species are very aggressive and much larger, wider, and brighter-colored than the male. The female is lime green and has short, rounded wings, however their short length doesn't allow them to fly. The males are much smaller and a mottled brown colour. Both sexes have small spikes on their upper bodies, more numerous in the female, who also has very large spines on her hind legs that can snap together as a scissor-like weapon. Reproduction Females are born a beige color, which fades as it molts, while the male is a darker brown. This species produces sexually. The female will deposit the dark, circular eggs in moist soil. The eggs take from 12 to 14 months to hatch. Captivity They eat bramble, oak, blackberry, raspberry, and ivy, along with other leaves. Their temperature conditions should be between and and should have a high humidity level, provided by spraying the enclosure with water. They live up to two years in captivity.

Originally, the land area was The Northern California Wild Heritage Act of 2006 added for the current total of . All of the wilderness is in Northern California and is managed by the U.S. Forest Service. The wilderness spans three national forests: the Rogue River–Siskiyou, the Klamath, and the Six Rivers. The Siskiyou Mountains form one of the longest continuous crests in the Klamath Mountains region. Elevations range from to the summit of Preston Peak at above sea level. Trending in a north–south direction from the Oregon border down to near the town of Weitchpec and inland from the Pacific Ocean, the Siskiyous are dotted by rocky peaks rising over from the surrounding lowlands.  Flora and fauna  The Siskiyou Wilderness contains a diverse collection of conifer species including rarities such as Alaska cedar, Port Orford cedar, and the Klamath Mountains-endemic Brewer spruce. It is notable for the vast amounts of old- growth forests and many endemic species of wildflowers, shrubs and trees, as well as one of the world's largest concentrations of lilies. The wilderness is home to several rare species, including wolverine, martin, fisher, northern spotted owl and Roosevelt elk. There is also black bear, black-tailed deer, and many varieties of birds. The clear streams provide spawning grounds for steelhead, coho and Chinook salmon. Snow-capped Preston Peak  Recreation  The Clear Creek National Recreation Trail crosses of the northern portion and provides access to some of the more scenic parts of the wilderness—from near the Klamath River to the Smith River (California) divide. In the southern part of the wilderness, the Kelsey National Recreation Trail begins at Bear Lake, and the experienced hiker can walk for about to the Smith River. The most heavily visited areas are in the northwest corner of the region—concentrated on trails that lead to lakes. Much of the area lacks trails and is difficult to access cross-country because of the dense brush.

History In 1873, the New York State Legislature passed a law authorizing the Atlantic Avenue Railroad, which included tracks through Atlantic Avenue from South Ferry to Flatbush Avenue, to build a branch north on Boerum Place and Adams Street to Front and Water Streets, where it would run to Fulton Ferry, using Water Street westbound and Front Street eastbound. It would use some Brooklyn City and Newtown Railroad (DeKalb Avenue Line) trackage in Front Street and Coney Island and Brooklyn Railroad (Smith Street Line) trackage in Water Street. After some delay caused by disagreements over the grade of the street and an injunction from the DeKalb Avenue Line over the use of its tracks in Front and Fulton Streets, the new line opened on May 13, 1874. By 1880, both directions had moved to Front Street, and the track on Adams Street between Front and Water Streets was unused.Geo. W. Bromley & E.

Lingusamy and produced by R. B. Choudary. The film features an ensemble cast including Mammootty, Murali, Abbas, Devayani, Rambha, Sneha, Delhi Ganesh and Srividya. Arthur A. Wilson handled cinematography, while S. A. Rajkumar composed the film's score and soundtrack. The film opened in May 2001 to positive reviews, prompting remakes in other Indian regional languages. Plot Thirupathisamy (Mammootty) owns a provisional store and is the eldest among four brothers, and all live together in a home along with their parents (Delhi Ganesh and Srividya). Thirupathi is widely respected by everyone in the family and was responsible for bringing back their family to a good state after financial troubles a few years back. He marries Bharathi (Devayani), who is responsible and kind. Madhavan (Murali) is the second son in the family who assists Thirupathi in managing their provisional store. He is innocent and marries his relative Renuka (Rambha), but she is short-tempered and picks up quarrels often. Kannan (Abbas) is the third son in the family, and he goes to college where he falls for his classmate Viji (Sneha). Viji is the only daughter of a rich arrogant man Thavasi (Vijayakumar). Surya (Shyam Ganesh) is the youngest son and studies in college. Renuka feels that only Thirupathi is respected by everyone and not Madhavan because Tirupati manages the provisional store while Madhavan just assists him. She keeps insisting Madhavan to start a separate provisional store, which he does not accept as that would separate him from his brothers. Thavasi learns of Viji's love towards Kannan and warns him to forget her. Kannan gets a job and leaves to Delhi as he does not want to marry Viji against her father's wishes. One day, Renuka begins a quarrel at home saying that Thirupathi has a separate savings account in the bank and takes money from the account without the knowledge of other family members. Thirupathi feels bad hearing this. Suddenly, Renuka and Madhavan's daughter faints and is rushed to hospital. It is revealed that the child was suffering from a serious disease which only Thirupati knew before, and he was saving money to meet out the medical expenses without informing others, as they will worry if they get to know about the child's disease. Renuka realizes her mistake knowing this and apologizes to Thirupathi for her harsh behavior towards him and Bharathi. Later, they start a rice mill. Thirupathi learns of Kannan's love towards Viji and goes to meet Thavasi with a marriage proposal. Thavasi agrees for the wedding, but on a condition that Kannan should stay along with Viji in his home as he does not want to send his daughter to another home after wedding. Thirupathi agrees to the condition but does not inform this to Kannan as he will not agree. On the day of marriage, Kannan learns of the condition, cancels the wedding, and comes back to his home to meet his family members. Following him, Viji also comes, asking him to marry her against her father's wishes. Thirupathi convinces the couple that if they get married without Thavasi's permission, then it will be a big blow to Thavasi's status in society, and they should not be the reason behind that. He also convinces Viji to leave to her home immediately before anyone could know about this. When they step out of the home, they see Thavasi with a group of men to attack Thirupathi's family. But he has overheard Thirupathi's conversation with Viji, realizes his good nature, and agrees for their wedding. Finally, Kannan and Viji get married happily, and Viji lives along with everyone in a joint family in Thirupathi's home.

Later, employed by IBM, he developed the format which became the ubiquitous Universal Product Code (UPC) of product labeling and check-out stands. Biography Woodland was born in Atlantic City, New Jersey, on September 6, 1921, to Jewish parents, the elder of two boys. After graduating from Atlantic City High School, Woodland did military service in World War II as a technical assistant with the Manhattan Project in Oak Ridge, Tennessee. Woodland went on to earn his Bachelor of Science in Mechanical Engineering (BSME) from Drexel University (then called Drexel Institute of Technology) in 1947. From 1948 to 1949, he worked as a lecturer in mechanical engineering at Drexel. In 1948, Bernard Silver, a fellow Drexel Institute graduate student with Woodland, overheard a supermarket executive asking the dean of engineering if the Institute could determine how to capture product information automatically at checkout. The dean turned down the request, but Silver was interested enough to mention the problem to Woodland. After working on some preliminary ideas, Woodland was persuaded that they could create a viable product. Woodland took some stock market earnings, quit his teaching job and moved to his grandfather's Florida apartment. While at the beach, Woodland again considered the problem, recalling, from his Boy Scout training, how Morse code dots and dashes are used to send information electronically. He drew dots and dashes in the sand similar to the shapes used in Morse code. After pulling them downward with his fingers, producing thin lines resulting from the dots and thick lines from the dashes, he came up with the concept of a two-dimensional, linear Morse code, and after sharing it with Silver and adapting optical sound film technology, they applied for a patent on October 20, 1949, receiving Classifying Apparatus and Method on October 7, 1952, covering both linear barcode and circular bulls-eye printing designs. Woodland was employed by IBM in 1951, and although Woodland and Silver wanted IBM to develop the technology, it wasn't commercially feasible, so they sold the patent in 1952 for $15,000 to Philco, which sold it to RCA later in 1952. RCA went on to attempt to develop commercial applications through the 1960s until the patent expired in 1969. After RCA interested the National Association of Food Chains in 1969 in the idea, and they formed the U.S. Supermarket Ad Hoc Committee on a Uniform Grocery Product Code, rival IBM became involved in 1971, finding out about Woodland's work and transferring him to their North Carolina facilities, where he played a key role in developing the most important version of the technology, the Universal Product Code (UPC), beating RCA in a competition.

The American Air Base was located on the north side of the airport, in an area east of the current-day Val-de Marne Essonne. The facility was first developed as a military airfield by the Air Service, American Expeditionary Forces (AEF) during World War I. With the end of the war, in 1920 it was eventually developed into a civil airport. After the 1940 Battle of France, the occupying German Luftwaffe seized the facility and used it as a military airfield. In 1944, the Germans were driven out and it subsequently became an Advanced Landing Ground (ALG) designated A-47 for the United States Army Air Forces Ninth Air Force. Rebuilt after the war as a joint civil/military airfield, the primary use of the base was to support Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe (SHAPE) at Rocquencourt. Secondary functions were as a personnel processing center for inbound and outbound personnel assigned to France, and as a limited operational transport base. In 1967 the American military facilities were closed as a result of France's withdrawal from NATO's integrated military command. History Paris Orly Airport's beginnings date to World War I, and the entry of the United States into the conflict on the Western Front. The Air Service, United States Army had no suitable combat aircraft of its own when it entered the conflict in April 1917, In order to provide an effective contribution to the Allied war effort, it would be required to obtain front-line combat aircraft from its British and French allies. As nearly all of the French aircraft factories were in the Paris area at the time, a place was necessary for the American Air Service to receive aircraft from the French manufacturers in the Paris area where they could be inspected, tested, equipped and be sent to the front line combat units.Series 1, Paris Headquarters and Supply Section, Volume 21 History of American Aviation Acceptance Park No. 1 at Orly Gorrell's History of the American Expeditionary Forces Air Service, 1917–1919, National Archives, Washington, D.C. A joint French and American military team inspected various locations in the Paris area. A suitable location of four fields was located on the Fountainbleau Road, 12 km south-east from the center of Paris, and 1.5 km northeast of the suburb of Orly. Today the location is part of the Greater City of Paris, the location of its headquarters being on the north side of the present-day Orly Airport in a built-up area at the southeast corner of the intersection of the Avenue de L'Europe and Rue d'Amsterdam (),. =American Air Service Acceptance Park No. 1= Map showing the locations of the three airfields that were used as part of the Air Service Acceptance Park No. 1 Layout of the main area of the Air Service Acceptance Park The American Aviation Acceptance Park was formally established on 31 March 1918, when the 6th Company, 2d Regiment Air Service mechanics arrived from the 2d Air Instructional Center at Tours Aerodrome in Central France in twenty-five trucks, and established themselves on the field. At the time there were only two wooden barracks partially completed at the site and it was not yet ready for use. The Americans slept in their trucks that night, being awakened at 2:30am by a German air raid by Gotha bombers. Later that day, the Americans completed the two barracks and started construction on a third one. Eventually the facility was covered into a large aviation facility generally known as Orly Aerodrome, with scores of buildings, 78 aircraft hangars, several kilometres of cinder and gravel roads, water, sewer, electrical and telephone facilities. On Armistice Day, 11 November 1918, there were 323 Officers and 2,283 enlisted men assigned. The organizational structure included three main groups: Airplane Operations; Engineering, and Post Operations, which were, in turn, sub-divided into various Divisions and Sections. A parts Depot (Air Depot No. 4), was never developed as such, and was used basically for parts storage to support the internal operations of Orly Field. The Post Operations group was concerned with the administration of the facility, such as security, provost, fire marshal, quartermaster department, the post office (APO 702) and other miscellaneous offices. During 1918, construction was an ongoing process at Orly and the war ended before it was fully completed. The Engineering Department was responsible for the various shops needed to repair aircraft. Aircraft rigging, installing aircraft engines, overhauling engines, sheet metal fabrication, electronics, carpentry, fuselage and wing repairs, rubber and tire vulcanizing and the like were performed by the unit. ;; Aircraft Operations The first meaningful use of Orly Aerodrome with the arrival of the first aircraft on 6 April 1918, when three Sopwith 1A2s landed at the field from Le Bourget Airport. The first aircraft was flown out on 20 April. During the first month of operation, a total of 37 aircraft were flown from Orly to the Front and to various training schools. At this early stage of operations, there were still few personnel assigned and much of the equipment for the Park had not yet arrived. The operations were very much makeshift until June, when the number of personnel had increased and considerably more equipment was available. Air Service Acceptance Park No. 1 Headquarters Salmson 2A2 Inspection Engine Installation Airfield hangars New aircraft aeeiving for acceptance at Orly were first directed to the Receiving Division. There were several sections for the various types of aircraft (SPAD, Sopwith, Salmson, etc.), being received. There, the section would perform an cursory inspection of the aircraft and determine if it needed additional equipment. If it needed a Radio, for example, it was transferred to the Radio Section. If it needed armament, it was sent to the Armament Section, etc. Once any necessary equipment was installed, the aircraft then was sent to the Inspection Section for a careful inspection to see that all corrections and any repairs necessary to the aircraft were made to insure it was ready for dispatch. After the inspection was passed, a thirty-minute flight test was made of the aircraft to verify its readiness. Once fully inspected and flight-tested, the aircraft would either be flown out by ferry pilots assigned to the Dispatch Section to the 1st Air Depot for eventual combat operations or to one of the Training Schools. Planes to be sent directly into combat were sent fully equipped, while aircraft being sent as replacements were, as a rule, sent out partially or not equipped because guns, radios and other equipment could be installed either by the 1st Air Depot or the combat squadrons from stocks taken from salvaged planes there. By the time of the Armistice, the Air Service Acceptance Park No. 1 dispatched 1,809 aircraft, fully equipped and 332 planes unequipped. The average length of time between the arrival of an aircraft at Orly until it was Dispatched with a full complement of equipment was two or three days. 1,103 aircraft were sent to the various training schools throughout France, making a total of 3,244 aircraft processed by the Air Service Acceptance Park No. 1 at Orly. In cases where it was not on order, it was transferred to the Storage Section where it was placed in a hangar, awaiting dispatch. Each aircraft in storage was re-inspected every five days to insure it was ready for dispatch. It was important that each aircraft flown into Orly be fully accounted for on a daily basis, and complete records of each aircraft, its condition, the amount of work done on it, the equipment installed was fully documented. Each night an inventory was made of all aircraft at the field which was sent to the Commanding Officer each morning, with a copy sent to Air Service headquarters at Chaumont and one to AEF headquarters in Paris. ;; Post-Armistice Operations With the Armistice with Germany on 11 November 1918, new aircraft being received by the Air Service ended, and the work at Orly began to be the return of French and British aircraft to their respective governments. As the 1st Air Depot at Colombey- les-Belles Aerodrome was the designated demobilization center for the Air Service, foreign aircraft flown by combat organizations and also at the training schools were received by the 1st Air Depot when the various units were ordered to demobilize. These aircraft, along with the records maintained for each one were ferried to Orly over the winter of 1918-1919 and then flown to various locations in France where they were returned to their respective governments. By the beginning of February 1919, arrangements were being made with the French Government for them to take over the facilities at Orly, and the facility was ordered demobilized at the beginning of March, 1919. The Americans simply abandoned everything in place; turning it over to the French Government, and departed for home.Series \\"H\\", Section \\"O\\", Volume 14, Weekly Statistical Reports of Air Service Activities, October 1918-May 1919. Gorrell's History of the American Expeditionary Forces Air Service, 1917–1919, National Archives, Washington, D.C. =Inter-war period= With the peace re- established, in 1923, Eugène Freyssinet built two huge airship hangars at Orly which was developed and opened as Villeneuve-Orly Airport in 1932 as a secondary civil airport to Le Bourget. During the 1920s and 1930s, the airport's facilities expanded and grew.Orly Airport History =World War II= German use During the 1940 Battle of France, the airfield at Orly was used by the occupying German Luftwaffe shortly after its seizure in June 1940. The Luftwaffe moved elements of two fighter wings, Jagdgeschwader 21 (JG 21) and Jagdgeschwader 54 (JG 54), in June, both equipped with Messerschmitt Bf 109Es, and a bomber wing, Kampfgeschwader 51 (KG 51), equipped with Junkers Ju 88As taking part in the battle until the armistice on 22 June. The Luftwaffe, 1933-45 Orly Airfield after two Eighth Air Force bombing raids, taken on 6 June 1944. The Luftwaffe-controlled airfield would have one more heavy bomber attack on 25 June, when 18 B-17s would bomb the facility After the armistice, the fighter units moved out, while KG 51 remained with its Ju 88s at Orly until March 1941, taking part in the Battle of Britain. When the bombers moved out, for about a year it was used by the Luftwaffe as a rest and rearmament airfield, with units from combat areas being withdrawn and stationed at Orly briefly until being redeployed. However, as part of the \\"Defense of the Reich\\" campaign by the Luftwaffe to defend against Allied bomber attacks, Orly in 1942 became a combat interceptor field, with Zerstörerschule 2 (ZG 2), flying Messerschmitt Bf 110 heavy twin-engine day interceptor aircraft. Beginning in early 1944, Kampfgeschwader 6 (KG 6) and Kampfgeschwader 30 (KG 30) operated Junkers Ju 88As from Orly as part of Operation Steinbock, a late war German operation carried out by the Luftwaffe between January and May 1944 against targets in southern England, mainly in and around the London area during the night. The offensive marked the Luftwaffe's last large-scale bombing operation against England, and afterward only the V1 cruise missiles and V2 ballistic rockets were used for hitting the British Isles. The American Eighth Air Force carried out three heavy bombing raids against Orly in May and June 1944 (Missions 359, 367 and 442). The heaviest being on 20 May when 90 B-17 Flying Fortresses bombed the airfield and a follow-up raid on 24 May when 151 B-24 Liberators again attacked it. By mid-July 1944, with the advancing Allied forces in Northern France, Ninth Air Force B-26 Marauder light bomber and P-47 Thunderbolt fighter-bombers began more frequent attacks, to deny the Luftwaffe use of the airfield as ground forces moved out of Normandy and into the Paris area. German use of the airfield ended in August when KG 30 pulled out and moved east to Achmer in northwest Germany. Advanced Landing Ground (ALG) A-47 After the Battle of Normandy and the liberation of Paris by Free French Forces in late August, elements of the IX Engineering Command 826th Engineer Aviation Battalion arrived at Orly on 27 August 1944. The two concrete runways were patched and the airfield was made operational as Advanced Landing Ground A-47 for transport units to fly Resupply and Casualty evacuation flights by the next day.IX Engineering Command ETO Airfields General Construction InformationJohnson, David C. (1988), U.S. Army Air Forces Continental Airfields (ETO), D-Day to V-E Day; Research Division, USAF Historical Research Center, Maxwell AFB, Alabama. It took until 5 September until the 50th Fighter Group could move in and begin combat operations with P-47 Thunderbolts, however they only remained for a week until they moved out and Orly became a command and control field, with Liaison units using the field with light aircraft until October 1945.Maurer, Maurer. Air Force Combat Units of World War II. Maxwell AFB, Alabama: Office of Air Force History, 1983. . =Postwar Use= Remaining in American hands after the war, the first postwar unit at Orly was an Air Transport Command (ATC) unit, the 1408th Army Air Force (AAF) Base Unit which arrived in early 1945. Orly Airport was heavily damaged by bombing raids during the war, and with the German Capitulation in May 1945, plans were made to reconstruct the facility and return it to civil control as Paris' main civil airport for Air France's international flights. ATC also operated a military air terminal at the older and smaller Le Bourget Airport (ALG A-54) until May 1946 when it was re-opened for commercial air travel and Air France re-established its major aircraft maintenance facilities at the field and for domestic service. At both Orly and Le Bourget Airports, ramp space was becoming more and more crowded. However, the American military and political leadership preferred Orly Airport when going to meetings in Paris, or traveling southeast to Foutainebleu, or west to Camp del Loges and Rocquencourt. After reconstruction was completed, Orly was formally returned to the French Government on 7 November 1947, with the United States Air Force 1630th Air Base Squadron leasing a small portion on the east side of the Airport and operated the American military air terminal. The ATC facilities at Le Bourget were closed and consolidated at Orly. The amount of diplomatic and military air travel into Orly increased steadily in the late 1940s as long distance travel was changing from ship and rail transport to airliners, and the leased facilities at Orly grew to accommodate the large, four engine C-54 Skymasters and VIP airliners. for meetings.AFHRA Orly Search =Postwar U.S. use= Military Air Transport Service 100px With the formation of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) in 1949, the United States chose to leave its headquarters in West Germany and to create a duplicate command at NATO Headquarters in Paris. The joint United States European Command (EUCOM) was formed with Army and Air Force leadership establishing themselves in Paris (although EUCOM Headquarters remained in West Germany, as well as HQ USAFE and HQ USAREUR). An agreement was reached on 10 November 1950 on a new lease to allow for aircraft parking at Aeroport Orly- Paris, and the first NATO tenant was the Military Air Transport Service (MATS) 1630th Air Base Squadron. which was activated in June 1950. The space at Orly also allowed for five usable Quonset huts to accommodate a military terminal and ground support personnel.McAuliffe, Jerome J. (2005). US Air Force in France 1950-1967. San Diego, California: Milspec Press, Chapter 14, Paris-USAF Operations. . On 1 April 1951 the 1630th Air Base Squadron was expanded to support the air transport needs of Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe (SHAPE), which was activated on the same day in Fontainebleau. By October 1951, the expansion of Orly's facilities was so great as to require a higher headquarters organization; accordingly the 1630th AB Squadron was upgraded to the 1606th Air Base Group. Other units assigned to the group were the 7407th Headquarters Squadron and the Paris APO Post Office (APO 55) Another important mission developing at Orly Air Base was providing aircraft and facilities to maintain the flying proficiency of USAF pilots assigned to the Paris region. Due to the crowded conditions at Orly, USAF pilots used the nearby Melun Villaroche Aerodrome (Former ALG 55) 16 miles southeast of Orly until the USAF Évreux-Fauville Air Base was opened in 1955, an hour northwest of Orly. United States Air Forces in Europe 100px On 1 July 1952, Headquarters, United States Air Forces in Europe (USAFE) assumed command of Orly Air Base because the majority of its work was in support of USAFE missions. The 7415th Air Base Group was formed as part of USAFE, the MATS unit was reduced to a detachment and made a tenant of the 7415th to manage passenger traffic. Its new designation was the 1602d Air Transport Wing Detachment. The 1606th ABGp was re-designated as the 7415th Air Base Group. The primary mission of the 7415th ABG was meeting and greeting distinguished visitors (DVs) visiting the Paris region. These included President Eisenhower, the Secretaries of State and Defense, and those attending international and NATO meetings in Paris. From 1955 through 1959 approximately 800 DVs per month passed through Orly AB. Some summer months over 200 Congressmen would stop in Paris. A summit meeting in Europe could draw 1,100 to 1,350 DV guests. The 7415th protocol officers would have to provide aircraft parking, transportation and drivers, luncheons, photographers, press rooms, secure telephone communications, and security police. At four summit meetings, arrangements were made with Orly Airport management to close an active runway and use it for DV aircraft parking. Space at Orly was becoming critical in the late 1950s. MATS Terminal Flight Information Desk at Orly Air Base, 1955 During the 1950s, the United States became very committed to building military facilities in France, and the Paris area became a center for activities of the Army and Air Force. In 1954, with the conflict in Korea over, plans were made to expand the facilities at Orly. The 1950 lease was re-negotiated to provide additional property for a headquarters building, officers club, NCO club, airmen's service club, personnel office, a new passenger terminal, billeting for 450 troops, a 500-man mess hall, motor vehicle shop, aircraft parking apron for fifteen assigned aircraft, and an expanded dispensary with twenty-five hospital beds. Additional construction during 1954-55 completed the largest USAF air terminal in France, a new AFEX snack bar, a large service club, group headquarters building, fire station, Air Police center, officers open mess, BOQ, VIP billets, and a vehicle repair shop. Most buildings were single story concrete masonry construction, however a few portable prefab buildings were erected to save construction time and funds. Through the years, the detachment grew in importance and in January 1957 it became the 1622nd Support Squadron (MATS). The 1622nd was responsible for handling passengers, cargo and mail passing through the base. During its first year (1957) the 1622nd processed a total of more than 103,000 passengers, 49,000 tons of cargo, 4,290 aircraft and 12,100 tons of mail. Snack Bar at the MATS Terminal, Orly Air Base, 1955 The air terminal at Orly replaced the troopship as the common carrier for USAF personnel heading to France. The 7113th Personnel Processing Squadron operated the Paris Air Passenger Center (PAPC) in Paris. PAPC processed 15,300 inbound and 21,100 outbound personnel during the last six months of 1957. Outbound Air Force troops were given a three-hour time block to report to PAPC, then moved by bus to Orly AB for their flight back to CONUS. The average processing time for inbound troops assigned to France was three hours. This time was measured from aircraft off-loading at Orly to bus off-loading at a Paris train station for their trip to their new assignments in France. By 1955 there were forty units attached to the 7415th ABG for administrative and logistical support around France. The 7415th operated fifteen C-47A Skytrains, one C-54G Skymaster, one C-121A Lockheed Constellation, and one Convair C-131B Samaritan aircraft based at Orly for VIP transportation within Europe (Special Air Support), and for proficiency flying. The 7415th Food Service section was always busy, preparing 4,600 in-flight meals per month for passengers on outbound military flights as well as operating the base mess hail for unit and transient personnel. MATS Terminal flight waiting area, Orly Air Base, 1955 Also present at Orly AB was Detachment 2 of the 7370th Flight Service Squadron with headquarters located at Rhein Main AB,Germany. Other detachments of the Flight Service Squadron were located in Uxbridge (London), Rome, Madrid, Istanbul, Casablanca (Morocco) and Wheelus AB, Libya. The various centers maintained control over U.S. military air traffic. The center processed flight plans, monitored departure and arrival information and oversaw diplomatic clearances. Clearances for diplomatic flights were processed through Châteauroux-Déols Air Base prior to 1 July 1957. After that date Orly AB was designated as a foreign clearance base, thereby reducing request time for diplomatic clearances into the Middle East and Africa. An official base newspaper \\"The Orly Diplomat\\" (6 pages 13 by 8 inches) was begun in June 1953 by TSGT John R. German, off a \\"rickety, ink-stained mimeo machine. The publication was renamed \\"The Orly Oracle\\" in 1955 and grew gradually until its final edition on September 15, 1958. TSGT John R.

Las Vegas, Nevada: Orly Oracle final edition of Sept. 1958. Operational use Several special airlift operations were conducted from Orly Air Base. In 1954 USAF C-124 transports assisted the French by airlifting 500 paratroop/commandos and their equipment to Indochina, landing at Da Nang's Tourane Airfield. It was the longest troop airlift in history at that time. The troopers wore civilian clothes and departed Orly AB at 0310 hours in the morning. The C-124s continued across the Pacific to their home base, making the airlift an around- the-world flight. French military personnel board a Douglas C-124C Globemaster II (53-004) at Orly Field, Paris, bound for Indochina, May 3, 1954 A second airlift, \\"Operation Wounded Warrior',\\" made the longest medical evacuation flight when the first C-118Bs from Westover AFB, Massachusetts, landed at Orly on 3 July 1954. The aircraft was returning forty-seven wounded French soldiers from Saigon. These veterans had fought in the Battle of Dien Bien Phu. After boarding the wounded in Saigon, the C-118 \\"Liftmaster\\" flew eastward to Japan, Hawaii, California, Massachusetts, across the Atlantic to the Azores, and on to Paris. A total of 500 seriously wounded men were returned by USAF-MATS. The French Army and government officials were deeply appreciative of the airlift effort supplied by the United States. From 1953 through 1958, USAFE operated \\"Kinderlift\\" flights during the months of July and August. This program flew about 2,000 underprivileged German children each year from Berlin to West Germany for a month's vacation in German and American homes. The 7415th ABG supplied aircraft and crews for 100 of these missions in 1957, flying 160 hours between Berlin and Rhein-Main Air Base or Hanover. = Phase-out and closure = Relations between the USAF and the civil Aéroports de Paris began to become contentious in the mid 1950s as the amount of air traffic at Orly grew and grew. In November 1955, the USAF was informed by the French civil authorities that most of the USAF facilities would have to be abandoned at the end of 1957 to allow for planned airport expansion. This demand by the French was passed up the chain of command through NATO and the State Department. Negotiations between the United States and France were begun to find an alternative. Several of the new USAF air bases in France were proposed, Dreux- Louvilliers Air Base and Évreux-Fauville Air Base were already USAFE troop carrier bases, and were proposed as alternates, however no agreement could be made. The VIPs who used Orly Air Base liked the fact that it was only minutes away from their destinations in the Paris area and preferred the proximity of Orly to Paris. That, was that. Orly International Airport was expanded several times during the late 1950s and 1960s and the relationship remained strained. The Orly Air Base operation continued until March 1967 when it was closed as part of the general American withdrawal from France as part of operation FRELOC. Orly Air Base was the last USAF facility in France to be closed. Today a few of the former USAF buildings are still in use for industrial purposes, however most of what was Orly Air Base has been absorbed into Orly Airport and is used as a cargo handling and civil aircraft maintenance facility. The World War I Air Service facility has been totally obliterated, however it can be located by aligning current online maps and satellite images to the 1918 maps (on available in commons) to the previous road and rail network.

He is named after former sports department head Donald \\"Doc\\" Minnegan. History =The Golden Knights= The Knights mascot may have come from the 1920s and 1930s, when an elaborate Olde English Christmas dinner was held with knights and ladies costumes, music and a pageant. The 1930 Tower Echoes used Renaissance style pictures of archers to depict athletes and campus life. In 1951, the Knight was used all over Towson with references to the campus being a Camelot with \\"merry court life\\" (student activities) and \\"many tournaments\\" (sports). The late 1950s, however, brought other mascots—the lacrosse team was the \\"Indians\\" and the wrestling team, the \\"Teachers\\". =The Tiger= Lou Winkelman as \\"Mr. Tiger\\" Lou Winkelman with the tiger The first appearance of the tiger on campus was with the help of Towson alumnus Lou Winkelman. He was the very first tiger mascot, in the 1963 homecoming parade. According to Winkelman, they just went to a costume shop and rented the tiger suit. Winkelman actually introduced the tiger as the official Towson mascot winning Student Government Association's approval a year before the parade. It took about a year, but by 1963, along with the help of John Schuerholz students accepted it and Towson made the tiger its official mascot. The tiger coming to Towson began in the early 1960s when Winkelman was a member of the men's soccer team. He says no one on the team wanted to be called the Golden Knights, the most popular name for sports teams prior to 1961. Winkelman and his teammates had their own idea and simply adopted the tiger as their mascot. Although they wore jerseys with a knight and horse logo, they were adamant that they would be called tigers in their yearbook photo. Student interest in the tiger remained high through the 1960s encouraged by Winkleman's weekly sports column Tiger Tales in The Towerlight, the school newspaper. The Towerlight masthead's use of the tiger image from 1966–1969 and a gift of a stone tiger statue by the Class of '67, stolen from campus a few years later. In the 1970s, however, the Towson Tiger was rarely referenced or talked about. Other than brief sports stories, there is only one reference in a 1970s yearbook. The tiger resurfaced in the 1980s with the purchase of the first official costume by the sports program and with a major presence in almost every issue of Tower Echoes and around the campus. In 2003 the tiger was renamed \\"Doc\\" in honor of longtime faculty member Donald Minnegan. Doc also makes appearances at almost all of the football games and several sporting events around campus and several community events around Towson. Former Towson Tiger football player Big Dan McPartland becomes incensed each and every time he sees Doc prowling the sidelines of Unitas Stadium wearing the #75 jersey, the very jersey number he once wore. Tiger statue TU's tiger statue is a bronze tiger that sits in front of Stephens Hall, the oldest academic building on campus. There has been another fiberglass tiger that was created in 1996, but was taken down in 2006 due to vandalism. There was also a gift of a stone tiger statue by the class of 1967, but was stolen from the campus a few years later. =The first statue= The idea of bringing the tiger to Towson started with the introduction of a bill on February 28, 1995. The SGA allocated $3,000 though it was purchased for $2,500 for a fiberglass tiger to create a more positive campus atmosphere. Donna Garrison, an SGA senator at the time, had heard student complaints of Towson lacking school spirit. The tiger was erected and placed on the campus at the end of the Spring 1996 semester. The following September it lost its tail to vandals. The damage totaled $500. The tiger was repaired and was fine for six months until March 17, 1997. On that evening, police aide Ron Bond saw seven males pushing the tiger off its platform, but upon police arrival, the seven fled the scene. Three were apprehended, one of whom was not a TU student. The statue had been bolted to the platform by its three paws, and the paws were damaged in the attempt to move the tiger. One of the tiger's canine teeth was also broken off in the act. The last incident occurred over spring break in 2006. On Sunday, March 19, 2006, the Towson University Police Department received the first of two reports of destruction of the tiger statue. They had spray-painted profanities on the tiger between Saturday afternoon and Sunday evening. A few days later, the tiger's paw and teeth were removed. The police reports said Aramark estimated the cost of repair at $1,500. Since then the statue has been removed. These incidents were not the only acts of vandalism on the tiger statue. Since it had found its home on \\"The Beach\\", the tiger has lost part of its tail, and a few teeth. There was even an attempted robbery. In February, the university looked into repairing or replacing what the students called an eyesore. She asked Jeff Ellis of Scenic Artistry & Custom Finishes and Joseph Clarkson of Fiberglass Specialties to appraise the statue. \\"It looked pretty much beyond repair,\\" Ellis said in an interview. \\"It's one of those things where you don't know where to start and where to finish.\\" =Bronze statue= In September 2006, The Towerlight reported that a new bronze tiger statue had been unveiled as the centerpiece of the university's \\"Capital Campaign\\" to raise $50 million. The primary difference between the new statue and previous one is that the new one is made of bronze and all of the legs are on the ground and the tail is wrapped around its legs rather than raised, so it won't get damaged by vandals. The new statue is outside Stephens Hall and was unveiled on February 8, 2007 where Caret said it would be \\"visible to passersby on York Road as well as students\\".The Future of Towson UniversityTowson's new Tiger built to last A lot of students, however, have expressed disapproval of putting the new statue outside of Stephens Hall. They say since most students don't have class in the building, most Towson students probably wouldn't see the new statue.Way to hide the mascot In 2009, a duplicate was placed in front of the library, near the old statue's location. In 2012 a statue, in a different position, was placed at the new entrance of the university.Stephens chosen as location for tiger statue In 2013, a fourth statue was placed near the entrance to the recently completed SECU Arena.

The film was released in South Korean cinemas on July 23, 2004 and was the 35th most attended film of the year with 800,000 admissions.\\"Commercial Releases in 2004: Ranked Box- Office Results\\". Koreanfilm.org. Retrieved 2013-07-10. Synopsis The story is about a cheerful high school student named Han Ye-won (Jung Da-bin). She is a sweet, clumsy and warm girl. On the other hand, there is Ji Eun-sung (Song Seung-heon), a student from a vocational school and a well-known bully. He is hot-tempered and rude but deep inside he longs to be loved. One day, clumsily, Ye-won leaves a message on the school website to reply to Eun-sung's impolite message. She is shocked when someone calls her cell phone and threatens her. Gradually, her best friend, Lee Kyung-won, tells her who Eun-sung is. He sends Ye-won a text message: He will wait for her in front of the main gate. She is so scared that she and Kyung-won decide to jump over the school wall. Unfortunately, the moment Ye-won jumps, Eun-sung is standing exactly at the other side of wall. She falls on him and their lips meet accidentally. Raising his voice, Eun-sung asks her to take responsibility; she is astonished. His friend explains that Eun-sung has never even held hands with a girl. Since she is the first girl who kissed him, as a consequence, she must marry him. Events happen quickly. At the beginning, Ye-won does not have any feelings for Eun- sung. She even rejects his invitation to come to his birthday party. Unknowingly, Eun-sung has fallen in love with her; but he is not the kind of guy who knows how to express his feelings. He is jealous when Ye-won is approached by other guys but he does not know how to be with someone he loves. Although he is rude and bad-tempered, Eun-sung always pardons Ye-won's faults and clumsiness. However, he can't bear it when he finds out that Ye-won went out with Kim Han-sung (Lee Ki-woo), an older student whom he hates. Broken- hearted, Eun-sung decides to leave Korea and follow his mother to the USA. A year later Ye-won is seen with Han-sung, discussing whether she is scared for her college entrance exams. During the listening portion of her exams, a quote from Romeo and Juliet is mentioned, making Ye-won recall the memory of her and Eun-sung in the park where they promised that no matter what, they would reunite in front of the telephone booth at the first snowfall. Ye-won stops what she is doing and runs to the park. She waits there as the scene rolls back to the fantasy she had a year ago and she starts to cry because Eun-sung is not there. As she turns around, a rabbit is hopping towards her, the same rabbit she gave to Eun-sung as a gift. She looks up and Eun-sung is there. She yells at him, saying, \\"Why did you leave without saying goodbye?\\" And Eun-sung replies, \\"True love requires no words.\\" Ye-won runs to him and they embrace. The film ends with Eun-sung's childhood memory of some opening event of an elementary school where the only kid that would kiss Eun-sung was Ye-won. An interesting aspect to this is that earlier on in the film, Ye-won uses Eun- sung's cellphone to make a mini-video of her bedroom. There she captures footage of an old photo from when she was little, showing her and a friend. It turns out that this friend is actually the little Eun-sung, hinting at the connection between the two. When Eun-sung watches the video on his cell phone towards the end of the film, he is surprised to see himself and remembers that Ye-won was that little girl.

Generally, there are between 100 and 140 short films programmed each year. Although most of the festival shorts are submitted by student, independent, and other \\"up-and-coming\\" filmmakers, the stiff competition means many of the shorts have been produced involving film professionals. These have included Oscar-winner Louis Gossett Jr. in \\"Window,\\" Oscar-winner, Tom Hanks, William Shatner, and Michael York in \\"Why Shakespeare?\\", the late Bela Lugosi narrating an animation based on the Edgar Allan Poe classic \\"The Tell-Tale Heart\\", Francesco Quinn in \\"The Gnostic\\", and Robert Wagner and Lori Singer in \\"Little Victim \\" The short films are arranged into thematic programs, such as international drama, crime drama, dramedy, science-fiction, horror, comedy, avant-garde, underground, and animation. In addition to the regular screenings, the festival presents special showcases and retrospectives; for example, the 2009 event featured a showcase dedicated to documentary filmmaker Jay Rosenblatt while 2008 included a program dedicated to animator Jim Blashfield The festival also presents parties, mixers, filmmaker panels, and Q&A; sessions with attending filmmakers. In 2008, the Festival moved to the historic 400-seat Boulder Theatre. The Theatre was built in 1931 and is currently owned by Desi Arnaz Jr. and his wife Amy. 2014 marked the 10th anniversary of the festival.

High school career Stahr attended Carmel High School, where he was guided by coach Paul Collins. Stahr's first high-profile victory came in the 1982 Millrose High School Mile, where he won in 4 minutes and 13 seconds against a very talented field of All Americans and a group of runners that were later to be considered some of the Best High School Runners ever. After a victory at Millrose in 1982, Stahr came back in 1983 to defend his crown. Going into the race, Stahr talked about breaking the legendary four-minute barrier. But after a first 400 meters in 58.6 seconds, the race became tactical with Stahr and the other leaders choosing to vary the pace. Stahr held off many challenges in the last half mile and held on to win in 4:10. Stahr went on to capture four New York State Mile Championship Titles and ended his high school career with personal bests of: 400m-47 800m-1:50 1000m-2:24 1500m-3:46 Mile-4:06 2 Mile-9:01. Collegiate career Stahr joined Arizona State University in 1983. As a freshman, he made the finals of the NCAA indoor 1000m with the fastest qualifying time (2:23.19) but fell on the second turn. His time in the trials was faster than the NCAA winner, William Wuyke at 2:24.06. At the Sun Angel Classic he anchored the World Record 4x800 with an official split of 1:45. He was unofficially clocked at 1:44.8 by his coach Len Miller. Their 4x800 team won the Millrose indoor title as well as many other top ranking meets. Still as a freshman, he posted a 45.8 relay split. During his sophomore year he came in 4th at the Pac-10 XC regional meet to earn him a spot on the NCAA XC team where he finished 101st. In his junior year he transferred to Georgetown University after becoming frustrated with five coaching changes at ASU. His first official year with Georgetown earned him All American in XC among other accomplishments. In 1987 Stahr captured the NCAA Indoor Mile Championship in a time of 4:02 several weeks after his 4x800 anchor leg of 1:46.2 at the indoor BIG East meet. During the outdoor season of '87 he anchored the World Record Distance Medley Relay, running an anchor leg split of 3:54 to carry his team to a time of 9:20.9, eclipsing the old World Record by two seconds. It still stands as the school record at Georgetown University. Postcollegiate career After graduating from Georgetown, Stahr went on to compete on the pro circuit. In 1988 he qualified for the Olympic Trials in the 800 and 1500 and was 4th in the US Nationals in the 800. Biting off more than he could chew by competing in both the 800 and 1500 at the trials, Stahr raced well but was unable to qualify for the games. In 1992 he qualified for the Trials in the 1500 but was injured two weeks prior to competition and was unable to race. He has been inducted into 3 Athletic Hall-of-Fames: Carmel High School, and two D1 universities: Arizona State and Georgetown University. Stahr has also been honored, twice, to the Penn Relays Wall-of-Fame. Once as a member of the DMR and once for his individual accomplishments at the Carnival. Today Stahr lives in Oxford, Ohio, with his wife and four children. He is a full-time computer programmer, lecturer at Miami University, and a private coach for all levels of athletes through his website Running2Win.com. He is currently coaching a number of athletes - both internationally and locally. Stahr is the founder and developer of Running2Win.com that offers many services for runners such as a detailed running log, discussion board, mapping features, and many, many more tools built to help the sport.

The over-all sound has been described as \\"southern - style sludge\\".Metal Hammer, 2007 Career In 2007, Vallenbrosa supported Sepultura's Dante XI World Tour. Following this, their self-released album Hessian Mercenaries was well received by fans and by Metal Hammer who noted that \\"Vallenbrosa are capable of expressing rage without resorting to stereotypical sonic violence\\". In September they were on the bill for butserfest. They played alongside Elliot Minor and Furthest Drive Home. In 2008, they garnered interest from Dave Mustaine of Megadeth, despite losing the supporting slot of Megadeth's 2008 European Tour of Duty to British thrash metallers Evile. Since then Vallenbrosa are under America's New World Artist Management, but currently remain unsigned. They recorded their new album as of 2008 with Pete Miles in Devon, which was in August 2008 in Nashville, US, by Rob Coates and Vlado Meller, with a follow up gig at Nottingham Rock City on 30 August. They will also be performing with Malefice on 19 July at the Gedfest Festival Hall in Petersfield \\"Rock City\\". They are also on the bill for Butserfest on 12 September having also played the previous year. They played the unsigned stage at Bloodstock, England's biggest metal festival on 14 August 2009.

The protein encoded by CD94 gene is a lectin, cluster of differentiation and a receptor that is involved in cell signaling and is expressed on the surface of natural killer cells in the innate immune system. CD94 pairs with the NKG2 molecule as a heterodimer. The CD94/NKG2 complex, on the surface of natural killer cells interacts with Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA)-E on target cells.  Function  Natural killer (NK) cells are a distinct lineage of lymphocytes that mediate cytotoxic activity and secrete cytokines upon immune stimulation. Several genes of the C-type lectin superfamily, including members of the NKG2 family, are expressed by NK cells and may be involved in the regulation of NK cell function. KLRD1 (CD94) is an antigen preferentially expressed on NK cells and is classified as a type II membrane protein because it has an external C terminus. KLRD1 has two alternatively spliced variants that differ in the presence or absence of exon 2 sequence.  Interactions  KLRD1 has been shown to interact with KLRC2.

It was presumably first synthesized by Alexander Shulgin and reported in his book PiHKAL (Phenethylamines i Have Known And Loved). Chemistry 2C-T-15 is the 2 carbon homologue of Aleph-15, which has not been synthesized. The full chemical name is 2-[4-(2-cyclopropylthio)-2,5-dimethoxyphenyl]ethanamine. The drug has structural properties similar to 2C-T-2 and other drugs in the 2C-T series. General information The dosage range of 2C-T-15 is typically 30 mg or more. Its duration is unspecified by Shulgin, and its entry in PiHKAL says it lasts for \\"several hours.\\" The effects are not prominent, and 2C-T-15 is not very potent. Pharmacology The mechanism that produces 2C-T-15's hallucinogenic and entheogenic effects has not been specifically established, however it is most likely to result from action as a 5-HT2A serotonin receptor agonist in the brain, a mechanism of action shared by all of the hallucinogenic tryptamines and phenethylamines for which the mechanism of action is known. Dangers The toxicity of 2C-T-15 is not well documented. 2C-T-15 is much less potent than 2C-T-7, but it may be expected that at very high doses it would display similar toxicity to that of other phenethylamines of the 2C-T family. Legality 2C-T-15 is not explicitly illegal in the USA, but possession and sales of 2C-T-15 could be prosecuted under the Federal Analog Act because of its structural similarities to 2C-T-7. 2C-T-15 is a class A drug in the UK under the Misuse of Drugs act. As of October 31, 2016, 2C-T-15 is a controlled substance (Schedule III) in Canada.http://gazette.gc.ca/rp-pr/p2/2016/2016-05-04/html/sor-dors72-eng.php References External links * PiHKAL #47 2C-T-15 * 2C-T-15 Entry in PiHKAL • info 2C (psychedelics) Thioethers Cyclopropanes ","title":"2C-T-15"},{"id":"9691476","text":"Amplexus was an Italian record label that was founded by Stefano Gentile that specialized in limited-edition mini CDs by notable ambient artists such as Steve Roach, vidnaObmana, Robert Rich, and Michael Stearns.

Written by Tony Barwick and directed by Robert Lynn, it was first broadcast on 1 December 1967 on ATV Midlands. In this episode, the Mysterons threaten to destroy the whole of North America. Meanwhile, Captain Scarlet, having been dismissed from Spectrum for gambling while on duty, appears to betray the organisation. Plot Driving a car, Captain Black (voiced by Donald Gray) murders a filling station attendant called Mason by running him over. The Mysterons (voiced by Donald Gray) create a replica of Mason under their control. Later, con artists Steele and Kramer pull in to have their car's brakes serviced. Instead of topping up their brake fluid, the reconstructed Mason drains it. Back on the road, Steele and Kramer are unable to stop at a cliff edge and are killed when they crash onto the slope below. They are then replicated by the Mysterons, who transmit a message to Earth vowing to destroy the whole of North America. After meeting with Colonel White (voiced by Donald Gray) regarding a \\"special assignment\\" concerning the Mysterons' threat, Captain Scarlet (voiced by Francis Matthews) visits a casino and, with uncharacteristic poor judgement, ends up losing $5,000 on roulette. When he is unable to pay his debt, the casino informs Spectrum and Scarlet is dismissed from the organisation. Broke, Scarlet moves into an Arizona hotel. He is soon approached by the reconstructions of Steele and Kramer, who offer to write off his debt in exchange for a Spectrum Pursuit Vehicle. Agreeing to this proposal, Scarlet learns that the men intend to use the SPV to attack Nuclear City, Nevada. Their aim is to detonate a nuclear device within the city, creating a chain reaction powerful enough to obliterate the North American continent. Concerned by Scarlet's recent behaviour, Captain Blue (voiced by Ed Bishop) goes AWOL from Cloudbase to track down his friend. When Blue arrives at the desert ranch house where the Mysteron agents are unveiling their plan, Scarlet appears to shoot Blue dead to reassure his new allies that he is on their side. However, he has fired nothing more than a tranquiliser dart and Blue regains consciousness after the others leave to steal an SPV from a nearby garage. He is radioed by a furious White, who informs him that Scarlet has been working undercover to infiltrate and sabotage the Mysterons' plot. From a map left at the ranch house, Blue learns of the threat to Nuclear City and relays this information to White. The Angels are launched and intercept Scarlet and the Mysteron agents as they speed to Nuclear City in the SPV. Scarlet activates a smoke signal instructing the Angels to attack the vehicle. Realising that he and Kramer have been betrayed, Steele fatally shoots Scarlet, but the captain ejects before the SPV is destroyed, killing Steele and Kramer and saving Nuclear City. Later, the revived Scarlet is joined by Blue, White and Lieutenant Green (voiced by Cy Grant) for an off-duty night at the casino. Production For timing reasons, several script changes were made during production. As originally scripted, the episode began with the gambling incident that sees Scarlet dismissed from Spectrum. However, as the first cut of the episode was too short, this was changed by adding several new scenes. The first of these were Steele and Kramer's deaths in a car crash and their subsequent reconstruction by the Mysterons (the crash being presented as an accident rather than the result of sabotage), followed by Colonel White addressing Cloudbase personnel after the Mysterons issue their threat. Later, as the episode was still under time, Captain Black's murder of Mason and the reconstructed Mason's sabotage of Steele and Kramer's car were also added. The script describes Nuclear City as housing all of North America's nuclear weapons and radioactive materials; however, this is not conveyed in the finished episode. The Mysteron threat as stated in the finished episode is truncated from the scripted version, in which the Mysterons specifically vow to destroy North America within seven days. The casino set incorporated props that had previously appeared as part of the Creighton-Ward Mansion dining room in Thunderbirds. The miniature roulette props were parts of a toy set produced by Merit Toys and had previously appeared in the Thunderbirds episode \\"The Duchess Assignment\\". The ranch house scale model was a modified version of the hunting lodge seen in \\"Spectrum Strikes Back\\". All music in \\"Special Assignment\\" is taken from earlier episodes. One of the recycled tracks is \\"White as Snow\\", which was originally composed for the episode of the same name and can be heard during the scene of Mason's murder. The music accompanying the closing scene was originally composed for the Thunderbirds episode \\"30 Minutes After Noon\\". Although the script states that Blue travels to the ranch house in a Spectrum Patrol Car, the model shot shows him driving an unmarked car. The fate of the Mysteron reconstruction of Mason is not shown. \\"Special Assignment\\" is one of only a few episodes of Captain Scarlet in which Colonel White is seen away Cloudbase. The only other episodes in which he is shown to leave the base are \\"White as Snow\\", \\"Spectrum Strikes Back\\" and \\"Flight to Atlantica\\". Reception Chris Drake and Graeme Bassett note the unusual nature of the plot, writing that it \\"contains more than one red herring\\". Andrew Pixley and Julie Rogers of Starburst magazine consider Black's murder of Mason, accomplished by running the attendant over with his car, as one of the series' more violent moments, also noting that Black kills a filling station worker in \\"Manhunt\\" by crushing him with a car lifter. Writer Fred McNamara criticises the episode's \\"clumsy, scrambling premise\\" and \\"bizarre\\" structure, commenting: \\"So much of it is stitched together so loosely. Everything in its set-up feels like it's in the wrong order, or that there's entire chunks of plot missing.\\" He questions the logic of the Mysterons' methods, noting that while the purpose of the reconstructed Kramer and Steele seems to be to recruit the disgraced Scarlet, the aliens murder the original conmen before Scarlet is dismissed from Spectrum (\\"They had no way of knowing Captain Scarlet would fall right into their hands, so had Spectrum kept their plan hush-hush for a later date, what exactly would the Mysterons' plan have entailed?\\") Despite this, McNamara also considers the episode to be \\"full of visual strengths\\" and engaging \\"human aspects\\", praising the \\"harrowing sight\\" of the SPV being targeted by the Angel squadron as well as Ed Bishop and Francis Matthews's \\"crisp, stirring\\" voice acting during the scenes of the concerned Captain Blue's search for his friend Scarlet. He also admires scriptwriter Tony Barwick's skill in \\"playfully twisting Cold War motifs\\" as Spectrum and the Mysterons try to outwit each other and Scarlet seemingly defects to the Mysterons. McNamara concludes that \\"[s]ometimes it's best to just let go of the madness and embrace the episode for what is – a lovely bit of Cold War-inspired trickery.\\" References External links \\"Special Assignment\\" at TheVervoid.com 1967 British television episodes Television episodes set in Arizona Captain Scarlet and the Mysterons episodes Television episodes set in Nevada ","title":"Special Assignment (Captain Scarlet)"},{"id":"9691544","text":"Petrus Ngebo, previously known as Petrus Mahlatsi, (born 1 April 1984 in Koppies, Free State) is a South African footballer who plays for Chippa United in the Premier Soccer League.
