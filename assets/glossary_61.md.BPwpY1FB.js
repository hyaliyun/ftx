It was released on August 7, 2019 on Steam and GOG. Gameplay The player takes control of one out of three protagonists in each of the seven chapters. In order to advance, the player has to pick up items and talk to other characters to solve puzzles. When playing as Buzz Kerwan, the player can use his cat Kitteh to solve certain puzzles or ask her for advice which works as an in-game hint system. When playing as Don R. Ketype, the player can find hints in his diary. Some key scenes in the game are presented as animated cutscenes that can be watched again from the main menu. The player can also highlight all hotspots in each scene or zoom by pressing a button. Plot Detective Don R. Ketype is hired to find and bring back the Necronomicon that is supposed to be located in the Miskatonic Library in Darkham. However, things don't go according to plan. Don gets kidnapped by a strange cult and the librarian, Buzz Kerwan, stumbles upon the evil tome himself. After he accidentally makes his cat Kitteh talk by speaking a spell from the book, he sets out to reverse the effect. In the course of the game, the three protagonists work together and travel to different places to solve the mysteries involving the Necronomicon and the different cults. Characters =Protagonists= * Buzz Kerwan (voiced by Liviu Boar) :He is a librarian working at the Miskatonic Library in Darkham. He is kind of goofy and an average guy who stumbles upon the Necronomicon, and gets dragged into a cosmic plot. * Don R. Ketype (voiced by Don Thacker) :He is a detective who has been hired to find the Necronomicon. When he meets Buzz, he gets dragged into a world of cults and cosmic plots. * Kitteh (voiced by Lindsay Peck) :She is Buzz's cat and now talks after he spoke a spell from the Necronomicon. She is very cynical and sarcastic, but helps Buzz nonetheless when he needs it. =Side characters= * The Butcher (voiced by Doug Cockle) : He is the antagonist of the game who is planning something evil in the town of Fishmouth. * Barnabas Busara (voiced by Josef Gagnier) : He is a mysterious man looking for Bob Olmstein. * Peace Busara (voiced by Anairis Quinones) : She is Barnabas's daughter. * Bob Olmstein : A mysterious being who might appear different to each person or who might not be recognized at all. Development The game was developed by a small team consisting of three members from T√¢rgu Mure»ô, Transylvania, Romania. In 2016, the game was funded through a Kickstarter campaign. The goal of 39.270 CHF was exceeded and a total sum of 53.862 CHF from nearly 2,000 backers was achieved. The game draws inspiration from the Cthulhu Mythos by American writer H. P. Lovecraft and was also inspired by 90s LucasArts games, while the art direction was inspired by Disney movies and Studio Ghibli works. It was translated into 12 languages that were available at launch, and features more than 70 English-speaking voice actors including Doug Cockle and Amber Lee Connors. It was released on August 7, 2019 on Steam and GOG. Soundtrack The Gibbous - A Cthulhu Adventure Original Soundtrack was created by Liviu Boar and Cami Cuibus. The soundtrack was recorded with live instruments, contains 27 tracks with 2 hours and 9 minutes of original music, and is available in MP3 and FLAC formats. A copy of the OST is included with the deluxe version of the game. Reception On Metacritic, a review aggregator, the PC version has a critics score of 74/100 based on 14 reviews, which the site categorizes as \\"generally favorable reviews\\". Teodor Nechita from Softpedia gave 4 out of 5 stars and compared the atmosphere of the game to Tim Burton. In the review it said, \\"All in all, Gibbous - A Cthulhu Adventure is a game that no self-proclaimed point-and -click fan should overlook, as it will definitely find a place in your gaming library, comedy movie collection, and finally, your heart.\\" Joe Keeley from Adventure Gamers gave 3 out of 5 stars, praising the art design and animation, the sense of humor, the voice acting from two of the three main characters, and the puzzles, but critzising the convoluted story, the at times unnatural dialogue, the grating voice acting from the third main character and some side characters, and the unsatisfactory ending. He said, \\"Gibbous: A Cthulhu Adventure looks amazing and will make you laugh, but its inability to tell a coherent story prevents this comedy cosmic horror adventure from fulfilling its abundant potential.\\" References External links * Official website * Category:Point-and-click adventure games Category:2019 video games Category:MacOS games Category:Windows games Category:Linux games Category:Video games developed in Romania Category:Adventure games Category:Horror video games Category:Single-player video games Category:Unity (game engine) games Category:Indie video games Category:Cthulhu Mythos games ","title":"Gibbous - A Cthulhu Adventure"},{"id":"61476868","text":"Judith A Turnbull (born 1947), is a female retired swimmer who competed for England.

Francis Williams (1830 ‚Äì 21 July 1895) was headmaster of St Peter's College, Adelaide, South Australia. History Williams was born in Oxford, England and educated at Hurstpierpoint College and Lincoln College, Oxford, where he graduated BA in 1854, and MA in 1860. He was ordained deacon in 1852 and priest in 1853 in the Diocese of Rochester. He came to South Australia in 1861 without fanfare to take a position with St Peter's College as third master; in 1873 he was appointed second master, and subsequently bursar. At the end of 1881, after allegations of Ritualism and subsequent divisions in the College Council, W. Bedell Stanford, who had been appointed Head Master by Bishop Short in 1879, resigned. Williams was persuaded to postpone his planned holiday to England, and was made acting Head, and in 1882 was formally appointed to the position. In April 1886 Williams and a College man-servant suffered from a severe attack of typhoid fever, but no student or other staff member was affected. In December that year he took twelve months' holiday to England, James Henry Lindon (8 June 1856 ‚Äì 6 June 1897), later founder of Queen's College, North Adelaide, acting in his place. In 1889 he resigned as Head Master, and was succeeded (briefly) by the Rev. Philip Edwin Raynor, M.A. ( ‚Äì October 1930), who was in turn replaced by the Rev. Henry Girdlestone, M.A. (c. 1863 ‚Äì 29 June 1926), perhaps the College's most successful headmaster. In 1892 Williams was appointed Bishop's Chaplain to Dr. Kennion, then Dr. Harmer's Chaplain. Williams was appointed to St. Peter's College' Board of Governors, a position he actively maintained until his death. He collapsed and died aboard a tramcar while returning to his home \\"Woodspring\\" in Unley Park from St Peter's Cathedral, where he had been acting as chaplain at the morning church service.

He was the most popular Finnish American singer in the 1920s. Kauppi was born in Kotka, where he and his brothers were well-known wrestlers. Initially Kauppi was not very interested in music, but used to perform at the local festivals in Kotka. He became a sailor and left his ship in a Canadian harbor in 1923. Later on he moved to Detroit and to New York City in 1924. He and his wife Hilda Nyman settled down in The Bronx and Kauppi started to perform at the Finnish American hall on 126th Street and at Ty√∂n Temppeli-hall on Fifth Avenue. In 1926 he started to make recordings for Columbia Records. Mostly he sang songs written by Tatu Pekkarinen and J. Alfred Tanner, but some of his songs were written by himself. His greatest success was the waltz Meren aallot, to which he had wrote the lyrics. The record was made in December 1927 and it was sold in 30 000 pieces in the US, Canada and Finland. It was Finland's most successful record ever, until Ture Ara's record Emma was released in 1929. Other of Kauppi's successful records were Maailman Matti, Kuuliaiset Kottilassa, Emma, Sj√∂man Andersson and Herra Petteri. Kauppi made his first four recordings with the Finnish born accordionist Willy Larsen, but the most part of his recordings were made with the Finnish American musician Antti Kosola and his orchestra. In total Kauppi recorded 40 songs between September 1926 and March 1931. Kauppi's career ended because of the great depression in 1931. Along with about 6 000 Finnish Americans, he and his wife moved to Soviet Karelia. They settled down in Petrozavodsk, where Kauppi worked as a swelter and continued singing for the local radio station. When Stalin's terror reached Karelia in 1937, thousands of Finns were arrested and executed. Kauppi was arrested in 1937 and sent to a slave labor camp in the Soviet Union for 10 years. He died there in 1938. Hilda Kauppi was arrested in September 1938 and was executed near Petrozavodsk.

Scientists have found evidence of Neanderthal settlements, including fire pits and flint tools, dating back at least 50,000 years, including six teeth; they disappeared from the site and possibly the Iberian peninsula some 45,000 years ago. In 2014, the then-oldest known human coprolites were discovered at the site, which revealed that Neanderthals' diets included plants. Description El Salt is located close to the confluence of the Polop and Barxell (or Barchell) rivers, minor rivers that are tributaries of the Serpis. It is an open-air rock shelter at 680 (or 700) meters above sea level, one of several site clusters in the plain of Valencia that give evidence of \\"significant levels of mobility across extended territories\\" by population groups. The site has a 6.3 meters thick stratified deposit, at the bottom of a limestone wall, 38 meters high, which is covered with tufa and travertine deposits. Thermoluminescence dating indicated its age is between 60.7 ¬± 8.9 and 45.2 ¬± 3.4 Ka. Thirteen lithostratigraphic units are grouped into five different segments; the second contains units IX-XII, containing \\"horizontally bedded fine sands with abundant archaeological remains and combustion residues\\". Evidence of campfires are found in abundance in unit X, some 50,000 years old. That unit is up to 35 cm thick, and one of its sub-units (called Xb, 10-14 cm thick and browner, with more clay, than Xa) suggests that the climate at the time of deposit was more humid than today's. Unit X suggests \\"several diachronic human occupation episodes and different site functions\\". Analysis of the coprolites left at the site (the sample had been left on the remains of a campfire) indicated the donor was omnivorous: fats associated with meat consumption were found, but also evidence that the donor had eaten plants. A study published in 2014 indicates that Neanderthals may have disappeared from the Iberian Peninsula some 45,000 years ago, perhaps 5,000 years earlier than from the rest of Europe. History of the research Excavations at the site were done in the 1960s already. Recent excavations have been directed by a research group from the University of La Laguna since 1986, led by Prof. Bertila Galv√°n; it is supported by grants from MICINN/FEDER and the government of the Valencian Community.

Famous French botanist Monsieur Jordan visits Karabakh to investigate a number of plant species. After his arrival, he is suggested to visit and stay at the mansion of the wealthy landlord Hatamkhan agha. Although the nephew of Hatamkhan, Shahbaz, was planned to marry the daughter of Hatamkhan, Sharafnisa, after multiple conversations with the family and locals, Monsieur Jordan wants to take Shahbaz with him to Paris for a few years and educate him there. Seeing this, Sharafnisa and her mother Shahrabanu hire a sorcerer called Darvish Mastali shah. Darvhish puts on a show for the women, creating with wood a simple miniature town which he claims to be Paris and burning it down, while his assistant Gulamali delivers Jordan a fake letter from the authorities saying that Paris has burned down. Afterwards, Monsieur Jordan heads back to Paris but does not take Shahbaz with him because of the urgency of his return.

Dial lives and works in Bessemer, AL.  Life  Richard Dial grew up in Bessemer, Alabama with his father, within a prolific artistic family that included his father Thornton Dial, mother Clara Mae Dial, and his siblings Thornton Dial Jr., Daniel Dial, and Matte Dial. He graduated from Hueytown High School and earned two years of technical training at Bessemer Technical School. In 1976 he married Belinda Davis and together they raised two sons. He began working as a machinist at the Pullman Standard Company in Bessemer, AL where his father and uncle, Arthur Dial, also worked. After Pullman shut down, he did maintenance work for the Mayfield Manufacturing Company. In 1984, with help from his father and brother, Dan, Richard left the Pullman Standard Company and began his own business, Dial Metal Patterns. Dial Metal Patterns designs, creates, and distributes metal patio furniture inspired by Thornton Dial's furniture that he made in the early 1980s.  Career  From metals discarded in his shop, Richard Dial welded single, metal chairs into anthropomorphized narratives of the people and communities that they could hold. In his analysis of Dial's Comfort Series of chairs Robert Hobbs wrote \\"Richard Dial's sculptures give new life to the dead metaphors of chair legs and arms at the same time that they transform these seats into personifications of tradition.\\" Expressive faces are bent and welded into the backs and tops of the chairs, giving them a distinct personality. Extra legs or angles were added to chairs, such as in The Comfort of Prayer (1988), to convey that the character-cum-chair was in a kneeling position or had a hand on the hip. Occasionally, Dial combines two chairs or characters into one sculpture to portray familial relations, such as in The Comfort of the First Born (1988) and The Comfort and Service My Daddy Brings to Our Household (1988). Other chairs portray political, historical, and religious narratives in very concise strokes and movements. The Comfort of Moses and the Ten Commandments (1989) and Which Prayer Ended Slavery (1989) conveys the syncretism of the Abrahamic religions into the African-American southern tradition. Unlike other southern African American artists who found human forms in inanimate objects, namely Bessie Harvey, Archie Byron, and Ralph Griffin, Richard Dial chose metal and mechanics over wood. He found human forms in the mechanics that humans ultimately created and \\"enjoys playing with the magic of wit in a machine-made world.\\"  Exhibitions  * Outside the Main Stream: Folk Art in Our Time.

Some of the largest are the Cathedral in Tampere (1902-1907) and the Kallio Church (1908-1912) in Helsinki, both designed by Lars Sonck. The cathedral is famous for its frescoes, painted by the symbolist Hugo Simberg, featuring versions of The Wounded Angel and The Garden of Death. The altar-piece, representing the future resurrection of people of all races, was painted by Magnus Enckell. Sonck's St Michael's Church in Turku (1894-1905) has Gothic Revival exterior but features National Romantic interior.

One of the most notable is Marfo-Mariinsky Convent in Moscow, katholikon of which was commissioned by Grand Duchess Elizabeth Feodorovna (born near Darmstadt that was the center of Jugendstil at the time) and built by Alexey Shchusev in 1908-1912. He also built many other churches with similar features, e.g. the Trinity Cathedral of Lavra (1906-1912) in Pochayiv featuring mosaics and paintings by Nicholas Roerich, churches in (1911-1913), at of the Battle of Kulikovo (1913‚Äî1917).

While the former churches are Orthodox, there were numerous Old Believers churches built throughout the Empire as the restriction to build them was withdrawn in 1905. Two churches were built by Ilya Bondarenko in Moscow. Franz (Fyodor) Schechtel built an Old Believers chapel at the upper floor of the house of tycoon Stepan Ryabushinsky. As Saint Petersburg was situated close to the border with Grand Duchy of Finland, there was a strong influence of its National Romantic style on local Art Nouveau Architecture, to temples as well. In Russian National Romantic style is called Severny modern literally meaning \\"Northern Art Nouveau\\". Though the Saint Petersburg Mosque (1909-1920) by Nikolai Vasilyev has Iranian architecture, some of its features are clearly National Romantic.Vityzeva V.A.

Under the old municipal borders, it was one of the westernmost suburbs of the city and bordered Roodepoort.  Location  At its widest, the suburb covers 1.7 km from northwest to southeast, but only 600 m from northeast to southwest. It borders Delarey (formerly Roodepoort) on the northwest, while all the others were once suburbs of Johannesburg: Newlands and Montclare (named after Claremont) on the north, Newclare on the east, Bosmont on the southeast, and Industria North to the southwest.  History  Claremont and Newlands border each other just like Claremont and Newlands do in Cape Town. In Pretoria, this is not the case, since Claremont is a lower- middle-class western suburb between Booysens and Daspoort and Newlands is a wealthy neighborhood east of N1 road between Waterkloof Park and Waterkloof Glen. The Johannesburg suburb of Claremont was laid out by H. de V. Steytler in 1896 as part of the 106-ha plot No. 211 of the 1,200-ha Waterval Estate. In 1906, the area was purchased by the African Land and Investment Company, and in 1944 it was annexed by the Johannesburg City Council.  Demographics  Claremont was never very large in the early years, with only 64 Afrikaans- speakers and 22 English-speakers in 1934, which rose to 97:19 in 1949 and 127:58 in 1961. Perhaps because of the inclusion of Newlands across the southbound highway, the Claremont Reformed Church was founded as part of the Dutch Reformed Church in South Africa (NGK), though population shrinkage led to this being absorbed in 2011 by the Waterval Reformed Church (NGK) in Newlands. Laerskool Claremont, on Charles Street, still operates as a parallel-medium (English and Afrikaans) school. References  Sources  * Potgieter D.J. (ed.) (1971).

Service began in 2018 with a single trial route, operating with a mixed fleet of low-floor midibuses and accessible paratransit vehicles. In August 2019, service was expanded to four routes, with two additional routes planned. Overview LINX is Simcoe County's inter-community regional transit service which began operations in 2018. It serves a number of communities throughout the county, as well as the cities of Barrie and Orillia. It connects to a number of lower-order local bus services, namely Barrie Transit, Orillia Transit, Midland Penetanguishene Transit, Colltrans (Collingwood), and Wasaga Beach Transit. From its position in Central Ontario, it also connects to higher-order inter-regional transit services that operate within Ontario, including Southern Ontario's GO Transit (the Barrie line and GO bus Route 68) and Northern Ontario's Ontario Northland Sudbury-to-Toronto motor coach route through Barrie and Orillia. It does not have a direct connection to Via Rail, Canada's national passenger railway, whose nearest service is at Washago station in the far north end of the county, which is a stop on the Canadian, Via Rail's transcontinental passenger service. A paratransit service, called LINX+, is also available. While regular LINX buses are already accessible, LINX+ paratransit vehicles are designed to accommodate a larger variety of mobility devices or wheelchairs, and the service follows a more flexible, door-to-door model which is typical for paratransit services. History In 2017, the Simcoe County Council approved a 5-year, $5 million plan to create a regional transit service, which would connect existing, but fragmented, local transit services in the county, as well as communities with no existing transit service. The five proposed routes were scheduled to begin service in staggered fashion, with roughly one new route being added per year. Detailed plans for the service occurred around the time of a 2018 conference held by the county to help decide on factors like whether or not to use a zone-based fare system, which routes to prioritize, and whether or not to implement Wi-Fi services on the buses. By this time, there were 5 proposed routes, which correspond roughly to the currently existing and planned routes, with the exception that Routes 2 and 4 were at the time planned to be a single Route 2, which would stretch from Collingwood to Barrie. The plan was based primarily around connecting pre-existing hub areas: Collingwood-Wasaga Beach, Penetanguishene-Midland, Barrie-Midhurst, and Orillia. This would allow riders to transfer to another LINX route at a hub, or to local or intercity transit. During its first year of service, ridership on Route 1 averaged 700‚Äì800 passengers per five-day service week. In August 2019, Routes 2 and 3 were introduced, while the already-existing Route 4 was brought under the LINX banner. This was a slightly accelerated service rollout compared to what was projected in 2017 and 2018. These routes were remarked on as useful for commuters and intercity travellers entering or exiting the region, with new destinations such Napoleon Home Comfort (which employs over 700 people) and the Allandale Waterfront GO Station, Barrie's primary intercity transit station which serves as the northern terminus for the GO Barrie line, as well as a stop for the Route 68 GO bus. The Orillia‚ÄìBarrie route has a number of connection points for Orillia Transit, Barrie Transit, GO Transit, and Ontario Northland motor coach service. To encourage ridership on the new routes, free service was introduced on them from August 6 to September 2. =Future= Two new routes are planned for the near future, Route 5 ‚Äì Alliston to Bradford West Gwillimbury and Route 6 ‚Äì Midland to Orillia. These routes will run roughly east-west through the further reaches of South and North Simcoe respectively, in the south providing basic transit service while also acting as a feeder for the GO Barrie line at Bradford GO Station, and in the north creating a triangle of routes between Barrie, Midland-Penetanguishene, and Orillia. In planning documents from 2018, Simcoe County transit planners indicated possible future routes which could be created by around 2023, such as a route from Alliston to Barrie (much of which would be served by Routes 2 and 5 already unless they are realigned) and an Innisfil route which would connect to the possible future GO railway station there and serve areas throughout Innisfil. Possible future routes that could be created by around 2023‚Äì2028 would include a route from Barrie to Bradford running along Ontario Highway 27 through Cookstown (roughly paralleling the GO Route 68 bus, which runs to the east) and a route from the possible future Collingwood‚ÄìWasaga Beach transit hub to Fennell, which would pass through Creemore, Lisle, Everett, Alliston, and Cookstown. Finally, potential routes planned for the distant future beyond 2028 include routes around Orillia and Bradford. Portions of some distant-future routes are now covered by current and near- future routes. Transit planners also mentioned potentially introducing a fare integration program with Metrolinx for riders transferring to GO Transit, similar to the agreement which is in place between Metrolinx and the TTC. Fares LINX uses a zone-based fare system, resulting in cash fares of $2, $4, or $6 depending on the number of zones travelled through. Riders who use the reloadable LINX Card have an automatic 10% discount applied to their fare for adults, or 15% for students and seniors (65+). Children 5 and younger are allowed to ride for free. Routes As of August 2019, LINX operates along the following routes: * Route 1 ‚Äì Penetanguishene / Midland to Barrie - Royal Victoria Hospital (RVH) * Route 2 ‚Äì Wasaga Beach to Barrie * Route 3 ‚Äì Orillia to Barrie * Route 4 ‚Äì Collingwood to Wasaga Beach Two additional routes are planned: * Route 5 ‚Äì Alliston to Bradford West Gwillimbury * Route 6 ‚Äì Midland to Orillia Vehicle fleet The LINX fleet is composed of diesel buses from a variety of manufacturers, almost all of which were purchased through the Metrolinx Transit Procurement Initiative, through which Metrolinx, Ontario's provincial public transportation agency for the Golden Horseshoe region, coordinates procurement of transit vehicles for smaller rural and suburban transit agencies to reduce their procurement costs. The LINX fleet procurement strategy was based around a need for smaller vehicles to reflect its lower- population areas of operation, as well as the higher need for paratransit vehicles. The fleet planned for the LINX soft service launch in August 2018 was four Grande West Vicinity midibuses, a Canadian-designed version of the fuel-efficient, mid-sized bus type often used for rural and suburban routes in Europe. The Vicinity's capacity is 25 passengers, and it can accommodate a maximum of two wheelchairs. Two Dodge Ram ProMaster cargo vans, adapted for paratransit service and rebranded as the Creative Carriage CS-2 (Community Shuttle 2), were also purchased for the start of full revenue service in September 2018. These adapted ProMasters are able to carry 7 passengers, including 3 wheelchairs. In total, 14 conventional buses and 8 specialized buses were planned to be purchased in 2018 over the 4 years to follow. In its second procurement stage in 2019, LINX received several Alexander Dennis Enviro200 midibuses, a model common in the United Kingdom. It also received additional ProMaster/CS-2 specialized paratransit units.

It was released on June 4, 2019. The novel focuses on Emma Saylor Payne, and her summer with her mothers family, after her summer plans are canceled and her father scrambles to find a solution before he leaves the country. As her only option she spends the summer with her maternal grandmother, whom she last saw years earlier at her mother's funeral. Over the summer she reconnects with relatives and friends she hadn't seen in years and learns more about her past and connects the idea of her mother with the truth.  Plot summary  At 17-years-old Emma Saylor Payne is stuck with no place to go after her summer plans fell through and her father, stepmother and grandmother all leaving the country. It is decided that she spend the summer up at North Lake; her mothers childhood home, with her cousins, aunts and maternal grandmother. Emma Saylor doesn't remember much about her mother, who died when she was twelve, but she does remember some of the stories that her mother would tell her about a big lake, and upon arriving at the lake she realizes that her mothers stories don't paint the full picture. There are two communities at the lake; her mother grew up in working class North Lake, while her father spent the summers in wealthier Lake North resort. The more time that Emma Saylor spends at North Lake the more time it feels like she is divided into two people; Emma, who her father has raised and grown to know and Saylor, the name her mother called her and maternal family has adopted. However, with the help of Roo Price, the boy who was her best friend at four during her first time at the lake she learns more about her past and reconciles her two images of herself.

The town that Emma Saylor stays at for the summer is split between North Lake and Lake North, with the locals and less monetarily well off on one side and the new country clubs and more monetarily well off individuals on the other. Another major theme that is traced throughout the book is about mental health and addiction as Emma Saylor recounts her mothers personal struggles with drugs, alcohol and repeatedly going to rehab, before dying of a heroin overdose when Emma Saylor was 12-years-old. Dessen also brings it up as many of the friends and relatives Emma Saylor meets adhere to the \\"No Drinking and Boating\\" Rule and bring up the alcohol based accident that killed Roo's father. Dessen claimed that she was inspired by her concern of a larger showing of younger people in the obituary papers she read and wanted to highlight the \\"epidemic\\" of addiction within the United States.

Born in Sheffield, Lismer became a mechanical engineer and in about 1902 joined the Steam Engine Makers' Society. In 1905, he joined the Independent Labour Party, but he was part of the minority who left in 1911 to join the British Socialist Party, resigning from this group in 1914. He became increasingly involved in trade unionism, and in 1912 was elected to the executive of the Sheffield Trades and Labour Council. During World War I, Lismer was elected as the president of the Engineering Trades Amalgamation Committee, which sought to bring together shop stewards from across the engineering trades. This body was later renamed as the Sheffield Shop Stewards' and Workers' Committee, and he worked closely with J. T. Murphy to establish the movement on a national basis, linking up with the Clyde Workers' Committee and other local organisations to form the Shop Stewards' and Workers' Committees. In 1917, the Sheffield committee organised a major strike, in protest at the conscription of workers who had volunteered for munitions work in the factories. The strike spread nationwide, and led to meetings of 20,000 workers in Sheffield alone. Lismer was a founder of the Sheffield branch of the Communist Party of Great Britain (CPGB) in 1920, and was also elected as vice chair of the Sheffield trades council. The following year, he was elected as the organising secretary of the new British Bureau of the Red International of Labour Unions, frequently working from Manchester. He was removed from this post in 1922, but instead became the organising secretary of the party's Sheffield district, and was placed on the Control Commission of the CPGB. In 1924, he moved to Manchester, but retained links with Sheffield, and was arrested there during the 1926 UK general strike. Lismer entered an extramarital relationship, and in response, the CPGB removed him from his posts.Andrew Flinn and Kevin Morgan, \\"George Hardy\\", in: Dictionary of Labour Biography, vol.XI, p.103 He moved to Chelsea, and became active in the local Labour Party, while remaining broadly supportive of communism, and active in International Class War Prisoners Aid.

It belongs to the family Axinidae. Systematics Allopseudaxine macrova was described from the gills of the Kawakawa Euthynnus affinis off India, as Uraxine chura maacrova. Unnithan placed Uraxine chura maacrova in the subfamily Monaxininae within Axinidae. Yamaguti considered this subspecies a synonym of Uraxine chura, transferred it to the genus Allopseudaxine and created the combination Allopseudaxine macrova. He included Allopseudaxine macrova in his new subfamily Allopseudaxininae, in Axinidae. Description The body of Allopseudaxine macrova comprises an anterior part which contains most organs, and a posterior part called the haptor. The haptor is delimited from the body by a constriction and bears a single row of clamps. The clamps of the haptor attach the animal to the gill of the fish. A short terminal lappet is present, and is armed with two pairs of hooks. There are also two buccal suckers at the anterior extremity. The digestive organs include an anterior mouth, a pharynx, an oesophagus and a posterior intestine that bifurcates at or near level of genital pore in two lateral branches. Each adult contains male and female reproductive organs. The reproductive organs include an anterior genital atrium armed with a corona of 17 hooks, two unarmed vaginal pores, with sub marginal dorsal longitudinal slit like apertures, situated behind the penis on each side of the body but not at the same level, a looped ovary and numerous testes para and post-ovarian. The eggs are spindle-shaped, with filaments at both poles. Hosts and localities The Kawakawa Euthynnus affinis is the type host of Allopseudaxine katsuwonis The type-host is the Kawakawa Euthynnus affinis (Scombridae). The type locality is off India.

It was founded in 1852. Tortugas Pueblo, as it is commonly referred to as, was the area of land that was granted to tribal members of the Piro/Manso/Tiwa tribe in Las Cruces. Originally Tortugas was made up of two Native villages, the Pueblo of Guadalupe and the Pueblo of San Juan de Guadalupe. Many of the people living in Tortugas today are members and descendants of the tribe, as well as descendants of various other tribes in the surrounding area including Jumanos, Sumas, Apaches, Conchos, and Rar√°muri. Despite being considered extinct Manso Indians are part of the population that make up members of the Tortugas community. The area of land in present-day Las Cruces down the Rio Grande into Juarez, Mexico was the territory of the Manso people before the Spanish came through and before other tribes began moving in. The Tiwa (or Tigua) from Isleta Pueblo and Piro people from near Socorro, New Mexico moved into the area after the Pueblo Revolt, when many Native Spanish allies as well and Native slaves of the Spanish, also known as genizaros, traveled south from Santa Fe into Paso del Norte (present day El Paso) where missions were established for the Natives in the area to attend. Many people in Tortugas are also descendants of Ysleta del Sur Pueblo, a pueblo in Texas that was established after the Pueblo Revolt as well. Despite not being federally recognized, Tortugas has maintained its Native cultural heritage and traditions and has thrived as an inter-tribal community. The current cacique is Patrick Narvaez. Tortugas is home of the Tortugas Pueblo Fiesta of Our Lady of Guadalupe, a feast day celebration observed every year on December 10-12 that incorporates Native traditions with Catholic influence. There are four dance groups in Tortugas that dance during the ceremony, including the Pueblo Indian dancers, the Danzantes, the Danzantes Guadalupana, and the Danzantes Chichimecas. The latter two being matachines dance groups. Tortugas is just south of the New Mexico State University and Interstate 10. It is by an oxbow of the Rio Grande, which in the past had many turtles (\\"tortugas\\" in Spanish).

He did not return to England immediately to finish his degree course, but took two years out in order to spend more time documenting life in China through the medium of photography. He returned to SOAS in Autumn 1987 to complete the last two years of his degree course, and so was absent from China during the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests. After completing his degree in Summer 1989, Bradshaw pursued a career as a photojournalist in China, where he lived and worked for most of the next twenty-five years, based in Beijing (1989‚Äì1997 and 2000‚Äì2014) and Shanghai (1997‚Äì2000). He mainly worked as a freelance photographer, but in 2003 he set up an office in Beijing for the European Pressphoto Agency. He returned to England with his wife and two children in 2014, and is now based in Oxford. Exhibitions In order to celebrate the 40th anniversary of China‚Äôs reform and opening-up, an exhibition of Bradshaw's photography was put on at the 4th Shanghai Fashion Weekend held at the Shanghai Exhibition Center in October 2018. An exhibition of his street photography taken in China during the 1980s was held by the Confucius Institute at Oxford Brookes University in October 2018.

It was created by Yamaguti in 1965, to include Allopseudaxinoides euthynni Morphology Species of Allopseudaxinoides are ectoparasites that affect their host by attaching themselves as larvae on the gills of the fish and grow into adult stage. This larval stage is called oncomiracidium, and is characterized as free swimming and ciliated. The name Allopseudaxine is composed of a root Allopseudaxine: a monogenean genus, and the suffix oides which means resembling. Thus, the name Allopseudaxinoides means resembling Allopseudaxine. In fact, species of Allopseudaxine have a large body tapering anteriorly, and a unilateral, oblique haptor, (which means that they have a single oblique row of clamps,) giving them a triangular appearance. By this triangular shape, they resemble Allopseudaxine. However, species of Allopseudaxinoides can be distinguished from Allopseudaxine by a complete absence of vaginae or the presence of rudimentary ones, the presence of thickenings of clamps capsule, and an accessory clamp sclerite.

The Goodtime III is the third generation of sightseeing ships that cruise and tour Lake Erie and the Cuyahoga River. The boat can hold 1,000 passengers, has four decks and indoor and outdoor seating. Tours of the Cleveland area waterways are narrated and include local and natural history. The boats and the cruise tours have been owned and operated by the Fryan family since 1958.  About  Goodtime III is the largest excursion boat in Cleveland, Ohio and is able to hold up to 1,000 passengers. The four-deck ship is equipped with 3 bars and 2 dance floors. Its dimensions are 151-by-40 feet. The boat provides sightseeing tours of the Cuyahoga River and Lake Erie that include both local and natural history of the region. There is both indoor and outdoor seating and a dining area. The Goodtime III averages about 300 tours a year.  History  The Goodtime III is part of a series of ships named Goodtime, Goodtime I and Goodtime II. The first Goodtime tour took place on the Goodtime I in 1958 when brothers, Vince and Herb Fryan started taking the 150-passenger boat out for tours on Lake Erie and the Cuyahoga River. The Fryan brothers sold the Goodtime I in 1965, keeping only the larger Goodtime II. The Goodtime II could hold up to 475 guests. Goodtime II was renamed Liberty Bell II and the first Goodtime was still operating in Sandusky, Ohio in the 1990s. These ships were in turn named after another Goodtime that carried passengers on Lake Erie and was run by the Cleveland and Buffalo Transit Company between 1924 and 1938. This passenger boat was originally named the City of Detroit II and had been built in 1889. The Fryan brothers sold the business to Vince's son, Jim Fryan in 1984. Rick Fryan, grandson of Vince, currently runs the Goodtime III. He started working as a deckhand and salesman for the company in 1986. Jim Fryan decided to build Goodtime III in 1988. Goodtime III arrived in Cleveland, Ohio in 1991 and was anchored at the Ninth Street Pier. It started public cruises in 1992. During the 1990s, the ship was captained by Bruce Hudec, who started working on the ship as a deckhand in 1971. In 2013, Hudec started training Jordan Kit to work as a captain.

A specialist in criminal law, he was named a \\"National Distinguished Legal Scholar\\", the highest honour of the China Law Society.  Biography  Su was born on 17 September 1934 in Suzhou, Jiangsu, Republic of China. After graduating from the Department of Law of Peking University in 1959, he was hired as a faculty member by the university. From 1963, he worked as a legal researcher at the Jiangsu Superior People's Court. In April 1965, he became a faculty member of the East China University of Political Science and Law (ECUPL) in Shanghai. In April 1972, Su was transferred to Fudan University. In June 1979, he returned to ECUPL where he served as Director of Criminal Law. He was promoted to associate professor in 1982 and full professor in 1986. In 1993, he was awarded a special pension for the country's top scholars by the State Council of the People's Republic of China. He was named a distinguished professor in 2004, shortly before his retirement in December that year. Su published dozens of books and more than 100 research papers. In 1994, he served as chief editor of Criminal Law (). It has been used as the standard textbook on the subject in Chinese universities, and won the National Excellent Textbook award. In 1996, he participated in the revision of China's criminal code. In May 2019, Su was named a \\"National Distinguished Legal Scholar\\", the highest honour of the China Law Society. He was in poor health at the time, and the award was presented to him at Ruijin Hospital where he was hospitalized. He died less than a month later, on 19 June 2019, at the age of 84.  Defence of Li Zuopeng  After the end of the Cultural Revolution, Su participated in the historic trial of the Gang of Four and the Lin Biao clique from November 1980 to January 1981. He and Zhang Sizhi served as a defence attorneys for General Li Zuopeng, a key associate of Lin Biao. During the trial, Su and Zhang did not deny the charge that Li was \\"one of the principal culprits of the Lin Biao counter-revolutionary clique\\", and Li admitted that he framed marshals Ye Jianying and He Long, and general Luo Ruiqing, who were all persecuted during the Cultural Revolution. However, Su and Zhang argued that Li was merely following Lin Biao's orders and that he later took the initiative to reveal his own crimes. In the end, Li was sentenced to 17 years in prison.  View on capital punishment  Su regarded capital punishment as \\"irrational\\" and supported the eventual abolition of capital punishment in China; however, he argued that the goal should be achieved \\"step by step\\" over a long period of time, solely because the general public widely believed in \\"the retributive and deterrent effect of the death penalty\\".

The village has a population of around 300. In 1931 the parish had a population of 929. The village of Messing lies amongst picturesque countryside just 15 miles from Chelmsford and 1 mile from Tiptree. It is a small and charming village steeped in history, with a population of around 300 people and a few local amenities such as a pub and church. It shares its parish with the tiny village of Inworth, which has a population of around 100 people and is home to several small businesses. The village of Messing was named as Essex's Best Kept Village in 2007 and 2008 and the Essex Village of the Year in 2018. It was the birthplace of Reynold Bush, ancestor to former presidents of the USA, George H.W. Bush and George W. Bush. The village church, named All Saints' Church, boasts character and tradition and, apart from its brick clock tower, was built entirely of rubble that was taken from a nearby Roman villa. Dating back to the 14th century, the whole church was refurbished in 1840 and, in the process, was fitted with new features that still remain today, such as a paved chancel of black and white marble and a stained-glass window that represents the Acts of Mercy (St Matthew 25:35, 36), and in the top part ‚Äì Faith, Hope and Charity. It is believed that this window may have originally been at New Hall School in Chelmsford, until it was carefully removed in 1648 during the siege of Colchester in the English Civil War. It was then hidden in the church‚Äôs great chest, together with other treasures, in order it preserve it from destruction. Even though Messing is nestled deep within the Essex countryside, the small village has excellent links to London from the neighbouring town of Kelvedon, which is home to the nearest railway station. From here, the journey by train to London Liverpool Street takes 45 minutes. By car, the city of Chelmsford is located just 15 miles from the village, and Colchester, Britain‚Äôs oldest recorded town is 8.5 miles away. Stansted airport is a 40-minute drive away, with other London airports such as Heathrow, Gatwick and Southend each accessible by car in under 90 minutes. Messing is situated just 1 mile from the village of Tiptree, which has been a regular contender for officially being named ‚Äòthe largest village in England‚Äô. The village is known worldwide for its jam, marmalades and preserves, sold by the company Wilkin & Sons. The Wilkin family came to Tiptree to start farming in the early 1700s and established the renowned company in 1885. Supposedly a derivative from the Saxons, the name ‚ÄòMessing‚Äô translates to ‚ÄòM√¶cca's people‚Äô. Popular tradition relates this to a battle between the Romans and Queen Boudicca on a nearby site called The Rampart. The village itself holds a traditional fair every year on the first Tuesday in July, which features toy and cake stalls and crafts and activities.  Features  Messing has a church called All Saints and a pub called The Old Crown.  History  The name \\"Messing\\" means 'Maecca's people'.Eilert Ekwall, The Concise Oxford Dictionary of English Place-names, pp.323 and 318. Messing was recorded in the Domesday Book as Metcinges. On 24 March 1889 part of the parish was transferred to Birch parish, Quashey Corner was transferred from Great Wigborough parish and Kelvedon Road, &c; Houses were transferred to Inworth parish. On 1 April 1934 part of the parish was transferred to Layer Marney and part became the new parish of Messing cum Inworth and part became the new parish of Tiptree. On 1 April 1946 the parish was abolished and the remaining 3 acres merged with Birch parish. The history of Messing has been published twice, in Roger Carter‚Äôs Simply Messing and William Goldsborough Whittam‚Äôs The Story of Messing. The village is close to a site called ‚ÄòThe Rampart‚Äô, which according to legend is where Boudicca, Queen of the Iceni, was defeated by the Romans.Messing-cum-Inworth Community Website: Messing Village Reynald Bush, the first ancestor of the American Bush family, immigrated to America in 1631 from this village on the ship Lyon. St Albans Lodge on School Road was built in 1880 as a private residence, before being taken over by Essex County Council as a children's home and later a training centre. As of 2018 it has been restored as a residence. Messing Primary School There has been a school, of one sort or another, in Messing since approx. 1837. The current school was opened in 1914 and celebrated its centenary in 2014 with a number of celebrations for villagers and former pupils and staff. As part of this, a book celebrating the history of Messing School was written and researched by local historian Tony Tuckwell. It was expected to be published towards the end of 2014. The current building in School Road was built in 1914 and serves the villages of Messing, Inworth and the wider community. The Edwardian school building consists of three classrooms, a library, an office, a medical room, a staff room, community room and a separate hall. There is also a new computer room to enhance the children's learning of ICT. The community room is equipped with a kitchen and a toilet and has access to an outside play area. This room is currently used for Reception and Key Stage 1 pupils and provides them with an outside play space as well as additional space for art and ICT. The school is situated in picturesque, rural surroundings. The pupils have their own playing field that is used for sports, outside activities, f√™tes and events. The grounds are also home to a play area, sensory garden and outside classroom. The location is ideal for environmental and wildlife studies. The school has strong links with the village community, sharing social occasions with local groups. There is an active Parent and Friends' Association who receive excellent support from the local community. Close links with secondary schools in the area, including Thurstable School in Tiptree, prepares pupils for a smooth transition to secondary education.http://www.messingprimaryschool.co.uk An Academy In 2013, Messing Primary School became an Academy, sponsored by New Hall School, a leading independent boarding and day school in Chelmsford. As an Academy, the school has greater freedom to run the school as they think best, drawing on New Hall School's excellent educational record and sharing expertise and facilities. Pupils benefit through shared sporting, music and community ventures with New Hall School. There has been improved access to ICT resources during teaching and learning sessions, increased tracking as part of the continual assessment of each child and greater parental involvement. The partnership means pupils from Messing can use the outstanding facilities on offer at New Hall, including their 25-metre indoor swimming pool where they can receive swimming lessons, free of charge, from the dedicated swimming coaches at New Hall.

He was appointed Archdeacon of Toledo and of Santiago de Compostela. He was made Abbot nullius of Alcal√° la Real and of Burgohondo on 28 March 1734. He was Major chaplain of the Royal Monastery of La Encarnaci√≥n, Madrid, and the king's Sumiller de cortina. King Philip V of Spain named him his almoner and major chaplain. The king nominated Mendoza to the patriarchate of the West Indies in November 1733. He was appointed Patriarch of the West Indies and Titular Archbishop of Pharsalus on 20 January 1734. As patriarch he succeeded Carlos de Borja y Centellas, who had died on 8 August 1733. He was ordained bishop on 9 May 1734 at the Royal Monastery of La Encarnaci√≥n, Madrid. His principal consecrator was Archbishop Domingo Valent√≠n Guerra Arteaga y Leiba, Bishop of Segovia. His principal co-consecrators were Benito Madue√±o y Ramos, Titular Bishop of Sion, and Dionisio Francisco Mellado Egu√≠luz, Titular Bishop of Lares. King Ferdinand VI of Spain requested Mendoza's promotion to the cardinalate. Mendoza attended the consistory of April 1747. On 10 April 1747 he was elevated to Cardinal. The king gave him the red biretta of this rank in a ceremony on 16 August 1747 in the church of San Jer√≥nimo el Real in Madrid. He never traveled to Rome to receive the red hat from the Pope. He was unable to attend the conclave of 1758 in which Pope Clement XIII was elected. Mendoza died on 23 January 1761 in the Buen Retiro Palace in Madrid, and was buried in his mother's tomb in the monastery of San Gil, Madrid. He was succeeded as Patriarch of the West Indies by Buenaventura Fern√°ndez de C√≥rdoba Sp√≠nola, who was appointed on 6 April 1761.

CTH is a torsatron type of stellarator with an external, continuously wound helical coil that generates the bulk of the magnetic field for containing a plasma.  Background  Toroidal magnetic confinement fusion devices create magnetic fields that lie in a torus. These magnetic fields consist of two components, one component points in the direction that goes the long way around the torus (the toroidal direction), while the other component points in the direction that is the short way around the torus (the poloidal direction). The combination of the two components creates a helically shaped field. (You might imagine taking a flexible stick of candy cane and connecting the two ends.) Stellarator type devices generate all required magnetic fields with external magnetic coils. This is different from tokamak devices where the toroidal magnetic field is generated by external coils and the poloidal magnetic field is produced by an electrical current flowing through the plasma. A drawing showing the CTH vacuum vessel (shown in grey) and magnetic field coils.HF(red) - Helical Field,TF - Toroidal Field,OH1,2,3 - Ohmic Transformer Coils, MVF - Main Vertical Field, TVF - Trim Vertical Field, SVF - Shaping Vertical Field, RF - Radial Field, EF, Equilibrium Field, ECC - Error Correction Coil  The CTH device The main magnetic field in CTH is generated by a continuously wound helical coil. An auxiliary set of ten coils produces a toroidal field much like that of a tokamak. This toroidal field is used to vary the rotational transform of the confining magnetic field structure. CTH typically operates at a magnetic field of 0.5 to 0.6 tesla at the center of the plasma. CTH can be operated as a pure stellarator, but also has ohmic heating transformer system to drive electrical current in the plasma. This current produces a poloidal magnetic field that, in addition to heating the plasma, changes the rotational transform of the magnetic field. CTH researchers study how well the plasma is confined while they vary the source of rotational transform from external coils to plasma current. The CTH vacuum vessel is made of Inconel 625, which has a higher electrical resistance and lower magnetic permeability than stainless steel. Plasma formation and heating is achieved using 14 GHz, 10 kW electron cyclotron resonance heating (ECRH). A 200 kW gyrotron has recently been installed on CTH. Ohmic heating on CTH has an input power of 100 kW. =Operations= * Plasmas electron temperatures are typically up to 200 electronvolts with electron densities up to 5 m‚àí3. * Plasmas last between 60 ms and 100 ms * It takes 6 min-7 min to store enough energy to power the magnet coils =Subsystems= The following gives a list of subsystems needed for CTH operation. * a set of 10 GE752 motors with attached 1-ton flywheels to store energy and produce currents for magnetic field generation * two 18 GHz klystrons for Electron cyclotron resonance heating * gyrotron for 2nd harmonic Electron cyclotron resonance heating * a 2 kV, 50 ŒºF capacitor bank and a 1 kV, 3 F capacitor bank to power the ohmic system * a 640 channel data acquisition system =Diagnostics= The CTH has a large set of diagnostics to measure properties of plasma and magnetic fields. The following gives a list of major diagnostics. * 4-channel Interferometer for electron density measurements * two color soft-X-ray camera for tomography and temperature profile * soft x-ray spectrometer * hard x-ray detector * Coils for measuring Mirnov oscillations in the plasma * Rogowski coils for determining plasma current * Passive spectroscopy for temperature and density measurements, and tungsten erosion diagnostic measurements * Langmuir probe (triple) =V3FIT= Last closed magnetic flux surfaces as reconstructed by the V3FIT code without (left) and with (right) plasma current. The coloration depicts the strength of the magnetic field with red being the strongest field and blue being the weakest. Sample field lines are shown in white. V3FIT is a code to reconstruct the equilibrium between the plasma and confining magnetic field in cases where the magnetic field is toroidal in nature, but not axisymmetric as is the case with tokamak equilibria. Because stellarators are non-axisymmetric, the CTH group uses the V3FIT and VMEC codes for reconstructing equilibria. The V3FIT code uses as inputs the currents in the magnetic confinement coils, the plasma current, and data from the various diagnostics such as the Rogowski coils, SXR cameras, and interferometer. The output of the V3FIT code includes the structure of the magnetic field, and profiles of the plasma current, density, and SXR emissivity. Data from the CTH experiment was and continues to be used as a testbed for the V3FIT code which has also used for equilibrium reconstruction on the Helically Symmetric eXperiment (HSX), Large Helical Device (LHD), and Wendelstein 7-X (W7-X) stellarators, and the Reversed-Field eXperiment (RFX) and Madison Symmetric Torus (MST) reversed field pinches. Goals and major achievements CTH has made and continues to make fundamental contributions to the physics of current carrying stellarators. CTH researchers have studied disruption limits and characterizations as a function of the externally applied rotational transform (due to external magnet coils) for: * Low safety factor (low-q) tokamak-like disruption avoidance * Vertical displacement events (VDEs) Ongoing experiments CTH students and staff work on a number of experimental and computational research projects. Some of these are solely in house while others are in collaboration with other universities and national laboratories in the United States and abroad. Current research projects include: * Density limit studies as a function of the vacuum rotational transform * Using spectroscopic techniques to measure tungsten erosion with the DIII-D group * Measuring plasma flows with a Coherence Imaging system on CTH and on the W-7X stellarator * Heavy ion transport studies on the W-7X stellarator * Studying transition regions between fully ionized and neutrally dominated plasmas * Implementation of a 4th channel for the interferometer system * 2nd harmonic electron cyclotron resonance heating with a gyrotron  History  CTH is the third torsatron device to be built at Auburn University. Previous Magnetic Confinement Devices built at the university were: =The Auburn Torsatron (1983‚Äì1990)= The Auburn Torsatron had an l=2, m=10 helical coil. The vacuum vessel had a major radius was Ro = 0.58 m with a minor radius of av=0.14 m. The magnetic field strength was B ‚â§ 0.2 T and plasmas were formed with ECRH using a 2.45 GHz magnetron taken from a microwave oven. The Auburn Torsatron was used to study basic plasma physics and diagnostics, and magnetic surface mapping techniques =The Compact Auburn Torsatron (1990‚Äì2000)= The Compact Auburn Torsatron (CAT) had two helical coils, an l=1,m=5 and an l=2,m=5 whose currents could be controlled independently. Varying the relative currents between the helical coils modified the rotational transform. The vacuum vessel major radius was Ro = 0.53 m with a plasma minor radius of av=0.11 m. The steady state magnetic field strength was B 0.1 T. CAT plasmas were formed with ECRH using a low ripple, 6 kW, 2.45 GHz magnetron source. CAT was used to study magnetic islands, magnetic island minimization, and driven plasma rotations  Other Stellarators Below is a list of other Stellarators in the US and around the world: * Wendelstein 7-X in Greifswald Germany * The Large Helical Device (LDH) in Japan * The National Compact Stellarator Experiment (NCSX) - A device designed and partially built at Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory (PPPL) * The Helically Symmetric Experiment at the University of Wisconsin - Madison * The Hybrid Illinois Device for Research and Applications (HIDRA) experiment at the University of Illinois * The Columbia Non-neutral Torus (CNT) at Columbia University in New York * The Heliotron J experiment in Japan * The TJ-II in Spain * The Stellarator of Costa Rica (SCR-1) * Uragan-2M in the Ukraine  References  External links * CTH website * Physics Department * Auburn University Category:Plasma physics Category:Stellarators Category:Auburn University ","title":"Compact Toroidal Hybrid"},{"id":"61478672","text":"Mikey Lewis (born 4 July 2001) is a rugby league footballer who plays as a for Hull Kingston Rovers in the Betfred Super League.

He is the author of several volumes of poetry and has published many audio recordings of his spoken word performances, and is known for innovative use of technology to present poetry readings. Early life Anderson was born in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Career In 1985, Anderson founded Dial-A-Poem Montreal, a free, 24-hour telephone hotline that users could call to hear a different poem each day, usually read by its author. About 150 poets contributed to the project, mostly from the Montreal area. On its first anniversary, the participants organized the ‚Äú100 Poets\\" party, a gallery event which included eleven continuous hours of recorded audio and video poetry performance as well as live contributions from dozens of attending poets. Dial-A-Poem Montreal was inspired by a similar poetry hotline service operated by performance poet John Giorno in New York from 1968-1972, also called Dial-A-Poem. In 1987 Anderson collaborated with writer Ian Ferrier and illustrator Phillip MacKenzie to publish The Heart of the Machine, an electronic interactive serial novel accessible through one of several information services that users would have to dial in to from their computers. In the 1990s Anderson and Ferrier began broadcasting recordings of poetry on the McGill University campus community radio station, CKUT-FM; the pair received a Standard Broadcasting Award for this innovation.

The station was built in 1916 for the Lake Erie and Northern Railway (an interurban electric railway which was a Canadian Pacific Railway subsidiary) according to a standard Canadian Pacific design, and was later used by the Grand River Railway, which was also a subsidiary of Canadian Pacific. The station, along with the rest of the Lake Erie and Northern system, was closed to passenger traffic in 1955 after a series of final excursion trips. Interurban railway service in the area began when the Grand Valley Railway Company purchased the Brantford Street Railway and extended it northward to Galt via Paris, Ontario, a process which was completed in 1904. By 1912, however, this line had been shut down due to poor track quality, and was ultimately sold to the City of Brantford, and later the Lake Erie and Northern. The Lake Erie and Northern, with its line still under construction in 1914, was purchased by the Canadian Pacific Railway, which was beginning to buy up and consolidate interurban railways. To complement its northern section between Galt and Brantford, the Lake Erie and Northern quickly built a southern section, initially to Simcoe, then to Port Dover, both in mid-1916. The surviving station building dates from this era, and is constructed according to a standard CPR pattern, with a steep roofline and prominent gables. After the station was closed, the building was moved onto private property on Mount Pleasant Road. A local group, the Brant Railway Heritage Society, is hoping to restore or recreate the station building as a railway museum.

Viola is rescued and Sebastian is supposed to have been lost. Among the wreckage on the coast Sebastian‚Äôs trunk is found by Viola. When she opens it and sees her brother‚Äôs clothing, she decides to disguise herself as a boy. Learning that she is within the realm of the young Duke Orsino, she repairs to his castle, where she is employed as his page. The Duke is apparently very much in love with Olivia, a rich countess. Nothing daunted, Viola falls in love with the Duke, who adds to her discomfiture by sending her, as his page, with a message of love to Olivia. As soon as Olivia beholds the handsome young page, she falls in love with Viola, thinking that she is a boy. She presents the page with a jewel, and later, through her pompous steward, Malvolio, with a ring. Sebastian, in search for his sister, meets Viola by chance at the house of Olivia and the two are once more united. Explanations follow, and Olivia finds it an easy matter to transfer her affections to Sebastian, who falls madly in love with Olivia. Orsino finds Olivia in the embrace of Sebastian. Viola now appears before the Duke as herself -a sweet and attractive girl. She tells him of her impersonation of her brother and the page. Orsino is so struck by her beauty and cleverness that he declares his love for her and asks her to become his wife.

History  Sinking Ship Entertainment was founded by Ryerson University graduates J.J. Johnson, Blair Powers, and Matt Bishop in 2004. The name \\"Sinking Ship\\" was chosen when Johnson and Powers were pitching a project in their final year at Ryerson and trying to convince their peers to pick up the remaining crew roles. A classmate warned a fellow classmate who was interested to not join the team as it'd be like joining a sinking ship. In September 2004, Sinking Ship Entertainment debuted their first series This is Daniel Cook. Cook's passion for dinosaurs inspired the creation of Dino Dan, their first live-action CGI blended series. The series was released in 2010 on Nick Jr. and led to the opening of the company's visual effects division. In 2016, Sinking Ship Entertainment entered the feature film market with the release of Odd Squad: The Movie. Since then, SSE has also released Odd Squad: World Turned Odd and Dino Dana The Movie. In February 2016, Sinking Ship Entertainment launched a distribution division after acquiring Picture Box Distribution. On May 2, 2019, Sinking Ship launched an animation series division.

The community has gone through periods of growth, especially in the last quarter of the 20th century. Today, the well-established community includes schools, temples, and other organizations and has a population of approximately 25,500. It is the 43rd largest Jewish community in the United States and the third largest in Ohio, trailing Cleveland and Cincinnati. History The Jewish community in Columbus began with the settlement of the Nusbaums and the Gundersheimers in 1840, six years after the city's 1834 establishment. Like Cleveland's first Jews, these immigrants came from Bavaria. 4 synagogues were created in the 19th century; B‚Äônai Jeshurun, Temple Israel, Agudas Achim, and Beth Jacob. After World War II, many Jews moved east into Bexley, Berwick, and Eastmoor, where many Jews and Jewish organizations remain today. Between 1975 and 2000, the Jewish population grew by 60%. A factor in this growth was the immigration of Soviet Jews after the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991. About 1,400 of these immigrants came to Columbus during this period. Today the population of 25,500 contributes to numerous local Jewish organizations. The modern Jewish community is based mostly in New Albany, Bexley, Gahanna, and certain neighborhoods in the city of Columbus. Jewish Institutions The community is home to many types of Jewish Institutions including schools, temples, and organizations. JewishColumbus is a leading organization and is a result of the merger of the Columbus Jewish Federation and the Columbus Jewish Foundation Synagogues in the region include: * Ahavas Sholom - Orthdox, Bexley * Agudas Achim - Traditional-Egalitarian, Bexley * Beth Jacob Synagogue - Orthodox, Columbus * Beth Tikvah - Reform, Worthington * Temple Beth Shalom - Reform, New Albany * Temple Israel - Reform, Columbus * Tifereth Israel - Conservative, Columbus * Torat Emet - Orthodox, Bexley There are two Jewish schools, Columbus Torah Academy, an Orthodox K-12 school, and Columbus Jewish Day School, a K-6 Jewish Day School.

These include the New York Mets (an interest was acquired in 1980, and it became full owner in 2002), the Brooklyn Cyclones, SportsNet New York (a regional sports TV network it formed in 2005), Sterling Project Development, and a number of real estate investment portfolios and real estate services businesses (it has developed nearly 25 million square feet of commercial property). Citi Field It was founded in 1972 by Fred Wilpon (Chairman) and Saul Katz (President), Wilpon's brother-in-law. It has developed a number of properties, including the tower at 450 Lexington Avenue. It built Citi Field $40 million under budget, and took over development of a Willets Point project.  Madoff Ponzi Scheme  Sterling Equities was embroiled in the Bernie Madoff scandal. Madoff trustee Irving Picard alleged that the Sterling Equities had pocketed millions in fictitious profits. Sterling Equities had opened accounts with Bernard Madoff for themselves, their businesses, their friends and family, and business associates. Sterling was associated with 483 Madoff accounts. For example, Sterling Equities partner Greg Katz had 31 accounts with Madoff dating from 1992 and withdrew over $23 million in illegal profit. The Sterling Equities opened accounts for their wives and families. Valerie Wilpon, Amy Beth Katz, and Heath Katz Knopf all had accounts with Bernard Madoff. According to Picard, Sterling Equities used funds withdrawn from their wives‚Äô accounts to meet their personal and/or business financial obligations. The Sterling Equities had a close personal relationship with Bernard Madoff. Madoff had Mets season tickets with seats near the owners box. Madoff and his wife, Ruth, traveled to Japan with the Wilpon's and Katz's. Sterling assisted Madoff with securing office space in Manhattan's Lipstick Building. The Madoff's, Katz's, and Wilpon's were involved in several charities together. They attended movies together and had houses close together in Florida. By 2008, Sterling Equities had withdrawn approximately $300 million in fictitious profits. In 2012, Sterling Equities including Saul Katz, Greg Katz, Fred Wilpon and Jeff Wilpon settled a lawsuit by trustee Irving Picard that alleged that they had invested in Madoff's Ponzi scheme even though it knew the returns were fraudulent. Despite the allegations they were aware of Madoff's fraud and beneficiaries of it, Sterling asked the US Supreme Court to reverse a court decision and allow them access to a special fund set up for Madoff victims.

History According to some sources Kilmokea, or Mileadoc was the spot at which Cessair, the granddaughter of Noah, escaping the flood, made the first incursion or invasion into Ireland in 2242 B.C. In the 6th Century an early ecclesiastical enclosure was established in the townland of Great Island when it was an actual island. In the 8th Century a church was founded here by Suadbar, hence the reference in the name by a Kil (), the Gaelic word for church. It was the church of Mac Aodh (Hugh or Mogue).

The SRCCL provides a comprehensive overview of the entire land-climate system for the first time, and addressed land itself as a \\"critical resource\\". On Wednesday, August 7, 2019 in Geneva, Switzerland the IPCC's 50th session (IPCC-50) adopted the SRCCL's Summary for policymakers (SPM) and approved the underlying report. The SPM and the full text of Special Report on Climate Change and Land‚Äîin an unedited form‚Äîwere released on Thursday, August 8. The report is over 1,300 pages long and includes the work of 107 experts from 52 countries. The IPCC Twitter account announced the release of the report with, \\"Land is where we live. Land is under growing human pressure. Land is a part of the solution. But land can't do it all.\\" The report is the second of three Special Reports in the current Sixth Assessment Report (AR6) cycle which began in 2015 and will be completed in 2022. The first was Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5 ¬∞C, and the third is the Special Report on the Ocean and Cryosphere in a Changing Climate (SROCC) released on September 25, 2019. The AR6 cycle is considered by the IPCC to be their most ambitious since the panel was formed in 1988.The World Meteorological Organization (WMO) and the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) established the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change in 1988. It was endorsed later by the United Nations General Assembly. Membership is open to all members of the WMO and UN. Previous IPCC assessments cycles and special reports Since it was established in 1988, the IPCC provides the governments of their 195 member countries, with periodic comprehensive summaries of scientific assessments of the drivers of climate change, including current impact and potential risks. The reports also put forward possible responses in terms of adaptation and mitigation. The IPCC has published five Assessment Reports, including the 1990 IPCC First Assessment Report (FAR), the 1995 IPCC Second Assessment Report also known as Climate Change 1995, the 2001 Third Assessment Report, the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report (AR4) also known as Climate Change 2007, and the Fifth Assessment Report. Each report also includes the \\"full scientific and technical assessment of climate change, generally in three volumes, one for each of the Working Groups of the IPCC, together with their Summaries for Policymakers, and a Synthesis Report.\\" SRCCL is part of a series of Special Reports and Assessments in the sixth assessment report (AR6) cycle which began in 2015‚Äîfollowing the election of a new Bureau‚Äîand concludes in 2022. The IPCC considers the current assessment cycle to be their most ambitious in the 30-year history of the panel. So far, during this cycle, along with the SRCCL, IPCC has published the Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5 ¬∞C in October 2018, and the May 2019 Refinement. The third in the series, the Special Report on the Ocean and Cryosphere in a Changing Climate (SROCC), is upcoming. As well, in March 2018, the IPCC held a conference in preparation for a special report on cities and climate change in the seventh assessment cycle. Since its inception, the IPCC had also published over a dozen Special Reports which are included in the ARs. The Special report also includes a Summary for policymakers providing an \\"assessment of a specific issue and generally follow the same structure as a volume of an Assessment Report and Methodology Reports which are \\"materials that provide practical guidelines for the preparation of greenhouse gas inventories.\\" Sections =SRCCL summary for policymakers (SPM)= There are four sections in the Summary for Policymakers (SPM). The first deals with \\"people, land and climate in a warming world\\"; the second covers \\"adaptation and mitigation response options\\"; the third focuses on \\"enabling response options\\" and the fourth considers \\"action in the near- term\\". In the first section, the SPM says that human-induced land degradation‚Äîwith increased consumption and population growth causing more land use for \\"food, feed, fibre, timber and energy\\"‚Äîhas negatively affected ice- free land area globally. Approximately \\"25-30% of total food produced is lost or wasted\\" while \\"821 million people are undernourished\\" and \\" 2 billion adults now being overweight or obese.\\" In part two, the SPM says that \\"increased food productivity, dietary choices and food losses and waste reduction, can reduce demand for land conversion.\\" In part 3, suggested response options that will also help eradicate poverty, include \\"improving access to markets, securing land tenure, factoring environmental costs into food, making payments for ecosystem services, and enhancing local and community collective action\\". The SPM says that, \\"Many sustainable land management technologies and practices are profitable within three to 10 years (medium confidence). While they can require upfront investment, actions to ensure sustainable land management can improve crop yields and the economic value of pasture. Land restoration and rehabilitation measures improve livelihood systems and provide both short-term positive economic returns and longer-term benefits in terms of climate change adaptation and mitigation, biodiversity and enhanced ecosystem functions and services.\\" =Chapters= The SRCCL consists of seven chapters, Chapter 1: Framing and Context, Chapter 2: Land-Climate Interactions, Chapter 3: Desertification, Chapter 4: Land Degradation, Chapter 5: Food Security, Chapter 5 Supplementary Material, Chapter 6: Interlinkages between desertification, land degradation, food security and GHG fluxes: Synergies, trade-offs and Integrated Response Options, and Chapter 7: Risk management and decision making in relation to sustainable development. Like all IPCC reports, the SRCCL includes a \\"Summary for Policymakers\\", Chapter 1: Framing and Context In the executive summary of Chapter 1, the authors described the land area on earth as \\"finite\\" saying that sustainable land use is \\"fundamental for human well-being.\\" One of the authors of \\"Framing and Context\\", Karlsruhe Institute of Technology's Almut Arneth, told Deutsche Presse-Agentur (DPA) journalists that \\"The surface of the earth is limited, the population is growing, and more acreage is needed for food and for fibres that can be used for clothing.\\" Chapter 2: Land- Climate Interactions According to the August 8 Carbon Brief in-depth article on the SRCCL, Chapter 2 provides data on livestock methane emissions, about 66% is agricultural methane\\" and \\"about 33% of global methane emissions\\" come from livestock. Chapter 3: Desertification In Chapter 3, the authors said that while climate change is exacerbating desertification, there are technologies and innovations including those based on indigenous and local knowledge (ILK), that are available and that could, if put into practice in local regions, \\"avoid, reduce and reverse desertification, simultaneously contributing to climate change mitigation and adaptation.\\" Chapter 4: Land Degradation While the impact of land degradation on peoples' livelihoods globally is already evident, \\"particularly those living in vulnerable and poverty-stricken regions\\", the authors of chapter four do not make a clear connection between climate change and land degradation because of the multiple factors at play which include inequality, population growth, technology, and markets. Chapter 5: Food Security Climate change has had a negative impact on vegetation at the same time that we are experiencing population growth. Ice-free land is needed to maintain food security. The IPCC report authors cautioned against \\"converting land\\" to bioenergy in which energy is produced by burning vegetation instead of burning fossil fuels, and advised countries to \\"set limits on the amount of land\\" used for energy crops‚Äîbiofuels and afforestation. Land use in this way means there is less soil to grow much- needed food crops. In the original draft of the summary for policymakers the warning was even more pronounced, but it was considerably watered down due to the intervention of a group of governments led by Brazil, United States, United Kingdom and Sweden.IPCC: Urgent action needed to tackle hunger alongside climate crisis www.climatechangenews.com, 8 August 2019, compare especially the presentation of the side-effects of Bioenergy and BECCS in the original draft with its presentation in the release version According to Chapter 5, with extreme weather events, rising temperatures increase, and either not enough or too much rain, there is more food insecurity. In some cases, yields of maize and wheat, for example, have increased in higher altitudes while yields of the same crops have declined in regions with lower altitudes. They also discuss \\"climate change-induced displacement and migration\\" in \\"eight countries in Asia, Africa and Latin America.\\" They said that in countries such as, Guatemala, Honduras, and Nicaragua where 30% of the agriculture is dependent on rainfall, food security is undermined. They cited studies that show that migration from Mexico and Central America, fluctuates in \\"response to climate variability\\". Furthermore, in these countries, the \\"food system is heavily dependent on maize and bean production and long-term climate change and variability significantly affect the productivity of these crops and the livelihoods of smallholder farmers.\\" Chapter 6: Interlinkages Chapter 6, \\"Interlinkages between desertification, land degradation, food security and GHG fluxes: Synergies, trade-offs and Integrated Response Options\\", offers pathways of mitigating the effects of global climate change on land use, such as reduced deforestation and agricultural diversification.Smith, Pete & Nkem, Johnson & Calvin, Katherine & Campbell, Donovan & Cherubini, Francesco & Grassi, Giacomo & Korotkov, Vladimir & Hoang, Anh & Lwasa, Shuaib & McElwee, Pamela & Nkonya, Ephraim & Saigusa, Nobuko & Soussana, Jean-Fran√ßois & Taboada, Miguel & Arias-Navarro, Cristina & Cavalett, Otavio & Cowie, Annette & House, Joanna & Huppmann, Daniel & Vizzarri, Matteo. (2019). IPCC SRCCL Chapter 6: Interlinkages between Desertification, Land Degradation, Food Security and GHG fluxes: synergies, trade-offs and Integrated Response Options. In addition, Chapter 6 also says that a shift in consumer behaviour towards a more plant-based diet with less protein from livestock, such as cattle, \\"sheep, buffalo and goats\\" would result in lower emissions.IPCC researchers present scientific evidence on the carbon footprints of certain activities and behaviours; they do not make specific recommendations people's diets. Jim S One of the three lead authors for Chapter 6, the University of Aberdeen's environmental scientist, Pete Smith, who teaches plant and soil science, said that as growing conditions deteriorate, there will be a \\"massive pressure for migration.\\" Ruminant livestock not only produce a lot of methane, a powerful greenhouse gas, but the \\"deforestation in critical forest systems\\" is caused by need for grazing land in countries such as Brazil. Smith clarified that, \\"We're not telling people to stop eating meat. In some places people have no other choice. But it's obvious that in the West we're eating far too much.\\" Rutgers University's Department of Human Ecology at the School of Environmental and Biological Sciences's associate professor, Pamela McElwee, who is one of Chapter 5's co- authors, said that \\"dietary change\\"‚Äî\\"particularly in developed countries of the West\\"‚Äîsuch as reducing \\"excess\\" consumption of \\"high-greenhouse-gas- emissions diets\\" high in lamb and cattle consumption is a \\"win-win\\" because it addresses both climate crisis and health problems at the same time. McElwee said that food security is a major concern as there is potential for \\"food crises developing \\"on several continents at once,\\" according to The Times. Climate warming speeds up the \\"rate of soil loss and land degradation\\" which heightens the risk of \\"severe food shortages.\\" While there are a lot of actions available to us, McElwee said that \\"what some of these solutions do require is attention, financial support, enabling environments.\\" The science on which the report is based shows that \\"increasing the productivity of land, wasting less food\\" and shifting diets \\"away from cattle and other types of meat\\" lowers the carbon footprint. According to an August 8, 2019 PBS NewsHour report, about 15% of current emissions could be cut by mid-century if \\"people change their diets, reducing red meat and increasing plant-based foods, such as fruits, vegetables and seeds.\\" Rosenzweig added, it \\"would also make people more healthy.\\" Chapter six discusses material substitutionMaterial substitution refers to a climate change mitigation strategy in which harvested wood products(HWPs) are used as substitutes for plastics, concrete, metal or steel which are more emission-intensive. as it relates to sustainable long- term forest management, with more production of harvested wood products(HWPs) which have a lower carbon footprint. HWP that are used to as a substitute for metal, plastic, or concrete‚Äî which are more emissions-intensive‚Äîwould also result in removing carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere. In Canada, for example, Margot Hurlbert said that forest industry could increase the percentage of solid wood products that it harvests and decrease the amount of pulp and paper products. Chapter 7: Risk management and decision making in relation to sustainable development Risk management, which \\"reduces vulnerabilities in land and the food system\\" and increases resilience in communities, can include making dietary changes and growing a \\"variety of crops\\", which can prevent soil degradation. It also includes sharing risks, \\"reducing inequalities, and improving incomes.\\" Other \\"ways to adapt to the negative effects of climate change, include ensuring that there is \\"equitable access to food\\" particularly in those regions where \\"land cannot provide adequate food\\". University of Regina's Margot Hurlbert, who is also Canada Research Chair in climate change, energy and sustainability policy, is co- ordinating co-author of \\"Risk management and decision making in relation to sustainable development\\", said that, \\"...there's lots of opportunities to make these changes, and it's not too late.\\" This includes using natural shade, through agroforestry, for example, to grow crops, and‚Äîin tropical climates‚Äîusing biochar as a fertilizer. Hurlbert said that countries, like Canada, can \\"wield influence through its own use of trade conditions and policies\\" to \\"ensure imported food is grown without damaging landscapes and widening deserts overseas\\". Consumers, as well as organizations and governments, can use sustainability certifications when sourcing wood products and food, for example.In an August 9, 2019 interview with CBC News, Hulbert described agroforestry as \\"having forests that agricultural producers are also farming and living in.\\" Examples of agroforestry include growing crops such as coffee under a forest canopy, and interspersing vegetables with fruit trees. Main Statements This report provided a comprehensive overview of the entire land-climate system for the first time and addressed land itself as a \\"critical resource\\". In an August 9 United Nations video, Valerie Masson- Delmotte cited the newly released report, saying that there are currently over 500 million people who live in areas negatively affected by climate change on land transformed by land degradation or desertification. Many are forced to migrate. The international group of 107 authors urged all nations to adopt sustainable land use in order to \\"limit greenhouse gas emissions before it is too late\\" and to work together to build long-term food security systems to support farmers with programs that will help build their resilience and help them engage in the market. Valerie Masson-Delmotte is currently leading the IPCC's Working Group One's (WGI) activities for the Sixth Assessment Report (AR6) cycle. She is a senior researcher at the Laboratoire des sciences du climat et de l'environnement (LSCE, Climate and Environment Sciences Laboratory). She was elected as co-chair of IPCC WGI in October 2015, which is the group that \\"examines the physical science basis\\". Before working on the AR6, she also served on AR5 as coordinating lead author on the paleoclimate chapter. IPCC vice-chair and ANU Climate Institute director Mark Howden, who is one of the authors of the SRCCL, said that \\"the land sector is currently contributing to climate change\\" and better land management \\"would have multiple economic, environmental and health benefits\\" and would deliver \\"win- wins for farmers, communities, governments and biodiversity but also helps address climate change.\\" = Contributors = The scientific leadership of the SRCCL included 107 experts from 52 countries as coordinating lead authors and lead authors in the three IPCC Working Groups as well as the Task Force on National Greenhouse Gas Inventories with support from the Working Group III Technical Support Unit. Fifty three percent of the authors of the report are from developing countries and forty percent of the coordinating lead authors are women. Reactions The Economist stated that the report \\"fires another warning shot about the state of the planet and the way people are transforming virtually every corner of every continent. Human activities affect roughly three-quarters of Earth's ice-free land, with huge consequences for the climate.\\" The BBC published a series of articles related to the publication of the report. Roger Harrabin, a BBC environment analyst, said that the report would \\"become the most authoritative report yet on the way we use and abuse the land.\\" An August 8, 2019 article by New York Times (NYT) highlighted the facts that the SRCCL was \\"prepared by more than 100 experts from 52 countries\\" and that it found that a \\"half-billion people already live in places turning into desert, and soil is being lost between 10 and 100 times faster than it is forming.\\" The NYT also pointed to the fivefold increase in migrants at the United States/Mexico border from El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras \\"coinciding with a dry period that left many with not enough food.\\" Some scientists \\"suggested it bears the signal of climate change.\\" An article in The Atlantic was titled, \\"This Land Is the Only Land There Is\\". The article said that the SRCCL is a milestone because it says that ice-free land itself, which humans need for growing food, is \\"scarce and precious\\". The article pointed to some climate scientists and researchers having, prior to SRCCL, sometimes portrayed land as a \\"limitless\\" cleansing \\"global sponge\\", in the sense that replanting sufficient numbers of trees would significantly reduce the net CO2 burden. The Washington Post called SRCCL a \\"landmark study\\".

He was internationally known for his dry bean breeding program that expanded bean production in Canada ‚Äì taking beans that are usually grown in Africa, India, Korea, Japan and Brazil, and breeding them so they could thrive in Ontario and Western Canada to give farmers new crops to grow. He developed more than 28 bean varieties during his 25 year career (it takes 10 years to develop a new variety.)  Biography  Park was born in Korea in 1937 and started his career there as a rice breeder. In 1981 he joined Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada and worked there until retirement in 2006. He adopted a team approach to bean breeding, involving the expertise of crop physiologists, pathologists and entomologists.  Career  In 1981, Park started working navy beans and developed 19 varieties, five of which were registered after his retirement.https://www.pressreader.com/canada/windsor-star/20070222/page/5 The navy beans that Park helped develop include: * Dresden (1987) * Mitchell (1987) *Centralia (1988) *Shetland (1991) *Harowood (1991) *HR 14 (1992) *HR 20 (1992) *HR 46 (1995) *AC Compass (2000) *AC Mast (2001) *AC Trident (2001) *AC Cruiser (2003) *Nautica (2005) *Kippen (2005) *Galley (2007) *Apex (2011) *Portage (2011) *AAC Shock (2017) *AAC Argosy (2018) Emerging ethnic markets influenced the study of additional bean varieties and new cropping systems in the 1980s. Cooperation between scientists and the processing industry was important in developing varieties for new and innovative foods. Park helped develop and introduce various kidney, black, pinto, mung and adzuki beans as well as the specialty beans otebo and kintoki, which are exported to Japan for use in confections. The other dry beans that Park helped develop include: *Aresteuben (yellow eye bean, 1987) *Harblack (black bean, 1992) *AC Litekid (light red kidney bean, 1996) *AC Darkid (dark red kidney bean, 1996) *AC Harosprout (mungbean, 1997) *AC Gemco (azuki bean, 1997) *AC Ole (Pint bean, 1999) *AC Elk (light red kidney bean, 1999) *AC Calmont (dark red kidney bean, 1999) *Harohawk (black bean, 2007) *Red Rider (cranberry bean, 2009) Although most of the Centre‚Äôs bean breeding plots are in southern Ontario, scientists have worked extensively with researchers in western Canada and with universities and public institutions in the United States and Europe. Beans developed at the Centre are grown in the Maritimes, Prairies and the United States and many are exported to Europe for consumption. For example, AC Pintoba, a pinto bean that is common in Mexican food, made 40% of the acreage grown in Manitoba in the early-mid 2000s. Soon was an outstanding scientist and made major contributions to Canadian agriculture. The many varieties of edible beans that he developed and made available for Canadian growers will forever establish his legacy as a prominent and dedicated public servant.

Set x=1, we arrive at \\\\mathfrak{N}_\\\\alpha( u) without the normalization constant. The reason why this distribution is called \\"stable count\\" can be understood by the relation u=N^{1/\\\\alpha}. Note that N is the \\"count\\" of the L√©vy sum. Given a fixed \\\\alpha, this distribution gives the probability of taking N steps to travel one unit of distance. =Integral form= Based on the integral form of L_\\\\alpha(x) and q=\\\\exp(-i\\\\alpha\\\\pi/2) , we have the integral form of \\\\mathfrak{N}_\\\\alpha( u) as : \\\\begin{align} \\\\mathfrak{N}_\\\\alpha( u) & = \\\\frac{2\\\\alpha}{\\\\pi\\\\Gamma(\\\\frac{1}{\\\\alpha})} \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-\\\\text{Re}(q)\\\\,t^\\\\alpha} \\\\frac{1}{ u} \\\\sin(\\\\frac{t}{ u})\\\\sin(-\\\\text{Im}(q)\\\\,t^\\\\alpha) \\\\,dt, \\\\text{ or } \\\\\\\\\\\\ & = \\\\frac{2\\\\alpha}{\\\\pi\\\\Gamma(\\\\frac{1}{\\\\alpha})} \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-\\\\text{Re}(q)\\\\,t^\\\\alpha} \\\\frac{1}{ u} \\\\cos(\\\\frac{t}{ u})\\\\cos(\\\\text{Im}(q)\\\\,t^\\\\alpha) \\\\,dt . \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{align} Based on the double-sine integral above, it leads to the integral form of the standard CDF: : \\\\begin{align} \\\\Phi_\\\\alpha(x) & = \\\\frac{2\\\\alpha}{\\\\pi\\\\Gamma(\\\\frac{1}{\\\\alpha})} \\\\int_0^x \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-\\\\text{Re}(q)\\\\,t^\\\\alpha} \\\\frac{1}{ u} \\\\sin(\\\\frac{t}{ u})\\\\sin(-\\\\text{Im}(q)\\\\,t^\\\\alpha) \\\\,dt\\\\,d u \\\\\\\\\\\\ & = 1- \\\\frac{2\\\\alpha}{\\\\pi\\\\Gamma(\\\\frac{1}{\\\\alpha})} \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-\\\\text{Re}(q)\\\\,t^\\\\alpha} \\\\sin(-\\\\text{Im}(q)\\\\,t^\\\\alpha) \\\\,\\\\text{Si}(\\\\frac{t}{x}) \\\\,dt, \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{align} where \\\\text{Si}(x)=\\\\int_0^x \\\\frac{\\\\sin(x)}{x}\\\\,dx is the sine integral function. = The Wright representation = In \\"Series representation\\", it is shown that the stable count distribution is a special case of the Wright function: :\\\\mathfrak{N}_\\\\alpha( u) = \\\\frac{\\\\alpha}{\\\\Gamma\\\\left( \\\\frac{1}{\\\\alpha} \\\\right)} \\\\phi_{-\\\\alpha,0}(- u^\\\\alpha) , \\\\, \\\\text{where} \\\\,\\\\, \\\\phi_{\\\\lambda,\\\\mu}(z) = \\\\sum_{n=0}^\\\\infty \\\\frac{z^n}{n!\\\\,\\\\Gamma(\\\\lambda n+\\\\mu)}. This leads to the Hankel integral: (based on (1.4.3) of ) :\\\\mathfrak{N}_\\\\alpha( u) = \\\\frac{\\\\alpha}{\\\\Gamma\\\\left( \\\\frac{1}{\\\\alpha} \\\\right)} \\\\frac{1}{2 \\\\pi i} \\\\int_{Ha} e^{t-( u t)^\\\\alpha} \\\\, dt, \\\\, where Ha represents a Hankel contour.  Alternative derivation ‚Äì lambda decomposition  Another approach to derive the stable count distribution is to use the Laplace transform of the one-sided stable distribution, (Section 2.4 of ) : \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-z x} L_\\\\alpha(x) \\\\, dx = e^{-z^\\\\alpha},where 0<\\\\alpha<1. Let x=1/ u, and one can decompose the integral on the left hand side as a product distribution of a standard Laplace distribution and a standard stable count distribution, :\\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\frac{\\\\alpha}{\\\\Gamma(\\\\frac{1}{\\\\alpha})} e^{-z^\\\\alpha} = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty \\\\frac{1}{ u} \\\\left( \\\\frac{1}{2} e^{-z/ u} \\\\right) \\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\alpha}{\\\\Gamma(\\\\frac{1}{\\\\alpha})} \\\\frac{1}{ u} L_\\\\alpha \\\\left( \\\\frac{1}{ u} \\\\right) \\\\right) \\\\, d u , where z \\\\in \\\\mathsf{R}. This is called the \\"lambda decomposition\\" (See Section 4 of ) since the LHS was named as \\"symmetric lambda distribution\\" in Lihn's former works. However, it has several more popular names such as \\"exponential power distribution\\", or the \\"generalized error/normal distribution\\", often referred to when \\\\alpha>1. Lambda decomposition is the foundation of Lihn's framework of asset returns under the stable law. The LHS is the distribution of asset returns. On the RHS, the Laplace distribution represents the lepkurtotic noise, and the stable count distribution represents the volatility.  Asymptotic properties  For stable distribution family, it is essential to understand its asymptotic behaviors. From, for small u, : \\\\begin{align} \\\\mathfrak{N}_\\\\alpha( u) & \\\\rightarrow B(\\\\alpha) \\\\, u^{\\\\alpha}, \\\\text{ for } u \\\\rightarrow 0 \\\\text{ and } B(\\\\alpha)>0. \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{align} This confirms \\\\mathfrak{N}_\\\\alpha(0)=0 . For large u, : \\\\begin{align} \\\\mathfrak{N}_\\\\alpha( u) & \\\\rightarrow u^{\\\\frac{\\\\alpha}{2(1-\\\\alpha)}} e^{-A(\\\\alpha) \\\\, u^{\\\\frac{\\\\alpha}{1-\\\\alpha}}}, \\\\text{ for } u \\\\rightarrow \\\\infty \\\\text{ and } A(\\\\alpha)>0. \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{align} This shows that the tail of \\\\mathfrak{N}_\\\\alpha( u) decays exponentially at infinity. The larger \\\\alpha is, the stronger the decay.  Moments  The n-th moment m_n of \\\\mathfrak{N}_\\\\alpha( u) is the -(n+1)-th moment of L_\\\\alpha(x). All positive moments are finite. This in a way solves the thorny issue of diverging moments in the stable distribution. (See Section 2.4 of ) : \\\\begin{align} m_n & = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty u^n \\\\mathfrak{N}_\\\\alpha( u) d u = \\\\frac{\\\\alpha}{\\\\Gamma(\\\\frac{1}{\\\\alpha})} \\\\int_0^\\\\infty \\\\frac{1}{t^{n+1}} L_\\\\alpha(t) \\\\, dt. \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{align} The analytic solution of moments is obtained through the Wright function: : \\\\begin{align} m_n & = \\\\frac{\\\\alpha}{\\\\Gamma(\\\\frac{1}{\\\\alpha})} \\\\int_0^\\\\infty u^{n} \\\\phi_{-\\\\alpha,0}(- u^\\\\alpha) \\\\, d u \\\\\\\\\\\\ & = \\\\frac{\\\\Gamma(\\\\frac{n+1}{\\\\alpha})}{\\\\Gamma(n+1)\\\\Gamma(\\\\frac{1}{\\\\alpha})}, \\\\, n \\\\geq -1. \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{align} where \\\\int_0^\\\\infty r^\\\\delta \\\\phi_{- u,\\\\mu}(-r)\\\\,dr = \\\\frac{\\\\Gamma(\\\\delta+1)}{\\\\Gamma( u\\\\delta+ u+\\\\mu)} , \\\\, \\\\delta>-1,0< u<1,\\\\mu>0. (See (1.4.28) of ) Thus, the mean of \\\\mathfrak{N}_\\\\alpha( u) is :m_1=\\\\frac{\\\\Gamma(\\\\frac{2}{\\\\alpha})}{\\\\Gamma(\\\\frac{1}{\\\\alpha})} The variance is :\\\\sigma^2= \\\\frac{\\\\Gamma(\\\\frac{3}{\\\\alpha})}{2\\\\Gamma(\\\\frac{1}{\\\\alpha})} \\\\- \\\\left[ \\\\frac{\\\\Gamma(\\\\frac{2}{\\\\alpha})}{\\\\Gamma(\\\\frac{1}{\\\\alpha})} \\\\right]^2 = Moment generating function = The MGF can be expressed by a Fox-Wright function or Fox H-function: :\\\\begin{align} M_\\\\alpha(s) & = \\\\sum_{n=0}^\\\\infty \\\\frac{m_n\\\\,s^n}{n!} = \\\\frac{1}{\\\\Gamma(\\\\frac{1}{\\\\alpha})} \\\\sum_{n=0}^\\\\infty \\\\frac{\\\\Gamma(\\\\frac{n+1}{\\\\alpha})\\\\,s^n}{\\\\Gamma(n+1)^2} \\\\\\\\\\\\ & = \\\\frac{1}{\\\\Gamma(\\\\frac{1}{\\\\alpha})} {}_1\\\\Psi_1\\\\left[(\\\\frac{1}{\\\\alpha},\\\\frac{1}{\\\\alpha});(1,1); s\\\\right] ,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\text{or} \\\\\\\\\\\\ & = \\\\frac{1}{\\\\Gamma(\\\\frac{1}{\\\\alpha})} H^{1,1}_{1,2}\\\\left[-s \\\\bigl \\\\begin{matrix} (1-\\\\frac{1}{\\\\alpha}, \\\\frac{1}{\\\\alpha}) \\\\\\\\\\\\ (0,1);(0,1) \\\\end{matrix} \\\\right] \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{align} As a verification, at \\\\alpha=\\\\frac{1}{2} , M_{\\\\frac{1}{2}}(s) = (1-4s)^{-\\\\frac{3}{2}} (see below) can be Taylor-expanded to {}_1\\\\Psi_1\\\\left[(2,2);(1,1); s\\\\right] =\\\\sum_{n=0}^\\\\infty \\\\frac{\\\\Gamma(2n+2)\\\\,s^n}{\\\\Gamma(n+1)^2} via \\\\Gamma(\\\\frac{1}{2}-n) = \\\\sqrt{\\\\pi} \\\\frac{(-4)^n n!}{(2n)!} .  Known analytical case ‚Äì quartic stable count  When \\\\alpha=\\\\frac{1}{2}, L_{1/2}(x) is the L√©vy distribution which is an inverse gamma distribution. Thus \\\\mathfrak{N}_{1/2}( u; u_0,\\\\theta) is a shifted gamma distribution of shape 3/2 and scale 4\\\\theta , : \\\\mathfrak{N}_{\\\\frac{1}{2}}( u; u_0,\\\\theta) = \\\\frac{1}{4\\\\sqrt{\\\\pi}\\\\theta^{3/2}} ( u- u_0)^{1/2} e^{-( u- u_0)/4\\\\theta}, where u> u_0, \\\\theta>0. Its mean is u_0+6\\\\theta and its standard deviation is \\\\sqrt{24}\\\\theta . This called \\"quartic stable count distribution\\". The word \\"quartic\\" comes from Lihn's former work on the lambda distribution where \\\\lambda=2/\\\\alpha=4. At this setting, many facets of stable count distribution have elegant analytical solutions. The p-th central moments are \\\\frac{2 \\\\Gamma(p+3/2)}{\\\\Gamma(3/2)} 4^p\\\\theta^p. The CDF is \\\\frac{2}{\\\\sqrt{\\\\pi}} \\\\gamma\\\\left(\\\\frac{3}{2}, \\\\frac{ u- u_0}{4\\\\theta} \\\\right) where \\\\gamma(s,x) is the lower incomplete gamma function. And the MGF is M_{\\\\frac{1}{2}}(s) = e^{s u_0}(1-4s\\\\theta)^{-\\\\frac{3}{2}}. (See Section 3 of )  Special case when Œ± ‚Üí 1  As \\\\alpha becomes larger, the peak of the distribution becomes sharper. A special case of \\\\mathfrak{N}_\\\\alpha( u) is when \\\\alpha\\\\rightarrow1. The distribution behaves like a Dirac delta function, :\\\\mathfrak{N}_{\\\\alpha\\\\rightarrow1}( u) \\\\rightarrow \\\\delta( u-1), where \\\\delta(x) = \\\\begin{cases} \\\\infty, & \\\\text{if }x=0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0, & \\\\text{if }x eq 0 \\\\end{cases} , and \\\\int_{0_-}^{0_+} \\\\delta(x) dx = 1 . Series representation Based on the series representation of the one-sided stable distribution, we have: :\\\\begin{align} \\\\mathfrak{N}_\\\\alpha(x) & = \\\\frac{\\\\alpha}{\\\\pi\\\\Gamma(\\\\frac{1}{\\\\alpha})} \\\\sum_{n=1}^\\\\infty\\\\frac{-\\\\sin(n(\\\\alpha+1)\\\\pi)}{n!}{x}^{\\\\alpha n}\\\\Gamma(\\\\alpha n+1) \\\\\\\\\\\\ & = \\\\frac{\\\\alpha}{\\\\pi\\\\Gamma(\\\\frac{1}{\\\\alpha})} \\\\sum_{n=1}^\\\\infty\\\\frac{(-1)^{n+1} \\\\sin(n\\\\alpha\\\\pi)}{n!}{x}^{\\\\alpha n}\\\\Gamma(\\\\alpha n+1) \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{align} . This series representation has two interpretations: * First, a similar form of this series was first given in Pollard (1948), and in \\"Relation to Mittag-Leffler function\\", it is stated that \\\\mathfrak{N}_\\\\alpha(x) = \\\\frac{\\\\alpha^2 x^\\\\alpha}{\\\\Gamma \\\\left(\\\\frac{1}{\\\\alpha}\\\\right)} H_\\\\alpha(x^\\\\alpha), where H_\\\\alpha(k) is the Laplace transform of the Mittag-Leffler function E_\\\\alpha(-x) . * Secondly, this series is a special case of the Wright function \\\\phi_{\\\\lambda,\\\\mu}(z) : (See Section 1.4 of ) :\\\\begin{align} \\\\mathfrak{N}_\\\\alpha(x) & = \\\\frac{\\\\alpha}{\\\\pi\\\\Gamma(\\\\frac{1}{\\\\alpha})} \\\\sum_{n=1}^\\\\infty\\\\frac{(-1)^{n} {x}^{\\\\alpha n}}{n!}\\\\, \\\\sin((\\\\alpha n+1)\\\\pi)\\\\Gamma(\\\\alpha n+1) \\\\\\\\\\\\ & = \\\\frac{\\\\alpha}{\\\\Gamma \\\\left(\\\\frac{1}{\\\\alpha}\\\\right)} \\\\phi_{-\\\\alpha,0}(-x^\\\\alpha), \\\\, \\\\text{where} \\\\,\\\\, \\\\phi_{\\\\lambda,\\\\mu}(z) = \\\\sum_{n=0}^\\\\infty \\\\frac{z^n}{n!\\\\,\\\\Gamma(\\\\lambda n+\\\\mu)}, \\\\lambda>-1. \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{align} The proof is obtained by the reflection formula of the Gamma function: \\\\sin((\\\\alpha n+1)\\\\pi)\\\\Gamma(\\\\alpha n+1) = \\\\pi/\\\\Gamma(-\\\\alpha n) , which admits the mapping: \\\\lambda=-\\\\alpha,\\\\mu=0,z=-x^\\\\alpha in \\\\phi_{\\\\lambda,\\\\mu}(z) . The Wright representation leads to analytical solutions for many statistical properties of the stable count distribution and establish another connection to fractional calculus.  Applications  Stable count distribution can represent the daily distribution of VIX quite well. It is hypothesized that VIX is distributed like \\\\mathfrak{N}_{\\\\frac{1}{2}}( u; u_0,\\\\theta) with u_0=10.4 and \\\\theta=1.6 (See Section 7 of ). Thus the stable count distribution is the first-order marginal distribution of a volatility process. In this context, u_0 is called the \\"floor volatility\\". In practice, VIX rarely drops below 10. This phenomenon justifies the concept of \\"floor volatility\\". A sample of the fit is shown below: 500x500px One form of mean-reverting SDE for \\\\mathfrak{N}_{\\\\frac{1}{2}}( u; u_0,\\\\theta) is based on a modified Cox‚ÄìIngersoll‚ÄìRoss (CIR) model. Assume S_t is the volatility process, we have : dS_t = \\\\frac{\\\\sigma^2}{8\\\\theta} (6\\\\theta+ u_0-S_t) \\\\, dt + \\\\sigma \\\\sqrt{S_t- u_0} \\\\, dW, where \\\\sigma is the so-called \\"vol of vol\\". The \\"vol of vol\\" for VIX is called VVIX, which has a typical value of about 85. This SDE is analytically tractable and satisfies the Feller condition, thus S_t would never go below u_0 . But there is an subtle issue between theory and practice. There has been about 0.6% probability that VIX did go below u_0 . This is called \\"spillover\\". To address it, one can replace the square root term with \\\\sqrt{\\\\max(S_t- u_0,\\\\delta u_0)}, where \\\\delta u_0\\\\approx 0.01 \\\\, u_0 provides a small leakage channel for S_t to drift slightly below u_0 . Extremely low VIX reading indicates a very complacent market. Thus the spillover condition, S_t< u_0, carries a certain significance - When it occurs, it usually indicates the calm before the storm in the business cycle.  Fractional calculus  = Relation to Mittag-Leffler function = From Section 4 of, the inverse Laplace transform H_\\\\alpha(k) of the Mittag-Leffler function E_\\\\alpha(-x) is (k>0 ) :H_\\\\alpha(k)= \\\\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\\\\\\\{E_\\\\alpha(-x)\\\\\\\\}(k) = \\\\frac{2}{\\\\pi} \\\\int_0^\\\\infty E_{2\\\\alpha}(-t^2) \\\\cos(kt) \\\\,dt. On the other hand, the following relation was given by Pollard (1948), :H_\\\\alpha(k) = \\\\frac{1}{\\\\alpha} \\\\frac{1}{k^{1+1/\\\\alpha}} L_\\\\alpha \\\\left( \\\\frac{1}{k^{1/\\\\alpha}} \\\\right). Thus by k= u^\\\\alpha , we obtain the relation between stable count distribution and Mittag-Leffter function: :\\\\mathfrak{N}_\\\\alpha( u) = \\\\frac{\\\\alpha^2 u^\\\\alpha}{\\\\Gamma \\\\left(\\\\frac{1}{\\\\alpha}\\\\right)} H_\\\\alpha( u^\\\\alpha). This relation can be verified quickly at \\\\alpha=\\\\frac{1}{2} where H_{\\\\frac{1}{2}}(k)=\\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{\\\\pi}} \\\\,e^{-k^2/4} and k^2= u . This leads to the well-known quartic stable count result: :\\\\mathfrak{N}_{\\\\frac{1}{2}}( u) = \\\\frac{ u^{1/2}}{4\\\\,\\\\Gamma (2)} \\\\times \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{\\\\pi}} \\\\,e^{- u/4} = \\\\frac{1}{4\\\\,\\\\sqrt{\\\\pi}} u^{1/2}\\\\,e^{- u/4}. = Relation to time-fractional Fokker-Planck equation = The ordinary Fokker-Planck equation (FPE) is \\\\frac{\\\\partial P_1(x,t)}{\\\\partial t} = K_1\\\\, \\\\tilde{L}_{FP} P_1(x,t) , where \\\\tilde{L}_{FP} = \\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial x} \\\\frac{F(x)}{T} + \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2}{\\\\partial x^2} is the Fokker-Planck space operator, K_1 is the diffusion coefficient, T is the temperature, and F(x) is the external field. The time-fractional FPE introduces the additional fractional derivative \\\\,_0D_t^{1-\\\\alpha} such that \\\\frac{\\\\partial P_\\\\alpha(x,t)}{\\\\partial t} = K_\\\\alpha \\\\,_0D_t^{1-\\\\alpha} \\\\tilde{L}_{FP} P_\\\\alpha(x,t) , where K_\\\\alpha is the fractional diffusion coefficient. Let k=s/t^\\\\alpha in H_\\\\alpha(k), we obtain the kernel for the time-fractional FPE (Eq (16) of ) :n(s,t) = \\\\frac{1}{\\\\alpha} \\\\frac{t}{s^{1+1/\\\\alpha}} L_\\\\alpha \\\\left( \\\\frac{t}{s^{1/\\\\alpha}} \\\\right) from which the fractional density P_\\\\alpha(x,t) can be calculated from an ordinary solution P_1(x,t) via :P_\\\\alpha(x,t) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty n\\\\left( \\\\frac{s}{K},t\\\\right) \\\\,P_1(x,s) \\\\,ds, \\\\text{ where } K=\\\\frac{K_\\\\alpha}{K_1}. Since n(\\\\frac{s}{K},t)\\\\,ds = \\\\Gamma \\\\left(\\\\frac{1}{\\\\alpha}\\\\right) \\\\frac{1}{\\\\alpha u}\\\\, \\\\mathfrak{N}_\\\\alpha( u; \\\\theta=K^{1/\\\\alpha}) \\\\,d u via change of variable u t = s^{1/\\\\alpha} , the above integral becomes the product distribution with \\\\mathfrak{N}_\\\\alpha( u) , similar to the \\"lambda decomposition\\" concept, and scaling of time t \\\\Rightarrow ( u t)^\\\\alpha : :P_\\\\alpha(x,t) = \\\\frac{\\\\Gamma \\\\left(\\\\frac{1}{\\\\alpha}\\\\right)}{\\\\alpha} \\\\int_0^\\\\infty \\\\frac{1}{ u}\\\\, \\\\mathfrak{N}_\\\\alpha( u; \\\\theta=K^{1/\\\\alpha}) \\\\,P_1(x,( u t)^\\\\alpha) \\\\,d u. Here \\\\mathfrak{N}_\\\\alpha( u; \\\\theta=K^{1/\\\\alpha}) is interpreted as the distribution of impurity, expressed in the unit of K^{1/\\\\alpha} , that causes the anomalous diffusion.

A neo-pagan and nordicist, Mabire is known for the regionalist and euro-nationalist ideas he developed in both Europe-Action and GRECE, as well as his controversial books on the Waffen-SS.  Biography  = Early life = Jean Pol Yves Jacques Mabire was born in Paris on 8 February 1927, to a bourgeois family originally from Vire, Normandy. He attended the Coll√®ge Stanislas, where he earned a baccalaur√©at in literature and philosophy. In 1949, at the of age 22, Mabire created the regionalist magazine Viking and in 1951 left Paris to settle in Cherbourg, Normandy, where he founded a graphic arts workshop. Mabire wrote more than half of the 162 articles published in the magazine until its end in 1958. Viking had 300 to 400 subscribers and the most popular issues were sold at around 1,000 copies. He regarded the Normans as part of the \\"Nordic race\\" and his magazine gave a great importance to Scandinavian cultures and viking history. = Political activism = In 1958, Mabire was sent as a reserved soldier to North Africa during the Algerian War (1954‚Äì62). Between 1963 and 1965, he wrote articles in Philippe H√©duy's L'Esprit public, and was a contributor in Cahiers universitaires, the magazine of the Federation of Nationalist Students (FEN). In 1965, he was part of the grassroots committees of far-right presidential candidate Jean-Louis Tixier- Vignancour, and wrote in January a book to explain his endorsement. From 1965, he served as the redactor-in-chief of Europe-Action, in which he wrote about neo-paganism, the Waffen SS and the Charlemagne Regiment. Mabire was one of the architects of the euro-nationalist break with the old French nationalism supported by the magazine. He supported instead a pan-European nationalism, decentralized and based on the identities of regions, seen as smaller ethnic nations, a thesis later embodied in Yann Fou√©r√©'s \\"Europe of 100 Flags\\", published in 1968. His shift towards the radical right was confirmed in many articles Mabire published in Le Spectacle du Monde, Valeurs Actuelles or Minute. In 1968, Mabire became a founding member of the Mouvement Normand, and the following year he helped Georges Bernage establish Heimdal, a regionalist magazine and intellectual successor of Viking. Mabire wrote in Heimdal about Norman poets, Nordicism and Scandinavian mythology. The magazine was a success and sold at more than 3,000 copies. He became an active member of GRECE in 1970, and took part in its \\"federal council\\" and \\"commission of traditions\\". In 1973, Mabire co-founded the neopagan scouting organization Europe-Jeunesse with Jean-Claude Valla and Maurice Rollet. The same year, Mabire's literary career began with the publication of a saga on the history of the French SS: La Brigade Frankreich, La Division Charlemagne and Mourir √† Berlin. After his wife died from cancer in 1974, he remarried two years later and settled in the Parisian region. He participated, along with other GRECE members Pierre Vial and Jean Haudry, in the founding of the association Terre et Peuple in 1995. = Later life and death = Jean Mabire died of leukemia on 29 March 2006 in Saint-Malo, Britanny, at the age of 79.  Controversy  His books on the Waffen-SS have been regarded as a hagyographic and romantic rehabilitation of Nazism. Mabire describes for instance some units in those terms: \\"The SS carry the Prometheus torch and Sigurd's sword to the Caucasus. They are the sons of the old Germanic warriors who emerged from the ice and forests. They are the Teutonics who replaced the cross of Christ with the wheel of the Sun. They are Adolf Hitler's SS.\\"Mabire, Jean (1976). Les Jeunes Fauves du F√ºhrer, la Division SS Hitlerjungend dans la bataille de Normandie, Fayard, pp. 46‚Äì47.

She grew up in a family of five brothers, belonging to the Mapuche and Tehuelche nations. In 1971 her father, Luis Mill√°n, railway worker and victim of the acculturation of the Mapuche people, moved with the whole family to Bah√≠a Blanca for work reasons. The Mill√°n family settled in a villa miseria inhabited mainly by indigenous people, mostly Mapuches. Moira suffered racism in Bah√≠a Blanca, both from a society that rejected \\"the Indians\\", and from a school that glorified the military as heroes who had defeated the Mapuche nation in the so-called Conquest of the Desert and enslaved the survivors. She began working at age twelve as a maid, suffering sexual harassment from her employers. Shortly after she began to actively spread the evangelical creed, moving to Brazil, where she participated in the Basic ecclesial community and identified with the Workers' Party (PT), led by Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva. At age 18, in 1988, she decided to recover his indigenous roots, returning to the ancestral lands of his father, in the area of Ingeniero Jacobacci, province of Rio Negro. In 1992 she joined the Mapuche-Tehuelche Organization October, which in 1996 denounced the disappearance of the rural worker from Benetton's residence, Eduardo Ca√±ulef, a situation that has multiplied since then. In 1999 Moira and her family settled in an ancestral Mapuche territory of 150 hectares, on the banks of the Palena River, founding the P√Øllan Mahuiza community in Chubut. After years of confrontations and threats, the community managed to establish itself.

His name is cited in various ways in articles and essays, with Axataf being the most common, but it can also be found as Saqqaf, Chetaf and Axacad.  History  On the death of Ibn Hud in 1238, Seville returned to owe tribute to the Almohad Empire and paid obedience to the Caliph Arraxid. After the death of Arraxid in 1242, his brother, Ali ben Idris Asaid Almotadidbila, was proclaimed caliph. A year later, the governor of Ceuta withdrew his obedience to the Moroccan caliph and recognized the suzerainty of the Sultanate of Tunis. Subsequently, the same thing happened with Sevilla, Tarifa and Jerez. Abu Zakariya Yahya, Sultan of Tunis, accepted that vassalage and sent to Seville a governor who won the antipathies of the Sevillians, who expelled him in 1245. He was succeeded by Bel Alchad, of Sevillian lineage. Bel Alchad, fearful of the reaction of the Tunisians and the advance of Christian troops, decided to sign an alliance with Ferdinand III for a period of one year. Bel Achad was killed by Axataf, the commander of the garrison in Seville, in March 1246. This violent act led to the end of the truce with Fernando, who, free of his commitment to Bel Alchad, directed his attention to Seville and began with preparations to attack the city. Axataf was declared military commander of the city and ruled along with a council of nobles. However, he could not resist the siege imposed by Ferdinand III and the city had to surrender to the Christians on November 23, 1248. Axataf handed the keys of the city to the Castilian king. He fled to Ceuta in one of the ships offered by Fernando for the Moors who, having to leave Seville, decided to march to Africa. He was murdered in November 1249 by order of Al- Afazi, head of an anti-Tunisian uprising.

These diets are based on the claim that the amount of food eaten is the primary factor in weight-loss. Typically, low-quantity diets focus on restricting the number of bites eaten in a day as a way to achieve portion control.  History  The first diet plan focused on bite-counting was developed by Dr. Richard G. Black from the Seattle Pain Clinic. This diet was designed for patients in severe pain, who often also suffered from obesity. The diet was designed to reduce the amount of food eaten, without putting any additional strain on the dieter or requiring a major lifestyle change. Dieters would count the number of bites of food they ate in a day as well as measure their weight each day. They would then adjust down the number of bites of food they took each day until they began losing weight. The diet was marketed for its simplicity and that it allows dieters to eat any type of food. The argumentation of Dr. Black was that bites are a natural way to measure food intake and that they are easy to track. In 1978, following the publication of Dr. Black's diet, Water Pik developed a hand-held bite-counting computer that could be used at meal times. A similar diet was developed in the late 1980s by Joan Breibart, a Pilates expert, and Meredith Luce, a dietician. Originally called Diet Directives and later changed to 80Bites, this diet also focuses on restricting the number of bites taken in a day. People following the diet will limit the number of bites they take to 80 in a day, split between 2 small meals and 2 medium-sized meal. The goal is that the dieter will learn to pay more attention to how much they eat and that their body will adjust to eating less. This diet differs from Dr. Black's diet in that it aims solely to reduce the amount of food eaten rather than caloric intake.  Mechanism of action  Dr. Black's bite-counting diet used bites as a proxy for calories, aiming to limit caloric intake by limiting bites. Breibart and Luce, the creators of the 80Bites diet, claim that the primary factor in weight-loss is the amount of food eaten and that exercise and caloric intake are secondary. They claim that eating too much causes the stomach to stretch, which in turn causes hunger-regulating hormones, such as leptin and ghrelin, to become unbalanced.  Efficacy  There is some evidence to suggest that counting bites can lead to weight loss. A 2015 study by Brigham Young University, published in Advances in Obesity, Weight Management & Control, found results correlating bite-counting with weight loss. Participants counted the number the bites they took in a day and reduced it by 20-30% over the next month. Of 41 participants who completed the trial, the researchers found that on average they lost 4 pounds over the trial period. Additionally, studies done by Clemson University found that bite- counting may be a more accurate measure of food intake than calories. This is because calories are difficult to count and people tend to under report the number of calories they intake. These studies indicate that bite-counting may be easier than calorie counting and can provide a more natural measurement of food intake.

Originating from a trough over the open Pacific Ocean on July 29, Francisco developed into a tropical depression on August 1\\\\. Tracking along a northwest course toward Japan, the system steadily intensified over the following days. It attained typhoon strength on August 5 and soon struck Kyushu at peak strength with winds of 130 km/h (80 mph). Thereafter, the weakened storm traversed the Korea Strait before striking South Korea on August 6\\\\. Turning toward the east, Francisco transitioned into an extratropical cyclone on August 7\\\\. It later impacted Hokkaido before continuing across the northern Pacific and dissipating. In anticipation of Francisco impacting Japan, officials in Kyushu ordered evacuations for coastal residents in and around Miyazaki. Transportation across the region was disrupted, with flights and train service cancelled. The storm brought locally damaging winds and heavy rain. Wind gusts up to downed trees and power lines, leaving 24,710 households without power. Two people died and four others were injured in incidents related to the storm. Francisco also had minor impacts in the Korean Peninsula and Russia's Primorsky Krai. Meteorological history On July 29, 2019, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) began monitoring a trough approximately north-northwest of Wake Island. Situated in a region of low wind shear, favorable upper-level outflow, and traversing northwest over warm waters, development into a tropical cyclone over subsequent days was anticipated. A defined low-level circulation developed the following day, with convective banding features organizing east of its center. Development was temporarily halted on July 31 by insufficient divergence over a majority of the system. Thereafter favorable conditions fostered organization. The Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) classified the system as a tropical depression at 00:00 UTC on August 1. Similarly, the JTWC classified it as Tropical Depression 09W at 18:00 UTC. The JMA estimated the system to have become a tropical storm around 12:00 UTC on August 2\\\\. At this time, the agency assigned it the name Francisco. Traveling along a general northwest track toward Japan, the system steadily intensified and attained typhoon status around 09:00 UTC on August 5. Typhoon Francisco reached its peak intensity around 12:00 UTC with ten-minute sustained winds of 130 km/h (80 mph) and a pressure of 970 mbar (hPa; 28.64 inHg). The JTWC assessed the storm to have intensified slightly through 18:00 UTC, with maximum one-minute sustained winds of 140 km/h (85 mph). Maintaining this intensity, Francisco made landfall in Miyazaki, Kyushu, around 20:00 UTC (5:00 a.m. local time, August 6). Once overland, the system greatly weakened to a low-end tropical storm before emerging over the Korea Strait shortly after 06:00 UTC on August 6. Tropical Storm Francisco made landfall in Busan, South Korea, at 11:20 UTC (8:20 p.m. local time) on August 6. Less than an hour after landfall, the Korea Meteorological Administration assessed Francisco to have degenerated into a remnant low; however, the JMA and JTWC continued monitoring it as a tropical cyclone. Emerging over the Sea of Japan early on August 7, the system weakened to a tropical depression. The JTWC estimated Francisco to have remained a tropical storm for 12 more hours before transitioning into an extratropical cyclone; however, the JMA maintained the system as a tropical cyclone until the following day as it turned east. The storm's remnants later impacted Hokkaido on August 8‚Äì9 before continuing across the open Pacific. The remnants of Francisco ultimately dissipated on August 11 well east of Japan. Preparations and impact =Japan= An intensifying Tropical Storm Francisco approaching Japan on August 5 As the typhoon approached Japan, the JMA warned of heavy rainfall across Kyushu and parts of Shikoku. The agency noted a high risk of landslides, flooding, and the possibility of tornadoes. In anticipation of coastal flooding, 20,020 people were evacuated from Kokuraminami-ku and Moji-ku. Sixty-five public shelters opened across Kagoshima Prefecture. Farther north, voluntary evacuations were issued for 10,500 households in Fukuoka,Kitakyushu, and Chukugo. Kyushu Railway Company and Nishi-Nippon Railroad suspended operations on the night of August 5. Local ferries were docked for the duration of the typhoon. Multiple carriers collectively cancelled more than 110 flights at Miyazaki Airport, Fukuoka Airport, and Osaka International Airport. Farmers in Ainan began rice harvests early due to the typhoon. In Miyazaki City, the Prefectural Library and Prefectural Art Museum closed for the morning of August 6; however, they reopened later in the day after the typhoon's passage. Repair works on Kumamoto Castle were suspended to prevent any equipment from damaging the structure. The United States Navy raised the Tropical Cyclone Condition of Readiness for Fleet Activities Sasebo on August 3\\\\. These levels rose as the typhoon approached Japan. Striking Kyushu as a typhoon, Francisco brought heavy rain and strong winds to much of the island. Rainfall peaked at in Nobeoka. Most of the rain fell within a 12-hour span, notably in Kitaura. Two cities observed record one-hourly rainfall accumulations: in both Nobeoka and Saiki. These rains triggered flash flooding in Nobeoka, damaging four homes, inundating many roads, and submerging cars. One person died of a heart attack when he was swept away by a flooded river in Kokonoe. A maximum wind gust of was observed at Miyazaki Airport. Many trees and signs were felled by the winds citywide, leaving debris strewn across roads. Some structures had windows shattered. Fallen trees took down power lines, leaving 24,710 homes without power. Three people suffered injury, one seriously, after being knocked over by strong winds. Strong winds in Fukuoka damaged a home and prompted the temporary closure of Kanmon Bridge. Wind gusts in Saga Prefecture reached . Following the typhoon, officials in Miyazaki Prefecture established a relief fund for affected farmers. Overall the rains proved beneficial for Fukuoka Prefecture which had been suffering from a drought. The combined rains from Danas, Francisco, and Lekima aided in filling Fukuoka Prefecture dam reached 81.2 percent capacity. Ahead of the typhoon's landfall in Kyushu, the system brought strong winds and heavy rain to the southern coast of Shikoku. Cape Ashizuri in Tosashimizu experienced peak gusts of . Off the coast of Minamib≈çs≈ç, Chiba, a fishing boat capsized amid rough seas produced by the typhoon on August 5\\\\. The boat's captain drowned and the one crew member suffered injury. At Kobe University, a rowing boat with 23 students aboard capsized due to high winds; the students were able to swim to shore without injury. Humid air brought north by the typhoon exacerbated the effects of a deadly heat wave in eastern Japan. The remnants of Francisco later brought heavy rain to Hokkaido on August 8‚Äì9. Accumulations reached in Ury≈´. Of this, fell within 12 hours, a record for that duration in the city. The Uryu River swelled to near-flood stage, prompting evacuation orders for 240 households in Fukagawa and 80 more in Numata. =Korean Peninsula= Tropical Storm Francisco over the Korea Strait on August 6 In anticipation of the storm's arrival, the Korean Meteorological Agency issued heavy rain warnings for eastern provinces and mountainous areas. Seagoing vessels were advised to stay at port in the Korea Strait and western Sea of Japan. TCCOR levels for Commander Fleet Activities Chinhae were raised beginning on August 5 and remained in place through the duration of the typhoon. Precipitation was greatest along the east coast, peaking at at Seoraksan. Mountainous areas experienced the greatest winds, with gusts reaching at an unspecified location. The overall effects of Francisco were limited; twelve structures sustained damage in Busan. Rain-slicked roads led to hazardous driving conditions, resulting in a few accidents. Two people were injured when a truck fell on its side. Isolated flooding affected parts of Gangwon Province, with several people requiring rescue. A baseball match between the Samsung Lions and NC Dinos was cancelled mid-game due to heavy rain. A weakening Francisco brought rainfall to parts of North Korea. Additional rainfall from Typhoon Lekima and subsequent storms led to flood concerns along the Tumen River in Rason. Twenty-five North Korean fishing boats seeking to avoid the storm sought refuge in Olga Bay within Russia's Primorsky Krai. =Russia= On August 7, the Russian Ministry of Emergencies warned of heavy rains and damaging winds in Primorsky Krai from the remnants of Francisco. Seagoing vessels were advised to avoid travel along the Primorsky coast until the storm abated. The was forced to dock early in Vladivostok. Forty rescue personnel were preemptively deployed to Khasansky, Lazovsky, and Ussuriysk in anticipation of flooding. Southern areas of Primorsky were most affected, with rainfall in some locations amounting to 60 percent of the August monthly average. Accumulations peaked at in Partizansk while Vladivostok saw . Most of the rain fell within a 12-hour period. Many rivers in the region rose by . Some roads were submerged, including the A370 portion of the Trans-Siberian Highway between Khabarovsk and Vladivostok; the highway was temporarily shut down in this location. A bridge near Krounovka was overtopped by a swollen river, isolating the village. A temporary boat crossing was established to ferry residents. Eighteen tourists became stranded in Yezhovaya Bay due to flooded roads. Several structures in Novostroyka experienced basement flooding. In Vladivostok strong winds downed multiple trees, leaving some neighborhoods without power and damaging cars.

While attending Boston English High School, he rented a room and earned a living by menial jobs. While still a high school student, he published a booklet on birds seen in Boston Public Garden. For about two years he was a bellhop at Boston's Women's City Club. When he graduated from high school, a lady whom he met while bird-watching helped him find work as an assistant to Edward Howe Forbush and John Birchard May, who were completing Forbush's Birds of Massachusetts and other New England States (3 vols., 1923‚Äì1929). After three years of work on the third volume of Forbush's book, Broun in 1929 went to work creating the Pleasant Valley Bird Sanctuary. There from 1929 to 1932 he cut six miles of trails and built a nature museum. While he was at Cape Cod, he met Irma Knowles Penniman (1908‚Äì1997), an ornithologist and conservationist, and married her on 15 January 1934. In 1934 the wealthy socialite, bird-watching enthusiast, and conservationist Rosalie Edge leased (with an option to buy) to establish Hawk Mountain Sanctuary and hired Maurice and Irma Broun as game wardens to exclude hunters. The land (in Eastern Pennsylvania) was purchased. With the exception of three years from 1942 to 1945 when he was a photographer with the Seabees in the South Pacific, Maurice Broun worked as a curator of Hawk Mountain Sanctuary from 1934 until his retirement in 1966. Maurice and Irma worked as a husband and wife team at the Sanctuary until 1966 and then moved to a farm one ridge to the west of Hawk Mountain. The couple continued work as naturalists and conservationists until he died of cancer in 1979. The couple had no children. After his death, Irma married Richard Kahn, and the Kahns moved to California.

It is situated north of Granite Mountain and east of Goat Mountain in the Mount Baker Wilderness, which is managed by the Mount Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest. Its nearest higher peak is Mount Sefrit, to the southwest. Precipitation runoff from the mountain drains into Silesia Creek, a tributary of the Fraser River. Climate Mount Chardonnay is located in the marine west coast climate zone of western North America. Chardonnay above Mamie Peak Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel northeast toward the Cascade Mountains. As fronts approach the North Cascades, they are forced upward by the peaks of the Cascade Range (Orographic lift), causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall onto the Cascades. As a result, the west side of the North Cascades experiences high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall. Due to its temperate climate and proximity to the Pacific Ocean, areas west of the Cascade Crest very rarely experience temperatures below or above . During winter months, weather is usually cloudy, but, due to high pressure systems over the Pacific Ocean that intensify during summer months, there is often little or no cloud cover during the summer. Because of maritime influence, snow tends to be wet and heavy, resulting in high avalanche danger. The months July through September offer the most favorable weather for viewing or climbing this peak. Geology Skagit Range seen from Mount Larrabee. Mt. Chardonnay slightly right of center The North Cascades features some of the most rugged topography in the Cascade Range with craggy peaks, ridges, and deep glacial valleys. Geological events occurring many years ago created the diverse topography and drastic elevation changes over the Cascade Range leading to the various climate differences. The history of the formation of the Cascade Mountains dates back millions of years ago to the late Eocene Epoch. With the North American Plate overriding the Pacific Plate, episodes of volcanic igneous activity persisted. In addition, small fragments of the oceanic and continental lithosphere called terranes created the North Cascades about 50 million years ago. During the Pleistocene period dating back over two million years ago, glaciation advancing and retreating repeatedly scoured the landscape leaving deposits of rock debris. The U-shaped cross section of the river valleys are a result of recent glaciation. Uplift and faulting in combination with glaciation have been the dominant processes which have created the tall peaks and deep valleys of the North Cascades area.

It is over 666 years old. The temple is situated on the west bank of Chao Phraya River, opposite to south of Ayutthaya City. The temple was built in 1353 by King Uthong (Ramathibodi I), who was the first monarch and founder of Ayutthaya Kingdom at the royal residence of \\"Wiang Lek\\" or \\"Wiang Hlek\\" from inconsistent writing, the site where he first settled before establishing Ayutthaya as the capital city in 1350. He built this temple to serve as a royal monastery after he had reigned for three years. The most striking aspect of this temple is a white prang (Khmer-style pagoda), located in the middle of the ancient compound and built on an indented pedestal protruding towards the north and south. According to the cosmology of Buddhism, the prang represents the cosmic Mount Meru. The main prang is surrounded by a square cloister. The cloister is enclosed by an outer wall, which along with the pillars inside supports the roof. The floor of the terrace is one step higher than the court. The inner wall of the cloister houses rows of golden glittering Sukhothai Buddha images on decorated bases. In the south area of the temple is the location of Wihan Phutthaisawan (reclining Buddha sanctuary). The building is currently only walls. Inside enshrines a large reclining Buddha image. In addition, there are other interesting things, such as Phra Ubosot, Buddhaghosa Residence, Three Kings Monument, and the murals etc. Wat Phutthaisawan was one of the temples that survived the destruction during the second fall of Ayutthaya in 1767, so the temple remains in its decent condition in present day. Moreover, Wat Phutthaisawan is also well known as a krabi-krabong (ancient Thai sword fighting) school since Ayutthaya period until the present day under the name \\"Phutthaisawan Sword School\\".

Unlike her sister whose works were in the traditional Bacone flatstyle, Mauldin worked in various styles using a variety of media like acrylic, collage, ink, pencil, oil, and watercolor. Early works trend towards photorealism, while some of her later pieces reflect more modern free-flowing trends. She exhibited at the First Annual Invitational Exhibition of American Indian Paintings of the U.S. Department of the Interior hosted in Washington, D. C. between November 1964 and January 1965. Two of her pieces exhibited at the Philbrook Museum of Art's Annual in 1965 were purchased by the Department of the Interior. In 1972, Mauldin and her sister Valjean were featured in an exhibit produced by the Heard Museum of Phoenix, Arizona. The sisters often exhibited work together. She won the watercolor category prize in 1976 at the Scottsdale National Indian Art Show and in 1978, she was honored with the Jerome Tiger Award of the Five Civilized Tribes Museum. She was one of the women invited to participate in the National Indian Women's Art Show hosted at the Via Gambaro Gallery of Washington, D. C. in 1980. The next year, she and her sister were participants in the Kennedy Arts Center‚Ä≤s exhibition Night of the First Americans in Washington D. C. The following year, the Indian Arts and Crafts Board hosted a solo exhibition, Painting by Jane McCarty Mauldin at the Southern Plains Indian Museum in Anadarko, Oklahoma. In 1985, Mauldin participated along with her sister Valjean and Mary Adair (Cherokee), Jean Bales (Iowa), Joan Brown (Cherokee), Sharron Ahtone Harjo (Kiowa), Ruthe Blalock Jones (Delaware-Shawnee-Peoria), and Virginia Stroud (Keetoowah Band Cherokee-Muscogee Creek) in the Daughters of the Earth exhibit which traveled for three years (1985‚Äì1988), touring in the United States and Europe. She was one of the featured artists at the 1990 Native American Fair hosted in Oklahoma City and also exhibited at the Red Earth Festival, winning 2nd place in drawing. That year she also placed 2nd in painting in the Five Civilized Tribe Annual. In 1993, Mauldin, K. Henderson (Cherokee) and Jeanne Walker Rorex (Echota Cherokee) were selected for a three-woman exhibit for the Sand Springs Museum's Fall Art Show. Mauldin won more than 100 awards in the course of her career from the Five Civilized Tribes Museum, the Heard Museum, the Philbrook Museum, the Heritage Center of the Red Cloud Indian School in Pine Ridge, South Dakota and the Santa Fe Indian Market, among others. She was designated as a \\"Master Artist\\" by the Five Civilized Tribes Museum in Muskogee, Oklahoma, shortly before her death. Death and legacy Mauldin died from a brain tumor on October 27, 1997 in Tulsa and was buried at Ridgelawn Cemetery, in Collinsville, Oklahoma on October 31. In 2000, her work was selected for the all-women American Indian Women Art and Soul exhibition held at the Red Earth Museum in Oklahoma City.

It is a standardized event in track meets conducted by the NFHS in American high school competition. When the organization went through metrication, finalized with their 1980 rule book, the 4 lap around a 440 yard, Imperial measured mile run, was replaced by the closest metric distance, 4 laps around a 400 meter track. That decision is not without controversy. The race is 9.344 meters shorter. Other organizations have followed the lead of the IAAF and use the 1500 meters as the closest equivalent. The current male high school record holder in the 1600 is Alan Webb from South Lakes High School in Reston, Virginia. He ran 3:59.51 at the Arcadia Invitational against high school athletes on April 14, 2001. Six weeks later, while running a mile against seasoned international runners at the Prefontaine Classic, he was timed in 3:51.83. Many, including Track and Field News recognize the faster time, since he was technically still in high school at the time, but NFHS only recognizes the race against other high school competitors. The female record is less disputed as Alexa Efraimson from Camas High School in Camas, Washington ran her 4:33.29 at the Washington State 4A Championships exclusively against other high school girls. 1600 meters is also the distance of the final leg of a distance medley relay, because it is an even 4 laps where at 3.75 laps, the 1500 would require the start line or finish line to be moved. The term when used in the phrase 1600 meter relay, usually is referring to the 4x400 meter relay, however the 2-2-4-8 version of the sprint medley relay is also 1600 meters.

It was squatted in 1985 and evicted in 1990. Occupation The Wolters Noordhoff Complex (WNC) was a former printers occupied on 26 November, 1985, by the \\"hardest core of the squatters.\\" The building was located on the Oude Boteringestraat in Groningen and became a social centre with diverse activities. These included a bookshop, a feminist caf√©, pirate radio, a recordshop, a rehearsal space and a music venue. Murder On 20 April, 1990 (a month before the eventual eviction), the body of a 22 year old squatter called Marco was discovered on the Poststraat, near to the WNC complex. Marco put on the Black Sky radio show broadcasting from the WNC. At first, the police suspected he had committed suicide since there was rope both around his neck and hanging in his room. But the pieces of rope did not match and it became more likely that Marco had been murdered by a German punk nicknamed Satan after they had quarrelled over the love of a woman called Karin. Karin and her friends smuggled Satan out of Groningen and he was never charged with a crime. He later burnt down a squat in Berlin. The police investigated the case in 1990, in 1999/2000 and in 2004/2005, but it was only in 2015 when more witnesses statements came to light that it could be concluded that Satan had indeed murdered Marco. Eviction After the squatters provoked a riot in order to provoke the planned police action, the eviction took place on 26 May 1990. There were 137 arrests and Mayor A.A.M.F. Staatsen termed it \\"war.\\" The WNC was demolished the next day. At the first trial of the squatters, the prosecution asked for 9 month jail sentences and complained that previously the police had been unable to arrest people who committed unspecified crimes and then escaped into the WNC. The prosecution said the squatters had organised the eviction resistance for months in advance and asked people to come from other cities. They had barricaded themselves in the building and behaved like army units. The police had found sharpened iron bars, smoke bombs and paint bombs. The squatters' lawyer replied that since the state had no real evidence of violent disorder it was relying on the charge of criminal organisation.

She was nicknamed La Musa del Papaloapan (\\"The Muse from Papaloapan River\\") by the press and critics from the period. Since the age of 15 she published her poetry in newspapers such as El dictamen, El correo de Sotavento, La voz de Sotavento, and La voz de Tlacotalpan. Some of her pen names were \\"X√≥chitl\\", \\"Tololoche\\", and \\"Matusal√©n\\".  Life  Murillo was born in her family's home, located next to the Papaloapan River in Veracruz where her family had resided since colonial times. Her parents were Mariano Murillo and Manuela Carlin. She was the second of eight siblings. She remained single as a result of the death of her suitor Lorenzo de la Puente Aguirre, who was stricken by a fever that caused him a rapid death in just three days. Due to the asthma that Murillo suffered, she was unable to properly attend school and for that she received her first lyrical teachings from two paternal aunts, and subsequently became an autodicact and learned various languages. At this point in her life she used to read many Romantic writers both national and international such as Victor Hugo and Alphonse de Lamartine. She wrote her first poetic works when she was 15 years old under the pen name \\"X√≥chitl\\". She was a self-taught polyglot and learned Zapotec from the sugarcane workers who were staying at her father's house. She learned English, French and Latin from books in her father's library.  Work In general, Josefa Murillo's work has been read as poetry of a love and nostalgic theme, although part of what characterizes it is the irony with which she presents gender roles. The place of spectators that the world attributed to women from the time it makes its ability to observe details sharpen, and therefore become people with a sharp look, resulting in, on many occasions, satirical texts and social criticism. The latter can be seen in her poems \\"Gal√°n de d√≠a\\" and \\"Indecisi√≥n\\". Like many other Romantics, Josefa Murillo's poetry includes themes that refer to emotional moods and also to metaphysical concerns, such as life, death, the transience of time, and eternity. Another theme that is included in Murillo's work is the opposition between man and nature; describing man with dyes of vitality, strength, unconsciousness and irrationality and the second as a rational entity, with limitations and conscience. After a year of Murillo's death, that is, in 1899, Cayetano Rodr√≠guez Beltr√°n organized a National Tribute where the poet's artistic production was praised. In it some of the most important contemporary personages of the medium participated such as Justo Sierra, Amado Nervo, Jos√© Mar√≠a Vigil and Luis G. Urbina. Despite this effort, her work was not collected until 1927 and published until 1961. Some analysts of her work, such as C√©sar G√≥mez Ca√±edo, say that the geographical isolation of the poet significantly influenced her work (not in a negative manner), but enriched it because intellectually speaking, Murillo was not at all in isolation or seclusion. The truth is that Josefa Murillo always wanted to leave the paternal house although she never succeeded, and even sent a letter to Benito Ju√°rez where she requested to force her father, Mr. Murillo, to let her leave Tlacotalpan. There is another version that ensures that the letter was not written precisely with the goal of leaving her father's house, but that he asked the president for support to continue her studies because the detention and her status as a woman made this desire difficult. Leonardo Pasquel says that probably because of her isolation, Murillo had enough time to read many authors whose influence can be seen in her poetry such as Hienrich Heine, B√©cquer and even Salvador D√≠az Mir√≥n to whom she dedicates her only tribute through a sonnet. The relationship of Murillo's work with that of B√©cquer was one of the features that were most strongly reported in the National Tribute, at which time the author was paid more attention. Antonio de la Pe√±a y Reyes places the poet within the Mexican canonical assessment of the time.  Critical reception  The poetry of Josefa Murillo had a reception that interpreted it as coming from a painful and fragile woman, who remained in permanent home confinement and isolation. For this life that Murillo led many of the interpretations to her works celebrate the elevation and delicacy of her feminine poetry, for being also a tragic woman in love (since her fianc√© died).

The rhomboid major, rhomboid minor, and levator scapulae periscapular muscles are transferred laterally on the scapula to replace the functions of the lower, middle, and upper fibers of the trapezius, respectively. The transferred muscles hold the scapula in a more medial and upwardly rotated position, without winging.  Versions  = Eden-Lange procedure = The original technique was first described by Eden in 1924 and verified by Lange in the 1950s. The rhomboid major and rhomboid minor were transferred laterally from the medial border of the scapula to the infraspinatous fossa, and the levator scapulae was transferred laterally to the spine of the scapula, near the acromion. = Modified Eden-Lange procedure = The procedure was first modified by Bigliani et all in 1996. The change was transferring the rhomboid minor to the supraspinatous fossa to allow the rhomboid minor to better replicate line of pull of the middle trapezius. = Triple tendon transfer = The triple tendon transfer (T3 transfer) was described by Elhassan et all at the Mayo Clinic in 2015, and since 2010 no other technique for intractable trapezius palsy has been used there. Like the original and modified Eden-Lange procedures, the levator scapulae is transferred to the scapular spine. In the T3 transfer, rather than transferring the rhomboids to the scapular fossae, they are transferred to the scapular spine, which better replicates the trapezius‚Äô action of scapular upward rotation. In detail, the rhomboid minor is transferred to just medial of the transferred levator scapulae, and the rhomboid major is transferred to the medial scapular spine.  Indications  Symptomatic trapezius palsy lasting longer than 1 year indicates tendon transfer, since spontaneous recovery and nerve repair are unlikely to be successful then. Conservative management, such as physical therapy, is generally unsuccessful. Symptomatic trapezius agenesis or hypogenesis, although rare, could be mitigated with an Eden-Lange procedure.  Contraindications  Additional muscle deficits can contraindicate tendon transfer, namely the serratus anterior muscle or the muscles-to-be-transferred themselves. Serratus anterior muscle deficit is another cause of scapular winging and decreases the efficacy of an Eden-Lange procedure, but it can be overcome with a simultaneous pectoralis major transfer. Muscular dystrophy often contraindicates tendon transfer, because the muscles transferred are either dystrophic or capable of becoming dystrophic. A pertinent example is facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD), which commonly affects the trapezius, causing a need for scapular stabilization, but also commonly affects other periscapular muscles, which contraindicates the transfer. Collagen disorders contraindicate tendon transfers in general, including the Eden-Lange procedure. Scapulothoracic fusion, a salvage procedure, can be done when tendon transfer is contraindicated or in cases of failed tendon transfers.  Risks  The dorsal scapular nerve is at risk for intraoperative injury when detaching the rhomboid and levator scapulae insertions due to its proximity to the medial scapular border. This is of particular concern because the dorsal scapular nerve innervates all three muscles transferred in the Eden-Lange procedure.

One of her pieces of writing was praised as \\"launching the 'second wave' of trans studies.\\" Early life Chu gave an account of her early life when she was interviewed in 2018 by Michelle Esther O'Brien for the New York City Trans Oral History Project. She was born in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, where her father was finishing a medical residency at the University of North Carolina and her mother was in graduate school. A few years later, Chu moved with her family to Asheville, North Carolina. Although she described Asheville as a \\"very hippy dippy kind of place,\\" Chu said that she was \\"raised pretty Christian\\" and described herself as \\"very goody two shoes.\\" She attended a small Christian school. Her family belonged to a conservative Presbyterian church. Chu described her childhood as \\"saturated\\" with Christianity. Chu went to Duke University for college, attending from 2010 through 2014. For three years she was a theatre major and graduated with a degree in literature. During college she did \\"lots of theatre.\\" Chu is currently a doctoral student in comparative literature at New York University. Career In 2018 Chu published \\"On Liking Women\\" in N+1 magazine, an essay in which she considered her own gender transition, discussed her fascination for Valerie Solanas' SCUM Manifesto, and explored how her attitudes about her gender transition evolved in relation to feminist writings she had read. In the essay, Chu wrote, \\"The truth is I have never been able to differentiate liking women from wanting to be like them.\\" Chu has also published in academic journals, writing about Hegel's remarks on Africa in the Lectures on the Philosophy of World History in the Journal of Speculative Philosophy (2018) and about the impossibility of feminism in differences, a Journal of Feminist Cultural Studies (2019). Chu also wrote an opinion piece published in The New York Times, \\"My New Vagina Won't Make Me Happy.\\" In that piece, written a few days before Chu underwent sex reassignment surgery, she discussed her gender dysphoria, her experiences with hormone therapy, and questioned the widespread belief that gender transitioning will make a trans person feel better. \\"There are no good outcomes in transition,\\" she wrote. \\"There are only people, begging to be taken seriously.\\" Chu wrote about her experiences as a teaching assistant for Avital Ronell at New York University, stating that based on those experiences she believed the accusations of sexual harassment leveled at Ronell by graduate student Nimrod Reitman. Chu's first book, Females, was published in 2019. Essayist and poet Kay Gabriel writes for the London Review of Books, \\" Chu makes a claim about what she calls an ontological, or an existential, condition. Being female, in her account, is a subject position outside and against politics.\\" Chu's ontological approach to theories of gender/sexuality pulls from a variety of cultural and philosophical references such as Valerie Solanas's musings on Candy Darling, The Matrix, Lacanian psychoanalysis and castration anxiety, sissy porn, and the comedic bits.  Reception  Transgender writer and professor Sandy Stone praised \\"On Liking Women\\" for \\"launching ‚Äòthe second wave‚Äô of trans studies.\\" Mareile Pfannebecker, in the London School of Economics' Long Read Review, wrote of Chu's \\"admirable boldness,\\" noting how effectively she \\"makes the case that the gender experience of trans women like her rests not on identity but on desire.\\" Amia Srinivasan criticized \\"On Liking Women,\\" writing in the London Review of Books that Chu's essay \\"threatens to bolster the argument made by anti-trans feminists: that trans women equate, and conflate, womanhood with the trappings of traditional femininity, thereby strengthening the hand of patriarchy.\\" Chu responded to Srinivasan's criticisms in a dialogue with Anastasia Berg that was published in The Point. The New York Times published two reader letters, dissenting from Chu's essay \\"My New Vagina Won't Make Me Happy.\\" The letters were published under the title \\"Feeling Better After Gender Transition.\\" Kai Cheng Thom, writing in Slate, offered a detailed criticism of \\"My New Vagina Won't Make Me Happy.\\" Conceding that Chu is \\"often brilliant,\\" Thom criticized Chu's New York Times essay as potentially damaging to the cause of trans acceptance, by confirming \\"unfortunate stereotypes of how people talk and write about trans people.\\" Thom went on to say: > [I]n her piece, she uses sensational language that feeds the lurid interest > in trans people‚Äôs bodies at the expense of our rights and privacy. And in > arguing for her right to transition no matter her uncertainty at the > outcome, she largely ignores what we do know about the outcomes of > transition for most people. With an audience the size of the New York > Times‚Äô, that could do real damage. \\"My New Vagina Won't Make Me Happy\\" also drew attention from conservative publications such as The American Conservative, in which commentator Rod Dreher highlighted Chu's essay as \\"an icon of our radically disordered culture.\\" Personal life In her November 2018 interview with the New York City Trans Oral History Project, Chu said that she was in a relationship with a \\"wonderful cis woman\\" who was very helpful in preparing for Chu's sex reassignment surgery. Discussing the relationship, Chu stated, \\"[h]eterosexuality is so much better when there aren't any men in the equation.\\"  Bibliography  *Females (2019). Verso.

It is similar to the species Pholiota squarrosa. There are differing accounts on whether the mushroom is edible. Description This mushroom grows in crowded clusters, with caps up to in diameter and stems up to in length. The caps are convex at first, becoming flattened with age, and are sticky when wet. They are yellowish-brown with prominent cone-shaped, tawny scales which are crowded together near the centre. The gills are closely packed, yellow at first becoming rusty-brown later. The stem is the same colour as the cap and is covered with small scales. Near the top it bears a cottony yellowish ring which flares out. The spores are brown. It is difficult to distinguish this species from Pholiota squarrosa, but that mushroom has a greenish tinge to the gills and is never sticky. Edibility The species was reported as edible \\"with caution\\" by Kent and Vera McKnight, but that it can be confused with the poisonous P. squarrosa. Mycologist Alexander H. Smith wrote that it is the best edible species in its genus. Roger Phillips regards it as edible, but a description provided by the University of Arkansas states that it is not. Habitat The species can commonly be found in late summer in the Great Lakes states, the Pacific Northwest, and eastern North America. Its habitat is on the bark of hardwood trees. It is rarely found in Europe, but the first specimen in Poland was discovered in 2010 in the southwestern part of the country. The Poland discovery happened at the ≈Åƒô≈ºczok Nature Reserve near the town of Racib√≥rz. The mushroom might also be found in the temperate regions of Asia. Although the mushroom is considered a saprophyte, rather than a parasite, it can cause the wood to degrade rapidly. In the Great Lakes region of the United States, it has decayed and does decay logs of the trees Acer saccharum and Tilia glabra.

She carried 500 men from the 30th Regiment of Foot under Lieutenant-Colonel Lockhart for any landing operations that might be required. The British squadron sought to eliminate the Dutch in an effort to safeguard the trade route with China, which ran through the Straits of Malacca and were in range of Dutch raiders operating from the principal Javan port of Batavia. With the destruction of the Dutch forces in Griessie, the last of the Dutch naval forces in the Pacific were eliminated. Worcester returned to Madras on 13 February 1808. Worcester was at Point de Galle on 14 March. The homeward bound fleet of Indiamen left her behind. She had sustained damage and it was expected that she would sail to Bombay or Bengal for repairs.LL ‚Ññ2915. Homeward bound, she reached the Cape on 19 September and St Helena on 19 October.

Most knowledge about the sedimentary basins came from exploration drilling when searching for oil and gas. The essential feature of this information is that each layer is penetrated by the wells in a number of scattered locations. This raises the problem of identifying each layer in all wells ‚Äì the geological correlation problemVan Wagoner J., Mitchum R., Campion, K. and Rahmanian V.

Kearey, Philip (2001). Dictionary of Geology (2nd ed.) London, New York, etc.: Penguin Reference, London, p. 123 The similarity of layers is decreasing as the distance between the cross-sections increases that leads to ambiguity of the correlation scheme that indicates which layers penetrated at different locations belong to the same body (see A). To improve the results geologists take in consideration the spatial relations between layers, which restricted the number of acceptable correlations. The first restriction was formulated in XVII century: the sequence of layers is the same in any cross-section. The second one was discovered by Haites in 1963T. Binnert Heites. (1963).

How Oil Drilling Works. https://science.howstuffworks.com/environmental/energy/oil-drilling.htm Drilling gives the most detailed information about the position, thickness, physical, chemical and biological characteristics of each layer, but the point is that each well presents all this information in one location on the layer. Because the geometry of a layer can be very complicated it becomes a difficult problem and requires a significant number of drilled wells. The challenge is identifying in each well the interval that belongs to the same layer now or in the pastVoronin, Y.A., Methodological issues of application of mathematical methods and computers in geology. Published by the Computer Center, Siberian Division of the USSR Academy of Sciences. Novosibirsk, Yakutsk: 1973. (see A). To do this geologists use all available characteristics of the layer. Only after this it is possible to begin the recovery of the geometry of the layer (to be more precise ‚Äì the geometry of the top and bottom surfaces of the layer). This procedure is called geological correlation, and the results are presented as acorrelation scheme (A). It is natural that at the beginning of the exploration, when the number of wells is small, the correlation scheme contains expensive mistakes.Randle C., Bond C., Lark M., Monaghan A. Can uncertainty in geological cross-section interpretations be quantified and predicted? Geosphere (2018) 14 (3): 1087‚Äì1100. https://doi.org/10.1130/GES01510.1  Basics of geological correlation  The Danish scientist Nicolas Steno (1638‚Äì1686) is credited with three principles of sedimentation Steno, Nicolas (1916). Nicolas Steno's Dissertation Concerning a Solid Body Enclosed by Process of Nature within a Solid: An English Version with an Introduction and Explanatory Notes. Translated by Winter, John. New York, The Macmillan company; London, Macmillan and company, limited.pages=229‚Äì230 # superposition: in undeformed stratigraphic sequences the oldest strata will be at the bottom of the succession, # original horizontality: layers of sediment are originally deposited horizontally, # lateral continuity: layers of sediments initially extend laterally in all directions. The principles 1 allows defining the temporary relations between neighboring geological bodies, the principle 2 organizes the geometrical pattern of the succession of layers, the principle 3 helps uniting the parts of the layer found in separated geological cross-sections. Practical correlation has a lot of difficulties: fuzzy borders of the layers, variations in composition and structure of the rocks in the layer, unconformities in the sequence of layers, etc. This is why errors in correlation schemes are not seldom. When the distances between available cross-sections are decreasing (for example, by drilling new wells) the quality of correlation is improving, but meanwhile the wrong geological decisions could be made that increases the expenses of geological projects. From Steno's principle of initial horizontality follows that the top borders of the layers (tops) were initially flat, and remained flat until the complete succession stays undisturbed by subsequent tectonic movements, but no regularities about the geometric relations between these flat surfaces in the succession were known. The first to shed light on the problem was Canadian geologist Binner Heites: in 1963 he published the Geological Perspective Correlation hypothesis. Perspective geological correlation is a theory that establishes strong geometrical restrictions on the geometry of the layers in sedimentary deposits. Perspective geometry in undisturbed succession of layers  (B) Heites' perspective correlation (C) Correlation plot In 1963 the Canadian geologist Binner Heites discovered a strong regularity of the layering in sedimentary basins: the thicknesses of layers within each stratigraphic unit are governed by the law of perspective correspondence. It means that in undisturbed succession on the correlation scheme the straight lines drawn through the border points of the same layer in two cross-sections intersect in one point ‚Äì center of perspectivity (see B). For geological purposes more convenient geometrical presentation of perspective relations is the correlation plot proposed by JekhowskyJekhowsky, B. de, La methode des distances minimales, nouveau procede quantitative de correlation stratigraphique, exemple d'application on paleontologie. Rev. Inst. Fran√ß. Du Petrole, Paris, 1963, vol. XVIII, No. 5, 629‚Äì653. (see C): the depths of the layer's borders in one geologic cross-section are plotted along axis h‚Ä≤ (h1‚Ä≤, h2‚Ä≤, h3‚Ä≤,...), and the position of the same layers in another cross-section are plotted along axis h‚Ä≤‚Ä≤ (h1‚Ä≤‚Ä≤, h2‚Ä≤‚Ä≤, h3‚Ä≤‚Ä≤, ...). Points 1, 2, 3 ‚Ä¶ with coordinates (h1‚Ä≤, h1‚Ä≤‚Ä≤), (h2‚Ä≤, h2‚Ä≤‚Ä≤), and (h3‚Ä≤, h3‚Ä≤‚Ä≤), accordingly, are called correlation points, and a curve drawn through these points, a correlation line. Black dots (connectors) represent the relative position of correlated borders on the plot. When the layers geometry satisfies the conditions of perspective correspondence the correlation line is a straight line. In the particular case of parallel layers the inclination of the correlation line is 450. The Perspective Geological Correlation also states that #each sedimentary basin consists of a number of stratigraphic units (sequence of layers without unconformities), and #in each unit the relations between the thicknesses of the layers in two cross-sections satisfy the perspective geometry conditions with individual ratios K. Heites also concludes that all strata in each unit were governed by the same rate of deposition, and their borders are synchronous time-planes. Each layer has different thicknesses in different locations, but they lasted equally long. It was a significant input in chronostratigraphy. The following are consequences of the basic statements: # In different stratigraphic horizons the slopes of the correlation lines are different. # If two adjacent sections have the same slope then both sections belong to the same stratigraphic horizon. The gap between the lines indicates a fault. # If on the correlation line that presents the undisturbed stratigraphic succession one correlation point doesn't fit the line it means that a) the correlation of the tops of the corresponding layer is wrong, or b) lithologic replacement.  Connections to traditional lithostratigraphy  The Perspective Geological Correlation is well grounded in traditional geology. The method of convergence maps serves for determining the structure of the layer based on the known structure of the layers lying above. It is based on the assumption that the layers are close to parallel.Hain, B.E., and Lomidze, M.G., 1995, Geotectonica s osnovami geodinamiki ( Geotectonics with basics of geodynamics): Moscow State University, Moscow, 480 Convergence map shows lines of equal distance (isopach lines) between key layer and target layer.Tearpock, Daniel J. and Bischke, Richard E. (2002), Applied Subsurface Geological Mapping with Structural Methods (2nd Edition), Prentice-Hall, Englewood Cliffs 822 p. If the layers are parallel the distance between these layers is constant, the structures of both layers are identical, and to determine depths of the target horizon it is enough to get only one deep well, which reached the target layer. But in reality such conditions are extremely rare. In reality restoring the geometry of the target horizon demands a number of deep wells in the area. In this case the standard procedure for calculating the distance between the target layer and key layer in any point in the area is linear interpolation between the known wells.Yang Q. & Bursik M. A new interpolation method to model thickness, isopachs, extent, and volume of tephra fall deposits. Bulletin of Volcanology volume 78, article number 68 (2016). The reliability of the result (the geometrical structure of the target horizon) is estimated by the analysis of the trend of the distances between key horizon and target horizon (isopachs): if the trend is regular, for example, the distances are monotonically changing in one direction, it is a sign of reliability of the reconstruction. In the simplest case the surface of the target horizon is a plain in general position, and the linear interpolation gives the correct result. The assumptions of the convergence method are consequences of the perspective correlations theory, so, the method obtains the theoretical background. The theory also gave an additional criteria for the validity of the reconstructed surface. It defines the stratigraphic interval where layers were deposited without interruption, and where the layers' thicknesses satisfy the law of perspective geometry.The convergence maps deliver the correct result only when the layers belong to such stratigraphic unit.  Testing  (D) Correlation plot for two cross- sections in Innisfail field (Alberta.

The idea attracted the programmers working on automation of correlation on computers: the known rules of correlation were fuzzy, and it was impossible to formalize them and transform them into algorithms. The restrictions of the geometry of layering observed by Heites allowed compensating the lack of nonformal human knowledge.

All four tilts of the linear segments are different, which indicates on three unconformities In 1964 Shaw proposed the method of correlating fossiliferous stratigraphic profiles using the two-axis graph (H) Shaw, A. B., 1964, Time in Stratigraphy: New York, McGraw-Hill, 365 p. . The markers on each axis are the observed depths of lowest (FAD) and highest (LAD) occurrences of a specially defined group of fossils (taxa). The appearances/ disappearances of taxa are regarded as synchronous and used as markers of correlation. When projected on a graph, the corresponding points of two compared profiles form the Line of Correlation (LOC). Shaw showed that the ideal LOC consists of linear segments (H). Such conditions occur when the number of collected fossils is big, and one can be sure that the material covers the complete range of fossils appearance, and FADs and LADs can be accurately determined. In the reality, some sampled ranges will be shorter than true ranges, and this can disturb the linearity of the LOC. In every stratigraphic interval correlated ends of the range (FAD or LAD) belong to the same time surface, and in each geological cross-section (well or outcrop) this interval has identical duration but different thickness. It means that accumulation rates (thickness-to-duration ratio = tg Œ≤) are different in different locations. From the fact that the relation of durations of the units and their thicknesses are linear follows that in the limits of the linear section of LOC all strata have the same accumulation rate. The reliability and accuracy of Shaw's method have been tested by EdwardsEdwards, L.E. (1984) Insights on why graphic correlation (Shaw's method) works.

The graphical correlation became a very important tool of stratigraphy in coal and oil industries. In 1988 Nemec showed the equivalence of Haites' perspective correlation, and Shaw's graphical correlation  Sedimentation model  (K) Position of layers in undisturbed sequence of layers (L) The axis of rotation is located far onshore (M) Forecasting the thickness of the stratigraphic unit on remote distances Based on the theory of perspective correlation in 1986 S. Guberman proposed a model of the process of sedimentationGuberman S. Informal analysis in geology and geophysics. Moscow, Nedra, 1986.According Haites‚Äô theory in the given sedimentary basin in each stratigraphic unit the condition of perspective correspondence are satisfied in any pair of wells. From this follows that the tops and bases of the layers in this stratigraphic unit satisfy the conditions of perspective correspondence in 3-D space (K). Any three points of a plane define the complete plane. It means that if in three wells the thicknesses of layers belonging to the same stratigraphic unit are known, then the thicknesses of these layers can be calculated for any location in the basin. Accordingly, if the structure of the top border of the stratigraphic unit is known, the structure of any other border in this unit can be calculated. The model of creating such sophisticated geometrical pattern is based on the first Steno's principle: the strata are originally horizontal, i.e. are planes. It occurs in the shallow waters due to the turbulence of the undersurface layer of water. The second Steno's principle, which indicates the creation of a series of sedimentary layers lying on top of each others, supposes the subsidence of the basin. The sinking of the basin follows the strong geometrical restrictions: the tectonic bloc, which carry the basin, is rotating around the straight line parallel to the water surface, and located onshore (L). As a result, until the moment of main tectonic disturbance all borders of the layers remain flat and the geometrical inter- relations are described as perspective correspomdence. In the future the tectonic movements will distort the shape of the layers ‚Äì the borders will no more be planes, but in majority of cases the changes are smooth and the perspective relations are maintained. This model allows specifying some geological terms. The Steno's horizontality principle has to state: the top surface of the sediments is horizontal.The conformity is a fundamental notion in stratigraphy. Until now this term is used in two different meanings: a surface between two stratigraphic sequances, and the relationship between two stratigraphic units. Sometimes both were used in the same paragraph (see Shanmugan G. Origin, Recognition, and Importance of Erosional Unconformities in Sedimentary Basins. (In: Ed. K.L. Kleinspehn, . C. Paola . New Perspectives in Basin Analysis. Springer, 1988., page 84).Perspective correlation principle allows to define the notion of conformity: sequence of layers that obey the conditions of geometrical perspective is a unit of conformity. Two neighboring units of conformity are in relation of unconformity. Here is an example that shows that the borders of undisturbed stratigraphic unit in the Middle Carboniferous (Volga-Ural oil province, Russia) initially were plains. In the central part of the area (about 100 km in diameter) were chosen three wells at distances of 10 ‚Äì 15 km.. The three tops of the stratigraphic unit in the three wells are points in 3D space with coordinates x, y, z, where x and y are present the position of the well on the surface (M), and z is the thickness of the stratigraphic unit in this location. They determine the top plain of the unit as it was at the time of its creation. The three bases determine the bottom plane of the unit at it was at the same time. This allowed calculateing the thickness of the stratigraphic unit at any point in the area. Because the area was well enough drilled the calculated numbers can be compared with the real numbers. The average difference equals 2%.

Historical relations  In 1918, when Iceland, through the Union Act, became a sovereign State, Denmark assumed the foreign relations of the new State, so that the Danish Diplomatic Missions and Consulates were also available to Iceland's interests . However, as early as 1921 a mission made up of Icelandic special delegates arrived in Spain to negotiate with the Spanish Government the tariffs on cod. On the other hand, in 1925, Iceland appointed a special, non-diplomatic representative, residing in Barcelona to serve the commercial interests of his country with all the Mediterranean countries. When in 1944 Iceland was constituted as a Republic and definitively separated from Denmark, the Minister of the Legation of Spain in Copenhagen represented Spain in Iceland under multiple accreditation regime. The formal date of the establishment of diplomatic relations of Spain with the Republic of Iceland is 24 November 1949. In 1966 the rank was raised to Embassy and since then it is the ambassador of Spain in Norway who is also accredited as Ambassador in Reykjavik and the Ambassador of Iceland in France is accredited as Ambassador in Madrid.Islandia Relacones con Espa√±a.

From the commercial point of view, Spain is systematically among the top 10 customers in Iceland, due to the massive importation of fish. This is not the case in the opposite direction, so the trade balance is systematically unfavorable to Spain, with a coverage rate that barely reaches 31%. As for tourism, some 40,000 Icelanders visit Spain annually, which was drastically halted due to the crisis and depreciation of the Icelandic crown, decreasing the number of Icelandic tourists to 24,437 in 2012. From that year the growth has recovered, and Icelandic tourists to Spain have been 14,016 in 2013 and 54,014 in 2014. The most visited Spanish destination is Canary Islands (24,016 tourists in 2014, with a decrease of ‚àí12.8% compared to the previous year). The appreciation of euro has driven the increase in Spanish tourism in Iceland, which went from 10,438 people in 2008 to 13,771 in 2009, to go down to 12,237 in 2010.

Educated as a priest, he taught at the Marijampolƒó Gymnasium in 1881‚Äì1887 and 1906‚Äì1914 and was active as an amateur linguist. Kriauƒçi≈´nas was born into a well-off Lithuanian family in Suvalkija. He attended Marijampolƒó Gymnasium and Sejny Priest Seminary. As a good student, he obtained a stipend from the Archbishop of Mogilev to study at the Saint Petersburg Roman Catholic Theological Academy. However, the stipend obligated him to work at the Archdiocese of Mogilev. Therefore, he declined the final ordination to priesthood and attended University of Warsaw for a year to get a teaching diploma. He then returned to Lithuania and became a teacher at the Marijampolƒó Gymnasium. He taught Latin, Lithuanian, German and Greek languages and encouraged his students, many of whom later became prominent figures in independent Lithuania, to be proud of their Lithuanian identity and heritage. He defied the Lithuanian press ban teaching his students Lithuanian in the Latin alphabet and not the government-imposed Cyrillic script. Kriauƒçi≈´nas actively supported Au≈°ra and Varpas, the key Lithuanian-language periodicals. He was forced to resign from the gymnasium in 1887 and found employment with the Marijampolƒó Court. In 1889, he was assigned as justice of the peace to where he spent a decade. During his free time, he continued to study linguistics. While his contemporaries were impressed by his wealth of knowledge, he wrote very little. His home was frequently visited by various activists and scholars. He was particularly close with Vincas Kudirka. In 1899, he lost his government job and was forced to take up a private attorney practice in Marijampolƒó until he was able to regain his teaching position at the Marijampolƒó Gymnasium in 1906. He taught Latin and Lithuanian languages and law. During World War I, the gymnasium evacuated to Yaroslavl where he died in January 1916. Biography =Early life and education= Kriauƒçi≈´nas was born on to a well-off family of Lithuanian farmers in located near the Russia‚ÄìPrussia border between Vi≈°tytis and Kybartai. He was the eldest of eight children. His father was an educated man who acted as a local lay judge. The family owned about 150 morgens of land. As many parents of the time, Kriauƒçi≈´nas' family wanted him to become a Catholic priest and sent him to get education. He first studied at a primary school in Vi≈°tytis and in 1864 enrolled into a four-year school in Marijampolƒó. In the aftermath of the Uprising of 1863, the school was undergoing reorganization ‚Äì it was transformed into a seven-year gymnasium and teaching language switched from Polish to Russian in 1866‚Äì1867. Despite widespread Polonization and Russification, Kriauƒçi≈´nas was proud of his Lithuanian identity and heritage. He started comparing Lithuanian words with Latin and Greek words exploring their Indo-European roots (he got up to the letter P). When one teacher mocked the Lithuanian language, he translated the poem Czego chcesz od nas, Panie by Jan Kochanowski and the fable The Old Man and Death by Ivan Krylov into Lithuanian and read them during a graduation ceremony. After graduating from the gymnasium, Kriauƒçi≈´nas became a cleric at the Sejny Priest Seminary in 1871. He was a good student and worked as an assistant librarian keeping up with the newest books and periodicals. He wanted to continue his studies at the Saint Petersburg Roman Catholic Theological Academy, but the seminary would not grant him a stipend. He then managed to get a stipend from the Archbishop of Mogilev and started his studies at the academy in 1876. In Saint Petersburg, he met and Kazimieras Jaunius who were also active in the Lithuanian National Revival. At the time, several noted linguists and philologists, including Lucian M√ºller, Franz Anton Schiefner, Daniel Chwolson, and , taught at the academy. In 1880, Kriauƒçi≈´nas completed his exams and received a candidate degree in theology, but as a stipend recipient he would have been obligated to work in the Archdiocese of Mogilev. Therefore, Kriauƒçi≈´nas did not accept the final ordination to priesthood and returned to Lithuania. He then studied at the University of Warsaw for a year and received a Latin teacher's diploma. =During the Lithuanian press ban= In November 1881, Kriauƒçi≈´nas became a teacher at the Marijampolƒó Gymnasium. He taught Latin, Lithuanian, German and Greek languages. He was a dedicated teacher using new teaching methods (e.g. rhymes to help memorize grammar rules). He defied the Lithuanian press ban and in Lithuanian lessons used illegal Lithuanian books in the Latin alphabet instead of the legal publications in the government-imposed Cyrillic script. He encouraged his students to translate texts into Lithuanian, collect samples of Lithuanian folklore, learn and study Lithuanian history and culture. His students included future President of Lithuania Kazys Grinius who counted some 80 students of Kriauƒçi≈´nas who later became prominent figures in Lithuanian culture, science, politics, including 30 who became members of the Seimas, government ministers, and university professors. While his lessons inspired patriotic feelings, they lacked structure and consistency. He taught Lithuanian grammar that was based on an eclectic mix of previous works by August Schleicher, , Antanas Baranauskas, Kazimieras Jaunius. His apartment at the Warsaw Hotel was frequently visited by students, various activists, Lithuanian book smugglers. Kriauƒçi≈´nas became a strong supporter of Au≈°ra, the first Lithuanian-language periodical aimed at Lithuanians in the Russian Empire ‚Äì he edited articles, donated funds, distributed physical copies. He later also supported Varpas ‚Äì the first meeting of Varpas collaborators took place at his apartment in June 1888. The Tsarist authorities noticed Lithuanian activities and one by one Lithuanian personnel were forced out of the gymnasium. Kriauƒçi≈´nas' workload was reduced to 10 lessons and his salary was cut to 250 rubles a year. He resigned on 1 September 1887. He found employment as a secretary of the Marijampolƒó Court with a monthly salary of 25 rubles which he shared with Jonas Jablonskis who briefly worked at the court before his appointment to the Mitau Gymnasium. In January 1889, he was transferred as a judge of the peace to where he spent a decade. A position somewhere in the interior of Russia would have been more prestigious and lucrative, but Kriauƒçi≈´nas wanted to remain in his native Suvalkija. In May 1889, he married Sofija Zalevskaitƒó, a widow of the teacher and writer . Kriauƒçi≈´nas collected and published Arminas' works in 1893 (republished in 1907). Kriauƒçi≈´nas was disliked by Tsarist officials and local landowners and was dismissed from his court job in 1899 and returned to Marijampolƒó where he started a private attorney practice. During this time, he devoted his free time to philological studies and developed a scholarly reputation. He delivered two lectures to philological societies in Saint Petersburg in 1897 and 1900 and was a member of the Lithuanian Literary Society. His home was frequently visited by various activists and researchers, including foreigners Jan Niecis≈Çaw Baudouin de Courtenay, J. J. Mikkola and his wife Maila Talvio, , Eduards Volters, , √Öge Meyer Benedictsen. His Lithuanian visitors included Antanas Baranauskas, Jonas Jablonskis, Petras Avi≈æonis, Juozas Tumas-Vai≈ægantas, Gabrielƒó Petkeviƒçaitƒó- Bitƒó Povilas Vi≈°inskis. Kriauƒçi≈´nas was particularly close with Vincas Kudirka. Kriauƒçi≈´nas submitted numerous petitions arguing in favor of lifting the Lithuanian press ban. He knew eight languages (Lithuanian, Polish, Russian, Latin, Greek, Latvian, German, and French) and had a rich philological library. However, he wrote very little and left no extensive bibliography. He collected examples of Lithuanian folklore (about 160 songs collected by him are known), contributed material to the dictionary of Antanas Ju≈°ka, translated ten poems from various languages (works by Gavrila Derzhavin, Victor Hugo, Mikhail Lermontov, Friedrich Schiller, Alexander Pushkin, Maria Konopnicka), and wrote a couple papers and articles on language matters. There are hints that he was working on a Russian‚ÄìPolish‚ÄìLithuanian dictionary ‚Äì no manuscript is known though he was well known to collect words. Even as a judge, he would interrupt court proceedings to take notes on a rarer or more interesting word. Kriauƒçi≈´nas had a manuscript of a Lithuanian‚ÄìPolish dictionary with about 21,000 words from 1820 that we was annotating and correcting. Members of the Lithuanian Science Society in 1912. Kriauƒçi≈´nas sits third from left between ≈Ωemaitƒó and Jonas Basanaviƒçius =After the Russian Revolution of 1905= The Lithuanian press ban was lifted in 1904 and the Russian Revolution of 1905 brought some relaxation of the various Russification policies. Kriauƒçi≈´nas was able to regain his teaching position at the Marijampolƒó Gymnasium in September 1906. He taught Latin and Lithuanian languages and law. As a school librarian, he established a section of Lithuanian publications in the library. At the same time, he also taught at the girls' progymnasium established by the ≈Ωiburys Society and the girls' gymnasium established by Ksenija Breverni≈´tƒó. In 1909, he published a slim 18-page textbook on Latin syntax in Russian. In 1913‚Äì1914, he prepared a program for teaching Lithuanian language in schools and sent it to the Ministry of National Education for approval. In 1909, he joined the newly established Lithuanian Scientific Society and worked on the failed attempt to establish its chapter in Marijampolƒó. At the outbreak of World War I, Kriauƒçi≈´nas retreated to Vilnius where he lived at the premises of the Lithuanian Scientific Society. In August 1915, together with the Marijampolƒó Gymnasium, he evacuated to Yaroslavl where he fell ill in late 1915 and died on 20 January 1916. He was buried in the old cemetery of Yaroslavl. His grave was destroyed when the cemetery was liquidated. A primary school and a public library in Marijampolƒó were named after Kriauƒçi≈´nas in 1935 and 1937. A middle school in Vi≈°tytis was named after Kriauƒçi≈´nas in 1999.

A major component in Hudson's bible classes, was a plan for the young men and women to pray (at noon) every day for the ‚Äúsalvation‚Äù of non-members. Early classes were formed around a strong organization, an enthusiastic social life, and a spiritual focus. The adult class movement flourished for 30 years and then was absorbed into the various Protestant denominations, so that most American communities (at least in the eastern United States) had a Baraca or Philathea Union. Its existence as an independent movement greatly diminished after that. The Philathea group (also called the Philathean Society) was known in the 20th century for its willingness to permit women into its roles of leadership. Particularly after World War 2, the organization diminished with the advent of ‚Äúteen culture‚Äù. By the dawn of the 21st century, the organization had sold its headquarters in Mt. Vernon, VA and transferred its documents to the Gordon‚ÄìConwell Theological Seminary in MassachusettsEncyclopedia of Christianity 2016, p. 201.

Spain have an embassy in Vilnius since December 2013.Ficha de Lituania Oficina de Informaci√≥n Diplom√°tica, Ministeriod e Asuntos Exteriores y Cooperaci√≥n. Secci√≥n: Datos de Representaci√≥n.  Diplomatic relations  Spain re-established diplomatic relations with Lithuania after its independence on September 7, 1991, and accredited ‚Äì until the opening of the resident Embassy in 2004 ‚Äì the Spanish Ambassador in Copenhagen. Bilateral relations have been traditionally good, but of limited intensity. The entry of Lithuania into NATO on March 29, 2004, and in the European Union on May 1, 2004, together with the opening of a Spanish Embassy in March 2004 (that of Lithuania in Spain opened in 1995), allows us to predict the intensification of these links, such as the increasing immigration of Lithuanians to Spain (estimated at around 20,000). Lithuania is of growing interest for Spain due to the strengthening of the Nordic and Baltic dimension of the European Union that led to the extension of it in 2004. In this sense, bilateral cooperation between the two has been reinforced by the observer status of Spain in the Baltic Sea Coast States Council (CBSS), since 2009. Spain and Lithuania share many interests within the European Union, such as the defense of the Principles of Cohesion and Solidarity, the construction of energy infrastructures that prevent the isolation of certain countries, the need for an adequate budget allocation for the Union or the importance it attaches to the control of the external borders of the Union. Lithuania was the only Baltic country that participated in the Expo Zaragoza in 2008 where this country was represented the pavilion \\"the House of Rain\\" visited by the Lithuanian Prime Minister on the day Lithuanian national at the Expo. The interest of this country to be present in international events was already evident with its presence in the Seville Expo in 1992, just one year after regaining its independence.Ficha de Lituania Oficina de Informaci√≥n Diplom√°tica, Ministeriod e Asuntos Exteriores y Cooperaci√≥n. Secci√≥n: Relaciones diplom√°ticas.  Economic relations  Bilateral trade relations between Spain and Lithuania are modest although with a tendency to increase Spanish exports. While in 2011 and 2012 the trade balance was deficient for Spain, since 2013 it is surplus for this country. There is also an increase in absolute figures in both directions. Thus, in 2013, Spanish exports to Lithuania increased to 313.8 million Euros and in 2014 (data until November) they had already risen to 333 million Euros.  Cooperation  Spanish cooperation with Lithuania, being a member country of the European Union, has been and is mainly aimed at institutional strengthening and the formation of human capital. In this sense, Spain has participated in 9 Twinning projects of the European Union: # Strengthening administrative and technical capacities to promote the free movement of goods (AENOR). # Strengthening of the capacity of the Lithuanian administration in the area of Common Fisheries Policy (Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food). # Strengthening the fight against illicit drug demand and reducing supply capacity (Ministry of Interior). # Strengthening of the capacities of the Ministry of Agriculture and related institutions to manage and administer the Community acquis in agriculture (PAC) and rural development (MAP). (Project led by Denmark). # Improvement of Public Services (Complutense University). # Examination and implementation of the National Anti-Corruption Program. Preparation and strategies of the anti-corruption sector and action plans. (Anti-corruption prosecution). # Fight against fraud affecting the financial interests of the European Union. Training in research techniques and procedures. (Phare Multicountry Program ‚Äì led by the CGPJ and the Anti- Corruption Prosecutor's Office). # Establishment of the Lithuanian SIRENE office and its necessary infrastructure (Ministry of Interior). # Strengthening the capacities of the Ministry of Agriculture and related institutions in the field of fisheries. The Spanish Embassy also organized, in coordination with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Lithuania and the Spanish Ministry of Economy and Finance, a Seminar on the Management of Structural and Cohesion Funds, on November 26, 2004 at the premises of the Embassy, addressed to local, regional and institutional Lithuanian administrations. The Spanish Embassy also coordinated, together with the Lithuanian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Economy and Finance, the organization of a seminar on structural funds in order to present the Spanish experience in the use of these that was held in March 2007 in Madrid and Toledo, and in which the Lithuanian Central Agency for CPVA projects participated (competent in the execution of the structural funds granted to this country). NGOs (cooperators and volunteers): several religious volunteers belonging to Opus Dei reside in the country. Several missionary families have also settled in the north of the country. Cooperation in security, humanitarian and peacekeeping fields: the normative basis is the Cooperation Protocol between the Ministry of Defense of the Kingdom of Spain and the Ministry of National Defense of the Republic of Lithuania, signed in Madrid on October 25, 2001. Within the framework of this cooperation in the field of security, the NATO mission for the protection of the Baltic airspace, which from August 1 to December 1 on 2006, assumed Spanish Air Force from the base of Siauliai. Between January and March 2015 Spain collaborates in this same mission with 4 Eurofighter of the Air Force based on the base of Amar√Ø (Estonia).

Coughlin was declared legally dead in 1985, and authorities theorize she was robbed and murdered while on her way to the health spa by someone who disposed of her vehicle, with her body inside, in a stone quarry near the Pennsylvania border.

Henry Girdlestone, M.A. (5 July 1863 ‚Äì 29 June 1926), often referred to as Canon Girdlestone, was head master of St Peter's College from 1894 to 1916 and of Melbourne Grammar School from 1917 to 1919. History Girdlestone was born at Penkridge, Staffordshire, the eldest son of Eliza Jane Girdlestone, n√©e Webb and Henry Girdlestone, a Church of England clergyman. He grew up at the rectory of Bathampton and was educated at Bath College and Magdalen College, Oxford University, where he graduated BA and MA and rowed for Oxford. In 1888 he returned to Bath College as a tutor, and was briefly private tutor to one of the Lords Ashtown. In 1891 he entered holy orders in the Diocese of Bath and Wells and was ordained in 1892. In 1893 Bishop Kennion was in England recruiting teaching staff for St Peter's College, Adelaide, and Girdlestone successfully applied for the position of headmaster. Years later he would joke that Kennion was more impressed with the fact that he had rowed stroke for Oxford in 1885 and 1886 than his other credentials. He commenced his duties in the first term of 1894, and his influence was immediately felt. His love of sport and good sportsmanship was infectious, and he gained additional respect by his own record and athletic ability. Rowing became one of the chief features of the school's sporting calendar. Enrolments, and indeed student numbers, which had stagnated during the reign of his predecessor, P. E. Raynor, immediately improved: when he took charge the College had 170 students; a year later there were 202; in succeeding years 275, 310, 347 . . . and in 1916 when he retired there were 450. Nor did he neglect the school's traditions of discipline, patriotism, religious observance and scholastic achievement; that and his forthright manner won the boys' respect and that of their parents. Girdlestone was appointed honorary canon of St Peter's Cathedral in 1912 by Bishop Thomas. He and his wife, with Archdeacon Hornabrook, put much effort and energy into the founding and running of St. Peter's College Mission, a charitable outreach at St. Mary Magdalene's Church, Moore Street off Angas Street. He was a member of the University of Adelaide council from 1901 and for most of his time in Adelaide actively involved with the Adelaide Rowing Club and its president 1913‚Äì15. He resigned as headmaster in 1916, saying that the job should be that of a younger man (large of frame, he had continually to fight a tendency to overweight), and retired to his home in Balhannah, T. Ainslie Caterer filling the vacancy. He consented however, to take charge in 1917 of Melbourne Grammar School, whose headmaster, Richard Penrose \\"Lofty\\" Franklin (November 1884 ‚Äì 12 October 1942) had volunteered for war service, and relinquished the position on the return of Lieut. Franklin in 1919. He retired with his family to England in April 1920 by the liner SS Osterley, and lived at \\"Hillcote\\" Lansdown, near Bath, where he died, and was buried at Lansdown cemetery. Family Girdlestone married Helen Joanna Crawford (died November 1946) on 17 September 1900. Helen was a daughter of W. Crawford, Adelaide manager of the Union Bank.

The Code repeals and replaces the Payment of Wages Act, 1936, the Minimum Wages Act, 1948, the Payment of Bonus Act, 1965, and the Equal Remuneration Act, 1976. Background The Narendra Modi administration began considering a plan in 2015 to consolidate India's 44 labour laws into four codes in order to rationalize labour laws and improve ease of doing business. Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman stated in her 2019 Union Budget speech, \\"This will ensure that process of registration and filing of returns will get standardised and streamlined. With various labour related definitions getting standardised, it is expected that there shall be less dispute.\\" The Code on Wages is the first of the proposed codes. The other three are the Occupational Safety, Health and Working Conditions Code, the Industrial Relations Code, and the Code on Social Security. Legislative history The Code on Wages Bill was introduced in the Lok Sabha on 10 August 2017 by the Minister of State for Labour and Employment (Independent Charge), Santosh Gangwar. The bill was referred to a Parliamentary Standing Committee on 21 August 2017. The Committee submitted its report on 18 December 2018. The committee made 24 recommendations, of which 17 were incorporated into the bill. The bill lapsed following the dissolution of the 16th Lok Sabha ahead of the 2019 general elections. The Code on Wages Bill, 2019 was re-introduced in the House on 23 July 2019. Moving the bill for consideration, Gangwar stated that the government had held consultations with trade unions, employers and State governments, and held tripartite consultations on 10 March 2015 and 13 April 2015. He also stated that a draft of the bill was made available on the Ministry of Labour and Employment's website and suggestions from the general public were taken into account. Gangwar added that existing labour laws only governed payment of wages for about 40% of the labour force and the Code on Wages would extend coverage to the entire labour force irrespective of sector or wage ceiling. He noted that provisions on timely payment of wages would bring relief to workers in the unorganized sector of the economy. The bill was passed by the Lok Sabha on 30 July 2019. The bill was passed by the Rajya Sabha on 2 August 2019. The bill received assent from President Ram Nath Kovind on 8 August, and was notified in The Gazette of India on the same date. The Union Ministry of Labour issued draft rules under section 67 of the Act on 7 July 2020 in the Gazette. The draft rules will remain open for public feedback for 45 days and is expected to come into force in September 2020.

Biography He was the son of a tax collector from Bourges. He initially studied at the Coll√®ge Royal and received his first lessons in drawing from Henri-Joseph Boichard (1783-1850). In 1826, he enrolled at the √âcole nationale sup√©rieure des Beaux-Arts, on the recommendation Louis Hersent, whose student he became. Later, he studied with Antoine-Jean Gros and, in 1832, with Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres. He entered the competition for the Prix de Rome six times between 1828 and 1833, when he finally won the prize for his rendering of Moses and the serpent of brass. He lived at the Villa M√©dicis between 1834 and 1838, sending home paintings to be exhibited at the Salon on a regular basis. He held numerous showings there from 1831 until his untimely death. In 1833, his \\"Body of Charles the Bold\\" received official recognition from the Acad√©mie des Beaux-Arts and his final known work, featuring John the Baptist preaching, was acquired by the French government for 4000 Francs and installed at the Mus√©e du Berry. In 1838, he contracted an unspecified \\"chest disease\\" that required him to leave Rome. Nevertheless, upon returning home he accepted several commissions from the galleries at Versailles: a Charlemagne crossing the Alps brought him 600 Francs that year, and a depiction of the lifting of the Siege of Salerno (1016) provided 1500 Francs in 1839 from King Louis-Philippe. The painting was to be placed in the Hall of the Crusades; a new museum being planned by the King. His health became increasingly fragile during this time and he died in 1840, aged only thirty-three.

She is the Chancellor Rose and Ray Wolfe Professor of Holocaust Studies at the University of Toronto, the only endowed chair in Canada in Holocaust history. Bergen is also a member of the Academic Advisory Committee of the Center for Advanced Holocaust Studies at the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum. She was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Canada in 2018. Early life and education Bergen is of German and Ukrainian descent and was raised a Mennonite in Saskatchewan. While her parents fled Ukraine in the early 1920s, Bergen had family in Europe who witnessed the Holocaust. After earning her Bachelor of Arts from the University of Saskatchewan, Bergen was educated at the University of Alberta and University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. While writing her PhD dissertation in North Carolina, Bergen studied under the direction of Gerhard Weinberg, a professor with a focus on World War II. Career Bergen began her academic career at the University of Vermont in 1991. While teaching there, Bergen was also a visiting instructor at the Universities of Warsaw, Tuzla, and Pristina. In 1996, Bergen was hired by the University of Notre Dame in their history department. She specialized in 20th century German history, with an emphasis on the Nazi era and the Holocaust, and European women's history. During this time, Bergen published Twisted cross: the German Christian movement in the Third Reich which focused on the Protestant Church's response to Nazism. A year later, in 1997, Bergen held a Fellowship for Archival Research at the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum. In 1999, Bergen was a fellow at the Institute on the Holocaust and Jewish Civilization at Northwestern University. Bergen would later note that her interest in Holocaust studies grew from her personal connection to Mennonite communities. While keeping a strong focus on the stories of Jews during the Holocaust, Bergen was also interested in the oft-forgotten Holocaust victim groups such as the disabled, the Roma, Soviet prisoners of war, and Polish civilians. After returning to Notre Dame, Bergen published War and Genocide: A Concise History of the Holocaust in 2003. This book analyzed the varying experiences of violence of different groups of perpetrators, victims, and other participants during the Holocaust. She later edited a book on military chaplains, published by University of Notre Dame Press. In 2006, before taking a leave of absence, Bergen was elected Chair of the University Committee on Women Faculty and Students. In 2007, Bergen was named a full professor at the University of Toronto. She also replaced Michael Marrus as the Chancellor Rose and Ray Wolfe Professor of Holocaust Studies at the University of Toronto. This is the only endowed chair in Canada in Holocaust history. The following year, she was awarded the Graduate History Society Distinguished Service Award. After the 2009‚Äì10 academic year, Bergen was elected a senior fellow at Massey College, Toronto. In 2012, Bergen was awarded U of T's Ludwik and Estelle Jus Memorial Human Rights Prize and named a member of the Academic Advisory Committee of the Center for Advanced Holocaust Studies at the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum. While assuming this role, she was also selected by Jason Kenney as an Advisory Council Members for the International Task Force on Holocaust Education, Remembrance and Research. Two years later, in 2014, Bergen was named to the National Holocaust Monument design team. This monument in Ottawa was recognized with the 2018 American Institute of Architects New York Design Award. In 2015, Bergen was selected as a final juror for the Laura Shannon Prize. Two years later, Bergen collaborated with photographer Edward Burtynsky to produce Chai, a book featuring images from various Holocaust sites in Germany, Austria, the Czech Republic, Poland, Lithuania, and Hungary. Following this, Bergen was one of eleven U of T professors elected to the Royal Society of Canada and sat on U of T's 2018‚Äì19 Policy Committee.

He was unsuccessful as a cloth merchant in Scotland and as a sugar plantation manager in Demerara, Guianas. He became a Hudson's Bay Company clerk in Nanaimo, British Columbia and then a judge in the Colony of Vancouver Island. In 1853, Cameron became the first Chief Justice of Vancouver Island, a position which he held until 1858. He served as a justice until his retirement in 1865.  Judicial career  In the years when the Hudsons Bay Company continued to have exclusive licence to trade in what is now British Columbia, Governor James Douglas had appointed four magistrates to deal with legal disputes but he found them to be \\"ignorant and unreliable\\". As Douglas was functioning as sheriff and judge in addition to his other responsibilities, he recognized the need to establish a court and appoint a judge. His wife's brother, an HBC employee arrived from Demerara in July 1853 to take up duties as a clerk in the company operations in Nanaimo, British Columbia. Cameron had no legal training. Douglas appointed Cameron a Judge of the newly created Supreme Court of Civil Justice on Dec 2, 1853. Although there were complaints to London about the appointment from local citizens, the appointment was confirmed by the colonial office. Cameron became the first Chief Justice in the colony and the first chief justice in any part of what later became to the province of British Columbia. He continued as Chief Justice until 1858, and remained on the bench bench until October 11, 1865. His salary was 100 pounds per year. The colony was not permitted to pay salaries from land sales and the only other revenue of colony at the time came from licensing liquor dealers. Those revenues paid his salary. On February 28, 1856 at direction of London, Douglas established an elected legislative assembly for the Colony of Vancouver Island which began with 7 representatives: John Muir, Dr. J. S. Helmcken, Thomas J Skinner, J. D Pemberton, Dr John F. Kennedy, James Yates, E.E. Langford. The first legislative assembly west of the Great Lakes first met August 12. 1856. Cameron examined their credentials and swore them in. In November 1858 Cameron, as Chief Justice of Vancouver Island, attended with Matthew Baillie Begbie, just arrived as judge elect of the new colony of British Columbia, and Governor Douglas at Fort Langley. On November 19 Douglas swore Begbie in followed by Begbie reading Her Majesty's commission appointing Douglas Governor of the Colony of British Columbia in addition to his continuing role as Governor of Vancouver Island. At the same time the HBC licence for exclusive trade was revoked. In planning a court system for Colony of British Columbia (1858‚Äì1866), Begbie used the system Cameron had developed for the Colony of Vancouver Island as a model. When the colonies merged, in 1858 it was decided that officials should have professional training. Begbie took over the role of chief justice for both former colonies. Cameron continued as a justice until he resigned October 11, 1865.  Geographic names  Cameron Lake is named after David Cameron. Edith Point in Campbell Bay on Mayne Island is named after Cameron's daughter.

It won the National Film Award for Best Feature Film in Tamil, the only Tamil film to win at the 66th National Film Awards. It was released in Indian theatres on 21 February 2020.  Plot  Karuppasamy, a widowed night watchman, lives with his sister and three nephews ‚Äì Veera, Mani and Murugan ‚Äì at a town in Tamil Nadu. One morning after returning from his shift, he breaks his hip in an accident. While his nephews want him to be treated in town, his son Senthil takes him to his ancestral village, to be healed by a traditional healer. Eight days later, Karuppasamy dies. His mysterious death gets Veera, an activist, suspicious.  Cast  * R. Raju as Karuppasamy * Jayalakshmi as Menmozhi, Karuppasamy's sister * SuPa Muthukumar as Senthil * Sugumar Shanmugam as Veera  Production  After making her debut feature film, Gangoobai, Priya Krishnaswamy chanced upon news items regarding the practice of Thalaikoothal in online news portals. Upon further research, she realised that Thalaikoothal, a phenomenon she had never heard of before, was, in fact, an ongoing cultural practice which enjoyed social sanction in wide swathes of rural Tamil Nadu. Concerned with the burgeoning problem of an ageing population in India, and a complete lack of social and medical infrastructure to cater to the elderly, she wrote the script of Baaram in two weeks in mid-2016, and decided to produce the film herself, under her banner, Reckless Roses, in collaboration with Ardra Swaroop. Accordingly, they approached the Department of Performing Arts, Pondicherry University, where Priya conducted acting workshops, and succeeded in sourcing the main cast. Additional roles, numbering more than 80, were played by local non-actors. The film was shot in a realistic style akin to the Dogme school of cinema, with long takes, handheld shots and sync sound. No dialogue dubbing was done. It was shot in Pondicherry and Tirunelveli in 18 days in January 2017.  Festivals and awards  Baaram premiered in November 2018 in the Indian Panorama section of the 49th International Film Festival of India (IFFI), Goa. It was also one of two Indian films nominated for the ICFT UNESCO Gandhi Medal at the IFFI, Goa, 2018. The ICFT UNESCO Gandhi Medal is an international competition section of IFFI that is evaluated by a jury in Paris. Baaram later won the National Film Award for Best Feature Film in Tamil, the only Tamil film to win at the 66th National Film Awards. It was released in Indian theatres on 21 February 2020.  Critical reception  Cinestaan gave the film 4 out of 5 stars at the 49th IFFI, saying, \\"Baaram is a beautifully crafted social film which will make you question your own actions and rethink your stand on the grave subject of mercy killing.\\" M. Suganth of The Times of India rated it 3 out 5, saying, \\"The arthouse approach is both a plus and a minus\\" but criticised the characters as seeming \\"painted in black and white\\", saying, \\"This approach makes them mere placeholders onto which the director can hang her plot. These result in a film that makes you think, but fails to make you feel.\\"Behindwoods rated 3 out of 5 stars stating \\"Baaram is a hard-hitting film on a social issue that is rarely spoken about. Try not to miss\\".The New Indian Express rated 3 out of 5 stars stating \\"However, Baaram doesn‚Äôt leave you devastated. It only tries to put a mirror in front of society demanding a self-assessment\\".The Hindu stated \\"Despite winning the National Film Award for Best Feature Film in Tamil, by the time it winds down, inefficient scripting comes to the fore in this effort\\".The Indian Express rated 3.5 out of 5 stars stating \\"Baaram is a necessary film that underlines the age-old heinous tradition, Thalaikoothal\\".Film Companion stated \\"The director keeps her distance. Like a diligent reporter, she is interested in (1) how thalaikoothal is organised, and (2) what you‚Äôd do if you knew someone was killed in this manner\\".Sify rated 2.5 out of 5 stars stating \\"Docu-drama\\".
