Greystanes House, which was the main building, and, Gowrie House, which was the private patients' facility, are both Grade B listed buildings. History The hospital in 1897 Liff's minister in the 1790s noted that > \\"Many persons from Dundee, of delicate and sickly constitutions, have found > their health greatly improved by a few months residence here in > summer...chill wind and damp vapours from the east' are felt less here than > in places nearer the mouth of the river\\". Accordingly a facility, designed by William Clark and built in Albert Street in Dundee to take advantage of the local climate, opened as the Dundee Lunatic Asylum in April 1820. It became the Dundee Royal Lunatic Asylum in 1875. By the mid-1870s the directors of the asylum were looking for a new and larger site outside the city and chose the 95 acres of Westgreen Farm, east of Liff and west of Camperdown. The laying of the foundation stone on 17 September 1879 was marked by an elaborate Masonic ceremony, involving a large procession of Freemasons and city dignitaries from Dundee. The new building, designed by the architects Edward and Robertson in the Scottish baronial style with a 600-foot frontage and a tower at each end, opened in October 1882. By 1897 there were in total 458 patients. In January 1899 a new private patients' facility, designed to accommodate about 60 private patients, was erected to the south of the main building and placed under separate management, as the Royal Asylum. The main facility became the Dundee District Asylum in 1903 and at its peak housed 1,200 patients and operated the 247-acre Gourdie Farm to provide work for patients and generate fresh produce and milk. The main facility amalgamated with the private patients' facility, to form the Dundee Royal Mental Hospital in 1959. It went on to become the Royal Dundee Liff Hospital in 1963. After the introduction of Care in the Community in the early 1980s, the hospital went into a period of decline and, once services had transferred to the Carseview Centre, a modern mental health facility established in the grounds of Ninewells Hospital, the Royal Dundee Liff Hospital closed in December 2001. The former main facility, which is now known as Greystanes House, and the former private patients' facility, which is now known as Gowrie House, were subsequently converted into apartments as part of a larger development known as West Green Park. Two large murals depicting beach scenes by Alberto Morrocco are on the walls of the former dining room in the main building, not now normally accessible to the public. Morrocco, Head of the School of Painting at Duncan of Jordanstone College of Art and Design in Dundee, undertook them in the early 1960s at the request of Professor (later Sir) Ivor Batchelor, Physician Superintendent of Dundee Royal Mental Hospital and holder of the first Chair in Psychiatry at the University of Dundee. An exhibition entitled 'Life at Liff: the mental health of Dundee' was held in the McManus Galleries, Dundee from 5 April to 16 June 2002.

The film, which was first shown on Arte on 5 March 2019,TV 5 monde (Retrieved 23 April 2019). deals with sexualised violence by clerics against nuns and the attempts of the Catholic Church to cover up these acts.  Synopsis  The film shows that nuns all over the world have been and are sexually abused by clerics hierarchically above them. The case of Marie- Dominique Philippe, who raped nuns for decades without the church intervening, plays a central role. The systematic rapes even extend to structures in which religious sisters such as sex slaves were sold to priests. In 2018, the Vatican acknowledged that the reports were well-founded and that the problem persisted. The filmmakers tried to arrange a meeting of two protagonists of the film with Pope Francis. Since the Vatican only offered a private audience without witnesses, the women concerned rejected this meeting.  Backgrounds  The film is based on two years of research. Doris Wagner, one of the (former) nuns affected to have her say in the film, had already previously drawn attention to the problem of sexualised violence against nuns, for example in her autobiographical book ‚ÄúNicht mehr ich - die wahre Geschichte einer jungen Ordensfrau‚Äù or with an article in the Catholic cultural magazine Stimmen der Zeit. She could also be seen in the film #Female Pleasure. In 2019 her second book Spiritual Abuse in the Catholic Church was published. In the 1990s, several nuns had already drawn attention to the widespread sexual abuse in African monasteries, among them Maura O'Donohue, who in 1994 sent a report to Rome on cases in 23 countries. This report was only published in 2001 by the National Catholic Reporter. Only then did a statement from Rome confirm these cases, but despite the many documented cases from different countries, the problem was relativized as \\"within a limited geographical area\\".Chris Hedges, Documents Allege Abuse of Nuns by Priests. The New York Times from 21 March 2001. (Retrieved 23 April 2019). Later that year, the then Pope John Paul II asked for an apology to the victims in a message.

Cana being a personal name meaning 'wolf cub', and one of the tribes earliest descendants.\\"The McCann Surname\\", Ancestry.com. A vassal sept of the Ui Neilll, the tribe originally inhabited the lands of Clancann, and also became Lords of Clanbrasil after they dispossessed the O'Garvey's of their land around the time of Richard de Clare's Anglo-Norman invasion of Ireland.https://www.houseofnames.com/mcgann-family-crest Their territory lay to the south of Lough Neagh in modern-day County Armagh and County Tyrone, flanked by the River Bann and River Blackwater. They were a branch of the Cenel Eoghain, the large group of Northern U√≠ N√©ill septs claiming descent from King E√≥gan mac N√©ill, the son of the High King Niall of the Nine Hostages. The first written record of the family name is shown to be that of Amhlaoibh Mac Cana, Lord of Clanbrasil and is mentioned in the Annals of the Four Masters during the reign of Tairrdelbach Ua Conchobair. He was praised for his chivalry, his vigour, and his strong drink he made from apples in his orchard. The clan are also stated as having had a castle at Portadown in County Armagh. The last recorded Chief of the name, Donall MaCanna, was still known as Lord of Clanbrasil as late as 1598, from when the Mac Cana, Hugh O'Neill, Earl of Tyrone, and an alliance of other clans fought the Nine Years' War against the Tudor Conquest of Ireland. O'Neill succeeded for 9 years, but he was finally defeated at the Battle of Kinsale in 1602 and fled to Spain during the Flight of the Earls in 1607. The following year when James I of England began the Plantation of Ulster, most of O'Neill's supporters were dispossessed of their homelands. This would seem to include the Mac Cana clan (later anglicized to McCann) and in 1610 as part of the plans of the plantation, the lands of Portadown were granted to English Protestant settlers. William Powell of Castlespark, Staffordshire, received the great proportion of Ballyworran, which spanned the southern extremities of Clanbrassil and Clancann. John Brownlowe from Nottingham received the middle proportion of Doughcorron, which corresponded to the northern part of the ancient district of Clanbrassil. John Heron received the small proportions of Aghivillan and Broughes, which both formed one manor. (Aghivillan lay in Clancann, whilst the majority of Broughes also lies in Clancann, with the rest in Oneilland). William Stanhowe of Norwich, Norfolk, received the middle proportion of Kannagolah. Kannagolah spanned nearly the whole length of the ancient Irish district of Clancann from north to south, and included the possible last residence of the districts McCann chiefs. The Mac Cana were active in the Irish Rebellion of 1641, and fought alongside their chieftain Felim O'Neill of Kinard and the Irish Confederates through the Irish Confederate Wars (also called the Eleven Years' War) during the Wars of the Three Kingdoms. They first captured the fort of Charlemont, which led to massacres of many Scottish and English Protestant settlers by the Gaelic Catholic soldiers, many who had been displaced during the Plantation of Ulster. In November 1641 in particular, an army led by Toole McCann, a notorious rebel, captured the settlement of Portadown, the ancestral lands of the Mac Cana clan which led to the Portadown Massacre, the biggest individual massacre of Protestants throughout the whole of the uprising. Following success in Ulster, the Irish Confederates then marched on Dublin, gaining a victory in the Battle of Julianstown but taking a loss at the Siege of Drogheda. After the Siege of Drogheda, Cromwell ordered most of the Irish military prisoners who surrendered to be shipped to Barbados and other British colonies to work as indentured servants. During the following decade the Irish Catholic Federation was formed. The Ulster Army spent the next six years fighting the Scottish Covenanter Army that had landed in Ulster and fought in the army's victory at the Battle of Benburb in 1646. Following defeat at the Battle of Scarrifholis by the New Model Army, Felim O'Neill was eventually captured and executed in 1653 by British Parliamentary forces during the Cromwellian Conquest of Ireland, and his remaining supporters were imposed with penalties including death, transportation, indentured servitude and land confiscation under the Act for the Settlement of Ireland 1652. After Cromwell's order to send the Irish ‚ÄúTo hell or to Connaught‚Äù, the remaining leaders of the Irish Confederate army lost two-thirds of their estates. The Commissioners in Ireland had power to grant them other poorer lands in Connaught or Clare in proportion of value and were authorised \\"to transplant such persons from the respective places of their usual habitation or residence, into other such places within that nation, as shall be judge most consistent with public safety.\\" This would seem to be the McGann sept of the name, which is known to be an anglicised Connaught variant of 'Mac Cana' and a name commonly found in Roscommon. It is also known many McGanns later returned to Ulster.https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Families_of_County_Galway_Ireland.html?id=6g5WXZVxbIoC Due to anglicization and Ulster migration the original name now holds various forms such as McCann, McGann, MacCana, MacCann, MacCan, Maccan (this part of the Maccans had connections with many European noble and royal families, such as the Maccan of Villanova, Maccan de Gueldre and Maccani), and became Canny and Canney upon Ulster migration to the south (Leinster and Munster). The title of Lord of Clanbrasil is still held by the family of McCann in the area of County Louth.https://www.surnamedb.com/Surname/McGann The Mac Cana line features in John O'Hart's 19th century pseudo-historical book, Irish pedigrees. In this book, the Mac Cana line along with other surname lines are taken right back to Adam and Eve.  The House of Maccan  From Ireland, a branch of the family moved to France in the 11th century with the surname Maccan, around the same time as the Norman invasion of Ireland. In the reign of Philip IV of France, of the Capet dynasty. The Maccan Family, who for some time had held important positions within the court such as Vicars, General leaders, Generals of the Royal army and Administrators of Justice in the name of The King; were assigned the Marquis title. Then in the first half of the 14th century, we‚Äôre granted the title of Counts and Dukes of Guelders (de Gueldre) by the Wassenbergs, through marriage and testamentary bequest.https://almanachdegotha.altervista.org/the-house-of-maccan/ Over the years, a branch of the family migrated from France to Italy. In this period, the family was also known as Maccani (Italianization of the surname). They also changed the original family coat of arms, becoming a talking coat of arms, the new crest had a symbol of a dog, which then became two dogs facing each other, in fact ‚ÄòCan‚Äô and ‚ÄòCani‚Äô translates to ‚Äòdog‚Äô and ‚Äòdogs‚Äô in Italian. In the first half of the 17th century, from Nobles of Trento they became Counts of Tres by concession of Ferdinand Charles, Archduke of Austria and subsequently Marquis. There is evidence of the existence of some members of the Maccan family; Armigers, Vicars, General administrators of local noble goods, judges, lawyers and notaries; in the 14th century.https://noblesseobligeitalia.blogspot.com/2019/01/famiglia-maccan- maccan-di-gheldria-poi.html Although was assumed that they carried out these duties before, the first document attesting the presence of a Maccan (Maccani) as Vicar General is dated in the 1600s, with Luca Maccan von Clers (Vicar general of Prince Bishop Carlo Emanuele Madruzzo and of the Diocese of Trentino), while as a notary is from 1652 with Giovanni Maccan von Tres (Ioannes Maccanus de Tresio utraque auctoritate notarius ).

The group includes Rhiannon Giddens, Amythyst Kiah, Leyla McCalla, and Allison Russell. The album was released on the Smithsonian Folkways label in early 2019. Songs of Our Native Daughters addresses American historical issues that have influenced the identity of black women, including slavery, racism, and sexism. The album features 13 songs, 11 of them written by the group's members. It also includes a cover of a 1970s Bob Marley classic and a song that draws its lyrics from two poems. The album was co-produced by Giddens, who conceived the project, and Dirk Powell, who holds four Grammy Awards and has worked with Giddens on previous albums. It was recorded in 10 days at Powell's studio in a pre-Civil War building outside Lafayette, Louisiana. Themes The idea for Our Native Daughters was conceived by Giddens whose previous album, Freedom Highway, dealt with slavery and the Civil Rights Era. The project was inspired by two experiences. The first was a visit she made with her seven-year-old daughter to the Smithsonian's National Museum of African American History and Culture in Washington, D.C. During a private tour, she encountered a quote by an 18th century poet that she felt needed to be in a song: Her second experience was a screening of Nate Parker's controversial 2016 film Birth of a Nation. In the album's liner notes, Giddens writes that she was upset by the scene in the film where an enslaved woman is raped by the plantation owner's friend. What particularly outraged Giddens was that the camera was on the face of the woman's husband and not on her suffering. Giddens' original intent was to make art from historical words and observations about slavery. She also wanted to focus on the banjo and its role in 19th century black minstrel music. After some reflection, as well as conversations with Dirk Powell, she decided to do a collaborative project that would include other black female artists. The concept for the album began to change during the early recording sessions as Russell, Kiah and McCalla suggested a range of ideas for new songs centering on the legacies that helped shape the present day identity of black women. With that, Giddens broadened the theme to emphasize stories of \\"struggle, resistance and hope\\". The result is a collection of songs that address issues ranging from slavery and colonialism to racism and sexism. More than half of the album's songs explore aspects of slavery and its aftermath. Some of these as well as others deal with the specific experiences of black women. Meanwhile, Giddens' initial concept of celebrating black minstrel music was not abandoned entirely. Two of her four contributions focus on the historical role of the banjo as the first \\"truly American\\" instrument. As she points out in the liner notes, the instrument was first used exclusively by black musicians, but in the latter part of the 1800s, it became identified with white males who performed minstrel music in blackface, a form of entertainment that was highly popular at the time. Group members The members of Our Native Daughters were brought together by Giddens, who selected the group's name in reference to James Baldwin's 1955 book Notes of a Native Son. Following are profiles of the group's members: Rhiannon Giddens, a vocalist and banjo player, is a founding member of the Grammy Award-winning group Carolina Chocolate Drops. She was nominated for a Grammy in 2017 for her second solo studio album Freedom Highway, which was produced by Powell. Among other honors, she was awarded a MacArthur Fellowship \\"genius grant\\" in 2017 for her contributions to folk and country music as an African American. Amythyst Kiah She was born in Chattanooga and currently lives in Johnson City. Kiah is a graduate of East Tennessee State University, where she completed the Bluegrass, Old Time, and Country Music Studies program. She plays guitar and banjo. Leyla McCalla, who is of Haitian descent, was born in New York City. After studying classical music briefly at New York University, she relocated to New Orleans, where she was recruited to join the Carolina Chocolate Drops while performing as a street musician. She has since recorded three solo albums. Her most recent release, Capitalist Blues, reached number 14 on Billboard's Jazz Albums chart in early 2019. McCalla's primary instrument is the cello, though she also plays banjo and guitar. Allison Russell was born in Montreal, Quebec, Canada and currently resides in Nashville, Tennessee. A multi-instrumentalist, she is a founding member of two roots groups. In 2003, Russell joined with Trish Klein of Be Good Tanyas to form Po' Girl in Canada, which recorded six CDs, the last in 2010. In 2012 she joined with her now- husband JT Nero to form the group Birds of Chicago in the U.S., releasing four albums and an EP (as of 2018). Russell plays guitar, banjo, ukelele, and clarinet. Another Canadian, singer-songwriter Kaia Kater, was also invited to participate in Our Native Daughters but was unable to because of scheduling commitments.

Among the group's initiatives are the opening of an art gallery showcasing Haredi artists in a Tel Aviv flea market, and projects in theatre, film, media, and plastics and visual arts. Yankelevich has defended the Haredi population against the Israel Women's Network and other liberal feminist groups that vilify it for its enactment of gender separation in institutes of higher learning and at public events. Political career In 2019, Yankelevich was chosen by Benny Gantz to be a member of his Israel Resilience Party, which was part of the Blue and White political alliance for the April 2019 Israeli legislative election. She was placed #23 on the faction's list. Her appointment was seen as an attempt by Gantz to present the party's political orientation as centrist, rather than left, although her presence was not expected to pull in Haredi votes. With the Blue and White alliance gaining 35 seats in the election, Yankelevich became a Member of the Knesset. In the national unity government of the thirty-fifth government of Israel, Gantz appointed Yankelevich to serve as Minister of Diaspora Affairs, thus becoming the first-ever Haredi woman cabinet minister. Personal life Yankelevich is a Haredi Jew. She and her husband, Yaron, have five children, and reside in Beit Shemesh. She speaks Hebrew, English, and Russian.

His Highness Sir Sultan Mohamed Shah, the Aga Khan, often referred to as the Haji Bibi Case, was a 1908 court case in the Bombay High Court heard by Justice Russell. The case was fundamentally a dispute over the inheritance of the estate of Hasan Ali Shah, a Persian nobleman with the title Aga Khan I and the hereditary leader (46th Imam) of the Nizari Ismailis. A number of the properties and other monetary assets had been passed down to Aqa Ali Shah, Aga Khan II and then to his grandson, Sir Sultan Muhammad Shah, Aga Khan III. The plaintiffs included Haji Bibi who was a widowed granddaughter of Aga Khan I and a few other members of the family that all claimed rights to the wealth. The decision is notable as it confirmed the Aga Khan III's exclusive rights to the assets of his grandfather and to the continued religious offerings by his followers, including some Khojas, as the 48th Imam of the Nizaris. As part of the adjudication, the British judge extensively examined the religious identity of the Khoja community in India. The plaintiffs argued that the family was IthnƒÅ‚Äòashari (Twelver), and under the corresponding Muhammadan customs of inheritance, they were obligated to shares. However, after considering the religious customs of the Khojas including the ginans, Justice Russell concluded that the community was Shia Imami Ismaili Muslims, now known as Nizari Ismailis. Furthering the 1866 decision in the Aga Khan case, this tradition was differentiated from both Sunnis and IthnƒÅ‚Äòasharis.Ali S. Asani, ‚ÄùFrom Satpanthi to Ismaili Muslim: The Articulation of Ismaili Khoja Identity in South Asia,\\" in Modern History of the Ismailis, ed. Farhad Daftary (London, New York: IB Tauris in association with the Institute of Ismaili studies, 2010), 95-128.  Historical background  Before the arrival of the British in the Indian subcontinent, the Khojas had a pluralistic character and used multilingual discourses to address their faith. The community had been converted by a number of Nizari Ismaili pirs and sayyids since the 11th century, of whom Pir Sadruddin and his son Pir Hasan Kabiruddin are often seen as the most influential and successful missionaries. However, the collection of their teachings was referred to as satpanth, ‚Äòthe true path,‚Äô and the group did not self-identify as Ismaili, Muslim, or even Hindu. Rather, traditions were adopted from all three, and the Khjoas expressed their beliefs in terms of concepts and formulations. For example, the satpanth tradition venerated \`A True Guide\` that lived in the West that could have been interpreted as either the Nizari Imams or the 10th incarnation of Vishnu. This unique set of beliefs not only baffled outsiders such as the British legislature, but it also led to internal confusion within the community. Since the Alamut period, the Nizari Imams had been settled within Persia. Although they often received religious offerings from their followers in the Indian subcontinent, there was little done to label the satpanth as Ismailis / Nizaris or unify the community under the Imam's authority. Aga Khan I was similarly born in Persia, but due to conflict with the ruling Qajar government, was forced to flee in 1841. He eventually settled in Bombay in 1848 where he proceeded to assert his authority on all sorts of issues related to the large Khoja population, including controlling the communally owned property.Daniel Beben, \\"Introduction\\" in The First Aga Khan: Memoirs of the 46th Ismaili Imam, 1-60. While a number of the Khojas accepted the Aga Khan I as their new leader, a number of dissenters challenged his authority in what is now known as the Aga Khan case of 1866. The decision by Sir Joseph Arnould concluded that the Khoja were Shia Muslim and not Sunni, with the hereditary line leading to Aga Khan I as their rightful leaders. It is also important to note that the Aga Khan I's move to India did not just involve one individual. Rather, the movement involved thousands of persons affiliated with his institution, including extended family, servants, scribes, and private military forces. Upon moving, he used his property, allowances from the government of Rs 3000, and continued religious dues from the Khoja community to establish a presence in Bombay through a number of properties and care for his extended family. This would become one of the central issues in the Haji Bibi case. Did the Aga Khan care for his extended family out of his personal goodwill or out of some other obligation?  Arguments and evidence  Justice Russell's decision in The Bombay Law Reporter notes that as many as 128 claims were brought up by the prosecution. Generally, these issues fell under 4 umbrellas. Below we analyze both the plaintiffs and defendants arguments: = 1. Intention of religious offerings = * The plaintiff contended that the religious offerings made by the Khoja community were intended to be shared with the extended family of the current Imam. She cites various ginans which say that payments should be made to the ‚ÄòAal Ali‚Äô or ‚ÄòAulad Ali‚Äô which was interpreted to mean the progeny of the Ali and Imams. Various Quranic verses also support payments to the family. The evidence for this argument was that the family of the Aga Khan often collected the religious offerings or partook in various ceremonies where they received gifts. * However, to counter this point the defense brought in Vazir Cassum Ismail, who argued that those expressions specifically referred to the descent of Ali, ‚Äúwho is on the gadi of the Imam‚Äù. Also, the Quranic verses referred only to spoils of war and not to the Khoja religious offerings. A number of other witnesses also noted that they did not know of the Aga Khan's family and sent offerings for him to use however he saw fit. = 2. Inheritance and religion of the Khojas = * Although the Aga Khan case concluded that the Khojas were Shia, it was still unclear what system of beliefs that they follow. Haji Bibi and her counsel argued that the Imams and the Khoja had always been Ithna‚Äôashari (Twelvers). Then, by the Muhammadan Law of Inheritance, the extended family was to inherit shares of the late Aga Khan I's assets. As evidence, Haji Bibi cited that they had been able to live rent-free in some house of the family estate as proof of their status heirs or heiresses. * To counter this point, the defense pointed to the Du‚Äôa (daily ritual prayer) of the Khoja community which lists the hereditary successorship through Imam Ismail all the way to Sir Sultan Muhammad Shah, Aga Khan III. Furthermore, through an analysis of the ginans of Pir Sadruddin and Kabirudin as well as the customary practices of the Khoja, Justice Russell concluded the community was clearly Shia Imami Ismaili, and they follow the Aga Khan as their Imam. = 3. Release of the estate = * The executor of the estate of Aga Khan I and Aga Khan II, named Shamsudin, was the administrator of the estate of both Jungi Shah and Sultan Muhammad Shah. The plaintiff posited that release of the estate was a sham transaction brought about by collusion or fraud on the part by the defendant. * In contrast, the defense argued that the Aga Khan III had been within his rights during the release of the estates, and in fact, he had been more than generous to his extended family. The evidence included an analysis of legal documents and events leading to the inheritance. = 4. Murder of Hassan Shah and Jungi Shah = * The plaintiff argued that the murders both occurred after a rise of disputes within the family and points to Sir Sultan Muhammad Shah's unwillingness to investigate. * However, the Aga Khan was not in town at the time of either murder and was in both cases not thought to be involved until this inheritance court case. For example, there had been no animosity towards him at his marriage to Jungi Shah's daughter. One issue with the current primary source literature is that the Aga Khan III's defense is not fully available due to the public. Arguing that the testimony would lead to conflict within the community, the defense counsel asked for the judge to clear the court. Justice Russell permitted this request, and although the private evidence was used in the adjudication, it was expunged from all public records.  Legal decisions  # Justice Russell found that the religious offerings were made out of ‚Äúdeep vernation and reverence‚Äù for the Imam and were made for him to use as he saw fit. # The Khoja followers of Aga Khan III were defined to be Shia Imami Ismailis, a group different from both the Sunnis and Ithnasharias. # Justice Russell sides with the defense and argued that Sir Sultan Muhammad Shah had been generous to his extended family and did not commit fraudulent activity to claim the assets of the Aga Khan family. # The judge found these accusations to have no foundation and concluded that they should have never been made.  Impact  As a case generally around inheritance within the Aga Khan family, the decision by Justice Russell immediately concluded the rights of the Sir Sultan Muhammad Shah, Aga Khan III to the assets of family assets accrued by his grandfather and father. More broadly, the Haji Bibi case furthered defined the religious identity of the Khoja followers of the Aga Khan as Shia Imami Ismailis, distinct from both the Sunnis and Ithna‚Äôasharis. This label would become a primary marker of identity, and over time, many of the practices of the Khojas would change to remove some of the Hindu or Indic elements to better match the Muslim community. During the Imamate of Aga Khan III, the Nizaris would grow in prominence and followers. The Imam would play a significant role in the independence movement from Britain as well as the formation of Pakistan.

Early life and education  Henry was born in Tallahassee, Florida, to Anthony Henry and Oare Dozier-Henry, both former professors at Florida A&M; University (FAMU); his father is a middle school teacher and adjunct professor of political science and his mother is a professor of adult education. At a young age, his parents exposed him to West African and African-American culture. At ten years old, he started playing the djembe. Henry also excelled in school and was admitted into a state program for gifted children. After graduating from high school, he attended FAMU and graduated with a bachelor's degree in mechanical engineering. Working under Gang Chen, he earned his master's and doctorate degrees in mechanical engineering from Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in 2009.  Career and research  After graduating from MIT, Henry worked as a postdoc in materials science at Oak Ridge National Laboratory, researching derivations of thermal conductivity from first principles, and later at Northwestern University, where he investigated the thermodynamic properties of oxides. He received research fellowships from the Lemelson Foundation, the Department of Energy, the UNCF, and Ford Foundation. In 2011, Henry was a fellow of the Advanced Research Projects Agency‚ÄìEnergy before he joined Georgia Institute of Technology in April 2012 as assistant professor in the George W. Woodruff School of Mechanical Engineering. In 2016, Henry earned the National Science Foundation‚Äôs Career Award with a grant to study heat conduction via vibrations referred to as phonons. Using sonification, his research hopes to create an educational app to represent the unique vibrations of the elements in the periodic table as sounds audible to the human ear and to study the interaction between the different modes of vibration. On January 23, 2017, Henry‚Äôs team at Georgia Tech also achieved the highest recorded operating temperature, , for a liquid pump which operated continuously for 72 hours. The achievement was recognized by the Guinness World Records. The pump is made entirely of ceramic materials and was able to pump molten tin heated to very high temperatures. Henry also conducts research into cost-effective methods to store renewable energy. In a 2018 paper published Energy & Environmental Science, his team described a storage system, TEGS-MPV (thermal energy grid storage using multi-junction photovoltaics) and given the moniker \\"Sun in a box\\" in media sources. TEGS-MPV uses molten silicon as a battery to store energy as heat, ready to be delivered into an electrical grid on demand. The system is slated to operate at costs significantly lower than existing electrical energy storage systems.

Jones is a professor of regulatory biology and the Edwin K. Hunter Chair at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies. She uses proteomics to study transcription elongation and molecular biology to understand protein coordination. Jones identified elongation factors, a class of proteins which are important in viral gene expression.  Early life and education  Jones earned her PhD in biochemistry at the University of California, Riverside. She was made a Pew Scholar in 1987. Her Pew Foundation fellowship allowed her to study the transcription mechanisms that are responsible for rapid induction in mammalian genes. Jones showed how the RNA polymerase II transcription factor Sp1 binds to DNA and activates RNA.  Research and career  Jones is a professor of regulatory biology and Edwin K. Hunter Chair at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies. Jones holds an adjunct position at University of California, San Diego. She has worked extensively on understanding the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV). She investigated several proteins that interact with HIV-Tat (Tat). Tat is a protein created by HIV, which has been described as an \\"engine for HIV replication\\". Jones identified several proteins (including Cyclin T1, CycT1, and SSu72) that are required for HIV gene expression. SSu72 is a phosphatase that binds to Tat and speeds up the transcription process that replicates the virus. Unfortunately, CycT1 is needed for normal cell function, so is not an ideal target for antivirals. Jones looks to create small molecule inhibitors that restrict these proteins. She identified that the small molecule JIB-04 is particularly effective in destroying Tat. She used DIFFpop to identify the protein targets of JIB-04. DIFFpop revealed that JIB-04 decreases the levels of Tat because it binds together two enzymes in the host cell, SHMT2 and BRCC36, which subsequently enable the cells to destroy Tat. At present JIB-04 is too toxic to primary T-cells, but Jones and colleagues are working on investigations of other small molecules that can still inhibit Tat expression. Jones demonstrated that in colon cancer, the mutated adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) regulates the expression of genes which control cancer growth. She demonstrated that APC cannot turn off growth control genes as it cannot bind to a protein that presents metastasis. She has gone on to show that transcription elongation is involved with the differentiation of stem cells. It is well known that wnt and activin pathways are needed for stem cell growth, but it was unclear how they work together. Jones showed how they work together to activate transcription. She also demonstrated that activation of the wnt signaling pathway can result in colon cancer. During their investigations of embryonic stem cells, Jones identified a third pathway, YAP, which slows the activin pathway and stops stem cells from specialising. She used CRISPR-cas9 to remove the genes that make the YAP protein, reducing the number of steps to convert embryonic stem cells into functional heart cells. She has also studied the CDK12 gene, which is mutated in 3 - 5% of prostate, ovarian and breast cancers. The majority of cancers that contain a mutated CDK12 gene are not responsive to immunotherapy, so creating inhibitors of CDK12 could make cancers more treatable. When CDK12 is inhibited cells cannot repair DNA and the cells are more likely to die during chemotherapy. In 2017 Jones filed a lawsuit against the Salk Institute for Biological Studies for gender discrimination, citing that their work had not been recognised their labs were small and they received less funding. She claimed that imagery of women faculty members was used in Salk Institute promotional material to secure funding from donors. Jones settled her case in August 2018.

History  The design was a private venture by Bethlehem Steel and was offered to the French in 1916 under the designation One-pounder 37 mm Semi-automatic Gun, Mark C on Carriage Mark A. It was intended as an infantry support gun or as a landing gun for amphibious operations. In the infantry support role, it would have been used in loopholing operations to neutralize enemy machine guns in pillboxes. It is believed the French ordered 200 guns in 1916, 100 during 1917 and another 1,000 during 1918. However, the exact number that were delivered or how many entered French service is unknown. In July 1918 the US ordnance department accepted an offer from the French to sell 200 guns produced by Bethlehem Steel to the US Army. The US Army agreed to take over the French order assuming they would be receiving the Canon d'Infanterie de 37 mod√®le 1916 TRP which the US Army had already accepted for service. However, when the first batch of 75 was delivered to the AEF in France it was discovered that it was a completely different gun which used its own incompatible ammunition. The AEF agreed to accept the next 110 guns that were in the process of being completed and gave them the designation of 37 mm Infantry Gun Model 1917. The AEF may have not used the M1917 in action. So the 185 guns the US Army acquired were the product of an administrative error. The Army couldn't envision a use for them and since few were acquired they were declared obsolete in 1921 and retired from service. However, their light weight, low profile and high velocity would have made it a useful anti-tank gun.  Design  alt= The Model 1917 featured a forged one piece nickel steel barrel with a semi-automatic vertical sliding wedge breech. The split-trail carriage had a hydro-spring recoil system, two wooden spoked wheels and fired Fixed QF ammunition. The gun was light enough that traverse and elevation could be controlled from a stock attached to the breech of the gun. There was also a seat attached to the trails for the gunner.

Biography Pastor Serrador was born in Camag√ºey, Cuba in 1919, the grandson of the actors Esteban Serrador and Josefina Mar√≠. His father was the merchant Heriberto Pastor and his mother was the actress , the sister of Esteban, , and Pepita Serrador. He was the first cousin of director Narciso Ib√°√±ez Serrador. His childhood was spent in Argentina, where he began his career as an actor on the radio. He debuted in theater around 1935, and in 1938 he married the Argentine actress , separating a few years later. From that union his first son would be born. The pressures to which he was subjected by his activities as secretary of the pushed him to move to Spain, where he married the actress Luisa Sala and took up residence in 1952. That year, he and his wife took part in the play Divorci√©monos, and in 1954 he started a small company of his own, premiering the play El sabor del pecado. Serrador then resumed a prolific interpretive career, in theater, film, and television. On the big screen he starred in such titles as ' (1955) by Jos√© Mar√≠a Elorrieta (with whom he would work on 15 films), ' (1956), The Violet Seller (1958), and Course Completed. He also achieved great success on Spanish stages with the plays En El Escorial, cari√±o m√≠o, ', La Sauvage (1953), ' (1954), ' (1956), ' (1957), Juana de Lorena (1962), ' (1962), ' (1963), ' (1963), ' (1964), A Midsummer Night's Dream (1964), ' (1966), ' (1968), ' (1969), Por lo menos tres (1969), ' (1970), and ' (1979), the musicals Annie (1981) and The Sound of Music (1982), ' (1984), the revue ' (1985), ' (1989), and ' (1994). Present on Televisi√≥n Espa√±ola since the early days of the broadcast medium in Spain, Serrador was part of the cast of one of its first series, ' (1959‚Äì1960). In successive years he would portray dozens of characters on shows such as Estudio 1, ', ', ' (1985), and ' (1986), the latter with his wife, which would be her last appearance before her sudden death. After Luisa Sala's death, he married Mar√≠a Teresa Alonso in 1987 and they had one son.

It is strictly aerobic, flagellated, and motile. Colonies are white, convex, circular, and slightly transparent. S. humi grows in the presence of arsenic and sodium chloride. The optimum temperature for growth is 28ÀöC, but S. humi can grow within the temperature range of 16-42 ÀöC. The organism can grow in a pH range of 6.5-9. Culture growth occurs on Reasoner‚Äôs 2A agar (R2A agar) medium and in 1/10 tryptic soy broth.Qiao, Z. Cao, M., Wang, D., Liao, S., & Wang, G. (December 2018) ‚ÄúSphingosinicella humi sp.

Doi: 10.1099/ijsem.0.003186 Metabolism S. humi reduces nitrogen. It is capable of hydrolyzing tween 20, arginine, and urea. It is oxidase positive, meaning that it produces cytochrome c oxidases. It is catalase negative, suggesting that it is incapable of forming catalase, and is therefore incapable of neutralizing hydrogen peroxide. S. humi can also produce acid from D-galactose and assimilate propionate, L-proline, acetate, D-galactose, and valerianate. Genomic Sequencing The genome of S. humi was sequenced using 16S rRNA. The chromosome of S. humi is 3.0Mb long, contains 4 contigs, and is predicted to be composed of 2981 genes. The DNA G-C content range of S. humi is 65.9 mol%. S. humi was significantly similar to four strains of Sphingosinicella, specifically 97% similar to Sphingosinicella vermicomposti YC7378, 96.1% similar to Sphingosinicella xenopeptidilytica 3-2W4, 96% similar to Sphingosinicella microcystineivorans Y2, and 95.9% similar to Sphingosinicella soli KSL-125. The genomic similarities aid in the determination of S. humi as part of the genus Sphingosinicella. Ecology S. humi was isolated from arsenic contaminated farmland red soil from the village, Jiaotain, in the city of Daye, Hubei Province, People‚Äôs Republic of China.

With its cultural foundation in the South Bronx, hip hop has grown in popularity since its beginnings in 1979. Popular dominance of the genre coincided with the international #MeToo movement, which exposed the sexual misconduct of men in positions of power in the field of entertainment. Although women and men from all walks of life worldwide have shared their #MeToo stories, accounts in the music industry (particularly in the genre of rap) were few; the industry evaded public scrutiny, despite its dominance as broadcast and streaming media. A controversial issue in rap and hip-hop culture since its inception has been the violence and aggression of its hardcore styles. The prevalence of misogyny, sexism and sexual violence in the lyrics of the most-popular gangsta rap lyrics triggered public debate about obscenity and indecency and was a topic of U.S. Senate hearings during the mid-1990s. The common depiction of women as video vixens in music videos and being called \\"bitches\\" or \\"hos\\" in derogatory and misogynistic lyrics may escalate gender violence and anti-black misogyny (misogynoir). The multi- platinum sales of The Chronic by Dr. Dre (featuring Snoop Doggy Dogg) in 1992 bely the genre's lyrics. In 1999, Anthony M. Giovacchini wrote about a song from the album in the journal Poverty and Prejudice: Media and Race: > \\"Nuthin' but a 'G' Thang\\" reads: 'And before me dig on a bitch I have to > find a contraceptive. You never know, she could be earn'n her man and > learn'n her man And at the same time burn'n her man And you know I ain't > wit' that shit lieutenant Ain't no pussy good enough to get free ride on my > [B]ennett.' These lyrics portray women as dirty sex toys that have no value > other than the pleasure they can provide during intercourse. Critics say that the pervasive usage of misogynistic language in rap and other popular genres, such as country music, can help normalize attitudes trivializing women and encouraging sexual assault. Misogynistic lyrics in popular music may contribute to rape culture. Songs referring to girls or women of color as usable or disposable, with lyrics suggesting rape, assault and murder, evoke concern and criticism. Feminist critiques insert \\"new questions about representation, [provide] additional insight about embodied experience, and [offer] alternative models for critical engagement\\" with hip hop, and misogynistic rhetoric has been discussed in academic literature. Songs considered misogynistic or sexist may be amplified by artists such as Rick Ross or XXXTentacion in an age of mobile music and technology. People from different age groups (tweens to adults) and backgrounds in the U.S. and abroad have been repeatedly exposed to this content. Artists accused of violence against women or sexual assault may still circulate their music. Case outcomes may be ignored due to love of the music (if not the lyrics) and the artists who perform it. Consumers of rap and hip hop may perceive intimate- partner violence as normal, rather than harmful. The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) reported in 2001 that music, film and television convey \\"sexual messages\\" which are increasingly \\"explicit in dialogue, lyrics, and behavior ... These messages contain unrealistic, inaccurate, and misleading information that young people accept as fact.\\" In 2010, another AAP report stated that representations of sexuality in mass media such as music can lead to a \\"major disconnect between what mainstream media portray‚Äîcasual sex and sexuality with no consequences‚Äîand what children and teenagers need‚Äîstraightforward information about human sexuality and the need for contraception when having sex.\\" In \\"Still on the Auction Block: The (S)exploitation of Black Adolescent Girls in Rap(e) Music and Hip-Hop Culture\\", a chapter of The Sexualization of Childhood, Carolyn M. West discusses the effect of rape and sexual images in hip hop. West writes, \\"Exposure to sexualized images in hip-hop has been found to influence black girls perception of male-female gender roles, attitudes toward sexual assault, physical dating violence, and physical attractiveness ... Music videos and lyrics that perpetuate gender inequality and glorify risky sexual behaviors but rarely provide healthy sexual messages or emphasize possible negative health consequences may increase the likelihood that black adolescent girls will have unplanned pregnancies, early sexual onset, or sexually transmitted disease acquisition, including HIV/AIDS.\\" Partner and sexual violence in hip-hop lyrics Debate about sexist lyrics in various genres of popular music began during the 1980s. According to Ummni Khan, a \\"kink lens\\" can be used to identify a feminist reading of rap lyrics as \\"rapey\\" or \\"allegedly perpetuat[ing] sexual violence, misogyny, and rape myths.\\" Some critics see the hypersexualized discourse which targets women in rap songs as a sign of toxic masculinity in a patriarchal culture, and others view feminist critiques as politically correct. Eva Cooke wrote that homosociality (male bonding and patriarchal discourse focusing on black male actors in the lyrics of many rap songs) may be healthy, but can \\"turn toxic and violent\\" with misogynistic lyrics denigrating black women.Cooke, Eva M. \\"# WeKnowWhatYouDid: An Ethnographic Exploration of Male Socialization and Rape Culture at a Black College for Men.\\" (2018). = 1980s = *In 1988, the rap group N.W.A released \\"A Bitch is a Bitch\\".

Gender violence in hip hop and R&B;  Surviving R. Kelly, a three-part television documentary which aired in January 2019, described R. Kelly's history of sexual assault. Kelly was charged with 10 counts of sexual assault in the Chicago metropolitan area from 1998 to 2010. Three of the 10 victims were between the ages of 13 and 16. During the 1990s, Kelly was found to be married to 15-year-old Aaliyah. The marriage was annulled, and Kelly said that he thought Aaliyah was 18. Cardi B has said that she used sex to drug and rob men. She released a video in which she talks about tricking a cheating boyfriend by getting him drunk and forcing him to have sex with a transgender woman. The partner violence in hip hop is not limited to men, although Cardi B says that she has mature. The incidents have been compared to Kelly's, however, and Twitter users have adopted a #SurvivingCardiB hashtag.

According to the arrest warrant, Kodak Black forced the girl onto a bed and then the floor, where he committed sexual battery. The victim \\"repeatedly told the defendant no and to stop. The defendant did not stop.\\" A rape kit was presented as evidence. Black was released on a $100,000 bond while awaiting trial. Solange Knowles performing in 2014 In 2009, Chris Brown was charged with two felonies and criminal threats for assaulting Rihanna before the Grammy Awards and was released on $50,000 bail. Before the assault, Rihanna noticed a text on Brown's phone from another women. \\"I caught him in a lie, and he wouldn't tell the truth. And I wouldn't drop it,\\" Rihanna told Diane Sawyer in a 20/20 interview, portions of which aired on Good Morning America. \\"I couldn't take that he kept lying to me, and he couldn't take that I wouldn't drop it ... It escalated into him being violent towards me. And it was ugly.\\" He punched and bit her, threatening to kill her after she pretended to tell her assistant to call the police. Pictures of Rihanna were leaked showing trauma to her face and body: a split lip, swelling, bruising, a bloody nose, and bite marks on her arms and fingers. Brown was sentenced to five years' probation, and they reconciled in 2012. In a Vanity Fair interview, Rihanna said that she thought she was \\"built to handle [things] like this\\"; later, she realized that she needed to \\"walk away.\\" Although Brown and Rihanna are no longer friends, she still cares about him and wants him to be successful.  Altercation between artists  Solange Knowles and Jay-Z had a much-publicized physical altercation at the 2014 Met Gala fundraiser. Jay-Z released a statement after the altercation, saying: \\"We have always had a good relationship. We've had one disagreement. Before and after we've been cool. That is my sister.

Biography = Youth and personal life = Mendoza was the third sonHence, under the rules of primogeniture he could not inherit his father's titles and was relegated to the status of a \\"segundo\\" (literally \\"second man\\") in the aristocratic pecking order of Spain, though his father was a grandee. of I√±igo L√≥pez de Mendoza y Mendoza, 3rd Marquess of Mond√©jar, and Mar√≠a de Mendoza y Arag√≥n, daughter of √ç√±igo L√≥pez de Mendoza, 4th Duke of the Infantado. At the time of his birth his father was Captain general of the viceroyalty of Granada in the old kingdom of Andalusia, that had been only recently (1492) definitively conquered. He was also Alcalde of the Alhambra, the presumptive birthplace of Francisco. Around the age of fifteen Francisco started his studies in the Classics at the University of Alcal√° and in philosophy at the University of Salamanca. These studies were interrupted when he joined his father during the latter's embassy to the Holy See in 1560-1562. In 1568 he again joined his father when the latter was entrusted with the suppression of the Rebellion of the Alpujarras (1568‚Äì71), as a captain.P√©rez, Caballeria He was awarded the encomienda (landed estate) of Valdepe√±as, one of the commanderies of the Order of Calatrava, of which he had been a knightThe knights of the military order of Calatrava had been sworn to celibacy until 1540. This austerity may partly explain why Mendoza apparently made no attempt to get married until after his father's death in 1580. since age 12, in recognition of his service. Mendoza continued working for his father in administrative positions during his father's appointments as Viceroy of first Valencia (1572-1575) and later of Naples (1575-1579)Rodriguez Villa, pp. 488-493 In March 1584 Mendoza married by proxy (represented by Juan de Zu√±iga) Mar√≠a Ruiz de Liori Col√≥n and Cardona, the daughter of Sancho Folch de Cardona, 1st Marquess of Guadalest. Cardona did not have a male heirHis son Crist√≥bal Col√≥n de Cardona, 2nd Marquess of Guadalest, had died in 1583., so he made one of the provisions of the marriage contract that Mendoza would adopt his wife's surname Cardona, and crest, during the marriage. When Cardona soon after died, Maria inherited the title, and Mendoza became Marquess of Guadelest de jure uxoris. Cardona had also been Almirante de Arag√≥n, which title his daughter (and hence Mendoza) also inherited. For that reason Mendoza was henceforth known as the \\"Admiral of Aragon\\", though he never held a naval command. The marriage also brought a long list of lawsuits with it, as Maria had been previously briefly married to Juan Felipe Fern√°ndez de Heredia, Count of Fuentes, and from this followed conflicts with the family Col√≥n (relatives of Christopher Columbus) about the unpaid dowry and several disputed aristocratic titles. The lawsuits were very expensive and took a very long time. Mendoza felt therefore constrained to engage the Toledo attorney Agust√≠n √Ålvarez, and promised payment of a large sum on the contingency of success. When the lawsuit initially ended successfully in 1586 Mendoza was unable to pay, however. √Ålvarez took umbrage and switched sides, which resulted eventually in the loss of the lawsuit.Blasco, Maria de Cardona The marriage brought the birth of a daughter, Maria Jos√© de Cardona Mendoza, who unfortunately did not live long. The little girl died on 25 January 1590 In the same year Mendoza got into trouble with king Philip II of Spain. On behalf of his uncle the duke of Infantado he had negotiated a marriage contract for the latter's daughter Mencia de Mendoza with Antonio √Ålvarez de Toledo, 5th Duke of Alba. Unfortunately these negotiations took place without the consent of the king and the groom-to-be had already married Catalina Enriquez Riberea, the daughter of the duke of Alcal√°. Though this previous marriage was annulled, the king was not amused and jailed the people implicated in the matter. Mendoza was incarcerated in the castle of Tur√©gano on 31 July 1590. He was only released in August 1592, but meanwhile his wife had died in Calzada de Calatrava in August 1591, where she had moved after Mendoza had been transferred to the nearby monastery- fortress of Calatrava la Nueva. After his release Mendoza entered in marriage negotiations for the hand of a daughter of the Count of Chinch√≥n, Mencia de la Cerda. As the bride's brother Luis Jer√≥nimo de Cabrera, 4th Count of Chinch√≥n was a favorite of king Philip, this contributed to Mendoza's rehabilitation, even though the marriage eventually fell through because the lady lost interest. = In the Netherlands (1595 - 1603) = Mendoza received the post of mayordomo mayor (lord high steward) in the household of Albert VII, Archduke of Austria in 1595. When Albert was appointed as Governor General of the Spanish Netherlands, as successor of his elder brother Archduke Ernest of Austria in February 1595, Mendoza was charged with the organisation of the journey to Brussels. Though Mendoza was an adherent of the \\"Papalist\\" faction of the Spanish court (the successor of the \\"Albalists\\" of a previous generation), he was also a client of the count of Chinch√≥n, the leader of the Castilian faction (previously known as the \\"Ebolists\\"). This may explain why his behavior in his new posting was somewhat ambivalent at times.Hortal Mu√±oz, pp. 1016-1017 Soon after his arrival in the Netherlands, the death of his kinsman Rodrigo Silva, duke of Pastrana, who was master of the horse, gave Mendoza the opportunity of acquiring that office for himself. So from 1596 he became general of cavalry of the Army of Flanders. He also was involved in the negotiations of the Peace of Vervins, which ended the war with France. Another diplomatic mission of his went to Poland, where he tried to oppose the trade of that kingdom with the Dutch Republic. The peace with France freed the hands of the Army of Flanders in the ongoing war against the Dutch Republic. The government of Archduke Albert therefore decided on a new offensive against that adversary in the Fall of 1598. A complicating factor was that the Spanish mercenaries of the army had not been paid for a long time and therefore were in a mutinous mood. They had \\"lived off the land\\" in the Spanish Netherlands for some time, which made the regime very unpopular. During the absence of Archduke Albert in connection with his marriage to the Spanish Infanta Isabella Clara Eugenia, which would bring him the sovereignty over the Spanish Netherlands, he handed over the government of the Spanish Netherlands to Cardinal Andrew and Mendoza. Mendoza (as temporary commander-in-chief of the army in agreement with Cardinal Andrew) therefore decided to kill two birds with one stone and opened an offensive against the Dutch Republic from an oblique angle, by fording first the river Meuse at Venlo and later the river Rhine near Orsoy, Germany. Next he marched along the right bank of the Rhine toward the border of the Dutch Republic, taking in short succession the town of Alpen, Germany and the fortress of Broich in the Duchy of Berg. The garrison of the latter place was massacred and the count who lived there, murdered. Then, after the capture of Moers he retook the fortress town of Rheinberg which had in August 1597 been taken by Maurice, Prince of Orange, the Captain general of the Dutch States Army in the first Siege of Rheinberg. From there Mendoza divided his forces, sending one part to Doetinchem in Zutphen County, which was captured, and the other part to Rees, Germany, which also was captured. Then the Spanish army went into winter quarters, visiting severe privations on the neutral German countryside, giving the Germans a foretaste of what the Thirty Years' War was going to be like. This motivated the German princes of the Westphalian Kreis to start recruiting mercenaries to drive the Spaniards out in 1599.Davies, pp. 322-326 Meanwhile, king Philip II had died and was succeeded by king Philip III of Spain. In the Spring of 1599 Cardinal Andrew took over the military reins from Mendoza (Archduke Albert still being absent), and ordered Mendoza to invade the Bommelerwaard and lay siege to Zaltbommel. This campaign ended in a fiasco. The only positive result was the construction of two Spanish fortresses, Crevecoeur and San Andreas. The latter was taken the next year by Maurice in the Siege of San Andreas (1600).Allen, p. 23 The Army of Flanders was in this period paralyzed by mutinies and could only look on when Maurice undertook a full-scale invasion of the Spanish Netherlands in the Summer of 1600 on his way to invest Dunkirk, an important naval base for Spain at the time. Only when he had reached Nieuwpoort, Belgium Archduke Albert, who by now had taken personal command of the Army of Flanders, succeeded in arriving at an accommodation with the Spanish mutineers in Diest and persuading them to return to service. Albert then advanced on the States Army near Nieuwpoort, with Mendoza in charge of his cavalry. On 2 July 1600 the Battle of Nieuwpoort took place, in which the Spanish army was routed. Mendoza was taken prisoner by the Dutch.Davies, pp. 335-357 According to Mendoza himself (in a letter to Philip III of 7 October 1603) he had fought rather heroically and initially successfully. Only when the Archduke got into danger because of his risky behavior, and Mendoza was forced to go to his aid, the leaderless Spanish cavalry broke. He fought a heroic rearguard action with two hundred troopers, while the Archduke left the field. Other sources differ. Cf. Allen, p. 47, note 36 Mendoza was held as a prisoner of war for two years, first in the fortress of Woerden and subsequently in the Binnenhof at The HagueHe was held in a relatively comfortable apartment above the Audience Chamber of the Hof van Holland, where two decades later Johan van Oldenbarnevelt spent the last months of his life during the Trial of Oldenbarnevelt, Grotius and Hogerbeets. He was eventually exchanged for a large number of Dutch prisoners of war and a large ransom in 1602Davies,pp. 356-357 Immediately after his release Mendoza was employed by the Archduke to block a Dutch invasion toward Maastricht. Mendoza, at the head of a force that he considered too weak to engage Maurice in the field, retreated to Diest where he awaited reinforcements that Spinola had marched up from Italy. When these arrived Maurice retreated in the direction of Grave to which Spanish-held fortress he laid siege, while Mendoza left him unmolested till it was too late to lift the siege.Allen, pp. 84-86 = In Spain (1603 - 1623) = Then king Philip III recalled him to the court in Valladolid where he arrived in February 1603. Having lost the lawsuit about the succession to the Marquisate of Mondejar while he was a prisoner of war, Mendoza was in financial difficulties and forced to accept the charity of his brother Juan for the rest of his life. In 1606 he was arrested on the pretext of an altercation by one of his servants with a doorman of the count of Villalonga, a secretary of State (and favorite of the king), and locked up in Torrej√≥n de Velasco, but he was released in January 1607. A few years later he accused Rodrigo Calder√≥n, Count of Oliva, an ally of the king's favorite, the duke of Lerma of corruption in the case of the nomination of one of Lerma's sons to the position of alcalde of the Alhambra, to which the family of Mendoza had ancient claims. This resulted again in Mendoza's arrest, this time on false accusations of treason. He was incarcerated in Santorcaz on 20 May 1609, but subsequently transferred to monasteries in Guadalajara, Castilla‚ÄìLa Mancha for his deteriorating health. He was released after five years imprisonment without ever having been convicted of anything. Mendoza decided to take holy orders in 1617, at the age of 70. The new king Philip IV of Spain in recognition of the injustices he had been subjected to under the reign of the king's father, proposed the elevation of Mendoza to bishop of Sig√ºenza on 8 August 1622. Mendoza died on 1 March 1623 in Madrid. He was first interred in a chapel in the College that the Society of Jesus maintained at the University of Alcal√° (co-founded by his sister Catalina). In 1632 he was reburied before the high altar.

The chair, Wegner's best selling design is a notable example of Danish furniture design. The chair has been in continuous production since its original release. The chair is especially popular in Japan, where sales in the country account for more than a quarter of the annual production. There is an entire book dedicated to the chair published in the Japanese language.  History  Ming Dynasty provided Wegner with inspiration for his designalt=left150x150px In 1948, Holger Hansen of Carl Hansen & S√∏n and Mogens Tuck of Andreas Tuck together commissioned Wegner to produce 9 pieces of furniture. Wegner would create 4 tables for Andreas Tuck and 4 chairs and a sideboard for Carl Hansen & S√∏n. The companies worked closely together and benefited from being able to market their chairs and tables together. Wegner produced CH22, CH23, CH24, and CH25 for the chairs and CH304 for the sideboard. CH24, soon to be known as the Wishbone Chair, was an iteration of Wegner's Chinese Chair series. The Chinese Chairs were produced for Fritz Hansen starting in 1944 and took inspiration from the round wooden seats of Ming China. Hansen was originally displeased with Wegner's designs, which he felt looked like garden furniture, and the complexity of the manufacturing required to put the items into production. The manufacturing process was beyond the scope of Carl Hansen & S√∏n's factory; the back legs of the Wishbone chair had to be turned by a sub-supplier and the steam bending of the top bar had to be done at an outside factory. Nevertheless, all of the chair designs went into production the following year. The Wishbone Chair became his greatest commercial success and has remained in continuous production. In the mid-1990s, Carl Hansen & S√∏n increased the seat height of the chair by 2 cm to reflect the increase in height of the European and American populations purchasing the chair. The chair in its original dimensions is still produced and sold in Asia.

Chappell (born Emma Carolyn Bayton) is the founder and CEO of the United Bank of Philadelphia. She was the first African-American woman to form a commercial bank in the United States. She was also the first female Vice President of a major bank in the state of Pennsylvania.  Early life  Emma Carolyn Bayton was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania on February 18, 1941. When she was 14, her mother died, so she was raised by her father, George Bayton. She attended West Philadelphia High School and was a member of Zion Baptist Church. Her pastor, Rev. Leon H. Sullivan, a leader in the Philadelphia civil right's movement, noticed her superior mathematical skills after giving her an aptitude test. With his help, she became a clerk- photographer at Continental Bank in 1959, where she made photostats of deposited checks for bank records.  Career  The bank required that Chappell get a college degree before she could be promoted, so she attended class at Temple University at night for five years. In 1967, Chappell was asked to enter an executive training program, allowing her to work in every department the bank had to offer. She was promoted to assistant treasurer in 1971 after completing the program. By 1977, she had become Continental Bank's first African American Vice President. She was the first female Vice President of a major bank in the history of Pennsylvania. Chappell was in charge of the Community Business Loan and Development Department for loans to minority-owned and women-owned small businesses. She prided herself on using her position to assist in the development of Philadelphia's black community. She granted more than $30 million in loans to black enterprises. She also organized the Model Cities Business and Commercial Project, now called the Philadelphia Commercial Development Project, which revitalized commerce in the inner city. Chappell returned to school in 1982 and earned her master's degree from the Stonier Graduate School of Banking at Rutgers University. She took a leave of absence from the bank in 1984 to serve as national treasurer for Jesse Jackson's presidential campaign. In 1987, a group of prominent black Philadelphians approached Chappell with the possibility of starting a black controlled bank, and they deemed her the potential leader. They contributed $600,000, but she was stalled by the stock market crash of October 1987. In 1992, after a five- year effort to raise the 5 million dollars that was required by Pennsylvania regulators in order to capitalize a bank, Chappell founded the United Bank of Philadelphia. She raised 3 million from the black community by selling shares in $500 blocks, and raised another 3 million from big investors, resulting in 1 million more than was required. She created the United Bank of Philadelphia with intentions to foster community development by providing quality, personalized, comprehensive banking services to businesses and individuals in Philadelphia. In 1999, in recognition of the bank's exponential growth, the United Bank received the coveted Blue Chip Enterprises Award, sponsored by Mass Mutual and the United States Chamber of Commerce. Chapell, who was president, CEO, and chairman of the board, left in 2000, but the United Bank of Philadelphia remains a force in the black community. The bank celebrated their 25th anniversary in 2017. She is one of the founders of the Delaware Valley Mortgage Plan, which was designed to help low to moderate income families buy homes. She was the chairperson and an instrumental element in the founding of Operation PUSH, a nonprofit organization that strives to achieve financial equality for minorities. She was also a founding vice president of the National Rainbow Coalition. She was appointed by President Clinton to serve as a member of the board of directors of the Southern African Enterprise Development Fund and the board of trustees of the Malcolm Baldridge Quality Service Award. Chappell also spearheaded a program \\"Passport 2000\\" to introduce 2000 students to savings and money management as the key to economic independence.  Legacy  Chappell is known for her strong leadership and advocacy in business, civil rights, and politics. She's also known for her support of children, minorities and women. She infamously believed in the critical importance of community banks and helping residents to achieve their hopes and dreams. Her work as a banker and community leader has granted her more than 500 awards, numerous national and international appointments, and five honorary doctoral degrees. Despite her success and many accolades, in 1998 Chappell said: \\"I'm very proud of my accomplishments. It doesn't matter how many awards I've received, there's a saying: \`A prophet is without honor.'\\"  Personal life  Emma married Verdayne Chappell in the late 1960s, but they later divorced. They had two children: Tracey and Verdaynea. She has expressed that her religion is Baptist. Chappell is an honorary member of Alpha Kappa Alpha.

History  =Waterworks trusts= Following droughts in the 1870s, the Water Conservation and Distribution Act 1881 was passed to help establish local waterworks trusts. It allowed local trusts to borrow funds from the government for the construction of water supply works. The trusts could then charge water rates to users in order to recoup their costs and pay the interest on the loans. In December 1889, the shires of Oakleigh, Dandenong, Moorabbin, and Mornington voted for the formation of an urban water trust to bring water from the catchment area of the Dandenong Ranges. Plans were made for \\"the storage of 596,000,000 cubic feet of water, to supply 39,000 people with water for domestic purposes\\" to \\"ensure a permanent and efficient supply\\". The cost of the scheme was estimated to be ¬£41,000 with the contribution of each shire being Moorabbin ¬£23,247, Oakleigh ¬£11,852, Dandenong ¬£5,000 and Mornington ¬£1,000. Storage tanks were proposed to be constructed for each township to provide for a supply of at least 20,000 gallons. The State Rivers and Water Supply Commission was created in 1905 by the Water Act 1905 to coordinate and manage the State's rural water resources and eventually to take over all Victorian rural water trusts and irrigation schemes. The Commission was replaced in 1984 by the Rural Water Commission.State Rivers and Water Supply Commission The Geelong Municipal Waterworks Trust was created in 1908 and expanded in 1910 to become the Geelong Waterworks and Sewerage Trust. In 1984 the trust was merged with other local water and sewage authorities to form the Geelong and District Water Board, and again restructured to form the Barwon Region Water Authority in 1994 (trading as Barwon Water). =Melbourne and Metropolitan Board of Works= Melbourne received its first piped water, from the Yan Yean Reservoir, in 1857. Water shortages in the late 1870s led to the construction of the Toorourrong scheme in 1882-1885, and the Maroondah Aqueduct in 1886-1891\\\\. In 1888 a large part of the upper Yarra valley was reserved for water supply purposes. In 1891, the Melbourne and Metropolitan Board of Works (MMBW) was a public utility board in Melbourne, set up to provide water supply, sewerage and sewage treatment functions for the city, and to create a piped sewerage system. MMBW's responsibility covered the Yan Yean Reservoir (supplemented by the Toorourrong Scheme), the first stage of the Maroondah Scheme, and six metropolitan service reservoirs. MMBW continued to augment Melbourne's water supply with diversions from upland tributaries of the Yarra River. The Maroondah Scheme was extended with a pipeline diversion from Coranderrk Creek (1908). A diversion weir on the O'Shannassy River was completed in 1914 and replaced by the O'Shannassy Reservoir in 1928. Maroondah Reservoir was completed in 1927, replacing a diversion weir upstream of the site. Silvan Reservoir was completed in 1932 to regulate the increased flows in the O'Shannassy Aqueduct from the Upper Yarra River and Coranderrk Creek diversions. Water flowed out of Silvan Reservoir through the Mount Evelyn Aqueduct; the aqueduct was later replaced by pipes but is still visible in places with the Mount Evelyn Aqueduct Walk alongside. The diversion of water from the Upper Yarra River commenced in 1939 with a weir upstream of the present dam and an aqueduct and pipeline to the O'Shannassy Aqueduct. The Upper Yarra Dam was completed in 1957, increasing Melbourne's total storage capacity to nearly 300,000 megalitres. While the Upper Yarra Project was being built, a 1.7-metre diameter pipeline from a basin near Starvation Creek to Silvan Reservoir was completed in 1953. A duplicate pipeline of the same diameter was completed in 1964. In response to the severe drought of 1967‚Äì68: * the diversion of Starvation, McMahons, Armstrong and Cement Creeks commenced between 1968 and 1971. * Greenvale Reservoir, with a capacity of 27,000 megalitres was completed in 1971 to meet the growing need in the western suburbs, especially during summer. * construction of Cardinia Reservoir was started in 1969 with it being filled to its 287,000-megalitre capacity in 1977, bringing Melbourne's total storage capacity to 610,000 megalitres. To improve transfer capacity between Upper Yarra and Silvan reservoirs, and to enable water harvested from the Thomson River to be transferred to Cardinia Reservoir, the 2.1-metre diameter Yarra Valley Conduit and Silvan-Cardinia main were built in 1975. In 1969 work commenced on diverting part of the flow of the Thomson River in Gippsland into the Upper Yarra River catchment. The final stage of the Thomson project concluded in May 1983 with an extension of the Thomson-Yarra Tunnel and completion of the dam wall. Thomson Reservoir has a storage capacity of 1,068,000 megalitres. The Sugarloaf Reservoir Project, including a major pumping station and water treatment plant, was completed in 1981, increasing Melbourne's total storage capacity by 95,000 megalitres. Sugarloaf uses water pumped from the Yarra River at Yering Gorge and water transferred from Maroondah Reservoir via the Maroondah aqueduct. Sugarloaf is important in meeting peak summer demand in the northern parts of Melbourne. In 1991, MMBW was merged with a number of smaller urban water authorities to form Melbourne Water. 1990s restructure =Catchment Management Authorities= Ten Catchment Management Authorities (CMAs) that cover the whole of Victoria were established in 1994. Their functions include the production of 5-year regional catchment strategies, which is a statement of how each CMA plans to manage its region over the coming 5 years and is developed with the principles of integrated catchment management. It should cover the condition of the land and water, assess land degradation and prioritise areas for attention, set out a program of works to be undertaken and who will be undertaking the works, specify how the works and land and water condition will be monitored and provide for review of the strategy. The regional catchment strategy can also undertake to provide incentives to landholders, educational programs, research and other services.Catchment and Land Protection Act 1994, s.12, page 49. Victorian Government, 2007. =Melbourne Water= MMBW was abolished in 1992 and was succeeded by Melbourne Water. In 2008, Melbourne Water commenced work on the North South Pipeline from northern Victoria's Eildon and Goulburn Valley area to Melbourne. Another project to avert a water shortage in Melbourne was the Victorian Desalination Plant at Wonthaggi, south-east of Melbourne, which was completed in December 2012. It has an annual capacity of 150 gigalitres. Melbourne Water pays the owner of the plant, even if no water is ordered, $608 million a year, or $1.8 million per day, for 27 years. The total payment is between $18 and $19 billion. On 1 April each year, the Minister for Water places an order for the following financial year, up to 150 gigalitres a year, at an additional cost to Melbourne Water and consumers. Geology and geography Victoria's northern border follows a straight line from Cape Howe to the start of the Murray River and then follows the Murray River as the remainder of the northern border. On the Murray River, the border is the southern bank of the river, so that none of the water of the Murray belongs to Victoria. The border also rests at the southern end of the Great Dividing Range, which stretches along the east coast and terminates west of Ballarat. It is bordered by South Australia to the west and shares Australia's shortest land border with Tasmania. The official border between Victoria and Tasmania is at 39¬∞12' S, which passes through Boundary Islet in the Bass Strait for 85 metres. Victoria contains many topographically, geologically and climatically diverse areas, ranging from the wet, temperate climate of Gippsland in the southeast to the snow-covered Victorian alpine areas which rise to almost , with Mount Bogong the highest peak at . There are extensive semi-arid plains to the west and northwest. There is an extensive series of river systems in Victoria. Most notable is the Murray River system. Other rivers include: Ovens River, Goulburn River, Patterson River, King River, Campaspe River, Loddon River, Wimmera River, Elgin River, Barwon River, Thomson River, Snowy River, Latrobe River, Yarra River, Maribyrnong River, Mitta River, Hopkins River, Merri River and Kiewa River. The state symbols include the pink heath (state flower), Leadbeater's possum (state animal) and the helmeted honeyeater (state bird). The state's capital, Melbourne, contains about 70% of the state's population and dominates its economy, media, and culture. For other cities and towns, see list of localities (Victoria) and local government areas of Victoria. Climate K√∂ppen climate types in Victoria Victoria has a varied climate despite its small size. It ranges from semi-arid temperate with hot summers in the north-west, to temperate and cool along the coast. Victoria's main land feature, the Great Dividing Range, produces a cooler, mountain climate in the centre of the state. Winters along the coast of the state, particularly around Melbourne, are relatively mild (see chart at right). Victoria's southernmost position on the Australian mainland means it is cooler and wetter than other mainland states and territories. The coastal plain south of the Great Dividing Range has Victoria's mildest climate. Air from the Southern Ocean helps reduce the heat of summer and the cold of winter. Melbourne and other large cities are located in this temperate region. The autumn months of April/May are mild and bring some of Australia's colourful foliage across many parts of the state. The Mallee and upper Wimmera are Victoria's warmest regions with hot winds blowing from nearby semi-deserts. Average temperatures exceed during summer and in winter. Except at cool mountain elevations, the inland monthly temperatures are warmer than around Melbourne (see chart). Victoria's highest maximum temperature of was recorded in Hopetoun on 7 February 2009, during the 2009 southeastern Australia heat wave. The Victorian Alps in the northeast are the coldest part of Victoria. The Alps are part of the Great Dividing Range mountain system extending east‚Äìwest through the centre of Victoria. Average temperatures are less than in winter and below in the highest parts of the ranges. The state's lowest minimum temperature of was recorded at Omeo on 15 June 1965, and again at Falls Creek on 3 July 1970. Temperature extremes for the state are listed in the table below: Rainfall Victoria is the wettest Australian state after Tasmania. Rainfall in Victoria increases from south to the northeast, with higher averages in areas of high altitude. Mean annual rainfall exceeds in some parts of the northeast but is less than in the Mallee. Rain is heaviest in the Otway Ranges and Gippsland in southern Victoria and in the mountainous northeast. Snow generally falls only in the mountains and hills in the centre of the state. Rain falls most frequently in winter, but summer precipitation is heavier. Rainfall is most reliable in Gippsland and the Western District, making them both leading farming areas. Victoria's highest recorded daily rainfall was at Tidal River in Wilsons Promontory National Park on 23 March 2011. File:Victoria_summer.jpgAverage January maximum temperatures: Victoria's north is almost always hotter than coastal and mountainous areas. File:Victoria_winter.jpgAverage July maximum temperatures: Victoria's hills and ranges are coolest during winter. Snow also falls there. File:Victoria_rainfall.jpgAverage yearly precipitation: Victoria's rainfall is concentrated in the mountainous north-east and coast. Victoria's water system Victoria has undertaken several major construction projects to link state water supplies and to establish a statewide water market in preparation for the privatisation of Victoria's water.D!ssent, Article by Kenneth Davidson \\"Water Lies\\", Issue 31 Summer 09/10 The works included the Wonthaggi desalination plant built on the South Gippsland coastline at Wonthaggi, which was announced in June 2007, at the height of the crippling millennium drought when Melbourne's water storage levels were at 28.4%, a drop of more than 20% from the previous year. Lawmakers and bureaucrats were suddenly grappling with the frightening prospect that the city could run out of water. The cost of the plant was estimated to be more than $3 billion. The plant was completed in December 2012.Desalination Plant : Projects. Melbourne Water. Retrieved on 20 January 2009 Because of the cost of producing water, it is intended to be a backup water source. The merit of the project has been questioned by three reports by the Productivity Commission and the National Water Commission, on the basis of the higher production cost of the plant. The ongoing costs of keeping the plant on standby is $608 million a year. Several pipelines have also been constructed in an effort to link regional systems to facilitate the trading of water. For example, the North‚ÄìSouth Pipeline was completely in February 2010 to carry water from the Goulburn River to Melbourne's Sugarloaf Reservoir in times of need, and an interconnector pipeline connecting the Geelong-Ballarat region. Pricing of water Price to consumers vary nationally. They have been highest in Sydney where water deliveries are provided by Australia's largest utility, Sydney Water. The average quarterly Melbourne water bill has increased by about $150 between 2009 and 2011, largely to pay for the desalination plant.

The Wilderness Society has designated the area as a ‚ÄúMountain Treasure‚Äù. The site contains bogs, springs, and sag ponds created by ancient landslides, the largest slides in the eastern United States, some as long as 3 miles, with a variety of biological communities. The area is part of the Sinking Creek Valley Cluster. Location and access The area is located in the Appalachian Mountains of Southwestern Virginia, about 3 miles south of New Castle, Virginia. Va 42 is on the northwest side of the area and Va 621 is on the southeast. Hall Road, Forest Road 209, follows along the southeast border. There are no official trails in the area. Access can be gained from Earn Knob Road, Forest Road 5021, 4.7 mile long, on the western end of the area, and Enterprise Road, Forest Road 742, 1.9 miles long, on the eastern end. Boundary of the Sinking Creek Mountain wildarea as identified by the Wilderness SocietyThe boundary of the wildland, as determined by the Wilderness Society, is shown in the adjacent map. Additional roads are given on National Geographic Maps 788 (Covington, Alleghany Highlands). A great variety of information, including topographic maps, aerial views, satellite data and weather information, is obtained by selecting the link with the wild land's coordinates in the upper right of this page. Beyond maintained trails, old logging roads can be used to explore the area. The Appalachian Mountains were extensively timbered in the early twentieth century leaving logging roads that are becoming overgrown but still passable. Old logging roads and railroad grades can be located by consulting the historical topographic maps available from the United States Geological Survey (USGS). The Sinking Creek Mountain wildarea is covered by USGS topographic maps Looney, Catawba and Craig Springs. Natural history The area is within the Ridge and Valley Subsection of the Northern Ridge and Valley Section in the Central Appalachian Broadleaf Coniferous Forest-Meadow Province. The northern end of the area contains habitat for species, such as black bear, that require a large land area removed from human activity. The upper part of the mountain ridge, and some isolated draws, contain old growth forest. Prehistoric landslides modified the soils in the area of the slides, creating habitat for evergreen vegetation not found below the slides where deciduous vegetation is more common. And ferns, not common below the slides, are found in swamps and ponds in the area of the slides. Topography The area is dominated by Sinking Creek Mountain, a long ridge, about 3600 feet high, forming the northwestern border of the area. Chimney Rock, with an elevation of 3638 feet, and Earn Knob, at 3600 feet, are prominent points along the ridge. Meadow Creek Falls, on the northern end, has a scenic 500-foot waterfall. The area, part of the James River watershed, drains into Craig Creek which flows north to the James River. Ancient landslides Sinking Creek Landslide, page 1 Sinking Creek Landslide, page 2Large landslides on Sinking Creek Mountain occurred in prehistoric times, probably 10,000 to 20,000 years ago before humans settled the area. Extending over 20 miles on the eastern side of Sinking Creek Mountain, the landslides are some of the largest in the world. Rocks, with a size as large as 1.5 square miles, were carried away by the slide. Some of the rocks moved down the hillside intact, while others broke up during the slide. Evidence of the landslide can be seen while driving along Hall Road, Forest Road 209, on the southeastern border of the area. More information is given by selecting the thumbnails on the left. Forest Service management The Forest Service has conducted a survey of their lands to determine the potential for wilderness designation. Wilderness designation provides a high degree of protection from development. The areas that were found suitable are referred to as inventoried roadless areas. Later a Roadless Rule was adopted that limited road construction in these areas. The rule provides some degree of protection by reducing the negative environmental impact of road construction and thus promoting the conservation of roadless areas. Sinking Creek Mountain was not inventoried in the roadless area review, and therefore not protected from possible road construction and timber sales. The forest service classifies areas under their management by a recreational opportunity setting that informs visitors of the diverse range of opportunities available in the forest. Most of the area is managed as ‚ÄúBlack Bear Habitat‚Äù with ‚ÄúScenic Corridor‚Äù designation on the far eastern side of the area. The Enterprise timber sale, a 65-acre area on the eastern end, was approved in 2002. The Enterprise Road was lengthened by 1.2 miles for the sale, but the new road is now closed to motor vehicles. A powerline, running north to south near the end of Earn Knob Road, bisects the area. Cultural history In 1872 Addison Caldwell, from the community of Sinking Creek, marched 26 miles across Sinking Creek Mountain and Brush Mountain to become the first student at Virginia Tech. The Virginia Tech corps of cadets observes this event with the Caldwell March.

The game was crowdfunded by a successful Kickstarter campaign in April, 2019. An early access version is expected in mid-2020, followed by a full release later in 2020.  Gameplay  The developers describe Prodeus as \\"the first-person shooter of old, re- imagined using modern rendering techniques.\\" The gameplay resembles that of classic 1990s first-person shooters such as Doom and Quake. The player must explore complex levels, sometimes searching out keys to progress, while engaging enemies in fast-paced combat using a variety of weapons. To help the player find their way, and to aid in discovering secrets, the game features an automap similar in function to those featured in games such as Doom, Duke Nukem 3D, and Metroid Prime. Prodeus employs a modern game engine to extend the experience of classic shooters with visuals such as dynamic lighting and particle effects, interactive levels, a gore system, and a dynamic soundtrack. Though the game may be played entirely with modern visuals, the game allows the player to apply shaders that give the game a pixelated look, simulating resolutions down to 360p or even 216p. The game also has the option to dynamically convert enemy and item models to sprites, further simulating a retro experience.  Plot  The player assumes control of a corrupted agent of Prodeus, the mysterious creator of the player and the game world. The only goal is to destroy Prodeus and anything that gets in the way.  Development  Developers Mike Voeller and Jason Mojica met while working together at Raven Software on Singularity. By 2017, Voeller had decided to leave the industry to pursue an idea for a retro first-person shooter (that would become Prodeus). Around that time, Mojica reconnected with Voeller and decided to leave his job at Starbreeze Studios to join the project. Later, the two recruited Andrew Hulshult for the soundtrack and Josh \\"Dragonfly\\" O'Sullivan from the Doom modding community to work on level design. Prodeus was announced in November, 2018. The launch trailer and later gameplay demos were created with a pre-alpha version of the game showcasing a typical level. The developers have stated that community engagement was considered a core principle of the game from the beginning. Thus, Prodeus includes an integrated level editor from day one. Anyone who owns the game on a PC will have the same tools used by the developers to make levels from scratch. The level editor is built specifically for Prodeus and is designed for speed and ease of use.

Their motto was to kill Westerners and Christians in order to preserve Vietnam and Vietnamese Confucian culture. Supporters took issue with the changes occurring in Vietnam because: * Vietnamese society had been stagnating for centuries. The VƒÉn Th√¢n were conservatives who longed to uphold tradition and rejected the new western influence. * The VƒÉn Th√¢n studied only Confucius' teachings and related fields. Their livelihood was tied to Confucianism, thus the new change brought economic hardship to them. The VƒÉn Th√¢n blamed the Emperor and the pacifists of Vietnam for the Treaty of Saigon, which ceded three provinces and one island to the French.  History It started in 1862 following the Treaty of Saigon in which Saigon, the island of Poulo Condor and three southern provinces later known as the Cochinchina colony (Bien Hoa, Gia Dinh, and Dinh Tuong), were ceded to France. Later on, in 1885, it joined the C·∫ßn V∆∞∆°ng movement. However, some reports state that the movement was later expelled from the C·∫ßn V∆∞∆°ng insurgency due to its brutality toward Christians. The VƒÉn Th√¢n Movement is often referred to as the Scholar's Revolt or Scholar's Rebellion. 'VƒÉn' is a word in Sino-Vietnamese that refers to writing or culture and was used to indicate the class of educated individuals who acted in this campaign. 'Th√¢n' is used in various ways to mean \\"dear\\" or to denote something of personal importance.  1864 The VƒÉn Th√¢n boycotted the examination and claimed the Christians were stockpiling weapons, training with them, and forcing people into Christianity. The VƒÉn Th√¢n began plans to kill pacifists, force the emperor to follow their way or be forcefully removed from the throne, kill Christians, then take back ceded territory. The plan was exposed and the leaders were persecuted. Despite this, the rumor that Christians were stockpiling weapons scared the government enough to investigate. Ultimately, no evidence was found from these rumors, and the emperor declared the Christians innocents.Phan Ph√°t Hu·ªìn (1965). Vi·ªát Nam Gi√°o S·ª≠ ‚Äì Quy·ªÉn I (in l·∫ßn th·ª© hai).

History In 1422 the citizens of Enkhuizen received permission from John III, Duke of Bavaria, to tear down the old church of Oostdorp, a village outside the Westfriese Omringdijk (the dyke that protects the area) that had flooded. The new church was dedicated to Pancras of Rome, and building commenced in 1422 or 1423 in a patch of reed. It was reported that the building site had to be raised considerably, and that the walls were as high as the foundation walls were deep. It was mostly finished by 1458; the upper part of the 75-meter tall tower was finished in 1524, but by 1595 the tower was leaning six or seven feet and had to be set straight. Church and tower still dominate the cityscape. The tower is owned by the city of Enkhuizen and was restored and renovated in 1992. One of the church's more notable preachers was Cornelis Cooltuyn, known as the \\"father of the Dutch Reformation\\". He became pastor of the Zuiderkerk in 1555, when Balthazar Platander, still loyal to the Roman-Catholic church, was pastor of the nearby Westerkerk. Cooltuyn's was the larger congregation, but his orthodoxy was questioned and in 1557 he was forced to leave Enkhuizen for Alkmaar. Plans for a reorganization of part of the church were presented in 2012, and in 2014 the expansion was done; it included the reorganization of the space by the Chapel of the Cross, on the north side of the church, and the addition of spaces including a day care and a kitchen. Paintings Biblical scene on the vault Biblical scenes were painted on the vaults in 1484, but after the Reformation they were painted over, in 1609, when the church had been taken over by Protestants. The paintings were uncovered in the 20th century. Pipe organ The organ's oldest parts (fragments of pipes and some of the registers) date from the 16th century, and indicate that at that time there was already an organ present. Work was done on the organ in 1593, and in 1621 it was expanded and changed significantly, and the casing dates from that year as well. The three-register pedal board was built in 1688 by Johannes Duyschot. In 1737 the casing was expanded by Pieter de Nicolo. Organ builder Heinrich Hermann Freytag was in charge of an extensive renovation in 1799. The organ was restored between 1988 and 1990 by Flentrop in Zaandam, which restored the organ to its 1799 condition. Church bells Zuidertoren ca. 1900, from the Torenstraat The two church bells are tuned C0 and A1. The largest, the C, was made by Geert van Wou in 1509, and its inscription reads, SALVATOR IS MYN NAEM * MYN GHELUIT SY GODE BEQUAEM * GERHARDUS DE WOU ME FECIT ANNO DOMINI MCCCCCIX (\\"Salvator is my name; may my sound please the Lord\\"). Originally cast for the city's Westerkerk, it was placed in the Zuiderkerk in 1653, and is connected to the carillon. The smaller bell, the A, was made by Pieter and Fran√ßois Hemony, and is inscribed BENEDICAT TERRA DNM.

Until 1936 this bell alerted citizens in case of fire. =Carillon= The church's carillon was also constructed by the Hemony brothers, and consisted of 52 bells; since then bells have been replaced and added onto. The tuning system is the meantone temperament, which was usual in the 17th century. Of the current 54 bells around 20 date from before 1800. In the beginning of the 20th century a new system to operate the carillon was installed by Royal Eijsbouts bell foundry, which had a keyboard that allowed for more expressive playing with less effort.

After being falsely accused and imprisoned for a 1798 bank robbery, he became a working class hero.Ransom R. Patrick, \\"John Neagle, Portrait Painter, and Pat Lyon, Blacksmith,\\" The Arts Bulletin, vol 33, no. 3 (September 1951), pp. 213-251. (subscription $) A self-made businessman, he was among the foremost American makers of hand-pumped fire engines. Artist John Neagle's portrait of him, Pat Lyon at the Forge (1826‚Äì27), alludes to his unjust imprisonment, and is an iconic work in American art. Biography Lyon and his parents moved to London when he was a child, and he worked in various factories, beginning at about age 10. He emigrated to Philadelphia in November 1793, where he worked as a journeyman, before opening his own business in May 1797.Patrick Lyon, The Narrative of Patrick Lyon, who suffered three Months severe Imprisonment in Philadelphia Gaol, on merely a vague Suspicion of being Concerned in the Robbery of the Bank of Pennsylvania: with his Remarks thereon. Philadelphia: Printed by Francis and Robert Bailey, at Yorick's Head, No. 116, High-Street. 1799. =Bank of Pennsylvania robbery= Carpenters' Hall, Philadelphia Walnut Street Gaol, in a 1799 engraving Prior to 1798, the Bank of Pennsylvania conducted business from an office in Philadelphia's Masonic lodge.Ron Avery, \\"Carpenters' Hall -- America's First Bank Robbery,\\" from ushistory.org Following a robbery attempt at the lodge, the bank signed a lease with Carpenters' Hall, and hired contractor Samuel Robinson to prepare the hall for the bank's operations. Two previous banks had operated out of Carpenters' Hall, while their permanent buildings were under construction. Robinson hired Lyon to create new locks for the vault in the cellar of the hall, and brought the vault's iron doors to Lyon's shop on August 11.Laura Rigal, The American Manufactory: Art, Labor, and the World of Things in Early Republic (Princeton University Press, 2001), pp. 179-203. Lyon completed his work on August 13, and the doors were reinstalled that day. Philadelphia, Pennsylvania served as the temporary capital of the United States from 1790 to 1800. In 1793, one fifth of the city's population had died in a yellow fever epidemic; the disease reappeared in 1797, and again the following summer. In late-August 1798, President John Adams, Congress, and many of the inhabitants abandoned the city. On August 28, Lyon and his 19-year-old assistant Jamie fled Philadelphia by ship to Lewes, Delaware, but Jamie died of yellow fever within two days of their arrival. On the night of August 31/September 1, while much of the city was deserted, the Bank of Pennsylvania's reserves of $162,821 in cash and Spanish gold were stolen from the vault in Carpenters' Hall. There were no signs of thieves having broken into the building, and Lyon's locks on the iron doors were undamaged. Lyon was still in Delaware weeks later where he learned that he was the prime suspect in the robbery, and returned to Philadelphia to clear his name. He met with officers of the bank and the mayor of Philadelphia, but they came away suspecting that Lyon had secretly made an extra set of keys for the robbery. In the midst of the worsening yellow fever epidemic, he was arrested without evidence and thrown into Walnut Street Gaol: \\"Upon the presumption that his locks were so good nobody but himself could open them, he was thrown into prison and there kept for a long time.\\"\\"Old Landmarks in Philadelphia,\\" Scribner's Monthly Magazine, vol. 12, no. 2 (June 1876), p. 165. The robbery turned out to be an inside job. Isaac Davis, a member of the Carpenters' Company, and Thomas Cunningham, the night watchman at Carpenters' Hall, were the only conspirators. Cunningham died of yellow fever within days of the robbery, and Davis came under suspicion after making major deposits into a number of Philadelphia banks (including the Bank of Pennsylvania!). Davis confessed, and was granted a pardon from Pennsylvania's governor in exchange for returning the bank's money. Davis returned all but $2,000, disappeared from Philadelphia, and never served a day in jail. Even after Davis's October 1798 confession, Philadelphia's high constable John Haines would not release Lyon, but reduced his bail from $150,000 to $2,000 (still, more than the blacksmith's net worth). Haines convened a grand jury in January 1799, but it refused to indict Lyon and he was released. Narrative thumb Lyon wrote a narrative about his imprisonment: The Narrative of Patrick Lyon, who suffered three Months severe Imprisonment in Philadelphia Gaol, on merely a vague Suspicion of being Concerned in the Robbery of the Bank of Pennsylvania: with his Remarks thereon (1799). In its introduction, he pleaded for equal justice for rich and poor. The frontispiece of the publication was an engraved portrait by Philadelphia artist James Akin, and showed a 30-year-old Lyon in Walnut Street Prison, incongruously dressed as a gentlemen, seated on a Chippendale chair, and holding a technical drawing and calipers. An 1800 British review of the Narrative was dismissive of Lyon's grammar and writing style, but concluded: > The picture he has drawn of the judicial exercise of justice in > Pennsylvania, as well as of the Police, impartiality, and humanity, of a > Philadelphia prison, well merit the attention of those Britons who are so > forward, on all occasions, to proclaim the blessings of American liberty, to > the disparagement of our own. We must not omit to mention, however, that > Lyon was perfectly innocent as to the crime of which he was suspected.The > Anti-Jacobin Review and Magazine, vol. 5, no. 2 (April 1800), Anti-Jacobin > Press, Peterborough-Court, Fleet Street, London, pp. 556-557. Lawsuit Lyon filed a civil lawsuit for malicious prosecution and false imprisonment against the bank president, the head cashier, a bank board member and High Constable Haines. The case went to trial in July 1805. William Rawle, defense attorney for the bank, freely acknowledged that Lyon had been in southern Delaware, away, at the time of the robbery. But Rawle also repeatedly stressed what an \\"ingenious\\" man Lyon was, implying that he had been the mastermind behind the crime. The jury didn't buy Rawle's argument, found that the bankers and constable had conspired to act with malice toward Lyon, and awarded him $12,000 in damages. The defendants appealed, but settled out of court with Lyon for $9,000 in March 1807, just as a second trial was about to begin. =Fire apparatus= Philadelphia Hose Company, 1804 hose wagon Diligent Fire Engine (1820), in a 1852 lithograph Jayne Building (1848-50), Philadelphia, William L.

Other \\"engine-builders were soon superseded by the famous locksmith, who invented a new and improved fire- engine, which he announced would throw more water than any other, and with a greater force.\\" Lyon's patent for an \\"engine for throwing water\\" was approved on February 12, 1800.Joseph Delaplaine, \\"List of American Patents,\\" The Emporium of Arts and Sciences, Philadelphia, vol. 1, no. 5 (September 1812), p. 392. His design featured a surge tank encased in a square column at the center of the engine, vertical pump cylinders, double decks, and hinged lever bars at the ends. These came to be known as \\"Philadelphia-style hand pumpers,\\" and he built examples for the Good Will and Philadelphia Fire Companies in 1803.John Thomas Scharf and Thompson Westcott, History of Philadelphia, 1609-1884, Volume 3 (Philadelphia: L. H. Everts & Company, 1884), p. 1907. Philadelphia was one of the first American cities to build a gravity-fed municipal water system. In 1802, Frederick Graff \\"designed the first post-type hydrants in the shape of a 'T' with a drinking fountain on one side and a 4-1/2-inch water main on the other.\\"Robert E. Booth, Jr. and Katharine Booth, \\"Folk Art on Fire,\\" catalogue essay, The Philadelphia Antiques Show (2004), p. 89. Initially, these hydrants were used to fill buckets that were passed by a bucket brigade to fill a fire engine's reservoir. In 1804, Lyon invented the first hose wagon, which transported of copper-riveted leather hose to the hydrants. Its bed also could be used as an additional reservoir. The use of hoses eliminated the need for bucket brigades, and allowed 11 men to do the work of 100. A description of Lyon's hose wagon: > It was an oblong box upon wheels, six feet nine inches long by two feet six > inches wide and two feet deep; the hose was carried in the box without a > cylinder.

Lyon built engines for other Philadelphia fire companies - the Pennsylvania, United States, Hand-in-Hand, Good Intent and Washington companies - as well as for fire companies in cities and towns in Pennsylvania and other states. Diligent Fire Engine Lyon's masterpiece was the 1820 engine Diligent, a double-decker, end-stroke hand pumper built for Philadelphia's Diligent Fire Company, and \\"one of the most powerful pumpers in the United States.\\"Diligent Fire Company / Veteran Fireman's Fire Hat, from National Museum of American History. Planks laid over the engine's reservoir created twin upper decks, where eight men pumped (four facing each end), and hinged lever bars that folded down allowed an additional sixteen men (eight at each end) to pump from the ground.George Escol Sellers, \\"Early Engineering Reminiscences,\\" The American Machinist (New York City), vol. 9, no. 22 (May 29, 1886), p. 4. The fire company was so pleased with the engine that they made Lyon a lifetime member. In a May 22, 1852 contest of man-versus-steam, the 32-year-old Diligent competed against the new steam-powered pumper Young America, made in Cincinnati and owned by a Baltimore fire company. Before a crowd of some 50,000, at 3rd & Chestnut Streets, Philadelphia, Diligent and Young America shot streams of water against or over an early skyscraper, the Jayne Building. Diligent was triumphant in all three tasks--shooting a single stream of water to a height of using a 1-inch nozzle; shooting two simultaneous streams to a height of using 3/4-inch nozzles; and shooting four simultaneous streams to a height of using 1/2-inch nozzles.Diligent Fire Engine, from Library Company of Philadelphia. Diligent remained in service until after the Civil War.\\"Firemen's Jubilee: Grand Parade of Firemen in Philadelphia,\\" The New York Times, October 17, 1865.

Lyon lent the portrait to the Boston Athenaeum for an 1828 exhibition, and the club purchased it from him for $400. He then commissioned Neagle to make a second version, which was exhibited at PAFA's 18th annual exhibition in May 1829, a month after Lyon's death: \\"Portrait of the late Patrick Lyon, at the Forge, the second picture of this subject.\\" The second version is slightly larger, Neagle's brushwork is looser, and Lyon's facial expression is sterner. But the only major departure from the original is the addition of a board in the right foreground, to which is nailed a drawing illustrating the Pythagorean theorem. Neagle signed and dated the 1829 portrait above the Pythagorean theorem illustration.

She launched the Florence Eiseman childrenswear business in 1945, which became one of Wisconsin's leading fashion brands. Biography Florence Feinberg was born in Minneapolis on 27 September 1899. Quitting college after a year, she trained as a stenographer before marrying Laurence Eiseman and moving with him to Milwaukee where they had two sons. Soon afterwards, Eiseman saw a doctor about a \\"nervous condition\\" and was advised to find a hobby, which she found in making clothing for her two young sons Laurence Jr. and Robert, and for her friends' children. Meanwhile, Laurence worked as a debt collector and then managed a toy factory, which began failing in 1945, leading him to bring some of his wife's childrenswear to Ann Lehman, the buyer at the Chicago department store Marshall Field's. The subsequent huge order launched the Florence Eiseman business, and Lehman became an important mentor to Florence. With the success of the business, Laurence Eiseman gave up the toy factory to support his wife full-time, and Florence was able to pursue her love of 18th-century Worcester porcelain and modern art, collecting works by Alexander Calder, Henri Matisse, Pablo Picasso, and Jean Dubuffet. Laurence Eiseman died in 1967. Despite her slight build (she was only 4'10 tall) and apparent shy and retiring nature, Eiseman could also be outspoken and direct in business and when dealing with other people. By 1985, Eiseman was largely house-bound due to emphysema and back problems, but remained closely involved with her business, having designs brought to her at home for her approval. She died 9 January 1988, at Columbia Hospital, Milwaukee, of emphysema. Business The Florence Eiseman brand was launched in 1945, and became the \\"leading high-end children's clothing line in the United States.\\" Their first big order came from the Chicago department store Marshall Field's in 1945. The buyer at Marshall Field's, Ann Lehman, became an important figure in Eiseman's life, giving her crucial advice on how to design for children's figures. In 1955, Eiseman was awarded the Neiman Marcus Fashion Award. In 1985, Stanley Marcus said of Eiseman that she had courage in her belief that parents who appreciated good clothes would also wish their children to have good clothing, and that she \\"defined the market.\\" Eiseman's work was known for using A-line silhouettes, pinafores that could be buttoned to the front of dresses, and bold appliqu√© designs. Sarah Eichhorn, curator of the fashion collection at Mount Mary University which holds a number of Eiseman designs, described the designer's work as emphasizing the postwar image of the \\"idyllic, child-centered\\" American nuclear family and changing the perceptions of children from being miniature adults, to being \\"playful and innocent.\\" She designed coordinating and matching outfits for siblings, both brother-and-sister and big-and-little-sister sets, and created classic clothing that was intended to be passed down through the generations. Eiseman also designed clothing specifically for children with disabilities, such as dresses with longer hems that could be worn with crutches and large, easy-to-maneuver buttons. The garments were made to a very high standard using the highest-quality European cottons and linens. In 1988, Carla Slocum, the vice-president of Saks Fifth Avenue, specializing in childrenswear, said that Florence Eiseman had \\"been one of the most influential figures in the children's fashion industry over the last several decades,\\" and credited her with \\"raising the standards of fashion and quality in better children's wear.\\" By 1985, Eiseman had reduced her involvement in the company due to poor health, having a staff of three designers bring their designs to her at home for her final approval. The company had also begun increasingly using fabric blends rather than pure cotton and linen, simplifying appliqu√© designs, and started using computers to store designs and a large plotter for pattern production. The business was run by her sons Laurence Jr.(president) and Robert Eiseman, chief executive officer. At this time, the mid 1980s, the company was at its peak, making sales of about 7 million dollars a year, and employing around 130 people. By 2017, following several bankruptcies and changes of ownership, the business had outsourced production to El Salvador and was employing 20 people including the head designer Teri Shapiro Larson, who, aged 21, came to the company in 1972 straight from the Fashion Institute of Technology, and worked closely with Eiseman up until her death. Notable customers and wearers Among those who wore Florence Eiseman clothing as children in the 20th century were Carrie Fisher, John and Caroline Kennedy, and Princesses Caroline and St√©phanie of Monaco, while Elizabeth Taylor and the Rockefeller family were notable customers. In the 21st century, Beyonc√©'s daughter Blue Ivy wore a Florence Eiseman dress to the second inauguration of Barack Obama, and Katie Holmes's daughter, Suri, has been seen wearing Florence Eiseman designs. During the Obama presidency, the official Presidential baby gifts were specially ordered by Barack and Michelle Obama from Florence Eiseman. These gifts, bearing the Presidential seal and the embroidered signatures of the Obamas, were individually personalized with embroidery of the child recipient's name. Exhibitions In 1964, there was a retrospective of Eiseman's work at the Denver Art Museum. The New York Times commented in 1988 that this was probably the first time that a children's fashion designer had been so honored by a museum retrospective. In 1985 the Milwaukee Art Museum hosted a retrospective of Eiseman's work to mark the 40th anniversary of the business foundation. Another retrospective was hosted by the Museum of Wisconsin Art in 2017, titled \\"Florence Eiseman: Designing Childhood for the American Century.\\" A number of the exhibits came from the collection of Mount Mary University, which holds a large collection of Florence Eiseman pieces as examples of Milwaukee's fashion history and industry. The exhibition was produced in association with the Chipstone Foundation Eiseman clothing is also held by the Costume Institute and the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston.

The peak lies midway between Marblemount and Newhalem and can be seen from the North Cascades Highway at the road pullout for Big Devil Falls. The peak rises 6,600+ feet above the valley floor at this viewing location in the valley floor. Big Devil is the highest peak of Teebone Ridge, and other peaks on this ridge include Little Devil Peak, Fallen Angel, and The Trapezoid. Precipitation runoff from the mountain drains into tributaries of the Skagit River. Climate Big Devil Peak is located in the marine west coast climate zone of western North America.Beckey, Fred W. Cascade Alpine Guide, Climbing and High Routes. Seattle, WA: Mountaineers Books, 2008. Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel northeast toward the Cascade Mountains. As fronts approach the North Cascades, they are forced upward by the peaks of the Cascade Range, causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall onto the Cascades (Orographic lift). As a result, the west side of the North Cascades experiences high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall. During winter months, weather is usually cloudy, but, due to high pressure systems over the Pacific Ocean that intensify during summer months, there is often little or no cloud cover during the summer. Because of maritime influence, snow tends to be wet and heavy, resulting in high avalanche danger. Geology The North Cascades features some of the most rugged topography in the Cascade Range with craggy peaks, spires, ridges, and deep glacial valleys. Geological events occurring many years ago created the diverse topography and drastic elevation changes over the Cascade Range leading to the various climate differences. Big Devil Peak and Big Devil Falls seen from Highway 20 The history of the formation of the Cascade Mountains dates back millions of years ago to the late Eocene Epoch. With the North American Plate overriding the Pacific Plate, episodes of volcanic igneous activity persisted. In addition, small fragments of the oceanic and continental lithosphere called terranes created the North Cascades about 50 million years ago. During the Pleistocene period dating back over two million years ago, glaciation advancing and retreating repeatedly scoured the landscape leaving deposits of rock debris. The \\"U\\"-shaped cross section of the river valleys are a result of recent glaciation. Uplift and faulting in combination with glaciation have been the dominant processes which have created the tall peaks and deep valleys of the North Cascades area.

Overview This road, is intended to ease traffic from Jomo Kenyatta International Airport that accesses Nairobi city center. Also traffic from Central Nairobi is expected to be facilitated, to reduce the number of departing passengers who miss their fights, while stuck in road traffic jams on the city streets. The work involves expansion of the existing road to four-lanes one-way, (8 lanes total), with foot paths, drainage channels, overpass bridges and street lighting. Upgrade and funding The government of Kenya has contracted with China Road and Bridge Corporation (CRBC) to build this toll road on a public-private partnership (PPP) basis. CRBC will use their own money to construct the road expansion, interchanges and toll stations. They will collect the toll fees until their investment is recovered, then the road will revert to government. The road expansion is to be done in stages. The World Bank had indicated interest in funding the road expansion, but those plans have been overtaken by events. The cost of the toll highway is quoted as between KSh51 billion (US$510 million) and KSh65 billion (US$650 million).

After going to primary school in her birthplace, she studied at the Potchefstroom University for Christian Higher Education and in 1941 obtained her Bachelor of Arts in social sciences. In May 1942, she married Dr. D.C.S. van der Merwe, then pastor at the Petrusburg Reformed Church. His full career in the GKSA went as follows: Petrusburg 1941-1944, Vryburg 1944-1950, Windhoek 1950-1957, missionary in Potchefstroom-North 1957-1967, professor Hammanskraal Theological Seminary 1967-1972, Potchefstroom Theological Seminary 1972-1977, and finally Ficksburg Reformed Church 1978-1982. He accepted his emeritus afterward and died on November 10, 1997. In August 1942, her husband was interned for six months in Koffiefontein, but he was granted parole of eight months afterwards which the young couple spent on his family farm. From 1943 to 1950, the Van der Merwes worked in the extended joint congregation of Vryburg-Goeie Hoop. They served in a pivotal time when the church in Vryburg installed an organ and a church building was opened for Goeie Hoop. While in Vryburg, their oldest daughter died in a fire. In 1950, they moved to Windhoek, where they would stay for seven and a half years. Mrs. Van der Merwe began devoting herself to housework and gardening while attending to her five children and month-old baby. Due to the massive size of the congregation in area and the paucity of GKSA pastors in SWA, her husband was often home only a few days a month. She would later report that her body almost cracked under the strain. He found himself working as far afield as the Cape Province and worked as a consultant for two years in northern SWA. She and the sisters of the congregation also helped build the church hall in Windhoek. In 1951, they started the Gereformeerde Sustersbond (\\"GKSA Sisterhood\\") and socially contributed to founding 17 chapters of the Vrouelandbou-unie (VLU, \\"Farm Women's Union\\") throughout SWA. She was chairwoman of the Sisterhood and the executive committee of the VLU, commander of the Suid- Afrikaanse Noodhulpliga (\\"South African First Aid League\\") in SWA, and a PTA member. She worked tirelessly to organize Afrikaner women ecclesiastically and socially. In 1959, Ida Bosman wrote of the Van der Merwes: \\"They left deep tracks in SWA.\\" From June 1957, her husband taught at the missionary school in Potchefstroom, and Annie continued to contribute to the mission there, as she would in Ficksburg from 1978 to 1982. Annie's only sibling was the Rev. Hein Kruger. Willemien le Roux, widow of the Rev. Braam le Roux, recalled Annie van der Merwe in 2017 as \\"an impressive, independent, and loving human being.

A bullet journal is a method of personal organization developed by designer Ryder Carroll. The system organizes scheduling, reminders, to-do lists, brainstorming, and other organizational tasks into a single notebook. The name \\"bullet journal\\" comes from the use of abbreviated bullet points to log information, but it also partially comes from the use of dot journals, which are gridded using dots rather than lines.Sigler, Jennifer Leigh. \\"First Comes Love: Ritual and Domesticity in the Aspirational Leisure-Labor Economy of the 21st Century.\\" Southern Illinois University at Carbondale, 2019. Ann Arbor: Proquest. Web. 20 Nov. 2019. First shared with the public in 2013, it has become a popular method, garnering significant attention on Kickstarter, Instagram, Facebook, YouTube, and Pinterest.  Method  Bullet journals are usually handwritten, and kept in a single notebook. The core tools of a bullet journal are: * an index * rapid logging * logs * collections * migration The index functions like the index to a book, or a table of contents, pointing to where information on different topics is located. Rapid logging uses a system of symbols (e.g. dashes, asterisks, circles, etc.) to simplify, abbreviate, and organize information. These symbols are explained in a key, typically located in the front of the journal. Information can be organized into tasks, events, and notes, but the possibilities are endless. Logs are to-do lists, organized on different time-scales, including daily, weekly, monthly, and future logs. Logs are often called spreads, since they typically spread across two adjacent pages. Collections make up the bulk of a bullet journal, and organize information by content - these can be logs, lists, trackers, etc. Other popular collections include habit and mood trackers, fitness or diet trackers, list of books to read, restaurants to try, etc. Described as the \\"cornerstone\\" of bullet journaling, migration is the practice of periodically updating lists to new lists, such as carrying over unfinished tasks from one month's log to the next. This helps users stay organized, productive, and on task by allowing them to prioritize what things need to get done, and what can be placed on hold. Migration can also refer to the process of moving into a new notebook.  Tools  The method requires only a pen or pencil and a notebook, though many users are more elaborate. Commercially produced notebooks exist that are designed for bullet journaling, but any blank notebook will suffice. Users who focus on the creative element may use a variety of supplies, including a ruler, colored pens and markers, stickers, stencils, washi tape, etc. The bullet journal system provides a framework for users to plan out their lives and increase productivity. Inherent to the bullet journaling system is flexibility - there is plenty of room for users to get creative and customize the system to their needs.  Reception  Proponents describe the bullet journal as both an effective planning method and a \\"creative outlet\\" with a focus on \\"simplicity and clarity.\\" Good Housekeeping described it as \\"equal parts day planner, diary and written meditation.\\"  Styles  Since the introduction of the original bullet journal method, the online community has morphed the bullet journal into all different styles: minimalistic, artsy, doodle, super-organized, and scrapbook, to name a few. What differentiates styles is how elaborate pages are, whether that's in terms of content or appearance, or in how the user approaches the system. For example, the bullet journal may be used for its functionality, organization, or as an outlet for creativity. Digital bullet journaling has also become popular, especially in the online community. Although bullet journaling is traditionally done with pen and paper, many users have created digital bullet journals using a variety of note-taking apps or apps designed specifically for digital bullet journaling. Although the method is the same, there are a few reasons users prefer digital over paper, including: * greater ease of customization - no need to buy various writing supplies; * back up and sync feature - allowing users to bring it wherever they have an electronic device; * built-in search function - easier to find information; * audio recording feature - many note-taking apps have this feature, which can add another dimension to note-taking; * paper use reduction - saving money and reducing environmental impact.  Uses  A bullet journal, or bullet journaling, is a creative way to schedule your day, week, month, or year. A bullet journal is also used to keep track of what you have done or what you haven't. = School = Many students have taken up bullet journaling to help them succeed in all levels of school - high school, college, graduate etc. On YouTube, there are many \\"study with me\\" videos, which feature YouTubers studying, as well as sharing tips, tricks, and favorite supplies. Closely related are studygrams, which are Instagram accounts dedicated to studying and taking effective, organized and aesthetically pleasing notes. Bullet journaling has been featured in many of these videos as a way to get organized and stay productive in school. In 2019, Study with Me: Effective Bullet Journaling Techniques, Habits, and Hacks To Be Successful, Productive, and Organized - With Special Strategies for Mathematics, Science, History, Languages, and More by Jasmine Shao and Alyssa Jagan was published.

Additionally, a bullet journal can be a designated outlet to work through strong emotions or difficult times.  History  Ryder Carroll began looking for a simple method of personal organization in college in the late 1990s. Diagnosed with attention deficit disorder as a child, he wanted a system to help \\"move past his learning disabilities.\\" By the time he graduated from college, he had devised the bullet journal method. A friend encouraged him to share his method, and he began sharing it online in 2013. It attracted attention on social media, earning $80,000 in Kickstarter funding to create a centralized online community of users. It was the subject of over 3 million Instagram posts by December 2018. The method has been influenced by Carroll's experience as an app, web, and game designer, as well as by his interest in scrapbooking. Carroll gave a TED talk about bullet journaling at the 2017 TEDxYale event, titled \\"How to declutter your mind - keep a journal.\\" Carroll also published a book on the system, The Bullet Journal Method, in 2018.  Economic impact  Since the introduction of bullet journaling, its growing popularity has contributed to an increase in sales of traditional stationery products, such as notebooks, pens, etc. As of 2018, there was an 18% increase in the sale of notebooks in the US compared to the year before. There was also an increase ranging from 5% to 17% in the sale of various types of pens.

Jewish Interpreter: (Top L) Julius Meyer Frank F. Courier May 1875 President Ulysses S. Grant sympathized with the plight of Native Americans and believed that the original occupants of the land were worthy of study. During the 19th Century, the term \\"Indian\\" was used to describe Native peoples of America. Grant's Inauguration Address set the tone for the Grant administration Native American Peace policy. The Board of Indian Commissioners was created to make reforms in Native policy and to ensure Native tribes received federal help. Grant lobbied the United States Congress to ensure that Native peoples would receive adequate funding. The hallmark of the Grant's Peace policy was the incorporation of religious groups that served on Native agencies, which were dispersed throughout the United States. Grant was the first President of the United States to appoint a Native American, Ely S. Parker, as the Commissioner of Indian Affairs. After the Piegan massacre, in 1870, military officers were barred from holding elected or appointed offices. During Grant's first term, American Indian Wars decreased. By his second term, his Peace policy fell apart. Settlers demanded to invade Native land to get access to gold in the Black Hills. The Modoc War (1872‚Äì1873) and the Battle of the Little Bighorn (1876), were detrimental to Grant's goal of Native assimilation to European American culture and society. Historians admire Grant's sincere efforts to improve Native relations in the United States but remain critical of the destruction of American bison herds, which served as a tribal food supply. Native American culture was destroyed in order to engineer the Cultural assimilation of Native Americans into citizenship, and European American culture and government. Detrimental to his Peace policy was religious agency infighting in addition to Parker's resignation in 1871. Grant's intentions of peacefully \\"civilizing\\" Natives were often in conflict with the nation's westward settlement, the pursuit of gold, the Long Depression (1873-1896), financial corruption, racism, and ranchers. The driving force behind the Peace policy and Native land displacement, was the American ideal of Manifest Destiny. First term (1869‚Äì1873) President Grant Mathew Brady 1870 President Grant declared in his March 4, 1869, Inaugural Address: Grant believed that the Native practice of free roam hunting and gathering was over. During Grant's presidency the \\"civilization\\" of Indians was a controversial issue. Grant was the first President to advocate the cause of Native Americans in an Inaugural Address. Grant was well aware that Americans were generally hostile to Native peoples. Grant's promise to reform the nation's Native American policy surprised the nation. Three weeks into his administration, Grant met with religious leaders and philanthropists to discuss his new program. Grant said he desired to create a \\"humane and Christianizing policy towards the Indians.\\" The New York Herald said that Grant planned \\"to make a radical change in the Indian policy of the government.\\" Wendell Phillips, a civil rights advocate, thanked Grant for launching a new Native policy. The Leavenworth Bulletin, hostile to Grant's Peace initiative, said: \\"If more men are to be scalped and their hearts boiled, we hope to God that it may be some of our Quaker Indian Agents.\\" Unlike many of his military subordinates, Grant blamed frontier Native violence on the white settlement, and supported a Peace Commission rather than wage a \\"campaign against Indians.\\" Soon after Grant took office, he met with tribal chiefs of the Choctaw, Creek, Cherokee, and Chickasaw nations who expressed interest to teach \\"wild\\" Natives outside their own settled districts farming skills. Grant told the Native chiefs that American settlement would lead to inevitable conflict, but that the \\"march to civilization\\" would lead to pacification. At the core of the Peace Policy was to put the western reservations under the control of religious denominations. During his first term, the implementation of the policy involved the allotting of Indian reservations to religious organizations as exclusive religious domains. Of the 73 agencies assigned, the Methodists received fourteen; the Orthodox Friends ten; the Presbyterians nine; the Episcopalians eight; the Roman Catholics seven; the Hicksite Friends six; the Baptists five; the Dutch Reformed five; the Congregationalists three; Christians two; Unitarians two; American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions one; and Lutherans one. Infighting between competitive missionary groups over the distribution of agencies was detrimental to Grant's Peace Policy. The selection criteria were vague and some critics saw the Peace Policy as violating Native American freedom of religion.Francis Paul Prucha, American Indian Policy in Crisis, Christian Reformers and the Indian, 1865‚Äì1900 (2014) pp. 30‚Äì71. =Board of Indian Commissioners 1869= On April 10, 1869, Grant signed into law the Board of Indian Commissioners. There was resistance toward its passage because Congressional patronage power over appointments would be reduced. The act gave President Grant the power to create a board of Commissioners \\"eminent for their intelligence and philanthropy.\\" Grant was determined to put in public service-minded men, not subject to being influenced by patronage, that had previously plagued the Indian Bureau. Grant secured $2,000,000 more in the annual appropriation to make sure that Board would be funded adequately and be successful. Grant invited Protestant religious groups that included Methodists, Presbyterians, Episcopalians, Congregationalists, and Quakers to nominate agents to work with the Native tribes. To bypass legal concerns regarding the separation between church and state, Grant refused to ask his Attorney General Hoar for a legal opinion on the matter. On May 27, 1869, representatives of religious denominations met with Grant and approved of his Board appointments, who were mandated by the law to inspect Indian Bureau records, to personally visit tribes, evaluate the treaty system, and to supervise Indian purchases. On July 3, 1869, Grant authorized by executive order the Indian Board to \\"have full power to inspect in person or by a subcommittee, the various Indian Superintendencies, and Agencies in the Indian Country.\\" The Grant Board was given extensive joint-power to supervise the Bureau of Indian Affairs and \\"civilize\\" Native Americans. No Natives were appointed to the committee, whose members were all white. The commission monitored purchases and began to inspect Native agencies. It attributed much of the Native wars to the encroachment of whites into Native lands. The board, however, approved of the destruction of Native culture to be replaced by European American culture. The Natives were to be instructed in Christianity, agriculture, representative government, and assimilated on reservations. In December 1869, Grant gave his first annual message to Congress, and he mentioned findings and recommendations of the new Indian Commissioners board. Concerning Native wars, Grant said that he \\"did not hold, either legislation or the conduct of the whites who come most in contact with the Indian, blameless for these hostilities.\\" Grant thought that the extinction of the Natives would be horrible. Grant said that a policy \\"which looks to the extinction of a race is too abhorant [sic] for a Nation to indulge in without entailing upon the wrath of all civilized Christendom.\\" There was an edgy sense of optimism in Grant's outlook for Native Americans. =Appointment of Parker 1869= Ely S. Parker Donehogawa On April 13, 1869, in a bold step, Grant appointed his aide General Ely S. Parker, Donehogawa, the first Native American Commissioner of Indian Affairs. Parker was Grant's military secretary during the Civil War. Parker, who was a full Seneca Native, received racial prejudice opposition in the Senate to his nomination. However, Grant's Attorney General Hoar said Parker was legally able to hold office. Grant believed that the Native American, when educated, could work within white society in a modern America, and Parker served as Grant's role model. The Senate confirmed Parker by a vote of 36 to 12. During Parker's tenor Native wars dropped by 43 from 101 in 1869 to 58 in 1870. The management of Native affairs was delegated by Grant to Secretary of Interior Jacob D. Cox and Parker. Parker authorized the Indian Board Commissioners to meet with Native peoples and their agents during the summer and fall. The Bureau under Parker employed more than six hundred workers. A total of seventy agents were under the control of fifteen superintendents. William Welsh, a prominent merchant, and former chairman of the Board of Indian Commissioners launched a personal campaign against Commissioner of Indian Affairs Parker to remove him from office, possibly motivated by racial animus. Welsh was allowed by Congress to prosecute the Bureau in a Congressional investigation over alleged Bureau malfeasance. Although Parker was exonerated, legislation passed Congress that authorized the board to approve goods and services payments by vouchers from the Bureau. Parker refused to abide by the voucher legislation and resigned office in 1871. Parker viewed the new law made the office of Commissioner a \\"clerk\\" to the board. Grant replaced Parker with reformer Francis A. Walker. =Peigan massacre 1870= On January 23, 1870, the Grant administration's Peace Policy had a major setback when Major Edward M. Baker senselessly slaughtered 173 Piegan members, mostly women, and children. General Sheridan had ordered Baker to attack the Piegan warriors who raided European American settlements. In response, Baker attacked a Native village in Northern Montana on the Marias River. Gruesome details slowly emerged of the carnage: 30 Native warriors and 140 women and children were butchered outright. Philanthropist newspapers decried the violence. The New York Times said Baker's war was a \\"sickening slaughter,\\" while the New York Tribune said the attack was a \\"national disgrace.\\" Worse yet, the National Anti-Slavery Society blamed one of Grant's top generals, Sheridan, for starting the fight. Additionally, public outcry increased when General Sheridan defended Baker's actions. On July 15, 1870, Grant signed Congressional legislation that barred military officers from holding either elected or appointed office or suffer dismissal from the Army. In December 1870, Grant submitted to Congress the names of the new appointees, most of whom were confirmed by the Senate.Utley 1984a, pp. 127‚Äì133.Prucha 1984, pp. 501‚Äì503. =Appropriations Acts 1870, 1871= Red Cloud Ma»üp√≠ya L√∫ta Grant's Peace policy received a boost when Chief of the Oglala Sioux Red Cloud, Ma»üp√≠ya L√∫ta, and Brul√© Sioux Spotted Tail, Si≈ãt√© Gle≈°k√°, arrived in Washington D.C. and met Grant at the White House for a bountiful state dinner on May 7, 1870. Red Cloud, at a previous meeting with Secretary Cox and Commissioner Parker, complained that promised rations and arms for hunting had not been delivered. Afterward, Grant and Cox lobbied Congress for the promised supplies and rations. Congress responded by passing the Indian Appropriations Act, which appropriated the tribal monies, and Grant signed it into law on July 15, 1870. Two days after Spotted Tail urged the Grant administration to keep white settlers from invading Native reservation land, Grant ordered all Generals in the West to \\"keep intruders off by military force if necessary\\". In 1871, Grant signed another Indian Appropriations Act that ended the governmental policy of treating tribes as independent sovereign nations. Natives would be treated as individuals or wards of the state and Indian policies would be legislated by Congressional statutes. =Camp Grant massacre 1871= In 1871, Grant's Indian peace policy, enforced and coordinated by Brig. Gen. George Stoneman in Arizona, required the Apache to be put on reservations where they would receive supplies and agriculture education. The Apache slipped out and occasionally raided white settlers. In one raid, believed to have been conducted by Apache warriors, settlers and mail runners were murdered near Tuscan, Arizona. The townspeople traced this raid to Apache reservation from Camp Grant. 500 Apache lived at the Camp Grant near Dudleyville. Angered over the murders, the Tucson townspeople hired 92 Papago Indians, 42 Mexicans, and 6 whites to take revenge on the Apache. When the war party reached Camp Grant on April 30, they murdered 144 Apaches, mostly women, and children, in what became known as the Camp Grant Massacre. Twenty-seven captured Apache children were sold into Mexican slavery. In May, an attempt was made by a small federal military party to capture Apache leader Cochise; during the chase, they killed 13 Apache. Grant immediately removed Stoneman of his command in Arizona. =Modoc War 1872= Two weeks after Grant was elected President for a second term his Native American peace policy was challenged. The Modoc people are a Native tribe who at that time lived by Lake Tule near the Oregon-California border. An earlier 1864 treaty removed the Modocs from their tribal lands, which were handed over to ranchers who coveted the grasslands for their favorable conditions. The Modocs were driven from Lake Tule and relocated 25 miles north and forced to live with the Klamath peoples on the Klamath Reservation. Dissatisfied with their living situation, the Modocs, led by Captain Jack, rushed back to their original land. On November 27, the U.S. Army was ordered to force the Modocs back to the Klamath Reservation. On November 28, U.S. Army Captain James Jackson, with 40 troops, reinforced by citizens, went after the Modocs. On November 29, fighting broke out between Jackson's troop-citizen army and the Modocs at the Battle of Lost River near the California-Oregon border, marking the beginning of the Modoc War. Jackson managed to drive the Modocs from their camp, but Hooker Jim and a small band of warriors escaped and killed 18 white settlers. The Modocs fled to a strong defensive position called Stronghold, located in lava beds. On January 17, 1873, the U.S. Army attacked the Modocs at Stronghold, but were repulsed by the Modocs, under the cover of fog and rock formations. Second term (1873‚Äì1877) Grant's Peace policy unraveled during his second term in office. Under Grant's Peace policy, Wars between settlers, the federal army, and Natives had been decreasing from 101 per year in 1869 to a low of 15 per year in 1875, into Grant's second term. However, the Modoc War, the discovery of gold in the Black Hills of the Dakota Territory, and the completion of the Northern Pacific Railway, threatened to unravel Grant's Indian policy, as white settlers encroached upon native land to mine for gold. Major General Edward Canby was killed in the Modoc War. Indian wars per year jumped up to 32 in 1876 and remained at 43 in 1877. One of the highest casualty Indian battles that took place in American history was at the Battle of Little Bighorn in 1876. Indian war casualties in Montana went from 5 in 1875, to 613 in 1876 and 436 in 1877. =Modoc War 1873= Major General Edward Canby killed at a Modoc war peace conference. Grant desired to end the Modoc War peacefully, that had started in November 1872. Grant ordered General Sherman not to attack the Indians, held up at Stronghold, but to settle matters by a commission. Sherman then sent Major General Edward Canby to quell the Native uprising. During the peace negotiations between Brig. Gen. Edward Canby and the Modoc tribal leaders, there were more Indians in the tent then had been agreed upon. Canby had been warned of duplicity among the Modocs, but he held the conference anyway. As the Indians grew more hostile, Captain Jack, said \\"I talk no more.\\" and shouted \\"All ready.\\" Captain Jack drew his revolver and fired directly into the head of Canby and killed him. Canby was the highest-ranking officer to be killed during the Indian Wars that took place from 1850 to 1890. Reverend Eleazar Thomas, a Methodist minister, was also killed, Alfred B. Meacham, an Indian Agent, was severely wounded. The murders shocked the nation, and Sherman wired to have the Modocs exterminated. Grant, however, overruled Sherman and said he wanted only those involved in Canby's assassination to be punished, rather than the whole tribe. On April 15, 1873, the U.S. Army attacked the Modocs held up in Stronghold, however, the fighting was inconclusive and the Modocs escaped. On April 26, the U.S. Army stationed at Sand Butte was attacked by 22 Modocs. On May 10, the Modocs attacked the U.S. Army again at Dry Lake, but this time the battle ended in a decisive U.S. Army victory, and the Modocs finally surrendered. The Modoc warriors who murdered Canby were imprisoned and put on trial and the whole Modoc tribe was rounded up. Meacham, who survived the massacre, defended the indicted Modocs. Captain Jack was found guilty and executed, and the remaining 155 Modocs were relocated to the Quapaw Agency in the Indian Territory. This episode and the Great Sioux War undermined public confidence in Grant's peace policy, according to historian Robert M. Utley.Utley 1984b, p. 206. =Red River War 1874‚Äì1875= After the 1870 invention of a new method to tan buffalo hides the supply of Plains Natives buffalo was decimated by commercial buffalo hunters.Cronon, William. \\"Nature's Metropolis\\". W. W. Norton & Company, 1992, p. 216 The buffalo slaughter was detrimental to the Native peoples, their religion, and their nomadic lifestyle. With diminished buffalo herds the Plains Natives had no means of survival and independence. In 1874, the Red River War erupted on the southern Plains when Quanah Parker, leader of the Comanche, led 700 tribal warriors and attacked the buffalo hunter supply base on the Canadian River, at Adobe Walls, Texas. The Army under General Phil Sheridan launched a military campaign, and, with few casualties on either side, forced the Indians back to their reservations by destroying their horses and winter food supplies. Grant, who agreed to the Army plan advocated by Generals William T. Sherman and Phil Sheridan, imprisoned 74 insurgents in Florida.Smith (2001), Grant, pp. 536‚Äì538; =Great Sioux War 1876‚Äì1877= Custer's Last Charge Seifert Gugler & Co. 1876 In 1874 gold had been discovered in the Black Hills in the Dakota Territory. White speculators and settlers rushed in droves seeking riches mining gold on land reserved for the Sioux tribe by the Treaty of Fort Laramie of 1868. In 1875, to avoid conflict Grant met with Red Cloud, chief of the Sioux and offered $25,000 from the government to purchase the land. The offer was declined. On November 3, 1875, at a White House meeting, Phil Sheridan told the President that the Army was overstretched and could not defend the Sioux tribe from the settlers; Grant ordered Sheridan to round up the Sioux and put them on the reservation. Sheridan used a strategy of convergence, using Army columns to force the Sioux onto the reservation. On June 25, 1876, one of these columns, led by Colonel George A. Custer met the Sioux at the Battle of Little Big Horn and part of his command was slaughtered. Approximately 253 federal soldiers and civilians were killed compared to 40 Indians. Custer's death and the Battle of Little Big Horn shocked the nation. Sheridan avenged Custer, pacified the northern Plains, and put the defeated Sioux on the reservation. On August 15, 1876, President Grant signed a proviso giving the Sioux nation $1,000,000 in rations, while the Sioux relinquished all rights to the Black Hills, except for a 40-mile land tract west of the 103rd meridian. On August 28, a seven-man committee, appointed by Grant, gave additional harsh stipulations for the Sioux in order to receive government assistance. Halfbreeds and \\"squaw men\\" (A white man with an Indian wife) were banished from the Sioux reservation. To receive the government rations, the Indians had to work the land. Reluctantly, on September 20, the Indian leaders, whose people were starving, agreed to the committee's demands and signed the agreement.Gray (1976), pp. 260‚Äì263 During the Great Sioux War, Grant came into conflict with Col. George Armstrong Custer after he testified in 1876 about corruption in the War Department under Secretary William W. Belknap (see below). Grant had Custer arrested for breach of military protocol in Chicago and barred him from leading an upcoming campaign against the Sioux. Grant finally relented and let Custer fight under Brig. Gen. Alfred Terry. Two months after Custer's death Grant castigated him in the press, saying \\"I regard Custer's massacre as a sacrifice of troops, brought on by Custer himself, that was wholly unnecessary ‚Äì wholly unnecessary.\\" As the nation was shocked by the death of Custer, Grant's peace policy became militaristic; Congress appropriated funds for 2,500 more troops, two more forts were constructed, the army took over the Indian agencies and Indians were barred from purchasing rifles and ammunition. Buffalo destruction American Bison or Buffalo Central to the Grant administration Peace policy was allowing the destruction of the buffalo, the Native food supply, to keep Native peoples dependent on government supplies. In 1872, around two thousand white buffalo hunters working between Kansas, and Arkansas were killing buffalo for their hides by the many thousands. The demand was for boots for European armies, or machine belts attached to steam engines. Acres of land were dedicated solely for drying the hides of the slaughtered buffalo. Native Americans protested at the \\"wanton destruction\\" of their food supply. Between 1872 in 1874, the buffalo herd south of the Platte River yielded 4.4 million kills by white hunters, and about 1 million animals killed by Indians. Richard White, The Republic for which it Stands (2017) p 296. Popular concern for the destruction of the buffalo mounted, and a bill in Congress was passed, HR 921, that would have made buffalo hunting illegally for whites. Taking advice from Secretary Delano, Grant chose to pocket-veto the bill, believing that the demise of the buffalo would reduce Indian wars and force tribes to stay on their respected reservations and to adopt an agricultural lifestyle rather than roaming the plains and hunting buffalo.Kennedy (2001), \\"The Last Buffalo\\" Ranchers wanted the buffalo gone to open pasture land for their cattle herds. With the buffalo food supply lowered, Native Americans were forced to stay on reservations. Historical reputation and evaluation Historian Robert M. Utley (1984) contended that Grant, as a pragmatist, saw no inconsistencies with dividing up Native American posts among religious leaders and military officers. He added that Grant's \\"Quaker Policy\\", despite having good intentions, failed to solve the real dilemma of the misunderstandings between \\"the motivations, purposes, and ways of thinking\\" between both White and Native American cultures. These inconsistencies were evident in the breakdown of peace negotiations between the U.S. military and the Modoc tribal leaders during the Modoc War from 1872 to 1873.Utley 1984a, pp. 127‚Äì133.Prucha 1984, pp. 501‚Äì503. Historian Robert E. Ficken points out that the peace policy involved assimilation with the Indians practically forced to engage in farming, rather than hunting, even though much of the reservation land was too barren for farming. The policy also led to boarding schools that have come under intense criticism since the late 20th century. Critics, in addition, note that reformers called for \\"allotment\\" (the breakup of an entire reservation so the land would be owned in individual blocks by individual families, who could then resell it to non-Indians) without considering whether it would be beneficial. Ficken concludes that Grant's policy \\"contained the seeds for its own failure.\\"Robert E. Ficken, \\"After the Treaties: Administering Pacific Northwest Indian Reservations.\\" Oregon Historical Quarterly 106.3 (2005): 442‚Äì461. Historian Cary Collins says Grant's \\"Peace Policy,\\" failed in the Pacific Northwest chiefly because of sectarian competition and the priority placed on proselytizing by the religious denominations.Cary C. Collins, \\"A Fall From Grace: Sectarianism And The Grant Peace Policy In Western Washington Territory, 1869‚Äì1882,\\" Pacific Northwest Forum (1995) 8#2 pp 55‚Äì77. Historian Robert Keller surveying the Peace policy as a whole concludes that Grant's policy was terminated in 1882, and resulted in \\"cultural destruction [of] the majority of Indians.\\"Robert H. Keller, American Protestantism and United States Indian Policy, 1869‚Äì82 (U of Nebraska Press, 1983) p 155. Congressional reaction to the losses suffered by Lt. Col. George Armstrong Custer's unit at the Battle of the Little Big Horn in 1876 was shock and dismay at the failure of the Peace Policy. Grant blamed Custer wholly for the defeat stating that the sacrifice of troops was unnecessary. The Indian appropriations measure of August 1876 marked the end of Grant's Peace Policy. The Sioux were given the choice of either selling their lands in the Black Hills for cash or not receiving government gifts of food and other supplies.

After suffering persecution during the Cultural Revolution, she moved to the United States before settling in Singapore. Following the release of two acclaimed albums in her old age, she was rediscovered by Chinese music lovers and became a social media sensation in her 80s.  Early life  Mario Paci (second row centre) with his colleagues and students in Shanghai, 1945. In the front row are two of his youngest students: Wu Yili (front right) and Fou Ts'ong (front left). Wu was born in 1931 into a prominent family in Shanghai, Republic of China, with her ancestral home in Heyuan, Guangdong province. Her father Wu Zhenying () was a US-educated architect, and her mother Li Huiying () was the daughter of , a wealthy capitalist who helped finance Sun Yat-sen's revolution. At age six, Wu heard Fr√©d√©ric Chopin's Fantaisie-Impromptu from an American movie, and became determined to learn to play the piano. She won the first prize in Shanghai Children's Piano Contest after playing for only a year, and began studying with the Shanghai-based Italian musician Mario Paci at the age of ten. She graduated from Shanghai Peicheng Girls' School ().  Career in China  Wu made her public debut at the Shanghai Lyceum Theatre in 1948. Her performance of Beethoven's Piano Concerto No. 1, accompanied by Shanghai Symphony Orchestra, made her famous in China. In 1954, she joined the China National Symphony Orchestra (then called the Central Philharmonic Orchestra) in Beijing, and became its first solo pianist a year later. She married Yang Bingsun (), the lead violinist of the orchestra. Recognized as one of China's top pianists, she frequently performed for foreign leaders visiting China and went on tours abroad. After the debut of the Butterfly Lovers' Violin Concerto in 1959, Wu was the first to make a piano arrangement for the work, and the first to perform it at the celebration of the 10th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China that year. It was one of the most famous performances of her career. She was personally received by Premier Zhou Enlai in 1962. During the Cultural Revolution (1966‚Äì1976), Yang Bingsun was denounced as a \\"counter-revolutionary\\" and imprisoned for ten years. Wu was forced to divorce him in order not to be implicated, but was still beaten by the Red Guards and suffered long-term injuries in her feet.  Singapore and later life  After the end of the Cultural Revolution, Wu moved to the United States in the 1980s, before settling in Singapore in 1993. In Singapore, Wu taught piano and lived in relative poverty and obscurity. With the financial support of one of her students, she released her first album in 2008 at the age of 77, followed by the second five years later. Both albums were highly acclaimed, and she was praised for her expressiveness and her extensive knowledge of Chinese music. Her second album won the 2013 Top 10 Records award of Guangdong Musicians' Association. She also publicised the music of her native Guangdong province, including arranging Yule Shengping (). In 2017, a video of the 86-year-old pianist playing the Butterfly Lovers became popular on Chinese social media, and Wu was rediscovered by music lovers in China. She gave a public performance in Singapore that year and was honoured with the World Outstanding Chinese Artist Award in June. In 2018, she collaborated with L√º Siqing, one of China's most renowned violinists, in a new rendition of the Butterfly Lovers, which was broadcast on China Central Television. Wu died on 20 April 2019 at Singapore General Hospital, after losing consciousness while attending a concert at the Victoria Theatre and Concert Hall. She was 88.

The building was designed by Swiss architects Le Corbusier and Pierre Jeanneret.  Building  The Pavillon was conceived of as a modular dwelling that could be combined with others like it to form a larger block. The building measured and utilized an open plan. A lower floor held living spaces and a kitchen while a second floor held bedrooms and a bathroom. In designing the building, Le Corbusier and Jeanneret aesthetically and ideologically diverged from the Art Deco style which dominated the exhibition. The architects, viewing architecture as too removed from human needs, emphasized function and sought to drastically diminish decoration. In order to reduce the need for decorative furniture, Le Corbusier and Jeanneret included a myriad of built-in-furniture including cabinets and shelves. The pavilion also included several cubist sculptures by Jacques Lipchitz, one of which was placed on the grass in front of the building.

The Henties Bay Reformed Church broke away in 2006, but the Walvis Bay pastor continues to handle it concurrently. Walvis Bay's membership was 267 in 2015, more or less evenly split between Walvis Bay and Swakopmund. Services are held in both towns every Sunday. Walvis Bay started as a district of the Usakos Reformed Church, founded in 1953 as a likely offshoot of the Windhoek Reformed Church. Until 1955, services in Walvis Bay were held in the Freemasons' lodge and later in the courthouse, members' houses, and the Emma Hoogenhout Primary School meeting hall. The district acquired two plots of land from the city government for ¬£1. A construction fund was founded with money from the Usakos church council. On October 27, 1956, the area of Walvis Bay, Swakopmund, and Henties Bay was given its own congregation, draining so many members from the Usakos congregation that the latter dissolved four years after. In 1960, the young congregation hired Jac H. van Zanten as architect and J. Eisenberg as contractor. In 1961, a third of the church building was completed, including the pews and communion altar, and 40 chairs had been purchased. After fundraising and a contribution from a Rev. Bos from the Netherlands, the building was finished according to the original plan in 1970. The Rev. Bos also contributed the pulpit. On November 8, 2009, the around 100 GKSA worshipers in Swakopmund began to use their own church building. The Sola Gratia church is built atop a flat wing of the local Dutch Reformed Church in South Africa (NGK), which had to use the same building at the time.  The Rev. Schutte's tenure  The Rev. Hendrik Willem (Hennie) Schutte was invested in his first congregation, the Walvis Bay Reformed Church, on January 15, 1995, shortly after his graduation in 1994. Shortly before moving to Namibia, he married his childhood sweetheart, Sandra Koorsen of Bloemfontein. The services were rather unique in that each Sunday morning, 2 services were held, one in Walvis Bay at 9:00 AM and one in Swakopmund at 11:00 AM. After his Walvis Bay service, he needed to travel 40 km to Swakopmund on the busy B1 road. This road was nicknamed the \\"road of death\\" due to a high accident rate. On Sunday, May 21, 1995, a fine service in Walvis Bay was followed by the usual coffee klatch of the worshipers with the Schuttes before they left for Swakopmund. It was only 2 weeks after the congregation camp, and everyone was still abuzz over how well the new pastor and his wife had fit in to their new post. That day around 10:25 AM, and barely 3 km out of Walvis Bay in an area known as \\"the long turn,\\" a vehicle hit their car where Sandra was sitting. Both the other car's occupants died instantly, but so did Sandra. The Rev. Schutte was admitted to the local hospital in critical condition and transferred to intensive care in Bloemfontein, where both his parents and in- laws waited in a month-long vigil for his recovery. Sandra was laid to rest on May 29, 1995 in the cemetery of her parents' congregation, the Berg en Dal Church of the Bloemheuwel Reformed Church (NGK), by its Rev. Hubrecht van Dalsen. Nadat hy in so ‚Äòn mate herstel het dat hy sy bedieningswerk kon voortsit, keer ds. Hennie laat in 1995 terug na Walvisbaai en bedien die gemeente met baie se√´n en toewyding tot in 2001, toe hy ‚Äòn beroep na GK Pretoria-Wes aanvaar. After his full recovery, the Rev. Schutte returned to continue officiating for the congregation until 2001, when he left for a post at the Pretoria-East Reformed Church, followed in 2007 by a stint between the De Aar, Strydenburg, and Oranjerivier Reformed Churches, where he worked until 2010. From 2010 to 2012, he worked at the Noord-Oosrand Reformed Church, and since 2012 he has served the Wesrand Reformed Church.

He later completed a fellowship in surgery at Harborview Medical Center. Mock became board certified in surgery in 1989, and surgical critical care in 1992, both by the American Board of Surgery. He earned a Master's in Public Health in 1994 from University of Washington and his PhD in epidemiology, also from the University of Washington, in 1997.  Career  In 2005, Charles Mock was named the Director of the Harborview Injury Prevention Research Center (HIPRC) at the University of Washington in Seattle, stating that his three goals for the center were: to support the work already being done by the researchers there, to be more involved with local communities and governments to employ proven injury- control strategies, and to increase the Center's international reach. Mock held a joint appointment at UW as Professor in the Department of Surgery at the School of Medicine and Professor in the Department of Epidemiology at the School of Public Health. While at UW, Mock co-edited Guidelines for Essential Trauma Care, published by the World Health Organization in 2004. In March 2007, Mock relocated to serve as a medical officer in the Department of Violence and Injury Prevention at the World Health Organization, and was in charge of developing the WHO's activities on emergency trauma care and burn prevention/treatment. His responsibilities also included pre-hospital care and the development of the trauma and emergency care services network. Mock has served as the Chair of the Working Group for Essential Trauma Care of the International Society of Surgery (a Society collaboration with the WHO), seeking to improve the care of injured patients. He has also served on the American College of Surgeons Committee on Trauma.

In late 1841 the Daoguang Emperor discovered that his officials in Canton and Amoy had been sending him embellished reports. He ordered the governor of Guangxi, Liang Chang-ch√º, to send him clear accounts of the events in Canton, noting that since Guangxi was a neighboring province, Liang must be receiving independent accounts. He warned Liang that he would be able to verify his information by obtaining secret inquiries from other places.Waley 1958, p. 73 Yishan was recalled to the capital and faced trial by the imperial court, which removed him from command.

Background Moral reasoning has been the focus of most study of morality dating all the way back to Plato and Aristotle. The emotive side of morality has been looked upon with disdain, as subservient to the higher, rational, moral reasoning, with scholars like Piaget and Kohlberg touting moral reasoning as the key forefront of morality. However, in the last 30‚Äì40 years, there has been a rise in a new front of research: moral emotions as the basis for moral behavior. This development began with a focus on empathy and guilt, but has since moved on to encompass new emotional scholarship on emotions such as anger, shame, disgust, awe, and elevation. With the new research, theorists have begun to question whether moral emotions might hold a larger role in determining morality, one that might even surpass that of moral reasoning. Definitions There have generally been two approaches taken by philosophers to define moral emotion. The first \\"is to specify the formal conditions that make a moral statement (e.g., that is prescriptive, that it is universal, such as expedience)\\". This first approach is more tied to language and the definitions we give to a moral emotions. The second approach \\"is to specify the material conditions of a moral issue, for example, that moral rules and judgments 'must bear on the interest or welfare either of society as a whole or at least of persons other than the judge or agent'\\". This definition seems to be more action based. It focuses on the outcome of a moral emotion. The second definition is more preferred because it is not tied to language and therefore can be applied to prelinguistic children and animals. Moral emotions are \\"emotions that are linked to the interests or welfare either of society as a whole or at least of persons other than the judge or agent.\\" Types of moral emotion There is a debate whether there is a set of basic emotions or if there are \\"scripts or set of components that can be mixed and matched, allowing for a very large number of possible emotions\\". Even those arguing for a basic set acknowledge that there are variants of each emotion (psychologist Paul Ekman calls these variants \\"families\\"). According to Jonathan Haidt: Haidt would suggest that the higher the emotionality of a moral agent, the more likely the agent is to act morally. He uses the term \\"disinterested elicitor\\" to describe an event or situation that provokes emotions in us even when these emotions do not have anything to do with our own personal welfare. It is these elicitors that cause people to participate in what he calls \\"prosocial action tendencies\\" (actions that benefit society). Haidt explains moral emotions as \\"emotion families\\", in which each family contains emotions that may be similar although not exactly the same. These moral emotions are provoked by eliciting events that often lead to prosocial action tendencies. Each person's likelihood of prosocial action is determined by his or her degree of emotionality. According to Haidt, there are four different moral emotion families: the \\"other-condemning emotions\\" (contempt, anger, disgust), the \\"self-conscience emotions\\" (shame, embarrassment, and guilt), the \\"other suffering emotions\\" (compassion and sympathy), and the \\"other-praising family\\" (gratitude, awe, and elevation). These emotions are moral emotions based on grounds that they can all lead to prosocial action tendencies. Moral emotions and behavior Empathy also plays a large role in altruism. The empathy-altruism hypothesis states that feelings of empathy for another leads to an altruistic motivation to help that person. In contrast, there may also be an egoistic motivation to help someone in need. This is the Hullian tension-reduction model in which personal distress caused by another in need leads the person to help in order to alleviate their own discomfort. Batson, Klein, Highberger, and Shaw conducted experiments where they manipulated people through the use of empathy-induced altruism to make decisions that required them to show partiality to one individual over another. The first experiment involved a participant from each group to choose someone to experience a positive or negative task. These groups included a non-communication, communication/low-empathy, and communication/high-empathy. They were asked to make their decisions based on these standards resulting in the communication/high-empathy group showing more partiality in the experiment than the other groups due to being successfully manipulated emotionally. Those individuals who they successfully manipulated reported that despite feeling compelled in the moment to show partiality, they still felt they had made the more \\"immoral\\" decision since they followed an empathy-based emotion rather than adhering to a justice perspective of morality. Batson, Klein, Highberger, & Shaw conducted two experiments on empathy-induced altruism, proposing that this can lead to actions that violate the justice principle. The second experiment operated similarly to the first using low-empathy and high-empathy groups. Participants were faced with the decision to move an ostensibly ill child to an \\"immediate help\\" group versus leaving her on a waiting list after listening to her emotionally-driven interview describing her condition and the life it has left her to lead. Those who were in the high-empathy group were more likely than those in the low- empathy group to move the child higher up the list to receive treatment earlier. When these participants were asked what the more moral choice was, they agreed that the more moral choice would have been to not move this child ahead of the list at the expense of the other children. In this case, it is evident that when empathy induced altruism is at odds with what is seen as moral, oftentimes empathy induced altruism has the ability to win out over morality. Recently neuroscientist Jean Decety, drawing on empirical research in evolutionary theory, developmental psychology, social neuroscience, and psychopathy, argued that empathy and morality are neither systematically opposed to one another, nor inevitably complementary. Emmons (2009) defines gratitude as a natural emotional reaction and a universal tendency to respond positively to another's benevolence. Gratitude is motivating and leads to what Emmons' describes as \\"upstream reciprocity\\". This is the passing on of benefits to third parties instead of returning benefits to one's benefactors (Emmons, 2009). In the context of social networking behavior, research from Brady, Wills, Jost, Tucker, and Van Bavel (2017) shows that the expression of moral emotion amplifies the extent to which moral and political ideals are disseminated in social media platforms. Analyzing a large sample of Twitter communications on polarizing issues, such as gun control, same-sex marriage, and climate change, results indicated that the presence of moral-emotional language in messages increased their transmission by approximately 20% per word, compared to purely-moral and purely-emotional language.

The goal of assisted evolution is to help species adapt to a changing environment more quickly than they would via natural selection. Assisted evolution can be used to increase food production and crop yield, as well as ensure targeted species to more quickly become resistant to existential threats. Assisted evolution has been practiced for thousands of years, often for commercial and business purposes. Assisted evolution has come into the public eye in recent years for noncommercial purposes such as species conservation. Assisted evolution for noncommercial purposes is most notably practiced in the attempt to save coral reefs from rising global ocean temperatures and other climate change related environmental conditions.  History  = Commercial purposes = Assisted evolution has been practiced for thousands of years for commercial and business purposes. Selective breeding of Asian wolves over 30,000 years ago by hunter-gatherers have allowed for the creation of modern breeds such as the German Shepherd, which are used often for disability assistance, search-and-rescue, and police and military roles. Plant breeding has also benefitted from Rapid Generation Advance (RGA) and single-seed descent to speed up the process of natural selection. Assisted evolution in plants have allowed for increased food production and reduced pesticide use, yielding a decrease in global poverty and malnutrition. Most recently, assisted evolution is being used to breed animals with a higher muscle or fat content, as well as have a higher resistance to harmful bacteria and other pathogens. = Non-commercialpurposes = Assisted evolution for non-commercial purposes was famously used by Gregor Mendel, who discovered the presence of genes and alleles, as well as their impact on an offspring's genotype. Assisted evolution has come into the public eye for noncommercial purposes such as conservation in recent years. Assisted evolution for noncommercial purposes is most notably practiced in the attempt to save coral reefs from rising ocean temperatures. Assisted evolution is believed to be a temporary solution to save many threatened species from global warming and other climate change related environmental changes.  Types  = Stress conditioning = Stress conditioning consists of exposing organisms to sublethal stress, with the goal of inducing physiological changes that increase tolerance to future stress events. There has been documented evidence that some changes can be passed throughout generations in both plants and animals. Stress conditioning can be artificially induced in a laboratory environment to create desired responses based on their environments. Notable examples include a 1989 experiment which used stress conditioning via heat shock on rat kidneys to extend their safe cold storage time to 48 hours. More recently, stress conditioning is being studied as a potential solution for the preservation of coral reefs as they are continually exposed to ocean warming and acidification. = Assisted gene flow (AGF) = Assisted gene flow (AGF) works to increase the presence of desired naturally-occurring genes in offspring. AGF relies on pre-existing genes within the species‚Äô genome, rather than the artificial creation and insertion of genetic code within the genome of the species. Assisted gene flow can also introduce related species‚Äô genomes into the gene pool to allow for the introduction of previously impossible behaviors into the new species. Assisted gene flow identifies genes that produce desired behaviors, and works to increase the chance that parental transmission of the gene in question occurs (also known as heritability). Determining which genes within the genome produce desired behaviors consist of experiments which measure the growth, survival, and behavior exhibition of offspring with varying genotypes. Assisted gene flow is being utilized as a solution to preserve species who are threatened by climate change. Currently, different colonies of the Great Barrier Reef are being interbred to test whether offspring display increased resistance to warmer living conditions. Increased resistance to warmer living conditions allow for the preservation of the Great Barrier Reef even as water temperatures continue to rise. = Hybridization = Hybridization refers to the process where an egg and sperm from two different species can fertilize and produce young. Hybridization was studied in the 1800s by Johann Gregor Mendel, who posthumously has been credited with the discovery of genes and alleles and their impact on an offspring's genotype. Benefits of hybridization include the increase in genetic diversity and the potential for genetic combinations which are able to adapt to, and reproduce in, increasingly difficult environments. Hybridization of coral reefs during the annual coral spawning is being experimented with to create hybrid offspring that will hopefully have higher survival and growth rates in a variety of climate change related conditions.

Since the database server does not receive the accurate location information, a set including the satisfying solution would be sent back to the user. General privacy requirements include K-anonymity, maximum area, and minimum area.  Background  With the emergence and popularity of location-based services, people are getting more personalized services, such as getting the names and locations of nearby restaurants and gas stations. Receiving these services requires users to send their positions either directly or indirectly to the service provider. A user's location information could be shared more than 5000 times in two weeks. Therefore, this convenience also exposes users‚Äô privacy to certain risks, since the attackers may illegally identify the users‚Äô locations and even further exploit their personal information. Continuously tracking users' location has not only been identified as a technical issue, but also a privacy concern as well. It has been realized that Quasi-identifiers, which refer to a set of information attributes, can be used to re-identify the user when linked with some external information. For example, the social security number could be used to identify a specific user by adversaries, and the combined disclosure of birth date, zip code, and gender can uniquely identify a user. Thus, multiple solutions have been proposed to preserve and enhance users‚Äô privacy when using location-based services. Among all the proposed mechanisms, spatial cloaking is one of those which has been widely accepted and revised, thus having been integrated into many practical applications.  Location privacy  Location privacy is usually considered falling into the category of information privacy, though there is little consensus on the definition of location privacy. There are often three aspects of location information: identity, location(spatial information), and time(temporal information). Identity usually refers to a user's name, email address, or any characteristic which makes a user distinguishable. For example, Pok√©mon Go requires a consistent user identity, since users are required to log in. Spatial information is considered as the main approach to determine a location. Temporal information can be separated into real-time and non-real time and is usually described as a time stamp with a place. If a link is established between them, then the location privacy is considered violated. Accessing personal location data has been raised as a severe privacy concern, even with personal permission. Therefore, privacy- aware management of location information has been identified as an essential challenge, which is designed to provide privacy protection against abuse of location information. The overall idea of preserving location privacy is to introduce enough noise and quantization to reduce the chances of successful attacks. In recent years, researchers have been making a connection between social aspects and technological aspects regarding location information. For example, if co-location information is considered as the data which potential attackers would get and take into consideration, the location privacy is decreased by more than 60%. Also, by a constant report of a user's location information, a movement profile could be constructed for this specific user based on statistical analysis, and a large amount of information could be exploited and generated from this profile such as user's office location, medical records, financial status, and political views. Therefore, more and more researchers have taken account of the social influence in their algorithms, since this socially networked information is accessible to the public and might be used by potential attackers.  History  In order to meet user's requirements for location privacy in the process of data transportation, researchers have been exploring and investigating models to address the disclosure of private information. The secure-multi-party model is constructed based on the idea of sharing accurate information among n parties. Each party has access to a particular segment of the precise information and at the same time being prevented from acquiring the other shares of the data. However, the computation problem is introduced in the process, since a large amount of data processing is required to satisfy the requirement. The minimal information sharing model is introduced to use cryptographic techniques to perform join and intersection operations. However, the inflexibility of this model to fit into other queries makes it hard to be satisfying to most practical applications. The untrusted third-party model is adopted in peer-to- peer environments. The most popular model right now is the trusted third-party model. Some of the practical applications have already adopted the idea of a trusted third party into their services to preserve privacy. For example, Anonymizer is integrated into various websites, which could give anonymous surfing service to its users. Also, when purchasing through PayPal, users are not required to provide their credit card information. Therefore, by introducing a trusted-third-party, users‚Äô private information is not directly exposed to the service providers.  Approaches for preserving location information  The promising approach of preserving location privacy is to report data on users' behavior and at the same time protect identity and location privacy. Several methods have been investigated to enhance the performances of location-preserving techniques, such as location perturbation and the report of landmark objects. = Location perturbation = The idea of location perturbation is to replace the exact location information with a coarser grained spatial range, and thus uncertainty would be introduced when the adversaries try to match the user to either a known location identity or external observation of location identity. Location perturbation is usually satisfied by using spatial cloaking, temporal cloaking, or location obfuscation. Spatial and temporal cloaking refers to the wrong or imprecise location and time reported to the service providers, instead of the exact information. For example, location privacy could be enhanced by increasing the time between location reports, since higher report frequencies makes reidentification more possible to happen through data mining. There are other cases when the report of location information is delayed until the visit of K users is identified in that region. However, this approach could affect the service reported by the service providers since the data they received are not accurate. The accuracy and timelessness issues are usually discussed in this approach. Also, some attacks have been recognized based on the idea of cloaking and break user privacy. = Landmark objects = Based on the idea of landmark objects, a particular landmark or a significant object is reported to the service provider, instead of a region. = Avoid location tracking = In order to avoid location tracking, usually less or no location information would be reported to the service provider. For example, when requesting weather, a zip code instead of a tracked location would be accurate enough for the quality of the service received.  Environment  = Centralized scheme = A centralized scheme is constructed based on a central location anonymizer (anonymizing server) and is considered as an intermediate between the user and the service provider. Generally, the responsibilities of a location anonymizer include tracking users' exact location, blurring user specific location information into cloaked areas and communicate with the service provider. For example, one of the methods to achieve this is by replacing the correct network addresses with fake-IDs before the information are forward to the service provider. Sometimes user identity is hidden, while still allowing the service provider to authenticate the user and possibly charge the user for the service. These steps are usually achieved through spatial cloaking or path confusion. Except in some cases where the correct location information are sent for high service quality, the exact location information or temporal information are usually modified to preserve user privacy. Serving as an intermediate between the user and location-based server, location anonymizer generally conducts the following activities: * Receiving users‚Äô exact location information and private profile * Blurring the location into cloaked areas based on the specific privacy requirements * In most of the times, removing user identities from the location information * Reporting the cloaked area to the service provider and receiving a list of solutions, which is referred to as a candidate list, from the service provider which satisfies user's requests * Deciding the most appropriate solution based on the user's exact location and returning the accurate solution information back to the user ( Some location anonymizer may not adopt this step) The location anonymizer could also be considered as a trusted-third party since it is trusted by the user with the accurate location information and private profile stored in the location anonymizer. However, this could also expose users‚Äô privacy into great risks at the same time. First, since the anonymizer keeps tracking users' information and has access to the users‚Äô exact location and profile information, it is usually the target of most attackers and thus under higher risks Second, the extent to which users trust the location anonymizers could be essential. If a fully trusted third party is integrated into the algorithm, user location information would be reported continuously to the location anonymizer, which may cause privacy issues if the anonymizer is compromised. Third, the location anonymizer may lead to a performance bottleneck when a large number of requests are presented and required to be cloaked. This is because the location anonymizer is responsible for maintaining the number of users in a region in order to provide an acceptable level of service quality. = Distributed scheme (decentralized scheme) = In a distributed environment, users anonymize their location information through fixed communication infrastructures, such as base stations. Usually, a certification server is introduced in a distributed scheme where users are registered. Before participating in this system, users are required to obtain a certificate which means that they are trusted. Therefore, every time after user request a location-based service and before the exact location information is forward to the server, the auxiliary users registered in this system collaborate to hide the precise location of the user. The number of assistant users involved in cloaking this region is based on K-anonymity, which is usually set be the specific user. In the cases where there are not enough users nearby, S-proximity is generally adopted to generate a high number of paired user identities and location information for the actual user to be indistinguishable in the specific area. The other profiles and location information sent to the service provider are sometimes also referred to as dummies. However, the complexity of the data structure which is used to anonymize the location could result in difficulties when applying this mechanism to highly dynamic location-based mobile applications. Also, the issue of large computation and communication is posed to the environment. = Peer-to-peer environment = A peer-to-peer (P2P) environment relies on the direct communication and information exchange between devices in a community where users could only communicate through P2P multi-hop routing without fixed communication infrastructures. The P2P environment aims to extend the scope of cellular coverage in a sparse environment. In this environment, peers have to trust each other and work together, since their location information would be reported to each other when a cloaked area is constructed to achieve the desired K-anonymity during the requesting for location-based services. Researchers have been discussing some privacy requirements and security requirements which would make the privacy-preserving techniques appropriate for the peer-to-peer environment. For example, authentication and authorization are required to secure and identify the user and thus making authorized users distinguishable from unauthorized users. Confidentiality and integrity make sure that only those who are authorized have access to the data transmitted between peers, and the transmitted information cannot be modified. Some of the drawbacks identified in a peer-to-peer environment are the communication costs, not enough users and threats of potential malicious users hiding in the community. = Mobile environments = Mobile devices have been considered as an essential tool for communication, and mobile computing has thus become a research interest in recent years. From online purchase to online banking, mobile devices have frequently been connected to service providers for online activities, and at the same time sending and receiving information. Generally, mobile users can receive very personal services from anywhere at any time through location-based services. In mobile devices, Global Positioning System(GPS) is the most commonly used component to provide location information. Besides that, Global System for Mobile Communications(GSM) and WiFi signals could also help with estimating locations. There are generally two types of privacy concerns in mobile environments, data privacy and contextual privacy. Usually, location privacy and identity privacy are included in the discussion of contextual privacy in a mobile environment, while the data transferred between various mobile devices is discussed under data privacy. In the process of requesting location-based services and exchanging location data, both the quality of data transferred and the safety of information exchanged could be potentially exposed to malicious people.  Privacy requirements  No matter what the specific privacy-preserving solution is integrated to cloak a particular region in which the service requester stays. It is usually constructed from several angles to satisfy different privacy requirements better. These standards are either adjusted by the users or are decided by the application designers. Some of the privacy parameters include K-anonymity, entropy, minimum area, and maximum area. = K-anonymity = The concept of K-anonymity was first introduced in relational data privacy to guarantee the usefulness of the data and the privacy of users, when data holders want to release their data. K-anonymity usually refers to the requirement that the information of the user should be indistinguishable from a minimum of k-1 people in the same region, with k being any real number. Thus, the disclosed location scope would be expected to keep expanding until kusers could be identified in the region and these kpeople form an anonymity set. Usually, the higher the K-anonymity, the stricter the requirements, the higher the level of anonymity. If K-anonymity is satisfied, then the possibility of identifying the exact user would be around 1/k which subjects to different algorithms, and therefore the location privacy would be effectively preserved. Usually, if the cloaking region is designed to be more significant when the algorithm is constructed, the chances of identifying the exact service requester would be much lower even thought the precise location of the user is exposed to the service providers, let alone the attackers' abilities to run complex machine learning or advanced analysis techniques. Some approaches have also been discussed to introduce more ambiguity to the system, such as historical K-anonymity, p-sensitivity, and l-diversity. The idea of historical K-anonymity is proposed to guarantee the moving objects by making sure that there are at least k-1 users who share the same historical requests, which requires the anonymizer to track not only the current movement of the user but also the sequence location of the user. Therefore, even user's historical location points are disclosed, the adversaries could not distinguish the specific user from a group of potential users. P-sensitivity is used to ensure that the critical attributes such as the identity information have at least pdifferent values within kusers. Moreover, l-diversity aims to guarantee the user is unidentifiable from l different physical locations. However, setting a large K value would also requires additional spatial and temporal cloaking which leads to a low resolution of information, which in turn could lead to degraded quality of service. = Minimum area size = Minimum area size refers to the smallest region expanded from the exact location point which satisfies the specific privacy requirements. Usually, the higher the privacy requirements, the bigger the area is required to increase the complicity of distinguishing the exact location of users. Also, the idea of minimum area is particularly important in dense areas when K-anonymity might not be efficient to provide the guaranteed privacy-preserving performance. For example, if the requestor is in a shopping mall which has a promising discount, there might be a lot of people around him or her, and thus this could be considered a very dense environment. Under such a situation, a large K-anonymity such as L=100 would only correspond to a small region, since it does not require a large area to include 100 people near the user. This might result in an inefficient cloaked area since the space where the user could potentially reside is smaller compared with the situation of the same level of K-anonymity, yet people are more scattered from each other. = Maximum area size = Since there is a tradeoff relationship between quality of service and privacy requirements in most location-based services, sometimes a maximum area size is also required. This is because a sizable cloaked area might introduce too much inaccuracy to the service received by the user, since increasing the reported cloaked area also increases the possible satisfying results to the user's request. These solutions would match the specific requirements of the user, yet are not necessarily applicable to the users‚Äô exact location.  Applications  The cloaked region generated by the method of spatial cloaking could fit into multiple environments, such as snapshot location, continuous location, spatial networks, and wireless sensor networks. Sometimes, the algorithms which generate a cloaked area are designed to fit into various frameworks without changing the original coordinate. In fact, with the specification of the algorithms and well-establishment of most generally adopted mechanisms, more privacy-preserving techniques are designed specifically for the desired environment to fit into different privacy requirements better. = Geosocial applications = Geosocial applications are generally designed to provide a social interaction based on location information. Some of the services include collaborative network services and games, discount coupons, local friend recommendation for dining and shopping, and social rendezvous. For example, Motion Based allows users to share exercise path with others. Foursquare was one of the earliest location-based applications to enable location sharing among friends. Moreover, SCVNGR was a location-based platform where users could earn points by going to places. Despite the privacy requirements such as K-anonymity, maximum area size, and minimum area size, there are other requirements regarding the privacy preserved in geosocial applications. For example, location and user unlinkability require that the service provider should not be able to identify the user who conducts the same request twice or the correspondence between a given cloaked area and its real-time location. Also, the location data privacy requires that the service provider should not have access to the content of data in a specific location. For example, LoX is mainly designed to satisfy these privacy requirements of geosocial applications. = Location-based services = With the popularity and development of global positioning system (GPS) and wireless communication, location-based information services have been in high growth in recent years. It has already been developed and deployed in both the academia and the practical sphere. Many practical applications have integrated the idea and techniques of location-based services, such as mobile social networks, finding places of interest(POI), augmented reality(AR) games, awareness of location- based advertising, transportation service, location tracking, and location- aware services. These services usually require the service providers to analyze the received location information based on their algorithms and a database to come up with an optimum solution, and then report it back to the requesting user. Usually, the location-based services are requested either through snapshot queries or continuous queries. Snapshot queries generally require the report of an exact location at a specific time, such as ‚Äúwhere is the nearest gas station?‚Äù while continuous queries need the tracking of location during a period of time, such as ‚Äúconstantly reporting the nearby gas stations.‚Äù With the advancement of global positioning systems and the development of wireless communication which are introduced in the extensive use of location-based applications, high risks have been placed on user privacy. Both the service providers and users are under the dangers of being attacked and information being abused. It has been reported that some GPS devices have been used to exploit personal information and stalk personal locations. Sometimes, only reporting location information would already indicate much private information. One of the attacks specific to location- based services is the space or time correlated inference attacks, in which the visited location is correlated with the particular time, and this could lead to the disclosure of private life and private business. Some of the popular location-based services include: * Location-aware emergency service * Location-based advertisement * Live traffic report * Location-based store finders * Map and navigation system Continuous location-based service Continuous location-based services require a constant report of location information to the service providers. During the process of requesting a continuous location-based service, pressure has been recognized on privacy leakage issues. Since the a series of cloaked areas are reported, with the advancing technological performances, a correlation could be generated between the blurred regions. Therefore, many types of research have been conducted addressing the location privacy issues in continuous location-based services. Snapshot location-based services While snapshot location generally refers to the linear relation between the specific location point and a point in the temporal coordinate. Some mechanisms have been proposed to either address the privacy-preserving issues in both of the two environments simultaneously or concentrate on fulfilling each privacy requirement respectively. For example, a privacy grid called a dynamic grid system is proposed to fit into both snapshot and continuous location-based service environments.  Other privacy mechanisms  The existing privacy solutions generally fall into two categories: data privacy and context privacy. Besides addressing the issues in location privacy, these mechanisms might be applied to other scenarios. For example, tools such as cryptography, anonymity, obfuscation and caching have been proposed, discussed, and tested to better preserve user privacy. These mechanisms usually try to solve location privacy issues from different angles and thus fit into different situations. * Cryptography *Anonymity *Obfuscation *Caching *Pseudonymous technique  Concerns  Even though the effectiveness of spatial cloaking has been widely accepted and the idea of spatial cloaking has been integrated into multiple designs, there are still some concerns towards it. First, the two schemes of spatial cloaking both have their limitations. For example, in the centralized scheme, although users' other private information including identity has been cloaked, the location itself would be able to release sensitive information, especially when a specific user requests service for multiple times with the same pseudonym. In a decentralized scheme, there are issues with large computation and not enough peers in a region. Second, the ability of attackers requires a more in-depth consideration and investigation according to the advancement of technology such as machine learning and its connection with social relations, particularly the share of information online. Third, the credibility of a trusted-third-party has also been identified as one of the issues. There is a large number of software published on app markets every day, and some of them have not undergone a strict examination. Software bugs, configuration errors at the trusted-third-party and malicious administrators could expose private user data under high risks. Based on a study from 2010, two-thirds of all the trusted-third-party applications in the Android market are considered to be suspicious towards sensitive information. Fourth, location privacy has been recognized as a personalized requirement and is sensitive to various contexts. Customizing privacy parameters has been exploring in recent years since different people have different expectations on the amount of privacy preserved and sometimes the default settings do not fully satisfy user needs. Considering that there is often a trade-off relation between privacy and personalization and personalization usually leads to better service, people would have different preferences. In the situations where users can change the default configurations, accepting the default instead of customizing seems to be a more popular choice. Also, people's attitudes towards disclosing their location information could vary based on the service's usefulness, privacy safeguards, and the disclosed quantity etc. In most situations, people are weighing the price of privacy sharing and the benefits they received. Fifth, there are many protection mechanism proposed in literature yet few of them have been practically integrated into commercial applications. Since there is little analysis regarding the implementation of location privacy-preserving mechanisms, there is still a large gap between theory and privacy. = Attack = During the process of exchanging data, the three main parties‚Äîthe user, the server, and the networks‚Äîcan be attacked by adversaries. The knowledge held by adversaries which could be used to carry out location attacks includes observed location information, precise location information, and context knowledge. The techniques of machine learning and big data have also led to an emerging trend in location privacy, and the popularity of smart devices has led to an increasing number of attacks. Some of the adopted approaches include the virus, the Trojan applications, and several cyber-attacks. * Man-in-the- middle attack Man-in-the-middle attacks usually occur in the mobile environment which assumes that all the information going through the transferring process from user to the service provider could be under attacks and might be manipulated further by attackers revealing more personal information. * Cross-service attack Cross-servicing attacks usually take place when users are using poorly protected wireless connectivity, especially in public places. * Video-based attack Video-based attacks are more prevalent in mobile devices usually due to the use of Bluetooth, camera, and video capacities, since there are malicious software applications secretly recording users‚Äô behavior data and reporting that information to a remote device. Stealthy Video Capture is one of the intentionally designed applications which spies an unconscious user and further report the information. * Sensor sniffing attack Sensor sniffing attacks usually refer to the cases where intentionally designed applications are installed on a device. Under this situation, even adversaries do not have physical contact with the mobile device, users‚Äô personal information would still under risks of being disclosed. * Context linking attack In a localization attack, contextual knowledge is combined with observed location information to disclose a precise location. The contextual knowledge can also be combined with precise location information to carry out identity attacks. * Machine/deep learning attack Integrating learning algorithms and other deep learning methods are posing a huge challenge to location privacy, along with the massive amount of data online. For example, current deep learning methods can come up with predictions about geolocations based on the personal photos from social networks and performs types of object detection based on their abilities to analyze millions of photos and videos.  Regulations and policies  Policy approaches have also been discussed in recent years which intend to revise relevant guidelines or propose new regulations to better manage location-based service applications. The current technology state does not have a sufficiently aligned policies and legal environment, and there are efforts from both academia and industry trying to address this issue. Two uniformly accepted and well- established requirements are the users' awareness of location privacy policies in a specific service and their consents of sending their personal location to a service provider. Besides these two approaches, researchers have also been focusing on guarding the app markets, since an insecure app market would expose unaware users to several privacy risks. For example, there have been identified much malware in the Android app market, which are designed to carry cyber attacks on Android devices. Without effective and clear guidelines to regulate location information, it would generate both ethical and lawful problems. Therefore, many guidelines have been discussed in years recently, to monitor the use of location information. = European data protection guideline = European data protection guideline was recently revised to include and specify the privacy of an individual's data and personally identifiable information (PIIs). These adjustments intend to make a safe yet effective service environment. Specifically, location privacy is enhanced by making sure that the users are fully aware and consented on the location information which would be sent to the service providers. Another important adjustment is that a complete responsibility would be given to the service providers when users‚Äô private information is being processed. = European Union's Directive = The European Union's Directive 95/46/EC on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data specifies that the limited data transfer to non-EU countries which are with \\"an adequate level of privacy protection\\". The notion of explicit consent is also introduced in the Directive, which stated that except for legal and contractual purpose, personal data might only be processed if the user has unambiguously given his or her consent. European Union's Directive 2002/58/EC on privacy and electronic communication explicitly defines location information, user consent requirements and corporate disposal requirement which helps to regulate and protect European citizens' location privacy. Under the situation when data are unlinkable to the user, the legal frameworks such as the EU Directive has no restriction on the collection of anonymous data. = The electronic communications privacy act of 1986 = The electronic communications privacy act discusses the legal framework of privacy protection and gives standards of law enforcement access to electronic records and communications. It is also very influential in deciding electronic surveillance issues. = Global system for mobile communication association (GSMA) = GSMA published a new privacy guideline, and some mobile companies in Europe have signed it and started to implement it so that users would have a better understanding of the information recorded and analyzed when using location-based services. Also, GSMA has recommended the operating companies to inform their customers about people who have access to the users‚Äô private information.  Cases  = Corporate examples= Even though many privacy preserving mechanisms have not been integrated into common use due to effectiveness, efficiency, and practicality, some location-based service providers have started to address privacy issues in their applications. For example, Twitter enables its users to customize location accuracy. Locations posted in Glympse will automatically expire. Also, SocialRadar allows its users to choose to be anonymous or invisible when using this application.  Google It has been stated that Google does not meet the European Union‚Äôs data privacy law and thus increasing attention has been placed on the advocation of guidelines and policies regarding data privacy.  Facebook It has been arguing that less than a week after Facebook uses its ‚ÄúPlaces‚Äù feature, the content of that location information has been exploited by thieves and are used to conduct a home invasion. = Court cases =  United States v. Knotts case In this case, the police used a beeper to keep track of the suspect's vehicle. After using the beeper alone to track the suspect, the officers secured a search warrant and confirmed that the suspect was producing illicit drugs in the van. The suspect tried to suppress the evidence based on the tracking device used during the monitoring process, but the court denied this. The court concluded that ‚ÄúA person traveling in an automobile on a public thouroughfare[] has no reasonable expectation of privacy in his movement from one place to another.‚Äù Nevertheless, the court reserved the discussion of whether twenty-four-hour surveillance would constitute a search. However, the cases using GPS and other tracking devices are different with this case, since GPS tracking can be conducted without human interaction, while the beeper is considered as a method to increase police's sensory perception through maintaining visual contact of the suspect. Police presence is required when using beepers yet is not needed when using GPS to conduct surveillance. Therefore, law enforcement agents are required to secure a warrant before obtaining vehicle's location information with the GPS tracking devices.  United States v. Jones  In this case(https://www.oyez.org/cases/2011/10-1259), the police had a search warrant to install Global Positioning System on a respondent wife's car, while the actual installation was on the 11th day in Maryland, instead of the authorized installation district and beyond the approved ten days. The District Court ruled that the data recorded on public roads admissible since the respondent Jones had no reasonable exception of privacy in public streets, yet the D.C. Circuit reversed this through the violation of the Fourth Amendment of unwarranted use of GPS device. = Practical applications =  Popular culture  * In George Orwell's novel 1984, a world where everyone being watched is depicted, practically at all time and places. * Br√∏nn√∏ysund Register Center(https://www.brreg.no) in Norway provides a free public register service, where people can register and specify that they do not want to receive direct marketing, or sale phone calls or mails.

Biography  He was the son of a merchant and entrepreneur of Scottish origin. He began by studying business, but decided that he would rather be a painter. In pursuit of that goal, he went to Europe in 1877 and enrolled at the Academy of Fine Arts, Munich. In 1881, he continued his studies in Paris at the Acad√©mie Julian. Biography @ the Telfair Academy. There, he met George Hitchcock and Gari Melchers, who would become his lifelong friend. Both had already made plans to work in the Netherlands. He followed them there in 1884 and settled in Egmond aan Zee, where he would live for three years and many times thereafter, until the beginning of World War I, although he still visited Paris during the war. At various times, he also worked in Hattem, where he briefly had his own studio, Volendam and Haarlem. He focused on simple, rural themes and was very fond of the works of Jan Vermeer, although he also displays some influence from the Hague School. During his life, he was internationally known. He held several exhibitions at the Paris Salon and was awarded a medal at the Exposition Internationale at Antwerp in 1894. He also had showings at the World's Columbian Exposition in his hometown of Chicago and at the Exposition Universelle (1900). After World War I, he settled in Paris. While there, he continued to paint the same general type of subject matter, but also took commissions for portraits. In 1940, the outbreak of World War II forced him to leave again. He returned to the United States and took up residence in New York, where he died three years later. In the United States, his works may be seen at the Dallas Museum of Art, Art Institute of Chicago, the Telfair Museum of Art in Savannah and at the National Academy of Design in New York.

This practice intertwines airport security measures and privacy specifically the advancement of security measures following the 9/11 attacks in the United States and other global terrorist attacks. Several terrorist attacks, such as 9/11, have led airports all over the world to look to the advancement of new technology such as body and baggage screening, detection dogs, facial recognition, and the use of biometrics in electronic passports. Amidst the introduction of new technology and security measures in airports and the growing rates of travelers there has been a rise of risk and concern in privacy.  History of airport policies  Before the 9/11 terrorist attacks, the only security measure in place in U.S. airports were metal detectors. A metal detectors ability to only detect metal weapons made it inefficient in detecting nonmetals such as liquids, sharp objects, or explosives. After the 9/11 terrorist attacks in the United States, the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) increased security measures all over the airports. Policies were made to prohibit the carry on of liquids, sharp objects, and explosives. Airlines instructed passengers to arrive 2 hours before their flight is to depart if traveling domestically and 3 hours if traveling internationally. After passing through screening, passengers were selected at random for additional screening including bag checks. After an incident, that involved a passenger carrying a bomb in their shoe, security screeners asked passengers to remove their shoes when passing through checkpoints. In February 2002, the TSA officially took over the responsibility for airport security. In 2009, airport security measures were once again shaken when a passenger, now commonly known as the \\"underwear bomber,\\" smuggled a bomb into the airport facility in his underwear. Before these terrorist attacks, only 5 percent of bags were screened. Following these attacks, all bags were subject to screening. In 2008, the European Union considered the use of full body scanners to overcome the challenges with metal detectors in not being able to detect nonmetal weapons and also the challenge of pat-downs. The European commission came to the consensus that passengers must have an option to decline body scanning.  Technology and privacy  = Body screening = Screening Technology has advanced to detect any harmful materials under a traveler's clothes and also detect any harmful materials that may have been consumed internally. Full body scanners or Advanced Imaging Technology (AIT) were introduced to U.S. Airports in 2006. Two types of body screening that are currently being used at all airports internationally are backscatters and millimeter wave scanners. Backscatters use a high-speed yet thin intensity x-ray beam to portray the digital image of an individual's body. Millimeter wave scanners uses the millimeter waves to create a 3-D image based on the energy reflected from the individual's body. In June 2010, the TSA's commissioners report regulated that screening must follow a framework to ensure fundamental rights and health provisions for travelers. Members of particular groups including disabled people, transgender people, older people, children, women and religious groups have experienced additional negative effects on privacy. On April 15, 2010, a letter from the TSA stated that the TSA had in their possession about 2000 body scanned photos from devices that they claimed were unable to store data/images. Alternative security measures are offered to travelers who wish to opt out-of-body screening. The United States and European Union allow a traveler the option of refusing screening procedures and instead go through a pat-down. However, if a traveler refuses the pat-down then they are refused entry to the secure area of the airport terminal. = Baggage screening = Baggage screening conducted by a TSA official Baggage screening of all bags entering the airport wasn't implemented until after the 9/11 terrorist attacks. Carry on bags typically go through two stages of inspection: an X-ray screening of the contents in the bag and a manual inspection by a Security Screening Operator (SSO). A manual inspection is only necessary if a SSO has doubts of the contents in the bags. After security checkpoints, carry on bags can be inspected further through random searches and checked in bags are screened for explosives or other dangerous items before being sent out to a passenger's respective flight. = Sniffer dogs/detection dogs = Detection dogs are utilized all over airports specifically in baggage claim sections. The role of a detection dog is to prevent any substance such as illegal drugs or explosives to further enter the facility or leave it. The accuracy and physical capacity of these dogs has raised concerns and has led to the creation of sniffer devices. Similarly to dogs, this device also known as \\"chemical sniffers\\" or \\"electronic noses\\" is used to detect any trace of drugs and explosives. Odor, although not commonly thought to be connected with an individual's privacy, is unique to every individual. Every individual has a characteristic odor known as the ‚Äúbody odor signature‚Äù which can be used to identify gender, sexual orientation, health, diet, and so on. It can reveal emotions like fear and happiness and is viewed as a biological footprint. In the Lopez Ostra v Spain, the European Court of Human Rights ruled that odor does in fact have an effect on privacy and human rights. = Camera surveillance and the future of facial recognition = Surveillance cameras are placed strategically around airports to ensure the safety of everyone. An increase in camera surveillance then calls for an increase amount of personally stored data. A human machine interface is controlled by a person who operates the surveillance system to assess a situation. The operator is in control of the cameras and determines where the person will appear on the next camera. Facial recognition is an emerging technology measure for airport security. Facial recognition has made its way to camera surveillance. A study done at The Palm Beach airport showed that the false alarm rate of face recognition surveillance was fairly low and had a success rate of almost 50% when it came to matching. The use of facial recognition during the Super Bowl brought up concerns in connection to the Fourth Amendment. = Facial profiling = In 2003, in an effort to improve the detection of terrorist threat, the TSA introduced the Screening Passengers by Observation Technique (SPOT). SPOT is a behavioral recognition system that looks at the way people conduct themselves through facial expressions and body movement. TSA Behavior Detection Officers (TBO) are stationed at airport security checkpoints and keep an eye out for behavior from travelers that may give off any suspicion of malice. SPOT has been highly critiqued for the times it has been used to misidentify a threat causing intrusive searches on travelers based on a hunch that a TSA official has. eGates (Automated Border Control) in Gatwick South terminal = Biometric systems = Biometrics are human characteristics that are unique to every individual and that usually do not change such as fingerprints, speech, face, etc. Electronic gates, also known as e-gates, have become very common in airports because of their ability to verify travelers based on their biometric information. There are two types of privacy concerns when discussing e-gates, one is general privacy and the other is system-specific privacy. System-specific privacy focuses on beliefs regarding the capability of the system to protect privacy. Europe is the first to have introduced e-gates in their airport facilities, and the future of airport technology for the United States points toward e-gates. In the United States, there are two registered travel programs: the Register Travel (RT) system and the Global Entry (GE) System. These programs are designed to expedite immigration procedures for trusted travelers and are primarily based on fingerprint recognition.  Legality and precedence  = The Fourth Amendment = The Fourth Amendment prohibits unreasonable searches and seizures while also ensuring the protection of an individual's privacy. The relationship between airport security measures such as screening and pat-downs has sparked a controversial debate when it comes to the Fourth Amendment. As security measures heightened following the 9/11 attacks, many travelers have voiced their opinion that these new measures are in violation of the Fourth Amendment. However, airport officials have responded by claiming that screening measures and pat-downs are not seen to violate the Fourth Amendment because these procedures can be made into a condition when a traveler is purchasing airline tickets. In addition, the Fourth Amendment does not create an absolute right to privacy against all intrusive searches instead the constitutionality of a search is highly based on reasonableness and security. The Privacy Act of 1974 protects personal information when it is being processed by the federal government. The following cases provide examples to court rulings on intrusive searches: = United States v. Montoya de Hernandez = United States v. Montoya de Hernandez (1985) ruled that an individual can be subject to an intrusive search, such as a body cavity, if authorities see it fit for the safety of others or themselves. This ruling coincides with the fact that a person is subject to additional screening at any point throughout the airport if airport authorities feel it is necessary or suspect the risk of safety. = Illinois v. Caballes and United States v. Place = The US Supreme Court ruled in Illinois v. Caballes (2005) and United States v. Place (1983) that warrantless searches such as dog searches can be acted upon an individual without the need of suspicion. In airports, detection dogs conduct searches on passengers throughout the facility by having them sniff on a passenger's baggage at baggage claim sections. = United States v. Guapi = United States v. Guapi (1998) ruled that the police did not effectively communicate that the search was optional to the suspect. This type of issue occurs regularly in airports when a traveler is unaware of their privacy rights when it comes to unreasonable searches or alternative search methods available. = Texas and the Tenth Amendment = Following the implementation of enhanced pat downs in airports, the state of Texas challenged federal power by passing two bills into state legislature that would criminalize TSA officials from conducting these pat downs on travelers. Texas argued that the Tenth Amendment, which reserves all remaining power, not delegated to the federal government, to the state and people, allowed them to ensure police powers to protect citizens within their state. However, in 2011, U.S Department of Justice Murphy used the Supremacy Clause to argue that airport security is part of federal domain and cannot be controlled or changed by states laws.

History Originally, the largest Windward Maroon town was Crawford's Town, located high in the Blue Mountains (Jamaica). However, a leadership conflict between Quao and Edward Crawford in 1754 resulted in the destruction of Crawford's Town. pp. 55‚Äì7.Bev Carey, The Maroon Story: The Authentic and Original History of the Maroons in the History of Jamaica 1490‚Äì1880 (Kingston, Jamaica: Agouti Press, 1997), pp. 416‚Äì8. Following the destruction of Crawford's Town, the governor, Sir Charles Knowles, 1st Baronet, relocated the supporters of Ned Crawford to a new village, just three miles north of Crawford's Town, while the supporters of Quao moved to Scott's Hall. Originally known as New Crawford Town, the supporters of Crawford reportedly renamed it Charles Town after Knowles in an expression of gratitude for his support during the 1754 uprising. pp. 55‚Äì9. However, upon the establishment of Charles Town, white superintendents assumed control of the Maroon town, and the Maroon officers reported to them. In 1760, while Quaco and Cain were the nominal Maroon leaders of Charles Town, they reported to the Moore Town superintendent, who marshalled the Maroon forces during Tacky's War. p. 72. In 1774, a Maroon officer from Charles Town named Samuel Grant allegedly killed a white sea captain named Townshend and his black slave while hunting runaways in Hellshire, but at his trial at Spanish Town, much to the surprise of local planters, Grant was acquitted of the murder of Townshend. Grant returned to Charles Town, where he rose through the ranks of the Maroon officer class, eventually becoming a major and nominally leader of the Maroon town, a post he held for many years. pp. 75‚Äì6. In 1781, Charles Town Maroons Grant, William Carmichael Cockburn and John Reeder were a part of the Maroon party that successfully hunted and killed the notorious leader of a community of runaway slaves, Three Fingered Jack (Jamaica). pp. 113‚Äì5.Benjamin Moseley, A Treatise on Sugar (London: G.G. and J. Robinson, 1799), pp. 175‚Äì6. In 1770, there were 226 Maroons at Charles Town, but by 1797 that number had grown to 289. p. 108. During the Second Maroon War of 1795‚Äì6, the Windward Maroons remained neutral, but the governor, Alexander Lindsay, 6th Earl of Balcarres, ordered Grant to lead a party of Charles Town Maroons to Kingston to await his orders. However, an obeah man advised Grant that Balcarres planned to deport them, and Grant, suspicious of the governor, led his men back to their Maroon town in the Blue Mountains. Balcarres later admitted that he had indeed planned to deport the Windward Maroons.Lord Lindsay, Lives of the Lindsays; or, A Memoir of the Houses of Crawford and Balcarres (London: John Murray, 1858),Vol. III, p. 102n. p. 139. In 1807, the colonial authorities exposed a slave conspiracy, and one of the informers claimed that the Charles Town Maroons under Major Robert Bentham were conspirators. Grant, who was the elderly leader of Charles Town, denied the charges. William Anderson Orgill, the magistrate who investigated the case, dismissed the evidence of the slave conspirators, and chose to believe Grant's expressions of loyalty. pp. 194‚Äì5. Under the leadership of Charles Town superintendent Alexander Fyfe (Fyffe), the Maroons helped to put down the Christmas Rebellion of 1831‚Äì2, also known as the Baptist War, led by Samuel Sharpe. pp. 203, 277. In 1808, the Maroon population of Charles Town was 254, and it grew slowly to 391 in 1831, after which it decreased to 357 in 1841. p. 243. Charles Town converted to Christianity in the nineteenth century, eventually embracing the Anglican Church. It is believed that Charles Town embraced the Church of England because that Protestant sect endorsed slave- ownership, and the Charles Town Maroons owned slaves. However, by the 1850s, the traditions of Revival and Pentecostalism grew out of the merging of West African religions with Christianity. pp. 221‚Äì3.

Following the British recognition of Maroon settlements, British Superintendents were assigned as diplomats to settlements to maintain good relations between the Maroons and British.

The facility, which was designed by William Burn in the neoclassical style using a corridor plan layout, opened as James Murray's Royal Lunatic Asylum in 1828. Additional wings, designed by Burn, were added in 1833 and Pitcullen House, a neighbouring property, was acquired for use as a superintendent's residence in 1849. More wings, this time designed by Andrew Heiton Junior, were added in 1888 and two villas were added in 1904. The hospital joined the National Health Service as James Murray's Royal Mental Hospital in 1948. After the introduction of Care in the Community in the early 1980s, the hospital went into a period of decline and such a large facility was no longer necessary: a modern facility, designed by Atkins and built by Morgan Sindall Group and Robertson Group at a cost of ¬£75 million on the same site, opened in June 2012.

Plot  Joanna Thomas, a high school drama teacher, has been happily married for 15 years to Cameron Thomas, a successful orthopedic surgeon. Joanna's life seems complete until she begins to suspect that Cameron is having an affair. Her worst fears are confirmed when her intuition leads her to follow him one morning, ending up at an apartment complex. In horrified disbelief, Joanna watches Cameron embrace another woman. After Joanna tells her husband to leave their home, a distraught Cameron heads straight to the red light district to pick up a prostitute. Weeks later, Joanna allows Cameron to move back into the house, although she's still suspicious of his every move. Things seem to return to normal until one night she gets a call from Cameron, who has been arrested for soliciting a prostitute. An enraged Joanna breaks open Cameron's locked desk drawer and discovers a key to the apartment where she had followed him earlier. There, she finds stacks of porn magazines, drawers full of condoms, oils, and X-rated videos‚ÄîCameron's very own den of iniquity. Joanna learns that Cameron's double life included frequenting prostitutes for years, visits to strip clubs and frequent phone sex. In order to avoid an embarrassing court appearance, Cameron is ordered to see a psychologist, who requests that Joanna also attend. Joanna and Cameron learn that he may be a sex addict. Cameron reacts to the news by storming out of the office, and going to the one place where he finds solace, a strip club. He begins to observe the behavior of several men at the club, and eventually finds himself in a porn shop feeding quarters into a peep show. Desperate and overwrought, Cameron runs home to Joanna and admits he has a problem, begging for help. Cameron continues his therapy sessions with the psychologist and begins attending Sex Addicts Anonymous meetings. Feeling like his life is back on track, Cameron approaches Joanna about moving back in, but Joanna isn't ready, and they quarrel. An angry Cameron heads straight for the red-light district to cruise for prostitutes. Only this time something stops him. He phones the one person who can help him, his sponsor Carl. Three months later, Cameron stands before his group of fellow Sex Addicts to receive his 90-day medallion for abstaining. Joanna arrives at the meeting, but time will tell if she can forgive Cameron's betrayal, if Cameron can live a life free from sexual addiction and if together they can rebuild the life they once knew.

The country is mostly mountainous with a very long, convoluted coastline, consisting of peninsulas and many islands. The climate ranges from Mediterranean through temperate to alpine, and the habitats include mountains, hills, forests, rivers, lakes, coasts and cultivated land. Geography Greece is a country in the Balkan Peninsula of southern European, and lies to the south of Albania, North Macedonia and Bulgaria, and west of Turkey. It has a long coastline with the Mediterranean Sea and the Aegean Sea, and includes the island of Crete and many smaller islands. Mainland Greece covers about 80% of the total territory and is largely mountainous. The largest mountain group is the Pindus Range which forms the spine of the Greek mainland, with the highest peak rising to above sea level. The country's tallest mountain, Mount Olympus is further east, and rises to above sea level. The large Peloponnese peninsula, in the south of the country, is separated from the rest of the Greek mainland by the Corinthian and Saronic Gulfs, but joined by the Isthmus of Corinth. Climate Much of the country experiences a Mediterranean climate with warm or hot, dry summers and the rainfall falling in winter. The islands mostly have a Mediterranean climate, with the climate of Crete being particularly influenced by its maritime surroundings and proximity to Africa. Higher regions of the western and central parts of the country, and the mountainous parts of the Peloponnese, experience an Alpine climate. The climate is very varied across the country; snow may still be lying near the peaks in June while the lowlands are experiencing high temperatures. Flora Evergreen oak Greece includes a great diversity of vascular plants among its flora. In 2013, there were 5,752 species and 1,893 subspecies of native and introduced plants, for a total of 6,620 taxa, including 1,278 endemic species and 452 endemic subspecies. By June 2018, the number of species had been revised upwards with 6,695 taxa being listed, consisting of 5,828 species and 1,982 subspecies, belonging to 1,073 genera and 185 families. Much of Greece lies within the Aegean and Western Turkey sclerophyllous and mixed forests ecoregion. This is characterised by maquis shrubland which includes the evergreen oak and the Greek strawberry tree, as well as the kermes oak, the strawberry tree, green olive, the bay laurel, the cedar, the Spanish broom and others. Intensive land use has reduced these forests to remnants. Of the deciduous species most common are the ash, the elm, the Montpellier maple, the Judas tree, the terebinth, the smoke tree and others. Greece was connected to western Turkey during the Pliocene era, and the two countries include many identical plants among their flora. The Cretan date palm has a very restricted range in southern Greece and Crete, with a few stands in Turkey. Fauna Mediterranean monk seal on rocky shore on Serifos Larger, carnivorous mammals found in Greece include the European wildcat, the Balkan lynx, the red fox, the golden jackal, the grey wolf, the Eurasian brown bear, the American mink, the least weasel, the European polecat, the marbled polecat, the beech marten, the European pine marten, the European badger, the Eurasian otter and about twenty species of bat.This list is derived from the IUCN Red List which lists species of mammals and their distributions. The island of Gyaros is the breeding area for the largest population of the endangered Mediterranean monk seal, and about fifteen species of whales, dolphins and porpoises are reported in Greek waters. Golden jackal in central Macedonia Ungulates found in Greece include the wild boar, the red deer, the fallow deer, the roe deer, the chamois and the endangered Cretan ibex. Also present are the European rabbit and the European hare, the southern white-breasted hedgehog and the northern white-breasted hedgehog, the European mole, some ten species of shrew and around thirty species of rodent (squirrels, dormice, mice, rats and voles). With its varied topography and habitats, Greece has a rich bird fauna. It is a meeting point for birds of three continents, the southern limit for some species and the northern limit for others. Beside the resident bird populations, many migratory species visit the country as they move seasonally between their breeding grounds and their overwintering areas. About 450 species of bird have been recorded in Greece. The Dadia Forest in the northeast is an important area for birds of prey, where four species of vulture are among the thirty-six diurnal species of raptor that have been recorded. Birds commonly found in the maquis shrubland include the subalpine and R√ºppell's warblers, the cirl, rock and black-headed buntings, and the rock, red-legged and chukar partridges. Wetland birds are well catered for by a number of Ramsar sites such as Lake Kerkini, the Nestos Delta, and the Evros Delta and their freshwater marshes, lakes, brackish lagoons, saltmarshes and mudflats. Greece's rivers are brimming with aquatic wildlife too, with a diverse range of endemic freshwater fishes, around 160 species were listed in 2015 . There are also several species of lampreys, notably three species of lamprey endemic to Greece; the Epirus brook lamprey, Greek brook lamprey and Almopaios brook lamprey. Lake inhabitants include the endemic Macedonian shad, formerly a fish that was commercially fished. Within the cyprinid fishes, there is an endemic barbel; the Evia barbel, found only on Evia Island, critically endangered and suffering from increasing droughts and barriers to movement.

He set several national records and qualified for the Olympic Games, and served as a race official and administrator for more than 40 years, holding office at club level for more than 30 years, later holding several national roles and then co-founding the Irish Veteran Cycling Association. Life =Cycling career= Early cycling career O'Connell began cycling with the Dublin Wheelers cycling club in 1948, participating in road races and time trials, most notably from 1948 to 1956; he was later made a life member of the club. In 1952, he was selected to ride for Ireland in the World Championships in Luxembourg, and in international races on the Isle of Man alongside Shay Eliott. He also won an Olympic trial race that year, qualifying to attend, but Ireland was excluded from the Olympics in cycling at that time. In 1953, he won the national Road Race Championships, just ahead of Shay Eliott and then Jim McQuaid. He also secured several place-to-place Irish records, such as Dublin-Wexford in 3 hours and 58 minutes, and Dublin-Derry in 7:09. Club and national office Having held various club offices, he was nominated by the Dublin Wheelers and elected as Road Racing Secretary of the internationally recognised cycling federation, the Irish Cycling Federation (ICF), for 1972-1974. The Dublin Wheelers were very active in national cycling governance in the 1960s and 1970s, with, in 1972, for example, Liam King as general secretary and Joe Doyle as treasurer, in addition to O'Connell as road racing secretary, Paddy McInerney time trial secretary, and Steve Lawless organiser of the Tour of Ireland, while Willie Marks also competed for a national committee general position. Along with Ian Gallahar as P.R.O. for several years, all of these served many years in national sport organisation. O'Connell was a representative of the ICF to the global cycling conference of 1974, and seated on the Olympic Council of Ireland. He later participated in the Tripartite Committee, which worked between the various cycling bodies on the island of Ireland, and on the disciplinary and sporting committees of the fully unified Federation of Irish Cycling. O'Connell also worked on the organising committee of the Tour of Ireland from 1968 to 1980. O'Connell qualified as a masseur and accompanied Irish cycling teams abroad in that capacity. He also worked as a team mechanic, and team manager, and with the Falcon team in the Nissan International Classic in Ireland over two years. Veterans In 1966, O'Connell co-founded the Irish Veteran Cyclists Association (IVCA), and cycled competitively at veteran level until 1988, and casually until the 2010s. In 1989, he became general secretary of the IVCA, serving for more than a decade, and later being elected as Honorary President for life. =Personal life= O'Connell was a staff member and later a manager at Frawley's department store on Thomas Street in Dublin's Liberties. He married Elizabeth (Lily) O'Connell, whose sister Rita married the brother of his friend and fellow Dublin Wheelers committee member, Joe Doyle. The O'Connells had four children, and two of them, and his wife, as well as grandchildren and great-grandchildren, survived him. He lived most of his life in the Manor Estate between Terenure, Kimmage and Greenhills. He became ill in 2013, died 26 January 2016; his funeral was at Greenhills and he was buried at Palmerstown Cemetery.

He participated in road races and time trials and, after winning the handicap event of the Wheelers Winter Cycling League in 1954, was selected to ride in the Isle of Man international annual races in 1955, then one of the main external race destinations from Ireland, as well as races in Belgium and France. He also held various club and Dublin County Board offices, including a spell as Chairman of the Dublin Wheelers, then one of the biggest and most active clubs in the country, and others as Dublin County Treasurer and Dublin County Club Secretary. National roles In 1962 Doyle was nominated by the Dublin Wheelers and elected as national treasurer of the internationally recognised cycling federation, the CR√â, for the 1963 season. By November 1963 he reported greatly improved finances. Having been involved over the years in discussions about unification of Irish cycling, he was reported to have resigned in 1966 in protest at aspects of the process, but this report was later refuted. After the planned dissolution of the CR√â in October 1967, he was deeply involved in the transition to the new national organization, the Irish Cycling Federation, that December, and was elected its first treasurer, continuing in office until 1976.

The mechanical pulping processes use wood in the form of logs or chips that are mechanically processes, by grinding stones (from logs) or in refiners (from chips), to separate the fibers. Mechanical pulp can also be bleached to increase the brightness, but retaining the lignin in the pulp. Industrial mechanical pulping started in the 1840s with groundwood pulping, producing the pulp from grinding. This made wood fibers the main raw material in paper, instead of textile fibers. Later the chemical pulping processes started dominating for many paper types. Today the groundwood pulping mills are few, but the mechanical pulping processes employing refiners are still important in the Pulp and paper industry. The mechanical pulps are primarily used in newspaper and magazine paper and the chemimechanical pulps for cardboard and soft paper.  Mechanical pulps in the paper industry  Wet pulp is loaded in the port in Ume√•, Sweden in 1967. Mechanical pulp is very different from the pulp produced in the chemical processes (the sulfite process and the Kraft process). The chemical methods gives paper with higher strength and pulp that can be bleached further than the mechanical pulps. A benefit from the mechanical processes is that they have a high yield, usually between 90 and 98%, which means that nearly all the wood is used. The yield of the Kraft process is only about 50%, which makes the demand of wood twice as high for the same amount of produced pulp Another benefit of the mechanical pulps is the excellent printing properties, making them very useful in newsprint and magazines. This is because of their good properties of absorbing the ink and also their high opacities and low area density. Chemimechanical pulps can give paper with high stiffness, making them suitable for paper board and as a stiff layer in paper packaging. The mechanical pulping processes have a high yield, which at the same time means that all the lignin is still present in the pulp and paper. Lignin is modified by sunlight, making paper produced from mechanical pups susceptible to yellowing and becoming brittle. Mechanical pulps can be bleached with hydrogen peroxide or sodium dithionite, but the brightness is only increased slightly and the yellowing cannot be hindered as lignin is still present. Mechanical pulping is primarily used in paper products with relatively short life span, such as news paper, books or brochures, but also in coated paper grades for magazines and catalogs. It is also used as the middle layer in cardboard because of its stiffness. These products are used to a high degree, which makes mechanical pulps common in recycled paper and as recycled fibers for paper production. The recycled fibers are mostly used in simpler cardboard, newspaper and tissue paper. A drawback with the mechanical pulping processes are that they require a high amount of electrical power. A typical refiner pulp can require 2000 kWh/mass ton pulp. A larger mechnical pulp and paper mill can, including the paper production, consume 200-300 MW electricity. The chemical pulping processes can often generate enough energy (steam and electricity) to make the mill energy self-sufficient. This energy is generated from wood leftovers (bark and chips) and from black liquor, which in principle is 50% of the incoming wood (as the yield is less that 50% and a majority of the rest ends up in the black liquor). In the mechanical pulp mills the majority of the electricity is converted to heat, creating steam which is utilized in the paper machines.  Mechanical pulping processes  A number of different mechanical processes exist: * Stone groundwood pulp (SGW) is produced by pressing the wood onto a rotating grinding stone. The grinding grits in the surface will penetrate into the surface of the wood and separate the fibers by a combination of compression, heating and shear. * Pressurised groundwood pulp (PGW) is produced in the same manner as SGW, but the grinding is performed in a pressurized chamber with steam. This makes the process more efficient and reduce the energy consumption. * Refiner mechanical pulp (RMP) is produced by feeding wood chip into the center of a disk refiner, consisting of two grooved discs. Either one disc rotates and the other is stationary, or both are rotating in opposite directions. The wood chips are forced toward the periphery by the centrifugal force and is crushed into pulp between the discs. * Thermomechanical pulp (TMP) is produced in the same manner as RMP, but in an atmosphere with elevated pressure. TMP pulp can be produced in several steps, of which the first refiner is pressurized. * Chemimechanical pulp (CMP) is produced with refiners, but the chips are impregnated of soaked in chemicals before refining. This softens the wood by dissolving some of the lignin. The yield also drops below 90% as a consequence. * Chemi-thermomechanical pulp (CTMP) is similar to CMP, but the refining is made under elevated pressures and less chemicals are used. * Bleached chemi-thermomechanical pulp (BCTMP) also includes a bleaching step.

They are also known as \\"queen's bread\\" in Hawaii. Description Sprouted coconuts can be found inside mature coconut fruits. They can range from marble-sized to completely filling the cavity inside the endosperm of the coconut seed. They grow to maximum size at around 20 to 24 weeks after germination. They are technically haustoria, as they are cotyledonary structures that absorb nutrients and water from the solid and liquid endosperm, in this case, as food for the growing embryo. Sprouted coconuts are preferably eaten while still fresh and small, as older larger sprouts tend to become rancid and have an unpleasant soapy taste.

Life and career  Schefold's father, Karl Schefold, was an archaeologist. His mother Marianne Schefold, born \\"von den Steinen\\", was the daughter of Karl von den Steinen. The family migrated in the 1930s from Germany to Switzerland. Starting his school years in Basel, he received a diploma degree in mathematics, theoretical physics and philosophy in Munich, Hamburg and Basel in 1967. He served for a year as President of the Verbandes der Schweizer Studierendenschaften(de) in Bern. Afterwards, he started studying Klassische National√∂konomie(de) in Basel and Cambridge, United Kingdom. After he finished his doctoral studies, he assumed a lecturer job in Basel from 1971 to 1972. Afterwards, he was a visiting scholar at the Trinity College in Cambridge, as well as at the Yale University. Moreover, he was a research associate at Harvard. Schefold has been a professor at the department of Economics at the Goethe University since 1974 where he was also the Dean from 1981 to 1982. Since 1974, he has held many different visiting professorships: Nice 1977, 1993; Toulouse 1992, 1993; New School for Social Research New York 1984; Rome 1985; Venice 1990; and later he visited east Asia quite often. For 10 years (1981-1990) he taught different courses at the Center of Advanced Economic Studies in Triest. In 2004, he received an honorary doctoral degree from the law department of the University of T√ºbingen, and later in 2005, he received the honorary doctoral degree of University of Macerata in Italy. On 14 December 2010, the Ben-Gurion University of the Negev awarded him with the Thomas Guggenheim Prize in the History of Economics. Currently he is a Senior Professor at the Goethe University. Furthermore, he is an honorary member of the Stefan-George- Gesellschaft. In 2019, as a specially invited visiting scholar, Schefold went to Peking University,China. During staying in China for two months, Schefold made several speeches in Peking University, Tsinghua University and Fudan University, etc. Since obtaining a chair at the Goethe University, Schefold has continued his work on capital theory, relating it to the classical and to the neoclassical tradition in the history of economic thought. His recent theoretical work has led to a profound modification of the so-called Cambridge debate on capital. By introducing random matrices, he was able to derive the (restrictive) conditions under which such old problems as the construction of an aggregate production function or the Marxian transformation problem can be solved rigorously. Engagement Schefold achieved national fame with his work on energy scenarios for Germany in the 1980s and 90s, mainly in collaboration with the philosopher Klaus Michael Meyer-Abich and the physicist and philosopher Carl Friedrich von Weizs√§cker. The book Die Grenzen der Atomwirtschaft, jointly with Meyer-Abich, became a bestseller (1986) and contributed to the end of the development of the breeder technology and of reprocessing in Germany. It advocated the continued use of light water reactors for a limited period of time and helped to convince the public of the need to foster the saving of energy and the development of regenerative sources on the basis of detailed prior studies of their technical and economic feasibility. As a cofounder of the Ausschuss f√ºr Dogmengeschichte and of the European Society for the History of Economic Thought (now an Honorary President), Schefold further has become a leading exponent of this discipline. He was the managing editor of the series Klassiker der National√∂konomie, composed of one hundred reprints, each accompanied by a volume of commentaries, which became known worldwide. For this series, he obtained the collaboration of many renowned scholars, including a number of Nobel Prize winners of economics. The series was remarkable, because it extended from Antiquity to the present and included also an Arab, a Chinese and a Japanese classic. Schefold further edited other series in the history of economic thought; his rediscovery of the German cameralist Klock deserves to be mentioned. His interest in the relationship between economics and general culture led him to study the economic contribution of literary figures. He published on the economics of Goethe and, extensively, on the economists in the circle around the poet Stefan George. George, via his poetry and his pupils, exerted a profound influence on scholars in the humanities during the first third of the 20th century, and the economists among his followers such as Edgar Salin and Kurt Singer searched for new combinations in the triangle between liberalism, anti-modernism and Marxism. Their most fruitful contribution came later, when they helped to lay the ground for the European integration. Schefold has synthesized his own historical approaches in his works on economic styles and systems. Schefold was a member of the scientific advisory board for the publications of the Marx-Engels-Gesamtausgabe by the Internationale Marx-Engels Foundation, Internationale Marx-Engels Foundation which is the most complete and largest collection of the works of Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels. Moreover, he counseled the German Bundestag and land parliaments on energy policy. From 1995 to 1999, Schefold was the Chairman of the Council and from 2000 to 2002, he was the president of the European Society for the history of Economic Thought, European Society for the history of Economic Thought of which he is an honorary president nowadays. Besides, he works in several committees of the German Economic Association and other economic societies in Germany. Additionally, he belongs to the scientific society of the Goethe University and was a member of the board of the Frankfurter Gesellschaft f√ºr Handel, Industrie und Wissenschaft (Frankfurt Society of trade, industry and science), Frankfurt Society of trade, industry and science of which he is an honorary member currently. Furthermore, he is an honorary president of the Schweizerisch-Deutsche Wirtschaftsclub (Swiss-German economic club), Swiss-German economic club whose president he was from 2000 to 2008. From 1995 to 2009, he was a chairman of the Stefan-George-Gesellschaft e.V. in Bingen, Stefan-George-Gesellschaft of which he is an honorary member now. Schefold has published about George, his circle and the economists accompanying him several times. Since 2017, Bertram Schefold is a Senior Fellow at the Forschungskolleg Humanwissenschaften. Forschungskolleg Humanwissenschaften  Notable publications  Schefold has published more than fifty books, edited several series, published more than 120 articles in academic journals, and made more than 250 contributions to collective works in several languages and disciplines, from mathematics to history and literary criticism, always endeavoring to show that economics, beyond the spheres of pure and applied theory, is connected with all aspects of human life and culture.

China Constructing Capitalism: Economic Life and Urban Change. Routledge, September 23, 2013. , 9781134004522. CITED: p. 262. History The area is known as the home of a local family with the surname Zhuang, and historically residents spoke the Weitou dialect and made their living through farming and fishing. Local legends stated that the founder of Shuiwei was Zhuang Luogong, a descendant of Zhuangzi. Shenzhen-based American anthropologist Mary Ann O'Donnell described a statue of Zhuangzi, flanked by water, as being \\"the heart of Shuiwei\\". Water historically flowed through many areas of Shuiwei. Around the 1980s residents took goods from Hong Kong and re-sold them on the Mainland side. At a later point factories became commonplace and industry became the heart of the local economy. The Shenzhen government pursued a redevelopment scheme, spending 1.2 million yuan ($178,000 U.S. dollars) to acquire land on the Shum Chun River. The area authorities promoted the Shuiwei model of redevelopment, which was meant to attract employees of white collar firms with conversion of existing housing into apartments.

For example, a red book is still a book, a beautiful dancer is still a dancer. However, a fake tree is not a tree, and an alleged criminal may not be a criminal. In general, given adjective A and noun N, if the noun phrase A+N is an N, then A is intersective. Anti-intersective adjectives are a special case of non- intersective adjectives, where the resulting instance is definitely not an instance of the former noun, as with the fake tree. There are different kinds of intersectives: # pure intersective: blue book; the set of blue things and the set of books are not equal and are said to intersect purely # subsective: beautiful skater; the person can be beautiful and a skater, or the person can skate beautifully; in the latter case, the adjective qualifies the kind of skater the person is (rather than add non-intersective information); this is known as a subsective adjective; in this case 'beautiful' can be either subsective or pure intersective depending on interpretation (semantic ambiguity) ##relative subsective: big toddler or small elephant; such adjectives are gradable‚Äîthe baby can be big for a toddler, or the elephant can be small for an elephant The opposite class includes non-intersective adjectives, things like supposed, probable, alleged, etc. where the resulting noun may or may not be an instance of the original noun.

It was premiered in the Directors' Fortnight section at the 2019 Cannes Film Festival where it received a fifteen-minute standing ovation. It was one of the most favourably reviewed films out of Cannes that year. It was selected as the Swedish entry for the Best International Feature Film at the 92nd Academy Awards, but it was not nominated. Screening of the film in Georgia sparked protests, due to its portrayal of a gay love affair. Plot Merab (Levan Gelbakhiani) is a young man and dedicated dancer training at the National Georgian Ensemble with his partner and pseudo-girlfriend, Mary (Ana Javakhishvili) and his deadbeat, delinquent brother David (Giorgi Tsereteli). One day, a rehearsal is interrupted by the arrival of Irakli (Bachi Valishvili), a replacement dancer. Though Irakli rankles some of the other dancers as well as the choreographer, Aleko (Kakha Gogidze) with his smug and rebellious attitude, he quickly proves himself to be a natural talent and replaces Merab in a dance, as Aleko had criticized him for not being masculine and rigid enough. Merab is initially jealous of Irakli's talent, as Irakli has been dancing for much less time than he has, but when the two start rehearsing together early in the morning, they begin to bond. A friendly rivalry forms as they compete for a coveted spot in the main ensemble, though Mary learns that the spot is vacant because the previous male dancer had been caught having sex with another man, leading him to be severely beaten by the other dancers and was forced to resort to prostitution to survive. Merab visits his father, who, with Merab's mother, used to be part of the dance ensemble. His father implores him to give up his passion and attend school, as there is no future in dance; furthermore, Aleko dislikes their family, and has been biased against him and David as a result. Meanwhile, Merab and Irakli become friends, and Merab grows increasingly attracted to him. On a trip with friends to visit Mary's father, Merab and Irakli succumb to their mutual attraction and have sex; though they remain discreet, Mary becomes suspicious of their closeness. Though the pair do not discuss their relationship, Merab performs a dance for Irakli in his own style as a means of communicating his feelings. After the group returns home, Irakli disappears, and Merab is unable to contact him. After several missed practices, David finally arrives to the rehearsal, only to be forcibly removed by Aleko due to David's criminal behavior. Merab secures a job for his brother at the restaurant where he works part-time, only for David to get them both fired for dealing drugs on the job, leading to a fight between him and Merab. Despondent and missing Irakli, Merab spontaneously befriends a young male prostitute and goes with him to a gay bar, and is seen leaving by another dancer, Luka. The next day, a hungover Merab performs poorly at practice and injures his ankle. While recovering with Mary, he finally receives a call from Irakli, who informs him that he is back in his hometown to take care of his ill father, and will probably not make the audition. Aleko discourages Merab from auditioning due to his behavior and injury, but Merab insists on continuing to practice. While leaving, he is heckled by Luka, and Mary implores him to be careful, as she does not want him to end up like the ensemble's former dancer. Merab learns that David is having a rushed wedding, as he has gotten a girl pregnant. At the wedding, Merab spots Irakli in the crowd. Though Merab is glad to see him, Irakli admits that he is leaving the city and giving up dancing; his father has died and he has gotten engaged to his girlfriend in order to be close to and provide for his mother. Heartbroken, Merab leaves the reception before breaking down in tears in a sympathetic Mary's arms. At home, he is comforted by David, who reveals he was injured defending Merab's honor from Luka and the other dancers; when Merab admits that he is actually gay, David accepts him and encourages him to get out of Georgia in order to reach his full potential. On the day of the audition, Mary shows up to support Merab. Merab dances passionately despite his healing ankle, but is nevertheless dismissed by the unimpressed director. Merab continues anyway, breaking away from the traditional dance to perform in his own unbridled, androgynous style; though the offended director storms out, Aleko stays to watch. After he is finished, Merab bows and departs.

She spent her career at the Stade de Reims French women's football team and later took part in the French national female team. She played the position of goalkeeper throughout her career. Ghislaine Poyer- Souef is considered one of the pioneers of women's football as she was part of the formation of the first national French women's football team. Football career Ghislaine Royer-Souef's interest in football started at an early age. She began as her brother's ballgirl, and eventually she went on to play on mixed teams at her local football field. At the age of 15, after being shown an advertisement looking for female football players, Ghislaine began her football career at the Stade de Reims in the Division 1 F√©minine football league. She was part of the main roster from June 1968 - June 1979. During this time, Ghislaine and her team won three French championship cups. However, in her early career at the Stade de Reims, there was no licensed female football federation. Upon joining the Italian female football federation (F.I.E.F.), the French Football Federation (FFF) realized the potential benefit of implementing a female league, thus creating one. Ghislaine's team was then recognized by the FFF and began playing games all around the world. Ghislaine went on to be one of the first team players on the French women's national team, being selected to play 7 times between 1971-1976. Ghislaine was never paid a salary for her involvement in any of the teams she took part of.  Influence  In addition to being one of the pioneers of women's football, Ghislaine's impact can be seen even to this day. While she did not have a specific feminist agenda in introducing France to women's football, she wanted women to be able to enjoy what they have a passion for regardless of gender barriers. She was even criticized by journalists for giving up her duties around the house to play football, but she would not let that affect her and would just play. On April 25, 2018, the French film, Comme des Gar√ßons, or \\"Let the Girls Play\\" was released. This film reimagines women's journey in creating a gender-free sports association, specifically football in France.

This index includes 193 countries ranked from -2.5 (less effective) to 2.5 (more effective). It is one in a broad set of government quality indicators. The World Bank issues the government effectiveness index among other 5 worldwide governance indicators: voice and accountability, political stability, regulatory quality, rule of law and control of corruption. All these indexes are produced by Daniel Kaufmann, from the Natural Resource Governance Institute, and Aart Kraay, from the World Bank Development Research Group. These 6 indexes are considered as dimensions of governance. Methodology The government effectiveness index uses 47 variables (ranging from quality of bureaucracy to distribution infrastructure of goods and services) from 32 sources (ranging from African Development Bank to Global Insight Business Conditions and Risk Indicators). These variables are then rescaled and combined through the unobserved components model. Significance As an aggregate measure, the government effectiveness index does not allow to spot specific problems of a country or to analyse particular solutions, but it is a useful tool to compare countries in a broad sense, to measure the improvement of a particular country, or to ascertain trends. Government effectiveness shows a high correlation with life satisfaction, GDP per capita and education expenditure. Guisan concludes that it fosters development.

It places two beta models with potential users to learn the results of their interactions with the apparatus. A French couple (played by Balbir and Katerine) host one of the units, named Vincent; a single French man, Jerem, receives the other, named Yves. Jerem is a wannabe music developer, currently working out of his garage, and basically going nowhere careerwise. He is initially repelled by the refrigerator as it criticizes his diet, opines on current events, and physically blocks Jerem from his unhealthy eating habits. But when the company sends a statistician (So) to monitor his interactions with the unit, his attitude changes as he tries to win her attention and affection. The three-way interaction between the two humans and the almost- human appliance is explored in the remainder of the film.

Plot synopsis  The story takes place in the women's camp in Auschwitz concentration camp, in 1945. Haya (Einav Markel) arrives with her daughter Inuchka (Yael Porat). During the selection process, the two are separated, and Haya promises her daughter that she will do anything and everything to make sure they reunite. In the children's section, Inuchka is terrified of the cruel kapo, Maria (Dana Muszkatblit), and runs away from her. She is found crying by Reysy (Liat Azar), a prisoner who works as a nurse in the infirmary, who takes her to the clinic and tries to hide her there. Another nurse, Shifra (Almog Pa'il), objects to this plan, but the head nurse, Nechama (Liel Danir), convinces Shifra to keep the secret, in exchange for part of her daily food rations. Reysy is fired from the infirmary when she is discovered trying to organize a Yom Kippur prayer. She goes to work in the sewing workshop, where Haya has also been placed. She is upset when she learns she must work on the Sabbath, but is determined to sew more than her share all the other days so that she can avoid work on Saturday. She is nearly caught not working by a guard, but Haya creates a distraction. Haya believes her daughter is alive, not fully understanding the meaning of the incinerators in the camp. When one of the prisoners ridicules her for this, and says that she is probably long gone, Haya breaks down, and runs away, towards the electric fence. Reysy prevents her from killing herself. Haya is later sent to work in the officers' library, where she learns the war is nearing its end. When the allied forces near the camp, the Germans abandon it. Haya wanders about looking for food, and while searching the infirmary, finds the cupboard in which Inuchka is hiding.  Cast  The film's cast includes: * Haya - Einav Markel * Inuchka - Yael Porat * Reysy - Liat Azar * Nechama - Liel Danir * Shifra - Almog Pa'il * Kapo - Dana Muszkatblit  Production  The film was Avrahami's highest budget film, costing over 1 million ILS. It was filmed in the Ukraine. Avrahami made the film following requests by teachers and community to have a work depicting Jewish heroism in the Holocaust, but she has called the film the biggest failure of her career: \\"The pain in the film was apparently too real. The women didn't enjoy it. 'Why did you make us cry during a holiday?' Some had seen films such as Schindler's List, but for them it was very American and distant, while here they got Jewish authenticity before their eyes, and they couldn't take it.\\" After the debut screening, Avrahami ran back to the studio and edited out some of the harsher scenes, but the result did not work, and the film was shelved. According to Avrahami, it was the first of her films that no attempt was made to steal.

He showed in both group and solo exhibitions in Manhattan and San Francisco and was a founding member of American Abstract Artists. He is known both for fully abstract and for representative works, but the latter predominate. He once said a painter should embrace many ideas, symbols, forms, tones, and colors and through metamorphosis make them into a new thing -- a painting having a life of its own. Having taken up photography as a mid-career hobby, he became as well known for his photographs as for his easel works. Early life and training Bowden was born in Los Angeles in 1907. At the age of 20 he studied at the Otis Art Institute and also privately under J. Francis Smith. In 1927 or 1928 he traveled to New York and took a room in a boarding house in the Lincoln Square neighborhood of Manhattan, an area that had been dubbed a \\"New Bohemia\\" when aspiring artists, writers, and practitioners of the performing arts congregated there during the first two decades of the 20th century. During 1928 and 1929 he studied at the National Academy of Design and the Art Students League. Bowden subsequently returned to Los Angeles and took a job in an advertising agency. In 1931 a summer class that was taught by Hans Hofmann at the University of California, Berkeley, helped him to resolve his uncertainty about becoming a professional artist. In 1932 he enrolled in the Chouinard Art Institute in Los Angeles and that same year he was given a solo exhibition at the Paul Elder Gallery in San Francisco. Career in art In 1934 Bowden moved back to New York to resume study under Hofmann. In September he participated in a group show at the Contemporary Arts Gallery. The following year he became a studio assistant in the School of Fine Arts that Hofmann was then directing on East 57th Street in Manhattan's gallery district. He also joined the recently established Federal Art Project and began receiving payment for murals he painted as a federal employee. One early commission brought Bowden together with six fellow artists as assistants to Fernand L√©ger in a project to create murals for the French Line terminal in Manhattan. The murals never got beyond the concept stage, however, as the project was canceled a few weeks after it began. In 1937 and 1938 Bowden made two murals for a low-income housing development called Williamsburg Houses in Brooklyn. In 1936 he was one of 30 founding members of American Abstract Artists, a nonprofit organization set up to promote abstract art and, through exhibitions, provide means for artist members to show their work to prospective buyers. After joining, he showed frequently in the organization's exhibitions. The same year he also began participating in group shows by two similar organizations: Salons of America and Artists Gallery. He showed once in a Salon exhibition (1936) and many times in exhibitions held at Artists Gallery. During the late 1930s and early 1940s he also showed at the Reinhardt Gallery, the Egan Gallery, and the New School for Social Research in Manhattan. Early solo exhibitions included a 1936 show at the 8th Street Playhouse in Greenwich Village and a 1938 show at the Artists Gallery. In 1941 he was given a second solo exhibition at the Artists Gallery. In about 1940 Bowden took up photography as a relaxing way to recover from the intensity of a session of painting. He later said he would spend his afternoons with his camera after mornings at his easel. During the 1950s he was considered to be a professional in both painting and photography and his photographs are now held in the permanent collections of museums such as New York's Museum of Modern Art. In 1942 Bowden moved to Sausalito, California and took wartime work as a shipfitter. At the end of the war he began to spend some months of the year in New York while continuing to live in California. In 1945 and 1950 Bowden participated in annual exhibitions at the San Francisco Art Association and he continued to exhibit in San Francisco museums and galleries throughout the 1950s. In 1947 he also began what became a regular habit of showing work at the Sausalito Library. That year he also received an award for a painting of Sausalito harbor called \\"Old Town in the Cove\\" and in 1949 received an award for one of his photos. In 1948 he taught color, anatomy, and figure drawing at the California School of Fine Arts. A year later he moved from Sausalito to nearby Marin City. In March 1955 he showed oils in a solo exhibition at the East and West Gallery in San Francisco and in August he showed photographs in a solo exhibition at the California Palace of the Legion of Honor. After he moved to California, Bowden periodically returned to New York to visit friends and do business with gallery owners, but retained his permanent home in Marin City until his death in 1965. =Artistic style and critical reception= Harry Bowden, Abstract Composition, Yellow Background, 1937, watercolor and gouache, 8 1/2 x 7 inches Harry Bowden, Plant on Table, about 1936, gouache, 12 x 9 inches Harry Bowden, Fernand Leg√©r, graphite, 16 1/2 x 14 inches Harry Bowden, Street Children, Mexico, 1941, gelatin silver print, 9 3/4 x 7 3/4 inches Bowden worked in oil, gouache, graphite, watercolor, and mixed media. Most pieces are small enough to have been made on an easel. In the 1930s he studied Cubist painters and his style then showed some Cubist influence. In this period he made both representational and non-representational works. Writing in 1941, a critic noted that he had by then outgrown his tendency toward pure abstraction. Two years later, another critic praised this turn toward semi-abstraction. The exhibition catalog for a 1940 show in which Bowden participated has a statement expressing his point of view. It says, \\"A painting embraces many ideas, symbols, forms, tones, and colors, but all are resolved into a new thing. The metamorphosis makes the painting real -- gives it a life of its own.\\" In 1947 Ad Reinhardt wrote a brief instruction on appreciating abstract art in which he said: \\"Like in much modern painting, we see in the work of de Kooning and Bowden what may seem to be a 'sketchiness' and 'unfinishedness' which not only shows the actual process of creation but asks the onlooker to 'complete' and 'finish' the painting in the looking-act.\\" In a 1955 interview, Bowden said a viewer should not focus on the subject of the painting. \\"The main thing is concept,\\" he said. \\"As in music you play a theme around the subject.\\" Bowden's abstract composition with yellow background (1937), shown at left, is an example of his pure abstractionist style. His \\"Plant On Table\\" (1936), shown at right is an example of his semi- abstractionist style. The sketch of Fernand Leg√©r (1936), shown at right, is an example of his drawing technique. The photo of street children in Mexico (1941), shown at right, is an example of his photography. As a photographer, Bowden took many shots of New York painters who were his friends, including Willem de Kooning (1946, 1951), Ad Reinhardt (1959), Jackson Pollock, and Lee Krasner (1949). He also made photographic portraits of Edward Weston (1951), Imogene Cunningham (1955), and other men and women prominent in the arts. His photographs taken out-of-doors feature nudes in beach or desert scenes, as well as city scenes and landscapes. He rarely or never worked in color and his half-tone work tended to draw out textures and patterns and take advantage of the play of light. Personal life and family Bowden was born on February 9, 1907, in Los Angeles, California. His birth name was Harry Clinton Bowden. Although he did not refer to himself as Harry Clinton Jr., he and his father bore the same name. Harry Clinton Bowden (senior) was born June 17, 1879, in Providence, Rhode Island and died January 20, 1963, in Los Angeles. He earned his living as a self employed die maker for a manufacturer of fruit packing equipment. Bowden's mother was Sina H. Bowden, born in Kansas about 1889. Bowden had a brother, Dale C. Bowden (born about 1913). Bowden was married to a woman whose given name was Lois and who was known as Lois Bowden. The memorial plaque for Bowden and her shows her name as \\"F.

She is known also as the creator of the first yoga mat. Early life Farmer grew up near London, her father Richard Farmer being English, her mother American. She studied physical education and dance. In her teens, she had surgery to cut several nerves, leaving her with reduced sensitivity to touch and \\"intense and chronic pain\\". After college, she practised Sufism. In 1967, working as a schoolteacher, she attended her first yoga class. Six months later, she met B. K. S. Iyengar and studied under him for the following ten years, in London and in his yoga institute in Pune, India, becoming an Iyengar Yoga teacher. In the late 1970s she switched from that strictly disciplined style of teaching to a freestyle yoga, losing most of her students in the process. Teaching Farmer teaches yoga in Yellow Springs, Ohio, in California, in other parts of America, and in other countries. Each summer she and her partner Victor Van Kooten teach yoga in their studio in the Eftalou valley in Lesbos in Greece. They began teaching together in 1984 and have continued to do so for over 25 years. They lead immersive courses in yoga on Lesbos lasting two to three weeks, four times a year. Farmer and Van Kooten call their approach \\"yoga from the inside out\\". Farmer uses imagery, intentionally fluid movements and conscious breathing to explore the prana energy that in her view animates and guides the body. Reception Claudia Cummins, in Yoga Journal writes: \\"Ask devoted students to describe Angela Farmer's teaching, and they'll offer words like freedom, empowerment, surrender, and transformation. They'll describe her approach as soft, fluid, internal, feminine, open, and playful\\". The \\"superstar\\" yoga teacher Donna Farhi studied under Farmer, and like her eventually switched to a freestyle form. Carolyn Brown, in Yogi Times, writes that a yoga class by Farmer and Van Kooten gives no clue to their training under Iyengar, as their style has evolved away from his strictness into a \\"more organic, self- expressive and self-healing way of practicing\\". Farmer is featured as one of the \\"yoga experts\\" on the 2011 film Yogawoman. John Friend, the creator of Anusara Yoga, credits Farmer with creating the original yoga mat, stating that in 1982, while teaching yoga in Germany, she used carpet underlay cut to towel size during yoga classes; later she returned home to London with the material.

Gurpreet Ghuggi‚Äôs character wasn‚Äôt revealed in trailers of the film, Ghuggi described his character as ‚ÄúMagic Singh‚Äù and added ‚Äú[...] if would have been revealed earlier, it would have made things and the movie very clear and predictable. The Chapters (trailers) that we brought forward, only showed certain situations, if the veil would have been taken off from my character, then everything would have been revealed.‚Äù Babbal Rai‚Äôs character is set in the bygone era and he will be seen in a shade different from his earlier performances, also he called himself as ‚Äúdirector‚Äôs actor‚Äù.

The main focus of his career has been the research, design and development of new models of teacher education in the United Kingdom and more widely. In 2009, he was made a Fellow of the Academy of Social Sciences. In 2018, he was made a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in The Queen‚Äôs Birthday Honours List for his work on education in developing countries. Biography Moon was born in Marlborough, Wiltshire, in 1945. He studied to be a teacher at St Paul‚Äôs College, Cheltenham, and gained postgraduate qualifications at the Institute of Education, London University; the University of Warwick; and the University of Sussex (where he completed his doctorate). He began his career as a secondary teacher at Tulse Hill Comprehensive School in the Inner London Education Authority, and was later Headteacher of two large urban secondary schools, Bridgewater Hall School, Stantonbury Campus, Milton Keynes, and The Peers School, Oxford. In 1988, he was appointed Professor of Education at The Open University with a responsibility for developing national and international programmes in teaching and teacher education. Research and development in national and international teacher education Moon has led the development of a range of projects directed at new approaches to teacher education with, particular respect to expanding access to teaching by the use of newly emerging digital technologies. These included the Open University‚Äôs UK-wide Post Graduate Certificate in Education (PGCE), which ran from 1992 to 2018 and was designed to provide a school based, technology supported, route into teaching for mature entrants, particularly those with mathematics and science qualifications. The programme was awarded the Queen‚Äôs Anniversary Prize for Higher Education in 1997 in recognition of the innovative approach used, particularly the strong emphasis on information technologies and partnership between university and schools. In 2005, Moon designed and led the team that established the Teacher Education in Sub-Saharan Africa (TESSA) Programme. The programme was developed in multi-lingual formats (Arabic, English, French and Kiswahili) and operates across ten countries. TESSA was also awarded the Queen‚Äôs Anniversary Award for Higher Education, in 2009, with special mention given to the web-based resources, adapted to local needs, that were being used by over 200,000 teachers. In 2011, the TESSA programme also received the World Innovation Summit for Education (WISE) Award. The TESSA experience led to the publication of a number of analyses that looked in detail at the challenge of providing school systems in developing countries with well-qualified teachers. Between 2010 and 2015, Moon was the lead advisor to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA) teacher improvement programme aimed at teachers working in refugee camps spread across Jordan, Lebanon, Syria, The West Bank and Gaza. The programme was taken by all teachers in the UNRWA schools and led to the adoption of a new model of teacher development within the Agency. Between 2005 and 2020, Moon advised a number of countries and international agencies on educational reform, with specific reference to teachers and teacher education. He has used this experience in further developing an analysis of the ways in which teacher education can be reformed and improved in both developed and developing countries. In 2015, he was appointed Education Specialist on the UK Department for International Development‚Äôs Science Advisory Group (SAG); he held this position until 2020.  Further contributions to curriculum studies and school improvement  Bob Moon was a founding member, in 1976, of the Association for the Study of the Curriculum, later the Curriculum Foundation. He was a Council member for over thirty years and led on the merger of the Association into the British Education Research Association (BERA) in 2012. In 1990, he set up and became Chair of the Editorial Board of a new publication, The Curriculum Journal. He was co-editor from 2002 to 2012. Also in 1990, Moon was also appointed an Associate Commissioner to The National Commission on Education, established by The British Association for the Advancement of Science and funded by the Paul Hamlyn Foundation. The Commission reported in 1993. In 2003, the Department of Education (UK) appointed Bob Moon as an Advisor to the London Challenge. This programme, led by Sir Tim Brighouse, set out to improve significantly the quality of learning across all London secondary schools. An evaluation study by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation found that ‚Äòduring the period of the London Challenge school improvement in London saw a dramatic improvement and local authorities went from the worst performing to the best performing nationally.‚Äô Moon and Brighouse subsequently collaborated, in 2013, to propose a National Teaching Institute for Teacher Professional Development. In 2020, they set out the case for a national Open School, modelled on the Open University, but serving the school sector.

Early life  Margaret A. \\"Mignonette\\" Cutting was born in Chester, Pennsylvania, the daughter of Ella (or Ellen) L. Moseley Kokin and Charles W. Cutting. Her mother was an actress on the vaudeville stage; her stepfather, Prince Kokin, was a juggler from Tokyo. She recalled a childhood spent in London and Paris.  Career  Mignonette Kokin, from a 1923 publication. Mignonette Kokin danced and did comedic impersonations on the vaudeville circuit in the United States, danced in Paris, and toured Great Britain and Ireland. She was described in 1903 as \\"a chic little dancer\\" and \\"a buxom little beauty whose refinement and gorgeous gowns almost hypnotize the fair sex.\\" Kokin often worked alongside the monkey act run by her husband, Charles F. Galetti. In 1907, she detailed her encounter with a simian costar in a New York theatre in 1907, a story published with exaggerated illustrations, under the headline \\"Hugged by a Big Baboon\\": \\"All of the nightmares in the world rolled into one,\\" Kokin wrote, \\"cannot compare with those awful moments I passed in the arms of this repulsive brute, strong enough and ferocious enough to crush my slender body like an eggshell.\\" In 1908 she toured Australia, again sharing bills with the baboon act.

By 2017, he was the commander of the unit of this force that guarded the Federal Legislative Palace, the government buildings of Venezuela. On 29 June 2017, he was decorated by President Nicol√°s Maduro with the order of the Cross of the Presidential Guard. In light of human rights abuses against journalists, Venezuelan opposition politicians, and political opponents of Maduro, Lugo is currently subject to international sanctions from countries including the United States, Canada, and Panama.  Career  Bladimir Lugo has served in the Venezuelan National Guard (GNB) for two decades. In 2004, according to Gaceta Oficial (government communication) No. 38042, Lugo was appointed to the Investigative Council. During the tenure of defense minister Carmen Mel√©ndez from July 2013 to October 2014, Lugo served as commander of the Miranda regiment of the National Command of the People's Guard. As of May 2019, Lugo currently serves as head of GNB Zone 11 Command (formerly known as Core 3) in Zulia state, replacing Brigadier General Alfonso Torres P√°ez, who died when the helicopter he was riding in, \\"Patriot\\", crashed in the parking lot of the Maracaibo bullring on 25 April 2019.  Incidents and controversies  Serving as a high-ranking officer, Lugo has been accused of violence and seen other controversies regarding his or his staff's action or inaction in political situations. = Violence =  Court summons  On 13 July 2017, the Public Ministry of Venezuela summoned Lugo for several cases of aggression against journalists, women, deputies, and demonstrators. These charges include the allegation that in December 2016, he assaulted NTN24 journalist Rafael Hern√°ndez and his work team, preventing him from entering the country's seat of the Vice President; an allegation that Lugo also pushed and tripped Antonieta Mendoza, the mother of imprisoned opposition leader Leopoldo L√≥pez; and that on 28 June 2017 he pushed the president of the National Assembly, Julio Borges. Venezuelan banker Eligio Cede√±o accused Lugo of being involved in the kidnapping of the Faddoul brothers in 2006, who were later found dead along with Cede√±o's driver, and the kidnapping of Cede√±o's daughter in 2005. At this time, the trial court ordered his investigation.  2017 Venezuelan National Assembly attack  Bolivarian National Guard storming the National Assembly On 27 June 2017, following the Caracas helicopter incident, Bolivarian National Guardsmen stormed the National Assembly and assaulted the largely opposition legislative body. Images were published showing Lugo snapping his hand in the face of National Assembly speaker Julio Borges and later forcibly pushing the speaker through a door. Other reports state that journalists were held captive by violent government supporters outside the building for over four hours without any intervention from the National Guard in the area. Two days later on 29 June 2017, Lugo was promoted by President Maduro and was granted the Order of the Presidential Guard Cross and the Medal of Honor of Merit under the banner of the National Guard. Lugo was the commander of the unit that guarded the National Assembly when there were attacks against deputies and other people with the help of the National Guard on 5 July 2017. = Disruptive orders =  2017 Venezuelan referendum  Colectivos firing at voters in Catia On 16 July 2017, during the national referendum, Lugo was in charge of the security of the voting center near the El Carmen church in Caracas. In the afternoon, pro-government and opposition parties clashed in Catia until pro- government motorcyclists shot at citizens who were in the voting center, resulting in one deceased and three wounded. According to Popular Will leader Pedro Ben√≠tez, and witnesses of the attack, Lugo refused to act to avoid a confrontation between the two groups, responding \\"that's not [his] problem\\".  √ìscar P√©rez burial controversy  On 21 January 2018, journalist Nelson Bocaranda reported that Lugo had been in charge of moving the body of √ìscar P√©rez to the Cementerio del Este burial site in Caracas, and accuses him of being the one to close access to prevent the entry of relatives and other people to the site.  Blocking the Assembly and alleged assaults on journalists  On 17 April 2018, on Lugo's orders, journalists were barred from entering the Federal Legislative Palace during the approval of the prosecution of Nicol√°s Maduro for acts of corruption requested by the Supreme Tribunal of Justice of Venezuela in exile. Lugo had the journalists wait for over an hour at the corner of San Francisco before finally deciding that they would not have access. On 15 May 2018, Lugo and officials of the Bolivarian National Guard were reported to have assaulted journalists and National Assembly deputies outside the National Constituent Assembly, denying them access. The National Union of Workers of the Press of Venezuela reported that it was the sixth time in less than a month in which press were denied access to the Federal Legislative Palace, with the first time occurring on 17 April. Tinedo Gu√≠a, the president of the National Association of Journalists (CNP), rejected the continuous violence towards journalists carried out by National Guardsmen commanded by Lugo, declaring him persona non grata. Additionally, due to violence, the College of Journalists alerted the international community to threats to freedom of expression in Venezuela and urged the Plan Rep√∫blica and the various actors part of the 2018 presidential election process to respect and facilitate the work of the journalists and communicators during the elections.  Sanctions  As the commander of the unit responsible for guarding the National Assembly, which has an opposition majority, Lugo has been accused of assaults and human rights abuses against journalists, Venezuelan opposition politicians, and political opponents of Maduro. As a response to these actions, several countries have placed international sanctions on Lugo. On 9 August 2017, the United States Department of the Treasury placed sanctions on Lugo for his position in the Constituent National Assembly of Venezuela. His role is to provide security for the Federal Legislative Palace, which houses the pro-opposition National Assembly and the pro-government National Consitiuent Assembly. On 22 September 2017, the Canadian government sanctioned Lugo due to alleged \\"rupture of Venezuela's constitutional order\\" and prohibited Canadian citizens from dealing with him. On 29 March 2018, the Panamanian government sanctioned Lugo for his alleged involvement with \\"money laundering, financing of terrorism and financing the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction\\".

Hinzpeter was a reporter for the ARD and the only journalist to film the massacres during the Gwangju uprising in South Korea in 1980. His footage was delivered to Germany and broadcast worldwide.Schnappschuss: Warum ist ein deutscher Kameramann in S√ºdkorea ein Volksheld? In: daserste.de, 29. Februar 2016 He reported about the student uprising and the leader Kim Dae-jung who later became President of South Korea. In Gwangju there is a memorial honoring Hinzpeter erected by the May 18 Memorial Foundation. Career Hinzpeter was eager to become a doctor during his school days, but joined the Hamburg branch of ARD, Germany's regional public-service broadcaster, as the TV station cameraman in 1963, changing his career path to journalism. In early 1967, he was assigned to Hong Kong, where the ARD had its only branch in East Asia. Covering the Vietnam War, he was injured in Saigon in the spring of 1967. After that, he transferred to the Tokyo branch of the ARD and worked as a correspondent there for nearly 17 years from 1973 to 1989. Hinzpeter visited Korea several times as the ARD's Japanese correspondent. He recorded a large number of public security incidents under the Park Jung-hee regime and did interviews with Kim Young-sam, who was under house arrest just before the 18 May Democratic Uprising. On 19 May, when the Democratic Uprising was in progress, , Pastor of the East Asia Germany Mission, arranged for Hinzpeter to go to Gwangju from Japan. On the early morning of 20 May he covertly entered Gwangju. Hinzpeter filmed the Kwangju massacre, where young people were beaten with billy clubs and trampled underfoot, and the bodies of other young people were seen in the provincial government building, on ten rolls of film. Smuggling out his film, Hinzpeter hid it in a big metal can of biscuits decorated to look like a wedding gift. He flew to Tokyo and sent the film to Germany. Hinzpeter returned to Gwangju on 23 May to photograph the liberation of Gwangju, when martial law was withdrawn and the citizens' local self-government was formed. He was emotionally shaken by the brutal events he witnessed. Hinzpeter's film was immediately shared with many countries through the ARD, and it was incorporated in and broadcast as a documentary titled Korea standing at a crossroads in September of that year. The documentary was secretly screened in the Fifth Republic of Korea, where the media was being tightly controlled at the time. Most of the video materials related to the Gwangju Democratization Movement known today were collected by Hinzpeter. Covering protests at Gwanghwamun intersection in November 1986, the end of the republic, Hinzpeter was beaten by plainclothes officers and received a neck spine injury. After retiring from journalism in 1995, he settled in Ratzeburg, Germany. The video taken by Hinzpeter at Gwangju was released in May 1980 - Blue Eyed Witnesses, an episode of KBS 1TV's Sunday Special in 2003. The 2017 film A Taxi Driver centers on Kim Man-seob, a taxi driver who helped Hinzpeter during the uprising. Awards and honors In 2003 Hinzpeter was awarded the \\"\\" by the South Korean journalist association in recognition of his contribution to the South Korean democratization movement. On 19 May 2005 a special prize was awarded to him by the Korea Broadcast Camera Journalists Association. Later life and death With his chronic heart disease temporarily putting him in a life-threatening condition in 2004, Hinzpeter revealed his desire to be buried in Gwangju after his death. Dramatically recovering his health, he attended the twenty-fifth ceremony for the Democratic Uprising and continued his activities, including writing his memoirs. Hinzpeter died on 25 January 2016, at the age of 78 at the University of L√ºbeck in Germany. Another source said that he died in his hometown of Ratzeburg, northern Germany. Though he had expressed the desire to be buried in Gwangju, his family did not honor that wish. Instead, a memorial tombstone containing his nail clippings and hair, which Hinzpeter had left in the city in 2005, was installed in a special memorial garden in Gwangju by the May 18 Memorial Foundation on 16 May 2016.

Glandular tissue surrounds the urethra into which a pair of bulbourethral glands (Cowper's glands) empty at the base of the penis. The intraabdominal testes and excurrent ducts, along with the presence of a cloaca exhibit homology to the reptilian male reproductive tract. The combination of reptilian and mammalian structures within the monotreme reproductive tract has informed the evolution of the male reproductive tract in mammals. For example, the intraabdominal low sperm storage capacity of the echidna epididymis informed the role of the epididymis as a prime mover in the evolution of descended testes in mammals as it relates to lower extragonadal temperatures enhancing epididymal sperm storage in scrotal mammals.Djakiew, D. and Cardullo, R.

Examination of the monotreme periurethral tissue has been limited by the availability of these protected and relatively rare mammals, hence, the long time line for scientific research of reproductive tissue between studies.  Structure of the monotreme prostate  Figure 1. Aspermatogenic echidna prostateFigure 2. Spermatogenic echidna prostate The glandular tissue surrounding the monotreme urethra most likely represents a rudimentary prostate. There are no periurethral glands in reptiles. Hence, the evolution of the prostate gland is unique to mammals. Primordial periurethral glands have been described in the platypus as secretory glandular tissue surrounding the length of the urethra. The periurethral tissue exhibits regional swelling, being widest immediately beneath the bladder and progressively reducing in thickness along the length of the urethra. Surrounding the periurethral glands is a urethral muscularis. Observations in the platypus of the periurethral glands were non-committal as to homology with the prostate. Subsequently, the periurethral tissue in the echidna was definitively identified as a rudimentary prostate. This is supported by: # anatomically these glands are placed at their widest at the base of the bladder, which is similar in location for the prostate in other mammals, # histologic lining of the echidna urethra with transitional epithelium (Figures 1 & 2), and not post-prostate urethral lining of pseudostratified or stratified columnar epithelium observed in eutherian mammals, # location of periurethral glands with 9-11 buds per cross section surrounding and exiting into the urethra, # histology of simple columnar secretory cells lining compound alveolar glands, # the glandular tissue is surrounded by a muscularis to facilitate expulsion of secretory products into the urethra, # seasonal changes in echidna glandular development, whereby in aspermatogenic animals the glandular tissue surrounding the urethra is less developed (Figure 1) than during the breeding season when the secretory glands surrounding the urethra of spermatogenic animals appear well developed (Figure 2) coinciding with elevated levels of testosterone and active spermatogenesis. In aggregate, these characteristics of glandular tissue surrounding the urethra identify a rudimentary disseminate prostate in monotremes.

The North Woods, in the northwestern corner of the park, is a rugged woodland that contains a forest called the Ravine, as well as two water features called the Loch and the Pool. The western portion of the North Woods also includes Great Hill, the third highest point in Central Park. North Meadow, a recreation center and sports complex, is immediately southeast of the North Woods. Completed in the 1860s, North Woods and North Meadow were among the last parts of Central Park to be built. History = Construction = North Woods and North Meadow, located between 97th and 110th Streets in Central Park, were among the last parts of the park to be built. While construction on the southern part of the park started in 1857, the northernmost four blocks between 106th and 110th Streets were not even purchased until 1859. At the time, the northwestern corner of the park was a rocky forest, while the northeastern corner (now the Harlem Meer) was a swamp. The Pool and Loch in the North Woods were proposed by Central Park commissioner Robert J. Dillon, who included it as one of seventeen amendments to the Greensward Plan, Frederick Law Olmsted and Calvert Vaux's original design for Central Park. Work had started on the northern section of the park by 1864, but was complicated by a need to preserve the historic McGowan's Pass on the northeastern corner of the park. The topography in the northern section of Central Park was not altered as much as that in the southern section of the park: workers created drives and paths, as well as the Pool, Loch, and Harlem Meer, but did not modify much of the landscape. North Woods and North Meadow were completed by the late 1860s. 1868 map of Central Park, detail; North Woods is at left, while Harlem Meer is at top right. North Meadow can be seen at the bottom of the image. In 1870‚Äì1871, the Tammany Hall political machine, which was the largest political force in New York at the time, took control of Central Park for a brief period. They proposed building a zoo at the site of the current North Woods, but the proposal was not implemented. Olmsted and Vaux also proposed an observation tower atop Great Hill, though this was never completed, either. = Late 19th and early 20th centuries = For the first few decades of Central Park's existence, it was forbidden to play most sports in Central Park, because Olmsted and Vaux believed that the park should be used for scenic enjoyment rather than recreation. However, because of growing recreational pressures, the Central Park commission opened North Meadow to sports by the late 19th century. The first recorded cricket matches were played in North Meadow by 1885, and immigrant families began hosting picnics in North Meadow by the 1920s. In addition, there was a proposal to move the Central Park Zoo to the North Meadow in the 1890s, though this was controversial and largely opposed. In 1902, the Interborough Rapid Transit Company excavated a subway tunnel at a deep level underneath the Great Hill, North Woods and North Meadow, as part of its Lenox Avenue Line (present-day ). In 1910, in conjunction with Central Park's growing recreational use, New York City Board of Aldermen president John Purroy Mitchel suggested placing a swimming pool and recreational center in the North Meadow. However, parks commissioner Charles Stover opposed the plan, and it was ultimately dropped. After the plan was cancelled, another proposal was made that would replace the \\"comfort station\\", refreshment stand, and storage shed in North Meadow with a single recreational center. Around this time, in 1911, North Meadow was temporarily closed for reseeding, to mitigate damage caused by heavy usage. During the project, North Meadow was fenced in, and new trees and shrubs were added. The work took about four years. Another plan in the 1920s called for a playground in the northern section of Central Park, near the North Woods. Ultimately, the West 110th Street Playground was built at the site. Under NYC Parks commissioner Robert Moses, athletic fields were constructed in the North Meadow in the 1930s, and bocce, tennis, and volleyball facilities for adults were installed in the Great Hill. The North Meadow was thus designated as an adults' play area, while the Great Lawn further south was reserved for children. In 1962, the city announced that Lasker Rink would be built above the mouth of the Loch. When completed in 1966, the facility served as an ice rink in winter and Central Park's only swimming pool in summer. = Restoration = A rock in North Meadow By the late 1960s, the Loch had deteriorated to such an extent that the cascades along its route had dried up, and the stream was jokingly referred to as \\"the Trickle\\". The Great Hill was also rundown, as was the North Woods. By 1987, the Central Park Conservancy had raised $2.5 million to build a tennis house, the current recreation center, in the North Meadow. However, these plans were opposed by some tennis players, who stated that the existing tennis house on the southern edge of the meadow was located on a hill that afforded better views of the surrounding area, while the proposed tennis house would be located in a depression. The area gained notoriety in April 1989 due to the Central Park jogger case. A white female jogger was badly beaten and raped at night in the North Woods, when 30-32 youths from East Harlem were known to have been roaming through the park, and accosting and sometimes assaulting eight other persons. According to The New York Times, the attack was \\"one of the most widely publicized crimes of the 1980s\\". A group of four black and one Hispanic teenagers, who became known as the \\"Central Park Five\\", were convicted of this and another assault, and sentenced to years in prison. Their convictions were vacated after another man confessed to the crime in 2002, his DNA matched that found in semen at the scene, and the DA's office conducted an investigation of other elements of the evidence. Following the female jogger attack and other assaults in the park that night, the Central Park Conservancy organized the Citizens Task Force on the Use and Security of Central Park. The task force published a report that suggested reverting the North Meadow's baseball fields to a lawn, though this was strongly opposed by athletes who used these ball fields. In 1990, the Conservancy announced recreational programs and restoration projects to attract more people to the North Woods and, by extension, reduce crime. Improvements to the northern end of the park began around this time. Areas of the North Woods was cleared and replanted, and programs to minimize erosion were set up. In 1994, the Conservancy announced a $71.5 million program to restore several portions of the park. The projects included adding drainage systems and reseeding the North Woods and North Meadow. The North Meadow Recreation Center was renovated again from 1998 to 2000. The West 110th Street playground was restored in 2006. A major storm destroyed more than one hundred trees in the northern section of the park in 2009, which represented the single greatest loss to the park's trees in thirty years. JPMorgan Chase later donated $1 million to replace the trees. A $150 million renovation of Lasker Rink was officially announced in 2018, requiring that the rink be closed between late 2021 and 2024. As part of the plan, the portion of the Loch and Harlem Meer under the lake would be restored to a more natural state, and a boardwalk would be added along the newly restored Loch. A new rink would be built to the east of the Loch and would be set within a slope, containing a new pool that would be located at a lower elevation than the existing pool. During winters, ice skaters would be allowed to skate on the boardwalk and the Loch by means of synthetic ice placed on the boardwalk. North Woods A path in North Woods North Woods is the largest of Central Park's three woodlands, and is located at the lightly-used northwestern corner of Central Park. It covers about adjacent to North Meadow. The name sometimes also applies to other attractions in the park's northern end; if these adjacent features are included, the area of North Woods can be . North Woods contains the Ravine, a forest with deciduous trees on its northwestern slope, as well as the Loch, a small stream that winds through North Woods diagonally. The southeastern part of the Ravine contains oak, elms, and maple trees, while the area further east contains oak, hickory, maple, and ash trees. The Woods also includes Blockhouse No. 1, a historic fortification from the War of 1812. The northwestern corner contains a playground called West 110th Street Playground. The playground has a children's play structure as well as spray fountains. The surrounding area also contains several tall rocks, popular among boulderers. = Great Hill = The western portion of North Woods contains Great Hill, the third-highest point in Central Park, rising to above sea level. Great Hill contains a picnic area with tables. Near the top of the hill, a walking path encircles a green lawn. North Meadow North Meadow baseball fields North Meadow, one of Central Park's lawns, measures and is bounded by North Woods (at approximately 102nd Street) to the north and west, Harlem Meer to the northeast, East Meadow to the east, and Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis Reservoir to the south. Samuel Parsons, the superintendent of Central Park during the 1880s through 1910s, once wrote of the North Meadow: \\"It is genuine park scenery that the eye is tempted to linger upon and the foot to walk upon, and presents, if viewed as a single feature, one of the best examples we have of good park work.\\" North Meadow contains twelve baseball fields, as well as six non-regulation soccer fields overlapping with the North Meadow ballfields. A series of butterfly gardens are also located on the northeastern edge of North Meadow. The space has sometimes been used for concerts, such as Garth Brooks's 1997 event Garth: Live from Central Park, which drew an estimated crowd of up to 980,000. In the middle of North Meadow is the North Meadow Recreation Center. The main building in the complex was converted to a recreation facility in the 1990s. The building contains twelve tennis courts and four basketball courts outdoors. In addition, a rock-climbing wall is located inside the recreation center building. In 2007, the center started offering horseback riding in conjunction with the Riverdale Equestrian Center, which operates near Van Cortlandt Park in the Bronx. Additionally, the North Meadow includes a security center, installed in 1984. The Pool and Loch This grotto is the Pool's source. North Woods contains the Loch, which drains into Harlem Meer in the northeastern corner of the park; the Loch is fed by the Pool, whose mouth is the waterfall at its eastern end that is the source of the Loch, just west of the arch called Glen Span. The Loch and Pool are adapted from a single watercourse called Montayne's Rivulet, originally fed from a natural spring but now replenished by the city's water system. The Loch is the only stream in Central Park where an existing watercourse was left aboveground, rather than placed in a culvert underground. The Pool is located near 101st Street and Central Park West. It was once surrounded by lilies and contained a rocky island in the center. The water for the Pool comes from a grotto that hides a water supply pipe. Originally, the Pool was fed by a drainage basin of inside the park as well as to the west of the park boundary. The Loch originates at the Pool before winding through the North Woods and the Ravine. Its name is likely influenced from the trips that Central Park designer Frederick Law Olmsted made to the United Kingdom during the 1850s. The Loch, formerly an actual lake, was whittled down over time into a small stream. Originally, there were two waterfalls on the Loch: a drop at the Pool, and a smaller drop further east. Paths also lined either bank of the Loch. A diverse selection of plant species was located along the Loch, though before the 1990s restoration, this had been reduced to a few invasive species. The Loch enters a culvert between Huddlestone Arch to the west and the Lasker Rink (at the Harlem Meer) to the east. The tall-grass meadow adjacent to the Loch is the park's only woodland meadow. Bridges North Woods contains four ornamental spans. Glen Span, a light-gray gneiss-and-ashlar span, crosses the Loch as well as the adjacent walkway. Further east, Huddlestone Arch carries the East Drive above a pedestrian path and the Loch. It is made of boulders, some weighing nearly . It is the only one in the park whose boulders are held together solely by gravity. South of both of those, the Springbanks Arch carries a bridle path and a former segment of carriage road across a pedestrian path and a stream of the Loch. Finally, the gneiss-and-ashlar Mountcliff Arch, near the Frederick Douglass Circle entrance to the park at 110th Street and Eighth Avenue, is the tallest span in the park at high. In addition, there are three unadorned \\"rustic bridges\\" in North Woods: the Cascade and Loch Bridges, as well as a third unnamed bridge.

The movement was unable to secure its objectives, however it inspired other agrarian movements across eastern Europe in the early 20th century. Although the Russian movement was primarily a movement of the middle class and intellectuals \\"going to the people\\", in some respects their agrarian populism was similar to that of the U.S. People's Party, with both presenting small farmers (the peasantry in Europe) as the foundation of society and main source of societal morality. According to Eatwell, the narodniks \\"are often seen as the first populist movement\\". Ilya Repin's painting, Arrest of a Propagandist (1892), which depicts the arrest of a narodnik. In German-speaking Europe, the v√∂lkisch movement has often been characterised as populist, with its exultation of the German people and its anti-elitist attacks on capitalism and Jews. In France, the Boulangist movement also utilised populist rhetoric and themes. In the early 20th century, adherents of both Marxism and Fascism flirted with populism, but both movements remained ultimately elitist, emphasising the idea of a small elite who should guide and govern society. Among Marxists, the emphasis on class struggle and the idea that the working classes are affected by false consciousness are also antithetical to populist ideas. In the years following the Second World War, populism was largely absent from Europe, in part due to the domination of elitist Marxism-Leninism in Eastern Europe and a desire to emphasise moderation among many West European political parties. However, over the coming decades, a number of right-wing populist parties emerged throughout the continent. These were largely isolated and mostly reflected a conservative agricultural backlash against the centralisation and politicisation of the agricultural sector then occurring. These included Guglielmo Giannini's Common Man's Front in 1940s Italy, Pierre Poujade's Union for the Defense of Tradesmen and Artisans in late 1950s France, Hendrik Koekoek's Farmers' Party of the 1960s Netherlands, and Mogens Glistrup's Progress Party of 1970s Denmark. Between the late 1960s and the early 1980s there also came a concerted populist critique of society from Europe's New Left, including from the new social movements and from the early Green parties. However it was only in the late 1990s, according to Mudde and Rovira Kaltwasser, that populism became \\"a relevant political force in Europe\\", one which could have a significant impact on mainstream politics. Following the fall of the Soviet Union and the Eastern Bloc of the early 1990s, there was a rise in populism across much of Central and Eastern Europe. In the first multiparty elections in many of these countries, various parties portrayed themselves as representatives of \\"the people\\" against the \\"elite\\", representing the old governing Marxist-Leninist parties. The Czech Civic Forum party for instance campaigned on the slogan \\"Parties are for party members, Civic Forum is for everybody\\". Many populists in this region claimed that a \\"real\\" revolution had not occurred during the transition from Marxist-Leninist to liberal democratic governance in the early 1990s and that it was they who were campaigning for such a change. The collapse of Marxism-Leninism as a central force in socialist politics also led to a broader growth of left-wing populism across Europe, reflected in groups like the Dutch Socialist Party, Scottish Socialist Party, and German's The Left party. Since the late 1980s, populist experiences emerged in Spain around the figures of Jos√© Mar√≠a Ruiz Mateos, Jes√∫s Gil and Mario Conde, businessmen who entered politics chiefly to defend their personal economic interests, but by the turn of the millennium their proposals had proved to meet a limited support at the ballots at the national level. = Germany = Friedrich Ludwig Jahn (1778‚Äì1852), a Lutheran Minister, a professor at the University of Berlin and the \\"father of gymnastics\\", introduced the concept of Volkstum, a racial notion which draws on the essence of a people that was lost during the Industrial Revolution. Adam Mueller went a step further by positing the belief that the state was a larger totality than the government institutions. This paternalistic vision of aristocracy concerned with social orders had a dark side in that the opposite force of modernity was represented by the Jews, who were said to be eating away at the state. Populism also played a role in mobilizing middle class support for the Nazi Party in Weimar Germany.Fritzsche 1990: 149‚Äì50, 1998 21st century Jean-Marie Le Pen, founder and leader of the French National Front, the \\"prototypical radical right party\\" which used populism to advance its cause. At the turn of the 21st century, populist rhetoric and movements became increasingly apparent in Western Europe. Populist rhetoric was often used by opposition parties. For example, in the 2001 electoral campaign, the Conservative Party leader William Hague accused Tony Blair's governing Labour Party government of representing \\"the condescending liberal elite\\". Hague repeatedly referring to it as \\"metropolitan\\", implying that it was out of touch with \\"the people\\", who in Conservative discourse are represented by \\"Middle England\\". Blair's government also employed populist rhetoric; in outlining legislation to curtail fox hunting on animal welfare grounds, it presented itself as championing the desires of the majority against the upper- classes who engaged in the sport. Blair's rhetoric has been characterised as the adoption of a populist style rather than the expression of an underlying populist ideology. By the 21st century, European populism was again associated largely with the political right. The term came to be used in reference both to radical right groups like J√∂rg Haider's FP√ñ in Austria and Jean-Marie Le Pen's FN in France, as well as to non-radical right-wing groups like Silvio Berlusconi's Forza Italia or Pim Fortuyn's LPF in the Netherlands. The populist radical right combined populism with authoritarianism and nativism. See: Breeze, R. 2019. \\"Positioning the people and its enemies\\". https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/13183222.2018.1531339Conversely, the Great Recession also resulted in the emergence of left-wing populist groups in parts of Europe, most notably the Syriza party which gained political office in Greece and the Podemos party in Spain, displaying similarities with the US-based Occupy movement. Like Europe's right-wing populists, these groups also expressed Eurosceptic sentiment towards the European Union, albeit largely from a socialist and anti-austerity perspective rather than the nationalist perspective adopted by their right-wing counterparts. = Italy = League's leader, Matteo Salvini, is considered one of the most prominent right-wing populist politicians in Europe. When Silvio Berlusconi entered politics in 1994 with his new party Forza Italia, he created a new kind of populism focused on media control. Berlusconi and his allies won three elections, in 1994, 2001 and, with his new right-wing People of Freedom party, in 2008; he was Prime Minister of Italy for almost ten years. Throughout its existence, Berlusconi's party was characterised by a strong reliance on the personal image and charisma of its leader‚Äîit has therefore been called a \\"personality party\\" or Berlusconi's \\"personal party\\"‚Äîand the skillful use of media campaigns, especially via television. The party's organisation and ideology depended heavily on its leader. Its appeal to voters was based on Berlusconi's personality more than on its ideology or programme. Italy‚Äôs most prominent right-wing populist party is Lega Nord (LN). The League started as a federalist, regionalist and sometimes secessionist party, founded in 1991 as a federation of several regional parties of Northern and Central Italy, most of which had arisen and expanded during the 1980s. LN's program advocates the transformation of Italy into a federal state, fiscal federalism and greater regional autonomy, especially for the Northern regions. At times, the party has advocated for the secession of the North, which it calls Padania. Certain LN members have been known to publicly deploy the offensive slur \\"terrone\\", a common pejorative term for Southern Italians that is evocative of negative Southern Italian stereotypes. With the rise of immigration into Italy since the late 1990s, LN has increasingly turned its attention to criticizing mass immigration to Italy. The LN, which also opposes illegal immigration, is critical of Islam and proposes Italy's exit from the Eurozone. Since 2013, under the leadership of Matteo Salvini, the party has to some extent embraced Italian nationalism and emphasised Euroscepticism, opposition to immigration and other \\"populist\\" policies, while forming an alliance with right-wing populist parties in Europe. In 2009, former comedian, blogger and activist Beppe Grillo founded the Five Star Movement. It advocates direct democracy and free access to the Internet, and condemns corruption. The M5S's programme also contains elements of both left-wing and right-wing populism and American-style libertarianism. The party is considered populist, ecologist, and partially Eurosceptic. Grillo himself described the Five Star Movement as being populist in nature during a political meeting he held in Rome on 30 October 2013.\\"We appeal to the instincts of people. We are populists for real. There is nothing to be ashamed of.\\" Grillo, confessione a eletti M5S: 'Finzione politica l'impeachment di Napolitano' Il Fatto Quotidiano, 30 October 2013 In the 2013 Italian election the Five Star Movement gained 25.5% of the vote, with 109 deputies and 54 senators, becoming the main populist and Eurosceptic party in the European Union. The 2018 general election was characterized by a strong showing by populist movements like Salvini‚Äôs League and Luigi Di Maio‚Äôs Five Stars. In June the two populist parties formed a government led by Giuseppe Conte. = United Kingdom = Jeremy Corbyn, current leader of the UK Labour Party Nigel Farage, former leader of the right-wing populist party UKIP The UK Labour Party under the leadership of Jeremy Corbyn has been called populist, with the slogan \\"for the many not the few\\" having been used. The United Kingdom Independence Party (UKIP) had been characterised as a right-wing populist party. After the 2016 UK referendum on membership of the European Union, in which British citizens voted to leave, some have claimed the \\"Brexit\\" as a victory for populism, encouraging a flurry of calls for referendums among other EU countries by populist political parties.

The ring is about () in diameter, echoing the dimensions of Jefferson‚Äôs iconic Rotunda. Inside it is a second, concentric ring, with a timeline of slavery at the University. The grassy interior of the rings will be used as a gathering place. Inside the rings, distant conversations are audible.

A single engraved word remembers each‚ÄîJerry, butler, Agnes, grandmother, midwife, domestic, Billy. Most of the ring is blank, with only notches, representing the other 3,000+ for whom even this basic information is lacking. If more names are discovered they will be added. The exterior of the outer wall also includes an engraved subtle set of eyes, the work of Eto Otitigbe.} They are derived from an image of Isabella Gibbons, an enslaved woman who was owned by professors at the university before emancipation and who went on to become an educator of freed African Americans. The following words of Gibbons are engraved on the memorial: \\"The Memorial is oriented tangent to two paths. The first path leads from the Memorial in the direction of the North Star, which for the enslaved led to freedom. The second path aligns with the sunset on March 3rd, which commemorates the day that Union troops emancipated the local enslaved community at the close of the Civil War. The communities of Charlottesville and the University will observe this important event through the newly instituted Liberation and Freedom Day March through the city.

Her research focuses on ribosomes and their function in translation. Green has also been a Howard Hughes Medical Institute investigator since 2000.  Early life and education  Green grew up near Cleveland, Ohio, where her mother was a chemistry teacher. Green intended to study engineering in college, but changed her major to chemistry, earning a B.S. from the University of Michigan in 1986. She then earned a PhD in biochemistry from Harvard University in 1992, in the lab of Jack Szostak, where she studied RNA. She did postdoctoral research at University of California Santa Cruz in the lab of Harry Noller, researching the function of the ribosome in E. coli.  Career  Green joined the faculty at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine in 1998. Green has also been a Howard Hughes Medical Institute investigator since 2000. In 2007 she became a full professor at Johns Hopkins. She was elected to the National Academy of Sciences in 2012, to the National Academy of Medicine in 2017, and to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 2019.  Research  The focus of Green's laboratory is defining the molecular mechanisms that affect that accuracy of translation in bacteria, yeast, and higher eukaryotic systems. After joining Johns Hopkins as a tenure-track assistant professor in 1998, Green began investigations into factors that control the translocation step of translation, where the ribosome moves forward over the messenger RNA (mRNA), prior to adding the next amino acid to the growing protein. Later, Green's research segued into studies on molecular factors and global mechanisms that affect translation accuracy. In particular, Green and her colleagues found that certain nucleotides in transfer RNA (tRNA) molecules affect the ability of the ribosome to determine and select the correct tRNA in each step of translation. Green's investigations into other aspects of translation quality control have included research into the mechanisms and effects of mRNA surveillance, in which mis-coded or nonfunctional mRNAs are subjected to degradation.  Personal life  Green's husband, Brendan Cormack, is also a geneticist at Johns Hopkins University. The couple has 3 children.

The young nobleman began his military life in Flanders. He entered combat for the first time in the Battle of Marciano that ended with the capture of Siena. Later he was destined to the fight in the African coasts against the Berbers. The next destination was the fight against the Rebellion of the Alpujarras against the rebellious Moriscos. After the conflict in the mountains of Granada, was already appointed as captain of a cavalry company to the surveillance of the coasts of Granada, to finally be appointed governor of the Alpujarras. Already as governor Berr√≠o marries Mar√≠a de Oru√±a, maternal niece of adelantado and lawyer Gonzalo Jim√©nez de Quesada. The latter, who died in 1579, in his will appoints Berrio and his wife as successors and heirs of their titles and assets. They receive the news by the Correo de las Indias in 1580, Berr√≠o is 53 years old and his life, which seemed to take a calmer course, returns to action. Upon his arrival in America, and as governor of Trinidad in 1580-1597, title inherited from his political uncle, the adelantado Gonzalo Jim√©nez de Quesada, founder of Bogot√° and one of the main characters among the conquistadores of New Granada, will continue with the work begun by him Antonio de Berrio organized several expeditions to Guiana Plateau in his search for the mythical El Dorado. Between 1583 and 1589 he carried out his first two expeditions, penetrating the hostile and wild regions of the Colombian plains and the Upper Orinoco.  First expedition  The expedition first took place on January 1, 1584. It counted 80 conquistadores and its route crossed Meta River and Tomo River to reach the Orinoco River and the foothills of the Guiana Shield. There he was stopped by rainy season, however, he learned about the existence of the city-state Man√µa, a legendary city of gold also known as El Dorado. After examining the west coast, he returned to Bogota in 1585. After this expedition, he moved to the estuary of the Orinoco River until (Trinidad) island.  Second expedition  In 1587 he went on a second expedition, lasting over two years. During this time, he investigated the western cliffs of the Guiana Plateau.  Third expedition  In 1590 he began his third expedition, managing to sail the Orinoco downstream until reaching the Caron√≠, that is when Berr√≠o believed he had found the step he was looking for on his way to El Dorado, but in order to continue with the expedition he needed men and food, therefore part towards the Margarita Island in March of 1591, before building the Santo Tom√© de Guayana fortress, founding site of the current Ciudad Guayana, two exact leagues from the right bank of the Caron√≠ River and take possession of the latter in the name of the king Philip II. Upon his arrival in Margarita, passing through Trinidad Island, which he considered a future good base for the following explorations, he was informed of the death of his wife. In 1595 Berr√≠o is 68 years old, has spent his formidable heritage on expeditions, neither the governor of Margarita Province nor that of Caracas wanted to help him with new adventures, so he resorts to the crown. Berrio waits anxiously in Trinidad for the arrival of 300 men and the food and money requested to continue his search for El Dorado.  Fourth expedition. Prisoner of Walter Raleigh.  In April of 1595 two ships arrive at the Margarita island, but they are not the requested reinforcements, they are two English ships under the command of Walter Raleigh, known by the Spaniards as Guaterral. Spain and England were not at war, but relations were tense. Raleigh also suffered El Dorado fever, even studying Spanish to be able to personally read the chronicles that were published in America about America, he himself recognizes in 1596 that he had known for many years the search for El Dorado. Raleigh has a plan and executes it, presents himself with a delegation for friendly purposes, and at the first opportunity assaults the city of San Jos√© de Oru√±a, founded by the lieutenant and commissioner of Berrio, Domingo de Vera Ibargoyen. The square defended by 28 soldiers is taken, taking as hostages Berrio and his lieutenant, Alvaro Jorge, after which Raleigh burns the city. His next act will be to try to locate El Dorado going up the Orinoco, with Berrio as a guide. Berrio took them through the territories already explored by him years ago, El Dorado still did not appear. The expedition of Raleigh returns to Trinidad and the liberation of Antonio de Berrio took place at the end of June of 1595 in the coasts of Cumana, in a prisoners exchange deal.Niall Ferguson Empire : How Britain Made the Modern World 416 pages Gardners Books 2002  Death and legacy  Antonio de Berrio died at age 70 in Santo Tom√© de Guayana, fortress founded by himself, in 1597, a few days after his son Fernando de Berr√≠o arrived with the reinforcements of troops, food and money he requested to continue with the search for the mythical El Dorado. El Dorado fever also severely affected his son, who would actively continue his search. As for Raleigh, he wrote a famous book of his days, entitled \\"Discovery of the great, rich and beautiful empire of Guayana\\" chronicle of his expedition with Berrio. Raleigh was only able to contribute the book, no gold, which earned him a death sentence by Jacobo I, successor of the deceased Isabel I, but execution was put on hold for an indefinite prison in the Tower of London. After twelve years of captivity, Raleigh regained his freedom, all this time did not serve to forget El Dorado, fever led him to make another expedition in his search that ended in failure and also broke the pact not to damage the Spanish possessions in the new world product of the new policy of alliance of England with Spain, which cost him his head at the hands of an executioner to satisfy the Spanish monarch Philip III on October 29, 1618.

Accessed through: World Register of Marine Species at: http://www.marinespecies.org/aphia.php?p=taxdetails&id;=532893 on 2019-04-25 Description The length of the shell attains 36 mm, its diameter 12 mm. (Original description) The rather large shell is solid, somewhat translucent, bluish white, with a comparatively smooth surface and little lustre. The spire is unusually high, consisting of nine angularly shouldered whorls below the small, very acute, chestnut-brown protoconch. The aperture is short and broad. The posterior sinus is as broad as the subsutural band and rather shallow. The outer lip is considerably inflated, curving gradually toward the columella without forming a decided siphonal canal. The columella is nearly straight, curved slightly anteriorly, with a narrow, closely adhering strip of enamel. The suture is distinct, undulating and slightly channelled. The subsutural band is rather broad, oblique, somewhat concave, ornamented on the upper whorls with hue, distinct, curved riblets and lines of growth, the latter alone being visible on the two lower whorls. Just above the periphery, at the edge of the subsutural band, very narrow, sharp, slightly raised, oblique ribs, separated by very wide, slightly concave spaces, cross the whorls to the suture, and on the body whorl disappear just below the sutural line of the aperture. These ribs are most conspicuous at the shoulder, and vary considerably in different specimens, changing from the above narrow, sharp ones, with wide interspaces, to others broad and rounded, With narrower interspaces, the number on the body whorl vary from twelve to fifteen. The entire surface, except the protoconch and the subsutural band, is cut by fine, shallow grooves separated by flattened spaces of unequal width. These are deeper and coarser, or broader, on the lower part of the body whorl and siphonal canal, causing the spaces between them to appear as raised rounded threads. The protoconch is long, very slender, consisting of four and a half finely reticulated light chestnut-brown whorls. The apical whorl is imperfect, but must have been very minute, judging from the size of the succeeding one.

Peter Armitage (born 1971) is an American physicist who is currently a Professor of Physics and Astronomy at The Johns Hopkins University. His research centers on understanding material systems which exhibit coherent quantum effects at low temperatures, like superconductors and quantum magnetism. His principal scientific interest is understanding how is it that large ensembles of strongly interacting, but fundamentally simple particles like electrons in solids act collectively to exhibit complex emergent quantum phenomena. He exploits and develops techniques using low frequency microwave and THz range radiation that probe these systems at their natural frequency scales. The material systems of interest require new measurement techniques as their relevant frequencies typically fall between the range of usual optical and electronic methods.  Career  Armitage received a BS degree from Rutgers University and a PhD from Stanford University in 2002. He did postdoctoral work at the University of California, Los Angeles and the University of Geneva. He joined the faculty of Johns Hopkins in 2006 as an assistant professor of physics and is currently a Professor of Physics and Astronomy. He is known primarily for is work on superconductivity, magnetism, disordered systems, and topological materials. Most recently his group succeeded in measuring the quantized magnetoelectric \\"axion\\" response of topological insulators.

The centre of the estate was the town of Jagdispur however the estate also covered neighbouring towns and villages. The estate was also protected by a fort. The court of Jagdishpur in the mid-19th century History The Jagdishpur estate was ruled by a branch of the Ujjainiya Rajputs. These Ujjainiyas claimed descent from the Paramara dynasty of Malwa and the Bhojpur region of Bihar was named after the Paramara King, Raja Bhoj. Sujan Sahi who was the son of Prabal Sahi Singh, was the first to take up residence in Jagdishpur in 1702. After being killed by the retainers of the Governors of Bihar, he was succeeded by his son Udwant Singh who was said to be well-trained in the use of weapons and an able administrator. Udwant Singh expanded his territories by invading neighbouring towns and villages controlled by neighbouring landowners. Upon hearing this, the governor of Bihar, Fakkhradaula invaded Jagdishpur but Udwant Singh defeated him. Udwant Singh also encouraged the Ujjainiyas to eat pork to prevent them converting to Islam. In his court, he patronised the poet, Mauli Kavi, who compiled the book Udwant Prakash in 1747. After much conflict and many years of struggle, Jagdishpur was finally be subdued by the Mughals after the death of Udwant Singh. Under the leadership of Dalpat Shahi in the 18th century, Jagdishpur became the principal military stronghold of the Ujjainiya clan. Mughal sources from the time note that the cavalry was the elite section of the Jagdishpur army and was considered to be superior to the infantry. 1857 rebellion During the rule of Kunwar Singh, the estate took part in the Indian Rebellion of 1857. Kunwar Singh was motivated to rebel after having financial difficulties due to the high revenue demanded by the British authorities and family litigation. The British also attempted to take over the management of the estate. As a result of this, Kunwar Singh (who was 80 at the time) decided to join the rebellion and was considered to be the leader of the rebellion in Bihar. He was helped by his brother, Babu Amar Singh and his commander-in-chief, Hare Krishna Singh. After some initial success, Kunwar Singh and his forces were eventually driven out of Jagdishpur by the British. A year later, Kunwar Singh died and the rebellion was led by his brother who was eventually captured and hanged. Because of these events, many consider Kunwar Singh to be one of the \\"greatest chiefs\\" of Jagdishpur.

It is the second of three planned provincial intermodal terminals for the south of Manila under a public-private partnership arrangement. Starting June 2019, the terminal will handle province-bound and incoming buses from Calabarzon and the Bicol Region, as well as other provincial buses plying the nautical highway in the south pending the completion of, and as an alternative to, the Taguig Integrated Terminal Exchange. Location SM City Santa Rosa The Santa Rosa Integrated Terminal is located on a former parking lot of SM City Santa Rosa, a shopping mall on the Manila South Road in Barangay Tagapo, adjacent to Santa Rosa's poblacion (Malusak) and close to the city's border with Bi√±an. It is directly connected to SM City Santa Rosa and is located just south of another shopping mall, Robinsons Santa Rosa. Nearby landmarks include Brent International School Manila, the United Laboratories pharmaceutical plant, Alonte Sports Arena, Robinsons Sta. Rosa, the Santa Rosa Sports Complex, and Santa Rosa de Lima Parish Church. The terminal is about north of the older Santa Rosa bus terminal in Balibago. The nearest rail transit station, the Santa Rosa railway station, is about midway between these two terminals. History The proposal for a second integrated terminal in the southeast of Metro Manila was first submitted in October 2016 by Santa Rosa Mayor Dan Fernandez. A site on the Bi√±an‚ÄìSanta Rosa Access Road was presented to Department of Transportation Secretary Arthur Tugade as an alternative to the Taguig Integrated Terminal Exchange. The proposed site was east of the South Luzon Expressway Greenfield City-Unilab (Mamplasan) Interchange, which will also be the terminus of the Cavite‚ÄìLaguna Expressway. It was modelled after an earlier contract signed in January 2016 for the South Integrated Transport System project also involving private investment. The Santa Rosa terminal is part of the Metropolitan Manila Development Authority plan to reduce traffic congestion in Metro Manila by taking some 3,000 to 4,000 southbound provincial buses off its busy streets.

In 1992, LRHRR organized a clinic to train more than 5,000 individuals to keep abortion protesters from interfering with clinics during Operation Rescue's abortion protests in the South Bronx. In 1997 and 1998, LRHRR led meetings with sixteen different women of color organizations about reproductive tract infections among women of color which started discussions about the need for a collective vision to promote research and reproductive justice advocacy for women of color.

The game is a crossover between Koei Tecmo's Dynasty Warriors and Atlus's Persona franchises, and is set six months after the events of Persona 5. It follows Joker and the rest of the Phantom Thieves of Hearts as they investigate a series of mysterious events involving people across Japan. It was released in Japan on February 20, 2020, with a worldwide release scheduled for later. Gameplay Persona 5 Scramble is a gameplay crossover between Koei Tecmo's hack and slash Dynasty Warriors series, and Atlus's role-playing game Persona series. It features elements from both franchises, such as the real-time action combat of the former with the turn-based Persona-battling aspect of the latter. Joker, the game's protagonist, is able to wield multiple Personas, which are gained through random drops or by defeating named mini-bosses in dungeons. These Personas can then be brought to the Velvet Room, where they can be fused to create new Personas. The Confidant system from Persona 5 is absent. In its place are Requests, a form of side-quests, and the B.A.N.D. system, where increasing its level can grant players bonuses such as stat increases. The B.A.N.D. levels can be increased through interacting with party members, winning battles, and hitting milestones throughout the game. Players can form an active party of maximum four members, with Joker being the only character not removable as an active party member. Outside of battle, active party members can be swapped with the standby party members. Players can only control Joker in the real world but are able to control any party member freely when exploring the story dungeons. Exploring dungeons is similar to Persona 5, where players can use stealth to avoid enemies or may occasionally face the need to solve puzzles to progress. The 'Third Eye' also makes a return from Persona 5, where it highlights enemies strength and interactive objects. Should the alert meter of the dungeon reach 100%, the party is forced to leave the dungeon. The Alert level can be lowered by winning battles that are initiated with surprise attacks or by leaving the dungeon. Unlike previous entries of the Persona series, leaving the dungeon does not progress time and there are generally no demerits in leaving the story dungeons. Battles are mostly initiated when the player character comes into contact with the enemy, where they can launch a surprise attack to gain a combat advantage if the enemy has not spotted them. Battles are also now in the form of a real-time combat system. However, players will use a command-based skills menu when using Persona skills. During the time in this menu, the battle will pause to allow tactical positioning of the Persona skills. If the party deals a critical damage or deals damage that the enemy is weak to, the enemy may be knocked down for an 'All-Out Attack' which deals a large amount of damage. All party members can obtain new moves, known as Master Arts, by controlling the characters manually and defeating enemies. If all active party members are knocked out in battle, the game ends.  Plot  The game is set six months after the events of Persona 5, The protagonist and Morgana return to Tokyo for a reunion with the other Phantom Thieves of Hearts to spend their summer vacation together on a camping trip. To determine the camping preparations, they use a popular application called EMMA. While going to Shibuya to buy the necessary tools, they pass by a rising idol, Alice Hiiragi, who gave the protagonist a card requesting them to input \\"Wonderland\\" into the EMMA app for her special event. Upon entering the keyword, however, he, Morgana and Ryuji are transported into a mysterious alternative version of Tokyo called a Jail, where they encounter the ruler called King who is Alice's Shadow self, and a sentient A.I. named Sophia who is able to fight Shadows who joins their party. They learn that EMMA, similar to the Metaverse Navigator, enables them to enter Jails. Hearing rumors that people have been attacked by Shadows in Jails that leaves them behaving strangely in the real world, Joker and his friends once again establish the Phantom Thieves of Hearts. After changing Alice's heart, they are approached by a police officer, Zenkichi Hasegawa, who is investigating the sudden bizarre changes of behavior in people around Japan with the Phantom Thieves as the prime suspect. Zenkichi forces them to make a deal with him: He will provide them with information necessary for their heists in exchange the Phantom Thieves help his investigation, which they reluctantly agree to. Accompanied by Zenkichi, the Phantom Thieves travel to Sendai and Sapporo, changing the corrupted hearts of the Jail's Kings. During their trip, they make a deal with a professor specializing in artificial intelligence, Kuon Ichinose, after eavesdropping and finding out that the protagonist and his friends are the Phantom Thieves. Later on, the Phantom Thieves learn that the head of the global IT Company called Madicce who developed EMMA, Akira Konoe, is misusing the app to manipulate people's hearts. He is supported by Jun Owada, a corrupt politician who once supported Masayoshi Shido, cooperating with Konoe to dispose the King of Okinawa's Jail and Zenkichi's wife. He uses his position to pin the blame on the Phantom Thieves and order for their arrest, deeming them terrorists for hacking into EMMA. Zenkichi's daughter, Akane Hasegawa, is made a King of Kyoto's Jail when asking the app to help her after Zenkichi's been arrested for treason. Entering Kyoto's Jail upon learning of Akane's situation, the Phantom Thieves, except Futaba, are captured by Shadow Akane. Futaba requests Zenkichi's help after he is freed from custody and confronts Shadow Akane, awakening his Persona, Valjean, in the process and officially joins the Phantom Thieves. They successfully save Akane, and then requests help from Kuon Ichinose to gain more information about EMMA and Madicce, eventually allowing them to enter Konoe's Jail in Osaka. Successfully changing Konoe's heart, the EMMA app is shut down and Madicce is disbanded following Konoe's arrest. However, the EMMA app suddenly restarts on its own, causing a massive blackout throughout Tokyo and emergence of a new Jail. Entering the Jail, they encounter Ichinose who reveals herself to be the true creator of EMMA: she sold it to Konoe so she can determine humanity's true desire. She also reveals that she created Sophia as a prototype of EMMA, but deemed her a failure and discarded her. She then commanded Sophia to attack the Phantom Thieves, but due to spending a lot of time with the Phantom Thieves and forming a bond with them, Sophia defied her creator's commands and proceeded to awaken her Persona, Pandora, to everyone's surprise. After convincing Ichinose to abandon EMMA, they learn that the application's true identity is the False God Demiurge, who believes that humanity's biggest wish is for a world free from crime and wrongdoing. It uses the EMMA app to manipulate people's hearts to take them to the Promised Land. With Ichinose's assistance, Futaba hacks into EMMA central server to send the calling card to reach Demiurge, allowing the Phantom Thieves to confront the false god and defeat it. With Demiurge's defeat, the EMMA app is finally shut down for good, erasing Jails from existence. In the aftermath, Owada is arrested thanks to Konoe's testimony, Zenkichi returns to Kyoto, and Sophia decides to go on a journey together with Ichinose. As their mission has ended, the Phantom Thieves once again go their separate ways, but promise that they'll meet again next winter.

Oldaker, Scenes from the Birds of Aristophanes, with Introduction, Notes, Vocabulary, and Appendices (Cambridge at the University Press, 1953) Headmaster The choir of Christ Church Cathedral, Oxford In 1938, Oldaker was appointed as Precentor of Christ Church, Oxford, a role which included serving as Master of the Christ Church Cathedral Choir School. He arrived there in September, quickly gaining the nickname of \\"Pip\\", believed to have been inspired by the name of a Daily Mail cartoon strip called \\"Pip, Squeak, and Wilfred\\", in which Pip was a dog.Richard Lane, Michael Lee, The History of Christ Church Cathedral School, Oxford (2017), pp. 52‚Äì57 He made big changes at his new school, joining the Incorporated Association of Preparatory Schools, which meant that all boys had to be prepared for the Common Entrance Examination. He began to appoint boys as prefects, which was new, and he also divided the school into houses, called Wolsey, Aldridge, and Carroll. He introduced the teaching of Ancient Greek and changed the name of the school slightly, insisting that the word \\"Choir\\" was not needed. In December 1939 he launched a school magazine called The Cardinal's Hat, including news of old boys. The greatest change he made was trebling the size of the school. On his arrival, the number of boarders was only nineteen, but a year later it was thirty-four, and by 1943 there were sixty-eight boys altogether. Oldaker was resisted in this enlargement by the Dean and Chapter, who did not want a larger prep school on their hands, but he was able to make use of the time- honoured prerogative of the Master of the school to be allowed to take private pupils, in addition to the Cathedral choristers. In 1941 Oldaker was the Orator for an annual lecture to the Curators and staff of the Bodleian Library, bringing with him the choristers. The lecture was then devoted in alternate years to the honouring of Sir Thomas Bodley and the encouragement of Hebrew studies, and Oldaker took on both.The Bodleian Library Record, Vol. 2 (1941), p. 94 Oldaker married Margaret J.

One reason for the move was believed in Oxford to be that the Dean and Chapter of Christ Church were giving him little support in his ambitious development plans.Lane & Lee (2017), p. 64The Public and Preparatory Schools Year Book Year Book Press Limited, 1954), pp. 100, 103 In 1946 Oldaker wrote to Country Life from Sturry about the tithe barn there, which was 160 feet long, asking \\"And can anyone tell us where the largest tithe barn is?\\" The editor replied that this was \\"the gigantic barn at Abbotsbury, 276 ft. long.\\"Country Life, Vol. 100 (1946), p. 80 While at Sturry, Oldaker and his wife lived in the manor house until moving into a cottage in the grounds, so that the main house could be used to expand the school.

Between 1753 and 1754 a new wooden bell tower was erected and the bells and clock from the old tower were installed in it. Design and construction The church was built as part of the development of the main entrance to the monastery from Nevsky Prospect. Designed by architect Ivan Starov in 1783, it envisaged a wall marking the boundary of the monastery, with access through a gate church, decorated with Doric pilasters and topped with a low dome. Construction of the church took place from 1784 to 1785 under the auspices of M. E. Melentyev, with the interior finishing carried out between autumn 1785 and spring 1786. By one account the icons were brought from the private chapel of Prince Grigory Potemkin.

Flowers of sulfur (FOS) testing was developed to determine the porosity of metallic coatings susceptible to sulfur induced corrosion [see below ASTM B809-95(2018)]. Applicable substrates are silver, copper, copper alloys and any other metal or metal alloy with which sulfur will react. For porosity testing, coatings can be single or multiple layers of any metal that is not corroded and sealed by a self-limiting reaction in the reducing sulfur environment of the FOS test. The simplest recommended technique is to identify any porosity of the coating as revealed by the presence of surface spots. These surface spots form where the environmental sulfur has penetrated and reacted with the base metal, producing a metal sulfide. Chalcocite, copper (I) sulfide is dark-grey to black. Silver (I) sulfide is also grey-black. The adoption of lead-free solders and lead-free soldering motivated the further development and application of immersion silver plating. Immersion silver improves wettability and solderability.Wang, Weiqiang, Anupam Choubey, Michael H. Azarian and Michael Pecht, (2009). An Assessment of Immersion Silver Surface Finish for Lead-Free Electronics, Journal of Electronic Materials, Vol. 38(6), 815-827 Mixed flowing gas testing failed to alert the electronics manufacturing industry to weaknesses in immersion silver plating (for example, see Reference 7). This furthered the application of FOS. In particular, it was determined that moist, high-sulfur environments facilitated creep corrosion.Schueller, Randy, (2008). Creep Corrosion on Lead-Free Printed Circuit Boards in High Sulfur Environments, SMTA Journal, Vol. 21(1), pp 21-29 The development of FOS testing for creep corrosion was furthered by efforts under the auspices of the International Electronics Manufacturing Initiative (INEMI) and the Surface Mount Technology Association (SMTA) by Haley Fu, et al.Fu, Haley, Prabjit Singh and Jing Zhang, (2014).

The powdered sulfur is placed in a dish. The temperature and internal humidity of the container are regulated. Temperature is typically controlled by placing the container in a constant temperature oven. Humidity inside the container is typically controlled with a saturated salt solution whose vapor pressure is well characterized at the temperature of the test.Greenspan, Lewis, (1977). Humidity Fixed Points of Binary Saturated Aqueous Solutions, Journal of Research of the National Bureau of Standards - A. Physics and Chemistry, Vol. 81(1), pp 89-96 Saturated potassium nitrate solution is standard practice for humidity control in humid sulfur vapor testing. The saturated salt solution is placed physically outside of the sulfur containing dish. The sulfur containing dish may ‚Äúfloat‚Äù in the saturated salt solution. The dish should provide an ample, available powdered sulfur surface. Recommended materials for the test chamber are glass and acrylic. The materials under test must be suspended or supported above the saturated salt solution. Suspension materials are also recommended fabricated from glass or plastic. Frames made out of 316 stainless steel have seen use for hanging specimens. Monofilament line has been used for hanging objects under test. Recommended specimen placement is at least 75 mm from the surfaces of the sulfur and the saturated salt solutions, at least 25 mm from all internal vessel surfaces and at least 10 mm spacing from specimen to specimen. Standard test procedures call for performing the specimen exposure at 50 ¬∞C for at least 24 hours. Activity of the sulfur and its products with humid air increase with temperature. Exposure periods can be extended into the week range. Decisions on length of exposure is commonly motivated by observations from shorter-term tests. Standard procedure calls for equilibrating the test chamber at temperature and relative humidity before inserting the test specimens. Porosity results are determined by the distribution, number and sizes of dark spots on the materials under test. Again, the dark spots are due to reaction of the moist sulfur vapors with the underlying silver or copper material. One may choose to include silver or both silver and copper reference coupons into the humid sulfur test. The accumulation of copper(I) sulfate and silver (I) sulfate deposits on the coupons, determined by weight change, allows comparisons to ISA 71.04 severity levels for mixed flowing gas testing.ANSI/ISA-71.04-2013 Environmental Conditions for Process Measurement and Control Systems: Airborne Contaminants, The International Society of Automation, Research Triangle Park, NC Cleaned silver coupon exposed to flowers of sulfur for five days at 50 ¬∞C over saturated potassium nitrate solution (engraved with sample number).

The settlement - known nowadays as Dimeh es-Seba (), possibly meaning ¬´Dimeh of the lions¬ª - was an important religious center with an imposing temple dedicated to the god Soknopaios, an oracular god in shape of a crocodile with falcon head, from which the toponym of the town itself derived. According to papyrological evidence Soknopaiou Nesos was founded in the 3rd century BCE, during the land reclamation project of the Faiyum carried out by the first Ptolemies, and was abandoned in mid 3rd century CE. The archaeological evidence instead, releases new data about a late reoccupation of the site, concentrated especially inside the area of the main temple of the town, during the 4th-5th centuries until the end of the Byzantine period.  Name  Soknopaiou Nesos means ¬´The island of Soknopaios¬ª, a contraction of the longer Egyptian name t»ù m»ùy Sbk nb Pay p»ù n·πØr  ø»ù, ¬´The Island of Sobek, the lord of Pai, the great god¬ª . Soknopaios is the local Hellenistic variant of Sobek, the main god of the Faiyum region.  Description of the site  View of the site from North West The archaeological area of the settlement (kom) has an oval shape measuring 660 m N-S and 350 m E-W and it is crossed by a paved dromos 400 m long. The main archaeological evidence is the monumental light-grey mud-brick temenos to the North-West, with walls preserved in some points up to 15 m in height, having an irregular rectangular plan. Inside this enclosure several buildings are still recognizable, mainly built in mud bricks as well as in stone masonry. = The temenos and the main temple = The most important building is the main temple, located in the middle of the temenos, which hosted beside Soknopaios the synnaoi theoi, like Isis Nepherses and Soknopiais. The temple is formed by two, contiguous sanctuaries built on the same North-South axis, aligned with the dromos. The two buildings formed one temple in the Roman period and were connected by an open-air courtyard. The former, to the South, is pretty well preserved and is built with brown limestone irregular stones and mud bricks; it has been interpreted as the earliest temple built at the beginning of the Hellenistic period. The latter, to the North, was badly dismantled since the end of Byzantine period and is preserved for only 1.60 m in height. It is built in regular yellow limestone blocks and is thought to be a late Ptolemaic or early Roman addition and became the sanctuary for the worship of the gods, while the building to the South became a sort of propylon. The North temple was restored probably in the first half of the 2nd century CE. A monumental contra-temple was built against its rear wall during the 1st century CE and then remodeled in the 2nd century. A remarkable, stone architectural model of the contra-temple in scale 1:20 was found inside it. Within the temenos area are several mud-brick structures: priests‚Äô houses, workshops, administrative buildings, small temples and chapels. Outside of the temenos, to the North, East and West of it, several buildings in mud brick and rough local stones are still visible. The temenos walls from South East = The town and the dromos = A monumental evidence in the settlement is a paved dromos, 6-7 m wide and preserved for 329 m, built on a platform 3 meters high. It was intended as a processional road, connecting the temple‚Äôs southern entrance with a staircase, and dividing the settlement into an eastern and western quarter. Statues of lions and possibly two kiosks were erected on it. Some stairs and two tunnels allowed people to pass from East to West quarter of this imposing barrier that formed a tremendous stage for the ritual processions during more than 150 days of feasts a year. It is the result of different building phases, being extended toward South as far as the settlement expanded in the Roman period. The paved dromos looking North  Archaeological investigation  The site of Soknopaiou Nesos was known already at the beginning of the 19th century, when it has been visited by G.B. Belzoni (1819). Few years later, J.G. Wilkinson visited the site and provided the first topographical plan of the settlement ever drawn. In 1843 K.R. Lepsius, during his Prussian campaign in Egypt, spent two days in Dime, executing a plan of the site as well as some excellent and very well detailed drawings. From the second half of the 19th century Soknopaiou Nesos has been subject of many excavations carried out either by official missions or, what is the most common case, by robbers looking for antiquities to sell at the art market. The site became famous at the end of the 19th century for the great number and well preserved papyri from Ptolemaic to Roman periods. = 1890 = The first excavations attested are those of Ali Farag, a dealer from Giza, who discovered in 1890 a great number of papyri as well as twenty statues. Many of these papyri entered the main European museums‚Äô collections. In 1892 Major R.H. Brown, trying to define the ancient level of Lake Qarun, dug a trench next to the dromos with the aim of reaching its bottom. Therefore, he was convinced that the dromos was a quay and that Dime was originally located on the shore of Lake Qarun. = 1900-01 = B.P Grenfell and A.S. Hunt carried out an excavation campaign for the EEF looking for papyri and cartonnages. They discovered the necropoleis that stretches from North to South towards West of the settlement and testified to the absence of the lake near the dromos. = 1909-10 = An archaeological mission organized by the Berlin K√∂niglichen Museen, directed by F. Zucker in collaboration with W. Schubart, carried out excavations at Soknopaiou Nesos. The German scholars dug in several places of the site with the only aim of finding papyri. = 1914 = Ahmed Kamal Bey carried out a two weeks excavation in the temple on behalf of an Asyut antiquities dealer. =1925-26 = G. Caton-Thompson and E.W. Gardner carried out geo-archaeological studies in the area around Dime, aiming to study the ancient Qarun lake's level as well as the agricultural landscape of the Hellenistic and Roman periods. They also investigated the southern edge of the dromos, demonstrating quite convincingly that this road was not used in ancient times as a quay but as a normal alley connecting the two extremities of the town. = 1931-32: The University of Michigan excavations = In a three-months season, the University of Michigan carried out the first excavation executed in Dime with a scientific method, under the direction of A.E.R. Boak and E.E. Peterson. The research was focused on two areas of the settlement, to the East and to the West of the dromos, excavating well preserved mud-brick buildings and identifying three main occupation phases from the 3rd century BCE to the mid 3rd century C.E. The results of these excavations suggest that at the moment of the foundation of the settlement the houses followed an orthogonal plan oriented on the dromos. This orientation was maintained in the following phases during which the settlement expanded considerably. The University of Michigan team was based for about ten years (1924-1934) in Kom Aushim/Karanis where they carried out extensive excavation seasons. The materials found were divided, according to the law, between Cairo Egyptian Museum and the University of Michigan (at present in the Kelsey Museum of Archaeology, Ann Arbor) .https://lsa.umich.edu/kelsey/research/past- field-projects/dime-soknopaiou-nesos-egypt.html Kelsey Museum (University of Michigan) field projects web site = The Soknopaiou Nesos Project = Since 2004 the Soknopaiou Nesos Project of the University of Salento (Centro di Studi Papirologici) has been working in Soknopaiou Nesos under the direction of M.Capasso and P.Davoli. Beside the archaeological excavations, mainly carried out inside the temenos, the team surveyed the settlement and the surroundings. Evidence of pre- Ptolemaic buildings were found below the temple, as well as to the North and West of the kom. On the shores of a palaeo-lake several areas with pottery clusters of the 19th and the 26th dynasties have been documented.

Its tagline is Queer, Inclusive, Badass. The organization is the largest LGBTQ technology community in the world, with 50,000 LGBTQ women, non-binary people, people of color and allies in tech in over 42 cities worldwide.  History  The community was started based on a small meet up in the Castro Theatre in San Francisco in December 2012. By the end of 2013, small events were launched in New York, Seattle, Boston, Los Angeles, London, Berlin and Toronto and the community had nearly 4,000 people. In October 2013, the Lesbians Who Tech website was launched. The first official Lesbians Who Tech Summit was held in February 2014 in San Francisco. In June 2015, Lesbians Who Tech was awarded a $165,000 grant from the Arrillaga-Andreessen Foundation, starting a nonprofit arm of Lesbians Who Tech. The grant money was used for two pilot programs; \\"Bring a Lesbian to Work Day\\" and coding scholarship fund. = Community Inclusion = Lesbians Who Tech is committed to convening queer women in technology (and allies) in a vibrant and inclusive community. The term lesbian is used to honor those who crossed a firewall with it, it is not a requirement to identify as lesbian, bisexual, transgender, or queer to be part of the organization. The only requirement is to follow the organization's mission and goals; promote the visibility and inclusion of women, LGBT people, and people from other back-grounds under-represented in technology.  Mission  Lesbians Who Tech's mission is to increase visibility and intersectionality, and change the face of technology. Their mission is to create a culture of inclusion for everyone in order to encourage oneself and others to be influential and make positive changes in their work environment. Lesbians Who Tech embodies four main goals; (1) to be more visible to each other, (2) to be more visible to others, (3) to get more lesbians and allies into technology, and (4) to connect Lesbians Who Tech to other LGBTQ and Women's organization who are already doing work for the community. Lesbians Who Tech aims to build a network of colleagues, associates, and friends in the industry that share the same sexual orientation, in order to help make comfortable connection within the work space. The organization aims to create more visible lesbian leaders that have the ability to serve as public role models besides the already famous lesbian role model (such as Ellen DeGeneres). As women are still underrepresented in technology industry, Lesbians Who Tech aims to reach out to women, especially lesbians, and encourage their contributions to technology. Additionally, the organization promises to support other groups who are fighting for the same right (women and LGBTQ rights) and raise awareness of their work, while connecting these organization to women in the tech community. = Bring a Lesbian to Work Day = Participants are matched with mentors in the tech field for a one-day on-site program focused on showing them what it takes to be leaders in whatever field they're interested in. Pittsford's goal is to encourage building relationships where people are comfortable with each other. = Edie Windsor Coding Scholarship Fund = Named after the LGBTQ and technology legend Edie Windsor, the Edie Windsor Coding Scholarship Fund provides opportunity for future generations of LGBTQ, technical women, and non-binary and trans individuals. The scholarship was funded through a Kickstarter campaign, pledging more than $100,000 towards educating 15 women. The bootcamp sponsor, Dev Bootcamp, kicked in another $100,000 in scholarship funds. Lesbians Who Tech continues the process to raise money in order to provide more queer women with learning opportunities. The more money raised through private and public donors, the more individuals can be educated. The scholarship subsidizes tuition for women and non-binary individuals who need financial assistance to attend coding academies. Through an application process the next round of coding scholars is determined. Each scholar as the chance to choose and apply to the coding school or bootcamp of their choice. In addition to tuition coverage, scholars are also provided with a network of lifelong mentors for support throughout their career  Summits  All 3-day summits kick off with an opening address, tech crawl, and networking parties. Content sessions and more will begin the following day, and continue on for the remainder of the summit. Summits also include: * TED Style Talks * Ignite Talks * Speed Mentoring * Recruiting Zone Workshops * Tech Demos * Recruiting & Retention Sessions All Summits manage to pass the Bechdel Test. All Summits cover topics like top technical trends, how technology will shape the future, career growth, to encourage the community to grow and thrive. = Noteworthy Summits = The first White House's LGBT Tech and Innovation Summit took place in July 2014 with the aim to explore how technology can be used to end discrimination. Technology and LGBT community leaders were invited to generate answers to some of the major issues the United States is facing, including racial and economic justice, criminal justice reforms, economic inclusion, climate and citizenship. The event had over 150 participants, and was opened by Aditi Hardiker of the White House Office of Public Engagement. The sixth-annual Lesbians Who Tech + Allies Summit was the largest LGBTQ event in the world. The three day event took place in San Francisco and started on February 28th and lasted till March 2nd 2019\\\\. The attendees were roughly 80 percent queer women. Of those who spoke on stage, half were women of color, 30 percent were black or Latinx, and 15 percent transgender or gender non-conforming. = Noteworthy Speakers = Black Lives Matter co-founder Alicia Garza, U.S. Senator Tammy Baldwin, former Georgia gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams, San Francisco Mayor London Breed, and Emerson Collective founder Laurene Powell Jobs have given speeches at Lesbians Who Tech + Allies Summits. Among many others, further noteworthy speakers include Hillary Clinton, Stacey Abrams, Sheryl Sandberg and Marc Benioff.

Trained as a naval architect, he served in the French Navy during the Second World War and, after the Fall of France, as a spy for the French intelligence services. Bertony was captured twice by the Germans and imprisoned in concentration camps and successfully escaped both times. He was awarded the Croix de Guerre for his bravery and emigrated to Australia after the war. Bertony worked as a civil engineer and played a key role in designing the temporary works that allowed construction of the Sydney Opera House sails. This entailed making more than 30,000 manual calculations with an accuracy of . Subsequent computer checks showed that he had not made a single error. In later life he worked on wind turbine projects and as a mentor to young engineers.  Early life and war service  Bertony was born in Corsica, France on 14 March 1922. His mother died soon after the birth and he was sent by his father to be brought up by an aunt and uncle. Bertony developed an interest in mathematics and studied naval engineering at Saint-Tropez. Following the outbreak of the Second World War he joined the French Navy. Whilst there Bertony's intelligence was recognised and he was recruited as a spy. Shortly after he began his work in intelligence he was detected and captured by the Germans, who imprisoned him in the Mauthausen-Gusen concentration camp complex in Austria. He was put to work as a forced labourer but managed to escape as a result of an administrative error made by the guards whilst he was being transported. Bertony resumed his work undercover but was arrested in Paris and sent to Buchenwald concentration camp. He was forced to make use of his technical skills, working in an underground factory producing V-1 flying bombs and V-2 rockets. Though he had little choice but to comply, Bertony remained ashamed of his role in producing these weapons for the rest of his life. The forced labourers received very little food, being lucky to receive a loaf of bread per day between five men. Bertony had a good metabolism and would often give his allocation to other prisoners, angering the SS guards. He was sometimes put to work on farms where he was designated a \\"carotenfuhrer\\", a prisoner with responsibility for guarding silos of carrots. The prisoners were prohibited from eating the crops they harvested, and during this time Bertony survived by eating boiled grass. As \\"carotenfuhrer\\" if Bertony allowed a prisoner to eat the carrots, which he did many times, both he and the prisoner would be stripped and flogged. Towards the end of the war, in 1945 with US forces approaching, the prisoners from Mauthausen-Gusen were marched to the German-Czech border and loaded onto a cattle train. They were then taken to a remote spot to be executed by shooting. Bertony anticipated this and escaped the train in the company of another man. The two men endured ten days in the snow with no food and clad only in their thin camp uniforms. They survived to be rescued and became firm friends for the rest of their lives. Bertony was awarded the Croix de Guerre by the French government for his actions during this escape.  Sydney Opera House  Sydney Opera House under construction in 1966 Bertony moved to Australia in 1953 to work at the uranium mines at Rum Jungle, Northern Territory. At the time Australia operated a scheme that allowed European citizens permanent residency if they secured work in the country for two years. Bertony was given a job at Hornibrook, a construction company famous for its work on bridges, that satisfied this requirement. During the early 1960s Bertony worked on the construction of the Sydney Opera House. The building's design with a number of large \\"sails\\" made up of 22,194 pre-cast concrete segments proved challenging to construct. The segments were to be fixed in position with epoxy resin and Bertony determined that a temporary steel \\"erection arch\\" falsework would be required to support the structure in the temporary condition. Bertony settled on a mobile telescopic truss system and completed the 30,000 necessary calculations by hand in six months. The structure, which had no flat elements, was complex, and the margin of error required was . The calculations had to be checked for safety, and this was carried out by computer. The only machine in the country powerful enough to do so was the IBM 7090 at the Long Range Weapons Establishment at Woomera. This was only available during night time for one week in every month. One of Bertony's colleagues, David Evans, operated the computer and reported that no errors were found in Bertony's calculations. Evans later stated that Bertony's work had greatly helped the construction programme and claimed that \\"it would have taken many minds and many rounds of trial and error, and a much longer time and a much bigger budget, to get those ribs in the air if Joe hadn't been there\\". Sydney Opera House chief executive Louise Herron also stated \\"Bertony was a genius. Without him, the spectacular sails might never have become a reality\\".  Later life  After the Opera House, Bertony worked on other projects in Sydney including the Roseville Bridge in the Middle Harbour and the Pheasant's Nest Bridge over the Nepean River. Bertony donated the calculation sheets from his time on the Opera House to the Museum of Applied Arts and Sciences, and they are now held as part of the Powerhouse Museum collection. Bertony later ran calculations to prove that an earlier, more ambitious model for the opera house, one which had flatter concrete sails, had also been technically possible. In the 1990s he worked with a Scottish company to design a vertical axis wind turbine design and at the time of his death was working on a Scottish wind farm scheme.  Personal life  Bertony's wife was a pianist and physiotherapist at Hornibrook. They had no children and she died in 2016. Bertony was a lover of French food and dined out regularly in Sydney's restaurants. He also held a keen interest in electric vehicles and helped to mentor young engineers. Bertony died at his home in Sydney on 7 April 2019.
