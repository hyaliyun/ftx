The H√¥tel d'Astorg et de Saint-Germain in Toulouse, France, is a Renaissance h√¥tel particulier (palace) of the 16th and 17th centuries. History The Hotel d'Astorg and Saint Germain is located at 16, rue des Changes, in the historical center of Toulouse and was built between 1550 and 1570 for the Capitoul Guillaume de Saint-Germain, then reworked by the captain Jean d'Astorg. Description H√¥tel d'Astorg-Saint- Germain stands on one of the major arteries of Renaissance Toulouse, a road which was known in the Roman period as the Cardo maximus (north-south road) ans linked Saint-Sernin basilica, the Capitole and the parliament. Built in the late sixteenth century, the h√¥tel retains much of the old merchant house.Explanatory comments of Toulouse Renaissance exhibition (2018), Colin Debuiche. In 1568 the merchant Jean Astorg rebuilt part of the house. The building overlooking the street comprised, on the ground floor, a series of shops and a side door which opened onto a covered passage which, in turn, gave access to the main courtyard, the latter having a ceremonial purpose rather than a practical one. Unusually, this h√¥tel retains both its outside wooden staircases and the passageways which led to the buildings around the courtyard. While wood was a common building material in the Renaissance, few decorated examples (moulded balusters, facing scrolls) have survived to the present day. High windows For a long time attributed solely to Guillaume de Saint-Germain, the house was in truth partially built by the burgher Jean Astorg. The latter belonged to the financial elite who were regularly sought out by the capitouls in period of crisis (war efforts). For the decoration of his new building at the back of the courtyard he decided to imitate the windows of his neighbour Pierre Delpech. Such imitation was prevalent throughout the century, and amounted to honorific appropriation. These windows possess impressive frames, known as chambranle √† crossettes, supported by four short pilasters. The latter, adhering to the principles of manneristic aesthetic founded on surprise, do not play a structural role but instead appear to be suspended and dependant on the frame they should, by rights, be supporting.

There have been numerous attempts at breeding aurochs-like cattle. The first attempt was by the Heck brothers in Germany, producing the first aurochs-like breed of cattle, the Heck cattle. In 1996, a conservation group in Germany crossbred Heck cattle with southern- European primitive breeds with the aim of increasing the aurochs-likeness of certain Heck cattle herds. The resulting crossbreeds are called Taurus cattle. The Tauros Programme is currently trying to DNA-sequence breeds of primitive cattle to find gene sequences that match those found in \\"ancient DNA\\" from aurochs samples. The Uruz Project is a more recent attempt to bring back the aurochs, with the exception being that instead of selectively breeding cattle to resemble the aurochs, it is planning to make use of genome editing. *Tarpan: A subspecies of wild horse that went extinct in 1909. Much the like the aurochs, there have been many attempts to breed tarpan-like horses, the first being by the Heck brothers, creating the Heck horse as a result. Though it is not a genetic copy, it is claimed to bear many similarities to the tarpan. Other attempts were made to create tarpan-like horses. A breeder named Harry Hegardt was able to breed a line of horses from American Mustangs.

This h√¥tel was built around 1540. Portal and windows of Nicolas Bachelier in the courtyard. During the 1562 riots the building was badly damaged requiring considerable restoration. History Circa 1540, Guillaume de Bernuy, son of the famous woad merchant Jean de Bernuy, undertook the renovation of an old house by employing the famous architect and sculptor Nicolas Bachelier. From 1540 to 1544 Bachelier built a main house with two floors, which separated the courtyard from the garden and which stood at right angles with another building. Its staircase, as Bachelier previously did at H√¥tel de Bagis, is straight and contained within the building. Its fa√ßade is remarkable for its monumental door, windows and a truncated dormer window. In keeping with the logic of mediaeval honour, the walls are capped with decorative machicolationExplanatory comments of Toulouse Renaissance exhibition (2018), Colin Debuiche.. Bachelier focused his efforts on the windows, also he lent more attention to the monumental door, a veritable bravura passage replacing the staircase tower in its symbolic significance. These windows display the same classical style that Bachelier developed for H√¥tel de Bagis in 1538, but the upper and lower section of the frames gained in sophistication through the use of tables decorated with masks and grotesques. The motifs resemble the ornaments of Francis I Gallery in Fontainebleau Palace, that were being highly appreciated in the kingdom at that time. Designs also circulated within the bounds of the city, as demonstrated by the desire of 'classical windows' and the fact that the masks on this house were repeated on the consoles of the H√¥tel d'Ass√©zat passageway.

It generally describes a Chinese religious statue, object (such as joss paper), or idol in many Chinese folk religions. Etymology The English designation \\"joss\\" first appeared in the 18th century as a reference to a Chinese idol. The term is usually explained as a borrowing from Portuguese deus, deos 'god'.For instance, The main objection to this rather uncorroborated connection with Portuguese deus/deos, is that it does not address the linguistic routes that would have allegedly led to the appearance of \\"joss\\", with its Chinese religious connotation. Most likely, the English form does describe an actual Chinese divinity, viz. the Di Zhu Shen 'Landlord Deity' ( Âú∞‰∏ªÁ•û), being the tutelary deity of the land (and heaven) and its inhabitants. Known under various epithets and names, this paternal god, who confers luck and wealth to his loyal worshippers, occupies a central position in the folk beliefs of many (overseas) Chinese communities. A similar form is also attested in Dutch as \\"joos\\" or \\"josie\\", which is a taboo form for the devil (often \\"corrected\\" to the less offensive sounding, personal name Joost). This was already noticed by Samuel Hull Wilcocke who translated the travelogues of the Dutch captain and explorer, John Splinter Stavorinus., to which he added the following remark in a footnote: \\"The images which the Chinese worship, are called joostje by the Dutch and joss by the English seamen. The latter is evidently a corruption of the former, which, being a Dutch nickname for the devil, was probably given to these idols by the Dutch who first saw them.\\". The slight difference in transcription of the English and Dutch forms perhaps reflects the pronunciation of the different Chinese linguistic communities settled in the East-Indies: Dutch \\"joostje\\", with its initial palatal approximant [j] appears to reflect a Hokkien pronunciation, whereas the English \\"joss\\", with initial j- [dÕ° í] may go back to a form borrowed from the Hakka language.  Uses  Josses serve multiple functions in traditional Chinese religious customs, varying by the specific tradition. Although the word directly translates to ‚Äúgod‚Äù, the term ‚Äújoss‚Äù is used to describe a physical statue that is believed to be the dwelling place of a specific deity. Josses are often decorated with golden plaques, which are given by the worshippers as a sign of reverence and respect. Josses are used as a symbolic representation of a particularly important god or goddess. They are often used as a means of divination. Depending upon the tradition, josses will be found in family homes, be communally shared and appear in temples across China and Taiwan. =Taiwanese tradition= Josses belong to specific villages and are considered to be owned by the village temple. Most josses are passed throughout the homes of the village where they reside for a time. The temple altars host at least one Joss, which represents the village's main god. Josses will be placed at the center of an altar in the worshipper's home where they make offerings to them and are used to communicate to the deity. =Southern China tradition= Statues of deities, such as Guanyin (the goddess of mercy) and Guangong (the god of justice) are placed on altars in every new business and restaurant. Josses play an important role in ritual ceremonies. The spiritualization ceremony for new temples involves inviting the spirits into statues made of clay, and in doing so creates a joss. If the invitation ceremony is successful, the spirit lives inside the statue indefinitely. Significantly more women than men visit the temples and make offerings to the josses. Different deities in the temples have their own special abilities and characteristics. Many worshippers will have josses of a particular deities that can bring about good health or good fortune at home at work.

The phrase Pearl of Africa is attributed to Winston Churchill who used it to describe Uganda's flora and fauna. Overview and Synopsis In 2014, when the protagonist and her lover decide to settle down quietly, Uganda passed a homophobic law; later in the year, a Ugandan tabloid, Red Pepper outed Kambugu which eventually forced the lovers to flee Uganda. In Sweden, director Johnny von Wallstroem was producing a film about a gay Ugandan refugee. However, the protagonist of the film had cold feet when he feared that his family in Uganda could be harmed. Wallstroem then traveled to Uganda to research stories about LGBT individuals who were committed to express themselves publicly. He was introduced to Kambugu who initially hesitated but decided to publicly express herself and her gender identity in front of a camera. Both individuals initially collaborated on a 7 part web series, The Pearl of Africa which led to the process of producing a documentary. The documentary tells the story of Kambugu, who was born male but transitioned into the woman she always wanted to be despite the hostility and trans-phobia in her country. It also covers the relationship between Kambugu, who is a trans activist and her lover Nelson, a straight man and their struggles and love for one another.

An officer with the newly-founded Royal African Corps, Grant negotiated the purchase of St Mary's Island in the Gambia River from the King of Kombo in 1816, following the end of the Napoleonic Wars. The island was the first settlement in what would later become the Gambia Colony and Protectorate. During his time as commandant, Grant founded the town of Bathurst on the island, which later became Banjul and the capital city of The Gambia as an independent country. Grant also purchased MacCarthy Island, further down the Gambia River, and founded on it Georgetown - now Janjanbureh - as a settlement for freed slaves. Grant was knighted in 1821, and served as Acting Governor of Sierra Leone from 1820 to 1821, and again later in 1821. He returned to Britain in 1826, and died a year later from illness.  Early military service  Grant joined the army in 1804 and was posted to the 2nd West India Regiment. He was immediately given the option of serving with the Royal African Corps, which he took up, and remained in Africa until 1825.  Commandant of St Mary's Island  = Establishment of Bathurst = Following the Treaty of Paris in 1814, which ended the war with France and the War of 1812 with the United States, the British evacuated Gor√©e, in what is now Senegal. This meant the Gambia once again assumed importance as the nearest harbour and colony to Britain situated on the West African coast. It, therefore, became necessary that the British rebuild their forts and make other arrangements to accommodate the influx of troops and officials from Gor√©e. Sir Charles MacCarthy, the Governor of Sierra Leone, dispatched Captain Alexander Grant, who at the time was an officer with the 2nd West India Regiment and was attached to the Royal African Corps. Grant took with him a detachment of 75 soldiers of the Royal African Corps to establish whether it would be feasible to create a military stronghold on the Gambia River. At first, it was intended that Grant would rebuild Fort James, but the lack of room on the island led to Grant being asked to explore other options. Lieutenant Colonel Thomas Brereton, the Governor of Senegal, approved the sandy pit at the extreme point of Banjulo, \\"probably more from a strategic view than a sanitary one\\" as it was battered by the Atlantic waves, had a mangrove swamp behind it, but also commanded the mouth of the Gambia River. On 23 April 1816, Grant signed a treaty with the King of Kombo, Tomani Bojang. The treaty stipulated the lease of the island for an annual payment by the British of 103 iron bars, the equivalent of ¬£25 at the time. Brereton aided Grant in this negotiation. Following its lease, the island was renamed from Banjulo to St Mary's Island. The houses, barracks, stores, factories, forts and other buildings were built around the crescent-shaped sandbank and gradually the land behind was partly reclaimed. The barracks on the island could hold 80 soldiers and house six cannons. The town was drained with tidal sluices to prevent the flooding of the town by sea water. This new capital on St Mary's Island was initially called Leopold, but the name was shortly afterwards changed to Bathurst by MacCarthy, under whom the town was designed. The name was taken from Earl Bathurst, who was then the Secretary of State for War and the Colonies. A modern-day map of the Gambia showing Bathurst (Banjul) and Georgetown. = Further growth = Gun batteries were laid out on Barra Point, Fort St Mary, and in Bathurst for the purposes of defence. As to commerce, the British merchants in Senegal were forced to leave when the Treaty of Paris was ratified and, with some French traders who preferred to trade under the British flag, emigrated to St Mary's Island. They built a number of factories and houses there which remained for many decades. The influx of traders marked a return to prosperity for the Gambia, that had flagged during the British occupation of Senegal. Building Bathurst was complicated by the fact that St Mary's Island was infested with mosquitoes and liable to be flooded regularly. By 1821, a barracks, hospital, and courthouse had all been constructed. Grant also began the practice of sending blue books from the Gambia between 1819 and 1823. The Governor of Sierra Leone was given responsibility for St Mary's Island in 1821. The home government back in Britain decided that the colony would have to be maintained by the revenue it made from customs duties in all areas besides defence. MacCarthy toured West Africa in 1822, and commented that the improvement of commerce in Bathurst was greater than in any other location that he visited. Grant, as commandant, used his forces to stop the riverine slave trade and also to encourage the activities of the Society of Friends and the Wesleyan Church. In 1818, Gaspard Th√©odore Mollien, a French explorer, explored the sources of the Gambia River, Senegal River and the most northern tributary of the Niger River during Grant's tenure at St Mary's Island. He travelled alone before returning in 1819 by way of the Rio Geba. From 28 July 1820 to 28 November 1821, with a short break from 1 February 1821 to 4 February, Grant served as the acting Governor of Sierra Leone. This was in between two terms served by MacCarthy in the country. On 18 December 1821, Grant was promoted to Major. In 1823, Sierra Leone was chosen as the seat of government for the British West African Settlements, and annexed by Act of Parliament with a jurisdiction that included the Gambia. = MacCarthy Island and the Ceded Mile = Lemain Island was purchased as an outpost in 1823, 160 miles up the Gambia. The name was then changed to MacCarthy Island. A Government House was built, with a barracks for a company of soldiers, called Fort George. Grant established Georgetown on the island, as a settlement for freed slaves. MacCarthy Island at the time was notorious for fighting and rumours of fighting, with night alarms and \\"enough excitement to satisfy the most energetic soldiers seeking a show\\". The soldiers on the island were ten to twelve days from headquarters and surrounded by warring tribes, who saw the British presence as \\"the first step towards their total dispossession.\\" On 8 January 1824, Grant was promoted to Lieutenant Colonel, without purchase, meaning he earned the promotion on merit and not by payment. After the establishment of a base on MacCarthy Island, Grant oversaw the acquisition of what was known as the Ceded Mile. It was a strip of territory one mile wide at the mouth of the Gambia River on the north bank, opposite Bathurst, and stretching from the ocean inland as far as the eastern boundary of the Kingdom of Barra. Burungai Sonko, the King of Barra, agreed to the deal ‚Äì which led to the British constructed Fort Bullen in the Ceded Mile over the next five years. St Mary's Island, which was still being leased from the King of Barra, was also annexed and formally became British territory. On 1 August 1826, Grant was formally succeeded by Captain Alexander Findlay as the commandant. During Grant's time as commandant, the population of Bathurst had increased from about 700 in 1818, to 1,800 in 1826. This was due to an influx of Liberated Africans from Sierra Leone. Grant had also served as acting Governor of Sierra Leone in 1820 and in 1821 and became the first Governor of Sierra Leone to receive a knighthood.  Retirement and death  Grant returned to Britain in 1825 \\"with a broken constitution.\\" After a year spent on leave in Britain, he decided that he was too ill to continue in the Army and so retired. A short obituary in the London Courier and Gazette states that he \\"soon after fell a sacrifice to the effects of a climate that has been fatal to so many Europeans\\" and died on 29 September 1827. The obituary went on to state that \\"for many years, when there was a post of difficulty or of danger, Colonel Grant was selected for it by the late Governor, Sir Charles McCarthy, whose confidence, esteem, and friendship, he possessed in the fullest measure.\\"  References  1775 births 1827 deaths West India Regiment officers British colonial army officers Governors of the Gambia Military history of the Gambia Knights Bachelor Governors of Sierra Leone ","title":"Alexander Grant (British Army officer)"},{"id":"53605320","text":"The Journal of Evaluation in Clinical Practice is a quarterly peer-reviewed medical journal covering the evaluation of clinical practice in all medical and health disciplines.

Built in the second half of the 15th century for an enriched merchant, Huc de Boysson, it was remodeled and considerably enlarged during the following century by another merchant Jean de Cheverry. It is a listed historical monument since 1928. H√¥tel Boysson History In 1458, a ruined house already belongs to Huc de Boysson, draper, woad merchant, but also a money changer, originally from Aubin and settled in Toulouse in 1432. The great fire of 7 May 1463 destroyed this house, like the other houses in the neighborhood. It is therefore probably between 1463 and 1468, when it becomes capitoul, that a new residence is built by Huc de Boysson, which thus marks his wealth and power. In 1535, the hotel was acquired by Jean de Cheverry, a woad merchant. He is one of the influential personages of the time. In 1526 he married Jeanne de Lancefoc, who came from a large family of Capitouls. In 1548 he married his daughter Peyronne to Pierre d'Ass√©zat, another woad merchant. Elected capitoul one month after the purchase of the hotel de Boysson, Jean de Cheverry seems to undertake new developments in a Renaissance style that corresponds to the fashion of the time. He had the windows of the tower modified and ordered the construction of four other buildings. Description The hotel retains elements representative of the Gothic style, especially for the parts built by Huc de Boysson, but also Renaissance elements, in the parts added by Jean de Cheverry. In the first gothic courtyard, on the first floor of the tower a large Renaissance-style mullioned window was opened in 1535: the columns and the mullion were replaced by three caryatids and the pilasters are covered with arabesques. The second courtyard was formerly the garden of Huc de Boysson, and on the east side of the courtyard, in the part which belongs to the Hotel de Boysson, there is a remarkable window: the Gothic frame is overloaded with scorching scrolls of Finely carved thistles. The arcaded gallery is supported by columns of stone Doric style. The doors and windows on the ground and two floors, decorated with columns and pilasters, are typical of the Renaissance. The lower room with its vault of sixteen ribs and a double ogive cross, with liernes and tiercerons, is remarkable.

Houston makes feature-length pornographic films in addition to producing, directing, and shooting hundreds of installments for her queer porn membership site CrashPadSeries.com. Houston distributes her own work and that of other indie adult filmmakers through PinkLabel.tv, catering to different sexual communities. Significance Shine Louise Houston's films have screened at film festivals around the world. Houston speaks widely on issues of representation and sexual freedom of expression. She is heavily involved with the feminist and queer art community as well as doing sexual health work and sex worker activism. In her work, Houston features a diverse range of ethnicities, body types, non-conforming genders, and sexual identities Houston has been written about widely in numerous publications on the intersections of race, pornography, and desire. Ariane Cruz, a professor of women's studies at Penn State, writes in her book, The Color of Kink, Critics have stated that Houston's work counters inauthentic representations of women, trans, gender nonconforming, and queer folks of color's sexuality and desire in mainstream porn. They also feel that Houston incorporates her own pleasure and desire as a black women into her pornography acting as a self-aware voyeur and camera operator. Education Houston received a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree in Film from the San Francisco Art Institute. Career After graduating, Houston worked at a Good Vibrations sex shop in the San Francisco Bay area for five years. While at Good Vibrations, Houston found an underserved need for queer-made pornography when customers asked for recommendations on the search for representation of their own sexual communities. Community demand inspired Houston to band together with friends to make their own queer pornography. Houston founded Pink and White Productions and in 2008 launched the queer pornography distribution site CrashPadSeries.com. The company's first queer porn feature, Crash Pad, starring Jiz Lee, establishes the location of all the subsequent CrashPadSeries episodes. The Crash Pad is an apartment located in San Francisco dedicated to mutual pleasure based queer sex and Houston acts as Key Keeper to the Crash Pad. Houston incorporates into the scene her presence behind the camera via her own kink, and participation, as a voyeur. In the feature SuperFreak she stars as the ghost of Rick James. The ghost possesses people on a mission to turn the whole world into SuperFreaks having great sex. All models in Pink and White Productions videos seek them out, and Houston organizes scenes around the model's personal fantasies. CrashPadSeries.com debuts episodic, reality-based queer pornography videos. The site is set up like a blog, featuring photos and identity profiles of the stars to make visible the alternate gender identities and sexualities represented in their videos. As of 2017, Houston is in post-production for their next feature, Snapshot, a horror film dedicated to complicating the limited \\"coming out\\" narrative predominantly featured in mainstream media.

Many disciplines contain seven cords, symbolizing the seven deadly sins and seven virtues. They also often contain three knots on each cord, representing the number of days Jesus Christ remained in the tomb after bearing the sins of humanity. Those who use the discipline often do so during the penitential season of Lent, but others use it on other occasions, and some have used it every day.  History and practice  Fresco in the 350px In the Christian Bible, Saint Paul writes: \\"I punish my body and enslave it, so that after proclaiming to others I myself should not be disqualified\\" (1 Corinthians 9:27 NRSV). Christians who use the discipline do so as a means of partaking in the mortification of the flesh to aid in the process of sanctification; they also \\"inflict agony on themselves in order to suffer as Christ and the martyrs suffered.\\" In antiquity and during the Middle Ages, when Christian monastics would mortify the flesh as a spiritual discipline, the name of the object that they used to practice this also became known as the discipline. By the 11th century, the use of the discipline for Christians who sought to practice the mortification of the flesh became ubiquitous throughout Christendom. With the Roman Catholic Church, the discipline is used by some austere Catholic religious orders. The Cistercians, for example, use the discipline to mortify their flesh after praying the Compline. The Capuchins have a ritual observed thrice a week, in which the psalms Miserere Mei Deus and De Profundis are recited while friars flagellate themselves with a discipline. Saints within the Roman Catholic Church, such as Dominic Loricatus, Mary Magdalene de' Pazzi, among others, used the discipline on themselves to aid in their sanctification. Votarists of some Anglican religious orders practice self-flagellation with a discipline. Within Anglicanism, the use of the discipline became \\"quite common\\" among many members of the Tractarian movement. Martin Luther, German Reformer, practiced mortification of the flesh through fasting and self-flagellation, even sleeping in a stone cell without a blanket. Congregationalist writer and leader within the evangelical Christian movement, Sarah Osborn, practiced self-flagellation in order \\"to remind her of her continued sin, depravity, and vileness in the eyes of God\\".

These theorems show that particular kinds of sets always must have some members that are, in terms of Turing degree, not too complicated. One family of basis theorems concern nonempty effectively closed sets (that is, nonempty \\\\Pi^0_1 sets in the arithmetical hierarchy); these theorems are studied as part of classical computability theory. Another family of basis theorems concern nonempty lightface analytic sets (that is, \\\\Sigma^1_1 in the analytical hierarchy); these theorems are studied as part of hyperarithmetical theory.  Effectively closed sets  Effectively closed sets are a topic of study in classical computability theory. An effectively closed set is the set of all paths through some computable subtree of the binary tree 2^{<\\\\omega}. These sets are closed, in the topological sense, as subsets of the Cantor space 2^\\\\omega, and the complement of an effective closed set is an effective open set in the sense of effective Polish spaces. Kleene proved in 1952 that there is a nonempty, effectively closed set with no computable point (Cooper 1999, p. 134). Basis theorems show that there must be points that are not \\"too far\\" from being computable, in an informal sense. A class \\\\mathcal{C} \\\\subseteq 2^\\\\omega is a basis for effectively closed sets if every nonempty effectively closed set includes a member of \\\\mathcal{C} (Cooper 2003, p. 329). Basis theorems show that particular classes are bases in this sense. These theorems include (Cooper 1999, p. 134): * The low basis theorem: each nonempty \\\\Pi^0_1 set has a member that is of low degree. * The hyperimmune-free basis theorem: each nonempty \\\\Pi^0_1 set has a member that is of hyperimmune-free degree. * The r.e. basis theorem: each nonempty \\\\Pi^0_1 set has a member that is of recursively enumerable (r.e.) degree. Here, a set X \\\\subseteq \\\\N is low if its Turing jump X' = \\\\varnothing', the degree of the halting problem. X has hyperimmune-free degree if every total X-computable function f\\\\colon \\\\mathbb{N} \\\\to \\\\mathbb{N} is dominated by a total computable function g (meaning f(n) \\\\leq g(n) for all n).  Lightface analytic sets  There are also basis theorems for lightface \\\\Sigma^1_1 sets. These basis theorems are studied as part of hyperarithmetical theory. One theorem is the Gandy basis theorem, which is analogous to the low basis theorem. The Gandy basis theorem shows that each nonempty \\\\Sigma^1_1. set has an element that is hyperarithmetically low, that is, which has the same hyperdegree as Kleene's set \\\\mathcal{O}.

Between 1973 and 1981 he photographed mundane aspects of middle class life in the centre of England‚Äîblack and white portraits of ordinary people and suburbia within walking distance of his home in Stourbridge. Myers self-published this photography in books in 1974 and 1990; then only after renewed critical attention in 2011 were more books dedicated solely to his photography published. His work was included in the international survey of photographers, The Photography Book (Phaidon Press, 2014). Since the early 1970s he has exhibited in the UK and Europe. His work is held in the collection of the Library of Birmingham, in the Arts Council Collection, and in the James Hyman Collection. He later gave up photography for painting and had a solo exhibition in 2003 at Rugby Art Gallery and Museum. Myers worked as a lecturer in fine art, then painting, from 1969 to 2001. Life and work Originally from Bradford, Myers has been based in the Black Country town of Stourbridge, in the West Midlands, since graduating from art school in Newcastle in 1969.

Retrieved 27 March 2017 His self-published book from this period, Middle England (1974), contains black and white portraits of individuals and families, which were also included in his first major exhibition at Ikon Gallery, Birmingham, in 2012. His black and white photographs of \\"garages, TVs, electricity substations, new builds and his neighbours\\" in The World is not Beautiful: 1973‚Äì1981 (published 2017) were also made within walking distance of his house. He has also extensively photographed British industry. Myers used a 4√ó5 large format Gandolfi camera that takes some time to set up and to use. He has noted the influence of photographers August Sander, Lewis Hine, Walker Evans, Eugene Atget, and Diane Arbus. His photographic archive from 1972 to 1981 is held in the Library of Birmingham's photography collection. The archive contains 134 of his portraits, mainly from 1973 to 1975; and roughly 160 photographs of aspects of the urban environment, from 1974 to 1981. > Although his work is thoroughly English in feel, Myers was a contemporary > of, and can be favourably compared to, American Landscape photographers > including Stephen Shore, Lewis Baltz & Robert Adam[s].

The squadron is an active duty associate unit aiding the 932d Airlift Wing in performance of its airlift mission. The first predecessor of the squadron was formed in August 1917 as the 54th Aero Squadron and served in France during World War II. In 1936, this unit was consolidated with the 54th School Squadron, a pilot training unit that became the 54th Bombardment Squadron, which became a demonstration unit for the Air Corps Tactical School, and later a test and evaluation unit for medium bomber aircraft and tactics. In 1985, this squadron was consolidated with the 54th Transport Squadron, an Air Transport Command unit that was involved with the movement of aircraft in the Caribbean during World War II, and the 554th Reconnaissance Squadron, which conducted surveillance of the Ho Chi Minh Trail during the Vietnam War. In 1993, the consolidated unit became the 54th Airlift Flight and has conducted operational support airlift since then. In 2005, the flight was expanded to squadron size.  History  =World War I= The first predecessor of the squadron was formed in August 1917 as the 54th Aero Squadron. The unit was organized primarily from recruits in the Columbus, Ohio area at Kelly Field, Texas. After a month of indoctrination training at Kelly, it moved to the Aviation Concentration Center at Hazelhurst Field, Long Island, New York, where it arrived on 21 September. At Hazelhurst, the squadron was outfitted for overseas duty, sailing on the Cunard Liner on 13 October with seven other squadrons, Arriving in Belfast, Ireland on the 28th. The following day, the squadron disembarked at Liverpool for a train trip to Southampton. The squadron arrived at Le Havre, France on 1 November.Gorrell After some rest in Le Havre, the squadron then boarded a French train for Issoudun Aerodrome in central France. Its mission was to assist in the construction of a large training aerodrome, designated the Third Aviation Instruction Center. The squadron erected wooden barracks, dug ditches for water and sewer lines as well as electricity and telephones. It was redesignated as the 466th Aero Squadron on 1 February 1918 when Aero Squadrons engaging in construction work were renumbered in the 400s. On 10 March 1918, with the work largely completed at Issodun, the squadron was moved to Air Service Production Center No. 2 at Romorantin Aerodrome. There, the squadron assisted in the same type of construction it performed at Issodun. By 1 April 1918, the facility was ready for use as an active Air Service training camp. As part of the permanent garrison at Romorantin, the squadron's mission was to assemble aircraft, work in the engineering department, maintain the facilitates of the base, operate the quartermaster's office and other administrative departments of the production center. It continued this work until the armistice in November 1918. In late December 1918, the squadron was ordered to be demobilized by the Commanding General, Services of Supply, American Expeditionary Forces. It moved to a staging area near Brest where it awaited transportation back to the United States. The squadron arrived at Garden City, New York, at the end of January 1919 where it was demobilized and its men returned to civilian life. =Flying training= Douglas BT-2 trainer The second predecessor of the 54th was the 54th School Squadron, which was activated in July 1927 at March Field, California. The squadron conducted flying training with Douglas BT-2s until July 1931, when the Air Corps concentrated its pilot training at fields in the San Antonio, Texas area and inactivated the squadron and March Field. =Air Corps Tactical School= The squadron was activated again a little more than three months later at Maxwell Field, Alabama, where it was assigned to the Air Corps Tactical School. The squadron permitted students at the school to maintain flying proficiency while attending the school. In March 1935, the squadron was redesignated the 54th Bombardment Squadron. It was inactivated in September 1936. The following month, it was consolidated with the 466th Aero Squadron, although it remained in inactive status for the next three years. =Proving ground unit= B-26 Marauder on a bomb training run at Eglin FieldAircraft is Martin B-26C Marauder serial 41-34674. This aircraft was the second B-26C off the B-26 production line at Omaha, Nebraska. The squadron was reactivated at Maxwell in October 1939 and assigned to the 23d Composite Group. The group's mission was to demonstrate current tactics to students attending the Air Corps Tactical School, with the understanding that the group would also assume the demonstration and exhibition function that was being carried out by combat units of Air Force Combat Command. The group was also assigned the mission of performing tactical service tests of aircraft and other equipment; developing and testing new air tactics; and demonstrating these new tactics to the service schools of the other branches of the United States Army, to General Headquarters, and at Air Corps stations.Finney, pp. 18-19 The squadron was initially the group's bomber unit, although two months afer it was activated, it added \\"Medium\\" to its designation when the 24th Attack-Bombardment Squadron was added to the 23d Group as its attack and dive bomber unit.Maurer, Combat Squadrons, p. 125 The squadron moved to Orlando Army Air Base, Florida the following year, and to Eglin Field on 1 July 1941. When the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor, the squadron was equipped with various aircraft types at Eglin. The squadron's mission focused on developing and demonstrating tactics and doctrine. After moving to Eglin it also conducted testing of experimental weapons, including the Martin B-26 Marauder. On 1 May 1942, the squadron and the group's other squadrons were disbanded as the group focused on weapons development rather than tactics. =Ferrying and airlift= The third predecessor of the squadron was organized at Homestead Army Air Base, Florida in September 1942 as the 54th Ferrying Squadron. For the next year, the squadron, later redesignated the 54th Transport Squadron, ferried aircraft from Florida to various locations in the Caribbean. In the fall of 1943, Air Transport Command reorganized its operations at Homestead, replacing its overseas ferrying squadrons there with Station 8, Caribbean Wing, Air Transport Command and the squadron was disbanded on 7 November. =Reconnaissance in Southeast Asia= Lockheed EC-121R in Southeast Asia The last predecessor of the squadron is the 554th Reconnaissance Squadron, which was activated at Otis Air Force Base, Massachusetts in February 1957. At Otis it began to train with Lockheed C-121G Constellations as it equipped with Lockheed EC-121R Batcats. Once training was completed, the squadron moved to Korat Royal Thai Air Force Base, Thailand to begin operations monitoring movement on the Ho Chi Minh Trail in Laos. The squadron's planes monitored information provided by sensors on the ground that had been delivered by other aircraft or special forces. These included Air Delivered Seismic Intrusion Detectors, which picked up vibrations in the earth caused by vehicle traffic and transmitted them to the aircraft. Sequential transmissions by these sensors permitted analysis of vehicle speed and route. These were combined with sound detectors that helped determine what type of vehicle was operating. The sensor information was retransmitted by the squadron's aircraft to the infiltration surveillance center located at Nakhon Phanom Royal Thai Air Force Base (NKP) for Analysis.Gatlin, pp. 3, 7 In October 1970, the squadron replaced its C-121s with the smaller Beechcraft QU-22. In December 1970, the squadron's parent 553d Reconnaissance Wing was inactivated and the squadron moved on paper to NKP, where it took over the operations of what had been Detachment 1 of the 553d Wing at NKP and was assigned to the 56th Special Operations Wing. The squadron inactivated at the end of September 1972. In September 1985, the 554th was consolidated with the 54th Bombardment Squadron and the 54th Transport Squadron as the 554th Tactical Intelligence Squadron. However, the consolidated squadron was never active under that name. =Return to airlift mission= C-40C Clipper 09-0540 The squadron was never active as an intelligence unit, but was redesignated the 54th Airlift Flight and returned to Maxwell Air Force Base, on 1 April 1993. It provided airlift for senior officers and others stationed at Maxwell. In April 1997, Air Mobility Command centralized management of this type of airlift under the 375th Air Mobility Wing. As a result of this reorganization, the flight moved to Wright- Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio, where it remained until 2004. In September of that year, the 54th moved to Scott Air Force Base, Illinois and became a squadron once again as the 54th Airlift Squadron. It inactivated at Scott on the last day of 2006. The squadron was again activated in March 2007 at Scott. The squadron operates as a Total Force Associate unit aiding the 932d Airlift Wing mission. The 54th belongs administratively to the 375th Operations Group at Scott. However, it operates under the 932d Operations Group alongside the reserve 73d Airlift Squadron. With this relationship the 73d Airlift Squadron owns the aircraft, and the 54th Airlift Squadron provides aircrew members flying together as one mixed crew. The primary aircraft currently operated is the Boeing C-40 Clipper. The primary mission of the 54th Airlift Squadron is safe, comfortable, and reliable transportation of our nation's senior leaders.

Background and education  Kate Just was born in Hartford, Connecticut in 1974, but moved to Melbourne, Australia in 1994. Just works in knitting, sculpture, ceramic media and photography. She holds a PhD in sculpture from Monash University, a Master of Arts from RMIT University, and a Bachelor of Fine Arts in painting from the Victorian College of the Arts. For her PhD research project, The Texture of her Skin, she was awarded the Mollie Hollman Doctoral Medal for the best PhD in Art Design and Architecture. Kate Just has been working as a Lecturer in Art at the Victorian College of the Arts Art since 2005. Kate Just began knitting in 2000 following a tragic family loss. As part of her grieving process, her mother taught her to knit. Just believes that knitting is a powerful personal, political, poetic and narrative tool and claims that her knitted artworks are autobiographical as they explore childhood and biographical experiences.  Work  Just creates elaborate large-scale knitted sculptures, as well as works in resin, clay, collage and photo-based media. Just's work deals with feminist representations of the body. Her use of knitting in many of her works casts craft as a highly engaging and valid form of sculpture as well as a poetic or political tool. Just has also created a number of socially engaged projects and public works in urban communities regarding violence against women. For example in the KNIT HOPE, KNIT SAFE and FURIES works, Just worked with diverse groups of women from communities in the United Kingdom and Australia in which they knitted banners and photographic images challenging the ongoing issue of domestic violence and murders of women such as . Just's work has been exhibited in over a hundred solo and group exhibitions in Australia including Daine Singer, Craft Victoria, Gertrude Contemporary, West Space, Conical, Centre for Contemporary Photography, Melbourne Art Fair, Silvershot, Contemporary Art Space of Tasmania, Chalk Horse Gallery, Nellie Castan Gallery, First Draft, MOP, Perth Institute of Contemporary Art, and Canberra Contemporary Art Space. Within an international context, Just has exhibited her work at A.I.R. Gallery and AC Institute in New York, Titanik Galleria in Finland, Nanjing University in China, Auckland Art Fair, The Factory at Kunsthalle Krems, Austria, Youkobo Art Space in Tokyo, Japan, Hive Gallery in Los Angeles and Sanskriti Art Gallery in New Delhi. In 2017, Just's works will be exhibited at the Rijswijk Museum in the Netherlands and the newly built ICA in Richmond, Virginia. The banners Safe and Hope are proudly part of the Wangaratta Art Gallery Collection. Paradise, a life-sized knitted installation depicting a woman in a T-shirt and denim cut-off jeans, referencing the abduction of Persephone, is in the collection of the Ararat Gallery TAMA.

Latterly, he established Japan Karate Shotokai South Africa (now known as Japan Karate Shoto Federation South Africa), having remained loyal to Tetsuhiko Asai after Asai established Japan Karate Shotokai. Norman Robinson is also a distinguished student of Judo, holding a 7th dan in that art, and is also known for his acting roles in several martial arts films. Early life Robinson was born on 17 September 1936 in South Africa. He was the youngest of eight childrenNorman Robinson Interview at The Shotokan Way and his father was a famous judo instructor having pioneered judo in South Africa in 1930. He had wanted to be a doctor, but through his father's influence devoted his time to martial arts, and travelled extensively to both practice and compete. Karate During a South African Judo championship, Robinson was challenged by Sebastian Hawkins, an ex-student of his father, to take on a number of his students. Robinson defeated all of them, and one of these students was Stan Schmidt with whom Robinson became friends following their bout. Schmidt had been studying karate from books and practicing it within his dojo and in Robinson found someone that shared an interest in martial arts that went beyond Judo. Together they attempted to learn karate out of a book called \\"Mas Oyama Book of the Five Pinan Katas\\". They continued their training and in 1963 approached the Japanese Consulate asking for further information on Japanese Karate organizations. The Consulate put them in touch with JKA Tokyo and Schmidt actually travelled out to Japan to train with the JKA. In 1965 four instructors were brought to South Africa: Taiji Kase; Keinosuke Enoeda; Hirokazu Kanazawa; and Hiroshi Shirai. These instructors stayed for six months and from April to October 1965 Robinson trained 3 times a day, predominantly with Enoeda, and achieved his Shodan ('black belt') on 4 October 1965. Enoeda then left South Africa for the United Kingdom. After this, Schmidt and Robinson spread Shotokan Karate further into South Africa and on many occasions they visited Japan during the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s. It was in Japan in 1970 that Robinson graded for his third dan ('Sandan') in the course of which he had to fight the renowned fighter, Masahiko Tanaka - already a 4th dan at the time. The fight went to ground in which Robinson utilized his judo by placing Tanaka in a Kesa-Gatame ('scarf- hold'), whereupon Nakayama stopped the fight. Out of the six people grading, Robinson was one of two to pass. During the training for Sandan, Robinson attended the 7am morning class taught by Nakayama. He then later in the day attended the \\"foreigner‚Äôs class\\" but over a coffee with Nakayama he conveyed that he felt the level of karate in that class was not sufficient and asked if it was possible that he could train in the instructor's class. Nakayama agreed he became the one of the first karateka from outside Japan to join the JKA Instructors Class, which Schmidt had dubbed 'The Hornet's Nest'. Initially, none of the Japanese would work with Robinson during kumite practice but after Nakayama introduced him to the class he was accepted by everyone. =JKA split and the foundation of JKS= Film career Norman Robinson appeared in three films as a Martial Artist. In 1976, he and Stan Schmidt played Karate Fighters in Karate Killer and in the 1980 film, Gemini he played a Karate Instructor.

It has a single erect, hairy leaf and up to three greenish to creamy white flowers with red stripes on the sepals and petals. The flowers have relatively narrow sepals and petals and a relatively small labellum. It is a rare orchid only known from an area between Rocky Gully and Collie.  Description  Caladenia validinervia is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb with an underground tuber and which grows as solitary plants. It has a single erect leaf, 50‚Äì160 mm long, 3‚Äì6 mm wide and pale green with reddish-purple blotches near its base. Up to three greenish to creamy white flowers 50‚Äì80 mm across are borne on a stalk 120‚Äì210 mm high. The sepals and petals suddenly narrow about one- third along to a brownish-black, thread-like, densely glandular tip. The dorsal sepal is erect near its base then curves forward and is 40‚Äì70 mm long and about 2 mm wide. The lateral sepals and petals have the same dimensions as the dorsal sepal but spread apart from each other, horizontally near their base but then curve downwards, drooping near the tips. The labellum is 7‚Äì10 mm long, 5‚Äì8 mm wide and creamy-white to pale yellow with red lines and spots and short, blunt teeth on its sides. There are two rows of cream-coloured, narrow anvil-shaped calli up to 1.5 mm long, along the centre of the labellum. Flowering occurs from September to October.  Taxonomy and naming  Caladenia validinervia was first described in 2015 by Andrew Brown and Garry Brockman after an unpublished description by Stephen Hopper and Andrew Brown. The type specimen was collected near Muirs Highway and the description was published in Nuytsia. The specific epithet (validinervia) is derived from the Latin words validus meaning \\"strong\\", \\"sound\\" or \\"powerful\\" and nervus meaning \\"sinew\\" or \\"tendon\\", referring to the prominent red stripes on the flower parts.  Distribution and habitat  The Lake Muir spider orchid is only known from a small area between Rocky Gully on Muirs Highway and Collie in the Jarrah Forest biogeographic region where it grows in jarrah and marri woodland. Conservation Caladenia validinervia is classified as \\"Priority One\\" by the Government of Western Australia Department of Parks and Wildlife, meaning that it is known from only one or a few locations which are potentially at risk.

It is located 5 miles southwest of the city of Fergus Falls. Completed in 1909, it is the first power plant built by the Otter Tail Power Company and is one of five dams on the river. Together, they produce about 3.5 megawatts of power. Shortly after becoming operational, Dayton Hollow Dam narrowly avoided destruction. The city-owned Fergus Falls City Light Station, several miles upstream, abruptly failed in the early hours of September 24, 1909. Three other dams between the disaster site and Dayton Hollow were swept away and a fourth (Central / Wright) was badly damaged. Otter Tail Power Company president Vernon Wright received enough advance warning to reach his dam by 6:15am and open the spillway. The only flood recorded in the history of the river was due to this disaster. The license for the hydroelectric plant expires on November 30, 2021. In June 2016 the company filed a pre-application with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to re-license the station with no changes to existing facilities or operations.

In addition to being produced in the United Kingdom licensed variants were produced in Italy and in Japan. Users of this family of gun included the navies of Argentina, Chile, China, Italy, Japan and Spain. This family of guns saw action in the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War, Boxer Rebellion, Russo-Japanese War, Italo-Turkish War, World War I and World War II. In addition to its naval role it was later used as coastal artillery and siege artillery after the ships it served on were decommissioned. History The EOC 8 inch 45 caliber family of guns originated in 1894 from the Elswick Ordnance Company Pattern Q gun which was first produced for export in 1895. In addition to the Pattern Q there were S, U and W Pattern guns produced for export. Earlier Patterns A through P, R and T were shorter 35 or 40 caliber guns. While the Pattern Q, S, U and W were all 8 inch 45 caliber guns. The weights and dimensions of each Pattern of gun were similar and their ammunition, bagged charges and their ballistic performance were also similar. Construction The Armstrong Pattern Q was the first wire wound 8 inch EOC gun. I was constructed of an inner A tube, wire wound for , with a jacket shrunk over the wire. It had a single-motion breech mechanism of cylindrical- conical style with five threaded and five smooth sectors. Naval service The Japanese 20.3 cm/45 Type 41 naval gun was based on the Pattern S guns from Armstrong first installed on Takasago in 1898 with licensed production beginning in 1902. Existing S, U and W Pattern guns were later classified as Type 41 naval guns in Japanese service. Type 41 guns were employed as Coastal Artillery during World War II after the ships they armed were decommissioned and disarmed. Pattern S guns also armed protected cruisers of Argentine Navy and Chinese Navy. :Pattern S: :* - This protected cruiser was completed in 1896 by Armstrong in Newcastle upon Tyne for the Argentinian Navy.

The Italian Cannone da 203/45 Modello 1897 was based on the Pattern W gun from Armstrong and licensed production began in 1897 at the Armstrong factory in Pozzuoli, Italy. The Modello 1897 guns armed ships built in Italy for the Argentinian Navy, Italian Navy, Imperial Japanese Navy and the Spanish Navy. Modello 1897 guns were later employed by the Italian Army as Siege Artillery during World War I and as Coastal Artillery during World War II after the ships they armed were decommissioned and disarmed. :Pattern W: :* :** One of the four Giuseppe Garibaldi-class armored cruisers built for the Argentinian Navy, had four Pattern W guns as primary armament mounted in twin gun turrets fore and aft. :** The three Giuseppe Garibaldi-class armored cruisers built for the Italian Navy had a primary armament of one Armstrong Pattern R 10 inch gun in a single turret fore and two Pattern W guns mounted in twin gun turrets aft. :** There were two armored cruisers built for the Imperial Japanese Navy. had a primary armament of one Armstrong Pattern R 10-inch gun in a single turret fore and two Pattern W guns mounted in a twin gun turret aft. had a primary armament of four Pattern W guns mounted in twin turrets fore and aft. :** The single Giuseppe Garibaldi-class armored cruiser built for the Spanish Navy, , was designed to have a primary armament of one Armstrong Pattern R 10-inch gun in a single turret fore and two Pattern W guns mounted in a twin gun turret aft.

In 1907 the ship's original secondary armament of twelve 6-inch guns, mounted in twin turrets, amidships were replaced by six, single gun, shielded, pedestal mounted, Pattern W guns. :* - The four semi-dreadnought battleships of this class had a secondary armament of twelve Pattern W guns, in three twin gun turrets per side, amidships. :* - The two pre-dreadnought battleships of this class had a secondary armament of four Pattern W guns mounted in casemates amidships in the ships superstructure. Italian Army use As the First World War settled into Trench Warfare on the Italian Front the light field guns that the combatants went to war with were beginning to show their limitations when facing an enemy who was now dug into prepared alpine positions. Indirect fire, interdiction and counter-battery fire emphasized the importance of long-range heavy artillery. In order to address the Italian Army's lack of long range heavy artillery surplus 203/45, 254B, 254/40, 305/17, 305/40, and 305/46 Naval Guns were converted to land use. These guns were mounted on De Stefano carriages for land use and the resulting guns were classified by their size in millimeters 203, their length in calibers 45 and lastly by their carriage type DS which stood for De Stefano or 203/45 DS. The De Stefano carriage was a clever, but strange looking monstrosity which looked something like a large steel basket with the gun barrel mounted towards the rear of the carriage. The carriage was a large box-trail design with four non-steerable wheels. The wheels were fitted with detachable grousers designed by major Crispino Bonagente for traction on soft ground and was towed in one piece by a Pavesi- Tolotti artillery tractor. When not on the move the grousers were removed and the steel wheels rode on an inclined set of steel rails when in firing position. The steel rails were mounted on a firing platform made of wooden beams which allowed the gun 360¬∞of traverse. When the gun fired recoil which was not absorbed by the recoil mechanism was transmitted to the wheels and the carriage rolled up the inclined rails and then rolled back into firing position. The box trail carriage was tall and wide enough that the breech of the gun was accessible at high angles of elevation without a pit being dug and the gun crew had a bucket and hoist for ammunition handling.

She also was the first Russian theorist of public preschool education and published books and journals advocating early childhood development. Early life Adelaida Semyonovna Bergman () was born in 1844 in Moscow, Russia to Augustina (n√©e Gutsohn) and Semyon Bergman. Her parents were merchants of German-Jewish heritage, who owned and operated their own mercantile business. There were three sisters, Adelaide, Sofya and Valentina and one brother, Alexander, in the family. As was typical for the era, Bergman attended five years of schooling and then studied on her own to be able to pass the examination to be qualified as a home teacher. Feeling her education was inadequate, Bergman asked to attend lectures at Moscow University, but permission was refused. In 1864, newly married to the physician Yakov Mironovich Simonovich, she decided to go abroad to study in Geneva, where women were allowed to attend university. Studying under the niece of Friedrich Fr√∂bel, she learned his pedagogical methods and originally planned to remain in Switzerland and run a school for immigrants. They traveled to Germany to learn how schools were organized there. Having met and discussed her ideas with Alexander Herzen, whom she greatly admired, she changed her plans and became determined to take what she had learned back to Russia. Career In 1866, Simonovitcha and her husband returned to Russia and opened the first Russian kindergarten in Saint Petersburg. Simultaneously, the couple began to publish the first Russian magazine dedicated to preschool education, which they called Detskiy sad (, meaning kindergarten). Though the magazine was short-lived, publishing only until 1868, it espoused the benefits of public education and was a forum to reshape Fr√∂bel's ideas with a Russian context. Drawing on the pedagogical work of Konstantin Ushinsky, Simonovitcha published a mixture of articles on children's literature, pedagogical critique, public education, sample lesson plans, and included games and stories for children. In 1870, the couple relocated to Tbilisi and opened a new school for international students. Their students spoke Armenian, Georgian and Russian, giving birth to the concept of a bilingual school servicing a variety of ethnic groups. In 1874, she published a compilation of the articles which had previously been printed in Detskiy sad, under the title Practical Notes on the Individual and Public Education of Young Children (). Widely influential, the book was reprinted in 1884. After six years, Dr. Simonovitch was offered a post in Saint Petersburg at a children's hospital and the couple returned to the capital. By this time, Simonovitcha had six children of her own, was helping to raise her nephew Valentin Serov and had reopened a small school. When the Bestuzhev Courses were finally opened in 1878, and began accepting women for higher education in Russia, Simonovitcha immediately began attending courses in history and philology. The following year, she and her husband adopted the daughter, Olga Trubnikova, of a deceased former patient of her husband. Trubnikova would later become the wife of Serov. Within four years in 1883, her husband would die of typhus, having contracted the illness at his work. Upon her husband's death, Simonovitcha moved to the Tver Oblast and settled on the estate of her son-in-law, Vladimir Derviz, who was married to her daughter, Nadia. She taught at a rural school in Kalachaevsky and organized the first nursery schools in Russia to care for children in the summers when she was not teaching. Teaching at the school for eleven years, Simonovitcha introduced the study of geography and nature to her classes, encouraging students to observe the habitat around them. She also instituted training for mothers to instruct them on hygiene and parenting, as she felt kindergarten was a bridge between family and becoming part of the larger society. Simonovitcha taught that children under three should be nurtured in their families and then begin socialization in kindergartens, in which their natural curiosity would be stimulated by interaction with their peers. Gradually, once they had mastered coherent speech, motor skills and self- control, around the age of six or seven, children would be ready to learn the alphabet and numbers and start actual education. Besides her work, Simonovitcha cultivated creativity in her children. At the Domotkanovo Estate, the family circle included Ivan Bilibin, Ivan Efimov, Vladimir Favorsky, and Sevov, among others. In 1907, Simonovitcha published Kindergarten: A Practical Guide for Children's Gardeners (), which was illustrated by her daughter, Nina Simonovich-Efimova. Despite the recognition of her work by the Tver Provincial Council and their assurances that the estate would continue to serve as her home, in 1918 during the Russian Civil War, Simonovitcha was forced to leave the estate. Death and legacy Simonovitcha died in 1933. She is remembered as one of the pioneers of the development of pre-school pedagogy in Russia.

Life and work Du M√®ge was born in The Hague on 5 December 1780. His father was an actor who moved to Toulouse in 1786 and from whom he inherited a collection of antiquities and a taste for numismatics and archaeology. His studies were rather limited, but he loved science, so he compensated by self study in the libraries he could frequent. He studied literature and history and after some years had enough knowledge of Latin, Greek and Hebrew for his future career as an archaeologist. As a young man he traveled the Pyren√©es searching for sculptures, altars, and other antiquities of Volques Tectosages. In 1814, the mayor of Toulouse entrusted him with the defense of the city based on instructions from Marshal Jean-de-Dieu Soult, but the army's corps of engineers did not approve his plan, a rejection for which he long held a grudge. Du M√®ge was recognised for saving many antiquities of the department of Haute-Garonne and was given the responsibility of organising the sculpture collection of the Mus√©e des Augustins in the 1830s. His archaeological hobby became a vocation. He brought a number of medieval works into the museum, specifically from the cloister of Notre-Dame de la Daurade and the portal of the chapter house of Saint-√âtienne. Du M√®ge, the Alexandre Lenoir of Toulouse, dreamed of creating in the Augustinian monastery the southern equivalent of the Museum of French Monuments: he reconstituted false tombs or real portals, and wrote contradictory descriptions of the collection's works in successive editions of the collection catalogs he published. Du M√®ge's disregard for archeological facts and record keeping superseded his collecting and preservation enthusiasm. In 1831 he co-founded the (Archaeological Society of the South of France). Then aged 50, he retrieved the antiquities and the medieval sculptures for the Mus√©e des Augustins. A correspondent of the Acad√©mie des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres, he created the archeological collections of the city of Toulouse. Between 1840 and 1846 Alexandre Du M√®ge pursued the work of the Benedictines Devic and Vaiss√®te by supplying a new complete edition of Histoire g√©n√©rale de Languedoc (General History of Languedoc) to publisher Jean-Baptiste Paya, generally considered unreliable and faulty. From 1836 to his death, he was the maintainer of the Consistori del Gay Saber. In 1852, he imagined a Neo-Gothic decoration for the crypts of the Basilica of Saint-Sernin. It was destroyed during the resumption of restoration work in the 1960s.Monuments historiques, (in French). number 170, September‚ÄìOctober 1990, In spite of the faults that can be attributed to him,. especially his lack of scientific rigor, he remains one of the main founders of the archeology of southern France, a character halfway between science and myth, uniting erudition and imagination, fiction and reality. The N√©rac affair The infamous bas-relief of the Tetricus emperors. The affair of the forged bas-relief of the Tetricus emperors found in excavations at N√©rac considerably damaged Du M√®ge's reputation. A marble bas-relief of the two emperors was discovered in 1832 in N√©rac, department of Lot-et-Garonne in a Gallo-Roman villa in the area known as La Garenne, which was excavated under the direction of sculptor and forger . Chr√©tin produced bas-reliefs and inscriptions attributed to Tetricus with the complicity of Du M√®ge.The authenticity of these pieces was quickly called into question and as early as 17 November 1834, the Acad√©mie des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres proclaimed the inscriptions to be fake. Several of the inscriptions alluded to the existence of a certain \\"N√©ra\\", supposedly the wife of Tetricus I. In a note in the Acts of the SAM (p. 209 of vol. 1), Du M√®ge claims to have discovered this N√©ra before Chr√©tin, thus proving his involvement with the forger. This deception almost destroyed the Soci√©t√© Arch√©ologique du Midi which persisted in hiding the involvement of its secretary until recently, many of its dignitaries persisting in asserting in 1841, 1865, 1889 and even until 1940 that the famous quadriga preserved in the Mus√©e Saint-Raymond is an authentic Roman piece, except for some inscriptions added by Chr√©tin. In a recent work, Hubert Delpont ripped these interpretations to shreds and demonstrated conclusively the involvement of Du M√®ge.

The river is named after Henry Hudson, an Englishman sailing for the Dutch East India Company, who explored it in 1609, and after whom Canada's Hudson Bay is also named. It had previously been observed by Italian explorer Giovanni da Verrazzano sailing for King Francis I of France in 1524, as he became the first European known to have entered the Upper New York Bay, but he considered the river to be an estuary. The Dutch called the river the North River - with the Delaware River called the South River - and it formed the spine of the Dutch colony of New Netherland. Settlements of the colony clustered around the Hudson, and its strategic importance as the gateway to the American interior led to years of competition between the English and the Dutch over control of the river and colony. During the eighteenth century, the river valley and its inhabitants were the subject and inspiration of Washington Irving, the first internationally acclaimed American author. In the nineteenth century, the area inspired the Hudson River School of landscape painting, an American pastoral style, as well as the concepts of environmentalism and wilderness. The Hudson was also the eastern outlet for the Erie Canal, which, when completed in 1825, became an important transportation artery for the early-19th-century United States. Names Discovery of the Hudson River, Albert Bierstadt, 1874 The river was called Ca-ho-ha-ta-te-a (\\"the river\\") by the Iroquois, and it was known as Muh-he-kun-ne-tuk (\\"river that flows two ways\\") by the Mohican tribe who formerly inhabited both banks of the lower portion of the river. The Delaware Tribe of Indians (Bartlesville, Oklahoma) considers the closely related Mohicans to be a part of the Lenape people, and so the Lenape also claim the Hudson as part of their ancestral territory, naming the river Muhheakantuck (\\"river that flows two ways\\"). The first known European name for the river was the Rio San Antonio as named by the Portuguese explorer in Spain's employ, Esteban Gomez, who explored the Mid-Atlantic coast in 1525. Another early name for the Hudson used by the Dutch was Rio de Montaigne. Later, they generally termed it the Noortrivier, or \\"North River\\", the Delaware River being known as the Zuidrivier, or \\"South River\\". Other occasional names for the Hudson included: Manhattes rieviere \\"Manhattan River\\", Groote Rivier \\"Great River\\", and de grootte Mouritse reviere, or \\"the Great Mouritse River\\" (Mouritse is a Dutch surname). The translated name North River was used in the New York metropolitan area up until the early 1900s, with limited use continuing into the present day. The term persists in radio communication among commercial shipping traffic, especially below the Tappan Zee. The term also continues to be used in names of facilities in the river's southern portion, such as the North River piers, North River Tunnels, and the North River Wastewater Treatment Plant. It is believed that the first use of the name Hudson River in a map was in a 1740, in a map created by the cartographer John Carwitham. In 1939, the magazine Life described the river as \\"America's Rhine\\", comparing it to the stretch of the Rhine in Central and Western Europe. Pre-Columbian era The area around the Hudson River was inhabited by indigenous peoples ages before Europeans arrived. The Algonquins lived along the river, with the three subdivisions of that group being the Lenape (also known as the Delaware Indians), the Wappingers, and the Mahicans. The lower Hudson River was inhabited by the Lenape Indians. In fact, the Lenape Indians were the people that waited for the explorer Giovanni da Verrazzano onshore, traded with Henry Hudson, and sold the island of Manhattan. Further north, the Wappingers lived from Manhattan Island up to Poughkeepsie. They lived a similar lifestyle to the Lenape, residing in various villages along the river. They traded with both the Lenape to the south and the Mahicans to the north. The Mahicans lived in the northern valley from present-day Kingston to Lake Champlain, with their capital located near present-day Albany. The Lenape, the Wappingers, and the Mahicans were speakers of languages that were part of Algonquin language family. As such, the three subdivisions were able to communicate with each other. Their relations with each other were mostly peaceful. However, the Mahicans were often in direct conflict with the Mohawk Indians to the west, which were a part of the Iroquois nation. The Mohawks would sometimes raid Mahican villages from the west. The Algonquins in the region lived mainly in small clans and villages throughout the area. One major fortress was called Navish, which was located at Croton Point, overlooking the Hudson River. Other fortresses were located in various locations throughout the Hudson Highlands. Villagers lived in various types of houses, which the Algonquins called Wigwams. The houses could be circular or rectangular. Large families often lived in longhouses that could be a hundred feet long. At the associated villages, the indigenous peoples grew corn, beans, and squash. They also scavenged for other types of plant foods, such as various types of nuts and berries. In addition to agriculture, they also fished for food in the river, focusing on various species of freshwater fish, as well as several variations of striped bass, sturgeon, herring, and shad. Oyster beds were also common on the river floor, which provided an extra source of nutrition. Land hunting consisted of turkey, deer, rabbits, and other animals. Exploration, colonization, and revolution: 1497 to 1800 =Exploration of the Hudson River= In 1497, John Cabot traveled along the coast and claimed the entire country for England; he is credited with the Old World's discovery of continental North America. In 1524, Florentine explorer Giovanni da Verrazzano visited the bay of New York, in service of Francis I of France. On his voyage, Verrazzano sailed north along the Atlantic seaboard, starting in the Carolinas. Verrazzano sailed all the way to New York Harbor, which he thought was the mouth of a major river. Verrazzano sailed his boat into the harbor, and possibly sailed over what is now Battery Park (Battery Park was created with landfill). However, Verrazzano never sailed up the Hudson River, and left the harbor shortly thereafter. A year later, Estevan Gomez, a Portuguese explorer sailing for Spain in search of the Northwest Passage visited New York Bay. The extent of his explorations in the bay is unknown. Yet as Charles H. Winfield has noted, as late as 1679, there was a tradition among the First Nations that the Spanish arrived before the Dutch, and that from them it was that the natives obtained the maize or Spanish wheat. Maps of that era based on Gomez's map labeled the coast from New Jersey to Rhode Island, as the \\"land of Estevan Gomez\\". In 1598 some Dutch employed by the Greenland Company wintered in the Bay. Eleven years later, the Dutch East India Company financed English navigator Henry Hudson in his attempt to search for the Northwest Passage. During this attempt, Henry Hudson decided to sail his ship up the river that would later be named after him. As he continued up the river, its width expanded, into Haverstraw Bay, leading him to believe he had successfully reached the Northwest Passage. He docked his ship on the western shore of Haverstraw Bay and claimed the territory as the first Dutch settlement in North America. He also proceeded upstream as far as present-day Troy before concluding that no such strait existed there. =Dutch colonization= After Henry Hudson realized that the Hudson River was not the Northwest Passage, the Dutch began examine the region for potential trading opportunities. Dutch explorer and merchant Adriaen Block led a voyage up the lower Hudson River, the East River, and out into Long Island Sound. This voyage determined that the fur trade would be profitable in the region. As such, the Dutch established the colony of New Netherland. The Dutch settled three major outposts: New Amsterdam, Wiltwyck, and Fort Orange. New Amsterdam was founded at the mouth of the Hudson River, and would later become known as New York City. Wiltwyck was founded roughly halfway up the Hudson River between New Amsterdam and Fort Orange. That outpost would later become Kingston. Fort Orange was the outpost that was the furthest up the Hudson River. That outpost would later become known as Albany. New Netherland and its associated outposts were set up as fur-trading outposts. The Dutch attempted to form a trade alliance with the Mahicans, angering the Mohawk nation and provoking hostilities between the two tribes. The Natives began to trap furs at a quicker pace and then sold them to the Dutch for luxuries. This trade would eventually deplete the supply of those animals in their territory, decreasing the food supply in the process. The focus on furs also made the Natives economically dependent on the Dutch for trade. The Dutch West India Company operated a monopoly on the region for roughly twenty years before other businessmen were allowed to set up their own ventures in the colony. New Amsterdam quickly became the colony's most important city, operating as its capital and its merchant hub. The other outposts functioned as settlements in the wilderness. At first, the colony was made up of mostly single adventures looking to make money, but over time the region transitioned into maintaining family households. New economic activity in the form of food, tobacco, timber, and slaves was eventually incorporated into the colonial economy. In 1647, Director-General Peter Stuyvesant took over management of the colony. He found the colony in chaos due to a border war with the English along the Connecticut River, and Indian battles throughout the region. Stuyvesant quickly cracked down on smuggling and associated activity before expanding the outposts along the Hudson River, especially Wiltwyck at the mouth of Esopus Creek. Stuyvesant attempted to establish a fort midway up the Hudson River. However, before that could be done, the British invaded New Netherland via the port of New Amsterdam. Given that the city of New Amsterdam was largely defenseless, Stuyvesant was forced to surrender the city and the colony to the British. New Amsterdam and the overall colony of New Netherland was renamed New York, after the Duke of York. The Dutch regained New York temporarily, only to relinquish it again a few years later, thus ending Dutch control over New York and the Hudson River. =British colonization= Benjamin Franklin's famous Join, or Die cartoon, which called for the ratification of the Albany Plan of Union Under British colonial rule, the Hudson Valley became an agricultural hub, with manors being developed on the east side of the river. At these manors, landlords rented out land to their tenants, letting them take a share of the crops grown while keeping and selling the rest of the crops. Tenants were often kept at a subsistence level so that the landlord could minimize his costs. They also held immense political power in the colony due to driving such a large proportion of the agricultural output. Meanwhile, land west of Hudson River contained smaller landholdings with many small farmers living off the land. A large crop grown in the region was grain, which was largely shipped downriver to New York City, the colony's main seaport, for export back to Great Britain. In order to export the grain, colonial merchants were given monopolies to grind the grain into flour and export it. Grain production was also at high levels in the Mohawk River Valley. The Albany Congress took place at Albany City Hall in 1754, situated close to the Hudson River. This meeting included officials from both the colonies and from the Iroquois. The subject of the meeting referred to tensions between the British and the French and the prelude to the French and Indian Wars. At the meeting, residents of the city of Albany were able to come into contact with people from the rest of the colonies, which was an interesting experience for many citizens of the city. The result of the Congress was the Albany Plan of Union, which was the first attempt to create a unified government. The plan included 7 of the English colonies in North America. The plan itself consisted of council with members selected by colonial governments. The British government would select a president-general to oversee the new legislative body. The new colonial body would deal with Colonial-Indian affairs as well as settle territorial disputes between colonies. Although this plan was never ratified by the colonial governments, the plan created a framework for later efforts to create a unified continental government during the American Revolution. In addition, the colonial governments were able to sign a treaty with the Iroquois in advance of the upcoming war with the French. =Revolutionary War= Map of Washington's retreat through New York and New Jersey The Hudson River was a key river during the Revolution. The Hudson River was important for a few reasons. Firstly, the Hudson's connection to the Mohawk River allowed travelers to eventually get to the Great Lakes and the Mississippi River. In addition, the river's close proximity to Lake George and Lake Champlain would allow the British navy to control the water route from Montreal to New York City. In doing so, the British, under general John Burgoyne's strategy, would be able to cut off the patriot hub of New England (which is on the eastern side of the Hudson River) and focus on rallying the support of loyalists in the South and Mid-Atlantic regions. The British knew that total occupation of the colonies would be unfeasible, which is why this strategy was chosen. As a result of the strategy, numerous battles were fought along the river and in nearby waterways. August 27, 1776, the Battle of Long Island was fought in Brooklyn on the eastern shore of the Narrows, the mouth of the Hudson River. Utilizing the vast natural harbor that is New York Harbor, the British sent in an entire armada in order to take on Washington's army in battle. The British, led by General William Howe first arrived in Staten Island, on the western shore of the Narrows. The armada then sailed across the Narrows to a waiting Continental Army. Washington's army was vastly outnumbered at the battle with 12,000 soldiers; the British had 45,000 soldiers. As expected, the British badly defeated the continentals at the battle and nearly crushed the rebellion. However, under the cover of night, Washington ordered the camp fires to be extinguished, and then he and his army fled under the cover of darkness and fog across the East River by boat to Manhattan. The army then marched north to Harlem. As a result of the battle, the British took control of New York City and the harbor, and thus they took control of the mouth of the Hudson River. The British would turn New York City into its headquarters for the war, and occupy it for the rest of the war. The harbor would later be used for prison ships to hold the captured American soldiers. On September 15, 1776, The Battle of Harlem Heights was fought in what is now Morningside Heights, Upper Manhattan. After Washington's army retreated to the northern section of the Manhattan Island, British troops pursued his army. Washington was just finishing a report about the Battle of Long Island when the British began to advance on his position. Washington then counterattacked the British with a plan of his own. Washington ordered a feint in order to fix the British army into a favorable position. Once this was accomplished, Washington ordered Lieutenant Colonel Thomas Knowlton, his rangers, and other units to flank around the right side of the British and attack from the rear. The plan almost worked, but some of the Continental troops attacked too early, allowing the British to retreat and await reinforcements. Once those reinforcements began to arrive, Washington called off the attack. Although not a complete defeat of the British attacking force, the battle was nonetheless a Continental Army victory, the first of the war. This fact greatly enhanced troop morale. Washington would later retreat further north to White Plains, New York as the British pursued him and his army. While the British advanced towards Washington's Army, Washington decided to take a stand in White Plains. In October, 1776, Howe's army advanced from New Rochelle, and Scarsdale. Washington set up defensive positions in the hills around the village. When the British attacked, the British managed to break the Continental's defenses at Chatterton Hill, now known as Battle Hill. Once the British managed to reach the top of the hill, Washington was forced to retreat. The main positive for Washington after this battle was that he managed to avoid being enveloped by the British Army. Washington ordered his men to retreat across the Hudson River, eventually reaching New Jersey and Pennsylvania. Because Washington was able to preserve what was left of his army, this retreat would eventually lead to the successful surprise attacks on Trenton, New Jersey and Princeton, New Jersey in December of the same year. Fort Washington in Upper Manhattan later fell after this retreat. Once Washington retreated to Pennsylvania, New England militias had to fortify the Hudson Highlands, a choke point on the river north of Haverstraw Bay. As a result, the Continentals started building Fort Clinton on the other side of the river from Fort Montgomery. In the year 1777, Washington expected General Howe to sail his army north to Saratoga in order to meet up with General Burgoyne. This would result in the Hudson River being sealed off. However, Howe surprised Washington by sailing his army south to Philadelphia, conquering the Patriot capital. Washington was out of position and sought to defend Philadelphia, but to no avail. Meanwhile, Howe left Sir Henry Clinton in charge of a smaller force to be docked in New York City, with the permission to strike the Hudson Valley at any time. On October 5, 1777, Clinton's army did so. At the Battle of the Hudson Highlands, Clinton's force sailed up the Hudson River and attacked the twin forts. Along the way, the army looted and pillaged the village of Peeksill. The Continentals fought hard at the battle, but they were badly outnumbered and were fighting in unfinished forts. Washington's men were caught between defending Philadelphia and defending the Hudson Valley. In the end, the British took the fort, as well as taking Philadelphia around the same time. However, Clinton and his men returned to New York City soon afterward. The Continentals later decided to build the Great West Point Chain in order to prevent another British fleet from sailing up the Hudson River in a similar manner as during the previous battle. The chain that was by the forts was simply circumvented by the British army via attacking on the shores. The new chain, designed by engineer Captain Thomas Machin, could have theoretically been lowered in order to let friendly ships sail down the river, but the chain was never tested, and was later discarded after the war. Painting of Burgoyne's surrender at Saratoga In 1777, a major battle, part of the Battles of Saratoga, was unfolding 30 miles north of Albany in Saratoga, New York. British general Burgoyne sought to put into action his plan of taking over Albany and the Hudson River. Burgoyne and his army advanced southward from Canada towards Albany. Meanwhile, an army led by General Barry St. Leger marched east along the Mohawk River towards the same location, taking Fort Ticonderoga along the way. This fort was (and is) located at the southern end of Lake Champlain, and thus was seen as critical in defending Albany. Once Burgoyne took the fort, he made the mistake of deciding not to take the water route along Lake George, instead deciding to take the land route from the fort. Philip Schuyler punished Burgoyne for this mistake. He and his army chopped down trees and littered the pathway that Burgoyne would have to take through the swampy wilderness of the area. As a result of the decision to march south, Burgoyne's supply lines were strained. Burgoyne sent a column of his troops into Vermont in the hopes of securing needed supplies. However, Continental general John Stark and the New Hampshire-Vermont Militia thwarted Burgoyne's resupply run in the Battle of Bennington. The lack of supplies and the surrender of his column severely weakened his army. Meanwhile, Continental general Benedict Arnold halted the advance of General St. Ledger during the Siege of Fort Stanwix. This had the effect of preventing a British army from attacking the rear of the American troops during the Battle of Saratoga. Burgoyne expected Sir Henry Clinton, under the orders of General Howe, to aid him in the invasion by sailing up the Hudson River from the south. However, Howe's attack on Philadelphia diverted troops needed up in Saratoga. In addition, Washington prevented reinforcements from Howe's army from reaching Burgoyne. Meanwhile, Clinton's army was busy battling in the Hudson Highlands, as well as raiding villages in the Hudson Valley. As a result, Henry Clinton's fleet never reached Saratoga in time. Both the British and the American armies fought the Battles of Saratoga. Burgoyne still expected assistance from Henry Clinton, so his army dug in and waited. Clinton's forces did sail up the Hudson River, taking the Hudson Highlands forts as well as burning down Kingston (the NY State Capital at the time), but Clinton was forced to sail back to New York City in order to supply reinforcements after Howe's forces left to take Philadelphia. As a result, Burgoyne never received the assistance he needed. Burgoyne's army was now at roughly 6800 men and was surviving on reduced rations. On October 7, 1777, Burgoyne's army attempted to sweep around the American army in a last-ditch effort to escape from being surrounded, but an American counterattack led by General Horatio Gates successfully surrounded the British Army. An offensive by Benedict Arnold (which led to him being wounded in the leg) pushed Burgoyne closer to surrendering. In the end, Burgoyne surrendered his army to the Americans on October 17. This battle would later be known as the turning point of the war. In addition, this battle convinced the French that the American Continentals could beat a European army. As a result, the French joined the war on the side of the Americans. During Benedict Arnold's control over West Point, he began weakening its defenses, including neglecting repairs on the West Point Chain. At the time, Arnold was secretly loyal to the British, and planned to hand off West Point's plans to British major John Andr√© at Snedeker's Landing (or Waldberg Landing) on the wooded west shore of Haverstraw Bay. On September 21, 1780, Andr√© sailed up the river on to meet Arnold. The next morning, an outpost at Verplanck's Point fired on the ship, which sailed back down river. Andr√© was forced to return to New York City by land; however, he was captured near Tarrytown on September 23 by three Westchester militiamen, and later was hanged. Arnold later fled to New York City aboard HMS Vulture. Industrial Revolution =Canal era= The Erie Canal, 2009 At the beginning of the 19th century, transportation away from the US east coast was difficult. Boat travel was still the fastest mode of transportation at the time, as automobiles and rail transportation were still being developed. In order to facilitate boat travel throughout the interior of the United States, numerous canals were constructed between internal bodies of water in the country. These canals would transfer freight throughout the inland US. One of the most significant canals of this era was the Erie Canal. For about a hundred years, various groups had sought to have a canal built between the Great Lakes and the Hudson River. This would link the frontier region of the United States to the Port of New York, a significant seaport during that time period as it is today. Construction of the canal began in 1817 and finished in 1825. Originally called \\"Clinton's Ditch\\", after NY Governor DeWitt Clinton, the canal proved to be a success, returning revenues of over $121 million after an initial construction cost of only $7 million. After the canal was built, freight could travel from many frontier cities, such as Pittsburgh, Chicago, and Cleveland, to Lake Erie, then to Buffalo and the entrance to the canal, through the canal to the Hudson River, and then south to New York City. The completion of the canal enhanced the development of the American West, allowing settlers to travel west, then send goods back to market in frontier cities, and then eventually export goods via the Hudson River and New York City. The completion of the canal made New York City one of the most vital ports in the nation, surpassing the Port of Philadelphia and ports in Massachusetts. The Erie Canal was not the only canal built that connects to the Hudson River. After the completion of the Erie Canal, smaller canals were built to connect with the new system. The Champlain Canal was built to connect the Hudson River near Troy to the southern end of Lake Champlain. This canal allowed boaters to travel from the St. Lawrence Seaway, and then British cities such as Montreal to the Hudson River and New York City. Another major canal was the Oswego Canal, which connected the Erie Canal to Oswego and Lake Ontario. This canal could be used to bypass Niagara Falls. The Cayuga-Seneca Canal connected the Erie Canal to Cayuga Lake and Seneca Lake. Farther south, the Delaware and Hudson Canal was built between the Delaware River at Honesdale, Pennsylvania, and the Hudson River at Kingston, New York. This canal enabled the transportation of coal, and later other goods as well, between the Delaware and Hudson River watersheds. The combination of these canals made the Hudson River one of the most vital waterways for trade in the nation. In 1823, Troy's dam and lock were completed; its sloop lock was rebuilt in 1854. =Hudson River School= Robert Havell, Jr., View of the Hudson River from Tarrytown Hudson River School paintings reflect three themes of America in the 19th century: discovery, exploration, and settlement. The paintings also depict the American landscape as a pastoral setting, where human beings and nature coexist peacefully. Hudson River School landscapes are characterized by their realistic, detailed, and sometimes idealized portrayal of nature, often juxtaposing peaceful agriculture and the remaining wilderness, which was fast disappearing from the Hudson Valley just as it was coming to be appreciated for its qualities of ruggedness and sublimity. In general, Hudson River School artists believed that nature in the form of the American landscape was an ineffable manifestation of God, though the artists varied in the depth of their religious conviction. They took as their inspiration such European masters as Claude Lorrain, John Constable and J. M. W. Turner. Their reverence for America's natural beauty was shared with contemporary American writers such as Henry David Thoreau and Ralph Waldo Emerson. The D√ºsseldorf school of painting had a direct influence on the Hudson River School. The school characterizes the artistic body, its New York location, its landscape subject matter, and often its subject, the Hudson River. While the elements of the paintings were rendered realistically, many of the scenes were composed as a synthesis of multiple scenes or natural images observed by the artists. In gathering the visual data for their paintings, the artists would travel to extraordinary and extreme environments, which generally had conditions that would not permit extended painting at the site. During these expeditions, the artists recorded sketches and memories, returning to their studios to paint the finished works later. The artist Thomas Cole is generally acknowledged as the founder of the Hudson River School. Cole took a steamship up the Hudson in the autumn of 1825, the same year the Erie Canal opened, stopping first at West Point, then at Catskill landing. He hiked west high up into the eastern Catskill Mountains of New York State to paint the first landscapes of the area. The first review of his work appeared in the New York Evening Post on November 22, 1825. At that time, only the English native Cole, born in a landscape where autumnal tints were of browns and yellows, found the brilliant autumn hues of the area to be inspirational. Cole's close friend, Asher Durand, became a prominent figure in the school as well. Painters Frederic Edwin Church and Albert Bierstadt were the most successful painters of the school. 19th and 20th centuries View of the Hudson during the 1880s showing Jersey City The first railroad in New York, the Mohawk and Hudson Railroad, opened in 1831 between Albany and Schenectady on the Mohawk River, enabling passengers to bypass the slowest part of the Erie Canal. The Hudson Valley proved attractive for railroads, once technology progressed to the point where it was feasible to construct the required bridges over tributaries. The Troy and Greenbush Railroad was chartered in 1845 and opened that same year, running a short distance on the east side between Troy and Greenbush, now known as East Greenbush (east of Albany). The Hudson River Railroad was chartered the next year as a continuation of the Troy and Greenbush south to New York City, and was completed in 1851. In 1866 the Hudson River Bridge opened over the river between Greenbush and Albany, enabling through traffic between the Hudson River Railroad and the New York Central Railroad west to Buffalo. When the Poughkeepsie Bridge opened in 1889, it became the longest single-span bridge in the world. The New York, West Shore and Buffalo Railway began at Weehawken Terminal and ran up the west shore of the Hudson as a competitor to the merged New York Central and Hudson River Railroad. Construction was slow, and was finally completed in 1884; the New York Central purchased the line the next year. The Upper Hudson River Valley was also useful for railroads. Sections of the Rensselaer and Saratoga Railroad, Troy and Boston Railroad and Albany Northern Railroad ran next to the Hudson between Troy and Mechanicville. North of Mechanicville the shore was bare until Glens Falls, where the short Glens Falls Railroad ran along the east shore. At Glens Falls the Hudson turns west to Corinth before continuing north; at Corinth the Adirondack Scenic Railroad begins to run along the Hudson's west bank. The original Adirondack Railway opened by 1871, ending at North Creek along the river. In World War II an extension opened to Tahawus, the site of valuable iron and titanium mines. The extension continued along the Hudson River into Hamilton County, and then continued north where the Hudson makes a turn to the west, crossing the Hudson and running along the west shore of the Boreas River. South of Tahawus the route returned to the east shore of the Hudson the rest of the way to its terminus. During the Industrial Revolution, the Hudson River became a major location for production, especially around Albany and Troy. The river allowed for fast and easy transport of goods from the interior of the Northeast to the coast. Hundreds of factories were built around the Hudson, in towns including Poughkeepise, Newburgh, Kingston, and Hudson. The North Tarrytown Assembly (later owned by General Motors), on the river in Sleepy Hollow, was a large and notable example. The river links to the Erie Canal and Great Lakes, allowing manufacturing in the Midwest, including automobiles in Detroit, to use the river for transport. With industrialization came new technologies for transport, including steamboats for faster transport. In 1807, the North River Steamboat (later known as Clermont), became the first commercially successful steamboat. It carried passengers between New York City and Albany along the Hudson River. On September 14, 1901, then-US Vice President Theodore Roosevelt was at Lake Tear of the Clouds after returning from a hike to the Mount Marcy summit when he received a message informing him that President William McKinley, who had been shot two weeks earlier but was expected to survive, had taken a turn for the worse. Roosevelt hiked down the mountain to the closest stage station at Long Lake, New York. He then took a midnight stage coach ride through the Adirondacks to the Adirondack Railway station at North Creek, where he discovered that McKinley had died. Roosevelt took the train to Buffalo, New York, where he was officially sworn in as President. The 40-mile route is now designated the Roosevelt-Marcy Trail. In 1910, pilot Glenn Curtiss broke the American flight distance record. He flew his plane for five hours from a field near Albany to Governor's Island just south of Manhattan, flying over the Hudson River for most of his flight. The flight was 152 miles long, and he made one planned stop in Poughkeepsie, which was roughly the midpoint of the flight. He also made an unplanned stop just south of Spuyten Duyvil in Uptown Manhattan because he was low on fuel. A train full of reporters followed his plane the entire way, and the mayor of Albany gave Curtiss a letter to give to the mayor of New York City. Importantly, Curtiss' flight demonstrated that aircraft could eventually be used as a means for transportation between two major cities. From 1946 to 1971, the Hudson River Reserve Fleet (part of the US National Defense Reserve Fleet) was located on the Hudson River. In 1965, governor Nelson Rockefeller proposed the Hudson River Expressway, a limited-access highway from the Bronx to Beacon. An 8-mile section was built from Ossining to Peekskill, now part of U.S. Route 9; the rest of the highway was never built due to local opposition. Contemporary US Airways Flight 1549 on the Hudson River In 2004, Christopher Swain became the first person to swim the entire length of the Hudson River. The swim took 36 days to complete, along the entire 315 miles of the Hudson from the Adirondacks to New York City. Swain took part in the swim in order to bring attention to the need to make the river safe for drinking and swimming. He braved a combination of rapids, dams, snapping turtles, and pollution in order to complete his journey. The marathon swim was a major part of Swim for the River, a documentary detailing the history of pollution in the Hudson River and the fight against it. Jersey City (foreground), the Hudson River and Lower Manhattan (background) On January 15, 2009, US Airways Flight 1549 made an emergency ditching onto the Hudson River beside Manhattan. The flight was a domestic commercial passenger flight with 150 passengers and 5 crew members traveling from LaGuardia Airport in New York City to Charlotte Douglas International Airport in Charlotte. After striking a flock of Canada geese during its initial climb out, the airplane lost engine power and ditched in the Hudson River off Midtown Manhattan with no loss of human life. All 155 occupants safely evacuated the airliner, and were quickly rescued by nearby ferries and other watercraft. The airplane was still virtually intact though partially submerged and slowly sinking. The entire crew of Flight 1549 was later awarded the Master's Medal of the Guild of Air Pilots and Air Navigators. It was described by NTSB board member Kitty Higgins as \\"the most successful ditching in aviation history\\". On October 3, 2009 the Poughkeepsie- Highland Railroad Bridge reopened as the Walkway over the Hudson. It is a pedestrian walkway over the Hudson River that opened as part of the Hudson River Quadricentennial Celebrations, and it connects over 25 miles of existing pedestrian trails. In 2016, a humpback whale was spotted swimming in the Hudson River west of 63rd Street in Manhattan. Whales have become a more common site in the river recently. This is because of a combination of cleanup of waste in the river as well as conservation of wildlife that creates a hospitable habitat for the whales. Whales have been spotted all the way up to the George Washington Bridge. The whales are especially prominent during feeding season in the fall. State and federal officials are warning kayakers and boaters to slow down and stay at least 100 feet from any whales in the area in order to not distress or hurt the whales.

Rumsey (June 6, 1842 ‚Äì June 17, 1919), also referred to by her married name, Elida Fowle, was a singer, philanthropist, and Union nurse during the American Civil War. Too young to join Dorothea Dix's army nursing service, Rumsey volunteered alongside her husband for three years of the war.  Early life  Elida Barker Rumsey was born in New York City on June 6, 1842, the daughter of John Wickliffe Rumsey and Mary Agnes Underhill Rumsey. Her father owned a hosiery shop, and later worked in banking. As a child, Rumsey's parents moved to Washington, D.C. which began Rumsey's interest in political action. At the time of southern secession, Rumsey was engaged to John A. Fowle who was employed in the Navy. Because of their closeness to the capital and Fowle's work, the couple was interested in serving in the Civil War, particularly in a philanthropic manner.  Civil War Service  In November 1861, Rumsey began her hospital service. She worked for the Union Army specifically, but was known to help and serve any injured soldier regardless of their loyalties. In addition to nursing, Rumsey used her singing voice towards the war effort. She sang to a crowd of soldiers at a prisoner exchange, in an effort to lift their spirits, as well as at Sunday evening prayer groups to help raise money for the Soldiers' Free Library. Rumsey would often stand on the rebel flag while singing The Star-Spangled Banner in an effort to rouse the audience. Among her other performances, she was said to be the first person to sing \\"Battle Hymn of the Republic\\" in a public venue, in Washington, D.C. Rumsey served in numerous hospitals in the D.C. area for a total of three years. She made crutches and canes for wounded soldiers which were stored in the Soldiers' Free Library along with other donations, which she helped to organize and fund. She also took supplies and over four hundred loaves of bread to the Second Battle of Bull Run. En route to the battle, she and her husband came across a small cabin which they turned into a makeshift hospital. Rumsey carried water for the patients from over two miles away. She left the war with her own scars from blood poisoning.  Personal life  Elida Rumsey married John Allen Fowle in 1863, on the floor of the U.S. House of Representatives, the same day the Soldiers' Free Library building was dedicated in Washington, D.C. The couple moved Brooklyn after the war, where they were active in the Congregational church led by Henry Ward Beecher. They moved to Dorchester, Massachusetts in 1877. They raised four children together, including a war orphan, Jeannie, whom they adopted; a fifth child died young. They marked their fiftieth wedding anniversary in 1913, with a reception at the Massachusetts State House. In her later years, Elida Rumsey Fowle was active in veterans' organizations in New England, and founded the Grandchildren of Veterans of the Civil War. She started another free library, volunteered at a hospital, and worked in various charity homes for aged women, intemperate women, working women, aged couples. She was widowed when John A. Fowle died in 1916, and she died in 1919, aged 77 years, in Dorchester.  In popular culture  In 1913, Rumsey's story was fictionalized for a silent film, Song Bird of the North. The Rumsey character was played by Anita Stewart. References   External links  Catalogue of Civil War Relics, 1862-1863-1864 donated by John A.

He was appointed as the ruler in 1883 by the French Picpus missionaries in the island to represent their interest after a two decade interval in the native kingship caused by the disruptions of Westernization. Although a member of the Miru clan, traditionally associated with the native kingship, he was not a royal of the traditional patrilineal line of kings. In 1888, he signed a treaty of annexation ceding Easter Island to Chile in a ceremony officiated by Captain Policarpo Toro. His name is translated as \\"Adam the Gannet\\". Life and reign He was born around 1850 as an extended member of the Miru clan, traditionally associated with the native kingship (ariki mau). Due to Peruvian slave raiding and the decimation of the native Rapa Nui population by introduced diseases, the population of Easter Island had dropped to 110 individuals by 1877. In 1864, the French Picpus missionaries established themselves on the island and converted many of the Rapa Nui people to Christianity. The last recognized ‚Äòariki mau Kerekorio Manu Rangi died in a tuberculosis epidemic in 1867. After this social upheaval, a Council of State was established under the leadership of French adventurer and sheep rancher Jean-Baptiste Dutrou-Bornier who asserted more and more control and expelled the Catholic missionaries. He installed his wife Koreto as the unrecognized \\"Queen\\" of the island and unsuccessfully petitioned France for protectorate status. Dutrou-Bornier was assassinated in 1876 and the Roman Catholic mission returned. His business interest was inherited by the Anglo-Jewish-Tahitian Prince Alexander Ariipaea Salmon who managed a sheep ranch which constituted much of the land on the island. Salmon ruled in all but name. The reestablished mission set up a new native government based on the indigenous district councils of Tahiti. At the instigation of Bishop Tepano Jaussen of Tahiti, Atamu was appointed by Father Hippolyte Roussel as King in 1883 to represent their interest alongside two to‚Äòopae (councillors) and two judges. He adopted the additional name Maurata after the ariki mau who died during the Peruvian slave raids. Unlike his predecessors, Atamu was not considered a member of the traditional royal patrilineal line and held little political power. He married Ana Eva Hei Vehi (Uka  ªa Hei  ªa  ªArero), sometimes known as \\"Queen Eva\\", who was one of the last Rapa Nui people to have been tattooed in the traditional ways. They had six children including their eldest son Atamu ‚ÄúHango‚Äù Tekena Hei. =Annexation to Chile= Tahitian and Rapa Nui translation on the left and Spanish translation on the right In 1887, Captain Policarpo Toro was sent by the government of Chile to purchase Salmon's sheep ranch and negotiate the annexation the island from the Catholic mission authority in Tahiti. Toro landed in Easter Island the following year and on 9 September 1888, Atamu and eleven chiefs signed a treaty of annexation ceding the island to Chile. During the annexation ceremony, Atamu gave Toro a handful of grass to feed his livestock and took a handful of dirt and put it in his jacket, staking his people's sovereign claim to the land. Historian Lorenz Gonschor questions the authenticity of the annexation treaty due to the ambiguity of the bilingual versions. The Rapa Nui language version only made Chile the island's protector while the Spanish language version ceded the island's sovereignty in perpetuity. Despite the fact missionaries had been educating the islanders for more than twenty years, none of the chiefs signed their names to the document and merely wrote \\"+\\" next to their names. The treaty was also never ratified by Chile. Gonschor noted: > During the annexation ceremony, King Atamu Tekena gave Toro a bunch of grass > while he put a handful of soil in his pocket, underlining his understanding > of giving to Chile only the right to use the land, but not the land itself. > It is also said that the Chilean flag was hoisted beneath the Rapanui flag > on the same flagpole, thus acknowledging the sovereign status of the > island's native government. Captain Toro set up a colony with his brother Pedro Pablo Toro as the agent of colonization. The Rapa Nui people seemed oblivious to the take over; they believed they had only become a protectorate and still retain their independence. This Chilean colony co-existed and consulted with the native government and Atamu and his chiefs retained their titles. The colony was temporarily abandoned in 1892 after political unrest in Chile prompted many colonists to return to the mainland. Atamu died on August 1892. After his death, the Rapa Nui people elected Simeon Riro KƒÅinga as the next king. Legacy The island's main avenue, Avenida Atamu Tekena, in Hanga Roa, was renamed in 1998 after the 19th-century king. It was previously named Avenida Policarpo Toro after the Chilean captain who initiated the annexation of Easter Island. A bust of the king was created in 2000 by Rapa Nui artist Tebo Pakarati and placed next to an older bust of Captain Toro in the Plaza Policarpo Toro, the main square of Hanga Roa.

Founded in 1758 by the Archbishop of Vienna, Christoph Anton Migazzi, the seminary moved to its current building, the Haus Boltzmanngasse, in 1914. Today, the rector is Rev. Richard Tatzreiter and enrollment is 35.  History  The Archiepiscopal Seminary of Vienna was founded in 1758 by Count Christoph Anton Migazzi, the Archbishop of Vienna, as the main seminary for the training of priests for the Archdiocese of Vienna. For many years, it was located in the Curhaus in Stephansplatz, the same square in Vienna where St. Stephen's Cathedral is located. The building was expanded in 1805 during the reign of Archbishop Sigismund Anton von Hohenwart in order to accommodate more seminarians. By 1912, the seminary had grown to 112 seminarians. Haus Boltzmanngasse, home of the Seminary of Vienna since 1914. During the reign of Cardinal Franz Xaver Nagl, the Haus Boltzmanngasse, a former hospital and later orphanage in the Alsergrund district of Vienna, was restored and expanded. The new archbishop, Friedrich Gustav Piffl, made the decision to move the seminary from Curhaus to Boltzmanngasse. The seminary made the move in the summer of 1914, and has remained in the new building ever since. Beginning with the 2012‚Äì2013 academic year, seminarians from the Burgenl√§ndisches Seminary and St. P√∂lten Seminary will be living and studying in the Seminary of Vienna facilities. In 2014, the seminary had 35 seminarians.  Administration and organization  Rev. Richard Tatzreiter is the seminary rector, and Rev. Markus Muth is vice rector. Rev. Michael Me√üner, SJ, is the spiritual director, and Michael Sipka is the librarian.  Student life  = Student body = In 2014, there were 35 seminarians at the Seminary of Vienna.

Legends about its formation  There are many Native American Legends about the formation of Scargo Lake, and all are some variant of a tale of Princess Scargo. One story is that a man from another tribe brought the princess four fish, and he promised to return before the fish died. The princess was said to have had a small pond dug to keep the fish in, but woke one morning to find that the pond had dried up, and all but one fish had died. Her tears kept the last fish alive until her father dug a lake for it. The boundary of this lake was determined by where four arrows of a tribesman landed. Once the lake was complete, the fish survived, and the man from the other tribe fulfilled his promise to return to the princess. More commonly heard is the story of a princess who was given three fish in a pumpkin by a young brave going off to war. He was gone so long that the fish began to outgrow the pumpkin. She then had the women of the village dig out the pond with clam shells so the fish could survive. The dirt the women dug out became Scargo Hill. Today it is the highest hill in the mid-Cape area. Another legend is very similar, but she dug a hole in the ground (considered by many to be fish-shaped). The dirt from the hole was said to become the 160-foot Scargo Hill, and that the hole filled up with water from the heavy autumn rains, which also drowned the princess. She was seen as a sacrifice, and the reason the lake is well stocked with fish. Another says that an Indian named Maushop dug out the pond, and then lit his pipe. The smoke from the pipe attracted dark clouds from which rain fell and filled the pond.  Beaches  There are two public beaches on Scargo Lake: Princess Beach, which is sandy and Scargo Beach, which has sand dumped in the water, but no sandy area by the water.  Fishing  Scargo Lake is stocked in spring and fall with brook, brown, and rainbow trout, all of which are allowed to be fished. A wide shelf of shallow water makes for easy wading and access to deeper water. This shelf makes Scargo Lake a popular pond for fly fishing. Scargo Lake is located between Massachusetts Route 6A and Scargo Hill Road, and is easily reached off of route 6A. There are three town landings, all of which are suitable for launching light draft boats and canoes. Two are accessible via dirt roads immediately off Route 6A on the western side, and the remaining one on the northern cove can be reached from an unnamed road off the intersection of Route 6A and Sesuit Neck Road. A 7.5 horsepower limit on outboard motors is enforced by the town.

Life Maria Graves Beckett was born in Portland, Maine. Her father, Charles Beckett (ca. 1813-1866), was a druggist who taught himself to paint after realizing his passion for it. He was \\"the first native- born Portland Mainer to succeed in the landscape genre\\" and \\"exhibited at the American Art Union in 1847, 49, and 50\\".Paul E. Sternberg, Sr., Curator. ‚ÄúPaintings By American Women‚Äù. The Louise and Alan Sellars Collection of Art by American Women. 1989. Print. He raised her in an artistic setting. At the same time the railways were heavily expanding across the United States, Beckett worked with her father to illustrate for her uncle's promotional railroad material. In 1866, the Beckett family was a part of the Great Fire of Portland, an accidental fire started from a mixture consisting of the Fourth of July fireworks, a dry atmosphere, and hot temperatures. It was the most destructive fire at the time in American history; it consumed around two- thousand buildings and left almost ten-thousand of the city's thirteen- thousand citizens homeless. This fire destroyed the Beckett's family home and apothecary business and also attributes to her father's death two months later of ‚Äúparalytic shock‚Äù. After this tragedy, Maria, her mother, and her brother John converted to Catholicism. \\"Maria and John dropped the second 't' from their last name and adopted \\"a‚Äô Becket,\\" aligning themselves with the Medieval Catholic martyr St Thomas a‚Äô Becket\\".Christopher Volpe, ‚ÄúMaria J.C. a‚ÄôBecket: Rediscovering an American Artist,‚Äù (Orono: Maine Historical Society, 2010). Career She worked with the Hudson River School, a group of like-minded artists whom wanted to establish a truly American art, independent of European models. They searched for scenery that fit Romantic conceptions of nature. Their contemporaries in Europe, Th√©odore Rousseau, Jean-Fran√ßois Millet and the artists of the Barbizon school, fully immersed themselves within the nature they used as inspiration. Camille Corot, said to be the most influential of all French landscape painters of the nineteenth century, did not stay in nature like Rousseau and Millet, he always returned to his studio to process his visual experience. William Morris Hunt was one of the first to embrace and promote the Barbizon style in America; Hunt had been studying art in Paris and was in search of a more spontaneous way of handling paint when he came across Millet's The Sower and purchased it. ‚ÄúThe insight of the Barbizon artists was that freer paint handling could capture a fresh appreciation of the spontaneous rhythms of natural scenery‚Äù with which Hunt embraced and brought to America. Hunt began teaching a class in Boston, that Becket joined, taught exclusively for women; this was by default, the French manner of painting was not considered manly enough for American men to want to join. Becket quickly went from Hunt's teaching to the source, seeking Daubigny to study with him in the countryside north of Paris \\"probably in the spring and summer of 1876\\"; Charles-Fran√ßois Daubigny was the most accomplished among the artists who joined Corot in the French country-side during summer months. She and Daubigny were very similar in their Catholic influences and speed of painting. This connection led Becket to become very close with Daubigny and his family; it was rare for an American painter to join his inner circle. It is said \\"Beckett follows Daubigny in her liberated, sketch-like, 'painterly' brushstrokes, her unusual color range, and her choice of patently ordinary 'humble' natural scenery as subject matter. Even Daubigny‚Äôs oft-cited melancholy recalls the 'peculiar sadness' Beckett identified in her own work\\". The river scenery where she and Daubigny studied was a magnet for many well known masters of the 19th century, such as Renoir, Pissarro, Monet, Van Gogh, and C√©zanne. While Becket spent her time in St Augustine, she really distinguished herself as an artist. According to the local society tabloid The Tatler, \\"she held court with her wit as well as her artistic talent. The Ponce de Leon Hotel artists entertained potential patrons and sold their works at weekend gala receptions where Becket shone as a 'brilliant conversationalist, a delightful raconteur' whose social success at times kept her from opening her studio\\".\\"American Art News, Vol. 3, No. 72\\". American Art News 3 (72). The Frick Collection: 1-8. https://www.jstor.org/stable/25590111 She had exhibitions where paintings were rapidly being sold and The Tatler even stated ‚ÄúMiss a Becket paints so rapidly that to see her or hear of the number she adds to her collection sounds like a fairy tale‚Ä¶ Miss a Becket has a number of beautiful pictures on exhibition that are constantly changing, that is, are passing into the hands of purchasers and new ones supplying their place‚Äù. After Becket's death on September 7, 1904, she was described as \\"a painter of uneven power, much truth of perception and at times a vivid sense of color. Some critics assert that at her best Marie a‚Äô Becket was unsurpassed by any American woman landscape painter\\". The Florida Times Union described \\"her success in showing the world what a woman can do despite difficulties that would have driven most men to despair\\", and claimed that her success \\"has encouraged thousands of her weaker sisters in their struggles to make places for themselves, who should rise up and call her blessed\\". It is known that Henry Flagler bought at least two of Becket's works; they are currently displayed in the Presidents Wing, formerly known as the men's lounge of the Ponce de Leon Hotel, and the Flagler Room, formerly known as the Grand Parlor of the Ponce de Leon Hotel, at Flagler College. a'Becket exhibited her work at the Woman's Building at the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago, Illinois. a'Becket helped blaze a trail for women who wanted to enter the male-dominated world of professional painting in nineteenth-century America. She was able to do while bridging the avant-garde French ideas of Barbizon and its daughter movement, Impressionism, in a wholly American context.

Carr wrote primarily on issues central to vulnerable communities in the Caribbean. The focus of Carr's publications was the intersectionality of poverty, homophobia, and human rights, and what he recognized as their role in producing and perpetuating systemic sexually-based violence and inadequate global, regional, and Jamaican responses to HIV/AIDS. Toronto Canada-based International Council of AIDS Service Organisations (ICASO) established the Robert Carr Award to honor his contributions to ending AIDS.  Early life and education  Carr was born in St. James, Port-of-Spain, Trinidad, on Carnival Saturday. His mother, June Carr, was a school teacher, and his father, Peter Carr, was a public health official with the UN World Health Organization. At the age of seven, Robert and his older sister, Carolyn, moved to Jamaica in April 1970 because their father accepted a position with the United Nations Pan American Health Organization. This move brought Robert in closer contact with the Jamaican side of his family. He attended Meadowbrook Primary School and in 1974 went on to Meadowbrook High School where he stayed until 1980. Still a student at Meadowbrook High School, Carr pursued a part-time course in Poetry and Play Writing at the University of the West Indies (UWI), Mona Campus, in Jamaica. There he not only attended classes, but wrote a play and poetry that was published in the university's official publication, Focus. He moved to Maryland in 1981, just before his 18th birthday, to begin his post- secondary and university education. He attended Johns Hopkins University for his Bachelor‚Äôs Degree in Arts and then the University of Maryland (College Park) for his Master‚Äôs and Doctorate Degrees specializing in African-American Literature. From 1988 to 1998 Carr lived in Washington DC. In 1994, he completed his Doctorate Degree in Philosophy (English). In September 1998, his post-graduate education continued at the St. Augustine Campus of the University of the West Indies in Trinidad, where he completed a one-year Diploma in Social Work, graduating with distinction. He then returned to Jamaica and enrolled in the Master‚Äôs in Social Work program at the Mona Campus of The UWI, where in 2002 he again graduated with distinction.  Career  In 1992 Carr became an Assistant Professor with the Department of English at George Mason University, where he taught until June 1997. He introduced new courses on black literature, and published numerous articles as a subaltern scholar on issues affecting developing countries. His academic focus, however, soon shifted to social studies and social work. Before graduation from UWI in 2001, Carr became Coordinator of the Research and Development Working Group at Jamaica Network of Seropositives (JN+). Between 2002 and 2004, he was also a part-time lecturer with the UWI Mona's Faculty of Social Sciences and taught a Quantitative Research Method course. From 2006 to 2008, he served as the Coordinator of the Graduate Program's Unit at the Caribbean Institute of Media and Communication. Carr went on to serve as a member of the UNAIDS Reference Group on HIV and Human Rights and of the nongovernmental organization delegation to the UNAIDS Programme Coordinating Board, and \\"joined with other global advocates to found the Global Forum on MSM & HIV (MSMGF). He acted as a panelist for numerous Congressional Briefings in Washington, D.C., worked with the LGBT Caucus and assisted with high-level meetings at the United Nations, as well as countless other global policy arenas.\\"Rep. Lee (Cal.). \\"Honoring Dr. Robert Carr,\\" Congressional Record (1 June 2011) E1008-9. Towards the end of his career, he served as Policy and Advocacy Director of the International Council of AIDS Service Organizations. = Jamaica AIDS Support for Life (JASL) = Between late 2001 and mid 2002 Carr worked with the United Kingdom's International HIV/AIDS Alliance and the Jamaica Ministry of Health as a Program Planning Consultant to Jamaica AIDS Support for Life (JASL), providing technical assistance to JASL in the areas of program development and human resource management. His consulting work paved the way for a permanent opportunity with JASL as the Director of Targeted Interventions, and by November 2002, \\"he became Executive Director of Jamaica AIDS Support for Life, a national NGO serving Jamaican society‚Äôs most disenfranchised populations, including prisoners, the hearing impaired, people who use drugs, sex workers, transgender people, and gay and other men who have sex with men.\\" = The Caribbean Vulnerable Communities Coalition (CVC) = By 2005, Carr \\"co-founded and was the first Executive Director of the Caribbean Vulnerable Communities Coalition (CVC), one of the first Caribbean organizations to focus on issues related to the rights and needs of sexual minorities.\\" He originally established the coalition \\"[i]n response to a lack of access to HIV and health services in Jamaica,\\"\\"reaching out to colleagues in Jamaica, Trinidad, St. Lucia and beyond. In December 2004 a call went out to civil society actors attending a meeting of UNAIDS in Montego Bay, Jamaica. They [sic] call was for them to first get together in Kingston to talk about the concerns and the possibility of creating a network of some kind. The meeting included representatives from the Eastern Caribbean, Haiti, Dominican Republic, Trinidad, Curacao, - a cross-section of the French, English, Spanish and Dutch speaking Caribbean. The participants agreed to create a forum through which they could combine efforts. They understood that it would go a far way to help create the political space for the views and voices of the key populations to be heard.\\" The CVC operates as \\"a network of indigenous frontline service providers working on rights-based programming with marginalized groups across the Caribbean.\\" Today, several aspects of the organization‚Äôs work include helping to strengthen the Caribbean Sex Worker Coalition, collaborating with the Caribbean Forum for Liberation and Acceptance of Genders and Sexualities and supporting burgeoning transgender groups in different countries.\\" = Global Forum on MSM & HIV (MSMGF) = \\"In 2006, Robert joined with other global advocates to found the Global Forum on MSM & HIV (MSMGF) in recognition of the lack of attention to gay men and other MSM in the global HIV epidemic.\\" At the MSMGF, Carr served as a mentor ‚Äì \\"not just for the organization, but to other activists from emerging MSM regional networks throughout the world.\\"  Activism  Carr also felt that while targeted programs must address the issues of education, economics, health and wellbeing for vulnerable populations, the enabling environment that drove their marginalization‚Äîwhat he saw as \\"a constant assault on the humanity of gay and bisexual people from elected officials, homophobic dance hall artists, and religious leaders who believe that gay rights are against God‚Äôs will\\"‚Äîmust also be changed to facilitate their advancement. He therefore worked with his dedicated team of activists to dismantle the homophobic attitudes and promote the establishment of a safer, more inclusive environment as a key component of their programs, particularly as it related to the national legal and policy frameworks that supported this marginalization. His work as a human rights activist not only embraced this need for legislative and policy changes to remove discrimination and stigma but also the establishment of specific programs managed by marginalized groups to empower them and address their health and social needs. Including health and social needs directly tied to a legacy of violence: > 'There were no treatments available in the Caribbean [initially...], so AIDS > really was a death sentence. You had people with Kaposi's sarcoma, people > with violent diarrhea, who were just wasting away and then dying in really > horrible and traumatic ways.' The terror induced by these deaths, combined > with an already intense local culture of homophobia [produced] a violent > backlash. 'To call what was going on here \\"stigma and discrimination\\" was > really an understatement. In the ghettos they were putting tires around > people who had AIDS and lighting the tires on fire. They were killing gay > people because they thought AIDS was contagious. It was a very extreme > environment, and really horrible things were happening.' Carr brought human rights activists together to formulate strategic plans to establish a Caribbean regional organization of vulnerable groups to strengthen their role as advocates, to empower them to address their priority health problems and to change the political, legal, economic and social environment that reinforces their persistent marginalization through stigma and discrimination, reinforcing, \\"'[t]he change has to come from within; it really has to be Caribbean people taking a stand against this kind of violence and abuse, and against‚Ä¶misinformed, emotionally based, irresponsible attempts at policy making.'\\" They held meetings in the sanctity of Carr‚Äôs home and other safe spaces to create the Caribbean Vulnerable Communities Coalition (CVC) working with key allies to establish the legal, administrative structure and functions as well as funding mechanisms so that the Coalition became a sustainable reality. > In 2004, Carr and his colleagues began a social change campaign to break the > silence on violence against men who have sex with men in Jamaica, stimulate > public dialogue and change the institutional attitudes and behaviours. The > programme approach used by Carr and his colleagues has included > interpersonal communication, institutional communication, mass media and > other traditional information, education and communication tools.

Carr‚Äôs regional and global reputation and his ability to relate to CARICOM, International Funding Agencies and United Nations agencies such as UNAIDS, UNFPA, UNIFEM and UNDP gave the Coalition critical funding for its strategic objectives; writing, > My focus is HIV/AIDS which most dramatically infects and affects the poor in > the Caribbean‚Ä¶ I straddle the poles of helping those on the ground stay in > their homes, find the hope that is medically proven to prolong and improve > the quality of their lives, even as I battle with the donor agencies whose > policies are set in the metropoles and who all too often find their hands > tied by right-wing politics that dominate the West.

Because of his advocacy at international conferences and at meetings of the UNAIDS Reference groups on HIV and Human Rights, other working groups, and advisory committees he was able to raise concerns about the urgency of addressing the needs of vulnerable populations across all nations as part of a global strategy. His presentations at international meetings included his famous ‚ÄúBullshit Address‚Äù presentation in Vienna in July 2010 during closing remarks at the Plenary Session MSMG Forum Pre- Conference Meeting to the International AIDS Conference in Vienna, Austria (You Tube: The Global forum on MSM & HIV: Part 5: Closing Plenary; Robert Carr; Vienna July 2010). Carr became a global champion of the rights of vulnerable populations and worked with international agencies to promote human rights and access to critical services. He was also strong promoter of gender issues: many of his publications reflected his concern over the marginalization of women in society.  Writing and scholarship  \\"The author of several books, Dr. Carr wrote extensively on human rights and HIV, as well as on the social context that drives stigma and discrimination.\\" He was \\"widely recognized as one of the world‚Äôs leading researchers on cultural forces and the unfolding of the AIDS pandemic.\\" Described as a part of \\"a new generation of Caribbean and African descent intellectuals who form part of a larger formation of New World black intellectuals[,] two of the central themes of Carr's work‚Äîhow geographical relationships of power have shaped the politics and the history of the New World and how black subjects have located themselves within those geographies of power[‚Äî]offer[ed] new models of interdisciplinary and cross- cultural analysis for both African American and Caribbean studies.\\" Carr's doctoral thesis was the basis for his first book, Black Nationalism in the New World: Readings in the African American and West Indian Experience in 2002. The book was part of the Latin America Otherwise Series published by Duke University to give a ‚Äúnew dimension to the concept of subalternity by linking, on the one hand, the history of colonial India to the colonial history of slavery in the Caribbean and in the United States, and on the other, by showing that colonial subalternity, as it has been defined by the South Asian Studies collective, always has a 'color'.\\" As an academic, Carr believed in the power of research to drive policies and programs. In addition to pioneering studies on the vulnerable populations that were the focus of his organizations' intervention programs, he was committed \\"to translating findings from research collaborations between community and academic partners into tangible policy development and advocacy efforts.\\" He also published numerous papers, journal articles, and book chapters on HIV vulnerability issues.

It was directed by Ted Nicolaou. Plot A man tries to prevent the building of a theme park on top of a land that's is the home to Leprechauns.

It was filmed mostly in Romania. Reception Leapin' Leprechauns received mostly unfavorable reviews from critics. The lack of a clear storyline and an \\"all-out villain\\" were appointed by many experts as critique points. Felix Vasquez from Cinema Crazed stated: Leapin' Leprechauns! \\"is not the worst movie I‚Äôve ever seen, but it‚Äôs probably the most baffling I‚Äôve seen in a good while. The film takes literally a half hour to get the actual plot in motion, and we spend about twenty long minutes on a leprechaun council meeting where the leprechauns and fairies argue and bicker non-stop. As for a villain of the piece, we don‚Äôt meet the evil menace until there‚Äôs only ten minutes left in the actual movie. I couldn‚Äôt understand why the villain was introduced before the credits actually began, but the writers fails to muster up an interesting bad guy\\". For MonsterHunt \\"Leapin' Leprechauns! is as unambitious as the leprechauns‚Äô use of their magic powers and so pedestrian in every thing it attempts that if old King Kevin popped out of my garbage giving me three wishes, my first wish would be that I never saw or heard of this movie. My second wish would be the same just as a backup in case for some reason the first wish failed. And my third wish? Talking dog. Duh. I‚Äôm not wasting them all!\\". TV Guide was optimistic with the lack of an \\"all-out villain \\", but criticized the poor visual effects: \\"The lack of an all-out villain makes LEAPIN' LEPRECHAUNS! a nice change from the usual routine of live-action family films, though cut-rate special effects limit the title figures in their interaction with other characters\\".

Incident The vessels involved in the incident were the Nebraska, a cargo ship owned by Swedish company Rederi A/B Transatlantic, and the Empress Bay, a tanker owned by New York-based Petroleum Tankers Corporation. At the time of the collision, Nebraska was bound south from New Haven, Connecticut to Newark, New Jersey with a cargo of automobiles and Empress Bay was outbound from Bayonne, New Jersey to Mount Vernon, New York with of gasoline. At 00:22 local time, Nebraska rammed Empress Bay amidships, triggering an explosion of gasoline aboard the tanker and spilling oil that ignited on the surface of the river. The ships collided almost directly under the Manhattan Bridge, and flames reached about upwards to scorch the bridge's deck and damage subway tracks. Two tugboats, eight New York Fire Department fireboats, and eleven Coast Guard patrol boats responded to the collision, and the fire was controlled by about 01:15. The spread of the gasoline slick led the Coast Guard to close the river in the area until the middle of the day, and smoking was banned on the waterfront until that evening. 43 people were on board Nebraska and eight on Empress Bay. 37 sailors were injured, and two Empress Bay crewmembers, engineer Thomas Erickson and cook Otto Ahrens, were killed. William Finn, a New York Journal-American photographer, died of a heart attack as he was taking pictures of the disaster. Nebraska remained afloat after the collision and was sailed to a Hudson River pier, while Empress Bay was partially submerged and later completely sank during the early morning of June 26. She was subsequently abandoned by her owners, leaving her the responsibility of the Army Corps of Engineers. The Corp requested bids from private firms to salvage her, and she was eventually refloated on September 9.

She is currently the Artistic Director of Baltimore Center Stage. In light of the current state of the world, she co-founded the Artists' Anti-Racism Coalition, a grassroots effort to help the Off-Broadway community dismantle systems of exclusion and oppression. Originally from San Antonio, Texas, Ybarra holds an undergraduate degree from Baylor University and an MFA from the Yale School of Drama. Early life and education Ybarra grew up in San Antonio Texas, and identifies as multi-ethnic. She completed her Bachelor of Fine Arts at Baylor University in Waco, Texas, in 1999. While at Baylor, she was a member of Zeta Tau Alpha sorority and was a part of the Theatre Student Society. In 2005, Ybarra began her MFA in Theatre Management at Yale University and completed her graduate degree in 2008. While at Yale, Ybarra served as the Associate Managing Director on the Yale School of Drama's 2008 production of Romeo and Juliet. She is also a former board member of the Yale Latino Alumni Association.  Career  = Early career = Her post-collegiate career began in 1999 when Ybarra began work at the Dallas Children's Theatre. After two years serving as the assistant development director and two years as the publications manager, Ybarra moved to Boston. In Boston, she served as the deputy director of program operations for Citizen Schools, a non-profit organization which offers academic enrichment opportunities to low-income and underserved communities. After two years at Citizen Schools, Ybarra began her master's degree at Yale and worked as the associate managing director of Yale School of Drama and new play development from 2007 to 2008. Ybarra also made her New York producing debut in 2007 with The Brothers Size by Tarrell McCraney at The Public Theater's Under the Radar Festival. She then went on to work as the interim general manager at Two River Theatre Company and then the producing director at The Playwrights Realm, a nonprofit off-Broadway theater which supports new and emerging playwrights in developing their works. With The Playwirghts Realm, Ybarra produced early career playwrights including Anna Ziegler, Jen Silverman, and Gonzalo Rodriguez Risco. Some of Ybarra's other producing credits include the following: \\"Mentor Project\\" at Cherry Lane Theater, Finding Ways by Snehal Desai at HERE Arts Center, We Play for the Gods, by the 2010‚Äì2012 Lab at Women's Project Theatre, One Night With Rael, by Timothy Charles Brown at Ars Nova's A.N.T.

In that position, Ybarra led the Mobile Unit and Public Forum Programs, and was a member of the cabinet leadership team. The Mobile Unit is the branch of the Public Theater based on the notion that \\"culture belongs to all,\\" which performs free Shakespeare plays across the five boroughs in prisons, homeless shelters, and community centers. = Baltimore Center Stage = In 2018, Stephanie Ybarra was appointed as the Artistic Director of Baltimore Center Stage, in Baltimore, MD. She is the first Latinx theater artist to be named the Artistic Director of a LORT Theatre.  Producing Style  Ybarra is a self-described \\"creative producer.\\" In her work, she seeks to find a delicate balance of creativity and business acumen, explaining that, in her opinion, producers ought to have a place in the room where creative processes and decisions are occurring. She speaks openly about the Producers' role in both facilitating and contributing to the artistic process and notes that in her 2012 production of We Play Gods, collaboration was essential to her ability to serve the artists working on the piece. Ybarra says that her artistic superpower is \\"being able to speak fluently in both the artistic and business vocabularies, and using the art and the commerce to make both thrive.\\" At the Public, Ybarra has focused her energies on \\"radical inclusivity\\" with the Mobile Unit and, in 2017, has brought a Cuban-inspired version of Shakespeare's Twelfth Night to venues including New York City's Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual & Transgender Community Center and Rikers Island Correction Facility. Those who have worked with Ybarra describe her as a collaborator who brings a sense of humor to the theatrical process. Ybarra, whose theatrical roots are in acting, claims that she is still figuring out the relationship between her artistic interests and her organizational and leadership skills. She has a talent for facilitating artistic processes through a strong emphasis on collaboration and involvement in artistic conversations. Furthermore, in her work with the Mobile Unit, Ybarra works under the philosophy of \\"be[ing] humans together\\" which she uses to guide actors as they make art in spaces, including correctional facilities, which are actively working to oppress people.

He was a member of the Brunei national representative team for the Malaysian league that won the 1999 Malaysia Cup. He is a versatile player who has played at various positions throughout his career. Club career =Brunei= Initially a central defender, Norsillmy was a relative newcomer to the Brunei squad that was competing in the Malaysian M-League in 1999, coached by Englishman David Booth. Although they finished seventh in Premier One, they began a hot streak in the subsequent Malaysia Cup campaign which concluded with winning the silverware, Brunei's first in 20 years of participation. Norsillmy played in that final, a 2-1 victory over Sarawak hosted at the Merdeka Stadium in Kuala Lumpur. Due to the restriction of import players in the following season, then coach Mick Jones started to place Norsillmy in attack, complimenting the diminutive Riwandi Wahit in a little-and-large combination. Both of them only managed to score five goals each as the lack of foreign firepower condemned Brunei to the foot of the table and relegation to Premier Two. Norsillmy stayed with the Wasps until the 2004 season, scoring 22 goals in the role of a striker. =Later career= Norsillmy played for Wijaya FC in the domestic B-League, winning the 2002 FA Cup and the 2003 championship. In fact, he scored the solitary winning goal against MS ABDB in the first FA Cup final. He left Wijaya for Jerudong FC in 2009, then accepted an invitation to train and possibly play for Brunei's professional club DPMM FC in late 2011, in view of the 2012 S.League. Despite putting pen to paper on a professional contract, he unfortunately failed the mandatory fitness test required by the S.League and failed to make his debut for the Gegar Gegar men. Norsillmy joined ambitious Majra FC at the start of the 2012-13 Brunei Super League and finished third in the new league. He moved to Najip FC in the following season, one of several big names to join the club that did not gain a single point the season before. His brief but fruitful stay led Najip FC to third-place in the league as well as an FA Cup final appearance. Norsillmy dropped a division in 2015, joining Kota Ranger FC in the Brunei Premier League, and finished in first place unbeaten. Promotion to the 2016 Brunei Super League ensued, and he scored five goals to finish second in the goalscoring charts, despite his club only managing a sixth-place finish. International career Norsillmy made his international debut for the Brunei national team on 2 August 1999 against Cambodia in a 3-3 draw at the 20th SEA Games hosted by his home country. He gained 14 caps for the Wasps, his final tournament being the 2004 AFC Asian Cup qualification games against Maldives and Myanmar in March 2003.

Early life Elvis Gonz√°lez Valencia was born on 12 October 1980, in Aguililla, Michoac√°n, Mexico. His parents were J. Abigael Gonz√°lez Mendoza (father) and Estela Valencia Far√≠as (mother). According to the United States Department of the Treasury, he has an alternative date of birth, 18 March 1979, and an alternative legal alias, Alejandro Tapia Castro. He is commonly referred to by his alias \\"El Elvis\\". Gonz√°lez Valencia also had two Unique Population Registry Codes (CURP), a unique identifier of Mexican citizens and residents. According to the Mexican government, the Gonz√°lez Valencia clan was made up of 18 siblings. The males are Abigael, Jos√© Mar√≠a, Arnulfo, Ulises Jovani, Elvis, √âdgar Ed√©n, Mauricio, Gerardo, Jos√© and Luis √Ångel. The females are Rosalinda (also known as Rosal√≠a), Noem√≠, Berenice, Marisa Ivette, Mar√≠a Elena, √ârika and Abiga√≠l. People in their hometown nicknamed the clan \\"Cuinis\\" in reference to a ground squirrel (Spermophilus adocetus), commonly known as \\"Cuinique\\"; it is common for this squirrel to have litters of over a dozen kits. Criminal career Gonz√°lez Valencia was suspected by Mexican security forces to be a high-ranking leader and top financial operator of the Jalisco New Generation Cartel (CJNG) and Los Cuinis, two criminal groups based in Jalisco. In 2015, Gonz√°lez Valencia's rank within the organizations grew after several of his family members were arrested by Mexican security forces. In 2014‚Äì2015, his nephew Rub√©n Oseguera Gonz√°lez was arrested. his brother Abigael Gonz√°lez Valencia (alias \\"El Cuini\\") in February 2015; and his in-law Antonio Oseguera Cervantes in December 2015. Along with his siblings Gerardo, Jos√© Mar√≠a, Ulises Jovani, √âdgar Ed√©n, and Rosalinda, he began to make major decisions on the financial operations of the two criminal groups. They reported to Nemesio Oseguera Cervantes (alias \\"El Mencho\\"), the top leader of the CJNG and one of Mexico's most-wanted drug lords. Oseguera Cervantes is Gonz√°lez Valencia's brother-in-law because he is married to his sister Rosalinda. According to Jalisco authorities, he was investigated for three charges: two extortion cases and a property damage charge. At a federal level, the Mexican government was investigating him for his alleged involvement in drug trafficking and money laundering. They believe that he was responsible for directing negotiations with criminal groups in the United States and South America to facilitate his criminal operations internationally. In the United States, he was sanctioned by the Foreign Narcotics Kingpin Designation Act (also known as the \\"Kingpin Act\\") on 27 October 2016, for his alleged involvement in money laundering and/or international drug trafficking. This sanction was a result of an investigation by the Treasury Department and the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) office in Los Angeles in an attempt to disrupt the inner circle of the CJNG and affect their finances in Mexico's domestic economy. This sanction was also extended to eight more individuals: Antonio, Julio Alberto Castillo Rodr√≠guez, businessman Fabi√°n Felipe Vera L√≥pez, attorney Mar√≠a Teresa Quintana Navarro, and four of Gonz√°lez Valencia's siblings: Arnulfo, √âdgar Ed√©n, Marisa Ivette, and Noem√≠. They were accused of providing material assistance to Nemesio and Abigael for their criminal operations. As a result, all of Gonz√°lez Valencia's U.S.-based assets were frozen. The act also prohibited U.S. citizens from conducting business transactions with him. Arrest Early in the morning on 2 January 2016, Gonz√°lez Valencia and his companions left San Miguel el Alto, Jalisco, after a meeting and stopped on the side road of a highway to go to the restroom. After they exited their vehicle, a group of gunmen shot them from a moving vehicle. Gonz√°lez Valencia was struck twice in the arm and had one bullet graze. He first visited a rural hospital near San Miguel el Alto to treat his gunshot wounds, but because the wounds were serious, he was taken to a private hospital in Zapopan, Jalisco. At the hospital, he registered using fake identification; Mexican law required the hospital was report any gunshot wound so that the incident could be investigated. In this case, authorities suspected that the victim was not who he posed to be. The first officers to arrive were from the Federal Police and the Fuerza √önica Jalisco, a branch of the state police. They kept Gonz√°lez Valencia under custody to fully identify him, and safeguarded the premises to prevent his attackers from injuring him again or his comrades from orchestrating his escape. The Mexican Army later arrived to help safeguard the area. On 3 January, the SEIDO, Mexico's anti- organized crime investigatory agency, confirmed his identity. His arrest was then confirmed by Jalisco state authorities, who told the press that Gonz√°lez Valencia was under custody in the hospital and that he was a high-ranking member of the CJNG and Los Cuinis. They stated that once Gonz√°lez Valencia was healed, he would be transferred to the SEIDO headquarters in Mexico City. Two days later, he was transferred from Jalisco to the SEIDO installations in Mexico City. On 6 January, Gonz√°lez Valencia was placed under a 40-day preventive detention due to his alleged involvement in criminal activities. The purpose of the preventive detention was to give investigators from the Federal Public Ministry more time to collect more evidences against Gonz√°lez Valencia. His wife Adriana S√°nchez Reyna tried to issue a writ of amparo in favor of her husband in order to prevent his detention. Gonz√°lez Valencia was later imprisoned at the Federal Social Readaptation Center No. 1 (also known as \\"Altiplano\\"), Mexico's maximum-security prison in Almoloya de Ju√°rez, State of Mexico. Release On 23 December 2016, Gonz√°lez Valencia's defense issued two writs of amparo to a State of Mexico court of appeals. The court struck the requests stating that they were not able to notify Gonz√°lez Valencia because he was no longer in prison since 14 December. He was released because a judge considered that there was not sufficient evidence to support the charges of organized crime and illicit enrichment.

White was a freedom suit first filed in Louisiana's Third District Court in October 1857 by 15-year-old Jane (or Alexina) Morrison, a runaway slave, against her purchaser, New Orleans slave trader James White. Morrison, who had \\"a fair complexion, blue eyes, and flaxen hair\\", claimed to be white. In 1857, Morrison was sold by J. G. Haliburton or J. A. Halliburton of Arkansas to longtime New Orleans slave trader James White. She soon ran away and, in October of that year, petitioned the Third District Court in Jefferson Parish (where White resided) to be declared legally free. She claimed she was born of white parents and that her first name was Alexina, not Jane. Further, she asked for $10,000 in damages. She also asked to be placed under the protection of William Dennison, the parish's jailer, and that she be kept in jail to avoid being seized by White. She remained in jail for all but 19 months over the next five years, giving birth to a girl while incarcerated. The case went to trial three times. White provided depositions asserting that a Moses Morrison of Matagorda County, Texas, had purchased her, her siblings and their mother in 1848 for four or five years, before giving her to his nephew in Arkansas. The nephew then allegedly gave her to a slave trader to sell in New Orleans. The defense also produced a bill of sale, which did not constitute legal proof in Louisiana as it was not notarized. The 1850 census listed a seven-year-old female mulatto slave residing in Matagorda County with her family. The plaintiff's lawyers were unable to provide any corroborating evidence of their own, but asserted Morrison was white because she looked and behaved like a white woman. The first trial ended in a mistrial. The jury in the second, held in May 1859 in the Fifth District Court, voted unanimously in Morrison's favor. The third trial was held in New Orleans. That jury, unable to reach a unanimous decision, was permitted, with Morrison's consent, to reach a majority verdict ‚Äì 10‚Äì2 for her ‚Äì in January 1862. White's lawyers appealed again, but a fourth trial never took place (the Union occupied New Orleans in the American Civil War), and with the eventual Union victory came the end of slavery in the United States. Nothing is known about the later life of Morrison or her daughter Mary. References Freedom suits in the United States 1857 in Louisiana 1859 in Louisiana 1862 in Louisiana ","title":"Morrison v.

Set in the year 2067, when veganism is the norm, the film looks back on meat-eating today. It premiered on BBC iPlayer.  Synopsis  Set in 2067, the narrator tells how the world is a happier place, as meat eating (\\"carnism\\") is banned and veganism prevails. Young people express their disbelief on how people could have ever killed and eaten animals. Yasmine Vondenburgen, a psychotherapist, holds support sessions for former carnists to lift the guilt of carnism. In one session, Davina breaks down after naming Edam as a cheese she once ate. The film goes back to 1944, to the establishment of The Vegan Society, and rationing of meat due to war, which ends in 1954. Fanny Cradock promotes carnism in theatre and TV. In the 70s and 80s, US food companies disguise meat as toys children would like to eat, using figures like Ronald McDonald to attract them. Intensive farming leads to BSE crisis and Foot-and-mouth disease. From 2004, many diseases grow due to consumption of processed meats. The film then returns to 2067, with young people using new VR technology to experience eating meat. They stop after a while, unable to process it. Going back to 2017, the film shows how celebrity chefs like Nigella Lawson, Gordon Ramsay, Jamie Oliver and Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall promote carnism instead of veganism. It shows the rise in veganism, helped by people like JME, who inspires Troye King Jones. King Jones then writes a book and makes feature films on veganism. Maude Polikoff, former erotic dancer, reveals she left the career as milk and dairy were used in a sexualised way, in spite of being unethically obtained. Vondenburgen explains how the hierarchy of the British monarchy led to humans believing they should be above animals. The UN urges people to cut down on meat, due to climate change. This is ignored, and the UK faces floods. Lindsay Graber, a victim of these, explains climate change due to meat on TV. Veganism is promoted by TV presenters, but it is ignored, and in 2021 the UK faces a Super Swine Flu, killing many. Intensive farming is banned to prevent a re-occurrence, but this hikes up costs of meat, and many people are confused over what to eat. In 2023, this Era of Confusion is broken by a new celebrity chef Freddy Jayashankar, who re-introduces a plant based Eastern cuisine. It is revealed that King Jones and Jayashankar are in a relationship. Later, a film 'Dorothy is Still Dorothy' is broadcast by the BBC featuring Dorothy, a woman with Alzheimer's who forgets that eating a chicken is normal, much to the annoyance of her son Jeff. In 2024, a musical featuring Amelie dressed as a cow is made, which exposes the horrors of the dairy industry. Albania wins the Eurovision Song Contest by a vegan song. Meanwhile, Graham Watkins speaks out against veganism, harassing vegans on streets and in restaurants. A TV show, 'Mike's Meat House' mocking veganism is started, but cancelled after 4 episodes. Graber returns to TV to explain harsh environmental effects of beef, and suggesting a ban on it, which is not accepted by the British, leading to riots. King Jones appears for an interview on Newsnight. Shortly after that, he is murdered and cannibalised, allegedly by a member of the Great British Meat League. This sparks a revolution, with major food companies including McDonald's and KFC turning vegan, and 75% of UK at least vegetarian; yet there is a reluctance for criminalising carnism. Watkins, with other carnists, states illogical reasons defending carnism. All such arguments are resolved by the invention of a Thought Translator, allowing animals to communicate freely with humans using the recorded voice of Joanna Lumley. The unethical practices of the egg industry are explained. In 2035, the Bill of Animal Rights is finally passed, criminalising carnism. The animals who were victims of the industry are sent to recovery centres. Coming back to 2067, the Clifton Abbatoir is now a museum to explain the horrific dairy industry of the past. The young and old apologise to each other. The film ends with the support group successfully naming the fish they had once eaten.

This formation took part in the early stages of the winter counteroffensive and made gains in the direction of Vyazma before being cut off behind German lines in February and largely destroyed by May. The division was formed again in June, once again in the Western Front, and proved itself a stolid and reliable unit in the often frustrating battles east and west of Smolensk and into the Baltic states over the next two and a half years. After taking part in the conquest of East Prussia in 1945, the 338th, along with the rest of its 39th Army, was railed all the way to the far east to join in the Soviet invasion of Manchuria in August. 1st Formation The division started forming on September 9, 1941 at Penza in the Volga Military District.Walter S. Dunn, Jr., Stalin's Keys to Victory, Stackpole Books, Mechanicsburg, PA, 2006, p. 79 Col. Vladimir Georgievich Kuchinev was appointed to command on the same day and he would hold that command through the entire 1st Formation and well into the 2nd. Its basic order of battle was as follows: * 1134th Rifle Regiment * 1136th Rifle Regiment * 1138th Rifle Regiment * 910th Artillery RegimentCharles C. Sharp, \\"Red Tide\\", Soviet Rifle Divisions Formed From June to December 1941, Soviet Order of Battle World War II, Vol. IX, Nafziger, 1996, p. 82 After about a month, the division was assigned to 26th Army in the Reserve of the Supreme High Command. When this Army was moved north in November the 338th remained behind as a separate division in the Reserve. In mid-December the division was assessed as combat- ready and was assigned to 33rd Army in the central sector of Western Front. =Battle of Moscow= In its first operation the division was assigned to the Army's shock group for an attack on the Naro-Fominsk - Kamenskoe sector at dawn on December 18. Each division of the shock group had 10 tanks in support. The German front along this sector had been in their hands for two months and was extensively fortified. After an hour-long artillery preparation the 338th's assault managed to liberate the village of Sliznevo on the east bank of the Nara River but got no farther that day or the following due to stubborn enemy resistance. No other units made appreciable gains, and 33rd Army's offensive was shut down on December 20.Soviet General Staff, The Battle of Moscow, ed. & trans. R.W. Harrison, Helion & Co., Ltd., Solihull, UK, 2017, Kindle ed., part IV, ch. 3 After regrouping, the 338th joined in an attack in January, 1942, straight west through the overstretched and depleted German 4th Army through Mozhaisk towards Vyasma. In February this penetration became a trap when a German counter-thrust cut off 33rd Army behind German lines. By April the Army was being slowly ground down in its positions in the woods east of Vyasma, dependent on small-scale air supply; the Army commander, Lt. Gen. Mikhail Grigoryevich Yefremov, took his own life to avoid capture when a breakout attempt failed.Aleksander A. Maslov, Fallen Soviet Generals, ed. & trans. D.M. Glantz, Frank Cass Publishers, London, 1998, pp. 76-77 Over the following months small groups and individuals of the 338th filtered through the German lines to rejoin the Soviet front. On May 24 the division was officially disbanded, and its survivors were incorporated into the 113th Rifle Division of the rebuilding 33rd Army.Sharp, \\"Red Tide\\", p. 82 Colonel Kuchinev was able to escape, with a small command cadre, and soon took command of the division's 2nd formation. 2nd Formation A new 338th Rifle Division began forming on June 4, 1942, in 43rd Army of Western Front, based on the 18th Rifle Brigade. The order of battle remained the same as that of the first formation. =18th Rifle Brigade= This brigade began forming in September, 1941, in the Oryol Military District, but like its \\"sister\\" 17th Brigade had to be evacuated eastwards in October as the German forces approached.For this reason, Dunn lists the brigade forming in October. He also states it was first assigned to 5th Army in December. Dunn, Jr., Stalin's Keys, p. 86 In late November it entered the reserves of Western Front, and arrived at the front in late December, joining the advancing 16th Army west of Moscow. In January, 1942 it was reassigned southwards to 43rd Army, still in Western Front, facing the enemy south of the Moscow - Minsk highway and west of Maloyaroslavets. The brigade remained in this Army until it was disbanded.Sharp, \\"Red Volunteers\\", Soviet Militia Units, Rifle and Ski Brigades 1941 - 1945, Soviet Order of Battle World War II, Vol. XI, Nafziger, 1996, p. 15 =Battles for Smolensk= Two months later the 338th was reassigned to 49th Army, still in Western Front.Sharp, \\"Red Swarm\\", Soviet Rifle Divisions Formed From 1942 to 1945, Soviet Order of Battle World War II, Vol. X, Nafziger, 1996, p. 126 During the German Operation B√ºffel and the Soviet follow-up in the Third Rzhev‚ÄìSychevka Offensive Operation, the division was part of an attacking force of about eight rifle divisions and seven tank brigades from 33rd, 49th and 50th Armies, plus two tank corps, that attempted to break through the new German lines at the base of the former Rzhev salient in the direction of Spas-Demensk.David M. Glantz, After Stalingrad, Helion & Co., Ltd., Solihull, UK, 2009, pp. 333, 336-37 In the course of this attack the 338th returned to 33rd Army for a few weeks; after this attempt failed due to appalling terrain conditions and strong German defenses it was moved back to the 49th. It remained there until September, taking part in the offensive that liberated both Spas-Demensk and, eventually, Smolensk.Sharp, \\"Red Swarm\\", p. 126 In September the division was moved back to 33rd Army and assigned to 70th Rifle Corps. On September 9, after exactly two years in command, Colonel Kuchinev finally passed the reins to Col. Nikolai Olimpievich Guz, who would hold them until mid-March, 1944. On October 3, Western Front began the first of a series of ill-fated offensives in the direction of Orsha. The 338th and its corps-mate, 371st Rifle Division, were deployed on the army's right wing between Lenino and Mikulino facing the German 95th Infantry Division. 33rd Army's attack faced stronger German defenses than its neighboring armies to the north, and by October 9 its assaults expired without any success. Over the following days 33rd and 49th Armies regrouped for a new offensive; the 338th remained in place for several days to conceal and protect the movements behind its lines. The new assault, which included the action known as the Battle of Lenino, began on October 12 but was once again stymied with limited gains and significant casualties, especially among the ranks of the Polish 1st Infantry Division.Glantz, Battle for Belorussia, University Press of Kansas, Lawrence, KS, 2016, pp. 27, 69, 72 By November 14 the division, along with its Corps, had been redeployed to 31st Army, north of the Dniepr River, still on the Orsha axis. After a lengthy artillery preparation on this date, four armies of Western Front made yet another attack to the west. Assault and penal battalions of 10th Guards Army to its north advanced up to 2.5 km despite heavy fog that shrouded the battlefield; the 338th kept pace with an advance of up to 1.5 km, but the remaining divisions of its Army bogged down in the German forward security belt due to heavy machine gun fire. On November 17, 70th Corps, along with 15th Guards Rifle Corps spearheaded by units of 2nd Guards Tank Corps, wedged into the boundary between 78th Assault and 25th Panzer Grenadier Divisions north of the Orsha highway, but this attack also faltered. In five days of intense fighting the two Soviet armies managed to advance a mere 4 ‚Äì 5 km, while the remainder of the Front's forces gained even less.Glantz, Belorussia, pp. 158, 162, 164 In the following months the advance towards Orsha by Western Front was suspended in favor of the encirclement and reduction of Vitebsk. In mid-February, 1944, the Front commander, Army Gen. V.D. Sokolovsky, proposed a preliminary attack by elements of 5th and 31st Armies in the direction of Babinavichy, to draw German forces southwards from Vitebsk. By this time the 338th was in the 45th Rifle Corps of 5th Army. Under this plan the division would be part of a shock group attacking westward south of the Sukhodrovka River to outflank the German strongpoint at Vysochany. The attack, beginning on February 22, once again made very limited gains, in part because 3rd Panzer Army had shortened its lines around Vitebsk to free up reserves. By the end of this offensive, the division was down to a strength of just 3,605 men. In the following months Sokolovsky lost his job, and further attacks were suspended to prepare for a summer offensive.Glantz, Belorussia, pp. 362, 365, 693 Advance On March 31, the divisional command was taken by Col. Hmayak Grigorevich Babayan. He would be promoted to the rank of Major General on July 15, and would remain in command until October 25. In April, Western Front was split, and the 338th became part of 3rd Belorussian Front. In the opening stages of Operation Bagration the division was in a secondary role; it was in the second echelon of 45th Corps, which was itself in second echelon of 5th Army. After a 2-hour and 20 minute artillery preparation and attacks from the air, 5th Army, deployed on a 30 km front, kicked off its assault on the afternoon of June 22. Its immediate objective was to penetrate the German lines and liberate the town of Bogushevsk. The 159th Rifle Division led 45th Corps, with the 184th and 338th following. The German 256th Infantry Division was defending, with elements of the 95th Infantry Division in reserve. On the first day the attackers broke through the immediate German defenses and began charging westward. By noon on the 23rd 5th Army had turned southwards and began crossing the Luchesa River; by midnight it was only 13 km from Bogushevsk. On the morning of June 24 the German VI Army Corps was still holding a line about 10 km east of Bogushevsk, but this was soon broken, with Soviet tanks entering the town at noon with infantry following. 45th Corps reached there early on June 26, continuing to advance towards Senno. By the end of June 27 the 338th was well past there and had reached Cherekhya, not far from Lake Lukomlskoye.Dunn, Jr., Soviet Blitzkrieg, Stackpole Books, Mechanicsburg, PA, 2008, pp. 117-31 In August the division was shifted to the reserves of 3rd Belorussian Front and joined the 113th Rifle Corps. By the middle of the month it had advanced nearly to the city of Jonava in Lithuania.Baltic Gap, Multi-Man Publishing, Inc., Millersville, MD, 2009, p. 15 In September 113th Corps was assigned to 39th Army; the 338th would remain under those commands for the duration of the war.Sharp, \\"Red Swarm\\", p. 126 Progress slowed over the following month as the German front was rebuilt, and when the Riga Offensive began in mid-September the division was just west of Kƒódainiai. In the next two weeks it made little further progress, but began a more successful advance towards Raseiniai in early October.Baltic Gap, pp. 28, 35 In the operational plan for the Vistula-Oder Offensive, the main shock group of 39th Army, gathered on its left flank, was to launch a vigorous attack in the direction of Pilkallen and Tilsit to surround and destroy the German grouping in this area in conjunction with 5th Army. Meanwhile, 113rd Corps, including the 338th, was to attack from behind the right flank of the Army's shock group in the direction of Lazdenen, with the objective of rolling up the German positions to the north. By January 17 the offensive was developing well, and three German infantry divisions were trying to escape a developing pocket in the Lazdenen area; 113rd Corps was ordered to speed up its attack by conducting night operations in the direction of Gross Skeisgirren. By this time it was clear that 39th Army had made the decisive advance into East Prussia and the front commander, Gen. Ivan Chernyakhovsky, ordered his armor reserves and 11th Guards Army to exploit the breach. By January 22 the advance had become a pursuit; 113rd Corps was advancing behind 94th Rifle Corps and had reached Popelken. On the 27th the 39th Army was straining to surround K√∂nigsberg from the north as quickly as possible, and the division was part of a force ordered to reach the shore of the Frisches Haff.Soviet General Staff, Prelude to Berlin, ed. & trans. R.W. Harrison, Helion & Co., Ltd., Solihull, UK, 2016, pp. 123, 195-97, 224, 230 From February until April the division was part of the Soviet force occupying positions on the Sambia Peninsula. When the final assault on K√∂nigsberg began on April 6 the 338th, along with its Corps, was deployed in two echelons immediately northwest of the city. Its attacks over the next three days were hindered by counterattacks by the German Samland Group attempting to maintain contact with the city. After the fall of K√∂nigsberg on the 9th, 3rd Belorussian Front was tasked with the destruction of the Samland Group, which began on April 13 and was completed on the 25th.Prelude to Berlin, pp. 254, 267-69 In late April the entire 39th Army went into the Reserve of the Supreme High Command, and was moved by rail to the far east. By July the division was part of the Transbaikal Front.Sharp, \\"Red Swarm\\", p. 126 Postwar On July 4, the division came under the command of Maj. Gen. Leonid Nikolaevich Lozanovich, and he would remain in command until after the end of the Manchurian campaign.

The newspapers was established in October 1907 by Antanas Smetona and Juozas Tumas-Vai≈ægantas. It promoted unity among Lithuanians attempting to bring together conservative Catholic clergy and more liberal intelligentsia. The newspaper concentrated on cultural matters as opposed to politics or news reports. It was supported by the clergy, but it was not a religious newspaper. Eventually, the clergy grew dissatisfied with the secular and moderate tone and Smetona left in 1913 to establish a separate newspaper Vairas. The intellectuals around Viltis became known as viltininkai and formed an early embryo of the Lithuanian Nationalist Union, the ruling party in Lithuania in 1926‚Äì1940. Viltis was discontinued due to World War I. It was briefly resurrected in the early 1990s by the Lithuanian Nationalist Union. Viltis in 1907‚Äì1915 =History= Juozas Tumas-Vai≈ægantas (right) transfers Viltis to its new editor Fabijonas Kemƒó≈°is (left) The newspapers was established in October 1907 and published three time a week. It filed the void of Lithuanian-language newspapers in Vilnius as Vilniaus ≈æinios was discontinued due to financial difficulties in March 1907. Antanas Smetona, an intellectual who previously edited Vilniaus ≈æinios, and Juozas Tumas- Vai≈ægantas, a priest who previously edited Tƒóvynƒós sargas, formed a partnership in hopes of uniting Lithuanians. They hoped to bring together the conservative clergy and the more liberal intelligentsia (known as pirmeiviai) to combat Polonization, particularly in the mixed Vilnius Region. Smetona was the responsible editor setting newspaper's ideology while Tumas-Vai≈ægantas handled the business and the finances. They established a trust company, supported initially by 179 subscribers ‚Äì mostly members of the clergy ‚Äì who contributed 100 rubles each, to finance the operations. It was the first Lithuanian newspaper set up this way. In November 1910, Tumas-Vai≈ægantas published an article listing known churches were Lithuanian-language services were removed by orders of , administrator of the Diocese of Vilnius while Bishop Eduard von der Ropp was in exile. This caused much controversy and Bishop assigned Tumas-Vai≈ægantas to Lai≈æuva in northern Lithuania. Effectively, it was an exile and also meant his departure from Viltis. His place was taken by other priests, Fabijonas Kemƒó≈°is and later Juozas Dabu≈æis. Various Lithuanian groups sent letters protesting the removal of Tumas- Vai≈ægantas to Viltis for three months. In light of other Catholic publications, such as ≈†altinis and Vienybƒó, Viltis seemed too secular and the clergy grew dissatisfied. The pressure only increased when Viltis announced its plans to become a daily. During the September 1913 shareholders' meeting, the clergy insisted that Pranas Dovydaitis, member of the Catholic Ateitis federation, would become Smetona's deputy. Unexpectedly, Smetona interpreted it as a vote of no confidence in him and resigned. Dovydaitis took over the newspaper, which switched to daily publication on 1 January 1914 at an annual cost of 25,000 rubles. Smetona, with financial support from Martynas Yƒças, went on to establish another newspaper, Vairas, where he continued to advocate the middle road between the clergy and the intelligentsia. The episode illustrated continued splintering of Lithuanian cultural movement. =Content= Initially, Viltis was published three times a week. Its primary goal and hope was national unity among Lithuanians. The newspaper promoted Lithuanian national identity above political differences and considered itself a non-party newspaper. Viltis liked to emphasize that it was the middle road, though its political views were right-wing. Despite attempts at reconciliation, Viltis received criticism from both sides. The clergy criticized the newspaper for not sufficiently promoting Catholic ideas. For example, they attacked articles that positively evaluated Vyd≈´nas' thoughts on the theory of evolution, theosophy, and pantheism. Intelligentsia, on the other hand, thought that the newspaper was too religious. For example, Kazys Grinius wrote that Viltis and nationalistic consideration were only a tool used by the clergy to defend their privileged status in the society. Viltis published little of news reports, but paid particular attention to the Lithuanian language and folk culture as well as issues in art, science, education, and morals. Viltis understood that increasing peasants' material wealth was instrumental in achieving cultural goals and, therefore, advocated mutual aid societies, credit unions, and trade while opposing emigration (mostly to the United States), but provided little in terms of practical advice or guidance. It defended the Catholic Church against attacks by the socialists, but it was not a religious newspaper. Unlike the more active socialist revolutionaries, the newspaper took a moderate stand on the Tsarist regime: Lithuanian movement was weak and it would be foolish to fight the regime. At the same time, it criticized Lithuanian involvement in Russian politics urging them to concentrate on Lithuanian issues. Linguistic matters were discussed by Antanas Smetona, Jonas Jablonskis, Juozas Balƒçikonis, Jurgis ≈†lapelis, music by Mikalojus Konstantinas ƒåiurlionis, theater by Gabrielius Landsbergis-≈Ωemkalnis, general cultural topics by Jonas Basanaviƒçius, Tadeusz Dowgird, Adomas Dambrauskas, Augustinas Voldemaras, literature by Juozas Tumas-Vai≈ægantas, ≈†atrijos Ragana, Sofija Kymantaitƒó-ƒåiurlionienƒó. Viltis also published many works of fiction. The literary section was edited by Liudas Gira and included short stories by Lazdyn≈≥ Pelƒóda, dramas and legends by Vincas Krƒóvƒó-Mickeviƒçius, first short stories of Ignas ≈†einius, feuilletons by Juozas Balƒçikonis. Viltis in 1991‚Äì1994 After the declaration of independence, the newspaper was reestablished by the Lithuanian Nationalist Union in 1991. Initially, it was published weekly and had circulation of 12,000 copies. It was edited by Rimantas Smetona (nephew of Antanas Smetona) and Balys Sriubas. Later, the publishing frequency was reduced to twice a month. In 1994, when circulation dropped to 2,000 copies, the newspaper was discontinued.

It was the first overseas tour by a representative Australian team. The Australians played seven matches against provincial teams, six of which fielded 22 players (the other team, Canterbury, fielded 15) with the aim of providing more evenly-matched contests. As the matches were not 11-a-side they are not considered to have been first-class. The team had assembled in November 1877, playing matches against teams in four Australian colonies. The team *Dave Gregory (captain) *Frank Allan *George Bailey *Alec Bannerman *Charles Bannerman *Jack Blackham *Harry Boyle *Tom Garrett *Tom Horan *Tom Kendall *Billy Murdoch *Fred Spofforth John Conway was the manager and umpire. W. Gibbes, a clerk in the New South Wales audit department, was the assistant manager. Frank Allan pulled out of the trip shortly before the team left Australia, suffering from sciatica, leaving the Australians with just 11 players. Gibbes played in the match against Wellington, relieving Boyle. The matches * Southland v Australians, the cricket ground, Invercargill, 9, 10 January 1878. Southland XXII 89 and 39; Australians 267. Australians won by an innings and 139 runs. (Most newspapers referred to the local team as \\"Invercargill\\", not \\"Southland\\".) Spofforth took 14 for 25 in the first innings; 11 of his victims were bowled. Charles Bannerman opened Australia's innings and scored 125 not out, which was the Australians' only century of the tour. One of his hits over square leg landed in an orchard 50 metres from the ground. Horan made 53. In the first innings the Southland number 10, John Wesney, made 39 not out, and during a 21st- wicket partnership of 27 struck a ball from Spofforth over the fence. The Australians' ship berthed at Bluff early on the morning of the match, they arrived by train at Invercargill at 10 o'clock, and the match began at noon. The match days were declared half-holidays in Invercargill, and special concerts were held each evening at the Theatre Royal. * Otago v Australians, Caledonian Ground, Dunedin, 12, 14, 15 January 1878. Otago XXII 124 and 93; Australians 92. Drawn. (Rain prevented play on the third day.) Garrett took 7 for 25 and 13 for 33. The highest score in the match was 28 by the Otago batsman Hugh MacNeil. * Oamaru v Australians, Northern Ground, Oamaru, 17 January 1878. Oamaru XXII 70 and 10 for 43; Australians 113. Drawn. (Some sources regard this match as a victory to the Australians, as they led on the first innings in a one-day match.)\\"Argus\\", The Australian Cricketers' Tour through Australia, New Zealand and Great Britain, Jarrett & Co., Sydney, 1878, p. 6. Charles Bannerman made 45, the only score on either side higher than 18. A public holiday was declared in the town for the match. Tom Horan later wrote that the ground resembled a \\"worn-out potato paddock on which the lovers of the noble game endeavour to play to the detriment of their legs, body and head\\". * Canterbury v Australians, Hagley Oval, Christchurch, 19, 21, 22, 23, 24 January 1878. Australians 46 and 143; Canterbury XV 135 and 57 for 8. Canterbury won by six wickets. (Rain prevented play on the second and third days.) Canterbury asked to play on even terms, with 11 players a side, but the Australians refused, hoping to prolong the game and thus increase the gate takings.The Oxford Companion to Australian Cricket, Oxford, Melbourne, 1996, p. 383. Eventually it was settled that Canterbury would field 15 players, but before the match the reporter in the Christchurch newspaper The Lyttelton Times regretted the decision not to field 18. Without exceptional luck, he said, \\"I am afraid we shall have to put up with defeat\\". Interest in the match was high, and the largest Christchurch businesses and law firms closed on each day of the match at midday, which was the scheduled time for play to begin. The sides agreed to play on a different pitch for each innings, and the Australians got the worse of the arrangement of the first day, when the bowling of the brothers Charlie and William Frith was \\"almost unplayable\\" on a \\"springy\\" pitch, and despite dropping several catches Canterbury dismissed the Australians for 46. When Australia batted, Spofforth bowled at his fastest, taking 9 for 77, all his victims being bowled, several by yorkers, but Arthur Ollivier (36) and the captain, William Neilson (26), defied the bowling and took the score to 105 for 10 at stumps. After rain washed out the second and third days, a crowd of 8000 turned up to watch the fourth day's play. Tom Horan scored 58 not out, but the rest of the Australian batsmen were troubled by Edwin Fuller, who took 8 for 35, finishing the innings off on the fifth day. Canterbury needed 55 to win, and completed their victory after eight wickets had fallen. In all 20,000 spectators watched the match, but as the field was in a public park no admission fee could be charged, and the Australians' takings were disappointing. The result caused some surprise in Australia, where the newspapers mixed their tributes to the good play of the Canterbury side with doubts about the pitch, the tour schedule and the New Zealand umpiring. This match was the only one the 1877-78 Australians lost. It was not until the 1966-67 season that a team representing Australia suffered a first-class defeat in New Zealand ‚Äì also at the hands of Canterbury.Wisden 1968, p. 879. * Wellington v Australians, Basin Reserve, Wellington, 26, 28, 29 January 1878. Wellington XXII 91 and 84; Australians 166 and 1 for 10. Australians won by nine wickets. Spofforth took 14 for 40 in the first innings, 11 of them bowled. George Bailey's 33 not out was the highest score in the match. In Wellington all government offices and banks and most businesses were closed on the two afternoons (Monday and Tuesday) of the match. * Hawke's Bay v Australians, Nelson Cricket Ground, Hastings, 1, 2 February 1878. Hawke's Bay XXII 49 and 69; Australians 151. Australians won by an innings and 33 runs. Spofforth took 11 for 33 and 11 for 26; 16 of his victims were bowled. Tom Garrett's 52 was by far the highest score. J. Liddle took 5 for 51 for Hawke's Bay. The first day of the match, a Friday, was declared a public holiday in Napier for the occasion. The Australians arrived in Napier on the Wanaka from Wellington on the morning of the match, then travelled by train to Hastings. The match started at two o'clock, \\"in Mr Braithwaite's paddock at Hastings, about a mile from the railway station\\". Rather than toss a coin to decide who would bat first, the Australians asked to be allowed to field, in order to work off the effects of their journey. * Auckland v Australians, Auckland Domain, Auckland, 7, 8, 9 February 1878. Auckland XXII 85 and 62; Australians 175. Australians won by an innings and 28 runs. Spofforth took 13 for 42 and 9 for 26; Garrett took 11 for 11 in the second innings. For Auckland Dan Lynch took the first five Australian wickets and finished with 5 for 67. Bailey's 44 not out was the highest score. The original itinerary included a three-day match against the \\"United strength of New Zealand\\" from 14 to 16 February. Assessments The weather was generally cool, cloudy and damp throughout, although only three full days were lost to the weather. Bowlers had the upper hand. Apart from Charles Bannerman's century against Southland, Horan scored two fifties and Garrett one. All 22 of the opposition fielded at once, which slowed the Australians' scoring. Charles Bannerman led the Australian batting with 284 runs, Horan scored 187, and Bailey 128. Only four New Zealand batsmen, all in South Island teams, reached 20; John Wesney of Southland was the highest scorer among them with 39 not out. Spofforth took 102 wickets at an average of 3.85, although in several matches he bowled only in the first innings. The Australians returned to Australia and played several matches in New South Wales and Victoria in March before sailing for England.

He was an early settler of Richford, New York and his personal characteristics and hard life have led him to be called \\"a most unlikely progenitor of the clan\\".Chernow 2007, p3 His son William Rockefeller Sr. was the father of oil baron John D. Rockefeller. Early life and marriage Godfrey Rockefeller was born September 24, 1783, in Albany, New York. His parents were William and Christina Rockefeller. William and Christina were third cousins; William's grandfather was Johann Peter Rockefeller II, a miller who migrated from Rhineland, Germany, to Philadelphia where he was a plantation owner and landholder in Somerville, and Amwell, New Jersey. Christina's grandfather was Johann Peter's cousin, Diell Rockefeller, who immigrated to Germantown. In 1806, Godfrey married former schoolteacher, Lucy Avery (February 11, 1786 ‚Äì April 6, 1867), in Great Barrington, Massachusetts, against opposition from her parents. Lucy's Avery ancestors were Puritans who had emigrated from Devon, England, to Salem, Massachusetts, in about 1630.Chernow 2007, p3-4 Godfrey was said to be outmatched by his wife, who was taller, more confident, and better educated than Godfrey. Godfrey himself was said to have a \\"stunted, impoverished look and a hangdog air of perpetual defeat\\". He was also said to be jovial and good-natured, but his propensity to drink upset his wife. The pair would have ten children.Chernow 2007, p4 Career Godfrey and Lucy first lived in Great Barrington, where Godfrey became sheriff,Flynn 1933, p13 and worked as a farmer and businessman with little success. He and his young family moved from Great Barrington to Granger, New York, and then to Ancram, New York, and then to Livingston, New York. Between 1832 and 1834, the family moved by Conestoga wagon west. Various reasons for this move have been given. One account is that Godfrey and several neighbors lost their land in a title dispute. Another is that Godfrey traded his farm for a farm in Tioga County, a trade which Godfrey would have been ill-advised to make as the farm at his final destination had thin acidic soil that was poor for farming. Another is that the family intended to move to Michigan, but Lucy preferred the New England culture of upstate New York. Whatever the reason, they spent two weeks along the Albany- Catskill turnpike with nine of their ten children (all excepting William) travelling to their new home, a sparsely populated wilderness near Richford, New York. A family legend is that from the top of the hill on his new, 60-acre property, Godfrey said that \\"This is as close as we shall ever get to Michigan\\", and therefore named the spot, Michigan Hill.Chernow 2007, p4-5 At Michigan Hill, Lucy built a stone fence with two field-hands, and the family worked a farm. Their son, William, arrived in Richford in about 1835.Chernow 2007, p6 Death and family Godfrey Lewis Rockefeller died on September 28, 1857, and Lucy died April 6, 1867, both in Richford, New York.Nevins 1940, p31 Godfrey and Lucy had 10 children: *Melinda Rockefeller (September 12, 1807Sweet 1894, p604-605 ‚Äì May 2, 1880), married to William Harris *Olymphia Rockefeller (April 20, 1809 ‚Äì July 21, 1893), *William Avery \\"Bill\\" Rockefeller Sr. (November 13, 1810 ‚Äì May 11, 1906).

Attestations  Some Muslim scholars, including al- Azraqi, claimed that 'Amr ibn Luhayy, the patriarch of the Arab tribe Banu Khuza'a, who introduced idolatry in Mecca, was responsible for the worship of IsƒÅf and NƒÅ'ila. He had called on people to worship them and justified the fact that their ancestors had already done so. The Qurayshi Qusaiy ibn KilƒÅb had then taken the two stones to the well of Zamzam near the Kaaba.al-Azraqi, AkhbƒÅr Makka, pg. 49 IsƒÅf and NƒÅ'ila were said to be particularly important to the Quraysh tribe, associated with Qurayshi sacrifices involving a talbiya specifically directed to IsƒÅf. Various legends existed about the idols, including one that they were petrified after they committed adultery in the Kaaba. Ibn al-Kalbi handed down the legend in his Book of Idols as follows: > They set out to perform the pilgrimage. Upon their arrival in Mecca they > entered the Ka'bah. Taking advantage of the absence of anyone else and of > the privacy of the Sacred House, Isaf committed adultery with her in the > sanctuary. Thereupon they were transformed into stone, becoming two > miskhs.Ibn al-Kalbi, Book of Idols, pg. 34 According to the traditions of the Meccan local historian al-Azraqƒ´, the incident happened at the time when the Arab tribe of the Jurhum ruled over Mecca. The two stones were then removed from the Kaaba and placed on the Al- Safa and Al-Marwah hills, so that the people would be warned. Over the course of time, they were then venerated as idols. After the Muslim capture of the city in January 630, the two stone idols were destroyed.al-Azraqi, Akhbar Makka, pg. 50  Interpretations  Aziz al-Azmeh believes that IsƒÅf and NƒÅ'ila were probably the original deities of the Quraysh, brought by them from their erstwhile territories to Mecca and worshipped continually along the regnant deities of Mecca, including al-'Uzza.

New York, 413 U.S. 483 (1973), was a United States Supreme Court decision which upheld that states could make laws limiting the distribution of obscene material, provided that these laws were consistent with the Miller test for obscene material established by the Supreme Court in Miller v. California, 413 U.S. 15 (1973).Miller v. California. The Oyez Project at IIT Chicago-Kent College of Law. 28 February 2017. Heller was initially convicted for showing a sexually explicit film in the movie theater which he owned, under New York Penal Law ¬ß 235.0 which stated that and individual ‚Äúis guilty of obscenity when, knowing its content and character, he 1. Promotes, or possesses with intent to promote, any obscene material; or 2. Produces, presents or directs an obscene performance or participates in a portion thereof which is obscene or which contributes to its obscenity.\\". Heller appealed this ruling to the supreme court, claiming that his first amendment rights had been violated due to the broad nature of New York's obscenity laws. The defendant also claimed that his 14th amendment rights had been violated due to the fact the film was seized prior to him receiving a hearing of any kind. The Supreme Court ruled in favor of Heller in a 5-4 decision, with the majority decision delivered by Justice Burger.Heller v. New York. The Oyez Project at IIT Chicago-Kent College of Law. 28 February 2017. The Court found the procedure by which the film was seized to be constitutional, but ruled in favor of Heller in order to afford New York a chance to bring their obscenity laws in line with the guidelines established by the Supreme Court in Miller v. California. The Dissenting opinions were written by Justice Douglas as well as Justice Brennan, the latter of which was joined by Justice Stewart and Justice Marshall. These dissenting opinions argued that the obscenity laws that Heller was convicted under were themselves unconstitutional and thus the seizure of the film was unconstitutional. This case was one of several cases that the Burger court ruled on concerning obscenity laws in the early 1970s. Background Heller was the manager of the New Andy Warhol Garrick movie theater in Greenwich Village, New York city. On July 29, 1969, the Andy Warhol film Blue Movie was displayed, a film which depicts a couple engaged in sexually explicit acts and discussing various subjects ranging from athletes foot the Vietnam War. Three police officers saw part of this screening of the film and based on their observations an assistant district attorney requested that a judge of the New York criminal court see the film. On July 31, 1969 a judge accompanied by a police inspector saw the film and deemed that the film was ‚Äúobscene as I saw it then under the definition of obscene, that is [in] . . . section 235.00 of the Penal Law.\\".\\"Heller v. New York.\\" Findlaw. N.p., n.d. Web. 28 Feb. 2017. The judge thus issued John Doe warrants for the arrest of the not only the theater manager, but also the projectionist and ticket tacker. The judge and police inspector both stated that they did not recall seeing any signs that limited admission to film to only adults. The theater manager as well as the ticket taker and projectionists were arrested and the film seized. There was no pretrial claim that the copy of the film seized as evidence was the only copy. The case came to trial in the New York City Criminal Court on September 16, 1969, before 3 judges. Heller provided several ‚Äúexperts‚Äù to testify that the film ‚Äúhad social, literary, and artistic importance‚Äù and also testified that in addition to signs restricting the admittance of anyone under 17 the staff had been instructed to not allow in those under 18.\\"Heller v. New York 413 U.S. 483 (1973).\\" Justia Law. N.p., n.d. Web. 28 Feb. 2017. Heller argued that the seizure of the film violated his 14th amendment right and that the New York state obscenity laws under which the film was seized violated the first amendment because they were vague and more broad than necessary. Heller also argued that films shown exclusively to consenting adults in private are free speech protected by the constitution. The defendant was found guilty by the New York City Criminal Court, a decision that was upheld on appeal by both the Supreme Court of the State of New York and the New York Court of Appeals.\\"Heller v. New York 413 U.S. 483 (1973).\\" Justia Law. N.p., n.d. Web. 28 Feb. 2017. The Court of appeals cited the Supreme Court's ruling in Lee Art Theatre v. Virginia its decision, which stated that a judge could not issue a warrant for the seizure of a film based only the word of an officer.\\"Lee Art Theatre v. Virginia.\\" Findlaw. N.p., n.d. Web. 28 Feb. 2017. . The Court of appeals felt that because the judge had in fact gone to see the film himself he had sufficient grounds to constitutionally issue a warrant for seizure of the film even without a formal hearing. Majority Opinion The Majority opinion was delivered by Justice Berger and joined by justices White, Powell, Blackmun and Rehnquist. It held that the procedure by which the film was seized and the seizing of the film were constitutional and violated neither the first or fourteenth amendment. Burger held that Heller's assertion that films show only to consenting adults in private was protected was incorrect as the court ruled Paris Adult Theatre I v. Slaton 413 U.S. 49 (1973). that the privacy granted in the home does not necessarily extend to the theatre and that even consenting adults can be subject to governmental restrictions for the ‚Äúlegitimate state interests at stake in stemming the tide of commercialized obscenity\\".\\"Paris Adult Theatre I v. Slaton.\\" Oyez, https://www.oyez.org/cases/1972/71-1051. Accessed 27 Feb. 2017. Furthermore, the New York Court of Appeals applied correctly the precedent set in Lee Art Theatre v. Virginia, which ruled that as long as the judge's procedure prior to issuing the warrant was \\"designed to focus searchingly on the question of obscenity‚Äù, the judge did not have to even see the film himself.\\"Lee Art Theatre v. Virginia.\\" Findlaw. N.p., n.d. Web. 28 Feb. 2017. . By doing so the Judge had made every effort to determine the question of obscenity for himself. Also the protection of seizure set forth in Quantity of Books v. Kansas 378 U.S. 205 (1964), only applied to obscene materials being seized for the expressed purpose of being destroyed.\\"A Quantity of Books Et Al. v. Kansas.\\" Supreme Court of the United States, n.d. Web. 28 Feb. 2017. . As long as there was another copy of the film was available, the seizure for the purpose of evidence was okay, and if there was no other copy as long as the defendant could be allowed to make another pending a judicial decision it would still be constitutional. Since the record failed to show there were no other copies and there was no pretrial motion to make more copies the State was allowed to seize the film. However, the case was remanded in order to afford the New York Court of Appeals to make changes to the underlying definition of obscenity according to the guidelines laid out by the court in the recently decided Miller v. California. Dissenting Opinion There were 2 dissenting opinions in this case. Justice Douglas dissented on the grounds that he would have preferred to outright reverse the decision as he felt as though the underlying obscenity law for which Heller was charged was unconstitutional and violated the first amendment. Justice Douglas referenced his dissenting opinion in United States v. 12 200-ft. Reels of Film, in which he stated that ‚ÄúI know of no constitutional way by which a book, tract, paper, postcard, or film may be made contraband because of its contents‚Äù,‚ÄúI know of no constitutional way by which a book, tract, paper, postcard, or film may be made contraband because of its contents‚Äù as well as his dissenting opinion in Miller v. California in which he argued that the court should not try to define obscenity by itself as there are no constitutional guidelines for what should be considered obscene.\\"Miller v. California.\\" LII / Legal Information Institute. N.p., n.d. Web. 26 Mar. 2017. . Justice Brennan dissented as well, joined by justices Stewart and Marshall, arguing that the obscenity law was too broad to be considered constitutional and thus there could be no grounds to seize the film. Justice Brennan also referenced his dissent in Paris Adult Theatre I v. Slaton in which he stated that the difficulty in precisely defining material as obscene is what makes it impossible to outright ban obscenity.\\"Paris Adult Theatre I v. Slaton.\\" LII / Legal Information Institute. N.p., n.d. Web. 26 Mar. 2017. . Subsequent Developments During the time period between when the court agreed to hear Heller v. New York they ruled on Miller v. California, a ruling which established that states could make obscenity laws, provided they follow the guidelines of the Miller test. The Miller test contained 3 parts and became the standard for determining whether material was obscene. The 3 parts were: Whether \\"the average person, applying contemporary community standards\\", would find that the work, taken as a whole, appeals to the prurient interest, Whether the work depicts or describes, in a patently offensive way, sexual conduct or excretory functions specifically defined by applicable state law, Whether the work, taken as a whole, lacks serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value.\\"Miller v. California.\\" Oyez, https://www.oyez.org/cases/1971/70-73. Accessed 28 Feb. 2017. The Court also asked for the New York Court of Appeals to make sure that their definition of obscenity was concurrent with standard set in Miller v. California. The New York Court of Appeals later confirmed in a 5-4 decision that New York Penal Law ¬ß 235.0 was constitutional as it was already written, even after considering the new obsceneity definition put forth in Miller v. California.Meyer, Bernard S., Burton C. Agata, and Seth H. Agata. \\"The History of the New York Court of Appeals.\\" Google Books. Columbia University Press, n.d. Web. 28 Feb. 2017. . Heller set the precedent that a judge who had seen a movie considered to be obscene could issue a warrant for its seizure without having to hold a hearing on whether or not the content was truly obscene, as long as there were other copies of the film were available, and in the case that no other copies existed, as long as the defendant was allowed to make copies prior to a formal hearing.Special To the New York Times. \\"Supreme Court's Actions.\\" The New York Times. The New York Times, 16 May 1972. Web. 26 Mar. 2017. This was an expansion on the precedent set in Lee Art Theatre v. Virginia that a judge must determine probable cause of something being obscene, by more explicitly saying that a judge having seen a film himself was sufficient grounds for the judge issuing a warrant to seize a film based on obscenity charges. This precedent was cited in New York v. P. J. Video, Inc., 475 U.S. 868 (1986), another obscenity case in which films were seized on charges of being obscene. In this case the owners of a video store tried to claim that there was a higher standard for determining probable cause in obscenity cases than an investigator simply watching the film. The supreme court ruled against PJ Video, citing there decision in Heller v. New York that an official watching the film themselves was sufficient probable cause for the seizure of a film.\\"New York v. P. J. Video, Inc. 475 U.S. 868 (1986).\\" Justia Law. N.p., n.d. Web. 29 Mar. 2017. . This case is an interesting example of one section of free speech where American courts and European courts agree to an extent, as shown in the landmark case Handyside v United Kingdom (5493/72), where the seizure of materials deemed to be obscene was by the government was found to be permissible by the European Court of Human Rights, much like it was in this case and in New York v. Heller and New York v. P.j. Video. In Handyside v United Kingdom, Handyside had books seized for being obscene, not completely unlike Heller's film which was seized, although some key differences appear in the 2 cases, such as the intended audiences of each. However, the fact remains that in both these cases the government was able to seize material due to it being obscene, while both attempting to prevent, to an extent, the over labeling of materials as obscene.\\"Handyside v. the United Kingdom.\\" Handyside v. the United Kingdom ¬∑ Article 19.

The police raided the school on 16 October 1967. They seized more than 3,500 inflammatory posters. On 27 November 1967 two explosions were reported at the school, and a student was seriously injured in the school laboratory. Area residents and police alleged that the school was being used as a bomb factory. The injured student, 18-year-old Siu Wai-man, lost part of his left hand. He was charged with possession of explosive substances and sentenced to four years in prison. The day after the explosions, four other Communist schools were raided by police for suspected bomb-making, namely the Heung To Middle School, Hon Wah Middle School, Fukien Middle School, and the Mongkok Workers' Children School. The school was immediately closed by the government following the explosions. In mid-1968 the government de-registered the school under the Education Ordinance on the grounds that it had been \\"willfully used for the unlawful manufacture and storage of dangerous explosive substances\\". In late 1968 it was reported in the South China Morning Post that all former students of Chung Wah Middle School had transferred to Hon Wah Middle School.
