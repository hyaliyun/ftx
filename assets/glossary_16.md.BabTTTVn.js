Its wide opening makes a favorite for listening to resonant ocean sounds. These seashells range between 1-3/4\\" to 2-1/4\\" long. Distribution The Rapana bulbosa is found on the ocean floor in the Indian and western Pacific Oceans, across the waters of Micronesia and Polynesia, the Coral Sea and around the Philippines. Along the Australian Coast it is found from Northern New South Wales to northern Western Australia, and along the east coast of Africa including Madagascar. Found between depths of 10 and 40 metres (35-130 ft), it is often associated with live coral colonies, such as the table-forming Acropora, either found on the reefs themselves or the sandy sea bottom nearby. Once common, it is now much less abundant due to shell collecting and the destruction of its habitat by such processes as dynamite fishing, especially in shallower areas. Carnivorous, the adult Rapana bulbosa eats coral and various invertebrates, while juveniles eat algae.

He was born at Litomy≈°l in Bohemia, now in the Czech Republic, where the Jilek surname can be traced back to the 15th century.For genealogical information, please see this Czech web-page. He studied medicine at Vienna and after qualifying as a doctor he joined the Austrian Imperial-Royal Navy on 23 October 1845.The main source of biographical information for this entry was a long footnote in: H. Flamm, ‚ÄòAufkl√§rung des Pappataci-Fiebers durch √∂sterreichische Milit√§r√§rzte‚Äô, Wiener klinische Wochenschrift, 2008, 120(7‚Äì8), 198‚Äì208, which appears to be based on primary or good secondary sources and can be accessed by subscribers on this web page. Other sources not referenced below included the annual Austrian Navy List and some of the extensive literature about the Archduke Ferdinand Maximilian. Naval career Nothing is known about Jilek‚Äôs early years in the navy. He first came to prominence when he was chosen to fill the post of personal physician to the Archduke Ferdinand Maximilian (1832‚Äì1867). The occasion may have been Maximilian‚Äôs entry into the navy and service aboard in 1851. In October 1852, Jilek was appointed senior doctor at the newly designated Naval Academy (former Cadet College) at Pola in Istria, now part of Croatia, where he also lectured on oceanography. In March 1856 the Archduke Maximilian, by then Commander in Chief of the Navy, laid the foundation stones for a new Arsenal and a new Academy building, and in July 1857 Jilek completed the textbook on oceanography for Academy students for which he is best known today.August Jilek, Lehrbuch der Oceanographie zum Gebrauche der k. k. Marine-Akademie, Vienna: Imperial-Royal Court and Government Printer, 1857, 298 pp.Title page of Jilek's Textbook of Oceanography (1857). Jilek was not an original scientist in this field. He was probably commissioned by the Archduke to prepare a survey of the newly emerging science and that is what, within his limitations, he achieved. Much of the book is given over to general geographical descriptions of the world‚Äôs oceans, for which Jilek may have drawn on versions of Kant‚Äôs unpublished lectures on geography that were produced in the early 19th century. Another source was certainly Eduard Bobrik‚Äôs multi-volume manual of seamanship, navigation and oceanography ‚Äì the first book to use that word in its title. In 1848 the second, revised edition of Bobrik‚Äôs manual had included sections on oceanography, hydrography, ‚Äòaerography‚Äô and magnetism.Eduard Bobrik, Handbuch der praktischen Seefahrtskunde, pt 1, Allgemeine Vorbereitungen zur Steuermanns- und Schifferkunde, oder mathematische und physische Geographie; physische und topische Ozeanographie; Aerographie; Lehre vom Magnetismus; Arithmetik; Elementar-Geometrie und ebene Trigonometrie, Leipzig: Verlagsbureau, 1848. But time and again when Jilek addressed the major physical processes which govern the oceans, the true subject of oceanography, he was obliged to declare that no one yet understood them. However he made a reasonable job of explaining the methods and preliminary results that had recently been presented by Matthew Fontaine Maury in his Wind and Current Charts, and had then been enlarged upon in Maury‚Äôs masterpiece The Physical Geography of the Sea, first translated into German in 1856.Matthew F. Maury, trans. C. Boettger, Die physische Geographie des Meeres, Leipzig: Gustav Mayer, 1856, 268 pp. Textbook on oceanography Evidence for the diffusion of Maury‚Äôs ideas in the Austrian Navy after this point can be found in the narrative of the Novara‚Äôs circumnavigation (1857‚Äì1859),Karl Scherzer, Narrative of the circumnavigation of the globe by the Austrian frigate Novara, (Commodore B. von Wullerstorf- Urbair,) undertaken by order of the Imperial Government, in the years 1857,1858, & 1859, 3 vols, London: Saunders, Otley and Co., 1861‚Äì1863. and in a more lucid exposition of them which was published at Pola in 1867.A. Gareis and A. Becker, Zur Physiographie des Meeres, Trieste: H. F. Schimpff, 1867, 135 pp. Notwithstanding the latter, Jilek‚Äôs textbook probably remained in use at the Academy for about twenty years. Jilek‚Äôs unassuming guide was only the second German book, and perhaps the second in the world, to have the word ‚Äòoceanography‚Äô in its title. It is now extremely rare. None of the great national libraries of Europe or North America seems to have a copy, not even the Austrian National Library. Examples can be consulted at Barcelona, Chicago, Frankfurt and Kiel, and presumably several naval training colleges, maritime museums and institutes of oceanography also have copies. The one shown on this page formerly belonged to Lieutenant Ludwig von Czirer, a Hungarian who joined the Imperial-Royal Navy as a cadet in 1872. On 4 October 1863 Jilek was transferred to administrative duties in the Ministry (later Department) of the navy, where he became director of the medical branch (1871) and rose to the rank of admiral (1 November 1888) before retiring in March 1894. Contributions to naval medicine Jilek‚Äôs achievements in naval medicine included the publication of two studies of malaria, a disease which was endemic to Istria,August Jilek, √úber die Ursachen der Malaria in Pola, Vienna, 1868; August Jilek, √úber das Verhalten des Malariafiebers in Pola, Vienna, 1881. and in 1868 he wrote a report on gastroenteritis which may have been an internal Navy Department document. He oversaw the introduction of Listerian antisepsis and the professionalization of the service, that is, the replacement of the earlier ship‚Äôs surgeons, often little more than medical orderlies, with fully qualified doctors. Jilek‚Äôs regular duties were partly or completely interrupted when he accompanied the Archduke on board SMS Novara for a botanical cruise to Brazil in 1860, then joined his household at the palace of Miramare outside Trieste, 130 km from Pola, and finally when he escorted his patron, now Emperor Maximilian I, to Mexico in 1864. Maximilian appointed two subsequent personal physicians during his brief reign in Mexico. Since Jilek had not left the service of Austria it is reasonable to assume that he returned directly from Vera Cruz with the Novara. August married Cattarina von Reya Castelletto, but it is unknown if they had had children.Rudolf Otto, 93 Generationen - von der Gegenwart bis zu den alten Griechen .

Appleton & Company in 1900. The name was changed to Universal Cyclopaedia and Atlas in 1902, with editor . History This was the culmination of a series of encyclopedic projects that began in 1875-78 with the publication of Johnsons New Universal Cyclopedia in four volumes by A. J. Johnson and Sons. A revised version was printed in 8 volumes in 1884, though \\"no revisions of note had been implemented. The original Editors in Chief were Frederick Augustus Porter Barnard and Arnold Henry GuyotS. Padraig Walsh Anglo-American General Encyclopedias 1704-1967 New York: R. R. Baker and Company, 1968 p.89 From 1893-1897 it was republished as Johnsons Universal Encyclopedia. The encyclopedia was sold to D. Appleton & Company midway through the project, sovols. 2, 3, 4, 6 and 7 - the first to be published - retain the Johnson imprint, whiles vols. 1, 5 and 8 were published under the Appleton imprint. The editor of this edition was Charles Kendall Adams, president of Cornell University.Walsh p.90 In 1900 the encyclopedia was revised again by Adams and expanded to 12 volumes. As Johnson was no longer involved, this edition was published as Universal Cyclopaedia, which is described as one of the best encyclopedias of the time. Further editions were published in 1901, 1903 and 1905. Upon Adams' death in 1902, editorial duties were taken over by Rossiter JohnsonWalsh p.169 In the \\"Publisher's Announcement\\" in Volume I of the original edition, A. J. Johnson stated that Horace Greeley suggested the plan for the work and urged its publication, and was a primary advisor. Greeley is listed as an associate editor. One of Greeley's requirements was that the cyclopaedia \\"be pre-eminently a book of facts, and to a very limited extent, if at all, a volume of discussions or of critical opinions.\\"Johnson's new universal cyclop√¶dia : a scientific and popular treasury of useful knowledge New York : A.J.

Feeding This species is an ectoparasite of other molluscs. Members of the species bore a hole through the host's shell and suck its blood or digestive organ (depending on the prey) over a period of months. Consistent with their suctorial feeding habit, they have a long proboscis, reduced buccal mass, and simplified digestive system compared to other Muricids. Available online at: ResearchGate (HTML, PDF), BHL (info, scan of print version). Prey include the oyster Ostrea cf. fisheri , the limpet-like slipper shell Crucibulum spinosum, and the vermetid gastropod Tripsycha (Eualetes) tulipa.

Early life and education  Born and raised in Manheim in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania, Rice grew up with his parents in his grandparent's home on Market Square that had been occupied by his family for four generations. His parents were John Rice and Sara Seltzer Rice. His grandfather, Samuel Rice, operated a carriage painting business in a shop at the back of the property. Interested in painting from a young age, William Rice set up a small studio in the corner of his grandfather's shop. He took occasional lessons from itinerant painters. After completing high school, Rice himself began teaching drawing, saving his money to attend art school in Philadelphia, where he lived with a cousin. He won an art school scholarship, and also got a job with the Philadelphia Times as a staff artist. He began studies in 1893 at the newly founded Drexel Institute, where Howard Pyle was among his teachers. Rice also attended classes at the Pennsylvania Museum and School of Industrial Art, now known as the University of the Arts. There, he began a friendship with Frederick Meyer, a German immigrant who later was hired as art supervisor for the Stockton public schools.  Career  = Teaching = In 1900, Meyer hired Rice as an assistant art supervisor for Stockton public schools, and Rice relocated to Stockton, California. By 1902, Meyer moved to San Francisco, and Rice was promoted to Meyer's job. Rice began a personal exploration of scenic California, visiting Yosemite National Park in 1901 and Lake Tahoe in 1904. He also visited all of the Spanish missions in California. In 1910, Meyer convinced Rice to relocate to the San Francisco Bay Area to participate more actively in the Arts and Crafts Movement, and Rice obtained a job teaching art for the Alameda public schools. He fraternized with members of the Berkeley Art Colony and contributed his block prints to their Exhibition of California Artists at the Hillside Club in 1911. An online facsimile of the entire text of Vol. 1 is posted on the Traditional Fine Arts Organization website (http://www.tfaoi.com/aa/10aa/10aa557.htm ). R. L. Stevenson house - Monterey, 1915 Night - Yosemite, 1920 San Juan Bautista, 1920 . Source of the Glacier, 1920. Rice spent the rest of his professional career teaching art in the Alameda and Oakland public schools, including at Alameda High School, Fremont High School (1919‚Äì30), Castlemont High School (1930-40), and the UC Extension evening classes at University of California, Berkeley (1932‚Äì43). He taught drawing and painting, as well as a variety of crafts, including metalworking and leather working. Rice's friend Frederick Meyer had founded the School of the California Guild of Arts and Crafts, originally located in Berkeley and later in Oakland. After receiving accreditation, the school was renamed in 1936 the California College of Arts and Crafts and in 2003 became the California College of the Arts. Meyer hired Rice to teach summer classes at his school and Rice was able to obtain his B.F.A. in 1929 from the School of the California Guild of Arts and Crafts. = Fine art and commercial art = He began freelance writing and illustrating for Sunset Magazine. In 1913, Rice studied design with Ralph H. Johonnot, an associate of Arthur Wesley Dow, who was an early advocate of color block printing in the United States. Rice toured Europe in the summer of 1913, visiting Chartres, Rothenberg and Venice. In 1915, Rice married Susan Steel, and they honeymooned at Lake Tahoe, California. That same year, the Panama‚ÄìPacific International Exposition took place in San Francisco, and he was impressed by the Japanese woodblock prints he saw there. He resolved to become a woodblock print artist. Instead of following the traditional Japanese team method, where an artist did an original painting, who then turned it over to a team of wood carvers and printers, he decided to take control of the entire creative process himself. In 1918, Rice had his first major exhibition of wood and linoleum block prints at the Palace of Fine Arts in San Francisco, which was designed by Bernard Maybeck for the Panama Pacific International Exposition. Gump's in San Francisco was one of his leading dealers. His work was displayed in the printmaker's exhibition at the 1939 New York World's Fair. Rice's artistic collaborators and influences included Pedro de Lemos, Elizabeth Norton, Roi Partridge, Gustave Baumann, Lorenzo P. Latimer, Norma Bassett Hall and the sisters Mary & Frances Gearhart. Rice's work was featured in a one-man show at Villa Montalvo in Saratoga, California in 1959.  Death and legacy  Rice died at his home in Oakland, California on 27 August 1963 at the age of 90. He is buried in his hometown at the Manheim Fairview Cemetery in Manheim, Pennsylvania. = Bibliography = Rice wrote two teaching texts, Block Printing in the Schools (1929) and Block Prints: How To Make Them (1941), both published by Bruce Publishing Company. Rice is included in the book Artists in California 1786-1940 (1986) by Edan Milton Hughes. His daughter, Roberta Rice Treseder, published a book in 2009, William S. Rice: California Block Prints which is a biography and includes images of his printmaking as well as woodblock printing methods and materials. And his granddaughter, Ellen Treseder Sexauer, wrote a book in 2015, William S. Rice, Art and Life. = Post mortem exhibitions = In 1978‚Äì1979, the Smithsonian American Art Museum held an exhibition called American Color Woodcuts: The Years of Transition, that featured the works of 40 artists including Rice. In 2015 and 2016, ‚ÄúThe Nature of William S. Rice: Arts and Crafts Painter and Printmaker‚Äù exhibition was released and travelled to the Crocker Art Museum and Pasadena Museum of California Art.  Collections  Rice's works are in many public art collections including; California College of the Arts, National Museum of American Art, Boston Public Library, New York Public Library, California State Library, Library of Congress, Achenbach Foundation for the Graphic Arts, Elvehjem Museum, Oakland Museum of California, Two Red Roses Foundation, Fitzwilliam Museum, Fine Art Museums of San Francisco, Saint Mary's College of California Museum of Art, Indianapolis Museum of Art, and Hood Museum of Art at Dartmouth College.

Van Aaken became known as the \\"Running Doctor\\" and was the founder of the training method called the Waldnieler Dauerlauf (German: \\"Waldniel endurance run\\"). He is generally recognized as the founder of the long slow distance method of endurance training.Morris, Alfred F. 1984. Sports medicine: prevention of athletic injuries. University of Michigan; .Anderson, Bob and Joe Henderson. 1972. Guide to distance running. Indiana University. As a sports physician, trainer and advocate of new developments he directed himself fanatically to distance running and the training of \\"pure endurance\\" (\\"reine Ausdauer\\") with high mileage in the training program. He was an opponent of the method of interval training that prevailed until halfway the sixties. In the early 1960s, van Aaken trained among others the German athlete Harald Norpoth, who won silver in the 1964 Olympic Games in Tokyo on the 5000 meters. In 1972 Van Aaken was hit by a car during his own training, which cost him both legs. Since this accident he moved in a wheelchair and became also a champion for disabled sports and wheelchair racing. He also held countless lectures, also in the United States and Japan, and organized running races, especially marathons for women, besides ultra running events. Health and longevity Van Aaken stated that human beings were able to reach the age of 100, if they would not live so \\"hopelessly unbiologically\\". In the \\"biologic\\" life style that he advocated, sports played an important role, especially the development of endurance. He lauded a daily endurance run for everybody, also for women, elders and children, combined with moderate eating and drinking. He also held the opinion that the female sex would eventually perform better in endurance events than the male, if all social barriers were dealt with that currently enhinder this. To propagate his ideas, he wrote a number of books, the most famous titled Programmiert f√ºr 100 Lebensjahre (\\"Programmed for lifespan 100\\"). Proponent of women's running Van Aaken was an early proponent of women's running. In 1967, van Aaken asked Anni Pede, a 27-year-old middle- distance runner and mother of two also from West Germany, and Monika Boers, a 19-year-old from the Netherlands, to participate in a marathon organized by his running club in Waldniel. According to German sports historian Karl Lennartz, journalists skeptical of 13-year-old Maureen Wilton's recent world best in Toronto, Ontario, Canada asked van Aaken if women and teenagers were capable of such a performance. Mocked and derided for claiming that faster times were indeed possible, van Aaken chose Pede and Boers to prove himself correct. Although the German Athletic Association (Deutscher Leichtathletik- Verband) did not yet officially permit women to run, race officials did allow the two women to start 30 meters behind the men. Pede came in third, her 3:07:26.2 set a new world best, and Boers finished in 3:19:36.3. Van Aaken had tested this before in women's cross country races which had no distance limit for women. He had all the support of the regional track & field association of which he was the women's spokesman which facilitated his tasks to further women's athleticsErnst van Aaken, MD, and the beginning of women's marathon racing in Germany.

A largely self-taught composer, his output includes several motets, two masses, a few patriotic songs, works for solo organ, and the operetta L'Intransigeant (produced in Ottawa in 1906). His organ piece Suite de quatre pi√®ces pour grand orgue is his most well known composition. Dedicated to Joseph Bonnet, it is noted for its \\"brilliant toccata\\" at the finale. His works have been published by Orme, Le Passe-Temps, and Ed. Archambault. Composers Guillaume Couture and Vincent d'Indy were admirers of Tremblay's music. Life and career Born in Montreal, Tremblay, along with Alexis Contant, was one of the first major Canadian composers to be trained exclusively in his native country. At the age of 12 he began studying music with Father Sauv√©, the organist at Saint Joseph's Church in Montreal. He later studied with Alcibiade B√©ique (piano and organ), Father Cl√©ophas Borduas (Gregorian chant), and Romain-Octave Pelletier I (organ and fugue). Tremblay became the organist at Saint Joseph's Church in 1892 after having turned down a similar position at the Dominican Church in Saint-Hyacinthe, Quebec. He remained in that post until 1894 when he became the organist at the Notre-Dame Cathedral Basilica, Ottawa. He was the organist at that church for the next 26 years during which time he also worked as a prominent organist, composer, and teacher in Ottawa. His pupils in that city included Joseph Beaulieu, Wilfrid Charette, Oscar O'Brien, and his own son, the composer George Tremblay. In 1920 Tremblay moved to Salt Lake City, Utah to assume the post of organist at the Cathedral of the Madeleine. He left there in 1925 to become the organist at St. Vincent de Paul Church in Los Angeles. He remained at that church until his death in Los Angeles in 1949.

A sauna suit is sometimes called a \\"rubber suit\\" because the early types were made of rubber or rubberized cloth. Now, sauna suits are typically made of PVC or coated nylon cloth. The construction is typically in the style of a waterproof sweat suit, consisting of a pullover jacket and drawstring pants. The closures at waist, neck, wrists and ankles are all elasticated to help retain body heat and moisture within the garment. In some sauna suits, the jacket also includes a hood to provide additional retention of body heat. Weight loss A sauna suit is commonly worn during physical exercise as an aid to weight loss, for example by boxers, MMA fighters or wrestlers, who wish to qualify for a specific weight class. The body temperature elevation and the profuse sweating induced by wearing the suit cause a rapid loss in body weight by loss of water. Because of this dehydration effect, sauna suits should be used with great caution. The body temperature elevation and water loss while wearing a sauna suit can lead to the possibility of heat stroke and dehydration, in extreme cases causing death.. Thus, a sauna suit should not be worn while doing extreme exercise or in hot conditions. A sauna suit is not intended for use in a sauna. The efficacy of a sauna suit as a training aid is a subject of much debate. A 2017 study at Western Colorado University found that wearing a sauna suit while exercising increased fat loss, improved cardiovascular health and boosted muscle performance. Other authorities differ and oppose sauna suit use . In view of this range of views, many writers encourage users to be moderate and careful in their sauna suit use and to avoid extremes . Body wrapping Sauna suits are also worn for body wrapping in some health spas. The wearer is first wrapped in bandages saturated with mineral and/or herbal preparations and then covered with a sauna suit. The objective of this process is to enable the wearer to \\"sweat out toxins\\", however there is little scientific evidence to support the effectiveness of this practice. Sauna suits are often worn specifically for such sweat excretion rather for exercise or weight loss. Psoriasis treatment A medical use for a sauna suit is in the treatment of psoriasis, an inflammation of the skin causing itchiness and discomfort. The symptoms of psoriasis can be relieved by use of ointments and by keeping the skin moist. The wearing of a sauna suit helps to retain skin moisture and to prevent the ointment from leaking out and staining other clothing, furniture or bedding. In medical literature, a sauna suit is also called an \\"occlusion suit\\".

Geography Sudmerberg, view from Harz mountains The settlement is located between Goslar town centre and the Oker in the southeast. The Abzucht stream runs between the Sudmerberg hill, rising in the east, and the northern edge of the Harz mountains. The area is part of the Harz Nature Park. Sudmerberg currently has about 1,880 inhabitants.http://www.goslar.de/stadtteile/sudmerberg.htm The Vienenburg‚ÄìGoslar railway follows the Abzucht river south of Sudmerberg. To the north, the Bundesstra√üe 6 federal highway runs to the neighbouring town of Bad Harzburg.  History  An early medieval lowland castle, located at the confluence of the Abzucht and the Oker, was first mentioned as Sudburg in a 1064 deed issued by King Henry IV of Germany. Probably affiliated with the nearby royal palace of Werla, it lent its name to the adjacent Sudmerberg hill. Today, only the foundations remain of the fortress which fell into ruins in the 14th century. Wellspring and Girl with the umbrella In April 1935, Goslar's town council issued a development plan for the Sudmerberg settlement, mainly for employees of the nearby Rammelsberg ore mine (Preussag) and the Oker ironworks. As early as December 1936, the first settlers moved into their new houses, further dwellings were occupied the next year. Though construction works ceased during World War II, from 1948 onwards numerous refugee families found homes in Sudmerberg. In expectation of an increase in the permanent population, Sudmerberg Primary School was built, opening in 1950. Until about 1960 there was an open-cast mine on the Sudmerberg hill in a small sandstone quarry.  Points of interest  Sudmerberg tower * A wellspring in the central market square contains a lump of ore from the Rammelsberg mine. The sculpture called Girl with the Umbrella (M√§dchen mit dem Wasserschirm) was created by artist, Anna Barth from Sankt Andreasberg. * From the summit of the Sudmerberg, a medieval watchtower, the Sudmerberger Warte, erected by the imperial city of Goslar, offers scenic views of the entire town of Goslar, the northern Harz foothills and the highest mountain in the Harz, the Brocken massif.

Biography  Born in St. Petersburg to a family of a typesetter, Trotsky took art classes from the renowned painter Nicholas Roerich, graduated from the Academy of Arts in 1920 (then named \\"Petrograd Free Art Workshops\\") and 2nd Polytechnic in 1921. He also apprenticed with \\"Red Doric\\" architect Ivan Fomin around the same time. Often cited for his turn from Constructivism towards Stalinist neo-Classicism in the 1930s, Trotsky's training under Fomin indicates a long familiarity with classical forms. The high point of his Constructivist work is probably the Kirov District Administration building of 1938. Trotsky's best-known project is the House of Soviets in Saint Petersburg. At the year of its completion, the building was the largest office building in Saint Petersburg (then Leningrad). In March 1936, the Leningrad Soviet decided to relocate all the city's administration to a new site at the southern end of International Avenue. In open tender, Trotsky's project was selected over ten others. It was completed after Trotsky death, with co- authors Modest Shepilevsky and Yakov Lukin, and it features an impressive 11-meter-high frieze by Soviet sculptor Nikolai Tomsky.

The church was designed by Sten Hummel-Gumaelius and is made of wood. It suffered an arson attack in 1993 but was later rebuilt with an almost identical design.  History  When the population in the newly established Sala backe area in Uppsala grew in the early 1950s, the need for a small church became apparent. The architect Sten Hummel-Gumaelius ‚Äì cooperating with Jean Michon Bordes, proposed a design which was approved and construction of the church began by the firm Anders Di√∂s. It was opened on 14 December 1958. The church used to belong to Uppsala Cathedral parish, but it later became part of Vaksala parish when the parish borders were changed in 1963. An arson destroyed the main church building in July 1993, but the parish buildings survived the fire. It was rebuilt with mostly the same design after the fire, though minor changes were made. A roof window was made a bit bigger and the sacristy near the southern wall of the chancel was expanded.  Architecture  The building contains low rows of parish buildings combined with the nave which is characterized by its height and space, with a steep pitched roof and clean wooden surfaces. The floor-to-ceiling rafters of laminated timber contribute to the nave's individuality. The nave has been likened to a ship with the keel upwards.  Inventory  The altarpiece that was installed on 27 October 1963 depicts Jesus' entry into Jerusalem and was painted by Bror Hjorth. It was the only thing that could be saved from the 1993 fire, due to the firefighters concentrating their efforts on the chancel wall. Three pieces of textile art were donated to the church for its 25-year anniversary. They were made by B√§rbel Neumann and decorate the church walls. The organ, built by Gr√∂nlunds Orgelbyggeri, was installed in 1997. The organ architect Kerstin Fernert based the colors on Bror Hjorth's altarpiece.

A veteran holdup man, his criminal career lasted over 30 years and he was placed on the FBI's \\"Ten Most Wanted\\" list in 1953. That same year, his last, Bowerman organized and led the disastrous Southwest Bank holdup in St. Louis, Missouri, which resulted in a standoff between himself and his three partners against a force of over 100 officers of the St. Louis Police Department. The events were later made into a film, The Great St. Louis Bank Robbery (1959), starring Crahan Denton and Steve McQueen. Biography Fred William Bowerman's criminal career began in the 1930s and he was eventually arrested in Illinois for armed robbery in 1932. He served five years and was paroled in 1937 but soon after his release, he began committing robberies throughout the Chicago area. While living in Michigan, he drove to Chicago using stolen cars committing 36 robberies between June and October, 1938. Captured a year later, he was sentenced to Joliet Prison where he spent the next seven years.Newton, Michael. The Encyclopedia of Robberies, Heists, and Capers. New York: Facts On File Inc., 2002. (pg. 36-37) After his release in 1946, Bowerman kept a low profile for several years, but he was eventually identified as one of several men who robbed a bank in South Bend, Indiana for $53,000 in September 1952. The violent daylight robbery, much in the style of Thomas Holden or Alvin Karpis, attracted national attention in the United States as a bank employee was shot for \\"raising his hands too slowly\\". Nearing 60 years of age, Bowerman was named #46 by the FBI of its \\"Ten Most Wanted\\" list on March 3, 1953. A little over a month after the South Bend incident, Bowerman participated in one of the most violent bank heists in American history. On the afternoon of April 24 https://www.stltoday.com/news/archives/scenes-from-the-southwest-bank-robbery- of/collection_05898d40-47b8-11e8-82f2-4751ea86b456.html#anchor_item_10, 1953, he and three other men entered the Southwest Bank in south St. Louis, Missouri and attempted to hold up the bank. The robbery started out as planned as the men quickly gathered up around $140,000 from the bank teller's cages and prepared to carry them out in a nylon satchel. However, unknown to Bowerman and the others, a bank employee had set off a silent alarm. As the robbers were about to make their getaway, nearly 100 police officers arrived and surrounded the bank. As the robbers began firing at police through the windows, the bank employees hid in the vault to escape the firefight and tear gas thrown into the building. One police officer, Corporal Robert Heitz, was wounded in his head and neck, but eventually time began to work against the robbers. Bowerman took a female hostage and held a shotgun on her as he attempted to escape, making his way out onto the sidewalk before he shoved the woman to the pavement, breaking both her wrists. Bowerman was shot in the chest by police officer Melburn F. Stein. The bullet pierced a lung and lodged in his spine. Finding themselves trapped in the bank, Bowerman's remaining partners panicked. One man, Frank Vito, committed suicide by shooting himself with his pistol. When police finally stormed the bank, the other, William Scholl, attempted to go for a backup weapon but police disarmed him and dragged him off in handcuffs. The fourth member of the robbery team, one-time Marquette University college football star Glenn Chernick, the getaway driver, fled when police arrived. He was captured by detectives three days later at his father's house in Chicago. Bowerman was taken to a local hospital where he identified himself as John W. Frederick. However, the FBI used his fingerprints to prove his identity. Bowerman died of his wounds on May 1, 1953. He was later portrayed by Crahan Denton in The Great St. Louis Bank Robbery (1959); Melburn Stein, the officer who shot Bowerman, had a small role in the film.

History  Besipirdine was first considered for the treatment of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Hoechst-Roussel Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Hoecst AG) filed a patent in July 1993 protecting the use of N-(pyridinyl)-1H-indol-1-amines, including besipirdine, for the treatment of OCD, supported by preliminary data gathered from rat studies . In 1995, Hoechst AG filed a patent protecting the production of besipirdine, this time describing its memory-enhancing, analgetic and antidepressant qualities . With increasing research on besipirdine uncovering its effects on the cholinergic system, Hoechst AG filed a patent in the following year to protect substituted n-(pyrrol-1-yl)pyridinamines as anticonvulsant agents . In the midst of Phase II clinical studies of besipirdine in Alzheimer's disease, Hoechst AG merged with Rh√¥ne-Poulenc S.A. to form Aventis Pharma Limited. Under the new company Aventis, besipirdine ultimately failed in Phase III clinical trials due to severe cardiovascular side effects observed in a few patients in separate studies. In January 2004, UroGene acquired exclusive development and commercialization rights to besipirdine from Aventis in order to study its application in urology . In February 2007, UroGene filed its own patent protecting the crystal form of besipirdine chlorhydrate, its production process, and its applications in the pharmaceutical field. The drug is currently undergoing Phase III development for treatment of Lower Urinary Tract Dysfunctions .  Mechanism of Action  As a member of the aminopyridine class, besipirdine enhances the release of acetylcholine by blocking M-channels, voltage-gated K+ channels, increasing neuronal excitation by depolarizing the cell. Additionally, besipirdine antagonizes the noradrenergic Œ±2 receptor, increasing electrically-stimulated and spontaneous [3H]norepinephrine release from cortical tissue slices, and inhibits norepinephrine uptake. The exact pathway is not yet understood but it has been shown that besipirdine does not open sodium channels, so its consequential effect on norephinephrine release may be Ca2+-independent. Further, [3H]norepinephrine release seems to be dependent on frequency and concentration of besipirdine in that higher frequency of stimulation causes a concentration-dependent inhibition of voltage-dependent K+ channels, which leads to inhibition of norepinephrine release.  Medical Uses  = Alzheimer's Disease = The most successful treatments for AD have been strategies targeting the cholinergic activity in the central nervous system, like acetylcholinesterase inhibitors. Other treatments target the adrenergic system and have been shown to improve memory deficits associated with AD. It was hypothesized that simultaneous treatment for both cholinergic and adrenergic deficits would be more effective than treatment that targeted individual systems alone. Besipirdine was shown to target dysfunctional cholinergic and adrenergic systems in Alzheimer's disease. It has been suggested as an anticonvulsant because of its adrenergic effects. Its effects on the cholinergic system may improve memory and cognitive deficits symptomatic of AD. = Other = Besipirdine was originally suggested as a treatment for OCD due to its effects on the adrenergic and serotonergic systems. \\"In vitro\\" studies of besipirdine indicated its potency in inhibiting serotonin reuptake in addition to norepinephrine reuptake. \\"In vivo\\", besipirdine showed efficacy in reducing schedule-induced polydipsia (SIP) in rats. The drug's anticonvulsant properties ultimately led Hoechst AG to pursue it as a treatment for Alzheimer's disease. After its discontinuation in the mid-1990s, besipirdine was re-evaluated as an oral treatment for Over Active Bladder (OAB) and is currently undergoing Phase III clinical trials, under UroGene. Interest in besipirdine as a treatment for OAB was piqued by its known effects on the adrenergic system. In isolated studies, besipirdine showed greater potency than duloxetine on bladder capacity, micturition volume, intercontraction interval, and an increase in striated sphincter EMG activity.  Pharmacology  Besipirdine primarily acts to enhance both cholinergic and adrenergic neurotransmission in the central nervous system. It is administered orally at a maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of 50 mg BID. In Phase II clinical trials, patients were administered 5 mg or 20 mg BID doses of besipirdine. Its N-despropyl metabolite, P86-7480, exhibits transient vasoconstrictor effects, producing a pressor effect of 16 ¬± 4 mm Hg after intravenous administration of 0.1 mg/kg, in monkey, rat and dog models.  Pharmacokinetics  The pharmacokinetics of besipirdine have been studied in conscious monkey. The calculated elimination half-life (t1/2) of besipirdine and P86-7480 after oral administration of 10, 20, and 40 mg/kg doses is 7.4 ¬± 2.1 hours. The t1/2 after intravenous administration of 10 mg/kg is 1.5 hours. Besipirdine is cleared through the kidneys at 0.13 ¬± 0.04 mL/min/kg; only 1% of the administered dose is excreted unused via the kidneys. In humans, using doses up to 30 mg, the t1/2 of besipirdine and P86-7480 were calculated as 3 hours, and 5.5‚Äì7 hours, respectively. Peak plasma concentrations of besipirdine and P86-7480 were calculated as 1.5‚Äì2 hours, and 2‚Äì3 hours, respectively.  Adverse Effects  Besipirdine is reported to be well tolerated. More severe adverse effects, such as bradycardia and postural hypotension, may have been a result of a high ratio of adrenergic to cholinergic potency caused by the metabolite P86-7480, which has direct vasoconstrictor effects. Some studies suggest that the effects of besipirdine on cognition are reversible after withdrawal from treatment, indicating that the efficacy of the drug is primarily symptomatic and not neuroprotective. = General =  See also  * Linopirdine * Sibopirdine  References  Category:Nootropics ","title":"Besipirdine"},{"id":"27100685","text":"is the third album by the Italian cantautori, Simone Tomassini.Di Carlo, Lorella, \\"Terzo album per Simone: Sesso gioia rock‚Äôn‚Äôroll (Makno/Delta Dischi)\\", MusicalNews, 9 July 2006 (in Italian, accessed 22 April 2010) It was released in 2006 on the Makno Music label, owned by Enrico Rovelli, the ex- manager of Vasco Rossi and Patti Pravo and founder of the Alcatraz Club in Milan.Fegiz, Mario Luzzatto, Simone: ¬´Un incidente ha cambiato la mia vita¬ª, Corriere della Sera, March 2004 (in Italian, accessed 22 April 2010) The album was toured throughout Italy in the summer of 2006,Il Quotidiano, \\"Simone Tomassini in concerto a Ripatransone\\" 28 July 2006 (in Italian, accessed 22 April 2010) and track 2, \\"Fuori come un balcone\\", was chosen for the sound track of Jerry Cal√†'s 2006 film, Vita Smeralda.Libero, \\"La Dolce Vita Smeralda\\" , 13 July 2006 (in Italian, accessed 22 April 2010) In addition to twelve original songs written and sung by Tomassini, Sesso Gioia Rock 'n' Roll includes his version of the Guns N' Roses song \\"Don't Cry\\" (track 3, \\"Non piangere mai\\").Corriere della Sera, \\"Sesso e rock' n' roll il remake di Simone\\", 10 June 2006, p. 17 (in Italian, accessed 22 April 2010) Also performing on the album are Roberto Colombo (synthesizer and bass), Vince Tempera (piano and Hammond organ), Pierluigi Mingotti (bass), and Giancarlo Bianchetti (acoustic guitar).

Only five units were built, all delivered by Valmet in 1955. The Maybach diesel engines used in the locomotives proved highly unreliable, resulting in a complete overhaul of the engine-transmission system in 1956‚Äì58, but this did not solve all of the reliability problems. The Hr11 series was withdrawn from service in 1972. History VR (Finnish Railways) started a modernization project in the early fifties. VR had a small amount of diesel and gasoline-powered railcars since the 1920s, but in 1952 VR had only steam locomotives. Modern aluminum-carriage diesel powered express multiple units (Dm3 and Dm4) were introduced in 1952. Related to these orders, VR ordered in 1952 five passenger train diesel locomotives with hydraulic transmission from Valmet Oy, Tampere. The locomotives were delivered in 1955. Technology The locomotives had originally two six-cylinder Maybach MD320 diesel engines driving each their own Maybach Mekydro K64B hydraulic-mechanical gearbox. The engines and transmission were placed in the bogies. The engine-transmission units proved to be very unreliable, and in 1956‚Äì58 a complete overhaul was done. Among other improvements, the engines were fitted with turbochargers, which increased the power from 450 hp to 600 hp, but simultaneously lowered the RPM from 1700 to 1500 r/min. The new engine designation was Maybach MD325. The gearboxes were changed to another type, Mekydro KL64. After the upgrade, the engines were reasonably reliable, but the reliability of the Maybach Mekydros did not improve significantly. Operation The locomotives carried a gray livery, with wine-red broad stripes. The gray color and sleek looks earned it the nickname Lent√§v√§ susi (Flying Wolf). They pulled mainly passenger trains between Tampere, Helsinki and Turku. All units were abandoned in 1972. Preservation No 1950 is stored at the Finnish Railway Museum.

Although his works display a broad range of stylistic influences, he is primarily associated with the twelve-tone technique. He is the author of the musical treatise The Definitive Cycle of the Twelve Tone Row. Tremblay was also noted for his unique capacity to extemporize on the piano and frequently performed as an improviser. Biography Born in Ottawa, Ontario, Tremblay was the son of composer and organist Am√©d√©e Tremblay and Rosa Martel Tremblay. As the son of an active composer and performer, young George was exposed to not only the classics, but to more contemporary composers; his father, Am√©d√©e, was an early champion of Cesar Franck, Max Reger, and Claude Debussy for Canadian audiences. In addition to receiving musical instruction from his father, Tremblay quickly learned how to extemporize at the keyboard in the style of these composers. At the age of eight Tremblay gave his first public performance, a recital for Canada‚Äôs prime minister, Sir Wilfrid Laurier, in which his father performed first on pipe organ and then George performed a few small pieces and improvisations. Tremblay would continue to develop as a piano improviser for the rest of his life. In 1920 the Tremblay family moved to Salt Lake City, Utah, when Am√©d√©e was appointed organist at the Cathedral of the Madeleine. Two years later the family would briefly live in San Diego where George, only twelve years old, worked as organist for a small Catholic church. The family moved one last time in 1925 to Los Angeles, California, where Am√©d√©e became the organist and choir director at St. Vincent de Paul Church. In 1927 Tremblay became the student of David Patterson, the author of Tone Patterns: The Didactic Materials and Principles of Piano Technique. For five years Tremblay studied harmony, counterpoint, and composition under Patterson. Tremblay quickly made a name for himself as a composer-improviser and public figure in Los Angeles, San Diego, and Oakland. His improvisations and compositions were a regular feature of the \\"Evenings on the Roof\\" concert series in Los Angeles. He was a recurring panel member on the Sunday evening radio quiz show, Are You Musical?, on Los Angeles station KMPC. This position helped Tremblay develop key connections with producers, writers, directors, actors, and composers. In 1934 Tremblay‚Äôs \\"long-standing ambition\\" to study under Arnold Schoenberg was realized when the composer emigrated from Europe to Los Angeles due to the rise of the Nazis under Adolf Hitler in 1933. Tremblay claims to have independently discovered the twelve-tone system of musical composition in the summer of 1933; upon telling Schoenberg, the master remarked that it was a natural thing to discover because it was the next logical development in tonality. Schoenberg, always willing to learn from his own students, supposedly was inspired to compose his Ode to Napoleon (1942) with a row of two symmetrical hexachords after hearing Tremblay‚Äôs Modes of Transportation (1940) make use of a similar idea. Schoenberg is also reported to have been a great admirer of Tremblay‚Äôs skill in improvising at the piano, claiming that \\"[Tremblay] never plays a wrong note\\" and advising him to simply write what he improvises. Tremblay and Schoenberg‚Äôs friendship remained close and lasted until Schoenberg‚Äôs death in 1951. On 10 July 1937, Tremblay married Verabel Champion, a writer and painter. The couple remained together for nearly thirty years until divorcing in 1965. The first meeting of the American Composers Alliance was held circa 1938 in Tremblay‚Äôs home in Beverly Hills. Several important composers were in attendance, including Robert Russell Bennett, Aaron Copland, Paul Pisk, Arnold Schoenberg, Gerald Strang, Ernst Toch, and Edgar Varese. Tremblay maintained his membership with the American Composers Alliance for the rest of his life. Tremblay was naturalized as a U. S. citizen on 8 September 1939. In 1965 Tremblay founded the School for the Discovery and Advancement of New Serial Techniques. This school was instrumental in teaching serial techniques to film and television composers. Some of Tremblay‚Äôs notable students are: Alexander Courage, Larry Fotine, Hugo Friedhofer, Earle Hagen, Quincy Jones, Richard Markowitz, Randy Newman, Marty Paich, Mel Powell, Robert O. Ragland. Jack Smalley, and Mark Snow. On 8 August 1969, Tremblay married Patricia Hedberg, a painter and one of his former piano and composition students, in Calabasas, California. Tremblay‚Äôs health began to deteriorate in 1971; he suffered a bout with cancer, two heart attacks, and cirrhosis. His composition and teaching activities were put on hold until 1975 when he became healthy enough to work again. Still, during this period of rest and recovery Tremblay managed to complete his treatise, The Definitive Cycle of the Twelve Tone Row (1974). Tremblay died on 14 July 1982, in Tijuana, Mexico, where he was receiving treatment for cirrhosis. The Definitive Cycle of the Twelve Tone Row The Definitive Cycle of the Twelve Tone Row (1974) is a music theory and composition treatise that is the result of Tremblay‚Äôs studies in the twelve-tone serial technique. The text was originally meant to function as a brief mechanical explanation, but it soon grew in scope as Tremblay realized the wider variety of users and applications to which the book was useful. Tremblay wrote, for example, that the \\"examples set in these books have proved invaluable to film composers, especially in the exigencies of meeting deadlines, since it gives positive and definitive answers to technical problems of a musical nature.\\" Tremblay‚Äôs basic explanation of The Definitive Cycle reads: \\"By taking a row, or a series of twelve different notes, and permutating the second six notes with the first six notes, twelve rows evolve. Taking the first note of each one of those rows successively we produce a new row, and by applying the same process of interpolating the second six with the first six, we arrive at another series of twelve rows. Each series we designate at a Set. By continuing this process for twenty-four Sets we arrive again at Set 1, completing the Cycle. All of my works since 1965 have been composed on the basis of this Cycle, most of them using an entire Cycle, which incidentally, contains 3456 notes.\\" Essentially, the treatise realizes \\"a vast immutable development of the initial row\\" that eschews traditional methods for developing a tone row (inversion, retrograde, and retrograde-inversion). Two of Tremblay‚Äôs later works, Symphony No. 3 (ca. 1973) and The Phoenix: a Dance Symphony (1982), were composed in this manner. In fact, Tremblay described his third symphony as \\"a textbook in actual sound of the process of this technique.\\" Tremblay was working on a sequel to The Definitive Cycle before his death. The second book was meant to deal primarily with more functional applications of the definitive cycle and included topics such as osinatos, sequences, harmonization of the row, and even 12 bar blues. His wife, Patricia, and Roger Steinman, a student and friend of Tremblay, organized the materials and gave them to the University of Maryland Libraries. The notes are currently held by University of Maryland‚Äôs Special Collections in the Performing Arts. Improvisation Between 1980 and 1982 Tremblay recorded his unique improvisations as a musical autobiography. These unpublished recordings were restored and are now housed in The George Tremblay Collection at Special Collections in Performing Arts at University of Maryland. Some of the improvisations are based within a particular style (such as jazz or Baroque) while others are based upon a preexisting theme or commemorate the death of a fellow composer. Additionally, Prologue Records released an LP containing Tremblay‚Äôs improvisations on a few original themes (DL-103).

North Korea, under a communist regime, does not have the same level of investment in baseball as South Korea. There are 10 professional teams in South Korea's KBO League. Baseball season runs from March to October. History =Before the Korean war= American missionaries brought baseball to Korea in the 19th century. In 1896, U.S. Marines played exhibitions against teams of Americans expatriates and the Seoul Athletic Club. The sport flourished in the period of Japanese rule. On December 1921, a team of American Major League players stopped in Seoul during a tour of Asia, and a Korean team was assembled to play against them. The Koreans were defeated, 23-3. Various Korean cities also participated in the Japanese Intercity Baseball Tournament, from its inception in 1927 until 1942.:ja:ÈÉΩÂ∏ÇÂØæÊäóÈáéÁêÉÂ§ß‰ºö (ÊúùÈÆÆ) In 1940 and 1942 Seoul won the tournament, defeating (respectively) the teams of Dalian and Osaka. At least one Korean played against a Babe Ruth-led team of American all-stars which toured Japan in 1934. =Post-war period= The 1980s marked the beginning of the professional baseball era in South Korea. In 1982, the MBC Chungyong, Lotte Giants, Samsung Lions, OB Bears, Haitai Tigers, and Sammi Superstars were launched, as was the highest-level league that they composed, the Korea Baseball Championship.http://www.korea.net/NewsFocus/Society/view?articleId=102256 This league continues to be South Korea's major league, and has expanded to 10 teams. The sport reached a new level of popularity when pitcher Chan Ho Park made his debut for the Los Angeles Dodgers in 1994. Park achieved a great deal of success in his Major League Baseball career, and paved the way for the American success of fellow South Korean players such as Hee-seop Choi, Byung- hyun Kim, Bong Jung-keun, Shin-Soo Choo, Hyun-jin Ryu, and Jung-ho Kang. It is also played widely on the local high school and collegiate level, as well as in a farm league (the Korea Baseball Futures League). Baseball's South Korean governing body is the Korea Baseball Organization, a member of the International Baseball Federation and the organization responsible for the nation's participation in such international competitions such as the Olympics, World Baseball Classic and the Asian Games. The KBO also manages Korea's highly successful national team. In the mid-2000s South Korea rose as a dominant power in the international baseball scene, twice placing second in the World Baseball Classic, and winning the bronze medal at the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, Australia, and the gold medal against Cuba at the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, China.

A function f on \\\\mathbb{R}^k has an approximate limit y at a point x if there exists a set F that has density 1 at the point such that if xn is a sequence in F that converges towards x then f(xn) converges towards y. Properties The approximate limit of a function, if it exists, is unique. If f has an ordinary limit at x then it also has an approximate limit with the same value. We denote the approximate limit of f at x0 by \\\\lim_{x \\\\rightarrow x_0} \\\\operatorname{ap} \\\\ f(x). Many of the properties of the ordinary limit are also true for the approximate limit.

The company was established by Maktoob (currently ‚ÄúJabbar Internet Group‚Äù) in July 2002, and it is headquartered in Dubai in the United Arab Emirates. CASHU is considered the first FinTech company in the Middle East and North Africa, serving nearly 3 million consumers in the region, being accepted by more than 7,000 online stores, and being available at over 300,000 points of sale for the e-wallet funding, which has helped merchants around the globe to grow businesses and to expand smoothly and securely in the MENA region, offering their products and services to millions of buyers residing in this raw region. CASHU is built upon and encapsulates the most sophisticated and up to date fraud prevention and anti-money laundering systems, reducing the risks associated with online payments for both buyers and sellers, which all allows for wider, safer and faster consumer participation in e-commerce. In addition to the Company's headquarters in the Dubai International Financial Center in Dubai, United Arab Emirates; the Company has an office in Amman, Jordan, and an office in Cairo, Egypt, through which all CASHU operations are managed.  History  =Early history= The continuous success of Maktoob led to the company's desire to launch new e-businesses, the first of which was in 2002 when CASHU was launched as an alternative online payment method for the use of credit cards online, which was considered the first of its kind in the MENA region. On August 25, 2009, Yahoo! acquired Maktoob in a deal that exceeded $85 million, and according to the agreement between the two companies, the deal did not include the rest of Maktoob‚Äôs products, including CASHU, Souq.com, Araby and Tahadi MMO games, which became part of Jabbar Internet Group headed by Maktoob founder, and Tiger Global as the major shareholder. =Souq Group subsidiary (2012-2015)= In 2012, Naspers Limited took a stake alongside with Jabbar Internet Group and Tiger Global in CASHU and Souq.com, and so it was listed under the umbrella of Souq Group, which included Souq.com, Sukar.com and Qexpress (a logistics and shipping company), as well as CASHU. While Souq Group continued to focus on growth in the e-commerce field, CASHU has grown in its own vision towards cashless societies and Financial Inclusion, and started to move away from the vision of Souq, especially that the regulations and compliance conditions for electronic payments in general and for e-wallets in particular are still in development stage in the region, so it was important for CASHU to leave Souq Group. Later in 2013, CASHU launched a new online payment gateway, PAYFORT. =The management buyout (2015 ‚Äì present)= In December 2015, CASHU Management purchased CASHU in the first Management Buyout deal in the Middle East, with consistence with most of the region‚Äôs central banks‚Äô visions of developing a ‚Äúcashless society‚Äù.  Regulation  After the management buyout was completed, CASHU started 2016 with a major milestone by migrating its business to Singapore and got approved to operate as Stored Value Facility by the Monetary Authority of Singapore. All CASHU‚Äôs merchants, vendors and consumers were then required to maintain a full KYC (Know Your Customer) record that complies with MAS‚Äô rules and regulations, which was a major step towards regulating the core business of CASHU. To do so, CASHU has invested heavily in its Compliance and Risk platform and technology, introducing the KYC concept for the first time since inception. This has caused an immediate loss of business and irritation to the authorities of Saudi Arabia, who didn‚Äôt feel comfortable sharing its citizen ID‚Äôs with a non- regulated entity. Accordingly, the Saudi Arabian Monetary Agency blocked CASHU website in Saudi Arabia on January 28, 2016. On October 1, 2016, CASHU partnered with Mastercard and Noor Bank in the United Arab Emirates to launch the first prepaid virtual card in the region, which is approved by the Central Bank of the UAE. This product gave CASHU a legal approval to operate in the UAE as a FinTech Company in cooperation with Noor Bank. Later on, Bank Albilad in Saudi Arabia announced on October 10, 2016 that it has entered into a strategic partnership with CASHU to develop innovative payment products and services in Saudi Arabia. The partnership with Bank Albilad allowed CASHU to recommence its operations in Saudi Arabia before the end of 2016, since it had met the requirements of the Saudi Arabian Monetary Authority. In October 2017, CASHU and Bank Albilad completed the compliance requirements of SAMA and received its approval to operate in KSA. Bank Albilad issued a letter to CASHU allowing it to operate in KSA accordingly.  Services  =The e-wallet= This is the original model that is the umbrella of all the other services. It provides turn-key solutions to all consumers‚Äô dreams when it comes to their micro-financial interactions. It is available for both adults and for juniors with different rules and limitations. =Prepaid virtual card= A prepaid virtual Mastercard that allows consumers to shop at the entire Mastercard merchant network online. It is offered in partnership with Mastercard and reputable issuing banks in the region. =Debit card= A Mastercard debit card that is connected to the e-wallet balance directly, which allows consumers to shop at the entire Mastercard merchant network and withdraw cash from ATMs. =Peer-to-peer transfer between wallets= This allows consumers to send and receive credit through their e-wallets, including scheduled and recurring transfers. =Remittance with a cash-out option= This allows consumers to transfer money from their e-wallets to anyone, even if they don‚Äôt have an e-wallet, with a cash-out option through Money Express Integration. Consumers can create and manage beneficiary accounts that they frequently use to transfer to. =Savings program= The Savings Program enables consumers to buy deposit certificates with fixed due dates and specific amounts, which are locked up for a period of time (keeping their money inside their e-wallets), after which they can start earning profit. =Bill presentment= An aggregated hub for regional and global bill presentment network, which enables the e-wallet holders to pay their bills remotely.

It was produced by PorchLight Pictures and David Giancola's Edgewood Entertainment and first shown by Pax TV.Edgewood Studios: About Edgewood - recent productions Retrieved 2012-11-08 Plot A dam outside a town is filling up with water due to heavy rains. David Powell, the disgraced architect of the dam building project, comes back to town to reunite with his estranged family, however he is rejected, with his wife claiming that he came back purely to see the dam. David then visits the dam and reveals that the project manager cut corners in order to take money himself and framed the architect to hide his own corruption. The dam's resident engineer, Frank, David's son, Garth and David himself set out to relieve the growing pressure on the dam wall, however the pressure release does not work, as corner cutting had led to this portion not being completed. Through flooding the warehouse district, Frank allows the townspeople enough time to escape, sacrificing himself in the process. Garth and his father become trapped within the dam as the structure begins to buckle, but Garth who was doing a project review at college reveals knowledge of the dam's construction. He then pulls a C4 charge out of his pocket and once a hole is blasted in the wall opposite the door, revealing an exit pipe, both Garth and his father make an escape to a creek bed. They are then picked up by his mother and with his dad driving attempt to outrun the water raging from the now flooded dam. After realising that this won't be possible, David drives the car to the top of a 2-storey car park. The water flows through and under the car park instead of washing it away due to its design and having been built by David, who according to his mother is the best architect in the world.

A chemical mimic dupes an operator (e.g. a predator) by showing an adaptive chemical resemblance to an object of its environment and as a consequence receives selective advantage. In all cases of chemical mimicry it has been found that the mimicking species is the only species to benefit from the reaction with either costs or no effect on the duped species. This is by adapting to produce chemicals (ex: allomones, pheromones, odours, etc.) that will cause a desirable behavioural reaction in the species being deceived and a selective advantage to the mimic. Chemical mimicry exists within many of the different forms of mimicry such as aggressive, protective, Batesian, and M√ºllerian mimicry and can involve a number of different senses. Mimicking semiochemicals, which cannot be seen, make up some of the most widely used forms of chemical mimicry and is therefore less apparent than more visual forms. As a result of this, this topic has been relatively neglected in research and literature. Two examples of organisms displaying chemical mimicry include the mimicking of Noctuid pheromones by bolas spiders in order to draw prey to the spider‚Äôs location and the duping of insects within their own nests by mimicking their odours in order to enter and hide within the nest undetected. It is important to note that in all forms of mimicry the mimicking organism is not conscious of the deceit used and does not act intentionally to trick other organisms. Classification Chemical mimicry exists in many forms and for a variety of uses. It may be classified by the function it performs for the mimicking species and the effect that the mimic will have on the species that is deceived. It can be used for such functions as deterring predators, drawing prey, to allow a parasite to deceive a host species, or to help assist in the reproduction of an organism. = Aggressive mimicry = Bolas spiders emit chemicals to attract prey (Noctuid moths) Aggressive mimicry through the use of chemicals is used among a wide variety of animals. It functions to either lure the deceived organism to the deceiver or it allows for the organism to accept the presence of a parasite. The chemical mimicry used by parasites allows for the deceived organism to accept the presence of the deceiver while they benefit from either taking up food supplies or directly preying on the host species from within their nest.  Predator  Chemical mimicry of an organism‚Äôs pheromones allows predators with this ability to draw select prey to them, rather than spend their energy finding and attempting to capture these organisms with varied success. The pheromones are typically used by the prey species to attract members of their own species as potential mates. In the case of predatory chemical mimicry, the predator has evolved to emit chemicals that are structurally similar and will cause the same behavioural reactions to be displayed by the prey. However, the mimicked pheromones will draw the animal toward the predator rather than a potential mate. One group of organisms that use this method are Bolas spiders (genus: Mastophora). Bolas spiders will emit chemicals that attract their prey, noctuid moths. These spiders have replaced the need to spin elaborate webs to capture prey by mimicking the pheromones emitted by female moths to attract males of the species effectively. In studies conducted on this spider it has been found that the moths only approach from downwind of the spider and that all of the moths captured were, in fact, male.  Parasites  Cuckoo bees mimic the eggs of other bee species and shift parental care onto hosts Parasitic use of chemical mimicry involves the invasion of the nest of a duped species, which may consist of an individual or a colony. By emitting mimics of the chemicals that create the host‚Äôs familiar odours the invader is able to conceal themselves efficiently within the nest without alerting the host. One example of a group of insects that uses this method of chemical mimicry would be cuckoo bees (genus: Nomada). Cuckoo bees will parasitize bees of the families Melittidae and Andrenidae. Cuckoo bee males will produce chemicals that are similar in structure to the volatile lipids secreted by host females and these chemicals are transferred to cuckoo females so that they may camouflage their eggs within the host‚Äôs nest. This would allow the females to pass off the care of her eggs and larvae onto the host, benefiting the parasite and burdening the host. = Protective = Protective forms of chemical mimicry work to benefit the mimicking species by preventing harm. In most cases this achieved by acting as a deterrent to other organisms by mimicking the chemicals emitted by another species that has a mechanism to deter predators. This form of mimicry is known as Batesian Mimicry.  Batesian Mimicry  In Batesian mimicry, potential prey organisms will mimic chemicals emitted by an organism that poses a greater risk to the predator in order to deter attack. Most commonly this form of chemical mimicry is seen in plant species through the release of mimicked defense chemicals. The organism being mimicked may contain noxious chemicals used to deter predators from consuming them as it will lead to the predator becoming ill. By using Batesian mimicry the operator will mimic a chemical aspect, such as ‚Äúdefense signals\\" used by plants, in order to deceive the herbivore or predator into avoiding an edible organism. = Reproductive = Chemical mimicry can also have benefits on the reproductive success of the operator. This form is used primarily by flowers in order to deceive pollinators. There are two main types, the first being pseudocopulation which involves attracting male pollinators by mimicking the pheromones of females of the species. The second type involves female plants mimicking the chemical signals of males of the same species. By doing this the female plant is able to draw more pollinators despite not producing the pollen that the animal is looking for. Bee pseudo-copulating with orchid  Pseudocopulation  Pseudocopulation is achieved when a flower successfully mimics the appearance and the pheromones emitted by the female of an insect species. The chemicals emitted by the mimicking species work to draw these pollinators to the plant and increase the number of visits to and time spent on the flower. This will increase the chances that pollen will efficiently stick to the organism or that pollen already stuck to it will be transferred successfully to the plant. In one study on mining bees (Andrena nigroaenea) and spider orchids (Ophrys sphegodes Mill.) it was found that unpollinated spider orchids emitted odours that consisted of hydrocarbons that were an exact match for the odours released by virgin female bees. As a result, male mining bees are extremely attracted to the flowers of the spider orchid, triggering more quick visits to the flower and in some cases the male bees attempt copulation, either getting themselves sufficiently covered in pollen or successfully transferring it to another plant.

Located in Fairmount Park, the bridge also spans Martin Luther King, Jr., Drive, and Kelly Drive. The name Philadelphia & Reading Railroad (P&R;) was later shortened to Reading Railroad. The current bridge replaced an adjacent P&R; bridge, built of wood. Prior to that, one of the earliest suspension bridges in the United States, the 1808 Chain Bridge at Falls of Schuylkill (collapsed 1816), was built at this location. That was replaced by an 1818 covered bridge, built on the chain bridge's abutments, which washed away in 1822. The P&R; built the viaduct, 1853‚Äì56, to carry coal cars to the company's coal terminal on the Delaware River in the Port Richmond neighborhood of Philadelphia. The bridge's design is unusual. Because it crosses the river at an oblique angle, it was constructed as a ribbed skew arch bridge, with each span composed of a series of offset stone arches. While not as strong as skewed barrel vault spans, these spans were much easier to build, while still assuring that the bridge's abutments were parallel to the water flow. The bridge consists of six main spans, each in length, crossing the river and Kelly Drive; five small arches, each in length, for pedestrian traffic; and a arch over Martin Luther King, Jr., Drive. The bridge's spandrel walls were reinforced in 1935. The bridge continues to carry rail traffic to this day.

Pra√ßa Velha (Old Square), formerly known as Pra√ßa (Square), was the primitive civic center and the market square of the city of P√≥voa de Varzim in Portugal. It is located in Bairro da Matriz historic district and is surrounded by the main church of P√≥voa de Varzim (Igreja Matriz), the primitive Town Hall and the house of a notable 17th-century P√≥voa de Varzim seafarer. Since the Middle Ages the Pra√ßa has been used for markets and fairs, to such an extent that the term \\"Pra√ßa\\" is often used for \\"market\\" in the local parlance. Pra√ßa Velha became the town's urban core in the Late Middle Ages and was located in the royal land established by the early Portuguese kings after disputes with the Lords of Varzim. Throw Rua de S√£o Pedro street, it bordered the Varzim Old town square, the core of the medieval fiefdom of Varzim. With the Age of Discovery, the area around the square developed with rich architecture built by the seafarers, a local bourgeoisie, and declined with the 1791 royal provision which established the new town square, Pra√ßa do Almada. History =14th century: the town's new urban core= In 1308, King Denis wrote a charter in which he gave his royal land in Varzim to 54 local families. The inhabitants would have to create a \\"P√≥voa\\", a new settlement in Varzim, bordered to the south by the primitive Roman and Early Medieval core of the Town of Varzim, which was controlled by knights under a feudal structure. King Denis also encouraged the creation of free fairs all around the kingdom. In time, the Pra√ßa became the site of the free fair and the location for the public butchery. It was a wide area bordered by the Town Hall (from the 15th century) and the Madre Deus Chapel (prior to 1521). The early Town Hall governed the municipality from the Pra√ßa from the first half of the 16th century and probably much earlier. The building was probably built in the 15th century and originally had an arcade structure.Edif√≠cio dos antigos Pa√ßos do Concelho da P√≥voa de Varzim- IGESPAR =16th century: the impact of the Age of Discovery= Madre de Deus Chapel. In the 16th century, single storey houses dominated the town's landscape, but there are indications of multiple floored habitations, with curved lintels and sculpted exterior facades. This more advanced architecture is associated with rich gentlemen who had made their fortunes through seafaring. These included Amador Alvares, explorer of the route to India, and navigators Pedro Fernandes, Diogo Pyz de S√£o Pedro, Louren√ßo Dias and others. This bourgeoisie was the owner of most of the real estate around the Square which the population saw as the urban area. The Madre Deus Chapel was built, possibly before 1521, by nobleman Jo√£o Gomes Gaio, father of the knight Jo√£o Martins Gaio, related with the maritime trade of Vila do Conde. He lived in P√≥voa civic center because there he could easily recruit men.As Prociss√µes na P√≥voa de Varzim (1900‚Äì1950). Volume 1 - Deolinda Carneiro, Faculdade de Letras da Universidade do Porto. 2006 This noble and influential family provided great benefits to P√≥voa during that period. Madre Deus Chapel was an important building, popular amongst the common people due to its central location in the town and even more popular than the first church, the ancient Senhora de Varzim Church, located in Dores Square in the old town. House of Ant√≥nio Cardia. Pilot-major of the Portuguese Armada during the defense of Bahia in 1624. Cardia also established the local Holly Week Celebrations in 1687. Due to its central location and position of safety, unlike the main church, the ordinary judge of the town, councilmen and people asked the archbishop of Braga in 1544 for \\"a license to place the Holly Sacrament in the sacrarium\\". This was granted and lead to the establishment of the Corpus Christi Procession in the town. Since 1591, the clergymen of the parishes of Beiriz, Amorim, Terroso and Estela were obliged to participate in this. Their number was augmented from 1625 by priests from Laundos, Navais and Argivai, causing protests by Vila do Conde in 1637 concerning the growing importance that P√≥voa was getting in the region. Those surrounding parishes were integrated by the civil administration into the Municipality of P√≥voa de Varzim after the liberal reforms of 1836. Jo√£o Martins Gaio and his wife, Maria Afonso, were the chapel administrators. They and their son, Jorge Martins Gaio, were authorized to be buried in the chapel \\"with the coat of arms carved in rock, by authorization of the archbishop of Braga venerated Sir Barthelomeu dos Martires, given during the visit to the Town of Esposende in January 13th, 1560.\\" The area between the Madre Deus Chapel and the Town Hall, referred to as a \\"square of this town\\" in 1596, was the true civic center, coming close to the role that a square played in a medieval city, where a cathedral or church dominated, the market took place and where the most important buildings of the city were built. The building of the Town Hall supplied the square with arches that were used as protection from the sun or rain, in this way it was the hub of public life. The local prison was also located on the Town Hall's ground floor. Several streets reached the Pra√ßa, these linked the urban core with the suburbs and were used by travelers from neighboring cities and towns, such as Barcelos, Braga, Guimar√£es, and Vila do Conde. Thus, with this conjugation of religious, administrative and commercial factors the Pra√ßa was a busy place. =18th-century developments= The Town Hall was rebuilt in 1713, when the Pra√ßa still had a wide square. Lieutenant Francisco Felix da Veiga Leal said in 1758 \\"P√≥voa de Varzim has a very good town hall with the town's coat of arms painted on the ceiling of the hearing room. These same coat of arms are used in its senate standard ... and on the outside wall the Royal coat of arms are located. And this house is formed over six arches with its casing, and below it the bars of the two prison cells.\\" On February 18, 1743, the building of the new First Church of P√≥voa de Varzim near the town hall was started, revealing the alliance between the Povoan Town Hall and the Archdiocese of Braga. This was useful in the territorial disputes that the town had with the House of Bragan√ßa, specifically its Town of Barcelos. The Town Hall was part of the First Church Commission and developed efforts for the maintenance and enlargement of the old first church, the Church of Santa Maria de Varzim, as well as for the construction of the new one. It enjoyed special privileges granted by the Braga archbishops: the judge of the Town Hall was also judge of the church. In 1610, these privileges had already become entrenched in tradition and were respected, even if they were against the orders (Cap√≠tulos) emanating from the archdiocese. The new church opened to the public on January 6, 1757. It was of a large size and high artistic value for such a small, but growing, community. With the new church, the parochial community expanded to include nearby parishes such as Terroso and Amorim, where there were only very small chapels. After the building of the new church, the Pra√ßa became quadrangular in shape and was diminished in size, not only because of the church but also due to other buildings that had been constructed. =The 1791 Royal Provision and decline = By the end of the 18th century, it was apparent that the Town Hall, which was also a judiciary court and a prison, was too small for the expanding town. With the Royal Provision, made by Queen Mary I in 1791, the Pra√ßa Nova (the \\"New Square\\") was created with a larger town hall. The old town hall was given new functions and its style was modified with time. By the late 19th century, the Madre Deus chapel was demolished for street enlargement. The importance of the Pra√ßa as the civic, economic and political center started to be broken down after the 1791 Royal Provision which restructured the urban arrangement of P√≥voa de Varzim and relocated the municipal powers to the new square.

The term aimed to mobilize the people and resources under Kuomintang's control to fight with the Communist Party of China rebellion. The term was announced in July 1947 by Chiang Kai-shek, the chairman of the Nationalist Government, as an administrative order. As the situations worsen by time, it was then turned into a constitutional amendment named Temporary Provisions against the Communist Rebellion () on May 10, 1948. With the progression Chinese Communist Revolution, the Temporary Provisions were no longer valid in most of the Chinese territory after the Communist's armed forces expelled the Kuomintang's armed forces.

The Provisional Act is provided to the then President Chiang Kai-shek extended powers to mobilize against the CCP.

By the end of 1949, the Communist Party of China have founded the People's Republic of China and controlled almost the whole mainland China. Thus Temporary Provisions is no longer enforced except some small piece of territory that is still controlled by the Kuomintang, notably the following territories that is transferred after 1949 * Hainan: ROC government lost control after the Landing Operation on Hainan Island in May 1950. * Some offshore islands of Chekiang: ROC government lost control after the Battle of Yijiangshan Islands in January 1955. = Kinmen and Matsu = Kinmen and Matsu Islands is part of the traditional Fujian and was declared as Alert Zone in the first Declaration of Nationwide Martial Law on December 10, 1948. Then, they were moved to the War Zone in the second Declaration of Nationwide Martial Law on July 7, 1949. With the government of the Republic of China's retreat to Taiwan, the islands became the frontier between the administration of Taiwan and China. Several battles happened in Kinmen in the 1950s. The government of the Republic of China in Taipei enforced the War Zone Administration in Kinmen and Matsu Islands since 1956. Under this special decree, the civil Fujian Provincial Government was replaced by the military defense commands in Kinmen and Matsu Islands. Kinmen County Government, Lienchiang County Government and other field offices of the central government were all placed under the control of the military defense commands in the two places. The War Zone Administrations existed even after the temporary provisions was repealed in May 1991. Kinmen and Matsu experienced the longest period of military control under the period of mobilization for the suppression of Communist rebellion from 1948 to November 1992. = Taiwan and Penghu = Taiwan was under Japanese rule before 1945.

The Administration for Soviet Property in Austria, or the USIA () was formed in the Soviet zone of Allied-occupied Austria in June 1946 and operated until the withdrawal of Soviet troops in 1955. USIA operated as a de facto state corporation and controlled over four hundred expropriated Austrian factories, transportation and trading companies. USIA assets included formerly independent Austrian companies (√ñAF), factories once owned by German corporations (AEG) and former SS enterprises (DEST). At its peak in 1951 the conglomerate employed around 60 thousand people,Bishof et al., p. 75. or 10% of Austrian industrial labor.Bader, p. 153. USIA was exempt from Austrian tariffs, disregarded Austrian taxation, and could easily trade with Eastern Europe despite the Iron Curtain and Western trade embargoes. The extraterritorial corporation attempted to be self-sufficient and was very weakly integrated with the rest of Austrian economy.Bishof et al., p. 126. Establishment Occupation of Germany and Austria by the Soviet troops was followed by large-scale dismantling of former German equipment which was shipped to the Soviet Union as war reparations. Austria lost, in 1951 dollars, 200 million dollars' worth of German industrial properties (out of total 1.5 billion). Plunder continued until the early summer of 1946, when the Soviet policy changed from taking Austrian assets to managing them for a profit.Bischof et al., p. 74. The Soviet Department for Investigation of German Properties compiled an inventory of remaining industrial assets in the Soviet zone (Lower Austria, Burgenland and eastern districts of Upper Austria). June 27, 1945, the Soviet command transformed this Department into the Administration for Soviet Property in Eastern Austria (USIVA) and placed all industrial assets under its control. In 1947 the name was shortened to USIA. Its internal structure mimicked that of the Soviet cabinet, with nine divisions paralleling nine ministries of industries.Bader, pp. 124-127, provides a step-by-step analysis of the events of 1946. No less than eleven ministries in Moscow had a say in USIA affairs.Bischof et al., p. 79. Only one-tenth of USIA assets were, indeed, German.Bischof et al. p. 76; Bader, p. 124. Others were historically Austrian properties, expropriated with ludicrous explanations or with no explanations at all. Expropriation of lands of the House of Esterh√°zy was \\"justified\\" because, according to the Soviets, the knighthood of the Holy Roman Empire conferred in 1806 qualified Esterh√°zy as Germans rather than Austrians. Austrian government was forced to accept the fact but refused to legalize the expropriations through records in land and corporate registers. The Soviets used this refusal as a pretext for not paying Austrian taxes.Bischof et al., pp.77-78. Exact number of businesses under USIA control is subject to different interpretations. According to Austrian 1955 sources, there were 419 enterprises, of them 300 in the industry. A different source named 160 enterprises in 1954 (excluding the oil fields, transportation companies and trading outlets). The Soviets also operated Soviet Military Bank (SMB) which evolved from the Red Army field treasury. It tried to obtain an Austrian banking license but the government denied it in fear of Soviet influence over Austrian finances.Bischog et al, p. 79. The number of employees varied from 22 thousand in 1946 to a peak of 60 thousand in 1951 and down to 36 thousand in 1955. A disproportionately high share of USIA staff were Austrian Communists, especially after the 1950 Austrian general strikes, when communists were fired en masse from non-USIA businesses. The strikes of the 1950s were powered by organized pro-communist workers of the USIA factories in the Soviet sector of Vienna. The Soviets, however, placed business interests above \\"class unity\\" with Austrian Communists.Bader, p. 157. According to Hugo Portisch, Soviet representatives in Austria were split over the 1950 strikes: some saw an opportunity to suppress the Western influence, while the USIA management had to meet production targets and opposed any disruption in the Soviet zone. Portisch wrote that Moscow intervened to defuse the situation and denied support to Austrian Communists.Williams, pp. 133-134. Operations USIA was initially managed by Red Army staff; since 1949 they were replaced by trained industrial managers. The organization was governed by a chief executive with three assistants for political, personnel, and commercial matters. USIA chiefs, on average, served two years before replacement. Over nine years of its history USIA had five chiefs, SMV (Soviet oil enterprise) had four chairmen, etc. At first the Soviets intended to integrate USIA enterprises into their own economy, but the futility of such and exercise soon became evident and they admitted the need to cooperate with the rest of Austrian economy.Bischof et al., p. 80. USIA accounted for only 5% of national Austrian output and 30% of the Soviet zone output, but possessed significant or even monopolistic share is some industries: 60% in glass making, 43% in leather, 40% in iron and steel etc.Bischof et al., p. 76. The governments of Austria and the United States, anxious about Soviet influence, invested Marshall Plan funds into competing businesses outside of the Soviet zone and the USIA monopolists gradually lost their advantage. The Soviets had no intention to invest their own funds into Austria, the sole exception being the oil fields in Lower Austria. As a result, Soviet-occupied territories lagged behind the rest of Austria in economic growth,Bishof et al., pp. 125, 81; Bader, p. 119. their plant and equipment soon became \\"very much substandard for Austria\\".Bischof et al., pp. 82-83. Some USIA-ran Austrian companies, fed up with Soviet control, simply moved their personnel and operations to the West, leaving the Soviets with empty shells (as was the case of Porr AG).Bischof et al., p. 84. According to an investigation of USIA business in 1946‚Äì1955, 20% of its products were traded and consumed within USIA, 38% sold to Eastern Europe, 42% sold to non-USIA Austrian customers, and only 1% to Western European customers. The United States suppressed USIA operations through a \\"neutralization plan\\" devised in 1947. An embargo imposed by the United States on exports behind the Iron Curtain prohibited other Austrian businesses from selling their products to USIA, unless it guaranteed that the finished products will stay in Austria. Dealing with USIA, when allowed by the West, was problematic because valid legal title could not be enforced.Bischof et al., p. 78. Vienna City Hall informally banned municipal purchases of USIA products.Bischof et al., p. 83. Marshall Plan money was deliberately deployed against USIA interests.Bischof et al., p. 82. Despite these problems USIA had a crucial and unfair competitive advantage. It was exempt of Austrian customs and foreign trade regulations. It routinely disregarded and evaded Austrian taxes and its trucking arm engaged in outright smuggling.Bischof et al., pp. 78, 84. USIA products easily moved across the Iron Curtain, and could be sold at a profit and below fair market prices inside Austria. USIA retail shops in Vienna traded below market and were frequented by many Americans of modest means.Bader, p. 125. USIA operations declined since 1951. Between 1951 and 1955, over a hundred of its enterprises were shut down or merged. In 1955 Austria became an independent state and the Soviet Union withdrew its troops. The assets of USIA were sold to the Austrian government for 150 million US dollars, paid with goods over six years. The oil fields were subject to a separate agreement, which cost the Austrians around 200 million dollars. All written documentation of USIA disappeared. USIA profits withdrawn by the Soviets from Austrian economy, including the final payment agreed in the Austrian State Treaty, are estimated at 1.072 billion U.S. dollars. Estimates of Soviet reparations in total range from 1.547 to 2.647 billion U.S. dollars. Per capita, Austria paid more reparations than any other Axis state or territory.Bischof et al., p. 85. Soviet rule over the economy of Eastern Austria left a deep and lasting impression on the Austrians. The 1958 \\"Final Report\\" on USIA activities concluded that the sole purpose of USIA was \\"to exploit Austria's natural and human resources as possibly and systematically as possible ... exploitation in colonial style amid a highly developed European economy, the extent and economic success of which are astounding ... This economic enclave of the occupation economy in Austria was used to fortify the economic potential of its bloc, to pursue its political objectives and, finally, to function as an economic bridge positioned directly opposite Western Austria and the Western World as a whole.\\"As cited in Bischof et al., pp. 76-77.

Like many other genera within the Muricidae, the genus has been redefined several times. Ponder & Vokes (1988) and Vokes (1990) included American and Indo-Pacific species in Haustellum, which differs from Murex sensu stricto by lacking a labral spine. Petuch (1994) introduced Vokesimurex for the American long-canalled Haustellum sensu Vokes (1990), such as Murex messorius Sowerby, 1841. Houart (1999) transferred 14 Indo-Pacific species and three subspecies of Haustellum in the genus Vokesimurex. As currently defined, Haustellum is represented by eight to nine species. Members of Haustellum generally differ from those of Vokesimurex in having a globose and low-spired shape, a more rounded aperture, a smooth columella, a less deep anal notch, and no cord spine.

The siphonal canal is rather short, curved to the left, fused at the top and almost sealed below. They have six to seven well-developed varices per whorl, with deep hollows at the sutures. These varices extend from the shoulder margin to the tip of the siphonal canal and become twisted at the base of the shell. The deflection of the varices at the top of the shoulder of each whorl gives rise to a small pointed spine pointing to the preceding varix.A.

He had previously (1994‚Äì1995) described Habromorula as a separate genus, containing 14 species that were earlier classified with Spinidrupa sensu lato. BHL: info digitised copy of printed article In 2004, he placed Azumamorula, Oppomorus, and Habromorula into Morula as subgenera, and moved the whole group from subfamily Rapaninae to Ergalataxinae. = Molecular genetics = In 2012‚Äì2013, Claremont et al. published a study of sequences for four genes across numerous species of Morula and related molluscs. They found a clade of 11 species, and proposed a restricted definition of Morula to include: M. aspera, M. benedicta, M. (Habromorula) biconica, M. chrysostoma, M. (H.) coronata, M. (H.) japonica, M. nodicostata, M. (H.) spinosa, M. (H.) striata, M. uva (type species), and M. zebrina. Habromorula did not form a clade in this analysis, however the authors noted that \\"monophyly of this morphologically distinctive group is not strongly contradicted, so that further sampling and analysis could yet support Habromorula as a monophyletic subgenus of Morula\\". Subgenus Morula (Oppomorus) formed a separate clade; the authors proposed returning Oppomorus to genus level, containing O. nodulifera, O. funiculata and O. purpureocincta. M. ceylonica, M. granulata, M. marginalba, M. musiva, and an undescribed species formed a distinct clade related to Muricodrupa. The authors proposed resurrecting the genus name Tenguella, for which T. granulata is the type species. They note that these species \\"have not previously been recognized as a morphologically distinctive group\\". \\"Morula\\" anaxares was weakly related to Muricodrupa fenestrata, and \\"Morula\\" nodulosa was sister to the Tenguella‚ÄìMuricodrupa group. \\"Morula\\" parva and \\"Morula\\" echinata placed in a third major clade, separate from the two that contain Tenguella and the main Morula group, respectively. In response to the gene-sequence phylogeny, Houart, Zuccon and Puillandre formally described new genera in 2019: Claremontiella, Murichorda, and Lauta. C. nodulosa, C. consanguinea, Mur. rumphiusi, and L. parva were previously in Morula. They also moved Morula anaxares to Muricodrupa anaxares, and reassigned M. palmeri to Pascula, the latter on basis of morphology rather than gene sequence.

As a result, in 2019 Houart et al. proposed renaming Morula anaxares to Muricodrupa anaxares, and removing M. fiscellum and M. jacobsoni to a new genus Murichorda. Muricodrupa as redefined is related to a group of former Morula species now called Tenguella.

Taxonomy The history of the name Nassa is rather confused, because the name was allocated twice: * Nassa R√∂ding, 1798 for mainly muricid species with the type species : Nassa picta R√∂ding, 1798 (= Nassa serta (Brugui√®re, 1798). * Nassa Lamarck, 1799 : established for the species Buccinum mutabile Linnaeus, 1758, which is now classified as a synonym of Nassarius Dum√©ril, 1805 in the family Nassariidae. In the 19th and much of the 20th century, all species that were added to the genus Nassa were Nassa mud snails belonging to the family Nassariidae.
