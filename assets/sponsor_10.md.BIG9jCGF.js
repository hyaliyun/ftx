The Minoan Fountain was a monumental public fountain hewn directly from the natural rock.

The fountainhouse formalized the use of the sacred spring, and was dedicated to the Cult of the Nymphs.  Description  In the 6th century BC, the fountain was covered by a square building with a hipped roof and walls on three sides. It was built with regular courses of granite and gneiss. A monumental fa√ßade on the south side gave access to the fountain through a portico lined with small Doric columns. Nine steps led down to the level of the water. A thin Doric column stood on the third lowest step to further support the roof.Hadjidakis, P.J. Delos. Eurobank Ergasias, 2003. The column remains standing, and the spring still fills with water.  Decoration  When repairs were conducted in the mid-2nd century BC, the fountainhouse was decorated with a fresco of a river god with three nymphs.

According to NIRC, in 2016 there were 1,390 trade unions with registered 1.4 million members. There are 16 registered federations and the ratio of total union members to total employment is 2.2%.  History  The early history of trade unions in the country traces its foundation in British India. After its inception, Pakistan has inherited strong railways and port unions. Popular labor unions at that time were in Lahore Railway Workshop, led by Mirza Ibrahim, Hydro-Electric Central Labor Union, led by Bashir Bakhtiar and the Komal Flour Mill, Ganesh Khopra (Coconut) Mill in Sindh which was organized by Narain Das. Founder of Pakistan Muhammad Ali Jinnah was also a labour leader, he was elected President of All India Postal Staff Union in 1925. The rise of trade union struggle was seen during 1968 movement in Pakistan, when leaders of major unions and federation joined hands against Ayub Khan in first week of March they organized March as the workers' \\"demands week\\". As an aftermath of 1988 elections, Benazir Bhutto came into power, during power she under pressure from the World Bank and IMF she adopted privatization policies which were continued by Nawaz Sharif. Owing to this liberation process, contractual labour was introduced which reduced bargaining power of unions. During Pervez Musharraf period, struggle of the PTCL workers against privatization attracted many activists to form alliances. Labour laws relating to trade unions or the Industrial Relations Act 2012 do not enable workers to form unions. There is also very little room for those who are already organized in trade unions to bargain for the collective rights of workers.

It was built from 1887 to 1892. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  History  The main house was erected between 1887 and 1892 as a country retreat for a Sydney judge of the Supreme Court of New South Wales, Sir William Owen. It was built on the slope of what became known as Judge's Hill, in the Tudor Revival style. In 1889 Whitley was subdivided and Oldbury Road was formed around Mount Gingenbullen (prior to this Oldbury was reached along Golden Vale Road and Atkinson's Lane from Sutton Forest).Cavanough et al, 1988, 82-3 The Owens and Heneys were responsible for the garden's early planting, and the Owens, who came from Shropshire in England, probably planted the hawthorn hedges. The oaks and elms, as evidenced by the 1896 photographs, must now be approaching ninety years of age. It remained in the ownership of the Owen family until 1914, when it was purchased by Thomas William Heney, who in 1903 had become the first Australian editor of the Sydney Morning Herald. Heney befriended many young artists, including Ellis Rowan and Elioth Gruner. Gruner came to live at Whitley as a friend of the family. Heney cultivated native plants in the garden and also collected Australian semi-precious stones. In 1941 the house was purchased by Edward Dryland Hordern, eldest son of Edward Carr Hordern of Wensleydale at Colo Vale. Edward was of the retailing firm Hordern Brothers in Sydney. He owned Whitley until 1947, after which the house passed through several hands until being acquired by John & Robyn Hawkins in 1980. The oaks and elms, as evidenced in the 1896 photographs, must now be approaching 120 years of age (2018). The hedges were \\"laid\\" in the traditional English fashion in 1983 and again in 1986 by Mark Fowles, the champion hedge layer of England, from Bridgnorth in Shropshire. The plane tree (Platanus x hybrida) on the entrance lawn replaced a cherry planted by Edward Hordern about 1930. The garden now serves as a setting for Haddonstone garden ornaments, and the design and layout in its present form is the work of Robyn Hawkins, with the help of local nurserymen and horticulturists.Cavanough et al, 1988, 50, 83 Several alterations have been made over the years, including the construction and later enclosure in timber shingling (s) of wing extensions to the east and west. It is one of these wings that is to be altered to allow the proposed extension. It was listed for sale in 1998, and in 1999, a 10-hectare holding, known as \\"The Dairy\\", was sold off. In 2002, Whitley was purchased by author Jenny Ferguson and her investment banker husband Rob for approximately $6 million. In July 2006, they reacquired \\"The Dairy\\" holding.SMH, 2006McIntosh, 2007 The Fergusons opened the gardens to the public on occasion for twenty years, ceasing in 2012.  Description  =Buildings= The group consists of: * the main house, outbuildings and main entrance gates; and * the garden Other items include: * a modern brick and timber garage/stables building * coach house and other outbuildings. Whitley is a large, two storey house with face brickwork to ground floor level in the manner of Victorian Elizabethan/Tudor Revival. The steeply pitched, multi gabled roof is clad with imported French Marseilles tiles. The numerous externally featured chimneys are finished with \\"rough cast\\" render. A picturesque, timber framed, gabled porch shelters the main entrance. On the northeast elevation is a larger flat roofed \\"verandah\\" featuring squat Tuscan style columns supported on a brick balustrade wall. Windows to the main elevations are timber framed casements and 2 x 2 pane double hung sashes. Internally the major feature is an elaborate timber stair of 4 flights (which return on itself). Several alterations have been made over the years, including the construction and later enclosure in timber shingling (s) of wing extensions to the east and west. It is one of these wings that is to be altered to allow the proposed extension. The coachhouse/stables complex is located well away from the house and screened by mature hawthorn (Crataegus oxycantha) laid hedges and other planting. The adjacent outbuildings - including a brickwork (former Groomsman's) cottage, general purpose outbuildings and coach house - are all of face brickwork with rendered and half timbered components and steeply pitched gabled roofs matching the main house. A recent addition - an \\"L\\" shaped garage/stables building in face brickwork with terracotta tiled roof (a shallow gable) - links the various outbuildings. The entrance gates to the main drive comprise large squat face brick piers with rendered ball mouldings flanked by semi-circular dwarf walls ending in rendered ball mouldings. The present modern steel gates replace earlier timber gates. =Grounds and garden= Whitley has a mature garden estate setting for its building group. The garden's other aspects include the use of statues and small built elements. The garden is open, by invitation, to horticulture and garden history groups. The planting pattern is a feature. As you enter the gates, the bright green hedge is leyland cypress (Cuprocyparis leylandii 'Leighton's Green'). Most other hedges are hawthorn (Crataegus oxycantha). On the circular front lawn is a beech (Fagus sylvatica) hedge, and a standard weeping elm (Ulmus scabra 'Pendula'). A hybrid plane tree (Platanus x hybrida) is on the circular lawn. There is a formal rose garden with a Haddonstone centre piece and bordered by Japanese yew (Cephalotaxus harringtonii). Nearby a grove of silver birch (Betula pendula) underplanted with blue bells. Crab-apples (Malus sp./cv.s) form a walk from the tennis- court. A large sloping flower bed below the terrace is cleverly planted with paeonies (Paeonia suffruticosa cv.s), viburnums, rhododendrons, and purple smoke bush (Cotinus coggygria \\"Purpurea\\". Rugosa roses (Rosa rugosa cv.s) form a bank below the terrace, below is \\"Nevada\\", others are \\"Alba\\" and 'L'Hay'. \\"Guinea\\" (a dark red rose) grows on the main pergola. Near the pond are two willow-leafed pear trees (Pyrus salicifolia 'Pendula') and behind the temple at the back of the pool is a semicircle of maidenhair tree (Ginkgo biloba). Many fine old trees are growing on the hill above the house - Monterey cypress (Cupressus macrocarpa), English elms (Ulmus procera), Himalayan cedars (Cedrus deodara) and some olives Olea europaea var. europaea cv.). The garden of Whitley has been immaculately reconstructed, but bears no resemblance to the garden first created there.Cavanough et al, 1988, 75  Heritage listing  Whitley is significant as it illustrates the historical development of the Sutton Forest and wider Southern Highlands area as the choice location for wealthy and socially prominent families to build their country retreats in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. As an example of Tudor Revival architecture within an Australian context, it demonstrates the overwhelming influence of British \\"English Countryside\\" architecture within Australia especially until the turn of the 20th century. By way of their ownership of the residence, it is associated with prominent people such as the Hon. Judge William Owen; Thomas William Heney, first Australian born editor of the Sydney Morning Herald, and Edward Dryland Hordern of the prominent Hordern family of retailers. Whitley is also significant in that it exemplifies the Tudor Revival architectural style as it was applied in Australia in the late 19th century to a residence constructed for the Hon. Judge Owens as a gentleman's retreat in the Southern Highlands south of Sydney. It has certain key elements of this style such as the half timbering on the upper level of the house. It has landmark qualities due to its position on Mount Gingenbullen and its outstanding garden setting fashioned on the English pleasure ground model including hedges, trees, forest, lily pond, summer house and a commanding view of the surrounding countryside. Whitley contributes to the identity of the Southern Highlands as an area characterised by grand residences situated on large estates that are still favoured by the wealthy and /or socially prominent as country summer or weekend retreats. Although it forms part of a group of large highland country retreats, Whitley's Tudor Revival architectural style is distinctive in the area and therefore may contain evidence that is relevant to further understanding the area's cultural history. Whitley is a good example of the group of large country houses within the Southern Highlands region that were built as gentlemen's residences in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, but is rare in that it is the only example among this group that was constructed in the Tudor Revival style.Rappoport, 2003, 31 The Whitley Group is significant within the local area and region as a substantial and picturesquely located property, representative of the important group of large country residences built in the 1880s and 90s by prominent Sydney families which established the social character of the Bowral-Moss Vale-Sutton Forest area and contributed to the development of the area as a place for rural retreats. The property as a whole with its mature tree plantings and hedges is also significant because of its aesthetic qualities which contribute to the character of the distinctive rural landscape of the Mt Gingenbullen slopes. Whitley was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.

In 394 BCE, the Scotussaei joined the other Thessalians in opposing the march of Spartan king Agesilaus II through their country. In 367 BCE, Scotussa was treacherously seized by Alexander of Pherae, tyrant of the neighbouring town of Pherae. In the territory of Scotussa were the hills called Cynoscephalae, which are memorable as the scene of two battles, one fought in 364 BCE, between the Thebans and Alexander of Pherae, in which Pelopidas was slain, and the other, of still greater celebrity, fought in 197 BCE, in which Philip V of Macedon was defeated by the Roman consul Titus Quinctius Flamininus. In 191 BCE Scotussa surrendered to Antiochus III, but was recovered shortly afterwards, along with Pharsalus and Pherae, by the consul Manius Acilius Glabrio.

The Revolutionary Government of the Armed Forces was led by Juan Velasco Alvarado.  Coup d'etat  In 1968 the Ej√©rcito del Per√∫ led by Juan Velasco Alvarado led a Coup d'etat against President Fernando Belaunde's government. The end result was that Velasco's forces took power in 1968 and shifted more to a soviet style dictatorship.  Military revolution and dictatorship (1968‚Äì1975)  The coup leaders named their administration the Revolutionary Government of the Armed Forces, with Velasco at its helm as President. Velasco's administration articulated a desire to give justice to the poor through a regime of nationalization known as Peruanismo. Velasco's rule was characterized by left- leaning policies, which aimed to create a strong national industry to increase the international independence of Peru. To that end, he nationalised entire industries, expropriated companies in a wide range of activities from fisheries to mining to telecommunications to power production and consolidated them into single industry-centric government-run entities (PescaPeru, MineroPeru, Petroper√∫, SiderPeru,Centromin Peru, ElectroPeru, Enapu, EnatruPeru, Enafer, Compa√±ia Peruana de Telefonos, EntelPeru, Correos del Peru, etc.), and increased government control over economic activity by enforcing those entities as monopolies and disincentivized private activity in those sectors. Most reforms were planned by left-leaning intellectuals of the time, and some of them successfully improved the Peruvian quality of life. A root and branch education reform was in march looking to include all Peruvians and move them towards to a new national thinking and feeling; the poor and the most excluded were prioritized in this system and the D√≠a del Indio or Peruvian Indian's day name was changed to D√≠a del Campesino or Peruvian Peasant's day every June 24, a traditional holiday of the land, the day of winter solstice. The education reform of 1972 provided for bilingual education for the indigenous people of the Andes and the Amazon, which consisted nearly half of the population. In 1975, the Velasco government enacted a law making Quechua an official language of Peru equal to Spanish. Thus, Peru was the first Latin American country to officialize an indigenous language. However, this law was never enforced and ceased to be valid when the 1979 constitution became effective, according to which Quechua and Aymara are official only where they predominate, as mandated by law ‚Äì a law that was never enacted.David Brisson: Quechua Education in Peru. The Theory-Context Mergence Approach, pp. 13‚Äì14. Peruanismo was also characterized by authoritarianism, as the administration grew away from tolerating any level of dissent, periodically jailing, deporting and harassing suspected political opponents and repeatedly closing and censoring broadcast and print news media, finally expropriating all of the newspapers in 1974 and sending the publishers into exile. A cornerstone of Velasco's political and economic strategy was the implementation by dictate of an agrarian reform program to expropriate farms and diversify land ownership. In its first ten years in power, the Revolutionary Government of the Armed Forces (GRFA) expropriated 15,000 properties (totaling nine million hectares) and benefited some 300,000 families.Enrique Mayer, Ugly Stories of the Peruvian Agrarian Reform. Durham: Duke University Press, 2009. The former landlords who opposed this program believed that they did not receive adequate compensation for their confiscated assets and lamented that the state officials and peasant beneficiaries mismanaged their properties after the expropriation.Enrique Mayer, Ugly Stories of the Peruvian Agrarian Reform. Durham:Duke University Press, 2009.  Foreign Relations  In foreign policy, in contrast with his 1970s Latin American contemporaries, which were mostly right-wing military dictatorships, Velasco pursued a partnership with communist countries, beginning with Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia.Walter, Richard J. Peru and the United States, 1960-1975: How Their Ambassadors Managed Foreign Relations in a Turbulent Era. Pennsylvania State University Press, 2010. By 1969 he established warm relations with the Soviet bloc, tightening relations with Cuba and Fidel Castro as well as Romania and Nicolae Ceau»ôescu and undertaking major purchases of Soviet military hardware. Velasco was greatly influenced by socialist Yugoslavia's policies of self-management and worked with Yugoslav economist Edvard Kardelj to help implement similar policies in Peru. Yugoslavia aided the Junta financially and diplomatically, and the two nations remained close allies.Kasza, Gregory James. The Conscription Society: Administered Mass Organizations. Yale University Press, 1995. Relations between the United States and Peru were tense and even hostile, as soon as General Velasco and his junta took power. Just five days after Velasco seized power in 1968, the General began the nationalization of the Peruvian Economy with the expropriation and nationalization of the American International Petroleum Company (IPC) oil fields located in the northern Peruvian oil port and refinery of Talara, Piura, near the Peruvian border with Ecuador, Piura, being the region where Velasco was born. IPC was a subsidiary of Standard Oil, and although the claims over the IPC were ultimately resolved in negotiations between the two governments, the US after this seizure no longer considered Peru an ally or a friendly country. Instead, the CIA started to organize plans to destabilize and to overthrow General Velasco. US-Peru disagreements continued over a broad range of issues including even Peru's claim to a fishing limit that resulted in the seizure of several US commercial fishing boats and the expropriation of the American copper mining company Cerro de Pasco Corporation. However, in spite of these provocations, the U.S. responded immediately with humanitarian aid in 1970, when an earthquake killed about 50,000 persons and left over 600,000 homeless.

KISSINGER, HENRY According to various sources Velasco's government bought between 600 and 1200 T-55 Main Battle Tanks, APCs, 60 to 90 Sukhoi 22 warplanes, 500,000 assault rifles, and even considered the purchase of a British carrier Centaur-class light fleet carrier HMS Bulwark.

It was originally published by Basic Books in 2015, with an updated version published in 2016. In the work, Sowell argues against the notion that economic equality is natural, and examines geographic, cultural, social, and political factors that have contributed to the wealth of groups and nations. Reception In a review for The Independent Review, Gary M. Galles of Pepperdine University stated that Sowell \\"thinks carefully and creatively through widely held premises and the narratives they support, bolstering his analysis with a vast array of evidence that offers insights for the intellectually curious\\". Galles argued that the author is effective in showing how \\"massive variations in access to ideas and culture, as well as goods and services, overwhelm any expectation of equality of productivity\\". In The Washington Times, Wes Vernon lauded the book as a \\"calmly phrased but damning indictment\\", praising Sowell's \\"mountains of research\\" as disproving opposing arguments. A reviewer for Publishers Weekly wrote, \\"Open-minded readers will find Sowell‚Äôs directness, honesty, and common sense refreshing and often wise.\\" Walter E. Williams gave the 2016 updated edition a positive review, particularly praising the discussion of earnings differences. A writer for Kirkus Reviews wrote that Sowell's \\"implied argument that cultural considerations must inform any serious attempt at improving the economic prospects of an underperforming nation or group merits serious consideration\\". Despite saying that Sowell too often downplays factors that don't support his conservatism, the reviewer also said that Sowell \\"raises many inconvenient facts that should trouble advocates of diversity and cultural relativism, and he effectively refutes progressives' excuses for why their approaches to eliminating poverty have too often produced government dependence and social breakdown.\\" Not all reviews were positive. In The Washington Post, Steven Pearlstein argued that Sowell's pinning of the blame for black poverty on multiculturalism and welfare is unconvincing, and added that \\"ghetto culture\\" cannot explain the problems in white America. Pearlstein wrote that the book \\"is filled with such instances of overreach\\" and stated, \\"What we [...] learn from Wealth, Poverty and Politics is that there is apparently no level of inequality of income or opportunity that Thomas Sowell would consider unacceptable.\\" Sowell himself denied accepting unequal opportunity in a Townhall response to Pearlstein. Reihan Salam of National Review criticized Sowell's view on the chief obstacles facing poor native-born blacks, suggesting that their problems \\"can be explained at least in part by the failure of governments to protect African Americans from violence. For much of U.S. history, officialdom turned a blind eye to 'black-on-black' violence, which in effect meant that predators routinely got away with murder\\".

Himmelberg broke his leg, which stopped him from attending the AFL Draft Combine, and missed the rest of the 2016 season. He was involved with the Lions Academy but was not eligible for exclusive selection in the 2016 AFL draft because he had not spent enough time in Queensland. Himmelberg was selected by Adelaide with pick 51 in the 2016 national draft, their third selection. In 2017, Himmelberg played 13 South Australian National Football League (SANFL) games, kicking 19 goals, including four in round 12 against the Port Adelaide Magpies. He suffered a foot injury in July which kept him out for the remainder of the season. In 2018, Himmelberg signed a two-year contract extension, tying him to Adelaide until 2020. He was named in the Adelaide squad for the inaugural AFLX tournament, and as an emergency for the JLT Community Series. He played more often as a ruckman in the SANFL, as fellow key-position players Paul Hunter and Reilly O'Brien suffered injuries. Himmelberg made his AFL debut in round 23 against Carlton at Docklands Stadium. He recorded 13 disposals and five marks, and kicked his first goal with a banana shot.

Much of her work focuses on indigenous feminism and the sovereignty and self determination of indigenous peoples. Her work takes a transnational approach, making connections between and across the borders of countries. Barker makes historical and scholarly connections between the oppression and resistance of marginalized communities. An example of this transnational approach can be seen by the work that Barker has done to show connections in the struggles of Palestinians in Israel and indigenous communities in the United States.  Education and career  Joanne Barker received her PhD in the History of Consciousness Department from the University of California, Santa Cruz, in 2000 where she specialized in indigenous jurisprudence, women's/gender studies, and cultural studies. Barker is a professor of American Indian Studies at San Francisco State University. = Activism = In her work as an advocate for Native Americans, Barker has drawn connections between the oppression of Native American communities in the United States of America and Palestinians. She began drawing parallels between the two groups of peoples after a 2014 delegation trip to Israel, where Palestinian activist Leila Khaled \\"defined solidarity as a strategy of connecting struggles of the people in the U.S. against U.S. imperialism and colonialism to the struggles of Palestinians against Israel\\". Barker also advocates for cultural repatriation rights, human rights, anti-war politics, and environmental issues. With environmental issues, Barker specifically focused on energy policies and conservation issues in relation to indigenous tribes in California. She covers some of her advocacy in her blog, Tequila Sovereign, where she also discusses current events, her scholarship, and artwork.

She has made the majority of her published work available to the public through her Academia.edu account. Her forthcoming book, The Red Scare: The Empire's Indigenous Terrorist, is contracted through University of California Press, but not published. In this book she will be exploring the ways that racist and misogynist representations of indigenous people cause them to be seen as \\"terrorists,\\" and a threat to the social order of the United States of America and Canada. Barker is the editor of Critically Sovereign: Indigenous Gender, Sexuality, and Feminist Studies. The essays in this book deal with the overarching theme of the ways that gender is an inextricable part of colonialism and imperialism within the United States and Canada. Throughout this book there are also discussions of the role that gender, sexuality and feminism play in movements towards indigenous sovereignty. This book was published in 2017 through Durham and London: Duke University Press. Native Acts: Law, Recognition, and Cultural Authenticity was published in 2011 by Durham and London: Duke University Press. In this book, Barker discusses the way that indigenous people must look and act in certain ways to earn federal recognition from the United States. Barker argues that these acts of \\"cultural authenticity\\" often reproduce social injustices (racism, homophobia, sexism, etc.) that are fundamental to American nationalism. Barker edited the book Sovereignty Matters: Locations of Contestation and Possibility in Indigenous Struggles for Self-Determination, which was published in 2005 by Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press. This book is a collection of essays by indigenous people from the Americas and the Pacific Islands.

Photo taken on the corner of Arthur and Argyle Street. There is a train passing over the bridge at the moment this photo was taken.  The bridge in 2020. The Argyle Street railway bridge is a heritage-listed railway bridge on the Main Southern railway line (146.037 km) at Moss Vale, Wingecarribee Shire, New South Wales, Australia. It was designed and built by the New South Wales Government Railways in 1914 with steel supplied by Dorman Long of Middlesbrough, England. The property is owned by RailCorp, an agency of the Government of New South Wales. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  History  During the period from 1910 to 1923, the New South Wales Government Railways embarked on a large programme of railway duplications; on the Main South line from Picton to Cootamundra, on the Main Western line from Bowenfels to Orange, on the Main Northern line from Farley to Branxton and on the Illawarra line from Waterfall to Wollongong. The dominant structure for the underbridges was the brick arch in single spans and multiple span viaducts. Concurrently, there were brick arches on the Metropolitan Goods Lines. However, there were sites where brick arches were not appropriate and Argyle Street, Moss Vale, on the Main South, was one of them. When the original single track Main South line was built through Moss Vale in 1868, it crossed Argyle Street on a low-level timber beam bridge. In 1886 the Existing Lines Branch replaced the timber bridge with a wrought iron truss, still single track. When the duplications were planned around 1910 a new double track bridge was designed. It was to be at a higher level, clear span over Argyle Street. By then the change over from British to American bridge technology was complete and American style steel Pratt trusses were standard for large span railway bridges. A policy decision was made to build for the future with bridges designed to carry locomotives of double the current weight and for higher speeds. This avoided the expensive operation of frequent replacing of and relocating of inadequate bridges, as happened at Moss Vale when the 30-year old wrought iron truss was removed then rebuilt at Liverpool over the Georges River to serve the military area. The cost- effectiveness of the policy has been proved at Moss Vale, and many other sites, because the bridges are still in use carrying the modern heavy diesel locomotives with strings of heavy bulk wagons.  Description  The Argyle Street railway bridge is a large steel through Pratt truss bridge on a 40.54 m (133 feet) skew span with brick abutments and wing walls. It was reported to be in good condition as at 16 March 2006. The bridge retains its original fabric.  Heritage listing  The Argyle Street railway truss in Moss Vale is highly significant because it is an important item of infrastructure on the historic Main South Railway and has been in use for 85 years, it is a dominant feature of the Moss Vale townscape, it shares in the enormous social and commercial contribution that the Main South Railway has made to New South Wales and the bridge has technical significance because of it was one of the new heavy-duty trusses of the American style Pratt truss which had become standard for large span bridges. The skew design and construction adds to the technical significance. The skew construction is relatively rare for major bridges. The bridge is a highly visible and fine example of a heavy duty, steel Pratt truss bridge, which retains its original fabric. The Argyle Street railway bridge was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. The Argyle Street railway truss at Moss Vale is an important item of infrastructure on the historic Main South Railway and has been in use for 85 years. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. The bridge is a dominant feature of the Moss Vale townscape. The place has strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The Main South has brought enormous social and commercial benefits to south-western NSW, the Southern Highlands and Sydney for 130 years, and all infrastructure has shared In the significance of that outcome. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The bridge has technical significance because of it was one of the new heavy-duty trusses of the American style Pratt truss which had become standard for large span bridges. The skew design and construction adds to the technical significance. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. Skew bridges are relatively rare, particularly for major bridges where square crossing are preferred.

The Gaucho sheepdog is widely used for herding sheep and other livestock, especially in the southern region of Brazil.  History  The Gaucho Sheepdog was discovered in Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil by shepherds in search of dogs with better herding abilities. There are two theories for the origin of the breed. The older and more widespread theory argues that the Gaucho Sheepdog descends from herding dogs (unspecific breed) in Rio Grande do Sul. This theory is based on the physical and behavioral characteristics of the breed, as well as historical context. The breed bears similarities to the Border Collie and Rough Collie breeds that arrived with European settlers in the 19th and 20th century to herd farm animals such as cattle, horses, and sheep. The Border Collie likely arrived in the municipality of Uruguaiana in Rio Grande do Sul in the 1950s, along with a herd of Australian Merino sheep. Subsequently, these dogs were introduced in Pelotas city. The Rough Collies first arrived at the end of the 19th century with European immigrants, then later in the early 20th century. In addition to arriving with their European owners, this breed was also imported by farmers who wanted to modernize herd management techniques on their ranches. As a result of a recent historical, morphological, and behavioral study of the breed, a second origin theory developed. This hypothesis posits that the Gaucho Sheepdog descended from the herding dogs (unspecific breed) in the region, as well as the Rough Collie, Estrela Mountain Dog, and German Shepherd. Both theories conclude that the herding breeds, upon arriving in this region, underwent genetic selection. Dogs with sheep herding aptitude were bred selectively to meet demand from gaucho cowboys seeking herding dogs. A new breed emerged in a short time: the Gaucho Sheepdog, with a phenotype more adapted to the climate and geography of the region and a temperament more adapted to the needs of the local cowboys, maintaining an excellent aptitude for sheep herding.  Appearance  Morphologically, Gaucho Sheepdogs are similar to Border Collies, but they move differently when they are shepherding. Their size and height are medium, larger than Border Collies and a little bit smaller than Collies. Their coats are of moderate length, with or without an undercoat, in various colors. Temperament This breed is not known to be aggressive. Gaucho Sheepdogs are seen as good watchdog candidates since they are alert to strange noises, although they seldom attack intruders. They are smart dogs and learn commands quickly, and they are not aggressive with their herds. These dogs are known to co-exist happily with humans, as they are docile and friendly.

During the time of Bement‚Äôs missionary work, cultural customs strictly forbade male providers from caring for female patients. Bement helped fill this need and saw an average of 46 patients per day, and on some days, more than 70 patients. According to some records, Bement saw an average of 20,000 patients annually.  Early life  Lucy Permelia Bement was born in Dover Township (now called Westlake), Ohio and she, along with her sister Frances, attended a public primary school in West Dover, Ohio. The Bement sisters attended Sunday School in a small schoolhouse in the town and became members of the Second Congregational Church of Olmstead. Both sisters began high school in Elyria, Ohio in 1887. The father of the Bement sisters was Lorenzo C. Bement, the town postmaster who also owned a grocery store. The grocery store was located at what is today Wagner's County Inn.  Education  After graduating from high school, Bement worked with the American Missionary Association and taught at Pine Mountain, Tennessee. She then went to Massachusetts to attend the Training School for Nurses in Newburyport in 1893. After this, she attended Baltimore Medical College and received her degree in 1897. At the Baltimore Medical College, she was elected Vice President of the Medical Society. After graduation, she joined the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions.  Personal life  Census reports indicate that Bement was never married and had no children. When she retired from her missionary work in China, she split her time between her hometown in Ohio and Los Angeles, California. Her favorite hobby was tending to her flower garden. She maintained this hobby her entire life, even while working in Shaowu. In a letter home in 1914, Bement requested that a tulip or hyacinth bulb be sent to her, where they would be planted in a place of honor in the hospital yard.  Missionary work  = Work in Shaowu =  Journey to Shaowu  Bement and her sister, Frances, left the United States for Shaowu in 1898. According to a letter written by Frances, the trip from San Francisco to Shanghai took the sisters twenty-one days. Once in Shanghai, they waited three days for a coast steamer to take them to Foochow. After the sisters arrived in Foochow, China (now known as Fuzhou) they traveled two hundred and fifty miles up the Min River to the inland station. During the journey up the river, news of the foreign doctor's arrival traveled ahead of them, and hundreds of people lined the banks of the river to greet the Bement. Due to the large amount of supplies the boat was carrying, the journey took twenty-eight days. After leaving the river boat, the sisters walked and rode in sedan chairs until sunset when they reached Shaowu. Shaowu was a dangerous place for the sisters to work; several tigers were killed within approximately five miles of where they were staying. Furthermore Bement describes how a cobra was killed mere feet away from her house in one of her letters.  Building a hospital  Dr. Bement in 1915 Bement and her sister remodeled a small house in the eastern part of Shaowu to use as a makeshift doctor's office, and she began seeing patients that the local druggist sent to her. When she was not treating patients, Bement spent her time learning the local language. The work of the Bement sisters was interrupted by the Boxer Uprising. The sisters fled to the mountains near Foochow and waited until the rebellion had passed to return to Shaowu. When they arrived back at their office in Eastern Shaowu, they found that the house had been all but destroyed. Not a single window or door was left on the home and most of the floors and walls had been ripped out. The only part of the house that was left intact was the roof. The sisters found a pile of loose boards upstairs in the house, and with these they began repairing the house and prepared to see patients once more. A girls school and dispensary were constructed in 1892, well before the Bement sisters arrived; however, the hasty construction of these buildings foreshadowed the challenges with building a hospital in Shaowu. Because of the instability of the soil, it was necessary to lay the hospital foundation fifteen feet deep. Bement would direct roughly forty unskilled masons as they constructed the hospital stone by stone. She often inspected the work herself, checking to make sure that none of the stones were loose. Each stone weighed fifty to one hundred pounds and were gathered from the bed of a river a half mile away. The process was made more difficult because of local beliefs that taking certain rocks would disturb the great dragon, so workers had to travel farther and dig up less accessible rocks. Bement insisted that every brick being used to build the hospital be tested. If the brick rang when lifted and hit with a small stone, it was deemed good for use. If it did not ring, the brick was discarded. This practice led some to call the hospital 'Every brick-rung hospital.\\" The hospital included a dispensary, a house for the native hospital assistants, a kitchen, a laundry room, and a store room.  Providing care  Bement began administering medical care in Shaowu in December of 1899. Each morning she entered a waiting room filled with ill patients, some from as far as twenty or thirty miles away. This length of travel was not uncommon, as Dr. Bement served the largest geographical area in the mission. Dr. Bement treated a variety of illnesses, most commonly dysentery, fevers, open sores, indigestion, ulcers, and burns. She also treated cases of malaria, tuberculosis, and cholera. Bement sent many of the natives she taught at the hospital to the Women's Medical School in Peking, China (now known as Beijing) in hope that they would return to help her with the hospital in Shaowu. However, Bement also requested that the Board of Missionaries send another American doctor to the area, as there was simply too much illness for her to treat alone. In one of her letters, she wrote, \\"If you were to send a dozen new workers this years there would be enough work to tax their strength to the utmost.\\" Bement often wrote letters home to request medical supplies. In 1914, the most urgent item needed was a medicine case. The biggest obstacle that prevented women from seeking care was the weather. In the fall when the weather was good, Bement saw up to twelve-hundred patients in a single month; however, during the rainy season in the spring, she would often see fewer than three-hundred patients per month. Another obstacle to care was the unwillingness of the women to see the doctor more than once or twice. Bement described that in her experience, if a patient was improving she thought she would get well, and if she was not improving she thought that she might as well not come again.  Providing an education  In addition to providing medical care, the Bement sisters constructed a boarding school for girls adjacent to the hospital. While Bement took care of the ill, Frances dedicated her time to educating the youth of the area. The young girls were often paired with older girls with whom they would study and pray. The girls had breakfast at seven-thirty, and the school opened with prayers at eight-thirty. This quiet time lasted until nine. The girls studied and recited psalms and Bible chapters. The average age of the students was fourteen.  Legacy  During journeys home to the United States, Bement often spoke at conferences or gave talks about the work she was doing in Shaowu. On October 11, 1904, she gave one such talk titled \\"Medical work in Shaowu\\" at the Minnesota state convention for the Women's Board of Missions of the Interior (W.B.M.I). In late November 1926, Frances gave a talk about her school in Shaowu to members of the W.B.M.I. During the talk, she called attention to her sister and how she was worn out. Frances said that there was little prospect of Bement ever returning to Shaowu. Bement lived out the rest of her days in the United States and died in October 1940.

Wightman (early 1792 ‚Äì October 26, 1841) was one of the Old Three Hundred Texas colonists, having moved there in 1824. He was often employed as a surveyor for Stephen F. Austin's colony. Texian settler Wightman was born early in 1792 in Herkimer County, New York to parents Benjamin and Esther (n√©e Randall) Wightman. His father was a Baptist preacher and father to 11 children. Elias taught school in New York and then traveled to Texas in 1824. Stephen F. Austin named him in July 1825 to appraise cargo damaged aboard the schooner Lady of the Lake. In August 1826, Wightman joined others to petition Austin to charter a town at Matagorda. Wightman also petitioned Austin for a league of land and on May 25, 1827 he accepted title to a sitio (or league) in Matagorda County. The sitio was located at the mouth of the Colorado River on the east bank of the river. Matagorda Cemetery - 1830 In 1828, Austin sent Wightman and David G. Burnet to the United States to recruit new settlers. While in New York, Wightman married Mary Sherwood, a former student, on October 26, 1828. The couple began their return journey on November 2, 1828 with 50‚Äì60 colonists, mostly New Yorkers. They went by wagon to the Allegheny River where they transferred to boat for the trip down the Ohio and Mississippi Rivers. From New Orleans they sailed west on the schooner Little Zoe, beginning on December 26. Bad weather and the tricky passage of the river channel kept them from landing in Matagorda until January 27, 1829. They lived in the small fort for several months until they could get lumber to build a simple cabin. Mary taught school and Sunday school in a log school house from 1829 to 1832. His parents, who made the trip from New York, both died in 1830 and are the earliest burials in the Matagorda Cemetery. Wightman probably attended an 1829 meeting with Austin at San Felipe to discuss founding a masonic lodge. He was elected surveyor for Matagorda in August 1829. That October, he surveyed the town of Marion. In 1830, he frequently corresponded with frequently Austin while working for him as a surveyor. He promised to teach school for one year and discussed starting a salt works. He and his wife obtained land along Caney Creek which they farmed with several slaves. During the Runaway Scrape in 1836, Mary, her sister, an orphan girl, the family's slaves, and several neighbors fled the Mexican army by sea and were stranded at Galveston. They only returned to Caney Creek with difficulty. In 1837 Wightman was elected Justice of the Peace in Matagorda County. The next year he joined a company exploring the possibility of clearing Caney Creek for navigation. In 1840 he wrote a letter to Mirabeau B. Lamar suggesting that John Delap succeed Silas Dinsmore as county judge. In 1841, Wightman sold his Texas lands and moved to Covington, Kentucky, looking for a more healthy climate. He died there on October 26, 1841. In the 1980s some of Wightman's surveyor notes were placed in the Matagorda County Museum in Bay City, Texas. His compass, which he shared with William Selkirk, can be seen there as well.

It is believed to be a descendant of the Old English Bulldog introduced to Brazil by EuropeansCampeiro Bulldog breed standard - CBKC and is closely related to the Serrano Bulldog.  Name  Campeiro, a Portuguese word meaning \\"fielder\\" or \\"related to fields\\", is widely used in the South Region of Brazil as a term for those who work in rural fields, especially those who take care of cattle and ride horses well. It is reflective of the field and its elements - rural, rustic, peasant, and so on.Creative Dictionary: Campeiro Origin  The Campeiro Bulldog gained prominence in the state of Mato Grosso do Sul, where it was used to herd cattle in slaughterhouses. During the 1970s, it faced extinction due to new sanitary regulations in slaughter houses and also due to the introduction of new breeds. Courtesy of the breeding programs launched by Ralf Bender, there has been a significant increase in number of members of this breed.G1 - Dog breeder says to have traveled the RS to save the Campeiro Bulldog of the extinction There are multiple theories about the origin of the Campeiro Bulldog. The most widespread theory postulates the possibility that the Campeiro Bulldog originated from Old English Bulldogs (now extinct) that may have been brought to Brazil by European immigrants during the 19th or 20th century. Subsequently, these dogs were bred with the local dogs. A less popular theory suggests that the Campeiro Bulldog might actually be a remnant of the \\"Bulldog-type\\" variety of the Fila da Terceira. = First theory: Old English Bulldog = Old English Bulldog. Paris, 1863. The Old English Bulldog was popular in most parts of Western Europe during the second half of the 19th century, to the point that in some states like the Vatican there is legislation regulating the transit of this dog breed on public roads. At the same time, in Europe there was a surge in interest pertaining to the serious development, creation and conformation of several distinct breeds for the purpose of work or exhibition. As a result, several breeds were derived from the Old English Bulldog, such as the modern Bulldog and the Bull Terrier. In Brazil, the European immigration (immigration of Germans, Italians, Polish, etc.) to the South Region, which was encouraged at various times during the early nineteenth and mid-twentieth centuries, resulted in an influx of many species of animals, including dogs, particularly several varieties of bulldogs, such as the Old English Bulldog.The Bully Breeds by David Harris At the same time in Europe, standardization of most canine breeds was carried out mostly on the basis of appearance. However, dog breeds brought into the New World had to prove their worth by exhibiting their efficiency, physical excellence, and temperament in the daily course of work. Quest for development of these traits resulted in the creation of breeds that were significantly different from the ones that existed in Europe at the same time. Thus, this particular variety of bulldog was preserved in the Brazilian lands, thanks to its ability to guard and work with cattle. = Second theory: Fila da Terceira = Bulldog-type Fila da Terceira The Fila da Terceira was a Portuguese dog breed that originally lived on Terceira Island. These dogs were an outcome of the cross between the Spanish Mastiff, Portuguese Mastiff and the old Dogue de Bordeaux (which is different from the current breed). Later, during the 17th century, the Old English Bulldog was introduced, and it was the original \\"Bulldog-type\\" variety with reduced size, as compared to the \\"Mastiff-type\\" variety (without Bulldog insertion), bearing the characteristic crooked tail. This dog was brought to Brazil during the Portuguese immigration as a result of the arrival of the Portuguese court in Brazilian lands. Its Mastiff-type variety (closest to the original form), on being crossed with Bloodhounds, may have resulted in the origin of the Fila Brasileiro, another Brazilian dog breed. It is believed that, later on, the Bulldog-type variety gave way to the Campeiro Bulldog, or at least contributed towards its formation.Terceira Mastiff and relatives breeds  History  The Campeiro Bulldog helped its owners in handling cattle, but not as a herding dog. The dogs that excelled in working with wild cattle and swines were highly valued as much as those dogs that knew how to guard the cart and the horse of the tropeiros (the drivers of mules and horses' commissions that traveled between regions of Brazil during the 17th century). The breed has been exhibiting the functional features of its probable ancestor, namely the Old English Bulldog, which could hold swine through their ears to the slaughterhouse and could dominate a wild cow of up to 400 kg on its own.* C√ÉES & CIA magazine, Brazil: Editora Forix, 2005, mensal, Edi√ß√£o n¬∫ 319, ISSN 1413-3040, reportagem C√£es fora de s√©rie Buldogue Campeiro. Its ability was widely employed in former slaughterhouses in the South Region of Brazil and in the region that now is the State of Mato Grosso do Sul. In these establishments, the dogs were used to subdue cattle and swine at the slaughtering. However, new law measures introduced by the sanitary surveillance prevented the use of dogs in these slaughterhouses. This event combined with the popularity of foreign breeds that arrived in Brazil at the 1970s and 1980s caused the devaluation of the Campeiro Bulldogs, which at the time were considered very common mutts, and the breed came close to extinction.  Breed's restoration  Even as a youth, the cynophile Ralf Schein Bender had fallen in love with the bravery of this dog breed that until then were referred to as Burdoga. His desire to own a dog of this kind made him realize the extreme shortage of the members of the breed. During the late 1970s, realizing that this dog was on the verge of extinction, Ralf Bender began to work towards rescuing these dogs. In 1977 he acquired a female and traveled all over the State of Rio Grande do Sul (RS) to gather the last specimens of the breed, and then began to breed them. His work came to fruition in 2001 when CBKC (Brazilian Confederation of Cynophilia) officially granted recognition to the breed and conferred upon it the name Campeiro Bulldog.  Appearance  Campeiro Bulldog The Campeiro Bulldog is a medium- sized dog with a powerful physical complexion. It is very strong and slightly heavy dog for its size. It is a dog of broad constitution and an almost square muscular body. The breed has heavy bones and carries a typically broad head. It has a short muzzle (which should be 1/3 of the length of the skull), small and pendants ears inserted high on the head as far apart of each other as possible. The tail is preferably short and crooked. The breed has a smooth short hair, and its coat could be in a variety of colors. Traditional coat color includes fawn, brown and brindle with white markings. There are dogs that are entirely white, but they must have pigmented mucous membranes and eyelids, to avoid problems while working.  Temperament  The Campiero Bulldog stands out for its loyalty towards its owner, ease of adaptation, and mainly for being affectionate towards children. Their rusticity and courage make them excellent guard dogs. This breed can be a bit jealous. Suspicious of strangers and quiet, the Campiero Bulldog is known for not barking unnecessarily. These dogs need some daily exercise, if not directly involved in dealing with cattle or another type of work.  Health  The Campeiro Bulldog is a rustic breed. Although some specimens suffer from severe hip dysplasia, overall the condition affects only a few dogs. Presence of hip dysplasia was not noticed by many breeders and owners, and efforts to control this disease began (which may be genetic or due to lack of proper management of the pups) after the realization that the disease, which affects many breeds, was not uncommon or unusual in the Campiero Bulldog. Apart from this (in this breed, the hip dysplasia does not become a problem), there are no other diseases specific to the Campeiro Bulldog that affect the breed on a large scale. It is recommended to prevent external and internal parasites through vermifugation and combat infectious diseases through vaccination.  Exotic varieties  New breeders are mixing and inserting genes from other breeds to produce exotic varieties of Campeiro Bulldogs with different coat colors. As a result of these breeding programs involving the Olde English Bulldogge (OEB - an American dog breed developed in the 1970s), new Campeiro Bulldogs are emerging with new exotic coat colors that have never been common to the breed, such as dogs with blue, merle and tricolor coats.Exotic Colors in Campeiro Bulldogs: Blue Coat.

Changes from 2017‚Äì18  The 2018‚Äì19 Serie D season was one of the most competitive and prestigious in the league's history, due to the presence of several teams with longstanding history in the professional leagues, which were refounded after going bankrupt in 2018. These teams include former Serie A clubs Bari, Modena, Cesena, Avellino and Reggio Audace (formerly known as Reggiana).  Teams  The composition of the league's nine groups was announced on 30 August 2018. Gozzano, Pro Patria, Virtus Verona, Rimini, Imolese, Albissola, Vis Pesaro, Rieti, Potenza, Cavese and Vibonese all depart Serie D, having been promoted to Serie C. = Teams relegated from Serie C = Prato, Gavorrano and Santarcangelo joined the league, having been relegated from Serie C. Akragas was relegated from Serie C to Serie D, but the club did not register and was put into liquidation due to financial difficulties. Fondi was relegated from Serie C, but the club merged with F.C. Aprilia. Owner Antonio Pezone transferred Fondi's sporting title to Aprilia Racing, ending Fondi's existence. F.C. Aprilia played in Serie D the previous season and earned the right to return. The merged club took the name F.C. Aprilia Racing Club and registered with the league for the current season. After the end of the previous season, Mestre attempted to enroll in Serie C for 2018‚Äì19, at the last minute. However, anticipated new financial backers walked away, citing concerns over infrastructure, and the Serie C registration was rejected. Mestre was left with no better option but to play the 2018‚Äì19 season at the Eccellenza level. = Refounded former professional teams = As part of the Article 52 of N.O.I.F. legislation, newborn clubs that explicitly represent the continuity of professional clubs who were excluded from their league can be admitted to Serie D under specific circumstances. A record three Serie B clubs failed to register in the Italian second division for the new season and thus were readmitted as newborn clubs with different ownerships. Bari, probably the most successful one of the three, was refounded under new owner Aurelio De Laurentiis, president of Napoli after the original club renounced participation in Serie B due to financial issues. Cesena also voluntarily renounced registration at Serie B level. Since another club from Cesena, Romagna Centro, was already playing at Serie D level, it was forbidden for a newborn club to be founded and registered with the league. In order for Cesena to continue playing, Romagna Centro renamed itself A.S.D. Romagna Centro Cesena . Avellino was also excluded after losing an appeal regarding their exclusion from Serie B, and a newborn club was subsequently admitted to Serie D. Other refounded teams admitted to Serie D include Modena, which started the 2017‚Äì18 season in Serie C but was excluded later on 6 November 2017, due to falling behind on bills, getting locked out of its stadium and missing four consecutive Serie C matches, because of its players being on strike after not being paid for several months, thus effectively dissolving the club and ending its 105-year history. A refounded version of the club, named Modena FC 2018, was allowed to join the Serie D as a phoenix club. After the 2017‚Äì18 season, Reggiana failed to register the team in 2018‚Äì19 Serie C, after an unsuccessful attempt by owner Mike Piazza to sell a majority interest in the debt-ridden club. Reggio Audace F.C. enters Serie D as a reincarnation of A.C. Reggiana 1919. Following the 2017‚Äì18 season, Vicenza Calcio merged with Bassano Virtus 55 S.T. with the merged club playing as L.R. Vicenza Virtus and retaining the sporting title of Bassano Virtus, resulting in the loss of Vicenza's sporting title and the dissolution of the club. A newly formed company, A.C. Vicenza 1902, requested the sporting title of Vicenza Calcio and entry into Serie D. Both requests were rejected by the Italian Football Federation, which said the club could only apply to play in Terza Categoria. Fidelis Andria was denied registration for the 2018‚Äì19 Serie C, based on Covisoc's assessment of the club's debt situation. On the date of the deadline for Serie D registration, a group of investors led by Marco Di Vincenzo formed S.S.D. Fidelis Andria 1928 as a reincarnation of S.S.

He was a member of the Manouchian Group of the FTP-MOI, a wing of the larger Francs-Tireurs et Partisans (FTP) composed of fighters of foreign immigrant origin. Tchakarian was the last surviving member of the Manouchian Group (Groupe Manouchian), a Paris-based resistance cell led by Missak Manouchian. Biography Tchakarian was born to an ethnic Armenian family in Sapanca, the Ottoman Empire (present- day Turkey) on December 21, 1916. The family fled to Bulgaria to escape the Armenian Genocide during World War I. Tchakarian arrived in France in 1930 with his family and settled permanently in the country. He worked as a tailor. In 1937, Tchakarian was conscripted into the French Army, where he served until 1940. He was discharged from the Army in 1940 following the defeat and occupation of France by Nazi Germany. He then became active in the nascent French resistance. =Manouchian Group and the French Resistance= In 1942, Tchakarian joined the Manouchian Group, a small armed group within the larger FTP-MOI that was composed primarily of immigrant and foreign-origin resistance fighters. The group was commanded by Missak Manouchian, an ethnic Armenian communist and poet. In addition to Armenians, like himself, the Manouchian Group contained immigrants and refugees from other countries invaded by Nazi Germany, as well as Jews. According to Tchakarian, immigrants from fascist countries and those occupied by Nazi Germany were drawn to the resistance and cells like the Manouchian Group, \\"They were immigrants who had come from countries that were becoming fascist, like Hungary, Romania, Poland, Bulgaria...From all those countries, there were immigrants who were kind of hunted out.\\" Together, the Manouchian Group, which were base in the Paris region, carried out resistance attacks, assassinations, and acts of sabotage across the country. In 1944, German authorities captured 23 Manouchian members, including their leader, Missak Manouchian. The members were sentenced to death and executed following a high-profile show trial. Following their executions, German and Vichy French authorities launched a propaganda campaign against the Manouchian Group. Red posters, which became infamously known as \\"Affiche Rouge\\", were hung in Paris during the spring of 1944. The Affiche Rouge depicted the Manouchian Group and its members as \\"the army of crime\\" in a bid to turn French public opinion against the resistance. Unlike his 23 Manouchian colleagues, Tchakarian managed to escape capture and execution in 1944. He fled to Bordeaux, where he was hidden by other French resistance members. However, he remained an active resistance member until the end of World War II in 1945. =Post-war= In 1950, Ars√®ne Tchakarian moved to the Parisian suburb of Vitry-sur-Seine, where he lived until his death in 2018. Tchakarian was granted French citizenship in 1958. Tchakarian became a respected historian in the decades following World War II. His writings focused on the Armenian Genocide and French history. Tchakarian campaigned for the international recognition of the Armenian Genocide, from which he and his family had fled as refugees. He visited schools and universities to speak about his experiences during the genocide in the Ottoman Empire and the Nazi German occupation of France.

As a work of Roman law, the original language of many of its legal texts would have been Latin. The earliest Syriac manuscript (British Library, Add MS 14528) is usually dated to the 6th century, although a date as late as the 8th century has been argued for. In the 20th century, several later Syriac manuscripts from the 13th‚Äì17th centuries came to light. One of these identifies the compiler as a certain Ambrosius, a contemporary of an emperor Valentinian, probably Valentinian III, but this information is not reliable. Arabic and Armenian translations of the Syriac also survive, as does a Georgian translation made from the Armenian in the 18th century.Gerhard Th√ºr, \\"Syro‚ÄêRoman law book\\", in Roger S. Bagnall, Kai Brodersen, Craige B. Champion, Andrew Erskine and Sabine R. Huebner (eds.), The Encyclopedia of Ancient History (Wiley-Blackwell, 2013), pp. 6495‚Äì6496. Retrieved 1 September 2018. All these versions vary slightly in scope.Gottfried Schiemann, \\"Syro- Roman law book\\", in Hubert Cancik and Helmuth Schneider (eds.), Brill's New Pauly, Vol. 14 (Brill, 2009). Retrieved 1 September 2018. The compilation was very popular with Christians in the formerly eastern Roman lands after the Islamic conquests and today these manuscripts are held by various Eastern Orthodox, Oriental Orthodox and Eastern Catholic churches. The content of the work is unsystematic and even includes laws that were obsolete already in the 5th century. It was long considered a mixture of actual imperial law and local eastern Roman custom, but with the publication of a critical edition (2002) this view has become untenable. It is now recognised that it is a compilation of official legal texts (often in paraphrase) with commentary (including fictional cases) designed for use in eastern law schools, such as the law school of Berytus. Only some of the didactic explanations contain evidence of local custom. There are about 160 texts in the law book. They included court decisions from the eastern empire, especially those based on prominent 2nd- and 3rd-century jurists, as well as short thematic treatises. They also contain the statutes (constitutiones) of several 5th-century emperors, and later copyists sometimes sought to enhance the work's authority by naming it a collection of laws of Constantine I, Theodosius I (or II) and Leo I. Although it deals with penal and public law as well, the primary focus of the Syro- Roman law book is private law, especially family law (inheritance, marriage, dowries, paternal authority and slaveholding). Given this focus, it has been suggested that the compilation was designed for use in episcopal courts (episcopalis audientia), where such things would have formed the bulk of actual cases. Both the episcopal theory and the law school theory, however, are at best guesses; the original purpose of the work is unknown. The Syro- Roman law book in its Syriac version had been introduced to Iraq (which had not been part of the Roman Empire, but rather the Sasanian Empire) by the middle of the 8th century. It was accepted as \\"the pure laws of Christianity\\" by Patriarch Timothy I (died 823) of the Church of the East. This was partly due to the desire of Christians living under Muslim rule to have a law code comparable to Islamic or Jewish law.Patricia Crone, Roman, Provincial and Islamic Law: The Origins of the Islamic Patronate (Cambridge University Press, 1987), pp. 12 and 119. The Arabic version of the Syro-Roman law book has 130 articles and is titled \\"Collection of All the Good Laws and Penalties of Kings Constantine, Theodosius and Leo\\". It uses the term sunnah (law, custom) two centuries before the term became widely used in Islamic jurisprudence. It had influence on Islamic law in several areas, such as the law of succession.Chibi Mallat, Introduction to Middle Eastern Law (Oxford University Press, 2007), pp. 22‚Äì32.

Maladaptive daydreaming is not a widely recognised diagnosis, and is not found in any major diagnostic manual of psychiatry or medicine.

This experience is reported to be extremely rewarding to the extent that some of those who experience it develop a compulsion to repeat it that it has been described as an addiction. Somer has proposed \\"stimuli\\" for maladaptive daydreams that may relate to specific locations. The main proposed symptom is extremely vivid fantasies with \\"story-like features\\", such as the daydream's characters, plots and settings.

He was the half-brother of the priest Kiprijonas Nezabitauskis. After law studies at Vilnius University, he moved to Warsaw where he worked at the state censorship office until retirement in 1857. His main work is a Lithuanian primer published in 1824. It was the first illustrated primer as well as the first to include Lithuanian proverbs. It was accompanied by the first Lithuanian bibliography ‚Äì a list of 73 Lithuanian-language books and manuscripts between 1557 and 1824. Between 1835 and 1850, he edited the Polish calendar Kalendarz powszechny. Biography Nezabitauskis was born in near Salantai, Samogitia, then part of the Russian Empire, to a family of free peasants. Born as Zabitis, he followed the example of his elder half-brother and changed his name to Polish Niezabitowski and adopted the Lubicz coat of arms to appear to be from the Lithuanian nobility. He attended a Dominican school in ≈Ωemaiƒçi≈≥ Kalvarija and a gymnasium in Kaunas. In October 1821, he became a student in the Law Faculty of Vilnius University. There he met other Samogitians who supported and promoted the use of the Lithuanian language (the early stages of the Lithuanian National Revival) and joined their activities. In particular, he was close with Dionizas Po≈°ka who in his last will even left his Lithuanian manuscripts to Nezabitauskis (though, it appears that Nezabitauskis did not actually get them). Together with professor , Nezabitauskis traveled across Samogitia collecting information on Lithuanian dialects. With help from Count Nikolay Rumyantsev, Nezabitauskis obtained a position in Warsaw as an adjunct of the Ministry of Education in 1825. He later became secretary at the state censorship office. He retired with a state pension in 1857. In Warsaw, he wrote and published some works in Polish, but due to his day job he was disliked by various activists. He died in Warsaw in 1876. Works Illustrations of letters D, E, and G from the primer by Nezabitauskis In 1824, Nezabitauskis published a primer of the Lithuanian language entitled Naujas moks≈Ças skaytima diel ma≈∫≈´ wayk≈´ ≈πemaycziu yr Lietuwos (New Education on Reading for Little Children of Samogitia and Lithuania). It was the first illustrated primer in Lithuanian that used images to teach letters ‚Äì e.g. an image of a horse (arklys in Lithuanian) for the letter a. As reading exercises, he included 53 Lithuanian proverbs. It was an important addition not only because it was one of the first publications of Lithuanian folklore but also because earlier primers included only religious texts (catechism and prayers) and a poem praising corporal punishment in schools. The primer was published in 3,000 copies and was sold out in less than a year. Five copies were sent to Count Nikolay Rumyantsev via professor . The primer was praised by the Tsarist government and Nezabitauskis even received an expensive ring as a reward. In 1860, Mikalojus Akelaitis prepared a second edition, but it was not published. Dionizas Po≈°ka highly praised the primer for its language purity, good spelling, and style and wanted to publish a Polish translation. The primer also included the first bibliography of Lithuanian-language books published in Lithuania. It listed 73 books and manuscripts between 1547‚Äì1824. This bibliography, translated into Polish and expanded, was republished in '. The bibliography was republished by Laurynas Ivinskis in 1860 and in 1869. Nezabitauskis continued to update the bibliography and in 1829 prepared a 14-page list that he hoped but failed to publish as a separate booklet. He also was working on a history of Lithuania in Polish. These manuscripts were held at the Polish Museum in Rapperswil, Switzerland, until World War I and at the National Museum in Warsaw where it was lost during World War II. In letters to professor Micha≈Ç Wiszniewski and Simonas Daukantas, Nezabitauskis claimed authorship of an unfinished manuscript of a Lithuanian‚ÄìPolish dictionary and of a 75-page booklet on beekeeping translated from a Polish work by Jan Krzysztof Kluk. While this claim has been rebuked by literary historians who showed that the works were written by his half-brother Kiprijonas Nezabitauskis, it is still sometimes repeated. In the same letter to Wiszniewski, Nezabitauskis claimed that he was the author of a Polish prayer book mistakenly published under than name of Bishop (according to Nezabitauskis, the bishop only contributed an introduction). The prayer-book was published in 1825 and republished in 1832, 1833, 1836 and 1847. Nezabitauskis published an article on the Baubliai museum established by Dionizas Po≈°ka in ' in 1823 and published Po≈°ka's historical work Rosmy≈õlanie wie≈õniaka rolnika (Thoughts of a Village Farmer) in 1829. Nezabitauskis prepared a manuscript of a Lithuanian grammar in Polish in 1823 and revised it in 1837, but it was not published. In Gazeta Warszawska, Nezabitauskis published some articles regarding Lithuanian matters (e.g. about calendars published by Laurynas Ivinskis or history of the Samogitian Diocese published by Motiejus Valanƒçius). Together with (Pranas Zatorskis), he translated nine Lithuanian folk songs into Polish that were published by Oskar Kolberg in 1846. In 1832, he edited Tygodnik Polski, but only ten issues appeared. From 1835 to 1850, he edited Polish calendar Kalendarz powszechny. He also translated historical and moral works from German and French into Polish.

Thus, it is a form of autotransplantation. Typically, the tissue used in the graft is cancellous bone harvested from the patient's Iliac crest and laid in strips across the fracture site. The use of the patient's living bone stimulates osteogenesis, the growth of bones. The Phemister graft was first described in a paper published in 1914 by American surgeon Dallas B. Phemister, and it was named for him. Its efficacy was confirmed the same year by Canadian surgeons William Gallie and D.E. Robertson. In 1949, Phemister described a variation on the technique where the graft tissue was inserted into the base of the greater trochanter and femoral neck in order to treat osteonecrosis. A 1967 study found the original Phemister graft to be more effective than the cortical sliding graft and cancellous graft for fractures of the tibia. The Phemister graft is preferred when a fracture demonstrates delayed union, meaning the fracture is slow to heal. Due to internal forces, the procedure is not recommended for the femur, humerus, or radius bones. It can be used for areas of bone which have undergone the first two stages of osteonecrosis. For example, in young patients, or those with sickle cell disease, it can serve as an effective long-term treatment for osteonecrosis, as long as it is performed in the early stages. In this instances it is a more conservative treatment, and in the long term can postpone the need for a hip replacement. In the later stages of osteonecrosis (3 through 6), where the bone has begun to collapse or has fully collapsed, the Phemister graft is not recommended.

She was the mother of the writer, Stephen Crane. Early years Mary Helen Peck was born in Wilkes- Barre, Pennsylvania, April 10, 1827. She was the only daughter of Rev. George Peck, D. D., of the Methodist Episcopal Church, the author and editor; and the niece of Bishop Jesse Truesdell Peck. During the three years that her father was principal of the Wyoming Seminary, she attended the classes suitable to her age. On his removal to New York City in 1840, she became a student of Rutgers Institute in that city, where she spent three years. Career January 18, 1848, in New York City, she married Rev. Jonathan Townley Crane, D. D. (died 1880, Port Jervis, New York), of the Methodist Episcopal Church, Newark Conference. They had fourteen children: Mary Helen, George Peck, Jonathan Townley, William Howe, Agnes Elizabeth, Edmund Bryan, Wilber Fiske, Elizabeth Townley, Luther Peck, Myra Blanche, Blanche, Jesse T., Jesse T., and Stephen. She was a devoted wife and mother, assisting her husband in his work in the church and among the poor. For several years, she was a class leader in St. Paul's Methodist Episcopal Church, Newark, New Jersey, in which she did much toward the character development of the youth in her class. In 1872, she was appointed Corresponding Secretary for New Jersey by the New York branch of the Woman's Foreign Missionary Society of the Methodist Episcopal Church, and later served as Recording Secretary of the board of managers of that body. During Crane's term of service as corresponding secretary of this society, she was active and successful in forming local societies in aid of the cause. The General Conference of 1872 constituted her a member of the board of managers of the Ladies and Pastors' Christian Union, and the Newark Annual Conference of 1875 made her Corresponding Secretary of the Conference Society. For some years, she was deeply interested in the temperance cause, speaking and writing in favor of its advancement. As her children grew up, she devoted much time to the work of the Woman's Christian Temperance Union (WCTU). Crane delivered addresses on several occasions before the members of the New Jersey Legislature, when temperance bills were pending, and she greatly aided the men who were fighting to secure good laws. The National WCTU, which met in Cincinnati in 1875, constituted her vice-president for New Jersey. As the pioneer of press work by women at the Ocean Grove Camp Meeting, she did valuable work, including reports for the New-York Tribune and the New York Associated Press, during the last ten years of the religious and temperance gatherings at the Ocean Grove Camp Meeting. For about ten years, she was the State superintendent of press for New Jersey of the WCTU. She wrote several leaflets that were of great value to the press-workers of the local unions.

At least 20 versions are known. They vary in length from 30 to over 900 lines.

In a series of answers to those riddles, King David explains the origin of light, sun, moon, and social classes.

The root \\"golub\\" (dove) in title \\"Golubinaya\\" is not about birds. It is believed to be derived from the root \\"glub\\" (depth, deep), which refers to depth of concepts described in the book. Also it could originate from \\"sefer torah\\": truncated \\"sefer tor\\" can be translated to Russian as \\"dove book\\". Several major Russian poets and artists of the early 20th century (such as Nicholas Roerich and Andrey Bely) were inspired by the Dove-Book.

The song is about a child, Johny, who is caught by his father eating sugar. Versions of this song comprising more than one verse usually continue with variations on this theme.  History  A 1989 book by the American scholar and professor Jessica Wilson records the nursery rhyme being told in Kenya in 1980. According to Vinoth Chandar, the CEO of ChuChu TV, it was already old enough to have been in the public domain in India by 2018, indicating that it would have been at least 60 years old (per Indian copyright law); Chandar wrote in 2018 that he \\"used to hear it\\" as a child, and that elderly people would also have listened to it as children.  Lyrics  The lyrics to the song are in a call and response format, and typically sung to the tune of \\"Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star\\". The original and most well-known version of the song is:  Music videos  According to Polygon, it was first published on YouTube as a nursery rhyme in 2009 by the channel Shemrock Nursery Rhymes. However, the song was first featured on YouTube in 2007, where it was used in an Indian 5 Star commercial. The nursery rhyme has been recreated by many other edutainment YouTube channels targeting young children. As of 20 August 2020, a video containing the song, uploaded to YouTube by Loo Loo Kids in 2016, has more than 3.7 billion views, making it the eighth-most-viewed video on the site, as well as the second-most-viewed nursery rhyme video and one of the top 10 most- disliked YouTube videos. Another video of the song, uploaded by ChuChu TV in 2014, has more than 1.7 billion views, another uploaded by CVS 3D Rhymes in 2017 has over 1.2 billion views, and a further video in Spanish uploaded by FAMA JAMA has over 1.0 billion views. Another video was listed in 2015 by The Daily Dot as one of eleven \\"unintentionally disturbing\\" YouTube videos for children.  Internet meme  The song became an internet meme in August 2018, with one version by Billion Surprise Toys‚Äîa company with 16 million subscribers to its YouTube channel‚Äîgoing particularly viral on Twitter. This version prominently features Johny and his father doing popular dance moves such as the \\"Gangnam Style\\" dance, and intertwines the original lyrics with a repeated \\"doo-doo-doo-da-doo\\" to the melody of \\"Baby Shark\\". The various videos by edutainment channels were subsequently described as \\"terrifying\\", \\"disturbing\\", \\"nonsensical\\" and \\"a godforsaken nightmare\\". The song's popularity has been attributed to the Elsagate phenomenon of potentially disturbing or absurd YouTube videos being algorithmically shown to children through the YouTube website and the YouTube Kids app. The Verge, Mashable and New York Magazine found \\"remixes\\" by Billion Surprise Toys, one featuring an anthropomorphic refrigerator (as the liar), to be particularly absurd, even when compared to other \\"Johny Johny Yes Papa\\" videos. Shortly after the song went viral, Billion Surprise Toys began to issue aggressive DMCA takedown requests for videos and images derived from its own videos published on social media. This move was considered controversial for various reasons. Firstly, because of the unclear copyright status of the song itself, secondly because American copyright law permits parodies as a form of fair use, and thirdly, because the UAE (Billion Surprise Toys' native country) allows for \\"The reproduction of the work for the purpose of personal, non-profit and non- professional use\\" under their fair use laws. In 2017, BBC's UK kids series Teletubbies did an impersonation of the song on their YouTube channel. In May 2019, Nick Jr.'s official YouTube channel parodied the song as \\"Villains Nursery Rhyme Remix\\".

Plot In the middle years of World War Two, Saffron Courtney, now a fully trained Special Operations Executive agent, is tasked with travelling to occupied Belgium and Holland to investigate a suspected major intelligence leak. With the help of Shasa Courtney and Blaine Malcomess, Saffron is given the identity of a fictional Afrikaner fascist sympathizer, allowing her to infiltrate the ranks of the Flemish National Union. She discovers that the Nazis have taken possession of all the S.O.E. radios within the Low Countries, allowing them to be forewarned of any intelligence work being carried out by S.O.E., while also learning of the Final Solution. She is then forced to go on the run from the Nazis and their collaborators after killing an SS officer attempting to rape her. With the help of the Belgian resistance and the R.A.F., she escapes back to Britain with her information. Meanwhile, Saffron's lover, Luftwaffe pilot and German war hero Gerhard von Meerbach, participates in the Battle of Stalingrad and the subsequent doomed Nazi war effort. While drinking in a bar following the conflict and mourning the loss of one of his friends, he gets accosted by a drunken German soldier who accuses him of cowardice, prompting Gerhard to openly denounce Hitler in a furious outburst. Colonel Henning von Tresckow learns of Gerhard's words, and invites him to participate in the 20 July plot. After it fails, Gerhard's correspondence with von Tresckow is discovered by Gerhard's brother Konrad, a high-ranking member of the SS, who has him arrested for treason and arranges for him to stand trial at the People's Court. Not wanting to have such a widely regarded figure convicted of a capital crime, and having no decisive evidence against Gerhard, the Luftwaffe and SS agree to a deal in which Gerhard will be let off on minor charges if he swears an oath of loyalty to Hitler. Gerhard refuses to do so during his trial, and is imprisoned in Sachensausen concentration camp. In 1945, Saffron is assigned to track down allied prisoners of war being held by the Nazis before they can be taken into the care of the Russians, in anticipation of the approaching Cold War, and discovers firsthand the horrors of the Holocaust. The prisoners, Gerhard among them, are moved to Dachau concentration camp, and then taken by members of the S.S. towards a Nazi alpine fortress, to be used as bargaining chips in negotiations with the Allies. A Wehrmacht unit takes possession of the prisoners and brings them to a luxury hotel to recover. Gerhard contracts typhus during this time and nearly dies, but Saffron - who had at this point given up on seeing Gerhard again - finds him and nurses him back to health.

A cavalryman of the qurchi corps, he is principally known for his chronicle of Safavid history; the A·∏•s√¢n al-Tav√¢rikh.  Biography  Most information about Hasan Beg's life stems from his own work, the A·∏•sƒÅn al-tavƒÅrikh, which he completed in 1578. He was born in Qom, a member of the Turkoman Rumlu tribe, and the grandson of Amir Soltan Rumlu, a prominent Qizilbash lord who served during the reign of King (Shah) Ismail I (). Hasan Beg's Qizilbash background makes him \\"somewhat unique in the annals of Safavid historiography\\". After his grandfather's death in 1539 or 1540, Hasan Beg found himself unable to gain command over his grandfather's army, because, according to his own explanation, \\"he was busy with his unpleasant duties as a qurchi\\". Though a military officer, Hasan Beg \\"received the sort of training that was typical of a Persian administrator and bureaucrat\\". For example, among other subjects he studied works on logic as well as the art of calligraphy. In 1541‚Äì1542, Hasan Beg accompanied King Tahmasp I (1524‚Äì1576) on an expedition to Dezful, and from then he \\"was with the royal camp in all its journeys, and saw most events with his own eyes, thus becoming an eyewitness to most of the subsequent military events that he described\\". In 1546‚Äì1547, some five years after the Dezful campaign, Hasan Beg fought in Tahmasp I's Georgian campaigns. The last military episode in which Hasan Beg reports his own involvement was Tahmasp I's battle against the Ardalan Kurds in 1550. Though Hasan Beg does not mention his involvement in succession matters after the death of Tahmasp I, contemporary author Abd-ol-Hossein Nava'i suggests that Hasan Beg sided with the other Rumlu's, who sought to install Prince Ismail Mirza (later known regnally as Ismail II; 1576‚Äì1577) on the throne and who were adversaries of the pro-Haydar Mirza camp. Nava'i suggests that Hasan Beg may have been part of the Rumlu qurchis who took part in the murder of Haydar Mirza. When Ismail II died in 1577, Hasan Beg became part of the royal retinue of his successor, Mohammad Khodabanda (1578‚Äì1587). Hasan Beg's \\"most enduring legacy is historiographical\\". Later Safavid historians (e.g. Iskander Beg Munshi) used material from Hasan Beg's A·∏•sƒÅn al-tavƒÅrikh in the sections of their works related to the rule of king Tahmasp I. Hasan Beg's work was used by Fazli Isfahani Khuzani for his Af≈ºal al-tavƒÅrikh and also survives in \\"a very late cluster of mostly anonymous semi-fictional accounts of early Safavid history such as the  øƒÄlamƒÅrƒÅ-ye Shah EsmƒÅ øil\\". Later historians also quoted material from Hasan Beg's work, even though they did not mention Hasan Beg by name.

Life Jacobsen was a merchant in Basinghall Street, London. He was the London-born son of Sir Jacob Jacobsen, a north German merchant, of a family closely involved with the Hanseatic League, and their London base, the Steelyard. From 1735 Jacobsen ran the family business there. The Steelyard, the headquarters in London of the Hanseatic League In the period 1726‚Äì9 Jacobsen rebuilt East India House in the Doric order, which took on the form it presented for the rest of the 18th century. The work was carried out under John James. The House was then reconstructed in the late 1790s, to a plan by Richard Jupp. In 1731 Jacobsen was unsuccessful in submitting a plan to the Bank of England, for building work that was carried out to a design by George Sampson. Jacobsen designed the Foundling Hospital; the plan was approved in 1742, and was carried out under James Horne as surveyor. Jacobsen became a governor of the hospital. After a falling-out with Jacobsen in 1742, Thomas Coram, the hospital's founder, failed to be re-elected to its General Committee. Henry Keene did further work on the Foundling Hospital site, under Jacobsen's supervision. Jacobsen also designed the Royal Hospital Haslar. His plans for Trinity College, Dublin's West Front and Parliament Square were carried out in the 1750s by Henry Keene and John Sanderson (died 1774). Also involved in the building work there was Hugh Darley (1701‚Äì1770). Jacobsen became a Fellow of the Royal Society, the Society of Antiquaries of London, and the Society of Arts. He died on 25 May 1772, and was buried in All Hallows Church, Thames Street, London. He did not marry.

An obscure shrub native to South Africa, it is known for its multi-coloured foliage and yellow flowers, which bloom in autumn to winter. Background A cliff-denizen, the plant is mainly found on rock edges and shale slopes at an altitude of 800-1700m, in the central Tugela catchment basin, from Tugela Ferry to Muden, in KwaZulu-Natal in South Africa. This species is named for its protracted corolla tubes: longiflora which translates to 'long flowered' from the Latin longus meaning long, and floreo flower.Court, D. (2010). Succulent flora of southern Africa. Revised edition. Struik Nature , an imprint of Random House Struik (Pty) Ltd, Cape Town. A vulnerable and rare plant, Listed as Vulnerable Kalanchoe longiflora is elusively known and is currently found in less than five regions which are proximate to compactly populated areas, thus degrading the surrounding natural areas due to grazing, trampling and agriculture. Nonetheless, the fact that this plant prefers rocky sites, it would be protected by most human-caused damages and, as such, its population is stable.Descoings, B. (2003). Kalanchoe. In: U. Eggli (Ed.), Illustrated handbook of succulent plants:Crassulaceae: 143‚Äì181. Springer Verlag, Berlin. Description Heat and drought tolerant, its leaves can transform from a deep green to crimson depending on the environment. A thin shrub up to 400mm high, its quadrangular, fleshy but woody-based, branches lie on the ground with its tips growing upward. Having fibrous roots, its leaves are fleshy a limpet shell-shaped with rounded tip and teeth, and the base is wedge-shaped. The leaves are a showy, light, bluish grey-green, cloaked in a waxy blossom, with the edges and aged leaves being pinkish to reddish brown.Von Staden, L. & Dayaram, A. 2011. Kalanchoe longiflora Schltr. ex J.M.Wood. National Assessment: Red List of South African Plants version 2013.1. Yellow flowers appear on its capitulum between late autumn and winter, which are made up of four petals coalesced into an lengthened tube 11-14mm long with disseminating, thin triangular lobes 2-3mm long.Hutchings, A. 1996. Zulu Medicinal Plants, an inventory . University of Natal Press, Pietermaritzburg. Cultivation Appropriate for containers, rock gardens, groundcover, prolonged walls an arid gardens, the plant would grow well on well-drained porous soil on clay pots and would need abundance of airflow, bright light or full sun. It is to be watered when its soil is dry to the touch and it must be protected from frost. If grown in a cooler, shadier spots, the plant will not display the ruddy colouration of the leaf tips as powerfully, and it will also incline to have larger leaves. Moreover, routine watering and feeding with compost will make the plant sturdier and a rapid grower.Jackson, W.P.U. 1990. Origins and Meanings of Names of South African Plant Genera . UCT Printing Department, Cape Town. =Propagation= Propagated by cuttings, it can be planted immediately in the soil or instantly in the garden and will root without the need of rooting hormone or mist.Leistner, O.A. (ed.). 2000. Seed plants of southern Africa: families and genera. Strelitzia 10. National Botanical Institute, Pretoria. The plant is easily propagated by a single leaf that a fallen stem piece on the ground would root promptly on soil. This is an adaptation to survive treading by surrounding animals, or rocks falling on them.

One day he decides to go to a bar. There he is offered a briefcase and told that he had given it to the barkeep himself 100 days ago, saying that he would return in 100 days but not remember the briefcase and that the barkeep was to return it to him anyway. In it are mementos and photos of their time together, along with the diary Yuri kept then. Ryo next gets a call from Yuri's mother who tells him that Yuri has committed suicide. Ryo returns to the bar. It specializes in magic and also runs magic classes. Ryo ends up taking classes and finds himself quite good at it. Then while there the bar owner tells him that he, the bartender, has a doppelg√§nger who teaches the classes. Ryo learns that he has his own doppelg√§nger named Ryu, who is coincidentally a skilled magician, in Hokkaido. He learns this when he learns that Ryu was killed in a magic stunt that went wrong, but had never been found. Yuri had talked about Hokkaido to Ryo before her death and when he learns of the doppelg√§nger, he decides to go there. In Hokkaido, Ryu finds Yuri's doppelg√§nger who goes by the name of Aya. She thinks he is Ryu who has somehow escaped the stunt. Ryo pretends to be Ryu in order to keep the girl who is so much like Yuri by his side. When Ryo sleeps with her, he notices that she has the same tattoo as Yuri did. He leaves the next morning without saying goodbye to Yuri, but he leaves the contents of the briefcase behind to remind Aya/Yuri of what they had together in Tokyo. He finds Yuri's mother and tells her that Yuri is alive in Hokkaido. The woman confesses that she is in fact Yuri's aunt and not her mother...and that Yuri never died. Yuri is from Hokkaido. She was so troubled by Ryo's death that her aunt brought her to Tokyo where she created a new identity for herself, calling herself Yuri. She fell for Ryo's doppelg√§nger, but slowly began to feel guilty, thinking that perhaps Ryo had survived. She assumed her Aya identity and returned to Hokkaido. Ryo spends the next year practicing and honing his magic skills Ryo is then informed that Yuri is in fact suffering from multiple personality disorder and has been institutionalized. Her emotional health was too fragile to stand the shock of finding out that who she wanted to believe was Ryu was actually Ryo. Ryo breaks her out by performing a magic trick at her hospital and they spend a long time together and have an in-depth exchange about identity. Aya can't claim her identity because doing so would mean admitting that Ryo is dead, so she wavers between Aya and Yuri, but Yuri needs to stop existing because she's just a fiction. Eventually Aya/Yuri allows herself to be taken back to the hospital. In order to make up for hurting Yuri/Aya, Ryo decides to immerse himself into Ryu. He prepares to recreate Ryu's final trick in which he disappeared. His body is put into a cage and dropped into the ocean. He manages to escape, but in the meantime, finds Ryu's body in the water. He later finds an audio tape made by Ryu explaining that, by slipping into another dimension, Ryu became aware of Ryo, and knew that 2 doppelg√§ngers can't survive together. He could see Ryu's future with Yuri/Aya, but not his. He was willing to sacrifice himself if Ryo would come and love what he had loved, including Aya/Yuri.\\"Colors wind film review vertigo meets prestige tragic japanese\\" South China Morning Post https://www.scmp.com/culture/film-tv/article/2152595/colors-wind-film-review- vertigo-meets-prestige-tragic-japaneseAsian Pop Up Cinema \\"Colours of Wind\\" Review https://www.asianpopupcinema.org/wind31318/  Cast  * Yuki Furukawa as Ryo/Ryu * Takemi Fujii as Aya/Yuri * Tomoya Ishii as Ryoma Kawaguchi * Yoshihiko Hakamada as Kiyofumi Watanabe * Yoshiko Nakada as Kanae Kawaguchi\\"Colors of the Wind\\" kaze-no-iro Sinemia https://www.sinemia.com/movies/kaze-no-iro  References   External links  2017 films Japanese films Japanese-language films Japanese adventure films Japanese romance films Films directed by Kwak Jae-yong ","title":"Colours of Wind"},{"id":"58373035","text":"The list of shipwrecks in October 1848 includes ships sunk, foundered, wrecked, grounded, or otherwise lost during October 1848. 1 October 2 October 3 October 4 October 5 October 6 October 7 October 8 October 9 October 10 October 11 October 12 October 13 October 14 October 15 October 16 October 17 October 18 October 19 October 20 October 21 October 22 October 23 October 24 October 25 October 26 October 27 October 28 October 29 October 30 October 31 October Unknown date References 1848-10 ","title":"List of shipwrecks in October 1848"},{"id":"58373046","title":"List of ambassadors of Malaysia to Azerbaijan"},{"id":"58373076","text":"The list of shipwrecks in November 1848 includes ships sunk, foundered, wrecked, grounded, or otherwise lost during November 1848. 1 November 2 November 3 November 4 November 5 November 6 November 7 November 8 November 9 November 10 November 11 November 10 November 12 November 13 November 14 November 15 November 16 November 17 November 18 November 19 November 20 November 21 November 22 November 23 November 24 November 25 November 26 November 27 November 28 November 29 November 30 November Unknown date References 1848-11 ","title":"List of shipwrecks in November 1848"},{"id":"58373088","text":"Emily Lenore Doolittle (born 16 October 1972) is a Canadian composer., zoomusicologist and Athenaeum Research Fellow at the Royal Conservatoire of Scotland based in Glasgow, Scotland.

She married in 1790 to Edward Nelson in Shoreditch. He became a member of the Innkeepers company as an Innkeeper in Whitechapel. When her husband died in 1800, she inherited the business which was based at The Bull inn in Aldgate. They had four children. She was to join the small number of women who operated coach companies.

She started it in 1826 and it required the organisation of horses to be exchanged over twenty times. The coach set off at 5:30 in the morning and stopped only for 20 minutes at Bagshot and a half-hour dinner at the Deptford Inn on Salisbury Plain. At first it took 17 hours and arrived at 10:30 p.m. but as the roads improved the time fell to fourteen hours. Her Exeter Telegraph was considered faster than the \\"Quicksilver\\" which took 21 hours to get to Devenport. As her children grew she left the coaching business to her son John and in the first real census of 1841 she gave her occupation as innkeeper.

While a historical figure, depictions and portrayals of him are most often based on his appearance in the biblical story of Belshazzar's feast in the Book of Daniel. This story is the origin of the idiomatic expression \\"the writing is on the wall\\". The writing is on the wall In chapter 5 in the Book of Daniel, a hand writes Hebrew letters on a wall, which Daniel interprets as \\"Mene, mene, tekel, upharsin\\". These words mean that Belshazzar is doomed. The phrase \\"The writing is on the wall\\", or \\"The writing on the wall\\", has become a idiomatic expression referring to the foreshadowing of any impending doom, misfortune, or end. If \\"the writing is on the wall\\" something bad is about to happen. A person who does not or refuses to see \\"the writing on the wall\\" is being described as ignorant to the signs of a cataclysmic event that will likely occur in the near future. One of the earliest known uses of the phrase in English is in the writings of a Captain L. Brinckmair in 1638, during the Thirty Years' War. Brinckmair writes: \\"Remarkable Prodigies..are in themselves like the writing on the Wall in Beshazzars Palace, which Sooth-sayers, Astrologians, and Chaldeans could neither understand nor reade‚Äô.\\" Music George Frideric Handel wrote the oratorio Belshazzar in 1744 * The Play of Daniel (Ludus Danielis), believed to have been first performed in the 12th century, and written by students at the school of Beauvais Cathedral.

Through his early involvement with the Confessing Church (\\"Bekennende Kirche\\") he came to wider prominence as an opponent of the Nazi government, spending time in Sachsenhausen concentration camp.  Biography  = Early years = Werner Koch was born in Bielefeld. On leaving school he moved on to study Lutheran Theology at Marburg, T√ºbingen, Paris and finally (and most intensively) Bonn. At Bonn he formed a firm friendship with his professor, the influential scholar- theologian Karl Barth. He was still an undergraduate student in July 1931 when he first met Dietrich Bonhoeffer. Like Barth and Bonhoeffer, Werner Koch was hugely critical of the political developments in Germany during the early 1930s. After several years of intensifying political polarisation and parliamentary paralysis, the Nazis took power in January 1933 and moved quickly to transform Germany into a one-party dictatorship. = Confessing church = After passing Part I of his Theology Exams, Koch embarked on his \\"Vikariat\\" (probationary period as a trainee church minister) in 1934, while still in Bonn. Early in 1935 he began to write reports covering developments and struggles involving the Confessing Church (\\"Bekennende Kirche\\"), which can be seen as a movement within German Protestantism that arose during the Nazi years in opposition to government-sponsored efforts to unify all Protestant churches into a single pro-Nazi Protestant Reich Church. See drop-down essay on \\"Unification, World Wars, and Nazism\\" He supplied his reports, under a pseudonym, to newspapers in Switzerland and Britain. Dietrich Bonhoeffer had by now become a leading figure in the Confessing Church. In October 1935 news reached Koch, who was still in Bonn, of a forthcoming \\"Confessing Church Ministers' Seminar\\" (course) to be conducted by Bonhoeffer at Finkenwalde (on the edge of Stettin) during the winter of 1935/36. Koch broke off his studies and moved to Finkenwalde where he attended the (illegal) seminar and resumed his ministerial training, now as a trainee for the Confessing Church. He now met Dietrich Bonhoeffer for the second time. There were excellent transport links with the capital and his weekend visits to Berlin were frequent. Koch evidently had a talent for reporting, and Bonhoeffer encouraged him in his journalistic activities. In Berlin during the Autumn of 1935 he established contact with international press agencies such as Reuters. He also found himself much in demand among senior diplomatic correspondents posted to Berlin, increasingly deprived of reliable information on what was happening in Germany through more conventional channels. He was able to provide accurate reportage from the inside on the increasingly intense struggles within the Protestant churches between those content to operate as a state mandated institution and the Confessing Church faction who were not. The 25-year-old Koch's regular briefings to the foreign press were both illegal and, from the point of view of the authorities, unwelcome. Meanwhile, he also found time to pursue his \\"Vikariat\\", now based in Wuppertal-Barmen. Koch received support and encouragement for his journalistic work from his friend Ernst Tillich. Tillich was himself engaged in briefing foreign journalists on the church struggles, but he also had his own problems with the church, and Tillich reduced his own reporting as Koch moved centre stage with the foreign pressmen during 1936. Werner Koch was arrested on the morning of Friday 13 November 1936. and taken, in the first instance, to D√ºsseldorf. His ordination, scheduled for Sunday, had to be deferred. Friedrich Wei√üler, a leader in the Confessing Church also prominent for his involvement in Christian resistance against National Socialism, as well as Ernst Tillich, had been arrested the previous month. All three were suspected in connection with the release to foreign media of a memorandum addressed to Adolf Hitler, delivered to the Chancellor on 4 June 1936 (without evoking any reaction), and which the Confessing Church had planned to have read out in pulpits on 23 August 1936. The text of a version of the memorandum was published in the foreign press in July 1936, during the build-up to the Olympic Games. First it appeared in the London-based The Morning Post on 17 July and then, on 23 July, in the Basler Nachrichten. It never did become entirely clear how the leak to the foreign media had occurred, and it was only several months later, in the Autumn, that the Gestapo determined that Koch had been involved. = Concentration camp = Koch was transferred to the Sachsenhausen concentration camp on 13 February 1937, together with around a dozen others, including Wei√üler and Tillich . Paperwork accompanying the three men identified Friedrich Wei√üler as Jewish, and when they reached the camp he was separated from the \\"Aryan\\" detainees. Friedrich Wei√üler died at Sachsenhausenon 19 February 1937 as a result of the torture to which he had been subjected. For Werner Koch, release from the concentration camp came unexpectedly on 2 December 1938 as the result of what one source describes as a \\"whim of Himmler's\\". The background was less whimsical. Koch's father had persuaded a friend, Baron Kurt von Schertel, to intervene with Himmler on his son's behalf. Himmler had been invited as a guest of von Schertel to a private dinner party which he held on 1 December 1938 at the elegant resort of Wiesbaden. Late in the evening the host ventured to ask Himmler to arrange for the release from the concentration camp of the youngest son of his friend, Maximilian Koch. The father had taken the further precaution of preparing a detailed account of his son's arrest, which was handed to Himmler. Himmler evidently read the note, and later that same evening ordered his minions to set in motion the necessary arrangements. = War years = Until his conscription in November 1939 Koch now worked for the Evangelical Press Association for the Rhineland. In July 1939 he married Gerritdina Stokmann whose family came from the north-west of the country, close to the Dutch border. His first assignment after he had been conscripted involved work as an overseer and simultaneous translator in Emsland, working with French-speaking prisoners of war. In the summer of 1942 he was redeployed to the Eastern Front as a member of a punishment battalion. He was soon wounded and returned to the west where early in 1943 he was assigned to a battalion of French Prisoners of war at M√ºlheim an der Ruhr employed, as before, as a simultaneous translator. By March 1945 it was apparent that the war would soon end and that Germany was on the losing side. Werner Koch deserted from the army and, in the words of one admiring student to whom Koch taught \\"religious studies\\" during the 1980s, \\"fled to the English\\". Other sources state that he handed himself over to American forces, but it was in any event as a British prisoner of War that he spent the next couple of years. = Postwar years = Immediately after the war ended, in May 1945, The British created a prisoner of war camp at Ascot Racecourse adapted, it seems, from a training facility that had been made available to Free French forces during the years of fighting. According to at least one source the Ascot camp was set aside for those German prisoners of war who had been identified as opponents of National Socialism. It was here that Werner Koch served as a camp pastor during 1945/46. During this time he was able to resume his activity as a journalist. He also undertook work for \\"London Broadcasting\\" (\\"Londoner Rundfunk\\" ‚Äì presumably the BBC). Koch published an autobiography in 1982. However, the focus of the book is on his time as an anti-Nazi activist, and there is relatively little information available on his later years. In 1946 or 1947 he was appointed a pastor in the Wedding quarter of Berlin, then in the French sector of the city and, after 1949, part of West Berlin. He moved briefly back to Bielefeld in 1952/53 and then took a pastoral appointment at Espelkamp, a short distance further north. He moved again in 1958, this time to nearby Netphen, where he served till 1969. In 1969 he moved with his wife to the County of Bentheim, in the extreme northwest of West Germany, settling in Emlichheim which was where his wife had been born. Although he still undertook a certain amount of journalism, the principle focus of his semi- retirement was on religious teaching. As a contemporary and eloquent witness of Germany's Nazi nightmare, he undertook several lengthy international lecture tours of the years. Close to home, he engaged actively with the German-Dutch \\"Nooit meer / Nie wieder\\" (\\"Never again\\") organisation, serving for many years as chairman on the group's German side. He was also, over many years, a president of the Sachsenhausen Committee for West Germany. In 1972 Werner Koch received his doctorate from the Protestant Faculty of Theology in Paris. His dissertation, also published in book form, concerned Gustav Heinemann.

It is a parasitoid of the sunflower stem weevil Cylindrocopturus adspersus, and a number of other species of stem-boring weevils. Description Nealiolus curculionis has a body length of just under . It has an oval shape, a moderately-curved carapace and a transverse clypeus, and the third tergite is finely sculpted with longitudinal lines. The color is basically black apart from the legs, which are brown, the dark brown antennae, the brown clypeus and mandibles, the brown ovipositor and the dark brown tip of the abdomen. Distribution This wasp is found in Canada, the United States and Mexico, and has also been recorded in Costa Rica, Guatemala and Venezuela. Life cycle This wasp shows a considerable degree of synchronization with its host species. When parasitizing the sunflower stem weevil, the female wasp lays a single egg into a first instar larva, which feeds just under the epidermis of the stem where it is within reach of the wasp's ovipositor. By the winter, the host larva is fully developed and enters diapause in a chamber near the base of the plant. The wasp larva, still contained within its living host, also enters diapause. In the spring, the wasp larva resumes feeding and after about 21 days chews its way out, feeding on the weevil larval carcase before pupating. The adult wasp emerges about ten days later, and is on the wing between June and August, with males emerging a few days before females. Hosts In the United States, the sunflower stem weevil (C. adspersus) is the most common host species, but other larvae parasitised include the red sunflower seed weevil (Smicronyx fulvus), the boll weevil (Anthonomus grandis), the plum curculio (Conotrachelus nenuphar), and the potato stalk borer (Trichobaris trinotata). In Mexico, the main insect host is Trichobaris championi, feeding on the Mexican husk tomato (Physalis ixocarpa).

Her work is known for frequently utilising the process of transcription of a variety of pre-existing pieces of music. She has been widely commissioned by international orchestras, ensembles and soloists, and has won the Jules L√©ger Prize for New Chamber Music twice, in 2016 and in 2011. Since 2018 she has been Professor of Composition at the Guildhall School of Music and Drama in London, UK.  Education  Miller studied with Christopher Butterfield at the University of Victoria (2005) and at the Royal Conservatory of the Hague (2008) with Richard Ayres and Yannis Kyriakides before studying privately with Michael Finnissy in 2012. Miller returned to academic research in 2014, as a PhD candidate at the University of Huddersfield, supervised by Dr Bryn Harrison and supported by the Jonathan Harvey Scholarship.  Career  Miller's music has been commissioned and performed by orchestras including BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra, the Oslo Philharmonic, the Toronto Symphony Orchestra and the Winnipeg Symphony Orchestra. Ensembles who have performed her work include EXAUDI Vocal Ensemble, the London Sinfonietta, I Musici de Montr√©al, Ensemble Plus-Minus, Ensemble contemporain de Montr√©al, and Continuum Contemporary Music. She has ongoing artistic relationships with the soprano Juliet Fraser and the Canadian string quartet Quatour Bozzini, for whom she wrote the pieces About Bach (2015), Leaving (2011), Warblework (2011) and Just So (2008/2018). These four works were released as an album by the label Another Timbre in 2018, alongside a second album of her orchestra and ensemble music. From 2010 to 2013, Miller also was artistic director of the concert series \\"Innovations en concert\\" in Montreal. Miller moved to London to take up the post of Associate Head of Composition (Undergraduate) at the Guildhall School of Music and Drama in September 2018.  Use of transcription  Miller often bases her work on pre-existing music, for example: a computer transcription of Kurt Cobain singing the folk song \\"Where Did You Sleep Last Night?\\", in For Mira (2012), written for violinist Mira Benjamin, a recording of Maria Callas singing \\"Vissi d‚Äôarte\\" from Puccini's opera Tosca in Bel Canto (2010), and a recording of an anonymous mbira player from Mozambique in Philip the Wanderer (2012). Her work takes these transcriptions as starting points, investigating her response to the music through processes of repetition and looping. Often the source material is unrecognisable in Miller‚Äôs finished works. Her works employ musical notation, but also sometimes recordings of the source music, which performers learn by memory, such as a recording of the blues singer Maria Muldaur, which Miller uses in her piece Guide (2013).

Chua of BusinessWorld praised the opening sequence by El Gamma Penumbra, fourth wall-breaking jokes and the film's parodies of various drama films, but viewed Vice's continued reliance on insult comedy and innuendos as stale and repetitive, saying \\"The movie's premise and sheer starpower guarantee the film will be a blockbuster, but if you're expecting something new from Mr. Viceral's yearly MMFF entry, you're bound to be disappointed as it is more of the same: innuendos (which makes one question why it's rated Parental Guidance) and his usual insult comedy.\\" She did however conclude that \\"it's a feel-good if mind-numbing film for people who want to shut down and get a few laughs here and there.\\" John Magbanua of Bandera also gave the film a mixed review, praising the film's special effects and romantic pairings but was critical of the formulaic production and what he noted as censorship done presumably to make the film more family-friendly. Magbanua also noted that Fantastica could have incorporated more carnival elements to add more to the film's narrative. =Box office gross= It was announced by Star Cinema in a thanksgiving dinner organized for Fantastica, that the film became the highest grossing MMFF film which starred Vice Ganda. Fantastica earned with the figure including earnings from both domestic and international release of the film.

Currently, vehicle tests are being conducted on Pakistani roads with CBU Unit. = Hybrid cars = Pakistan already has a significant market for hybrid vehicles with Honda's Vezel and Freed, Toyota's Prius and Aqua. However, these cars aren't being locally manufactured in Pakistan, but are directly imported from Japan. In May 2019, An all-new Suzuki Swift was rumoured, presumably doing test rounds on the roads of Pakistan. The car was rumoured to be registered under Pak Suzuki‚Äôs name. The most important bit of information about this Swift was its hidden emblem presumably \\"Hybrid\\". Pak Suzuki, according to images, had hidden the emblem with tape on it. If the rumors are to be believed then this CBU Swift Hybrid could be available in Pakistan by the end of 2020. However, it cannot be conclusively said whether Pak Suzuki will launch the vehicle in the local market, as the company has not made any official statement in this regard.

These are British-built locomotives of 3,000 horsepower for 25 kV AC. They are stored out of use because the overhead lines are unserviceable, owing to theft of copper.  Challenges being faced  The industry of electric vehicles faces serious challenges in Pakistan. The major problem is the lack of awareness among common car buyers about the advantages of EVs over the combustion engine vehicles. The shortfall of electricity and lack of charging infrastructure are the major reasons why electric vehicles aren't considered by the public. Charging time required by the electric vehicles and the driving range that they offer are considered to be the negative factors that discourage the local consumers from buying EVs. Also given the amount of load shedding in Pakistan because of WAPDA‚Äôs massive circular debt due to which home and electric charging stations might not receive uninterrupted supplies of electricity. It is usually questioned whether Pakistan's electricity power generation capacity will be able to cater to increased demand from electric vehicles in the future. Initiatives by Government of Pakistan The Automotive Development Policy 2016‚Äì2021 and the launch of China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) have been encouraging foreign investments for the new automobile brands to enter Pakistani market. In the budget 2018‚Äì19, The government had given exemptions of 16 per cent customs duty on charging stations of electric vehicles, reduction of customs duty from 50 per cent to 25 per cent and an exemption of 15 per cent regulatory duty (RD) on electric vehicles. The government had also reduced customs duty on kits of electric vehicles from 50 per cent to 10 per cent. On 5th November 2019, Pakistan's federal cabinet had approved the first-ever national Electric Vehicles (EV) policy in a bid to tackle effects of climate change and offer affordable transport. In the first phase, the government will focus on converting 30 per cent of the total number of vehicles, mainly cars and rickshaws, into EVs by 2030. According to policy, 100,000 cars and 500,000 bikes and rickshaws will be converted to EVs in next 4 years, and more than 3,000 CNG stations that have been shut due to gas shortage will be converted to EV charging stations. Pakistan is also planning to set up special units of electric car manufacturing in the Special Economic Zones being established under the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor. In November 2019, MoU was signed between Pakistan's Minister of Science and Technology Fawad Chaudhry and CEO of Airlift to introduce battery buses for Pakistan's public transport system.  Industry associations  *Pakistan Electric Vehicles manufacturers Association.http://www.originalelectricvehicles.com  Charging infrastructure  The charging infrastructure for electric vehicles in Pakistan has not been fully developed yet. In January 2017, Dewan Motors with BMW inaugurated Pakistan's first public charging station for electric and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles in Emporium Mall, Lahore. Dewan Motors had installed another station for plug-in hybrid and electric vehicles at Dolmen Mall in Karachi in February 2017. BYD has also plans for setting up charging stations in Pakistan which will be done in association with the leading oil company in the country, Total Parco. EV chargers located at PSO Fuel station in Jinnah Super Markets (F7), Islamabad In July 2020, The first charging station was set up at one of PSO stations located in Islamabad by Barqtron Energy Company. According to Federal Ministry of Energy, 24 more charging stations are being planned to be added at PSO stations across Pakistan.

To date, her disappearance is the longest missing child case in the Republic of Ireland. The investigation into her disappearance has been beset by allegations of political intervention and police incompetence. Disappearance Mary Boyle was last seen at 3:30 pm on 18 March 1977 near her grandparents' rural farm in Cashelard, near Ballyshannon, County Donegal. The family, including Mary's mother Ann, father Charlie, older brother Paddy, and twin sister Ann, had gone to Boyle's maternal grandparents house on St Patrick's Day from their home in Kincasslagh in The Rosses, further up the coast. She had been playing outside with her siblings and two cousins, and then followed her uncle who was returning a ladder to another farm, across the hillside, when they had reached a small pool of water that was too deep for her to get through. Either her uncle told her to go back, or Boyle decided for herself, but she turned around halfway into the journey saying she was going back. The walk back for Boyle should not have lasted longer than five minutes, whilst her uncle stayed at the neighbours for 30 minutes chatting with the family that he had returned the ladder to. After discovering that Boyle had disappeared, her family instituted searches of the local area and questioned passers-by if they had seen the girl. One fisherman was quoted as saying that he had seen Boyle being put into a red car and then driven away, although he later corrected this in the BBC podcast by saying he had not actually seen Boyle, but just a suspicious red car. Many of the bogs in the area were drained and scoured in an effort to find Boyle. Boyle's twin sister had stated that she was eating a packet of crisps at the time and if she had fallen into a bog, the packet would have floated on the surface. Investigations The Garda√≠ started a search of the surrounding area and drained a lake behind her grandparents' house. They also created a reconstruction of the disappearance and Ann, Mary Boyle's twin sister, was used in the film as 'Mary'. The initial investigation has been subjected to several accusations of political interference and police incompetence. In 2008, the Irish state broadcaster, RT√â, profiled a documentary programme about the case called Cracking Crime. Over the intervening years, the performer Margo O'Donnell, a friend of, and relation to the family, has funded searches on the surrounding hillsides in an effort to try and locate Boyle's body. Police searches have also taken place since 1977, with the latest taking place in 2016 when An Garda S√≠och√°na launched a new investigation. However, no evidence has been found. The case has attracted some publicity because of the allegations of political involvement which centred around the accusation that a politician phoned the Garda√≠ and told them to not question or detain their main suspect. Margo O'Donnell was said to have walked up to the politician who was accused of making the call in 1977 and asked if he had done so. According to O'Donnell he said \\"[that it] was untrue and called me a bare-faced liar.\\" The length of time that Boyle has been missing and its counter-accusations of official involvement has led to The Guardian labelling the case \\"Ireland's Madeleine McCann\\". The case is now the longest running missing child case in the Republic of Ireland, and despite the publicity it attracts, it has not been debated in the D√°il. It was raised by Lynn Boylan, MEP, in the European Parliament where she highlighted the lack of direction in the case. In 2018, relatives and supporters held a silent protest outside the coroner's office in Stranorlar. The protest was intended to force the coroner to hold an inquest into Boyle's death which would allow key witnesses to be interviewed on public record for the first time. Mary Boyle's twin sister Ann was among the group, which handed in a petition containing more than 10,000 signatures demanding that an inquest be held. In 2016, the controversial Irish investigative journalist Gemma O'Doherty, produced a documentary about the disappearance (\\"Mary Boyle: The Untold Story\\") which explores several possible causes for her disappearance. In the documentary, Boyle's twin sister Ann posits the scenario that Mary was sexually abused and then murdered. The documentary has come under some criticism by the people interviewed for the programme. Both the retired Garda sergeants who talked on screen deny that any political pressure was brought to bear on their investigation, although one interviewing officer was told to \\"ease-off\\" when questioning one of the suspects in the case, though this was by a senior officer in the room at the time of the suspect's interview. The documentary led to O'Doherty being sued for defamation by the late Fianna F√°il politician, Sean McEniff, for damages of ‚Ç¨75,000, although McEniff was never mentioned by name in the documentary. In 2019, after McEniff's death, a judge granted his estate leave to continue the case. In March 2018, Garda√≠ issued a request for information regarding the case and stated that the investigation was still live. Suspects The initial suspect, questioned soon after Boyle disappeared, was released without charge. Other people have been questioned in relation to the disappearance of Boyle; Brian McMahon was taken in for questioning by Garda√≠ in October 2014, but was released without charge the following day. McMahon later went on public record denying any involvement in the disappearance and stating that local people knew he could not have been involved. Robert Black, a convicted child-killer, was also proposed as a suspect when it was revealed that he was a cross-border truck driver who could have been in the area at the time of Boyle's disappearance as he'd often visited Donegal delivering goods. Black was known in the area and had been charged by the Garda for after hours drinking. His van was identified outside a pub in Annagry, County Donegal, at the time of Boyle's disappearance. A witness later claimed that they had heard crying and whimpering from the rear of the van. However, by the time of Gemma O'Doherty's documentary going online, it was widely believed that Black could not have been responsible. Mary Boyle's twin sister Ann and several other relatives publicly claim they believe they know what happened to Mary and who is responsible for her disappearance. This has caused tension and a division within the Boyle family, with Ann's mother (also named Ann) publicly admonishing her daughter in 2016; calling her public appeals \\"...the most ridiculous carry on I ever seen in my life.\\" Aftermath Mary Boyle's father Charlie died in a fishing accident off the coast of Donegal in 2005. In 2011, Margo O'Donnell released the single \\"The Missing Mary Boyle\\" to raise funds for a new search for the missing girl. Due, in part, to Mary's sister Ann's public accusations, the Boyle family remain divided.

It was formed mainly by water overflowing through the Owens River and which passed through Lake Searles into the Panamint Valley. At times, Lake Panamint itself overflowed into Death Valley and Lake Manly.  Geography and geomorphology  The lake developed within Panamint Valley, California. This valley is a north‚Äìsouth trending depression that is bound between the Panamint Range in the northeast and the Argus Range-Slate Range in the west-southwest. The town of Ballarat lies in the valley, and California State Route 190 crosses the former lake basin in its northern sector. The existence of a lake in this valley was first postulated in 1914. Lake Panamint was about long and wide, making it a long and narrow lake. Both the main inlet and the potential outlet were located in a narrower southern part. The total water volume was about . The lake consisted of two basins that were sometimes separated by the Wildrose and Ash Hill Horsts: The northern Lake Hill basin close to Panamint Springs and Big Four Mine Road and the southern Ballarat basin The total surface area of the lake was about . A number of shorelines have been identified in the valley, indicating variable water levels. There are two principal shorelines at and , the high shoreline is known as the Gale shoreline. There are a number of other shorelines which span an elevation range of about .  Geology  The Panamint Valley lies in the southern Basin and Range Province, which has been subject to extensive Quaternary tectonic activity characterized by crustal extension along normal faults as well as strike-slip fault activity. Volcanic activity between 7.7 and 4 million years ago preceded the opening of the valley, leaving basalts stranded on either side. Subsequently, the Panamint Valley Fault Zone triggered subsidence of the valley floor and the separation of the formerly connected Darwin Plateau and Panamint Ranges. Little tectonic activity occurred while the valley was flooded although lake sediments have been deformed by a high fault scarp and fault offsets are observed in many places of the Panamint Valley, and while there is evidence for fault movement only a few hundred years ago, historical earthquake activity in the region is low. Tufa deposits have been found in the Panamint Valley, some of which form fringing reefs and algal mounds. Lake Panamint has left clay, marl and silt deposits in Panamint Valley. Cobble beaches developed at the Nadeau Road and Lower Water Canyon localities, while wave-cut terraces were identified close to Ballarat and Big Four Mine Road and delta deposits close to Panamint Springs.  Hydrology  The deserts of the Southwestern United States were not always as dry as today. During the ice ages, large lakes such as Lake Bonneville and Lake Lahontan developed in the Great Basin of the United States because of changes in the weather patterns of the region. In these times, the Laurentide Ice Sheet expanded and displaced the jet stream. = Inflow = Map of the Owens River system Lake Panamint was part of a chain of lakes that started with Owens Lake and continued through China Lake and Searles Lake into Lake Panamint. During wet periods, the upstream lakes would overflow and fill the downstream lakes until the latter overflowed as well into the next lake. The source of this water was ultimately the Sierra Nevada and cations transported by this water have left their traces in the Panamint Valley. Such overflow episodes occurred four times between 700,000 and 350,000 years ago and then again 150,000, 120,000, 24,000 and 10,000 years ago, usually during periods where glaciers expanded on the Sierra Nevada; the last time where such water reached the Panamint Valley was 23,500 years before present. During oxygen isotope stage 4 Lake Panamint was filled by groundwater, which comes in part from the Sierra Nevada and in part from the Panamint Range. There are also some hot springs that show evidence of geothermal heating and in general spring discharge sites close to faults are associated with peculiar coastal environments. Desert drainages also added water to Lake Panamint, some of these are still active today. = Overflow = Lake Panamint itself overflowed at times into Death Valley and its lake Lake Manly through Wingate Pass and Wingate Wash, forming a delta on the shorelines of Lake Manly where it entered the latter; such overflow restricted the maximum height that water levels in Panamint Valley could reach to about above sea level, corresponding to a maximum depth of ; the high shorelines lie at the same elevation as the Wingate Pass sill. Overflow from Lake Panamint was a principal source of water for Lake Manly during the time the overflow was active. When such overflow occurred is unclear but apparently was restricted to oxygen isotope stage 6; during oxygen isotope stage 2 Lake Panamint was the terminal basin for the Owens River and no overflow occurred after about 30,000 years before present.  Biology  Charophytes and widgeonweeds grew in Lake Panamint. Freshwater snail and other gastropod fossils have been found in lake deposits such as tufa; genera found at Lake Panamint include Amnicola, Helisoma, Lymnaea, Valvata and Vorticifex. Fecal pellets from brine shrimps have been found in lake deposits. Various fish such as suckers (Catostomus) and Western chubs (Gila and Siphateles) inhabited the lake when it was overflowing. Today they still occur in the Owens River system. When Lake Panamint existed, California voles used the rivers reaching to and from the lake to propagate across the desert. Ostracods also lived in the lake waters, including Candona, Cyprideis and Limnocythere species. During shallow water periods, foraminifera also populated the lake, and the presence of diatoms and other planktonic fossils was reported already in the 1950s. During the most recent highstand of Lake Panamint, humans occupied its shorelines and left stone tools. Chipped-stone crescents, a common archeological artifact in California, have been found on the former shores of Lake Panamint and geoglyphs have been observed in the northern sector of Lake Panamint.  Lake history  Panamint Valley was flooded about five times over the last 100,000 years, coinciding with glacial periods. These lake stages have been assigned letter codes from oldest to youngest, \\"E\\", \\"F\\", \\"G\\", \\"H\\" and \\"I\\"; their chronology is often uncertain. Lake stages at Lake Panamint coincided with the Tahoe and Tioga glacier advances in the Sierra Nevada. While the height of water levels during the Last Glacial Maximum was at first assumed to be about above sea level, it was later found that Lake Panamint reached heights of . It is possible however that around 22,600 ¬± 130 years ago Lake Panamint was split into a northern basin sourced from local drainages and a southern one receiving water from Lake Searles.

He primarily plays at fly-half. He has also played with England U20s, where he won a world title, and various academy and other junior teams. He attended Felsted School and as of 2018 is studying a business and finance degree at the University of Hertfordshire. Domestic =School= Malins' first participation in rugby was at his local rugby club, Saffron Walden, aged 6. His rugby would then move to his new club, Bishop's Stortford RFC, where he would remain playing until the age of 16. While at Bishop's Stortford he would participate in the winning of 7 age-group tournaments. Malins attended Felsted School from a young age, and his rugby highlights included reaching the final of the NatWest Schools Cup U18 Vase. While playing a school game for Felsted he was identified by Saracens' scout Matt Davies, before being invited to join the Saracens junior academy at 17. Whilst at school Malins was also a promising cricketer and hockey player, representing the school 1st XI at both sports from the age of 15 and top scoring in the 2014 Cape Town international Hockey Festival. =Old Albanians= During his time in the Senior academy Malins held dual registration with Old Albanian. He played 19 games for them with a high scoring rate of 11 points per game. His performance during the 2015/16 season aided significantly in returning the Old Albanians to National One, via the play-off mechanism. =Saracens= Malins made his first team debut in late 2016, coming on as a substitute in the Anglo-Welsh Cup. Since then he has played 29 games across all competitions, with a particular focus in the Anglo-Welsh and international breaks, which caused the absence of Owen Farrell and Alex Lozowski. He has scored 104 points in these games. However while his try rate (7 in 29) has been high, his place-kicking success rate has been fairly low (63%). With reasonable success in his games in the 17/18 season, and an increased likelihood of both Saracens' first choice fly-halves missing games due to international duty, Malins was offered and accepted a two-year contract extension, to the end of the 2019/20 season. He agreed a further contract extension which would see him and spend a season on loan at Bristol Bears along with fellow teammate Ben Earl. International =U18= Malins' England Under-18 debut game occurred in February 2015, where he scored a try. He also participated in the victory against Scotland shortly afterwards. Malins was selected for the 3-month tour to South Africa by the U18 England team in the summer of 2015. The 3-month tour, as well as a number of regional games, had 3 primary games: the French U18 team and two games against South Africa U18. =U20= Malins participated, primarily at fullback, in England U20s winning an U20 title in Manchester in 2016 and at fly-half in reaching the final again in 2017, before being defeated by New Zealand. He was particularly noted by Ian Vass (England U20's head coach) as being a major figure in their success, acting as a calmer figure around which the team could bond. He acted as the primary place-kicker in the latter competition for the majority of his games with a 72% success rate.

Career  Kim was born in Yeosu, South Korea. Her family was involved in the seafood industry, and Kim learned how to cook from her female relatives. In 1992 she and her husband moved to Columbia, Missouri, where Kim worked as a teacher. In Missouri, she found the quality, variety, and availability of Korean food to be lacking, and so she often cooked for other members of the local Korean-American community. In 2003, she and her husband divorced, and with her two fully-grown children out of the house, Kim started playing MMO City of Heroes using the character name Maangchi, meaning \\"Hammer\\" in Korean. Kim was introduced to YouTube's online cooking scene in 2007, inspiring her to begin making videos about Korean food, using the channel name Maangchi.

Founded in 2011 as a residency program and exhibition space, Spring has been called \\"rather enjoyably resistant to categorization\\" and a ‚Äúvisual arts equivalent to a hacker space.‚Äù In 2016, Spring received the Prudential Eye Award for Best Asian Contemporary Art Organization.  History  Spring Workshop has worked with more than 350 local and international residents and collaborators, including Ming Wong, Wu Tsang, Heman Chong, Wong Wai Yin, Qiu Zhijie, Christodoulos Panayiotou, Ho Tzu Nyen, Melati Suryodarmo, Jalal Toufic and Michael Friedman. Spring has organized over 100 public programs, exhibitions, and produced several publications. Located in the industrial neighborhood of Wong Chuk Hang, the organization is housed in a 14,500 sq. ft of warehouse space, including studios, an exhibition space, kitchen, lounge, and a terrace‚Äîproviding a live/work set up for both short-term visits and long-term research and production for artists, curators, writers, researchers, and musicians. The organization has helped address the shortage of space faced by creatives in Hong Kong where many artists, designers, and architects occupy industrial blocks in Fo Tan, Kwun Tong, and Chai Wan. Spring is privately funded and conceived as a five-year initiative with the aim to experiment with the way art is produced, experienced, and supported. In 2016, the founder Mimi Brown stated that Spring, at the end of its five-year run, would enter a period \\"where it can lay fallow for a while like a field.\\"  Exhibitions and programs  The Spring team has produced various research-driven exhibitions that were organized in collaboration with their residents. These exhibitions include A Collective Present with Tiffany Chung and Koki Tanaka (2017); Sailing Through Ha Bik Chuen‚Äôs Archive with John Batten (2017); Without Trying with Wong Wai Yin (2016); Duilian with Wu Tsang (2016); Days push off into nights (2015); The Permeability of Certain Matters with Christodoulos Panayiotou and Philip Wiegard (2014); Adventures in Reality with Michael Friedman (2012); and The Universe of Naming with Qiu Zhijie (2013). Aside from exhibitions, Spring has commissioned works for ongoing display from Hong Kong artists Kacey Wong, and ESKYIU, while also featuring works by Magdalen Wong and Iftikhar Dadi, among others. Spring has also collaborated with many non- profit arts organizations in Hong Kong and abroad, such as Asia Art Archive, Para Site, Tai Kwun, Videotage, and Witte de With Centre for Contemporary Art, among others, to create and host exhibitions and programs. Spring's first presentation in 2011 of Yang Fudong's The Fifth Night was in collaboration with Videotage. Sumangala Damodaran's Singing Resistance (2014) was conceived with Claire Hsu in partnership with Asia Art Archive. Spring presented the performance program for the exhibition Taiping Tianguo, curated by Doryun Chong and Cosmin Costinas, as well as Islands Off the Shores of Asia (2014), curated by Inti Guerrero and Cosmin Costinas of Para Site, which highlighted work by Ming Wong developed over his two residencies. The organization hosted the HKNME's Modern Academy music education program for young professionals, and a dance program created by Happ‚Äôart featuring the work of choreographer Bruno Isakovic. It hosted M+/Design Trust grantees Ling Fan and Joseph Grima as residents. Ari Benjamin Meyers's An exposition, not an exhibition (2017) was presented as a prelude to the launch of the Kunsthalle for Music with Witte de With Center for Contemporary Art. Moderation(s) (2012‚Äì14) was co- created with artist Heman Chong and curator Defne Ayas, former director of Witte de With Center for Contemporary Art, and featured several programs, including Guilty Pleasures by Ang Song Ming; Incidents of Travel, a program conceived by Latitudes featuring Nadim Abbas, Yuk King Tan, Ho Sin Tung, and Samson Young, A Fictional Residency with Oscar van den Boogaard, and The Social Contract by A Constructed World (2013). In 2018, Spring presented Dismantling the Scaffold‚Äîthe inaugural contemporary art exhibition at Tai Kwun, the center for heritage and arts located at the former Central Police Station complex in Hong Kong. Dismantling the Scaffold is considered as \\"an introduction to a new cultural monument in the city.\\" The exhibition was curated by Christina Li, who organized several key projects during her tenure as Spring's director between 2015‚Äì17.

Biography  In 2009, Rodgers earned her bachelor's of science in physics and music from the University of Edinburgh and in 2010, she completed her master of science in digital composition and performance from the same school. Rodger's work focuses on textural and spatial aspects of sound and the experience of listening, and on the physical and acoustic properties of instruments. In 2013, she pursued a year-long collaboration with S√©verine Ballon after being introduced to the cellist by her PhD superviser, Newton Armstrong. The collaboration resulted in her work, Late Lines, for cello and electronics, in which the electronic sounds are derived exclusively from simple processing of the cello. In 2014, she was a Sound and Music Next Wave artist. Two of her works from the same year, Partial filter and Cut it out were performed at Cafe Oto in 2015, by Oren Marshal and Mark Knoop, respectively. Partial filter also appears on the NMC Next Wave release Then, in 2016, she was selected as one of Sound and Music‚Äôs New Voices and was an Embedded composer, taking part in the Quatuor Bozzini's Composers' Kitchen. During this scheme she wrote her Three Pieces for String Quartet, which were later performed again by members of Apartment House at the British contemporary music series, Music we'd like to hear. Rodgers is listed in the British Music Collection. An article written by her on Simon Emmerson's work, \\"Spirit of ‚Äò76\\", also appears on the BMC website, as part of their 50 Things series, in which they ask musicians to reflect on works from the collection that have been influential on or of interest to their own work. Her 2018 work, York Minster, was recorded by the Marsyas Trio for upcoming release on NMC. York Minster is one of a series of works that explore the harmonic frequencies of resonant spaces, what Rodgers refers to as 'Real Spaces'. The other two works in the series so far are Maeshowe (based on the acoustic fingerprint of the Neolithic Tomb in the Orkney Islands) and St Andrew's Lyddington. In July 2018, she was a recipient of an Oram Award, celebrating female innovators in music and sound, sponsored by PRS. She is currently studying for a PhD in music composition at City, University of London, supervised by Newton Armstrong.

As a young man he became a soldier during the Franco-Spanish War (1635‚Äì59), and participated in the Fronde rebellion of 1648‚Äì53. King Louis XIV of France pardoned him for this, and he played an important role in the fighting in Italy. After being made governor general of the Antilles he transferred the administrative center from Saint Christopher Island (Saint Kitts) to the more strategically located and economically important Martinique. He had to deal with constant crises in supplies caused by the (often-ignored) ban on trading with the English and Dutch. He improved the administration, developed the defenses of Fort Royal, and helped fight off an attempted Dutch invasion in 1674. Family Jean-Charles de Baas was born some time after 1612. His family came from B√©arn in southwest France, but may have originated in the Netherlands. His grandfather was Pierre de Baas, jurat of the town of Nay in B√©arn (now Pyr√©n√©es-Atlantiques), around 1567‚Äì68. His father Jean de Bas of Nay, co-seigneur of the \\"secular\\" abbey of Igon, married Judith de Laugar of Pau, from a family of councilors in the Navarre parlement, around 1610‚Äì12. Jean-Charles's older brother, Isaac de Baas, was a soldier who became sub- lieutenant of the King's musketeers. He resigned in 1658 in favour of d'Artagnan, prototype of a character in the historical romance The Three Musketeers by Alexandre Dumas. Military career Jean-Charles de Baas was captain in the Regiment de Persan under his brother Isaac de Baas, who was major of the regiment. He joined in the Fronde rebellion (1648‚Äì53) and participated with his brother in abduction plots of C√©sar, Duke of Vend√¥me and Cardinal Mazarin. In September 1652 he helped defend the Ch√¢teau de Montrond in Cher when it was besieged by royal troops under the Philippe de Cl√©rambault(fr), mar√©chal de Palluau. In Landes he participated under Colonel Balthazar in resistance to the followers of Mazarin. He became a captain of the guards of the Princess of Cond√©. He participated in the peace negotiations in B√®gles. De Baas was amnestied after the Fronde and maintained his rank as mar√©chal des camps et arm√©es du roi. During the Franco-Spanish War (1635‚Äì59) he took part in the Siege of Arras in 1654, then joined the Army of Italy. He was at the Siege of Pavia in 1655. On 8 November 1656 he was promoted to lieutenant general of the king's armies. He played a distinguished role in the war in Italy under the Francesco I d'Este, Duke of Modena, and then the Duke of Navailles(fr), until the war ended with the Treaty of the Pyrenees in November 1659. He was then made commander in chief of the French troops in Italy. Lieutenant-general of the Antilles =Appointment= On 1 February 1667 de Baas was appointed the king's lieutenant-general American Islands and mainland (lieutenant g√©n√©ral des √éles d'Am√©rique et de la Terre Ferme), to take effect after the recall of his predecessor Antoine Lef√®bvre de La Barre on 19 September 1668. He received the king's instructions for government of the Antilles by a letter of 16 September 1668 signed by the king's minister Jean-Baptiste Colbert . The appointment was made despite the fact that he was Protestant. De Baas arrived in Martinique with the squadron of Admiral Jean II d'Estr√©es, and registered his commission with the Sovereign Council of the island on 4 February 1669. =Policies= The instructions given to de Baas by Colbert were to favour the interests of the French West India Company, to eliminate foreign trade from the islands, particularly Dutch trade, to populate the islands and develop agriculture and trade, to place the islands in a permanent state of defense, to conquer foreign islands and strongholds, and to enforce the laws and ordinances of the kingdom, always with tact and gentleness. In the lead-up to the Franco-Dutch War of 1672‚Äì77 Colbert told de Baas it would greatly please Louis XIV if he could hamper the trade of the Dutch and drive them from their islands \\"if this were possible without encroaching directly on the treaties His Majesty has with them.\\" During his administration de Baas did much to improve the efficiency of the colony's administration, including taxation. He developed the first version of a capitation tax based on the number of residents of a home, slaves included. He continued the ban on lawyers in the islands, which lasted until 1710. He also banned militia officers from dispensing justice, although this continued in practice. De Baas had a low opinion of the Island Caribs and said they were \\"a people without faith and religion, who are more beasts than men...\\" He doubted that missionaries could achieve anything with such people. In early 1670 de Bass wrote that the Caribs wanted to fight the Dutch on Tobago. Colbert replied on 3 July 1670 that it would be useful to covertly assist the Caribs to prey upon Dutch commerce. In 1674 de Baas asked for 200 soldiers to either annihilate the Caribs on Dominica or make them galley slaves. Colbert refused, saying de Baas must seek a reconciliation with them. He was told that he should overawe the Caribs with French military power. De Baas came to agree that the Caribs had to be impressed by gifts and \\"good treatments\\". =Saint Christopher and Martinique= St Christophers. Fort Charles (English) is on the south coast of the west part. Basseterre (French), also on the south coast, is further east. 1656 map of Martinique, still divided between the French (west) and Caribs (east) De Baas decided that Saint Christopher Island was less important, and certainly less strategic, than Martinique, and moved the seat of the lieutenant general to Saint-Pierre, Martinique. Saint Christopher still had the largest French population in the Antilles, but the island was divided between the French and the English, which made expansion of the colony difficult. The French had both ends of the island, but the English had more land suitable for agriculture. After de Baas moved his headquarters to Martinique in 1669 the population and the level of sugar production on Saint Christopher slowly declined between 1671 and 1689. Since de Baas had little money, in 1674 the king gave him a house in Saint Pierre named Funds- Capot that had been confiscated from a Zeelander named Wassen. In February 1674 de Baas wrote to Colbert of the colonists living on Martinique, \\"...one need not worry about them dying of starvation in the absence of French merchant vessels, Monseigneur; in every month of the year, the habitants have local foodstuffs available to them ‚Äì peas of different kinds, manioc, yams, potatoes, as well as many delicious fruits. There is good water with which they make refreshing drinks;...\\" In 1676 he began to develop the colonial settlement at the strategically important site of Fort Royal. For three years Fran√ßois Rolle de Laubi√®re was local governor of Martinique under de Baas. Laubi√®re died in Fort-Royal, Martinique in February 1672. Antoine Andr√© de Sainte-Marthe was then appointed local governor of Martinique. He arrived in Saint Pierre on 28 December 1672. De Baas was not at first enthusiastic about the idea of a governor who was a complete stranger to the colony. However, in a letter to Colbert of 1 June 1673 he wrote that Sainte-Marthe had done his duty well, and was active and intelligent. =Recurrent food crises= In 1669 de Baas responded to an order to block trade with foreigners in goods and slaves by saying that it would not be practical to do so, although he would order the policy registered in Martinique. He asked that even the nominal ban be lifted in the case of African slaves, since they were essential to economic development. A royal ordinance of 10 June 1670 banned all trading between the French colonies in the Americas and foreign countries. That year de Baas reported that owing to lack of supplies from France the colonists of Guadeloupe and Martinique often traded in Barbados. In another food crisis in 1672 de Baas wrote that if \\"slaves lacked [imported] beef, then planters would lack slaves, because those slaves with the strength would flee plantations or desert, and those without, such as women and children, would weaken further and die\\". He went on to say of the wooden fort being built at Cul de Sac Royal (later Fort Royal) that \\"the slaves who serve the workers, having only manioc flour, are deserting, and the workers who have no meat cannot or will not continue to work. I have suspended the work until French merchants bring meat to our islands.\\" In his June 1673 letter to Colbert de Baas complained about the excessive prices of food sent from France. This inclined the people towards the Dutch, who had always treated them well. Work on Fort Royal was suspended again in 1674 for lack of food. In 1675 de Baas allowed an exemption to the ban on foreign trade in Martinique. He reported to France that due to shortage of food he had been forced to let four English vessels deliver supplies, and a few African slaves. In 1676 he reported that he had confiscated an English vessel trading in Martinique, but did not say what cargo it was carrying. =Franco-Dutch War (1672‚Äì77)= Dutch attack on Fort Royal (1674) In the second half of 1672 de Baas learned of the outbreak of the Franco-Dutch War, and began to organize an expedition against the Dutch base on Cura√ßao. He led the expedition against Cura√ßao early in 1673. The assault failed and on 18 March 1763 he ordered a retreat. De Baas and Sainte-Marthe successfully repulsed the Dutch fleet of Admiral Michiel de Ruyter during the attempted Invasion of Martinique (1674). The king ennobled Sainte-Marthe for his victory against the Dutch. De Baas continued as governor and lieutenant general after the French West India Company was dissolved in 1674. On 17 December 1676 d'Estr√©es appeared before Cayenne, and the next day defeated the Dutch defenders. He then sailed north to Martinique, where de Baas raised several hundred men as reinforcements and gave information about the Dutch in Tobago. D'Estr√©es continued to Tobago, where he made an unsuccessful attack in the First Battle of Tobago in February‚ÄìMarch 1677. De Baas was sick with dysentery for a long time. He died on 15 January 1677. Due to his religion he could not be buried in the cemetery but was buried on 16 January 1677 at his home, Fonds Capot, in what is now Bellefontaine. During his retreat to Grenada D'Estr√©es heard of the death of de Baas. Charles de Courbon de Bl√©nac was temporarily appointed his successor and returned to France with d'Estr√©es to have the appointment confirmed.

Matichon positions itself as a \\"quality\\" upmarket newspaper, as opposed to the usually sensationalist mass-circulation papers. In 1997, it had a daily circulation of about 120,000. It carries a strong focus on politics, and was, along with Thai Rath, among the country's most politically influential newspapers at the time. From the late 2000s, when successive political crises divided public opinion, Matichon has been criticized for harbouring a pro-Red Shirt bias. It has also been subject to controversies regarding its dismissal of editors, and a bribery investigation by the National Press Council of Thailand, for which the paper resigned from the council in protest. Matichon argued the investigation were irregular and that there was political interference in the council's activities.

Utermann currently serves as Governor of Birkbeck, University of London. http://www.bbk.ac.uk/news/new-governor-appointments-for- birkbeck Early life and education Andreas Utermann was born in Brussels to German parents and attended the European School before moving to the UK to study at the London School of Economics, from which he graduated with a degree in Economics in 1989. He subsequently undertook a master's degree in Economics at the University of Leuven, having agreed to defer his entry into Warburg's graduate programme for a year in order to do so. Utermann also holds the CFA's ASIP qualification. Career Utermann joined Mercury Asset Management in 1989, becoming head of pan-European and subsequently global equities over the course of his 13 years there. He left Merrill Lynch Investment Managers (as Mercury became known a couple of years after its 1997 acquisition by Merrill Lynch) in 2002. In 2002, Utermann joined Allianz to become its global CIO for equities. When Allianz's asset management division restructured in 2011, Utermann became Global CIO and co-head of Allianz Global Investors alongside Elizabeth Corley as CEO; in a 2012 media story headlined ‚ÄúMercury keeps rising at AllianzGI‚Äù, the journalist noted that the co-head structure followed ‚Äúthe mixed gender trail blazed by Carol Galley and Stephen Zimmerman, former co- heads of Mercury Asset Management, where both Utermann and Corley honed their craft.‚Äù Utermann was sole CEO since 2016, when Corley moved into a non- executive role within the firm. During his time in charge of Allianz Global Investors, Utermann expanded its investment offering further into bonds (for instance with the acquisition of Rogge Global Partners in early 2016) and creating a dedicated Alternative investments function.

The film was shot in towards the end of 1916, and was originally slated for a Spring or Summer 1917 release. However its release was delayed. The picture was shot at Metro's Rolfe Studios in New York. The film was Rankin's first with Metro, having come over from Vitagraph. In January 1917, Metro announced that film would be released on March 5, 1917. As late as March 3, the film was still scheduled for a March 5 release, however in mid- April 1918 Metro announced that the release date had been pushed back to May 13, 1918. The release was again pushed back to June 18, 1918, and then again to July 23. In early June 1919 Metro announced that the film was to be released on July 28. Reception The Film Daily panned the film, finding virtually no redeeming quality to it. They called it one of the \\"more and worse\\" films of the year. They found fault with the production, stating that \\"It was tiresome, slow, confusing, unreal, uninteresting -- and about everything else uncomplimentary that could be said.\\" They did, however, give one exemption, finding the work of Emmy Wehlen of note. Notes This was the final film of S. Rankin Drew, who left to join the Franco-American Air Corps after production on the film wrapped.

A PlayStation version was released in 1996 by Sierra On-Line. Gameplay NASCAR Racing was released in the fall of 1994 for DOS personal computers. It featured more than 25 of the 40 regular drivers in the 1994 NASCAR Winston Cup season. Notable absences included Dale Earnhardt (who would go on to win the Winston Cup that year), Bill Elliott, Dale Jarrett, Kyle Petty and Darrell Waltrip, although the latter's brother, Michael, was included. The game let the player race with up to 38 other cars (32 on shorter tracks like Bristol and Martinsville) and it also offered multiplayer action via direct links (one computer connected to another via a LAN) and also through an online system owned by Papyrus called Hawaii. The CD- ROM version of the game also offered a SVGA graphics mode which was accessible through the command prompt (by entering \\"nascar -h\\"), but it was too demanding for many of the computers of its age, mostly 486 and early Pentium PCs. hardware accelerated versions were later created and bundled with the Matrox Millennium and Diamond Edge 3D. Papyrus did produce a Daytona track only for use exclusively at a fan simulation game at the Daytona USA museum. In the PlayStation edition of the game, the player races as a rookie in the number 96 Papyrus car. Reception NASCAR Racing was a major commercial success. Its sales reached 350,000 units by December 1995, following its October 1994 release, and rose to 400,000 copies by February 1996. In the United States, NASCAR Racing (bundled with its Track Pack add-on) was the 24th best-selling computer game of 1998, with another 225,737 units sold. Its revenue for that year was estimated at $2.28 million. NASCAR Racing and its sequel shipped above 2 million copies globally by March 1998, and shipments of the first game alone surpassed 1 million units by 2004. Next Generation reviewed the PC version of the game, and stated that \\"it's the game's astounding ability to create a realistic feeling of speed that makes it an incredible hit. Flying around the tracks at 170 mph and up will make you respect those drivers who do this for a living. Definitely a winner.\\" Declaring it \\"the best racing game ever created\\", the editors of PC Gamer US presented NASCAR Racing with their 1994 \\"Best Sports Game\\" award, and nominated it in their \\"Best Simulation\\" category. NASCAR also won Computer Gaming Worlds 1994 \\"Simulation Game of the Year\\" award, tying with Aces of the Deep, and was a nominee for the magazine's overall \\"Game of the Year\\" prize. The editors opined that its \\"incredible graphics, sound and overall experience appeal to simulation enthusiasts and casual sports fans alike.\\" In 1996, Computer Gaming World declared NASCAR Racing the 31st-best computer game ever released. =PlayStation version= The PlayStation port divided reviewers. A Next Generation stated that \\"NASCAR Racing is for the die-hard stock car racing fan who loves NASCAR so much they don't care what kind of package it comes in.\\" He cited dull visuals, the lack of a multiplayer mode, and inadequate attempts at realism. In contrast, Jeff Kitts of GameSpot hailed it as \\"stock car racing at its most realistic\\", praising the authentic recreation of real life tracks, abundant options, realistic controls, and the accuracy of the PlayStation conversion. The two sports reviewers of Electronic Gaming Monthly held more of a middle ground position, with Dindo Perez saying that the PC version was a great title but had been surpassed in the years it took the game to reach the PlayStation, and Todd Mowatt remarking that \\"this game won't win the checkered flag this time around, but it won't run out of gas on you either.\\" Both commented that the frame rate and general excitement of the game were lacking. GamePros Dr. Zombie noted the realistic touches to the game and the merely adequate graphics, controls, and sounds, and concluded that \\"this game will appeal more to diehard racing aficionados than to the casual gamer cruising for speed and action.\\" Reviews *PC Gamer (Feb, 1995) - DOS version References External links *NASCAR Racing at MobyGames *NASCAR Racing (PlayStation) at MobyGames 1994 video games DOS games Mac OS games NASCAR video games Papyrus Design Group games PlayStation (console) games Racing simulators Racing video games Video games developed in the United States ","title":"NASCAR Racing (video game)"},{"id":"58374354","text":"Crassispira grignonensis is an extinct species of sea snail, a marine gastropod mollusk in the family Pseudomelatomidae, the turrids and allies.

Aynsley- Green is most notable for advancing the idea of the rights of children. He was appointed to the first Children's Commissioner for England in March 2005, serving in this position until 2009. During this time he launched an initiative to publicize and combat bullying. Life Aynsley-Green married Rosemary Anne Aynsley-Green n√©e Boucher in 1967 and has two children. Career Aynsley-Green started his clinical training at King's College London GKT School of Medical Education at the Guy's Hospital campus. Aynsley- Green then undertook research into Insulin secretion that led to a thesis, that earned him a promotion to D.Phil at the University of Oxford. Having decided to specialise in paediatrics, Aynsley-Green took his clinical training within the hospitals in Oxfordshire, and then moved to the University Children‚Äôs Hospital of Z√ºrich to take specialised training as a paediatric endocrinologist. After returning to the UK, Aynsley-Green was appointed as a clinical lecturer at the University of Oxford, and was then promoted to Fellow of Green College Oxford, with a position as university lecturer. In 1984, Aynsley-Green was appointed to the position of James Spence Professor of Child Health at Newcastle University. In 1993, Aynsley-Green was invited to take the Nuffield Chair of Child Health at the Institute of Child Health. With the position was an appointment as an Executive Director of clinical research and development at Great Ormond Street Hospital. NHS Taskforce for Children On 22 July 2000, Aynsley-Green and other colleagues published a paper in which it was argued that children were being ignored in future health plans that the then United Kingdom government was preparing, and that a strategy was needed that would enable children and adolescents to be represented at all levels of health policy. The paper contrasted that while in Scotland, a children's minister had been appointed and in Wales, a children's commissioner was being appointed during the life of the National Assembly for Wales, but in England, a fundamental cultural reorganisation was needed to be realised to benefit children's and adolescents at all levels of healthcare and policy. On 22 July 2001, Aynsley-Green was appointed to the UK director of children's health-care services by Alan Milburn of the First Blair ministry a position he held until December 2005, when the appointment was taken by Sheila Shribman. Milburn stated that Aynsley-Green's priority will be to spearhead the faster development of the first ever national standards for children's health services. In August 2001, Aynsley-Green called for the UK Government to create a Children's Commissioner for England. The role was entirely independent from government, with a statutory responsibility to speak for health and well-being needs of the children in England, numbering approximately 11 million. On 4 October 2004, Aynsley-Green and his colleagues published the National Service Framework for children. In March 2005, Aynsley-Green became the Children‚Äôs Commissioner for England, a position he held until 2010. To achieve the position, children had to be consulted and indeed was the overarching principal. Due to the children, the original name of the office was changed, from Office of the Children's Commissioner to 11 Million a relatively obscure name, but representative of the wishes of the children. Aynsley-Green also had to sit an exam that was written by and marked by the children. The process also included two interrogations by secondary school children. Aynsley-Green role was considered a controversial choice for the position and after being appointed to the role, he received significant negative press coverage, and considered enemy number one by the press. Catherine Bennett at the time, of The Observer criticised the bleak picture of English childhood that Aynsley- Green offered. Tony McNulty complained about Aynsley-Green opposition to stop and search and that he was wrong in his approach. John Reid Baron Reid of Cardowan, wrote the foreword. In 2008, as part of their remit, Aynsley-Green along with the other children's commissioners of the other nations of the United Kingdom, produced a report for the United Nations Committee on the Rights of the Children. Although the working of the four commissioners together was evidence that they were working to improve the life of children. The reports conclusion stated that some things had got worse for children since the Committee‚Äôs Concluding Observations of 2002. At the end of Aynsley- Green term as Children's Commissioner, he was interviewed by The Daily Telegraph, in 2010. In the interview Aynsley-Green posited that Britain was suffering a deep malaise and could be considered one of the most child hostile countries in the world. Aynsley-Green commented on The Mosquito device, essentially an ultrasonic weapon, used to stop children gathering. Aynsley- Green once headed a campaign to ban it, describing it as the most visible aspect of hostility to the young.

Activation can be imparted by modifications of the acyl or the alkoxy components of a normal ester, say ethyl acetate. Typical modifications call for electronegative substituents. Active esters are employed in both synthetic and biological chemistry. Acetyl CoA is the prototypical active ester in biosynthesis. Reactivity Active esters are mainly used as acylating agents. They undergo the same reactions as their unactivated analogues but do so more rapidly. They are prone to hydrolysis, for example. Of great interest is the enhanced reactivity of active esters toward amines to give amides. Examples Thioesters are prominent active esters, as illustrated by the esters of coenzyme A. In synthetic chemistry, active esters include derivatives of nitrophenols and pentafluorophenol. Active esters are often used in peptide synthesis, e.g., N-hydroxysuccinimide, hydroxybenzotriazole. Active esters of acrylic acid are precursors to polymers with reactive side chains. The concept of active esters extends to esters of phosphoric and sulfuric acids. One such case is dimethylsulfate, a strong methylating agent.

Early life and education  The daughter of Lancelot Stephen Bosanquet, a mathematics professor at University College London, and his wife Isabel Mary Linfoot, Caroline Bosanquet was born on 3 March 1940. She gained a Bachelor of Music degree from Durham University and studied cello and piano at the Royal Academy of Music, and later with Christopher Bunting.  Career  Bosanquet was active as a teacher throughout her career. She was particularly interested in incorporating Alexander Technique into her teaching, and published articles on its use in music education. In her late forties, she became interested in composition, and her music has been widely performed. Her most famous composition is her Elegy in memoriam Joan Dickson, which has been widely played due to its inclusion on the ABRSM cello Grade 8 syllabus. She was a member of staff at Cambridge College of Arts and Technology. = The Secret Life of Cello Strings = In 1996 Bosanquet published \\"The Secret Life of Cello Strings: Harmonics for Cellists\\", a method book designed to aid cellists in playing harmonics. In the introduction, Bosanquet stated that she was intrigued by the appearance of harmonics in places such as ‚Äúthe ethereal notes at the end of Bruch‚Äôs Kol Nidrei, the bell-like pentatonic notes in Dvorak‚Äôs Cello Concerto, the spectacular leaps in the second movement of Elgar‚Äôs Cello Concerto, the glissando harmonics in Shostakovich‚Äôs Cello Sonata, the march in Britten‚Äôs Cello Sonata and the magical sound of four-part cellos playing high-stopped harmonics in Arvo P√§rt‚Äôs Fratres; glissando stopped harmonics in the March of Britten's cello sonata; and sudden changes of pitch and colour on single notes in Webern's Three Pieces.‚Äù She took a logical and scientific approach to categorising the possible harmonics on the cello, possibly inspired by her father's related work in the field of Fourier transforms. The book guides the player progressively through the different harmonics that can be played, including maps of the nodes of the cello string.  Death  Bosanquet died of cancer, aged 72, on 20 January 2013.

For a period of time, their mother, Grand Duchess Anna Vasilyevna, sister of Duke Ivan III of Moscow, ruled the duchy as regent. On August 19, 1496, Grand Duke Ivan Vasilyevich concluded an agreement with his brother, Prince Fyodor, according to which Prince Fyodor promised to never betray his brother and always assist in his politics; both must avoid military attacks on each other's lands. The agreement implied that if Grand Duke Ivan Vasilyevich died childless, the throne would pass to his brother, Fyodor, while if the latter died childless, his appanages would pass to his elder brother. Their mother, Grand Duchess Anna Vasilyevna was to receive a quarter of all income from both brother's domains. The court servants were also divided between the brothers. The agreement also prohibited either of the brothers to purchase or mortgage each other's inhabited localities.

Relations with Moscow  Ivan IV of Ryazan continued his father's politics of loyalty towards Moscow. On June 9, 1483, he concluded a treaty with his maternal uncle, Grand Duke Ivan III of Moscow, which, as a matter of fact, put the Duchy of Ryazan in the position of a vassal principality. Dmitry Ilovayski argued that the position of the Grand Duke of Ryazan under this treaty was similar to a viceroy, rather than a ruler. Ivan IV of Ryazan obliged himself to never betray Grand Duke of Moscow, seek alliances or vassalage to the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, or negotiate with the princes who escaped there. The relationships with Tatar princes were also to be in accordance with Moscow, while the Grand Duke of Ryazan, was to pursue and capture the fugitive princes of Meshchera. By that treaty the Grand Duchy of Ryazan lost many lands. Ivan IV of Ryazan had to admit the towns of Teshilov, Venyov and Rostovets as domains of Moscow, and never attempt to invade Yelets. Upon the order of Ivan III of Moscow, Ivan IV of Ryazan had to send his troops to assist in military campaigns. In 1492‚Äì1494, Ryazanian troops took part in capturing the Principality of Vyazma and a number of Upper Oka towns. In 1493 Ryazanian troops headed by Prince Fyodor Vasilyevich and his warlord Ivan Inka Izmaylov had to capture Serpeysk and Mezetsk for Moscow, taken by Lithuanians prior to it. As a result, Ryazanian lands on the west faced multiple attacks from Lithuania. In the peace treaty with the Grand Duke of Lithuania, Alexander, of January‚ÄìFebruary 1494, Ivan IV of Ryazan declared that he was vassal to Moscow and his lands should not be invaded as if lands of a sovereign prince.  Family  Ivan IV of Ryazan was married to Princess Agrafena (Agrippina) Vasilyevna Babich-Drutskaya, daughter of Prince Vasily Ivanovich of Drutsk, on July 13, 1485, in Pereyaslavl of Ryazan. The wedding was conducted by the Bishop of Ryazan Simeon. His spouse was related to Polish King Casimir IV through her mother. In the marriage they had a son, Ivan, who succeeded the throne of Ryazan. The latest genealogies claim he had two more sons, Vasily and Fyodor, who are not acknowledged by the respected historians. Because of the shortcomings of the agreement of 1496, his brother, Prince Fyodor (d. 1503), bequeathed his appanage to Grand Duke of Moscow, Ivan III.

Its farmhouse, dating to the 1760s, was home to American Revolutionary War general John Fellows. The property was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2018. Description and history The Fellows Farmstead is located in a rural setting of southwestern Sheffield, on the east side of Barnum Road north of Foley Road. The property is in size, a combination of open fields and woodlands. The main house is a single-pile 2-1/2 story wood-frame structure, with a gabled roof, central chimney, and clapboarded exterior. The rear roof face has a shallower pitch than the front, and extends down to the first floor, giving the house a classic New England saltbox profile. The rear leanto appears to be an integral part of the house's original construction. The main facade is three bays wide, with sash windows placed symmetrically around a wide center entrance. A single-story ell extends to the left side. The interior retains many original finishes, including carved moulding and paneling. The house was long believed to have been built in 1737 for Captain John Fellows, who moved to the area from Pomfret, Connecticut. However, dendochronological investigation as part of the National Register of Historic Places nomination determined the house dates to the 1760s. Captain Fellows' son John, who likely built the house, achieved notice as a leader of the Massachusetts militia during the American Revolutionary War, serving in the New York and New Jersey campaign under George Washington in 1776, and in the 1777 Saratoga campaign. At the time of its listing on the National Register in 2018, the property was still owned by descendants of the family who have owned it since the early 19th century.

He broke the world altitude record for hang gliding by launching from a helium balloon at 35,000 ft, and spent a year at the Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station, which was documented in his book One Day, One Night: Portraits of the South Pole.  Early career  Bird‚Äôs career started as the youngest NASA-accredited journalist covering the Apollo 13 launch. Bird broke the world altitude record for hang gliding by piloting a hang glider from a helium balloon at 35,000‚Äô. The Guinness Book of Records, 1987, p254.  Education  Bird began his Ph.D. at NASA Marshall Spaceflight Center, studying the aurora. He went on to study the atmosphere with wide angle interferometers at York University under Gordon G. Shepherd, where he was awarded a Ph.D. for developing a polarizing version of an optical interferometer. The Polarizing Atmospheric Michelson Interferometer, PAMI, developed by Bird, was discussed in Spectral Imaging of the Atmosphere. It employs a polarization tuning technique with no internal moving parts, instead scanning with a polarizer external to the interferometer. The PAMI was demonstrated in an observation campaign where its performance was compared to a Fabry-Perot spectrometer, and employed to measure E-region winds. During post-doctoral studies with the University of Waterloo, Bird trained with the astronauts in zero-g aircraft to investigate laser interactions with materials in zero-gravity.  Scientific research  Bird went on to study the arctic atmosphere with a LIDAR system including measurements of aerosols, chlorine monoxide, and ozone. He was selected to spend a year at the Amundsen-Scott South Pole station, to study the aurora and upper atmosphere. Bird‚Äôs South Pole Pendulum Project (as discussed in The New York Times and excerpted from Seven Tales of the Pendulum) ‚Äúis probably the closest ever made to one of the earth's poles. The pendulum was erected in a six-story staircase of a new station that was under construction near the pole. The new station offered an ideal venue for the Foucault pendulum; its height ensured an accurate result, no moving air could disturb it, and low air pressure reduced air resistance. The researchers confirmed about 24 hours as the rotation period of the plane of oscillation.‚Äù His Antarctica adventures were documented in his book, One Day, One Night: Portraits of the South Pole, which won honorable mention for nonfiction at the 2016 New York Book Festival, and was a finalist at the 2017 Next Generation Indie Book Awards.

She was raised and educated in Hilo and Honolulu and served as a maid of honor and lady-in-waiting of Queen Emma, the wife of Kamehameha IV. In 1861, she left for the United States with her family, and she lived for the next twenty years in New England. She visited her distant cousin King KalƒÅkaua during his state visit to the United States in 1875. She returned in 1881 to Hawai ªi where she married musician John Keakaokalani Ailau, better known as Jack Ailau. In later life, she invested in Hawaiian curio shops selling artifacts of Hawaiiana; many of her collections are preserved in the Bernice Pauahi Bishop Museum. Early life and family Portrait of Pitman and her brother Henry by John Mix Stanley (1849) Born in Hilo, on the island of Hawai ªi, Pitman was the eldest child and only daughter of Benjamin Pitman and Kino ªoleoliliha, a high chiefess of Hilo. She has been said to have been born either in 1838; ; ; ; or March 1841. In the Hawaiian language, her name Kino ªole means \\"thin\\" or \\"without body.\\" Her father, a native of Salem, Massachusetts, was an early pioneer, businessman and sugar- and coffee-plantation owner on the island of Hawai ªi who profited greatly from the kingdom's booming whaling industry in the early 1800s. Her mother was a descendant of Kame ªeiamoku, one of the royal twins (with Kamanawa) who advised Kamehameha I in his conquest of the Hawaiian Islands, and also of the early American or English sea captain Harold Cox, who lent his name to George \\"Cox\\" Kahekili Ke ªeaumoku II, the Governor of Maui.; ; ; Her maternal grandfather Ho ªolulu, along with his brother Hoapili, helped conceal the bones of King Kamehameha I in a secret hiding place after his death. Her siblings were Henry Ho ªolulu Pitman (1845‚Äì1863), Benjamin Franklin Keolaokalani Pitman (1852‚Äì1918), half-sister Maria Kino ªole Pitman Morey (1858‚Äì1892) and half- brothers Charles Brooks Pitman (1860‚Äì1918) and Harold Albert Pitman (1865‚Äì1948).; ; Because of her father's success in business and her mother's descent from Hawaiian royalty, the family was considered quite prosperous and were host to the royal family when they visited Hilo. Besides being one of the leading merchants in town, her father also served the government as district magistrate of Hilo. Kino ªole had inherited control over much of the lands in Hilo and ≈åla ªa from her own father, and King Kamehameha III had granted her use of the ahupua ªa (traditional land division) of Hilo after her marriage. During Mary Pitman's early childhood, the family lived in the mansion that Benjamin Pitman had built in 1840 in an area known as Niopola, one of the favored resort spots of ancient Hawaiian royalty. The residence became known as the Spencer House after Benjamin Pitman sold it to his business partner Captain Thomas Spencer. In the 1850s the family moved to Honolulu, where Benjamin Pitman took up banking and built a two-story house that he named Waialeale (\\"rippling water\\") at the corner of Alakea and Beretania Streets. Education and role in royal court left While in Hawai ªi, Pitman and her brother Henry attended the children's school in Hilo run by Lucy Sheldon Taylor Wetmore, the wife of American missionary doctor and government physician Charles Hinckley Wetmore. The school was located at the Wetmores' residence on Church Street. Taught by Wetmore, who had come to Hawai ªi in 1848 with the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions (ABCFM) and started the school in April 1850, the two elder Pitman children received their education in English rather than Hawaiian. At the time all of the other schools in Hilo were conducted in Hawaiian. Wetmore taught the children reading, writing, spelling, arithmetic and singing, while also reinforcing the curriculum with a strong adherence to the principles of the Protestant faith. Like the Pitman siblings, many of their classmates were of half-Hawaiian (hapa-kanaka) descent, with a majority of them being Chinese-Hawaiians (hapa- pake). She was also educated in private schools in Honolulu. In her youth, Pitman was known as the \\"Belle of Hilo Bay.\\" She became a intimate friend of Emma Rooke, who became Kamehameha IV's queen. Alongside Princess Victoria KamƒÅmalu and Lydia Kamaka ªeha PƒÅkƒ´ (the future Queen Lili ªuokalani), she served as a maid of honor in the royal wedding of Kamehameha IV and Queen Emma on June 19, 1856.; ; ; She also served as one of the ladies-in-waiting of the queen in the young court of the royal couple. Writing in 1910, historian Albert Pierce Taylor, who married Pitman's relative Emma Ahuena Taylor, said, \\"Miss Pittman [sic] was considered a very beautiful girl, her complexion being marvelously clear.\\" Massachusetts After the death of Pitman's mother, Kino ªole, in 1855, her father married Maria Louisa Walsworth Kinney, the widow of American missionary Rev. Henry Kinney. The Kinneys were part of the Twelfth Company of missionaries from the ABCFM to arrive in 1848. The marriage aligned the Pitman children with the American missionary community; they were called \\"cousins\\" by the children of the missionaries and considered part of the extended missionary family of Hawai ªi. Kinney died in 1858 after giving birth to their father's fourth child, a daughter named Maria Kino ªole (1858‚Äì1892). The family moved to Massachusetts in 1861 after her father married his third wife, Martha Ball.; ; ; They traveled to the United States with British traveler Sophia Cracroft and her aunt, Lady Jane Franklin, who was searching around the world for her husband's lost expedition. According to a letter by Cracroft, the Pitmans left for San Francisco on June 25, 1861, aboard the ship Comet with Cracroft and Franklin and the elder Pitman \\"now has a third wife with a baby [Charles Brook Pitman].\\" Cracroft wrote that Mary Pitman \\"is very dark‚Äîi.e. her Hawaiian descent is perfectly evident, though she has much of the American character in feature.\\" The family lived in the Massachusetts towns of Roxbury and Somerville. Her siblings continued their education in their new home and Pitman finished hers in a Boston-area school. Henry Pitman fought for the Union Army in the American Civil War from 1862 to 1863 and died after being released from Libby Prison. The Pitmans also lived in Germany for a period of time. By 1875, Pitman was living in New Bedford while her father and his third wife were in Europe.; ; She was noted for her swimming abilities, which attracted much attention when she visited sea bathing spots on the New England coast. During the state visit of King KalƒÅkaua to the United States, she called on the king when he arrived in New Bedford on January 1, 1875. She was escorted by the king at an afternoon dinner reception at the Parker House, which was attended by 60 guests. The following day, she paid a morning visit to the king at his hotel in Boston, where she had breakfast with KalƒÅkaua. The Boston Daily Globe wrote of her: \\"Miss Mary Pitman of New Bedford, who is of the blood royal, and who claims as good a right to the Hawaiian throne as the reigning monarch.\\" She and KalƒÅkaua were distant cousins, both descending from Kame ªeiamoku.  Return to Hawai ªi  Pitman in later life Pitman returned to live in Hawai ªi in 1881. She married John Keakaokalani Ailau (1855‚Äì1894) around 1883. Better known as Jack Ailau, her husband was a newspaper printer, musician and member of the Hawaiian Quintet Club. They had no children although she had an adopted daughter. He died of heart disease on January 17, 1894, while they were visiting San Francisco during the California Midwinter International Exposition of 1894. For the 1883 coronation of KalƒÅkaua and Queen Kapi ªolani, Pitman and Princess Po ªomaikelani, the queen's sister, helped fashion  ªahu ªula (feather cloaks) and kƒÅhili (feather standards) for the ceremony. The two women used goose and duck feathers dyed in the colors of the extinct or endangered native birds originally used to fabricate the cloaks. Many of these pieces are now preserved in the Kalaniana ªole Collection at the Bernice Pauahi Bishop Museum. From her marriage to her final illness, Pitman collected and sold goods and artifacts of Hawaiiana in curio stores in Honolulu and Hilo. At Hilo, she partnered with the \\"Victor girls\\" in a curio shop located on Pitman Street near the Hilo Hotel. Many of her wares and artifacts are now in the Bishop Museum. Pitman died from an attack of apoplexy, on February 11, 1905, at the home of Cecelia Neilson Arnold, the mother of future Honolulu mayor Charles N. Arnold. She had suffered a stroke two years before from which she had never fully recovered. Two weeks before her death, she became ill with influenza, and she suffered a second stroke on the left side of her body a week before her death. Her funeral was held the following afternoon at the Arnold residence and she was buried at the Homelani Cemetery in Hilo.; ; ; ; ; A memorial service was held at St. Andrew's Cathedral in Honolulu on February 24, 1905. In 1917, her younger brother Benjamin Keolaokalani Pitman and his wife Almira Hollander Pitman returned to Hawai ªi for a visit. The Hawaiian press covered the visit heavily as well as the history of the family. The Honolulu Star-Bulletin wrote that Pitman \\"was acknowledged to be one of the brightest women Hawaii has produced.\\" Notes References Bibliography ;Books and journals     ;Newspapers and online sources       19th-century births 1905 deaths Hawaiian nobility Hawaiian ladies-in-waiting People from Hilo, Hawaii People from Honolulu People from Roxbury, Boston People from Somerville, Massachusetts People from New Bedford, Massachusetts ","title":"Mary Pitman Ailau"},{"id":"58375902","text":"Karim David Adeyemi (born 18 January 2002) is a German professional footballer who plays as a striker for Red Bull Salzburg in the Austrian Football Bundesliga.

She was a winner of a 2017 British Composer Award.  Education  Pritchard trained as a double bassist and composer, firstly at the Guildhall School of Music and Drama, before completing an MMus at the Royal Academy of Music, where she studied with Simon Bainbridge, and a DPhil at Worcester College, Oxford where she studied with Robert Saxton.  Career  Her work received early attention following the inclusion of her piece Chanctonbury Ring on the album \\"The Hoxton Thirteen\\", released by NMC Recordings in 2001. Her music has since been released by labels including Signum and Nimbus. Her music has been commissioned and premiered by ensembles including the London Symphony Orchestra, the London Sinfonietta, the BBC National Orchestra of Wales, Royal Northern Sinfonia, Philharmonia Orchestra, BBC Singers, Choir of New College, Oxford, Christ Church Cathedral Choir, Allegri String Quartet, English String Orchestra, Orchestra of the Swan and Composers Ensemble. She was composer in residence at the 2016 Lichfield Festival.  Synaesthesia  Pritchard experiences synaesthesia, specifically perceiving sound as colour, light and darkness. In her own words; > \\"Ever since I was a small child, I‚Äôve been aware that some harmonies seemed > warm whilst others appeared cold. The relationship between colours and > intervals seemed so natural to me that I didn‚Äôt question it ... When I > engage with colour, light and darkness in my work, I become aware of a > broader emotional content and hope to illuminate some kind of beauty to the > listener.\\" Pritchard frequently paints visualisations of her musical works, and has also been commissioned by the London Sinfonietta to paint visual guides of works by other composers (such as Gy√∂rgy Ligeti, Unsuk Chin and Thomas Ad√®s) for inclusion in concert programme notes. Her visualisations and music maps were exhibited at the Royal Academy of Music's Amazing Women of the Academy exhibition from 2018-2019. In 2020 she was commissioned a graphic score Colour Circle by the London Sinfonietta to launch their Postcard Pieces project over lockdown, inspired by Wassily Kandinsky's book Concerning the Spiritual in Art.  Works inspired by visual art  Pritchard has written several works in response to paintings by Maggi Hambling, having collaborated with the artist at her studio in Suffolk. The first of these was the violin concerto Wall of Water (2014), which was premiered by violinist Harriet Mackenzie and the English String Orchestra during the Frieze Art Fair in London. Images of Hambling's series of seascape paintings, also titled Wall of Water, were projected during the performance. Subsequent pieces written in response to Hambling's work were Waves and Waterfalls (2015) for chamber ensemble, commissioned by the London Sinfonietta, and Edge (2017), a double concerto for violin, harp and string orchestra, after Hambling's paintings on the theme of global warming, which was premiered at the Aldeburgh Festival. In 2020 Pritchard wrote a solo violin piece for Harriet Mackenzie called March 2020 in response to Hambling's painting of the same name, with both works written in lockdown.

As a result of the battle, Arcadia, the heartland of the Morea, came firmly under Byzantine control. Background From on, the Latin Principality of Achaea, which controlled most of the Morea (Peloponnese) peninsula in southern Greece, entered a period of instability, as the princely title was disputed by multiple claimants. A Catalan invasion in 1315 in support of the claims of Isabella of Sabran was defeated at the Battle of Manolada in 1316, but Prince Louis of Burgundy died soon after, leaving his title contested between his wife, Matilda of Hainaut, the Angevins of Naples, who as the Principality's liege lords forced her to marry the Angevin John of Gravina, and Louis' brother Odo IV, Duke of Burgundy. An Angevin baillie, Frederick Trogisio, was sent to govern the Principality in 1318, but it was not until 1322 that the matter was settled, with Odo's claims bought by the Angevins and Matilda effectively confined in Naples. In contrast to the turmoils of the Principality of Achaea, the Byzantine province of Mystras, encompassing the southeastern Morea, during the same period (1316‚Äì) came under the steady and effective governance of Andronikos Asen, a nephew of the Byzantine emperor Andronikos II Palaiologos. A capable leader, Asen pursued the perennial war against the Latins of Achaea with considerable vigour. Asen's 1320 campaign and the battle at Saint George castle According to the French and Aragonese versions of the Chronicle of the Morea, in 1320 Asen launched a campaign into Arcadia, the central region of the Morea, and laid siege to the castle of Saint George in Skorta. The castle had been built by the Latins in the early 1290s, and was part of a chain of fortresses guarding the passes of the mountains of Skorta. It had already been lost to the Byzantines by treachery in , and recovered by the Latins at some unknown date after. In response, the baillie Trogisio assembled an army to relieve the castle, calling on the vassals of the principality for assistance: among them were the Bishop of Olena, James of Cyprus, the Grand Constable Bartholomew II Ghisi, and the commanders of the Knights of St. John and of the Teutonic Knights in Achaea. Learning of the Latins' approach, Asen intensified the siege, and on 9 September, its Greek castellan, Nicoloucho of Patras, surrendered. Taking possession, Asen left the banners of Achaea flying, so as to mislead the relief force. The ruse succeeded, and as the Achaean army approached the castle in the belief that it was still held by their allies and that the Byzantines had abandoned the siege, Asen sprang his trap. The Byzantines were victorious in the battle, and killed many of the Latins, including the commander of the Teutonic Knights. Many others were taken prisoner, including Bartholomew Ghisi and the Bishop of Olena. The latter was immediately set free, while Ghisi and the rest were taken to Constantinople. In the same campaign ‚Äî the Aragonese and French versions disagree on whether this happened before or after the siege of Saint George ‚Äî the Byzantines went on to secure, by bribing their commandants, the castles of Karytaina, Akova, and Polyphengos. Aftermath Asen's 1320 campaign secured the Arcadian plateau for the Byzantines, and reduced the Principality of Achaea to the western and northern coasts of the Morea, encompassing the modern prefectures of Messenia, Elis, Achaea, Corinthia, and Argolis. The fortresses that for fifty years had formed a defensive bulwark against the Byzantine endeavours to expand their province were now lost. At this time, many of the Latin settlers in Arcadia, many of whom may have had Greek mothers, abandoned the Catholic Church and went over to Greek Orthodoxy. The Byzantine successes, and the manifest inability of their Angevin suzerains to protect them, led the leading barons of the principality to send the Franciscan prior Peter Gradenigo to the Doge of Venice in June 1321, offering the principality, as well as the suzerainty over the Lordship of Negroponte, to the Republic of Venice. Nothing came of these proposals, but a new Angevin baillie, Ligorio Guindazzo, arrived some time in 1321. His tenure was brief‚Äîabout a year‚Äîand unremarkable. During the same time, John of Gravina began preparing an expedition to the Morea, but it was not until January 1325 that the Prince of Achaea left Italy for his principality, with 25 galleys, 400 cavalry, and 1,000 infantry. He occupied Cephalonia and restored Angevin control over Achaea, as the barons and vassal lords of Latin Greece came to pay him homage, but his attempt to recapture Karytaina failed due to the energetic resistance of its garrison, the raids launched by the Byzantine governor into Latin territories, and the approach of winter. In spring 1326, John of Gravina again departed the Morea, leaving its governance once again to short-lived baillies. The Duke of Naxos, Nicholas I Sanudo, whom John of Gravina left in charge of military operations, managed to defeat a larger Byzantine army raiding the principality in a hard-fought battle soon thereafter, but this was not enough to check Byzantine power in the Morea in the long term.

It aims at denouncing the absence or under-representation of women in contemporary culture. This includes influence and power dynamics in politics, economics and media.  Techniques  The group's origin is grounded in the feminist movement of the 1960s and 1970s. The movement adopted the techniques of irony and surprise demonstrations. The members disrupt assemblies composed mostly of men. They appear wearing false beards and congratulating men for their resistance to feminizing influences. The choice of the assemblies is to remind women that they should be able to create, manage and represent by obtaining access to all positions and responsibilities, in all domains.  History  Action of the feminist group La Barbe in Paris The group emerged during the 2007 French presidential elections. Some advocates of S√©gol√®ne Royal were shocked by sexist allusions directed towards her. The group gathered around Marie de Cenival, a former Act UP-Paris activist, gathering women who were not deeply involved in an association or a feminist movement before. In October 2008, \\"twenty active members, thirty sympathizers\\" according to Liberation, were members of the group. In March 2010 fifty members were enlisted. The name of the group was a reference to the beard, as symbol of the masculinity, and to the familiar French interjection \\"La barbe!\\" meaning \\"Enough!\\" Their first public demonstration took place on February 28, 2008, during a signing session of the √âric Zemmour at Drugstore Publicis in Paris. According to the Le Nouvel Observateur, La Barbe is legally founded as non-profit association on March 8, 2008 for international women's day. The group demonstrated in Paris with Act Up-Paris and the Panth√®res roses, attaching a beard to one of the statues on the Place de la R√©publique.Barbe d'or diploma - La Barbe Toulouse The group appeared during the 2000s, marked by a new generation of feminists with the creation of the associations Ni putes ni soumises in 2003 and Osez le f√©minisme in 2009 or Les TumulTueuses in 2010. In the media, the creation of the magazine Causette in 2009 is a testimony of the renewal of feminism in France. Joy Sorman stated, ‚Äúthese collectives are living proof of the renewal of political activism among the younger generations\\".

Early life Theodosia Blachford was born Theodosia Tighe in 1744 in Rosanna, County Wicklow. She was the only daughter of the four children of William Tighe and his first wife Lady Mary Tighe of Rathmore, County Meath. Her three full brothers were William, Edward, and Richard. Her maternal grandparents were John Bligh, 1st Earl of Darnley and Theodosia Bligh, 10th Baroness Clifton. Lady Tighe died when Blachford was young, and her father went on to marry the heiress Margaret Theaker, through whom she had a half-brother, Thomas, and half-sister, Barbara. Initially the relationship between Blachford and her stepmother was difficult, but improved over time. Blachford was considered an intelligent child, well-read and seen to have largely educated herself using her father's library. Aside from her self-directed education, Blachford spent much of her childhood caring for her father while he suffered from gout. She was raised in the Church of Ireland, but was inspired to find a new religion at age of 17, leading her to read extensively on religious matters and to \\"renounce the world.\\" Marriage and conversion to Methodism In 1770 she married Rev. William Blachford, prebendary to Tassasagart. Rev. Blachford was a librarian to St Patrick's and the Marsh libraries in Dublin. She was widowed in May 1773, and was left with a young son and daughter. She oversaw the education of her daughter, Mary Tighe, who grew up to be a poet. Around 1775 she converted to Methodism, this was potentially driven by her bereavement or through the influence of Agnes Smyth. She attended the Whitefriar Street Church, and given her position in society was a prominent figure in the Dublin Methodist community. In June 1788, John Wesley called her \\"one of our jewels\\" in correspondence. Blachford wrote a number of religious tracts and translated the life of Jane Frances de Chantal, founder of the Visitation Order. Her sister-in-law, Sarah Tighe (1743‚Äì1820), also converted to Methodism. Philanthropy Though Blachford was relatively wealthy, she lived a frugal life, donating much of her extra income to charity. She donated to the Magadalen Asylum on Leeson Street, and was involved in the foundation of the Female Orphan House in 1790 and the House of Refuge on Baggot Street in 1802. Both were founded to assist homeless and unemployed young women. She is also believed to have personally educated a number of impoverished girls. She referred to this work as a \\"providential blessing\\" that \\"saves me from stupid indolence\\". Later life and death She did not approve of her daughter's marriage to her first cousin Henry Tighe, and strongly disapproved of her frivolous lifestyle. Regardless, she spent a large amount of her time in England with her daughter, nursing her through a long illness and eventual death of tuberculosis in 1810. She briefly outlived her son John, dying on 9 November 1817. It is unknown where she is buried. Her correspondence with her children is held in the National Library of Ireland.

The forest covers 2,979 hectares (7,361 acres) and reaches an elevation of 563 meters (1,847 feet).  Flora and fauna  The forest hosts 277 plant species, among which pine trees (Pinus brutia, Pinus pinea, and Pinus halepensis) are dominant. There are also scattered cypress (Cupressus sempervirens), plane trees (Platanus orientalis), and many species of Populus. Kedrinos Lofos is also home to a rich variety of fauna. Mammals include hares, foxes, martens, squirrels, weasels, and hedgehogs. Around 80 types of birds frequent the forest, chief among them the short-toed snake eagle, the common cuckoo, nightingales, the rock partridge, owls, and the song thrush. Salamanders, frogs, turtles, grass snakes, and lizards are the most common amphibians and reptiles.  Etymology  The southwestern portion of the forest was originally called Chilia Dentra (), or Thousand Trees, as it was one of the parts that was spared deforestation during the Ottoman period. It was during the Ottoman period that the area received the name , or ≈ûeyh Su in the modern Turkish alphabet, meaning . The name is derived from a spring located near a mausoleum within the forest. The name has since entered the Greek language as (Œ£Œ≠Œπœá Œ£ŒøœÖ). It received its current name of Kedrinos Lofos (), or Cedar Hill, in 1987 when a local author, Georgios Vafopoulos, suggested it in Thessaloniki's city council. The name Kedrinos is a play on a Byzantine-era historian, George Kedrenos, who wrote extensively on the forest and on the word 'cedar'.  History  View from the hill's forest Theatro Dasous Zoo park Originally, the area was an oak (primarily Quercus pubescens) forest that was the source of all the rivers that ran through the city of Thessaloniki and ultimately emptied into the Thermaic Gulf. During the Ottoman era, logging, grazing, and farming contributed to the deforestation of the area. In 1921, a decision was made to reforest the area by the Hellenic Ministry of Agriculture. This project was undertaken by the Forestry School of the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, which planted nearly 5 million trees between 1929 and 1989. In 1982 a small fire broke out in the forest. On July 7, 1997, a large fire broke out and burned 55% of the forest down over a period of 60 hours. Two large reforestation projects took place in 1998 and 2000, but most of the reforestation has been natural. As of 2010, 36.4% still remains clear of trees.  Sites  The forest is home to Thessaloniki's main zoo, its natural history museum, two amphitheatrical open-air theaters overlooking the city (Theatro Dasous or Forest Theater and Theatro Gaias or Earth Theater), hiking and biking trails, and two lookout points that overlook the city.  Issues  The pine trees have suffered from an infestation of the pine processionary, which has led to defoliation and to calls for greater variety in the forest's flora. Thessaloniki's heavily congested ring road abuts the southern side of the forest.

The earliest surviving poetic literature found in the Burmese language dates from between 1450 and 1550, and is largely in the form of pyo.  Format  Pyo follows classical Burmese verse, employing lines of four syllables with rhymes \\"climbing\\" from the end towards the beginning of successive lines. An entire pyo work may be divided into 200 to 300 verses, with an average of 30 to 35 four-syllable lines each. Poets employed many devices to overcome the four-syllable requirements, including use of repetition and rhyme. The pyo is generally written in a combination of two styles; parts of the poem are written in a plainspoken style and other passages are written in a more ornate and complex style, which weave in metaphors, similes, and allusions.  Subjects  The majority of pyo narrate episodes from the Buddha's life or adapt the Buddha's birth stories (JƒÅtaka), while a minority document historical events or Buddhist principles and philosophy.  Notable composers and works  Pyo were largely composed by Buddhist monks who worked in service of Burmese court. However, according to extant evidence, laypersons also began composing pyo from the 1570s onward. Shin Ra·π≠·π≠hasƒÅra's 1523 Kogan Pyo () based on the HatthipƒÅla JƒÅtaka, is among the most widely known pyo in modern-day Myanmar, and is taught in Burmese schools. Shin Maha Silavamsa, wrote two pyo based on Buddha's previous rebirth as Sumedha Buddha, while Shin Aggasamadhi wrote three pyo based on the Nemi JƒÅtaka. Shin Silavamsa's Hsudaungkhan Pyo (; based on the Sumedhapandita JƒÅtaka) and Shin Ra·π≠·π≠hasƒÅra's Buridat Pyo (; based on the Bh≈´ridatta JƒÅtaka) are considered exemplars of the medieval literary style, and are treated as masterpieces of Burmese classical poetry. The First Nawade was the first layperson to compose pyo in the 1570s, basing his Manohari Pyo (·Äô·Äî·Ä±·Ä¨·Äü·Äõ·ÄÆ·Äï·Äª·Ä≠·ÄØ·Ä∑) on one of the Pa√±√±ƒÅsa JƒÅtakas. All lay pyo poets had significant studies at monastic colleges. Padethayaza expanded the repertoire of subjects used in pyo, composing poems based on Hindu tales and historical events, such as the arrival of Thai envoys at the Burmese court in 1746 in the Yodaya Thanyauk Pyo.

They were the first robots in history that were programmed to \\"think\\" the way biological brains do and meant to have free will. Ingalis-Arkell, Esther \\"The Very First Robot Brains Were Made of Old Alarm Clocks\\", 07 March 2012. Elmer and Elsie were often labeled as tortoises because of how they were shaped and the manner in which they moved. They were capable of phototaxis which is the movement that occurs in response to light stimulus. [Norman, Jeremy, \\"The First Electronic Autonomous Robots: the Origin of Social Robotics (1948 ‚Äì 1949)\\", Jeremy Norman & Co., Inc., 02004-2018.  Description  Elmer and Elsie, or the \\"tortoises\\" as they were known, were constructed between 1948 and 1949 using war surplus materials and old alarm clocks. They had a single light or touch sensor hooked up to two different paths that ran two different motors acting as two separate neuron brains. The robots had a plastic shell which was phototropic in that it could follow light and act as a bumper sensor. Walter stressed the importance of using purely analogue electronics to simulate brain processes at a time when his contemporaries such as Alan Turing, John von Neumann and Norbert Wiener were all turning towards a view of mental processes in terms of digital computation. Findery, \\"Elmer and Elsie\\", 2bkco, Inc., 2012-2018 The robots were designed to show the interaction between both light-sensitive and touch-sensitive control mechanisms which were basically two nerve cells with visual and tactile inputs. These systems interacted with the motor drive in such a way that the tortoises were actually finding their way around obstacles. Bristol Robotics Laboratory, \\"Grey Walter and his tortoises\\", University of Bristol News, 22 July 2008. They were allowed to randomly wander around the floor in no specific pattern and when they were presented with two light sources equally distanced from their sensor, they'd head towards whichever light they saw as a consistent part of the scanning process. In one experiment a light was placed on the nose of one of the tortoises. It appeared that the robot was looking at itself in a mirror. Its light began flickering and the robot started shaking as if excited to see itself in the mirror. Walter argued that if this behavior were seen in an animal it \\"might be accepted as evidence of some degree of self-awareness.\\" When presented with certain stimuli, even outside of their programmed range of experience, they responded consistently, as if they had a personality. They had their quirks and odd behaviors the way living things do. Using the only two neurons that they exhibited much of the same behaviors and oddities that any biological beings have.  Legacy  Elmer and Elsie inspired later generations of robotics researchers such as Rodney Brooks, Hans Moravec and Mark Tilden. Rodney Brooks' \\"Intelligence without Representation\\" is in many ways a modern take on Elmer and Elsie. Modern replicas of the tortoises may be found in the form of BEAM robotics. An original tortoise is on display in London UK in the Science Museum's Making the Modern World gallery. In 1995, one was replicated by Owen Holland, of the University of the West of England, which used some of the original parts. An original tortoise as seen at the Festival of Britain is in the collection of the Smithsonian Institution.

Operations  Established in 2005, the objective of the program is to prevent household asset depletion and create community assets. To this end, the program provides cash or food payments against public works that build local infrastructure (e.g. roads) or protect environment (e.g. terracing). Poor and vulnerable households with limited labour capacity receive unconditional (direct support) payments. Moreover, eligible households with pregnant or lactating women or infant children are receive temporary direct support. PSNP operates in chronically food insecure districts (woredas) in six Ethiopian regions: Afar, Amhara, Oromia, Somali, Southern Nations, Nationalities, and Peoples' Region, and Tigray.  Notability  PSNP is the second largest social safety net program in Africa (after South Africa). In 2015, more than seven million people benefited from the program. PSNP is implemented by the Government of Ethiopia and has been supported by several international donors, including the Danish International Development Agency, Ireland's Department of Foreign Affairs, Global Affairs Canada, European Commission, Irish Aid, Royal Netherlands Embassy, Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency, UK Department for International Development, United Nations Children‚Äôs Fund, United States Agency for International Development, World Bank and the World Food Programme.

Brooks wanted to solve the problem of how to make robots intelligent and suggested that it is possible to create robots that displayed intelligence by using a \\"subsumption architecture\\" which is a type of reactive robotic architecture where a robot can react to the world around them. Brooks, Rodney A., Flynn, Anita M., \\"Fast, Cheap and Out of Control: A Robot Invasion of the Solar System\\", Journal of the British Interplanetary Society, 1989 His paper \\"Intelligence Without Representation\\", which is still widely respected in the fields of robotics and Artificial Intelligence, further outlines his theories on this. Design The design of the Genghis robot was inspired by insects who have limited brain functions yet possess tremendous functionality. In order to mimic this trait found in insects Brooks \\"removed all cognition processors from Genghis and left only the sensors and the code/hardware to allow it to walk\\". Brooks, Rodney A., \\"Flesh and Machines: How Robots will Change Us\\", Splinter, 2 February 2015 This enabled Genghis to link sensation to an action taken where the robot did not have any pre-planned path to follow but took action as each sensor detected an obstacle. With Genghis, Brooks pioneered his \\"sensation-action theory of intelligence which was to bypass explicit cognition hubs in favor of pairing perception more directly with action\\". Genghis was not designed to have a central controller to direct all possible functions in the robot, particularly in the legs. Instead, each leg had its own built-in sensors that would sense the various obstacles in its path. Each leg was programmed with a few basic behaviors and knew how to react under different scenarios based on sensor feedback. The act of walking became a coordinated effort between all of the legs resulting the robots movement. These processes exist independently, run at all times and fire whenever the sensory preconditions are true. Genghis was designed to navigate difficult terrain with many obstacles and elevations. In order to achieve this type of functionality while reducing overall complexity Brooks created a method of finite state machine thought which relied on \\"layered processing\\"; a basic layering of new traits over older ones. In Genghis the control system was organized into \\"eight incremental layers: Stand up, Simple Walk, Force Balancing, Leg Lifting, Whiskers, Pitch Stabilization, Prowling and Steered Prowling\\". On a processing level the complexity of each of the eight layers of the final movement are addressed separately by each layer, reducing the burden of complex processing from the processors at each level. Genghis now resides in the Smithsonian Air and Space Museum.

After earning the right to practice law in 1917, she became the first woman to bring a case before the Bostonian jurisdiction of the United States Court of Appeals in 1924. In 1926, she was appointed as the first woman to serve as a judge in Puerto Rico. Throughout her career, Tormes worked for women who were incarcerated or engaged in prostitution, advocating for their rights. In 1964, the Bar Association of Puerto Rico named a room after her at its offices in San Juan. Early life Herminia Tormes Garc√≠a was born on 19 October 1891 in Ponce in the Spanish colony of Puerto Rico to Ana Jacobina Garc√≠a Esclab√≥n and Joaqu√≠n Tormes Carbo. Her father was of Spanish heritage and her mother was an Afro-Puerto Rican woman who had formerly been a slave. After graduating from high school in Ponce, Tormes earned a degree to teach English from the Normal School of the University of Puerto Rico. She first married Leopoldo Sim√≥n Lanausse y Belfrey, with whom she had a son C√°rlos Servando Lanausse y Tormes in 1914. In 1917, she graduated in the second class of students to have completed their education at the University of Puerto Rico School of Law. She took her oath on 6 December 1917, becoming the first woman eligible to practice law in Puerto Rico and two weeks later, in the District Court of Ponce on 21 December 1917 divorced Lanausse. Career Tormes and her brother Leopoldo, also an attorney, worked together, often defending the rights of marginalized women. In 1918, in the city of Ponce, an anti-prostitution campaign began and hundreds of women were arrested and charged as prostitutes. The campaign targeted any women who had engaged in sexual activity without being married, regardless of whether they were selling sex. Unfounded accusations could result in women being accused and undergoing invasive physical examinations to prove their innocence. Their male partners were not charged with crimes and women convicted of prostitution had no means to appeal the decisions. By August, the campaign was island-wide and the Tormes siblings, along with Rafael Mart√≠nez Nadal, organized a demonstration to protest the violation of women's human rights. The siblings organized their clients, filing appeals and petitions for pardon, and pressed for hearings for women, alleging that the state was in violation of their clients' civil liberties. Tormes also provided press releases to the local media, pleading on behalf of the women. Leopoldo was accused of subverting the war efforts because of his vigorous defense of women's rights, but the pressure of numerous lawsuits and media coverage caused the government to suspend mass arrests. The jails of Arecibo and Ponce were converted to hospitals for \\"wayward women\\" and began to treat women with venereal disease and provide training to rehabilitate them, providing them with skills that enabled them to earn a living upon release. Tormes headed the efforts to rehabilitate the women and stressed the importance of providing them with education and marketable skills. At the end of World War I, she founded a school with Mois√©s Echevarr√≠a to offer vocational training to inmates, refusing to call the women prostitutes. She rallied local teachers to volunteer with the inmates and teach the prisoners to read and write, while simultaneously pressing the government to appoint a full-time teacher for them. She organized networks of businesses willing to offer women work after their incarceration, recognizing that prostitution was a symptom of the women's poverty and illiteracy. After successfully convincing the department of education to provide teachers for women prisoners, Tormes pressed the Council of National Defense to implement economic development projects for the entire island. In 1924, Tormes became the first woman in the First Circuit of the U.S. Court of Appeals to argue a case and was the first woman licensed to practice in the Appellate Court of Boston. Between 1926 and 1941, Tormes served as the municipal judge in the municipality of Juana D√≠az. With her appointment, she became the first woman judge of Puerto Rico and in 1929 became a district judge in Juana D√≠az, serving also in the courts of Coamo, San Sebasti√°n and Vega Baja. On 13 October 1930, Tormes married Guillermo Beauchamp Qui√±ones, and the following year, the couple had a son, Guillermo Anthony Beauchamp Tormes. She practiced law for over forty years, retiring after she was diagnosed with cancer in 1963. Death and legacy Tormes died from cancer in Ponce on 7 November 1964, and was buried at the Cementerio Civil de Ponce. In 1964, the Bar Association of Puerto Rico named a room after her at its offices in San Juan. She is remembered for her role in championing law as a profession for Puerto Rican women. In 2013, the Bar Association hosted an exhibit for Lawyer's week, In Memoriam, which included Tormes, to honor the prominent Puerto Rican jurists who had been instrumental in developing the country's equal access to justice.

Williams also discusses DNA research conducted by others on these animals, and makes the case for coexistence with these big, wild cats.  Synopsis  With a foreword by Doug Chadwick, the book chronicles Williams' journey, from his early work at a Florida marine park, to his conversion to \\"a lifelong devotee of the species\\". Williams has fitted pumas (also known as cougars and mountain lions) with radio collars and has installed cameras in their caves to track and study them. According to Mountain West News, \\"Montana-based wildlife biologist Jim Williams celebrates wildlife research and conservation of ghost cats from Canada's Yukon Territory to Tierra del Fuego in Argentina and Chile...\\"  Critical reception  alt=Path of the Puma has received positive reviews. Publishers Weekly said, \\"Williams writes movingly of the challenges these animals face, many due to human encroachment on their habitats. He makes a strong case for the necessity of preserving‚Äîor at least peacefully coexisting with‚Äîthe puma.\\" Kirkus Reviews noted, \\"While the book is an undisguised conservationist's plea ... it is not a harangue. The author's passion and his firsthand knowledge of his subject make the narrative highly readable. A noteworthy feature of this work is the presence of numerous full-color photographs...\\" Kirkus concluded, \\"A handsome book that is well-balanced, instructive, and authoritative.\\" The Natural History Book Service wrote that the puma's story, \\"...is fascinating for the lessons it can afford the protection of all species in times of dire challenge and decline.\\" Susan Waggoner of PressReader notes Williams' \\"...enthusiasm for nature and animals jumps off every page... Williams‚Äôs writing is expert, friendly, and interesting. Well organized and clearly presented, information emerges from field work examples, such as the tracking studies that showed that pumas feed almost exclusively on wild prey rather than domestic herds.\\" Tristan Scott of the Flathead Beacon wrote, \\"Path of the Puma doesn't sugarcoat the risks of predators living among humans ‚Äî mountain lions live at the intersection of human landscapes, livelihoods and lifestyles ‚Äî but it points out the critical role predatory species play in the natural world.\\"  Awards  In March 2019, Path of the Puma was named a finalist in two categories for the Foreword INDIES Book of the Year Awards. In June, it was declared the INDIES 2018 Gold winner for Nature in the Adult Non-Fiction category, a category described as \\"Books that examine not only nature and its inhabitants, but people's connection with nature. Authors present their personal responses to the outdoors, comment on environmental issues, and demonstrate how each person can enjoy and relate to nature.\\" Path of the Puma also won the INDIES 2018 Bronze award for Ecology and Environment in Adult Non-fiction. That award is described, \\"Books that comment on environmental themes, particularly as applied to the relationships between man, society, and the environment. Often, environmental literature is understood to promote care and concern for the environment and advocates a more thoughtful and ecologically sensitive relationship of man with nature.\\"  See also  * Cougar * Acinonychini  References   External links  * *Path Of The Puma With Jim Williams (video, 28:57) *This is the Author, S4, E57: Jim Williams, Robert Pondiscio, and Rhonda Magee (audio, first 6:10 minutes) 2018 non-fiction books American non-fiction books Ecology books Nature books Wildlife conservation Zoology books Books about cats ","title":"Path of the Puma"},{"id":"58377747","text":"The Helmick Covered Bridge, near Blissfield, Ohio, was built in 1863.

The database system supports relational, graph and document database models.  History  The developer initially implemented the database as a triplestore, being a Semantic Web pioneer in Russia. Remodelling into a multi-model database was supported by the Skolkovo Innovation Center in 2017. The database is used in information systems that support the health-care reform in modern Russia.  Characteristics  In NitrosBase, all data are stored in the format of the internal graph model, while data in other models are their views (representations; similar to SQL views). Regardless of the model in which format data were imported, it is possible to query them using the same query language thereby uniformly addressing data imported in different models. Moreover, it is possible to query data in any model using query language that is native for that model. NitrosBase supports the following languages: * SQL (with elements of object syntax) ‚Äì for querying data in relational view; * SPARQL and Gremlin-style language Graph-it ‚Äì for querying data in graph view; * JSONiq and MongoDB Query ‚Äì for querying data in document view.  Implementation details  The internal graph model is close to RDF* which is used in Blazegraph and Amazon Neptune. That allows it to treat the internal data graph both as RDF graph and as Property Graph, performing queries both in SPARQL and Gremlin-style languages. Instead of indexes based on B+-trees traditionally used in graph databases, NitrosBase uses a sparse link index of its own devising. Another source of performance gain is storage optimization on the physical level in order to reduce the number of random access operations. Like memSQL, NitrosBase translates a query into C++ code.  Awards and achievements  Nitrosbase-derived product MS SQL Server Accelerator was awarded first prize at the Silicon Valley Open Doors conference in 2009 and named \\"startup of the day\\" of the Microsoft BizSpark program on .

Oechalia is mentioned by Homer in the Catalogue of Ships of the Iliad, where it was part of the territories ruled by Podalirius and Machaon. According to Greek mythology, King Eurytus of Oechalia had promised the hand of his beautiful daughter Iole to whoever defeated him in an archery competition. Heracles beat him but Eurytus refused to keep his promise, so Heracles sacked the city, killed Eurytus and kidnapped Iole. However, there was great discussion in antiquity about whether this Oechalia referred to this city, or that of Euboea, or another also located in Thessaly or even to others that were located in Arcadia or Messenia. Homer, equivocally, and Apollodorus of Athens and Aristarchus of Samothrace placed it in Thessaly. Instead, the author of the epic poem Capture of Oechalia (usually attributed to Creophylus of Samos), Sophocles (in The Trachiniae) and Hecataeus of Miletus (who locates Oechalia near Eretria) were aligned among with those who identified this Oechalia with the Euboean location.Fragmentos de √©pica griega arcaica, pp. 309-310, Madrid: Gredos (1979), Also, Demetrius of Scepsis placed it in Arcadia., and Homer also calls the Oechalia in Messenia the city of Eurytus in both the Iliad and the Odyssey, and this identification was followed by Pherecydes of Athens and Pausanias. Strabo makes mention of all these possibilities but does not offer any additional data on the concrete location of the Oechalia of Thessaly. The site's location is unknown.

He then entered Exeter College, Oxford, where he read Modern History, and was a contemporary of Ned Sherrin and Alan Bennett. During his time in Oxford, he wrote a 17th-century style masque, Porci ante Margeritam (\\"Swine before a Pearl\\"), which was performed for Princess Margaret. After briefly studying for the bar, he decided to enter the priesthood, entering Ely Theological College. He was thereafter ordained in 1963, and spent his first four years as Curate of Saint Andrews, Clewer. In 1967 Brindley was appointed Vicar of Holy Trinity in Reading, which he transformed into an ornate center of Anglo-Catholic worship. He was likewise known for his eccentric and flamboyant personal style, as one obituary described: \\"He wore his grey curly hair in a style resembling a periwig and dressed in lavish Roman monsignoral attire, including buckled shoes with four- inch heels, which he had painted red.\\" In the summer of 1989, the News of the World made public a secretly recorded conversation in which Brindley fantasized about young men. The publication would eventually lead to his resignation, after two evangelical clergymen circulated photocopies of the tabloid's front page to all 500 members of the General Synod. Brindley retired to Western Terrace in Brighton in 1993, upon the General Synod's decision to ordain female priests, converted to Roman Catholicism. He remarked of it: \\"I felt as if I had been a commercial traveller who had been selling vacuum cleaners for 30 years, only to discover suddenly that they didn't work\\". The Canon died from heart failure at a celebration of his 70th birthday, enjoying a seven-course dinner at the Athenaeum in the presence of close friends.

Claude Ferguson, was an American forester, conservationist, and environmentalist. After a 33-year career employee of the U.S. Forest Service, he chose to work with environmental groups as he joined lawsuits against his employer, the U.S. Forest Service. The protest began in 1970 against off-road vehicle trails in the Hoosier National Forest and ended in a 1976 civil servant hearing for unlawful termination and a federal lawsuit citing violations of the Forest Service Trail Standards and on land that was acquired for wildlife habitat by the Indiana Department of Natural Resources.  Early life  Alan Claude Ferguson was born into a pioneer family of the Ozarks where he and his three brothers were raised on a small Jersey dairy farm in Willow Springs, Missouri. He was the second son of John Carl and Mary Willie Boles Ferguson. His father, John Carl Ferguson was active in the establishment of the Missouri Conservation Commission in the late 1920s and the 1939 enabling act for the Mark Twain National Forest in Missouri. He and his brothers, Carl, Bob and Paul would go with their father to one-room school houses where they would show their home-made movies of wildlife, streams and untouched forests to encourage the support of this legislation. Aldo Leopold was a frequent guest in their home during his game-range survey of the north-central states. All four of the Ferguson brothers received an education and appreciation of the outdoors at the knee of Aldo.  Career  Ferguson, while a senior at Willow Springs High School, joined the Forest Service in 1940. He was assigned to the Blue Buck Tower as a fire lookout on the newly founded Mark Twain National Forest in Missouri. He worked closely with the Civilian Conservation Corp as a fire control aide in the Mark Twain National Forest. After three years service in the U.S. Navy as an Aviation Radio-Radar Operator, Gunner and instructor during W.W. II he returned to the Mark Twain as a forestry aide in timber management and land acquisition. Upon completion of his B.S. in Forestry from the University of Missouri in 1952, his first assignment as a forester was on the Nicolet National Forest in Wisconsin. Subsequent promotions included district ranger on the Shawnee National Forest in Illinois and the Hiawatha National Forest in Upper Michigan followed by a 1961 promotion to staff forester on the Ottawa National Forest in Upper Michigan. While on the Ottawa, he had staff responsibilities for the examination, appraisal and reports for the purchase of the L.P. Fisher estate later known as the Sylvania. He was again sent to the Hiawatha, Upper Michigan, in charge of lands, recreation, wildlife, soil and water before his 1964 promotion to Chief of the Branch of Cooperative Forestry Management and Chief of the Branch of Operations in the Forest Service Eastern Regional Office in Milwaukee. In 1965, Ferguson accepted an assignment to the Bedford, Indiana regional headquarters, where he was forest supervisor for the Hoosier National Forest in Indiana and the Wayne National Forest in Ohio. The two were combined and renamed the Wayne-Hoosier National Forest in 1951, and once again separated in 1993. He oversaw the design of a public recreation site, Hardin Ridge on Monroe Lake Reservoir, Lake Monroe. Ferguson headed a Department of Agriculture Forest Service team with the re-introduction of wild turkeys to Indiana from his home state of Missouri. In 1971, at his request to comply with the federal anti-nepotism law, he stepped down as forest supervisor. He assumed the position of staff forester in order to marry a forest service employee. December 20, 1976, he retired from the U.S. Forest Service. =DDT aerial spraying= The United States Department of Agriculture began a fire ant eradication program which involved aerial spraying of DDT, 2,4,5-T and 24-D - pesticide chemicals mixed with fuel oil. Ferguson was one of several forest service employees doing government testing on these new insecticides. He was hospitalized in 1957 at the Washington University Medical Center in St. Louis for treatment of \\"dermatomyositis\\", a connective tissue disorder. Ferguson's case was diagnosed as extremely critical. It was later attributed to exposure to DDT. After several weeks in the hospital, Ferguson was released from the hospital to recover at home and eventually was able to return to his post at the forest service. =Off-road vehicles in the Hoosier National Forest= April 1970, Ferguson, as Forest Supervisor of the Hoosier National Forest became aware of the unauthorized use of the forest when John Buffalo using his personal 20 acres and without asking for permission or notifying the Forest Service held a 100-mile motorcycle race, the \\"Buffalo 100\\", inside the Hoosier National Forest. Ferguson and the district ranger filmed the damage the motorcyclists caused and Ferguson presented the findings facing U.S. parks at two conferences: the 24th Great Lakes Park Training Institute and the 20th Annual Great Lakes District Conference National Park and Recreation Conference in 1970. An interim off-road vehicle policy was established, allowing limited use of them in a small number of approved areas until October 8, 1970 when the Hoosier National Forest was temporarily closed to all ORV use, pending the results of further studies. During this time, Ferguson stepped down as forest supervisor to staff forester and Don Girton was brought in as the new forest supervisor. Despite an incomplete environmental impact statement and public hearings, Hoosier National Forest Supervisor Don Girton made the decision to proceed with a policy of allowing ORV use to take effect as early as September, 1972. In December 1972, the State of Indiana published its report that ORV use was not compatible with the natural purposes of state properties. On the federal side, the Forest Service decided in 1973 to again allow use in limited terrains. Trail construction began without the advance approval the forest service regulation requires and in August 1974, the Forest Service began the ambitious construction of ORV trails in the Hoosier Forest with an opening date of October 14, 1974. He witnessed these trails being built illegally with $34,000 of public money that had been budgeted for routine maintenance of roads and trails. The Hoosier National Forest budgets had been severely reduced for fiscal years 1974 and 1975. The budget cuts forced a reduction in force in engineering personnel and was barely sufficient for routine maintenance of existing roads and trails systems. When the contractor was told to bill the work to the Forest Service for \\"routine maintenance\\", he was outraged that these funds were being diverted and declared this was a \\"violation of the law\\". October 9, 1974, Forest Supervisor Don Girton, District Ranger Frank Haubry, Ferguson and others took a tour to review the newly built ORV trails. Ferguson observed numerous violations of the Forest Service Trail Standards, including but not limited to; reverse curves, trail grades, stumps and logs left in place, damage to soil and watershed lands, damage to wildlife habitat areas and timber production areas. Mr. Girton dismissed Ferguson's concern as \\"one mans opinion\\". According to IDS News Staff writer, Gloria Joseph, Girton was later quoted as saying, \\"If you want to nitpick, you might find some deviation from the ORV standards in the trails\\". On October 13, 1974, Ferguson conducted a field trip for environmentalists and reporters to observe the trail damage. They noted damage to the wilderness area, Nebo Ridge, which led to the lawsuit filed against the U.S. Forest Service. Lawsuit against US Forest Service On October 19, 1974, Ferguson, and the Indiana Division of the Izaak Walton League of American Endowment, Inc filed a lawsuit against Donald Girton, Supervisor of Wayne-Hoosier National Forest, the State of Indiana and Jay Cravens, the Eastern Region Forester of United States Forest Service, seeking a temporary restraining order and injunction halting the trail use. The American Motorcycle Association joined the lawsuit on the side of the Forest Service, while The Sassafras (the Indiana Chapter of the National Audubon Society), the National Audubon Society, the Indiana Conservation Council, the National Wildfire Federation Affiliate in Indiana, and the National Wildlife Federation all joined the Ferguson, Izaak Walton side. Don Girton informed Ferguson that he was being detailed to Milwaukee for three weeks in November 1974 and on March 3, 1975, Ferguson received notice that he was to be permanently transferred to Milwaukee which he declined after the Forest Service denied his spouse's request to also be transferred with him to Milwaukee. John A. Sandor, deputy regional forester at the time said \\"We had an opening in Milwaukee for somebody of his qualification and we sent him\\" according to forest service officials sworn statements; however, Girton said Ferguson's actions were the reason for the transfer. Ferguson was suspended for two weeks without pay and was then notified that he would be removed from office effective February 15, 1976, for participating in a lawsuit in which the government had an interest and for conflict of interest. He was eighteen months away from full retirement. Newspapers and environmental groups rallied behind Ferguson and commended him for outstanding service, loyalty, and devotion to conservation in Indiana. Ferguson claimed the Privacy Act of 1974 rules were broken when his personal medical history was included in a sworn written statement that Sandor gave to a US government special agent on June 18, 1975. The agent later testified that he had not requested any of Ferguson's medical information from Sandor, and Ferguson and his doctor at Washington University Hospital stated that Sandor neither asked nor received permission to use any part of Ferguson's medical records. Ferguson claimed harassment and unlawful termination and on December 20, 1976, a civil servant hearing on his firing commenced and ended on the same day with Ferguson being allowed to retire with full and retroactive benefits. The ORV court challenge continued with a trial date set for December 5, 1977, however, a few months before it was to begin the Forest Service reversed their decision and completely terminated the policy of allowing the use of ORVs in the Hoosier National Forest. Ferguson's case was given to a US Senate subcommittee, chaired by Senator Edward Kennedy, which drafted a freedom-of-information bill providing protection for government employees who disclose information in disagreement with department policies. Reps. Mo Udall and Paul Simon, along with Senator Patrick Leahy introduced bills in the US Congress to create review boards to investigate worker complaints about improper government actions. The Whistleblower Protection Act of 1989 cemented this protection for all government employees.  Awards and service  A.

It was in ruins in the time of Epaminondas, and its position was a matter of dispute in later times. Strabo identified it with Andania, the ancient residence of the Messenian kings, and Pausanias with Carnasium, which was only 8 stadia distant from Andania, and upon the river Charadrus. Carnasium, in the time of Pausanias, was the name given to a grove of cypresses, in which were statues of Apollo Carneius, of Hermes Criophorus, and of Persephone. It was here that the mystic rites of the great goddesses were celebrated, and that the urn was preserved containing the bones of Eurytus, the son of Melaneus. According to Greek mythology, King Eurytus of Oechalia had promised the hand of his beautiful daughter Iole to whoever defeated him in an archery competition. Heracles beat him but Eurytus refused to keep his promise, so Heracles sacked the city, killed Eurytus and kidnapped Iole. However, there was great discussion in antiquity about whether this Oechalia referred to this city, or that of Euboea, or one of two located in Thessaly or even to another that was located in Arcadia. Homer calls the Oechalia in Messenia the city of Eurytus in both the Iliad and the Odyssey, and this identification was followed by Pherecydes of Athens and Pausanias. However, Homer also, followed Apollodorus of Athens and Aristarchus of Samothrace, placed it in Thessaly. The author of the epic poem Capture of Oechalia (usually attributed to Creophylus of Samos), Sophocles (in The Trachiniae) and Hecataeus of Miletus (who locates Oechalia near Eretria) were aligned among with those who identified this Oechalia with the Euboean location.Fragmentos de √©pica griega arcaica, pp. 309-310, Madrid: Gredos (1979), Also, Demetrius of Scepsis placed it in Arcadia.

Career  Teodoro was ordained priest on September 22, 1956. Ten years after his ordination he would be appointed Vice-Rector of the Pontifical Portuguese College in Rome in 1966 and later Rector of the Pontifical College and the Church of Saint Anthony of the Portuguese. He would later become a member of the Apostolic Union of the Clergy and the Center for Sindonology he gave conferences, retreats and courses in various parts of the world. He was the representative of Portugal in Rome in the Secretariats for Ecumenism, Emigration, Tourism and Pilgrimages. He was Secretary of the Cardinal Patriarch of Lisbon, Ant√≥nio II, in the conclaves that elected Popes John Paul I and John Paul II. He would later be consecrated in Rome on May 16, 1982 in the Church of Saint Anthony in Campo Marzio as Bishop of Funchal in 1982, in the early years of Madeira's political autonomy, and effectively taking office on May 16 that year. He took possession of the Diocese on May 30 of the same year. In 1986 was appointed President of the Portuguese Episcopal Commission for Migration and Tourism, and two years after he was elected member of the Pontifical Commission for Migrants and Itinerant People, having participated in Rome in several Congresses. In his capacity as Bishop he was a representative of the Portuguese Episcopal Conference at Commission of the Bishops' Conferences of the European Community. During his term as Bishop of Funchal, Bishop de Faria hosted the visit of Pope John Paul II to the islands of Madeira and Porto Santo, which were under his ecclesiastical jurisdiction. In 2006 he submits his resignation from office to Pope Benedict XVI, due to having achieved his age limit in office. = Child Abuse Policies = During his tenure has Bishop of Funchal, Teodoro publicly defended, as was accused of pressuring Portuguese judicial authorities, Father Frederico Cunha who ended up being convicted to 13 years in prison for child abuse by the Court of Santa Cruz. At the time, Bishop de Faria, claimed that the Father Frederico Cunha was being prosecuted based on unfounded grounds. Frederico Cunha, although convicted, would end up escaping on his first probation period, in 1998, by taking a car from the Portuguese mainland, he was serving sentence in a prison in the mainland, to Madrid, and from there to Brazil, where he lives to day. Teodoro de Faria, has committed himself to silence on this case since the conviction of Father Frederico Cunha. = Emeritus Bishop of Funchal = As Emeritus Bishop of Funchal, Teodoro de Faria has led a low profile presence in Madeiran society, having public appeared solely in major religious and academics events on the island. Nevertheless, he has criticized the current Bishop, Dom Ant√≥nio Carrilho, regarding the need for parish restructuring in the Diocese of Funchal. Teodoro de Faria considers that in Madeira, \\"some parishes are only called parishes due to pity\\", arguing that there are places where the parish priest has two or three parishes, and every year there are one or two baptized, some of which are ceremonies of faithful living abroad, but choose their land to celebrate the sacraments. Given the above, he considered that the principle established by Bishop Fra' David de Sousa, who was Bishop of Funchal between 1957 and 1965, should be reintroduced in the Diocese, i.e. there should be a parish per, at least, two thousand people. Teodoro argues that parish restructuring is vital, specially after the great emigration waves to Venezuela and to South Africa. On 28 July 2018 he was co-consecrator of Jos√© Tolentino Cala√ßa de Mendon√ßa, Head Librarian and Head Archivist of the Holy Roman Church.

History  Syria is home to a substantial Chechen population who emigrated there due to the Chechen‚ÄìRussian conflict. The initial Chechen migrants sometimes clashed with local Arab and Druze settlers, though they later peacefully integrated into Syrian society. After the Syrian Civil War's outbreak in 2011, however, about 3,000 Chechen militants also travelled to Syria in order to wage jihad there, and formed numerous anti-government militias. The most notable Chechen-led groups in Syria were Jaish al- Muhajireen wal-Ansar, the Caucasus Emirate (Syrian branch), Junud al-Sham and Ajnad al-Kavkaz. The hostility between Chechens to Assad Government is contributed by the close relationship between Russia and the Assad Government, and long historical Chechen‚ÄìRussian conflict, thus antagonized Chechens and Syrian regime.https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-24999697 There are also recent Chechen soldiers working on the Assad side, mostly sent by strongman Ramzan Kadyrov.https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/dec/08/chechen-leader-claims- his-troops-eager-to-fight-scum-in-syria Population There are no reliable figures on ethnic minorities in Syria, however, estimates on the Chechen minority ranged from 6,000 to 35,000 in 2008. The Chechen community in the Golan Heights were evicted following the 1967 Arab-Israeli War, with many Chechen refugees moving to Damascus whilst others emigrated abroad, especially to the United States.

At the time its closing was announced in 2001, 30% of the world production of Lego was produced at the Baar facility. The Baar facility eventually closed in 2004 and Lego's remaining Swiss production facilities closed in 2005. History =Beginnings= The founder of Lego, Ole Kirk Christiansen, discovered an office building of Kenwood AG on a large property in Baar while returning from Zurich Airport and chose that location to be the site of the factory. Once the building was purchased, it served as the Swiss headquarters and operating center. Construction of production halls was started; and since existing steel beams and concrete elements were used, the construction did not take long. This was the first Lego factory outside of Denmark. Since the factory was established in the L√§ttich area of Baar, it was named Lego L√§ttich. =Expansion= To satisfy increasing demand, the production area around Hall 2 was expanded into Halls 3 and 4. Injection-mould construction and research- and-development were also situated in Hall 4. With this expansion, the space at this location was exhausted. With a total of 213 injection-molding machines, the production site was the largest such plant in Switzerland. The waste heat generated during the injection molding process was used to heat the nearby L√§ttich Baar municipal indoor and outdoor swimming pools (German: Hallen- und Freibad L√§ttich). After the close of the production plant, the swimming pool had to purchase a wood-fired heating system. As demand continued to grow, the tool shop was moved to a new building in Steinhausen, with a repair workshop set up in its stead. Since more space was needed, another production facility, Lego Neuhof, was built in the area of Neuhof, in Baar. The new facility could handle more stages of production than the L√§ttich one, performing not only injection molding but also assembly, high-frequency welding, pad printing, and packaging. Full crates of Lego parts were automatically taken from the injection-molding machines, shipped to a high- rack warehouse, and replaced by empty crates. The research department was outsourced from L√§ttich to a new building, along with a product development department and an exhibition model building department in Rumentikon / Hagendorn ZG (Cham). Since toolmaking in Steinhausen and Hohenwestedt, Germany, were no longer sufficient to produce enough new injection moulds, another tool shop was built in Au, St. Gallen. In 1993, a new factory was built for Lego in Willisau. The architecture was characterized by a main entrance, beyond which were passageways connecting to the various production halls on either side. The Willisau facility also had its own railroad, which connected to the Swiss Federal Railways network. In addition to injection moulding, printing, assembly, and packaging, Willisau also operated a blow-wax machine for Bionicol packaging, and two deep-drawing machines for the production of Lego building boards. =Closure= In 1998, Lego confronted a crisis. In the course of this crisis, model-building and product development were closed in Rumentikon, but the research and development department remained. The tool shop in Au was sold to Otto Mannes GmbH (Barnes Group Inc.), which hired the entire staff. After this phase, the Lego Group recovered in the short term. At this time, the idea for a Legoland amusement park in Rotkreuz, in the canton of Zug, was raised. However, the project could not be implemented because the farmers concerned in Rotkreuz were not willing to sell their land. At the beginning of 2000, the Lego Group closed its factory in the USA and withdrew the external production of the watch series \\"Lego-Watch\\". All the injection-moulding machines from the discontinued operations were integrated into the L√§ttich and Neuhof factories. At the beginning of 2001, due to lower profits, it was decided that the L√§ttich production site should be abandoned completely within six months, and the Neuhof production site within one year. Out of 950 employees, 400 would be laid off. Effectively, however, the closures were postponed for over a year. The Neuhof plant was taken over by the Swiss Post for a sorting center and by the transport company Bucher Bitsch for a storage location. The L√§ttich plant now houses a number of companies, the largest is the Speckprint AG printing company, which also produces the Zuger Amtsblatt. Research and development (research involving various plastics and production processes) has also been closed. The toolmaking in Steinhausen was sold to Wisi'on Tool AG in 2005. Wisi'on Tool could rely on further orders from Lego, and no closure was planned for Willisau. The Lego Group adopted a new strategy, the licensing of Lego products to Chinese companies. Therefore, in 2005, production in Willisau was also closed. The Competec Group (Brack, Alltron, ...) acquired the Lego site in Willisau, in 2011, of 55,000 square meters.Logistikzentrum Willisau Ex LEGO Fabrik nun Logistikzentrum Willisau von Competec Today, only the sales and finance departments of Lego are located in Switzerland. Products The following Lego products were manufactured in Switzerland: * Lego Primo * Lego Duplo * Lego Technic * Lego Bionicle Technical equipment Sprue picker Lego mainly used injection-moulding machines from Arburg (Germany) and Engel (Austria), but also machines from Battenfeld (Austria) and Kl√∂ckner-Werke (Germany). No more than six two-component machines were used in the L√§ttich plant. Most of the accessories used for extraction, heating control, and post- processing were developed and built by Lego itself. In the case of the water- cooling appliances, Lego used only HB-Therm temperature control units. Lego pieces were first stored in cardboard boxes and then in uniform plastic containers of various sizes. Although all these plastic containers were intended exclusively for internal use in the Lego Group, they were not produced by Lego, but by an external manufacturer, exclusively for lego. Education and training Lego offered the following apprenticeships in Switzerland: * Merchant * Computer scientist * Warehouseman * Electrician * Toolmaker / PolyMechanic * Plastic technologist The second specialty in plastic processing, thermoset processing, was taught at Isopress AG.

She was born in Chattanooga, Tennessee. A single mother to two pairs of twins, Moore's persona is heavily influenced by her experiences of black single motherhood. In a 2017 interview Moore described herself as a 'stay-at-home mom' who earns her income through rapping. She began her career through SoundCloud, where she released her first track, \\"Slut\\". In 2017, she rose to prominence within underground hip hop after the video for her song \\"Rules\\" went viral. As of December 2018, her debut studio album, Christine, has yet to be scheduled for release; the album is produced by SXYLK and My Friend Meesha. She has collaborated with Rico Nasty, DONCHRISTIAN, and God Colony. On August 28, 2020, she released her debut and final studio album, now titled Muthaland, on Bandcamp.  Early life  Moore was born and raised in Chattanooga, Tennessee. Both of her parents were in high school at the time of her birth. Moore was raised primarily by her mother, a religious Christian. Her father, a barber, was physically abusive. She has a younger brother. Moore had a turbulent adolescence. At school, Moore was an outcast and was bullied. At the age of 12, she moved to Pensacola with her mother. After physically assaulting a teacher at her school, Moore was committed to a psychiatric ward, where she was diagnosed with depression and ADHD. She was expelled from the school and moved back to Tennessee. By the age of 13, Moore had begun selling drugs and having sex with older boys. At 17, she became pregnant with her first pair of twins, Mekel and Mekeila, who she has raised alone, describing the children's father as a 'pedophile'. Moore would listen to rap music at her father's house during her summer break from school. Beginning in early childhood, she enjoyed writing. She began writing poetry in fourth grade, and became interested in music and performance after participating and winning a dance competition with her cousins in elementary school. She began rapping in tenth grade. During that year, Moore and her cousins formed a group called Money over Niggas. Career Moore's \\"first official song\\" as a solo artist was \\"Slut\\". Moore released the song on SoundCloud. She performed under the stage name Cindyy Kushh from the age of \\"17 or 18\\", before changing her stage name to bbymutha. The name was inspired by her experience of being called a \\"baby mama\\" by the other female partner of her unfaithful boyfriend. After working in retail and in call centres for several years, she became pregnant with her second pair of twins, Khloe and Tyler, after moving to Nashville to study fashion design. The father of the twins was abusive, and he disapproved of Moore's rapping, leading Moore to take a hiatus from her rap career. After giving birth to her second pair of twins, Moore moved back to Chattanooga and returned to rapping. In December 2015, she released a three-song EP entitled Weave. = Breakthrough = In December 2016, Moore released the EP Glow Kit. The EP was included in \\"20 best Bandcamp releases of 2017\\". In 2017, the track \\"Rules\\", which was produced by Luna God, was released as a single from the EP. The music video for the song was later released in August on YouTube. The video went viral, and led to Moore to receive attention from prominent R&B; musicians SZA and Kehlani. The track was also played by Bj√∂rk as part of a DJ set, and was featured in FADER's \\"101 best songs of 2017\\". In 2018, Moore has released three EPs so far. In January 2018, Muthaz Day 2 was released. The EP featured production from Rock Floyd and Crystal Caines. This was followed by BbyShoe, which was released in February 2018 to positive reviews. The EP also received praise from Pitchfork. In May 2018, Moore released a surprise EP entitled Free Brittanee. Moore performed at Toronto Pride in June 2018. \\"Indian Hair\\", a track from Moore's 2015 EP, Weave, featured in the soundtrack to the second season of Netflix series Dear White People. = Retirement and Mutha Magick Apothecary = On August 28, 2020, after years of delays, her debut and final studio album, Muthaland, was finally released on music distribution platforms. Declaring it her last official release, she expressed her frustrations via Twitter with the process behind making the album, adding how much stress it caused her. The album received positive reviews from music publications, with critics praising the lyrics and creativity. Pitchfork scored the album an 8.0 rating, with contributor Dylan Green writing \\"It‚Äôs a deliriously entertaining, ambitious project from an artist operating at her peak\\". She recently started an apothecary, named Mutha Magick Apothecary, where she sells soaps, candles, and essential oils among other products. In addition, she also plans to open a physical brick-and-mortar store for the company, while also focusing on possibly releasing a mini-EP to be made exclusively available on OnlyFans, and a documentary. = Influences = Moore has credited Gucci Mane as her biggest musical influence. She has also listed Southern hip hop artists Trina, La Chat, and Gangsta Boo as influences. She has described her music as being influenced by living in the ghetto in Chattanooga. Her music is also influenced by her religious upbringing in Tennessee, in the Bible Belt. She is known for having a colourful fashion sense and frequently wearing different wigs. Moore has named Jimi Hendrix, Lil Kim, and Kelis as style influences.  Personal life  Moore lives in Tennessee with her four children. Her father lives next door to her, and helps her with childcare when she travels to perform.

Education Chang graduated from Soochow University and Barrington University. Political career Chang was first elected to the legislature in December 1998, as a Democratic Progressive Party representative of Taipei County. Taiwan Solidarity Union candidate Liao Pen-yen was expected to claim some of Chang's vote share in 2001, but both were elected to office. Chang received support from the DPP to run for a third term in 2004, but lost. During his first term on the Legislative Yuan, Chang drew attention to a number of environmental concerns, including pollution of the Kaoping River, and the environmental effect of the Longmen Nuclear Power Plant. He worked with Chai Trong-rong to pass stricter law against electoral fraud. Additionally, Chang backed efforts to regulate imported drugs. Chang commented frequently on exchanges between Taiwan and China, mainly in relation to tourism. In August 2000, he called out Taipower for importing Chinese gravel illegally for use in building the Longmen nuclear plant. Later that year, he opined that an increase in Chinese visitors would expose Taiwan to increased espionage. In March 2002, Chang criticized brokers that defrauded Taiwanese students who wished to pursue higher education in China. He was supportive of an initiative allowing children of taishang to study in Kinmen, rather than the Chinese educational system. In October 2002, John Chang announced that 121 lawmakers had signed his petition advocating airline flights across the Taiwan Strait. One of the signatories was Chang Ching-fang, but he pulled his support days later. Among Chang Ching-fang's counterproposals included that flights from China to Taiwan transit in Okinawa, and that Taiwan's government lift select restrictions on Chinese entrepreneurs to elicit further investment in Taiwanese real estate. Chang supported Chen Shui-bian's decision to shift Cross-Strait policy away from \\"no haste, be patient.\\" However, Chang was largely critical of its replacement, the three links. In 2004, Chang claimed that China treated Taiwanese businesspeople unfairly, especially those who supported the Democratic Progressive Party. Chang Ching-fang maintained an interest in national security. In June 2000, Chang asked the Control Yuan to investigate a former National Security Bureau official who visited China days after retirement. In October, Chang submitted evidence in a separate legal case implicating the NSB's Liu Kuan-chun, who was suspected of embezzling money from the agency. Chang reported to the NSB in March 2002 that Liu was in Canada. Controversy While in office, Chang noted the underworld connections of Lin Ming-yi, Lo Fu-chu, and Wu Tse-yuan. In January 2002, Chang and Yeh Yi-jin accused several of their legislative colleagues of accepting bribes. In April, Chang accused legislator Wang Chung-yu, former president of the Association of Industry for Environmental Protection ROC, of using the group's funds improperly. In November 2003, Chang alleged that James Soong had an affair with Yang Yun-tai. Members of Soong's People First Party filed a lawsuit against Chang. Yang did the same, and the court ruled in her favor in August 2005. In December 2003, Chang called a press conference to present evidence that Pan Jung-kuang had joked about Chen Shui-bian while giving a lecture. Pan apologized after Democratic Progressive Party members filed suit against him. In February 2004, Chang sued Thomas Lee for libel, because Lee had accused Chang of involvement in black gold politics. Chang later filed a related lawsuit against Chen Yu-hao.

He is Chairman of the Florida Republican Party, and a member of the Florida Senate representing the 23rd District which consists of Sarasota County and part of Charlotte County. He worked on the campaign of U.S. Rep. Vern Buchanan as campaign manager, was president of the Sarasota Young Republicans, was vice Chairman of the Republican Party of Florida, and for 10 years was the chairman of the Republican Party of Sarasota ‚Äî a post he has held longer than any other Chairman in Sarasota County's history. Gruters also co-chaired Donald Trump's campaign for President in Florida and served as the co-chairman of the 2016 Republican National Committee's Platform Committee on Restoring the American Dream.  Political History  Gruters lost his first two elections. He worked behind the scenes on several more losing campaigns. He joined Vern Buchanan‚Äôs original successful 2006 campaign for the United States Congress. \\"He has been on a hot streak ever since, winning the job of Sarasota GOP chairman in 2008, gaining clout as an early backer of Gov. Rick Scott in 2010 and becoming vice chairman of the Republican Party of Florida this year.\\" = Republican Party of Sarasota = In 2008, a month after Barack Obama came within 237 votes of beating John McCain GOP majority Sarasota County, Gruters became chairman of the Sarasota County. In 2012, Mitt Romney won Sarasota County by 15,400 vote margin over the incumbent, Obama. In 2016, Sarasota County went for Trump by a margin of more than 26,000 votes. Gruters‚Äô political success with Gov. Rick Scott earned him a high-profile appointment to the Florida State University Board of Trustees and strong political backers when he ran for the Florida House of Representatives' seat in 2016. = Early Donald Trump supporter = Gruters was an early Trump supporter and became Co-Chairman of the 2016 Trump for President campaign in Florida. Gruters forged a relationship with Donald Trump in 2012 after GOP leaders snubbed the New York celebrity at the Republican National Convention in Tampa, north of Sarasota. He cold-called Trump to invite him to speak in Sarasota the night before the convention. Trump agreed. \\"This Joe's some piece of work,\\" Trump said when he took the stage that night. In 2016, the same year he delivered Sarasota County resoundingly for Trump, Gruters won his election to the Florida House of Representatives, representing the 73rd District, which includes Eastern Manatee County and Northeastern Sarasota County, from 2016. In 2018, he won election to the Florida Senate representing the 23rd District, consisting of Sarasota County and part of Charlotte County.  Republican Party of Florida  Gruters was elected Chairman of the Republican Party of Florida by a huge margin January 11, 2019 at the Republican Party of Florida's annual meeting in Orlando, handing out red ‚ÄúKeep Florida Great‚Äù hats ahead of the vote. His easy election was a result of the re-unification of the Republican Party of Florida after a split during the Governor Rick Scott's terms. The Miami Herald reported on the election the next day, \\"One of Donald Trump‚Äôs closest allies in Florida has been named chairman of the state party, strengthening the president‚Äôs already strong grip on the nation‚Äôs largest swing state ahead of his reelection bid in 2020.\\" ‚ÄúWe have a singular focus over the next two years,‚Äù Gruters said. ‚ÄúAnd that‚Äôs getting our president reelected.‚Äù Gruters said expects Florida Republicans to be unified and focused on 2020. ‚ÄúI think we‚Äôll have the resources we need. I think people understand the importance that Florida has on the national election,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúDonald Trump can‚Äôt be our president if he can‚Äôt win Florida.‚Äù  Politics and Legislation  Gruters is a pro-business, pro-life, pro-environment conservative. He is supported by the Florida Chamber of Commerce. He introduced pro-environment legislation regarding red tide and other water quality issues in Florida, such as restoring septic tank inspection rules that had been lifted during the recession. Two days after a fatal shooting at a California synagogue April 26, 2019, the Florida Senate unanimously passed a bill by Gruters requiring schools to deal with anti-Semitic behavior the same way they do racial discrimination. The bill also defines anti-Semitic behavior as ‚Äúaccusing Jewish citizens of being more loyal to Israel, or the alleged priorities of Jews worldwide, than to the interest of their own nations.‚Äù Gruters made his views clear on the issue, saying: ‚ÄúHe knew nothing about the victims, other than that they were Jewish. That was enough for them to die in his own mind...anti-Semitism is on the rise, and we have the ability to do something about it. No one is born with hate in their heart.‚Äù Gruters was a driving force behind Florida's 2019 law outlawing sanctuary cities and requiring all Florida jurisdictions to comply with federal immigration law and cooperate with the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. He sponsored Senate Bill 168 that passed the Florida Senate 22-18. This marked a change of direction for Florida from a few years earlier when the state had enabled illegal immigrants in several areas. Gruters‚Äô bill was altered near the end, including no longer requiring local authorities to hold ICE detainer subjects indefinitely. Those people will be released after 48 hours if ICE doesn't take them into custody. After passing the Florida House, the bill is expected to be signed into law by Gov. Ron DeSantis, who ran on the issue in November 2018. Gruters sponsored Senate Bill 796 requiring electric utilities to create and follow long-term plans to bury electric lines and harden the state's power grid against hurricanes, which the Senate voted 39-1. Gruters said lawmakers are taking a ‚Äúlong-range approach‚Äù to strengthen the state's electric system. Gruters and other supporters pointed to economic losses caused by major power outages. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a public safety issue. It‚Äôs a resiliency issue,‚Äù he said. Gruters filed a Senate Bill 558, called \\"Florida Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act\\" that would ban abortions that are 20 weeks after fertilization due to what proponents say is a growing body of scientific evidence that the unborn child feels pain, including physical and emotional distress. The bill is controversial because it could test where the courts stand on the 20-week cutoff. He sponsored Senate Bill 230 that would require the supervisor of elections in each Florida county to enter into a local agreement with court officials to obtain a list of jurors who have self-identified as non-citizens. That list would then be compared to the registered voter rolls and the non- citizen names would be purged. Gruters filed Senate Bill 216, which would require Florida cities and counties to alert customers to sewage spills within 24 hours of a sewage spill, and levies fines on those municipalities dependent on the size of the spill. The proposed fine is $1 for every gallon of sewage that is spilled, paid to the state. Or the municipality may spend $2 per gallon of sewage spilled to fix the problems leading to the spill and improve utility infrastructure. He has co-sponsored the Florida Competitive Workforce Act to update the 1992 Florida Civil Rights Act to include protections for sexual orientation and gender identity.https://www.flcompetes.org/18-republicans-and-counting-support-the- florida-competitive-workforce-act/ In 2019, after being elected chair of the Republican Party of Florida, he introduced the Florida Inclusive Workforce Act to ban discrimination against LGBT people in the workplace. The bill was quickly endorsed by SAVE (a leading Florida LGBT group) and Rand Hoch (President of the Palm Beach Human Rights Council).http://www.save.lgbt/workplace Gruters is also proposing legislation that would ban smoking at public beaches statewide. Violators would be fined up to $25 or given up to 10 hours of public service.  Personal life  Joe Gruters is a fourth-generation Sarasotan. His great grandfather William Hobson moved the family to Sarasota in 1922 to serve as the chief tent maker for Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus. Gruters graduated from Cardinal Mooney High School in 1996 and is a graduate of both the Florida State University (undergraduate degree) and the University of South Florida (Masters in Business Administration, MBA). He is a licensed Certified Public Accountant. Gruters lives in Sarasota County, is married to Sydney Gruters and they have three children. Gruters is a licensed Certified Public Accountant by training and is a principle in Paoli & Gruters Certified Public Accountants, which has offices in Venice and Sarasota, Florida.

It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  History  In 1819, retired Naval Surgeon Dr Charles Throsby was granted 1000 acres by Governor Macquarie in appreciation of his services to the Colony. Macquarie stated that Throsby was to select the 1000 acres in any part of the area Throsby had discovered. Dr Throsby's services to the colony included involvement in the exploration of routes down the Illawarra Escarpment, from Sutton Forest to Jervis Bay and from the Cowpastures to Bathurst. This exploration was undertaken by himself, Hamilton Hume, James Meehan the surveyor, and Joseph Wild, through Camden, Bargo, Marulan and the Kangaroo Valley. Dr Throsby later explored with Wild the route through Bong Bong and Wingecarribee and Wollondilly and this is part of the site where he chose to settle. His glowing reports of the Southern Tablelands had prompted Macquarie to open up the area placing Throsby in charge of the building of the 75 mile long road from Picton to the Wingecarribee River, west to the Wollondilly River over the Cook Bundanoon Mountains to Tarlo. During a tour of inspection, Macquarie gave the name Throsby Park to the property that Throsby had selected. By 1820, a hut had been constructed on the property and by 1823 Throsby's nephew, also named Charles had erected a small cottage on the property. The nephew managed the property during Throsby's absences. The cottage is reported to have been used as a court when Throsby was required to act as Magistrate. Dr Throsby was appointed to the New South Wales Legislative Council in 1825 and served on it for three years. In 1825 Governor Darling visited the property. By 1828 Dr Charles Throsby was named on a list of the 12 largest stockholders in the country. Throsby also built Glenfield Farm at Casula.Silink, HHT, 2010, 12 Throsby continued to add to the Throsby Park property by both grant and purchase. At the time of his death, by suicide, in 1828 he held 21,600 acres (8,770 hectares). His estate including Glenfield and Throsby Park was left to his nephew Charles Throsby. His nephew Charles Throsby married Elizabeth (Betsy) Broughton in 1824. Dr Throsby died in 1828 following a bout of severe depression. His nephew Charles inherited the estate and continued to make improvements, expanding both the property holdings and associated infrastructure. In 1828, the property had a small house, large barn and other outhouses. The number of employees grew steadily from 30, mainly assigned servants including labourers, stockmen, shepherds, watchman, hutkeepers, overseer, ploughman, gardener, fencer and shoemaker, to 50 workers in 1841. The 1830s were a time of great pastoral opportunities in NSW, particularly for pastoralists. Throsby took advantage of these opportunities and became a major producer of food for the colony, supplying by tender much of his produce of beef, mutton, maize, flour, straw, bran and spirits. to road parties and the mounted police. Throsby moved much of his pastoral operation to the Monaro and Deniliquin areas in 1837. Throsby Park was in the ideal position to supply these properties, which Throsby did by bullock and dray. Construction of Throsby Park House by (the nephew) Charles and Elizabeth Throsby began some time around 1833 and was completed by 1836 when James Backhouse described the house as a \\"noble mansion\\" during his visit. By 1842 Charles Throsby was one of the largest shareholders in the Bank of Australia and continued to make improvements to Throsby Park. He was actively involved in community affairs being appointed District Warden by Governor Fitzroy in 1843, a position he held until his death in 1854. He donated the land for, and erected Christ Church Bong Bong nearby in 1845. Charles' widow Elizabeth leased out many of the functions of the property to tenants, a situation that continued until 1891. In 1868 she moved into the cottage and leased Throsby Park house to the Governor of New South Wales, Lord Belmore as his summer residence. During 1873-74 the Anglican Bishop of Sydney, the Rt Reverend Frederic Barker used it as his summer residence. In 1874-75 H. E. Southey used the premises as a school. The history of occupation of the house is sketchy after this period except for 1882 - 1887 when Edward Ross Fairfax occupied it. The Bong Bong Picnic Race Club which formed in 1886 held its race meeting on the Throsby Estate. Elizabeth Throsby died in 1891 leaving the property to Patrick Hill Throsby who died in 1894 leaving the property to Francis Henry Throsby. Patrick was a successful breeder and racer of horses. The Moss Vale Jockey Club formed in 1900 and held its race meetings on the Bong Bong track which was on the Throsby estate. In 1905, the area was threatened by bushfires. Francis Throsby became concerned for the safety of the house and had the shingle roof removed and replaced by corrugated galvanised iron. He also had major alterations and additions made to the house in 1910. A clay tennis court was built on terraced ground to the rear of Throsby Park house 1915-16 and became the social hub of the property up until World War II. It was modified some time in the 1940s-70s to become a horse exercise yard, which included installation of timber post-and-rail fencing.TKD, 2015, 2 Francis and his wife Jeannie settled Throsby Park House and the surrounding 181 acres on their son Francis Henry Osborne Throsby in 1930, but they continued to occupy the house until 1938. Francis Henry Osborne Throsby and his wife Joan had been occupying the Mill where they had operated a guesthouse prior to their move to Throsby Park House in 1938. They transferred the operation of the guesthouse as well as a riding school to Throsby Park. During World War II, Throsby Park was home to a number of families whose men were either away at the war or working in Sydney. The riding school continued operating after the war with up to 35 children in residence during school holidays. Share farmers still operated on the property at various times. Various alterations and additions continued to be made to the property and its associated infrastructure. Francis Henry Osborne Throsby died in 1960. In 1963 Delicia and Joan Hester Throsby purchased Throsby Park house. The Government of New South Wales under Premier Tom Lewis acquired the house in 1975 under the NSW National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS) Act, but Joan and Delicia continued to occupy the rear section of the house. A condition of acquisition was that Delicia be entitled to reside in part of the house and continue to operate her renowned riding school on the site. Joan Throsby died in 1977. Throsby Cottage was purchased by the NSW National Parks and Wildlife Service in 1991. The house was in a dilapidated state before the NSW NPWS began conservation works. Under NSW NPWS management from the 1970s it was opened to the public on an occasional basis, with guided tours, open days and special events. Several buildings formed part of the original property are now privately owned. These include the Mill, Barn and original stables. The barn at Throsby Park was built by Dr. Charles Throsby soon after he had taken possession of the land and built a small wooden cottage by the 1820s. It is of brick construction set on sandstone foundation with 60 centimetre thick walls. The roof was originally shingled but now covered with corrugated iron. The barn was one of two buildings erected soon after Dr Throsby took possession of his land grant. The property has a Wingecarribee Local Government Heritage Listing as well as being included as an item of significance within the Throsby Park group.Brown, pers.comm., 3/6/10 In 2010 the property was transferred to the Historic Houses Trust (HHT) of NSW to use its expertise to build on the restoration works undertaken by the NPWS. By returning Throsby Park to its original use as a residence, HHT was to maintain its heritage values while ensuring regular opportunities for the public to visit and appreciate the property. Between 2010 and 2013, the HHT undertook essential conservation and maintenance projects to repair damage to the building. A major task was repairing the 26 verandah columns' lower decayed sections - cut off and replaced with brick and render base \\"plates\\". Spliced in sections of recycled hardwood (ironbark, tallowwood) replacing rotten sections only. A fibro room added under a corner of the internal verandah was dismantled, its missing shaped support posts replaced in recycled hardwood, A wooden trapdoor discovered in this room cut into the flagstone floor was the old entrance to the cellar. The hinged door was in good condition but its frame decayed. A new support frame was insterted, carefully modelled on the original and a damp-proof course added between the two surfaces. Inside the house's main rooms some minor patch repairs, painting and cleaning was done. The current planned works, including painting most of the exterior, was completed in February 2013. The HHT then sought a new tenant under the Endangered Houses Program.Insites, 2/2013 In April 2014 a forty-year lease over the 74 ha estate was granted to descendant, expatriate banker, Tim Throsby. One of twelve submissions for the leasehold, Throsby won not only because of family connection, but based on a $2.5m investment in conserving the house itself and a remaining $1.3m in annual rental over 40 years. Throsby's father Pat was related to Del Throsby (the last family member to live there, until her death in 2006) and had lived at the property when he was young. 'There's nothing economically sensible about all this. It's a labour of love on our part' Throsby told the Sun-Herald. 'The plan for us now is to spend some time turning it into a comfortable family home and we'll move back here in a few years to live in it'. The lease decision in April over the 74 hectare estate with its own Act of Parliamentmakes it the largest and one of the most significant historic properties to be entrusted to a member of the public, Historic Houses Trust of NSW chair Michael Rose said. 'This is a real success in terms of taking a state-owned property, which was not in great condition and not being used, and bringing it back to life and conserving it in a way that won't cost the state', Rose said. The adjoining property, called Barnham Stables, predates Throsby Park and was where workers lived while the homestead was being built. Throsby purchased that 8396 square metre property in 2007 for $1.425m from artist John Olsen and his wife, Katherine.Macken, in SMH, 19/10/2014  Description  Throsby Park is located about 140 km south of Sydney, about 2 km east of Moss Vale Railway Station. The site contains 74 hectares of the original 1000 acres grant made to Dr Charles Throsby in 1819. The historic site consists of 43 elements: the main house, a drainage ditch, a site of convict huts, a dump, truck and fence posts, horse dray, stock loading ramp, piggery and boiling down vat, dams, roadways, horse yards, stables, gardens, stable yards, dairy, hayshed, dairyman's cottage, meat house, latrine block site, windbreak, sheep dip, the Throsby grave, the Throsby quarry, fencing, a site of various former structures, the site of the horse mill, drainage channel, orchard paddock, dairy shed, machinery shed site, groom's outhouse, kennel shed, site of grave, harvester and farm equipment, cottage and garden, collection and cottage laundry. The grounds also include a summer house and orchards. Several buildings which originally formed part of the property are now privately owned. These include the Mill, Barn and original stables. Fabrics include local stone, weatherboard, corrugated iron and sandstock bricks. Throsby Park House is a one-story structure with cellars and attics, built of locally quarried stone, internally divided by brick walls with cedar joinery throughout and an iron roof. Throsby Cottage is a timber framed weatherboard cottage. It has four wings with brick chimneys and corrugated iron hipped roofs on three wings and a gable roof on the fourth. The laundry is a timber framed weatherboard clad building with a corrugated iron roof. The stables has sandstock brick masonry in Flemish bond with an attic in the roof space lit be a pair of dormer windows. The corrugated iron roof is hipped, the walls are lime washed and the floors are stone flagged. The horse yards are post and rail. The collection consists of furniture and pictures, some originally purchased by or made for the Throsbys' and others purchased or donated to the collection. The buildings were reported to be in good condition as a result of recent conservation works as at 14 December 2000. Prior to this, the buildings were all in a dilapidated condition. Archaeological potential is high. Integrity and intactness are high. The majority of structures retain their original fabric and form which allows their function and interrelationship between the various building and farm components to be easily established. = Modifications and dates = * Infrastructures have been modified as needed during the entire history of the complex. The hay shed was replicated in 1991 after the original collapsed. * Outlying former parts of the estate, the Barn and Stables were owned by Miss Rachel Roxburgh, who adaptively reused the Barn to become her home, and used the Stables to house her kiln (she was a potter, as well as an acclaimed historian and writer on colonial architecture in NSW). Miss Roxburgh died in 1991.  Heritage listing  Throsby Park Historic Site is of national significance. The Throsby Park grant is important because it set in motion the first settlement outside the County of Cumberland and the opening up of the Southern Highlands. The Throsby Park Historic Site is the 184 acres core area of the 1000 acre grant made to Dr Charles Throsby in 1819. The Throsby Park Historic Site is a rare surviving property, which exhibits a strong sense of continuity from its early colonial origins and continuous family ownership. It is a symbol of early colonial Australia and of the lifestyle of the wealthier and more important members of colonial society. It is a rare property, that retains the ability to reflect its colonial period of use as an intense commercial mixed farming and subsistence operation that came to an end with the death of Charles Throsby in 1856. It is a substantially intact, surviving example of the cultural landscape of an intensely farmed high quality property which became the generators and breeding grounds for subsequent rural expansion and squatting empires. The farm complex which includes rare surviving 1830s farm buildings played an important role in developing the export industry for colonial beef products and in modern times has become known for its association with equestrian activities. It contains numerous archaeological deposits with potential insights into the evolution of the site and the range of colonial activities and industries carried out there. Artist Conrad Martens celebrated its qualities in a painting in 1836. Throsby Park House, the centrepiece of the site, with a design possibly influenced by the work of John Verge, is a significant architectural milestone in the progression toward an Australian rural house form. It is a fine and early representative example of the \\"large verandahed cottage\\" which developed in the 1830s from villa and bungalow antecedents within the Old Colonial Georgian Style. Sited crowning a hill overlooking Moss Vale, the house makes a strong visual statement, with its commanding position and attendant dark pines contained within a sweeping rural landscape. Together with its collection of furniture, the house evocatively expresses the compromise between the demands of English architecture and fashion, the colonial climate and colonial building conditions and the wealth and social aspirations of its colonial builder in a way that few houses can. The Throsby Park Historic Site has strong associations with Dr Charles Throsby who was a significant contributor to the development of the colony in his various capacities as government official, explorer, member of the first Legislative Council, pastoralist and known for his improvements to the quality of colonial cattle. His successor Charles Throsby, the person primarily responsible for the development of the property was an important figure instrumental in the development of both the property and the district. He ran an intense mixed farming business on the property that set up the family's wealth for future generations. He built Throsby Cottage, the first residence in the district, which although much altered, still stands on the property and Christ Church, Bong Bong, the first church in the district and Throsby Park House, an early \\"mansion\\" in the district. The cultural landscape of Throsby Park is important at National, State, Regional and Local level as the surviving remnant of a 1,000 acre grant by Governor Macquarie in 1819 to Dr.Charles Throsby for his pioneering exploration for a route to the south coast from Bong Bong. Inherited by Charles Throsby, nephew of Dr. Charles Throsby, in 1834, the predominantly early nineteenth century farming landscape is articulated by a range of buildings comprising the oldest homestead complex outside the County of Cumberland. The landscape is articulated by a range of buildings, early plantings and archaeological sites which illustrate the social and rural processes of settlement and the continuity of land use and circulation patterns. The \\"Cottage\\", built by 1823 as the first residence, remained in use after the main house, was completed in 1834 as the residence of Charles and Elizabeth Throsby. The main house is an excellent example of bungalow style homestead with a courtyard which is rare in New South Wales and demonstrates the needs of a large rural family. The associated stables building is an important example of early Victorian colonial design which remains in use as part of the riding school established in 1934 by the Throsby family. The property includes an important collection of colonial furniture purchased or donated in recent times as well as pieces associated with the Throsby family. In addition the property has been associated with significant nineteenth century figures including the Earl of Belmore, Bishop Barker and members of the Fairfax family. The complex is rare in having retained a close association with the Throsby family into the 1990s. Throsby Park was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. Throsby Park Historic Site has a strong and ongoing association with the Throsby family, initially with explorer and original grantee, Dr Charles Throsby and with his nephew Charles Throsby who did much to develop the property and establish the family fortune. Dr Charles Throsby was an important colonial figure who became a wealthy property owner, pastoralist, breeder of quality stock and he was one of the three private citizens selected as members of the first Legislative Council in NSW. His explorations did much to open up overland access to the Illawarra District and the Southern Highlands of New South Wales and was rewarded for his efforts by the opportunity to select 1000 acres anywhere in the area he had discovered. Charles and Elizabeth Throsby were largely responsible for the development of the property. He was a successful farmer and pastoralist who was a very successful tenderer to many of the road gangs and mounted police. Charles was responsible for the construction of Christ Church, Bong Bong, acted as the local Magistrate and became the first District Warden for Berrima District. He was a prominent member in his community, as were his descendants. Elizabeth Throsby was involved in a shipping disaster and immortalised as a child in a c.1814 painting now held in the National Gallery Canberra. Prominent visitors to the property include explorer James Backhouse as well as Governors Macquarie (who granted and named the property), Darling, and Fitzroy as well as Governor, Lord Belmont who leased the property as his summer residence. Conrad Martens painted the property in 1836. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. The aesthetic significance of Throsby Park Historic Site is high. The homestead is set in cultivated gardens on a hill with vast open vistas over the sweeping rural landscape. The associated outbuildings, separated from the homestead in their own precinct add to the historic context of the site. When viewed as a whole, the homestead and its associated outbuildings, its natural setting and landforms with cultivated gardens and pastures is evocative of its early 19th century origins and appearance. Possibly the work of John Verge, Throsby Park House is a significant architectural milestone in a progression towards an Australian rural residential form which was a combination of the country house, villa and cottage forms. It is a compromise between English architectural fashion, the climate, available building resources and the wealth and social aspirations of the Throsby family. The place has strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. Throsby Park Historic Site is of state significance as the first property developed outside the County of Cumberland and is an important milestone in opening up the Southern Highlands and the Berrima District. The property is of regional significance because of its association with the development of the Moss Vale district, in particular the establishment of Bong Bong and Berrima. It is also linked to the construction of Christ Church and the Royal Oak Inn at Bong Bong, as well as to the establishment of Bong Bong Picnic Race Club and the Moss Vale Jockey Club. It is also of ongoing significance to the descendants of the Throsby family. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. Throsby Park Historic Site contains numerous archaeological deposits, standing structures and features, which have the potential to provide insights into early colonial mixed farming operations and associated subsistence activities and into the lifestyle of wealthy colonial families of the period. The extant buildings and features have the potential to demonstrate period construction techniques and materials. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. Throsby Park Historic Site is a rare example of a pastoral property which has remained in the hands of one family from its granting in 1819 until 1975 and who still maintain an ongoing association with the property. Throsby Park house is a rare rural property with surviving 1820s farm buildings, which exhibits a strong sense of continuity from its colonial origins. Throsby Park was the first property developed outside the County of Cumberland and an important milestone in opening up the Southern Highlands and the Berrima district to settlement. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales. Throsby Park Historic Site contains representative examples of various elements associated with architecture, colonial society, workmanship and technology. Throsby Park House is a representative example of the 1830s large verandahed cottage type which is a sub-set of the Old Colonial Georgian architectural style. The farm buildings associated with the historic property are a fine, representative, early nineteenth century period set, although many are altered and all except the stables are now in private ownership. Throsby Cottage is a good although much altered example of the early cottages built by wealthy settlers as a stepping stone on their way to a larger and more sophisticated residence. By its alterations it demonstrates responses to changing occupational needs. The joinery in Throsby Park House represents a good example of high quality period workmanship. The furniture collection associated with Throsby Park provenanced to the place includes representative examples of fine early pieces and some early locally made pieces.

After his mother and only sibling died in England, his father, Joseph Jenckes Sr., immigrated to New England. A few years later, in about 1647, Jenckes Jr. joined his father at his forge in Massachusetts Bay Colony and learned his father's trade. In 1660, Jenckes was jailed for treason, a charge that was later dropped. Jenckes moved to the Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations where he became a successful businessman. He served many years in the Rhode Island General Assembly and was elected Speaker of the House. His son, Joseph, became the colony's governor. Early life Saugus Iron Works‚Äîreconstructed forge and millJoseph Jenckes Jr. was baptized , in Colnbrook, Buckinghamshire, England. He was the eldest of two children born to Joseph Jenckes Sr. (1599-1683) and Joan Hearne (1607-1635). In his youth he lived in Hounslow, Middlesex, where his father worked as a cutler in a sword factory. His mother died in 1635 and his only sibling, Elizabeth, died in 1638. About 1642, the widower Joseph Jenckes Sr. immigrated to New England and by 1645 he was working to establish an iron works, later called the Saugus Iron Works, at Hammersmith near Lynn in Massachusetts Bay Colony. By 1647, Jenckes Jr., who had remained in England, joined his father at the iron works. Imprisonment Sometime before 1660, after working with his father at the Saugus Iron Works, Jenckes moved to Concord to work at an iron smelting operation. When he returned to Lynn it was alleged that he made treasonous remarks in a tavern against King Charles II of England. He was arrested, imprisoned, and during a hearing on , the testimony of witnesses was entered into the record. Jenckes was accused by Nicholas Pinion of saying that \\"if he hade the King heir, he wold cutte of his head and make a football of it.\\" He was accused by Thomas Tower of saying \\"I should rather that his head were as his father's rather than he should come to England to set up popery there,\\" an allusion to the 1649 beheading of Charles I. On , the General Court of Massachusetts Bay Colony ruled in Jenckes's favor, citing his subsequent statement supporting the king. After a year of incarceration he apparently had a change of heart, so the charges were dropped and he was released. The decision was recorded as follows: Forge and sawmill owner Pawtucket Falls, circa 1815Sometime between 1661 and 1669, Joseph Jenckes Jr. moved to the Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations. In 1669, he was granted timbered land on both sides of the Pawtuxet River in Pawtuxet‚Äîthen southern Providence‚Äîwhere he erected a sawmill. His grant required him to provide lumber and timber rights to the proprietors. In 1671, he moved to Pawtucket‚Äîthen northern Providence‚Äîwhere he erected a forge and sawmill on the west side of present-day Blackstone River at Pawtucket Falls. A ready supply of bog iron ore nearby attracted him to the area. Jenckes initially purchased 60 acres from Abel and Rachel Potter and he received more than 100 acres of the commons between 1674 and 1685. Jenckes's Pawtucket forge and home were burned down In 1676 during King Philip's War, which was the first major conflict between Native Americans and New England colonists. The residents received a warning before the attack and were able to escape. Later that year he returned to Pawtucket to rebuild his home and business. Pawtucket's founding Joseph Jenckes/Jenks home markerWhen Joseph Jenckes Jr. purchased land in 1671 at Pawtucket Falls on the west side of the Blackstone River, the village of Pawtucket did not yet exist. He was not the first landowner or settler in the area, however. Roger Williams had previously purchased the land in 1636 from the Narragansett people. When Jenckes arrived Ezekiel Holliman, Thomas Estance, John Smith, Gregory Dextor, Stukely Westcott, and Abel Potter had owned land while Richard Scott and Daniel Comstack had built homes. But it was not until Jenckes built his forge and sawmill at the falls that this sparsely populated area become a village and eventually a center for metalworks and other trades. Jenckes built his home and forge on the south side of today's Main Street at East Avenue in Pawtucket. The forge was situated near the present-day Main Street Bridge where the river drops 30 feet. The site of Jenckes's home is marked by a plaque on the Pawtucket Boys Club Building at 53 East Avenue. Jenckes's business led to \\"additional industrial development on both sides of the river, including sawmills, grist mills, oil mills, potash manufacture, and shipyards.\\" Pawtucket was incorporated in 1823 and both sides of the river were combined into a single Rhode Island town in 1885. Public service Jenckes was made a freeman (voting citizen) of the Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations in 1677. He subsequently held several offices in the local and colonial governments. He was a member of the Providence Town Council, served as a moderator at town meetings, was a tax assessor, and performed marriages. In 1679, 1680, and 1691 he was elected deputy (town representative) to the colony's General Assembly. For thirteen years between 1680 and 1698 he was elected assistant (colonial representative) to the General Assembly. During his tenure in 1696, the General Assembly created two chambers: the House of Deputies (town representatives) and the Upper House (the governor, deputy governor, and assistants). Two years later he was elected Speaker of the House of Deputies‚Äînow Speaker of the House of Representatives‚Äîand was only the second person to hold that office. In 1690, Jenckes, along with six others, were selected to write an official communication on behalf of the colony to King William III and Queen Mary II congratulating them on their coronation and informing them of news in the colony. They informed the new monarchs that Sir Edmund Andros, the Governor of the Dominion of New England, had been arrested in the colony after a revolt against him in Boston. Family Joseph Jenckes Jr. married Esther Ballard (1632‚Äì1717) in about 1655 at Lynn, Massachusetts Bay. She was the daughter of William and Elizabeth Ballard. The Ballard family had arrived in Boston in 1635 aboard the James sailing from London. The Jenckeses had nine children: Joseph, b. 1656; Elizabeth, b. 1658; Sarah, b. 1660; Nathaniel, b. 1662; Esther, b. 1664; Ebenezer, b. 1668; Joanna, b. 1672; William, b. 1674; and Abigail, b. 1676. Several of his children had distinguished careers: Joseph was the 19th governor of the Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations, Ebenezer was an ordained minister at the First Baptist Church, and William was a judge and assemblyman. Death and legacy Joseph Jenckes Jr. died , in northern Providence, now Pawtucket. Two Pawtucket schools were named in his honor. Joseph Jenks Jr. High School‚Äîa high school no longer operating‚Äîwas built in 1896 at 300 Broadway. Joseph Jenks Junior High School was opened in downtown Pawtucket in the 1920s and moved in the 1980s to 350 Division Street where it was renamed Joseph Jenks Middle School. The street called Jenks Way in Pawtucket is near Pawtucket Falls.

Description Preserver was long overall and between perpendiculars with a beam of and a draught of . The ship had a displacement of , a gross register tonnage (GRT) of 2,347 tons and a deadweight tonnage (DWT) of 3,455 tons. The vessel was powered by diesel engines turning two screws with a designed speed of , but a maximum speed of . The ship had a range of at . The ship was either armed with one naval gun and two cannon or one 12-pounder naval gun. The ship was designed to be a Fairmile Motor Launch depot ship and was fitted with a machine shop, spare accommodations and extra fuel and store spaces. The vessel had a ship's company of 107, with 20 officers and 87 ratings. Service history =Canadian service= The vessel was constructed at the Marine Industries shipyard at Sorel, Quebec in 1941 and given the yard number 104. Preserver was launched on 21 December 1941 and completed in July 1942, ahead of sister ship . The ship was commissioned on 11 July 1942 at Sorel and sailed for Halifax, Nova Scotia on 4 August, escorting a Quebec-Sydney convoy en route. The ship was then assigned to Newfoundland Force as a base ship for the Fairmile B Motor Launches operating there. The ship arrived at St. John's, Newfoundland on 18 September. During the period at St. John's, Preserver became a refuelling station for all naval vessels within harbour as the main refuelling tanks at St. John's had not finished construction. Preserver and a flotilla of Fairmiles were deployed to Botwood, Newfoundland. Botwood had been planned as a new Royal Canadian Navy base and Preserver and the Fairmiles were sent there to protect the transports unloading aviation fuel at Lewisporte that was destined for the airfield at Gander. Preserver and the Fairmiles returned to St. John's in mid-December 1942, sailing for Botwood again the following July. At the end of July 1943, Preserver and the Fairmiles relocated to Red Bay, returning to St. John's in November. Due to strategic changes in the Atlantic theatre, Botwood was abandoned as a base and Preserver and the Fairmiles became the only Royal Canadian Navy vessels ever to deploy there. In mid-June 1944, Preserver and the Fairmiles returned to Red Bay. In September, they transferred to Sydney before Preserver sailed to Halifax for a refit. Upon returning to service, Preserver was sent to St. John's and then to Shelburne, Nova Scotia in June 1945. The ship was paid off on 6 November 1945 and sold to the Peruvian Navy on 4 January 1946. =Peruvian service and fate= The ship was re-designated a fleet supply ship and renamed Mariscal Castilla. The name commemorated the former president of Peru, Marshal Ram√≥n Castilla. The ship was renamed Cabo Blanco in 1951 and continued in Peruvian service until March 1961. The sources diverge from here on the fate of the vessel. Macpherson & Barrie, Colledge & Warlow, and Blackman all state the vessel was broken up for scrap. The Miramar Ship Index states the vessel was sold into commercial service to Agencia Nacional de Vapores Jose Poblete Vidal in 1960 and renamed Cayo Blanco and registered in Panama. In 1962, the ship was sold again, this time to Aninat & Bluhn and renamed Petronap. On 20 April 1963, Petronap caught fire and wrecked on San Lorenzo Island near Callao, Peru.

She is currently an associate professor of sociology at Boston University. Mears is the author of Pricing Beauty: The Making of a Fashion Model, and is regularly quoted in media as an academic expert in the culture and economics of fashion.  Early life and education  Mears grew up near Atlanta, Georgia. To supplement her regular job at a movie theater, she entered a modeling contest, won agency representation, and then started modeling part- time at the age of 16. Mears attended the University of Georgia but continued her modeling work by spending summers working overseas. After completing her undergraduate education, she spent a year modeling in Asia, then moved to New York City at the age of 23 to pursue a Ph.D. in sociology. In New York she was again scouted for modeling jobs, and decided to focus her graduate research on the culture and economics of the modeling industry. She lied about her age to get modeling jobs, then conducted a covert ethnographic study by taking notes and interviewing fellow models, scouts, and agents while working as a model in New York and London, including multiple appearances on the runway at New York Fashion Week.  Career  After earning her Ph.D. from New York University in 2009, Mears became an assistant professor of sociology at Boston University. In 2011 her book Pricing Beauty: The Making of a Fashion Model was published by the University of California Press. Sociologist Heather Laine Talley, writing in the American Journal of Sociology, noted that while Pricing Beauty is about \\"how fashion insiders create aesthetic value,\\" it also examines \\"the organization of markets, the process of cultural production, and reproduction of inequalities.\\" Mears found that most fashion models operate against their short-term economic interests by accepting low-paying jobs that they hope will lead to greater recognition and higher-prestige jobs, but that very few models ever successfully attain such recognition, with the rest gradually aging out of the industry, sometimes while in debt to their modeling agencies, or switching to more lucrative but less prestigious commercial modeling. Pricing Beauty identifies the industry's idiosyncratic beauty standards as a major obstacle to success for models, not only in preferring \\"size-zero\\" body types, but in preferring white women above other women even within the \\"size-zero\\" category. Like other \\"ethnic\\" models, Mears was specifically advised not to mention her Korean heritage at castings. Mears concluded that industry insiders were not simply reflecting social preferences, but were actively producing beauty images designed to reproduce what sociologist Laura Grindstaff, in her review for Gender & Society, called \\"the gendered and racialized value hierarchies attached to beauty.\\" A review in The Chronicle of Higher Education criticized this conclusion, suggesting that \\"Mears's attempts to make the numbers support her critique of the fashion industry for its whiteness reveal more about her wish to expose it than anything else.\\" Publishers Weekly noted that Pricing Beauty was \\"probably too complex for the average reader\\" but praised the book as \\"a well-researched, well-written, and thorough study of the industry.\\" Mears has also written for The New York Times about her research after Pricing Beauty, including her covert ethnographic research on women recruited by promoters to attend VIP parties and nightlife events. In addition to her own publications, Mears is regularly cited by print and web media on issues in culture, markets, and work, such as why many models come from one region of the United States, how celebrity scandals affect the reputation of popular hotels and nightspots, whether fashion modeling is indentured servitude, whether \\"sexbots\\" will replace spouses, and the emotional labor of women in the workplace.

History Although the majority of combatants had heavy field artillery prior to the outbreak of the First World War, none had adequate numbers of heavy guns in service, nor had they foreseen the growing importance of heavy artillery once the Western Front stagnated and trench warfare set in. Since aircraft of the period were not yet capable of carrying large diameter bombs the burden of delivering heavy firepower fell on the artillery. Two sources of heavy artillery suitable for conversion to field use were surplus coastal defense guns and naval guns. However, a paradox faced artillery designers of the time; while large caliber naval guns were common, large caliber land weapons were not due to their weight, complexity, and lack of mobility. Large caliber field guns often required extensive site preparation because the guns had to be broken down into multiple loads light enough to be towed by a horse team or the few traction engines of the time and then reassembled before use. Building a new gun could address the problem of disassembling, transporting and reassembling a large gun, but it did not necessarily address how to convert existing heavy weapons to make them more mobile. Rail transport proved to be the most practical solution because the problems of heavy weight, lack of mobility and reduced setup time were addressed. Design The Canon de 305 mod√®le 93/96 TAZ started life as eight surplus Canon de 305 mm Mod√®le 1893/96 naval guns which armed pre-dreadnought battleships of the Charlemagne, R√©publique, and Libert√©-class. The guns were typical built-up guns of the period which consisted of a rifled liner reinforced by layers of hoops. The guns used a Welin interrupted screw breech and fired separate loading bagged charges and projectiles. The guns sat on a top carriage traversing mount which sat on a large diameter geared steel ring. A rectangular steel firing platform sat on top of the platform with the barrel of the gun overhanging the platform at the front with an overhanging loading platform for the gunners to the rear. The firing platform was then traversed by a worm gear which attached to the base. To load the gun the barrel was lowered and there was an elevated shell handling trolley at the rear. The carriages consisted of rectangular steel bases, which were suspended on two railroad bogies. Each bogie had six axles. The number of axles was determined by the weight limit for European railways of per axle. Since the barrels were naval guns that were not intended for use at high angles of elevation the trunnions were relocated relatively far forward and the guns were nose heavy. The carriage used ground platform anchoring and site preparation included laying wooden beams parallel to the tracks then splicing in a section of rail bed reinforced with wooden beams under the center which the carriage was lowered onto. Outriggers and ground anchors were also used to stabilize the gun once in firing position as well as screw jacks. Although the mount was capable of 360¬∞ of traverse it was often limited to 10¬∞ left/right of the centerline because of problems with balance and recoil. Another issue for the mount was that although the gun could be elevated up to +40¬∞ it was limited to +20¬∞ of elevation when the gun was fired parallel to the tracks due to recoil. For these reasons, the weapon was not considered a success. The carriages were originally deployed in 1916 but it was too much gun for too little carriage so the barrels were later replaced with barrels by St Chamond and the Canon de 240 mod√®le 93/96 TAZ entered service in 1918.

Early years Fran√ßois d'Alesso d'√âragny was born on 21 November 1643. He was descended from Jean d'Alesso (1513‚Äì72), first known seigneur of √âragny, Val-d'Oise, treasurer of the constable Anne de Montmorency (1492‚Äì1567) and adviser of King Charles IX of France (1550‚Äì74). His parents were Fran√ßois d'Alesso d'√âragny (died 1645) and Denise Berruyer (‚Äì1699). On 20 April 1681 he married B√©n√©dicte Durand de Villeblain (‚Äì1742). They had a son, Alexandre Claude Fran√ßois d'Alesso d'√âragny (1688‚Äì1721). Fran√ßois d'Alesso d'√âragny became a captain of the guards regiment. An embassy from Siam led by Ok-khun Chamnan was dispatched to Louis XIV of France and Pope Innocent XI by the Siamese King Narai in 1688. The Siamese mission was accompanied by the Jesuit Father Guy Tachard and the French envoy extraordinary to Siam, Simon de la Loub√®re. In February 1689, the embassy was granted an audience with Louis XIV, and the treaty of commerce Claude C√©beret du Boullay had obtained in 1687 was ratified. Two weeks later a military treaty was signed that designated d'Eragny as captain of the palace guard in Ayutthaya and inspector of French troops in Siam. Martinique During the Nine Years' War (1688‚Äì97) the governor general of the Windward Islands Charles de Courbon de Bl√©nac resigned on 29 January 1690 after criticism of his lack of response to the English attacks on Saint Barthelemy, Marie-Galante and Saint Martin, and returned to France to defend himself at court. D'√âragny was appointed his successor in May 1690, but the marquis de Seignelay did not treat his departure as a matter of urgency. He told d'Eragny that Antilles-bound merchantmen would not receive escorts until the European campaign was over. He assigned one 36-gun frigate to d'Eragny, with one en fl√ªte transport and 300 soldiers. The first attempt to sail was driven back to France, and he finally left in mid-December 1690 escorting eight merchant vessels. In January 1691 a Spanish fleet landed 2,600 men at Cap‚ÄëFran√ßais on Saint-Domingue (now Haiti), joined by 700 men who had made their way from the Spanish part of the island on foot. They met the French defenders at Limonade, east of Le Cap, killed the governor Pierre-Paul Tarin de Cussy(fr) and 400‚Äì500 men, burned the town, massacred the men and took the women, children and slaves. Louis Ph√©lypeaux, comte de Pontchartrain had just taken charge of the ministry of marine when the news reached France. He at once appointed Jean-Baptiste du Casse to replace du Cussy, and dispatched him with the 48-gun Solide, 40-gun Cheval Marin and 36-gun '√âmerillon. D'Eragny was ordered to give du Casse whatever help he needed. D'Eragny arrived in Martinique on 5 February 1691 with 14 ships and began to strengthen the defenses. The French in Guadeloupe had been driven into Fort Saint-Charles(fr) and were besieged there by the English. When du Casse reached Martinique in May 1691 his ships forced the English to pull out of Guadeloupe. He stayed in the Windward Islands to consult with d'Eragny until an outbreak of yellow fever led him to depart. Death and legacy D'Eragny was among the victims of the yellow fever. He died on 18 August 1691 in Fort Royal, Martinique, at the age of 47. He is buried in the choir of the Fort-de- France Cathedral. His widow remained on the island with their only son Alexandre Fran√ßois. In 1711 Alexandre Fran√ßois d'Alesso d'√âragny married Catherine Pocquet, daughter of an important settler of Basse-Pointe, captain of militia and member of the sovereign council of Martinique. The family became major landowners in Martinique. His descendant Claire de Duras (1777‚Äì1828) was the heiress to an immense fortune in Martinique, where she took refuge with her mother (n√©e d‚ÄôAlesso d‚Äô√âragny) during the French Revolution.

It was built from 1822 to 1828. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  History  =James Atkinson ownership= Oldbury was established in 1822 by James Atkinson (1794-1834) on 3000 acres of land granted by Governor Macquarie. From 1822 Atkinson became a beneficiary of convict assignments. James Atkinson was born in 1794 in Oldbury, Kent and was a farmer. He arrived in NSW in 1820 as a free settler on the \\"Saracen\\". The land that would become Oldbury was granted by Macquarie, initially 800 acres, with conflicting sources as to whether it was in 1818 or 1821. In 1825 Atkinson returned to England and wrote \\"An Account of the State of Agriculture and Grazing in New South Wales\\". In his book Atkinson referred to emancipists and the poorer class in the Colony as Dungaree Settlers. The Sydney Gazette took Atkinson to task for being disrespectful to this class of people. Maguire (2002) adds that Atkinson published several papers on agricultural matters between 1826 and 1829 - the best known of which is the one cited above, which was favourably reviewed by English author and polymath publisher, John Claudius Loudon. Returning to Australia in 1826 he married Charlotte Waring, the governess of Hannibal Macarthur's children, and applied to the Colonial Secretary for more land (1200 acres), which he received, and then proceeded to build Oldbury in 1828. He built the first windmill and evidently started milling flour on his property as well as dairy farming. He was a progressive man and encouraged activities such as ploughing matches. At Oldbury he created a model farm which won widespread admiration.Oldbury Farm, 2014 Joseph Shelvey one of Atkinson's assigned convicts won a number of ploughing matches at Oldbury. In 1827 Atkinson was appointed a magistrate. He and Charles Throsby, another magistrate in the area, supervised the constables, lock-up keeper and clerk servicing their Court in Bong Bong. Two of AtKinson's best friends were Alexander Berry and Edward Wollstonecraft who were magistrate landowners on the Shoalhaven River. Berry and Wollstonecraft had a large number of assigned convicts. From time to time they requested Atkinson to come down to the Shoalhaven to order punishments for their convicts. Magistrates could not order the punishment of their own convicts. James Atkinson died in 1834, \\"a gentleman of considerable literary attainments and as a practical agriculturist second to none in the colony\\" wrote the Sydney Gazette. A Robbery at Oldbury About the 17 August 1829 a robbery took place at Oldbury when its storeroom was broken into. John Champley (a local store keeper) and his assigned servant John Yates with Joseph Shelvey were arrested for the crime. All three were subsequently sentenced to death at Campbelltown. The three were convicted primarily upon the evidence given by Patrick Brady also an assigned servant to James Atkinson.It was subsequently alleged that James Atkinson promised to give Brady a ticket of leave to give evidence at the trial. Upon appeal by their barrister, Roger Therry, Champley, Yates and Shelvey were reprieved from the gallows. Governor Darling then sent Champley and Shelvey to Norfolk Island and Yates to Moreton Bay About a year later two captured bushrangers from Jack Donohoe‚Äôs gang confessed to the robbery at Oldbury and Governor Bourke had Champley, Yates and Shelvey brought back to Sydney and pardoned. According to Sir Roger Therry one of the captured bushrangers, William Webber, before his execution, told James Atkinson where he had hidden the goods stolen in the Olbury robbery. He told Atkinson they were under a pile of stones and were still there. If Atkinson did find the stolen goods it would appear he never informed the Government. Charlotte Atkinson Surprisingly by 5 February 1835 Charlotte Atkinson declined the erection of a public monument in memory of her late husband that had been proposed by public subscription. Then on 30 January 1836 Mrs Atkinson and her overseer at Olbury, George Bruce Barton left Olbury for the purpose of an inspection of some of Mrs Atkinson‚Äôs sheep stations at Belanglo. During this time the two were bailed up by armed unidentified bushrangers. The bushrangers gave Barton a severe flogging with a stock whip and threatened to flog Mrs Atkinson although they did not do so. The bushrangers accused Mrs Atkinson of allowing her men to mistreat her assigned convicts. Strangely enough shortly after in March Charlotte married Barton. An attempt was made to murder Barton on 30 June 1838 at Olbury. Charlotte and Barton were sitting at their parlow window when an unknown assailant fired a gun at Barton. The ball passed through Barton's clothing but did not kill him. Iron gang convicts were suspected of the crime. Charlotte wrote the first published children's book in Australia: 'A Mother's offering to her children'. Louisa Atkinson The youngest daughter of James and Charlotte Caroline Louisa Waring Atkinson (1834-1872) was born just 8 weeks before James died. Always delicate, she spent her youth writing and collecting and drawing animals and botanical specimens near her home(s) - first at Oldbury and later at \\"Kurrajong\\" (Fernhurst) in the Blue Mountains and on the South Coast of NSW. A keen horse rider, she would set out on horseback to gain access to deep gullies and high ridges. At 23 she published her first novel, \\"Gertrude the Immigrant: a Tale of Colonial Life\\" which was to be followed by five more (some were serialised in the \\"Sydney Mail\\" (1861‚Äì72) and regular columns in the \\"Sydney News\\" (1853‚Äì55), \\"Sydney Morning Herald\\" and \\"The Sydney Mail\\" (1860‚Äì71), where her columns entitled \\"A Voice from the Country\\" were often accompanied by her own sketches. It was as a botanist however that her contributions were most valuable. She corresponded with the leading botanists of the day, including (making collections of botanical specimens for) The Rev. William Woolls (of Parramatta) and Baron Ferdinand von Mueller (Govt. Botanist of Victoria, Director of the Royal Botanic Gardens, Melbourne), who named a species of mistletoe, Atkinsonia ligustrina after her. Xanthosia atkinsoniana, Erechtites atkinsoniae (now Senecio bipinnatisectus) and the heath Epacris calvertiana also carry her name(s).Maguire, 2002, 34-35 Atkinson was as well as a botanist, a naturalist, artist and author of many books on native flora and fauna. Louisa Atkinson, her sisters and brother spent their earliest years in this house, garden, farm and surrounds. She became one of Australia's earliest botanical explorers. The first Australian native-born woman novelist (as E. Morris Miller's \\"Australian Literature\\" attests), Louisa was one of the earliest women journalists. She was also an artist of technical ability and great verve of expression.Crittendon, 1996, 18-19 In 1869 Louisa married explorer and naturalist James Calvert (1825‚Äì84) who had accompanied Ludwig Leichhardt on his 1844-45 expedition. Always interested in horticulture, he won a medal at the 1862 International Exhibition in London for his entry on the possible commercial cultivation of native flax.Maguire, 2002, 35 Her regular popular natural history columns in the \\"Sydney Morning Herald\\" were re-published by Victor Crittenden in two volumes through his Mulini Press in 1978 as \\"A Voice from the Country\\" (the pseudonym Atkinson used for the articles - it was not common for authors to sign their work in those days) and as \\"Excursions from Berrima and a Trip to Manaro and Molonglo in the 1870s\\", which was articles about her travels and botanical searches on the Southern Tablelands of NSW. Louisa's first novels originally appeared as serials in The Sydney Mail and only her first two novels, \\"Gertrude the Emigrant\\" and \\"Cowanda, the Veteran's Grant\\" were published as books in her lifetime. \\"Myra\\", \\"The Debatable Ground\\" and 'Tom Hellicar's Children' were re-published by Mulini Press. 'Tom Hellicar's Children' paints a picture of childhood in the Berrima district and recalled her own memories of life at Oldbury. The novel recounts the cruel treatment of three children by their guardian uncle. They are dispossessed of their idealistic home as Louisa was when her father died and the whole family fled from their brutal alcoholic stepfather. Elizabeth Lawson's book \\"The Distant Sound of Native Voices\\" focused on Atkinson's writings on Aboriginals - some of Louisa's earliest published illustrations were of Aboriginal remains near Oldbury. Lawson's 1995 book \\"The Natural Art of Louisa Atkinson\\" Louisa's writings and artwork. Louisa was trained in art by her mother Charlotte, who had in turn received lessons from John Glover. Louisa prepared a book of her own artwork for publication, which has never been traced. It was to include the botanical and flower paintings, birds and animals of NSW. Ferdinand von Muller, with whom she had corresponded on botany over the years, had sent the book to Germany to have the illustrations engraved by experts. The book was never published as she died while it was in preparation and it disappeared. It may have been burnt in the great bonfires at Oldbury when the house was sold some years after her death. She died tragically in 1872.Crittenden, 1996, 18-19 She died tragically just 18 days after giving birth to her only child, a daughter, Louise Snowden Calvert.Maguire, 2000, 35 The avenue of English (European) elms was planted by James Atkinson, his idea being to continue them to Mereworth, as a link to his brother John's property, Mereworth. John's property, Mereworth is situated on the western side of the (present) Hume Highway from Oldbury and the two were connected by an unsealed road (now bissected by the realigned Hume Highway). =Post-1834= Following James Atkinson's death in 1834, his executors decided to lease the property and sell the stock, providing his widow an income to allow her to live in Sydney. His widow, son (also James Atkinson) and daughter Louisa later returned to the property. Louisa's marriage to Calvert was held in the sitting room at Oldbury Farm in 1870. James Atkinson junior and then Louisa Atkinson inherited the property in turn. The roof was altered in form and materials in the 1920s. It was owned by Montague Nicholson in the 1940s, who referred to the farm as \\"Swanton\\". The house was reportedly untenanted for long periods until its restoration 1960s by J. McDonald. The house had a corrugated iron in the 1960s. In 1983, the house underwent a total restoration by Clive Lucas & Partners, including putting the roof back to its original 1920s form, reshingling the roof, and reconstructing the portico and front steps, based on measured drawings by William Hardy Wilson in the 1910s-20s. In the 1970s, it was owned by prominent advertising agency figure Elizabeth Dangar, who was married there in 1979. A program in recent years of rejuvenation, replanting and revival of laid hawthorn hedges on the farm has been implemented. Hedge laying is an old European practice which produces stock-proof farm hedges. A similar program of rejuvenation of the garden has been underway in recent years.  Description  The historic group consists of the Oldbury house, the garden, service yards and outbuildings and the surrounding farming property. The property also contains a swimming pool, tennis court and pavilion. =Setting= Oldbury Farm is set on a rise at the north-western footslopes of Mt. Gingenbullen, situated at the end of hawthorn- hedge (Crataegus oxycantha) and European elm tree (Ulmus procera)-copse- enclosed road (some Monterey cypress (Cupressus macrocarpa) and some Arizona cypress (Cupressus glabra) flank Oldbury Road. Surrounding paddocks are edged with hawthorn hedges, many of these re-laid in recent years in the traditional English / European manner, cutting their trunks almost through, laying vertical trunks and branches down horizontally or on an angle, pinning these to vertical stakes and encouraging coppicing shoots from the base, to keep the hedges stock-proof and dense right to the base Oldbury Creek winds through the property, crossing Oldbury Road which is unsealed. Copses of willow (Salix sp., likely crack willow, Salix fragilis) line the creek, along with hawthorn seedlings (from former hedges on the property) The homestead complex is protected by shelter belts of hawthorns and Bhutan cypresses (Cupressus torulosa). Some old and tall Monterey pines (Pinus radiata) to the house's southwest frame the garden and shelter it from westerly winds (strong in this area). The homestead itself is approached by a single gravel drive, with a large carriage loop directly in front of the house. The drive divides and a rear drive winds around the eastern side of house and garden to a range of outbuildings and service yards and the rear garden and paddocks. To Oldbury Farm's south-east and slightly uphill on Oldbury Road is Oldbury Cottage, a (at times) separately-held property on Oldbury Road, historically part of the broader Oldbury Farm estate. This comprises a stone cottage and outbuildings, with garden and surrounded by protective Monterey pines and hawthorn hedging. The homestead complex is surrounded by large exotic trees and lawns.Stuart Read, pers.comm., 30 August 2013 =House= Oldbury is a simple, two-storey, Colonial, Georgian house which retains its original joinery. The roof has a single pitch with a longer slope at the rear, covering rooms in which the floor level is lower than those in front of the house. At each end of the stone flagged verandah at the rear of the house there is a separate stone building - one previously a kitchen, and the other one a dairy. It has a separate kitchen, eight rooms, a hall, passages, offices and cellar beneath. It is built of stone, with a (non original) timber shingle roof and has a simple, Doric, timber portico. It has small paned casement windows and six panelled doors set in panelled jambs with elaborate architraves. The entrance door is a wide pair of French windows with Georgian glazing. The wide entrance hall with a timber, cantilevered stair, beneath which a door with a semi- circular fanlight leads to the rear of the house, is particularly fine. In the living room, to the left of the hall on entering, is a cedar fireplace of unusual design and good craftsmanship. The cellars are formed by the deep foundations and paved with brick and stone. Its ceilings are lined with lathe and plaster. The house is in good condition. =Garden= From the gates (modern) a short straight section of drive leads into a large circular carriage loop. A level, approximately semi circular area before the house is raised above the carriage drive and approached from it by stone steps from which a straight central stone flagged path leads to the house. Old illustrations suggest that this garden before the house was formerly hedged and there is evidence of a gate being set at the top of the steps. The eastern side of this terrace has been roughly stone flagged in recent years. The garden was sheltered on the west by a border planting of old and tall Monterey pines (Pinus radiata); however, all but one has been removed in recent years. It retains a Himalayan cedar (Cedrus deodara) to the house's southwest. Some older oaks (Quercus sp.) in front and east of the house and old Mediterranean cypress (Cupressus sempervirens) to the house's rear/south. A modern drive branches off the carriage loop near (south-east of) the house to lead to the garages converted from outbuildings to the house's south-east and replacing the older service drive to the east which was separate to the main drive. Although the terrace and carriage circle appear to be of mid nineteenth century form, it is possible that they are not contemporary.National Trust of Australia, 1981 One large old Monterey pine to the east of the house and side drive remains and other younger Monterey pines to the house's east. Otherwise apart from the many old elms on the garden's edges, the road and paddocks, some very old shrubs, such as common lilac (Syringa vulgaris cv.), Cotoneaster sp., fruit trees such as plum (Prunus domestica cv.), apple (Malus sylvestris cv.) at the rear, there is little more old planting. A range of modern planting has been added since the 1990s including an extent of Leyland cypress (x Cuprocypatis leylandii 'Leighton's Green') hedging to the house's rear, compartmentalising the rear garden and \\"home paddock\\". To the house's south- west are a vegetable garden area and beyond that, a line of Monterey cypress and another of Leyland cypress have been added to on the east by another of sweet gums (Liquidambar styraciflua). The space between the two cypress rows has been converted into a \\"native walk\\" or garden, with topiary shaping of native species since April 2013. It is intended to extend this up the slope of Mount Gingenbullen through native corridors in the farm's paddocks. In particular since 2013 a programme of rejuvenation of the garden and farm has been underway. Old flagged paths have been relaid in sandstone. Adjoining areas of farm paddock have been incorporated into the garden as \\"nature garden\\", magnolia walk, prairie garden and arboretum (tree collection). The aim is to surround the historic core with parkland lawns and extend towards Oldbury Cottage garden, without disturbing the historic character of Oldbury. Landscape designers Chris and Charlotte Webb advised on design and plant selection to the two gardeners on site. Under the elms at the front gate and drive thousands of European bluebells (Endymion non-scriptus) have been planted for their blue spring flowers. Benches and a small bridge over the new stream or prairie garden have been added. The latter is planted with perennials and decorative grasses in 2013. This creek flows when there is enough rain to overflow the large farm dam above (south-east of the house). To the northeast of the dam and house garden a new 5 acre arboretum with a loop walk has been created since 2013, in converted farm paddocks. A pinetum (collection of pine species), native garden, firepit and lookout on the top of the spur to the north-east have been added. At the top end of the loop walk is a new hedge of hawthorn, as part of an ongoing program of farm hawthorn hedge relaying and replanting. At the bottom near the dam is a very old hedge relayed in 2012. On the western side of the house, broadleaf trees have been planted. On the east side, the Chinese pistachio (Pistacia chinensis) and golden elm (Ulmus x hollandica 'Lutescens'). Hybrid plane trees (Platanus x hybrida) flank the side drive to the house's east.  Heritage listing  Oldbury Farm Group is significant as one of the earliest farms in the area and because of the quality and high degree of intactness of the main homestead. The significance of the site is further enhanced by its large and attractively landscaped grounds - which include numerous mature early 19th century trees - and through its association with James and Caroline Louisa Atkinson. Oldbury is significant as an early and stylistically rare representative of Colonial Georgian country house (its lack of a verandah making it a reasonable contemporary English Georgian farmhouse). The building's significance is further enhanced by its extensive and attractively landscaped setting with mature 19th century trees, the quality of its original craftsmanship and detailing, its aesthetic integrity and the high degree of intactness of original features and fabric (assisted by careful and appropriate conservation). Oldbury resembles a small English farmhouse, particularly in its setting of English trees which do well in this locality. Its style is unusual in Australia, and it is an interesting example of the good building craftsmanship of the time, in what was in 1828 quite a remote area of settlement (National Trust of Australia (NSW), 1981). The importance of the garden relies solely on its rare surviving layout - the rare combination of a small, formerly enclosed, \\"cottage\\" garden before the house, giving onto an impressively scaled carriage circle. The use of small enclosed gardens before homesteads appears to have been quite common once but few are now intact, their boundaries having been extended. Few appear to have been raised and as carefully formed as that at Oldbury, or formed in conjunction with a carriage loop. A similar raised garden but without a carriage loop survives at Meadowvale, Appin. There is no planting of special interest Survey of Gardens in NSW - National Trust of Australia (NSW), 1981 Oldbury Farm was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.

He is best known for being received as the first ambassador of Colombia by U.S. President James Monroe on June19, 1822. This act represented the first U.S. recognition of a former Spanish colony's independence. Born in Spain, he lived as a young adult in the colony of New Granada (present-day Colombia). After being implicated in a conspiracy against the monarchy he fled in 1794, arriving in the United States in 1796. From Philadelphia he spent the rest of his life advocating for independence of the Spanish colonies in the Americas. Working closely with newspaper editor William Duane he produced English- and Spanish-language articles, pamphlets and books. During the Spanish American wars of independence he was a central figure in directing the work of revolutionary agents in North America, who frequently visited his home. In 1819 Torres was appointed a diplomat for Venezuela, which that year united with New Granada to form Gran Colombia. As charg√© d'affaires he negotiated significant weapons purchases but failed to obtain public loans. Having laid the groundwork for the diplomatic recognition of Colombia, he died less than a month after achieving this goal. Though largely unknown today, he is remembered as an early proponent of Pan- Americanism. Early life Manuel Torres was born in the Spanish region of C√≥rdoba in early November 1762. His mother's family was from the city of C√≥rdoba while his father's side was probably from nearby Baena. He was descended from the minor nobility on both sides of his family, a class with social stature but not necessarily wealth. Antonio Caballero y G√≥ngora, Torres' uncle In the spring of 1776 the young Torres sailed to Cuba with his maternal uncle Antonio Caballero y G√≥ngora, who was consecrated there as bishop of M√©rida in the Viceroyalty of New Spain (modern Mexico). Torres would later attribute his republican ideals to his uncle, a man of the Enlightenment who was an extensive collector of books, art, and coins. After Caballero y G√≥ngora was promoted to archbishop of Santa F√© de Bogot√° the family arrived in New Granada (modern Colombia) on June 29, 1778. At age 17 Torres began working for the secretariat of the Viceroyalty and for the royal treasury. In the following seven years he learned finance and was able to observe the political and social conflicts in New Grenada, including the Revolt of the Comuneros. This was also the time of the American Revolution, which Spain joined against Great Britain. Caballero y G√≥ngora became viceroy in 1782 and ruled as a liberal modernizer. Torres went to France in early 1785 to study at the , where he spent about a year and half learning military science and mathematics. As lieutenant of engineers () he probably aided Colonel Domingo Esquiaqui's survey and helped reorganize the colonial garrisons. On presentation by the archbishop-viceroy, Torres was gifted land near Santa Marta by CharlesIV and established a successful plantation, which he named San Carlos. Torres married and at San Carlos had a daughter. He became involved with political liberals of Bogot√°'s class (i.e., native New Granadians of European descent), joining a secret club led by Antonio Nari√±o where radical ideas were discussed freely. When in 1794 Nari√±o and other club members were implicated in a conspiracy against the Crown, Torres fled New Granada without his family. He first went to Cura√ßao, and in 1796 to Philadelphia,1797 is given by ; but for 1796 see ; ; . then the capital of the United States. =Arrival in Philadelphia= Spanish Americans heading north tended to go to Philadelphia, Baltimore or (French-controlled) New Orleans, centers of commercial relations with the colonies. Philadelphia in particular was a symbol of republican ideals, which may have attracted Torres. Its trade with the Spanish colonies was significant and the American Philosophical Society was the first learned society in the U.S. to nominate Spanish American members. At St.Mary's Church he joined a cosmopolitan community of Roman Catholics, including many from Spanish and French America. Influenced by Torres, William Duane and his Aurora became advocates for Spanish American independence. Quick to make American contacts, Torres became close friends with William Duane, who became editor of the Philadelphia newspaper Aurora in 1798. The editor continually published Torres' views on Spanish American independence in the paper, whose contents would be copied by others. Torres translated Spanish pamphlets for Duane, and sometimes translated Duane's editorials to Spanish. In Spanish America the purpose of this literature was to praise the United States as an example of independent representative government to be emulated; in the United States it was to increase support for the independence movements. Initially Torres was quite wealthy and received remittances from his wife, which helped him make important social connections. However, he had his money invested in risky merchant ventures; on one occasion he lost $40,000, on another $70,000‚Äîthus he was forced to live more modestly in later years. Three years after Torres' arrival, a \\"Spaniard in Philadelphia\\" wrote the pamphlet ' (released in English as Observations on the Commerce of Spain with her Colonies, in Time of War). The author, probably Torres, criticizes Spanish colonialism. In particular, Spain monopolized trade with the colonies to their detriment: during wartime the mother country could not supply the colonies with essential goods, and in peacetime the prices were too high. The author's solution is to implement a system of free trade in the Americas. The pamphlet was reprinted in London by William Tatham. Torres' residence increased the attraction of Philadelphia for Spanish American revolutionaries. Torres probably met Francisco de Miranda (also exiled after a failed conspiracy) in 1805, shortly before Miranda's failed expedition to the Captaincy General of Venezuela, and he met with Sim√≥n Bol√≠var in 1806. The Spanish minister to the United States, Carlos Mart√≠nez de Irujo, reported Torres' activity to his superiors. Coordinating revolutionaries During the instability caused by Napoleon Bonaparte's conquest of Spain‚Äîthe Peninsular War‚Äîthe people of the colonies followed the model of Peninsular Spanish provinces by organizing juntas to govern in the absence of central rule. Advocates of independence, who called themselves Patriots, argued that sovereignty reverted to the people when there was no monarch. They clashed with the Royalists, who supported the authority of the Crown. Starting in 1810 the Patriot juntas successively declared independence, and Torres was their natural point of contact in the United States. =Brokered weapons shipments= Although President James Madison's administration officially recognized no governments on either side, Patriot agents were permitted to seek weapons in the U.S., and American ports became bases for privateering. Torres acted as an intermediary between the newly arrived agents and influential Americans, such as introducing (Sim√≥n's brother) to wealthy banker Stephen Girard. Juan Vicente successfully purchased weapons for Venezuela, but was lost at sea on his return journey in 1811. Together with Tel√©sforo de Orea from Venezuela, and Diego de Saavadra and Juan Pedro de Aguirre from Buenos Aires, Torres brokered a plan to purchase 20,000 muskets and bayonets from the U.S. government. Girard agreed to finance the plan on the joint credit of Buenos Aires and Venezuela, but Secretary of State James Monroe blocked it by refusing to reply. Savaadra and Aguirre managed to ship only 1,000 muskets to Buenos Aires, but by the end of 1811 Torres had helped Orea supply Venezuela with about 24,000 weapons. New purchasers continued to arrive, and the supplies were an important contribution while the revolutionaries were suffering many defeats. The new Spanish minister, Lu√≠s de On√≠s, covertly attempted to disrupt the weapons shipments. He became aware of the plan to purchase from the U.S. arsenal due to being informed by a postman. On√≠s reported on these subversive activities and his agents harassed suspected revolutionaries like Torres. Francisco Sarmiento and Miguel Cabral de Noro√±a, two associates of On√≠s, attempted to assassinate Torres in 1814‚Äîapparently on the minister's orders. Due to his aid for the revolution, Torres' estate in Royalist-controlled New Granada was confiscated after his wife and daughter died. =Public writing= Running out of money during this period, Torres sustained himself in part by teaching. With Louis Hargous he wrote an adaptation for both English- and Spanish-teaching of Nicolas Gou√Øn Dufief's Nature Displayed in Her Mode of Teaching Language to Man. The lengthy book's title page styles Torres and Hargous as \\"professors of general grammar\\"; in the introduction they argue the importance to Americans of studying Spanish literature. Influential revised editions by Mariano Vel√°zquez de la Cadena were published in New York (1825) and London (1826). Soon after Nature Displayed followed the 1812 pamphlet ' (\\"A Republican's Manual for the Use of a Free People\\"), which Torres probably wrote. Structured as a dialog, the anonymous pamphlet offers a defense of the U.S. system of government based on the philosophy of Jean-Jacques Rousseau, and argues it should be a model for Spanish America. The contents suggest the author is \\"a conservative partisan of Jeffersonian democracy\\". writes Torres' authorship \\"is possible\\"; writes he \\"probably\\" wrote it and infers Torres' Jeffersonianism. Besides Duane's Aurora, Torres sent news and opinion to Baptis Irvine's Baltimore Whig and New York Columbian, Jonathan Elliot's City of Washington Gazette, and Hezekiah Niles' Baltimore Weekly Register. He acquainted himself with notables such as Congressman Henry Clay, lawyer Henry Marie Brackenridge, Baltimore Postmaster John Stuart Skinner, Judge Theodorick Bland and Patent Office head William Thornton. Especially the support of Clay, who became a champion of Spanish American independence in Congress, permitted him to lobby many influential officials. =Economic proposals= Robert Patterson, director of the U.S. Mint (pictured in 1908), endorsed Torres' book. Torres' lobbying included domestic affairs; in February1815, near the end of War of 1812 that had preoccupied the American public, he wrote two letters to President Madison describing a proposal for fiscal and financial reform.Torres to Madison, February11, 1815, Library of Congress, Manuscript Division, James Madison Papers, ; Torres to Madison, February25, 1815, James Madison Papers, . This included an equal and direct tax on all property, which Torres considered more just; ultimately he calculated a $1million budget surplus under his scheme and suggested gradual elimination of the national debt. In his December5 message to Congress, Madison did propose two ideas that Torres had favored: the establishment of a second Bank of the United States and utilizing it to create a uniform national currency. The same year, Torres authored An Exposition of the Commerce of Spanish America; with some Observations upon its Importance to the United States., refers to this book as two separate works. This work, published in 1816, was the first inter-American handbook. Torres plays on Anglo-American rivalry by arguing for the importance of establishing American over British commercial interests in this critical region, just as revolutionary agents in Britain suggested the opposite. Applying political economy, he observes that a country with a negative balance of trade‚Äîlike the United States‚Äîneeds a source of gold and silver specie‚Äîlike South America‚Äîto stabilize its currency and economy. The political commentary is interwoven with practical advice to merchants, followed by conversion tables between currencies and units of measure. He momentarily returned to economics in April1818. Through Clay, Torres suggested to Congress that he had discovered a new way to make revenue collection and spending more efficient, which he would reveal in detail if he was promised a share of the government's savings. The preliminary proposal was referred to the House Committee on Ways and Means, which declined to examine it for being too complex. =Philadelphia junta= By 1816, Spanish American propagandists had solidified American public opinion in favor of the Patriots. However, the propaganda victories did not translate into practical success: the Royalists reconquered New Granada and Venezuela by May 1816. Pedro Jos√© Gual, who had come to the United States to represent those governments, instead worked with Torres on a plan to liberate New Spain. They were joined by a number of other agents to form a \\"junta\\" of their own, which included Orea, Mariano Montilla, Jos√© Rafael Revenga, Juan Germ√°n Roscio from Venezuela, Miguel Santamar√≠a from Mexico, as well as from Buenos Aires. This Philadelphia junta surrounding Torres conspired in mid-1816 to invade a New Spanish port using ships commanded by French privateer Louis Aury. This plan failed because Aury's fleet was reduced to seven ships, making it unable to capture any major port. But the plotters were able to organize a force under the recently arrived General Francisco Xavier Mina (despite the obstructions of Jos√© Alvarez de Toledo, an acquaintance of Torres who was actually spying for On√≠s). The operation was funded by a group of merchants from Baltimore, where Torres traveled to oversee it. The exiled priest Servando Teresa de Mier had traveled to the U.S. with Mina, and became a good friend of Torres. He brought to Mexico with him two copies of Torres' Exposition and one of the . The expedition sailed September 1816, but in just over a year Mina was captured and shot. Proclamation by Aury as \\"Commander-in- chief of the Floridas\\" Another of the agents to join the junta was Lino de Clemente, who in 1816 came to the United States as Venezuelan charg√© d'affaires (a diplomat of the lowest rank). Torres became his secretary in Philadelphia. Clemente was one of the men who signed Gregor MacGregor's commission to seize Amelia Island off the coast of Florida, what became a political scandal known as the Amelia Island affair. All who had been involved became intolerable to Monroe. The Philadelphia junta effectively disbanded because of the event, which Sim√≥n Bol√≠var disavowed. Secretary of State John Quincy Adams refused any further communication with Clemente. Although Torres participated, he had discreetly avoided public involvement. (Privately he derided \\"Don Quixote\\" Aguirre and Pazos.)\\"\\" Torres to Juan Germ√°n Roscio, April12, 1819, in . In October1818, Bol√≠var thus instructed Clemente to return home and to transfer his duties as charg√© d'affaires to Torres. Diplomat for Colombia Patriot victory at the Battle of Boyac√° Torres' appointment coincided with a turn in the wars of independence. Where before the situation had been dire, the Patriot forces under Bol√≠var began a campaign to liberate New Granada and achieved a famous victory at the Battle of Boyac√°. When Torres received his diplomatic credentials he was authorized \\"to do in the United States everything possible to put an immediate end to the conflict in which the patriots of Venezuela are now engaged for their independence and liberty.\\" Venezuela and New Granada united on December17, 1819, to form the Republic of Colombia (a union called Gran Colombia by historians). Francisco Antonio Zea was first appointed Colombia's envoy to the United States but never went there; Torres was authorized to take over his duties on May15, 1820, and thus formally empowered to negotiate for the republic. He would try to secure its independence by three methods: by purchasing weapons and other military supplies, by obtaining a loan, and by obtaining diplomatic recognition of its government. =Weapons purchases= With the help of Samuel Douglas Forsyth, an American citizen sent from Venezuela by Bol√≠var, Torres was instructed to procure thirty thousand muskets on credit. This sum was not realistically available from private sources, in part due to the Panic of 1819. Torres did make substantial deals, especially with Philadelphia merchant Jacob Idler, who represented a network of business associates. In one such contract, signed April4, 1819, Idler promised a total of $63,071.50 of supplies, including 4,023 muskets and 50 quintals of gunpowder. After delivery Colombia was obliged to make payment in gold, silver or the tobacco produce of the Barinas province. More agreements on this model followed as merchants gained confidence with the news of successive Patriot victories. From December1819 to April1820 negotiated contracts worth $108,842.80 () and in the summer, Torres made a deal for the Colombian navy. Although Torres repeatedly wrote to his superiors about the great importance of maintaining Colombia's credit among American merchants, the government failed to make payment as agreed. In spite of this Torres was able to negotiate continued shipments, even with merchants who had unpaid claims. After independence, such claims became a significant problem of U.S. relations with South America; Idler's estate would litigate them up to the end of the century. Nevertheless, Torres obtained from Idler 11,571 muskets, and other supplies such as shoes and uniforms. They arrived in Venezuela in 1820‚Äì1821 aboard the Wilmot and Endymion. Monroe's cabinet was initially divided over the proposed sale. (The Birth of the Monroe Doctrine by Clyde O. DeLand, 1912) In February 1820, Torres came to Washington to purchase twenty thousand muskets from the U.S. government‚Äîa source that could fill what he could not obtain from private merchants. Monroe delayed by responding that the Constitution prevented him from selling weapons without the consent of Congress, but his cabinet considered a missive from Torres. This missive argued for the sale by emphasizing the common interests of the American republics against the European monarchies. Secretary of War John C. Calhoun and Secretary of the Navy Smith Thompson were supportive, and Torres had estimated the House of Representatives was in his favor. However, Secretary of State Adams emphatically spoke against what he considered a violation of American neutrality, causing the cabinet to unanimously decline the request in a meeting on March29. The next day Adams explained his feelings to Monroe: Despite this skepticism, Adams trusted Torres to inform him on Spanish American affairs, perhaps because Torres was also strongly supportive of the United States. Torres made six repeat visits to Adams through February19, 1821, without success. =Attempted borrowing= The Second Bank of the United States (completed 1824) Recognizing the financial difficulty the Colombian government was in, Torres attempted to borrow money in the United States on its behalf. Aided by a letter of introduction from Henry Clay, in the fall of 1819 he proposed a $500,000 loan () to Langdon Cheves, president of the Second Bank of the United States. It would be repaid with Colombian bullion, which the Bank was severely short of, within 18 months. When the Bank stated it had no authority to lend to foreign governments, Torres restated his proposal as a of bullion. He also contacted Adams, who said the government had no objection and left it to the Bank directors' judgment, and gained Cheves' support. Despite continued negotiation this loan was never finalized‚Äîlet alone Bol√≠var's bolder proposal for the Bank to take on the entirety of Venezuela's national debt in exchange for the Santa Ana de Mariquita silver mine in New Granada. Colombia had poor credit, and Torres believed the distressed Bank was actually unable to make the loan. To improve Colombia's financial reputation Torres circulated several public memorials, and he continued to seek loans from other sources. Idler introduced him to Philip Contteau, the American agent of the Dutch merchant firm Mees, Boer and Moens. On April8, 1820, Torres and Contteau negotiated a loan of $4million ($) at eight percent interest. Colombia would maintain a state monopoly on Barinas tobacco, and would give sole control of the tobacco to Mees, Boer and Moens until the proceeds had repaid the loan. These terms were sent to Colombia and Holland for approval. Torres was instructed to borrow as much as $20million ($), an impossible request. He did hope to build on his success by borrowing an additional $1million ($) with participation from the U.S. government. He made the request to Adams during the winter of 1820‚Äì1821, and obtained support from Monroe and Secretary of the Treasury William H. Crawford. However, like the weapons purchase, this proposal failed due to Adams' commitment to neutrality. The loan in its original form was approved by the Colombian government, but before the Dutch lenders could agree to it Barinas was recaptured by the Royalists. Without the source of tobacco on which repayment depended, the bankers rejected the loan. Thus, Torres was ultimately unable to borrow any money for Colombia. Historian Charles Bowman assessed Torres as a talented negotiator with an \\"exceptional knowledge of high finance\\", who failed due to circumstances beyond his control. =Influence in pamphleteering= Servando Teresa de Mier In June 1821, Mier returned to Philadelphia after escaping imprisonment in Havana, and moved into Torres' house. (Another Spanish American agent, Vicente Rocafuerte, was already living there.) Connected through Freemasonry, Torres became a father figure to Mier, signing his letters He gradually drew Mier away from constitutional monarchism and toward the republican model of the United States. In doing so Torres tried to provide a political-philosophical basis for Mier's radicalism. The pair encouraged Colombia to send a diplomat to Mexico, hoping to counter the rising monarchism there. When Mier published his as well as a new edition of Bartolom√© de Las Casas' , Torres paid the costs. Torres, Mier and Rocafuerte worked together to publish numerous articles over the next few months. The nature of their cooperation is disputed. Historian Jos√© de On√≠s mentions that \\"some Spanish American critics assert that Torres' works are generally regarded as having been written by Mier and Vicente Rocafuerte. This would be hard to verify.\\" But Charles Bowman gives the opposite interpretation: \\"It is likely that several of the works generally attributed to either Mier or Rocafuerte were actually from Torres' pen.\\" In particular, Bowman believes a pamphlet bearing Mier's name, , was actually Torres' work. Discussing political organization after the revolution, the author suggests a \\"Spanish America Divided in Two Grand Departments, North and South, or Septentrional and Meridional.\\" Bowman bases this attribution on a moderation uncommon for Mier, and the use of statistics Mier would not have known. Torres' motive for publishing it under Mier's name would have been to avoid controversy and thus protect his influence with Adams. During this period Torres also became friends with Richard W. Meade, a Philadelphia merchant who had in 1820 returned from imprisonment in Spain. He had a claim against the Spanish government that the Adams‚ÄìOn√≠s Treaty required him to collect from the U.S. government instead. Meade was a pewholder of St. Mary's Church, like Torres. Through the diplomat, Mier and Meade began working together in a controversy surrounding the parish priest, William Hogan, who had been excommunicated. Torres did not get publicly involved in the battle of pamphlets; Mier left Philadelphia for Mexico in September 1821, traveling with a Colombian passport Torres had issued him.; for more on this controversy see . =Diplomatic recognition= Cundinamarca (former New Granada) highlighted On the same day the U.S. Senate voted to ratify the Adams‚ÄìOn√≠s Treaty, February19, 1821, Torres met with Adams. The next day he formally requested the recognition of Colombia \\"as a free and independent nation, a sister republic\\". He expected that first the United States would take possession of the new territory, while in the meantime Colombia gained increasing military control over its own, and that recognition would soon follow. Torres suffered a three-month illness in late 1821 but on November30 wrote to Adams reporting the latest developments in Colombia. He glorified its achievement of near-total military victory, the extent of its population and territory, and its potential for commerce: The purpose of these boasts was to underscore the importance of the U.S. being the first to recognize its independence, to which Torres added warnings about the unstable politics of Mexico and Peru. The letter received significant publicity because of its extensive information and ambitious statement of Colombia's importance. President Monroe noted the success of Colombia and the other former colonies in his December3 message to Congress, a signal that recognition was imminent. Torres wrote letters to Adams on December30 and January2 reporting Colombia's new constitution, a sign the republic was stable. He hoped to go to Washington to state the case for recognition in person, but was prevented by illness and poverty. The House of Representatives asked the administration on January30 to report on the state of South America. Colombia's de facto independence as a republic, and the conclusion of Adams' treaty with Spain, encouraged the hesitant administration that the time was ripe for recognition. During this same period, the Colombian government was starting to see the prospect of recognition as hopeless. Torres' health declined intermittently over the winter; his weakening disposition was attributed to asthma and severe overwork. \\"If I could move to a good climate where there were no books, paper, or pen and where I could speak of politics in a word, ... with my little garden and a horse to carry me about, perhaps I could convalesce\\", he wrote to Mier. But in March, Monroe reported to the House that the Spanish American governments had \\"a claim to recognition by other powers which ought not to be resisted.\\" The formerly reluctant Adams dismissed a protest by Spanish minister Joaqu√≠n de Anduaga by calling the recognition \\"the mere acknowledgment of existing facts\\". By May4, the House and Senate had sent Monroe resolutions in support of recognition and an appropriation to put this into effect; this news was greatly celebrated in Colombia. Pedro Jos√© Gual, now the Colombian secretary of state and foreign relations, wrote to Bol√≠var that Torres deserved sole credit for the achievement. The question remained when to send ministers and whom to recognize first. At this time, Torres was the only authorized agent in the United States for any of the Patriot governments. It was Adams' suggestion that Torres should be received as charg√© d'affaires immediately, with the United States reciprocating after other diplomats arrived; Monroe agreed to thus formalize his existing relationship with Torres. The charg√© was invited on May23 but delayed by his poor health. Nevertheless, he insisted on traveling to Washington. At 1p.m. on June19, Torres was received at the White House by Adams and Monroe. The weakened Torres told them of the importance of recognition to Colombia, and wept when the President said how satisfied he was for Torres to be received as its first representative. Indeed, he was the first representative from any Spanish American government. On leaving the short meeting, Torres gave Adams a print of the Colombian constitution. Before Torres departed Washington, Adams visited him on June21; he promised Adams to work for equal tariffs on American and European goods in Colombia, and predicted would be sent to the U.S. as permanent diplomat. Adams published a satisfied announcement in the National Intelligencer. Death In rapidly declining health, Torres returned to Hamiltonville, now in West Philadelphia, where that spring he had purchased a new home. Duane was with him when he died there at 2p.m. on July15, 1822, at age59. On July17, the funeral procession began from Meade's house, which was joined by Commodore Daniels of the Colombian navy and prominent citizens. The procession went to St.Mary's, where the requiem mass was held by Father Hogan and Torres was buried with military honors. Ships in the harbor held their flags at half-mast. This highly unusual display of honor was not only because Torres was well-liked, but also because he was the first foreign diplomat to die in the United States. An obituary named him \\"the Franklin of South America\\".New York Evening Post, \\"The Franklin of South America\\", 1822, Historical Society of Pennsylvania, Simon Gratz collection. For analysis of this comparison see ; Duane and Meade were the executors of his estate. Not yet aware of his death, the Colombian government appointed him consul-general and (as he had predicted) sent Salazar as envoy to succeed him. Legacy Colombian minister Enrique Olaya and his wife reveal the plaque honoring Torres. Sources for Torres' life include his voluminous correspondence,Much of it preserved in Colombian archives, see . his published writing, newspaper articles, and Adams and Duane's memoirs. His long exile from Colombia has tended to obscure him in diplomatic history compared to his contemporaries; indeed his grave site was forgotten until rediscovered by historian Charles Lyon Chandler in 1924. R. Dana Skinner called him \\"the first panamericanist\\" that year. Cited in . During the U.S. Sesquicentennial Exposition in 1926, a plaque was placed at St. Mary's that honors him as \\"the first Latin American diplomatic representative in the United States of America.\\" It was a gift \\"from the government of Colombia and Philadelphian descendants of his friends\\", including Duane's great-great- grandson. The ceremony was attended by Colombian minister Enrique Olaya, who held him up as a model for cooperation of the peoples of the New World. Responding to an accusation by Spanish writer J. E. Casariego that Torres was a traitor to his native Spain, Nicol√°s Garc√≠a Samudio in 1941 called him a patriot, even the originator of the Monroe Doctrine, also citing the early argument by .‚Äîthough that specific claim has been met skeptically. A 1946 article suggested Torres had not been given a large enough place in Colombian diplomatic histories, and likewise praised him as a \\"precursor of pan- Americanism\\". In the United States, Torres is given modest attention in general diplomatic histories,E.g., ; ; . but his importance is promoted by historians of Spanish American agents. In the judgment of Jos√© de On√≠s, Torres was \\"the most successful of all the Spanish American agents\\". Charles H. Bowman Jr. wrote a master's thesis and a series of articles about Torres in the 1960s and 1970s. To celebrate the 150th anniversary of U.S.‚ÄìLatin American relations in 1972, the Permanent Council of the Organization of American States held a session in Philadelphia because it was the home of Manuel Torres. However, Emily Garc√≠a documented that in 2016 Torres was obscure even to the archivists of St. Mary's, where the plaque still hangs. That he is mostly unknown today, despite being celebrated in his time and with the plaque, is for her illustrative that \\"Latinos inhabit a paradoxical position in the larger U.S. national imaginary.\\" Her book chapter analyzes him as the embodiment of a culture bridge that existed between Philadelphia and Spanish America: while he helped spread U.S. ideals to the south, he also brought Spanish influences to the north. This dual nature is characteristic of Torres' life and thinking. Works * English translation 1800.

Developed between 1866 and 1937, it consists of ten interconnected brick buildings that are the surviving elements of a major clock-making business that operated here until 1956. The property was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2017. Description and history The former New Haven Clock Company factory is located in New Haven's industrial Wooster Square area, east of downtown. It is set on just under of land bounded by Hamilton Street, St. John Street, and Wallace Street on the west, south, and east sides. Its ten buildings are organized in a C shape, with the open side facing Wallace Street to the east. The southern part of the C is a single large building, where final assembly of the company's clocks took place, while the other buildings housed other elements of the clock-making process. Most of the buildings are three or four stories in height, with brick construction typical of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Common features include segmented-arch window openings and low- pitch gabled roofs. The New Haven Clock Company had its origins in the clock manufactory of Chauncey Jerome, an important figure in the early 19th-century development of the clock industry in Connecticut. Jerome's principal factory was in Bristol, and he opened a case manufacturing plant on this site in 1844. His nephew, Hiram Camp, organized the New Haven Clock Company in 1853, to produce components for Jerome. Jerome's business collapsed in 1856, and Camp purchased its assets with the help of other investors. New Haven Clock was merged into the American Clock Company in 1859, but continued to operated under its own name. The plant was devastated by a major fire in 1866, but quickly rebuilt; the oldest surviving elements of the complex date to this reconstruction. In the early 20th-century, the company flourished under the management of Walter Camp, and was one of the largest clockmakers in the world, and occupied 28 buildings. The company produced timing fuses and relays for mines during World War II, and resumed clock production after the war ended. It suffered financial reverses, mainly due to increasing foreign competition, and closed in 1956. Its major facility on the west side of Hamilton Street was demolished in the 1960s.

He began his career as a Jesuit missionary in the Western United States, where he worked with Native American tribes, and went on to establish the Saint Raphael Society for the Protection of Italian Immigrants and Our Lady of Pompeii Church in New York City. He led a group of Italians to Sunnyside Plantation in Arkansas in the hopes of establishing an immigrant colony and later founded the city of Tontitown with them. For his work on immigration, he was lauded by Pope Pius X and the Queen Mother Margherita.  Early life  Pietro Bandini was born on March 31, 1852, in Forl√¨, a comune of the Emilia-Romagna region of the Kingdom of Italy to an upper-class family. He had two older brothers, one of whom became a Jesuit priest. He entered the Jesuit novitiate in Monaco in 1869 and remained there, studying philosophy, until 1871. In September 1874, as part of his priestly formation, he began his regency at the Jesuit seminary in Aix en Provence, France, where he studied theology. On September 30, 1877, Bandini was ordained a priest in Bertinoro, Italy, and went on the found a school there.  Missionary work  In 1882, Bandini was sent to the Montana Territory of the United States to work in the Jesuits' Rocky Mountain mission. He was stationed as a missionary in the Sacred Hearts of Jesus and Mary Church in Helena, Montana, where he learned English and various Native American languages. The following year, he was sent to St. Ignatius Mission in St. Ignatius, Montana; there, he built a church and school and preached the faith in Crow and Kootenai villages. Eventually, he established a mission to the Cheyenne Indians. = New York City = In March 1889, he returned to Italy and was appointed the vice rector of St. Thomas Aquinas College in Cuneo. One year later, Bandini returned to the United States. In 1890, in New York City, Bandini established the Saint Raphael Society for the Protection of Italian Immigrants. The purpose of this society was to care for Italian immigrants to the United States who were subject to usury and labor exploitation. Through the society, Bandini assisted them in a much broader range of matters, such as finding work and housing. He also assisted 20,000 Italians to prepare for their American citizenship examinations by holding instructional classes. In addition to aiding them with their worldly needs, Bandini also tended to the immigrants' spiritual needs in New York by establishing a chapel that he named after Our Lady of Pompeii. This chapel served the Italians in Greenwich Village in Manhattan and was housed in a building at 113 Waverly Place that Bandini purchased. Eventually, this chapel became Our Lady of Pompeii Church, of which Bandini was pastor from 1892 to 1896. = Arkansas colony = Bandini theorized that Italian immigrants would prosper if located in a colony whose agricultural environment was similar to that they were used to in Italy. Therefore, in December 1896, his Jesuit superior permitted him to relocate with a group of Italian immigrants to Sunnyside Plantation in Chicot County, Arkansas, whose owner, Austin Corbin, was seeking laborers. Bandini's first wave of Italians arrived in the port of New Orleans on November 26, 1895, and traveled to Sunnyside Plantation. Bandini followed them in January 1897. Immediately, his project met problems, as more than 125 people out of the 100 families that moved to Sunnyside died of malaria due to unsanitary conditions, unsafe drinking water, and a mosquito-favorable climate. The living conditions of the Italians continued to deteriorate when the plantation came under new ownership in June 1896, forcing the few families that could afford to move back to Italy to do so. Recognizing the squalor of the plantation, Bandini purchased of land in northwest Arkansas, where forty families from Sunnyside had already moved. He believed this land, due to its elevation and workable soil, was sufficiently similar to the Italian climate the immigrants had known. He settled here with his community of Italian immigrants in 1898. This community went on to become incorporated in 1909 as Tontitown, Arkansas, which he named after the Italian explorer Henri de Tonti. Bandini was elected mayor of the city. The first winter forced the residents to live in abandoned farm buildings and survive off of meager sustenance. Bandini then established a schoolhouse and church, and divided the land into ten-acre parcels and distributed the allotments randomly. On the land, the immigrants grew their own food and cultivated grape vineyards, which became commercially prosperous; the Italian ambassador to the United States visited and spoke approvingly of the colony in 1905.  Later years  Bandini returned to Italy in 1911, where his colonization theory of immigration impressed Pope Pius X and the Queen Mother Margherita, who vowed to improve immigration conditions. For his work, Bandini was awarded a gold chalice and set of red vestments from the pope, a medal from the Italian government, and a set of white vestments from the Queen Mother Margherita. Bandini once again returned to the United States, where he died on January 2, 1917, at St. Vincent Infirmary in Little Rock, Arkansas, and was buried in St. Joseph Cemetery. A memorial to him and his nephew, Tito Bandini, was built in the cemetery.

Japanese pop culture has become famous internationally through anime and manga, but older elements of its culture such as Taoism, Buddhism, astronomy and language have been profoundly influenced by China over the course of centuries.  History  Conflicts caused by Chinese expansion in the later stages of the J≈çmon Period, circa 400 BCE, led to mass migration to Japan. The migrants primarily came from continental Asia, more specifically the Korean Peninsula and Southern China, which brought over \\"new pottery, bronze, iron and improved metalworking techniques\\", which help improve the pre-existing farming tools and weaponry. Chinese influence came mostly by sea, but also through Korea. Kentoshi route, also known as the sea route from Japan to China. The influence of Chinese culture was an indirect effect of communications by Korea, around the 1st to the 5th century A.D.. Korea had already incorporated major elements of Chinese civilization into their own culture, and from there, mediated the interchanges between China and Japan. The Han Shu written in 82 A.D. (also known as 'the book of Han' or 'History of Han') states that the Wa sent envoys and tribute to the J√πn (Chinese commandery) in northern parts of Korea. To further expand, the Wa was a confederation of minor southern and western states of Japan, with an emphasis on the state Yamato. According to the Han Shu, this was the first textual reference made to Japan, in reference to Sino-Japanese interaction. Another Chinese source that documents Chinese influence on Japanese culture is Wei Chih written in 297 A.D. (also known as History of Wei). Wei Chih states that Chinese and Japanese interactions of tribute originates back to 57 and 107 A.D. Prominent figures of authority, such as Queen Himiko, sent Japanese ambassadors to parts which belonged to the Chinese, around 189‚Äì248 A.D. This continued in the Kofun Period, as envoys continued to be transmitted from Japan into China. In 502 A.D., eleven new envoys were sent to China. This was, according to Mark Cartwright, the emergence of Yamato Japan as an international diplomatic state. In comparison to Korea, Japan controlled its intake of cultural influence from China, also known as 'cultural borrowing'. This meant that it \\"acknowledged the cultural superiority of the Chinese Middle Kingdom\\", while always holding onto its political independence. In addition to controlling the process of 'cultural borrowing', Japan also remained selective when considering which Chinese ideas and institutions they wanted to adopt.  Influence on religion  = Daoism/Taoism = Taoist Temple known as Seitenky≈´, located in Sakado, Saitama. Daoism/Taoism is a set of religious and philosophical beliefs which explores the ideas of rituals, scriptures all whilst considering the Dao/Tao. It can be traced back to the 3rd century BCE. As a product of Chinese philosophers, it made its way to Japan and has thus been significantly changed as it became in contact with the Japanese Culture. Originally, as Daoism developed in China was complex, multifaceted and a continuous recreation of new and old ideas. Its form as it became integrated into Japanese culture was introduced as a part of the ritsury≈ç state. As a result of this, through textual pieces, Daoism marketed its way gradually into Japanese Culture, though different from its original influence, which was Chinese Daoism.  Debates regarding Daoism/Taoism  There have been debates regarding which undefined elements of Daoism within \\"the Japanese religio-political landscape\\" belongs to history and traditions of China, and which are merely an aspect of Daoism itself. Author and research associate Gaynor Sekimori, argues that aspects such as cosmology, yin and yang, Wu Xing (the five phases), divination, astronomy/astrology and the Yijƒ´ng were originally a part of Chinese cultural heritage, which thus influenced Daoism. There has also been a level of uncertainty regarding Daoism/Taoism, whether it be majoritively Chinese culture or simply influenced a part of Daoism. Jonathan Smith made claims as to distinguish what is a part of Chinese heritage and that of Daoism itself, claiming there are elements which are \\"Daoist\\" and \\"Taoist-flavoured\\". Building on this, Japanese philosopher Miura Kunio distinguishes specific elements of Daoism as either belonging to the Chinese culture or as aspects transferred into the Japanese culture following the introduction of Daoism. To further expand, Kunio claimed that elements that were presented to Japan in the seventh century, such as \\"calendar-making, astronomy/astrology and divination\\" as belonging to the Chinese Culture. Elements such as immortality beliefs, Daoist scriptures and K≈çshin cult were transferred into Japan as a part of Daoism. = Buddhism = Now one of the largest world religions, Buddhism first emerged from India around 6th century BC. Buddhism has three major 'branches', which include Theravada (foundational Buddhism), Mahayana (or 'Greater Vehicle' Buddhism) and Vajrayana (Esoteric Buddhism or 'Diamond Vehicle'). Buddhism was brought over to Japan through China and Korea in the year 552. Furthermore, Buddhism was encouraged by those in power, such as Prince Shotoku. He argued that Buddhism was essential in \\"promoting Chinese ideas\\". Out of the three branches of Buddhism, it was the Mahayana which first became rooted in the Japanese culture.  Introduction of Vajrayana Buddhism and establishment of Mahayana sects  Visual painting of Saich≈ç. Another example of Chinese influence on Japanese religion is the introduction of Vajrayana Buddhism. In the beginning of the Heian Period, several Japanese monks that had studied religion in China returned, consequently establishing Vajrayana Buddhism through the creation of Buddhist sects. Specifically, two scholar monks known as Saich≈ç and K≈´kai helped create the Tendai sect and Shingon sect. The Tendai sect was created in 805 by Saich≈ç following his return from T'Ang China, and helped firmly establish Vajrayana. To further expand on this, Saich≈ç travelled to China for eleven months in 804 on the quest for the T'ien- t'ai (or Tiantai), the Chinese Buddhist School. Saich≈ç wanted to transfer the idea of the T'ien- t'ai Dharma heritage into Japan, while still keeping the authenticity of the original Chinese-based Buddhist school. In his final month in Ming-chou, Saich≈ç went to Y√ºeh-chou in order to gather further religious texts concerning esoteric Buddhism (Vajrayana); where he essentially meet the priest Shun-hsiao who informed him and gave him instructions about Vajrayana Buddhism. Following his visit to Y√ºeh-chou, Saich≈ç was able to retrieve Buddhist instruments, related to rituals, paintings of the goddesses of Vajrayana and 38 religious texts related to Mikky≈ç. In accordance to several pieces historical research \\"both inside and outside the Tendai school demonstrates that Saich≈ç encounter with Mikky≈ç in China was rather accidental\\". Furthermore, according to Japanese historian K≈çy≈´ Sonoda, Saich≈ç's original plan consisted of sending two disciples to do his research on the T'ien-t'ai, though it was changed last minute as Emperor Kanmu was able to persuade Saich≈ç to pursue and lead the journey personally. From there, Saich≈ç helped 'pave the way' for the Shingon sect to be introduced in 806 by K≈´kai. In order for both founders to benefit from the introduction of Buddhism, Saich≈ç stood behind K≈´kai and helped him get the mountain temple of Takaosan-ji northwest of Kyoto, and make it into the original Shingon School. In return, K≈´kai helped educate and train Saich≈ç and his followers Vajrayana rituals. Furthermore, K≈´kai also shared his Mikky≈ç texts which he had gotten during his final trip to Y√ºeh-chou, China.  Influence of Chinese astronomy  Professor at Doshisha University, Kazuhiko Miyajima argues that Japan was heavily influenced by Chinese astronomy and astrology. The Japanese learnt about Chinese astronomy first from the Koreans, who consequently learned it directly from the Chinese. The influence of astronomy took roots in government offices, as a direct influence of the Chinese model, which became known as \\"Onmyo no tsukasa\\". This office was in charge of specific information related to both astronomy and astrology, identical to the elements distinguished to be a part of Daoism. The four departments a part of the office includes \\"divination by celestial omens, calendar-making time-keeping and yin-yan divination\\". The responsibility of these departments is similar to the Chinese equivalent T'ai shih chu and T'ai- pu shu. In terms of cardinal direction, orientation in main streets in cities such as Naniwa no miya and Heijo Kyo was achieved by \\"learning the Chinese way of surveying\\". In addition, Japanese star maps were influenced by Chinese astronomy, as several star maps within Japan held the same Chinese star names. They were created as a direct duplication of the Chinese, though only a few still remain popular. To further elaborate, Shibukawa Harumi, known as the \\"first official astronomer of the Edo period\\", published two kinds of star maps, adapted from the traditional Chinese model which came from Korea. Some star maps which were created by Takahashi Kageyasu and Ishizaka Joken continue to take inspiration from Western ideals of Astronomy. Western astronomy essentially landed in Japan through China, through a book known as \\"T'ienching huomen\\". The book's popularity in China was short-lived due to its simplification, excessive mistakes and inaccuracy, but succeeded immensely nonetheless in Japan.  Language  = Kanji: Usage of Chinese characters in Japan = Kanji is the term for the adopted Chinese characters used in the Japanese written language. The Chinese writing system influenced the spoken Japanese language first, and thus \\"provided key vehicles for intellectual creativity\\". Its origin in Japan dates back to the Kofun Period, and its introduction is believed to be between the years 300 and 710 A.D. It is believed that the Japanese writing system came under influence by the Chinese through its written language. In the beginning, writing in Japan was primarily done by immigrant clerks who wrote in Chinese. One individual in particular known as Wani helped introduce the Chinese characters into Japan. Wani was a scholar that had arrived sometime during the late 4th century from one of the Korean kingdoms Paekche (also known as Baekje). He supposedly brought 11 volumes of Chinese writings with him to Japan. Wani remained in Japan, and helped inspire groups of scribes that later became known as the Fumi-no-obito. Literacy was rare and limited to immigrant groups and their families during the 5th and 6th century. The act of writing and learning Chinese was instigated in Japan in the early 5th century. Within the 7th century, Japanese scholars-aristocrats began to learn Chinese through reading and writing, with the purpose of doing business. The adaption of the Chinese characters was said to be challenging, but its outcome allowed Yamato Japan to establish bureaucracy. It also helped Japanese authority figures to gain control of clans and peasants. Moreover, the introduction of Chinese into the Japanese language broadened the Japanese access to educational texts on ranging subjects, such as science, religion, art and philosophy. Consequently, as Japanese students began to master Chinese they were able to travel to China and thus continue to learn about the language and culture. It has been said that the introduction of Chinese characters and learning in the 4th century A.D. highlighted a grand \\"turning point in Japanese cultural development\\".  Government  Nakatomi no Kamatari created the clan known as Fujiwara in the year 645. It was successfully in power right up until the 11th century, where the military class (or the Samurai) assumed its position. Following the Fujiwara clan, the Taika reforms were created in 646. The Taika reforms helped create a new government system influenced by the Chinese model. What this entailed was that land was purchased by the state and thus redistributed fairly to all. This land reform was gateway for \\"introducing the new tax system that was also adopted from China\\".
