Description Eucalyptus carolaniae is a sometimes-spreading tree that typically grows to a height of . It has thick, rough, fibrous, greyish brown bark at the base of the trunk grading to thin, finely furrowed bark higher up. Young plants have broadly egg-shaped to almost round leaves that are pale green on the upper surface and whitish below, long, wide. Adult leaves are the same glossy green on both sides, lance-shaped, long, wide on a petiole long. The flower buds are arranged in groups of seven on a flattened peduncle long, the individual buds sessile or on a pedicel up to long. Mature buds are oval to cylindrical, long and wide with a conical operculum long. Flowering occurs in summer and the flowers are white. The fruit is a woody cup-shaped, conical or cylindrical capsule, long and wide with the valves below the rim. Taxonomy and naming Eucalyptus carolaniae was first formally described in 2012 by Kevin James Rule from a specimen collected near Mount Martha and the description was published in the journal Muelleria'. The specific epithet (carolaniae) honours Pat Carolan who brought the species to the attention of the author, Rule.

Notably, memetic computing offers a much more broader scope, perpetuating the idea of memes into concepts that pave way towards simultaneous problem learning and optimization approach.  Methods  There are two different methods that describe the history and rise of memetics in computing. These are Human crafted memes and Machine crafted memes.  Human Crafted Memes  One of the most widely recognised instantiations of the memetic computing paradigm are the first-generation memetic algorithms (MAs). In particular, MAs are referred to as hybrid algorithms, prescribing a marriage between a population-based global search coupled with one or more local search schemes (interpreted as computational manifestations of memes) such as heuristic solution refinements, gradient descent procedures, etc. The specific choice of local search heuristics are handcrafted (manually specified) by a domain expert and often require a reasonably deep understanding of the problem at hand. The second generation MAs focus on adaptive data driven selection and integration of memes from a manually specified catalogue of multi-memes (a pool of memes)Krasnogor, N., Blackburne, B.

Machine crafting Memes  It is only recently that the concept of memes are set free from the narrow scope of merely hand-crafted local search heuristics, paving the path towards fully automated extraction, dispersal and exploitation of knowledge memes. In this era of data-democratization with access to modern computing platforms, emerges an unmanned multi-meme setting; one in which memes, capturing diverse forms of higher-order problem-solving knowledge, are uncovered by machines, and are thereafter made available for reuse across various problems. As such, making it possible for advanced optimizers to automatically harness the transmitted memes and ochestrate custom search behaviors on the fly without human intervention. Applications The concept of memes have been exploited in various research fields, for example, robotics engineering, multi-agent systems, robotics, optimizationFeng, L., Ong, Y. S., Lim, M.

In 1965, the Danish Women's Council (DKN) appointed her to serve on the country's delegation to the United Nations. On her return to Denmark in 1967, she chaired the DKN until 1972. She later became a member of the Danish Commission to UNESCO. Representing the Social Liberal Party, she was a member of the Folketing from 1971 to 1977. During this period, she represented Denmark at the European Council, the European Parliament and the United Nations General Assembly. Biography Born in the Frederiksberg district of Copenhagen on 22 October 1915, Clara Edele Bengta Kruchow was the daughter of the builder Hans Philip Edliot Langberg (1880‚Äì1927) and Kamma Emilie Frederikke Hansen (1885‚Äì1956). In 1943, she married Harry Kruchow (1907‚Äì1967), an academic. The couple had two children: Chresten (1946) and Lene (1950) who died from meningitis when she was one. Kruchow was brought up in a well-to-do bourgeois home together with her two younger brothers, Harald, an art historian, and Gunnar, an army officer. After matriculating from the Frederiksberg School Statens Kursus til Studentereksamen in 1936, she went on to study history, geography and French at the University of Copenhagen, graduating in 1944. On graduating, she taught at Lygby Statsskole. From 1949 to 1961, she was a board member of the History Teachers Union [Historiel√¶rerforening) and served on the board of the High School Teachers Union (Gymnasieskolernes L√¶rerforening) from 1953 to 1961. At a time when it was unusual for women to head Danish high schools, she was appointed headmistress of Sortedam Gymnasium in 1960. In parallel, she developed an interest in politics, especially international aspects. In 1965, on a proposal from the DKN, she became a member of the Danish delegation to the United Nations. On her return to Denmark in 1967, she was elected chair of the DKN, serving until 1972. She also became a member of Denmark's UNESCO commission. From 1970 to 1976, Kruchow represented the Social Liberals in S√∏ller√∏d Municipality and from 1971 to 1977 served as a member of the Folketing. She was active in international affairs, representing Denmark at meetings of the European Council and the European Parliament. She was a candidate for the European Parliament in 1979 but was not elected. In politics, Edele Kruchow was recognized for her diplomatic approach but also fought hard to have her views supported. She died on 4 September 1989 in S√∏ller√∏d.

The Langholm Sevens was the last of the Border Sevens tournaments to be instated in 1908. Held around the end of every April, the tournament is part of the Kings of the Sevens competition. 2019's Langholm Sevens took place on 27 April. Sports Day Langholm first introduced a Sports Day - as it was originally called - on 16 October 1886; and rugby union seven a sides were played then. Two local teams met; from the firms of James Scott and Sons of Waverley Mills and Hotson the Builders. James Scott and Sons won the match. However it wasn't until 1908 that Langholm RFC decided that they should hold an annual Sports Day and thus the Sevens tournament today dates from then. Eight teams from the Borders were invited to play on 1 May 1908. Scott Cup The winner of the Langholm Sevens receives the Scott Cup. The Scott Cup was first presented to the winners in 1930. It was presented by Tom Scott; the first Langholm RFC player to be capped internationally by Scotland (in 1896), and the first Border man to be president of the Scottish Rugby Union (from 1914-1920). Longest match in Sevens history The final of the 1920 Langholm Sevens is understood to be the longest match in Sevens history. Jed-Forest played Edinburgh Wanderers in that match. The teams played two halves of ten minutes each - that ended without a score for either side. After this they agreed to play another two halves of ten minutes each to try and resolve a winner. This also ended without a score. Finally the teams agreed to play to a 'golden try' rule; with the first try scored ending the match and so determine a winner. After another 5 minutes the deadlock was finally broken when the Jed-Forest fly-half Willie Scott touched down for a try. The final lasted a whopping 45 minutes in total. Invited Sides Various sides have been invited to play in the Langholm Sevens tournament throughout the years. The Barbarians entered in a side in 1972, reaching the final. The Scotland 7s side was invited in 2000. Loughborough Colleges reached the final in 1995, losing out to Glasgow High Kelvinside. Aspatria reached the final in 1990.

Etymology According to legend, the huge ice-carved hollow of the Poisoned Glen got its name when the ancient one-eyed giant king of Tory, Balor, was killed here by his exiled grandson, Lughaidh, whereupon the poison from his eye split the rock and poisoned the glen. The less interesting truth, however, lies in a cartographic gaffe. Locals were inspired to name it An Gleann Neamhe (The Heavenly Glen), but when an English cartographer mapped the area, he carelessly marked it An Gleann Neimhe ‚Äì The Poisoned Glen. Arts and culture A number of musicians associated with the area have been inspired by the location.

They went into the halfway stage in second place, six points clear of Gulf Komara in third. Their form began to stutter into the second half of the regular season, starting with a 3‚Äì0 defeat against a much-improved Eastern Stars. More dropped points followed, with a draw against Southern Strikers and a damaging defeat against playoff rivals FC Bougainville saw their playoff cushion cut to three points with three matches remaining. Their form continued to trail off, but the side was still able to qualify with a win on the final day against 7th- placed Star Mountain.

He completed a degree in history from the University of Southern Mississippi and furthered his studies in the United Kingdom at University College London. Dortch was invited to apply for a position as curator of the archaeological department of the Western Australian Museum by Ian Crawford, newly appointed to the museum's anthropology department. After settling in Western Australia, he joined the palaeontologist Duncan Merrilees in beginning a study of the site at Devils Lair, an important fossil site located in Southwest Australia. Many of the papers to which he contributed concern this site and its evidence of early mammalian fauna. In the early 1970s he was involved in research in the Kimberleys. He was also interested in the altered coast, shoreline and lakes of the south west where he investigated submerged sites. A significant site was that of Lake Jasper, the first submerged Aboriginal site to be found in Australia.

Borromeo, also known as Borromeo Lou, was a Filipino jazz musician and entertainer. Known as the \\"King of Jazz\\" in the Philippines, Borromeo popularized the music genre of jazz in the Philippines. He is also noted for popularizing bodabil, a Filipinized variation of the Western performance of vaudeville. Borromeo reportedly coined the term himself from the Western counterpart of the art form, initially pronouncing bodabil as \\"vod-a-vil\\". Biography Borromeo is a native of Cebu coming from an affluent family. He first became involved in music in Leyte, where he had his early training in music and also went to the United States where he continued to pursue his studies in piano. In 1915, as an enthusiast in the performance arts, Borromeo went to attend the Pan-Pacific International Exposition in San Francisco to see stage shows and other performances. In one show, he was encourage by his fellow Filipinos to demonstrate his skills in playing the piano at the Dutch Pavilion. This led to him building a reputation as a musician. The jazz pianist later secured a deal to perform at the Orpheum Circuit, an American theatre chain which staged live shows and featured films. For three years, he performed at Orpheum theaters under the stage name Borromeo Luo in various parts of the United States such as Chicago, New York, Portland, San Francisco, and Seattle often with singers and dancers. He then became part of the D‚Äôavigneau's Celestials with Chinese Americans, Shun Tok Sethe and Men Toy. The trio performed jazz music in ethnic Chinese costume and was noted for their \\"oriental syncopation\\". In 1921, he returned the Philippines to perform at the Manila Carnival and formed a classical jazz band. The genre was received well by the local entertainment industry which lead to the development of a performance art which would later be known as bodabil. Borromeo also featured in the 1922 Manila Carnival where his own entertainment troupe, Borromeo Lou & Co., Ltd. which featured himself, acrobats, magicians, and other performers and musicians, featured in their own revue Borromeo Follies upon request of the fair committee. After the carnival, the group went on to perform as the Borromeo Lou's Stadium Vod-a-Vil at the Olympic Stadium in Manila. Other similar groups were established by the mid-1920s. Borromeo also did performances in the provinces outside Manila. Bodabil remained prevalent throughout the rest of the American colonial period in the Philippines. Not much is known about Borromeo's later life and his death since his death certificate in Cebu was lost during World War II. His children settled in the United States.

The dish can also be made with pork or shrimp and other vegetables. The dish is characteristically savory and slightly bitter due to the ingredients used. It is a type of ginataan. Description The basic ingredients of ginataang ampalaya is bitter melon (ampalaya), tinapa (smoked fish), coconut milk, onions, garlic, salt, pepper, and bagoong alamang (shrimp paste, can be substituted with fish sauce or MSG). Pork or shrimp can also be added, along with other vegetables like moringa leaves (malunggay), tomatoes, and eggplants, among others. The dish can also be spiced with ginger as well as siling haba or labuyo peppers. A thickening agent like cornstarch or okra may also be added. Ginataang ampalaya is prepared by first slicing the bitter melon lengthwise and removing the pulp. To minimize the bitterness of the bitter melon, the rind is then soaked in brine and slightly squeezed until it becomes tender. It is rinsed then soaked again in water. It is rinsed for the second time and then sliced into small pieces. Some recipes skip the rinsing steps if more bitterness is desired. The tinapa is shredded into flakes. The head of the fish is set aside and pounded with hot water before being filtered. The extract is saved for later. The onions and garlic are saut√©ed in oil, along with the shrimp or pork if they are added. Water is added along with the tinapa flakes and the other vegetables and spices and allowed to boil. Once boiling, the bitter melon is added. Once the bitter melon is tender, the heat is reduced and the coconut milk and the liquid from the crushed tinapa is added. It is allowed to cook until the bitter melon absorbs the coconut milk broth. It is served over white rice. In some versions, thin coconut milk is added first in place of water, followed by coconut cream. Variations Ginataang ampalaya can be cooked with calabaza and other vegetables, in which case it becomes the more general dish ginataang gulay (\\"vegetables in coconut milk\\").

People use it also as a tree (i.e. classification) of the concepts/meanings of the Arabic terms. It is a formal representation of the concepts that the Arabic terms convey, and its content is ontologically well-founded, and benchmarked to scientific advances and rigorous knowledge sources rather than to speakers‚Äô na√Øve beliefs as wordnets typically do . The Ontology tree can be explored online.  Ontology Structure  The ontology structure (i.e., data model) is similar to Wordnet structure. Each concept in the ontology is given a unique concept identifier (URI), informally described by a gloss, and lexicalized by one or more of synonymous lemma terms. Each term-concept pair is called a sense, and is given a SenseID. A set of senses is called synset. Concepts and senses are described by further attributes such as era and area - to specify when and where it is used, lexicalization type, example sentence, example instances, ontological analysis, and others. Semantic relations (e.g., SubTypeOf, PartOf, and others) are defined between concepts. Some important individuals are included in the ontology, such as individual countries and seas. These individuals are given separate IndividualIDs and linked with their concepts through the InstanceOf relation.  Mappings to other resources  Concepts in the Arabic Ontology are mapped to synsets in Wordnet, as well as to BFO and DOLCE. Terms used in the Arabic Ontology are mapped to lemmas in the LDC's SAMA database.  Arabic Ontology versus Arabic WordNet  The Arabic Ontology can be seen as a next generation of WordNet - or as an ontologically-clean Arabic WordNet. It follows the same structure (i.e., data model) as wordnet, and it is fully mapped to Wordnet. However, there are critical foundational differences between them: # The ontology is benchmarked on state-of-art scientific discoveries, while WordNet is benchmarked on native-speakers‚Äô na√Øve knowledge; # The ontology is governed by scientifically and philosophically well-established top levels; # Unlike WordNet, all concepts in the ontology are formal, i.e., a concept is a set of individuals (i.e., a class), thus concepts like (horizon) are not allowed in the ontology; and # Glosses in the ontology are strictly formulated, and focus on the distinguishing characteristics, which is not the case in WordNet.  Applications  The Arabic Ontology can be used in many application domains; such as: # Information retrieval, to enrich queries (e.g., in search engines) and improve the quality of the results, i.e. meaningful search rather than string-matching search; # Machine translation and word-sense disambiguation, by finding the exact mapping of concepts across languages, especially that the Arabic ontology is also mapped to the WordNet; # Data Integration and interoperability in which the Arabic ontology can be used as a semantic reference to link databases and information systems; # Semantic Web and Web 3.0, by using the Arabic ontology as a semantic reference to disambiguate the meanings used in websites; among many other applications.  URLs Design The URLs in the Arabic Ontology are designed according to the W3C's Best Practices for Publishing Linked Data, as described in the following URL schemes. This allows one to also explore the whole database like exploring a graph: # Ontology Concept: Each concept in the Arabic Ontology has a ConceptID and can be accessed using: https ://{domain}/concept/{ConceptID  Term}. In case of a term, the set of concepts that this term lexicalizes are all retrieved. In case of a ConceptID, the concept and its direct subtypes are retrieved, e.g. https://ontology.birzeit.edu/concept/293198 # Semantic relations: Relationships between concepts can be accessed using these schemes: (i) the URL: https :// {domain}/concept/{RelationName}/{ConceptID} allows retrieval of relationships among ontology concepts. (ii) the URL: https ://{domain}/lexicalconcept/{RelationName}/{lexicalConceptID} allows retrieval of relations between lexical concepts. For example, https://ontology.birzeit.edu/concept/instances/293121 retrieves the instances of the concept 293121. The relations that are currently used in our database are: {subtypes, type, instances, parts, related, similar, equivalent}.

A black African, Majola played cricket during the apartheid-era in South Africa. Early in his playing career, he was given opportunities by the South African African Cricket Board (SAACB) to play alongside white players in exhibition matches, and to play overseas in England. He soon rejected further offers from the SAACB, feeling that the matches were token gestures, and that they were using black players as tools to overturn the sporting boycott of apartheid South Africa, and enable the national team, consisting solely of white players, to be re-admitted into international cricket. This decision meant that Majola played almost all of his cricket in the Howa Bowl between 1973 and 1991, a non-racial tournament organised by the South African Cricket Board of Control (SACBOC), who supported the boycott. Matches were typically played on matting wickets in poor conditions; they were not considered to be of first-class status at the time, but were subsequently added to the records. Majola was one of the leading players in the Howa Bowl; he played in more matches than any other player, scored the second-most runs, and took the fifth-most wickets. Although he described himself as a cricketer, not a politician, he continued to campaign against the tokenism of black cricketers, and lobbied against the rebel tours of South Africa. Both apartheid and the sporting boycott formally ended in 1991, and the same year, Majola joined the United Cricket Board upon its foundation. As the director of amateur cricket, he was responsible for setting up a national development programme, and sought to create pathways for black Africans to be able to play cricket at every level of the game. He died of colon cancer, aged 47, in 2000. Early life Khaya Majola was born on 17 May 1953 in the New Brighton township in Port Elizabeth, South Africa, the eldest of five children of Eric and Milase Majola. His family were black Africans in apartheid South Africa; his father was of Zulu descent, while his mother had mixed heritage; Scottish and Sotho. Both his parents worked as teachers, and were heavily involved in sports; Eric played for the national African team in rugby and cricket, and they were strong believers in the community and character-forming benefits of sport for their children. Milase recalled Khaya playing cricket with his father as a toddler; \\"Khaya would walk out the front door with this bat that was bigger than him.\\" Although Khaya's brothers played a variety of sports, particularly association football, Khaya's father kept him focused on cricket. He was viewed as the most talented of the Majola children, and the family would sometimes rise at 5am to bowl at Khaya. As a pre-teen, Khaya occasionally played for his father's New Brighton Cricket Club when they were short of players. Majola first attended Jarvis Gqamlana Lower, and then Johnson Marwanqa Higher primary schools; neither had significant sport schemes, and Majola continued to primarily develop his cricketing ability at home with his family. By the age of 11, he was already described by the Evening Post as \\"a star in Port Elizabeth\\"; by his teenage years his performances were noteworthy more weeks than not. He attended Cowan High School, where they played an inter-school cricket schedule against five other schools. Khaya recalled that during his time at Cowan, most weeks he was \\"scoring a fifty or taking wickets,\\" playing for both school and club. Despite his talent and success, Khaya developed a dislike for the game, partly due to the strictness of his father with regards to his development. Despite his antipathy towards cricket, Majola continued to thrive and took part in the John Passmore schools week, for black Africans, in 1971. Majola represented Eastern Province, who won the tournament, but he reflected on the competition as being of a poor standard, saying that \\"some of the guys couldn't even play the game.\\" This view was mirrored by Passmore, who admitted that some of the players \\"had no idea about cricket.\\" Majola was subsequently selected for the South African Schools XI. He was once again part of the victorious team at the Passmore tournament in 1972, and was the only batsman to score two centuries. Cricketer in apartheid South Africa =Opportunities due to multinationalism= In late 1973, Majola was chosen to play for the South Africa African XI against Derrick Robins touring side, which included England Test players. The match was an exhibition, and part of the South African government's policy of multinationalism, in which black and white sportspeople could compete against each other, representing their own 'nation'. Although the match was given \\"big-billing in the media\\", it resulted in a easy victory for the touring side, in a single-innings match. Majola took two wickets, and scored seven runs in the match, in which he was selected as his side's primary all-rounder. In later life, Majola described the game as \\"clearly a show for the government and the white cricket board.\\" Nevertheless, Majola was praised in the press, and was invited by Robins to return to England with him to appear for his side during the English summer. Before he left for England, Majola made two appearances in what became known as the Howa Bowl. These matches have retrospectively been granted first-class cricket status, and so officially, he made his first-class debut for Eastern Province against Natal in February 1974. He scored three runs in the first innings and none in the second, and took two wickets in the second innings, after not bowling in the first. He left for England in mid-1974, his departure heralded by the South African African Cricket Board (SAACB) as \\"the first African to play overseas.\\" Majola spent three weeks in England, and played matches against a variety of sides, including the English counties' second elevens and both Cambridge and Oxford University cricket clubs. =Rejection of tokenism= When he returned from England, Majola rejected further opportunities offered to him by the SAACB, including playing in the \\"Double-Wicket Competition\\", a gimmick which featured both black and white players, and was marketed as the return of \\"international cricket\\". According to the sports journalist Chris Barron, Majola believed that black players were \\"being used as stooges to boost the chances of white South Africans playing international cricket again\\". Although the black players were allowed to play alongside and against white players in games promoted by the SAACB, the Group Areas Act still heavily restricted their lives off the field, and they often were not served drinks at the cricket clubs the matches were played at. Instead, Majola backed the South African Cricket Board of Control (SACBOC) who supported the sporting boycott of apartheid South Africa, and championed non-racial policies. The move from SAACB to SACBOC prevented Majola from potentially achieving international recognition; as did his decision to remain in South Africa. Basil D'Oliveira, a Cape Coloured South African who had emigrated to England in the 1960s and played over forty times for England in international cricket, suggested that if Majola had moved to England, he could have become a \\"superstar\\". Howa Bowl matches were typically played on poor pitches featuring matting wickets, which were not conducive to batting. Cricket administrators sought to justify this to an extent by suggesting that non-white Africans were not interested in cricket. Majola played in more Howa Bowl matches than any other player, and representing Eastern Province, was among the top-five players by both runs scored and wickets taken. He became captain in the 1986‚Äì87 season, after twelve seasons as vice-captain. He never scored a century in the competition, but made twelve half-centuries, with a highest score of 80. He claimed 219 wickets at an average of 16.64, eleven times taking five or more wickets in an innings. Statistically, his best batting season was 1987‚Äì88, when he scored 437 runs at an average of 36.41 and scored three of his half-centuries. His made his highest score in January 1988, when he scored 80 runs in a drawn match against Natal. He was more heavily used as a bowler from 1983 onwards, under the captaincy of Jeff Frans, and achieved his best bowling performance in January 1985 when he took eight wickets for 96 in the third innings against Western Province to help his side to a five wickets victory. He was one of only three players to both score 2,000 runs and taken 200 wickets in the Howa Bowl, along with Mustapha Khan and Seraj Gabriels. =Campaigner for non- racial sport= Majola trained as a teacher at Lovedale, and later worked at his former primary school, Johnson Marwanqa in New Brighton, where he took the position previously held by his father. He taught until 1977, when he joined the local Bantu Affairs Administration Board as a recreation officer. According to the South African historian Andr√© Odendaal, these boards were \\"hated symbols of apartheid authority\\", and he suggested that working for the board seemed a contradiction to Majola's support for non-racial sport. Majola disagreed, saying that the role allowed him to organise and provide facilities for non-racial sport to continue and thrive that he would not otherwise have been able to. He was involved in every aspect of non-racial sport in the townships; in his own words, he was \\"organising practices, getting the grounds ready, coaching and picking teams to fetching players and playing.\\" Although Majola shied away from describing himself as a political activist, he continued to support, and campaign for, non-racial sport through the 1980s. In 1976, the authorities governing cricket in South Africa merged to become the South African Cricket Union (SACU) with the stated aim that cricket in South Africa would be played on an integrated basis regardless of race or colour. Although the leadership of SACBOC approved the merger, Majola, along with the majority of black cricketers opposed the move, committed to the ethos of \\"no normal sport in an abnormal society\\". This group formed the South African Cricket Board (SACB), which continued to run the Howa Bowl, supported the sporting boycott and non-sporting liberation efforts, and affiliated with the non-racial South African Council on Sport. The SACU ran outreach programmes for the townships, aimed at black cricketers, but Majola suspected that the initiative was more of the same propaganda, designed more to impress the international community ‚Äì and therefore potentially pave the way for South Africa to return to playing international Test cricket ‚Äì than to genuinely develop black cricket. He did all he could to oppose SACU's efforts, bringing him into direct conflict with Ali Bacher, one of SACU's leaders. Majola and Bacher clashed throughout the 1980s: Bacher helped to organise six rebel tours of South Africa; Majola campaigned against them, helping to organise such opposition to the 1990 tour of Mike Gatting's England side that it was cancelled. In 1989, Majola said: \\"He [Bacher] hates me now.\\" Post-apartheid administrator In February 1990, the South African government was forced to unban the African National Congress (ANC). As part of the ANC's efforts to unify South Africa, they encouraged the SACU and SACB to merge. Talks between the two organisations began in August 1990, and four months later they announced their intention to unite. During this interim period, SACB announced that Majola would work with Bacher on a \\"national development project\\", starting in February 1991. The following month, Majola played his final Howa Bowl (and first-class) match. According to Barron, in Majola's position as Director of Amateur Cricket, he gave credibility to the new United Cricket Board of South Africa's (UCB) efforts to transform South African cricket and bring more black players into the game. The programme introduced over 20,000 children to the sport each year, and Majola was proud that in the 1998‚Äì99 season, over 10% of the players in provincial cricket were black. Despite his pride, there were criticisms that transformation was taking too long, though these were assuaged somewhat in the late 1990s. Majola died of colon cancer on 28 August 2000.

Generally, chasers pitch must become soft or even liquid when heated at moderate temperatures, in order to fit the object and fill all its nooks and crannies. For many uses, it is desirable that the pitch is soft like glazing putty while it is still cool enough to be molded with the fingers. On the other hand, at room temperature it must be hard enough to hold the object. It must strongly adhere to the metal while it is cooling. There are many varieties of chasers pitch available, that differ on the nature or the ingredients, physical properties (such as fusibility and hardness), or place of origin. Names include Swedish pitch, Red (or Brown) German pitch, green chasers pitch, and black chasers pitch. Handling =Heating= A heat gun is a preferred way to heat up the pitch (and, if necessary, the metal object). A powerful hair dryer could also work. A blow torch as used by plumbers may also be used, although it creates a fire hazard since the pitch (and any vapors it may release when hot) are flammable. =Receptacles= Pitch bowls holding work pieces For repouss√© or other metalworking, the pitch is usually poured or pressed while hot into a \\"pitch tray\\" for larger pieces, or in a heavy hemispherical cast iron \\"pitch bowl\\" for smaller ones. The bowl, typically 6 to 20 cm in diameter, can be placed over a sand bag or leather ring, and tilted to whatever angle is most convenient. Its weight (3‚Äì4 kg when filled) will keep it firm enough for most jewelry work. For deep repouss√© or chasing works, the pitch is usually applied as a thick layer on top of some backing material that can accommodate larger deformations. =Cleanup= Pitch residues stuck to the object can be removed with an appropriate solvent, such as turpentine. A blow torch can also be used to burn the residues, if the object can withstand the temperature. =Recycling= Chasers pitch has indefinite shelf life and can be re-melted and re-used indefinitely. Composition Chasers pitch is usually a combination of * a \\"pitch\\" proper, that provides the basic adherence and fusibility; * a \\"filler\\", such as powdered pumice or plaster of Paris, to improve firmness; * an emollient, such as Venetian turpentine, that makes it softer. The pitch can be a form of asphalt derived from petroleum, or can be derived from resins of various trees. =Recipes= A typical recipe could be: *16 parts pitch *20 parts plaster of Paris *4 parts resin *1 part tallow The pitch is heated until molten. Plaster of Paris is added a small amount at a time. Resin and tallow are then mixed in. See also * Dopping cement, used to hold gemstones while grinding or polishing.

Formally known as The Bois d'Amour at Pont Aven, it was called The Talisman and became the starting point and icon of the group of young painters called The Nabis. It was a landmark in early Post-Impressionism, Synthetism, and Cloisonnism. It is now in the Mus√©e d'Orsay in Paris.  History  Back of the painting, with inscription by Serusier: \\"Made in October 1888 under the direction of Gauguin by P. S√©rusier at Pont-Aven.\\" In October 1888 the young painter Paul S√©rusier, age twenty-four, traveled to the artist's colony at Pont-Aven in Brittany, with a letter of introduction to Paul Gauguin. S√©rusier had completed his studies at the Lyc√©e Fontaine (now the Lyc√©e Condorcet) in Paris, where he had met other aspiring artists, including Pierre Bonnard and Maurice Denis, the future Nabis. Together they had enrolled at a private art school, the Acad√©mie Julian. With his letter to Gauguin from √âmile Bernard, he intended to make studies of nature in the picturesque countryside around Pont- Aven. S√©rusier later described his experience to Maurice Denis, who recounted it later in his own book. S√©rusier and Gauguin had walked to the Bois d'Amour, a particularly picturesque landscape of forest and rocks along the river Aven, not far from the village. There, according to S√©rusier's account to Denis, Gauguin told him: \\"How do you see these trees? They're yellow. So, put some yellow. This shadow, it's rather blue, paint it with pure ultramarine. Those red leaves? Put vermillion.\\" The result was a painting with pure and flat colors, which represented not a representation of the scene, but the visual sensations of the painter. Brice Ameille, Le Talisman de S√©rusier, in Le Talisman de Paul S√©rusier- Une proph√©tie de la couleur On the back of the canvas, S√©rusier wrote, \\"Made in October 1888 under the direction of Gauguin by P. S√©rusier at Pont-Aven.\\" He brought the painting back to Paris, and showed it to his fellow students at the Academie Julian. Many of them made fun of it, but several, particularly Maurice Denis, Pierre Bonnard, and Paul Ranson, Henri-Gabriel Ibels and Ren√©e Piot, were highly enthusiastic. His friends, the future Nabis, gave the small painting the name The Talisman, and made it the emblem of their new movement. Describing the first presentation of the painting Maurice Denis wrote in 1903, \\"Thus we were presented, for the first time, in a form that was paradoxal and unforgettable, the fertile concept of a flat surface covered with colors assembled in a certain order.\\" Denis, Maurice, The Influence of Paul Gauguin, L'Occident, Paris, October 1903 The Talisman was not in fact a finished work; it was intended a sketch for a future work, but S√©rusier decided not to modify it. The painting was placed in the studio of the oldest of the Nabi painters, Paul-√âlie Ranson, age twenty- four, at 25, boulevard du Montparnasse, which was humorously called \\"The Temple\\" by the Nabis. It was Ranson who gave the painting the name The Talisman, and he hung it on the wall during the weekly semi-serious ceremonies of the group. Brice Ameille, pg. 18-19 S√©rusier was active in the Nabis in the beginning, but in about 1895 he began to turn toward the doctrine of esotericism, and the mystical theories of Father Desiderius Lenz. He left Paris in 1895 to settle at Ch√¢teauneuf-du-Faou in Brittany. He died in 1927. The reputation of S√©rusier and the Talisman was kept alive by the efforts of Maurice Denis, the chief theorist and historian of the Nabis, He became the guardian of the painting in about 1903, and wrote continually about the importance of the artist and the work. After the death of Denis, the painting became part of the collection of the French government, and eventually of the Mus√©e d'Orsay in Paris. Pinchon, Pierre, Maurice Denis, Aux Origines du Mythe, in Le Talisman de Paul S√©rusier', pg. 36 Influence The Talisman inspired a series of paintings by the Nabis, following the same principles that Gauguin had expressed to S√©rusier. Maurice Denis cited the Talisman in his famous 1914 essay, New Theories of Modern Art and on Sacred Art: \\"Remember that a painting, before it is a horse in battle, a nude woman or a sort of anecdote, is essentially a flat surface covered with colors assembled in a certain order.\\" Brice Ameille, Le Talisman de S√©rusier, in Le Talisman de Paul S√©rusier- Une proph√©tie de la couleur Notes and citations Bibliography *Le Talisman de Paul S√©rusier- Une proph√©tie de la couleur , L'Objet d'Art Hors-S√©rie (in French) * 1888 paintings Paintings of the Mus√©e d'Orsay ","title":"The Talisman (painting)"},{"id":"60533465","text":"Fasana-e-Azad () (), sometimes spelled Fasana-i-Azad, is an Urdu novel by Ratan Nath Dhar Sarshar. It was serialized in Avadh Akhbar between 1878 and 1883 before it was published in four large volumes by the Nawal Kishore Press. The story follows a wandering character named Azad and his companion, Khoji, from the streets of late-nineteenth-century Lucknow to the battlefields of the Russo-Turkish War (1877‚Äì1878) in Constantinople and Russia. The work's status as a novel has been debated, but it is thought by most scholars to be one of the first novels (or a proto-novel) in Urdu. Sarshar conceived of writing Fasana-e-Azad after the success of the articles he contributed to Avadh Akhbar under the title \\"Zarafat\\" (\\"Wit and Humour\\"). Perennially popular, Fasana-e- Azad has been a subject of study by literary critics as the first Urdu novel and for its influence on the literary form's later development. It is noted for its colourful descriptions of Lucknow, its people, and its culture. Background Ratan Nath Dhar Sarshar (1846 or 18471903) Sarshar, a teacher in Kheri District of Uttar Pradesh, joined the Nawal Kishore Press (founded by Munshi Nawal Kishore) in Lucknow as an editor of Avadh Akhbar. He wrote a column for the magazine about Lucknow's feudal culture, which inspired him to write Fasana-e-Azad. On 8 August 1878, Sarshar was appointed editor of Avadh Akhbar. His \\"Zarafat\\" series appeared regularly after the first column was published in the 13 August 1878 issue. The column, whose title refers to writing characterized by wit and humour, was an immediate success; its popularity led Sarsharr to write Fasana-e-Azad, which included some of the articles. In one piece, published on 23 September, Sarshar explained his reasons for writing the series. He said that their intention was to use humour to allow Avadh Akhbar readers to familiarize themselves with a social culture, characterized by proper conversational style and idiomatic fluency suited to a variety of social occasions, which could be used in a variety of social gatherings. Sarshar believed that such an education would improve the country and its people; pleasure in reading humorous articles would encourage refinement and higher thought. The novel evolved as it was published. Fasana- e-Azad satirizes urban life for about its first 500 pages, usually centering on a wandering figure such as Azad or a minor character. This was in keeping with the influence of Charles Dickens's The Pickwick Papers and Miguel de Cervantes' Don Quixote on Sarshar. As the story progressed and became popular, he decided to serialize the narrative from 1878 to 1883. Characters Fasana-e-Azad main characters are: * Azadthe protagonist. He wanders around Lucknow, meets people from all classes with a variety of ideas, and attends the festivals of Eid, Shab Barart, Maharram and Basant. * Husn Araa beautiful girl, from an aristocratic family, whom Azad loves * Sihpahr AraHusn Ara's younger sister * Khojia dwarf who is Azad's companion Plot The novel is set in Lucknow and an imaginary Middle East during the late 19th century. Its theme follows the pattern of Miguel de Cervantes' Don Quixote, with Azad modeled on Don Quixote. Azad's faithful friend, Khoji, echoes Sancho Panza. Azad, with no family history, wanders around the city; he encounters all kinds of people and observes Lucknow's changing urban milieu. He has a keen eye for female beauty. Azad meets two sisters and falls in love with Husna Ara, the older sister. Although she loves him too, she sets a condition for their marriage: Azad must go to Turkey and fight with the Turks in their war with the Russians. Azad leaves for Turkey with Khoji, his sidekick, a dwarf with a fondness for opium and delusions about his handsomeness and martial prowess. They have a number of adventures in Turkey and Russia; several noblewomen fall love with Azad, who remains more-or-less true to Husn Ara. Azad, Khoji, and two female European admirers return to India in triumph. Azad marries Husna Ara, and the two European women become social workers. He becomes the father of twins and is well-known and respected, devoting a great deal of time to the propagation of new ideas, education, commerce and industry. When war breaks out against Afghanistan, Azad is asked by the government to aid the war effort. He goes to war, again proving himself a valiant soldier. Azad then returns home and lives a happy, useful life devoted to the advancement of his country. Fasana-e-Azad has a number of sub-plots, including the story of Husna Ara's sister, Sipahr Ara; her lover, prince Humayun Far; and the Shahsawar, his mysterious rival,. Publication history Fasana-e-Azad consists of four volumes, with a total of about 3,000 pages (roughly 2.25 million words). The novel has been published in a number of formats. Volume one was serialized in Avadh Akhbar from August 1878 to 5 January 1880 under the title, \\"Zarafat\\". It was published in book form in January 1881 by the Nawal Kishore Press, which also published the remaining three volumes. The first instalment of volume two appeared in the magazine on 1 July 1880, when the title Fasana-e-Azad was first used. Further instalments, sold by subscription and separately priced, were published after 30 July as monthly supplements to Avadh Akhbar. It was published in book form in July 1882. The third volume was serialized monthly from February 1882 to January 1883 and was published in book form, with an initial print run of 200 copies and a cost of three rupees, in June 1883. Although it is unknown if the final volume was serialized, it was published in book form in 1883. =Later editions= A chapter of Fasana-e-Azad, over 15 pages long, was published by Nawal Kishore Press in 1906 as \\"Range Siyar\\". A new edition of the novel was published in 1934. Saraswati Press of Banaras published an abridged 550-page Hindi edition in 1947. The character of Khoji became so popular that Muhammad Ahsan Farooqi collected excerpts about Khoji from the novel and compiled them into a book entitled Khoji, which was published in 1952 by Raja Ram Kumar Press (a successor of Nawal Kishore Press). The New Delhi-based Jamia Book Department published an abridged edition, Fasana-e-Azad (Talkhis), in 1970. Reception Fasana-e-Azad was the first serialized Urdu fiction published in an Urdu newspaper. A landmark of modern Urdu fiction, it sparked unprecedented public interest and helped Avadh Akhbar solidify its reputation as one of South Asia's first commercially viable Urdu dailies. During and after publication of the novel, Sarshar became one of the Urdu community's most popular figures. The novel is regarded as one of the first modern Urdu novels, or an immediate precursor to the novel form. According to Firoz Hissain, Fasana-e-Azad success was unprecedented in the history of Urdu literature; it was read and enjoyed by every segment of society. Since it publication, the novel serves as an encyclopedia of contemporary Lucknow culture. Reviewers praised Fasana-e-Azad for its portrayals of Lucknow's marketplaces, fairs and diverse social classes, presented with a liveliness and accuracy considered unprecedented in Urdu literature. Historian Ram Babu Saksena cites the novel's realistic depiction of Lucknow's life, the \\"faithful and vivid portrayal of life and manners of Lucknow society\\" and Sarshar's \\"brilliants humour\\" as outstanding features of Fasana-e-Azad. Saksena calls Sarshar's humour \\"full-blooded, healthy and unrestrained\\", and none of his contemporaries approach his \\"fund of humour\\". Shaista Suhrawardy Ikramullah calls Khoji Sarshar's greatest achievement and an immortal character in Urdu fiction. Saksena describes Khoji as a \\"unique character in the whole range of Urdu literature\\" and as \\"the most original and wonderful creation of humorous art\\". Wah Janaab, a television series based on Fasana-e-Azad, aired on DD National in 1984. Scholarship Study of Fasana- e-Azad began after Sarshar's death with the publication of articles by Brij Narayan Chakbast and Bishan Narayan Dar, two of his contemporaries. Scholarship has focused on its uncertain status as a novel, although Sarshar called Fasana-e-Azad a \\"novel\\" in 1879. Nearly all the scholars, including Ralph Russell and Vaqar Azim, consider it an early novel or a work introducing novelistic elements into Urdu. Criteria used by some Urdu scholars to argue that Fasana-e-Azad is not a novel per se are plot and characters. Its plot has a number of subplots and storylines, with little attention to the relationship between them and the work's overall construction. Muhammad Ahsan Farooqi attributed this to Sarshar's \\"carelessness\\": \\"Sarshar had no plan and stuffed in any story wherever he wanted and ended it whenever the mood struck.\\" According to Farooqi, the love between Azad and Husn Ara is the only thread running through the work from beginning to end. Bishan Narayan Dar wrote, \\"Fasana-e-Azad is not a proper novel, since its plot was not conceived according to any plan. It has neither beginning, nor middle, nor end; rather, it is a collection of unconnected snapshots of the society and culture in which Sarshar lived.\\" Chakbast questioned how Azad's character (which he described as a \\"uncontrollable, carefree, itinerant, and sometimes even sinful man\\") could abruptly become \\"so chaste and refined\\", finding the character's development \\"against the law of nature\\". Author Shaista Suhrawardy Ikramullah called Fasana-e-Azad plot \\"extremely poor\\": \\"The events are very loosely knit and contribute nothing towards the d√©nouement. According to Ikramullah, the characters' development is inconsistent. Notes = Citations = Sources     External links Excerpts from Fasana-e-Azad: * Saf Shikan episode (tr.

A notarial act is the only lawful means of proving those facts of which it is the recognized record, whereas on other matters it is usually inadmissible, because, being beyond the powers entrusted to the notary by law, it is non-official. In most common-law countries, multiple-page acts are bound together using a sewn or knotted ribbon (referred to as silk), the ends of which are secured by a wafer impressed with the notary's seal. This is called annexing or annexure. Act in public form The first category is known as an \\"act in public form\\" (Fr act en minute, Du minute to take, It at to conservative, Ger Underfur, and Sp act protocol), and is the preserve of notaries-at-law. Public form acts may take the form of a record of some activity that is intended or required to have penitentiary status, legal or administrative force or effect, or commercial effect. Acts in this form remain the cornerstone of civil-law notarial practice according to which they are composed as single narrative instruments written in the first-person perspective of the notary. Public-form acts include all contracts and governing instruments (e.g. conveyance, will, trust, power of attorney, gift). The components of an act in public form are: * Protocol (preamble) which sets out introductory matters, noting: **Notary's name and status **Date and venue of act **The appearance of one or more parties (referred to as \\"appearers\\") and witnesses before the notary **Any capacity the appeared appears or is acting in **How the notary verified the facts or allegations in the corpus *Corpus (operative part) which: **Recipes appear intent **Narrates facts and accomplished procedures **Sets out the material terms and operative words (voces signat√¶) of the power-of-attorney, contract, arrangement, obligation, conveyance, or other legal act embodied in the instrument **Refers to any appended material *Eschatocol (conclusion) which attests and certifies: **That the document was read over to and acknowledged by the appeared, and signed (and in some cases sealed) by the appeared in the notary's and witnesses' presence, all in due form **That the conditions of applicable local law concerning the formalities of document execution and binding nature have been met **Often the date and venue are repeated **And finish with a signature block ***Typical examples: **** Thus done and passed at the City and State aforesaid on the day and year first above written in the presence of the undersigned competent witnesses and before me, Notary, after due reading of the whole (Louisiana). **** Thus done and executed at Pretoria on the day, month, and year written in presence of the witnesses, x and y, who, together with the Appears and me, the Notary, have signed the original hereof now remaining in my protocol (South Africa). ***** Variations: Thus done and ceded (cession), thus done and granted (grant, POA), thus done and inventoried (public inventory), thus done, contracted and agreed (contract). *In the past, following an eschatocol would come further attestations which were additional notes concerning the due payment of notarial fees (including stamp duty), the acknowledgment of interlineations or corrections, the proper recording of the act, and any other post-editorial actions. Traditionally, in civil-law countries, the preliminary drafts, called \\"minutes\\" (formerly protocols; Fr minute, Du minute, It minute, Ger Urschrift, Sp escritura Matriz), are jotted in legal shorthand and record only the particulars. Their date, appeared, venue and subject are logged in a notarial register, and the minutes are retained and kept in the notary's protocol (archive) while a engrossment (Fr/Du gross, It Spedizione in form executive, Ger Ausfertigung, Sp primer testimonio), a fully extended form in longhand under seal and signature, is handed to the appeared. The minutes are used thereafter as a master copy from which exemplifications (Fr exp√©dition, It Spedizione, Sp ', Copia simple, Du authentic afschrift, mitigate, Ger beglaubigte Abschrift), i.e. engrossed fair copies, may be made. In common-law countries, notaries prepare multiple duplicate originals fully executed and sealed, as a copy would not be admissible in court. One is archived as a file copy in the notary's protocol. Act in private form The second category is known as an \\"act in private form\\" (Fr after en brevet, Du ', akte in original, It atto rilasciato in originale, Ger Urkunde in Original, Sp Acta extraprotocolar), best represented by the notarial certificate (or \\"docquet\\" in Scotland). This is generally writing that certifies the due execution in the notary's presence of a deed, contract or other writing or verifies some fact or thing of which the notary has certain knowledge. Notarial certificates are endorsed on or appended to a pre-existing document and attest to its due execution, genuine nature, and validity, or legal status and effects. As a safety precaution, the certificate may also contain information such as the number of pages, a description of the document, its title, and any other distinguishing features to prevent pages from being added or removed. If affixed, short-form certificates may also be embossed with a sealed half on the certificate and half on the rest of the page. Notarial certificates come in full forms or short forms. A full form includes preamble information like the date, venue, appear's appearance, proof of identification, and so forth, as well as the principal attestation. A short form usually only includes the venue, date, and \\"attestation clause\\". Both are then ended with a \\"testimonium clause\\". Typical parts are: *The caption which includes the venue, a large right-facing bracket or parentheses followed by \\"to wit\\" or the abbreviation ss. for Latin scilicet which means the same thing, and to the right is the title, usually about a case or matter; *The preamble (see supra); *The attestation proper, either in clause form or broken out into averments; *The testimonium clause followed by a notary's signature, either styled with a large bracket and the appear and witness signature block or with a signature block preceding and notary signature following. **Typical examples: ***In faith and testimony whereof I, the said Notary, have hereunto set and subscribed my hand and affixed my Notarial seal on this (day) day of (month) two thousand and (year) (India) ***Whereof an act being required, I, the said Notary, have granted these presents under my Notarial firm and Seal of Office to serve and avail as occasion shall or may require (India, Ireland) ***In witness of which I have subscribed my name and affixed my seal of office at (city) aforesaid this (day) of (month) Two thousand and (year) (Australia) ***In faith and testimony whereof I the said notary have subscribed my name and set and affixed my seal of office at (city) aforesaid this (day) day of (month) two thousand and (year) (England) ***In testimony whereof, I have hereunto set my Notarial form and official seal of Office (Canada) ***In witness whereof, I have hereunto set my hand and seal of office (U.S.) See also *Notary public *Civil law notary *Documentality References =Bibliography= * Legal documents Notary ","title":"Notarial act"},{"id":"60533638","text":"Susan Weintraub is an American scientist.

Biography Krebs was a vocalist at the W√ºrttembergischer Hofoper in Stuttgart, where he was also the librettist of several operas. On his name day Carl Maria von Weber composed the (lost) burlesque \\"Antonius\\" in 1808 or 1809. Today, however, he is mainly known as the author of esoteric and Masonic scripts, which he published under the pseudonym Johann Baptist Kerning. He was appointed for the spiritual status and sent to Constance to study Catholic theology. This he finished in Freiburg im Breisgau. From 1795 to 1823 he was a member of the Stuttgart Hofoper. In Stuttgart, he worked from 1823 to 1849 as a director and vocal pedagogue. Krebs tried to understand the essence of Freemasonry in a mystical way. According to him, the ultimate goal of Freemasonry is the \\"realization and revival of a prophetic power in man\\". On 12 August 1820 he was raised by the Johannis Loge in Berlin for Aries in the degree of a knight apprentice. He received this degree in Berlin, because Freemasonry had been banned in his hometown of Stuttgart. After the ban was lifted, Kerning became the founder and long-time master of the chair of the Stuttgart Johannisloge \\"Wilhelm zur rising Sonne\\".

Yoga Krebs developed a consonant-vowel-based form of yogic practice, which was published by his pupil and successor Karl Kolb in \\"The Rebirth, the Inner True Life\\" (sometimes also under the title \\"The Letter Book\\"). These exercises, which were focused in the feet on the concentrated thinking and feeling of sounds, were taken up and further developed by Karl Weinfurter. The writer Gustav Meyrink, whose \\"occult\\" novels are known, is said to have been inspired by Eckstein, who practiced the Kerning exercises for several years, but in retrospect expressed himself negatively about their value, even considered a spinal disease as a result of these exercises.Letter from Meyrink to \\"M√ºller\\" of June 20, 1917, reprinted in: Yvonne Caroutch: Gustav Meyrink Edition l'Herne, Paris 1976. pp. 215-216.

It was officially founded on May 29, 1943, and celebrated its 75th anniversary the weekend of May 26‚Äì27, 2018. The Rev. H.S. van Jaarsveld, after whom the Biermanskool Reformed Church was originally named Vanjaarsveld in honor of his pioneering work in South West Africa (SWA), helped as a custodian in services for the Reformed Churches in the north of the mandate territory. He helped found Grootfontein in 1943, as he had the Outjo Reformed Church (1930), the second oldest congregation in northern Namibia. Initially, the congregation met for services in the building of the Dutch Reformed Church in South Africa (NHK), already founded in the same town on September 4, 1937, 35 days after the first NHK church in the Southwest in Gobabis and 14 days after the second in Otjiwarongo. In Grootfontein's case, the local Dutch Reformed Church in South Africa (NGK) (founded in 1944) was the youngest of the three Afrikaner churches. The GKSA worshippers continued to use the NHK church until 1956, when the former built their own. On September 17, 1949, the young GKSA congregation petitioned the city government for their own church grounds. On May 20, 1950, the church council obtained approval. The site was located on historic grounds where the Angola-Boers of the Dorsland Trek, under the leadership of their president Diederik Prinsloo, had founded the Republic of Upingtonia (in existence from 1885 to 1886). The \\"burgers\\" of the republic were all Doppers (GKSA members). Two great sycamores, planted as gateposts in 1928, overshadowed the footpath. In 1953, the congregation began raising money, eventually earning ¬£85 in the construction fund. In 1955, the local GKSA farmers volunteered 5 percent of their herds for the project. The church branded the best of the cattle, the farmers grazed them for free, and proceeds from their sale went directly towards the building project. Ene Meyer, the architect, drew up a blueprint in 1964, which the council approved. A building committee was formed, including the Rev. E.W. Meyer, elder L.A. Grobler (convener), N. van der Walt, P. du Toit, and J.H. du Plessis. An R22,000 bid from a Mr. Harteveld in Gobabis was accepted. Karel Strydom and a Mr. Arends made the pulpit, tables, chairs, and pews of dolf wood, gathered by members along with marula tree wood and other local lumber. Members later overlaid the pews. The organ was also donated to the church. One of the elders on the building committee, Jan Harm (Boet Jannie) du Plessis (born July 28, 1921, Mombolo, Angola, and died May 14, 1984, in Walvis Bay), had a father, Lourens Marthienus du Plessis, who was born June 19, 1886, in the short-lived Upingtonia, on the church's future grounds. L.M. du Plessis withdrew to Angola, but died on May 16, 1962, in Onkoshi, near Tsumeb. The church building was dedicated on February 27‚Äì28, 1965. A member, Nelie Prinsloo, received the key and unlocked the door. Prof. W.J. Snyman observed the opening and revealed the memorial monolith. Grootfontein is one of the exceptions to the relative stability of the GKSA in Namibia in the first 15 years of the 21st century, shrinking from a membership (confirmed and baptized) of 188 at the end of 1997 to one of 54 at the end of 2014.

Known locally as the Buckie Cathedral, it was built between 1851 and 1857, soon after the emancipation of Catholics in Scotland, to provide a place of worship for the local Catholic congregation. It was designed by James Kyle, Catholic bishop of Aberdeen, and built on land donated to the diocese by Sir William Gordon, Baronet of Letterfourie. It was extended and redecorated in the early twentieth century by Charles M√©nart, and was designated a Category A listed building in 1972. It remains an active place of worship, under the governance of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Aberdeen. Description St Peter's is a large church, built in 13th century Gothic style. Its size and prominent location allow it to be seen from several miles away, and despite its status as a local parish church, it is known locally as the Buckie Cathedral. The church presents an imposing Gothic west frontage, which has been compared with St Patrick's Cathedral in Armagh. Twin squared towers flank the gabled centre with its main entrance, which is recessed within a point-headed arch beneath a four-light stained glass window with geometric tracery. The five-bay aisled nave is lit by triple lancet windows, and at the east end is a lower, rectangular chancel, incorporating a rose window, in diameter, in its gable end. =Interior= The interior of the church is richly decorated in a Gothic style. Its tall, narrow nave has arcaded aisles to either side, with thick columns supporting their pointed arches. At the west end is a corbelled gallery containing a large pipe organ, below which is an elaborate war memorial, commemorating soldiers killed in the First World War, and along the walls of the aisles are images of the Stations of the Cross in large, decorative wooden frames. The church's font, with its heavy stone base and elaborately carved wooden cover, is in a small baptistry in the south-west corner. The church's main focus is its chancel, which has ornately carved reredos of Caen stone and polished Languedoc marble, and a pulpit, altar and communion rail, all intricately designed in various kinds of marble. =Presbytery and enclosing walls= The presbytery is attached to the church at the north east corner. It is a two-storey, red sandstone house, with tooled ashlar detailing and a slate roof. The church and presbytery are surrounded by a high coped rubble wall, lowered at the west front with spearhead railings and a carriage gate. History St Peter's, Buckie, as seen from offshore between Cluny and Buckpool harbours In 1850, the Catholic bishop of Aberdeen James Kyle, eager to build a church to accommodate the growing Catholic congregation in Buckie, asked Sir William Gordon, the Baronet of Letterfourie and a prominent local Catholic, to donate land within the town on which to build a new church. An agreement was reached whereby Gordon would provide a plot of land sufficient for the church, a house for the priest and a school, and Gordon and his brother would be interred within the church upon their deaths. With the land secured, construction of the building started in 1851, according to designs drawn up by Kyle himself, with assistance from A & W Reid, an architectural firm from Elgin. The imposing west front of the building was based on the derelict Elgin Cathedral, and was intended to symbolise the respectability attained by Catholics following their recent emancipation in Scotland. The building was completed in 1857, heralded by the following announcement carried in the local Banffshire Journal: :\\"Opening of New Catholic Cathedral\\". The new Catholic Cathedral at Buckie was opened by the Rt Rev Bishop Kyle assisted by Rev Wm Clapperton who was the first missionary therein. From 1906 to 1907, the building was extended by the Belgian architect Charles M√©nart, with the addition of a chancel to the east end of the church, which preserved and reused the rose window from the original east gable. M√©nart also added a small porch to the north west of the church, the baptistry to the south west, and the Italian marble high altar and surrounding murals, which were his own design. The ornate marble war memorial at the west end of the church, installed in 1922, was designed by Cameron McDonald and carved by Nicol Bros of Buckie. In 1972, the church was designated a Category A listed building. The church's organ was installed in 2000‚Äì2001. Made by Bryceson Bros in 1875 for Fort Augustus Abbey, it was rebuilt in St Peter's by Rushwood and Dreaper following the closure of the abbey. Current usage The church remains in use as a Catholic church, operated as part of the Parishes of Buckie, Fochabers, Tynet and Presholme, under the governance of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Aberdeen.

In 2017, Bhindar tehsil, which had been a sub-tehsil of Vallabhnagar tehsil since 1959, was declared to be a separate tehsil. This restructuring reduced Vallabhnagar tehsil's area from 983 square kilometers to 383 square kilometers. Geography The area of Vallabhnagar tehsil is 539 square kilometres. The annual average rainfall in Vallabhnagar tehsil is 608 mm, with an average of 30 rainy days per year.

Plot Maude Flanders appears in a dream to Ned as a ghost. Ned cries and asks Todd if he ever dreams about his mother. Todd confesses he no longer remembers what she looks like. After watching Christmas tapes of their family in an attempt to jog his memories of Maude, Todd starts having doubts about Maude being in a better place. At church, Reverend Lovejoy invites the kids to say what they would want to say to baby Jesus if they could speak to him and Todd says he would angrily tell him thanks for nothing because his mom is dead and that he does not believe in God anymore, shocking everyone but Lisa Simpson, who gives Todd a thumbs-up. Ned is shocked to the core and reprimands his action, while Todd keeps questioning God's existence. The next morning, Todd refuses to say Amen to the prayer for the breakfast and Ned asks himself what can put fear of God back in Todd. After seeing Bart trick Homer in staying outside in his underwear, Ned asks the Simpsons to look after Todd for a while and help him rediscover his beliefs in God. This proves futile. Eventually, Todd tells Homer the reason he does not believe is because his mother is never coming back and asks Homer if he knows what he feels, and Homer remembers his mother Mona making him cry too. Homer goes to Moe's Tavern to forget but is surprisingly joined by Ned. The two get drunk before getting hit by Hans Moleman's car. They are greeted in Heaven by Ned's second wife Edna Krabappel and Maude, John the Baptist, and God. After a movie argument with Abraham Lincoln, God informs them they are not dead. They are merely in a coma with their families at their hospital beds. After seeing even Bart praying, Todd prays to God, Jesus, and Buddha to bring his dad back. Ned returns to his body. Homer is then met by Mona and finally has a chance to say goodbye to her before he too regains consciousness and the families are reunited.

She and Homer get to the honeymoon suite and find out that the marriage was a ruse and Artie's bride is a robot. Artie admits he had been trying to make a robot clone of Marge for years, but they all have flaws. Following Marge's suggestion, he uses his army of Marge droids to do humanitarian work, though they all reject his sexual advances, inexplicably sprouting wings to fly off. Meanwhile, Lisa is heckled by a man who claims that she will be prettier and more popular if she smiled more often. Marge takes her to a new dentist to get a new set of braces, as her old dentist was a rogue periodontist masquerading as an orthodontist.

Temperature and climate Current K√∂ppen climate classification types of North Carolina Around the year 2080, \\"temperatures are likely to rise above 95¬∞F approximately 20 to 40 days per year in most of the state, compared with about 10 days per year\\" in 2016. If current warming trends continue, by 2080 \\"North Carolina will likely feel like the Florida Panhandle or possibly like northern Mexico within a generation.\\" The State Climate Office predicts as of 2020 that temperatures will increase 4-10 degrees Fahrenheit by the end of the century. Coastline \\"The United States Geological Survey estimates that the lightly developed Outer Banks between Nags Head and Ocracoke could be broken up by new inlets or lost to erosion if sea level rises two feet by the year 2100.\\" Rising sea levels will threaten inland areas because storm surges will get higher as sea level rises. Global sea level rise is caused by melting land ice, and also the fact that warmer water occupies a larger volume (thermal expansion). =Hurricanes= Tropical storms and hurricanes have become more intense in recent years. While warming waters make these storms more intense, \\"scientists are not sure whether the recent intensification represents a long- term trend.\\" But it is likely that storms will tend to worsen as the climate warms. Ensemble analysis of Hurricane Florence indicated that heightened temperatures led to a more intense hurricane, with higher precipitation (~5% higher) and a wider diameter (~1.5 miles, ~1.6%). Ecosystems With rising sea levels, salt water can make its way farther upstream. The increased salinity can kill some types of trees found in swamp areas. \\"Salt water also reacts with some wetland soils, which causes the surface of the wetlands to sink below the water, adding to the loss of wetlands.\\" This has already occurred, for example, near Camden Point. Political responses to climate change Though several cities, municipalities, and school have been commended for their responses to climate change, the state as a whole has lagged behind. =State action= In 2012, in response to a study by the United States Geological Survey which predicts accelerating sea level rise, the legislature of North Carolina \\"passed a law requiring that projected rates of sea level rise be calculated on historical trends and not include accelerated rates of increase.\\" A July 2019 law revised local land-use and planning requirements. Comprehensive plans that incorporate flood risk will now be required at the local level. In 2020, the North Carolina Office of Recovery and Resiliency Planning is preparing a \\"resilience quick start guide\\" for local communities, to \\"build resilience into routine decisions such as infrastructure upgrades or zoning rulings.\\" =Local action= The city of Charlotte passed a plan to \\"emit nearly zero carbon from its buildings and vehicle fleet by 2030 and lower the per-capita carbon emissions from Charlotteans by a factor of six.\\" Two days after the plan was passed by the city council, Michael Bloomberg announced that Charlotte was the winner of the American Cities Climate Challenge. In fall of 2016, the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill unrolled the \\"Three Zeroes Initiative,\\" which is the university's commitment to reduce to zero the net usage of water, the amount of waste in landfills, and the net amount of greenhouse gas emissions. In 2016, the city of Asheville, in cooperation with the University of North Carolina at Asheville's National Environmental Modeling and Analysis Center, began work on a climate resiliency assessment, designed to \\"lessen the impacts of future extreme weather and climate change.\\" Asheville has earned the moniker the \\"Climate City\\" for its housing the headquarters of the National Centers for Environmental Information (the largest repository of environmental data in the world), the U.S. Air Force's 14th Weather Squadron (\\"which provides climate services to the defense and intelligence communities\\"), and also The Collider, a nonprofit that \\"is the first entrepreneurship and innovation center in the nation built to support startups ‚Äì across almost every sector ‚Äì that use data to help the world become more resilient to climate change.\\"  Public response Following Hurricane Florence, Elon University conducted a poll exploring public opinions on climate change. It found that 80 percent of North Carolinians though that North Carolina's coastal communities would be negatively affected by climate change in the next decade. Sixty-two percent supported consideration of climate change predictions in local planning and ordinances, 72 percent supported restriction of real-estate development in flood-prone areas, and over half agreed that hurricanes were increasing in severity.

Early years Born in Padua into a Venetian working class family, he moved to Trieste at the age of seven, where his father was employed at the dockyards ‚ÄúCantieri San Marco‚Äù whom Italy had just acquired after the Victorious war with Austria-Hungary. The family settled in the populous suburb of San Giacomo (St James) of Trieste, a neighborhood considered the red-heart of the Trieste working class, where socialists and then communists ideas thrived. The young Mario grew up listening to songs like ‚ÄúBandiera Rossa‚Äù and \\"The International\\" which were commonly sung in the local bars by the residents. When in 1922 the Fascist regime came to power, San Giacomo became one of the targets of the Fascist militiamen expeditions, aimed to punish the ‚Äúreds‚Äù. It is possible that Toffanin often witnessed confrontation between the two groups, which at the time were almost on a daily basis, in the local square or campo, the center of the neighborhood. In 1927 he was affiliated to the Italian Communist Party, which had been outlawed by the regime the previous year, to become a full member in 1933. World War 2 and partisan struggle He worked at San Marco dockyards from 1927 until 1940, when he was drafted into the Royal Italian Army. His military service lasted only three months, before beings discharged on medical grounds. Upon his discharge, and prior to the entrance of Italy in the Second World War, he went into hiding in the Kingdom of Yugoslavia, where he joined the underground Communist Organization. When the axis powers invaded Yugoslavia in 1941, the Yugoslav communist party quickly activated him to help organize the underground forces, although the Yugoslavs and the international communists, did not join the war against the axis forces until the invasion of USSR of 22 June 1941. After the axis invasion, he saw action with the partisan forces from 1941 to 1943 in Croatia, where he was captured on 20 April 1943. Nevertheless he managed to escape after four months of detention in the Zemun concentration Camp near Belgrade, along with a group of 28 partisans, just few days before being transfer to Germany. With the Italian surrender of 8 September 1943 the overall situation in the Italian eastern provinces changed. These provinces had been annexed in 1918 after the dissolution of the Austrian-Hungarian Empire, and had a multiethnic population. Although by the 1940s the Italian component was a majority in the main cities, the number of the Italian ethnic group had been increased with the arrival of many other Italians from the other parts of Italy, and by the family policy of the Fascist regime, the Slovenian and Croatian ethnic groups were still a visible minority and an overwhelming majority, in the internal villages next to the kingdom of Yugoslavia border. During the late 1920s and early 1930s the Italian security forces and Fascist militia, were actively engaged in suppressing the Slavic nationalist movements, and special laws were passed to deal with the problem. The area was considered not completely loyal to Italy, and the enforcement of a policy of forced Italianization did not help the assimilation of the new subjects. With the outbreak of the war, and the 1941 invasion of Yugoslavia, the situation quickly deteriorated. Slovenian and Croatian conscripts drafted into the Royal Italian Army were forbidden to serve in the area, and by 1942 most of them, who served in non-combatant units called ‚ÄúSpecial Battalions‚Äù largely deployed in southern Italy and Sardinia, were also denied furloughs, to prevent their desertion. Indeed the Italian Armed forced suffered several cases of desertion of these non-Italian soldiers, who in some cases joined the partisans units, as Janko Premrl, brother in law of the Italian/Slovenian novelist, Boris Pahor did. Mario Toffanin was considered by the Yugoslavs a loyal communist and a true and expert revolutionary, and in view of the new scenario created by the Italian capitulation he was sent as Yugoslav agent, to Trieste then occupied and administrated by the Germans. There, he organized and led the local Partisan units or GAP (Gruppi Di Azione Patriottica), which were linked to the Yugoslav Communists. It was in Trieste that he earned his battle name ‚ÄúGiacca‚Äù or ‚ÄúJacket‚Äù, probably because the day he reported there, he wore a suede jacket, an uncommon garment at the time. During this time his wife Maria, was arrested, and deported to Auschwitz; she returned at the end of 1945. The massacre of Porz√ªs On 2 February 1945 Toffanin left Trieste and went to Udine, with the task to recruit a new GAP. On 7 February 1945 he received orders from the local cell of Italian Communist Party of Udine (PCI) and the 9th Corps of Yugoslav Liberation Army, to head a group of communist partisans (some sources says up to 100), to the HQ of the Brigade of the Partisan Division Osoppo, a non-communist unit, located near the ‚Äúmalghe‚Äù of Porz√ªs, in the municipality of Faedis in eastern Friuli. Their mission was to seize the Osoppo HQ and arrest the Osoppo partisans. The group was directed by Toffanin and by Fortunato Pagnutti, name de guerre \\"Dinamite\\" (dynamite), climbed the mount Toplj-Uork, and approached the Osoppo partisan disguised as disbanded soldiers. The ruse was successful and the Osoppo partisans were disarmed and apprehended. During the subsequent reconstruction of the events, it appears that Toffanin personally interviewed Osoppo partisan Leader ‚ÄúBOLLA‚Äù, Francesco De Gregori (the paternal uncle of the famous Italian singer Francesco De Gregori, and a former Captain of the Alpini Corps of the Royal Italian Army) to know the whereabouts of the Brigade weapon cache, that was subsequently seized. Thereafter the prisoners and the equipment were marched down into the valley, while De Gregori, the brigade political commissar Gastone Valente nom de guerre \\"Enea\\", the twenty-year old Giovanni Comin \\"Gruaro\\" and a woman Elda Turchetti, believed to be a spy, were executed. Another Osoppo Partisan leader, Aldo Bricco \\"Centina\\", although wounded, escaped the execution. The following day the remaining Osoppo partisans were assigned to the partisan Battalions \\"Ardito\\" and \\"Giotto\\". However some of them, among whom Guido Pasolini a.k.a. \\"Ermes\\", brother of the writer Pier Paolo Pasolini, were also executed. As the news of the massacre surfaced, the federation of the PCI of Udine at first attempted to put the blame on the Germans and the Republican Fascists, but few days later the Toffanin group was disbanded. From then onward the episode will be remembered as the ‚ÄúPorz√ªs massacre‚Äù. Mario Lizzero, political commissar of the brigades Garibaldi - Friuli, as soon as he heard of the massacre proposed the death penalty for Toffanin and his men. In his autobiography published posthumously in 1995 Mario Lizzero a.k.a. Andrea (Mortegliano, 28 June 1913 ‚Äì Udine, 11 December 1994) stated: \\"A hundred Garibaldini members, without uniforms (...) convince themselves, without having real evidence, that twenty or so Osovari partisans were somewhat connected with the enemy‚Ä¶ as soon as they arrived, the commander \\"Bolla\\", the Political Commissioner \\"Enea\\", a woman, and a fourth man, were arrested, and subsequently executed. During the following days other Osoppo partisans were executed without a trial. In total, without any trial: 19 Osoppo partisan murdered! (...) That was not partisan justice, but a real massacre (...). I believe that the massacre of Porzus is at the origin of the great loss of prestige and strength of the Garibaldi resistance and also of the PCI. Unfortunately, on that GAP unit lead by \\"Giacca\\" the Division Garibaldi \\"Friuli\\" of which I was political commissioner has never had any real influence, being that unit (which after Porzus was disbanded ), under the firm orders of the Friulian Communist Federation.¬ª The information that the ‚ÄúGaribaldini‚Äù received from an undisclosed source, were pure allegations. Instead, evidences were given that, indeed the Osovans were received the proposal of a meeting by enemy, were they Republican Fascists or Germans is not known, but those proposals, were never taken into consideration and turned down without any contact. In the end it appears that the Porzus massacre was just a deliberate act probably part of a larger strategy, to eliminate possible future enemies who might have opposed the eventual inclusion of part of the eastern Italian provinces to the new Communist Yugoslavia, which had been envisioned during the Jaice Congress of 1943 aimed to extend the communist dominance. Like many Italian Communists, Toffanin was an Internationalists, who really believed in a communist utopic world with no borders. The Yugoslav were internationalist in words, but the reality was different; their main goal was to extend Yugoslavia, as they clearly showed in the years after the war, and that become more evident when Tito‚Äôs Yugoslavia severed ties with Moscow in 1948. After the war, a large part of the leadership and communist base of Venezia Giulia began a campaign for the constitution of a 7th Federative Republic corresponding to the territory of Venezia Giulia itself, thus starting the controversial post-war international negotiations, claiming the annexation of Trieste, Monfalcone and part of the Isontino to Yugoslavia. When the dream of the union with Yugoslavia faded away, Toffanin, like approximately 2,500 Italian workers of Friuli-Venezia Giulia, emigrated to Yugoslavia between 1946 and 1948 to offer their professional skills mostly at the Fiume/Rijeka and the Pola shipyard, handed over by Italy to Yugoslavia following the Treaty of Paris of 10 February 1947. Historians refer to them as the ‚ÄúMonfalconesi‚Äù. Although Toffanin emigrated to Yugoslavia to escape justice, it is possible that he also wanted to put his peacetime dockyard expertise at the service of Yugoslavia. Another notorious example of this emigration is the Italian born writer Giacomo Scotti; born in Saviano (Naples Province) on 1 December 1928, a fervent communist who left Italy in 1947, and that still lives in Croatia where is a member of the (Dru≈°tvo hrvatskih knji≈æevnika) the Croat writers association. When in 1948, Tito severed the ties with Stalin, things rapidly changed for the Monfalconesi. The Yugoslav leadership considered them as potential internal enemies, a sort of fifth column, since they were almost all loyal to the concept of the ‚ÄúGreat Soviet Family‚Äù, and a process of repression started. Most of the Monfalconesi, alongside with the native Italians who had not moved to Italy after the end of WW2 were interned in the infamous Goli Otok, the gulag built on the homonymous island of Kvarner in which were imprisoned in inhuman conditions, and sometimes died, many internal opponents of Tito, often communists, of all nationalities present in Yugoslavia. Later, many Monfalconesi were expelled to Italy where their return was keep secret by the Italian Communist Party, or to countries of the Soviet bloc, Czechoslovakia in particular, like Toffanin who could not return to Italy where he was sentenced to life in prison; others, very few, decided to remain in Yugoslavia. After WW2 On 1 May 1945 the Yugoslav Communist Army occupied the Julian March, which was annexed to Yugoslavia. During the forty-day Yugoslavian occupation of Trieste, in 1945, Toffanin was appointed political commissar. The Yugoslav Army left the city as well as many other small villages of the Istrian peninsula on 12 June 1945. On 23 June 1945 Mario Toffanin was officially indicted by Public Prosecutor office of Udine for the massacre of Porzus of the Osoppo Division Command. In 1946 when Trieste, was still under the Allied Military Government rule, he fled to Yugoslavia, where he received the \\"Partizanska Spomenica 1941\\", a Yugoslav medal of honor for veterans of the partisan war. When Yugoslavia was expelled from Cominform, Mario Toffanin, and some other International communist moved to Czechoslovakia. In October 1951 the trial of the facts of Porz√ªs began at the Court of Assizes of Lucca. In 1952 he was sentenced in absentia to life imprisonment. In 1978, during the Sandro Pertini presidency he was granted pardon, an act that was criticized by many. This act of clemency also enabled him to receive a pension by the Italian Government. With the dissolution of Yugoslavia in 1991 he returned to Slovenia, and settled down first in Capodistra-Koper and then in Albaro Vescov√†/ Skofie, a small village half a mile away from the Italian border. When in 1996 he was interviewed by the Roberto Morelli of the Corriere della Sera, he showed no sign of regret for his actions during the war, confirming his communist faith and repeating the accusations to the Osoppo partisans of collaboration with the enemy. When his pension check issue was raised, he replied that he had earned it, by having worked 13 years at the Trieste dockyards and by having fought 4 years of war, and that the years of work at the dockyards plus the war benefits granted him that right, in accordance with the Italian laws. During his second exile in Slovenia, he often went to Trieste unmolested, to visit his son. He died in Sesana at the age of 86 on 22 January 1999. Reconciliation between the Garibaldini and Osoppo partisans On 8 August 2002, in the place of the massacre, two former partisan commanders, Giovanni Padoan, battle name \\"Vanni\\" (Cormons, 25 June 1909 - 31 December 2007) a former Political commissar of the Garibaldi Natisone Brigade, and Father Bello a catholic priest and a former commander into the Osovan Partisans, met and eventually reconciled the two factions. At the meeting, Padoan denied his personal involvement in the matter stating that on that day he was at the Yugoslav Partisan HQ of Cerkno/Circhina, but took the responsibility for the massacre, offered his apology and asked forgiveness to survivors and victims‚Äô relatives. He also stated that, although the order came directly from the IX Yugoslav Army corps, the executors were Italian Gap members under the command of the Udine Federation of the Italian Communist Party. He added that Mario Toffanin, whom he defined a ‚Äúnarrow-minded-man‚Äù who had to carry on the operation, wanted this order to be endorsed by the Udine Federation of the Communist Party. The orders were approved by two communist leaders of the Udine Federation, Modesti and Tambosso. Father Bello stated during his speech, that the orders indeed came from the Yugoslav IX corpus, but also that Palmiro Togliatti, the leader of the Italian Communist Party, gave his approval. In addition Padoan reported that the apologies should have been offered during the first trial in Lucca, where he was acquainted, but at the time the international situation and cold war, did not allowed such a move. On 10 February 2003, during another official remembrance ceremony, he reiterated the apologies and excuses. Giovanni Padoan received a thirty-year sentence by the Appeal court during the second trial of 1959, a sentence that was confirmed by the Italian Supreme Court. Before the sentence was passed, the communist party sent him in Czechoslovakia and then in Romania. He was granted amnesty in 1959, and returned to his native Cormons where he died in 2007. Mario Lizzero detto Andrea (Mortegliano, 28 giugno 1913 ‚Äì Udine, 11 dicembre 1994) The others Osoppo partisans killed at Porzus, whose names are enshrined on the memorial that commemorates the massacre where: Ado Guidone, Aragona Make, Ateone Massimo, Barletta Porthos, Cagliari Rapido, Cariddi Rinato, Ermes Roberto, Flavio Toni, Gruaro Vandalo. Aftermath The Osoppo- Friuli Brigades were autonomous partisan groups founded at the headquarters of the Archiepiscopal Seminary of Udine on 24 December 1943, on the initiative of laypersons liberal, socialist and Catholic inspired volunteers, some groups already active after 8 September 1943 in Carnia and Friuli areas. The Osoppo partisans were accused by the communists of collusion with enemy, particularly with famous or infamous ‚ÄúDecima Flottiglia MAS‚Äù of Junio Valerio Borghese, and also to oppose the Yugoslav Resistance movement. During the last months of the war, the X¬™ MAS units were deployed to the eastern Italian border against Josip Broz Tito's partisans who marched into Istria and Venezia Giulia. It was rumored that Borghese was attempting to arrange a deal with Non-communist partisan units in order to prevent and stop the Yugoslav territorial ambitions that by 1944 ‚Äì 1945 were becoming more evident. The Garibaldi Brigades were partisan brigades organized by the Italian Communist Party operating in the Italian resistance during the Second World War. The brigade operating since October 1943, in the Julian Pre and Carnic Pre alps theater, was the 1st \\"Friuli\\" Garibaldi Brigade. On 20 September 1944 the Slovenian Popular Army HQ unilaterally abolished the agreements with the CLN of April 1944, which included a Slovenian-Italian \\"Joint Command\\" on these units. By this act the Italian units were now under, not only operational, the Slovenian Popular Army. In some cases serious problems of collaboration between Italian partisans and the formations of the Slovenian People's Liberation Army arose on the eastern border, where the strong slave chauvinist ideas, the difficulties of the Italian communist leaders and the contradictory aspects of their politics favored anti-Slavic divisions and resentments in the non- communist Resistance forces. A few days before the massacre a British Liaison Officer attached to the Slovenian Partisans sent a report to the Foreign Office in London. In his report, the Liaison Officer stated that the unit which he was attached to had just taken as prisoners some other Italian Partisans belonging to the Osoppo Brigade. When he asked the reason for that, he was told by a Partisan Officer that, he had been instructed by his seniors, and that any obstruction by the British mission would have caused their sending away from the unit. Following this event the Liaison Officer concluded that the Communist partisans were about to attack the Osoppo Partisans. The Report was then sent to the Foreign Office who immediately asked to Fitzroy Maclean, head of the MACMIS, to raise the matter directly with Tito. At the end of the war the allies and the Italian National Liberation Committee ordered all the Italian Partisan Brigades to disband and to hand over all their armaments. However the communist partisans did not completely obey; some sources estimated that at least forty percent of the weapons were kept in secret stashes by the communists who did not trusted the new government, and for an envisioned communist revolution. Seven years later in 1952 Mario Toffanin, alongside with 36 ex Gap-member, were sentenced to serve 777 years in jail for the Porzus massacre. At that time Toffanin was living in Praha working as a welder; the other GAP sentenced members served little or no time at all in jail, due to amnesties. The Osoppo Commander, Francesco De Gregori was posthumously awarded with the Silver Medal. Elda Turchetti was cleared by the allegations of being a spy during the trial in Lucca.

Born into a family of eight, she first gained attention as a member of a girl group \\"Kiwi\\" in 2004. With her trademark blonde hair, and unorthodox dance moves, she was often the face of the group. After her band went inactive in 2014, she pursued a solo career. She has since release four studio albums, \\"I am in love\\" (2015), \\"11.06\\" (2015), \\"Hug-Jim\\" (2017), and \\"Don't Stop\\" (2018).

She attended and graduated from the \\"Mongolian Arts and Culture Academy\\". She has stated that one of her older sisters also attended the academy with her, and has a good singing voice, but never pursued a singing career. After the academy, she joined a break-dancing group, named \\"Neg Khoroolol\\". During this time, she was infamous as a rather poor singer. Her dance-group members insisted that she attend \\"Nature Sound\\" studio's, then newly established, singing school. Upon graduation, she stayed at the school as a dance instructor.

Description The canal transports water from the Weber River to users in parts of Weber and Davis counties for residential garden and lawn purposes, as well as agricultural. Water for canal is stored in both the East Canyon Reservoir and the Echo Reservoir. The canal is owned and operated by the Davis and Weber Counties Canal Company (DWCCC), a private nonprofit organization established in 1884 and headquartered in Sunset. The lower part of the Devil's Gate-Weber Hydroelectric Power Plant, were the Davis‚ÄìWeber Canal originates, November 2009 The canal begins on the south side of the Weber River at a diversion dam immediately below the lower part of the Devil's Gate-Weber Hydroelectric Power Plant in Weber Canyon (on the border of Weber and Davis counties). From its head, the open canal immediately flows west under the eastbound lanes of Interstate 84 before reaching its first enclosure. The enclosed canal then flows westerly down the south edge of the canyon, and just south Weber River (with Interstate 84 just north of the river). At the mouth of the Weber Canyon, the now open canal continues southwesterly (while the river and the highway continue west). After entering the city of South Weber, the canal passes under U.S. Route 89. From there it continues northwesterly along the southern edge of South Weber, at the base of the plateau upon which Hill AFB is located. (The Bambrough Canal also flows along this course, just north of the Davis‚ÄìWeber Canal.) Between about 1650 East to about 600 East, the canal has been enclosed. On the western end of South Weber, the canal is once again enclosed, before passing under the south end of Utah State Route 168 (just north of the unused North Gate of Hill AFB). As the canal crosses the Davis‚ÄìWeber county line it also leaves South Weber to enter the city of Riverdale. The slope of the edge of the plateau is particularly steep as the still enclosed canal passes through Riverdale to the northernmost tip of Hill AFB, just east of Interstate 15 (I‚Äë15). The canal then turns southerly to run between I‚Äë15 on the west and Hill AFB on the east. Just after turning south, the canal leaves Riverdale and briefly passes through the eastern edge of the city of Roy. Upon crossing the Davis‚ÄìWeber county line again, the canal leaves Roy and enters the city of Sunset, and the canal becomes open again. Running south between I‚Äë15 and Hill AFB, the canal continues through Sunset until about 1700 North. After crossing southwesterly under I‚Äë15 and North Main Street (Utah State Route 126), the open canal continues south along the west side of North Main Street until about 1200 North. The canal then becomes enclosed again until after it crosses back under South Main Street at about 830 North. At 800 North, the canal leaves Sunset and enters the city of Clearfield. After passing under East 650 North (Utah State Route 103), the once again open canal turns southeasterly an begins passing through residential neighborhoods on the west side of I‚Äë15. Between East 650 North and East 300 North, the northern section of the Clearfield Canal Trail runs along the western bank of the canal. South of East 300 North, canal becomes enclosed again as it continues on its southeasterly course. At about 340 South, canal returns to the west side of I‚Äë15 and, not longer enclosed, passes east under the freeway. On the east side of I‚Äë15, the canal is immediately joined by the southern section of the Clearfield Canal Trail (which been running southeast along the east edge the freeway from East 200 South). Continuing on, the still open canal runs southeasterly between I‚Äë15 on the southwest (with the Clearfield Canal Trail in between) and South 1000 East on the northeast. At about 615 South, the canal and trail abruptly and briefly tune east before the canal passes under East 1000 South. The still open canal continues east- southeasterly until it reaches East 700 South (Utah State Route 193/Bernard Fisher Highway); the trail runs along the west edge of South 1000 East for this short section. The canal is enclosed again to pass directly south under the highway and remains enclosed for another brief stretch. South of East 700 South, the enclosed canal resumes its east-southeastly course through residential neighborhoods, with the Clearfield Canal Trail on its southeastern bank. Just before crossing under South 1500 East, the canal opens once again, but continues its east-southeasterly course until it reaches University Park Boulevard/North 1200 West. The southern section of the Clearfield Canal Trail ends at that street as the canal leaves Clearfield and enters the city of Layton. After entering Layton, the still open canal continues its east- southeasterly course through residential neighborhoods, but becomes enclosed once again, just before crossing under North 1000 East. Remaining enclosed on its east-southeasterly course, the canal passes under North 800 West and North 650 East. At about 550 East, the canal turns slightly to a more easterly course before passing under North Hill Field Road (Utah State Route 232). Resuming a more east-southeasterly course, the still enclosed canal passes by the southern edge of Northridge High School before crossing under North 50 West, Antelope Drive, and North Fort Lane. After North Fort Lane, the canal turns slightly north before heading southeast to the Church Street Reservoir. Surplus from that reservoir flows in an unlined ditch under Church Street and North Fairfield Road before emptying into Kays Creek (which flows southwesterly to the Farmington Bay of the Great Salt Lake. History East Canyon Dam, June 2009 The original canal was built by the DWCCC in the mid 1880s to provide water for agigultural needs and eventually extended south to reach Fruit Heights. To ensure the Weber River could sustain adequate water flow for the canal, an earthen dam was built by the DWCCC on the East Canyon Creek (a tributary of the Weber River) in East Canyon. By the early 1910s the original earthen canal was reconstructed and lined with concrete. Although improvements continued on the dam, having been enlarged twice since it was originally constructed, the original dam in East Canyon was replaced in the mid-1910s with a new concrete dam, also built by the DWCCC. However, the second dam was replaced by a third dam, built below the second, in the mid-1960s. Although the third dam was built by the United States Bureau of Reclamation, it is still operated by the DWCCC, with financial support from the Weber Basin Water Conservancy District. Over the years much of agricultural land in the service area has transitioned to residential subdivisions. As a result, beginning in the 1980s, the canal began supplying secondary water (untreated, [non-potable] water used only for residential lawn and gardening) in its service area. As of 2004, the secondary water was supplied by the canal in parts of Layton and Kaysville, as well as for the cities of Clinton and West Point.

Februar 1770 at Cherrueix, Bretagne ‚Äì 10. February 1814 in Paris) was a French physician and physiologist.  Life  C√©sar Julien Jean Legallois was the son of the Breton farmer C√©sar Legallois (circa 1743-1784) and his wife Julienne Anne Th√©r√®se Bouassier (1739-1771). His mother died early, his father gave him a good education. When his father died, Legallois was thirteen and a student at Coll√®ge de Dol. Through a modest inheritance, he was able to continue his education. His interests were quite diverse, so he won the first prize in rhetoric at the Coll√®ge of Dol. After the popular uprising of June 2, 1793 and the Reign of Terror he was a supporter of the F√©d√©ralistes. These sympathies threatened his life at times. Legallois began his medical studies in Caen and continued in Paris. His career, however, was interrupted more than once by illness. He graduated in medicine in 1801 at the √âcole de M√©decine de Paris. While preparing for his dissertation, he recognized the importance of experimental research. For this reason, he devoted himself later to physiological research. The subject of his dissertation was Le sang est-il identique dans tous les vaiseaux qu'il parcourt? (which translates to: \\"Is blood the same in all the vessels it moves through?\\") presented at the Ecole de M√©decine de Paris. For about ten years he served as a doctor for the poor in the 12th arrondissement of Paris. In addition to medicine, he studied several languages: Greek, Italian and English. Even before his doctorate, Legallois gained experience in practical medicine, for example through his work in various hospitals. In 1813, Legallois became the director of the Bic√™tre hospital, chef de l'hospice and the prison of Bic√™tre. His only son, Eug√®ne Legallois (about 1805-1831), was also a doctor. He died in 1831, returning from Poland, as a result of a cholera epidemic.  Scientific achievements  He began a long series of physiological experiments to study the basic physical conditions necessary for the maintenance of life functions throughout the organism. Legallois conducted a series of animal experiments to clarify the mechanism of respiration. By decapitation of vertebrates or other targeted destruction of neural connections in the brain and spinal cord, he came to the conclusion that respiration is controlled by a respiratory center located in the medulla oblongata. His discovery was that a lesion, on a small circumscribed area in the medulla, inhibits breathing (1811). This was the first attempt to localize respiratory regulation and was later completed by the work of Marie-Jean-Pierre Flourens (1794-1867). One of his most important discoveries was the demonstration of metameric organization of the spinal cord, from which each segment as a neural center of a particular region (e.g. As dermatome, Myotom) serves to coordinate about their sensory and motor activity. The idea of an extracorporeal circulation was introduced by him in his 1812 monograph Exp√©riences sur le principe de la vie, notamment sur celui des mouvemens du c≈ìur, et sur le si√®ge de ce principe\\". \\"(...) But if one could replace the heart with some form of injection and at the same time continuously provide natural or artificially produced arterial blood for this injection - provided that such an artificial production is possible - life would succeed effortlessly maintaining each part of the body for an indefinite period of time: consequently, after decapitation, one could maintain all brain functions in the mind itself. In this way, one could not only maintain life in the head or in any other part isolated from the body of the animal but also recall it thereafter its complete extinction. One could also call it back into the whole body and thus accomplish its true resurrection in the truest sense of the word. (...)\\"Zitat aus W. B√∂ttcher, V. V. Aleksi-Meskishvili, R.

Her early work was figurative, but she increasingly moved towards abstract expressionism. With artists such as and , she opened the way for abstraction in Latin American art. Her work appeared in group shows during the 1930s, and her first solo exhibition occurred in 1945. In 1963, she was awarded the prize for best painter from Brazil at the 7th S√£o Paulo Art Biennial. In 1965, her work was featured in a solo show at the 8th S√£o Paulo Art Biennial. Mohalyi had solo exhibitions in Europe, Japan and the United States as well as Latin America. Her first major retrospective show was held at the Museu de Arte Moderna de S√£o Paulo (MAM) in 1976. Since her death on August 23, 1978, her work has been shown in solo exhibitions including those of 1979, 1982, 1984, 2008, 2009, 2014 and 2015. Her works are included in the permanent collections of the Art Museum of the Americas in Washington D.C. (formerly the Museum of Modern Art of Latin America), the Museum of Contemporary Art, University of S√£o Paulo (MAC), the Casa Roberto Marinho in Rio de Janeiro, and the Cleusa Garfinkel collection in Brazil. Career =Early life = Yolanda L√©derer was born in 1909 in what was then Kolozsv√°r, Kingdom of Hungary (later Cluj-Napoca, Romania.) She studied at the Free School of Nagyb√°nya and then attended the Royal Academy of Budapest from 1927 to 1929. \\"Yolanda Mohalyi\\". In: Ita√∫ Cultural Encyclopedia of Brazilian Art and Culture. Ita√∫ Cultural, S√£o Paulo. Enciclopedia.itaucultural.org. Her parents were musicians. She learned bel canto singing and was a life-long lover of classical music, describing her later abstract work as musical. In 1931, Yolanda L√©derer moved to Brazil to marry a Hungarian chemist, Gabriel Mohalyi, who was employed there. =Figurative works= Already an accomplished artist, Yolanda Mohalyi settled in S√£o Paulo, Brazil and taught drawing and painting. Among her students were Giselda Leirner , Eleonore Koch,\\"Eleonore Koch\\". In: Ita√∫ Cultural Encyclopedia of Brazilian Art and Culture. Ita√∫ Cultural, S√£o Paulo. Enciclopedia.itaucultural.org. and Alice Brill. Her earliest works were often vivid watercolors, with a sense of light and transparency, that show the influence of expressionism. Many of Mohalyi's works from the 1930s focus on the human figure and show her concern for social injustice and the disadvantaged. In 1935, Mohalyi began to attend Lasar Segall's salon. Lasar Segall (1891-1957) made a deep impression on Mohalyi, strongly influencing her figurative work, which became darker and more sombre. Mohalyi's color palette became similar to Segall's, with a predominance of ochre tones in a dense and elaborate chromatism. However Mohalyi differed from Segall in her use of yellows. She displayed considerable skill in using oils to create luminous and transparent effects similar to her watercolors. The similarities between her work and Segall's were pointed out by critics such as and S√©rgio Milliet, who called for Mohalyi to develop her own style. Around 1937, Mohalyi joined the \\"Grupo dos Sete\\" (Group 7) alongside Victor Brecheret (1894-1955), Elisabeth Nobiling (1902-1975), Rino Levi (1901-1965), (1895-1967), (1891-1980) and Regina Gomide Graz (1897-1973). World War II brought changes: in 1939 Gabriel Mohalyi lost his job, and the couple moved to Rio Grande do Sul for a time. A number of German-Jewish refugees were among Mohalyi's students, and some of her works from the 1940s, such as \\"Mem√≥rias\\" (Memories) reflect the situation of World War II refugees. Mohaluyi's first solo exhibition took place in 1945 at the Instituto de Arquitetos do Brasil (Institute of Architects of Brazil). It was positively reviewed by art critic Lu√≠s Martins. In 1951 Mohalyi made her first woodcuts, studying with Hansen Bahia (1915-1978) in Salvadore. During the 1950s, Mohalyi used dark, saturated colors for her paintings, sometimes mixing dense, heavy paint with sand or other materials to create a rough texture. Mohalyi's works gradually became more abstract, particularly their backgrounds, and showed some influences from Cubism. She increasingly attracted the attention of international collectors. Between the 1950s and 1960s, Mohalyi created stained glass windows for the Funda√ß√£o Armando Alvares Penteado (FAAP) and frescos for the (with Alfredo Volpi and others) and the church of S√£o Domingo. Later, she designed stained glass for the Capela de S√£o Francisco in Itatiaia. =Abstraction= In 1957, Mohalyi returned to Europe for the first time since she had left in 1931. In Arezzo, Italy, she was deeply struck by the paintings of Piero della Francesca, a fifteenth-century Renaissance master. By her own account, his work determined her to abandon figurative painting. She rejected the modernist movements of cubism and expressionism for pure abstraction. On her return to Brazil, she visited Lasar Segall, whose work had so tremendously influenced her. He implored her not to become an abstractionist; Mohalyi felt \\"she just had to\\". Segall died soon after, on August 2, 1957. From then on, Mohalyi rejected figurative art and definitively embraced abstraction. Increasingly, her canvases featured large forms of color freely overlaid with linear elements. Wide gestures expanded into increasingly larger spaces and loose textures. Combinations of colors often created subtle transparencies, giving her later works in particular a sense of luminosity. In 1958, Mohalyi received the , founded by (1903-1962), a director of the Museu de Arte Moderna de S√£o Paulo (MAM) and a founder of the . In 1959, she participated in the Primeira Exposi√ß√£o Coletiva de Artistas Brasileiros na Europa.\\"PRIMEIRA Exposi√ß√£o Coletiva de Artistas Brasileiros na Europa\\". In: Ita√∫ Cultural Encyclopedia of Brazilian Art and Culture. Ita√∫ Cultural, S√£o Paulo. Enciclopedia.itaucultural.org. Between 1960 and 1962, Mohalyi taught in the FAAP design and plastic arts course. In 1962, she represented Brazil at the first Bienal Americana de Arte in C√≥rdoba, Argentina, where Sir Herbert Read chose her work for inclusion in an exhibition to visit the United States. Mohalyi participated in multiple national and international exhibitions and almost all the international S√£o Paulo Art Biennials between 1951 and 1967. In 1963, she was awarded the prize for best national painter in Brazil at the 7th S√£o Paulo Art Biennial. She had a special room at the following Biennial in 1965. Throughout her life, Mohalyi exhibited widely, with solo exhibitions in Europe, Japan and the United States as well as Latin America. Her first major retrospective show occurred in 1976, at the Museu de Arte Moderna de S√£o Paulo (MAM). Legacy Yolanda Mohalyi died without heirs on August 23, 1978 in S√£o Paulo, Brazil. Her friends J√ºrgen and Barbara Bartzsch were the executors of her estate. They catalogued her work and donated 50 of her paintings to the Museum of Contemporary Art, University of S√£o Paulo (MAC). The works were selected by director Wolfgang Pfeiffer. In 1979, a memorial exhibition of her work was shown at the 15th S√£o Paulo Biennale. Her work was also shown in posthumous solo exhibitions in 1982 and 1984 at the DAN Galeria in S√£o Paulo. DAN Galeria was founded in 1972 by J. Peter Cohn and Gl√°ucia S. Cohn. Mohalyi's work continues to be of interest in the 21st century. Art historian and curator Maria Alice Milliet has studied her work, curating exhibitions in 2008, 2009, and 2015. In 2008, an exhibit at the Oscar Niemeyer Museum in Curitiba focused on Mohalyi's lyrical abstraction. In 2009, a retrospective exhibition at the Pinacoteca do Estado de S√£o Paulo covered Mohalyi's work from the 1930s to the 1970s. In 2014, a retrospective of Mohalyi's work at the Museu de Arte Moderna de S√£o Paulo (MAM) included more than 400 works. Wolfgang Pfeiffer presented a talk about her work. In 2015, the retrospective exhibition Yolanda Mohalyi: A Grande Viagem at Dan Galeria, focused on around 50 of her works. The exhibition coincided with the publication of Yolanda Mohalyi : a grande viagem (Yolanda Mohalyi : a great journey) by Milliet and Margarida Sant'Anna, the most extensive biography to date about Mohalyi's work.

This diocese is part of the Patriarchal Exarchate in Western Europe since 28 December 2018. The current primate of the Diocese of Chersonesus is Metropolitan Anthony (Sevryuk) since 30 May 2019. The primate of the diocese of Chersonesus is also the primate of the PEWE.  History  The diocese with its headquarter in Paris, France, was established on January 5, 1960 as part of the Exarchate of the Moscow Patriarchate in Western Europe, when Archbishop of Clichy received the title of \\"Metropolitan of Chersonesus\\". The diocese was named after Chersonesus, called Korsun in Russian ( from Old East Slavic), an ancient city in Crimea, founded as a colony by the Greeks.Maxim Osipov According to a legend, it was there that Prince Vladimir of Kiev decided to become a Christian, opening a new page in the history of Russia. From 1979 to 1990, the Diocese of Chersonesus did not have a ruling Bishop, because the clergy of the Moscow Patriarchate from the USSR was considered by the French authorities as Soviet agents, and obtaining a visa for them was most difficult. In addition, the financial situation of the priests of the Exarchate of the Moscow Patriarchate was quite difficult.–ö–æ—Å—Ç—Ä—é–∫–æ–≤ –ê. –ê. –û –Ω–µ–∫–æ—Ç–æ—Ä—ã—Ö –ø—Ä–∏—á–∏–Ω–∞—Ö –Ω–µ—É–¥–∞—á–∏ –ø—Ä–∞–≤–æ—Å–ª–∞–≤–∏—è –∑–∞–ø–∞–¥–Ω–æ–≥–æ –æ–±—Ä—è–¥–∞ // –í–µ—Å—Ç–Ω–∏–∫ –ü–°–¢–ì–£. –°–µ—Ä–∏—è 2: –ò—Å—Ç–æ—Ä–∏—è. –ò—Å—Ç–æ—Ä–∏—è –†—É—Å—Å–∫–æ–π –ü—Ä–∞–≤–æ—Å–ª–∞–≤–Ω–æ–π –¶–µ—Ä–∫–≤–∏. ‚Äî 2016. ‚Äî –°. 80‚Äî97. By the decision of the Council of Bishops of the ROC on January 30‚Äì31, 1990, the Western European Exarchate was abolished, and its dioceses, including the Chersonesus one, were subordinated directly to the Holy Synod and the Patriarch of Moscow. Only after the fall of the Iron Curtain did this situation change. New emigrants from the former USSR rushed to the countries under the jurisdiction of the Diocese, which made it possible to replenish the already existing parishes and create new ones. In addition, some parishes of the diocese were established in Spain and Portugal, where there were no parishes of the Moscow Patriarchate previously. The 2000s were characterized by an increase in the number of parishes and parishioners ‚Äî primarily due to migrants from the countries of the former USSR, the aggravation of the relations with the Western European Exarchate of Russian parishes and the normalization of relations with the of the Russian Orthodox Church Outside of Russia (ROCOR). On December 27, 2007, by the decision of the Holy Synod, the patriarcal parishes in Italy were separated from the diocese of Chersonesus and \\"subordinated to the canonical jurisdiction of the Bishop who bears the \\". On April 15, 2008, the Holy Synod of the Russian Orthodox Church ordered to open an Orthodox Seminary in France near Paris. Bishop of Chersonesus was appointed Chancellor of the Seminary. On December 25, 2013, after numerous approvals, a project was approved for the construction of an Orthodox Cathedral and a Russian spiritual and cultural center in Paris. The official opening of the spiritual and cultural center took place on October 19, 2016, and on December 4 of the same year Patriarch Kirill of Moscow and all Russia led the consecration of the Holy Trinity church in Paris. On December 28, 2018, the Holy Synod of the Russian Orthodox Church formed the Spanish-Portuguese diocese which consists of Spain, Portugal and Andorra. At the same time, the diocese of Chersonesus and the newly created Spanish- Portuguese diocese became part of the newly established Patriarchal Exarchate in Western Europe (PEWE), and John (Roshchin) was appointed as primate of the PEWE and of the diocese of Chersonesus. Before that, the Diocese of Chersonesus took charge of the Orthodox communities of the Moscow Patriarchate in France, Switzerland, Portugal and Spain. On 30 May 2019, the Holy Synod of the ROC decided to appoint archbishop Anthony (Sevryuk) of Vienna and Budapest as primate of the PEWE and of the diocese of Chersonesus. At the same time, John (Roshchin), who was until then the primate of the PEWE and of the diocese of Chersonesus, was appointed as primate of the ROC diocese of Vienna and Budapest to replace archbishop Anthony.

She calls Don Draper at the hotel late that night and they make the trip to Betty's childhood home. After arriving, Betty finds out that Gene has had a few mini strokes before this most previous one, which Gloria Massey Hofstadt, Betty's stepmother, has neglected to tell her. Due to his stroke and Betty's resemblance to her late mother, Ruth, her father mistakes her for his late first wife and forgets his daughter's true identity. Betty's brother, William Hofstadt makes her feel guilty that she lives so far away. We also see Don's relationship with his father-in-law. Gene seems very upset with Don while they are sitting at the table putting a puzzle together. His temper flares and he tells Betty ‚ÄúHe has no people! You can‚Äôt trust a man like that!\\" This makes her feel even more left out there, just like she's left out of Don's life. With insight into Betty and William's home life, Gene seems like the authoritarian in the family, though he clearly adores Betty like she adores him. Since Betty understands having a strict father figure, she wishes Don would be that figure in her family as well. When the longtime housekeeper of the Hofstadt family, Viola, comes to help around the house during Betty's stay, she crumbles back into somewhat of a little girl, exclaiming ‚ÄúI‚Äôm an orphan.‚Äù Next, we flash to the office, where Sheila White, Paul's girlfriend, joins him for lunch. We then find out that Paul had made a promise to join her in traveling to Mississippi, to help in the fight to register African American voters. Due to the Aerospace conversation, however, he is now unable to go which upsets her. She asks Paul ‚ÄúAre you scared?‚Äù, to which he rebuttals with ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt pretend this isn‚Äôt scary.‚Äù They then leave the office for lunch, where lift operator Hollis greets him as \\"Mr Kinsey,‚Äù as Hollis usually does. Kinsey, in front of Sheila, decidedly makes it a point of telling Hollis to call him Paul. This is despite never having acknowledged Kinsey on a ‚Äúfirst name basis‚Äù prior to this. Pete is seen talking with his brother, Bud Campbell, about their mother's financial standings after their father's death. Pete agrees to go over to his mother's to sign papers regarding this matter. While there his mother, Dorothy ‚ÄúDot‚Äù Campbell, begins to criticize Pete for him and Trudy's idea to adopt a baby by telling him that his father said it would be ‚Äúpicking from the discards‚Äù and if he chose to adopt, he would be cut off. It's at this point that Pete tells Bud to share the fact that their father spent all of the family's money, leaving their mother with virtually nothing. At Harry Crane's baby shower at the office is going on, Don tells Joan that he will be going to L.A. in place of Kinsey. Joan Holloway then tells Kinsey that Don will be taking his place for the Aerospace convention, embarrassing him in front of the whole office. He calls Sheila, saying that it was his choice not to go and that it was more important to go down to Mississippi and be by her side. Pete explains the thought of going on the plane to California and that it will be the first time he has flown since his father's plane crash to Peggy Olson. He makes sure to tell Peggy he isn't afraid but that \\"It seems significant, that‚Äôs all.‚Äù Peggy tells him that the statistical chance of multiple family members dying from a plane crash on different flights is highly unlikely. Pete confides that ‚ÄúIt wouldn‚Äôt be the worst thing. I hate my mother. What do you think about that?‚Äù Peggy is in shock by this statement, and just exclaims she doesn't know the circumstances. Pete says that him and his brother didn't turn out the best so maybe having a child that wasn't his own would be the better option. Peggy, of course doesn't know Pete is talking about adopting a child, so Peggy just says he should go home. Pete comments ‚ÄúEverything is so easy for you‚Äù unaware that he is the father of Peggy's child. Peggy ends the conversation by saying ‚ÄúIt isn‚Äôt easy for anyone Pete.‚Äù Next, we see Betty up in the middle of the night at the kitchen table. Polly starts growling at a noise coming from outside. Betty just locks the door and doesn't think anything of it. The next day she finds Glen Bishop in Sally's playhouse in the backyard. He says he has run away from home because his mother is never home and she is always out ‚Äúmaking pamphlets and handing them out‚Äù or she's out with her male suitors. He also says his dad wants him and his sister to move in with him and his stepmom, and Glen confides that they have a child together and that his stepmom is mean. Betty invites Glen in, washes his clothes, and makes him lunch. She gives him one of Don's t-shirts to wear. After they eat lunch together they sit and watch TV. Glen reaches over and holds Betty's hand, which she doesn't pull away, even after Glen's weird attraction to her in a previous episode. Glen turns to her and says ‚ÄúI came to rescue you.‚Äù Since Glen had comic books in his runaway bag, she takes this as a joke, asking Glen ‚ÄùDid you bring your cape?‚Äù He tells Betty this isn't a joke and \\"We can go anywhere. I have money.‚Äù Carla, the Draper's housekeeper, then comes home with the kids, Sally Draper and Robert Draper. Glen quickly lets go of Betty's hand and goes to play with Sally and Bobby. Betty calls Helen Bishop, Glen's mother, to let her know that Glen is there and when he picks him up, Glen tells her that she hates him and Betty simply and sadly answers ‚ÄúI know. I‚Äôm sorry.‚Äù Toward the end, we see Paul and Sheila on the van ride down to Mississippi. He claims that advertising can help bring on change. He says that ‚ÄúThe market- and I‚Äôm talking in a purely Marxist sense- dictates that we must include everyone. The consumer has no color.‚Äù Helen, Glen's mom and the neighborhood's divorcee, pays Betty a visit claiming that these incidents with Glen have to stop. With this statement she implies that Betty is letting them happen. Betty says nothing has happened but says ‚ÄúGlen feels alone. Honestly I don‚Äôt blame him.‚Äù After asking if Glen had directly said anything to her, Betty replies ‚Äúnothing, but it‚Äôs obvious.‚Äù Helen explains that with her husband out of the picture, she thought things would be easier but says she's been a terrible mother. Betty then tells Helen that Don is no longer living at home. After being asked a few questions from Helen, Betty tells her that the kids go out to dinner with them and that she isn't sure if it's really over or if she wants their marriage to be over. She says ‚ÄúSometimes I feel like I‚Äôll float away if Don isn‚Äôt holding me down.‚Äù Helen explains ‚ÄúThe hardest part is realizing you‚Äôre in charge.‚Äù We finish out the episode with Pete and Don on the plane to California, the flight attendant explaining the easy flight ahead of them. We see Pete with his sleep mask over his eyes and Don peering out the window, taking a long drag of his cigarette. Cultural References Pete refers to the 1948 Alfred Hitchcock film Rope when he jokes with his brother about killing his mother. The two comics of Glen's that Betty picks up are Action Comics #203 with Superman on the cover (later alluded to in the exchange between Betty and the boy) and Showcase #39, featuring Metal Men.

Setters cement is a similar material used to secure a gemstone while setting or polishing. Dopping cement is usually formulated so that it is hard at room temperature, but soft and moldable like putty at 45-65 ¬∞C, when it can still be shaped with the fingers. The cement is commercially sold as sticks or flat slabs. With metal dopsticks, a low-melting tin-lead solder can be used for that purpose, instead of a dopping cement. Use In typical use, a small amount of cement is melted from the tip of a cement stick or from the edge of a cement slab by holding it over an alcohol lamp or similar source of heat. The tip of the dopstick is dipped into the molten cement, which is allowed to cool until it has the consistency of putty. The stone too is separately warmed up to about the same temperature. Then the dopstick is pressed down over the stone, and the cement is pressed with the fingers so as to tightly enclose it, except for the part that is to be ground or polished. Alternatively, the stone may be warmed up to that temperature, and a few drops of molten cement can be dropped over it. The dopstick is then be placed over the stone, and the cement is pressed around it. The stone can be removed from the dopstick by warming the cement again. Alternatively, the cement can be further cooled with cold water, so that it becomes brittle, and then the stone is pried out with a knife. Composition Dopping cement can be made from several materials, including * Shellac * Chasers pitch * Sealing wax * Beeswax Commercial cements may have other formulations. Formulations with higher melting point, like 65-75 ¬∞C, tend to be harder at room temperature and thus hold the stone more firmly. However, they may be too hot to mold with bare fingers; and some gemstones (like opal and turquoise) are easily damaged by heat.

P. Lovecraft. It stars Nicolas Cage, Joely Richardson, Madeleine Arthur, Q'orianka Kilcher and Tommy Chong. This is Stanley's first feature film directed since his firing from The Island of Dr. Moreau (1996). According to Stanley, it is the first film in a trilogy of Lovecraft adaptations, which he hopes to follow up with an adaptation of \\"The Dunwich Horror\\". Plot In the wake of his wife Theresa's mastectomy, Nathan Gardner moves his family, including children Lavinia, Benny, and Jack, to his late father's farm. One night, a brilliantly glowing meteor crash-lands in their front yard, briefly traumatizing Jack. The next morning, hydrologist Ward Phillips, who is surveying the area for a dam development, along with the mayor and the sheriff of the nearby town of Arkham, arrive to see the meteor. The mayor decides to publicize the meteor, against Nathan's wishes. That night, Nathan and Lavinia witness the meteor being struck by several bolts of lightning. Ward notices that the groundwater has taken on an oily sheen and tests it. When his test strips begin to glow brightly with the Color, he advises the Gardners not to drink it. While notifying nearby resident Ezra of the contamination, he is shown a recording of sounds of unknown origin sounding beneath Ezra's house at night. Meanwhile, Jack becomes fixated on the property's well, observing strange plant growths and insects, as well as claiming to communicate with a 'friend' inside the well. A news crew arrives to interview Nathan about the meteor, but finds that it has vanished, leaving the story uncredible. Later, while Theresa is preparing dinner, she absentmindedly cuts off two of her fingers. As Nathan rushes her to the hospital, he leaves Benny in charge. On Nathan's request, Benny goes outside to put the farm's alpacas back in their stables, but does not return until late at night, claiming time had passed instantaneously for him. Meanwhile, Lavinia attempts multiple times to contact Nathan, but they are unable to hear each other through the phone. Upon the parents' return, Nathan lashes out at Benny and Lavinia with uncharacteristic rage. Later, Nathan becomes frustrated after finding that his most recent harvest of fruits has proven inedible, and Theresa snaps after losing a work client due to the faltering Internet connection, bringing the two to a fight. The same night, Lavinia tries to perform a Wiccan ceremony to save her family, mutilating herself in the process. Theresa suddenly hears Jack and Benny screaming after entering the alpaca stables and rushes to their aid, but in the process, a bolt of Color fuses Theresa and Jack together into a deranged mass. Unable to start the car or call for help as all electronic devices have stopped functioning, and upon discovering sunlight harms Theresa and Jack, Nathan and the children carry them into the attic. Benny reveals that he had witnessed the alpacas after a horrible mutation due to the Color. Nathan decides to euthanize the alpacas with a shotgun after finding they have similarly fused together. Beginning to lose his sanity, Nathan also attempts to euthanize Theresa and Jack but is unable to bring himself to. Lavinia and Benny conspire to leave the farm using Lavinia's horse, but it runs from the property. Before returning inside, Benny insists he hears the family's dog inside the well, but upon climbing in, he is assimilated by the Color. Nathan displays more uncharacteristic rage and locks Lavinia in the attic with Theresa and Jack, who have turned into an aggressive mutated monster. Ward and the sheriff are brought to the farm after a nearby resident discovers a fused mass of animals, and arrive just in time to break into the attic. Nathan shoots and kills the monster, saving Lavinia. After rushing outside, Nathan attempts to shoot the Color emerging from the well, but the sheriff mistakes Nathan's aim for Ward and shoots him, who dies in Lavinia's arms. Ward and the sheriff leave to evacuate Ezra, and Lavinia insists on staying with Nathan. At Ezra's house, the pair only find his desiccated corpse and a recording he left behind, where he surmises that the Color is attempting to remake Earth into \\"something it knows.\\" Heading back towards the farmhouse, a mutated living tree kills the sheriff. Ward returns to rescue Lavinia, but finds her possessed by the Color, which explodes out of the well and forms a funnel into the sky. Ward is shown a vision of where the Color hails from, an exoplanet inhabited by tentacled alien entities, before Lavinia disintegrates. As space and time begin to unravel, Ward enters the farmhouse and is pursued by a murderous apparition of Nathan. He hides in the wine cellar as the Color's distortion of reality drives the property to destruction, leaving Ward the only survivor as he climbs out of the farmhouse's colorless debris. In an epilogue, a traumatized Ward stands on top of the finished dam which covers the former property, and narrates that having witnessed the Color's takeover, he will never drink the dam's water.

The site's critics consensus reads: \\"A welcome return for director Richard Stanley, Color Out of Space mixes tart B-movie pulp with visually alluring Lovecraftian horror and a dash of gonzo Nicolas Cage.\\" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 70 out of 100, based on 28 critics, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews.\\" Chris Bumbray from Arrow in the Head rated the film a score of 7/10, praising the film's performances, visual style and effects while noting the film's length. Bumbray summarized his review by writing, \\"While it's maybe a touch slow and arty for hardcore horror fans, Color Out of Space is still a handy comeback for Richard Stanley, who hasn't lost a beat.\\" Mary Beth Andrews from Daily Grindhouse gave the film a positive review, writing, \\"His [Richard Stanley] film successfully captures the madness of Lovecraft's work and is a dazzling modern interpretation. [...] Lovecraft is notoriously hard to adapt, but Stanley walks the fine line between horror and existential dread to create a successful adaptation\\". Deborah Young from The Hollywood Reporter offered the film similar praise, writing, \\"Hitting the main plot points with well- designed SFX and some impressive night photography, Stanley's film manages to be frightening indeed, even with star Nicolas Cage's semi-farcical leavening adding some nutty laughs.\\" Jonathan Barkan of Dread Central awarded the film 3.5 out of 5 stars, praising the film's visual style, special effects, and soundtrack, while criticizing the film's first and third act. Nevertheless, Barken summarized his review by stating, \\"Gorgeous, vibrant, and terrifying, Color Out of Space is packed with Lovecraftian creatures and cosmic infections galore. It's not perfect but goddamn is it a wild ride.\\" Dennis Harvey from Variety gave the film a mostly positive review, noting the film's uneven tone, \\"full-bore\\" climax, and Cage's \\"arbitrarily oddball\\" performance, while praising the film's otherworldly imagery, cinematography, and direction. The Skinnys Katie Goh gave the film a rating of 3 out of 5, stating that: \\"Colour Out of Space is at its best when Stanley goes for this subtle and intelligent filmmaking, gesturing at the horror rather than pushing it in our faces\\". Howard Gorman from NME praised Stanley's welcome return, underlining the core \\"intense, unpredictable and harrowing moral tale,\\" and Cage putting in his \\"most nuanced\\" turn in the last decade. = Accolades = { class=\\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\\" +Accolades for Color Out of Space - ! scope=\\"col\\" Award ! scope=\\"col\\" Date of ceremony ! scope=\\"col\\" Category ! scope=\\"col\\" Recipient(s) ! scope=\\"col\\" Result - ! scope=\\"row\\" style=\\"text- align:center;\\" Toronto Film Festival  September 7, 2019  Creative Coalition's Spotlight Initiative Award  Nicolas Cage  - ! scope=\\"row\\" style=\\"text-align:center;\\" Fantastic Fest  September 24, 2019  Best Horror Film  Richard Stanley  https://fantasticfest.com/news/entry/2019-fantastic- fest-awards 2019 Fantastic Fest Awards. } References External links * 2019 films 2019 horror films American films Cthulhu Mythos films English-language films Films based on short fiction Films based on works by H.

Their mother, Emily Tracy, was an opera singer and their father, Berthold Haas, was a sculptor. Their older brother Lukas Haas is an actor. Simon Haas studied at the Rhode Island School of Design, while Nikolai focused on music with his band, RRIICCEE, in Los Angeles. Their first collaborative project together was in 2009 when they created bespoke furniture for Tobey Maguire. This project led to other commissions for high-profile clients including Lady Gaga, Donatella Versace, and Peter Marino, which allowed them to formally open their studio in Los Angeles in 2010. In 2013-14, they decided to relocate from New York to Los Angeles. They described the old studio as being too crowded and wanting to have more space for their projects.

Monkeybiz, who also have branded themselves The Haas Sisters, have worked with the Haas Brothers on their Afreaks sculptures, which were included in the Cooper Hewitt Design Triennial. The Haas Brothers have also established a partnership with a group of women from Lost Hills, California, a small agricultural town with limited employment opportunities for women. They have facilitated the opportunity for the women to learn beadwork skills and now employ them for their beadwork creations. Bibliography *R & Company: 20 Years of Discovery.

It stars Covino, Marvin, Gayle Rankin, Talia Balsam, George Wendt, and Judith Godr√®che. It had its world premiere at the Cannes Film Festival in the Un Certain Regard section on May 17, 2019. It is scheduled to be released on November 13, 2020, by Sony Pictures Classics. Plot Best friends Mike and Kyle are biking together when Mike breaks the news to Kyle that he's currently sleeping with his fianc√©. In the ensuing argument, Mike has a moment of road rage with a motorist that culminates into Mike getting assaulted after chasing the motorist down the road. At the hospital, where Mike is recovering from minor head wounds, Kyle's fianc√© visits Mike and is confronted by Kyle over her affair. After she tells him that she still loves him, he then asks if she still wants to get married. Kyle's fianc√© goes on to marry Mike instead, but she unexpectedly dies shortly after. A visibly distraught Mike causes a scene at her funeral which is diffused by Kyle, who came to pay his respects. Mike admits to Kyle that what he did was wrong and that he's a terrible friend. Though Kyle is still angry at Mike, he still consoles him over his loss. Sometime later, Kyle, now in better physical shape, is working as a commercial-jingle writer and is dating his former high-school girlfriend, Marissa, with whom he is celebrating Thanksgiving with his family. Though his overprotective, overbearing mother is disapproving of the relationship, she is nonetheless happy for him when he announces his engagement with her. She then reveals to Kyle that she invited Mike to celebrate Christmas with them, noting his having no family of his own to celebrate with. On Christmas night, a now overweight, alcoholic Mike arrives at Kyle's family's home. Finding his way into the garage, he comes across some old pictures of himself and his old helmet from when he played football in high school. Kyle's mother confronts Mike and tells him that he needs to make amends with Kyle for his selfish actions and stop feeling sorry for himself over how he hurt him. Kyle then stumbles into the living room where he passes out drunk. Seeing Mike's worsened state, Kyle invites him to join him and Marissa on their vacation to a ski resort over New Years. After breaking his arm on a difficult slope, Mike is given permission by Kyle to stay with them for the night, the two of them getting drunk together and catching up on their pasts. A frustrated Marissa tells Kyle that Mike is a negative influence on his life and that he needs to cut him out from it. When Marissa goes to bed early, Kyle joins her in the hopes of having sex, but he quickly passes out before she returns from the bathroom. She then goes down to confront Mike about his behavior, and he attempts to kiss her. Though disgusted, she physically pressures him into following through with his advances, convinced that it will finally convince Kyle to break off their friendship for good. Mike and Marissa's brother Ronnie plan a surprise ice-fishing bachelor party for Kyle before his impending wedding with Marissa. When Kyle momentarily steps away from the party, Mike approaches him and admits that he slept with Marissa. Kyle, angered once again, surprises Mike by saying that he no longer cares and simply wants to spend his life with someone who cares for him. Mike responds that Marissa doesn't actually care for Kyle as he is and wants to turn him into something she wants him to be, suggesting that he leaves her. At some point, Kyle breaks through a thin patch of ice in the frozen lake, though Mike manages to pull him out. Kyle has since cut all ties with Mike, who is lonelier than ever. On the day of Kyle and Marissa's wedding, Mike crashes the ceremony and objects to their union, instigating a small brawl in the church between him and members of both Kyle and Marissa's families. During the confrontation, Marissa loudly declares that she's pregnant and that she's adamant about getting married. Upon learning this, the priest refuses to wed them over concerns that their child is pressuring them into a potentially doomed marriage and advises them to wait until after the child is born. About a year later, Mike is now working at a bicycle shop/caf√©, where a now-married Kyle and Marissa visit him with their newly-born son, the former of whom still misses Mike. Several years later, Kyle and Marissa decide to divorce, presumably over Kyle's seeming refusal to remove Mike from his life. Kyle lives close to Marissa to stay in touch with their son and maintains his friendship with Mike, whom Kyle's son affectionately refers to as his ‚Äúuncle.‚Äù Cast * Michael Angelo Covino as Mike * Kyle Marvin as Kyle * Gayle Rankin as Marissa * Judith Godr√®che as Ava * Talia Balsam as Suzi * George Wendt as Jim * Daniella Covino as Dani Release It had its world premiere at the Cannes Film Festival in the Un Certain Regard section on May 17, 2019.

It came to national attention in the United States by April 2019. The governor of New Mexico, Michelle Lujan Grisham, released a statement indicating the vigilantes have no legal right to detain people entering the US. The head of UCP is Larry Mitchell Hopkins who uses the nom de plume Johnny Horton, Jr. The group and its actions Jim Benvie, a spokesman for the group, said in April 2019 they were present in New Mexico \\"to support the Border Patrol and show the public the reality of the border.\\" The group intends to remain in the area until the border wall known as the Trump wall has been built, or Congress passes stronger immigration laws to make seeking asylum more difficult. The UCP does not consider itself to be a militia, but has a number of militia-like characteristics. It runs an online radio show on which its members offer support for the QAnon conspiracy theory, the claim the supposed \\"deep state\\" is acting against President Donald Trump. The SPLC has documented other rumours and conspiracy theories the group espouses, such as the migrant caravans being an invading army, a means of Muslim militants gaining entry into the US or that the caravans are funded by George Soros. UCP has a rivalry with other armed groups on the border. Horton has said his group is armed for their own self-defense. In mid-April 2019, a video was released online of the group detaining 200 migrants at gunpoint on the US-Mexico border near Sunland Park, New Mexico. This was not the first video the group posted online concerning its activities; it was part of a series extending over several months. The group's patrols, which began the previous February, hold migrants until law enforcement arrives. The group has had an encampment in the area since November 2018, and claims to have detained 3,000 migrants in all. The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) believes the UCP is a product of the \\"vile racism\\" of the Trump administration that \\"has emboldened white nationalists and fascists to flagrantly violate the law.\\" On the same theme see The group's claim that it is performing \\"citizen's arrests\\" has been dismissed by Peter Simonson, the executive director of ACLU in New Mexico, because they are allowable only for a felony. Illegal entry to the country, according to Simonson, is legally classed only as a misdemeanor. Hector Balderas, the attorney general of New Mexico, has said: \\"These individuals should not attempt to exercise authority reserved for law enforcement.\\" Its PayPal and GoFundMe accounts, used for donations, were cut around this time because those online outlets have a policy of not allowing their financial services to be used by organizations which promote hate or violence. The people living at the campsite, on or accessing land owned by the Union Pacific Railroad, were removed by the authorities on April 23. Benvie indicated that the group would not end its detention of migrants following Hopkins arrest two days earlier. Larry Mitchell Hopkins Hopkins has many criminal convictions. In Klamath County, Oregon, in 2006, Hopkins was found guilty of felony firearms offences. He pleaded no contest to the charge of impersonating a police officer. He was sentenced to 60 days' imprisonment and three years' probation, but disappeared after his release from prison. At the time of his arrest, he claimed to be working directly under President George W. Bush. His uniform, similar to a police officer's, had a \\"Special Agent\\" emblem on it, but the precise nature of his claimed investigations were never consistent. An earlier felony involving Hopkins occurred in Michigan in 1996 The FBI visited his New Mexico home in 2017 after they received reports his group was training in the state's northwest to assassinate Hillary Clinton, President Obama and George Soros \\"because of these individuals support\\" of the Antifa movement, he is said to have claimed. These details were later stated in an affidavit from a FBI special agent, but Hopkins lawyer Kelly O‚ÄôConnell said her client had indicated these details were untrue. The FBI agents saw about ten firearms which Hopkins said belonged to his common-law wife Fay Sanders Murphy. They seized at least nine firearms for use as evidence, including a 12-gauge shotgun. At this time, Hopkins‚Äô home was the base for about 20 members of UCP. The FBI has not said why it did not bring charges against Hopkins in 2017. On April 20, 2019, Hopkins was arrested by the FBI in Sunland Park on the grounds that, as a felon, he was in illegal possession of firearms. \\"This is a dangerous felon who should not have weapons around children and families,\\" Attorney General Balderas said in a statement. Hopkins appeared in Federal District Court on April 22 charged with being a felon in possession of firearms and ammunition. He was indicted by a grand jury on these charges on April, the office of the U.S Attorney General said on April 26. Preliminary and detention hearing were scheduled for April 29 in Albuquerque, New Mexico, but a bomb threat resulted in the court having to be cleared moments before the hearing. Hopkins pled guilty to \\"being a felon in possession of a firearm\\" on January 2, 2020. He was sentenced to 21 months in prison.

Formally a national Federation of Le Droit Humain, the international order of mixed co- freemasonry, Universal Co-Masonry split off in 1994 to become an independent masonic obedience. The organization seeks to ‚Äúcombat ignorance in all its forms‚Äù and works ‚Äúto the Glory of God and the Perfection of Humanity‚Äù. Universal Co-Masonry has created ‚Äúa Masonic Government that ensures the maximum liberty compatible with a voluntarily accepted discipline and is organized upon the precepts of the Ancient Mystery Schools, the Scottish Rite, and the English Rite‚Äù. Universal Co-Masonry is active in North America, South America, Europe, Africa and Asia. Universal Co-Masonry also oversees the administration of the Masonic Philosophical Society, a philosophical discussion and educational society that meets online and in several countries. Philosophy Universal Co-Masonry espouses the idea that all human beings are equal, regardless of race, gender, creed or nationality and does not believe that the privileges of Freemasonry should be restricted on the basis of any of these. Universal Co-Masonry views the teachings and philosophies of Freemasonry and other ancient mystery traditions as being essential for the improvement of human society and works to promote values common to all religions throughout the world. =Theosophical influence= The Theosophical Society has had a major influence on the development of Co-Masonry. Founded in 1875 by Helena Blavatsky, Henry Olcott and William Quan Judge, the Theosophical Society promoted ideas of religious unity and philosophical exploration, both central tenets of Universal Co-Masonry. Many Theosophists were women and the Society promoted an interest in the symbolism and rituals of Freemasonry and other similar organizations but as women were barred from participating in the male-only Freemasonry popular at that time many of its members were encouraged to join Co-Masonry. One of the most prominent female Theosophists to join the order was Annie Besant, who attracted numerous English and international Theosophists to the organization. By the late 1930s the American Federation of Le Droit Humain was heavily influenced by Theosophical teachings. Structure & Organization Universal Co-Masonry is organized as the United Federation of Lodges, and it practices the Universal rite of Co-Masonry, which is an amalgamation of the Scottish Rite and English Rite Degrees, and is governed by a Supreme Council of the Thirty-Third Degree. =Degrees= Symbolic Masonry \\"Symbolic Degrees\\" *1 - Entered Apprentice *2 - Fellowcraft *3 - Master Mason English Rite (or York Rite) \\"Chapter Degrees\\" *Mark Master Mason *Royal Ark Mariner *Excellent Master *Holy Royal Arch of Jerusalem Lodge of Perfection \\"Ineffable Degrees\\" *4 - Secret Master *5 - Perfect Master *6 - Intimate Secretary *7 - Provost & Judge *8 - Intendant of the Building *9 - Master Elect of Nine *10 - Master Elect of Fifteen *11 - Sublime Master Elect *12 - Grand Master Architect *13 - Royal Arch of Enoch *14 - Grand Elect and Sublime Mason Chapter Rose Croix \\"Historic Degrees\\" *15 - Knight of the East *16 - Prince of Jerusalem *17 - Knight of the East & West *18 - Knight of Rose Croix of Heredom Council Kadosh \\"Philosophical and chivalric Degrees\\" *19 - Grand Pontiff or Sublime Scottish Knight *20 - Sovereign Prince or Master ad Vitam *21 - Noachite or Prussian Knight *22 - Prince of Lebanon or Royal Axe *23 - Chief of the Tabernacle *24 - Prince of the Tabernacle *25 - Knight of the Brazen Serpent *26 - Prince of Mercy *27 - Sovereign Commander of the Temple *28 - Knight of the Sun, Prince Adept *29 - Knight of Saint Andrew *30 - Knight Kadosh Consistory \\"Official and Ceremonial Degrees\\" *31 - Grand Inquisitor Commanders *32 - Sublime Prince of the Royal Secret Court of Honor \\"Honorary Degrees\\" *33 - Grand Inspector General =Grand Commanders= Louis Goaziou (1903-1937) Edith Armour (1937-1959) Bertha Williams (1959-1968) Helen Wycherley (1968-1983) Calla Haack (1983 -1992) Vera Bressler (1992-1994) Magdalena Cumsille (1994‚Äìpresent) =The Masonic Philosophical Society= In early 2008, Universal Co-Masonry began to organize philosophical discussion groups in several countries and online. These groups are organized for the purpose of combating human ignorance through open and civil discussion and debate on a wide variety of topics. MPS study centers are usually tied to a local lodge and volunteers from the order work to hold meetings and run the administrative aspects of the organization. Membership and participation in the Masonic Philosophical Society is open to all people. =Headquarters= The Headquarters of Universal Co-Masonry is located in Larkspur, Colorado on nearly 250 acres dedicated to the Masonic Work of Co-Masonry. The campus contains an Administrative building, Grand Temple, Dormitories, and Conservatory. The Administration was built in 1924 for sole purpose of supporting the work of Co-Masonry in North America. Today this building houses the Co-Masonic Library and Museum, Archive Rooms, and the Executive Chambers of the 33rd Degree.

In 2019, the Federation Conservatory was constructed as a dining facility and public forum for presentations and round table discussions. Most of the property is forest that rests at the base of Monkey Face Mountain, once called Human Rights Mountain in the early 20th century. Members can hike the property and enjoy the serenity of nature without the disturbances of modern life. History =Early history 1903-1939= Universal Co-Masonry was first established in North America under the name The American Federation of Human Rights. It was an affiliate branch of Le Droit Humain, the world's first Co- Masonic organization, which was founded in 1882 in Paris, France. The American Federation of Human Rights, the predecessor to Universal Co-Masonry, was first established in North America by Antoine Muzzarelli, an educator and life-long Freemason, and Louis Goaziou, a French immigrant who had long been active in the industrial labor, women's rights and immigrant movements of Pennsylvania. An anarchist turned socialist, Goaziou believed that there was potential contained within the teachings and philosophies of Co-Masonry to shape a more just society and dedicated his life to its promotion. The American Federation of Human Rights, American Co-Masonry, established its first masonic lodge, Alpha Lodge #301, in Charleroi, Pennsylvania in 1903. In 1916, the organization moved its headquarters to Larkspur, Colorado in order to be more centrally located and establish a retirement center for ageing members. During the 1920s, American Co-Masonry continued to expand, founding lodge after lodge. It was at this time that Theosophy began to become a significant part of American Co-Masonry, and Louis Goaziou decided that it was in the best interests of the American Federation to maintain a balance between Theosophists and non-Theosophists in the organization. This balance would be maintained until the time of Edith Armour as Grand Commander. When the stock market crashed in 1929 American Co-Masonry was heavily affected. The organization's membership base had long been poor minors and workers, who were drawn to the organization by its sense of community, and its potential to help organize them. As the Great Depression wore on, many of these members were unable to pay their dues, as their jobs disappeared. Lodges in rural areas began to struggle, and the more wealthy Theosophists became a greater and greater share of the membership, slowly eroding the balance sought by Goaziou. It was during this decade that Louis Goaziou passed, and Edith Armour, a prominent Theosophist, became Grand Commander in 1937. =World War Two & Aftermath 1939-1990= During the Nazi invasion of France in World War II the Nazis launched a campaign of repression against all Masonic organizations in the occupied territory. The Supreme Council of Le Droit Humain, the governing body of the institution, went into hiding without having a chance to make arrangements for the future leadership of international Co-Masonry in their absence. In response to this crisis in the international organization, The Most Puissant Grand Commander of the British Federation of Le Droit Humain, suggested to Edith Armour, M.P.G.C. of the American Federation that the two of them set up two temporary Supreme Councils to administer Co-Masonry in several countries while France was under Nazi occupation. Armour agreed, and the Western Supreme Council under Armour administered the Western Hemisphere of International Co-Freemasonry until the liberation of France and the reformation of the Supreme Council of Le Droit Humain in 1945. After the war and the return of the supreme council, the almost entirely Theosophical American Co-Masonry begin to decline in membership. This was largely tied to the organizations dominance by the Theosophical society, which encouraged the admission of only Theosophists into the ranks. As the Theosophical society began to decline in membership, so too did American Co-Masonry. This decline continued until the mid-1990s. =The Split From Le Droit Humain 1990-1994= In the early 1990s, philosophical differences between the French leadership of International Co-Masonry (Le Droit Humain) and the members of the American Federation that had been growing for some time came to ahead. The members of the American Federation voted by an overwhelming majority to declare its independence and separate from Le Droit Humain a split that was effected in April 1994. Because The American Federation was incorporated in the United States and was a legally independent corporate entity from Le Droit Humain, this transition was accomplished smoothly and the two organizations parted ways. =American Co-Masonry 1995-2017= After the split, The American Federation of Le Droit Humain created its own Supreme Council headquartered in Larkspur, to replace the Supreme Council of Le Droit Humain. Renaming itself American Co-Masonry the newly independent order also began establishing lodges outside the United States as an independent organization no longer bound by the system of national Federations that Le Droit Humain had used to organize its members. In 2010, the construction of a new Grand Temple was finished in Larkspur, Colorado, the headquarters of the newly formed international organization. =Universal Co-Masonry 2017-Present= In 2017, the Honorable Order of American Co-Masonry: American Federation of Human Rights changed its name to \\"The Honorable Order of Universal Co-Masonry: United Federation of Lodges\\" to better reflect the international character of the order.

Established in 2014 with support from the government of Maharashtra, it comprises a network of 14 engineering and medical institutes across the state. The BETIC team have developed 50 medical devices as of 2019, and licensed 16 of them to startup companies or industry for mass production.  History  BETIC has its origins in a study conducted by Maharashtra University of Health Sciences, which concluded with a brainstorming meeting at Sahyadri Guest House, Mumbai in Dec 2009. This was attended by about 25 representatives of government, academia and medical community, who unanimously recommended setting up a center for indigenous development of affordable medical devices. The study was funded by Rajiv Gandhi Science & Technology Commission, government of Maharashtra. Its chairperson Dr. Anil Kakodkar invited IIT Bombay to develop a proposal for incubating a biomedical engineering and technology centre based on hub-and- spoke model. This was approved in April 2014 as a five-year project, with a mandate to develop 12 different medical devices and train 50 innovators. BETIC started functioning from OrthoCAD lab in IIT Bombay in early 2015, followed by two satellite centers established at Visvesvaraya National Institute of Technology, Nagpur and College of Engineering, Pune. In the next three years (2016-2018), another four engineering institutes and four medical institutes set up self-funded BETIC cells in collaboration with the first three centers. The Medical Education and Drug Department of Maharashtra approached IIT Bombay to set up three more BETIC cells in government hospitals; this agreement was exchanged in the presence of Chief Minister of Maharashtra, Devendra Fadanavis in February 2019 at Sahyadri guest house, the same place where the first meeting took place ten years earlier. Andhra Pradesh Med Tech Zone, Visakhapatnam and Gujarat Technological University, Ahmedabad also signed agreements with IIT Bombay for collaboration with BETIC. At the 5th annual review, symposium and expo of BETIC held at IIT Bombay on 12‚Äì13 April 2019, over 100 stakeholders representing the government, academia, medical community, startups, industry and investors discussed how to sustain, replicate and scale up the healthcare innovation eco-system.  Centres and key people  BETIC network comprises one main center, two satellite centers, four cells in engineering institutes and seven cells in medical institutes. The centers and their respective founders are listed here. = Main center = * Indian Institute of Technology Bombay, Mumbai (Prof. Bhallamudi Ravi) The center has facilities for 3D scanning, CAD/CAM, 3D printing in biocompatible plastic and metal, printed circuit board design and fabrication, and basic mechanical testing.

The goal is to take new ideas through invention and innovation to impact. This process is referred to as 'bedside to bench to business to bedside', enabling creation of affordable, effective, reliable and suitable products for healthcare in India and other developing countries. The Centre organizes Medical Device Hackathon (MEDHA) during weekends in July, and week-long Medical Device Innovation Camp (MEDIC) in September. Participants include final year students, entrepreneurs, working professionals, teachers and incubation managers. Inter-disciplinary teams of four people are formed, one each from medical, design, electronics and mechanical backgrounds. They select problems from a curated list prepared in consultation with hospitals, evolve novel solution concepts, fabricate proof-of-concepts, and present them to a jury panel. Eight MEDHA and five MEDIC organized during 2015-2019 had more than 700 participants in total. Several winners joined BETIC full-time for developing and commercializing the products; most of them incubated startup companies. The innovation process of BETIC received ISO 13485 certification of quality management system for medical devices, in 2018.  Products and partners  Medical devices developed by BETIC researchers span different medical specialties and risk classes, including medical diagnosis devices, surgical instruments, implants and prostheses. Seven products were licensed to startup companies incubated by the innovators, and five to industry partners. = Startup companies = * Orthopedic surgery planner - AlgoSurg Products (Dr. Vikas Karade) * Smart stethoscope module - Ayu Devices (Adarsha K, Tapas Pandey) * Diabetic foot screening device - Ayati Devices (Nishant Kathpal) * Stance-controlled knee ankle foot orthosis - Aumeesh Tech (Aneesh Karma) * Endo-tracheal blockage detector - Atmen Technovention (Abhijeet Bhagat) * Hybrid plaster splint - MediAsha Technologies (Mayur Sanas) * Silicone implants - NU OSSA Mediquip (Piyush Ukey) * Patient-specific custom implants - Lucid Implants (Pranav Sapkal) * Glaucoma screener - OKO Icare Solutions (Neha Lande) * Maxillofacial surgery guides - Precisurg (Sandeep Dahake) * Skin spray gun - Pacify Medical (Saiprasad Poyarekar) *Jaw relation recorder - Prosthocentric (Dr. Jayant Palaskar) = Industry partners = * Clubfoot brace monitor - Metwiz Materials (Lokap Sahu) * Multi-use biopsy gun - Tenon Meditech (Jaydip Deshpande) * Laparoscopy instrument - Eclipse Instrumentation (Priyal Nagare) * Nasal osteotomy forceps - Om Surgicals (Rashmikant Gangar) * Above knee prosthetic leg - Ratna Nidhi Charitable Trust (Rajiv Mehta)  Awards  Biotechnology Ignition Grant (BIG) instituted by Biotechnology Industry Research Assistance Council, under the Ministry of Science and Technology, Delhi, was won ten times by BETIC innovators.

The novel was first published in the UK on 9 May 2013, by HarperCollins Publishers. It was originally published in the United States by St. Martin's Press under the title Where the Moon Isn't. It is a Sunday Times Bestseller and has been translated into over 30 languages. Background Nathan Filer, who grew up in Bristol, first had the idea for his first novel, The Shock of the Fall, when he was training to be a mental health nurse in 2002. The idea of the central character of Matthew arrived in his head as he was walking home after a shift on an acute psychiatric ward. In 2004 Filer completed his degree in mental health nursing, and in 2007 moved into academia as a research assistant ‚Äî where he looked into treatments for depression. This experience has resulted in Filer having met many patients and their family, saying this aided his book and his work in nursing. After having worked on the novel for seven years, Filer decided in 2009 to study a creative writing MA and make the novel a priority. The book was eventually published on 9 May 2013, after it was subject to an 11-way auction and sold to HarperCollins for a six-figure sum. Synopsis The novel starts with Matt reciting recollections from his childhood, where he blatantly states that he is not a nice person and has not dealt with pain since scraping his knee at the age of nine. This episode happened when he and his brother Simon went camping with their parents at Ocean Grove Holiday Park in Dorset. After scraping his knee, Simon carries Matt back to where they are staying. Shortly after, Simon, who has Down syndrome and several other medical conditions, is found dead. In the present, Matt is being treated at the Hope Road Day Centre mental hospital. He was committed there by his parents, Richard and Susan, after his grandmother found him attempting to make a giant ant farm in his flat, which a hallucination of Simon told him to do. Matt finds his experience at the ward repetitive, and often complains about the rigid schedule. One of Matt's therapists asks him to perform a genogram ‚Äì which eventually makes him remember what happened to Simon by writing about the night he died. It is revealed that Simon's death was the result of a harmless prank gone wrong, where Simon accidentally fell off of a short cliff. After Simon's parents and the ward doctor, Edward Clement, discuss the progress Matt has made at the ward, he is discharged. The novel ends with Matt awaiting his release, stating that the story does not have an end, as he is still living it.

Reception =Reviews= The novel was praised by The Guardian as \\"a gripping and exhilarating read\\", the narrator's voice being \\"dazzlingly rendered\\". British Journal of Psychiatry noted that readers who are psychiatrists hoping to find themselves portrayed within the work would be disappointed, as they are \\"mentioned less than a handful of times throughout\\". However, they praise Filer's \\"very talented storytelling\\" and \\"fine description of psychiatry\\". London Review of Books praises Filer's skillful interweaving of time frames and his \\"impressive feat of storytelling\\". It criticizes that the techniques of suspense used works against the story itself, it \\"reinforces the distinction between the narrator's point of view and the readers\\". Additionally, the lack of ambiguity here makes the book \\"fundamentally out of sympathy with its narrator\\". The Telegraph praises the novel as bittersweet and wonderfully etched, noting that it is \\"an unsettling read but a perceptive and moving one\\". =Awards= The novel won the Costa Book of the Year and the Costa First Novel Award in 2013, with chairman of the judges Rose Tremain saying it was \\"exceptionally moving without being sentimental\\" and \\"astonishingly sure-footed\\" for a first novel.

Early life Astrid M√§rta Hammarberg was born on 6 April 1913 in the village of H√§danberg of Anundsj√∂ parish of V√§sternorrland County, Sweden to Anna Matilda (n√©e Malmstr√∂m) and Axel Hammarberg. Her father worked in forestry and Hammarberg was raised with her two sisters Elsa and Anna Lisa. She earned her high school diploma in 1932 from L√§roverk in Ume√• and then went on to study philosophy at Uppsala University. She studied under , the creator of the new discipline Id√© och l√§rdomshistoria, the history of intellectual ideas. Among her classmates were , Sten Lindroth, and and her early research focused on the history of learning. In 1939, she married the teacher and later school principal, Jonas Gunnar Verner Ekenvall, and the following year completed her dissertation for her licentiate. Ekenvall decided not to continue with a PhD, instead taking several years to raise her two children, Lena Kristina (1942) and Bj√∂rn Axel (1945) and conducting research. When the couple moved from Link√∂ping to Gothenburg, Ekenvall was one of the first two women awarded the Elin W√§gner research grant. Her research focused on the disparity in the treatment of men's and women's intellectual value by Western academia. Career In 1955, Ekenvall began to work as a librarian and in 1957 was hired at the Gothenburg City Library. In 1958, she joined with and Eva Pin√©us, who was chair of the Fredrika Bremer Association in Gothenburg, to set up the Kvinnohistoriskt arkiv (Women's History Archive). The purpose of the private archive was not only to preserve archival materials and maintain a record of current research into women's history, but also to provide a means to publish materials on women's history and issues. Because Ekenvall wanted to maintain the neutrality of the organization and not support political factions, she wrote to women from all walks of life, like and Barbro Alving asking for their support in the drive to create an international research center. When the management of the Gothenburg City Library was transferred from the Gothenburg Municipality to state management as the Gothenburg University Library in 1961, Ekenvall transferred to the new organization and in 1968 was appointed as the head librarian. She continued her own research into women's history and in 1966, published Manligt och kvinnligt: id√©historiska studier. Her study evaluated historic ideas of women by philosophers like Plato, Aristotle, and Thomas Aquinas, positing that their characterizations of women was one of subordinate helper whose purpose in life was to reproduce. Passing through history, these ideas then morphed into social customs treating men and women as opposites. In historic terms, men were subjects and women became objects; men became providers and women became beneficiaries, leading to customs in which men's value as paid laborers restricted women's ability to work outside the home. A \\"pioneering work\\", Manligt och kvinnligt was republished in 1992. In 1972, Ekenvall was awarded an honorary doctorate in philosophy from the University of Gothenburg and that same year, the Kvinnohistoriskt arkiv was transferred to the care of the university, as the Kvinnohistoriska samlingarna (KvinnSam, Women's History Collections). Though she did not take over running the collections, Ekenvall continued her work as chief librarian and researcher at the university library. In 1978, she retired and then having lost her husband in 1975, moved to Stockholm. She continued her interdisciplinary approach to the evaluation of the roles women occupied throughout history, combining anthropology, historical analysis and philosophy to produce both research and textbooks. Some of her best known works from this period include Groddjuren som frukbarhetssymboler (Frogs as Fertility Symbols, 1974), which explored similarities in cultural views of fertility throughout history, and Batrachians som symboler f√∂r liv, d√∂d och kvinna (1978). Ekenvall was an important player in the Swedish women's movement of the late 1970s and 1980s. Though she was committed to social involvement, Ekenvall drew a line between her activities in the women's movement and her research activities. In part, this was due to her recognition that to gain respect in the male-dominated academic world, research about women had to rely on a wide range of many different disciplines producing secure scientific results or they would be undervalued and dismissed. In 1982, she participated in the interdisciplinary women's university conference hosted in Ume√• with around 200 of the most prominent women researchers of the era. Ekenvall was honored as a ' (Named professor) by the Swedish government in 1996. Death and legacy Ekenvall died on 12 December 2001 in Sp√•nga-Kista Parish in Stockholm, Sweden. She was buried at the in Gothenburg. In 2003, when her obituary was included as part of the Eulogies from 2001 to 2003 of Gothenburg University intelligentsia, Eva-Lena Dahl credited Ekenvall and the women's archive as the foundation of the scholarly reputation of gender research held by the university library. In 2018, during the celebrations for the 60th anniversary of the KvinnSam, the successor organization to the archive begun by Ekenvall, Malmstr√∂m, and Pin√©us, their pivotal role in preserving women's history in Sweden was honored.

As a child he joined in family shows put on by his sisters. He made his first stage appearance aged five, wrote his first songs aged 13, and then organised his own vaudeville-style group, the Merry Makers, who toured in Suriname. He made his first radio broadcasts in 1929, and also incorporated comedy and magic into his stage act. In the late 1920s, he developed the concept of \\"shanto\\" music, which he described as \\"an improvisation of words and music with an Afro-West Indian beat, with satirical comments on people, events and things...\\".

A new dining and recreation hall were added in 1889, an extension to the female wing was added in 1897 and a corresponding extension to the male wing was added in 1898. It became Burntwood Mental Hospital in the 1920s and it saw the creation of an Emergency Medical Services hutted hospital to west of the main building during the Second World War before joining the National Health Service as St Matthew's Hospital in 1948. After the introduction of Care in the Community in the early 1980s, the hospital went into a period of decline and closed in March 1995. Although most of the buildings were demolished, the administration building was subsequently converted into apartments and the chapel became a children's nursery.

It grew out of the hashtag #ADOS created by Yvette Carnell and Antonio Moore. ADOS have made reparations for the system of slavery in the United States a key tenet of their platform. They want colleges, employers and the federal government to prioritize African Americans who descended from American slaves, and they argue that affirmative action policies originally designed to help the descendants of slavery in America have largely been used to benefit other groups. The American descendants of slavery, they say, should have their own racial category on census forms and college applications, and not be lumped in with others with similar skin color but different historical experiences. One of its founders, Carnell, was a board member of \\"Progressives for Immigration Reform\\", described by the Southern Poverty Law Center as an anti-immigration group. The other founder Antonio Moore wrote on liberal think tank Institute for Policy Studies site Inequality.org on economics and race for several years.  History  Members of American Descendants of Slavery (ADOS) are descendants of enslaved Africans, their captors (European slavers), and the original inhabitants of the North American continent during the time of chattel slavery and the Atlantic slave trade. They are descendants of at least one ancestor who was forced into slavery within the established colonies in North America during the time of chattel slavery. The term \\"descendants of slavery\\" was originally coined by Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. during the Civil Rights era in the United States of America. The addition of 'American' within the term is used to establish specificity (as there are other countries that also used the forced labor of enslaved people to develop their nation). \\"American Descendants of Slavery\\" refers specifically to the descendants of the enslaved people held in captivity in North America during the initial establishment of the United States (from the colonial era onward). ADOS cannot trace their ancestral roots to any specific country or tribe on the continent of Africa. Their African ancestors were sold into human trafficking (slavery) by African traders on the continent who made a profit from selling their enemies and other unfortunate people to European traffickers (slavers).  The ADOS political movement  The movement intends to correct the view of outsiders by using statistical and historical data and evidence to speak to the reality of modern life for ADOS (formally referred to as African Americans), whose lives have been impacted heavily by social and economic struggles created by chattel slavery, segregation and Jim Crow, the practice of Red Lining, convict leasing, mass incarceration, and discrimination still found in various forms within the structure of the American political and economic system today. The group continues the legacy of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. with the continued fight for social and economic justice as it demands reparative justice and the opportunities they have historically been denied within America. As ADOS explains on its policy page, the group key objective is for reparations for the descendants of slaves who were held in captivity in the United States as well as a larger Black agenda that demands a \\"New Deal for Black America.\\" This agenda includes but not limited to lineage- specific set-asides for American descendants of chattel slavery, restoration of the protections of the Voting Rights Act, a minimum of 15 percent of Small Business Association (SBA) loans be distributed ADOS businesses, a multi- billion dollar infrastructure plan targeted to ADOS communities along with financial compensation for benign neglect of those communities by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and federal government, comprehensive prison reform and rehabilitation, a refocused oversight and enforcement for ADOS economic inclusion from American banks, and ADOS college debt forgiveness and health care coverage. Supporters of ADOS push the issue on social media with the hashtag #ADOS. As a movement #ADOS draws value from the use of social media, and sets out to shift the dialogue around the identity of what it is to be African American in an effort to move the discussion from melanin\\" to the lineage of an American population whose ancestors built the wealth of the United States.  Founders of the ADOS Political Movement  The American Descendants of Slavery movement was founded by Yvette Carnell and Antonio Moore. Carnell runs a weekly political show called \\"BreakingBrown\\" and has been an aide for two Democratic politicians, Senator Barbara Boxer and Congressman Robert Marion Berry. Moore has been a writer for the progressive think tank the Institute for Policy Studies and for the Huffington Post. He was also the producer of the investigative documentary 'Freeway Crack in The System' which was nominated for an Emmy for Outstanding Investigative Journalism: Long Form.

The mountain is officially named Pinnacle Peak on maps, but hardly anyone calls it by that name.Pinnacle Peak Rhinoclimbs.com The nearest higher peak is Mount Degenhardt, to the northeast. The Chopping Block can be seen from the North Cascades National Park Newhalem visitor center, weather permitting. Precipitation runoff from the peak drains into Goodell Creek, a tributary of the Skagit River. Climate The Chopping Block is located in the marine west coast climate zone of western North America.Beckey, Fred W. Cascade Alpine Guide, Climbing and High Routes. Seattle, WA: Mountaineers Books, 2008. Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel northeast toward the Cascade Mountains. As fronts approach the North Cascades, they are forced upward by the peaks of the Cascade Range, causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall onto the Cascades (Orographic lift). As a result, the west side of the North Cascades experiences high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall. During winter months, weather is usually cloudy, but, due to high pressure systems over the Pacific Ocean that intensify during summer months, there is often little or no cloud cover during the summer. Because of maritime influence, snow tends to be wet and heavy, resulting in high avalanche danger. Geology The North Cascades features some of the most rugged topography in the Cascade Range with craggy peaks, spires, ridges, and deep glacial valleys. Geological events occurring many years ago created the diverse topography and drastic elevation changes over the Cascade Range leading to the various climate differences. The history of the formation of the Cascade Mountains dates back millions of years ago to the late Eocene Epoch. With the North American Plate overriding the Pacific Plate, episodes of volcanic igneous activity persisted. In addition, small fragments of the oceanic and continental lithosphere called terranes created the North Cascades about 50 million years ago. During the Pleistocene period dating back over two million years ago, glaciation advancing and retreating repeatedly scoured the landscape leaving deposits of rock debris. The \\"U\\"-shaped cross section of the river valleys are a result of recent glaciation. Uplift and faulting in combination with glaciation have been the dominant processes which have created the tall peaks and deep valleys of the North Cascades area.

History  The orchestra was founded in 1925 by flutist Adeline Schmidt, cellist Lois Bichl, and clarinetist Lillian Poenisch. Like most industries of the era, women were barred from participating in most professional orchestras throughout the mid-20th century. Nonetheless, in 1924, a year before the Woman's Symphony Orchestra of this article was founded, another one with nearly the same name was founded by Elena Moneak, which lasted until 1928. (see Disambiguation section, below) Schmidt, Bichl, and Poenisch felt that Moneak's orchestra lacked professionalism from vocational, performance quality, and business management perspectives and aspired to create one. Initially, their overarching organizational objective was to offer professional performing experiences for women artists, which soon included women composers and conductors. The orchestra premiered notable works of women composers and showcased the artistry of several acclaimed women conductors. Among other things, the orchestra launched a scholarship program aimed at developing more opportunities for female professional orchestral brass and woodwind musicians. = Demise of the orchestra = There is some debate about the end of the orchestra. Some music historians have noted the end of the orchestra as dating to its bankruptcy in 1948. However a photo of the orchestra exists dated 1952. The bankruptcy of the Woman's Symphony Orchestra of Chicago is generally known to have been the result of systemic changes following the World War II rather than a simple lack of demand for all-female orchestras. As men in the U.S. were drafted in great numbers, often not returning, this resulted in a great demand in previously all-male professional orchestras to recruit female musicians from all female orchestras.

Subsequently the expression was taken seriously by Olavo de Carvalho and by Brazilian right-wingers, resurfacing on YouTube and other media as a conspiracy theory related to a supposed Latin American integration plan propagated by the S√£o Paulo Forum. In 2018 the Brazilian federal deputy and presidential candidate, Cabo Daciolo, spoke of URSAL as a conspiracy to end national sovereignties on the continent. Daciolo referred to URSAL when he questioned Ciro Gomes during the first debate among candidates of the 2018 Brazilian presidential election. Daciolo said URSAL would be a federation of Latin American and Caribbean countries with characteristics of a large block of socialist republics.

The novel details the experiences of a fourteen-year-old boy surviving a severe case of meningitis and waking up from a coma to find his whole world transformed. Luke Patterson developed an extreme and fictional form of synesthesia and must decide between what is good and evil, all while fighting the temptation of a dangerous power.  Plot  Luke is a fourteen- year-old boy who wakes from a coma to discover that the evil and disturbing presence named \\"Dreeg\\" has taken up residence in his head. Dreeg causes visual and auditory hallucinations, some of which are symptomatic of synesthesia. Ashamed and frightened, Luke doesn't tell his family about Dreeg or the synesthesia, leading his family and doctors to believe that he made a full recovery. In the following days, however, Luke develops a limp that resigns him to a wheelchair. Upon returning home, Luke has malicious thoughts towards his older sister Laura and is convinced by Dreeg that he can manipulate reality however he wants. Encouraged by Dreeg to begin running, Luke discovers that he can fly. He also finds that he can control minds and that there were rules to his power. First, Luke had to practice and, secondly, he needed Dreeg. With the help of Dreeg's coaching, Luke conjured up a deaf girl he calls Seraphina, showing him the extents of his power. His enjoyment over his powers comes to an end when a creative writing assignment results in one student's face becoming morphed and deformed when the teacher reads Luke's story aloud. A figure also appears outside of the class window. After the students rush to the window Luke denies that anything occurred, returning everything to normal and causing him to realize that his power came with repercussions. As the novel progresses Luke begins to lose control of his mind to Dreeg and his malicious thoughts towards his sister Laura increase to the point that Luke dreams of her death. Luke wants to give up his powers but is convinced otherwise by Dreeg, leaving Luke at his mercy. The book culminates with the disappearance of Laura in the local woods. Together with his best friend Tom, Seraphina, and his dog, Luke goes to rescue Laura and manages to successfully defeat Dreeg, but at the cost of a portion of his mind and the loss of Seraphina. During the fight the woods catches on fire, however the group is rescued by paramedics and rushed to the hospital. Now left without memories of his powers, Seraphina, and many of the events from the book, Luke comes to terms with both his synesthesia and the missing pieces of his mind while staying with his grandfather.  Reception  Critical reception has been positive. Many of the reviews praised the work as a good literary debut for Morgan and The Sunday Telegraph noted that it was \\"oddly brilliant\\". In a review for The Independent, Nicholas Tucker stated that Mondays Are Red was \\"a novel to brood over\\".

In 2018, she was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Canada. Through the university, Giles helped launch the Borderless Higher Education for Refugees (BHER) project which allowed people in refugee camps to earn a York University Certificate of Completion in Educational Studies. Early life and education Although she was born in Iran, Giles holds both UK and Canadian citizenship. After earning her Bachelor of Arts at Santa Clara University in 1971, Giles earned her Master's degree and PhD in Anthropology at the University of Toronto. Her dissertation was titled \\"Motherhood and Wage Labour in London: Portuguese Migrant Women and the Politics of Gender.\\" Career After moving to York University in Toronto, Ontario, Canada as a professor, Giles began working in York's Centre for Refugee Studies and Anthropology Department. In 1993, Giles coordinated the Women in Conflict Zones Research Network with the Centre for Refugee Studies and subsequently published \\"Maid in the Market: Women's Paid Domestic Labour\\" the following year. She worked as coordinator of the Women in Conflict Zones Research Network until 2004. That same year, she published a book titled \\"Sites of Violence: Gender and Conflict Zones.\\" The book is composed of essays using a feminist lens to understand how conflict and war were gendered and racialized. From 2005 to 2008, Giles was a principal investigator for a Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council (SSHRC) funded project titled \\"The Globalization of Homelessness in Long-Term Refugee Camps.\\" She then began a six-year investigation into \\"'A Canadian Refugee Research Network: Globalizing Knowledge.\\" Giles and fellow York professor Jennifer Hyndman began a project titled \\"The Globalization of Protracted Refugee Situations\\" (GPRS) initiative. The goal of this initiative was to help ease those in long-term refugee situations. After consulting the results of the GPRS, Giles began constructing the Borderless Higher Education for Refugees (BHER) project with Don Dippo in 2013 through the Centre for Refugee Studies at York University. In February 2013, the Canadian International Development Agency granted them more than $4.5 million over a five year period to help launch BHER. The following month, Giles was recognized by York University as a research leader at the 2013 Research Gala. In 2015, with the assistance of Don Dippo and York's Centre for Refugee Studies, Giles helped launch the Borderless Higher Education for Refugees (BHER) project. In October 2015, 59 people in a Dadaab refugee camp earned a York University Certificate of Completion in Educational Studies. In 2016, Giles co-authored a book with Jennifer Hyndman titled \\"Refugees in Extended Exile: Living on the Edge.\\" The book was critical of contemporary humanitarian aid efforts and the vulnerable status of refugees. Besides refugees, Giles has also focused her research on the lives of Canadian Portuguese women. In 2017, she donated her research conducted in the 1980s to the Clara Thomas Archives and Special Collections at the York University Libraries.

Smith backed Peel; the anti-Peel faction in response studded the message \\"No Peel\\" into a door below the college's Great Hall.

More than of rhyodacite magma exploded from a shallow magma chamber and filled the caldera and surrounding valleys with ignimbrite. Subsequent glacial erosion removed most of the tephra fallout near the source of the eruption, leaving behind a thick tephra deposit preserved south of the caldera. The eruption that created the caldera was comparable in volume to the one that produced Crater Lake in Oregon. Between 1.15 and 0.99 million years ago, dike-fed eruptions produced rhyodacitic lava domes and lava flows inside the caldera.

In the Spring of 1895, Schermerhorn and University President Seth Low, among others, oversaw the college's move from its old site on 49th Street to its current location in Morningside Heights. To outfit the new campus, Low donated a million dollars for the construction of a Library, and Schermerhorn followed with a $300,000 (equivalent to $ today) donation. At the same time, his nephew (and godson), F. Augustus Schermerhorn, offered the Townsend Library of National Records to the University. Schermerhorn Hall, designed by McKim, Mead, and White, to the left of Low Memorial Library (on the Amsterdam Avenue side), along with its twin, Havemeyer Hall, was one of the original buildings on the uptown campus and was devoted to science, with laboratories and lecture rooms for botany, geology and physics.

Founded in 1904, it expanded to over 3,000 patients during the Second World War. After the introduction of Care in the Community in the early 1980s, the hospital went into a period of decline and closed in 1992. History An area to the west of Storthes Hall Mansion, closer to Farnley Tyas, was chosen as a site for a psychiatric hospital in the early 20th century. The facility, which was designed by J. Vickers-Edwards using a compact arrow layout, opened as the Fourth West Riding Pauper Lunatic Asylum in 1904. The facility became known as the Storthes Hall Mental Hospital in 1929 and as the West Riding Mental Hospital in 1939. During the Second World War the patient population swelled to over 3,000 people as the hospital struggled to cope with patients being transferred from hospitals elsewhere as the War Office requisitioned hospitals for to treat injured soldiers. The facility joined the National Health Service as Storthes Hall Hospital in 1948. Storthes Hall Hospital was one of several hospitals investigated in 1967 as a result of the publication of Barbara Robb's book \\"Sans Everything\\". Accusations covered a thirty-two-week period of serious violent assaults with fists or weapons against male patients of all ages, committed by four named male nurses. It was also alleged that it was like Belsen because it was a ‚Äúbrutal, bestial, beastly place‚Äù‚Äîit was a ‚Äúhell-hole‚Äù. However, the same report found none of the allegations against any named or unnamed member of the hospital staff to have been proved. After the introduction of Care in the Community in the early 1980s, the hospital went into a period of decline and closed in 1992. In 2003, Anne Littlewood, a former nurse at the hospital published a book, Storthes Hall Remembered, about her experiences at the hospital.

Lausanne once had a standard steel wheeled tramway network. Its heyday was during the 1930s. The tram service was completely stopped in 1964. Trams returned to Lausanne in 1991. Rolling stock 28 of the old tram preserved at the Blonay Chamby Railway History Unlike many cities of the world, the Lausanne tram system was started directly as electric tram. The first attempts to create a tramway network in Lausanne date back to the period between 1869 and 1872, when a compressed air system was proposed comparable to that used on the Trams in Bern. In 1882, engineer Bergeron proposed the installation of a funicular traction tram (such as the famous San Francisco cable car system ) to connect the station to the city center, with a branch path; the death of the engineer put an end to the project. On December 21, 1894, the engineer Adrien Palaz obtained the federal subsidy for the construction of a tram network, the following year he presented his project on the financial plan and obtained the support of the communal authorities. In August 1895, construction began on the power station to supply electricity to the grid, located between rue Saint- Martin and the medical school. On June 5, 1895, the company that would operate the network was created: the Lausanne Tramway Company (TL), of which Adrien Palaz would be managing director and then director. The network, consisting of six lines and a total length of 7.2 km, was inaugurated on August 29, 1896, and was put into service on 1 September following. It consisted of a circular line around the city center using the \\"Ceintue Pichard\\" and five lines towards the suburbs and the train station in Saint-Fran√ßois: * St. Francis - Georgette - Pully - Lutry (4.2 km ); * Saint-Fran√ßois - School of Medicine - Pont de Chailly (1.4 km ); * Saint-Fran√ßois - Riponne - Pontaise (1.1 km ); * Saint- Fran√ßois - CFF Station; * Saint-Fran√ßois - LEB Station; * Pichard Belt. The network then began a large wave of expansion.Aug. Wohnlich, Les tramways lausannois, in Bulletin technique de la Suisse romande, , Lausanne, 10 janvier 1907, . In 1903, it consisted of ten lines including two suburban, for a total length of 23.287 km, including 5.690 km double track. In 1898, the line between the CFF station, Saint-Fran√ßois, the tunnel and the hospital was opened, then the following year a line serving Chauderon, Mon√©tan and Prilly opened, while the line of Pont de Chailly was extended to La Rosiaz. In 1902, the line of the hospital was extended to La Sallaz, and the following year, four lines were born: * Station (Jura-Simplon) - Ouchy (1.9 km ); * Boulevard de Grancy - Court - Montoie (1.6 km ); * Chauderon - Renens Station (3.8 km ); * Station (Jura-Simplon) - Place de Chauderon (1.1 km ). In 1906, two lines were born: Tunnel - Le Mont - Cugy (9.3 km ) and the \\"Tour de Ville\\" departing from the CFF station by Saint - Fran√ßois, Riponne and Chauderon. The line of Cugy was extended to Montheron the following year. In 1909, the railway station CFF - Riponne - Bel-Air - Bergi√®res opened in turn. On September 30, 1910, the Soci√©t√© des tramways de Lausanne absorbed the deficit of the Jorat regional electric railways (REJ), which operated the Jorat line that connected Lausanne to Moudon and Savigny, opened in 1902; the terminus of this line was occasionally moved downtown.Val√©rie Maire, Le tram du Jorat: entre ville et campagne, in Connexions - Le magazine du TL, , d√©cembre 2013, pp. 10-12 In 1912, the line Saint-Fran√ßois - Port Pully (3.1 km) On October 28, 1913, the only fatal accident occurred in the history of the Lausanne tramway. The brakes of the motor # 67 failed in the descent of Valentin, on the very steep line of the Pontaise, and the convoy hit a house, causing two deaths and two wounded. The convoy was destroyed in the accident. A reorganization took place in the same year with the merger of lines 1 and 5 (line 1), 2 and 4 (line 2) and 9 and 11 (line 11). In 1922 and 1932, the partial services Saint-Fran√ßois - Mousquines and Closelet-√âpinettes were abolished. The network was fully renumbered in 1930 and a direct line Saint-Fran√ßois-Ouchy (4/14) was put into service. Last day of circulation of trams Decline started before the 2nd World War. The network reached its peak in 1933 with 66.2 km of lines and two extensions: Caserne - Parc des Sports (1/11) and Saint-Jean - Bois de Vaux (2/12). But the decline of the network began the year before with the commissioning of a trolleybus line between Ouchy and Lausanne station instead of trams on a section of line 1/11. This line obtained satisfactory results and led the TL to begin the replacement of trams by trolleybuses in 1938, judged to be more adapted to the characteristic relief of the Vaudoise capital composed of steep and numerous slopes, more comfortable, faster and less expensive to manage. In 1938, lines 4/14 and 8/18 were converted into trolleybuses, followed in 1939 by the √âpinettes-Parc des Sports section of line 1/11, lines 2/12, 6/16 and the Grand tour de ville, the line 3/13 then saw its remaining section integrated in line 7/17. World War II interrupted this replacement, causing the trams to be reintroduced on certain lines because of tire shortages (between 1942 and 1946 on the city tour and the line of La Sallaz and between 1944 and 1945 on Sundays and holidays on the line of Pontaise), it resumed at the end of the conflict. Fermented in 1951 line 20 (Place Tunnel-Montheron) and in 1961 sections of St. Francis Prilly and Lutry lines 7 and 9. The line of the Jorat (lines 21 to 23) closed in 1962; 15 and the last line, Renens-Saint-Fran√ßois-Rosiaz composed of the remaining sections of lines 7 and 9, were closed on January 6, 1964, to allow road improvements for the 1964 Swiss National Exhibition. From July 1963, one year before the closing of the last line, the Society of the Lausanne streetcars changed its name and became the public Transports of the region of Lausanne, while retaining the acronym TL ‚Äì a name it carried since then.. Trolleybus service was even started before closure of the tram network. It has been largely replaced by a network of trolleybuses. After closing tram network in '60, people of Lausanne thought the only unfashioned obstacle of smooth city traveling was removed, and the city could move faster than before, but it proved false some years later. Uncontrolled increase of petrol vehicles like bus, taxicab, and motor vehicle started choking the streets of Lausanne. Where other big cities of Switzerland like Basel, Bern, Geneve, Zurich etc. maintained tram, and modernised which caused improvement of city transport, Lausanne suffered from many problems of developing countries, including pollution, traffic jam, increasing population, etc. Increasing population brought urbanization of Lausanne, bringing motor vehicles, which increased air & sound pollution, as well as traffic jams & smog. In 1970s, all these problems started, and by mid-1980s, inhabitants of Lausanne realized that non- control of motor vehicles & closure of trams was a great mistake. Although the trolleybus was a pollution free transportation, maintenance of that system was even higher than trams, because it ran on rubber tyres, which required frequent replacement. A funicular railway, which was later converted to a rack railway, was not sufficient for such a big city like Lausanne, and especially the western Lausanne had very insufficient mass transport. Trolleybus could not cope with the crowds. Many cities around the world like Tunis, Buenos Aires, Pyongyang, Istanbul, etc. also understood that mistake, and like them, Lausanne also planned for return of trams. The transportation in western Lausanne was not sufficient. So, transport authority decided to construct it in western side of the main city in 1991, which is now known as M1. During the 2000s a new project, this time a classic tramway running in the middle of a road, is projected between the same stations as those served by the M1, but along the Lausanne - Geneva line. It will be launched in 2020. =Past= *1896 ‚Äì Electric tram started running from 29 August. *1933 ‚Äì The maximum extension of the network. *1964 ‚Äì The last tram ran on 6 January. *1991 ‚Äì Tram returned as modern system.

NB: In the case of double route numbering (e.g. 7/17) the second was used for the reverse trip. Until 1912, each line was identified by a symbol, as an anchor for that of Ouchy. From this date, they were numbered: 1 for Ouchy, 2 for Montjoie, 3 for Prilly, 4 for Bergi√®res, 5 for Pontaise, 6 for La Sallaz, 7 for La Rosiaz, 8 for the City Tour, 9 for Lutry, 10 for Pully and 11 for Renens. From 1913, the lines of Ouchy and Pontaise merged under the index 1, the lines of Montjoie and Bergi√®res under the index 2 and those of Renens and Lutry merged under the index 11. The line to Cugy and Montheron, unnumbered became the 12th. In June 1930, a double numbering system was set up on the urban lines 10. The first figure concerned the go (ex the 1) and the second the return (ex the 11).

The average curve radius is 20‚Äì25 meters, the lowest was only 14 meters at Lutry, in a narrow 90¬∞ curve. The slopes were like the Lausanne relief ‚Äì steep, with a maximum of 112.7‚Ä∞ on the Riponne- Pontaise line.Aug. Wohnlich, Les tramways lausannois, in Bulletin technique de la Suisse romande, , Lausanne, 10 janvier 1907, p. 3. Most tram routes were on unreserved tracks and middle of the roads. Tramcars were caught in the traffic jams caused by the cars, and single track was the main obstacle for a hassle free service. The tracks were also outdated, noisy and not maintained mostly. Those were some strong reasons of closure of the system. The metro system follows the previous tram route 21, 22 & 23 between Sallaz & Croisettes.

The war ended in March 1792 with the Treaty of Seringapatam, in which Mysore gave up much of its territory. The medal was authorised in April 1793 by Lord Cornwallis, the Governor-General of India, who had commanded HEIC forces in Mysore. It was awarded to native Indian members of the HEIC forces: in gold to more senior native officers including Subedars; in silver to junior officers including Jemadars and Serangs; with NCOs and Sepoys, including Havildars, Naiks, Tindals and Lascars receiving a smaller silver medal. Europeans, including those in HEIC service and with British Army, did not receive the medal. In total, about 7,000 medals were awarded.

Pink began his professional career as a dancer with the London Festival Ballet (now the English National Ballet). After retiring from the stage, Pink went on to choreograph, direct, and teach internationally. During his time in the UK he developed a close partnership with Christopher Gable CBE, Artistic Director of Northern Ballet Theatre; the composer Philip Feeney; and designer Lez Brotherston. Together they would go on to create landmark original works, redefining the genre of dance drama. He became Associate Artistic Director of NBT in 1993, a role which he filled until 1998. As well as the UK and the United States, Pink‚Äôs work has been staged internationally and broadcast by PBS. Pink was also co-founder of Ballet Central, the graduate performing company of the Central School of Ballet, where both he and Feeney created 16 original works. Early life Michael Pink was born in York, England in 1956. His parents worked most of their lives for the chocolate company Rowntree Mackintosh. Music played an important role in his childhood and he was head chorister at St. Olave's Church. This was the same church in which he married ballerina Jayne Regan in 1998. Pink‚Äôs mother, father, and brothers were members of the York Amateur Opera and Dramatic Society, and Pink‚Äôs first role was in Macbeth at the York Theatre Royal. His younger brother Gregory was a theatre electrician who went on to become a sound designer, and his older brother Anthony was a trustee banker and treasurer for the society. Theatre was very much a family affair. He returned in 1975 to choreograph The Englishman Amused, a musical revue, for York Theatre Royal, directed by Jimmy Thompson. Career =Training= Pink was eight years old when he began his training at the Isobel Dunn School of Dance. At the request of Ursula Moreton, he auditioned for the Royal Ballet School in London, where he was accepted with a full scholarship, making him the first boy from York to attend the prestigious school. Here his passion for dance, and choreography in particular, was first noted and encouraged by the legendary founder of Britain‚Äôs Royal Ballet, Dame Ninette de Valois, and the choreographer Sir Frederick Ashton. Pink‚Äôs early creations earned him accolades, including winning the first Ursula Moreton Choreographic Competition. Whilst still a student at RBS he was invited by Sir Frederick Ashton to assist in choreographing the Anacat Fashion Show for HRH Princess Margaret. Upon graduation he attended the inaugural GulbenkianChoreographic Summer Program, led by Glen Tetley, Mary Hicks, and Dame Peggy van Praagh. =London Festival Ballet= In 1975, Pink joined the London Festival Ballet, under the directorship of Dame Beryl Grey. He quickly gained a reputation as an excellent partner, and danced many leading roles with ballerinas; Patricia Ruanne, Eva Evdokimova, Elisabetta Terabust, Lynn Seymour, and most noticeably, Natalia Makarova in John Cranko‚Äôs Onegin. Pink performed in works by Massine, Tetley, Bruce, Hynd, Tudor, Ashton, and Beriosova. His first choreographic work for the company, 1914, was nominated for a West End Theatre Award. He was also a recipient of the Royal Society of Arts Choreographic Award. During this time, Pink also became close friends with Rudolf Nureyev, serving as his r√©p√©titeur at both the Paris Opera, and La Scala Milan. Pink states that this formative time with Nureyev taught him the necessity of finding a balance between work and life, saying ‚Äúhe gave me the confidence to be true to myself as a creative artist.‚Äù =Northern Ballet Theatre= Pink was first commissioned in 1982 by the Arts Council of Great Britain and Northern Ballet Theatre to create Attractions, in collaboration with composer Michael Berkley. His 1987 production of Memoire Imaginaire was filmed for HTV International‚Äôs \\"Time to Dance\\". In 1988 he choreographed his first full length production, The Amazing Adventures of Don Quixote. In 1989 he created Strange Meeting, a one act ballet based on the poems of Wilfred Owen, with music by Philip Feeney and design by Lez Brotherston. Pink joined NBT as associate artistic director in 1993, where he remained until 1998. During this time he created The Hunchback of Notre Dame, Swan Lake, Giselle, and his most popular and critically acclaimed ballet, Dracula. =Milwaukee Ballet= Pink assumed the role of Artistic Director of the Milwaukee Ballet in December 2002. In his time as AD he has successfully nurtured partnerships with other arts groups and educational institutions including UW-Milwaukee and the Medical College of Wisconsin. Under his direction, the Milwaukee Ballet school and MBII program gained accreditation from the National Association of Dance; both are now attracting dancers from around the world. Romeo and Juliet was broadcast by MPTV in 2007. In 2013 his acclaimed production of Peter Pan was screened nationally on PBS‚Äôs \\"Great Performances\\". He has continued to create original work for Milwaukee Ballet with his longtime collaborator Philip Feeney, and lighting designer David Grill. Personal life Pink married Northern Ballet Theatre Principal Artist Jayne Regan in 1998. Together they have two children, Max (born 2000), and Georgina (born 2002), both actors and singers.

Biography William Willis studied physics at Yale University, where he received his bachelor's degree in 1954 and his PhD in 1958 with advisor Earle Fowler and dissertation related to the development of hydrogen bubble chambers in Ralph P. Shutt's research group. Willis was a postdoc at Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL), where he observed weak decays of kaons and hyperons in bubble chambers. In 1961/62 he was at CERN, where he was involved in experiments on weak decays of hyperons, which confirmed the Cabibbo theory of weak interaction. In 1964 Willis joined the faculty of Yale University. From 1973 to 1991, he was at CERN, where he undertook experiments at the ISR, developing novel detector concepts. He was essential for the development of the ISR's Axial Field Spectrometer, which detected the first high-pt jet events in hadronic collisions. The approach used in the Axial Field Spectrometer became standard for hadron colliders.obituary at CERN In 1991 Willis became the Eugene Higgins Professor of Physics at Columbia University. Following the failure to fund the Superconducting Super Collider, he sought ways to involve US physicists in CERN's LHC plans, and was a member of the first US delegation to CERN in 1993. In the 2000s he was (until 2005) Project Manager in the US Department of ATLAS Collaboration at CERN's LHC. From 1994 to 2010 he was Assistant Director of the BNL. Among other things, he supported the construction of the RHIC, which went into operation in 2000, and led the technical committee for the RHIC in the 1980s. More recently, he contributed his expertise in liquid argon detectors to the planning of neutrino experiments at Fermilab's (MicroBooNE experiment). He was a Fellow of the American Physical Society and in 2003 received the Panofsky Prize for \\"his leading role in the development and exploitation of innovative techniques now widely adopted in particle physics, including liquid argon calorimetry, electron identification by detection of transition radiation, and hyperon beams.\\" In 1993 he was elected a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.

In 1995, the TACOM UAV was conceived as a platform to test and evaluate the technologies needed for an air-launched UAV for the Japan Air Self-Defense Force (JASDF). Although it was not designed for any specific mission, some missions that the TACOM could potentially undertake included intelligence, surveillance, target acquisition, reconnaissance, electronic warfare, decoy and aerial target.  Development  Technical Research and Development Institute (TRDI) initiated the TACOM program in 1995 to study the feasibility of an air-launched multi-role UAV system based on the JASDF requirements during the time. FHI was awarded the contract that same year. Between 1995 and 1998, FHI designed and manufactured six UAVs, ground control station (GCS), Ground support equipment (GSE), and the conversion kits for the F-4EJ to carry and command the UAV (with assistance from Mitsubishi Heavy Industries). Ground and flight tests were conducted between 1997 and 2001 by the TRDI and JASDF. The ground tests conducted included mechanical and electrical checks, ground vibration, and recovery tests. The flight tests that were conducted focused on the UAV's compatibility with the F-4EJ, captive flight test, and the evaluation of its four key technologies; high-speed stealthy configuration, wing expansion, GPS/ADS hybrid navigation, and autonomous target tracking. On May 7, 1999, the TACOM UAV carried out its first fully autonomous flight. The program ended in 2001 with a total of 22 F-4EJ flights and five independent flights. In 2004, another UAV program, called the \\"Unmanned Aerial Research System\\", was initiated based on experience obtained from the previous project. The program was conducted between 2004 and 2011, with a total of 10.3 billion yen invested into the program. The follow-on program further emphasized the drone's autonomous flight, guidance technology to fly and land autonomously, data transmission, and video technology to capture high resolution images and videos. As a result, the drone has been enlarged and slightly modified in order to conduct the research. One such modification includes being compatible with its new mother ship, the F-15J. Captive flight tests were conducted from Gifu Air Field to designated areas off the coast of Japan. The autonomous flight tests were conducted from Iwo Jima.  Design  The TACOM UAV is designed as a high-speed, low observable air launched drone. The drone possesses a foldable, delta wing design, a single air intake above the fuselage, and a single turbofan engine. Due to its small folding wings the UAV is controlled only by its stabilizers and features ventral fins for lateral and directional stability. Some designs to reduce its radar cross section (RCS) include a curve intake S-duct and its small number of edge orientation. The dimensions of the drone were designed so that it can be carried by an F-4EJ. Avionics include a Mission Management Computer (MMC) and IR sensor mounted in the forward section of the fuselage, and two data link antennas located in the nose and rear (above the engine) of the drone. The drone features air bags and a parachute to decelerate and ensure a safe landing. Following its second program the drone has been enlarged and modified, but overall retains much of its general characteristics. Some modifications includes the addition of an traffic collision avoidance system, an Air Traffic Control transponder, camera and senors housed underneath the fuselage, and the compatibility with an F-15J.

The terminus lay by the entrance to the Robert Bruce School site on what is now Bedford Road. The entrance to the Robert Bruce School site, as it appeared in April 2019. The southern terminus of the Kempston gravel railway is likely to have been to the left of the row of trees. The gravel pit lay on the banks of the River Great Ouse. The tramway is shown on sheet 84 of the Ordnance Survey Popular Edition Map, which was surveyed between 1912 and 1923 and first published in 1919. According to this map, the track was about long and ended in the area where Mahew Court now stands on Emmerton Road. Trains consisting of three or four trucks were pulled by horses to the road where the gravel was transferred to road vehicles for onward transport.http://kempstonlocalhistorysociety.org/did-you-know/narrow- gauge-railway/ Along the length of the left-hand side of the line lay Hill Grounds, 'a lovely wooded copse, full of wild flowers going down to the river'. For much of its length, the tramway shared the same route as the road which provided access to Hill Grounds. There is some evidence that this street running was the cause of at least one accident in July 1907: Hill Grounds and the area containing the gravel pit were owned in the 1800s by Reverend Edmund Williamson of Kempston Manor.https://issuu.com/rosettapublishing/docs/kempston_calling_march_2019/8 Ownership later passed to Mrs Anne Charles-Williamson, one of Reverend Williamson's daughters.https://issuu.com/rosettapublishing/docs/kempston_calling_march_2019/8http://kempstonlocalhistorysociety.org/memories- of-kempston/85-years-of-kempston/ By this time, the Hill Grounds pit was being worked by Mr William Folkes.http://kempstonlocalhistorysociety.org/memories- of-kempston/85-years-of-kempston/ The Folkes family lived at 'Stoneyside', a large cottage close to the line's southern terminus. Stoneyside's outbuildings included stabling for two horses, so it is possible that these housed the animals used to pull the trucks. Detail from the Ordnance Survey Popular Edition Sheet 84 (first published 1919), showing the tramway and the surrounding area. After the death of Mrs Anne Charles-Williamson in 1927, the Kempston Manor estate was divided up for sale. The auction brochure confirms that the tramway was still in place, and that it ran over several of the advertised lots. The brochure also states that 'the tram lines and sleepers on this Roadway and on Lot 23 are the property of Mrs Folkes and will not be included in the Sale'. Mrs Folkes, who had taken over running the gravel pit following the death of her husband bid successfully on Stoneyside and the Hill Grounds wood. These purchases clearly went down well with many of those present at the auction, who applauded as the sales were completed. The Hill Grounds gravel pit had begun operation in the 1860s and was finally worked out by the mid-twentieth century. The area subsequently became a small residential caravan site.https://issuu.com/rosettapublishing/docs/kempston_calling_march_2019/8 The growth of the area of Kempston formerly known as 'Up End' is thought to be due largely to the employment opportunities presented by the gravel pits in this area, including that at Hill Grounds. Such was the importance of this industry that the area around Bunyan Road was known as 'Gravel End' by 1877. Narrow gauge railways are known to have served at least two other gravel pits in the area nearby. Short gauge railways operated at Biddenham Gravel Pithttps://www.irsociety.co.uk/Archives/17/Beds_1.htm and Radwell Gravel Pit, near Milton Ernest.https://www.irsociety.co.uk/Archives/22/Beds_3.htm The former appears to have been operating around the same time that the Kempston line ran. The latter was a latter development, associated with quarrying to support the second world war effort. It is unclear whether the Kempston tramway was also gauge. Little today remains of the Kempston tramway, beyond‚Äîperhaps‚Äîa short section of embanked roadbed/trackbed at the southerly end of the line. Stoneyside and its outbuildings still stand.

By this time he was well known for his work with the deaf and hard of hearing. He developed and taught the first sign language course at York College, was a member of the International Registry of Interpreters for the Deaf, and arranged for tours for the Deaf and Hard of Hearing at the Historical Society of York County.\\"Historical Society: Museum Tours for the Deaf\\", York Daily Record (York, Pennsylvania), 02 Mar 1977 Sheets worked as the publicity director at York College from 1975 to 1980. Sheets resigned from York College in 1980 in order to research and write his first book, To the Setting of the Sun: The Story of York, which was published in 1981 with a Foreword by Pennsylvania Governor Dick Thornburgh. Setting sold out of its first printing of 6,000 copies in a month and was immediately submitted for a second printing. The photo editor of the book was Jerry Sweitzer, who was also responsible for the \\"Partners in progress\\" section at the back of the book, where members of the York Chamber of Commerce agreed to pay to have their history included. The book was sponsored by the Historical Society of York as well as the Chamber of Commerce. It was printed on P.H. Glatfelter paper at Maple Press, in York. It is 8 1/2 inches by 11 1/2 inches and three quarters of an inch thick. Illustrations include watercolors, pen and ink drawings, photographs, engravings, newspaper clippings, and signs, with a section of color plates in addition to black and white illustrations throughout. A revised and updated edition was put out in November 2002 by the American Historical Press under the title York County: To the Setting of the Sun : An Illustrated History ( ). During his research for Setting, Sheets learned of the national historical importance of William C. Goodridge. His editor in California put him in touch with historian John Jezierski, of Saginaw, Michigan; Some of Sheets' research was contributory to Jezierski's substantial work on Goodridge photography, called Enterprising Images: The Goodridge Brothers, African American Photographers, 1847‚Äì1922. Sheets spent much of the next ten years researching the Goodridge Family, including two interviews with Emily O. Goodridge's great-granddaughter Catherine Grey Hurley.Transcript, \\"Interview with Catherine G. Hurley at her home\\", 4 May 1984, York County Historical Society archives. Sheets' research resulted in a small booklet published by The Library Shop at Martin Library with financial support from the Glatfelter Insurance Company, in June 1990.A Brief History of the Goodridge Family in York, Pennsylvania, by Georg R. Sheets (June, 1990). Published by the Library Shop at Martin Library, York, PA. According to the \\"About the Author\\" section of that booklet, Sheets wrote magazine and newspaper articles as a freelance writer on an ongoing basis, including pieces in The Philadelphia Inquirer, the Baltimore Sunday Sun, the Deaf American Magazine, and Firehouse Magazine. During that same time, Sheets was hired by the Agricultural and Industrial Museum of York County to compose a survey of the Agricultural and Industrial Heritage of York County. Made in York was a hefty volume that continues to be recommended for those who are interested in the industrial history of the area. Georg Sheets was curator of the John Harris/Simon Cameron Mansion Museum and Galleries of the Historical Society of Dauphin County in the 1990s. During his time there, they presented an exhibit called \\"Simon Cameron: In the Eye of the Civil War\\" which presented personal effects, including letters, of the former Senator from Pennsylvania and Lincoln's Ambassador to Russia. In 2000, he contributed the historical portion to The Grand Review: The Civil War Continues to Shape America, a book on the glorious two-day parade in Washington, D.C. that marked the end of the Civil War, May 23 & 24, 1865. The softcover book has about 140 illustrations over 132 pages and was published by Bold Print, Inc. of York, PA. It was nominated for the Pulitzer prize. In 2002, the Pennsylvania Capitol Preservation Committee turned to Sheets to document the work of artist Violet Oakley at the Pennsylvania State Capitol in Harrisburg. Similarly, at other times, Asbury United (First) Methodist Church, the York County Bar Association, and PeoplesBank hired him to put their organizational histories into book form. Later in life, Sheets was hired by the York County Library System as their Planned Giving Officer to support institutional development. He has also edited a complementary regional guide to art, culture, heritage, tourism and literacy called Showcase Now! Magazine for several years. =Community service= York County historians Georg R. Sheets and Terrence \\"Dutchie\\" Downs stand by the historical marker in front of the Goodridge Freedom Center in York PA. The site is the historical home of William C.

Sheets served as President and then Past President of the York Twinning Association, which connects residents of York to residents of its sister cities Arles, France (since 1954) and Leinfelden- Echterdingen, Germany (since 1981). He was also a Board Member of the York Little Theater, the Strand-Capital Performing Arts Center, and the York Cerebral Palsy Home. Sheets further served as the Vice President of both the York County Council for the Deaf and Hard of Hearing and the York Arts Council, in the 1970s.\\"Georg Sheets Named Membership Chairman for YLT\\", York Daily Record (York, Pennsylvania) ¬∑ 20 Mar 1975\\"Arts Council Expanding\\" York Daily Record (York, Pennsylvania) ¬∑ 05 Aug 1975 In 1982 he was co-chair, with Annette Guilfoyle, of the Victorian Heritage Festival.

Percy William Charlton Wise (15 January 1870 ‚Äì 13 August 1950), commonly referred to as Canon Wise, was an Anglican priest in South Australia. He was the subject of controversy for introducing Catholic rites and observances into the Church of St George the Martyr, Goodwood, where he officiated for 40 years. History Wise was born at Stoke Damerel, in Plymouth, Devonshire, a son of David Woodifield Wise and his wife Harriet Blanche Wise, n√©e Sheppard. Percy was educated at Clewer House School and Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, where he graduated BA in 1893, and where his circle of friends included the architect Thomas Henry Lyon, John Cowper Powys and John Harmer, later Bishop of Adelaide. He undertook religious training at the Clergy Training School in Cambridge, was made deacon in 1893, ordained as a priest in 1894 and posted as a curate to Oundle, Northamptonshire. This reference has the school's foundation, erroneously, around 1912 In 1895 he accepted the offer of a curacy at Christ Church, North Adelaide, married Carrie Lyon, sister of his friend the architect, and boarded a ship bound for South Australia. For two years he served there and as acting chaplain to Bishop Harmer. By November he was preaching at St Augustine's Church, Unley and St Peter's Cathedral. In 1897 Wise was appointed to the Church Of The Epiphany, Crafers, where his energy and infectious enthusiasm breathed new life into the congregation. The church debt was paid off, and a parish room built on church grounds. He was acclaimed as a fine orator and inspiring preacher. In April 1900 Wise and his wife left for England. She died en route in Manila; her remains would not be interred for another five years. He spent three months working with a Corpus Christi College charity in South London and the remainder in Asia and North America essentially as a tourist. He returned in December to take charge of the Goodwood area which encompassed West Adelaide and Thebarton. The church's previous incumbent was W. S. Moore (12 July 1830 ‚Äì 17 July 1901), better known as a long-serving principal of the Pulteney Street School. The original church building (later to become a schoolroom) was, Wise later recalled, a squalid affair with a declining congregation. Assisted by a promise of ¬£1,000 from a wealthy parishioner, a foundation stone was laid by Archbishop Saumarez Smith on 27 September 1902 and the grand new edifice was built to the design of brother-in-law T. H. Lyon by Walter C. Torode and consecrated 1 September 1903. Among its many features included a tiled roof, and a lady chapel, a \\"first\\" for an Anglican church in South Australia. The west window was designed by Charles Edward Tute (1858 ‚Äì 4 November 1927) who later settled in Brisbane and designed bookplates for both Wise and Sir Samuel Way. His confidence was well-founded. The church was full to overflowing every week, and to parishioners who objected to the sumptuousness and ritual of the new order, Bishop Harmer advised \\"go to St Luke's or St Augustine's,\\" but not to bother their rector. Later bishops would not be as complaisant. Wise had been given an additional appointment as special preacher for St Peter's Cathedral in 1901. He relinquished this in 1904 to concentrate on his work at St George's, Goodwood. A year later he left Adelaide for ten months' holiday in Britain and the \\"Holy Land\\"; an elaborate farewell, rivalling that of accorded to church dignitaries on their retirement (including the traditional \\"purse of sovereigns\\") was given him by Bishop Harmer and a large assembly. Wise instituted a \\"Guild of St Mary of Bethany\\" to make all the vestments and banners and a \\"Guild of St George\\" incorporating four \\"wards\\", to supply the church with workers: *Ward of St Michael for men, performing gardening and general maintenance *Ward of St Albyn for boys, to supply the church with altar servers *Ward of St Agnes for girls, forming a supplementary choir *Ward of Our Lady for women, who organised refreshments at social functions In 1906 he began a Bible class for primary-school children, held at St George's Church for half an hour before school, three or four days a week. On 1 June 1907 the foundation stone was laid for a new rectory, designed by Lyon in the style of an old English cottage (after Voysey ?), and consecrated that September. In 1908, following the resignation of Canon Tucker, Wise was offered the benefice of Christ Church, South Yarra, Melbourne, a handsome church in a genteel and affluent area, but declined to nominate. His parishioners recognised his self- denial with a generous gift of money, which he put towards additional stained glass windows. However, one commentator reckoned he found himself into a position where he could not accept without appearing to have lied. In 1910 Wise proved himself a popular and successful preacher at St James' Church, Sydney which was looking for a new priest, no offer was made by their Synod, for reasons not stated, but it may have been due to his High Church leanings, which were never in doubt. He had another material display of affection on his tenth anniversary at St George's. On this occasion he was presented with a revolving chair, a Cutler roll-top desk and a purse of sovereigns. In 1917 Wise established a free day school in a separate building, funded by parishioners. A handsome publication \\"Souvenir of St George's\\". in aid of the school, was brought out in 1918. The school officially closed in 1944. A soldiers' memorial, also designed by Lyon, was unveiled in front of the church on 11 November 1923. It commemorated the 130 men from the church and neighbourhood who lost their lives in the Great War. ;Anglo-Catholicism Wise was a member of CBS, an Anglican movement dedicated to adopting or restoring features of Catholicism into Anglican liturgy, influenced by the Oxford Movement. Bishop Harmer, Canon Poole and archdeacons Hornabrook and Bussell have also been named as sympathetic to what is often referred to as \\"High Church\\" or \\"Ritualism\\". In these practices Wise was at odds with Harmer's replacement, Bishop A. Nutter Thomas. *He introduced to services the alb and chasuble and other vestments, one being a 400-year-old rose silk cope from a Spanish cathedral. *In 1906 he was criticised by Bishop Thomas for the use of the censer and burning incense in services. *He used candles is services and installed a light to signify the presence of the Host on the High Altar. *He promoted auricular confession, claiming the authority to proclaim forgiveness of sins which was bestowed by God on priests as part of the gift of ordination. *He observed Requiem Mass on All Souls' Day (2 November) and celebrated Corpus Christi with candles. *He taught the doctrine of Transubstantiation and the Real presence of Christ in the Eucharist. *He asked of his parishioners that they address him as \\"Father\\" or \\"Reverend Father\\". *In 1918 he published a \\"Mass Book for Lay Folk\\" dictating the forms of Mass to be observed in St George's Church, which closely followed the Roman model, down to the Benediction, Veneration of the Cross and Mass of the Presanctified. The newspaper correspondence between Bishop Thomas and Canon Wise following this publication was decidedly cool. These observances or appropriations, which the Roman Catholic church looked on with disfavour, were condoned or even encouraged by Bishop Harmer but his successor Bishop Thomas was torn: > This divine has the reputation of \\"building a church wherever he goes\\" and > has \\"brought much money into the church\\" ‚Äî two cogent reasons for being made > a big gun in the Cathedral. But besides this he has abilities which would > have placed him in front rank in any sphere of life. To untiring energy and > prodigious enthusiasm he adds great tact and an astuteness far ahead of most > of the wearers of the cloth. He is eminently practical in all things. And he > always has an overcrowded church! When a clergyman has a full church there > is no need to mention any other of his qualities. St George's, Goodwood, > from being a church of small dimensions, with a congregation content to > merely exist, is now a proud edifice with a very live congregation. Here > incense is regularly used, and the congregation confess to the priest ! > Whether this is strictly in keeping with the laws of \\"the dear old church\\" > signifies little. Canon Wise is a strong man, and he is prepared to take the > responsibility. In 1920 Bishop Thomas sued Wise in the Ecclesiastical Courts for \\"breach of ritual\\", but after several years abandoned the case. Though \\"defending himself ably\\" Wise is said to have contracted ¬£500 in legal costs. It is not certain that an Ecclesiasical Court was ever convened, and the only court at which Wise appeared may have been that of public opinion and in the Press, where he undoubtedly had the upper hand. The Southern Cross, a Catholic newspaper, followed the rift in the Anglican diocese with barely disguised glee. From around 1930 Canon Wise paid little attention to matters outside his church and congregation, and received only passing references from the Press. Bishop Thomas retired in October 1940. Wise resigned his charge due to ill-health on 1 April 1940, to take effect on 7 October having served as rector of St George's for 40 years. His successor was the Rev. Fr. Arnold M. Morralee, who returned to England in 1947. Rev. Fr A. C. R. Hogan arrived in December 1947. Wise died suddenly at his home on Fullarton Road, Highgate, aged 80, having just returned from a visit to England. Apart from an obituary in The Advertiser, there was little mention in the Press of his passing ‚Äî no funeral notice, no tributes and no bequests. His remains were cremated and sent to England, where they were interred with those of his wife in the churchyard in Ilsington, > Frequently misunderstood, the Canon had zealously continued his beneficent > work despite prejudice and opposition.

St George's, Goodwood maintains its position as \\"Australia's leading Anglo- Catholic church\\" to this day. Benefactors Possibly the best known of St George's congregation, and greatest contributors to the church, were Harry Bickford and (especially) his wife Priscilla. Harry Bickford (1874 ‚Äì 8 July 1906) was a member of the A. M. Bickford & Sons family; Priscilla Bickford, n√©e Chambers (c. 1852‚Äì1924) was a daughter of pastoralist John Chambers (1814‚Äì1889). They contributed ¬£3,000 (many millions of dollars in today's currency) towards St George's building fund, and generous sums towards other of Wise's endeavours. While on a visit to Italy they purchased as a gift to St George's Church, a 500-year old bell which had originally hung in a convent in Perugia. The bell was inscribed with the Catholic rendition of Luke i 28: Ave Maria gratia plena Dominus tecum (Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with you) Priscilla Bickford also donated generously to the day school fund. A series of fourteen relief images cast in Roman cement, depicting the Stations of the Cross, was dedicated to her memory. The contractor W. C. Torode made a substantial donation to the church in memory of Mrs Lower, mother of Mrs Torode, a regular worshipper at St George's. Agnes Helen Spence (1863‚Äì1949) gifted a large crucifix to the church in memory of her parents, Mr and Mrs John Brodie Spence. Associates Wilfred George Scholefield (1886‚Äì1969) was one of several acolytes training for the priesthood under Wise whose entry to St Barnabas' College were refused by Bishop Thomas, effectively blocking their careers. Scholefield was able, by studying at St Chad's Theological College, Lichfield, England, to qualify for the priesthood, and was ordained deacon in 1914. He then served with the British army before returning to Adelaide and St George's Church. In 1920 Bishop Thomas granted him six months' temporary licence to officiate at Goodwood while Wise was in England on holiday, however his later application for a full licence was refused. In another barely restrained newspaper joust, Wise protested, while admitting it was within the bishop's prerogative, providing it was not part of a personal vendetta. Scholefield then left for Tasmania where he tried to form a religious \\"Order of the Holy Family\\", later became priest in charge of St Paul's Church, Risdon Park, Port Pirie. Family Wise married Caroline Louisa Lyon in England shortly before leaving for Australia. She was a sister of the architect Thomas Henry Lyon who designed St George's Church, Goodwood and the reredos for St Peter's Cathedral. She died of a fever in the Philippines on 21 May 1900 while en route to London. They had no children and Wise never remarried. A stained glass window in the Church of the Epiphany, Crafers, depicting angels of the Ascension and Resurrection, was dedicated to her memory. The rood screen in St George's designed by T H Lyon, 1905, was also dedicated to her memory.

He is best known for his 2011 biography of King Henry VII of England, Winter King: The Dawn of Tudor England, for which he won the HW Fisher Best First Biography prize and which was the subject of a 2013 BBC documentary that he presented. He is also the author of The Brothers York: An English Tragedy, published in October 2019.  Biography  Penn earned his Ph.D. in medieval history from Clare College, Cambridge. In addition to his writing, he is the editorial director of Penguin Press UK. He played for the Authors XI amateur cricket team, which is composed of British writers, during its first two seasons and he contributed a chapter to the team's book about their first season playing together, The Authors XI: A Season of English Cricket from Hackney to Hambledon (Bloomsbury, 2013).  Career  Penn's first book, Winter King: The Dawn of Tudor England, was published by Penguin Books in 2011 and is an account of the life of King Henry VII of England. Historian Helen Castor reviewed it for The Telegraph, writing: \\"In broad outline, this is not a new story ‚Äì but, in Penn's hands, it is a revelation...Penn has pulled off a rare feat: a brilliant and haunting evocation of the Tudor world, with irresistible echoes of the age of fear in which we now live\\". Reviewing it for The Guardian, Blair Worden wrote: \\"If Penn's interpretation can sometimes seem slanted, its exposition would be hard to over-praise. The expressive and evocative power of his writing, and the union of scholarship with artistry, are rare in modern historical writing\\". Penn was awarded the HW Fisher Best First Biography prize by the Biographers' Club in 2012 for Winter King. In 2013, Penn presented an hour-long television documentary based on his book on BBC Two. It was titled Henry VII: Winter King. His next book for adults, The Brothers York: An English Tragedy, is about Edward IV and his two younger brothers, the Duke of Clarence and Richard III.

In Engaging Characters: Fiction, Emotion, and the Cinema (1995) Smith rehabilitated the idea that characters are central to our experience of narrative. His approach to our emotional responses to characters draws on cognitive science and philosophy of mind. Film Theory and Philosophy (1997), which Smith edited with Richard Allen, makes the wider case for an approach to film drawing on the tools of analytic philosophy. In Film, Art, and the Third Culture (2017), Smith elaborates and defends the approach underpinning much of his earlier research, arguing in favour of a naturalized or ‚Äòthird cultural‚Äô approach to aesthetics, integrating the knowledge and methods of the humanities and the sciences.

He was twice awarded the title Hero of the Soviet Union and went on to become a Marshal of Aviation.  Early life  Skomorokhov was born on 19 May 1922 to a Russian peasant family in the village of Lapot before the formation of the Soviet Union. He lived in the city of Astrakhan since 1931. Once he completed secondary school in 1935, he entered a vocational school. Upon entering the vocational school, he wrote in documents that he older than he actually was, claiming to be born in 1920. After completing his training at the vocational school he worked as a mechanic and turner a factory before he began studying at the Astrakhan Technical School in 1939. In 1940 he completed his studies at the technical school and graduated from training local aeroclub, after which he entered the military in December. In March 1942 he graduated from the Bataysk Military Aviation School of Pilots, which had been relocated to Yevlakh due to the German invasion of the Soviet Union. From March to October 1942 he was assigned to the 25th Reserve Aviation Regiment, where he trained on the LaGG-33 in Adzhikabul until his was deployed to the warfront.  World War II  In November 1942 Skomorokhov arrived at the warfront as a junior pilot in the 164th Fighter Aviation Regiment. He barely survived one of his first sorties after he got cut off from the rest of his squadron and was chased by multiple Messerschmitts; only his skillful maneuvering saved him and his fighter from the Luftwaffe. On 2 January 1943 he scored his first aerial victory, a shared kill of an Fw-190. It was not until 22 February 1943 that he scored his first solo victory when he shot down a Ju 87 dive bomber. He scored one more aerial victory while flying the LaGG-33 in March before he switched to flying the La-5. His first victory on the La-5 in June after he shot down an Me-109. That victory was recreated in a Soviet propaganda film, which showed him taking off from the airfield and shooting down the enemy plane right after a meeting about his application to join the Communist Party. Throughout the summer of 1943 he rapidly grew his victory tally, and by the end of the year he had claimed 13 solo shootdowns of enemy aircraft. When he switched to flying the La-5 in Spring 1945, he managed to gain nine aerial victories over the course of one month. In 1944 Skomorokhov was selected as the deputy commander of a free-hunting \\"squadron of aces\\" formed out of the best pilots of the 295th Fighter Aviation Division. His colleagues there included flying aces and , who were also awarded the title Hero of the Soviet Union. While the squadron did shoot down dozens of enemy aircraft, it was disbanded after three months of existence since regimental commanders in the 295th Fighter Aviation Division wanted their aces back and the regiments they left suffered higher casualty rates in their absence. After the squadron was disbanded, he was assigned in April as the deputy squadron commander of the 1st squadron of the 31st Fighter Aviation Regiment, which had worked closely with the \\"squadron of aces\\" when it existed and shared an airbase with them; he was eventually promoted to the position of squadron commander. Over Czechoslovakia near Sz√©kesfeh√©rv√°r in December 1944, Skomorokhov shot down four enemy aircraft in one day after he led an attack on a group of eight Fw-190 and two Me-109 in one mission and then attacked another group of eight Fw-190 in another mission. During the first engagement, his wingman was shot down by an Me-109, but on the second mission, his wingman shot down an Fw-190. On 28 December he was nominated for the title Hero of the Soviet Union, which he received on 23 February 1945. After gaining more aerial victories he was nominated for a second gold star on 27 February 1945, which was awarded after the war on 18 August 1945. Throughout the course of the war he fought in the 5th and 17th Air Armies on the Transcaucasian, North Caucasian, Southwestern and 3rd Ukrainian fronts, and participated in military operations over Caucasus, Ukraine, Moldova, Romania, Bulgaria, Yugoslavia, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, and Austria. In total, he scored 44 solo and three shared confirmed aerial victories, having made 605 sorties and engaged in 143 dogfights. Despite the odds being against him, he was never shot down or wounded.

Initially he remained in his position as a squadron commander in the 31st Fighter Aviation Regiment based in Bulgaria, but he later left the position to attend the M. V. Frunze Military Academy, which he graduated from in November 1949. From January 1950 to May 1952 he served as the commander of the 111th Guards Fighter Aviation Regiment, based in Ukraine; he then became the deputy commander of the 279th Fighter Aviation Division before he was made the commander of the 246th Fighter Aviation Division in January 1954. In 1958 he graduated from the Military Academy of General Staff, after which he was assigned to the post of first deputy commander of the 71st Fighter Aviation Corps, which was part of the Soviet forces stationed in East Germany. In February 1961 he became the commander of the unit, and in April 1968 he was promoted to be the commander of the 69th Air Army, which was renamed the 17th Air Army in April 1972. By that year he accumulated 3,500 flight hours. He served as the chief of the Gagarin Air Force Academy from August 1973 until October 1988, during which he was promoted to the rank of Marshal of Aviation in 1981. From 1988 until his retirement in 1992 he served as an advisor to the Ministry of Defense of the USSR.

They were licensed versions of AMD's Am9511 and Am9512 FPUs, from 1977 and 1979, themselves claimed by AMD as the world's first single-chip FPU solutions.  Adoption  Whilst the i8231/i8323 (and their AMD-branded cousins) were primarily intended to partner the i8080 (or the AMD clone Am9080), the multiple interface options in their design, from simple wait state insertion and status polling routines to interrupt and DMA controller driven methods suitable for a peripheral processor or add-in board, meant that ‚Äì with a small amount of glue logic ‚Äì it was usable in almost any microprocessor system that had a DMA subsystem or a spare interrupt input/interrupt vector available, and AMD's original documentation provided several different examples. This was a valuable feature for one of the first commercially available single-chip FPUs, greatly broadening its potential market, and was in stark contrast to Intel's succeeding, in-house designed 8087 (and other x87 family) FPUs which were tightly bound to the x86 CPU line. For example, the i8231A was used in the Applied Analytics MicroSPEED II and II+ accelerator cards for the 6502-based Apple II line, but examples were also given for the Z80, MC6800, i8085, and even the 16-bit Z8000. Additionally, prior to the introduction of the 8087, Intel's own preliminary datasheets suggested the chips as suitable companions for the then-new 8086.  Capacity  The Intel 8231 (and revised 8231A) is the Arithmetic Processing Unit (APU). It offered 32-bit \\"double\\" precision (a term later and more commonly used to describe 64-bit floating-point numbers, whilst 32-bit is considered \\"single\\" precision) floating-point, and 16-bit or 32-bit (\\"single\\" or \\"double\\" precision) fixed-point calculation of 14 different arithmetic and trigonometric functions to a proprietary standard. The APU used the Chebyshev polynomials using the algorithms provided here. The available APU version of 4-MHz was for USD $235.00 and 2-MHz was for USD $149.00 in quantities of 100 or more.Intel Corporation, \\"Intel peripherals enhance 8086 system design\\", Intel Preview Special Issue: 16-Bit Solution, May/June 1980, Pg. 22 The later Intel 8232 is the Floating Point Processor Unit (FPU). It performed 32-bit or 64-bit (true single- and double-precision) floating point calculations compliant with the (draft) IEEE-754 standard (as used by the i80387 and other later FPUs), but only on the four primary arithmetic functions (addition, subtraction, multiplication and division). The available FPU version of 4-MHz was for USD $235.00 and 2-MHz was for USD $149.00 in quantities of 100 or more.Intel Corporation, \\"Intel peripherals enhance 8086 system design\\", Intel Preview Special Issue: 16-Bit Solution, May/June 1980, Pg. 22 All three chips used an 8-bit data bus design, in line with the i8080 and most other contemporary microprocessors. The 8231 could run at up to 3 MHz, and the 8231A and 8232 up to 4 MHz (a slight improvement on the Am9512 which was limited to 3 MHz), either in sync with the CPU or (in the 8231A and 8232) asynchronously depending on the degree of bus separation in the host system. Async operation was a useful addition to the feature set, as it allowed e.g. a roughly 1 MHz Apple II system to be expanded with a 4 MHz 8231A and enjoy the benefit of much faster numeric processing than it may otherwise have been limited to, or a 5 MHz i8085-based system to host an 8231A or 8232 without itself having to be slowed to 4 MHz or less to maintain compatibility. It also, along with the interrupt driven peripheral design, allowed a degree of parallel processing between the CPU and FPU, with the former resuming its own normal processing after passing commands and data to the essentially \\"offboard\\" coprocessor, only switching back to the floating-point subtask (to receive results and optionally issue further commands) when signalled by the copro that processing was complete. This parallelisation was vital to improving overall system throughput, when some of the more complex functions could still take the FPU several milliseconds to complete ‚Äì an eternity in computing terms. Instruction execution times were very variable and, as an early generation design, typically much longer than those seen in later, more evolved FPUs. For example, ignoring data and stack handling instructions, on the 8232 they ranged from 56 clock periods for a single-precision (32-bit) subtraction, to a full 4560 periods for a double-precision (64-bit) divide, for an effective processing speed (if clocked at 4 MHz) of 877 to 71429 FLOPS. The 8231(A)'s instructions ranged from 17 periods for a 16-bit fixed-point addition, through 98 to 378 periods for common 32-bit float operations (heavily dependent not only on the function itself, but the actual magnitude of the operands and result, and even the number of \\"1\\" bits in each number), to as many as 12032 periods for a maximally complex \\"power\\" calculation, giving 332, through 10.6k ~ 40.8k, to 235.3k FLOPS of performance (at 4 MHz) depending on the instruction and data mix.. Whilst these numbers may seem low from a modern perspective, they compare reasonably well with the successor i8087 (whose bigger advantages were a wider databus and address range ‚Äì allowing faster transfers in and out of a larger memory space, greater numeric precision, expanded instruction/function set and near-IEEE-754 compliance), and were radically faster compared to performing the same calculations using software emulation on a regular CPU ‚Äì even a relatively sophisticated, 16-bit 8086 running at a full 8 MHz could only achieve somewhere between a few dozen, to no more than around 1000 FLOPS without a coprocessor, and its slower clocked, 8-bit predecessors and rivals would have fared even worse.

She has received many awards for her work including the August Prize. Early years and education Yvonne Hirdman is the daughter of the language teacher Einar Hirdman (1916‚Äì1999) and Charlotte Hirdman, born Schledt (1906‚Äì1966), and granddaughter of Gunnar and Maj Hirdman. She is the mother of Anja Hirdman and sister of Sven Hirdman. She grew up in H√∂kar√§ngen, Malmberget. and Oskarshamn. She received a bachelor's degree in 1968 and PhD in 1974 at Stockholm University with the thesis of Sveriges Kommunistiska Parti 1939‚Äì1945 (\\"Swedish Communist Party 1939‚Äì1945\\"). Career She has, among other things, conducted gender-oriented research and is particularly known for having in Sweden launched the concept of \\"gender\\", which was already established in the English language in 1988.Yvonne Hirdman: Genussystemet - reflexioner kring kvinnors sociala underordning, p√• G√∂teborgs universitets webbplats Her theories came first to have an impact on the state power investigation, where she was one of the members. She has been a professor of history at the University of Gothenburg, working at the Institute for Working Life; professor of contemporary history at S√∂dert√∂rn University; and professor of history at Stockholm University, where, as of 2017, she is professor emerita in the history department. Hirdman has done a lot of research on gender and is also the person who launched the word \\"gender\\" in the Swedish language in the 1980s. The concept of gender became helpful when talking about the \\"female\\" or the \\"male\\" in a context of cultural and social rather than biological. In 1988, Hirdman published a report at the University of Gothenburg in book form entitled: The Genus System: theoretical considerations about women's social subordination, the Power Investigation. It was in this report that Hirdman wrote about the concept of gender in its importance in the Swedish language and then the concept was launched in the Swedish language. In 2004 she wrote a book by the title: The Genus System - Reflections on Women's Social Subordination. In 2001, Hirdman published her first edition of the book Genus, about the changing forms of stability. A newer edition was published in 2003 with the same title. In all these books and reports, the common component is that everyone is concerned and touches on the subject gender both as a subject and as a concept. Therefore, Hirdman can be viewed as a protagonist in this area and a person who made a major impression on this topic in Sweden's history.

She was appointed by Chief Kirk Francis in September 2017.  Early life Dana was born on the Penobscot Indian Island Reservation on May 17, 1984, and is one of five children. She is the daughter of former Penobscot Nation Chief Barry Dana, who served from 2000‚Äê2004. She attended the University of Maine with a focus in Political Science. In 2005 she was awarded the Margaret Chase Smith Public Policy Scholarship and went on to graduate in 2006. Political career Dana was elected to the Penobscot Nation Tribal Council in 2016 for a four-year term. In September 2017, Chief Kirk Francis appointed her as the first Tribal Ambassador of the Penobscot Nation. She is a regular fixture at the Maine State House in Augusta where she can be found testifying on behalf of her community and helping to create policy. She has proposed bills such as An Act to Ban Native American Mascots in Maine Schools and provided necessary input for the bill to change Columbus Day to Indigenous Peoples Day. Since the fall of 2018 Dana has been a board member of the Maine Center for Economic Policy, a nonpartisan research and policy organization which focuses on improving the economic well-being of low- and moderate-income Maine residents. Activism =Hunt for the Indian controversy= The Skowhegan, Maine Chamber of Commerce scheduled a holiday activity entitled Hunt for the Indian in November 2017. The intention of the event was to increase visits to local businesses by offering a discounts to individuals who located small Native American figurines. Dana addressed this by both a call to action among Native Americans and allies and by addressing the issue herself head on. The choice of the Chamber's campaign was especially egregious due to the Battle of Norridgewock and the proclamation issued by Spencer Phips, both of which led to the deaths of numerous Abenaki and Penobscot Peoples. On November 5, 2017 the Chamber issued an apology stating: > Never were we so wrong in thinking that this latest promotion involving the > Chamber‚Äôs Skowhegan Indian statue would be a good idea. This event has been > canceled. It was never our intention to offend anyone, quite the opposite. > It was our goal to honor our community icon, support local business and > engage the people of greater Skowhegan. No apology can take away our lack of > empathy and foresight in this decision. And, for that we are truly sorry. > Now we understand we‚Äôve created a bigger problem of not seeing our actions > from others‚Äô perspectives, given the local and national issues around > mascots and racism. Dana later commended the Chamber on the cancellation of the event and their public apology. =Native American mascots= Maulian Dana speaking at Skowhegan, Maine school board meeting As the founder of Maine's Not Your Mascot chapter, Dana has been advocating for the eradication of Native American themed mascots, icons and names within the states educational districts. In 2015 Dana led an effort to retire the Indians mascot in Skowhegan, Maine. On April 13, 2015, Dana was part of a panel of Wabenaki Peoples who spoke before the Skowhegan, Maine School Administrative District 54 board, residents, faculty and supporters.Maine School Administrative District 54 The school committee voted against retiring the mascot on May 7, 2015 Dana then went on to work with other school districts in Maine and was successful in changing the Native American mascots in all remaining districts with the exception of Skowhegan. Beginning in late 2018 Dana, other Native American leaders and tribal members along with non-Native allies, began addressing the issue in Skowhegan once more. After a number of heated school board meetings as well as a district wide forum, the Skowhegan Indians mascot was retired. Shortly there after Dana introduced bill LD944, An Act To Ban Native American Mascots in All Public Schools, sponsored by Representative Benjamin Collings. On April 30, 2019 the bill passed in the Maine Senate by a vote of 23-10 =Missing and murdered Indigenous women= Dana has been at the forefront of bringing attention to the missing and murdered Indigenous women epidemic that has plagued indigenous communities for years. She recently worked with Representative Ben Collings on LD 766, a bill that would permit the Penobscot and Passamaquoddy tribes to prosecute non-tribal offenders in tribal court.

He stated that his parents were supportive. Moore described his high school community as very \\"liberal\\" and as a result he did not experience bullying after coming out. Moore received his bachelor's degree from Dartmouth College in 2013 where he was a member of the student acapella group The Dartmouth Aires. In 2011 Moore appeared on the reality singing competition The Sing-Off with the groups and they placed second to Pentatonix.

He portrayed Ethan, an out, femme classmate who is bullied for his appearance and sexuality. Moore stated that, like Ethan, he was one of the only openly gay people in his high school and that he advocates for representation of LGBT narratives on screen saying, \\"The gay experience exists on a spectrum, and everyone's experience, wherever you fall on that spectrum, is valid, and it's important, and it needs to be told.\\" Of his performance, Dazed wrote that his \\"slight and thoughtful scenes add a nuance to the film that elevates it immeasurably\\" and that he \\"steals every scene he's in with perfect one-liners.\\" He later appeared in co-star Keiynan Lonsdale‚Äôs music video for the song ‚ÄúGood Life.‚Äù In October 2018, he joined the cast of the CW's Crazy Ex-Girlfriend for its final season in the role of AJ.

She is associated with the Freedom Quilting Bee, where her mother, Qunnie Pettway, worked, and with the Gee's Bend quilt-makers. Her quilts Sew Low and Vegetation are part of the Eskenazi Health Art Collection.  Early life  Loretta Pettway Bennett was born on a farm in Gee's Bend, Alabama to Qunnie Pettway and Tom O. Pettway. She and her siblings frequently worked on her grandfather, Tank Pettway's, farm growing cotton, corn, peanuts, and sweet potatoes, among other crops. Bennett remarks on the naming traditions of Gee's Bend using her family as an example: > \\"Aunt Lucy was the sister of my father, Tom O. Pettway, Jr. An interesting > thing is that Aunt Lucy‚Äôs middle name was Tomo. Because so many people in > Gee‚Äôs Bend have the name of Pettway, people get middle names that let others > know who their fathers are, so nobody marries a close cousin by mistake. My > father and his father carry the middle initial O. for Ottaway, a name that > goes back to an original Pettway slave called Ottaway.\\" Bennett's family home did not receive running water or paved roads until 1975, when she was 15 years old. Previously, the family would haul water buckets from neighbors' homes or nearby wells and springs. Gee's Bend schools went through desegregation in Bennett's seventh grade year, and were shut down shortly thereafter. In order to continue her education, Bennett was required to take a crowded school bus two hours each morning and night to reach schools in neighboring counties. This arduous trek made participating in extracurricular activities nearly impossible. Nonetheless, Bennett graduated and married her high school sweetheart, Lovett \\"Bennett\\" Bennett on July 7, 1979. Bennett's husband enlisted in the U.S. Army immediately after graduation, and they spent the next twenty years moving with the military. During her husband's military career, Bennett and her family lived in various cities in Germany, El Paso, Texas, and Georgia. While living in Germany and Texas, Bennett and her family traveled throughout Europe and the American southwest. They raised three boys and eventually settled down again in Gee's Bend, Alabama after Bennett's grandmother, Candis Pettway, died in 1998.  Career  Bennett was introduced to the quilting tradition, when she was five or six years old, although \\"At that age we were only allowed to thread the needles for the quilters in my grandmother‚Äôs and my mother‚Äôs quilting group.\\" Every summer, her mother and aunts would train more sewing into her skill set, little by little. Her first completed quilt was a baby blanket, which was a Home Economics' project for her Home Economic's teacher's arriving grandchild. Throughout her travels in Europe and the American Southwest, Bennett always marveled at each culture's distinct use of color. In regards to Germany, she noted that \\"The Germans were not big on having a lot of different colors, especially not on their houses, cars, and clothing, compared to Americans. But in the springtime things were different. I got to see another side of Germany, as many houses were decorated with flower boxes of red geraniums and pansies sitting on the window ledges, with white and black-trimmed houses in the background.\\" Some of her pieces, such as her early 2000s, duo-tone blocks and strips works, remind the viewer of Bauhaus ways of color usage, or the organization of Piet Mondrien. She exchanged craft traditions with local Germans often, recalling that her neighbors taught her to knit and she sold a few of her mother's quilts among her friends in Germany. Truly understanding the depth of Gee's Bend's quilts national importance overwhelmed Bennett when she first saw the quilts displayed at the Houston Museum of Fine Art in 2002. She describes that moment as, \\"There my eyes were opened, and it touched me in a way as to question myself: Can I make a quilt that someday might hang on the wall of a museum?\\" Determined to carry on her ancestor's legacies, Bennett applied for and received a fellowship grant from the Alabama State Archive Council on the Arts to study the fine details of Gee's bend quilt-making. From this fellowship, her and her mother created a \\"Pine Burr\\" quilt, the state quilt of Alabama. Bennett donated this quilt to the Alabama Council of the Arts, where it now hangs on the walls of the Alabama Department of Archives and History. She is a prolific artist and culture-bearer, dedicated to propagating her community's traditions for future generations.

Crowley had previously adapted The Boys in the Band for a 1970 film version directed by William Friedkin and starring the original 1968 Off-Broadway cast. The film stars the full roster of players from the play's 2018 Broadway revival, comprising a cast of exclusively openly-gay actors, such as Jim Parsons, Zachary Quinto, Matt Bomer, Andrew Rannells, Charlie Carver, Robin de Jes√∫s, Brian Hutchison, Michael Benjamin Washington, and Tuc Watkins. The film was released on September 30, 2020, by Netflix, and received generally positive reviews from critics. Premise A group of gay friends re-unite to celebrate one of their birthdays at an apartment on the Upper East Side of Manhattan in July of 1968. When the host's straight former college roommate shows up uninvited, the evening is thrown into turmoil. Cast * Jim Parsons as Michael, the host and catalyst for most of the drama of the play; Harold's \\"smartly groomed\\" \\"frenemy\\" * Zachary Quinto as Harold, whose birthday is being celebrated. He is an \\"ugly, pock- marked Jew fairy\\", in the character's own words, who is becoming increasingly morose about losing his youthful looks and his ability to attract cute young men * Matt Bomer as Donald, Michael's conflicted boyfriend who has moved from the city to the Hamptons to spurn the homosexual \\"lifestyle\\", and is undergoing psychoanalysis; he has \\"wholesome American good looks\\" * Andrew Rannells as Larry, an \\"extremely handsome\\" commercial artist who prefers multiple sex partners * Charlie Carver as Cowboy, an attractive blond hustler who is \\"not too bright\\" and \\"too pretty\\", is one of Harold's birthday presents * Robin de Jes√∫s as Emory, a flamboyant and effeminate interior decorator * Brian Hutchison as Alan McCarthy, Michael's married, \\"aristocratic\\" and \\"Anglo-Saxon\\" college friend and roommate; an unexpected party guest. He is visiting New York and anxious to tell Michael something, but hesitant to do so in front of the others. It is suggested that he once had homosexual affairs while in college, but his sexual orientation is never explicitly stated, leaving it to audience interpretation. * Michael Benjamin Washington as Bernard, an African-American librarian who still pines for the wealthy white boy in whose house his mother worked as a maid. * Tuc Watkins as Hank, Larry's live-in boyfriend who has been married to a woman from whom he is separated and is divorcing; he \\"passes\\" as straight and disagrees with Larry on the issue of monogamy. Production On April 18, 2019, Ryan Murphy announced that the play The Boys in the Band would be adapted for Netflix, as part of his US$300 million deal with the streaming platform. Murphy had previously revived the play for Broadway in 2018 and confirmed the director of the revival, Joe Mantello, would direct the film. David Stone and Ned Martel were announced as producers alongside Murphy. It was also confirmed that the entire cast of the 2018 Broadway revival would reprise their roles for the film, making the film have a cast of entirely openly gay actors. Principal photography began in July 2019 in Los Angeles. The film was dedicated to the memory of Mart Crowley who passed away on March 7, 2020. Release The film was released on Netflix on September 30, 2020. On the same day the film was available for streaming, a 30-minute mini-documentary was also released with Mart Crowley reflecting on the legacy of the story.  Reception  On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 80% based on 79 reviews, with an average rating of 7.24/10. The site's critics' consensus reads: \\"The Boys in the Band brings the classic stage play back to the screen with a well-acted adaptation containing surprising ‚Äî and poignant ‚Äî modern relevance.\\" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 70 out of 100 based on 19 critics, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews\\". Owen Gleiberman of Variety praised the performances, saying \\"What holds the movie together, apart from Quinto's dreamy geek mystique and delectable delivery of every line, is the tormented passion that Jim Parsons brings to it.\\" David Rooney of The Hollywood Reporter gave the film a positive review and wrote: \\"The Boys in the Band in many ways is dated and formulaic. But it's also very much alive, an invaluable record of the destructive force of societal rejection, even in a bastion of liberal acceptance like New York City. Despite its flaws, this consistently engaging film provides a vital window for young queer audiences into the difficult lives of their forebears.\\" Notably, the play contains 2 uses of the racist slur nigger, spoken by Parsons' character Michael, as well as other homophobic and antisemitic slurs. Parsons stated that \\"none of those words were ever uttered by me without a severe amount of trepidation and a sick feeling in your stomach going into it\\", but were important to \\"make the audience feel the discomfort of the marginalization of the gay community at the time\\". Matt Bomer said, of performing the play on- stage, that \\"I heard a guttural gasp the first time one of these slurs was used that I remembered and realized how powerful they really are\\". In an interview ahead of the Netflix premi√®re, director Joe Mantello told the Associated Press that: > I do not believe the erasure of things that make us uncomfortable is > progress ... My responsibility is to the story. And the story is: This the > cost of oppression, it allows you to act in a way that is inhumane. And I > felt in order to be honest to that, that you‚Äôre true to that, that it was > essential that we keep it. Michael Benjamin Washington, the only Black member of the cast, pointed out that: > If you‚Äôre setting a play in 1968 and you have a Black character and we‚Äôre > gonna pretend like he‚Äôs not black, then you‚Äôre not telling the truth. Just > as if I wrote a play about 2020, but Black Lives Matter doesn‚Äôt happen.

Published by the Society of Saint Casimir, it focused on the issues of Lithuanian culture, literature, science, and politics and was geared towards the intelligentsia and the Catholic clergy. It urged everyone to work on developing the Lithuanian culture which would distinguish the Lithuanian nation from others and believed in slow and steady cultural work. The magazine critically reviewed essentially every more substantial work of Lithuanian literature, published articles to improve and standardize the Lithuanian language, discussed how to improve education, analyzed social and political issues in Lithuania, promoted Christian democracy, criticized ultra-conservatives and attempted to find the proper place for the Catholic Church in modern society and science. Its issues usually had more than 100 pages and reached circulation of 1,000 copies. Its long-term editor was Catholic priest Adomas Jak≈°tas (1907‚Äì1938). In total, 213 issues were published. Its supplement for Catholic youth Ateitis (Future) edited by Pranas Dovydaitis gave rise to the Lithuanian Catholic Federation Ateitis. History The Lithuanian press ban in the Russian Empire was in effect from 1864 to 1904, thus the first Lithuanian cultural magazine Dirva was published by Antanas Milukas in the United States and the illegal ≈Ωinyƒçia established by Juozas Tumas-Vai≈ægantas lasted only five issues. When the press ban was lifted in 1904, Lithuanians hurried to establish various periodicals. In July 1906, during a meeting of the newly established Society of Saint Casimir for publishing Lithuanian books, it was decided to establish a new cultural magazine. It was understood that the magazine would be unprofitable due to the limited number of subscribers. The society's chairman Adomas Jak≈°tas became the editor of Draugija. The first issue was published in January 1907. The monthly magazine with circulation of 1,000 copies was printed at the press of Saliamonas Banaitis. In February 1911, Draugija began publishing supplement for Catholic youth Ateitis (Future) edited by Pranas Dovydaitis. It had its own supplement which published samples of Lithuanian folklore (songs, riddles, proverbs, etc.) collected by the students. It gave rise to the Lithuanian Catholic Federation Ateitis and became an independent publication in 1913. In 1914, Draugija also published a supplement for teachers Mokytojas (Teacher) edited by . The magazine continued to be printed monthly until the outbreak of World War I. Jak≈°tas and several others, as politically unreliable persons, were deported from Kaunas to Vilnius by the commandant of the Kaunas Fortress. Therefore, the last four issues of 1914 of Draugija were published in one booklet in early 1915. The subsequent German occupation interrupted any further attempts to publish the magazine. German authorities allowed to reestablish the publication only in October 1918. The first issue appeared in January 1919. It was a monthly publication, but it would combine two issues into one booklet published every two months. From the beginning of 1923, it became the official publication of the newly established Faculty of Theology and Philosophy of the University of Lithuania. However, the faculty dropped the magazine after it published a political article on the Lithuanian Christian Democratic Party. Draugija was discontinued in October 1923 after 153 issues. It was partially replaced by ' published by the Ateitis Federation in 1925‚Äì1940. Draugija was revived as a periodical published every two weeks in 1937. Jak≈°tas resumed editorship and after his death was replaced by . The magazine was discontinued after the Soviet occupation in June 1940. Content More than 150 authors contributed articles to Draugija before World War I. Its authors included Jonas Basanaviƒçius, Pranas B≈´ƒçys, Kazimieras B≈´ga, Pranas Dovydaitis, Liudas Gira, Motiejus Gustaitis, Lazdyn≈≥ Pelƒóda, Petras Leonas, Maironis, Pranas Ma≈°iotas, Jurgis Matulaitis-Matuleviƒçius, Vincas Mykolaitis-Putinas, Juozas Purickis, Justinas Staugaitis, Stasys ≈†alkauskis, ≈†atrijos Ragana, Juozas Tumas-Vai≈ægantas, Augustinas Voldemaras, Vyd≈´nas. =Social issues= The magazine devoted significant attention to issues in education. Russian public schools could accommodate only about a quarter of all children but Lithuanians were allowed to organize their own private schools only after the Russian Revolution of 1905. As new schools were organized by various parishes as well as the Saulƒó Society in Kovno Governorate and ≈Ωiburys Society in Suwa≈Çki Governorate, Draugija published numerous articles on the state of education in the country and plans for improving it, discussed school curriculum, teaching methods, child psychology, debated Catholic and secular approaches to education, reported on education practices in other countries (United States, Scandinavia, Switzerland, Ukraine, etc.), popularized new scientific achievements and explained science topics (e.g. about paleontology, comets, telepathy). The Russian Revolution also brought class conflict and other social issues to the forefront. As Lithuanians organized the first societies for workers (e.g. Workers' Society of St. Joseph founded by Konstantinas Ol≈°auskas or Society of Saint Zita), the magazine published articles debating the role of the Catholic Church, charities, mutual aid societies in addressing social issues, discussing socialism and bolshevism as well as broader concepts of sociology, eugenics, political economy, addressing more specific issues of Lithuanian emigration to United States or teetotalism. =Literature, language, history= The magazine promoted the preservation of cultural heritage and development of the Lithuanian cultural revival. Draugija published literary works and their critical reviews. Each issue began with poems by known and newly discovered Lithuanian authors as well as translated poems of foreign authors such as Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, Victor Hugo, Alexander Pushkin, Adam Mickiewicz. The magazine also published a few short stories by Lazdyn≈≥ Pelƒóda, ≈†atrijos Ragana, Liudas Gira, , and others. It published four dramas: Hamlet by William Shakespeare, a comedy by Roderich Benedix, a drama by Paul Heyse, and historical drama Kƒôstuƒçio mirtis (Death of Kƒôstutis) by Maironis. Almost every more substantial new literary work in Lithuanian was critically reviewed by Draugija, frequently by its editor Jak≈°tas. These reviews were compiled and published separately in two-volume M≈´s≈≥ naujoji literat≈´ra (Our New Literature) in 1923. Other articles were devoted to reviewing works of certain writers, including Jonas Krik≈°ƒçi≈´nas (Jovaras), Maironis, ≈Ωemaitƒó, Jonas Bili≈´nas, etc. Draugija also published historical studies on the Lithuanian literature, including on Dionizas Po≈°ka, Antanas Baranauskas, , Au≈°ra. Juozas Gabrys published a synthesis that covered not only individual authors, but also Lithuanian Chronicles and Lithuanian folklore. A few articles were published on foreign authors (Dante Alighieri, Fyodor Dostoevsky, Xenophon). The magazine frequently published articles dealing with the Lithuanian language, its history, standardization, syntax, lexicon, often written by linguist Kazimieras B≈´ga. In particular, the magazine dealt with identification of various loan words and barbarisms in Catholic texts and their replacement with Lithuanian equivalents. After the death of linguist Kazimieras Jaunius, one entire issue was dedicated to him. The magazine also published articles on the philosophy of language and Esperanto (translated from a work by Jan Baudouin de Courtenay). Draugija also published articles on topics from the history of Lithuania, for example about King Mindaugas, Battle of Grunwald, Reformation in Lithuania, Lithuanian press ban. Jak≈°tas wrote numerous obituaries. =Other topics= Draugija supported Catholic ideas and worldview but also embraced reforms and progress and criticized ultra- conservatives. It published philosophical articles on the place of the Catholic faith in science and culture as well as articles on topics in religious philosophy, for example theosophy, mysticism, asceticism, evolution, logic, Polish Messianism. In politics, the periodical supported the Christian democracy and the Lithuanian Christian Democratic Party though it claimed to be a cultural and not a political magazine. It published some broader thoughts and comments on political topics, for example an article by Augustinas Voldemaras on the proposed Lithuania's autonomy, the League of Nations, human rights, democracy, Constituent Assembly of Lithuania. Each issue had about 8 to 12 pages devoted to overview of Polish and Russian press on Lithuania. Draugija denounced any Polish plans for cultural or political union with Lithuania. A specific issue discussed several times was the Polish language used in church services. The magazine, in a way, it attempted to catalog Lithuanian publications and periodicals. Works of fiction received critical reviews, while periodicals were summarized presenting key ideas. Draugija presented content summaries of periodicals published in Lithuania and abroad in 1907‚Äì1914: Vilniaus ≈æinios, Lietuvos ≈æinios, Viltis, ≈†altinis, Nedƒóldienio skaitymas, Vienybƒó, Lietuvos ≈´kininkas, Skardas, Katalikas, ≈Ωvaig≈ædƒó, Kova, Draugas, Vadovas, Rygos garsas. It also published summaries of Polish, French, German periodicals as well as of foreign coverage of Lithuania. Draugija published a chronicle of social and cultural events in Lithuania.

She was a founding member of the Freedom Quilting Bee, and is associated with the Gee's Bend quiltmakers, along with her daughter Mary Lee Bendolph and her granddaughter Essie Bendolph Pettway.Piece Together: The Quilts of Mary Lee Bendolph. Mount Holyoke College Art Museum and List Gallery, Swarthmore College. Almost all of her quilts were destroyed when her house burned down in 1984.  Early life  Mosely was one of eleven children of the Elizabeth Pettway Carson and Sim Carson family. Her mother was very active in the quilting community and would often host quilting bees at their home. She married Wisdom Mosely in 1929. They had 17 children together. In 1932, they lost everything to a raid of their property by agents of the Camden merchant's estate. However, in 1935, her family benefited from New Deal program called the Resettlement Administration, followed by the Farm Security Administration. With assistance from the Resettlement Administration, she and her family bought a house and 116 acres of arable land in Gee's Bend. She developed dementia later in life. After her house caught fire in 1984, which destroyed all of her remaining quilts, she spent her remaining years living with her daughter, Mary Lee Bendolph.  Work  Mosely's mother taught her how to quilt at a young age. Her father bought her a sewing machine, and thus, she was one of the only people in Gee's bend to quit entirely by machine. Her family was a cornerstone of the quilting community, and even made frames from found wood for other quilters. She was a founding member of and tireless resource for the Freedom Quilting Bee. She prided herself on the efficiency with which the bee ran when she was managing it. \\"When they get there, they ain't got nothing to do but go to sewing.\\" She worked for the bee until 1981 and then spent most of her time there volunteering. However, her earnings from the quilting bee allowed her to, over time, purchase a washing machine, indoor plumbing, and a freezer.

The ambush was carried out on 26 June 1967 by members of the South Tyrolean Liberation Committee, a paramilitary organization seeking the independence of German-speaking South Tyrol from Italy. The first explosion, involving the use of a landmine, struck a patrol of Alpini from the Italian Army, called in after the bombing of an electricity pylon. A second patrol, this time composed by Carabinieri, bore the full blast of a booby-trap while searching the area of the previous attack. One Alpini and three Carabinieri were killed, while a fourth Carabiniere survived with serious injuries.  Background  The annexation of South Tyrol after WWI saw a large German-speaking population within the redrawn boundaries of Italy, in the newly established province of Belluno. The Fascist regime later began a process of Italianization of South Tyrol, which triggered the passive resistance of the local population. The good relations between Fascist Italy and Nazi Germany resulted in the South Tyrol Option Agreement (1939), which gave the local residents the choice between emigration to Germany or full integration with Italy. A majority opted for Germany, but after a brief period of German occupation from 1943 to 1945, during WWII, most of the emigrants returned to Italy. Post-war relations between the German-speaking and the Italian communities proved tense, if not hostile, according to Giulio Andreotti, then president of the Italian Bureau of Border Issues. It is in this context, in 1957, that a local chairman of the South Tyrolean People's Party and local council head of Frangart, Sepp Kerschbaumer, became disenchanted with his party attitude toward Italianization and founded the \\"South Tyrolean Liberation Committee\\" (Befreiungsausschuss S√ºdtirol), which began a progressive campaign of confrontation with Italian authorities, initially limited to the distribution of leaflets or the display of the banned flag of Tyrol. The organization eventually resorted to violence; on 12 June 1961, the BAS organized the destruction by explosives of 37 electricity pylons supplying power to the industrial zone of Bolzano, later known as the Night of Fire (Feuernacht). One power plant was also severely damaged, while eight power plants shut down.  The attack  = First explosions = On 25 June 1967, at 03.40 am, a sentry watching the outpost of Forcella Dignas, near San Pietro di Cadore, heard a powerful blast from the direction of Cima Vallona, a pass in the Alps 2,532 meters above sea level. Apparently, an explosive device had toppled an electricity pylon. The serviceman radioed to his superiors at Santo Stefano di Cadore, who sent in a mobile patrol consisting of Alpini, Finanzieri and ammunition technicians. At 5:30 am, when the group arrived at 600 meters from the site of the explosion, snow piles forced them to get out from their off-road vehicles. The patrol, led by Captain Alamari, approached the collapsed pylon on foot. When the men were only 70 meters from the place, radio operator Armando Piva, an Alpino of the \\"Val Cismon\\" battalion, step on an explosive device hidden in a gravel pile. The perpetrators had spread anti- personnel mines on an area where the patrol should necessarily get through. Piva was maimed by the blast, and died of wounds several hours later. = Second patrol = A four-men team detached from the Compagnia Speciale Antiterrorismo, a provisional mixed unit drawn from the Carabinieri Parachute Battalion and the Saboteurs Parachute Battalion, was flown in from San Giacomo di Bolzano on an AB 204 helicopter of the 4th General Purpose Helicopters Unit. The members of the group, two officers and two NCOs, were all paratroopers and the two NCOs were both bomb disposal specialists. The mission of this team was to collect evidence to trace the individuals behind the attack. The helicopter landed the paratroopers at the base of the peak, several hundred meters from the mined area, that they reached on foot through a narrow trail. On their way back, some 400 meters from the landing area, a trip-wire bomb went off, killing Carabinieri Captain Francesco Gentile, Saboteurs 2nd Lieutenant Mario Di Lecce and Saboteurs Sergeant Olivo Dordi. The fourth man, Saboteurs Sergeant Major Marcello Fagnani, received 40 shrapnel wounds, but survived. According to Italian authorities, the BAS group who set up the ambush departed from Obertilliach, in the Austrian Tyrol, and reached Cima Vallona from a clandestine mountain path.  Aftermath  Five members of the BAS were indicted for the killings: Norbert Burger, Peter Kienesberger, Erhard Hartung, Egon Kufner (a sergeant in the Austrian Army) and Hans Christian Genck. Burger, Kienesberger and Hartung were sentenced to life imprisonment, while Kufner and Genck received 24 and 17 years in jail, respectively. All of them were sentenced by a court in Florence in absentia, after fleeing to Austria. Austrian authorities, under pressure from the Italian government, brought Kienesberger, Hartung e Kufner to trial, but eventually found them not guilty for lack of evidence. Captain Gentile was awarded the Gold Medal of Military Valour, while his subordinates were decorated with the Silver Medal of Military Valour. In 2010, all the personnel involved received the Medal of Remembrance to the victims of terrorism.

The marque vehicles are produced at facilities formerly owned by JMCG's JMCGL and Zotye Domy. History In May 2014, a company called Dancheng (Dorcen) Motor Co., Ltd. was established in Jintan District, Changzhou, based on a Zotye facility aimed at producing Domy-badged vehicles. The founder was Wu Hao, a son of a former Zotye chief. A Changzhou production base for the Dorcen company and Zotye was completed in 2015. In May 2017, Jiangsu Jintan Changdanghu New Energy Technology Co., Ltd. (Jintan Auto Group), the holding company of Dorcen Motor Co., Ltd., reorganised Fuzhou- based JMCGL, a JMCG subsidiary focused on the production of Qiling-badged pickups and minivans. In January 2018, JMCGL officially changed its name to Jiangxi Dorcen Motor Company. JMCG got a 19% of its shares, Fuzhou High-tech Zone Development Investment Group a 14% and Dorcen Motor Co., Ltd. a controlling 67%. In September 2018, Dorcen Motor Co., Ltd. unveiled its new marque, Dorcen, with three models: the electric city car E20 (based on the Zotye Domy Sesam), the mid-sized crossover G70S (based on the Zotye Domy X7) and the G60S compact crossover (a self-developed model). The G70S was immediately put on sale and the E20 later that year. A second Fuzhou plant for the assembly of the G60/G60S crossover was completed in December 2018. Facilities Dorcen has plants for assembly in Jiangsu and Jiangxi. The Jiangsu plant, established in 2015 by Zotye and the Jintan Auto Group, is located in the Jintan District of Changzhou. Dorcen has two plants in Jiangxi: the former JMCGL one, aimed at producing pickups and minivans, and the Jiangxi Dorcen Automotive Technology Industrial Park, established in December 2018. The marque has a 1000-people research and development facility that collaborates with META Power Labs, FEV Power Labs and Torino CREA Styling Centre. Branding According to Dorcen, the logo represents a multiplication sign and \\"embodies the concepts of openness, integration and interoperability\\". The company also said the marque name refers to \\" multiplication\\". The vehicle nomenclature for its G-series models is described by the company as \\"SE0\\". The S final-badged (like the G60S) models stand for \\"super\\" and are the ones with more equipment, the E final-badged (like the G60E) stand for \\"electric\\" and are the electric ones. The models without a final letter are the more basic ones. Products Dorcen mainly sells crossovers based on Zotye Domy and Hanteng products. Dorcen also sells products from the related Qiling () pickup marque (T5 and T7). In June 2018, Jiangxi Dorcen unveiled a Qiling-badged light, forward control truck named as the H300, based on the Isuzu N-series.

It is approximately west of Redmond, Oregon, United States. The waterfall is named for Cass A. Cline, who owned the land adjacent to the falls in the early 20th century. The falls occur just north of the point where Oregon Route 126 crosses the Deschutes River. The riparian area around Cline Falls provides habitat for a variety of fish and wildlife species.  Characteristics  Cline Falls is one of the highest waterfalls along the Deschutes River in Central Oregon. It is a steep segmented cascade. The falls drop approximately through several channels carved into the basalt cliff that cuts crosses the riverbed. The falls are approximately wide with an average flow of . However, the flow over the falls varies throughout the year as a result of irrigation water being taken out of the river above the falls during the summer. The falls have a forward run of about , descending at 77-degree angle through the cataract.\\"Cline Falls\\", Northwest Waterfall Survey, Seattle, Washington, accessed 6 February 2019.Sachs, Peter, \\"Warning signs might be added above Cline Falls\\", The Bulletin, Bend, Oregon, 10 July 2007. Based on the International Waterfall Classification System, Cline Falls is rated at 2.83, making it a Class-3 waterfall. The International Waterfall Classification System is a logarithmic scale that groups waterfalls into ten classes based on the height and pitch of the waterfall as well as the average volume of water flowing over the falls.Beisel, Richard H., International Waterfall Classification System, Outskirts Press, Parker, Colorado, 2006. Cline Falls is west of Redmond, Oregon. It is just north of the Deschutes River bridge along Route 126. There is a view point above the falls, just off the Cline Falls Highway, which runs north and south along the west rim of the Deschutes River canyon. On the east side of the river, there is a short hiking trail to the falls from the parking area at Cline Falls State Park.Witty, Jim, \\"Cline Butte\\", The Bulletin, Bend, Oregon, 17 March 2006.  History  The falls are named in honor of Doctor Cass A. Cline, a pioneer dentist and property developer from Redmond. Cline owned the falls and much of the adjacent property along the west bank of the river.McArthur, Lewis A. and Lewis L. McArthur, \\"Cline Falls\\", Oregon Geographic Names (Seventh Edition), Oregon Historical Society Press, Portland, Oregon, 2003, p. 210. In 1892, he founded the Falls Irrigation Company to help develop the area along the Deschutes.\\"Will Irrigate\\", Statesman Journal, Salem, Oregon, 6 February 1892, p. 4. A decade later, Cline established a small town called Cline Falls on the west bank of the river overlooking the waterfall. A community post office was opened in 1904. The town declined after 1911 when the area's first railroad was built on the east side of the river. The town‚Äôs post office was closed in 1919.Hole, Leslie Pugmire and Trish Pinkerton, \\"Building a Community\\", Images of America: Redmond, Arcadia Publishing, Chicago, Illinois, 2009, p. 28.Brogan, Phil F., East of the Cascades, Binfords and Mort, Portland, Oregon, 1965, pp. 147‚Äì148. In the early 20th century, Cline Falls was used for hydroelectric power production. In 1901, Cline sold a site next to the falls to F.T. Hurlburt, president of Condon National Bank. Hurlburt then financed the construction of a power plant to provide electricity for Redmond and nearby Prineville. The power was also used to run pumps that provided irrigation water to local farms and ranches. The power plant was purchased by the Pacific Power and Light Company. Over the years, large amounts of water were diverted from the Deschutes River above the falls for irrigation. This significantly reduced the river's flow at the falls, making steady power production difficult. *\\"Cline Falls\\", Bend Bulletin, Bend Oregon, 11 September 1907, p. 8. *\\"Cline Falls Power Site\\", Crook County Journal, Prineville, Oregon, 26 December 1912, p. 1. *\\"The Tax Payer Angle\\", Bend Bulletin, Bend Oregon, 14 October 1940, p. 4. By the 1960s, there was nothing left of the Cline Falls community except the abandoned power plant. The power plant building was demolished in 2015, and the plant's dam and diversion canal were removed in 2017. This increased the flow over the natural waterfall course and improved the riparian habitat for creatures in and around the river. *Shorack, Ted, \\"Deschutes River at Cline Falls to flow freely once again\\", The Bulletin, Bend, Oregon, December 10, 2015. *\\"Removal of Cline Falls Dam on Deschutes Underway\\", KTVZ.COM news, Bend, Oregon, 31 July 2017. *Hamway, Stephen, \\"Dam removal underway near Redmond ‚Äì 107-year-old Cline Falls Dam served war effort, a nonexistent town\\", The Bulletin, Bend, Oregon, August 2, 2017.  Environment and ecology  The stretch of the Deschutes River around Cline Falls runs through a basalt rimrock canyon with a narrow band of wetlands on either side of the channel. The canyon environment is dominated by western juniper with ponderosa pine in some areas. The most common ground cover plants near the falls are sagebrush and bitterbrush. Sagebrush is found from the canyon rim to the river shoreline. The riparian wetlands along the river bank support willow, alder, locust, and poplar trees.

It was first unveiled in 1916 and was listed on state and federal registers of historic places in 1994. Description and original location This piece is one of several erected across the United States by Gutzon Borglum, in his quest to institute \\"art that is real and American\\". The work commemorates the Connecticut Puritans who established the city in 1666. It is marble stele with a relief of two male Pilgrims in conversation overlooking a well or spring; above that is a narrow frieze that is a series of images representing Pilgrims in daily life. The stele rests in the center of a flat rectangular stone base, at the foot of which is a fountain basin. The back of the stele is engraved with the names of Newark's founders. The sculpture is tall and weighs . The monument is alternatively known as the Pilgrim Drinking Fountain and the Bridge Memorial. It marks the spot where the Passaic River and an early road converged, which became the site of the original colonial market.Thurlow, Fearn, \\"Newark's Sculpture: A survey of public monuments and memorial statuary,\\" The Newark Museum Quarterly, Winter 1975, vol. 6, no. 1, The First Landing Party of the Founders of Newark was originally located in Landing Place Park, at the foot of Saybrook Place near the Park Place station of the Hudson and Manhattan Railroad. Newark works by Borglum and historic designation First Landing Party of the Founders of Newark is one of four public art works created by Gutzon Borglum that are located in Newark, the others being Seated Lincoln (1911), Indian and the Puritan (1916), and Wars of America (1926). The four pieces were added to the New Jersey Register of Historic Places on September 13, 1994, and the National Register of Historic Places on October 28, 1994 as part of a Multiple Property Submission, \\"The Public Sculpture of John de la Mothe Gutzon Borglum, 1911‚Äì1926\\". Misplacement and restoration The sculpure went missing for more than a decade. When the New Jersey Performing Arts Center (NJPAC) was being built in the 1990s Saybrook Place was eliminated and the statue was moved two blocks north to Lombardy Park. When the Newark Light Rail was constructed in 2002 it was moved again. The circumstances are unclear, but it was brought to a lot at the city's Division of Traffic and Signals, where it was all but forgotten. Interest was aroused in anticipation of Newark's 350th anniversary of its founding. Restoration was funded by the Essex County Board of Freeholders, the Open Space Trust Fund, the Hyde & Watson Foundation, and individual donors. It was rededicated in 2016 on a grassy knoll near the NJPAC/Center Street station of the Newark Light Rail.

Biography Jos√© Curry da C√¢mara Cabral was born in S√£o Mamede, Lisbon on 4 May 1844, the son of Alberto Curry da C√¢mara Cabral and his wife, Mariana Adelaide Runquist Cabral. His paternal family was from Faial Island, in the Azores, and descended from Andrew Curry, a British subject who had settled in the Azores in the 18th century, establishing familial relations with influent local families, namely the Arriagas. Curry Cabral was baptized in the Parish Church of S√£o Mamede, on 16 May 1844.Livro de Registo de Baptismos 1820/1844 (fl.324), Par√≥quia de S√£o Mamede, Lisboa - Arquivo Nacional da Torre do Tombo Curry Cabral lived most of his life in Lisbon, where he enrolled in the city's in 1864. A brilliant student, he defended his thesis on 23 July 1869, titled \\"As feridas articulares e a cirurgia conservadora\\" (\\"Articular injuries and conservative surgery\\"), which was later published. Curry Cabral started working at Saint Joseph's Hospital on 7 February 1870, as an emergency room surgeon, promoted on 10 December 1874 to the post of surgeon extraordinary. On 2 July 1885, he was put in charge of an infirmary until he was named the Hospital's Chief Infirmerer (Enfermeiro-Mor) in 1900; he was only dismissed from this post following the 5 October 1910 revolution, to be replaced by Augusto de Vasconcelos. In this leadership post, Curry Cabral staged a reform of the hospital's administrative system, and saw that new inpatient care guidelines were enforced in all the hospitals in the country. Also one of his first preoccupations was the creation of a Division of Medical Statistics, from which we can still today have a glimpse at the casuistry of early 20th- century Lisbon surgeons. In addition to his work at Saint Joseph's, he also worked as a head surgeon at Queen Stephanie's Hospital. His academic career started with a nomination, on 11 December 1873, to curate the Medical-Surgical School's Museum of Anatomy. He became a professor in 1876, teaching Surgery (\\"Operatory Medicine\\") and Anatomical Pathology. King Carlos I of Portugal, during the unveiling of the new building of the Lisbon Medical-Surgical School, in April 1906. He published several scientific works, and was one of the editors of the weekly medical journal Medicina Contempor√¢nea (\\"Contemporary Medicine\\") in 1883. His notoriety as a scientist and professor led to several memberships in national and foreign scientific societies such as the Societ√© d'Hygiene de Paris and the Lisbon Royal Academy of Sciences. He served as President of the Lisbon Society of Medical Sciences from 1898 to 1900. He was also a member of the country's Superior Council of Public Instruction, an executive of the National Assistance to the Tuberculous, and a member of the Superior Council of Health and Public Hygiene. He was a great proponent for the establishment of a specialised hospital to treat tuberculosis and other communicable diseases: such an hospital was established in 1906, by Hintze Ribeiro's Regenerator government, in a plot of land that had originally belonged to an old Franciscan nunnery, the Convent of Our Lady of Sorrows. The hospital was at first known as Rego Hospital, named after the neighbourhood where it was located; in 1929 it was renamed Hospital Curry Cabral. In 1904, Curry Cabral was made a Commander of the Order of Saint James of the Sword. Works In addition to his numerous papers and scientific lectures published in specialised journals, he authored the following works: * As feridas articulares e a cirurgia conservadora, a proposito de um caso observado na enfermaria de clinica da Escola Medico-Cirurgica de Lisboa (Lisbon: Typ.

The Constitutional Congress of Costa Rica was the unicameral parliament of the country for most of its history. It was established in the Political Constitution of 1871. It consisted of 43 deputies and 18 alternates elected proportionally by provinces at the rate of one deputy for every 15,000 inhabitants with, among other powers, being able to choose the President in case none of the candidates obtained the minimum required to be elected, as happened in the 1913 election, the first election that were held with direct popular vote, and in which none of the candidates; M√°ximo Fern√°ndez Alvarado, Carlos Dur√°n Cart√≠n and Rafael Yglesias Castro, gathered enough votes to win in the first round. It was therefore the responsibility of the Congress to choose the president from among the candidates, but all of them withdrew their name and Alfredo Gonz√°lez Flores was chosen. After the controversial election of 1948 in which both the opposition and the ruling party proclaimed themselves victors and accused the other side of electoral fraud, the Constitutional Congress dominated by the ruling party annulled the presidential elections (but not the parliamentary elections where the ruling coalition had been favored) and civil war broke out. The opposition defeated the government of Teodoro Picado Michalski and called upon a new Constitutional Assembly that drafted the 1949 Constitution. This created the Legislative Assembly of Costa Rica, also unicameral and made up of 45 deputies later increased to 57, so that the Constitutional Congress ceases to exist.

This plant was described in 1807 by Weber and Mohr.  Description  Andreaea rothii gametophytes sometimes form extensive black to brown cushion-like patches, with individual shoots erect and less than 2 cm tall. The leaves of Andreaea rothii are 1-2 cm wide, and have a strong costa, which is roughly synonymous to a midrib. The leaves can be falcate-secund, curving to one side of the plant. This is especially true when wet, however the plants do not alter much when dry. The outline of the leaf is pear-shaped, swelling at the base and tapering to a tip, and can also be strongly curved depending on subspecies.  Distribution  Andreaea rothii grows on rocks that are wet, acidic, and exposed. This species is found anywhere from areas of high elevation to sea- level.  Reproduction  Andreae rothii gametophytes can be gonioautoicous-- meaning the antheridia are bud-like in the axil of an archegonial branch--or cladautoicous--meaning the antheridia and archegonia are found on different branches of the same plant. Like all of the Andreaeaceae, sporangia are elevated on a pseudopodium, a structure resembling a seta but composed of gametophyte tissue rather than sporophyte tissue. The sporangia will dehisce longitudinally, forming slits through which spores are dispersed. This pattern of dehiscence gives the genus its common name: \\"Lantern mosses\\".

Her work is included in the collection of the Museum of Fine Arts Houston and the High Museum of Art.  Life  Arlonzia Pettway was raised on the Pettway Plantation by her father and mother until 1941 when her father died. At 18, she and her brother Ike took over the responsibilities of the farm after their father's death. They primarily raised cotton, corn, peas, and sweet potatoes. Later, they also raised cucumbers and turnips for a company in Montgomery. In 1940, Pettway's childhood log-cabin style home was replaced with a \\"project house\\" by the federal government. It included three bedrooms, a kitchen, dining room, and two bathrooms with no running water. The family did not get indoor plumbing until 1974, nor electricity until 1964. They bought their first telephone in 1976. Pettway married Jennie Pettway's son, Bizzell, when she was 20 years old.

She served as editor for several leading magazines and did freelance work for literary groups including The Atlantic Monthly, The American Mercury, and The New York Times magazine. Hopkins published polemical pieces in both mainstream and special-interest journals on labor reform, dress reform, birth control, pacifism, vegetarianism, and suffrage. Her creative writing was shaped by her politics as she wrote poems and novels about peace, women's suffrage, and other social issues.  Early life  Hopkins was born in Bangor, Maine, in 1876. Her father George H. Hopkins was a banker and she grew up in a home that was described by Hopkins as ‚Äúmonogamous, Republican, and Protestant.‚Äù Her mother Mary Allen Webster Hopkins was considered to be extremely sensitive to responsibility and hated routine duties but her conscience forced her to perform them anyway and she may have been suffering from mental illness (\\"nervous prostration\\") long before it was recognized by medical professionals, so both the mother and daughter thought that taking care of Mary as a child was what made her mother sick. Hopkins assumed as a child that she was to blame for her mother's unhappiness. and early in her life she decided that the least she could do for her parents was to earn her own living to ‚Äúlessen [her] sense of guilt in living at all.‚Äù Hopkins learned about eighteenth-century England as her father had an extensive library. She was engaged to an unnamed man, but her parents disapproved of her potential husband, so he went to work in the city to get more wealth for her parents‚Äô approval while Hopkins stayed behind to work in Bangor. However, Hopkins found out that her fianc√© had married a woman whom he met in the city and had been living with. Later on, Hopkins studied at Wellesley College and at Columbia University where she earned her master's degree.  U.S. women's suffrage involvement  After her studies, Hopkins entered New York activist circles as a journalist and essayist, publishing works in both mainstream and special- interest journals on labor reform, dress reform, birth control, pacifism, vegetarianism, and suffrage. Her creative writing, poems and fiction were shaped by her politics. Hopkins published creative works and journalistic pieces in advocacy journals such as The Woman‚Äôs Journal, The Suffragist, and The Woman Voter, radical periodicals such as The Masses, and middlebrow journals such as Harper‚Äôs, Collier‚Äôs, and Scribner‚Äôs, as well as mainstream newspapers and presses like the New York Tribune. After the United States declared war on Germany in April 1917, the Woman's Peace Party (WPP) supported US intervention except for the New York branch of the party (NYC-WPP). The NYC-WPP's anti-war sentiments appeared in their bi-weekly periodical Four Lights with a gender-based critique of American society and democracy. On July 14, 1917, Hopkins, a member of the NYC-WPP along with other young educated radical reformers, wrote an editorial for Four Lights titled, ‚ÄúWhat are the War Aims and Peace terms of the American Women?‚Äù Hopkins mocked women's involvement in war work in two ways. She first argued against the assumption that women's presumed roles as mothers and wives would prevent them from participating in politics. Secondly, she argued that the work that women did in their lives such as raising their children would end up being pointless because war would lead to the oppression and death of their children in battle. After the United States Department of Justice (DOJ) claimed that two of their issues were traitorous, the post office refused delivery of the journal, the DOJ interrogated the women as the NYC-WPP's anti-war sentiments were seen as unpatriotic, and Four Lights ceased production in October 1917.

Later in her forties, Hopkins lost faith in protest and rebellion as she noticed that the radicals fighting against these institutions ‚Äúget no more satisfaction than did the conformists and smugness seemed equally common among both extremes.‚Äù Along with the stopped publication of the Four Lights, the mixed results that activists got led to the question of ‚Äúwill it work‚Äù becoming her moral code. She insisted that it was ‚Äúnobody‚Äôs fault‚Äù that ‚Äùmen got the good jobs‚Äù and that ‚Äúvirtuous women shriveled at their desks.‚Äù Hopkins‚Äô was uncertain whether life would improve for the younger generation of women coming after her since it took her a longer time for her to reach where she was in her career at that point in her forties compared to a man who got to same place in less time. Near the end of her life, she lived in Newtown, Connecticut. Hopkins died on November 8, 1960, in Danbury, Connecticut. She is buried at Mount Hope Cemetery in Bangor, Maine.  Legacy  On August 4, 2016, the Bangor Historical Society hosted a lecture event in the Isaac Farrar Mansion with a descendant of Mary Alden Hopkins, Bill Hopkins where he spoke about his research into Mary Alden Hopkins‚Äô past upbringing and the impact she left behind as a journalist, suffragette, author, and feminist.

Early Life  Born in 1928 in Alberta, Alabama, Young was one of twelve children born to Lula and Albert Pettway. Albert Pettway grew cotton, corn, peas, sweet potatoes, and sorghum cane. Young mostly worked in the house with her mother cooking, cleaning, or tending to their personal garden. Young attended school until the 7th grade. The school she and her siblings attended was eight miles away from their home and required them to walk arduously the entire way. Young began quilting at approximately age 13, when her father brought home scraps of fabric from Camden. Young married Lucius Young at age 16, and they had nine children. Lucius died in a car accident in 1970. Thereafter, Young began to cook and perform housework for a white family in Gastonburg, Alabama. Work Young never joined the Freedom Quilting Bee because, in her words, \\"When they open up the quilting bee up there, they didn't want the kind of sewing and piecing I do, and I didn't like what they was doing.

So I never did have nothing to do with them.\\" In 2006 her quilt Blocks and Strips appeared on a US Postal service stamp as part of a series commemorating Gee's bend quilters.

The family settled near Ashton two years later.  Career  Hipple learned shorthand and worked as a stenographer at the South Dakota state capital. She married state auditor John Elmer Hipple in 1896. Hipple was an active proponent of women's suffrage. In support of the suffrage movement, Hipple worked as an auditor and press secretary. She was a member of the South Dakota Universal Franchise League's Legislative Committee in 1912. Starting in 1913, Hipple was an editor for the South Dakota Messenger, a publication for suffragists. Hipple and her husband frequently opened their home to suffragists traveling to Pierre. For six months after the United States entered World War I, Hipple worked for the Red Cross and served on the executive committee for Pierre's Red Cross. Hipple's residence in Pierre and her political connections allowed her to provide information to suffragists in South Dakota. Hipple received advance notice from Governor Peter Norbeck that he was considering adding a special session for the legislature. Hipple passed that information along to South Dakota Franchise League's president Mamie Shields Pyle. Hipple started the local chapter of the Girl Scouts in Pierre.

A basaltic lava flow traveled down the Sulphur Creek valley and across the Baker River valley; this is the most recent lava flow at Mount Baker. Future eruptions from Schriebers Meadow Cone are unlikely to occur as it is considered a short-lived feature. Schriebers Meadow Cone produced thick dark-reddish-brown to yellowish-red scoria that blankets the sides of the Sulphur Creek valley near and southeast of Schriebers Meadow. Near Schriebers Meadow the scoria deposit is thickest on the north valley wall and it decreases in grain size and thickness within short distances. Within of the cone the scoria fragments are as much as in diameter and the deposit is thick; to the northeast the fragments are of sand size and the deposit is no more than thick.

Corcoran was an American lawyer who served as District Attorney of Middlesex County, Massachusetts from 1913 to 1917. He later faced a number of criminal indictments and was convicted of one count of extortion. Early life Corcoran was born in Stoneham, Massachusetts. He graduated from Boston University Law School in 1903 and began practicing law the same year. In 1909 he moved from Stoneham to Cambridge, Massachusetts. District attorney In 1913, Corcoran won in an upset to be District Attorney of Middlesex County. He received 32,676 votes to Republican incumbent John J. Higgins' 30,684, with Progressive candidate Philip M. Clark receiving 25,242. Legal problems =Extortion charges= Suffolk County In June 1921, Massachusetts Attorney General J. Weston Allen accused Corcoran, Daniel H. Coakley, and others of conspiring with Middlesex County District Attorney Nathan A. Tufts to use the threat of criminal indictment to extort money from people. On September 29, 1921, the Boston Bar Association filed a petition for disbarment against Corcoran. On September 1, 1921, a former client, Scott Paul, sued Corcoran to recover a fair share of a $50,000 settlement he received. According to Paul, he only received $5,000 from Corcoran because Corcoran claimed the rest would barely cover expenses. Soon thereafter, the Boston Bar Association filed a petition for Corcoran's disbarment. Corcoran then moved to Port Chester, New York and attempted to resign from the Boston bar, but this request was refused and he was eventually disbarred. On December 27, 1921, Corcoran appeared in Suffolk County Superior Court and pled not guilty to charges of extortion and larceny. He was released on $10,000 bail. He agreed to turn over state's evidence in its case against Suffolk County District Attorney Joseph C. Pelletier, however he did not receive immunity and The Boston Globe reported that his motive was \\"an impulse of savage revenge\\" towards another lawyer. Corcoran's trial was to begin on November 1, 1922, but he failed to appear in court. A default judgment against Corcoran was obtained on July 11, 1923. On July 25, 1923, Corcoran was arrested in the lobby of the Knickerbocker Building. At the time of his arrest, Corcoran was living in a room on 23rd Street and traveling frequently to avoid capture. He was held in The Tombs until his extradition to Massachusetts on July 31. His trial began on October 17. On November 9, Judge Joseph F. Quinn was seriously injured in a fall and could not continue to preside over the case. As a result, a mistrial was declared on November 19 and a second trial was scheduled for January 7. This trial too ended in a mistrial when a witness alleged that the jurors had been bribed. On May 20, 1924, Corcoran and Daniel H. Coakley were indicted on 11 charges of conspiracy to extort. They were found not guilty on July 3. His final trial in Suffolk County ended on January 9, 1925 when jurors were unable to come to an agreement on the guilt of Corcoran and Hartnett on a conspiracy to extort case. Middlesex County On February 5, 1924 Corcoran was indicted on blackmail charges in Middlesex County. On April 1 he was found guilty on one count of an indictment that charged him with extorting money from a married man in a Badger game. He was sentenced to 7 to 10 years in prison. He began his sentence on May 25, 1925 and was released on January 24, 1930. =Bond cases= On March 30, 1937, Corcoran was charged with violating the National Stolen Property Act by transporting $10,000 U.S. Treasury bond that had been stolen from a bank messenger in Louisville, Kentucky by a national bond theft gang. He was found not guilty on April 28.

A member of the Ban≈´ Tha·∏≥ƒ´f tribe, Ab≈´ Mi·∏•jan was a mukha·∏çram (non-Muslim) who took part in the defence of al-·π¨ƒÅ æif against Mu·∏•ammad in year 8 AH (630 AD). There he was wounded by an arrow fired by  øAbd AllƒÅh ibn Ab≈´ Bakr. In year 9 AH (631/2 AD), however, he converted to Islam and afterwards joined the Muslim conquest of Persia. He may have fought at the Battle of Vologesias in 633, but Mu·∏•ammad's second successor, Caliph  øUmar, ordered him into exile to a place called ·∏§a·∏çaw·∏ça. He escaped his escort, but was then imprisoned by ·π¢a ød ibn Abƒ´ Wa·∏≥·∏≥ƒÅ·π£ for drunkenness. ·π¢a ød's wife obtained his temporary release so that he could fight at the Battle of al-·∏≤ƒÅdisiyya in November 636.

He died not long after going into exile. According to tradition, his tomb could be seen either on the frontier of Gorgan or of Azerbaijan. The poetry of Ab≈´ Mi·∏•jan is unoriginal and chiefly of interest for its author's evident oenophilia. The line \\"When I die, bury me at the foot of a vine\\" is attributed to him, as are several poems challenging the ·∏≤ur æƒÅnic prohibition on alcohol.

Life  Martha Jane and her husband Little Pettway were outspoken civil rights leaders in the Gee's Bend community. They were the first family to receive a Roosevelt House and persuaded other Gee's bend families to participate in New Deal public assistance projects. Little Pettway was the community liaison that spearheaded the breakup and reassignment of negligent plantation owners' lands to the families of Gee's Bend. Through the Agricultural Adjustment Administration's reassignment of land, Martha Jane and her family received 75 acres of arable swamp and dry land. She often took her children and husband to marches in Selma during the civil rights movement. Together Martha Jane and Little raised fifteen children ‚Äì five boys and ten girls. She taught all of her daughters to quilt, which beget some exceptional quilters like Plummer T. Pettway. Her daughter-in-law, Louella Pettway, was also a skilled quilter. Martha Jane lived to be 103 and spent her latter years living in Mobile, Alabama.  Work  Martha Jane's quilts were a vital part of her children's comfort and warmth at home and were primarily made of repurposed work clothes. Most of her and her daughters' quilts would only last a year because they were being used so extensively by such a large family. Thus, it was important that all of her daughters learn to quilt and replenish the family's supplies.

History  The event was founded by Mike Fisher and Chris Bernhard of Saskatoon, who sought to provide a local alternative to out-of-province events in locations such as Alberta. The inaugural edition was held in 2013 as the Saskatchewan Entertainment Expo; major guests included William B. Davis, Grey DeLisle, and Kevin Conroy, as well as comic book writers Ian Boothby, Pia Guerra and Marcus To among others. To expand the event, the convention partnered with the Calgary Comic and Entertainment Expo in 2014, and was renamed the Saskatoon Comic and Entertainment Expo (SCEE). Notable guests that year included actor Robert Englund, Phil LaMarr, and Brandon Routh. William Shatner appeared at the 2015 edition; attendance had grown to around 15,000. Carrie Fisher attended in 2016. The parent company of Fan Expo ‚Äî which had also begun to run their own event at Regina's Evraz Place in 2014 ‚Äî acquired the organizers of Calgary Expo in late-2017. As a result, the partnership was disbanded, and the convention reverted to the Saskatchewan Entertainment Expo title in 2018. Doug Jones, Ron Perlman, Gates McFadden, Jim Cummings, John Ratzenberger, Julian Glover, Jewel Staite, Pat Mastroianni, and Stacie Mistysyn were featured as guests. Billy Dee Williams was scheduled to attend, but cancelled due to conflicts with film work; this cancellation resulted in speculation ‚Äî later confirmed ‚Äî that Williams would reprise the role of Lando Calrissian in the upcoming Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker. In October 2018, Fan Expo announced that its Regina event would be discontinued, citing the size of the market as a factor in the decision. Saskatchewan Entertainment Expo subsequently announced that it would hold an inaugural Regina edition in May 2019 as a de facto successor, at Evraz Place's International Trade Centre. Adrian Paul was announced as one of its first guests.
