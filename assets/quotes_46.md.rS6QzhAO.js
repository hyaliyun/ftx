Early life Kirima was born in Kiruri village, a tea- growing area of Murang‚Äôa County on the slopes of the Aberdares. He dropped out of school at an early age. Business Kirima relocated from his village to the Kinangop Plateau where he started a carpentry business. In the early 1960s after Kenya had attained independence, he moved to Nairobi and registered his business Kirima and Sons Ltd. He was the pioneer carpenter at the University of Nairobi and operated a small workshop in Bahati and later on in Kaloleni. His first wife, Agnes, would help attend to customers at the Kaloleni workshop. Taking advantage of the rural-urban migration to Nairobi that resulted from the dawn of independence and the end of the state of emergency, Kirima opened bars and butcheries in Asian and African neighborhoods to cater for the growing moneyed class. He is considered a pioneer of nyama choma, a popular Kenyan delicacy. By 1967, and to the surprise of the better educated African civil servants, Kirima had saved enough money to buy 500 acres of land in Nairobi from an Italian Donenico Masi. In the same year, Kirima bought two more farms in Nairobi - 108 acres from Charles Case and 472 acres from Percy Randall. With these acquisitions, Kirima had positioned himself to be a major meat supplier for Nairobi. As chairman of the African Butchers Association (later the Kenya National Butchers Union), he successfully lobbied the government for permission to sell meat in the city, a privilege that was hitherto reserved for the still settler-controlled Kenya Meat Commission (KMC) which did not buy meat from African farmers. Kirima started a private abattoir in Njiru, a development that some believe led to the eventual collapse of the KMC years later. He would venture into the transport business by launching the Kirima Bus Services. However, the business didn't last long following the liberalization of upcountry transportation by the government in 1973. He opted to focus on real estate mostly concentrating on building rental housing in the low income Eastlands area of Nairobi. Political career Kirima served for many years as a city councilor and briefly as deputy mayor. In 1989, Starehe Constituency Member of Parliament Kiruhi Kimondo was dismissed by his party KANU in 1989. By-elections were held the same year. Kirima contested the seat on a KANU ticket and won. He remained in office until the 1992 General Elections when he lost the seat to his predecessor Kimondo. Personal life Kirima had 3 wives, several children and many grandchildren. Death Diabetic and partially blind, Gerishon Kirima died on 28 December 2010 while undergoing treatment in South Africa. He was 80 years old.

Coins struck in the name of the emperor remained common well into the 6th century. Michael Frassetto, The Early Medieval World: From the Fall of Rome to the Time of Charlemagne vol. 1 \\"Coins and Coinage\\", p. 203. Europe in 814 AD The barbarian kingdoms were kingdoms dominated by northern European tribes established all over the Mediterranean after the Barbarian Invasions from late antiquity to the early middle ages. The term \\"barbarian\\" has been commonly used by historians. Other terms used include \\"Northern European kingdoms\\", \\"Romano-northern European kingdoms\\",Chris Wickham, Framing the Early Middle Ages: Europe and the Mediterranean 400-800, Oxford (2005). and \\"post-Roman kingdoms\\". Time frames Historically, the period of the Barbarian kingdoms spans the years from 409 to 910. It begins in 409 with several Barbarian kingdoms being established on the Iberian peninsula, including the Kingdom of the Suebi, the Alani Kingdom, and territories of Hasdingi and the Vandals. It ends with the partition of the Kingdom of Asturias in 910, a kingdom founded by a Visigothic nobleman Pelagius of Asturias on the Iberian peninsula that by the time of its dissolution had a majority speaking Vulgar Latin and only a scarce population speaking Visigothic and Vandalic varieties of the East Germanic languages. Kingdoms The most important and most successful of these kingdoms was that of the Franks. Established in the 4th to 5th century, the Frankish kingdom grew to include much of Western Europe, developing into the early medieval Carolingian Empire and ultimately the Kingdom of France and the Holy Roman Empire of the high medieval period and beyond. The Frankish Realm continued until 843, when it was partitioned. Realms resulting from this event included West Francia (predecessor of modern France), Middle Francia and East Francia (predecessor of modern Germany). Other major kingdoms included those of the Visigoths and Ostrogoths; both were established in the 5th century. The Ostrogothic kingdom was re-conquered by the Eastern Roman Empire in the 550s, while the Visigothic kingdom survived into the 8th century, but finally fell to the Muslim invasion of Hispania. The Kingdom of the Lombards in Italy was established in the 6th century and conquered by the Franks in 774. Various Anglo-Saxon kingdoms existed in medieval England. The Alemannic Kingdom was established in the 3rd century; it became a duchy subject to the Franks in 496, although this overlordship was at times nominal and Alemannia remained semi-independent until the 8th century. The Vandal Kingdom existed in Africa and Sicily from 435 until 534. The kingdoms of the Burgundians and of the Suebi were established in the early 5th century, and fell to the Franks and the Visigoths, respectively, in the 6th century. In the Eastern and Southeastern parts of Europe formatted dominant Barbarian states as the Hunnic Empire (370‚Äì469), the Avar Khaganate (567‚Äìafter 822), Old Great Bulgaria (632‚Äì668), the Khazar Khaganate (c. 650‚Äì969), Bulgaria (founded by Asparuh in 680), Volga Bulgaria (7th century‚Äì1240s) and Kievan Rus' (879‚Äì1240), all of them constantly rivaling the hegemony of the Byzantine Empire and the rest of Europe. Significance The barbarian kingdoms marked the transition from Late Antiquity to the Early Middle Ages in the 6th and 7th centuries, gradually replacing the Roman system of government on the lands of the Western Roman Empire, notably in the two western prefectures of Gaul and Italy.Kidner et al. (eds.), Making Europe: People, Politics, and Culture vol. 1 (2009), 198-203\\\\. J. Herrmann, E.- Z√ºrcher (eds.), History of Humanity: From the seventh century B.C. to the seventh century A.D., UNESCO (1996), p. 255. These kingdoms were ' of the Roman Empire, and even after the fall of the Western Roman Empire in AD 476 they continued to at least nominally consider themselves subject to the Eastern Emperor. These historical ties with the empire were weakened in the later 6th century, with the loss of much of the western possessions of the empire under Justin II and the waning power projection by the empire, weakened by its wars with the Persians and the Arab invasion. As a result, the \\"barbarian kingdoms\\" by the 7th to 8th centuries developed the system of feudalism characteristic of the European Middle Ages. The title of \\"emperor\\" was revived in the west by Charlemagne in AD 800\\\\. At the same time, the Carolingian Renaissance developed the notion of Europe as a geopolitical entity with a history separate from that of the wider Mediterranean region. Meanwhile, in Southeastern Europe was present the Byzantine Macedonian Renaissance (867‚Äì1056). Simeon I of Bulgaria was officially recognized as Emperor (Tsar in Bulgarian) of the Bulgarians by the Patriarch of Constantinople Nicholas in the Blachernae Palace.Fine, The Early Medieval Balkans, pp. 144‚Äì148. Similar to the proceses that occurred with Charlemagne and the Carolingian Renaissance, the reign of Sime√≥n I the Great and the Golden Age of medieval Bulgarian culture (889‚Äî927), the invention of the Cyrillic script and the use of Old Bulgarian as liturgical and written language, opened new horizons for Slavic states and people.

It was discovered on 27 September 1834 by astronomer John Herschel.  Observation history  When Herschel discovered the galaxy, he logged \\"faint, small, little extended, among several bright stars\\". After a second and third sweep, he noted an exact position which matches PGC 2206. As of such, the two objects are generally referred to as the same. The galaxy was later catalogued by John Louis Emil Dreyer in the New General Catalogue, where Herschel's original note was largely adopted, as the object was described as \\"extremely faint, small, very little extended, among bright stars\\".  Description  The galaxy appears very dim in the sky as it only has an apparent visual magnitude of approximately 14 and thus can only be observed with telescopes. It can be classified as type G using the Hubble Sequence. The object's distance of roughly 159 million light-years from the Solar System can be estimated using its redshift and Hubble's law.

It was first issued in the United States as a hardcover edition by G. P. Putnam's Sons, on November 4, 2004. Later in November 2005, it was issued in Canada and Europe in paperback format by Berkley Books. The book consists of twenty-seven poems and lyrics to songs from her studio albums Songs in A Minor (2001) and The Diary of Alicia Keys (2003). The book appeared on The New York Times Best Seller list and has generated over 500.000 dollars in sales. Another volume was planned for release in fall 2005. To promote the book, Keys appeared on The Early Show and at Barnes & Noble store where she signed copies of it. In 2006, she appeared on the television series Def Poetry Jam, citing the poem \\"P.O.W.\\". The book was re-released in October 2018 with a new cover.  Background and release In late 2003, Keys released her second studio album The Diary of Alicia Keys to commercial and critical success. Following was a tour from March to April 2004, The Verizon Ladies First Tour, that she co- headlined with Beyonc√© and Missy Elliott. In March 2004, it was reported that a dispute had broken out between literary agents Noah Lukeman and David Vigliano, with Lukeman claiming that he had the right over Vigliano to represent Keys for book publishers, possibly delaying the release of the book. In May 2004, it was announced that Keys had signed a deal to publish two books with G.P. Putnam's Sons, \\"Songbook\\" and \\"The Diary of Alicia Keys\\". The president of G.P. Putnam's Sons, Carole Baron, commented that \\"It isn't everyday you are offered the opportunity to publish someone as unbelievably talented as Alicia Keys. Her story is as inspiring as it is astonishing, and we are excited to be publishing her story, in her own words\\". Keys explained that \\"[the book] won't be exactly autobiography, but I love to read so much that I want to make sure the story is really powerful, like Catcher in the Rye or one of the books I love\\". The title of the book is derived from one of the poems, \\"Love and Chains\\", which contains the line: \\"I don't mind drinking my tears for water\\". In an interview with The Early Show, Keys further explained that: The poetry slam themed release party for the book was held at the Harlem Grill in New York City. The release party was hosted by Mums and featured appearances by Kanye West, Mos Def and Common.

History  Following the success with the compound locomotives of Class VIb V, corresponding locomotives were procured for hauling passenger trains. Based on the design of the Saxon IIIb the Saxon Engineering Works (S√§chsische Maschinenfabrik) built a compound engine. In the years 1889 and 1892 a total of 18 units of the IIIb V were built for passenger train duties. Because the engines apparently did not prove themselves, no further orders were placed. In 1920, the Deutsche Reichsbahn took over some of the locomotives, but only two remaining engines were included in the new numbering scheme in 1924: numbers 34 7901 and 34 7902.  Design features  The locomotives had a boiler made from three shell rings with a semi-circular cover which, in the area of the firebox, was tucked in it between the frame plates. The boiler was fed by two non-sucking injectors. The steam engine was designed as a twin-cylinder compound engine with interior Allan valve gear. The high-pressure cylinder was placed on the right, the larger, low-pressure cylinder on the left. They drove the second coupled axle. The driving axles were fixed in the frame, the leading carrying wheels were designed as a Novotny-Klien axle. The locomotives left the factory equipped with Schleifer compressed air brakes; these only braked the engine, however. Later, all the locomotives were fitted with Westinghouse air brakes.

The sixth sonata, BWV 530, is the only one for which all three movements were specially composed for the collection. When played on an organ, the second manual part is often played an octave lower on the keyboard with appropriate registration. Commentators have suggested that the collection might partly have been intended for private study to perfect organ technique, some pointing out that its compass allows it to be played on a pedal clavichord.See: The collection of sonatas is generally regarded as one of Bach's masterpieces for organ. The sonatas are also considered to be amongst his most difficult compositions for the instrument. Origins and purpose =Instructional manual= Covering page for the autograph manuscript of the organ sonatas, written some years later by the musician Georg Poelchau The organ sonatas were first gathered together in Leipzig in an autograph manuscript which Bach scholars have dated to a period roughly between 1727 and 1730. Apart from the heading with the numbering of the six sonatas and an indication of where the manuscript ends, Bach himself left no further specifications. After Bach's death, the musician Georg Poelchau (1773‚Äì1836) produced a covering page for the collection (along with the Great Eighteen Chorale Preludes) with a title and commentary. The sonatas were described by Bach's biographer Johann Nikolaus Forkel as follows:See:  ::Six sonatas or trios for two keyboards with obbligato pedal. ::Bach composed them for his eldest son, Willhelm Friedemann, who, ::by practising them, prepared himself to be the great organist ::he later became. It is impossible to say enough about their beauty. ::They were written when the composer was in his full maturity and ::can be considered his principal work of this kind. Poelchau's commentary on the covering page is a direct quotation of this passage from Forkel. Silbermann Organ (1718‚Äì1720) in the Sophienkirche, where Wilhelm Friedemann Bach became organist in 1733 Sophienkirche, Dresden, 1800 The organ sonatas represent the culmination of Bach's collections of keyboard works with a partly didactic purpose, from the point of both playing and composition. Although intended initially for Bach's eldest son Wilhelm Friedemann Bach, they also became part of the staple repertoire of his students. The keyboard collections include the Orgelb√ºchlein, the two and three part inventions, the first book of the Well Tempered Clavier, the French Suites and the Six partitas (Clavier‚Äì√úbung I). Two main sources are known for the collection of sonatas. The first autograph score‚Äîpossibly not the original composing score‚Äîis on paper with a watermark that allows it to be dated to the period 1727‚Äì1730. The second \\"fair copy\\" was started by Wilhelm Friedemann and completed by Bach's second wife Anna Magdalena. In addition there are numerous other later copies by the circle of Bach, including copies of the first movement of BWV 527 and the slow movement of BWV 529 made by Bach's former pupil from Weimar, Johann Caspar Vogler. From these surviving manuscripts of the collection and the circumstances surrounding its composition‚Äîincluding Wilhelm Friedemann's future career (as a law student in Leipzig and then as organist of the Sophienkirche in Dresden) and Bach's renewed interest in the obbligato organ in his third cycle of cantatas‚Äîthe date when the collection was compiled can be roughly set at a time between 1727 and 1730, although without any precision. =Genesis of collection= From the two main sources, from Bach's knowledge of works by other composers and from his own compositions for organ and instrumental ensemble that predate the collection, it is possible to gain a partial idea of how the collection was put together and how the genre of the Bach organ trio evolved. Some of the movements had precursors either as organ works or chamber works: only the last sonata BWV 530 had all its movements newly composed. The only other movements that are known with certainty to have been newly composed are the slow movement of BWV 525 and the first movement of BWV 529; the last movement of BWV 529 probably also falls into this category but might be a transcription of a lost instrumental trio sonata from Bach's periods in C√∂then and Weimar. Although Hans Eppstein has suggested that several movements might be transcriptions of lost chamber works, the writing for organ is often so idiosyncratic that his hypothesis can apply to at most a few movements. Autograph manuscript of sinfonia starting second part of cantata Die Himmel erz√§hlen die Ehre Gottes, BWV 76, 1723 First page of Bach's Nekrolog in Mizler's Musikalische Bibliothek, 1754 There are six movements known with reasonable certainty to date from earlier compositions. Four movements have previous versions as organ compositions: *the first movement of BWV 525; *the first movement of BWV 527; *the slow movement of BWV 528; *the slow movement of BWV 529. Two movements are known to be transcriptions of instrumental trios: *The slow movement of the BWV 527 is a reworking of a lost instrumental work which was also re-used later in the slow movement of the triple concerto for flute, violin and harpsichord, BWV 1044. This arrangement has been ascribed to the period 1729‚Äì1740 when Bach was director of the Collegium Musicum in Leipzig, an association of town musicians that mounted concerts in the Caf√© Zimmermann. *The first movement of BWV 528 is a transcription of the sinfonia that begins the second part of the cantata Die Himmel erz√§hlen die Ehre Gottes, BWV 76, scored for oboe d'amore, viola da gamba and continuo. , designated BWV 528a, is a reconstruction of an entire trio sonata for the same combination of instruments using the remaining two movements. The lost work is thought to date to Bach's period in Weimar. Pieter Dirksen's edition allows the performers a choice of three possible keys: G minor; E minor; or a mixture of the two. Some individual movements were associated with other organ works of Bach: the earlier version of the slow movement of BWV 529‚Äîthe most elaborate and skilfully written of the slow movements‚Äîwas paired with the Prelude and Fugue in C major, BWV 545; and the last movement of BWV 528 was paired with the Prelude and Fugue in G major, BWV 541. It is now thought that these pairings originated in Bach's Leipzig period. One problem in deciding on how the collection came about is that many instrumental works on which the organ sonatas might have been based have been lost. Such chamber works are mentioned by Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach in his 1754 Nekrolog and many are thought to have been composed in C√∂then. has suggested this might reflect the fact that, after Bach's death, his vocal works passed to Wilhelm Friedemann and Carl Philipp Emanuel who guaranteed their survival; while the chamber works, very few of which survive, were mostly inherited by Bach's younger sons Johann Christian Bach and Johann Christoph Friedrich Bach. Corrections in the autograph manuscript and a detailed analysis of stylistic elements in the sonatas have led to suggest that the sonatas were composed in their final state in two distinct groups. The first group, consisting of the first, third and fourth sonatas, has first and last movements which have a fugal character and as close stylistic relation. The second group, consisting of the second, fifth and sixth sonatas where the bulk of composing corrections occur have a concerto-like form, with contrasting tutti and concertato sections in the opening movements and fugal final movements. Even in the second \\"fair copy\\" produced by Wilhelm Friedemann and Anna Magdalena, Bach made corrections in three movements (in the first, fifth and sixth sonatas).See: , preface by Pieter Dirksen * =Origins of organ trio= Although Bach created a unique compositional genre in this collection of sonatas, the roots of the organ trio can be traced back to the works of earlier composers and some of Bach's own earlier compositions for organ. Bach had in his possession many organ works by seventeenth century French organists such as Boyvin, Cl√©rambault, Grigny, Leb√®gue and Raison who wrote trios, trios en dialogue and trios √† trois claviers for two manuals and pedal, with distinctive registrations for each manual keyboard. Bach's sonatas however, with their binary or ritornello form, owe very little to these French organ trios. Start of Versus III of Nun lob, mein Seel, BuxWV 213, Dieterich Buxtehude Allein Gott in der H√∂h' sei Ehr, BWV 664a, in hand copy by Johann Tobias Krebs Earlier models for Bach's type of organ trio occurred in the first versions of the trios in the Great Eighteen Chorale Preludes, particularly Allein Gott in der H√∂h' sei Ehr, BWV 664a, and Herr Jesu Christ, dich zu uns wend, BWV 655a. Both these chorale preludes were written towards the end of Bach's years in Weimar. Both BWV 664a and BWV 655a follow the pattern of the Italian trio sonata for two violins involving invertible counterpoint. In a more rudimentary form, trios of this kind already appeared in German organ music in a few of the freely composed chorale preludes of Buxtehude, van Noordt, Armsdorff and Georg B√∂hm, Bach's teacher from L√ºneburg. In the two chorale preludes of Bach, the organ trio became fully developed into a concerto-like fast movement: they are written in ritornello form, with the theme in the bass as well as the upper parts, which are written imitatively with virtuosic episodes. The first version of the slow movement of BWV 528 also dates from roughly the same period: instead of the larger scale structure of the two chorale preludes, the musical material is broken up into imitative two bar phrases, often of bewitching beauty. Although no longer having any liturgical references (in particular no cantus firmus), the sonatas BWV 525‚Äì530 preserve the concerto-like quality of the two Weimar chorale preludes; like them the manual and pedal parts are written within an idiom particular to the organ rather than that of solo instruments like the violin or flute. On the other hand, there is very little similarity between the compositional style of the organ sonatas and that of Bach's organ transcriptions of instrumental concertos by Vivaldi and other composers.See: With their chamber music quality, the organ sonatas have clear affinities with Bach's sonatas for obbligato harpsichord and solo instrument‚Äîviolin, viola da gamba and flute, also composed or compiled in Leipzig. They are all written in trio sonata form with binary and ritornello movements. Moreover, the collection of six sonatas for obbligato harpsichord and violin, BWV 1014‚Äì1019 seems to have involved a similar survey, recording all possible ways of writing for the instrumental combination. There are, however, significant differences: *the organ sonatas are conceived more in concerto form with three movements, whereas the instrumental sonatas have four or more movements like a sonata da chiesa; *the instrumental sonatas do not preserve a strict equality between the upper part‚Äîthere is often a distinction between material for the melody instrument and the keyboard part, which can play a purely continuo-like role; *in the instrumental sonatas, either part can be divided, with the addition of an extra voice or double stopping; *while movements from the instrumental sonatas can be diffuse and expansive‚Äîpossibly because more musical textures are available‚Äîmovements in the organ sonatas are in general less concerned with texture, clearer in form, and more concise and succinct, sometimes to the extent of seeming like miniatures. Probably the closest similarities between the instrumental sonatas and the organ sonatas occur in their fugal final movements in every aspect‚Äîtexture, melody and structure. The distinction between sonata types was subsequently delineated by Scheibe, who introduced the term Sonate auf Concertenart to contrast with the sonata da chiesa (see below), but there are as many exceptions to the rule as adherences. Commentators agree that the collection of organ sonatas marks one of the later stages in Bach's development of the trio form.See:  One of the main composers to develop the purely instrumental trio sonata was Bach's contemporary Georg Philipp Telemann, godfather to Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach and his predecessor as Kapellmeister in Hamburg. One of the only features that Telemann adopted from the older French tradition of the trio sonata was the adaptability of the instrumentation. Telemann's Six Concerts et Six Suites (1715‚Äì1720) could be played on two or three instruments (with an optional viola da gamba or cello). Some movements in the Concerts occasionally show similarities in texture and form with Bach's organ sonatas: gives the following example from the second half of the second movement of Concert IV for flute and harpsichord in E minor, TWV 42:e3. Harpsichord part of second half of second movement of Telemann's Concert IV engraved in Hamburg in 1734 by Telemann himself ::400px Some of the other movements of the Concerts have been cited by and as examples of the Sonate auf Concertenart. Later organ sonatas by Bach's student Johann Ludwig Krebs show a clear influence of Bach and closely imitate his style; conversely the newer galant style of writing, popular among Krebs' generation, can be discerned in some movements of BWV 525‚Äì530, for example the slow movement of the fourth sonata. Several organ trios written by Bach's students survive and are discussed in detail in and by Dirksen in .See:  * =Performance practice= J. Verscheure Reynvaan: engraving of an eighteenth-century pedal clavichord and have noted that the compass of the keyboard parts of Bach's BWV 525‚Äì530 rarely go below the tenor C, so they could have been played on a single manual pedal clavichord, by moving the left hand down an octave, a customary practice in the 18th century. =Sonaten auf Concertenart= Johann Adolph Scheibe Title page of the revised edition of Scheibe's Critischer Musikus The music theoretician and organist Johann Adolph Scheibe, a former pupil of Bach, was one of the first people in Germany to describe musical genres, such as the sonata, concerto and sinfonia. He had mixed views on Bach's compositions. He was extremely critical of some of Bach's organ works because of their complexity, comparing Bach's \\"artful\\" counterpoint unfavourably with the \\"natural\\" melodies of the organist-composer Johann Mattheson, another musical commentator who since 1730 had become a staunch critic of Bach. In 1737 Scheibe wrote that Bach \\"deprived his pieces of all that was natural by giving them a bombastic and confused character, and eclipsed their beauty by too much art.\\" About the trio sonatas, however, Scheibe had only praise as he considered that they fitted into his theory of the Sonaten auf Concertenart‚Äî\\"sonatas in concerto style\\". In his treatise Critischer Musikus (1740-1745), Scheibe gave the following description of this musical genre, distinguishing between the a proper or genuine sonata and one auf Concertenart: This is Zohn's translation of the following passage from Scheibe's Critischer Musikus, (1740), a revised and expanded version of what he originally wrote in Der critische Musikus: \\"Ich will aber zuv√∂rderst von den dreystimmigen und vierstimmigen Sonaten reden, davon die ersten insgemein Trios, die letztern aber Quadros genennet werden, hernach aber auch die √ºbrigen etwas erl√§utern. Beyde Arten von Sonaten, von welchen ich zuerst reden will, werden eigentlich auf zweyerley Art eingerichtet, n√§mlich als eigentliche Sonaten, und dann auch auf Concertenart ... \\"Das eigentliche Wesen dieser St√ºcke aber ist √ºberhaupt dieses, da√ü in allen Stimmen, vornehmlich aber in den Oberstimmen ein ordentlicher Gesang, und eine fugenm√§√üige Ausarbeitung seyn mu√ü. Wenn sie nicht auf Concertenart eingerichtet werden: so darf man wenig kr√§uselnde und ver√§ndernde S√§tze anbringen, sondern es mu√ü durchaus eine b√ºndige, flie√üende und nat√ºrliche Melodie vorhanden seyn ... \\"Die Ordnung aber, die man in diesen Sonaten insgemein zu halten pfleget, ist fol- gende. Zuerst erscheint ein langsamer Satz, hierauf ein geschwinder oder lebhafter Satz; diesem folget ein langsamer, und zuletzt beschlie√üt ein geschwinder und munterer Satz. Wiewohl man kann dann und wann den ersten langsamen Satz weglassen, und so fort mit dem lebhaften Satze anfangen. Dieses letztere pflegt man insonderheit zu thun, wenn man die Sonaten auf Concertenart ausarbeitet ... \\"Der nunmehro folgende geschwinde oder lebhafte Satz wird insgemein auf Fugenart ausgearbeitet, wo er nicht selbst eine ordentliche Fuge ist ... Wenn das Trio concerten- m√§ssig seyn soll: so kann auch ein[e] Stimme st√§rker, als die andere, arbeiten, und also mancherley kr√§uselnde, laufende und ver√§ndernde S√§tze h√∂ren lassen. Die Unterstimme kann auch in diesem Falle nicht so b√ºndig, als in einer andern ordentlichen Sonate, gesetzet werden.\\" As comments, Scheibe regarded Bach's organ sonatas as his main contribution to the genre of Sonaten auf Concertenart. They conform to Scheibe's description in two ways: the role and style of the bass part; and the three-movement format. Firstly the limitations on pedalboard technique dictated that the bass line in the pedal had to be simpler than the two upper parts in the manuals. Even so, Scheibe's analysis only applies in its strict form to half the movements: the starting fast movements of all but the first sonata; the slow movements of all but the first and fourth sonatas; and the whole of the third sonata BWV 527. In all the other movements‚Äîin particular in the entire first sonata BWV 525 and in all the final fast movements‚Äîthe theme passes to the pedal, usually in simplified form stripped of ornaments; thus even in these movements the bass line is less elaborate than the upper parts. Secondly the limitation to three movements, omitting a first slow movement, was perhaps a conscious decision of Bach.Bach departs from the strict three movement structure only in the brief slow introduction in the first movement of BWV 526, originally the sinfonia in BWV 76. In the earlier collection of sonatas for violin and obbligato harpsichord (BWV 1014‚Äì1019), mostly composed in four movements, the opening slow movements have long cantilena melodies for the solo violin. This style of writing would not have translated well to the organ: indeed Bach reserved such lines for the elaborate cantus firmus parts in his ornamental chorale preludes. In the sonatas for violin and harpsichord, Bach does not adhere to strict trio sonata form in the slow movements, where the upper part in the obbligato harpsichord part can be divided into two voices; and where the violin can fill out the harmonies with double stopping. In the organ sonatas the harmonies are provided by the pedal and the two manual parts, which play single melodic lines throughout.See: Musical structure :To play an ogg file of a movement, please click on the link. :To play an MP3 recording by James Kibbie performing on a selection of German baroque organs, please click on the external audio link.To make an external audio link open in a new tab or window, please set reading preferences in . = Sonata No. 1 in E major, BWV 525 = Movements * [Allegro] E major ‚Ä¢ play MP3 * Adagio C minor ‚Ä¢ play MP3 * Allegro E major ‚Ä¢ play MP3 = Sonata No. 2 in C minor, BWV 526 = Movements * Vivace C minor ‚Ä¢ play MP3 * Largo E major ‚Ä¢ play MP3 * Allegro C minor ‚Ä¢ play MP3 = Sonata No. 3 in D minor, BWV 527 = Movements * Andante D minor ‚Ä¢ play MP3 * Adagio e dolce F major ‚Ä¢ play MP3 * Vivace D minor ‚Ä¢ play MP3 = Sonata No. 4 in E minor, BWV 528 = Movements * Adagio ‚Äì Vivace E minor ‚Ä¢ play MP3 * Andante B minor ‚Ä¢ play MP3 * Un poco Allegro E minor ‚Ä¢ play MP3 = Sonata No. 5 in C major, BWV 529 = Movements * Allegro ' C major' ‚Ä¢ play MP3 800px This brightly scored and skillfully composed movement has a da capo A‚ÄìB‚ÄìA form. In structure and texture it resembles a trio sonata in the galant style for two flutes and continuo. The range of the keyboard parts, however, is beyond that of such instruments; and the succinct and idiomatic keyboard writing with intricate development sections are typical of the organ sonatas. The A section is 50 bars long. After the 54 bar development section B, it is reprised in its entirety. The opening two bars of the A section comprise a solo semiquaver flourish in one of the manuals followed by a tutti response in quavers. It recurs throughout the movement, marking the beginning of new episodes. In the first sixteen bar segment it alternates with semiquaver scale passages played imitatively between the two manuals. That material is then repeated in the dominant key with the upper parts exchanged. There is a short \\"development\\" episode of 14 bars where for 7 bars the material of the opening segment is permuted between the parts‚Äîat one stage over a long pedal point‚Äîand then repeated with the manual parts inverted. A brief 5 bar coda reprising the imitative semiquaver scales leads into section B. In conformity with the whole movement, the main development section B has a symmetrical da capo a‚Äìb‚Äìa structure, made up of 21 bars, 12 bars and 21 bars. A fugue subject in semiquavers is introduced at the beginning of section B: although similar in shape to the flourish opening of the main theme, it involves scale figures in contrast to arpeggios. The fugue subject is freely developed in exchanges between the upper parts before fragments of the main theme of increasing length begin to be heard, starting with the opening flourish. In the central b episode, two 4 bar reprises of the main theme encase 4 bars where elements of both themes are heard simultaneously, alternating between the manuals. There are significant modulations in section B particularly in the interjections of the main theme: the first section a is in the key of C major; section b is in C major with interjections in F major and A minor; and then an inversion of the material of section a returns in A minor with interjections of the main theme in G major, F major, D minor and C major, in anticipation of the reprise of section A. Throughout the movement the pedal part plays the role of a continuo, in a particularly simple form in section B. In the A sections the pedal part includes a walking bass in quavers as well as pedal points; many of the pedal motifs are derived from figures in the keyboard parts. * Largo ' A minor ‚Ä¢ play MP3 600px Manuscript copies, made by Vogler, Walther and Kellner, show that this movement was often performed as an intermediate movement between the Prelude and Fugue in C major for organ, BWV 545. It is thought to have been originally composed in Weimar and reworked for the collection of organ sonatas. notes that this movement‚Äîlike many other instrumental slow movements by Bach such as the sinfonia from the Weimar cantata Ich hatte viel Bek√ºmmernis, BWV 21‚Äîshows the influence of the so-called \\"Corelli style,\\" an Italian sonata style refined and perfected by Arcangelo Corelli. The style is exemplified in the \\"embellished\\" slow movements of Corelli's violin sonatas Op. 5, in which the range of musical motifs is widely varied, both through rhythm and \\"diastema\\" [the intervals between consecutive notes in the melody]. As explains, this style is distinguished by its lyricism: Corelli elevated the sonata da chiesa to a new level of eloquence \\"with a lyricism found only before in vocal music\\"; the style was \\"smoother and clearer\\" than that of earlier composers, \\"giving a feeling of spaciousness and breadth that happily reinforced the greater length\\". gives a broad musical description of the Largo as a movement with two voices in dialogue over a continuo bass combining aspects of three different musical forms: fugue, ritornello and da capo aria. Together these create a mood or affekt tinged with melancholy. In the opening bars the first fugal subject and counter-subject are heard in the manuals over the continuo bass. The elegiac passage with the lyrical subject and counter- subject in counterpoint is heard several times, scarcely altered, during the movement. It is instantly recognizable each time it returns and plays the role of a ritornello. The second subject starts at bar 13 and illustrates the other groups of musical figures that Bach employs in the movement. 600px The detailed structure of the movement is as follows: *A, bars 1‚Äì12. Fugal 3-bar subject in A minor in the upper manual with a continuo accompaniment in crotchets and quavers in the pedal. A bar before the entry of the subject in the lower manual a fourth below, the chromatic counter-subject starts in the upper manual. In the last 5 bars 8‚Äì12 there is counterpoint between the keyboards derived from figures in the chromatic counter-subject, partly in sequence and partly in imitative responses. *B, bars 13‚Äì20. Section with second subject in C major. In the first bar there are sequences of demisemiquavers in the upper part and semiquavers in the lower part, inverted and exchanged between the parts in the next bar. After a two bar interlude with contrary motion between the parts and further demisemiquaver figures, the imitative phrases in the episode from section A are heard again, before a reprise in reverse order of the two opening bars of demisemiquaver/semiquaver figures. *A, bars 21‚Äì32. Return of the first fugal subject in C major in the first eight bars, swapped between the manual parts, with the lower manual falling silent in the eighth bar; chromaticism is not used during the counterpoint. This is followed by a reprise of bars 15‚Äì18 with the upper voices swapped. *B, bars 33‚Äì40. Second subject (bars 13‚Äì14) slightly altered in dominant key of D minor; then reprises of bars 9‚Äì12 in D minor followed by a reprise of bars 15‚Äì16 modulating back to the home key of A minor. *A, bars 41‚Äì54. Repeat of opening section A, but now with the accompanying counter- subject in the lower manual from the start. Coda in the last two bars with a cadence in the phrygian mode. The da capo aspects of the movement are manifested in the first and last sections in A minor, which frame the middle section, comprising bars 13‚Äì40, that starts with new musical material in the relative major key of C major. In the movement the seven bar fugal melody segment (bars 1‚Äì7, 21‚Äì27, 41‚Äì47) that forms the ritornello is never divided up, in contrast to the intervening bars which are developed from demisemiquaver figures spun out into long phrases which are freely permuted. The long demisemiquaver phrases are themselves developed from distinct \\"motif- cells\\" of four demisemiquavers‚Äîthese can be seen in the last quaver of bar 4, the first quaver of bar 13 and the last quaver of bar 16. None of these occur in the ritornello segment and are examples of what Walther termed \\"varied figures\\" in his 1708 theoretical treatise Praecepta der musicalischen Composition. (Examples of freely developed material occur already in bar 8 (and later in bar 48), which serves as a linking passage: the diminished fifths there are similar to those Bach used later in the opening Fantasia of the third keyboard partita in A minor, BWV 827.) Thus the lyrical thematic material of the ritornello melody is kept distinct from that of the freely developed demisemiquaver episodes it frames. In this way Bach pushed his system of \\"composing through motifs\\" even further than he did in the chorale preludes of the Orgelb√ºchlein.See:  Allegro ' C major' ‚Ä¢ play MP3 800px Corelli's Op.5, first published in Rome in 1700 and later in Amsterdam in 1710 with agr√©ments or \\"embellishments\\" Autograph manuscript of fugue in A flat major, BWV 886, from Book II of the Well-Tempered Clavier The fugal last movement of BWV 529‚Äîin contrast to the more forward-looking first movement‚Äîfollows established patterns.

Sackmann and discuss their influence on Bach. and that of the later four-part fugue in A flat major in Book II of the Well-Tempered Clavier. In BWV 529 the pedal also participates as a third voice in the fugue: the quaver chief motif of the first fugue subject (the first six notes) fits well with the pedal; and later on in the second subject the semiquavers in the manuals are also taken up in the pedal part. 600px discusses the \\"ingenious\\" structure of the movement which he describes as \\"bright, extrovert, tuneful, restless, intricate\\": there is \\"inventive\\" semiquaver passagework in the manuals matched by \\"instructive\\" or challenging footwork in the pedal. The structure can be seen on two levels. On the one hand there is the broad binary structure of a dance-form: the first part comprising bars 1‚Äì73 with the first and second subject followed by a short coda in the dominant key of G major; then the second part, bars 73‚Äì163, in which the reprise of the first subject has the form of a development section, followed by the second subject and the coda in the tonic key of C major.See: On the other hand, there is a more detailed division into sections: :*A, first subject, bars 1‚Äì29. The fugal subject is heard in the manuals followed by a semiquaver countersubject; the pedal plays a continuo role with its own fragmented motifs. An episode begins at bar 13 with semiquaver passagework alternating between the manuals over a walking bass. At bar 21 the counterpoint in the upper voices continues over three statements (bars 21, 23 and 25) of the chief motif of the fugue subject before the concluding cadence. :*B, second subject, bars 29‚Äì59. The second subject is heard in the tonic key in the upper keyboard, answered by the lower keyboard and then the pedal an octave lower. At bar 39, it is heard in the lower manual in A minor, answered in the upper manual with the lower manual in parallel thirds. The first subject is then heard again with its countersubject in A minor, starting in the lower manual. At bar 51 section B concludes with an eight-bar coda similar to the close of section A: the upper voices alternate in playing the semiquaver chief motif of the second subject over four statements of the chief motif of the first subject in the pedal. :*A, coda, bars 59‚Äì73. In the dominant key of G major, there is a stretto version of the first subject leading to a reprise of the episode starting at bar 13. :*A, first subject, bars 73‚Äì119. An extended and complex development section, which modulates through various minor keys and is divided into four parts; it is described in detail below. :*B, second subject, bars 119‚Äì149. As in the first section B but now with the upper parts interchanged and in the subdominant key of F major. :*A, coda, bars 149‚Äì163. As in the first coda, but again with the upper parts switched and an adjustment for the closing cadence. The development section (bars 73‚Äì119) is formed of four parts. In the first tersely scored part, bars 73‚Äì89, the first subject is heard modulating through different minor keys with an almost constant stream of semiquavers running through the three parts. 800px Although the chief motif in the fugue subject is unaltered, the semiquaver counter-subject is freely modified. The fugue subject is heard first in the upper keyboard, then in the lower keyboard, and finally in the pedal in bar 79. Without a break in bar 81 the pedal repeats the chief motif off the beat, followed by entries in the upper manual and then lower manual. The latter is accompanied by an angular version of the semiquaver counter-subject in the pedal which leads on to a further statement of the head motif. In bars 89‚Äì97 the first fugue subject and modified counter- subject are heard in the two upper voices in the key of D minor.

A copy made by Kittel of part of the autograph manuscript survives; and Johann Ludwig Krebs and Johann Gottfried Walther made copies of individual movements that might predate the manuscript. In 1764 handwritten copies of three movements of the sonatas were also available from the Leipzig publisher Bernhard Christoph Breitkopf, who also produced librettos of Bach's cantatas during his lifetime. Title page of edition of Hans Georg N√§geli, published in Zurich around 1815 Later in the eighteenth century publishers could supply hand copies of the entire collection: in 1799 the Viennese publisher Johann Traeg advertised the collection on their lists. After Bach's death the organ sonatas entered the standard repertoire of German organists, although more as a benchmark for the mastery of technique than for public performance. The organ sonatas were also disseminated amongst musical amateurs in more accessible arrangements as chamber works or Hausmusik for private performance in the home: an arrangement for two harpsichords, with each player taking an upper part and the bass line, was probably first copied by Wilhelm Friedemann Bach or Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach and might have originated from domestic music-making in the Bach household. See:  The first printed score for organ only appeared in the early nineteenth century and was also derived from the autograph manuscript. It was published around 1815 in Zurich by the Swiss musicologist Hans Georg N√§geli. The son of a musically inclined Protestant pastor in Wetzikon, N√§geli showed precocious musical skills. In 1790 he moved to Zurich where he took lessons with the Swiss pianist Johann David Br√ºnings, who introduced him to the music of Bach. A year later he set up a music shop and in 1794 a publishing house. Corresponding with Breitkopf and the widow of C.P.E. Bach, he was able to acquire Bach manuscripts, including that of the Mass in B minor, which he eventually published. His Bach publications started with the Well Tempered Clavier in 1801 and the Art of the Fugue in 1802. His interests later turned to pedagogy and singing: in Zurich he set up an institute similar to the Sing-Akademie zu Berlin of Carl Friedrich Christian Fasch.See:  Princess Anna Amalie There are also later copies of the autograph manuscript in Vienna, made by Johann Christian Oley in the 1760s, and in Berlin, in the library of Princess Anna Amalia,the former Amalienbibliothek, now incorporated in the Berlin State Library; not to be confused with the Duchess Anna Amalia Library which contained an exceptional number of Bach manuscripts. Bach's former pupil Johann Kirnberger was music teacher to Anna Amalia: like her flute-playing brother Frederick the Great, who employed Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach as court harpsichordist, she was a keen amateur musician, composing and playing the organ. Portrait of Sara Levy by Anton Graff, 1786 The royal court was not the only place in Berlin where Bach was performed. The family of Daniel Itzig, banker to Frederick the Great and his father, also provided a cultural milieu for musical connoisseurs: four of his daughters, Sara, Zippora, Fanny and Bella (maternal grandmother of Felix Mendelssohn), were all keyboard players. Sara was the most gifted harpsichordist, of professional standard. When Wilhelm Friedemann Bach moved to Berlin from Dresden, she took lessons from him and provided him with some financial support in his old age. After her marriage to the banker Samuel Salomon Levy in 1784, she ran a weekly musical salon in their residence on the Museuminsel: the concert room housed both a harpsichord and a fortepiano and was large enough to accommodate a chamber orchestra. With the help of Wilhelm Friedemann and Carl Philipp Emanuel, Sara also built up a significant library of hand copies of Bach manuscripts. Her collection included Bach's organ sonatas, which eventually were passed on to her grandnephew Felix Mendelssohn; there was also a copy of the two harpsichord arrangement of the organ sonatas in the Itzig household, belonging to Sara's sister Fanny. Sara Levy also commissioned works, including C.P. Bach's final composition, the Double concerto for harpsichord and fortepiano (1788). Her salon attracted the Berlin intelligentsia, including Alexander von Humboldt, Wilhelm von Humboldt, Friedrich Schleiermacher and Johann Gottlieb Fichte. Sara herself performed in public, including performances at the Sing-Akademie zu Berlin, from its foundation by Carl Friedrich Christian Fasch in 1791 until her retirement in 1810. Fasch's successor as director of the Sing-Akademie was Carl Friedrich Zelter, another devotee of Bach who later became Mendelssohn's teacher and mentor. Zelter ensured that Bach's organ works featured in the institution's Ripienschule instrumental concerts: both BWV 525 and BWV 526 were included in the concert programme. The collections of Bachiana of Sara Levy and C.P.E. Bach became part of the Sing-Akademie's library, now held in the Berlin State Library.See:  Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, unfinished portrait by Joseph Lange, 1782 Gottfried van Swieten The fair copy made by Wilhelm Friedemann Bach and Anna Magdalena Bach was probably disseminated through Bach's biographer Johann Nikolaus Forkel and the Austrian Ambassador to Berlin, Baron Gottfried van Swieten. van Swieten, an avid collector of music, knew Kirnberger and Princess Anna Amalia from Berlin and had brought back to Vienna several hand copies of Bach manuscripts of keyboard and organ works, including a transcription of the organ sonatas for two keyboards: van Swieten's large collection of musical manuscripts is now preserved in the Imperial Library, which he directed from 1777 onwards. In late eighteenth century Vienna renewed interest amongst the musical intelligentsia in the \\"old music\\" of Bach had given rise to weekly meetings of a musical salon run by van Swieten; in 1782 the young Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart became an active participant.As described in , Mozart and van Swieten's paths had previously intersected in 1768 in Vienna at a private rehearsal of the ill-fated La Finta semplice, Mozart's first attempts at opera buffo. In both Berlin and Vienna it had become fashionable to play Bach in arrangements more suited for domestic performance. Mozart himself made string quartet arrangements of some of the fugues in the Well Tempered Clavier; and three of the movements in the string trios for violin, viola and cello, K. 404a, are transcriptions of movements from the organ sonatas (BWV 527/ii, BWV 526/ii and BWV 526/iii). Fanny von Arnstein, lithograph by Louis Pereira, 1819 Page from Primo part with end of BWV 526/ii and start of BWV 526/iii in arrangement for two harpsichords from collection of Fanny von Arnstein, ONB, Vienna The string trios K. 404a have not been included in the Neue Mozart Ausgabe of 2010. Their previous inclusion in the catalogue of Mozart's works, following the assessments of the musicologists Wilhelm Rust in the nineteenth century and Alfred Einstein in the twentieth century, was challenged in the 1960s due to problems in authenticating the authorship of the newly composed slow movements preceding the fugal movements. In addition it was assumed that the sources for the organ sonatas used in the transcriptions were those brought back to Vienna by Baron van Swieten. has suggested that Mozart's special circumstances in Vienna in 1782 point with high probability to a quite different version of events, which makes Mozart's authorship of K. 404a far more likely.See: Mozart's contacts with the Bach circle date back to the concert tour with his sister and father when they stayed in London from April 1764 until July 1765. The eight year old Mozart played before George III. In his second recital he was requested to perform compositions by Bach's son Johann Christian Bach‚Äîthe \\"London Bach\\"‚Äîwho befriended the family during their visit. In 1781 in Vienna he came into contact with the Itzig family. Sara's older sister Fanny had moved to Vienna in 1776 following her marriage to the Viennese banker Adam Nathan Arnstein. She attended the musical salons of Baron van Swieten and brought with her from Berlin her extensive personal collection of Bach family manuscripts. These included the arrangement of the organ sonatas for two harpsichords; and the Itzig family collection of manuscripts in Berlin frequently had volumes containing fugues from the Well Tempered Clavier fugues bound with fugues by Bach's two eldest sons. In August 1781 Mozart took up lodgings with his fortepiano in \\"a very prettily furnished room\\" (ein recht h√ºpsches eingerichtetes zimmer) in the servants' quarters on the third floor of the Arnstein family mansion \\"auf dem Graben\\". He remained there for eleven months: his letter to his father of 10 April concerning van Zwieten's Sunday salons dates from that period. Wolff considers it likely that Mozart's involvement in van Zwieten's salon came about through Fanny van Arnstein; and that, while lodging with her, Mozart would have had access to her library and in particular the Bach manuscripts on which K. 404a is based. =England= Title page of BWV 525 in the 1809 edition of Charles Frederick Horn and Samuel Wesley, Arranged for piano duet (three hands) and available as six separate works, this was the first time all six sonatas had been published.

He is known best under his stage name KM-MARKIT. In 1998, he was initially part of the Urbarian Gym (URBARIAN GYM / UBG), a Japanese hip-hop group, which also featured popular Japanese rapper Zeebra beginning in 1997. He would go on to sign with the Pony Canyon label in 2004, releasing his first album, Vivid, in April the following year. He would release one more album under the Pony Canyon label before splitting off to do his own projects. UBG would later disband in 2010. After UBG's disbandment, in 2010, he co-founded the Raider Music Record and helped create the underground hip-hop group THE RAIDERS, becoming the executive producer. The group would release one album, The Raiders, along with several singles. -MARKIT would also collaborate with other artists, though they were under different labels. Biography Daisuke \\"KM- MARKIT\\" Kawai was born in Tokyo, Japan on December 16, 1976. In 1998, he joined the Urbarian Gym, a hip-hop group who was created by Japanese rapper ZEEBRA in 1997. Daisuke would break away from the group to begin his solo projects under the Pony Canyon label in 2005, with his debut album Vivid (stylized as VIVID). The album would feature Koda Kumi, who was one of Japan's more popular artist at the time (alongside Namie Amuro and Ayumi Hamasaki). This was despite Kumi being under the Avex sub-label Rhythm Zone at the time. He would release his second studio album, Mark Out (stylized as MARK OUT), a year later on May 12, 2006. Unlike Vivid, Mark Out would chart at No. 97 on the Oricon charts. It remained on the charts for two weeks. The album featured famed singer-songwriter Miliyah Kato. Urbarian Gym would disband thirteen years after their debut on March 24, 2010. In 2010, after UBG's disbandment, KM-MARKIT co-founded the label RAIDERMUZIK RECORDS, and would join the underground hip-hop group The Raiders, coming on as the executive producer. Other members included MINESIN, D-ON, HAR-CO, 8, HI-D, YUKALI, MICHO, KOHH, TY-KOH, TAKESHI & SATOSHI and Mr. LOW-D. Their first single, Oh Baby (stylized as OH BABY), would feature KM-MARKIT, YUKALI and 8. They would release their first album, The Raiders, the following year. The Raiders would go on to release a few singles following their debut album: Get It On (stylized as GET IT ON), B.M.N. (Big Monster Nuts) and Shut a Fu%k Up!!!. KM-MARKIT would release a few solo works post The Raiders album under the RAIDERMUZIK RECORDS label. These included Next Episode featuring NaNa in 2010, and Magnetic featuring miray in late 2014. Outside of The Raiders, KM-MARKIT would work behind-the-scenes with various artists as a lyricist and composer. He wrote the lyrics for the Japanese translations of the songs \\"Blood Sweat & Tears\\", \\"DNA\\", \\"Not Today\\" and \\"MIC Drop\\" from the 2018 BTS album Face Yourself, along with writing the lyrics to the albums' original songs \\"Go Go\\" and \\"Crystal Snow\\". He also worked with Japanese hip-hop group Lead for the songs \\"Shampoo Bubble\\" (2017), of which he wrote the rap portion of the song, and \\"Drop in the box\\" (2019), in which both he and RYUJA composed the instrumental. Uncharted singles =Magnetic (along with miray)= Magnetic (stylized as MAGNETIC) is the third solo single by rapper KM-MARKIT. It featured R&B;/dancehall/reggae artist miray. miray had previously worked with KM-MARKIT on her self-titled album, miray, in mid-2010. The single failed to chart on Oricon and Recochoku. Information Magnetic is the third solo single by KM-MARKIT and features reggae artist miray. The single was digitally released on November 19, 2014. The song was released on iTunes Japan as a digital single. miray was initially under the Avex sub-label Rhythm Zone. On August 4, 2010 (four years prior to the single), she and had featured KM-MARKIT on her album miray in the song \\"Box Seat\\" (stylized as BOX SEAT). However, upon the release of Magnetic, she was no longer under the Rhythm Zone sub-label and chose to focus on independent work. This independent work led her to the indie record label Raider Music Record, which was co-founded by KM-MARKIT himself. Despite being a single, \\"Magnetic\\" did not receive a music video and was released solely as audio, not unlike his prior singles, Give a Little... and Next Episode feat. NaNa. The song was classified as electronica/rap due to the synthesizer used predominately throughout the song.

They were based in Leamington Spa, and one of their major customers was Midland Counties Dairies, to whom they supplied just the chassis, with bodywork being built by the customer. At least two of their vehicles survive in museums. History Midland Electric Vehicles was established in 1935 and was based in Leamington Spa, Warwickshire. They supplied chassis to both the Birmingham and Wolverhampton divisions of the Midland Counties Dairy in 1936, and the first production vehicle probably went to the Wolverhampton division, whose ride-on fleet of milk floats consisted almost entirely of Midland vehicles, apart from some bought elsewhere during the war years and some pedestrian controlled vehicles. The chassis were supplied with a dashboard and glass for the windscreen, but the bodywork was built by the Wolverhampton bodyshop at Midland Counties Dairy, and their basic design remained unchanged until the demise of Midland Electric. The first design was a 10‚Äì15 cwt chassis, which was launched to the wider world in January 1937. It was designed by J Parker Garner, who at the time was a well-known designer, having been involved in the manufacturing of vehicles for a number of years. Its chassis was made from channel section steel, with cross bracing and a dropped section at the front, in order to give a low floor height for the cab. The doorways were behind the front wheels, and were not fitted with doors, although doors were available as an option. The height from the roadway to the cab floor was just , and such a low height was desirable because of the number of times a driver would have to enter and leave the cab while delivering bread or milk. The batteries were mounted in trays on either side of the vehicle, which could be slid out on rollers for maintenance, or to exchange the battery if it was required to do more than one round in a day. The batteries fed a 60-volt motor, and a series- parallel controller gave three forward and reverse speeds. Transmission was by a Layrub propeller shaft to an overhead worm driven rear axle. The bodywork was designed so that any panel could be easily removed and replaced if it became damaged. In early 1938, Midland added a model B20 to their range, which was designed for a 20 cwt payload. Apart from the payload, the rest of the design was very similar to the earlier model. Batteries were available from Britannia, D P Kathanode, Exide-Ironclad, or Tudor, and Midland offered a Westinghouse metal-rectifier charger with their vehicles. The B20 was showcased at the British Industries Fair, held at Castle Bromwich in February. The vehicle on display consisted of a chassis and a van body which had been cut in half, so that visitors to the show could see both the look of the vehicle and the construction of the chassis. Sales of their vehicles were handled by a network of distributors, and three new ones were announced in 1940, at Portsmouth, Guildford and Darlington. Potential customers could view a demonstrator vehicle at each location. As a result of the particular conditions imposed by the Second World War, Mr J Parker Garner, the managing director of Midland Electric, said that there was an increasing demand for larger battery electric vehicles, and to meet this need, they designed a multi-purpose tractor unit. This could pull a trailer loaded with 4 to 4.5 tons, or could carry 35 cwt on the rear platform of the tractor. Commercial Motor examined the use of one such vehicle which had been supplied to the Gloucester Aircraft Co Ltd, where it was used for towing aircraft, and for the transport of aero engines and castings around the factory. The vehicle could be used in areas of the factory where the fire risk from a petrol engine was too great, and it had been adapted so that its batteries could be used for starting aero engines. The reviewed vehicle had a 36-cell battery, rated at 240 Amp-hours, and this gave a range of . The driver had a mechanically operated foot pedal and series/parallel battery switch, providing 10 stages of speed control. This arrangement gave a normal running speed of in series mode and half that in parallel mode. By 1943, Midland Electric were producing five models, which could be fitted with various types of bodywork, including a flat-bed truck for coal deliveries. The B12 catered for a payload of 10‚Äì12 cwt, the BA12 for 12‚Äì15 cwt, the B20 for 18‚Äì22 cwt, the B25 for 25‚Äì28 cwt, with the largest model, the B30, suitable for 30‚Äì35 cwt. The controller was operated by a foot pedal, and transition between stages was regulated by an air delay mechanism. Maintenance of the motor was made easier by mounting it so that the commutator protruded into the driver's cab. The foot brake acted on all four wheels, while a separate hand brake only acted on the rear wheels. Midland showcased a van with open sides and roll-up canvas screens to the Soft Drinks Industry Protection Association in 1946. Besides dairy work, Midland vehicles were put to other tasks. In 1948, the Premier Ignition Company, based in Levenshulme, Manchester, claimed to be the first company to use battery electric road vehicles as hire cars. Acting as a distributor for Midland, they had previously sold a number of trucks to Lancashire Associated Collieries Ltd, for retail deliveries of coal. Subsequently, they had bought back two of the vehicles, had stripped them down and rebuilt them with 8-seater rear entrance shooting brake bodywork. They were then used to take teams or supporters to various sporting events, such as football, golf and snooker. With a range of about , the first vehicle to be converted was a 20 cwt model, while the second was a larger B25 25 cwt model, which had been fitted with a radio for the entertainment of the passengers. Midland produced a new 10-cwt lightweight design in 1949, which features an all-welded chassis with an integral body frame. The 10-cwt model was called the Midland Vandot when it was showcased at an exhibition in 1953, organised by the Electric Vehicle Association and the South Eastern Electricity Board. The last Midland Electric prior to the closure of the works in 1958 was bought by the Wolverhampton division of Midland Counties Dairy. They also bought the remaining chassis and spare parts that remained in the factory on closure, and later built two further vehicles using these parts, which carried the chassis numbers MCD 1 and 2. In 1962, Midland Counties Dairy was taken over by Unigate, and four of the B25 models were subsequently rebodied with a slightly modified Morrison- Electricar body, as used by the Birmingham division of Midland Counties Dairy. Both of the vehicles produced from spare parts were also fitted with Morrison- Electricar bodywork. Preservation At least two Midland Electric vehicle have been preserved, and are owned by The Transport Museum, Wythall. The first is a model TWB tower wagon, registration number HXB 658, built in 1944 and operated by the Metropolitan Borough of Fulham in London. The second is a B30 30 cwt model, dating from 1956, registration number SJW 599, which was used for retail milk delivery by Midland Counties Dairy.

Similar in appearance to other Trochosa species, the female T. terricola has a reddish abdomen while the male has darkened front legs. The two short lines which are visible on carapace are a diagnostic feature of Trochosa wolf spiders. The light cardiac mark separates it from Trochosa ruricola which has a dark cardiac mark. Habitat T. terricola is found in woodland, grassland, heathland and industrial sites and is often encountered under stones and logs, but overall it shows a preference for drier, heath-like conditions, although has been found in pitfall traps in areas of bog and marsh. Unlike the related T. ruricola it can be common in upland areas.

It derives its hedging construction from characteristics of Pascal's Triangle.http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.196.2766&rep;=rep1&type;=pdf  Definition  The term also has an alternative meaning within the context of inter-commodity spreads whereby it refers to either an inter-commodity spread within one month offset by the same inter-commodity spread but in another month (or alternatively a calendar spread for each respective instrument). Often presumed not to move much (as in theory they are practically non directional) they typically, but not always, trade in a range.  Examples  = As a Double Butterfly = Given two butterfly spreads with common overlapping wings: : The difference between the two results in a \\"double butterfly\\": : A box/double butterfly can also be constructed using a mixture of calendar spreads to achieve the same result: : = As an inter- commodity box spread = Given two related instruments that trade as inter- commodity based instruments: : The resulting position is roughly equivalent to two calendar spreads utilizing the same months: : As another example, \\"buying the Cal 13-12, SP-NP box spread\\", would be buying power at CAISO hub SP versus selling power at CAISO hub NP for 2013, while also doing the opposite (so, selling at SP and buying at NP) for 2012. (In some markets, a leg that is purchased is mentioned before a leg that is sold and commonly the more expensive leg is also mentioned first (to avoid using a negative spread price). Therefore, the way that the CAISO box spread is referred to suggests that SP is trading over NP, and SP-minus-NP is wider in 2013 than in 2012). Another pair of contracts that commonly trade box spreads are WTI and Brent crude oil, either in the form of intra-commodity calendar spreads for WTI and Brent using the same calendar expirations for each or different expiration WTI/Brent inter-commodity spreads. One motivation for trading a box would be to roll an existing two-leg spread position to another (typically later) time period. E.g., to roll one's existing 2012 SP-NP spread position out to 2013 (i.e., close 2012 and replace with 2013), or to trade the box spread itself by taking a view that there will be a widening or narrowing of the spread within the box itself.

During this period Boissiere witnessed the opening of the first Ileana Sonnabend gallery in Paris, where American Pop art artists such as Andy Warhol and Roy Lichtenstein were introduced in Europe for the first time.  1970s - Young Americans and Frank Gehry  After being a partner in Atelier A, a short lived venture where artists like Arman and Robert Malaval designed objects and artefacts, Boissiere was cooped in a small institution under the French ministry of industry to take part in a program promoting French design. He did attend and reported about international design congresses in Moscow, Kyoto, Vancouver, Aspen and Berlin. Soon he was appointed an editor of Architecture Int√©rieure Cree Magazine, where he introduced the young lionsOlivier Boissiere, Stanley Tigerman: une bilbioth√®que pour handicap√©s, Chicago, Architecture int√©rieure cr√©√©, May‚ÄìJune 1979,171, page 108‚Äì112 challenging the International style who were at that time Archigram, Cedric Price, Renzo Piano, Norman Foster, the Radical architecture in Italy, the American ‚ÄúPost-moderns‚Äù after the provoking Learning from Las Vegas, the architectural theories of Aldo Rossi, Lucien Kroll, the works of Gordon Matta Clark.

Back in Europe he was fortunate to attend the first great exhibitions by curator Harald Szeemann, the Bachelors Machines at UCAD in Paris and dokumenta V in Kassel with works by Beuys, Kienholz and Bruce Nauman.  1980s - travelling with art and architecture, Lewis Baltz  Spanning his life between Paris, Milan and Los Angeles, Olivier Boissiere became a regular culture and architecture writer for Domus, L'Architecture d'Aujourd'hui, Le Monde and some Cond√© Nast magazines such as Vogue, where he collaborated with photographer Donatella Brun. His journalistic travels ranged from accompanying Frank Gehry to the reception of his Gerit Rietweld Award in Utrecht through meeting Luis Barrag√°n in Mexico,[Olivier Boissiere, Habitation de M. Francisco Gilardi, Mexico; architect: Luis Barrag√°n, L'architecture d'aujourd'hui, April 1980,208] from paying visits to the buildings of Ralph Erskine in Stockholm to doing a series of interviews with Rem Koolhaas in the Netherlands and photographing the Norman Foster's HSBC Building just opened in Hong Kong. During this period he interviewed Claes Oldenburg and Coosje van Bruggen in New York after meeting them in Utrecht and visited the studio of Ed Ruscha in Los Angeles. His encounter with great artist and photographer Lewis Baltz was the beginning of a long friendship, marked by a common interest both in art history and The Great Game. Boissiere wrote texts for some of Baltz's projects, such as Fos Secteur 80 at Tate, La Ronde de Nuit, shown at Centre Georges Pompidou and later Piazza Arnolfo in Tuscany.Jeff Rian, Last Interview of Lewis Baltz, L‚ÄôOeil de la Photographie, 01 Jan 2015Lewis Baltz, Notebooks and ephemera 1987 - 2011, The Getty Research Institute, Special Collections His first meeting with Jean Nouvel had happened during this time.  1990s - working with Jean Nouvel, book publishing  The competition for the Kansai International Airport in Japan in the late 80's did mark the beginning of an ongoing episodic collaboration with Jean Nouvel, according to projects, competitions and circumstances.

It is very close to megestrol acetate (6-dehydro-6-methyl-17Œ±-acetoxyprogesterone) in structure, except that there is a hydroxyl group with an acetate ester attached at the C3 position instead of a ketone. A closely related medication is cymegesolate (also known as megestrol 3Œ≤-cypionate 17Œ±-acetate), which, in contrast, has not been marketed.

Because of her political beliefs and activities she spent six of the twelve Nazi years in jail. After the war she resumed her membership of the Hamburgische B√ºrgerschaft (Hamburg state legislature). There is a street named after Magda Langhans in Potsdam, but not in her own city, Hamburg. Life =Early years= Magda Kelm was born into a working-class family in Hamburg, the eldest of seven siblings, growing up initially in the city's Hammerbrook quarter and relocating later to Dulsberg on the north side of town. Her father worked as a coachman: her mother as a cleaner. When her father died of tuberculosis her mother remarried, this time to a port worker, but there is little available information on Magda's step father and younger siblings. =Politics= Early on she worked in domestic service, also employed as a kitchen assistant and in a wine shop. In 1920 she embarked on a traineeship with a printing business, and she was employed in the book printing sector as a type-setter till 1932. She joined a trades union when she was 18 and in 1927, when she was 24, at the prompting of a friend Magda Kelm joined the Communist Party. She quickly took on jobs within the party apparatus, and in 1931/32 attended the Communist Party Academy in Moscow, although the purpose and nature of her studies are no longer easy to determine. On her return to Hamburg she took a post in the party regional leadership team (Bezirksleitung) for Wasserkante, the region to the north of the Elbe estuary. It was here that she first met the painter-decorator Heinrich Langhans whom she would later marry. Between 1931 and 1933 she also sat as one of the 26 Communist members of the Hamburgische B√ºrgerschaft (Hamburg state legislature). Following local elections on 24 April 1932 the Nazi Party became the largest party in the B√ºrgerschaft, but they were able to take control of the assembly only in 1933, after entering into coalition with the German National Party (\\"Deutsche Staatspartei\\"/ DStP) and the National People's Party (\\"Deutschnationale Volkspartei\\" / DNVP). On a national level, in January 1933 the political backdrop was transformed when the Nazi Party took power and converted Germany into a one-party dictatorship. Political activity - except in support of the Nazi Party - became illegal. At the end of February 1933 the Reichstag fire was instantly blamed on the Communists, and in March 1933. By this time persecution and arrests of Communist parliamentarians had already started, and following reconfiguration, at the B√ºrgerschaft session of 8 March 1933 Communist members no longer took part. =Nazi years= More than fifty years later she disclosed that a couple of weeks before the party's exclusion from the Hamburg parliament Magda Kelms had collected from the city hall 2,000 Marks in attendance allowances for the Communist Party members, which would be used for the support of comrades continuing to work (now illegally) for the party. On 1 May 1933 a demonstration was organised locally, with red banners improvised from bedding hung from apartment windows, but the banners were hurriedly taken in when Nazi paramilitaries appeared on the scene. On 2 May 1933 the apartment she shared was \\"occupied\\" by fascists, but she was nevertheless able to continue with her party work till her arrest in May 1934. She took a leading role in underground distribution of the \\"Rote Fahne\\" newspaper and other Communist publications in the Hamburg region. Between 1933 and 1939 approximately 8,500 communists were arrested in the Hamburg area. They were charged, almost invariably, with \\"Conspiracy to Commit High Treason\\" (\\"Vorbereitung zum Hochverrat\\"). Magda Kelms was arrested in May 1934 and given a six-year prison sentence which she spent in the women's prison in L√ºbeck-Lauerhof. She was the first woman in Hamburg to be arrested and imprisoned by the Nazis on political grounds. Her partner, Heinrich Langhans, had also been arrested by the Gestapo, but by 1940 they had both been released, and in that year they married. The marriage, though childless, was close. Between 1941 and 1945 Magda Langhans worked in clerical and sales jobs. =British occupation zone= War ended in May 1945, and for Hamburg Nazi rule gave way to the British military occupation. Magda Langhans resumed her membership of the Communist Party, serving till 1949 as head of the Women's Secretariat for the Hamburg party's regional leadership (Berzirksleitung). The Hamburgische B√ºrgerschaft (Hamburg state legislature) was reinstated in February 1946, initially as a nominated body, and the British military administrators nominated Magda Langhans as a member of it. She was one of nine communists, along with members of other parties, mandated to draw up a new constitution for the city. Later, in October 1946 the nominated legislature was replaced by an elected one: the Communists won slightly more than 10% of the popular vote, which was less than half the proportion achieved back in the early 1930s, but they nevertheless, found themselves in Hamburg's first postwar governing coalition, headed up by the Social Democrat, Max Brauer. Between 1946 and 1953 Langhans sat as a member of the B√ºrgerschaft. There she became the first woman actually to become the vice-president of the assembly presidium. She saw her election as more than a personal achievement, being an important marker for women more generally. Within the Hamburg legislature Langhans campaigned strongly for women's rights and for retributive measures against perpetrators of state sponsored crimes during the Nazi years. A particular target was the historian Kurt Detlev M√∂ller, \\"outed\\" as a former Nazi party member and, she contended, \\"a great anti-Semite\\", who was attempting to reinvent himself as Director of the Hamburg City Archive. =German Federal Republic= In May 1949 three of the four occupation zones into which Germany had been divided at the end of the war were merged and relaunched as the German Federal Republic (West Germany). As part of the process the regional legislatures of the nine states comprising the new country were invited to endorse the Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany. All except one of the states provided unqualified backing (and conditional backing from the dissenting state, Bavaria, became implicitly unconditional through the actions of the other states). In Hamburg, however, Magda Langhans and the rest of the Communist group in the assembly voted against the basic law in order to avoid the risk of driving a greater wedge than already existed between West Germany and the fourth occupation zone, the Soviet occupation zone, which was itself reinvented later the same year as a separate Soviet sponsored German dictatorship, the German Democratic Republic (East Germany). In addition Langhans involved herself in the Women's International League for Peace and Freedom, serving as the first chair of the organisation's Hamburg branch committee. She was also regional chair for Hamburg of the Democratic Women's League of Germany. However, the East German authorities' savage suppression of the 1953 uprising let to an overall increase in east-west tensions during the 1950s and in 1957 the Democratic Women's League was banned in West Germany. By this time the league - even its West German branch set up only in 1950 - was seen as an agency of East Germany. Wider Cold War tensions were also on display in August 1956 when the Federal Constitutional Court, after deliberating for five years, reluctantly endorsed the right of the political establishment to ban the Communist Party in West Germany. Langhans continued to work for the party, now illegally, in Bremen and W√ºrttemberg. Following a slight easing of political tensions between the two Germanys, in 1968 the West German authorities grudgingly permitted the emergence of a new incarnation of the Communist Party, officially called the German Communist Party (\\"Deutsche Kommunistische Partei\\" / DKP). Magda Langhans was a founder member in Hamburg, becoming a member of the regional leadership team (Bezirksleitung). On 27 June 1978 Heinrich Langhans died, leaving Magda Lanhans a widow for her final years. She herself died in Hamburg on 17 January 1987.

Jean-Baptiste Le Roy (15 August 1720, Paris ‚Äì 20 January 1800, Paris) was an 18th-century French physicist and one of the major contributors to the Encyclop√©die by Diderot and d‚ÄôAlembert for technology. The son of 18th-century Parisian clockmaker and watchmaker Julien Le Roy, he had three brothers: Pierre (1717‚Äì1785), a brilliant clock-maker in his own right, Julien-David (1724‚Äì1803), a neo-classical architect and archaeologist, and Charles a physician and Encyclop√©diste. In the field of science, Jean-Baptiste Le Roy worked on a variety of topics; of particular importance were his research on electricity. Together with Patrick d'Arcy, he constructed in 1749 the first electrometer, a device for detection of electrical charges and voltages. He also experimented with lightning conductors and with the use of electricity in the treatment of diseases. As contributor to the Encyclop√©die, he wrote more than 130 articles under the author abbreviation \\"T\\", including those related to watchmaking, locksmith and mathematical instruments. From 1772 to 1777 Le Roy was deputy director and from 1773 to 1778, director of the Acad√©mie royale des sciences.

The pagoda was originally built during the Western Xia, but the current structure dates to the Qing dynasty. At in height it is the tallest pagoda in Ningxia. In contrast to the Haibao Pagoda in Yinchuan, which is known as the Northern Pagoda, Chengtian Temple Pagoda is also informally referred to as the Western Pagoda (). History The first pagoda was built during the infancy of Emperor Yizong of Western Xia (r. 1048‚Äì1068). The text of a commemorative stele marking its construction has been preserved, from which it is known that the Empress Dowager ordered the construction of a pagoda to protect the reign of her infant son, and as a reliquary for housing pieces of head bone of the Buddha.Commemorative stele at Chengtian Temple Pagoda, Yinchuan, dated August 1990. The construction of the pagoda was completed in 1050, on the 25th day of the 3rd month of 1st year of the Tianyou Chuisheng era. In 1055 a set of the Tripi·π≠aka given by Emperor Renzong of Song was deposited at the Chengtian Temple. By the beginning of the Ming dynasty the temple was in ruins, and only the pagoda remained standing. A poem entitled \\"Sound of a Bell at the Tall Pagoda\\" (Èï∑Â°îÈêòËÅ≤) by the early Ming poet Wang Xun ÁéãÈÅú describes the desolation of the temple: :È≥¥ÈêòÈï∑Â°îÂØ∫Ôºå‰∏çË¶ãÊòîÂπ¥ÂÉß„ÄÇ :ËÅ≤ÂØÇ‰∏âÂçÉÁïåÔºåÈü≥Èä∑ÂçÅ‰∫åÂ±§„ÄÇ :Âª¢Âü∫Â¶ªÂÜ¢Âú®ÔºåÈô≥Ë∑°ÁâßÂÖíÁôª„ÄÇ :ÊúâÂæÖËéäÂö¥Êó•ÔºåÁÑ°Â∏∏È©óÊô∫Ëàà„ÄÇ :The bell rings at the temple of the tall pagoda, but I do not see the monks of yore. :Sound is extinguished throughout the three thousand realms, noise vanishes up to the twelve levels [of heaven]. :The grave of someone's wife lies in the abandoned ruins, boys tending sheep clamber among the scattered remains. :Awaiting the day it will return to splendour, in this transient world a [Duan] Zhixing will appear. Duan Zhixing was a 12th-century king of the Dali Kingdom who was renowned for repairing Buddhist temples, and Wang Xun uses him to refer to his patron, Zhu Zhan Êú±Ê†¥ (1378‚Äì1438; Prince Jing of Qing, the 16th son of the Hongwu Emperor), who was subsequently responsible for renovating Chengtian Temple. The renovation of the temple was completed by Zhu Zhan's grandson, Zhu Suikan Êú±ÈÇÉÂùé, in 1469. On 3 January 1739, Yinchuan was hit by a large earthquake, and the pagoda was destroyed. In 1820 the present pagoda was built on the site of the original pagoda. Description The present pagoda is an eleven-storeyed, octagonal pagoda constructed of bricks, standing on a square platform across and high. The pagoda itself is approximately in height, and each side of the bottom storey is in width. The pagoda is hollow, with an entrance in the east wall, and wooden stairs lead up to the top storey, where there are windows facing in four directions. No depictions of the original Western Xia pagoda survive, but it is thought that the current pagoda copies the shape and style of the original Western Xia pagoda. A Ming dynasty source states the pagoda at that time had thirteen storeys, but that may be counting the roof and the finial. In 2006 the pagoda was listed as a Major Historical and Cultural Site Protected at the National Level.

Nossik was one of the former managers of Rambler and blogging service holding company SUP Media (participated in this capacity in the LiveJournal service acquisition), and was the founder of Pomogi.org charitable foundation. Since mid-October 2009, he was appointed Deputy General Director of United Media and, concurrently, the position of chief editor Bfm.ru. From 16 November 2011 to 29 November 2012, he was the media director of SUP Media, which owns the LiveJournal service. In mid-2014, he co-founded Fuzzy cheese, a market and public-opinion research company.  Biography  In 2011 Russian President Dmitry Medvedev met with representatives of the Russian internet community, including Anton Nossik. Born in the family of the writer Boris Nossik and philologist-polonist Victoria Mochalova, his father was elected as an honorary member of the Russian Academy of Arts in 2011. He had one sister, Sandra, who teaches sociolinguistics at the French University of Franche-Comt√©. The artist Ilya Kabakov was his stepfather. He graduated from medical school (Moscow State University of Medicine and Dentistry), but he was better known for his role in pioneering the beginning of Russian online news. Nossik moved to Israel in the early 90s and worked for some time at the Jerusalem Post, before returning to Russia in 1997. =Activism= Nossik was a member of the public council of the Russian Jewish Congress. He was also a co-chair of the first roundtable on the introduction of Creative Commons licenses in the Russian Federation in 2008. His photos are available under CC-BY-2.0 and CC-BY-3.0 licenses. In March 2013, Nossik took part in a series of pickets for the liberation of two members of Pussy Riot: Maria Alyokhina and Nadezhda Tolokonnikova. He was later involved in the Ukraine ‚Äî Russia: Dialogue conference, which took place in Kiev during 24‚Äì25 April 2014. Nosik was a strident critic of the Russian government‚Äôs moves to crack down on internet freedoms in recent years with harsh legislative regulation. Speaking to AFP in 2014, he warned that ‚ÄúRussia‚Äôs shift to the North Korean model of managing the internet will have far-reaching consequences for the country‚Äôs economy and public sentiment.‚Äù In 2014, Nossik posted an article in response to Vladimir Putin‚Äôs crackdown on internet freedom called ‚ÄúRussia‚Äôs First Blogger Reacts to Putin‚Äôs Internet Crackdown‚Äù: \\"In December 1999, three days before he became acting president of Russia, Vladimir Putin made a solemn pledge to honor and protect Internet freedom of speech and commerce, recognizing the importance of this new industry for Russia‚Äôs modernization and general development. As a result, the Internet developed into Russia's only competitive industry. When Putin had made his initial pledge not to interfere, he lived up to his promise for almost 13 years. Unfortunately, those 13 happy years are over now and we‚Äôre witnessing a fast and ruthless destruction of online freedom.\\" In the article, Nossik criticized Putin's flip-flopping stance and move to silence internet journalists. ‚ÄúThis Orwellian masterpiece of legislation was signed into law by Vladimir Putin on May 5, 2014, and it will be enforced from August 1, 2014. Will that be the last day of Russian Internet? Maybe. Unless a new law kills it even faster,‚Äù he wrote. =Russian criminal investigation= At the end of 2015, Nossik was under a criminal investigation under part 1 of article 282 the Russian Criminal Code (incitement of hatred or enmity) for a blog post about Syria. According to the prosecution, on 1 October 2015 Nossik published the post titled \\"Erase Syria from the face of the Earth\\", in which, according to a linguistic expertise solicited by the prosecution, \\"signs of inciting hatred against the Syrians, based on the national-territorial principle\\" were detected.–°–ö–† –∑–∞–≤–µ–ª —É–≥–æ–ª–æ–≤–Ω–æ–µ –¥–µ–ª–æ –Ω–∞ –±–ª–æ–≥–µ—Ä–∞ –ê–Ω—Ç–æ–Ω–∞ –ù–æ—Å–∏–∫–∞, –†–ë–ö, 16 February 2016. The post urged President Vladimir Putin to act as he perceived Syria as a military threat to Israel. Opposition figures in Russia pointed to the irony of Nossik being brought to trial as, at the time, Russia was being accused by the West of committing war crimes in Syria during their bombing raids against forces opposing President Bashar al-Assad. On 19 September 2016, the prosecution asked to sentence Nossik to two years imprisonment. On 3 October 2016, the Presnya court of Moscow convicted Nossik and sentenced him to a fine of 500 thousand rubles. On 15 December 2016, Moscow city court reduced the fine to 300 thousand rubles. In January 2017, an appeal to the conviction was accepted for hearing by the ECHR. =Death= Nossik died from a heart attack in the night of 9 July 2017 at the age of 51 in Pirogovo, Mytishchinsky District, Moscow Oblast, in the summer house of his friends. In the hours since his death, Russian bloggers, journalists, and media personalities have shared their memories of Nossik, whom they remember as a dogged worker who built the RuNet from the ground up, helping turn it into, in his own words, Russia's only territory of unlimited free speech. Pavel Durov, the founder of VKontakte and Telegram, wrote in a post on VKontakte on Sunday that Nossik had until his last days, stood in defense of the Internet and common sense in his precise and vivid posts on LiveJournal, where Nossik blogged. Galina Timchenko, the executive editor of the news website Meduza and a former colleague of Nossik's, wrote: For all of us at Meduza, Nossik was probably the single most important person on the Russian Internet; we consider him to be the founding father of Russian Internet journalism.

Formed in mid-2013, the group has been led by several members of the influential al-Jader family from the town of Jarabulus and the nearby town of Karkamƒ±≈ü in Turkey. History The al-Tawhid Brigade participated in the Battle of Aleppo in late 2012 which led to the capture of the Aleppo Infantry School and the field commander, Colonel Yusuf al-Jader (nom de guerre Abu Furat al-Jarabulusi), was killed in action during the battle in December 2012. In early 2013, the Union of Battalions of Martyr Colonel Abu Furat was formed in Jarabulus. In June 2013, clashes erupted in the town between the group and the al-Nusra Front and the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, which resulted in ISIL taking full control of Jarabulus. After the capture of Jarabulus by ISIL, the Euphrates Jarabulus Battalions moved its headquarters to the town of Zur Maghar, which is controlled by the YPG. The group attempted to reenter Jarabulus with other FSA factions but they were repelled by ISIL which killed dozens of their fighters. It then formed an alliance with the YPG in the Kobane Canton. Some members regrouped into the Jarabulus Brigade, a small independent faction. After a battle between al-Tawhid Brigade and ISIL in Jarabulus, 6 members of the Jader family, among dozens of dissenters, were beheaded by ISIL in January 2014. In February 2014, the Martyr Abu Furat Battalions as part of the Euphrates Islamic Liberation Front captured several villages near Manbij and Jarabulus from ISIL. In late 2014, the Union of Euphrates Jarabulus Battalions joined Euphrates Volcano. The Jarabulus Brigade initially participated in the defence of the Siege of Kobane but later left the city. In November 2015, the group joined the Syrian Democratic Forces. In late 2016, just after the Manbij offensive which captured the city of Manbij from ISIL and before the Operation Euphrates Shield, the commander of Furat Jarabulus and the newly-formed Jarabulus Military Council, Abdul Sattar al-Jader was assassinated by sniper fire from unknown assailants. Ahmed al-Jader replaced his post as commander amid heavy clashes between the JMC and rival Syrian rebels and the Turkish Armed Forces.

Running career In a 2016 interview Kotka talked about her running background: \\"I have always loved outdoor life and kept active with skiing, biking, hiking, diving, yoga but not running. But in 2010 I signed up to run Liding√∂loppet as a challenge and got obsessed with trail running while practicing for it. That was my thing! Then I took it easy in 2012, 2013 and in January 2014 I decided to go all in. Train more focused. It was a little too focused in 2015. I ran a lot and got injured. In 2016 I took it easier and now I seem to have found a formula that works. It is more fun than ever to run and my body thrives.\\" Personal life Kotka is of Finnish descent through her father who is from Finland.

These groups were formed in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina and reactivated in the aftermaths of the 2016 Louisiana floods, Hurricane Harvey, Hurricane Irma, the 2018 Hidalgo County flood, Hurricane Florence, Tropical Storm Gordon, and Hurricane Michael and now Hurricane Laura. They are credited with rescuing thousands of citizens during those disasters. These groups draw their name from the region's Cajun people, a significant number of whom are private boat owners and skilled boat pilots. Their boats consist of a number of types, but are typically small vessels such as bass boats, jonboats, air boats, and other small, shallow-draft craft easily transported to flooded areas. Background The term Cajun Navy had earlier, unrelated jovial origins before it evolved into its current usage. The earliest documented use of the term occurred in 1964 when outgoing governor Jimmie Davis received \\"a commission as a commodore in the Cajun Navy plus a four-star pirogue for his personal use\\" as a going-away gift by the Greater Lafourche Port Commission. It was also used in 1995 by a sub-krewe of the Krewe of Denham Springs as part of the krewe's Mardi Gras parade theme of \\"And Away We Go.\\" Contemporary usage appears to have been coined in 2005 to describe private boaters who served as volunteer rescuers in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina; it was apparently used as such by then-Tulane University history professor Douglas Brinkley in a speech, as cited in the Baton Rouge Advocate: The term received more currency in 2015, the tenth anniversary of Hurricane Katrina, when commemorative articles in the media referred to the loose organization of south Louisiana boaters. CBS News, for example, reported that year, \\"Hurricane Katrina killed an estimated 1,800 people, but it could have been far worse if not for what became known as 'The Cajun Navy.' Hundreds of people in hundreds of boats gathered in Lafayette, Louisiana, to rescue thousands trapped by floodwaters...\\" Deployments =Hurricane Katrina (2005)= Former Louisiana state senator Nick Gautreaux put out a plea across local television and radio for \\"Anybody [who] wants to go help the people of New Orleans please come to the Acadiana Mall.\\" Between 350 and 400 boats and people showed up. This makeshift flotilla that became known as the Cajun Navy is credited with rescuing more than 10,000 people from flooded homes and rooftops. =South- central Louisiana flood (2016)= In 2016, major flooding struck south-central Louisiana, resulting in even more attention for the informal rescue organization. \\"[M]akeshift flotillas popped up across the region over the weekend,\\" observed USA Today during the disaster. \\"Many are operating under a name familiar in Louisiana: the Cajun Navy.\\" Fortune magazine noted, \\"In the midst of one of the most severe (yet least-reported) natural disasters in recent history, a homegrown volunteer rescue squad known as the Cajun Navy is providing badly needed relief in flood-ravaged Louisiana.\\" The Baton Rouge Advocate summed up the feelings of many when it wrote: \\"The heroes hailed from the Cajun Navy, the nickname for an impromptu flotilla of volunteers who had no admiral, no uniforms, no military medals awaiting them for acts of valor. It was conscience, not a commanding officer, that summoned them into treacherous currents to carry endangered citizens to higher ground.\\" The following year, one rescuer recalled ferrying as many as seven people at a time out of flooded Baton Rouge neighborhoods in his 16-foot boat. Technology was first introduced by one of the boaters in 2016 and played a critical role during the Cajun Navy rescues. At first, people would show up and put their boats in the water without any direction. There was little organization and no way to define which areas had been rescued and which were still in need. One volunteer realized that a couple of mobile phone applications that he used for a game, Zello and Glympse, would be helpful in organizing the rescue attempts. He organized his teammates in the game to come teach boaters and other volunteers how to use the apps for the needed rescues. Eventually, the boaters would be directed by a core group of volunteers who would take requests to be rescued from the Cajun Navy Facebook group page. One volunteer started to gather requests into a Google spreadsheet which was accessible to other volunteers. They vetted the requests by calling phone numbers provided in the posts to the Facebook group page or using Facebook Messenger, then the volunteers used the Zello application to dispatch a nearby boater. Technology was essential to the success of the Cajun Navy. An unknown number of volunteers manned Facebook, using Glympse and Zello to link rescuers with those asking for assistance. =Hurricane Harvey (2017)= In August 2017, the Cajun Navy engaged in rescue operations in response to the major flooding of Southeast Texas by Hurricane Harvey. The Chicago Tribune referred to them \\"roar[ing] into Pasadena, Texas...in high-clearance pickup trucks with bass boats and pirogues like the Cajun Cavalry, ready to help search and rescue efforts alongside first responders who were inundated with thousands of calls across the region\\". Cajun Navy groups formed in the year following the Louisiana flooding performed more than 5,000 rescues in Southeast Texas, throughout cities and towns including Houston, Beaumont, Port Arthur, and Vidor. Multiple teams acted behind the scenes using social media to organize hundreds of citizens. Volunteers acted as citizen dispatchers, relaying requests for rescue from the Cajun Navy Facebook page to those boaters who could perform the rescue via Zello. In recognition of the immense help the Cajun Navy provided, the Houston Thanksgiving Day Parade included a float featuring many of the Cajun Navy members who performed rescues in the flood waters. https://communityimpact.com/guides/houston/the-woodlands/editors- pick/2017/11/20/guide-everything-know-houstons-thanksgiving-day-parade/ =Hurricane Irma (2017)= In cooperation with U.S. Senator Marco Rubio, the Cajun Navy agreed to participate in relief efforts for storm surge victims of Hurricane Irma within central and southern Florida, in September 2017. =Hidalgo County flood (2018)= The Cajun Navy assisted victims of flooding in Hidalgo County, Texas. =Hurricane Florence (2018)= In September 2018 the Cajun Navy was activated and sent to New Bern, North Carolina to assist with rescues in the wake of major flooding from Hurricane Florence. They rescued 160 people, many from the tops of their cars and some using air mattresses because the winds were severe enough to topple boats, until local emergency management told them their help was no longer needed because all rescues could be handled by local first responders. =Tropical Storm Gordon (2018)= Also in September 2018, Cajun Navy members were mobilized in anticipation of possible flooding in New Orleans generated by Tropical Storm Gordon. Future endeavors Although initially informal groups of rescuers, there have been recent efforts to create a much more organized structure for the Cajun Navy. There are now several formal regional groups. These regional groups now include the Scott, Louisiana-based America's Cajun Navy, the Hammond, Louisiana-based Louisiana Cajun Navy, Texas Cajun Navy, the Watson, Louisiana-based Cajun Navy 2016, the Lafayette, Louisiana-based Cajun Navy Acadiana, the New Orleans-based Cajun Navy Relief & Rescue, and the Baton Rouge-based United Cajun Navy. In addition there are also groups known as the \\"Cajun Special Forces\\", the \\"Cajun Army\\", and the ‚ÄúCajun Commissary‚Äù, that assist with post-flood projects like supplying survivors with food, water and supplies, gutting houses, and other various rebuilding efforts.

Although primarily of concern to VPN users, it is also possible to prevent it for proxy and direct internet users.  Process  The vulnerability allows an ISP, as well as any on-path eavesdroppers, to see what websites a user may be visiting. This is possible because the browser's DNS requests are sent to the ISP DNS server directly, and not sent through the VPN. This only occurs with certain types of VPNs, e.g. \\"split-tunnel\\" VPNs, where traffic can still be sent over the local network interface even when the VPN is active. Starting with Windows 8, Microsoft has introduced the \\"Smart Multi-Homed Named Resolution\\". This altered the way Windows 8 handled DNS requests, by ensuring that a DNS request could travel across all available network interfaces on the computer. While there is general consensus that this new method of domain name resolution accelerated the time required for a DNS look-up to be completed, it also exposed VPN users to DNS leaks when connected to a VPN endpoint, because the computer would no longer use only the DNS servers assigned by the VPN service. Instead the DNS request would be sent through all available interfaces, thus the DNS traffic would travel out of the VPN tunnel and expose the user's default DNS servers.  Prevention  Websites exist to allow testing to determine whether a DNS leak is occurring. DNS leaks can be addressed in a number of ways: * Encrypting DNS requests with DNS over HTTPS or DNS over TLS, which prevents the requests from being seen by on-path eavesdroppers. * Using a VPN client which sends DNS requests over the VPN. Not all VPN apps will successfully plug DNS leaks, as it was found in a study by the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation in 2016 when they carried an in-depth research called \\"An Analysis of the Privacy and Security Risks of Android VPN Permission-enabled Apps\\" and found that 84% of the 283 VPN applications on Google Play Store that they tested did leak DNS requests. * Changing DNS servers on local computer for whole network adapters, or setting them to different ones. 3rd party apps are available for this such as NirSoft quicksetdns. * Using Firewall to disable DNS on whole device (usually outgoing connections UDP and less commonly TCP port 53), or setting dns servers to non-existing ones like local 127.0.0.1 or 0.0.0.0 (via command line or 3rd party app if not possible via OS GUI interface). This requires alternate ways of resolving domains like the above mentioned ones, or using in apps with configured proxy, or using proxy helper apps like Proxifier or ProxyCap, which allows resolving domains over proxy. Many apps allow setting manual proxy or using proxy already used by system. * Using completely anonymous web browsers such as Tor Browser which not only makes user anonymous, but also doesn't require any dns to be set up on the operating system. * Using proxy or vpn, system wide, via 3rd party app helpers like Proxifier, or in form of web browser extension. However most extensions in Chrome or Firefox will report false positive working condition even if they did not connect, so 3rd party website for ip and dns leak check is recommended. This false working state usually happens when two proxy or vpn extensions are tried to be used at the same time (e.g. Windscribe VPN and FoxyProxy extensions).

While the concept of poetics goes back to Aristotle, the term descriptive poetics refers to an approach which, according to Brian McHale, represents a middle ground between theoretically oriented approaches and analyses of individual works of literature. David Gorman writes that \\"If criticism is the study of literary works, poetics is the study of the features of those works, that is, the properties they can share: [...] its topic is any shared or shareable feature of literary works.\\"Gorman, David (2011) \\"The Future of Literary Study: An Experiment in Guesswork.\\" Modern Language Quarterly 72:1, p. 5. Overview To McHale, the purpose of descriptive poetics is to give exhaustive accounts of different kinds of objects which can be a group of texts, the entire production of a single author, a particular genre, the style of a period in literary history or even specific styles of literature. McHale argues that the approach is not defined by what it examines but by the level of generalization achieved in this form of literary studies.McHale, Brian (1994) \\"Whatever Happened to Descriptive Poetics?\\", The Point of Theory: Practices of Cultural Analysis (red. Mieke Bal & Inga E. Bour). Amsterdam: Amsterdam University Press, p. 59 The approach was given a formalized forum in the journal PTL: A Journal of Descriptive Poetics and Theory of Literature which only had a short run before it was succeeded by the more successful journal Poetics Today.Mintz, Alan (1984) \\"On the Tel Aviv School of Poetics\\" i Prooftexts, Vol. 4, No. 3 According to literary scholar Uni Margolin, descriptive poetics was a rather prominent form of scholarship in the first half of the 20th century, especially in Germany, but has since \\"been neglected since 1968 because of its low level of theoretisation\\".Margolin, Uni (2007) \\"Response\\" i Journal of Literary Theory, Vol 1, No 1 See also * Poetics * Historical poetics  References   Literature  * Harshav, Benjamin (2007) Explorations in Poetics.

The book begins with Radhika making arrangements regarding her marriage with Brijesh Gulati who works in the Facebook company in San Francisco. She later reveals her childhood and life in Delhi, as a nerdy personality in contrast to her elder sister Aditi. She also communicates her thoughts and decisions to her inner judgemental voice, or \\"mini-me\\" as called. While trying to engage conversation with Brijesh, she is unexpectedly contacted by Debashish \\"Debu\\" Sen who wishes to meet her, to which she refuses. Then he suddenly arrives at the resort in Goa where the marriage ceremony of Radhika was held. She is further shocked when he infiltrates the puja bhajan ceremony at the wedding reception. She later meets him in the hotel gym and admonishes him for his past behavior. It then flashbacks to four years ago, when Radhika began her job training at Goldman Sachs. One evening she was introduced to Debu through Avinash her batchmate from IIMA. The two start dating, eventually starting a live in relationship. She applies to Distressed Debt in Goldman and becomes involved in a gruelling schedule. One year later, Radhika decides to plan a future with Debu, to which he is skeptical. Furthermore, when Radhika gets a bonus of 150,000 dollars for the previous year and tells Debu, he does not react as Radhika expects. The two bicker for a long time, with Debu calling off the relationship due to being pressurized by Radhika about marriage, and wanting instead a simple girl as a housewife for his partner. One month later, Radhika tries to make amends by quitting her job and proposing to Debu, which backfires when she finds Debu with another woman. Facing depression, she opts for a move to Hong Kong, thereby cutting all ties with New York. In the Hong Kong GS office, she adapts well and even gets a big investment deal at Philippines. During her trips to a luxury in Philippines, she gets to know her boss's boss Neel Gupta who is 20 years older than her and finds him very attractive. After signing the deal with the resort owner, after the celebratory dinner, Radhika and Neel end up sleeping together by the beach. After the initial hiccup (on how to go about this, he is married with children), Neel and Radhika continue with their passionate affair each time they have a business trip together. After about a year, Radhika comes to her senses when she doesn't see a future with Neel. She wants to resign, and Neel tells her, leave me, but not the organisation. Thus, she leaves to London Goldman Sachs office after breaking up with Neel. Radhika tries to adjust her new life in London and her mother continuously tries to push her for an arranged marriage. She finally agrees and decides to look through some profiles on Shaadi.com. She connects with Brijesh Gulati and said yes for a wedding, which makes her mother happy. Radhika wanted a destination wedding and chose at Marriott Hotel in Goa which costs her 150,000 USD. In the midst of her mehendi session, she receives a text from Neel out of the blue asking her about her wedding. As she couldn't reply (with hands full of henna), Neel decides to show up at the same hotel wanting to speak something very important to her in person. Both her ex-boyfriends realised they want her and proposed a plan to get married leaving the Gulatis behind. Radhika becomes extremely confused trying to manage two ex-boyfriends and one future husband, annoying aunts and family members who don't leave her alone. She finally decides to call both Debu and Neel the morning before her wedding and tell them how she feels. She turned down both their proposal and meets Brijesh to cancel the wedding. Radhika apologised to everyone and proceed to take a year off to travel and discover what she truly wants. After several months, she contacted Brijesh when she was en route to San Francisco. They met for coffee, reconnected and made plans to watch a concert while Radhika helps Brijesh on his new start-up company. Reception One Indian Girl' received mixed to positive reviews from critics. It has received 3.1 stars out of 5 on Goodreads and 4.3 out of 5 on Snapdeal. A. R. Rahman praised Chetan Bhagat for expressing his feelings and articulating a particular point of view. The topic of feminism has attracted some controversy due to the mention of The Beauty Myth by Naomi Wolf. The Indian Express calls the book \\"a likeable handbook for feminists\\". Most sources describe the book as \\"an improvement over Half Girlfriend\\".  Plagiarism controversy  Bhagat was accused of plagiarising this book from a short story written by Anvita Bajpai. The court ordered a suspension of this book for six months after its launch.

The widow of former President Islam Karimov, she was a highly influential figure throughout her husband's rule. Karimova, together with Rustam Inoyatov, the head of the National Security Service, was expected to play a key role in choosing Karimov's successor. Early life and family Born in the harsh years following World War II into a military family, Karimova, who is of Russian and Tajik origin, moved with her parents to the Fergana Region in 1952. Her family has been described as influential. She has a younger sister, Tamara Sobirova. Tatyana worked as a researcher at the Institute of Economics of the Academy of Sciences of Uzbekistan. Biography Islam Karimov was previously married to his first wife, Natalya Petrovna Kuchmi, from 1964 until their divorce during the mid-1960s. In 1967, he married Tatyana Akbarovna. Tatyana Karimova was working as a researcher at the Institute of Economics at the Academy of Sciences of Uzbekistan at the time of her wedding to Karimov. They had two daughters, Gulnara Karimova (born 1972) and Lola Karimova-Tillyaeva (born 1978). Additionally, they shared five grandchildren: (Islam Karimova Jr., Iman Karimova, Mariam Tillyaeva, Umar Tillyaev, Safiya Tillyaeva). . Tatyana Karimova accompanied with her daughter Lola and PM Mirziyoyev met Russian President Vladimir Putin in Samarkand on 6 September 2016 In 2013, a feud between Tatyana Karimova and her elder daughter, Gulnara Karimova, spilled onto Twitter. Gulnara Karimova accused her mother of trying to \\"destroy\\" for attempting to prevent the arrest of her cousin, Akbarali Abdullayev. She also accused her younger sister, Lola Karimova-Tillyaeva, of sorcery. Gulnara Karimova's Twitter account was suspended shortly after the accusations and she is believed to have been placed under house arrest in 2014. Karimova served as the first First Lady of Uzbekistan from the country's independence until Islam Karimov's death in 2016. She was known to engage in charity work and official state functions. However, she was a highly influential advisor on many of her husband's policies. Tatyana Karimova was expected to be a key figure in choosing her husband's successor in 2016 without being expected to seek the presidency herself. She was seen as an ally of Rustam Inoyatov, the head of the National Security Service, who was also seen as likely help choose Uzbekistan's next president.

She is a member of Magnum Photos and has published four books: Ou Menya, I am About to Call it a Day, As it May Be, and S√®te#15. Life and work Depoorter was born in Belgium. She received a master's degree in photography at the Royal Academy of Fine Arts in Ghent in 2009. The relationships Depoorter establishes with the subjects of her photographs lie at the foundation of her artistic practice. Accidental encounters are the starting point, and how these interactions naturally develop dictates the nature of Depoorter‚Äôs work. Many of her self- initiated projects are about intimate situations in families and in peoples' homes. For her graduation project and her first book, Ou Menya (2011), she made three trips to Russia, photographing people in their homes that she met whilst travelling around. The series won the 2009 Magnum Expression Award. Depoorter made the work for her second book, I am About to Call it a Day (2014) in a similar way whilst hitchhiking and driving around the U.S. However several recent projects have been the result of Depoorter questioning the medium. In As it May Be, she gradually became more aware of her status as an outsider, both culturally and as a photographer. So, in 2017, she revisited Egypt with the first draft of the book, inviting people to write comments directly onto the photographs. In S√®te#15, and also Dvalemodus, a short film she co-directed together with Mattias De Craene, she began to see her subjects as actors. Although she portrayed them in their true environments, she tried to project her own story onto the scenes, fictionalizing the realities of her subjects in a way that blurred the lines between their world and hers. In the ongoing project Agata, a project about a young women Depoorter met at a striptease bar in Paris in October 2017, she explores her interest in collaborative portraiture. It‚Äôs an example of Depoorter‚Äôs interest in finding people that can work with her in telling a story. These stories are always partially hers, and partially theirs. Depoorter became a nominee member of Magnum Photos in 2012, an associate member in 2014, and a full member in 2016. She is the fourth Belgian member of the agency, after Carl De Keyzer, Martine Franck, Harry Gruyaert.. Depoorter has won the Magnum Expression Award, The Larry Sultan Award and the Prix Levallois.

As a two-year-old in 1988 he showed outstanding promise and was rated one of the best colts of his generation in Europe, finishing first in all four of his races including the Washington Singer Stakes, Champagne Stakes and Dewhurst Stakes (a dead heat with Scenic). In the following spring he won the Newmarket Stakes but ran badly when third favourite for the 1989 Epsom Derby. He was euthanised later that year after he was found to be suffering from cancer of the spine. Background Prince of Dance was a bay horse with a broad white blaze and two white socks bred in Ireland by the Ballymacoll Stud. During his racing career he was owned by Ballymacoll's part-owner Michael Sobell and was trained at West Ilsley in Berkshire by Dick Hern. During the latter part of the 1988 season, when Hern was recovering from hear surgery, the colt was trained by bis assistant Neil Graham. Prince of Dance was ridden in all but one of his races by the Scottish jockey Willie Carson. Prince of Dance was from the first crop of foals sired by Sadler's Wells, who won the Irish 2,000 Guineas, Eclipse Stakes and Irish Champion Stakes in 1984 went on to be the Champion sire on fourteen occasions. Prince of Dance was the first foal of Sun Princess, an outstanding racemare who won The Oaks, Yorkshire Oaks and St Leger in 1983. Her dam, Sunny Valley, also produced Saddlers' Hall and was the direct female ancestor of Millenary and Conduit. Sun Princess herself went on to produce Ballet Queen who became an influential broodmare in Japan. Racing career =1988: two-year-old season= Prince of Dance made his racecourse debut in the Sandwich Maiden Stakes over seven furlongs at Ascot Racecourse of 23 July. Starting at odds of 5/2 in an eight-runner field he took the lead two furlongs out and won by half a length from Batshoof, a colt who went on to win the Prince of Wales's Stakes. The colt was then moved up in class for the Listed Washington Singer Stakes at Newbury Racecourse on 12 August. Starting the 6/4 favourite he took the lead approaching the final furlong and drew way in the closing stages to win by six lengths from Zalazl. He was subsequently disqualified when it was found that he had been ineligible to run in the race. At the time the Washington Singer Stakes was restricted to horses whose sires had won over a distance of one and a half miles, but Sadler's Wells had never won a race at a distance beyond ten furlongs. Prince of Dance was stepped up in class gain for the Group Two Champagne Stakes at Doncaster Racecourse on 9 September and started the 1/2 favourite ahead of six opponents. The best-fancied of his rivals were the Henry Cecil-trained Shining Steel, Chief's Image (third in the Phoenix Stakes) and Elmayer. After tracking the early leaders he took the lead a furlong and a half from the finish and won by two lengths from Shining Steel with Free Sweater three lengths back in third. On 14 October Prince of Dance started 6/4 favourite for Britain's most prestigious race for juveniles, the Dewhurst Stakes over seven furlongs at Newmarket Racecourse. His five rivals were Opening Verse, Saratogan (from the Vincent O'Brien stable), Zayyani, Samoan (Bernard Van Cutsem Stakes) and the 33/1 outsider Scenic. Samoan led the field before Scenic went to the front a quarter of a mile out with Prince of Dance moving up smoothly to dispute the lead approaching the final furlong. The race devolved into a struggle between Prince of Dance and Scenic and the two colts crossed the line together with Saratogan just behind in third place. After studying the photo-finish the judge declared a dead heat, making Prince of Dance and Scenic the joint-winners of the Group One contest. Dick Hern, who was hospitalised at the time later watched video replay of the race and said \\"That horse is carrying its tail slightly to one side, has it always done that? You need to get that checked out.\\" Marcus Tregoning who was an assistant to Hern believed that his mentor had spotted the first sign of the spinal problem that led to the horse's death a year later. =1989: three-year-old season= Prince of Dance had been regarded as the stable's leading classic contender, ahead of Al Hareb and Nashwan but had training problems in early spring and bypassed the 2000 Guineas. He began his second season in the Newmarket Stakes over ten furlongs on 5 May in which he carried top weight of 129 pounds and started the 4/6 favourite against three opponents. He got the better of the Barry Hills-trained Observation Post inside the final furlong and won by half a length with the pair finishing well clear of the other two runners. On 7 June Prince of Dance was one of twelve colts to contest the 210th running of The Derby over one and a half miles and started the 11/2 third choice in the betting behind the 2000 Guineas winner Nashwan and Cacoethes. With Carson opting to ride Nashwan, the ride on Prince of Dance went to the American Steve Cauthen. After making some progress approaching the final turn Prince of Dance faded badly in the straight and finished tenth, more than twenty lengths behind the winner. Investigations into the horse's condition following his poor run at Epsom revealed that he was suffering from cancer of the spine and he was euthanised in late 1989. Assessment In 1988, the independent Timeform organisation gave Prince of Dance a rating of 128, making him their top-rated juvenile alongside Scenic.

In a long career, Madsen moved from race rowing to ocean challenges before switching in 2011 to athletics, winning a bronze medal in the shot put at the 2012 Summer Paralympics in London. Madsen and teammate Helen Taylor were the first women to row across the Indian Ocean. She died in June 2020 while attempting a solo row from Los Angeles to Honolulu. Paralympic Medalist Angela Madsen Dies On Solo Rowing Trip Across Pacific Ocean Early life and education Madsen was born in Xenia, Ohio, on May 10, 1960. Educated at Fairborn Baker High School in Fairborn, Ohio, she became a single parent at the age of seventeen, which impeded her chance for an athletics scholarship. Military career Most of Madsen's immediate family were military, so when her brothers told her she \\"couldn't make it as a marine\\", it made her determined to join. She enlisted in the Marines, leaving her daughter with her parents until she completed basic training. After passing training, the Marine Corps provided Madsen with a home for her and her daughter. She was sent to Fort McClellan in Alabama to train as a military police officer and her first duty station was at the Marine Corps Air Station El Toro, near Irvine, California. At El Toro, she joined the women's basketball team, at center, and when the team competed at the Marine Corps West Coast Regional Basketball Tournament, Madsen was scouted by the women's Marine Corps team. =Spinal injury and surgery= In 1980, at her first Marine Corps basketball training session, she fell on the court and another player stepped on her back, rupturing two discs in her spine. This in turn led Madsen to undergo surgery to her back, but a string of errors resulted in her suffering an L1 incomplete spinal cord injury and paraplegia. The US military refused to pay for Madsen's medical bills following the accident, and, in the dispute that followed, Madsen lost her home and her marriage fell apart. She fell into depression and became homeless, sometimes sleeping in her wheelchair in front of Disneyland. Paralympic career Madsen's life turned around when, after attending a National Veterans Games, she was introduced to wheelchair basketball. She took up the sport and began to rebuild her life. The defining point in her recovery came after she fell onto subway tracks in San Francisco and feared that she had broken her neck. This event made her reassess her life as a disabled person, and she decided to live her life to the fullest. She wrote an autobiography, Rowing Against the Wind, published in 2014. =Rowing career= Madsen was introduced to rowing after her wheelchair basketball sponsor invited her to a learn-to-row event in Dana Point. She found she was a natural at the sport and liked that she did not need to use a wheelchair to participate. In 2002, the International Rowing Federation added adaptive rowing to the World Rowing Championships, and Madsen, classified as a trunk-and-arms (TA) competitor, was selected to race at the 2002 World Rowing Championships. She finished in silver place in the single sculls. In the next three years she entered each of the World Championships, winning the gold medal in the doubles sculls in every tournament. While a competitive rower, Madsen was also enjoying ocean-rowing events, and from her home in California she had access to the Pacific. She began rowing between Newport, California, and Dana Point, and began entering 20-mile races. After Madsen met Louisville Adaptive Rowing Program volunteer Tori Murden, who was the first American to row the Atlantic solo, she became inspired to undertake an ocean journey. Over the following years Madsen took on multiple ocean treks. In 2007, she became the first woman with a disability to row across the Atlantic Ocean. Two years later she became, along with Helen Taylor, one of the first two women to row across the Indian Ocean.; Madsen was also part of a team that circumnavigated Great Britain. In 2008, Madsen represented the United States at her first Summer Paralympics, competing at the 2008 Games in Beijing in the mixed double sculls with William Brown, though they did not progress through the repechage and finished seventh. =Athletics career= Madsen made her first appearance for the United States as a F56 track-and-field athlete in 2011. Her results leading up to the games qualified her for the 2012 Summer Paralympics in London, competing in the shot put (F54‚Äì56) and javelin throw (F54/55/56).

Early life Peterson was born in Stockholm in 1923 and grew up in √ñrebro, before returning to Stockholm where he studied to become an illustrator. He went to work in an advertising agency in Stockholm. A relative invited him to come to the US and in 1948 he moved to New York, where he got a job as illustrator at the department store Lord & Taylor. Although of service age, he did not serve in World War II. Career When he left Sweden he was given a Rolleiflex camera as a leaving present from the Gumelius advertising agency where he was working. Self-taught, he honed his skills as a photographer practicing street photography on the streets of New York. In 1954 he met his future wife Patricia, who at the time was fashion editor of The New York Times, at a cocktail party in Westhampton. He caught her eye as he was wearing khaki pants and watering flowers at the party. He married her the same year. Peterson credits her with helping him jumpstart his career as a photographer. In the 1950s he took on several assignments from magazines, picking up the nickname Yes for his willingness to take on assignments. After his wife became vice president at Henri Bendel, the latter company changed its advertising from illustrations to half-page advertorials using his photographs. Working for Henri Bendel he produced a new set of photographs weekly: doing the session on Thursday, with the photographs ready the following day and published in the Sunday edition of The New York Times a couple of days later. This helped cement his reputation as a fashion photographer. From the 1950s to 1980s his work was featured in and on the cover of several magazines, including GQ, Mademoiselle, Town & Country, and L'Officiel, amongst others. Despite his reputation as a fashion photographer, he never worked for Vogue; he turned them down as they insisted on choosing the models. He was the first photographer to photograph British model Twiggy in America when she arrived in 1967. Later that year African-American model Naomi Sims approached him to photograph her. She had been turned down by several photographic agencies which told her that her skin was too dark. Peterson became the first photographer to photograph her, and his photograph of her appeared on the Autumn 1967 cover of The New York Times fashion supplement, the first time an African-American female appeared on the cover of that magazine. Early in Peterson's career, fashion photographer Arthur Elgort worked as his assistant for four months. Peterson's use of natural light in turn influenced Elgort's work. Model and later fashion designer Linda Rodin also worked as his assistant for three years in the late 1970s. His work has been described as groundbreaking and pioneering, and has been rated as being in the same category as Irving Penn, Richard Avedon, and Helmut Newton. He would often photograph lavishly-dressed models in \\"mundane, vulgar settings\\". His work is noted for its staging and composition; he often used humorous or dramatic scenarios to convey the image and pioneered \\"a more informal, personal approach to fashion photography\\". Apart from his fashion work he also photographed Salvador Dal√≠ and Duke Ellington. Peterson retired in 1986. In January 2015 a retrospective of his work, From The Archive, was shown at the Turn Gallery in New York. His work has also been shown at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York and the Victoria and Albert Museum in London.

The campaigners of \\"Ready To Wait\\" asserted their willingness to respect the traditions regarding entry to the Sabarimala temple. It started as a social media campaign with the hashtag #ReadyToWait and soon gained momentum as Hindu women from all over the country took to social media to show their support. The women devotees eventually petitioned the Supreme Court to intervene in the pending litigation on Sabarimala temple entry for women of a certain age, through \\"People for Dharma\\", a Chennai-based organization. The lawyer for \\"People for Dharma\\", J Sai Deepak argued for the rights of Lord Ayyappa, the deity of Sabarimala temple as a distinct legal personality for which he received praise by the Supreme Court of India. On 28 September 2018 Indian Supreme Court ruled in favor of the petitioners allowing entry of women in Sabarimala temple with a 4:1 majority with the only female judge, Justice Indu Malhotra being the dissenting opinion. Travancore Devaswom Board is expected to file an appeal against this decision.  Introduction  According to the legend, Lord Ayyappa, the main deity of the Sabarimala temple, has taken a vow to remain in the state of eternal celibacy (nitya-brahmachari) in his form at Sabarimala Temple. As such the shrine restricts entry to women of reproductive age (10 to 50 yrs). This restriction was previously challenged as well, however, the Kerala High Court had upheld the restriction in its 1991 judgement. An organization called \\"Indian Young Lawyers Association\\" filed a public interest litigation in 2006 but it didn't gain national prominence until January 2016 when the Supreme Court asked the Government of Kerala and Travancore Devaswom Board to submit their response with regards to temple entry issue. The case was finally referred to a five-member bench by Supreme Court of India in October 2017. This was around the same time when the Supreme Court of India had decided to uplift the restrictions barring entry of women to Haji Ali Dargah (a Muslim shrine which also restricts entry of women), where the petitioners had also argued that restricting entry amounts to discrimination against women. This led to the creation of a social media campaign using the hashtag of #ReadyToWait, where women devotees of Lord Ayyappa posted their photographs holding a placard bearing the slogan #ReadyToWait.. The campaign went viral within a day and was covered by mainstream media. The campaigners, led by five women devotees from Kerala, Shilpa Nair, Anjali George, Aishwarya Krishnan, Suja Pavithran, and Padma Pillai opposed this petition arguing that the restriction of entry is due to the celibate nature of the deity and therefore, not discriminatory against women. As such, respecting the traditions of the temple and the will of the deity, they are ready to wait until the appropriate age to visit Sabarimala. The campaigners also pointed out that the tradition at Sabarimala is based on the concept that Ayyappa of Sabarimala is in the form of a KumƒÅra (teenager) observing Brahmacharya. They contrast this form of Ayyappa from other Ayyappa temples like Kulathupuzha, Aryankavu, and Achankovil. In these other three temples, Ayyappa is in three different forms namely BƒÅla (child) in Kulathupuzha, BhƒÅrya-sametha (lit. accompanying wife) in Achankovil and TƒÅpasa (ascetic) in Aryankavu. These four pratishtas (installations) denote the four stages of human life according to Hindu scriptures. Except in Sabarimala, where Ayyappa is in his Brahmachari phase, there is no restriction on entry of women in the other three temples or in any other Ayyappa temple around the globe. The overwhelming response to the social media campaign emboldened the organizers to file an application of intervention at the Supreme Court. People For Dharma was created as their legal entity. Their lawyer, J Sai Deepak, appeared in the Supreme Court of India on 26 July 2018 where he argued for the rights of Lord Ayyappan as a distinct legal personality. According to Press Trust of India's report in Business Standard: > \\"The lawyer, who was initially granted 10-15 minutes time in the forenoon to > put forth his submissions, argued for more than one-and-half hours without > being asked by any of the judges to stop and was quick to respond to queries > from the bench. > Arguing for the \\"constitutional right\\" of Lord Ayappa, he said the deity's > will to remain celibate needed to be respected under Articles 21 (right to > life and personal liberty) and 25(1) (freedom of religion) of the > Constitution.\\" During the hearing, lawyers for the defendants pointed out that there are Hindu temples which forbid entry of men on particular days and contend that such practices are part of the history and cultural diversity of Indic Civilization that ought to be respected.

Biography Born about 1683, Crofts was the natural son of James Scott, 1st Duke of Monmouth, by his mistress Eleanor Needham, a daughter of Sir Robert Needham. His father led the failed Monmouth Rebellion of 1685 and was beheaded in July of that year. The surname Crofts had been used by his father. Crofts entered the Army in the early part of the reign of Queen Anne, rose to the rank of colonel by 1706, and in 1718 succeeded Sir Robert Rich in the command of a regiment of dragoons, which was disbanded later the same year. On 6 July 1719 he obtained the colonelcy of the regiment of dragoons later known as the 9th Queen's Royal Lancers, and in 1727 he was promoted to the rank of major- general. He died at his house in Downing Street, London, in March 1732.Richard Cannon, Historical Record of the Ninth, or the Queen's Royal Regiment of Lancers (London, 1841) p. 59. Descendants Allan Fea states that Crofts married a daughter of Sir Thomas Taylor (‚Äúafter 1706, when he is described as single‚Äù) and had a daughter, Maria Julia; and that she married first a Mr Dalziel and secondly R.

It presents an enthusiastic description of a technological utopia in which machines improve and protect the lives of humans. Its tone is also often read as ironic, suggesting in Brautigan a more critical relationship the emergent techno-utopic perspectives of the time. It is Brautigan's most frequently reprinted poem. Synopsis and analysis Brautigan wrote the poem and eponymous collection between January 17-26, 1967, while a poet-in- residence at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, California. The poem describes a technological utopia in which humans and technology work together for the greater good. Brautigan writes about \\"mammals and computers liv[ing] together in mutually programming harmony\\", with technology acting as caretakers while \\"we are free of our labors and joined back to nature.\\" Reviewers disagree whether it should be taken earnestly or ironically. Most critics take the poem as a counterculture, communitarian adoption of Cold War- era technological visions. Brautigan's publisher, Claude Hayward, said it \\"caught me with its magical references to benign machines keeping order ... [which] fit right in with our optimism over the promise of the computer\\". In Vijay Nambisan's review for The Hindu in 2000, he said: \\"You cannot write a poem like this today. It is too childlike, too innocent. Indeed, college friends who were moved by Brautigan's work twenty years ago would now laugh at me for choosing it. That's more or less what happened to Brautigan.\\" Others have interpreted it as an ironic, mocking critique of the technologically enabled utopia it purports to long for. According to Stanford's Carlos Seligo, there is an irony in the poem that \\"is as subtle and complex as his mixed metaphors\\", which Seligo says are \\"always doing at least three‚Äîand often four, five, or six things at once.\\" Robert J. Grangeware noted how unusual it is for American poets to take a positive view of our relationship with technology, but if viewed as ironic it \\"joins the mainstream of antitechnological American verse.\\" Publication history The poem was first published by the Communication Company in 1967, type-written on an mimeographed broadside with both the title and imprint hand-written. It was the title poem in the April 1967 collection of the same name, published in April 1967. 1,500 copies of the 36-page work were printed at the Communication Company, and all were given away for free. It was included with the rest of the contents of the 1967 collection, along with other previously published collections and new material, in The Pill versus the Springhill Mine Disaster (1968). Brautigan gave the poem to The Diggers to include in their August 1968 pamphlet, The Digger Papers. The 24-page pamphlet was published in The Realist issue 81, and another 40,000 copies were printed by the Diggers and given away for free. \\"All Watched Over by Machines of Loving Grace\\" is Brautigan's most frequently reprinted poem. In the original 1967 publication, Brautigan included a copyleft statement which retains copyright but grants permission to reprint any poem in All Watched Over by Machines of Loving Grace so long as it's given away for free. Legacy The documentary series All Watched Over by Machines of Loving Grace was named after the poem, which is a favorite of director Adam Curtis. Its second part includes a recording of Brautigan doing a reading. According to the Chicago Reader, \\"For all the frenzy of the images, what dominates the sequence are Brautigan's voice and the languid piece of symphonic music on the soundtrack.\\" At the Palais de Tokyo, the poem inspired a show of the same name in 2017, curated by Yoann Gourmel. It began with a poster for the poem, and included works which Art in Americas Federico Florian said superficially fulfill Brautigan's dreams, \\"[evoking] a present tense where technology has imbued every aspect of human life, and therefore reshaped the mechanisms of our affections.\\" References External links *Scanned copy of the first 1967 broadside *All Watched Over by Machines of Loving Grace at Brautigan.net Works by Richard Brautigan 1967 poems Utopian fiction American poems ","title":"All Watched Over by Machines of Loving Grace"},{"id":"51503187","text":"William John Button (30 November 1903 ‚Äì 10 March 1969) was a British soldier and one of the last recipients of the Empire Gallantry Medal before this award was superseded by the George Cross.

They are genealogically related to the other Samaale, but in particular to the Garjante, Gaalje'el, Masare, Isa (Saransor) and 'Owrmale, with which they share the same ancestor Gardhere Samaale.  History  When Arthur Donaldson Smith traveled through what is now Bare woreda in 1895, he found that the Degodia were neighbors of the Afgab clan (whom they were at endless war with), their territory stretching east to the Weyib and Dawa Rivers.Donaldson-Smith, Through Unknown African Countries: the first expedition from Somaliland to Lake Rudolph (London, 1897), p. 143 The Degodia are said to have originated around the rivers Dawa, Parma and Ganale Daria in southeastern Ethiopia and from Eel Ali in Somalia, where clansmen are still present today. The Degodia community across the world are united under one leader called Wabar. The current Wabar (King) is Wabar Abdille Wabar Abdi. The Degodia nation has a unique traditional system of leadership/authority. Supreme authority is vested in the Wabar and exercised through a consultative process that brings together community representatives (guurti) and council of elders. The Wabar has got 15 advisors and over 100 council of elders. The Degodia nation across the world is united under one leadership of the Wabar. Therefore his traditional jurisdiction transcends space. Succession in the Wabar system of leadership is determined by descent. The crown is inherited through family lineage. Pedigree plays a critical role in determining who is crowned as the next Wabar.

He discussed student protests, consequences of the Vietnam War, and Lyndon B. Johnson's leadership of the country. Background On March 16, 1968, Senator Robert F. Kennedy declared his candidacy for the Presidency. At 9:00 AM on March 18, Kennedy arrived at Kansas State University in Manhattan, Kansas, to give his first campaign speech. As a Landon Lecture, it had been scheduled long beforehand. In choosing Kansas State for his first appearance, Kennedy's campaign was hoping to attract a large number of student volunteers in a politically diverse region. The speech The 50 minute speech was written by Adam Walinsky. It was delivered in Ahearn Fieldhouse, where about 14,000 students had gathered. =Summary= Kennedy was anxious and unsure how the young crowd would receive him. He informally opened with a joke on the planned Vietnam Commission: The crowd was surprised by this humor but received it well. Kennedy then began his written speech with a quote from Kansas native William Allen White: This was also well received. He nervously continues on with his speech, stammering in a few places while his right leg shook. He gained more confidence as the audience became more enthusiastic. About ten minutes in, Kennedy began discussing President Lyndon B. Johnson's foreign policy and the Vietnam War: The audience cheered. With his emotion increasing, Kennedy admitted his role in the escalation of the war: Kennedy then approached the climax of his speech, raising his right fist into the air and speaking fervently: Kennedy looked up from his written text and improvised the final part of his speech: The crowd cheered wildly. Hundreds of students surrounded Kennedy as he attempted to leave, scratching his hands and pulling off his cuff links. Photographer Stanley Tretick, surprised by the hysteria, exclaimed, \\"This is Kansas, fucking Kansas! He's going all the fucking way!\\" Aftermath Kennedy continued on to Lawrence later that afternoon, where he would give another speech at the University of Kansas, incorporating many of the same elements in the first one.

The inhabitants held out until 15 June 1642 when they surrendered and went to Drogheda. John Simpson of Killeshandra also made a deposition about the siege of Keelagh: When Croaghan and Keelagh surrendered, John McKiernan was one of the signatories to the surrender agreement: Siege of Clonmel During the Cromwellian conquest of Ireland, the Clonmel garrison changed as the arrival of the Puritan army through Kilkenny became imminent. In November 1649, the town's mayor, John Bennet White, wrote to the Duke of Ormond seeking military assistance. Colonel Oliver Stephenson and part of the old Confederate army, mostly from County Clare, took up quarters. However these southern Confederates were not fully trusted by the townspeople, particularly after the fall of Carrick on Suir due to treachery. Ormond arrived in person at the end of the month and the Clare men were replaced by experienced soldiers from Ulster under Hugh Dubh O'Neill, a veteran of siege warfare in the Thirty Years' War. Under his command were 1,500 soldiers from the Irish Ulster army, mostly from the modern counties of Tyrone and Cavan. Included in O'Neill's command was a regiment commanded by Colonel Philip O'Reilly. A muster of these troops took place at Clonmel on 3 January 1650 and one of O'Reilly's companies was led by Captain C√∫ Connacht M√°g Tighearn√°n. The muster reads- (16) Captain Coochonaght McKearnan's company, consisting of Captain, Lieutenant, Ensign, one Sargent, one drum, three Corporalls, 13 Musketteers 35 pikemen, and 8 unarmed men, present; 6 sick by certificate, and one Sargent prisoner with the enemy, as the Captain protesteth. Oliver Cromwell besieged the town in April 1650. He knew that O'Neill's garrison and supplies were severely depleted and planned to try a fresh assault with close artillery support to batter the town and its defenders. O'Neill's men were out of ammunition and slipped away under cover of darkness ‚Äì making their way to Waterford. Clonmel was then surrendered to Cromwell.

Built about 1835, it is a fine example of vernacular late Federal period architecture. It was given to the local historical society by descendants of Marvin Newton, the likely builder, in 1937, and has been a museum property since them. It is open on limited weekends during summer months. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980. Description and history The Marvin Newton House stands near the northern end of the dispersed rural village of Brookfield Center, on the east side of Ridge Road opposite its junction with Crossover Road. It is a 2-1/2 story wood frame structure with a gabled roof and clapboarded exterior. A single brick chimney pierces the roof near the ridgeline off-center to the right. The main facade is symmetrical, with five bays. The entrance is in the center bay, framed by simple pilasters and a corniced entablature. The building corners have plain narrow corner boards, and the sash windows are simply framed. The interior is virtually unaltered since its construction, and is like the exterior reflective of late Federal period styling. with The house was built about 1835 for Marvin Newton, a blacksmith. Its Federal style is notably late, because by then the Greek Revival had already supplanted the style as a predominant style in domestic architecture. Its principal exterior alterations are the replacement of the front door, and the removal of the upper portion of the left chimney. The building was given to the local historical society in 1937 by Newton's descendants, and is open during the summer as a museum.

It has an area of . The reserve extends along the Purus River from just below the town of Pauini to the west, down to the town of L√°brea to the east. The Purus River has muddy waters and often shifts its bed. The reserve is largely surrounded by indigenous territories. The Canutama Extractive Reserve is downstream from the M√©dio Purus Extractive Reserve. The Iquiri National Forest lies to the south. Temperatures range from with an average of . Vegetation includes dense alluvial rainforest and dense tropical lowland rainforest. Tree species include Piranhea trifoliata, Brazil nut (Bertholletia excelsa), rubber tree (Hevea brasiliensis), Hevea spruceana and Parkia pendula. The reserve is occupied by about 92 indigenous or riverine communities whose main economic activities are collection of forest products such as Brazil nuts, copa√≠ba, andiroba, rubber, a√ßa√≠, urucur√≠ and bacaba, and sustainable fishing. History The reserve was created in response to a request to IBAMA in 2001 by the local extractive community association for the right to occupy the land and to expel communities that were degrading the environment. The M√©dio Purus Extractive Reserve was created by federal decree on 8 May 2008. It is administered by the Chico Mendes Institute for Biodiversity Conservation (ICMBio). It is classed as IUCN protected area category VI (protected area with sustainable use of natural resources). It aims to protect the livelihoods of the traditional residents and ensure the use and conservation of renewable natural resources traditionally used by these communities. On 18 September 2008 the Instituto Nacional de Coloniza√ß√£o e Reforma Agr√°ria (INCRA ‚Äì National Institute for Colonisation and Agrarian Reform) recognized the reserve as supporting 900 families, who would qualify for PRONAF support. This was revised to 1,400 families of 30 December 2008. On 29 April 2010 INCRA and ICMBio agreed to incorporate into the reserve the rural properties named Seringal Quichi√£, Seringal Parij√≥s I and Seringal Parij√≥s II, with a total area of . The deliberative council was established on 4 November 2010. An ordinance of 9 January 2012 provided for a consistent and integrated approach to preparing management plans for the conservation units in the BR-319 area of influence. These are the Abufari Biological Reserve, Cuni√£ Ecological Station, Nascentes do Lago Jari and Mapinguari national parks, Balata-Tufari, Humait√° and Iquiri national forests, and the Lago do Capan√£-Grande, Rio Ituxi, M√©dio Purus and Lago do Cuni√£ extractive reserves.

Based on the manga series of the same name, written and illustrated by Matcha Hazuki. It was released in Japan by Shochiku on February 18, 2017. Plot High school student and aspiring artist Yuki Hase falls in love at first sight with Kaori Fujimiya after the latter narrowly manages to pass down a borrowed French dictionary Yuki left behind inside a train. To his joy, Yuki learns that he and Kaori share class for their second year. However, Kaori seems to have forgotten their meeting. When he introduces himself again, she rejects his offer of friendship. Yuki later finds out that she has similarly rejected other offers since her transfer 3 months ago and is thus regarded as a pariah within the school. Nevertheless, Yuki strives for Kaori's friendship, gaining the attention of his teacher, Mr. Inoue. Inoue tells him that due to an accident, Kaori suffers from both retrograde and anterograde amnesia; any memory other than that of her parents is suppressed after a week. Undaunted, Yuki has made up his mind to become Kaori's friend in anyway. To remind her of him and other things, he gives her a shared journal, where the two can share their memories every week. By this method, the two slowly grow closer and Kaori becomes more and more open. In summer, Yuki invites Kaori to attend a fireworks festival alongside his friends Shogo Kiryu and Saki Yamagishi. There, Kaori runs into her middle school friends, Hajime Kujo and Mayu Kondo, the former of whom has just transferred from Tokyo to the same school as Yuki and Kaori. Unable to remember them, Kaori attempts to excuse herself, but experiences flashbacks when Kujo calls her a \\"traitor\\" and passes out. When she wakes up, she appears to remember him in personal terms. That autumn, the school holds a fair. Mayu visits the school again to meet Kaori, in the process informing Saki, Kujo, and Shogo of the latter's condition. She reveals that she had indirectly caused Kaori's accident and amnesia. During middle school, when Kujo had to transfer to Tokyo, he confessed his love for Kaori and asked to meet her one last time before he moved away. Words of the confession reached out to the school, ostracizing Kaori due to Kujo's popularity among the female students. They, including Mayu, sabotaged the meeting by throwing insults at Kaori, who fled in shame and was hit by a car. Following this revelation, Kaori fully remembers Kujo. Realizing that he could never compete with someone she remembers permanently, Yuki decides to stop befriending Kaori and tearfully burns the shared journal. Despite this, he politely rejects Saki's love confession several months later, declaring that he only have eyes for Kaori. The next two spring seasons, Yuki and Kaori graduate. Kaori is called to the library to return a book, which turns out to be the French dictionary Yuki had borrowed a year ago using her member card. She learns that Yuki has illustrated the content of their shared journal into flip book drawings inside the dictionary. Finally remembering him, she rushes to meet him and asks to be her friend, an offer he accepts.

She has held several positions in the Senior Congolese Judiciary.  Biography  Agathe Pembellot, from Republic of Congo, was born on 21 May 1942 in Pointe-Noire, capital of Moyen-Congo, by then. She is the second youngest of nine children, founded by Anaclet Pembellot (1908, Tandou Mboulou - 2003, Pointe-Noire), attendant to the national telephone company; member of the clan Princely House of the Boulolo of Vista. (Loango) and by Anna Bouiti (1920, Brazzaville - 2004, Pointe-Noire), farmer of clan Tchiali and eldest daughter of six children Bouiti.

The Boulolos and Tchialis, are part of the twenty-seven primordial clans of the former Kingdom of Loango. Nowadays, one of the very populous neighborhoods of the district n¬∞4 Loandjili of Pointe-Noire, the economic capital of Republic of Congo, still bears the name of Tchiali, because they were former landowners.

March 11, 1973, the grounds of the Palace of Justice in Brazzaville were home to a ceremony that brought her to the elite of the judiciary. As a matter of fact, Agathe Pembellot, 30 years old, had sworn to become the first female Congolese judge. This event will generate vocations and will be the prelude to a long line of women in law in Congo. This includes for example : Pauline Yoba born Djembo, Jocelyne Milandou (Vice-President of the Court of Auditors and budgetary discipline), Henriette Diatoulou, Ma√Ætre Danielle Babin (lawyer at the Court of Appeal of Paris and former member of Council of the College of lawyers of Brazzaville in Congo), Nadia Josiane Laure Macosso, Sylvie Tchignoumba, Virginie N'dessabeka, Bertille Djembo Pemba, Caddy Elisabeth Ndala, Arlette Malonga, Marie Miboula Ngats√©k√© et Doroth√©e Mana.

Jaffe has successfully defended hundreds of individuals accused of murder, including more than sixty cases where the defendant faced the death penalty.https://www.thenationaltriallawyers.org/profile- view/Richard/Jaffe/13715/ He tried twenty-two of those cases to conclusion to a jury. In Alabama, six people have been exonerated from death row.https://deathpenaltyinfo.org/innocence-list-those-freed-death-row Jaffe served as lead lawyer in four of them: James Willie ‚ÄúBo‚Äù Cochran, Randal Padgett, Gary Drinkard and Wesley Quick (on appeal).https://law.justia.com/cases/alabama/court-of-appeals- criminal/2007/060428.html; https://caselaw.findlaw.com/al-court-of-criminal- appeals/1095073.html None of Jaffe‚Äôs clients are on death row nor have been executed. In addition, Jaffe served as lead counsel, at the behest of the ACLU, in the case of State of Alabama versus Montez Spradley, who was also on death row.https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-watch/wp/2015/09/21/the- outrageous-conviction-of-montez-spradley/ Jaffe‚Äôs efforts led to Spradley being released from Alabama‚Äôs death row.https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-watch/wp/2015/09/21/the- outrageous-conviction-of-montez-spradley/  Legal practice  Jaffe is the Senior Partner of the Birmingham, Alabama law firm of Jaffe, Hanle, Whisonant & Knight, P.C. The firm concentrates in criminal defense, with Jaffe concentrating in the areas of white collar criminal defense and criminal litigation in the federal and state courts.https://www.thenationaltriallawyers.org/profile- view/Richard/Jaffe/13715/  Notable cases  = Eric Robert Rudolph = Also known as the Olympic Park Bomber, Rudolph was charged with the Centennial Olympic Park bombing during the 1996 Summer Olympics as well as the bombings of an abortion clinic in Sandy Springs, Georgia (January 1997); a lesbian bar in Atlanta (February 1997); and an abortion clinic Birmingham, Alabama (January 1998). Jaffe represented Rudolph following his arrest in 2003, but withdrew from the case after 14 months. = James Willie (Bo) Cochran = Cochran was convicted of murdering Stephen Ganey in Jefferson County, Alabama. In his fourth trial, Jaffe successfully argued that Cochran, who was arrested hiding in the bushes hundreds of yards from where the fatal shot was fired, could not have shot the store manager with a gun that was defective, and could not have moved the victim's body and hidden it under a trailer. Cochran was acquitted of the murder and released from prison after serving 19 years on death row. = Gary Drinkard = Police arrested Drinkard in 1993 for the murder of Dalton Pace. Two years later he was convicted and sentenced to death row. Drinkard‚Äôs conviction rested mostly on the testimony of his half-sister, Beverly Robinson, and her common law husband, Rex Segar. In 2001 the Alabama Supreme Court reversed the conviction and death sentence and ordered a new trial because prosecutors had improperly introduced evidence of his involvement in unrelated property crimes. Jaffe represented Drinkard in his second trial, which resulted in his acquittal and release in 2001. = Randal Padgett = In 1990 Padgett was convicted of murdering his estranged wife by stabbing her forty-six times then raping her corpse. The jury recommended life in prison without parole, but then-Marshall County Circuit Judge William Jetton overruled the jury and sentenced Padgett to death. He spent three years on death row until the Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals granted Padgett a new trial. Jaffe represented Padgett in his second trial. Jaffe successfully argued that someone staged the rape and planted his DNA in her. After deliberating for three days, the jury found Padgett not guilty. = Regina Gratton = Gratton was accused of murdering her live-in boyfriend, Warren King, in March 1994. King was a government witness in the racketeering and extortion trial of former Jefferson County District Judge Jack Montgomery. King‚Äôs body was found two weeks before he was to report to prison for his role in aiding Judge Montgomery‚Äôs extortion of two drug dealers. At the time of his murder, King was seeking to implicate additional players in the Montgomery case in exchange for a reduced sentence. Jaffe represented Gratton in two trials, both ending in a hung jury resulting in mis-trials. Gratton ultimately entered an Alford (best-interest) to manslaughter for probation after she agreed to serve eighteen months in prison. = Montez Spradley = In 2004, Montez Spradley was convicted of murdering Marlene Jason, a 58-year-old lunchroom cashier at Mountain Brook Middle School. Overruling a 10-2 vote of the jury, Alabama Judge Gloria Bahakel sentenced Spradley to death. In 2011, the Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals reversed Spradley‚Äôs conviction and death sentence, and ordered a new trial on related witness tampering charges. Jaffe joined Spradley‚Äôs defense team and became his lead attorney following the Court of Criminal Appeals decision. Spradley entered an Alford (best interest) plea in 2013 and was released from prison in 2015. = Ollis Madden = Ollis Madden, a 16-year-old, was charged with murder in Gadsden, Alabama. His case reached the United States Supreme Court. Following that, Jaffe was able to demonstrate that Madden's fifth and six amendment rights were violated due to improper interrogation techniques conducted by police detectives. Ultimately, his murder case was dismissed. = Demetrius Watson = Demetrius Watson, a former marine, was indicted in 2013 for the shooting death of Lisa Langston. In a decision that was ultimately held up by the Alabama Supreme Court, the case was dismissed after Jaffe successfully argued that Watson was immune from prosecution under Alabama's stand your ground law. This was the first successful use of this defense in Alabama. = Shannon Mitchell = Along with Larry Whitehead, Matthew Hyde and James Stephen Brookshire, Shannon Mitchell an attorney in Marshall County, Alabama was charged with conspiring to murder an Albertville police officer in 1995. Two of the four defendants received the death penalty. Jaffe represented Mitchell who was found not guilty. = Cheryl Braswell Gutherie = In 2008, Cheryl Braswell Gutherie, a Huntsville, Alabama attorney and former candidate for the United States House of Representative, was accused of securities fraud by deceiving her client, Mariko Redcross. The case was dismissed at the preliminary hearing. = Oliver Robinson = In September 2017, Oliver Robinson, a former Alabama-State legislator, pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy, four counts of fraud, one count of bribery and one count of tax evasion. He cooperated with the U.S. Attorney's office and testified during the bribery trial of former Drummond Vice President of Government Affairs David Roberson and former Balch attorney Joel Gilbert this summer.

It is one way that events are handled in the browser. Events are actions done by the user such as a button click, changing a field etc. Event Handlers are used to execute code when a particular kind of user interface event occurs, such as when a button has been clicked or when a webpage has completed loading. Overview Consider the DOM structure where there are 3 elements nested in the following order: Element 1 (Div), Element 2 (Span), Element 3 (Button) whose on-click handlers are handler1(), handler2() and handler3() respectively. 336x336px When the Element3 button is clicked, an event handler for Element 3 is triggered first, then event bubbles up and the handler for immediate parent element - Element 2 is called, followed by the handler for Element 1 and so on till it reaches the outermost DOM element. Event handling order: handler3() - > handler2() -> handler1() The innermost element from where the event is triggered is called the target element.https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/event_target.asp Most of the browsers consider event bubbling as the default way of event propagation. However, there is another approach for event propagation known as Event Capturing, which is the direct opposite of event bubbling, where event handling starts from the outermost element (or Document) of the DOM structure and goes all the way to the target element, executing the target element handler last in order. Implementation All the event handlers consider event bubbling as the default way of event handling. But a user can manually select the way of propagation by specifying that as the last parameter in addEventListener() of any element in JavaScript. addEventListener(\\"type\\", \\"Listener\\", \\"CaptureMode\\") If the CaptureMode is False, the event will be handled using event bubbling. If the CaptureMode is True, the event will be handled using event capturing. If a user doesn‚Äôt specify any value of CaptureMode argument, then it is by default considered as event bubbling. Most of the browser support both event bubbling and event capturing (Except IE <9 and Opera<7.0 which do not support event capturing). JavaScript also provides an event property called bubbles to check whether the event is bubbling event or not. It returns a Boolean value True or False depending on whether the event can bubble up to the parent elements in DOM structure or not. var isBubblePossible = event.bubbles; isBubblePossible : True, if event can bubble up to the ancestors isBubblePossible : False, if event cannot bubble up  Use of Event Bubbling  To handle cases where one event has more than one handler, event bubbling concept can be implemented. The major use of event bubbling is the registration of default functions present in the program. In recent times, not many developers use event capturing or bubbling in particular. It is not necessary to implement event bubbling; it may become complicated for the users to keep track of the actions getting executed because of an event. Preventing event bubbling It is sometimes useful to stop a single trigger on one element lead to multiple triggers on ancestors. JavaScript provides the following methods to prevent event bubbling: 1) stopPropagation(): This method stops the further propagation of any particular event to its parents, invoking only the event handler of the target element. Although supported by all W3C compliant browsers, Internet Explorer below version 9 requires the historical alias cancelBubble, as in: event.cancelBubble = true; For all W3C compliant browsers: event.stopPropagation(); 2) stopImmediatePropagation(): This method will not only stop the further propagation but also stops any other handler of the target event from executing. In the DOM, the same event can have multiple independent handlers, so stopping the execution of one event handler generally doesn‚Äôt affect the other handlers of the same target. But stopImmediatePropagation() method prevents the execution of any other handler of the same target. For all W3C compliant browsers: event.stopImmediatePropagation(); Another approach to stop event bubbling is to cancel the event itself, however this prevents the target handler execution as well.

She was a major contributor to the development of nursing as an acceptable profession for women and also campaigned for women's rights, especially voting rights. Early life and family Born in Altona, Denmark, on 12 October 1855, Norrie was the daughter of Major-General Johannes Wilhelm Anthonius Harbou and his philanthropist wife Louise Ulrikke Mariane n√©e Hellesen. After spending her early years in Altona and Rendsburg, she moved to Copenhagen in 1863. She first spent three years working as a governess at Juulskov Manor on the island of Funen but in 1880 became a nursing apprentice at Copenhagen's Almindelig Hospital (General Hospital). The following year, she gained further experience in nursing at Dronning Louises B√∏rnehospital (Queen Louise's Children's Hospital). In 1885, she embarked on a successful marriage with Gordon Norrie, a doctor she had met at the General Hospital. They had three children together: Johannes William (1886), Edith (1889) and Inger (1892). Support for nursing With her husband's support, in 1883 she ran nursing courses in basic skills and first-aid treatment. Together they trained over 500 women, many of whom came from her mother's philanthropic interests. Norrie became an outspoken critic of the poor standards of hospital training for nurses, specifically criticizing the substandard approach of the Danish Red Cross. As early as 1888, she announced her plans for establishing a private school of nursing in Ugeskrift for L√¶ger (Doctors' Weekly) where she proposed extending nursing as a worthy profession for middle-class women. It was not, however, until 1910 that Denmark's first training facility for nurses opened in the re- established Rigshospitalet, a hospital run by the Danish state. Women's rights Norrie also developed wider interests in women's welfare, joining the Foreningen Kvindernes Bygning (Women's Building Association). In the late 1890s, she became a committee member of the Copenhagen branch of the women's rights organization Dansk Kvindesamfund where she served as deputy chair from 1900 to 1901. In 1899, together with Elly Nienst√¶dt, she founded Dansk Kvinder√•d (The Danish Council of Women) soon to be known as Danske Kvinders Nationalr√•d (DKN) where she served first as secretary and then as president until 1909. Through Danske Kvindeforeningers Valretsudvalg (Suffrage Committee of Danish Women's Associations), which she founded in 1898, she fought for voting rights not only for self-supporting women but also for dependent wives. At the 1899 congress of the International Council of Women in London, Norrie became a co-founder of the International Council of Nurses (ICN). Despite her efforts to establish a Danish organization for improving working and training conditions for nurses, she was only able to head the Dansk Sygeplejer√•d (Danish Council of Nurses) for a few months, facing increasing opposition from hospital nurses who called for a fully qualified nurse to become their leader. As a result, she turned her interests to women's suffrage, helping to found the International Woman Suffrage Alliance in 1904 in Berlin. In 1907, she became a dynamic co-founder and member of Danske Kvinders Forsvarsforening (Danish Women's Defence Association) which she chaired until 1915, raising membership to some 50,000. She then founded the non-party Kvinde-V√¶lger- Klubberne (Women Voters' Clubs) designed to encourage women to stand for election. Finally, from 1920 to 1927 she returned to her nursing ambitions, founding the Ejra School for nursing and first-aid treatment.

The scale and proportions of the 150-seat Olivier Music Barn are inspired by the Esterhazy Music Room, the performance space for which Franz Joseph Haydn composed his chamber music repertoire. A contemporary innovation‚Äîa high ceiling suspended above the boxlike space‚Äîis said to lend an elevated, ethereal character to the resonant acoustics, but is designed to mimic the pitched roof of a traditional wood barn. The building also houses Tippet Rise's visitor center, which includes a state-of-the-art recording room with 3D sound this summer and 4K high definition film projection capabilities. In January, 2019, Tippet Rise received LEED Gold certification from the U.S. Green Building Council for the Olivier Music Barn's environmentally sustainable design and systems, including low-carbon emissions and near-net-zero energy consumption. All buildings on the art center's main campus are heated and cooled with a geothermal energy system; 8,000 square-feet of solar panels provide light and power to buildings and vehicles. Water consumption is minimized by collecting and reusing rain and snowmelt for irrigation.. The Domo Cast from the land at Tippet Rise and designed by the Spanish architectural firm, Ensamble Studio, founded in 2000 by Ant√≥n Garc√≠a-Abril and D√©bora Mesa, the Domo is considered equal parts, land art, sculpture, and performance space.

The brothers were Augustus ‚ÄòGus‚Äô Cortesi, Enrico ‚ÄòFrenchie‚Äô Cortesi, Paolo ‚ÄòPaul‚Äô Cortesi and George Cortesi. Originating in Italy, the Cortesi family moved to Paris, France, where all four brothers were born. Their mother, Angele Cortesi, brought the family to England between 1891 and 1901, In 1901, the family is listed at Little Saffron Hill, Clerkenwell. Gus and George Cortesi had criminal records for assault in the 1910s. As the Cortesi brothers reached adulthood, they became involve in protection racketeering of gamblers and bookmakers. They were close to criminals in the Italian Sabini family. However, the two families became rivals because the Cortesi brothers believed they were being denied a fair share of proceeds from West End of London gambling clubs and wrung from bookmakers. The Cortesi Brothers allied themselves with Freddie Gilbert's Finsbury Boys and the premier Jewish gang led by Alfie Solomon. In 1922, the rivalry culminated in a confrontation at the Fratellanza Social Club at 23 Great Bath Street, Clerkenwell. It started when Harry Sabini pointed a revolver at them at the Cortesi brothers after learning about their alliance with the Finsbury gang. On 20 November 1922, Darby and Harry Sabini arrived at the club, probably to talk peace. Three women occupied one table and the only others present were the four Cortesi brothers and Alex Tomaso. Words were exchanged and tempers boiled over ‚Äì Paul Cortesi threw a cup of hot coffee in the face of Harry Sabini and they started to fight. On this occasion it was the Cortesis who were armed with revolvers. Gus tried to shoot Darby Sabini, but his hand was knocked aside by one of the three women, Louisa Doralli, daughter of the secretary of the club. The shot went through a window. Darby Sabini was knocked down when Tomaso hit him with a bottle. Louisa then jumped in front of Harry Sabini as Enrico Cortesi went to shoot him. Harry pushed her away, allowing his brother to shoot Harry Sabini in the stomach. When police officers later attempted to arrest the Cortesi brothers at their homes, a large thwarted them. However, the Cortese brothers later surrendered. Gus and Enrico (Frenchie) Cortesi were jailed for three years for attempted murder. George and Paul Cortesi and Tomaso were found not guilty of assault and discharged. Augustus Cortesi (1886‚Äì1949) is buried in St Mary's Catholic Cemetery, Kensal Green.

Environment Temperatures range from with an average of . Average annual rainfall is . The vegetation is mainly savanna- rainforest contact and pioneer fluvial forest. The reserve has rich fauna, with birds like great egret (Ardea alba), jabiru (Jabiru mycteria), maguari stork (Ciconia maguari) and Neotropic cormorant (Phalacrocorax brasilianus) and large animals such as black caiman (Melanosuchus niger) and porpoise. As of 2001 the reserve was home to 50 families with about 400 people whose main economic activity was fishing for food and for sale. Almost all preserve traditional artisan techniques, including the skill learned from the Indians of making canoes. History The Lago do Cuni√£ Extractive Reserve was created by federal decree 3.238 of 10 November 1999, which was reworded on 9 May 2000. It is classed as IUCN protected area category VI (protected area with sustainable use of natural resources). Its basic objectives are to protect the livelihoods and culture of the traditional population and ensure the sustainable use of the natural resources. It is administered by the Chico Mendes Institute for Biodiversity Conservation (ICMBio). On 22 February 2002 lower limits were placed on fishing related to minimum size and period of fishing. The deliberative council was created on 20 June 2006.

In the Rutherford model for the nucleus, red spheres were protons with positive charge and blue spheres were protons tightly bound to an electron with no net charge. The inset shows beta decay of a free neutron as it is understood today; an electron and antineutrino are created in this process. Outside the nucleus, free neutrons are unstable and have a mean lifetime of (about 14 minutes, 39.6 seconds).2020 Review of Particle Physics. Neutron mean life Therefore, the half-life for this process (which differs from the mean lifetime by a factor of ) is (about 10 minutes, 11 seconds).J. Beringer et al. (Particle Data Group), Phys. Rev. D86, 010001 (2012) http://pdg.lbl.gov/2012/tables/rpp2012-sum-baryons.pdf The beta decay of the neutron, described above, can be denoted as follows:Particle Data Group Summary Data Table on Baryons. lbl.gov (2007). Retrieved on 2012-08-16. : ‚Üí + + This decay, like any flavor-changing process, occurs through operation of the weak force. It involves the emission of a boson from one of the down quarks within the neutron, thereby converting the down quark into an up quark and the neutron into a proton; the then decays into the electron and the antineutrino. The following equations denote the same process as the first equation above, but also include the short-lived and describe the process on both the nucleon and the quark level: : ‚Üí + ‚Üí + + : ‚Üí + ‚Üí + + For the free neutron, the decay energy for this process (based on the rest masses of the neutron, proton and electron) is 0.782343 MeV. That is the difference between the rest mass of the neutron and the sum of the rest masses of the products. That difference has to be carried away as kinetic energy. The maximal energy of the beta decay electron (in the process wherein the neutrino receives a vanishingly small amount of kinetic energy) has been measured at 0.782 ¬± .013 MeV.Basic Ideas and Concepts in Nuclear Physics: An Introductory Approach, Third Edition K. Heyde Taylor & Francis 2004. Print . eBook . DOI: 10.1201/9781420054941.ch5 (full text). The latter number is not well-enough measured to determine the comparatively tiny rest mass of the neutrino (which must in theory be subtracted from the maximal electron kinetic energy); furthermore, neutrino mass is constrained by many other methods. A small fraction (about one in 1000) of free neutrons decay with the same products, but add an extra particle in the form of an emitted gamma ray: : ‚Üí + + + This gamma ray may be thought of as a sort of \\"internal bremsstrahlung\\" that arises as the emitted beta particle (electron) interacts with the charge of the proton in an electromagnetic way. In this process, some of the decay energy is carried away as photon energy. Internal bremsstrahlung gamma ray production is also a minor feature of beta decays of bound neutrons, that is, those within a nucleus. A very small minority of neutron decays (about four per million) are so-called \\"two-body (neutron) decays\\", in which a proton, electron and antineutrino are produced as usual, but the electron fails to gain the 13.6 eV necessary energy to escape the proton (the ionization energy of hydrogen), and therefore simply remains bound to it, as a neutral hydrogen atom (one of the \\"two bodies\\"). In this type of free neutron decay, in essence all of the neutron decay energy is carried off by the antineutrino (the other \\"body\\"). The transformation of a free proton to a neutron (plus a positron and a neutrino) is energetically impossible, since a free neutron has a greater mass than a free proton. However, see proton decay. Neutron lifetime puzzle While the neutron lifetime has been studied for decades, there currently exists a lack of consilience on its exact value, due to different results from two experimental methods (\\"bottle\\" versus \\"beam\\"). While the error margin was once overlapping, increasing refinement in technique which should have resolved the issue has failed to demonstrate convergence to a single value. The difference in mean lifetime values obtained as of 2014 was approximately 9 seconds. Further, a prediction of the value based on quantum chromodynamics as of 2018 is still not sufficiently precise to support one over the other. As discussed in , the beam test would be incorrect if there is a decay mode that does not produce a proton.

Kennedy's remarks at the University of Kansas were given on March 18, 1968. He spoke about student protests, the Vietnam War, and the gross national product. At the time, Kennedy's words on the latter subject went relatively unnoticed, but they have since become famous. Background Kennedy had given his first campaign speech earlier that morning at Kansas State University before flying into Lawrence Municipal Airport to give his speech at the University of Kansas. Classes were cancelled in advance of Kennedy's appearance. The speech The speech was delivered at 1:30 PM in Phog Allen Fieldhouse before 20,000 people. The arena itself was over capacity; the school had only 16,000 enrolled students, and many sat on the basketball court, leaving only a minimal amount of open space around the lectern in the center. Shortly before the speech, Kennedy warned the student union, \\"Some of you may not like what you're going to hear in a few minutes, but it's what I believe; and if I'm elected president, it's what I'm going to do...\\" =Summary= Most of Kennedy's speech was given extemporaneously, with phrases from older speeches linking together sections from his remarks at KSU. He began on the subject of the Vietnam War, calling for an end to the bombing campaign and negotiations with the Viet Cong. On the matter of student protests, he quoted William Allen White (a university alum), as he had in his earlier speech: These words surprised many members of the audience. He continued onto the matter of poverty, expressing his own feeling of horror at the conditions poor Americans faced: He continued, borrowing imagery from Michael Harrington's book, The Other America: Kennedy notably outlined why he thought the gross national product was an insufficient measure of success. He emphasized the negative values it accounted for and the positive ones it ignored: Towards the end of his speech, he quoted George Bernard Shaw: These words would become a centerpiece of Kennedy's presidential campaign, and he would repeat them on several occasions. Kennedy was interrupted 38 times during his speech for applause. Aftermath It took Kennedy 15 minutes to make it out of the arena to his car. He later departed on a flight for Washington, D.C.. Campaign staffer Jim Tolan would later say of the students' reception, \\"It was the first time I was ever scared with [Kennedy]. Those kids were out of control. He could have gotten hurt they liked him so much.\\" =Legacy= At the time, Kennedy's criticism of the gross national product didn't receive much attention, though it has since become famous, receiving significant coverage in the writings of economic critics. His words are credited as the beginning of the Beyond GDP movement.

Early life John Mackay, 11th of Strathnaver, was the eldest son of Iye Roy Mackay, 10th of Strathnaver, and his wife who was the daughter of Norman, son of Patrick O‚ÄôBeolan of Carloway, Lewis. His parent's marriage did not conform with canon law, but his father, Iye Roy Mackay, managed to secure a precept of legitimation from James IV of Scotland for his two sons, John and Donald Mackay. The Earldom of Sutherland On 3 October 1514 at Inverness, Elizabeth de Moravia (Elizabeth Sutherland), spouse of Adam Gordon who was in turn the brother of the Gordon Earl of Huntly, was served heir to her brother, John de Moravia, 9th Earl of Sutherland (John Sutherland). Historian Angus Mackay states that the rightful heir was in fact Elizabeth's half-brother, Alexander Sutherland. Alexander Sutherland claimed the Earldom of Sutherland for himself, but was ‚Äùassassinated‚Äù by Gordon emissaries in 1519 and this is how the earldom of Sutherland passed from the line of Sutherland to that of the Gordons. One of John Mackay, 11th of Strathnaver's sisters was married to Alexander Sutherland. According to 17th-century historian Sir Robert Gordon, 1st Baronet who himself was a son of Alexander Gordon, 12th Earl of Sutherland, both John Mackay of Strathnaver and Alexander Sutherland were bastards, but this is rejected by historian Angus Mackay. Historian Angus Mackay again rejects the history written by Sir Robert Gordon, son of the Earl of Sutherland, who says that between 1517 and 1522 John Mackay of Strathnaver led six warlike expeditions of his clansmen into Sutherland in which the Mackays were defeated in every one of them. According to Sir Robert Gordon, one of these battles was the Battle of Torran Dubh, in which Elizabeth, Countess of Sutherland had persuaded her half brother, Alexander Sutherland, to resist John Mackay, whose sister Alexander Sutherland later married. However, both historians Angus Mackay and Sir William Fraser show that it can be proved that Alexander Sutherland was in prison in 1517 when the Battle of Torran Dubh is supposed to have taken place.Mackay, Angus. (1906). The Book of Mackay. p. 82. Quoting: Fraser, Sir William, The Sutherland Book. Angus Mackay says that the Battle of Torran Dubh was actually fought by the Clan Mackay against the Murrays, Clan Ross and Clan Gunn, and not against the family of Sutherland.Mackay, Angus. (1906). The Book of Mackay. pp. 82 ‚Äì 83. Quoting: the MS Account of the Gunns. According to historian Angus Mackay a few months after the battle another skirmish took place upon the borders of Ross in the parish of Rogart in which on one side William Mackay, chieftain of the Mackay of Aberach branch of clan was killed as was his brother Donald, and on the other side was killed John Murray of Aberscross. Shortly after this the Mackays burned the town of Pitfure in Strathfleet, Rogart. However, this was immediately followed by a bond of friendship between the Mackays and Adam Gordon, Earl of Sutherland dated 16 August 1518, in which Mackay renewed the bond that his father had made with the Gordon Earl of Sutherland before him. Angus Mackay states that historian Sir Robert Gordon incorrectly refers to these skirmishes as \\"defeats\\" for the Mackays, and that Gordon also fails to mention that the Mackays rounded the year off by securing a title to the lands in the said parish of Rogart as confirmed by the Reay Papers. Angus Mackay also disputes Sir Robert Gordon's account that in 1522 Sir Alexander Gordon, Master of Sutherland overthrew John Mackay of Strathnaver at Lairg and that Mackay then submitted himself to Gordon, the Earl of Sutherland. Angus Mackay explains that Earl Adam, resigning the earldom into his son Alexander's hands was simply renewing the bond of friendship that he had made with Mackay in 1518 this time with his son Alexander. The Bishop of Caithness In 1529, while visiting Inverness, the Sutherland of Duffus was murdered by a servant of Andrew Stuart, Bishop of Caithness at the instigation of the bishop. The Gordon Earls of Huntly and Sutherland took the side of the bishop, saving him from the gallows, while John Mackay of Strathnaver took the side of Sutherland of Duffus. Mackay marched with a body of men towards the bishop's Skibo Castle, but he became sick during the expedition and was carried home to die almost immediately. Family John Mackay, 11th of Strathnaver, married Margaret, daughter of Thomas Fraser, 2nd Lord Lovat, who succeeded as chief of the Clan Fraser of Lovat in 1501. John Mackay and Margaret Fraser had the following children: #A daughter, who married Hugh Murray of Aberscross, and to whom she had a son called Hugh who was heir to his father Hugh Moray (Murray), and also grandson and one of the heirs of John Mackay of Strathnaver, as confirmed in a charter recorded by William Sutherland of Duffus dated 21 February 1581. #A daughter, who married the Laird of Polrossie. John Mackay, 11th of Strathnaver, was succeeded by his brother, Donald Mackay, 11th of Strathnaver.

Biography  Meyer was born Altona in Hamburg, Germany. He was of Jewish ancestry. His father, Salomon Abraham Meyer, operated a brokerage firm. When he was year old, his parents divorced and his mother went to Copenhagen, where she remarried; this time to a grocer. In 1812, when it became clear that he was interested in art rather than business, his father refused to continue supporting him and sent him to join his mother's new family. There a business associate of his cousin, the wholesale grocer and economic writer Mendel Levin Nathanson (1780-1868), took him under his wing, helped him audit classes at the Royal Academy and found him a position in the workshop of artist C.A. Lorentzen (1749‚Äì1828). From 1816 to 1818, he attended the Academy's \\"Modelskole\\" and was awarded two silver medals. Jens Peter Munk. Ernst Meyer Kunstindeks Danmark & Weilbach Kunstnerleksikon. His first exhibition consisted entirely of copies of old works. His first original works show the influence of C.W. Eckersberg, who was a Professor at the Academy, although he never took any classes from him. His goal, however, was to be a history painter and, in 1819, he competed for a gold medal with a work depicting Joseph and Pharaoh. He failed to win and, at the urging of friends, took time off to travel. He returned in 1821, competed and lost again, removed all of his works from the Academy's gallery and gave up history painting. Landing on Capri He then went to Munich, where he came under the influence of Peter von Cornelius (1784‚Äì1867) and became so involved in mastering his Catholic-oriented style that he decided not to return to Denmark. None of his paintings from this period were exhibited there. Then in 1824, sculptor Herman Wilhelm Bissen (1798‚Äì1868), convinced Meyer to accompany him to Rome. It was the colorful street life there that first inspired him to paint genre scenes. As more artists from Copenhagen began coming to Rome, he was reconciled with the past and, in 1827, started exhibiting in Denmark again. In 1833, his portrait of a Neapolitan fishing family was purchased by Crown Prince (later King) Christian. His painting of sailors carrying their passengers ashore on Capri has been reproduced numerous times. In 1841, he began to suffer from serious episodes of what was probably rheumatoid arthritis (although some sources suggest it may have been syphilis) and he made an extended visit to the spa at Gr√§fenberg, Bavaria, in an effort to restore his health. Afterward, he visited Denmark for a year and was elected a member of the Academy. He returned to Italy, but was forced to leave by the Revolutions of 1848. He spent the next four years in Germany, France and Switzerland; spending time at several spas, to no avail. By this time, his affliction had worsened to the point that he had to walk with crutches and his hands were too deformed to paint in oils. Rather than give up, he taught himself to paint with watercolors and was soon using subtle hues that had been missing from his earlier work. Despite his weakness, he travelled often and seemed content until he suffered a stroke during his morning walk in Rome during 1861. He was carried home unconscious and lingered for a day while his neighbors kept vigil (he never married and had no children). A torchlight procession led his remains to rest in the Jewish section at Campo Verano.

It is the administrative centre of Novoarkhanhelsk Raion. As of 2020, its population was  Location & demographics  First language of the population of Novoarhanhelsk according to the 2001 Ukrainian census Novoarkhanhelsk is located on the left bank of the Synyukha river, 120 km from the oblast capital of Kropyvnytskyi and 40 km from Talne (in Cherkassy Oblast). It is connected to Highway M12 (part of European route E50). The town's population was estimated at 6,095 in 2020. According to the 2001 Ukrainian census, 98% of the inhabitants spoke Ukrainian as a first language and 2% Russian.  History  = Archaeological finds = A prehistoric camp dating to the Upper Palaeolithic (40,000‚Äì13,000 Before Present) was discovered near Novoarkhanhelsk. Traces of a historic settlement dating to the 14th‚Äì15th century have also been found, including a large amount of iron tools and fragments related to blacksmithing. = Russian Empire = The Treaty of the Pruth (1711) defined the border between Zaporizhia and the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth as following the rivers Synyukha, Velyka Vys and Tyasmyn. The area now occupied by Novoarkhanhelsk was therefore situated on the southwestern frontier of the Tsardom of Russia. Following the Austro- Russian‚ÄìTurkish War (1735‚Äì39), the Russian government began to restore settlements destroyed by Tatar raids along the Polish border. The Governor of Kyiv ordered Colonel Kapnist of the Myrhorod Regiment to fortify the left bank of the Synyukha, opposite the Polish town of , against Polish raids. The regiment constructed a pentagonal fortification with earthen ramparts inside a bend of the river, adding bastions to each corner. The new settlement, named Arkhanhelohorod (, lit. \\"Archangel Town\\"), was initially garrisoned by cossacks and runaway peasants. In 1742, Kapnist, with the consent of , the count of , dispatched –∞ cossack known as David of Zvenigorod to Podolia to bring back twenty Ukrainian families to settle the town. In the 18th century, the Ukrainian anti-feudal movement found support in the region. In a complaint received by the Governor of Kyiv in 1747, a Polish nobleman accused an officer at Arkhanhelohorod by the name of J. Chechel of harbouring haidamaka (\\"thieves and brigands\\"). In 1748, another complained that residents of Arkhanhelohorod were amongst those who attacked the house of a szlachta near Vinnytsia. New Serbia (1752‚Äì1764) In 1752, Arkhanhelohorod became part of New Serbia, when the Russian authorities invited Serbians from the Austro-Hungarian Empire to settle the frontier region. The garrison alternated between the 7th Company of the New Serbian Hussar regiment (1752‚Äì1754 and 1759‚Äì1761) and the Novoslobodskaya Cossack Regiment (1754‚Äì1759, 1761‚Äì1764). In March 1764, it became the headquarters of seven companies of the newly formed Black Hussars. At this point the settlement, now known as Novoarkhanhelsk, was home to civilians engaged in farming, beekeeping, fishing, trading and craftsmanship, in addition to the military garrison. Its inhabitants included Old Believer and Jewish immigrants from Poland and Moldova. In 1774, Johann Anton G√ºldenst√§dt undertook a documentary expedition to Ukraine on behalf of the Russian government. He described Novoarkhanhelsk as a commercial centre. From 1765 the town hosted three annual fairs. In 1784 it became part of the county (powiat) of Novomyrhorod, then from 1807 part of Olviopol county, Kherson Oblast. By 1772, the fort had a church dedicated to the Archangel Michael. As a military settlement, Novoarkhanhelsk was the headquarters of the 2nd Ukrainian Lancers (from 1821,) and later the 6th District of Novorossiya. In 1876 it was reported to contain 60 households. By 1886, it was the centre of Novoarkhanhelsk parish, Yelisavetgrad county. It had a population of 2,512 and had 696 farm yards, an Orthodox church, a school, 19 shops and two taverns. Markets were held every second Sunday. = War of Independence, 1917‚Äì1920 = Novoarkhanhelsk was the scene of fighting during the Ukrainian War of Independence. In January 1918 the town came under the control of the Bolsheviks, but in early April it was occupied by Triple Alliance forces. In March 1919 it was recaptured by the Bolsheviks, and then in September by the White Army. Pogroms against the town's Jewish inhabitants took place.http://na.cen.library.kr.ua/articles.php?lng=ua&pg;=138 In Spring 1920 it was again recaptured by the Red Army. = USSR = From 1921 Novoarkhanhelsk has been the administrative centre of Novoarkhanhelsk Raion, and in 1957 it was given the status of urban-type settlement (town). In 1927, a small power plant was built on the Synyukha. The town's first collective farm was established in 1929, and the first machine and tractor station was opened. In January 1932 the first issue of the district newspaper, –ü—ñ–¥ –ø—Ä–∞–ø–æ—Ä–æ–º –ø–µ—Ä–µ–º–æ–≥–∏ (\\"Under the flag of victory\\"), was published. Novoarkhanhelsk played an important role in the Battle of Uman as part of the Soviet forces' supply line. German troops of the Wehrmacht 16th Motorized Infantry Division occupied the town on 30 July 1941. The fighting was fierce, and the town repeatedly passed between the German (16th Motorized Infantry Division and 1st SS Panzer Division Leibstandarte SS Adolf Hitler) and Soviet forces (44th Rifle Division and 216th Motorized Division) over the course of several days. It ended on 2 August, when the bridge connecting Novoarkhanhelsk to Torhovytsya was destroyed. After the battle, Novoarkhanhelsk was occupied as part of the Reichskommissariat Ukraine and a prisoner of war camp was set up there. The occupation ended on 12 March 1944, when the 110th Guards Rifle Division of the 53rd Army, 2nd Ukrainian Front, under the command of Colonel D. P. Sobolev, recaptured Novoarkhanhelsk.

The Workers Educational Association also use the term to describe a similar, empowerment approach to adult education. Social Purpose Education as a pedagogy is concerned with social change via the growth in confidence, agency and self-belief of individuals. As such, it can be said to be in the tradition of transformational leadership, rather than the transformational learning of Jack Mezirow, as the desired impact is intended to be on communities, rather than remaining within the individual. This makes it a particularly effective pedagogy for workforce development programmes. Social Purpose Education combines pro-social pedagogies such as The Thinking Environment, Restorative Practice, Community Philosophy and Non-Violent Communication with open digital approaches, designed to build \\"communities of praxis\\". It comprises four cornerstones of praxis: Social Purpose Cornerstones 1\\\\. Teaching (to) Your Values Social Purpose Education is explicitly values- based. Participants are invited to regularly check in with their personal values and how these connect with practice principles. The language of values continues to be explicated throughout. Values work is the cornerstone of any transformational education programme, such as the Thinking Environment, Training for Transformation, and Freirean based education (see, for example, the Paulo Freire Institute and Highlander Center). 2\\\\. Reflexive Practice Reflexion is defined as a broader practice than the commonly understood practice reflection. Introspection is cut with making connections with theory and with the experience of other participants (students, colleagues), leading to an experience of praxis which avoids solipsism and connects with broader social, political and economic factors. In this way, it leans towards the 'Four Lenses' work of Stephen Brookfield. 3\\\\. Win/Win/Win Inspired by Nigel Cutts‚Äôs leadership handbook ‚ÄòLove at Work', which is in turn inspired by the Thinking Environment, Win/Win/Win refers to the impact of social purpose education on the teacher, the student and the wider communities of both. It is an element of what Hannah Arendt called vita activa, or the active life. 4\\\\. Embedding Diversity An assumption of social purpose education is that it has a responsibility to challenge the social, political and economic status quo, by using a posthuman approach to challenge axiomatic thinking.

The game is a localized version of a 2013 Japanese game called Kuma-Tomo. The game was released in Europe on July 1, 2016, and Australia and New Zealand on July 2. While the Japanese release was published by Bandai Namco Games, under the Namco label, the English language release was published by Nintendo. The game is based around the player taking care of a teddy bear. The game was praised for being a good game for younger audiences, although some Western critics found the bear's overly- cheery appearance to be off-putting. Gameplay The game involves the player interacting with a sentient teddy bear, with the end-goal being to forge a trusting friendship with the bear in order to discover the purpose behind his existence and his mysterious key. Gameplay involves elements of Miitomo, Nintendogs, Animal Crossing and Cooking Mama. The player uses the buttons, touch screen, and microphone to play mini-games that simulate various daily tasks such as cooking food or tending to a garden. Doing activities earn the player coins that can be used to purchase items or clothing for the teddy bear, and additional coins can be earned through the use of Nintendo-themed amiibo, the latter feature being exclusive the Western version of the game. The teddy bear also frequently asks the player questions about their self or their personal preferences, which is saved and mentioned back to the player in future parts of the game. The game has no online connectivity to the internet however, making the information given private to that particular copy of the video game. Development and release The game was first released under the title of Kuma-Tomo in Japan in June 2013. The game was announced for English localization almost three years after its initial release, in May 2016, an irregularly long time for games to be released between regions in the industry. The game was released in Europe on July 1, 2016, and Australia and New Zealand on July 2. While the 2013 Japanese release had been published by Bandai Namco, the English language release was published by Nintendo. The game's Western release was given a focused advertisement campaign, especially on children's television channels in the UK. Reception Nintendo Life gave the game a score of 7/10, praising the game wealth of content for children to play with their parents, concluding that \\"there is so much to be explored... A lot of kids' games can be rushed through, but the level of detail and effort put into Teddy Together makes it an solid choice for young gamers that enjoy the likes of Nintendogs and Tomodachi Life. Multiple journalists, including ones at NintendoLife, Eurogamer, and Kotaku criticized the bear's overly cute look and voice acting to be inadvertently creepy and off-putting. Kotaku described his appearance as if Paddington Bear had been a character in the horror film The Grudge. The game sold 12,705 copies at retail in its first week of sales in June 2013, making it the fifth best-selling video game in Japan for that week. Teddy Together has sold over 350,000 copies worldwide as of June 2018.

Early life Silas Niyibizi was born on April 1, 1942 in Muganza - Kayenzi (Gitarama, Southern Rwanda) in a modest family of rural farmers. After attending primary school in his home village, he went to Nyanza (Southern Rwanda) for secondary studies at the Coll√®ge Christ Roi Latin-Greek section (1957‚Äì1964). From 1964 to 1967 he studied at the National University of Rwanda in the department of Social and Economic Sciences (D√©partement des Sciences √âconomiques et Sociales). There he obtained a Degree in Economic and Social Sciences. From 1967 to 1969 he specialized in Demography at the Universit√© de Montr√©al (Canada) with a M.Sc. in Demographic Sciences, thus becoming the first ever Rwandan demographer. Career During his career (1969‚Äì1999), Niyibizi did extensive demographic research, primarily focusing on the social issues generated by the rapid growth of the Rwandan population. He returned to Rwanda after obtaining his demographic degree in 1969, where the Rwandan Ministry of Planning employed him to found the Statistics department (1969‚Äì1971). Niyibizi then transferred to the National University of Rwanda (NUR, Butare - Southern Province) as a full-time lecturer in Demographic and Statistics Studies (1971‚Äì1976), making him the first graduate of the NUR to be a lecturer there. From 1976 to 1977 Niyibizi served as Permanent Secretary in the Ministry of Sports, before being tasked to prepare and manage the First Rwandan Census of Population and Housing (1978) and coordinate its after-results analysis (1978 to 1987). In 1980 he co- founded the Office National de la Population ‚Äì ONAPO (National Office of the Population), where he served as Senior Demographer from 1987‚Äì1994, with a short stint as Senior Advisor in the country‚Äôs second National Census of Population and Housing (1991). Contrary to many of his peers among the first Rwandan academicians, he seems to have not taken part in the tumultuous political period preceding the 1994 genocide (nor had he ever occupied a political position). This aberrant political anonymity could be explained by his socialist ideals, peaceful dialogue and opposition to military involvement in politics, a mixture that could not please the Military Regime that ruled Rwanda at the prime of his career. After the 1994 genocide, Niyibizi worked to rebuild the country's decimated academia. He remained a lecturer at NUR until he retired at the age of 57 in 1999. In his retirement he also contributed to the success of the third (and first post-genocide) National Census of Population and Housing (2002), as National Consultant. He also, during his retirement, taught Statistics and Social Planning at the Universit√© Catholique de Kabgayi (2001‚Äì2006).

Because of this, he is laughed at and told to go home by his peers. Saddened, he goes home, hangs his stocking and goes to bed. Meanwhile, at the North Pole, Santa Claus notices that the coming fog will be difficult to get through. Nevertheless, he and his reindeer brave out the storm and go anyway. While on the way, an airplane throws them off course; they land at Rudolph's house, where Santa greets him. Telling Rudolph, \\"I need you tonight to lead all my deer on the rest of our flight\\", Rudolph helps them.

Born in Massachusetts, she spent most of her life in Texas where she led multiple organized reform efforts. She was Texas' first child welfare inspector and first chief of the women's division in the Texas Department of Labor.  Early life  Lala Fay was born December 23, 1881, along with a twin sister, in Northfield, Massachusetts. Her parents were Frank F. Fay and Carrie Fay (n√©e Ware). Her maternal grandmother was a Quaker. As a child, Fay and her twin sister marched in \\"Band of Hope\\" temperance parades. When Fay was a teenager, the family, which by then included a third daughter, moved from Massachusetts to San Antonio, Texas. She began calling herself Laura, which she felt was a more dignified name than Lala. Fay graduated from Sam Houston State Normal College and became a teacher. On August 18, 1902, Fay married Major Claude De Van Watts, a veteran of the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War. The couple had two children, one boy and one girl.  Activism  It was through being a mother that Watts became involved in activism. As a member of the Dallas Mothers Counsel, she asked the mayor of Dallas to put a woman on the welfare board. When he refused and suggested Watts go home and raise her family instead, she became an active suffragette. From 1917 to 1919 Watts served as President of the Dallas Council of Mothers, a group affiliated with the Texas Congress of Mothers. She also served as the first President of Dallas' Parent-Teacher Association. = Labor reform = Watts was appointed Texas' first child welfare inspector in 1918. During World War I, child labor laws were not being strictly enforced due to the wartime labor shortage. Watts was one of a group of Children's Year activists who demanded a child welfare inspector be appointed in the state's Bureau of Labor and Statistics to rectify the problem. Texas Governor William P. Hobby agreed to appoint Watts to the position. Following her appointment, Watts moved from Dallas to Austin, Texas. In 1919, Watts was named chief of the women's division of the Texas Department of Labor. To investigate conditions of factory workers first hand, Watts secured a job sewing overalls for a salary of $3. She joined the Garment workers union and worked in the factory until her boss discovered she was Mrs. Claude De Van Watts and fired her. Watts reported her findings back to the Texas Legislature and recommended a series of reforms for working women and children including a mother's pension, compulsory school attendance, increased sanitation, and rest periods. Her work led to the passage of 22 laws or amendments seeking to improve the working condition of women and children. In 1921, newly elected Governor Pat Morris Neff ended Watts' tenure in government. = Temperance = In the 1928 presidential election, Watts, then a leader of the Texas state Women's Christian Temperance Union (WCTU), was an ardent Herbert Hoover supporter. Republican Hoover was considered an acceptable \\"dry\\" candidate while the Democratic nominee Al Smith supported modifying prohibition laws. She spurred WCTU members to form Democratic Hoover clubs. She was elected state president of the WCTU in 1922, a position she would hold for 41 years. Governor W.

Life H√ºma≈üah was born in Manisa, where her father served as sanjakbey. She was his only child. Following his death in 1543, she was taken under the care of her grandmother and moved to Istanbul. Like her cousin Ay≈üe H√ºma≈üah Sultan, she was reportedly beloved by their grandfather, with whom she kept correspondence. H√ºma≈üah, her cousin, and her aunt Mihrimah Sultan would all imitate the communication style ushered in by her grandmother Hurrem, whose letters to the Sultan are known for their colourfulness, charm, and smoothness. She is regarded by historian Mustafa √áaƒüatay Ulu√ßay as amongst the most influential women of Suleiman's reign. It was she who, in 1563, gifted her cousin ≈ûehzade Murad (future Sultan Murad III) with a concubine that would go on to be Safiye Sultan. In 1566, H√ºma≈üah Sultan married Ferhad Pasha, when he was serving as the third vizier. He had previously been second Kapƒ±cƒ±ba≈üƒ±. In 1553, he became the Agha of the Janissaries. In 1557-8, he was made the governor of Kastamonu Sanjak, and in 1564, he was made the third vizier, before he married H√ºma≈üah. Their palace was located in the precincts of the Old Palace. She was widowed at his death on 6 February 1575. Six months after the death of Ferhad Pasha, H√ºma≈üah married Lala Kara Mustafa Pasha. She was widowed at his death on 7 August 1580. After his death, H√ºma≈üah married the governor of Shahrizor Eyalet, Mehmed Pasha, the brother of the grand vizier Damat Ibrahim Pasha. He died in August 1592. Burial Upon her death, she was buried alongside her father and uncle, ≈ûehzade Cihangir, in ≈ûehzade Mosque. Issue The princess' marriage to Ferhad Pasha produced four sons and two daughters, including: *Sultanzade Hasan Bey; *Sultanzade Mustafa Pasha; *Sultanzade Osman Bey; *Sultanzade Ibrahim Pasha; *Fatma Sultan; *Hatice Sultan; With Lala Kara Mustafa Pasha, she had one son: *Sultanzade Abd√ºlbaki Bey; Annotations References Sources   Ottoman dynasty 1540s births 16th-century Ottoman royalty 16th-century women of the Ottoman Empire People from Manisa ","title":"H√ºma≈üah Sultan (daughter of ≈ûehzade Mehmed)"},{"id":"51504389","text":"Marzahn Historical map of Leopoldau, Vienna - an Angerdorf An Angerdorf (plural: Angerd√∂rfer) is a type of village that is characterised by the houses and farmsteads being laid out around a central grassed area, the anger (from the Old High German angar =pasture or grassy place), Deutsches W√∂rterbuch, von Friedrich L. Weigand, 1968 at books.google.at a village green which was common land, owned jointly by the village community. The anger is usually in the shape of a lens or an eye, but may also take other forms: a rectangle, triangle, circle or semi-circle (illustrated). The buildings are oriented with their eaves facing the road. Livestock stalls and barns are at the rear of the plot (in Austria called the Hintaus) and may be linked by a farm track that runs around the village forming an outer ring. There is often a village pond on the anger and sometimes a stream flows through it which may not be easy to recognise today where the groundwater level has changed. The waterbody may well be the reason the anger was chosen. Originally there were no buildings on the anger, but in the course of time other community facilities were often built on it, such as the village church, village school or a smithy. Angerd√∂rfer occur in Central Europe, especially on ground moraine plates and in loess-covered terrain. In Germany they are common in East Germany and east Central Germany. They were often established during the period of German Ostkolonisation in the Middle Ages and in many western Hungarian villages (for example in Burgenland's Loretto, formerly in Hungary, with the largest anger in Europe) the original layout has survived. In Austria this type of village occurs predominantly in the Waldviertel and Weinviertel provinces of Lower Austria, in the Vienna Basin, in Burgenland and in east and south Styria.Dorf im √ñsterreich-Lexikon There are also Angerd√∂rfer in Lorraine in the vicinity of the Franco-German language boundary (e. g.

Arzhanukhin () is a Russian philosopher. He is a professor at the Russian Presidential Academy of National Economy and Public Administration and holds a Doctor of Philosophical Sciences. Arzhanukhin is knowledgeable in philosophy and public and political theories of Russian masons.  Early life and education  Sergey V. Arzhanukhin was born September 1, 1957. In 1980 he graduated the Philosophy Faculty, the Ural Federal University and 1984 completed the post-graduate course at the Saint-Petersburg State University; the highest academic degree, Doctor of Philosophical Sciences, was successfully defended in 1996 at the Ural Federal University.  Work  His monograph ‚ÄúPhilosophical Views of the Russian Masons‚Äù, based on a thorough and comprehensive evaluation of archive printed works and manuscripts, was published in 1995. This essay became the first monograph published on the ‚Äúpost-soviet‚Äù territory after G.V. Vernadsky's dissertation ‚ÄúRussian Masons during Catherine II Queenship‚Äù (Petrograd, 1917). The monograph preserved and developed the tradition to provide a complex investigation of Russian Masons‚Äô views covering works by M.N. Longinov, A.N. Pypin, S.V. Eshevsky, P.P. Pekarsky, N.S. Tikhonravov, V.O. Kluchevsky, T.O. Sokolovskaya and others. The monograph became the academic novelty due to the fact that here one can find the bibliography classification concerning the history of philosophical and political views of Freemasons. There is a description of a historical environment which inspired the development of Masonry's values, the latter demonstrating that the Russian Freemasonry can be viewed as a national phenomenon in the history of the Russian philosophy. A whole range of theoretical sources created by the Russian Masonry has been for the first time ever introduced to the academic public. Metaphysic background in moral philosophy is outlined; Russian masons‚Äô religious and philosophical ideas and notions defining man's attitude to the world and to the society are specified. Such philosophical notions as free will and attitude to good and evil are discussed. Contemporary social and historical changes occurring in Russia inspired the researcher to turn to post industrial issues, such as knowledge management, development of academic capitalism, happiness economics.

Lead singer Rory Gallagher was the bass player and lead vocalist with Irish Indie/Pop/Punk group 'The Revs' from 2000 to 2007.  Background  In his time with The Revs they released numerous hit radio singles and 3 Albums; Sonictonic in 2002 (no. 5 Irish Charts), Suck in 2003 (no. 3 Irish Charts) and The Revs in 2005 (no. 26 Irish Charts). The Revs played the Oxegen (Irelands biggest annual music festival) Main Stage 4 times, Slane Castle, toured the USA, Australia (where they had a top 30 hit with \\"Death of a DJ\\") the UK and Europe and supported the Kaiser Chiefs, Foo fighters, Muse and many others. The band picked up 2 meteors, hotpress and BBC awards, a single of the month with Kerrang!, MTV2 coverage and an average of 300 gigs/public appearances per year... it all flew at a rapid pace. However, in late 2006 it all came to an end as the public interest in the band had died.  To present day  In 2008, Rory released his official solo debut album \\"God Bless the big bang\\". It received a positive reaction with Hotpress magazine declaring it \\"a Triumphant return\\" giving it 4 out of 5 stars, it also received album of the week from Today FM, The Sunday World and BBC Ulster. Rory released 2 singles from the Album and did 2 short tours of Ireland. However he had since become resident musician in Charlies Bar Lanzarote and found it difficult to go and play in front of 50 people in small venues around Ireland losing all his money on Petrol and Hotels when there were already 150 Irish people coming into Charlies bar in Lanzarote every night of the week. In 2010 Rory recorded some new original material with legendary Irish trad player Sharon Shannon (also a reworking of The Pogues classic \\"Fiesta\\" with Shane MacGowan), out of these sessions Rory had recorded a comedy demo song called \\"Ryanair Blues\\", it was leaked to Irish Radio and became a surprise online hit. It was then that Rory started releasing his new material under the name \\"RORY AND THE ISLAND\\" as it was a confusing using his birthname Rory Gallagher as many people would show up expecting a tribute to the Cork/ Donegal Blues Legend! The second album, \\"Auntie Depressant and Uncle Hope\\" (2012) also received acclaim from Hot Press Magazine, summarising it as 'a compelling suite of songs'. The album was recorded in various locations around the Spanish island of Lanzarote.

Evans was also a very successful long jumper, improving from a 19 feet 11 inches to a 23 feet 1 inch and 25 feet 1 inch by his senior year. University of Michigan =Recruiting and commitment= In June 2015, Evans, a long-time Ohio State fan, attended a Michigan Wolverines football satellite camp in Indianapolis. He caught the eye of Michigan coach Jim Harbaugh who proceeded to court Evans' parents. Evans gave his verbal commitment to play football at Michigan two days later. At the time, Evans said, \\"If coach Harbaugh thinks you're good, you must be.\\" After accepting an offer from Michigan, Evans was pursued by Ohio State, but he tweeted in early January 2016 that, though he was flattered by Ohio State's interest, he would maintain his commitment to Michigan. Recruited as an athlete, Evans was known for his versatility, as he saw action in high school at running back, slot receiver and cornerback. During the preseason training camp prior to his freshman year in 2016, Evans drew praise for his explosiveness and speed. Teammate Drake Johnson described him as \\"mad athletic\\" and \\"real smooth . . . like butter smooth, we're just like 'ooh, wow' \\", and added, \\"He just makes it look smooth and easy. He looks effortless when he does stuff, 'yeah, that was nice.'\\" Evans has been described as having \\"deceptive looks.\\" Bob Wojnowski of The Detroit News wrote: \\"He wears glasses (contacts during the game) and has sported a high-top haircut since he was a kid watching Will Smith on ‚ÄúThe Fresh Prince of Bel-Air.‚Äù =2016 season= On September 3, 2016, Evans appeared in his first game for Michigan.

He became the third Michigan player to rush for over 100 yards in his college debut. After the game, head coach Jim Harbaugh said, \\"I knew Chris Evans was special. What you saw today is what we have been seeing in practice the last month. He's a special football player. And you didn't get to see everything he can do.\\" Mark Snyder of the Detroit Free Press wrote of the game that \\"the spark came from freshman Chris Evans and his wiggle. Evans brought a different dimension than the bruising backs, maybe something U-M hasn‚Äôt seen since Denard Robinson.\\" Mitch Albom dubbed Evans \\"Captain Fantastic\\" and added \\"it might be a case of A Star is Born.\\" Michigan running backs coach Tyrone Wheatley said of Evans: \\"He's like my Steph Curry in the room. Meaning that he can create his own space, can win one-on-ones and, most surprisingly ... I didn't realize how tough he was between the tackles.\\" On October 8, 2016, Evans registered his second 100-yard rushing game in a 78-0 victory over Rutgers. Evans led Michigan's rushing attack with 153 yards on 11 carries for an average of 13.9 yards per carry. Through the first six games of the 2016 season, Evans was Michigan's leading rusher with 400 rushing yards and three touchdowns on 48 carries, an average of 8.3 yards per carry.

His most successful game came against Western Michigan on September 8, when he rushed for 86 yards and two rushing touchdowns. Evans finished the year with 423 rushing yards and four touchdowns. =2019 season= Evans, after the graduation of Karan Higdon, was set to be the Wolverines' leading returning rusher coming into the 2019 season as a senior. In February 2019, the team released a statement that Evans was no longer with the program. He announced via Twitter that he had \\"academic issues\\" and planned to continue his career at Michigan. In June, Michigan head coach Jim Harbaugh confirmed that Evans would be suspended for the 2019 season, but would be eligible to return in 2020.

It is widely referred to a fluorescent derivative of glucose, and it is used in cell biology to visualize uptake of glucose by cells. Cells that have taken up the compound fluoresce green. 2-NBDG is similar to radiolabeled glucose in that both can be used to detect glucose transport. Unlike radiolabeled glucose, 2-NBDG is compatible with fluorescence techniques such as a fluorescent microscopy, flow cytometry, and fluorimetry The compound is taken up by a variety of mammalian, plant, and microbial cells In mammalian cells, one transporter for 2-NBDG is GLUT2. In bacterial cells, the predominant transporter is the mannose phosphotransferase system. Cells that lack these or other compatible transporters do not take up 2-NBDG. Like glucose, 2-NBDG is transported according to Michaelis‚ÄìMenten kinetics. However, transport of 2-NBDG has a lower Vmax (maximum rate), and thus the rate of transport is generally slower than glucose. Once taken up, the compound is metabolized to a non-fluorescent derivative, as shown in Escherichia coli. The identity and further metabolism of this non-fluorescent derivative has not been established.

Although seemingly useful for protecting cookies from active network attackers, the Secure attribute protects only the cookie's confidentiality. An active network attacker can overwrite Secure cookies from an insecure channel, disrupting their integrity. This issue is officially referred to as Weak Integrity.

Even with \`Secure\`, sensitive information should never be stored in cookies, as they are inherently insecure and this flag can't offer real protection. Secure attribute is not the only protection mechanism for cookies, there are also HttpOnly and SameSite attributes. The HttpOnly attribute restricts the cookie from being accessed by, for instance, JavaScript, while the SameSite attribute only allows the cookie to be sent to the application if the request originated from the same domain.  Background  An HTTP cookie is a small packet of data that is sent from a web server to a user's web browser. There are two types of cookies: * Persistent cookies - Cookies that store information in user's browser for a long time. * Non-persistent cookies - Cookies that generally expire once the browser is closed.

Cookies that contain sensitive information such as usernames, passwords, and session identifiers can be captured using these tools once they are downloaded from a site to a web browser or accessed through a computer hard drive. = Network threats = Cookies that are sent over unencrypted channels can be subject to eavesdropping, i.e. the contents of the cookie can be read by the attacker. These types of threats can be prevented by the use of Secure Sockets Layer or SSL protocol in servers and Internet browsers although this works only if the cookies are on the network. One might also use cookies with only the sensitive information encrypted instead of the entirety of a data payload exchanged. = End system threats = Cookies can be stolen or copied from the user, which could either reveal the information in the cookies or allow the attacker to edit the contents of the cookies and impersonate the users. This happens when a cookie, which is in the browser's end system and stored in the local drive or memory in clear text, is altered or copied from one computer to another with or without the knowledge of the user. = Cookie harvesting = The attacker can try to impersonate a website by accepting cookies from the users. Once the attacker gets the cookies, he can use these harvested cookies for websites that accept third-party cookies. An example of this threat is the so- called Cross-Site Scripting attack, which involves the exploitation of the vulnerabilities of a website displaying data provided by the user that has underlying malicious intent. An attacker, for instance, could embed a script in a URL he has posted in a discussion forum, message board, or email, which is then activated when the target opens the hyperlink.

Heath (n√©e Parris; December 9, 1909 ‚Äì May 29, 1998) was an American politician and an entrepreneur who manufactured and sold gift boxes of jams and jellies made of wild local berries from Homer, Alaska. She founded \\"Alaska Wild Berry Products\\" with her husband Ken in 1946. The couple also owned an art shop and gallery, and she was arts and crafts editor for Alaska magazine. Heath served as mayor of Homer for eight years, and was a National Republican delegate and a member of many local, state and federal boards and commissions. She was a founder of the Pratt Museum, and was the first woman president of the Alaska Municipal League Conference of Mayors. The Homer Chamber of Commerce named her the 1977 \\"Citizen of the Year\\", and the University of Alaska honored her with a Meritorious Service Award in 1989.  Early life and education  Hazel Parris was born on December 9, 1909, in Athena, Oregon, the daughter of Wesley F. Parris and Olive Grace Belle Bryan. After graduating from high school in Helix, Oregon, in 1928 she attended business college in Seattle, where she married Kenneth A. Heath (1902‚Äì1965). The couple went together from Seattle to Alaska for defense jobs and toured Kodiak Island. In her memoir of early days in Homer, she wrote, \\"By the time we returned from our six weeks trip with Dal, around Kodiak Island where we ate ducks, clams, crabs, shrimp, blueberries, cranberries, smoked salmon and other kinds of seafood, we were completely sold on Alaska living.\\"  Alaska Wild Berry Products  In September 1946, Heath and her husband Ken partnered with Freda Coles to run the Kachemak Caf√© on Pioneer Avenue in Homer, Alaska. Eventually, Heath took over operations of the caf√©. Heath also began selling homemade local berry jams and jellies, canning on a large range powered by coal at the back of the caf√©, establishing Alaska Wild Berry Products. The Heaths sold the caf√© in 1955 to Sam and Goldy Gasperac. Heath's business plan was met with skepticism by locals, who doubted there were enough berries to \\"make gift boxes and ship them all over the country\\". Heath paid children to pick wild berries, and \\"when the fishing season was slim\\" she also paid fishermen and other locals to harvest the berries. Her business developed so quickly that in 1947 she sold 300 gift boxes, and by 1957 the business exported over 4000 gift boxes. Husband Ken abandoned his plans to start a \\"cabin court\\" business (a cluster of cottages for short-term rental) and instead purchased a Super Cub airplane to be able to harvest choice remote berry patches. They shipped gift boxes in large containers on steam ships to a forwarding station in Seattle, where packages were addressed and sent out by rail. Ken Heath died in January 1964, and Hazel Heath continued to manage the business until she sold it in 1975. One local resident observed, \\"Ken and Hazel had the idea that if you made up your mind you were going to make a living from the country, you could do it. I think that their enterprise really showed that it is possible if you have ingenuity and ambition.\\"  Community service  Heath is credited as a founder of the Pratt Museum in 1967. She was treasurer of the Homer Society of Natural History, Inc., the Museum's sponsoring agency, from 1968‚Äì1983. As an active member of the Alaska Historical Society until 1986, she served two terms on its board of directors; she was also a member of the Kenai Peninsula Historical Association, serving as its president for two years. In 1968 she established Homer Artists. She served on the board of directors of the Alaska State Chamber of Commerce from 1967‚Äì1984, and was a charter member of the Alaska Visitors Association. After she served on the Executive Committee of the Kenai Peninsula Development Council, Governor Jay Hammond recruited her for the Governor's Tourism Advisory Board.  Political career  Heath was a member of the Alaska Republican Party and National Republican Party and was the city of Homer's mayor from 1968‚Äì1976. She was the first woman president of the Alaska Municipal League Conference of Mayors. She lost her 1976 bid for re-election to the local newspaper editor who supported revocation of oil leases in the Kachemak Bay, which she opposed. Heath \\"was a national Republican delegate many times, and was a member of numerous federal, state and local boards and commissions, including the University of Alaska, local and state chambers of commerce, local and state museum boards, and state and national senior citizens advisory boards\\". Governors Hammond and Bill Sheffield appointed her to the Older Alaskans Commission between 1982‚Äì1989. As a ten-year member of the Kenai Peninsula Community College Council, she served two years as its president.  Writing and editing  Heath wrote and compiled first-person accounts of early pioneers in Homer, In Those Days ‚Äî Alaska Pioneers of the Lower Kenai Peninsula. She worked as arts and crafts editor at Alaska magazine for five years.  Awards and legacy  According to one source, \\"Heath‚Äôs pioneering role in local and state government paved the way for many other women to get involved in politics. She possessed an acute doggedness when undertaking something that would make life in Homer and Alaska better for herself and others.\\" In 1977 she was named the Homer Chamber of Commerce \\"Citizen of the Year\\", and the University of Alaska gave her a Meritorious Service Award in 1989. Heath was inducted into the 2010 Class of the Alaska Women's Hall of Fame.

Life  Ekkehard Kallee attended from 1932 the Eberhard-Ludwigs-Gymnasium in Stuttgart, where he learned Latin and Ancient Greek but comparatively few natural sciences. During World War II he was from 1940 to 1945 a paramedic and subsequently held in custody in a French prisoner-of-war camp in Bad Niedernau for half a year. He studied medicine and graduated in 1950 at the Eberhard Karls University of T√ºbingen and joined the student fraternity T√ºbinger K√∂nigsgesellschaft Roigel only at a very late stage. He wrote his doctoral thesis from 1947 to 1950 at Carl Martius and Adolf Butenandt about Experiments on the chemical synthesis of an organophosphate of citric acid (Versuche zur Darstellung eines Phosphors√§ure-Esters der Citronens√§ure). The experiments themselves did not have positive results, but Ekkehard Kallee made very interesting observations, with which he could contradict the earlier conclusions of two chemists by acribic efforts. He married the pedagogue and later social pedagogue Barbara Kallee, n√©e Weigmann, in 1965 and had with her one son, Stephan Kallee. In his spare time he maintained two Suabian meadow orchards in Ammerbuch, and arranged regularly an annual hiking tour with his dental medicine students to these. As a consequence, his brandies and liquors, which were branded with the Latin slogan ex hortis manibusque Kallee (from Kallee's gardens and hands) became well known within the student community. As a university professor and doctor for nuclear medicine, he was Head of the Radionuclide Laboratory of the University Hospital for Internal Medicine in T√ºbingen, until he became an emeritus in 1987. He was a Member of the European Thyroid Association, the German Association for Endocrinology and the German Association for Internal Medicine.  Education, research and public obligation  His scientific work ‚Äì from the time of his doctorate until more than 20 years after becoming an emeritus ‚Äì was based on the understanding of the reversibility of adsorption processes, as postulated by Irving Langmuir in his sorption isotherm. Ekkehard Kallee was the first to prove the existence of adsorption distribution levels with this. By understanding the adsorption processes, he succeeded in detecting protein traces by paper electrophoresis of radioactive-iodine-marked insulin. This was, at that time, a breakthrough by several orders of magnitude for the analytical clinical chemistry. Eventually, it was the base for all later immunological detection procedures for various active ingredients. He published already in 1954 two German articles about the detection method with 131I-marked insulin.Ekkehard Kallee: √úber 131J-signiertes Insulin, I. Mitteilung. (Nachweis). Zeitschrift f√ºr Naturforschung B, volume 7, 1952, page 661. Cited in B A Burrows, T Peters & F C Lowell: Physical Binding of insulin by gamma globulins of insulin-resistant subjects.

Anwendungsbereich und Grenzen der Nachweismethode, In: Klinische Wochenschrift, 1954, 32, 508-509. By taking autoradiographs of capillary electrophoresis strips he could detect down to 10‚àí9 gram 131I-marked insulin. He examined serums of humans, rats and guinea pigs and noted that these varied in their capability, to reduce the specific adsorption of veal insulin in filtration paper. Human serums were better suited for the specific insulin detection method than rat or guinea pig serums at the time, because they showed the characteristic 131I-marked insulin bands only, when non-radioactive carrier-insulin was added. In this field of research one half of the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine was given to Rosalyn Sussman Yalow in 1977 for the development of radioimmunological methods for the detection of peptide hormones.Prof. Dr. Richard Wahl: Nachruf auf Professor Ekkehard Kallee, ein Pionier in seinem Fach.

The research team's idea about the passive transport of protein-bound substances was triggered by the medical examination of patients with disorders caused by a lack of albumin. One of Ekkehard Kallee's key research topics was the analbuminaemia, a rarely occurring genetic disorder, of which only 50 cases have been published worldwide.Register of Analbuminemia Cases, The Mary Imogene Bassett Hospital Research Institute, Cooperstown, NY. Ekkehard Kallee examined two Suebian siblings with analbuminaemia over a period of 38 years.Bennhold's analbuminemia: A follow-up study of the first two cases (1953‚Äì1992), The Journal of Laboratory and Clinical Medicine, volume 127, issue 5, pages 470-480 (May 1996). These are globally the first two patients, for whom this illness has been diagnosed and published.‚Äô‚ÄôH. Bennhold, H. Peters & E. Roth: √úber einen Fall von kompletter Analbuminaemie ohne wesentliche klinische Krankheitszeichen, Verh. Dtsch. Ges. Inn. Med. 60, 1954, 630-634.Mary S. Ruhoff, Michael W. Greene, Theodore Peters: Location of the mutation site in the first two reported cases of analbuminemia. In: Clinical Biochemistry. 43, 2010, page 525‚Äì527, . The female analbuminaemia patient was treated with a substitution therapy mit human serum albumin. Laboratory analysis before and after the infusion of large amounts of albumin gave a hint about a mechanism, by which albumin-bound substances were transported passively in the blood within the circulatory system into the extracellular fluid volume and the other way round. She developed in the fourth decade of her life an extreme lipodystrophy. She had a juvenile osteoporosis, which could be normalised by the albumin substitution. She died at the age of 69 years from cancer. Her brother didn't ever get any albumin, although his serum contained only 60 ¬µg/ml of an albumin-like protein. He suffered from an extreme osteoporosis and died at the age of 59 years from colorectal cancer. Although both patients had high cholesterol values and a high number of blood clotting factors, they did not have any disadvantages by that. Generally, most of Ekkehard Kallee's research projects were based on the interaction with patients. This is particularly relevant for the diagnosis and therapy of thyroid illnesses as one of the first doctors of nuclear medicine in Germany. Long before the Chernobyl disaster he assessed the risks and benefits of iodine prophylaxis at nuclear power plant disasters.Ekkehard Kallee: Nutzen und Risiko der Jodprophylaxe bei Kernreaktorunf√§llen, Der Internist, May 1981; 22(5): 304-7. After the disaster, he examined food from the regions affected by the nuclear fallout and developed a method on decontaminating radioactively contaminated meet ‚Äì especially rendeer and deer meet ‚Äì by curing.R. Wahl, E. Kallee: Decontamination puts meat in a pickle. In: Nature, volume 323, Number 6085, 18‚Äì24 September 1986, page 208, . . .  Family  Ekkehard Kallee was from an academic family in W√ºrttemberg: His father Albert Kallee was director of the Landgericht Stuttgart and expert for employment law.G. W.: Ein liebenswerter Menschner Jurist ‚Äì Verabschiedung von Landgerichtsdirektor Dr. Kallee. In: Heilbronner Stimme. Saturday 12 May 1951. His grandfather Richard Kallee was Lutheran parish priest in Feuerbach and as a local historian discovered 102 alamannic sandstone cists in Feuerbach and documented 760 archaeological finds.Heinz Kr√§mer: Fertig Feuerbach! Richard Kallee, Pfarrer und Geschichtsforscher, DRW Verlag, Leinfelden-Echterdingen, 2004, . The Kalleestra√üe in Stuttgart-Feuerbach is named after him. His great-grandfather, General Eduard von Kallee was probably an illegitimate son of King William I of W√ºrttemberg and devoted himself after an unusually steep military and diplomatic career to literary, artistic and archaeological studies, during which discovered several Roman sites along the Limes Germanicus.

By 1903 the Austin Brook Iron Mine was formed, and operated under the name Drummond until 1913, when it went bust. It was in receivership for some short time until the Dominion Steel and Coal Company purchased the right to operate the mine from Canadian Iron Industries, who held the lease. Between 1920 and 1926, the construction of the Grand Falls hydroelectricity dam and plant required twice-daily return trips with a steam locomotive. Thereafter, a gasoline-powered jitney, trolly or automobile with steel wheels would serve, until in the early 1950s the Brunswick Mine attracted attention once again to the area. In 1955 a highway was pushed through to the mine site, and two years later the rails were sold for scrap.

Biography Ren√© was born in Carouge, a suburb of Geneva. His father was a militant socialist from Palermo and his mother, Lidia Ignatieff, was the daughter of a Russian businessman. As a young man, he traveled to Paris. His parents travelled frequently, including to Moscow and Florence. As an infant, his family stayed mostly in Florence where he attended the , and enrolled in the Physics program of the University of Bologna, but ended by completing his physics thesis in Palermo in 1911, on the subject of light spectra. After having been refused an academic position at Palermo, he became a teacher of natural sciences at the Barnabite affiliated Collegio alla Quercia in Florence. He continued to spend time painting and befriended the painter Baccio Maria Bacci. He also worked as a translator of French and Russian. In 1912, he married the pianist Ella Klatschko (1880-1966), daughter of the Russian- Jewish revolutionary, . In 1912, they moved to Paris. There he met or befriended Cezanne, Odilon Redon, Picasso, Diaghilev, √âlie Faure, Paul Fort, Max Jacob, Andr√© Salmon, Diego Rivera, and Modigliani, who dedicated a painting to him in 1917. During World War I, he moved to London, where he participated in marine research with the National Physical Laboratory. While there, he met Oskar Kokoschka. After the war, he traveled as a journalist to cover the Versailles conference, working for Il Giornale d'Italia and, later, La Stampa; signing his articles Renato. He soon was writing pieces about art criticism and painting to support his family. He remained in Paris until 1930. In 1926, Margherita Sarfatti invited Ren√© to exhibit in Milan with the painters of the Novecento Italiano. He continued to exhibit in Venice, Z√ºrich, and Paris. In 1931, under the patronage of , he was part of an exhibition of Italian painters at the Salon de l'Escalier in Paris, together with Giorgio De Chirico, Alberto Savinio, Mario Tozzi, Filippo de Pisis, Gino Severini, and Massimo Campigli, among others. In 1933, Ren√© had a personal exhibition hosted at the Galleria del Milione in Milan. In 1934, he took a voyage around the world, with a stop at Fiji, then crossed the United States; a trip he chronicled in a series of articles for La Stampa. In 1935, they were collected in a book titled L‚Äôaltra America.

Two longish, dark oval stripes in anterior half of the bright median band. The opisthosoma is dark reddish brown with dark with an indistinct cardiac mark. Habitat and ecology T. spinipalpis has a preference for damp places, especially Sphagnum bogs, wet heathland, damp meadows, fens or marshes. Distribution Palearctic but more northerly in regions where suitable wetlands exist, e.g. in Europe north of the Mediterranean zone. In Great Britain it has a very scattered distribution and is widespread but localised. Conservation In Great Britain T. spinipalpis has declined and this is probably attributable to drainage of wetlands. Protection of wetlands from drainage and conversion to other land uses by ensuring adequate water supplies is essential to this spider's conservation. Bite T. spinipalpis is capable of biting humans, usually when handled and accidentally squeezed. The bite is as painful as a wasp sting and may cause a moderate local epidermal swelling.

The plutons stretch over an area of about , and intruded and cooled in Late Cretaceous times.Iba√±ez et al., 2007 Much of the batholith is weathered into a thick saprolite mantle. In some locations this saprolite reaches thicknesses of about . The development of this weathering is attributed to the humid climate and to stable conditions with limited amounts of erosion. Where the batholith-derived saprolite is eroded, inselbergs, such as El Pe√±√≥n de Guatap√©, crop out. Inselbergs correspond to rock masses of the batholith that resisted weathering and erosion by being less fractured.Garc√≠a & Hermelin, 2016, pp.139-154  Etymology  The batholith was named after Antioquia by Botero in 1942, after various authors as Boussignault in 1825, Ospina in 1911, Scheibe in 1933 and Posada in 1936 mentioned its existence.Albarrac√≠n et al., 2011, p.100  Geology  The batholith varies in composition between hornblende-biotite tonalite to granodiorite, with lateral variations between gabbro to granite. Common minerals are hornblende, quartz, plagioclase, K-feldspar, biotite and amphibole, with traces of epidote, chlorite and sphene. The batholith underlies the municipalities San Andr√©s de Cuerquia, San Jos√© de la Monta√±a,Plancha 115, 1974 in the east of San Jer√≥nimo, around Belmira,Plancha 130, 1983 in Don Mat√≠as, Girardota, G√≥mez Plata, Entrerr√≠os, Carolina del Pr√≠ncipe, Barbosa, Santo Domingo, and Santa Rosa de Osos.Plancha 131, 2010 Because of profound meteorization, outcrops are scarce and restricted to riverbeds,Albarrac√≠n et al., 2011, p.101 and at El Pe√±√≥n de Guatap√©. To the northwest of the urban center of Santa Rosa de los Osos, bauxite mineralizations of the batholith are found.Albarrac√≠n et al., 2011, p.103 = Origin = The batholith intruded the Triassic San Isidro Granulite, Ceja Gneiss and Medell√≠n Amphibolite, schists of the Valdivia Group, and migmatites of the Ayura Montebello Group. Xenoliths of those host rocks in which the batholith intruded consist of quartz-mica schists, amphibolites and gneisses.Albarrac√≠n et al., 2011, p.110 In certain places, the batholith is overlain by the El Vergel Beds, alluvium and other Quaternary deposits. = Tectonics = In Belmira, the R√≠o Chico Fault places the Medell√≠n Dunite against the Antioquia Batholith. The Ot√∫-Pericos Fault places the Antioquia Batholith in contact with the Jurassic Segovia Batholith. The Esp√≠ritu Santo Fault runs just north of the batholith near San Andr√©s de Cuerquia. Other faults cross-cutting the batholith are:Geological map of Antioquia, 1999 * Balseadero Fault * Biscocho Fault * Caldera Fault * Miraflores Fault * Monteloro Fault * Nare Fault = Age = A 2019 summary of ages obtained for the batholith show that the batholith formed in a protracted manner from 97 to 58 million years ago (Ma), that is from the Late Cretaceous to the Paleocene. For the main part of the intrusion there is a best estimate of the age between 71 ¬± 1.2 and 77 ¬± 1.7 Ma, suggesting an intrusion age near the boundary of the Campanian and Maastrichtian.Albarrac√≠n et al., 2011, p.114  Hydrology  R√≠o Grande Reservoir The Medell√≠n River cross-cuts the batholith from southwest to northeast, where it flows in the Porce River.

In March 2015, the 62-year-old Turner entered a songwriting contest, where he was given a choice between \\"a song of hope or a song of protest.\\" With the election coming up, he chose the latter and won the contest. Turner was inspired by an article in JUSTnews, the newsletter of the Canadian Unitarians for Social Justice which listed a dozen ways the Harper government had attacked democracy. Turner added to the list and created a nine verse song that was recorded on 12 June. Turner was backed by members of various community choirs, social action groups and concerned citizens. The video was posted to YouTube on the 22nd, where it has been widely viewed.  Reaction  On August 10, Turner was suspended with pay. The song was deemed to violate the code of neutrality that civil servants were expected to follow. Turner, who was close to retirement, decided to retire rather than wait out an investigation. However, the song caught on the popular mood, and on September 17 a cross- country sing-along was held in dozens of cities as well a large rally on Parliament Hill.

It makes only two cuts, so each partner receives a single connected piece. Its main advantage over the earlier Stromquist moving-knives procedure and the later Barbanel‚ÄìBrams moving-knives procedure is that it requires only a single moving-knife. This advantage uses the two-dimensional nature of the cake.  Procedure  Initially, each partner makes a vertical cut such that the cake to its left is worth for him exactly 1/3. The leftmost cut is selected. Suppose this cut belongs to Alice. So Alice receives the leftmost piece and her value is exactly 1/3. The remainder has to be divided between the remaining partners (Bob and Carl). Note that Alice's part is worth at most 1/3 and the remainder is worth at least 2/3 for Bob and Carl. So, if Bob and Carl each receive at least half of the remainder, they do not envy. The challenge is to make sure Alice won't envy any of them. The solution is based on the following observation: For each angle \\\\alpha\\\\in[0,180^\\\\circ], Alice can put a knife in angle \\\\alpha and cut the remainder to two halves equal in her eyes. This means that Alice can rotate a knife over the remainder such that the parts from the two sides of the knife are always equal in her eyes. When the knife is at angle 0, Bob (weakly) prefers either the piece above the knife or the piece below the knife; when the knife is at angle 180, the pieces are reversed. Hence, by the intermediate value theorem, there must be an angle in which Bob thinks the pieces from both sides of the knife are equal. At this angle, Bob shouts \\"stop!\\". The cake is cut, Carl chooses a piece and Bob receives the other piece.  Analysis  Alice does not envy because for her, all three pieces are worth exactly 1/3. Bob and Carl do not envy Alice because her piece is worth at most 1/3 and their piece at least (1/2)*(2/3) = 1/3. Bob does not envy Carl because their pieces are equal in his eyes; Carl does not envy Bob because he picked the best piece in his eyes.  Dividing a 'bad' cake  The rotating-knife procedure can be adapted for chore division - dividing a cake with a negative value: in the initial step, The rightmost cut should selected, instead of the leftmost cut.

The concept was born as a way to \\"celebrate the beauty, power and resilience of Black women,‚Äù as described by Julee Wilson from HuffPost, and to congratulate Black women on their accomplishments. Referring to a speech made by Michelle Obama at the Black Girls Rock Awards, Thompson explains that Black women around the world who were persevering, despite adversity, inspired her to spread the concept of \\"Black Girl Magic\\". With these women in mind, Thompson created the social media hashtag, clothing campaign and rallying cry \\"Black Girl Magic,‚Äù in hopes of counteracting negativity society places on Black women. Though born online, the movement has inspired many organizations across the world to host events using the title. The movement has also seen celebrity support, as singers Corinne Bailey Rae, Jamila Woods, Janelle Mon√°e and Solange Knowles have invoked the concept, and ballerina Misty Copeland and President Barack Obama discussed the idea in an interview with Maya Rhodan for Time and Essence magazines. Since being popularized, the concept has also gained traction in cultural criticism, invoked in analysis of music and film. As its usage has grown, the expression has drawn criticism as well as staunch defenders. In 2016, poet Mahogany L. Browne created a slam poetry piece entitled \\"Black Girl Magic\\". Founding =Hashtag= In 2013, Thompson coined the phrase via the hashtag #BlackGirlsAreMagic‚Äî now shortened to #BlackGirlMagic‚Äîto create an online dialogue centered on the achievements of Black women, in a society that has historically recognized very few of these achievements. Thompson saw the publication of a Psychology Today blog post titled \\"Why Are Black Women Rated Less Physically Attractive Than Other Women, But Black Men Are Rated Better Looking Than Other Men,\\" as well as other negative articles about Black women. The article was retracted, but the negative message is pervasive. She created the original hashtag to share affirmations for Black women and girls in order to change the prominent narrative. Now colloquially used on popular social media sites, the hashtag can be seen being used widely on sites such as Twitter, Instagram, Facebook, and other mainstream media platforms, with a symbol of celebrating positive messages and images of Black women all across the globe. On June 26, 2016 actor Jesse Williams mentioned the movement in his speech at the BET Awards 2016. Williams showed his appreciation for Black women by emphasizing the importance of acknowledging their accomplishments. Williams ended his speech by stating the following \\"just because we're magic, does not mean we're not real.\\" Williams' objective was to make the audience as well as viewers understand that Black Girl Magic is not just a hashtag but it is a slogan that is connected to deeply rooted pain and unspoken historical events of oppression, discrimination and dehumanization. On February 15, 2016, Essence launched \\"Essence Black Girl Magic\\", a video series sponsored by Walmart. This original six-part docuseries captures the poignant stories and diverse lifestyles of six young that epitomize Black excellence. Additionally, Essence has a segment of their website dedicated to celebrating the achievements of Black girls. = Clothing campaign = In January 2014, Thompson began selling T-shirts sporting the \\"Black Girls Are Magic\\" logo that she created with her friend. At the time, Thompson only meant to sell these shirts to her friends and family, but has since sold over 3,000 T-shirts through her Teespring account. While the popularity of the shirts started among active social media users, Thompson was quickly surprised to see that people were also buying them as gifts for granddaughters, daughters, and nieces, as they felt that the message was encouraging for young girls too. The shirts have also gained some celebrity recognition, with prominent young Black women such as Willow Smith, Amandla Stenberg Ryan Destiny, Yara Shahidi, Zendaya, Lupita Nyong'o, Laura Harrier and many other incredible Black women and girls posting pictures of themselves on various social media platforms wearing their Black Girls Are Magic gear. =Philosophy= \\"I say 'magic' because it's something that people don't always understand,\\" Thompson told The Los Angeles Times. She went on to explain how \\"Sometimes our accomplishments might seem to come out of thin air, because a lot of times, the only people supporting us are other Black women.\\" At its core, the purpose of this movement is to create a platform where women of color can stand together against the stereotyping, colourism, misogynoir and racism that is often their lived experience. Clarissa Joan of Madame Noir wrote a series of articles called \\"Black Girl Magic Defined\\" that addresses the day to day experience of living black girl magic. Black women face challenges specific to their race and gender, and Joan's articles explore these ideas. On October 30, 2016 musician Solange Knowles and public scholar Melissa Harris-Perry took the stage at CEMEX Auditorium for an intimate conversation about the Black Girl Magic, in the discussion Solange and Harris-Perry touched on the merits of formal education, issues of geopolitical racism, family dynamics and more, all in the context of race and what it means to be an African American woman. Solange, who pushes the agenda of Black excellence and has been very vocal about the issues of intersectionality in America, shared her thoughts on Black Girl Magic with Harris-Perry. In a separate interview, Harris-Perry described the celebration of Black Girl Magic: \\"What I like about Black Girl Magic is that it designates those moments when black girlhood or black womanhood isn‚Äôt being used for surplus labor value for some other system, but just for your damn self.\\"  In popular culture  = Music = With her 2016 single \\"Blk Girl Soldier\\" and its accompanying video, singer, songwriter, and poet Jamila Woods centers Black Girl Magic. Woods draws on the popular understanding of Black Girl Magic as a quality of power and perseverance in Black women and girls that people \\"don't understand\\", yet she further enriches the concept by centering the historic contributions of Black female revolutionaries such as Harriet Tubman, Sojourner Truth, Rosa Parks, Ella Baker, Audre Lorde, Angela Davis, and Assata Shakur. With footage of a contemporary #SayHerName protest, Woods draws a line from abolitionism through the civil rights movement and Black feminism to modern day political activism, linking these movements as expressions of Black Girl Magic. With lyrics such as \\"she scares the gov'ment,\\" and the inclusion of a quote from Black Liberation Army member Shakur to bookend the song, Woods posits that Black Girl Magic is not only about a celebration of Black women, but also their radical and uncompromising fight against oppression. Speaking about the song's video, Woods states, \\"The goal of the ‚ÄòBlk Girl Soldier‚Äô video is to lift up the Black women throughout history and today who inspire me and who are doing brilliant artistic and activist work. Knowing my history and what my people have survived before me has made me stronger.‚Äù In 2018, NPR ranked \\"Blk Girl Soldier\\" as the #144 greatest song by a female or nonbinary artist in the 21st century, writing that the song is \\"tinged with sadness about injustices committed ‚Äòlast century, last week,‚Äô but infused with the beautiful power of those who fought and keep fighting.\\" In Stormzy's freestyle as part of his live performance at the BRIT Awards 2020, he said: 'I got two sisters, one black mum, they raised a prince. / Raised up by black girl magic, what did you think, huh?', in reference to his upbringing, his family and the Black Girl Magic movement. In 2018, Sampa the Great released \\"Black Girl Magik\\" feat. Nicole Gumbe. According to the artist, the song is written for \\"sisters like me, with skin as dark as the night that shines so effortlessly. I wrote this for my sister, who looks in the mirror and calls out to beauty, who can no longer see her.\\" Janelle Mon√°e's 2018 track \\"Django Jane\\" refers to Black Girl Magic. The lyrics, \\"Black girl magic, y'all can't stand it / Y'all can't ban it, made out like a bandit.\\" The artist wrote about the line on Genius: > Because we come from generations and generations of queens and kings, and > then having to go through being stripped of our identity, of our magic, > we‚Äôre resilient. It‚Äôs a celebration of our resilience, our power, our > influence on culture, the way we wear our hair, our style has been > influential to the fashion worlds and music worlds, just to media, and to > culture, for many decades and centuries. I want to celebrate us as much as I > possibly can, and I think that black women, we should be able to see ourself > in the future. We should be able to see that we make it, and we‚Äôre stronger > than we were in the past. We‚Äôre stronger than our grandmothers, you know > what I‚Äôm saying? Beyonc√© is a quintessential example of Black Girl Magic. Beyonc√©‚Äôs hit single Formation speaks directly to Black women to \\"get in formation\\" and celebrates her daughter's \\"baby hair afro.\\" By centering her culture and exploring her identity as a Black woman, she celebrates \\"unapologetic blackness.\\" According to scholar Charlotte Theys, Formation is a rejection and reconstruction of the stereotypical black woman. Her appearance at the 2016 VMAs with collaborators from Lemonade was hailed as a powerful statement that combined her artistic message with her political one. Additionally, Halliday and Brown argue that \\"Feeling Myself\\" by Nicki Minaj featuring Beyonc√© is a \\"#blackgirlmagic anthem\\" that Black girls use to empower themselves. The fifth track on Wale‚Äôs 2019 album ‚ÄúWow...That‚Äôs Crazy‚Äù is titled ‚ÄúBGM,‚Äù an acronym for Black Girl Magic as revealed in the song‚Äôs chorus. On the track, he expresses that he is proud of black women for confronting and defeating the obstacles that they often face as a result of societal barriers and racial inequalities. The upbeat, funk-inspired track also alludes to the beauty and independence of black women. Wale released the track in honor of Women‚Äôs Equality Day on August 26, 2019. = Athletics = Serena Williams may be the best known Black woman athlete, and her accomplishments have garnered her praise, recognition, accolades, sponsorships, and veneration. Simone Biles, Serena Williams, and Gabby Douglas are hailed as three Black Girl Magic models. \\"While significant in their own right, these accomplishments symbolized much more than just athletic proficiency. All three women proved the enduring spirit of Black people. Our community has been tested time and time again and yet still we find the strength to rise.\\" Additionally, Simone Manuel's gold medal for the women's 100-meter freestyle in swimming was a monumental event considering the legacy of racial discrimination of Black people in swimming pools. Bustle magazine highlighted the 2016 Rio Olympics as an important moment for Black Girl Magic, as Simone Biles, Simone Manuel, Lia Neal, Michelle Carter, Allyson Felix, Gabby Douglas, Sloane Stephens, and Ashleigh Johnson competed in various events and many of these women won medals. Dominique Dawes, Tidye Pickett, and Louise Stokes were also included as inspirational Black women athletes. The Root featured athletes Maya Moore, Tori Bowie, Michelle Carter, Shamier Little, Ajee Wilson, Ashleigh Johnson, Alysia Montano, and Brittney Reese for embracing their Black Girl Magic prior to the Olympic games. Reuters recognized Brianna Rollins, Nia Ali, and Kristi Castlin for their sweep of the high hurdles. = Film = Hidden Figures was lauded for its portrayal of Katherine Johnson, Dorothy Vaughn, and Mary Jackson, mathemeticians and engineers at NASA who were integral during the Space Race. = Television = An episode of K.C. Undercover: \\"The Legend of Bad, Bad Cleo Brown\\" was written by two Black women, Raynelle Swilling and Teri Schaffer, directed by a Black woman, Nzingha Stewart, and stars a Black actress, Zendaya. Nzingha Stewart's goal of the episode was for the Black girls watching \\"to remember that they come from strong stock, and they too have that seed of black girl magic inside of them just waiting for them to act on it.\\" Controversy Some have criticised the movement as being racist, claiming that its reverse, \\"white Girl Magic\\" would be interpreted as racist, so it too should be classified as such. While many Black women support the concept of Black Girl Magic, some feel it reinforces the \\"strong Black woman\\" archetype that Black women often confront. In an article for Elle Magazine, Linda Chavers argued that the movement suggests that Black women are superhuman, or something other than human. She goes on to explain how, historically, Black women have been seen and treated as subhuman beings, and how the image of Black women persevering despite her suffering, is the epitome of the strong Black woman type that is often celebrated while simultaneously being criticized in today's culture. Rachel Dolezal received criticism for her appearance at a natural hair rally in Dallas, Texas. Olinka Green, a community activist, said, ‚ÄúRachel wants the black girl magic and the glory and attribution, but she can‚Äôt put up with what we go through day to day.‚Äù The term Black Girl Magic is under legal dispute. Essence and Beverly Bond are both trying to trademark the term. In 2014, Bond attempted to trademark the term for use with Black Girls Rock! but the application was marked abandoned in 2016. Bond applied for a service mark, butting heads with Essence's attempt to service mark \\"Essence Black Girl Magic.\\" In March 2019, Google released an advertisement celebrating Black Girl Magic, but neglected to mention or include Thompson or Bond. The erasure of the Black women who created and popularized the phrase rankled members of the community who constantly see Black women's contributions erased or minimized.  Legacy  In 2016, Black Girl Magic Ltd was established as a nonprofit organization in an attempt to create a legacy and continuity throughout Europe.

She served in the Second Boer War in South Africa and then later served during the First World War in Baghdad as matron-in-chief of Mesopotamia. She was one of the inaugural recipients of the Florence Nightingale Medal. Early life Beatrice Isabel Jones was born on 21 September 1866 to Alicia and William Bolton Jones of Wallasey in Cheshire (now Merseyside), England. After completing her education at Wallasey High School, she began nursing training at St. Bartholomew's Hospital in London in 1891. After a three-year course of study, she completed her training. Nursing career In 1894, Jones began working at St. Barts, holding various positions until 1896 when she took a position as the Assistant Matron of the New General Hospital in Birmingham. Jones left the infirmary in 1897 when she was appointed matron of Victoria Park Hospital in London. In January 1900, she joined Princess Christian's Army Nursing Service Reserve and the following month was called for service in the Second Boer War. She served in General Hospital No. 1 at Wynberg, No. 2 of Pretoria and finally No. 5 at Wynberg, before she returned to Britain and her post as matron at Victoria Park in November. When Queen Alexandra's Imperial Military Nursing Service (QAIMNS) was established in 1902, Jones applied and was appointed as a matron in 1903. Soon thereafter, Jones began working as Mmtron of the Royal Herbert Hospital, at Woolwich. but resigned after only a few months. While she was working there, she was awarded the gold badge of the QAIMNS by Queen Alexandra and then in a ceremony in the yard, all members of the Royal Army Medical Corps who had served in the Boer War were issued the Queen's South Africa Medal. In spite of having tendered her resignation in 1903, Jones had returned to Herbert in 1904. In April 1905, it was announced that Jones had been appointed as matron for the new hospital to be built in Millbank. Though the Queen Alexandra Military Hospital construction had not begun, Jones, fifteen nurses and six sisters were hired. The purpose of the hospital was to train nurses to work in other facilities and for the first time, before nurses could be eligible to become matrons, they were required to pass a nursing examination. In 1913, Jones was awarded the decoration of the Royal Red Cross by the King George V. Jones led 250 nurses to organise the first hospital for British troops in Mesopotamia in 1916. As chief matron of Mesopotamia, she also established hospitals in Basra and Mosul, ensuring that they were organised according to her exacting standards. In 1918, she was awarded a Bar for her Royal Red Cross, and the following year was awarded for her work in Mesopotamia with appointment as a Commander of the Order of the British Empire. In 1920, Jones was one of the inaugural recipients of the Florence Nightingale Medal, which had been established to recognise nursing excellence. Jones left Mesopotamia briefly in 1920 and then returned to serve as Chief of Civil Administration in Baghdad until her death there on 14 January 1921. She was buried in Baghdad (North Gate) Cemetery, and was the only woman buried among the 4,555 war casualties. A memorial tablet was dedicated to Jones as the first Matron of Queen Alexandra's Military Hospital by Queen Alexandra in 1922, during a ceremony to honour all of the women of the QAIMNS who had lost their lives during the First World War. The Imperial Military Nurses Memorial was in the hospital chapel, with a separate memorial for Jones. The entire memorial was later installed at All Saints Royal Garrison Church in Aldershot Garrison, including the plaque stating that Jones was first matron of the Hospital there, when the Queen Alexandra's Military Hospital was decommissioned. In 1989 a re-dedication service was held for the plaques.

Owned by shoemakers and tanners for almost 200 years, from 1732, until the early 1920s, it bears testament to a time when K√∏ge was a centre for shoemaking and tanning. The building fronting the street and a side wing on its rear are listed. History Built between 1595 and 1600, Garverg√•rden is the oldest building in Vestergade. It was one of few houses in the street that survived the great fire of 1633 which destroyed large parts of western and southern K√∏ge. The first known owner of the property was skipper Albret Gudmandsen. He died in 1634 and shortly thereafter his widow married another skipper, Mads Nielsen, who died in 1646. In 1650, the wealthy widow, aged 53, married the local pastor of St Nicolas' Church, Christian Madsen Tausen. The couple moved to Norway when he was appointed to Bishop of Stavanger in 1661. The first shoemaker to own the property acquired it in 1732. K√∏ge was by then a centre for shoemaking and tanning. The town's shoemakers had been granted a royal license to sell their products on the markets in many towns on Zealand. Those shoemakers who owned property bordering K√∏ge √Ö were usually also active in tanning and the town became home to several specialized tanneries. At the census of 1800, K√∏ge was home to a total of 25 shoemakers. With their families, employees and servants it added up to 193 people or one eighth of K√∏ge's 1,526 residents. A tanner first took over the building in 1808. The last tanner to own it was Julius Christensen, who purchased it in 1882 and continued to operate it as a tannery until the early 1920s. The ground floor was then converted into a shop. Bernina Syeksperten has occupied the premises since 1983.

It was built for David Sumner, a major local landowner and operator of sawmills. The house, now the Sumner Mansion Inn, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1989. Description and history The David Sumner House occupies a prominent position in the main village of Hartland, set in the southeast crook of a bend in United States Route 5 at its junction with Vermont Route 12 and Quechee Road. Its main block is a two-story brick structure, from which a two-story and single-story ell, both of 20th-century construction, extend to the rear. The main block is five bays wide and two deep, with the main entrance at the center of the north-facing front facade. It is flanked by sidelight windows and is topped by a multilight arched transom with a projecting overhang above. The window above the entrance is a full-length sash with a rounded top, and is flanked by sidelights in the style of a Palladian window. The ground-floor windows on the front are topped by decorative headers. The roof is encircled by a balustrade, which is a 20th- century addition recovered from another period house. The building interior retains many original features, including an elliptically curved central staircase. The two ells were added in the 20th-century; the first was made to original plans of the house that were not executed at the time of its construction. with The house was built about 1807, possibly to a design by Asher Benjamin or one of his apprentices; Benjamin was active in the area earlier in the decade. David Sumner was a major local landowner engaged in the lumber business and civic affairs. He operated local sawmills, worked to improve the navigability of the Connecticut River, and built bridges across the river to improve the area's transportation. It served in town offices, the state legislature, and the local militia during the War of 1812. This house was his home until his death in 1867. In 1970, the building's owner, Marvin Hatch, added the roof balustrade and the first ell, the latter based on discovered house plans. The building now serves as an inn and event venue.

Early years  Vera Markovna Markova was born in 1870 and given to the St. Petersburg Foundling Hospital at an early age. For a time, she lived with poor peasants in near Yamburg, and attended the village school, however at the age of fourteen she returned to the orphanage and was assigned to technical work. In 1890, she left the orphanage to work as a weaver in a cotton mill.  Beginnings of the labour movement  Aleksey Yegorovich Karelin Karelina became involved in the Russian labour movement at the age of 20, when she joined a workers' circle led by Fyodor Afanasev. The circle was part of the Brusnev group, one of the first socialist organisations in Russia. The circle organised lessons from intellectuals such as Leonid Krasin and Stepan Radchenko, read illegal literature, discussed economic issues, and studied Marxism. In 1891, Karelina set up her own circle of women weavers as part of the Brusnev group. In 1892, Karelina was arrested for participating in International Workers' Day celebrations and attending an illegal political meeting at the Volkovo Cemetery. She was sentenced to six months imprisonment at the Shpalerka prison. After being released, she moved to Kharkiv, but was imprisoned again on the same charges. She was finally released in 1894. In 1896, Karelina returned to St. Petersburg and resumed her illegal involvement in the workers movement. She participated in a weavers' strike and, as a representative of the workers' circles, became involved with Vladimir Lenin's League of Struggle for the Emancipation of the Working Class. She met Lenin on several occasions. In 1897, Karelina and her husband Aleksei Karelin moved to Vasilyevsky Island and set up a circle of print workers. The circle collaborated with the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party (RSDRP) to disseminate illegal literature and thereby became an influential part of the socialist movement in St. Petersburg.  Gapon's Assembly  Georgy Apollonovich Gapon In the early 1900s the Russian authorities, under the initiative of police administrator Sergei Zubatov, sought to combat revolutionary socialism by establishing legal, pro-government trade unions. In St. Petersburg, they supported the creation of the Assembly of Russian Factory Workers of St. Petersburg, headed by Orthodox priest Georgy Gapon. Initially, the Karelin circle saw Gapon's Assembly in a negative light, as \\"police socialism\\". However, after meeting Gapon in 1903, the Karelins came to the conclusion that he was \\"an honest man\\" and decided to cooperate with him. They saw an opportunity to use the legal Assembly to promote socialist ideas. Karelina became one of the leading figures in Gapon's organisation. On Gapon's recommendation, she was chosen as the chairwoman of the Assembly's women's section, and conducted classes and educational activities for female workers ‚Äì in keeping with the organisation's stated aim to raise awareness, organise and unite the working masses. She also became one of the Assembly's decision- makers, sitting on Gapon's \\"secret committee\\" of his most trusted workers. The secret committee discussed political issues and planned for open action by the workers. According to the memoirs of I. I. Pavlov, Karelina was second only to Gapon in her influence on the Assembly. She was the only person who dared to engage Gapon in open debate and force him to change his mind. As a result, Karelin was the de facto leader of the \\"opposition\\" to Gapon, and under her influence the Assembly, and Gapon himself, became increasingly politicized and aligned with her point of view. For his part, Gapon treated Karelina with great respect. In private, he described her as \\"a woman of extraordinary spiritual power, able to stand at the head of the female proletariat\\" (\\"\\"). The workers' procession meets the Imperial Guard on Bloody Sunday. Photograph by Karl Bulla, 1905. Karelina was involved in planning a workers' procession on 9 January 1905 ‚Äì Bloody Sunday. Her \\"opposition\\" supported adding immediate political demands to their petition, but Gapon considered this premature. The day before the march, Kerelina gave speeches to the sections of the Assembly, urging women to come to the march and share the fate of their husbands. Reportedly, she did not anticipate a peaceful outcome. In one of her speeches, she said to the women: On the morning of Bloody Sunday, Karelina and her husband led a section of the march from Vasilyevsky Island to the Winter Palace. It was fired upon and dispersed by the Imperial Guard, resulting in some 1,000 casualties and the outbreak of the 1905 Russian Revolution.  After Bloody Sunday  Gapon fled Russia shortly after Bloody Sunday and the Assembly was disbanded. Karelina continued to work underground and in October 1905 she was elected to the Saint Petersburg Soviet. She also kept in contact with Gapon, collaborating with him on his planned \\"Russian Workers' Union\\". She was one of the few people who remained dedicated to Gapon's cause after his death, and after his assassination in 1906 she spoke at his funeral, calling for revenge on his assassins. In subsequent years, Karelina participated in the cooperative movement, helping to create a \\"Labour Union\\" in 1907 (quickly shut down by the authorities) and later rural cooperatives in the district of Yamburg. She also wrote a series of essays on the early history of the labour movement.

(8 August 1727 ‚Äì 20 June 1786) was an Irish Roman Catholic priest who was appointed as Bishop of Limerick in 1778 and resigned the position in 1779 without ever being consecrated. Biography Father Butler was a member of the prominent Butler dynasty. he was related to James Butler the then Archbishop of Cashel and Metropolitan. This was a source of controversy as Father Butler was unknown in Limerick and it was thought that the Archbishop was using his position to gain an ecclesiastical office for a relative. Butler joined the Society of Jesus at Li√®ge 1745 and was ordained priest in 1753 (or 1758, sources differ). With the Suppression of the Jesuits in 1773 he moved to England where he was appointed priest in Hereford which was then in the Apostolic Vicariate of the Western District. Father Butler was very surprised to be nominated and initially refused the position. After rejecting the office Fr Butler received another letter informing him that his name had been sent to Rome for approval with the backing of three archbishops and twelve bishops, the Catholic peers of Ireland along with support from several prominent ecclesiastics and Catholic laymen from France. Approval had also been given by his own Ordinary Charles Walmesley Vicar Apostolic of the Western District. Propaganda Fide which was responsible for appointments of bishops in missionary territory initially rejected Butler's name because of his connection with the Jesuits but Pope Pius VI thought it was in the interest of the faith to appoint Butler and he overruled Propaganda Fide. Fr Butler reluctantly left his parish and went to the family home at Cahir. There he met the Archbishop and a representative of the clergy of Limerick. When the Bull of appointment arrived, however, Butler had second thoughts and he changed his mind. He wrote to the Archbishop and rejected the position. The following month he returned to Hereford where he lived out the remainder of his life.

This ceremony became known by its detractors as the farce of √Åvila and has been recorded as such in history.  Background  During the reign of Henry IV, the various factions of the nobility fought among themselves and against the king to buy up plots of power. The powerful El poderoso Marquis of Villena was unhappy with the preferential treatment by the king of his rivals, the house of Mendoza and the favourite Beltr√°n de la Cueva. The Marquis formed an alliance against the king along with the archbishops of Toledo, Seville, and Santiago, the house of Enr√≠quez, the counts of Plasencia and of Alba and other minor noblemen and clergymen.OHARA, cap. On 11 December 1464, the anti-Henry league gave an ultimatum: if the king did not rectify his behavior and get rid of his government, he would be deposed.OHARA, cap. Henry tried to negotiate, but no agreement was reached, and the king was deposed, first in Plasencia on 27 April 1465, and later in √Åvila on 5 June.SORIA  Development of the ceremony  Medieval walls of √Åvila. On a large platform visible from a distance, the conspirators erected a wooden statue representing the king, dressed in mourning clothes and with his crown, staff, and sword. Those present at the ceremony were Alfonso Carrillo archbishop of Toledo, the marquis of Villena, the count of Plasencia, the count of Benavente and other minor noblemen, as well as the general population of commoners. Also present was the prince Alfonso who had not yet reached eleven years of age.SORIA Mass was performed, and once finished, the rebels headed to the stage to read a declaration of all the charges against Henry IV. According to them, the king showed sympathy towards Muslims; was homosexual, his character was conciliatory and overcautious; and, the most serious charge, he was not the real father of princess Joanna, which meant that she was ineligible to inherit the throne.SORIA After the speech, the archbishop of Toledo removed the crown from the effigy, which was the symbol of royal dignity. Then the count of Plasencia took the sword, symbol of administration of justice, and the count of Benavente took the staff, symbol of government. Finally, Diego L√≥pez de Z√∫√±iga, brother of the count of Plasencia, tore down the statue, saying ‚ÄúTo the ground, bitch!‚Äù.SORIA Then they brought the prince Alfonso to the platform, and proclaimed him king, yelling ‚ÄúCastile, by King Alfonso!‚Äù and proceeded with the hand-kissing ceremony.SORIA  Consequences  The new king Alfonso XII was considered a puppet in the hands of marquis of Villena and was not accepted by the majority of the country, which remained loyal to Henry IV. The situation deteriorated into riots which lasted until the death of Alfonso in 1468 and the submission of his sister Isabel to the authority of Henry IV,SORIA but he did in fact rule as Alfonso XII in the three remaining years of his life after the coup, as described by the investigator √ìscar Perea, and maintained a court with an active cultural life which included several important noblement like Diego G√≥mez Manrique and his nephew Jorge, the jurist Nicol√°s de Guevara and the chansonnier poet Juan √Ålvarez Gato or historian Diego de Valera, chief steward of the king in 1467, as well as the Marquis of Villena; also Rodrigo Alfonso Pimentel, count of Benavente, and Pedro de Villandrando, count of Ribadeo, and Diego de Ribera, tutor of prince Alfonso and the person in charge of the stables, or Sancho de Rojas, lord of Cavia and Monz√≥n and chief nobleman of Castile; Mart√≠n de T√°vara; the prior of Osma, jurist and royal chaplain to Alfonso XII Francisco G√≥mez de Miranda and others. His court also included prominent singers Diego Rangel o Crist√≥bal de Morales. Don Diego G√≥mez Manrique organized festivities and composed theatrical \\"momos\\" teatrales to celebrate the royal birthday in which the court ladies played the role of fairies.Cf. √ìscar Perea Rodr√≠guez, \\"La Corte literaria de Alfonso el Inocente (1465-1468) seg√∫n las Coplas a una partida de Guevara, poeta del Cancionero General\\", en Medievalismo. Of the brilliant poets in this court was Jorge Manrique and his Verses on the death of his father:'' Later, the Marquis de Villena, his relatives and some of its allies broke with Isabel and dying Enrique in 1474, supported the Princess Juana as heiress to the throne, although not a few of the members of the Court of Alfonso XII spent the Elizabethan side and thrived on it.

Career According to the notice posted at \\"In Memoriam\\", a site maintained by the Academic Senate of the University of California,Karl Aschenbrenner \\"In Memoriam\\" Tribute Aschenbrenner was descended from Volga Germans immigrants to Kansas. Aschenbrenner was born November 20, 1911, in Bison, Rush County, in that state. His upbringing was in Portland, Oregon. He obtained his undergraduate education at Reed College (1934). He was awarded his M.A. (1938) and Ph.D. degrees (1940) at Berkeley. He served an instructor at Reed College for two years, then as a meteorologist lieutenant in the United States Naval Reserve from 1943 to 1946. He served as a flight instructor at St. Mary's College in Moraga, California (1942‚Äì1946), after which he joined the faculty of the Speech Department at the University of California at Berkeley. In 1948 he obtained his appointment as assistant professor in the Philosophy Department. \\"His teaching was mainly in aesthetics and the history of philosophy, notably the Kant course,\\" according to the \\"In Memoriam\\" notice. His principal instructor was Jacob Loewenberg, the leading Kantian at Berkeley and department chair (1935‚Äì1941) while Aschenbrenner was studying for his doctorate. Aschenbrenner was active in founding the Journal of the History of Philosophy, on whose board of directors he served for 27 years. He was the recipient of Guggenheim, Fulbright, and NEH fellowships. Aschenbrenner undertook the study of Magyar, the Hungarian language, in order to test his theories in the context of a language which was not Indo-European spoken by people of European culture. His article The Appraisive Function of Hungarian Verbs in -kodik, -kedik and ‚Äìk√∂dik (cited below) is based on his researches. The \\"In Memoriam\\" notice remarks: \\"Whereas Indo-European languages express appraisals almost entirely by the use of special vocabularies, Magyar possesses verb endings that contribute a crediting or pejorative sense to the resulting compound. Thus Magyar speakers think of some evaluative notions as modalities of descriptive concepts rather than as a distinct family.\\" Aschenbrenner served as department head on two occasions at Berkeley, first as the chairman of the Department of PhilosophyDepartment of Philosophy, University of California, Berkeley at Dwinelle Hall (1957‚Äì1962) and later as the chairman of the Department of DesignDepartment of Design, University of California, Berkeley at Wurster Hall (1964‚Äì1965); his service in the latter capacity has been documented in the Centennial Record,Centennial Record maintained by Calisphere, a service of the libraries of the University of California. Publications George Boas, in a review published in 1955 in Modern Language Notes remarks, regarding the Aschenbrenner-Holther translation of Baumgarten's Reflections on Poetry: \\"The editors, whose introduction is in many ways admirable, particularly in that it makes a reading of Baumgarten's own work superfluous.\\" Vol. 70, No. 8 at 617-618. Irving Singer, in a review published in 1955 in The Philosophical Review commented on the same work. \\"Mssrs. Aschenbrenner and Holther are to be commended for making available a work which has been neglected for many years.\\"Vol. 64, No. 1, at 154-155. Receiving favourable notice at the time of publication, with reviews in German, Dutch and Spanish journals, were Aschenbrenner's three major works in the field of analytic philosophy which should be treated as a precursor to today's computer-aided content analysis. These were Concepts of Value, (1971) Concepts of Criticism (1974) and Analysis of Appraisive Characterization (1983). Aschenbrenner's death was noted by J. Maeyaert in the Journal for Philosophy (Dutch: Tijdschrift voor Filosofie): \\"His teaching was especially devoted to the aesthetics and the history of philosophy.\\" \\"Zijn onderricht was vooral gewijd aan de esthetica en de geschiedenis van de wijsbegeerte.\\" 51ste Jaarg., Nr. 3, September 1989, at 576-596. The Tjidschrift is affiliated with the Catholic University of Louvain (Katholieke Universiteit-Leuven). Antonio Cua in Philosophy East and West referred readers to Concepts of Value: \\"For an illuminating discussion of appraisive creativity in general.\\" Philosophy East and West, Vol. 25, No. 1, The Problems of Causation: East and West (Jan., 1975) at 1-10. The journal is affiliated with the University of Hawai‚Äôi. Aschenbrenner's works appear in 113 publications and are held in the collections of 2,371 library holdings according to WorldCat Identities page; link below. Excluding translations of previously published works, Aschenbrenner's works appear in English (48), Polish (3), German (2), French (2), Spanish, Italian, Modern Greek and Romanian (1 each).

Students generally come from a variety of backgrounds including computer science, engineering, mathematics, economics, and business. University programs mandate coding proficiency in at least one language. The languages most commonly used include R, Python, SAS, and SQL. Applicants generally have technical proficiency before starting the program. Analytics concentrations in MBA programs are less technical and focus on developing working knowledge of statistical applications rather than proficiency. Business analytics (BA) refers to the skills, technologies, practices for continuous iterative exploration and investigation of past business performance to gain insight and drive business planning.[1] Business analytics focuses on developing new insights and understanding of business performance based on data and statistical methods. In contrast, business intelligence traditionally focuses on using a consistent set of metrics to both measure past performance and guide business planning, which is also based on data and statistical methods. Business analytics can be used to leverage prescriptive analytics towards automation.  Origin  The MSBA was a response to the increasing need of complex data analysis beyond traditional use of spreadsheets such as Microsoft Excel. Since 2001, the increasing volume (amount of data), velocity (speed of data in and out), and variety (range of data types and sources) has created a vacuum for talent. Harvard Business Review noted: ‚ÄúMuch of the current enthusiasm for big data focuses on technologies that make taming it possible, including Hadoop (the most widely used framework for distributed file system processing) and related open-source tools, cloud computing, and data visualization,‚Äù the article says. ‚ÄúWhile those are important breakthroughs, at least as important are the people with the skill set (and the mind-set) to put them to good use. On this front, demand has raced ahead of supply. Indeed, the shortage of data scientists is becoming a serious constraint in some sectors.‚Äù  See also  * Big Data * Machine Learning * Data Mining * Predictive Analytics * Decision Theory * ETL * Data Management * Data Warehouse * Operations research * Network science * Agile  References  Master's degrees ","title":"Master of Science in Business Analytics"},{"id":"51505984","text":"Felipe Nascimento (born 5 July 1993) is a Brazilian modern pentathlete.

Many members show novel signs of horizontal gene transfer from other domains of life. DPANN is an acronym formed by the initials of the first five groups discovered, Diapherotrites, Parvarchaeota, Aenigmarchaeota, Nanoarchaeota and Nanohaloarchaeota. Later Woesearchaeota and Pacearchaeota were discovered and proposed within the DPANN superphylum. In 2017, another phylum Altiarchaeota was placed into this superphylum. The DPANN groups together different phyla with a variety of environmental distribution and metabolism, ranging from symbiotic and thermophilic forms such as Nanoarchaeota, acidophiles like Parvarchaeota and non-extremophiles like Aenigmarchaeota and Diapherotrites. DPANN was also detected in nitrate-rich groundwater, on the water surface but not below, indicating that these taxa are still quite difficult to locate.  Classification  * Diapherotrites.

The original farmhouse as built in 1807 by Martin Rose. This house was replaced in 1827 by a two-story, Federal style brick I-house which was built by Rose's son, Matthias Rose. It had a rear ell added in 1829 and was remodeled about 1890. Also on the property were a contributing silo, summer kitchen, two barns, garage chicken coop, and tool or storage shed. Note: This includes and Accompanying photographs. It has been demolished. The property was originally part of 400 acres that was granted to Jean Baptiste St. Aubin by the U.S. Congress for his support of the American revolution. St. Aubin assigned his rights to the property to Peyton Short of Woodford County, Kentucky. Short would sell the property to Martin Rose in 1807. The farmstead grew to 800 acres when Rose bought an additional 400 acres from future U.S. President William Henry Harrison. A small fort, known as Rose's Fort, was built around one of the property's springs during the War of 1812 but it was never attacked. After the death of Rose the property passed to his son Matthias in 1828. Unfortunately, Matthias died in 1834 and the house and a portion of the property was sold to his sister Malinda and her husband, Henry K. Wise. Mr. Wise was an abolitionist and the house became a stop on the Underground Railroad. When the Wises died the property passed to their daughter Nancy and her husband Robert B. Patterson. Their son, George Martin Patterson, would later attend Vincennes University and become a founder of Sigma Pi fraternity in 1897. When George died in 1960 he left the property to his daughters Marion Beard and Martha Parks. Marion lived in the house until her death in 1988. She bequeathed the house and many of the family's belongings to the fraternity. In 1992, the Sigma Pi Educational Foundation bought the property from the fraternity and established a memorial to the Patterson family on it. The foundation planned to move its offices to the building and establish an alumni center on the property. The property could be seen from nearby Shadowwood, which served as the fraternity's headquarters from 1963 to 2003. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1995 and delisted in 2012.

Rajan and Punitha Rajan for Transindia Media & Entertainment Private Limited and directed by Mohamad Issack. The film features Aari, Ashna Zaveri, and Masoom Shankar in the lead roles, while Latha, Sithara, Kaali Venkat, Abhilash, and Athulya Ravi play important roles.It was dubbed into hindi as Nagesh theater The film was released across Tamil Nadu on 16 February 2018. Plot Nagesh alias Naga (Aari) is an honest yet unsuccessful real estate broker who lives with his mother (Sithara), younger brother (Abhilash), and sister, Lakshmi (Athulya Ravi), who is deaf and mute. Naga meets a girl named Himaja (Ashna Zaveri), and they fall in love. Things go fine for Naga and his family until there comes a situation where he has to sell his ancestral property - a dilapidated movie theater - to conduct Lakshmi's wedding. Naga and his friend Kaala (Kaali Venkat) travel to another town to sell the theater. Due to a small accommodation problem, they end up spending the night at the theater itself. Over the next few days of their stay, both Naga and Kaala experience several paranormal activities around them, and all their attempts to bring prospective buyers go futile. Naga also starts having weird dreams every night in which random people are murdered. He then wakes up to the news to find that those people are dead in real life. Confused and frustrated, he seeks help from different godmen to find out what is wrong, but nothing works out. Meanwhile, a local politician comes to know that the people being murdered mysteriously are none other than his henchmen and his close associates. He finds that there is something abnormal about all these murders and consults with a Nambudiri, who tells that a malevolent spirit from the theater is causing all this mayhem and that they have to perform an exorcism. Paranormal occurrences keep happening around Naga, and he discovers that the spirit tries to take him to a well inside the premises. Himaja also tells him about her own paranormal vision of a murder and how she felt an apparition near her while she was on video chat with Naga and he had slept off. She is not able to positively identify, since she had closed her eyes out of fear, but since Naga had recorded the video chat, he watches it, only to find that it was he who appeared in the video and realizes that he is the one behind all those murders and hence the dreams. Naga soon prepares himself to face the spirit directly and asks for answers when the spirit reveals itself to be a woman and an old acquaintance to Naga. Tamilselvi (Masoom Shankar) is a social activist who is popular on Facebook for her brutally honest articles about the wrongdoings in the society. She lives with Dr. Shakunthala (Latha), who runs a small orphanage with a few children and provides free medical services to the underprivileged. Naga was the real estate broker who helped them find a house. It so happens that a bigger orphanage lends a helping hand to Shakunthala, with the promise of taking a few kids from her orphanage and providing better education and a future. She and Tamilselvi entrust an early teen girl to them and send her off but soon receive a call from her that she and many other children have been kept hostage in a bungalow. Tamilselvi gets a ride from Naga and sets out to investigate and rescue the kids. She is horrified to find that the politician is making a deal with a foreign corporate company for exporting unlimited human blood for them to extract the blood plasma and use it for various cosmetic purposes, thereby commercializing it. The politician is making use of the orphan children's blood to achieve this target, and the local police officer is his aide. The girl from Shakunthala's orphanage is raped by the police officer, all of her blood is drawn by doctors for the plasma, and she is then killed. Tamilselvi records all of this and tries to escape with Naga's help. Naga is oblivious to all the danger that she might be in and just drops her home, but she is captured and attacked by the politician's henchmen at the abandoned theater and is thrown into the well when she is still alive and is left there to die. All the evidences that Tamilselvi collected for Facebook are destroyed, and Shakunthala is killed. Tamilselvi's spirit has been waiting for revenge since then, and when she realizes that Naga is back in the theater, she makes use of his tiny paper cut wound to possess him through blood contact, and that is how she had murdered all those men who helped the politician. Meanwhile, the politician and the Nambudiri perform an exorcism at the theater, and it is here that Naga is dismayed to learn that his brother is also a part of the politician's team as a doctor that draws all the blood. A fight ensues, and a possessed Naga tries to kill his brother and the politician but is subdued by the Nambudiri's mantras. Tamilselvi is enraged and ultimately uses blood contact again with Naga's brother's bleeding wound and possesses him instead. She makes him kill the politician and himself. Now that she is avenged, Tamiselvi's spirit leaves the theater. Naga and his family are finally able to live in peace.

The principal photography of the film started from October 6, 2016 after the photosession of the film that happened a month before. A lengthy schedule started from February 3, 2017 at Tindivanam that lasted for three weeks. Lead actor Aari's mother expired on 24 February, but he stayed to complete his entire portion as it was the final day of schedule before leaving to Pazhani for his mother's funeral. The film's first look poster was released by Tamil film directors Ameer and Karu Pazhaniappan on lead actor Aari's birthday, and the teaser of the film was released by actor Rajinikanth on 30 March 2017. Controversy On 30 June 30, 2017, actor Anand Babu filed a case in the Chennai High Court against the makers of the film seeking a ban as they did not obtain permission to use the name of his father, actor Nagesh, in the title. Nagesh had also built and run the Nagesh Theater at T. Nagar. The judges accepted the case and ordered notice to be sent to producer, director and Vishal, the chief of Tamil Film Producers Council. The plea of Anand Babu was later rejected by Madras High Court as Justice C. V. Karthikeyan permitted the producers to go ahead with the Tamil title but restrained them from using the actor name Nagesh either independently or as Nagesh Theatre. Anand Babu again filed a petition in the Madras High Court during February 2018 to stop the film from hitting the screens on the scheduled date. Since the judge found nothing objectionable nor misleading of Nagesh or Nagesh Theatre, the permission was given by court to release the film as per plan, but with the following conditions: the production company was asked to deposit 20 Lakhs in the Court, a slide carrying a message that the film has no connections with Nagesh or Nagesh Theatre had to be inserted before the title card, and such a message was to be attached or placed in all the newspaper advertisements for the film.https://www.behindwoods.com/tamil- movies-cinema-news-16/nagesh-thiraiyarangam-passes-high-court-hurdles-due-to- nagesh-reference-sued-by-ananbabu.html Soundtrack The songs are sung by Jagadeesh Kumar, Shashaa Tirupati, Anitha Karthikeyan, Gana Bala, Jithesh, Chinmayi and actress Remya Nambeesan for the music composed by Srikanth Deva for the lyrics of Thamarai, Umadevi, Murugan Manthiram and Jegan Set.

The memorial was destroyed by a German bomb during the Second World War and rebuilt in the late 1940s. One of 15 war crosses by Sir Edwin Lutyens, it is a grade II listed building. Background In the aftermath of the First World War and its unprecedented casualties, thousands of war memorials were built across Britain. Amongst the most prominent designers of memorials was the architect Sir Edwin Lutyens, described by Historic England as \\"the leading English architect of his generation\\". Lutyens designed the Cenotaph on Whitehall in London, which became the focus for the national Remembrance Sunday commemorations, as well as the Thiepval Memorial to the Missing‚Äîthe largest British war memorial anywhere in the world‚Äîand the Stone of Remembrance which appears in all large Commonwealth War Graves Commission cemeteries and in several of Lutyens's civic war memorials. The Abinger Common memorial is one of fifteen War Crosses by Lutyens, all sharing a broadly similar design. Many of Lutyens' commissions for war memorials originated with pre-war clients and friends. Although Margaret Lewin, who commissioned the Abinger common memorial, was not a previous client, it appears she was known to Lutyens as she lived close to Goddards, a country house in the village designed by Lutyens elsewhere in the village.Skelton, p. 83. History and design The original memorial was presented to the village by Margaret Lewin, a resident of Abinger Common whose son‚ÄîCharles McLean Lewin, a captain in the 4th Queen's Own Hussars‚Äîdied in 1919. It was built by the stonemasons HT Jenkins and Sons of Torquay, Devon, who were responsible for several of Lutyens' war memorials, at a cost of ¬£190, and unveiled in 1920. On 3 August 1944, during the Second World War, the memorial was struck by a German V-1 flying bomb and severely damaged, as was St James's church; the memorial was rebuilt in honour of Mrs Lewin and her daughter in 1949.Skelton, pp. 154‚Äì155. The memorial stands outside the churchyard of St James' Church, on an axis with the south porch. It consists of a Portland stone cross‚ÄîLutyens' standard War Cross design, with short arms moulded high on a tapering shaft)‚Äîwhich sits on a plinth of three stone square blocks which is itself mounted on a shallow circular base. The western face of the cross contains a sword engraved in the stone, unique among Lutyens' War Crosses and more reminiscent of the sword on the Cross of Sacrifice by Reginald Blomfield, with whom Lutyens worked with the Commonwealth War Graves Commission. It is unknown whether the sword was an original feature or one added during the reconstruction.Skelton, p. 166. The main inscription is on the east face of the plinth: The south face is inscribed \\"THE WORLD WAR / MCMXIV / MCMXIX\\" and the east \\"IN MEMORY OF THOSE WHO FELL 1914 ‚Äì 1918\\", below which are the names of the village's war dead. Abinger Common War Memorial was designated a grade II listed building on 13 March 1974. The memorial is one of a group of listed buildings around the church green, including the church itself, which is listed at grade II*. In November 2015, as part of the commemorations of the centenary of the First World War, Lutyens's war memorials were recognised as a \\"national collection\\" and all of his free- standing memorials in England were listed or had their listing status reviewed and their National Heritage List for England list entries were updated and expanded.

Cost-sharing is easy when the marginal cost is constant: in this case, each agent who wants the service just pays its marginal cost. Cost-sharing becomes more interesting when the marginal cost is not constant. With increasing marginal costs, the agents impose a negative externality on each other; with decreasing marginal costs, the agents impose a positive externality on each other (see example below). The goal of a cost- sharing mechanism is to divide this externality among the agents. There are various cost-sharing mechanisms, depending on the type of product/service and the type of cost-function.  Divisible product, increasing marginal costs  In this setting, several agents share a production technology. They have to decide how much to produce and how to share the cost of production. The technology has increasing marginal cost - the more is produced, the harder it becomes to produce more units (i.e., the cost is a convex function of the demand). An example cost-function is: * $1 per unit for the first 10 units; * $10 per unit for each additional unit. So if there are three agents whose demands are 3 and 6 and 10, then the total cost is $100. = Definitions = A cost-sharing problem is defined by the following functions, where i is an agent and Q is a quantity of the product: * Demand(i) = the amount that agent i wants to receive. * Cost(Q) = the cost of producing Q units of the product. A solution to a cost-sharing problem is defined by a payment \\\\text{Pay}(i) for every agent who is served, such that the total payment equals the total cost: ::\\\\sum_{i}\\\\text{Pay}(i) = \\\\text{Cost}\\\\big(D\\\\big); where D is the total demand: ::D := \\\\sum_{i}\\\\text{Demand}(i) Several cost-sharing solutions have been proposed. = Average cost-sharing = In the literature on cost pricing of a regulated monopoly,Yair Taumann, \\"The Aumann-Shapley prices: a survey\\", Chapter 18 in it is common to assume that each agent should pay its average cost, i.e.: ::\\\\text{Pay}(i) = \\\\text{Cost}(D) \\\\cdot \\\\text{Demand}(i)/D In the above example, the payments are 15.8 (for demand 3), 31.6 (for demand 6) and 52.6 (for demand 10). This cost-sharing method has several advantages: * It is not affected by manipulations in which two agents openly merge their demand into a single super-agent, or one agent openly splits its demand into two sub- agents. Indeed, it is the only method immune to such manipulations., Remark 2, p. 168 * It is not affected by manipulations in which two agents secretly transfer costs and products between each other. * Each agent is pays at least its stand-alone cost - the cost he would have paid without the existence of other agents. This is a measure of solidarity: no agent should make a profit from a negative externality. However, it has a disadvantage: * An agent might pay more than its unanimous cost - the cost he would have paid if all other agents had the same demand. This is a measure of fairness: no agent should suffer too much from the negative externality. In the above example, the agent with demand 3 can claim that, if all other agents were as modest as he is, there would have been no negative externality and each agent would have paid only $1 per unit, so he should not have to pay more than this. = Marginal cost-sharing = In marginal cost-sharing, the payment of each agent depends on his demand and on the marginal cost in the current production-state: ::\\\\text{Pay}(i) = \\\\text{Demand}(i)\\\\cdot \\\\text{Cost}'(D) + {1\\\\over n} \\\\big(\\\\text{Cost}(D) - D\\\\cdot Cost'(D)\\\\big) In the above example, the payments are 0 (for demand 3), 30 (for demand 6) and 70 (for demand 10). This method guarantees that an agents pays at most its unanimous cost - the cost he would have paid if all other agents had the same demand. However, an agent might pay less than its stand-alone cost. In the above example, the agent with demand 3 pays nothing (in some cases it is even possible that an agent pays negative value). = Serial cost-sharing = Serial cost-sharing can be described as the result of the following process. * At time 0, all agents enter a room. * The machine starts producing one unit per minute. * The produced unit and its cost are divided equally among all agents in the room. * Whenever an agent feels that his demand is satisfied, he exits the room. So, if the agents are ordered in ascending order of demand: * Agent 1 (with the lowest demand) pays: ::{Cost(n\\\\cdot \\\\text{Demand}(1)) \\\\over n}; * Agent 2 pays: ::{Cost(n\\\\cdot \\\\text{Demand}(1)) \\\\over n} plus {Cost(\\\\text{Demand}(1)+(n-1)\\\\text{Demand}(2)) - Cost(n\\\\cdot \\\\text{Demand}(1)) \\\\over n-1} ; and so on. This method guarantees that each agent pays at least its stand-alone cost and at most its unanimous cost. However, it is not immune to splitting or merging of agents, or to transfer of input and output between agents. Hence, it makes sense only when such transfers are impossible (for example, with cable TV or telephone services).  Binary service, decreasing marginal costs  In this setting, there is a binary service - each agent is either served or is not served. The cost of the service is higher when more agents are served, but the marginal cost is smaller than when serving each agent individually (i.e., the cost is a submodular set function). As a typical example, consider two agents, Alice and George, who live near a water-source, with the following distances: * Source- Alice: 8 km * Source-George: 7 km * Alice-George: 2 km Suppose that each kilometer of water-pipe costs $1000. We have the following options: * Nobody is connected; the cost is 0. * Only George is connected; the cost is $7000. * Only Alice is connected; the cost is $8000. * Both Alice and George are connected; the cost is $9000, since the pipe can go from Source to George and then to Alice. Note that it is much cheaper than the sum of the costs of George and Alice. The choice between these four options should depend on the valuations of the agents - how much each of them is willing to pay for being connected to the water-source. The goal is to find a truthful mechanism that will induce the agents to reveal their true willingness-to-pay. = Definitions = A cost-sharing problem is defined by the following functions, where i is an agent and S is a subset of agents: * Value(i) = the amount that agent i is willing to pay in order to enjoy the service. * Cost(S) = the cost of serving all and only the agents in S. E.g., in the above example Cost({Alice,George})=9000. A solution to a cost-sharing problem is defined by: * A subset S of agents who should be served; * A payment \\\\text{Pay}(i) for every agent who is served. A solution can be characterized by: * The budget surplus of a solution is the total payment minus the total cost: Surplus := \\\\sum_{i\\\\in S} \\\\text{Pay}(i) - \\\\text{Cost}(S). We would like to have budget balance, which means that the surplus should be exactly 0. * The social welfare of a solution is the total utility minus the total cost: Welfare := \\\\sum_{i\\\\in S} \\\\text{Value}(i) - \\\\text{Cost}(S). We would like to have efficiency, which means that the social welfare is maximized. It is impossible to attain truthfulness, budget-balance and efficiency simultaneously; therefore, there are two classes of truthful mechanisms: = Tatonement mechanisms - budget-balanced but not efficient = A budget-balanced cost- sharing mechanism can be defined by a function Payment(i,S) - the payment that agent i has to pay when the subset of served agents is S. This function should satisfy the following two properties: * budget-balance: the total payment by any subset equals the total cost of serving this subset: \\\\forall S: \\\\sum_{i\\\\in S}\\\\text{Payment}(i,S) = \\\\text{Cost}(S). So if a single agent is served, he must pay all his cost, but if two or more agents are served, each of them may pay less than his individual cost because of the submodularity. * population monotonicity: the payment of an agent weakly increases when the subset of served agents shrinks: T\\\\supseteq S \\\\implies \\\\text{Payment}(i,T)\\\\leq \\\\text{Payment}(i,S). For any such function, a cost-sharing problem with submodular costs can be solved by the following tatonnement process: # Initially, let S be the set of all agents. # Tell each agent i that he should pay Payment(i,S). # Each agent who is not willing to pay his price, leaves S. # If any agent has left S, return to step 2. # Otherwise, finish and server the agents that remain in S. Note that, by the population-monotonicity property, the price always increases when people leave S. Therefore, an agent will never want to return to S, so the mechanism is truthful (the process is similar to an English auction). In addition to truthfulness, the mechanism has the following merits: * Group strategyproofness - no group of agents can gain by reporting untruthfully. * No positive transfers - no agent is paid money in order to be served. * Individual rationality - no agent loses value from participation (in particular, a non-served agent pays nothing and a served agent pays at most his valuation). * Consumer sovereignty - every agent can choose to get service, if his willingness-to-pay is sufficiently large. Moreover, any mechanism satisfying budget-balance, no-positive-transfers, individual-rationality, consumer-sovereignty and group-strategyproofness can be derived in this way using an appropriate Payment function. The mechanism can select the Payment function in order to attain such goals as fairness or efficiency. When agents have equal apriori rights, some reasonable payment functions are: * The Shapley value, e.g., for two agents, the payments when both agents are served are: Payment(Alice,Both) = [Cost(Both)+Cost(Alice)-Cost(George)]/2, Payment(George,Both) = [Cost(Both)+Cost(George)-Cost(Alice)]/2. * The egalitarian solution, e.g. Payment(Alice,Both) = median[Cost(Alice), Cost(Both)/2, Cost(Both)-Cost(George)], Payment(George,Both) = median[Cost(George), Cost(Both)/2, Cost(Both)-Cost(Alice)]. * When agents have different rights (e.g. some agents are more senior than others), it is possible to charge the most senior agent only his marginal cost, e.g. if George is more senior, then for every subset S which does not contain George: Payment(George,S+George) = Cost(S+George)‚àíCost(S). Similarly, the next-most-senior agent can pay his marginal remaining cost, and so on. The above cost-sharing mechanisms are not efficient - they do not always select the allocation with the highest social welfare. But, when the payment function is selected to be the Shapley value, the loss of welfare is minimized. = VCG mechanisms - efficient but not budget-balanced = A different class of cost-sharing mechanisms are the VCG mechanisms. A VCG mechanism always selects the socially-optimal allocation - the allocation that maximizes the total utility of the served agents minus the cost of serving them. Then, each agent receives the welfare of the other agents, and pays an amount that depends only on the valuations of the other agents. Moreover, all VCG mechanisms satisfy the consumer-sovereignty property. There is a single VCG mechanism which also satisfies the requirements of no-positive-transfers and individual-rationality - it is the Marginal Cost Pricing mechanism. This is a special VCG mechanism in which each non-served agent pays nothing, and each served agent pays: :Pay(i) = Value(i) - [Welfare(All)-Welfare(All\\\\setminus \\\\\\\\{i\\\\\\\\})] I.e, each agent pays his value, but gets back the welfare that is added by his presence. Thus, the interests of the agent are aligned with the interests of society (maximizing the social welfare) so the mechanism is truthful. The problem with this mechanism is that it is not budget-balanced - it runs a deficit. Consider the above water-pipe example, and suppose both Alice and George value the service as $10000. When only Alice is served, the welfare is 10000-8000=2000; when only George is served; the welfare is 10000-7000=3000; when both are served, the welfare is 10000+10000-9000=11000. Therefore, the Marginal Cost Pricing mechanism selects to serve both agents. George pays 10000-(11000-2000)=1000 and Alice pays 10000-(11000-3000)=2000.

The incidents were reported in the United States, Canada, and subsequently in other countries and territories from August 2016. The sightings were first reported in Green Bay, Wisconsin in what turned out to be a marketing stunt for a horror film. The phenomenon later spread to many other cities in the US, most notably South Carolina where a 9-year-old boy told his mother that two suspicious males dressed as clowns tried to lure him into the nearby woods. By mid-October 2016, clown sightings and attacks had been reported in nearly all U.S. states, 9 out of 13 provinces and territories of Canada, and 18 other countries. Prior to the spate of incidents in 2016, numerous sightings of people dressed as clowns in odd or incongruous settings have occurred throughout the world since 2013. The proliferation of videos and images of these precursor sightings spread through social media posts and viral sharing of the content, most notably from DM Pranks, an Italian YouTube channel. Scope, timeline and effects of sightings =Precursor sightings= One possible precursor event was the 2013 sightings of a \\"creepy clown\\" in Northampton, England. The Northampton clown sightings, which were in the town during September and October 2013, were the work of three local filmmakers Alex Powell, Elliot Simpson, and Luke Ubanski. The clown shared similar looks to Pennywise the Dancing Clown from Stephen King's book It. The trio started a Facebook page for the so-called \\"Northampton clown\\" and were using the appearances to drive traffic to the page. In March 2014, Matteo Moroni from Perugia, Italy, owner of the YouTube channel DM Pranks, began dressing up as an evil clown and terrifying unsuspecting passersby, with his videos racking up hundreds of millions of views. A rash of sightings appeared in California, USA in October 2014, which centered around the \\"Wasco clown\\", and primarily occurred in the Wasco, California area with photos appearing on social media. A person in clown attire was spotted in a cemetery in Chicago, Illinois in July 2015. This occurrence involved two residents who spotted the \\"creepy clown\\" scaling the gate at the Rosehill Cemetery late at night.

He previously played college football for the Alabama Crimson Tide and the Arizona State Sun Devils football team. Early years Barnett attended Santiago High School in Corona, California. He played football for Santiago High School and was rated as a five-star recruit and was ranked among the top players in his class. He committed to the University of Alabama to play college football under head coach Nick Saban. Within his high school years Barnett was able to throw for almost 6,000 yards (5921) on 419 passes, and he able to lead the Santiago Sharks to round 2 of the CIF playoffs where they faced Upland high. Sadly Barnett and the Sharks came up short losing 29-30, which is a tough way to end your high school career. College career Barnett redshirted his first year at Alabama in 2015. Barnett entered his redshirt freshman season in 2016 as Alabama's starting quarterback, but lost the job to true freshman Jalen Hurts before halftime of the opening game against the USC Trojans. On September 28, 2016, AL.com‚Äôs Matt Zenitz reported that Barnett had left the team and had decided to transfer from the University of Alabama. On December 5, 2016, Barnett announced that he was transferring to Arizona State University. After leaving Alabama and prior to transferring to Arizona State, Barnett immediately enrolled at Palomar College, which made him eligible to play for Arizona State in 2017. However, he was expected to be ineligible for the first four games of the 2017 season because he transferred from Alabama after four games into the 2016 season. Barnett appealed to the NCAA for immediate eligibility and on January 31, 2017, the NCAA ruled in favor of Barnett. After being cleared to play immediately by the NCAA, Barnett was expected to be a strong contender to start right away at Arizona State, but incumbent starter Manny Wilkins won the quarterback derby and held onto his starting job. Barnett attempted only five passes during the 2017 season as the backup quarterback. In 2018, under new head coach Herm Edwards, Barnett was spending most sessions during the spring battling Dillon Sterling-Cole for the backup quarterback job behind Wilkins. On April 25, 2018, it was reported that Barnett intended to transfer from Arizona State. Barnett reportedly informed Arizona State his intention to transfer soon after the Arizona State spring game held on April 13. On May 8, 2018, it was reported that Barnett was transferring to the University of South Florida. On May 18, 2018, USF announced the addition of Barnett as a graduate transfer.

It retells William Shakespeare's play Hamlet from the point of view of an unborn child, and is set in 2015. Origins Interviewing McEwan for The Wall Street Journal, Michael W. Miller explained: \\"The idea for the extremely unusual narrator of Ian McEwan‚Äôs new novel Nutshell first came to him while he was chatting with his pregnant daughter-in-law. 'We were talking about the baby, and I was very much aware of the baby as a presence in the room,' he recalls. He jotted down a few notes, and soon afterward, daydreaming in a long meeting, the first sentence of the novel popped into his head: 'So here I am, upside down in a woman.'\\" Critical reception Nutshell received generally positive reviews from book critics. Book Marks, the review aggregator of Literary Hub, assigned the book an average grade of B+. In The Guardian, Kate Clanchy began by admitting: \\"This may not sound like an entirely promising read: a talking foetus could be an unconvincing or at least tiresomely limited narrator, and updatings of Shakespeare often strain at their own seams. From the start, though, McEwan manages to establish both the groggy, gripping parameters of the uterus ‚Äì 'My limbs are folded hard across my chest, my head is wedged into my only exit. I wear my mother like a tight- fitting cap' ‚Äì and that this foetus, Hamlet-style, is 'king of infinite space'\\". She found the book‚Äôs retelling of Hamlet to have \\"a strong forward momentum\\" and to be not only a \\"brutally effective\\" thriller, \\"but many other sorts of book too\\". Despite finding some faults with the novel's social satire, characterisation, and portrayal of contemporary life, she concluded that \\"[‚Ä¶] the architecture wins. This book is organised so thoroughly, in its plot, characters and themes, around the central image of the foetus suspended in the churnings of gravity and time [‚Ä¶]. Like TS Eliot's \\"Marina\\", also a riff on Shakespeare, it is a consciously late, deliberately elegiac, masterpiece, a calling together of everything McEwan has learned and knows about his art.\\" Also writing for The Guardian, Tim Adams noted: \\"There have been plenty of novels inspired by Hamlet ‚Äì Iris Murdoch's The Black Prince, John Updike's Gertrude and Claudius, even David Foster Wallace's Infinite Jest. And there have been one or two novels told in the voice of foetuses in the womb ‚Äì Carlos Fuentes's Christopher Unborn, for example. But Ian McEwan's virtuoso entertainment is almost certainly the first to combine the two.\\" He added, \\"Biology was always Hamlet's destiny ‚Äì 'The time is out of joint. Oh cursed spite, that ever I was born to set it right'‚Äì but never has it seemed quite so graphically chromosomal.\\" Adams found the book to be \\"both alive with wild and whirling wordplay and capable of all sorts of antic dispositions\\" but warned that \\"As with all novels based on self-consciously clever conceits, the danger is always self-consciously clever conceit\\". For the Financial Times's Christopher Tayler judged that \\"The central gimmick, however, is that the novel is narrated from inside the Gertrude-figure‚Äôs womb by her nearly due and highly loquacious son. [‚Ä¶ A]nd what follows is clearly generated by the technical challenges implicit in the opening sentence, rather than a story that McEwan urgently needs to tell.‚Äù He decided that \\"Interspersed throughout the text are extended soliloquies on the general theme of 'the time is out of joint'. Global warming, the erosion of Enlightenment values, the rise of competing nationalisms: the narrator has heard about all these, and more, thanks to Trudy‚Äôs love of the World Service. [‚Ä¶] As you‚Äôd expect, these musings are fitted into McEwan‚Äôs now-standard dramatic opposition between muddled artiness and cold rationality, and injected with a dose of irony. But there‚Äôs no mistaking Nutshell for a young man‚Äôs novel.‚Äù Whilst judging McEwan to be \\"a master of suspense to just about keep a reader wondering how he‚Äôs going to resolve the new book‚Äôs murder plot without doing too much violence to his source material\\", Tayler concluded that \\"[‚Ä¶] the high-wire act doesn‚Äôt really come off. McEwan‚Äôs usual strengths ‚Äî imaginative precision, narrative placement and control of story dynamics ‚Äî can make even slim works like On Chesil Beach (2007) oddly resonant. Nutshell relies instead on pure voice and quickly collapses into a mishmash of pentameter-ridden sentences and half- baked wordplay.\\" John Boyne writing in The Irish Times judged Nutshell to be McEwan's \\"most intriguing book since that novella [On Chesil Beach], recalling the darker short stories of his early career, the illicit family relationships that make up The Cement Garden, and the complex and deceitful relationships between men and women that lie at the heart of The Comfort of Strangers.\\" References 2016 British novels Novels by Ian McEwan Novels based on plays Works based on Hamlet Jonathan Cape books Fiction set in 2015 Novels set in London ","title":"Nutshell (novel)"},{"id":"51506481","text":"Najima Parveen (born 20 December 1990) is a Pakistani sprinter.

Under different administrative rules, Yapese culture has been influenced by Spanish, Japanese, German, and American cultures. Aspects of traditional Yapese culture are still important in modern Yapese culture. History Yapese man, c. 1873 Before coming into contact with Europeans, the Yapese people were familiar with surrounding island groups. Yapese sailors traveled to Palau to quarry stones. Carolinian sailors visited Yap during times of crises. Spanish and German traders colonized Yap in 1885 and started converting the people to Christianity. The Japanese navy took control of Yap in 1914. After World War II, Yap became a part of the United States Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands. In 1978, Yap became a district in the Federated States of Micronesia. Today, traditional Yapese culture is taught in elementary and junior high schools in the course \\"Practical Art/Culture\\". A survey conducted in 2010 showed significant interest in preserving and handing down traditional Yapese culture. =Demographics= Before World War II, Yap faced critical depopulation from contact with European diseases and cultural abortion. Antibiotics introduced after World War II caused a population explosion. A 1994 census of Yap found that 48.1% of the people on Yap identified as Yapese. A 2000 census found that number changed to 49.1%. A 2010 survey reported that 5.7% of the population of the Federated States of Micronesia (FSM) were Yapese. A 2012 survey of Micronesians outside the FSM that there were 258 Yapese in the Northern Mariana Islands, 412 in Guam, 72 in Hawaii, and 865 in the contiguous United States. Entertainment Yapese music has been influenced by Spanish, German, Japanese, and American culture. The introduction of missionaries and new musical styles have shifted Yapese musical styles. Yapese traditional dance (churu‚Äô) is very formal and ritualistic. A Yapese dance is performed in a group and accompanied by instruments and chanting. The dance movements and chanting generally tell a story. Dances are often performed on special occasions such as Yap Day or during ritual exchanges (guyuwol). Traditional Yapese clothing is often worn during dances. Clothing Traditional clothing on the main island of Yap includes loincloths and hibiscus fiber for the men and grass skirts for the women. This clothing is popular in remote villages and during festivals. Modern clothing is slowly replacing traditional clothing on these islands. Personal and family life =Households and land= Tabinaw is most commonly the Yapese household, which is generally composed of one's nuclear family. Each nuclear family generally has its own house and land. A long log divides the house into two sections; the back side (tabgul) is reserved for the father, and the front side (to‚Äôor) is open to any member of the family. Traditional households have cookhouses for different members of one's family, while modern households have a shared family cookhouse. Yapese houses are made out of lumber, corrugated metal, and concrete. A Yapese estate includes several households living on land owned by a single house site. Men can join an estate by having their patrilineal name selected from a pool of ancestral names. Women can belong to the estate they were born on, or they can belong to the estate of their husband. Land is generally passed down from father to son or from older brother to younger brother. If a family does not have any sons, the oldest daughter can inherit the land. This land is separated by matrilineal kinship. Individuals and groups who have to rely on other people's lands are part of the serf caste. =Politics= A patriclan is a political and economic unit while a patrilineage is a social unit of kinsmen. Yapese clans or sibs (genung) are totemic and claim mythical ancestry and a mythical place of origin. Sib members are instructed not to eat the living counterpart of their mythical ancestress. Sibs are exogamous and consider each other as brothers and sisters. Each sib has a chief, and each village has a head chief who acts for all his sib mates. The village chief voices group consensus. Traditional villages have a council of elders which maintains social control through judicial means. =Kinship= David M. Schneider recorded Yapese belief on conception in the 1960s. He found that the Yapese did not view human pregnancy as a result of copulation, but rather as a bestowal from one's ancestors for good behavior. Support for this idea came from the observation that promiscuous Yapese women did become pregnant. Thomas Helmig disputed Schneider's conclusions regarding the link between coitus and pregnancy on Yap. Helmig cites Wilhelm M√ºller-Wismar's ethnographic research indicated that the Yapese concept of fatherhood began prenatally, much like their concept of motherhood. Strong sexual taboos on Yap prohibit incest, which is viewed as one of the worst offences one can commit. Those who commit incest are likened to animals or cannibals. Food and agriculture Yapese use local foods to express cultural values. Local foods bind the land and people together. Common food grown in Yap include taro, yams, breadfruit, bananas, and reef fish. Traditional agricultural systems on Yap include gardens, shifting cultivation, taro systems, and animal husbandry. Chewing betel nut, drinking palm wine, and consuming commercial alcohol are popular social activities on Yap. The United States gave large subsidies to Micronesia in the 20th century, creating a decline in local food production on Yap. Imported foods such as white rice, canned meat, and frozen meat became more popular. Men generally work as fishermen while women generally work as farmers in taro patches. The protein from the men's work (thumag) and the starch from the women's work (ggaan) complement each other in the Yapese meal. Imported foods are generally adapted within this classification system; for example, canned meats are considered thumag and rice is considered ggaan. Eating classes on Yap are composed of male non-serfs who eat together. New members of these eating classes must undergo an initiation ritual (dowach). Food is separately prepared for the men, the women and children, and the menstruating daughters. Boys over the age of ten live and eat in the village's young men's house and menstruating girls have to eat in a separate house. In the main house, older males eat separately from the women and younger children.

He was a mentor to the eminent subtitler Natsuko Toda.  Career  Shunji Shimizu is said to have inaugurated film subtitling proper in Japan. The first subtitled film in Japan was Josef von Sternberg's 1930 film Morocco. It came out in Japan in 1931 and was subtitled by Yukihiko Tamura. The film's success was so great that Paramount decided greatly to expand its distribution of films to Japan, but Tamura was not able to leave Japan. He introduced Shunji Shimizu to Paramount Pictures, which whom he went on to have a long working relationship. One scholar suggests that \\"Shimizu‚Äôs work with Paramount marks the start of film translation proper in Japan and he is considered by many to be the first true film subtitling craftsman [...]\\". He was Paramount's subtitler for the Japanese market, with responsibility for preparing Paramount newsreels for distribution in Japan in the late 1930s and early 1940s, until American films were banned in Japan.

It was designed by Edinburgh architect James Campbell Walker who also designed the nearby Dunfermline City Chambers. Andrew Carnegie donated ¬£8000 to building and stocking what would be the first of over 2,500 Carnegie Libraries. The library was made a Category B listed building in 1971. History In 1879, Andrew Carnegie put plans in place to fund a new library for his birthplace, Dunfermline, Scotland. Building plans were prepared by James Campbell Walker in 1880, and on 27 July 1881 the foundation stone was laid by Carnegie's mother, Margaret Carnegie. The opening of the library in 1883 was regarded as the most significant local event of the year and a public holiday was declared. The facilities included a library room, ladies' and gentlemen's reading rooms, a recreation room, a smoking room, and a flat for the librarian. The first librarian was Alexander Peebles, an Edinburgh bookbinder who was selected for the role from 250 applicants. The library proved to be a success however it was soon found to be too small, and the layout was unsuitable. To address these problems the newly formed Carnegie Dunfermline Trust took joint control of the library with the town council, and in 1904 began an extension, designed by James Shearer, which would more than doubled the size of the original building. As a result of the First World War the extension was not completed until 1922. After the extension was completed, full control of the library returned to the town council, with the Dunfermline Carnegie Trust contributing ¬£400 a year to the library until 1958. Another extension was added to the south of the building and was opened on 2 March 1993 which provided the library with new meeting and exhibition rooms, children and music libraries and a local history room. In November 2017, the library was awarded the RIAS Andrew Doolan Best Building in Scotland Award. Archaeology An archaeology dig called Dig Dunfermline took place over six weeks in August and September 2013 on the site of what is now Dunfermline's new museum and art gallery which connects to the library. There were several finds including a tile from a smokeless stove possibly from the 16th century, the foundations of a medieval building and leather fragments. Museum and art gallery In spring 2014, the Dunfermline Carnegie Library was closed as part of the museum and art gallery project. The project was planned to take place over two years and cost ¬£10.8 million with the library reopening in summer 2016. This was extended to spring 2017 and the cost rose to ¬£12.4 million. It was designed by Scottish architect Richard Murphy and includes a museum spanning over two floors, a local studies centre, three exhibition galleries, a children's library and a cafe. The museum and art gallery opened on 18 May 2017.
