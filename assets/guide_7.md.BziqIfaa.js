Lambton resigned from Parliament and ministerial office in 1973. Biography Lambton was born in Compton, Sussex, the second son of Diana Mary (n√©e Farquhar) and John Lambton, 5th Earl of Durham. He grew up on the family estates centred on Lambton Castle near Washington in County Durham, actually living at the nearby Biddick Hall. He was educated at Harrow School and served in the Hampshire Regiment during the Second World War, before being invalided out. He then did war work in a Wallsend factory. Marriage and children Lambton married Belinda (Bindy) Blew-Jones (born 23 December 1921, died 13 February 2003) on 10 August 1942. She was the daughter of Douglas Holden Blew-Jones and his wife Violet Hilda Margaret Birkin, sister of Freda Dudley Ward.Durham, Earl of (UK, 1833), cracroftspeerage.co.uk, accessed 2 January 2016 They had five daughters and one son: * Lady Lucinda Lambton (born 10 May 1943) * Lady Beatrix Mary Lambton (born 23 July 1949) * Lady Rose Diana Lambton (born 26 November 1952) * Lady Anne Mary Gabrielle Lambton (born 4 July 1954) * Lady Isabella Lambton (born 17 May 1958), married to Sir Philip Naylor-Leyland, 4th Baronet * Edward Richard Lambton, 7th Earl of Durham (born 19 October 1961) Politics =Member of Parliament= Lambton first stood for Parliament at the 1945 general election in the safe Labour seat of Chester-le-Street, then Bishop Auckland in 1950. He was elected to Durham City Council and to Durham County Council in 1947, serving for two years. He was elected Member of Parliament for Berwick-upon-Tweed in 1951 where he served until 1973. =Under-Secretary of State= Lambton was made a Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Defence (RAF) in 1970. He succeeded to the Earldom of Durham upon his father's death on 4 February 1970 but disclaimed it on 23 February to continue as an MP and Government Minister. He nonetheless insisted on being addressed as \\"Lord Lambton\\", the form of address appropriate to his former courtesy title, though a ruling of the Committee for Privileges said that he should not do so in the House of Commons since he had renounced his peerage. Contradictory rulings from two Speakers, Horace King and Selwyn Lloyd, then left the point unresolved. =Resignation= In 1973, Lambton's liaisons with prostitutes were revealed in the Sunday tabloid The News of the World. The husband of one of the prostitutes, Norma Levy, had secretly taken photographs of Lambton in bed with Levy and had attempted to sell the photographs to Fleet Street tabloids. As well, a police search of Lambton's home found a small amount of cannabis. On 22 May, Lambton resigned from both his office and Parliament, which caused a by-election for his seat which was won by Alan Beith for the Liberal Party. Shortly after, the name Jellicoe emerged in connection to a rendezvous for one of Norma's girls at a Somers Town mansion block which had been named Jellicoe House, after the earl's kinsman Basil Jellicoe (1899‚Äì1935), the housing reformer and priest from Magdalen College (Oxford). There was a confusion and Lord Jellicoe, the Lord Privy Seal and Leader of the House of Lords, admitted 'casual affairs' with prostitutes from a Mayfair escort agency but denied knowing Norma Levy. A security inquiry on the prostitution scandal concluded that there had been \\"nothing in (Lambton's) conduct to suggest that the risk of indiscretions on these occasions was other than negligible.\\" Lambton stated that he had never taken his red state boxes of government documents with him when he visited Norma Levy. The security inquiry was held due to fears that the prostitution scandal may have involved an actual or potential breach of national security (as had occurred in the Profumo scandal in the 1960s). When Lambton was interviewed by MI5 officer Charles Elwell, Lambton first claimed that the pressure of his job as a minister was what drove him to procure the prostitutes. Later, Lambton stated that his sense of \\"the futility of the job\\" and lack of demanding tasks as a junior minister were reasons he went to prostitutes. Finally, Lambton claimed that his judgment was faulty when he went to the prostitutes due to his obsession with the battle over the use of an aristocratic title that had been used by his father; Lambton claimed that he sought to soothe this obsession by engaging in frantic activities such as gardening and debauchery. Later years For the last three decades of his life, Lambton spent his energies restoring Villa Cetinale in Tuscany After Dark (right) Following the scandal, Lambton retired, separated from his wife and bought Villa Cetinale, a 17th-century villa in Tuscany, where he lived with Claire Ward, n√©e Baring, mother of actress Rachel Ward and daughter of the cricketer Giles Baring.Anonymous.

As Fiji's First Lady, Adi Lala took on a diplomatic role, frequently representing her country abroad. She was regarded as a formidable and astute woman, whose influence on her husband was said to be considerable.  Family background  From her father George Tuisawau, she inherited the title of Roko Tui Dreketi, the traditional title of the rulers of the Burebasaga Confederacy, which covers the provinces of Rewa, Nadroga-Navosa, Namosi, Serua, Kadavu (off the southern coast of Viti Levu), and parts of Ba and Ra. Her mother, Adi Asenaca Vosailagi, was from the chiefly Ka Levu clan of Nadroga, where she was a chief in her own right. The village of Lomanikoro in Rewa Province is the capital of the confederacy. Adi Lala's marriage, on 9 September 1950, to Ratu Mara, who was to become the Tui Lau and Tui Nayau (the traditional ruler of the Lau Islands) was considered a dynastic marriage, as it united two powerful feudal families. Relations between the families had been strained in the past, so the marriage was opposed in certain quarters, especially on Ratu Mara's side. Nevertheless, the marriage was by all accounts a happy one and lasted 54 years, until Ratu Mara's death on 18 April 2004. The duration of this marriage was in stark contrast to the prevalence of divorce in much of the Mara clan. Three sons and five daughters issued from their marriage, two of whom have pursued political careers of their own. Their eldest son, Ratu Finau Mara, served as a member of the House of Representatives and of the Cabinet throughout the 1990s, and led the Fijian Association Party from 1996 to 1998. Their second daughter, Adi Koila Mara Nailatikau, was elected to the House of Representatives in 1999 and was Minister of Tourism in 1999 and 2000. She was a Senator from 2001 to 2006, and has been First Lady since 2009, being married to the President, Ratu Epeli Nailatikau.  Political career  In 1991, Adi Lala founded the Soqosoqo ni Vakavulewa ni Taukei (Soqosoqo ni Vakavulewa ni Taukei, or SVT) as the successor to the disbanded Alliance Party that her husband had founded and led, but for the leadership she was outmanoeuvred by Sitiveni Rabuka, who had led the Fiji coups of 1987. To the end of her life, Adi Lala remained active in the Great Council of Chiefs, where she was regarded as a voice of moderation. On 12 November 2003, Radio New Zealand reported that Adi Lala had bitterly accused some chiefs, whom she did not name, of having been involved in the coup d'√©tat which deposed her husband from the presidency in May 2000 and also toppled the elected government. Opening a meeting of the Great Council of Chiefs, she said that the perpetrators of the coup were \\"false prophets\\" motivated by greed, who were inciting racial strife and uncertainty with their threats, and that the coups had brought Fiji to its knees. She called on her fellow-chiefs to re-examine their roles, especially in regard to promoting racial harmony in a multicultural nation. She said some chiefs had also been involved in the earlier coups of 1987.  Controversies following her death  Ro Lala's death, only three months after that of her husband, was announced in Suva on 20 July 2004. No immediate cause of death was given. Allegations were subsequently made in Parliament, however, that she had suffered a fatal heart attack after hearing the distressing news that her son-in-law, Ratu Epeli Ganilau, was to be dismissed as Chairman of the Great Council of Chiefs, which was \\"the last straw\\" after her husband's death three months earlier. Senator James Ah Koy claimed on the floor of the Senate to have received the information from sources close to Adi Lala's family, and charged the Qarase government with responsibility for her death because of its involvement in Ganilau's sacking. His comments drew a strong rebuke from the Chairman of the Kadavu Provincial Council, which Ah Koy represented in the Senate. Ratu Joe Nawalowalo called his speech \\"gutter material\\" which \\"belittled\\" the close relationship Adi Lala had enjoyed with the province.  Statue proposed  Adi Lala was succeeded as Roko Tui Dreketi by her younger sister, Ro Teimumu Vuikaba Kepa, who also served as Minister for Education in the Qarase government from 2000 to 2006. The women's organisation Soqosoqo Vakamarama i Taukei announced on 21 July 2005, the day after the first anniversary of Adi Lala's death, that it was setting up a foundation that would help build a statue of the late Adi Lala, who was the founder of the Soqosoqo Vakamarama and its president until her death. The period of mourning for Adi Lala ended on 20‚Äì21 September 2005, with a ceremony at the chiefly village of Cuvu in Nadroga, where her mother was from. Attended by large delegations of chiefs and commoners from the Kubuna and Tovata as well as her own Burebasaga Confederacy, the ceremonies included the presentation of more than two container-loads of gifts including tabua (whales' teeth), masi (tapa cloth), canoes, mats, and lavish quantities of food, and culminated in a feast. Earlier, Ro Epeli Mataitini, the Younger brother of the official Vunivalu (a Chiefs Right Hand) for the Roko Tui Dreketi, had spoken of the love and respect that Fijians had for Adi Lala. While humans planned their future, he said, God always had the final say in people's lives, which was why it was so important to appreciate and maintain the links that bound Fiji's chiefly clans together. He called on younger Fijians to learn from the older chiefs who, despite political differences, cherished their links to the different tribes that make up the nation. 1931 births 2004 deaths Fijian chiefs Roko Tui Dreketi First Ladies of Fiji Fijian Roman Catholics Politicians from Lomanikoro ","title":"Lala Mara"},{"id":"598104","text":"Dubingiai () is a town in Molƒótai district in Lithuania.

Many famous members of Radziwi≈Ç≈Ç family were burned and are buried in the churchyard of Dubingiai castle. In the 17th century weave and paper manufactures were established in the town. In the 17th century - 18th century the town was slowly re-converted to Catholicism. Within the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, Dubingiai belonged to Vilnius Voivodeship. It was annexed by the Russian Empire after the Third Partition of Poland in 1795 and became a part of Vilna Governorate.

He is also believed to have been an actor who specialized in clown roles. He was connected with sixteen plays intended for Philip Henslowe's Rose Theatre, in partnership with other playwrights who also produced copy for Henslowe. While mentioned as a dramatist by Francis Meres in 1598, most existing information on his dramatic career is derived from Henslowe's papers. Since the name is common, it is not certain that the Robert Wilson who worked for Henslowe in 1598-1600 is the same man who was a prominent actor and occasional playwright in the 1580s; yet many scholars consider it more likely than not that the records refer to one Robert Wilson and not two. If this is correct, Wilson was acting with Leicester's Men in the 1570s, and was praised along with Richard Tarlton for his \\"wit.\\" He is generally accepted as the author of The Three Ladies of London (published 1584), The Three Lords and Three Ladies of London (published 1590), and The Cobbler's Prophecy (published 1594). It has been speculated that he may also have written Fair Em (c. 1590). In Palladis Tamia (1598), Francis Meres mentions Wilson along with Tarlton, and specifically connects Wilson with the Swan Theatre, which was built c. 1595. In just over two years, from spring 1598 to summer 1600, Wilson worked with other members of Henslowe's stable of house playwrights on sixteen different plays, including three two-part projects. Several of these were never completed. # Earl Goodwin and his Three Sons, Parts 1 and 2, with Michael Drayton, Henry Chettle, and Thomas Dekker; March 1598. # Piers of Exton, with Drayton, Chettle, and Dekker; March 1598. # Black Bateman of the North, Parts 1 and 2, with Chettle; Part I with Dekker and Drayton also; May‚ÄìJune 1598. # The Funeral of Richard Cordelion, with Chettle, Drayton, and Anthony Munday; June 1598. # The Madman's Morris, with Dekker and Drayton, July 1598. # Hannibal and Hermes, with Dekker and Drayton, July 1598. # Pierce of Winchester, with Dekker and Drayton, July‚ÄìAugust 1598. # Catiline's Conspiracy, with Chettle; August 1598. Apparently never completed. # Chance Medley, with Munday, Drayton, and Dekker or Chettle; August 1598. # Sir John Oldcastle, Parts 1 and 2, with Drayton, Munday, and Richard Hathwaye; Oct.-Dec. 1599. # Henry Richmond, Part 2, with others; never completed. # Owen Tudor, with Drayton, Hathwaye, and Munday; Jan. 1600. Apparently never completed. # Fair Constance of Rome, Part 1, with Dekker, Drayton, Hathwaye, and Munday; June 1600. Of Wilson's collaborations for Henslowe, only the first part of Sir John Oldcastle was published, in 1600 and 1619. None of the other plays has survived. Sir John Oldcastle was commissioned as a counterblast to the negative depiction of title character in the original versions of William Shakespeare's plays Henry IV, Part 1 and Henry IV, Part 2. Objections from descendants of the historical John Oldcastle, a Protestant martyr, appears to have been responsible both for the writing of the corrective Oldcastle play and the alteration of Oldcastle to Sir John Falstaff in later versions of the Henry IV plays. Also, Wilson has been proposed as a possible author of several anonymous Elizabethan plays, including Fair Em, The Pedlar's Prophecy, A Larum for London, Look About You, Sir Clyomon and Sir Clamydes, and A Knack to Know a Knave.Chambers, Vol. 3, p. 516.S. R. Golding, \\"Shakespeare and Sir Thomas More\\", Notes & Queries 154 (1928), 237-9. As to why a writer would work the way the Henslowe collaborators did: the careers of dramatists who worked mostly on solo projects, like Shakespeare and Ben Jonson, show that a dramatist working alone could produce one or two plays a year on a dependable basis.In 1635 the Caroline era playwright Richard Brome signed a contract to write three plays a year, but couldn't meet the demand. If one of those plays failed to sell, or flopped with the audience, the writer was severely affected. Collaborative writing spread the risk, and could provide a more certain income for a journeyman author. A \\"Robert Wilson, yeoman (player)\\" was buried at St. Giles in Cripplegate on 20 November 1600. This is consistent with the view that the two Robert Wilsons, the player with Leicester's Men and Henslowe's dramatist, were one and the same person; it explains why Henslowe's Wilson stopped writing in 1600.H.

Following the decline of Mahodayapuram Perumals, Bekal came under the sovereignty of the Mushika or Kolathiri or Chirakkal Royal Family in the 12th century.The Hindu, 22 Oct 2005 The maritime importance of Bekal increased under the Kolathiris and Malabar became an important port town. After the Battle of Talikota in 1565 feudatory chieftains including the Keladi Nayakas (Ikkeri Nayaks) became powerful in the region. Bekal served as a hub to first dominate, then later defend Malabar. The economic importance of this port town prompted the Nayakas to fortify Bekal subsequently. Hiriya Venkatappa Nayaka initiated the construction of the fort and it was completed in 1650 AD by Shivappa Nayaka. Chandragiri fort near Kasargod was also built during this period.Kasargod: History & Society The struggles between the Kolathiries and Nayaks to hold this area ended when Hyder Ali conquered the Nayakas and Bekal fell into the hands of Mysore kings. It was an important military station for Tipu Sultan when he led a military expedition to capture Malabar. The coins and artefacts found in archaeological excavations at Bekal fort indicate the strong presence of Mysore Sultans. Tipu Sultan's death during the Fourth Anglo-Mysore War ended Mysorean control in 1799. The fort came under the British East India Company's controlMadras District Manual and became the headquarters of the Bekal Taluk of South Canara District in Bombay presidency. The political and economic importance of Bekal and its port declined. Nearby the Mukhyaprana Temple of Hanuman and ancient Muslim mosque bear testimony to the religious harmony that prevailed in the area.  Tourism  India declared Bekal Fort a special tourism area in 1992 and formed Bekal Tourism Development Corporation three years later to promote it. The song 'Uyire' (Tamil) from the movie Bombay was shot at Bekal Fort. Transportation Local roads connect to Mangalore in the north and Calicut in the south. The nearest railway station is Bekal Fort Railway Station, Kanhangad Railway Station and Kotikulam Railway Station on Mangalore-Palakkad line. There are airports at Mangalore, Kannur and Calicut.

It has a syntax similar to FORTRAN and BASIC, along with BCD arithmetic. It shares the COBOL program structure of separate data and procedure divisions. Unlike Fortran's numeric labels (for GOTO), DIBOL's were alphanumeric; the language supported a counterpart to computed goto.example: GOTO(XSMALL,XMED,XLARG),XCODE History DIBOL was originally marketed by Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) in 1970. The original version, DIBOL-8, was produced for PDP-8 systems running COS-300. The PDP-8-like DECmate II, supports the COS-310 Commercial Operating System, featuring DIBOL. DIBOL-11 was developed for the PDP-11 running COS-350 operating system. It also ran on RSX-11, RT-11, and from 1978 on RSTS/E. DIBOL-32 runs on VAX/VMS systems, although it can also be used on other systems through emulators. ANSI Standards were released in 1983, 1988 and 1992 (ANSI X3.165-1992). The 1992 standard was revised in 2002. DIBOL compilers were developed by several other companies, including DBL from DISC (later Synergex), Softbol from Omtool, and Unibol from Software Ireland, Ltd. Development of DIBOL effectively ceased after 1993, when an agreement between DEC and DISC replaced DIBOL with DBL on OpenVMS, OSF/1, and SCO Unix. An alternative Rather than code either DIBOL or COBOL, an alternative was to use Business Controls Corporation's SB-5 package, which could generate COBOL code for the PDP-11, DECsystem-10/DECSYSTEM-20. or VAX, including an option for COBOL inserts and overrides.

They spend their larval stage inside the fruits of figs. The pollinating wasps (Agaoninae, Kradibiinae, and Tetrapusiinae) are the mutualistic partners of the fig trees. The nonpollinating fig wasps are parasitic. Extinct forms from the Eocene and Miocene are nearly identical to modern forms, suggesting that the niche has been stable over geologic time. Taxonomy The family has changed several times since its taxonomic appearance after the work of Francis Walker in 1846 described from the wasp genus Agaon. For long the subfamilies Epichrysomallinae, Otitesellinae, Sycoecinae, Sycoryctinae, Sycophaginae, and Agaoninae were the subdivisions of the family. Recent works building strong molecular phylogenies with an extended sampling size have changed the composition of Agaonidae. First, the paraphyletic groups have been excluded (Epichrysomallinae, Otitesellinae, Sycoecinae, and Sycoryctinae) and new subfamilies have been instated (Kradibiinae and Tetrapusiinae). Then the subfamily Sycophaginae have been placed within the family Agaonidae. Within the Sycophaginae, some changes were made after the molecular phylogeny of the subfamily: the genus Apocryptophagus has been synonymined under the genus Sycophaga. Ecology Wasps from the three subfamilies Agaoninae, Kradibiinae and Tetrapusiinae are pollinating fig wasps. On the other hand, Sycophaginae are parasites of the Ficus, developing in the fruits after other wasps have pollinated them. Nevertheless, some species in the genus Sycophaga have a controversial status; as they enter the fig by its ostiole, they possibly bring pollen inside the fig and might pollinate it. Morphological adaptations The pollinating female fig wasps are winged and in general dark, while the males are mostly wingless and whitish. This difference of color is probably due to a clear split in the gender role. Once they have mated, male and female fig wasps have different fates. In some fig species, such as Ficus subpisocarpa or Ficus tinctoria, the males have to chew a hole for the females to leave their natal fig. The winged female wasps can fly over long distances before finding another fig to oviposit in it, while the male dies after chewing a hole. As the fig is closed by a tight ostiole, the female wasps have developed adaptations to enter. First, the mandibles of the female wasps have developed specialized mandibular appendages to help them crawl into the figs. These appendages are adapted to the host fig species, with for instance spiraled ostioles matched by spiral mandibular appendages. The nonpollinating wasps also have developed impressive morphological adaptations to deposit eggs inside the fig from the outside, in the form of an extremely long ovipositor.

The EL is a badge- engineered Honda Civic with a higher level of features. There is no Type-S trim offered on both Acura ELs. The Acura EL was a sales success. Representing 51% of Acura Canada's annual new-vehicle sales in its first full year, the EL remained Acura's top seller in Canada from 1997 to 2003. The Acura EL was replaced for the 2006 model year by the Acura CSX which, like the EL, was available only in Canada. TOC First generation (1997‚Äì2000) 1999‚Äì2000 Acura 1.6EL The first generation of the EL was a rebadged version of the Japanese market Honda Domani, a somewhat altered version of the 1997‚Äì2000 Honda Civic with differing front end, trunk, lights and various interior pieces. Honda sold the upscale Domani at Japanese dealership sales channel called Honda Clio that sold large, or well equipped luxury sedans like the Honda Legend and the Honda Inspire, and sold the more affordable Honda Civic at Honda Primo locations. Sold in Canada as the Acura 1.6EL, Seeing that sales within Canada for the four-door Acura Integra were extremely low, Honda decided to replace it with the four-door-only Acura EL. Its 1.6 L VTEC engine produces at 6600 rpm and at 5500 rpm. It has features not available on the similar Civic such as amber-lit LED interior dash display, tachometer, power trunk (no keyhole on the trunk), alarm, 15-inch (195/55/15) wheels, antenna in the rear window glass, chrome interior door handles, extra pocket underneath centre console, paint-matched mirrors, side moldings, and door handles, slightly stiffer suspension, 12 mm rear sway bar and 26 mm front sway bar, heated mirrors, and an amplifier. From 1999 all 5-speed models had a leather- wrapped shift knob, similar to the one in the Acura Integra GSR. =Model configurations= In addition to the above: * Base: CD player, air conditioning * Sport: 15-inch alloy wheels, CD player, air conditioning. From 1999: folding heated mirrors, a sunroof, and an upgraded grill on the front end. * Premium: in addition to the Sport, leather seats, and decorative spoiler. Second generation (2001‚Äì2005) 2004-05 Acura EL The EL was completely redesigned for the 2001 model year and was then based on the seventh-generation Civic. In addition to the slightly more powerful and torquier VTEC-equipped 1.7 L 4-cylinder SOHC engine with 127 hp (95 kW), headlight and taillight designs and available leather interior trimmings set it apart from the Civic. Other differences include 15-inch multi-spoke alloys, heated power mirrors, cruise control, and rear disc brakes. The badging was changed to Acura 1.7EL and was dropped altogether for 2004. The second- generation was available in touring and premium trim levels. The latter added leather seats, heated front seats and a power sunroof. Automatic climate control was added for the premium trim in 2003, and for the touring trim as well in 2004. All second generation EL models came with ABS anti-lock braking, but in 2003 an electronic brakeforce distribution system was made standard. For 2003 and 2004 a special dealer-installed 'aero package' was made available for both trims levels which added unique front and rear lips, side stills and a rear spoiler. In 2004, the EL underwent a slight exterior makeover with restyled headlamps, front bumper and grille, taillights, trunk lid, and rear bumper. The new look came with standard fog lights, a restyled steering wheel, new woodgrain trim patterns, and two additional tweeters powered by two amplifiers to complete the 6-speaker audio system. Discontinuation Despite being Acura Canada‚Äôs best selling vehicle, Honda announced that it will discontinue the EL. In 2006, the CSX was confirmed to be a replacement for the EL. Like the EL, the CSX was sold only in Canada. The CSX was discontinued in 2011. The CSX was confirmed after the car is discontinued and is sold only in Canada until 2011.

The original sample, also sped up, was first featured on the Internet as part of \\"The Hampster Dance\\" song on the website of the same name. Background The song was first aired on John Peel's BBC Radio 1 show on April 7, 1999 and quickly became one of the most requested songs on his show. After being included on a free sampler CD on the industry magazine The Tip Sheet, the song caught the attention of numerous large record labels including EMI, Parlophone and RCA, thanks mostly to the efforts of Jonathan King. The band eventually signed for EMI. They were given ¬£25,000 to record a video for the song which ended up featuring a giant fibreglass melon covered in trifle and a live-action hamster singing along. Originally scheduled for release as a single in November 1999, the release date was threatened to be pushed back to some time in January 2000 until the song was played on Jo Whiley's afternoon radio show. It received much the same attention as when it had been played on Peel's show. The decision was made to move the release to December 13 to put it in line for the Christmas number 1 slot. It managed to get to number 4 in the Christmas chart week,http://www.officialcharts.com/search/singles/cognoscenti%20vs%20intelligentsia/ being beaten by Westlife's \\"I Have a Dream\\".

The song's closing lines are of an announcer of a children's radio show: :\\"And this is your Uncle Dan saying good night. :Good night, little kids, good night. :We're off? Good, well that oughta hold the little bastards.\\" This last line, usually omitted on radio play, is itself a sample from Kermit Schafer's 1950s \\"recreation\\" of a supposed on-air blooper by 1920s children's radio presenter, \\"Uncle Don\\". In fact, this faux pas is an urban legend.Snopes: That oughta hold the little bastards! The sample caused many complaints to the band's label EMI, enough for a Parental Advisory sticker to be included on the single by the end of the single's first week of release, presumably by those assuming the song to be aimed at children. Additionally, the sample was left unedited on Now 45 and when the song was played by Jo Whiley on BBC Radio 1 in November, the broadcast of the song which eventually greenlit the single's release by EMI, the sample was again unedited, causing much controversy. The song itself is, like many recordings by the band, dotted with other humorous quotes from old movies, TV and radio programmes, including the 1965 Michael Winner movie You Must Be Joking!, and at least one from the 1950s dramatization of Jules Verne's Journey to the Center of the Earth: \\"Don't be too happy. After some of months of this you'll be smacking your lips at the thought of salt beef\\". The \\"B-side\\" tracks on the single exhibit similar traits, with e.g. Fluorescent Dream Beams featuring several samples from 1974's Phantom of the Paradise, alongside an original vocal. Somewhat ironically, whilst the movie quotes are original, the core sample had to be re-recorded as a close but imperfect soundalike owing to copyright clearance issues - a problem that also plagued several other Cuban Boys singles and many tracks on the Eastwood album (e.g. Kenny, I Like Everybody), though it is unclear whether the holders refused permission (heavily suggested in the case of Inertia Kicks) or EMI simply declined to pay the licensing fees. It is known that in the case of later single The Hampsterdance Song which was recorded by the group The Boomtang Boys under the name Hampton the Hampster, Disney did not want the sample to be used. That single also ultimately used a soundalike. Release Unlike the later single \\"The Hampsterdance Song\\", \\"Cognoscenti vs. Intelligentsia\\" was released without the involvement of the owner of the original website, Deidre LaCarte. LaCarte accused the Cuban Boys of stealing in an article in the Mail on Sunday Reception The song garnered extreme reactions. Music journalist Charles Shaar Murray said the song was \\"eloquent in its sheer vacuity\\" during a highbrow debate on Channel 4 News, and Cliff Richard, whose song \\"The Millennium Prayer\\", which had been number 1 in the three weeks before the chart debut of \\"Cognoscenti vs. Intelligentsia\\" and was released to very negative reviews, said the song was \\"awful\\" during an appearance on Newsround. The band's performance on Top of the Pops of the song, reportedly unaired, saw the band dressed in lab coats and covered in cobwebs. Because of the relative obscurity of the Cuban Boys both before and after the single, they are generally considered to be a one-hit wonder. The people behind the Cuban Boys went on to score further one-hit wonder successes with a remake of \\"Rhinestone Cowboy\\" with Glen Campbell, a novelty kids band called the Barndance Boys, and the US club hit \\"I Am Gothic\\" under the name Spray.

A low-tack pressure-sensitive adhesive allows the notes to be easily attached, removed and even re-posted elsewhere without leaving residue. Originally small yellow squares, Post-it Notes and related products are available in various colors, shapes, sizes and adhesive strengths. As of 2019, there are at least 26 documented colors of Post-it Notes. Although 3M's patent expired in 1997, \\"Post-it\\" and the original notes' distinctive yellow color remain registered company trademarks, with terms such as \\"repositionable notes\\" used for similar offerings manufactured by competitors. While use of the trademark 'Post-it' in a representative sense refers to any sticky note, no legal authority has ever held the trademark to be generic. History Arthur Fry with a Post-it Note on his forehead The adhesive side of a Post-it Note, magnified 555x on an SEM In 1968, Dr. Spencer Silver, a scientist at 3M in the United States, was attempting to develop a super-strong adhesive. Instead, he accidentally created a \\"low-tack\\", reusable, pressure-sensitive adhesive. For five years, Silver promoted his \\"solution without a problem\\" within 3M both informally and through seminars, but failed to gain acceptance. In 1974, a colleague who had attended one of his seminars, Art Fry, came up with the idea of using the adhesive to anchor his bookmark in his hymn book. Fry then utilized 3M's officially sanctioned \\"permitted bootlegging\\" policy to develop the idea. The original notes' yellow color was chosen by accident, as the lab next-door to the Post-It team had only yellow scrap paper to use. 3M launched the product as \\"Press 'n Peel\\" bookmark in stores in four cities in 1977, but results were disappointing. A year later, 3M instead issued free samples directly to consumers in Boise, Idaho, with 94 percent of those who tried them indicating they would buy the product. The product was sold as \\"Post-Its\\" in 1979 when the rollout introduction began, and was sold across the United States from April 6, 1980. The following year, they were launched in Canada and Europe. In 2003, the company came out with \\"Post-it Brand Super Sticky Notes\\", with a stronger glue that adheres better to vertical and non- smooth surfaces. Until 3M's patent expired in the 1990s, Post-it type notes were produced only in the company's plant in Cynthiana, Kentucky. In 2018, 3M launched the new \\"Post-It Extreme Notes\\", designed to be more durable and water-resistant, and to stick to a variety of surfaces to which regular Post- It notes do not easily adhere. The Post-It Extreme Notes were specifically designed with work environments like construction and manufacturing in mind. =Competing claims= Alan Amron has made claims to be the inventor who in 1973 disclosed the technology used on the Post-it Note to 3M in 1974. His 1997 suit against 3M was settled and 3M paid Amron. As part of the settlement, Amron undertook not to make future claims against the company except if ever a breach of the settlement agreement should occur. However, in 2016, he launched a further suit against 3M, asserting that 3M were wrongly claiming to be the inventors, and seeking $400 million in damages.Alan Amron v. 3M Minnesota Mining & Manufacturing Co. et al., case number 9:16-cv-80125, in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida. At a preliminary hearing, a federal judge ordered the parties to undergo mediation. The suit was subsequently dismissed declaring the previous 1998 settlement agreement to be upheld. In July 2016 a former 3M marketing department employee, Daniel Dassow, voluntarily came forward as an eyewitness that in 1974 Alan Amron had in fact disclosed his Press-on memo sticky notes invention to 3M.

In 2012, Turkish artist Ardan √ñzmenoƒülu was selected to have a solo exhibition at Bertrand Delacroix Gallery in the art district of Chelsea, Manhattan. The exhibition, titled \\"E Pluribus Unum\\" (Latin for \\"Out of many, one\\"), opened November 15, 2012 and featured large scale works on Post-It Notes. In 2004, Paola Antonelli, a curator of architecture and design, included Post-it Notes in a show entitled \\"Humble Masterpieces\\". Rebecca Murtaugh, a California artist who uses Post-it Notes in her artwork, in 2001 created an installation by covering her whole bedroom with $1000 worth of the notes, using the ordinary yellow for objects she saw as having less value and neon colors for more important objects, such as the bed. In 2000, the 20th anniversary of Post-it Notes was celebrated by having artists create artworks on the notes. One such work, by the artist R. B. Kitaj, sold for ¬£640 in an auction, making it the most valuable Post-It Note on record. The Lennon Wall, a message board created during the 2014 Hong Kong protests from a stretch of curved staircase in the Central Government Complex, is covered in multi-coloured Post-It Notes with handwritten messages from supporters. Satiregram, a parody account on Instagram by Euzcil Castaneto, showcases handwritten messages on Post-it Notes that describe typical pictures people would post on Instagram. Software implementations Virtual Post-It Notes have been created for computers in the form of desktop notes. These include 3M's own Post-it Brand Software Notes, Stickies in Mac OS, Sticky Notes in Windows, or other applications like ShixxNOTE. Virtual Post-It‚Äìlike notes are also available online using Evernote, Google Keep, or Microsoft OneNote.

It involved two stages: production of sodium sulfate from sodium chloride, followed by reaction of the sodium sulfate with coal and calcium carbonate to produce sodium carbonate. The process gradually became obsolete after the development of the Solvay process.  Background  Soda ash (sodium carbonate) and potash (potassium carbonate), collectively termed alkali, are vital chemicals in the glass, textile, soap, and paper industries. The traditional source of alkali in western Europe had been potash obtained from wood ashes. However, by the 13th century, deforestation had rendered this means of production uneconomical, and alkali had to be imported. Potash was imported from North America, Scandinavia, and Russia, where large forests still stood. Soda ash was imported from Spain and the Canary Islands, where it was produced from the ashes of glasswort plants (called barilla ashes in Spain), or imported from Syria. The soda ash from glasswort plant ashes was mainly a mixture of sodium carbonate and potassium carbonate. In addition in Egypt, naturally occurring sodium carbonate, the mineral natron, was mined from dry lakebeds. In Britain, the only local source of alkali was from kelp, which washed ashore in Scotland and Ireland. Clow, Archibald and Clow, Nan L. (1952). Chemical Revolution, (Ayer Co Pub, June 1952), pp. 65-90. . In 1783, King Louis XVI of France and the French Academy of Sciences offered a prize of 2400 livres for a method to produce alkali from sea salt (sodium chloride). In 1791, Nicolas Leblanc, physician to Louis Philip II, Duke of Orl√©ans, patented a solution. That same year he built the first Leblanc plant for the Duke at Saint-Denis, and this began to produce 320 tons of soda per year. He was denied his prize money because of the French Revolution. For more recent history, see industrial history below.  Chemistry  Reaction scheme of the Leblanc process (green = reactants, black = intermediates, red = products) In the first step, sodium chloride is treated with sulfuric acid in the Mannheim process. This reaction produces sodium sulfate (called the salt cake) and hydrogen chloride: : 2 NaCl + H2SO4 -> Na2SO4 \\\\+ 2 HCl This chemical reaction had been discovered in 1772 by the Swedish chemist Carl Wilhelm Scheele. Leblanc's contribution was the second step, in which a mixture of the salt cake and crushed limestone (calcium carbonate) was reduced by heating with coal. This conversion entails two parts. First is the carbothermic reaction whereby the coal, a source of carbon, reduces the sulfate to sulfide: : Na2SO4 \\\\+ 2 C -> Na2S + 2 CO2 In the second stage, is the reaction to produce sodium carbonate and calcium sulfide. This mixture is called black ash. : Na2S + CaCO3 -> Na2CO3 \\\\+ CaS The soda ash is extracted from the black ash with water. Evaporation of this extract yields solid sodium carbonate. This extraction process was termed lixiviation.  Process detail  The sodium chloride is initially mixed with concentrated sulfuric acid and the mixture exposed to low heat. The hydrogen chloride gas bubbles off and was discarded to atmosphere before gas absorption towers were introduced. This continues until all that is left is a fused mass. This mass still contains enough chloride to contaminate the later stages of the process. The mass is then exposed to direct flame, which evaporates nearly all of the remaining chloride. The coal used in the next step must be low in nitrogen to avoid the formation of cyanide. The calcium carbonate, in the form of limestone or chalk, should be low in magnesia and silica. The weight ratio of the charge is 2:2:1 of salt cake, calcium carbonate, and carbon respectively. It is fired in a reverberatory furnace at about 1000 ¬∞C. Sometimes the reverberatory furnace rotated and thus was called a \\"revolver\\". The black-ash product of firing must be lixiviated right away to prevent oxidation of sulfides back to sulfate. In the lixiviation process, the black-ash is completely covered in water, again to prevent oxidation. To optimize the leaching of soluble material, the lixiviation is done in cascaded stages. That is, pure water is used on the black-ash that has already been through prior stages. The liquor from that stage is used to leach an earlier stage of the black-ash, and so on. The final liquor is treated by blowing carbon dioxide through it. This precipitates dissolved calcium and other impurities. It also volatilizes the sulfide, which is carried off as H2S gas. Any residual sulfide can be subsequently precipitated by adding zinc hydroxide. The liquor is separated from the precipitate and evaporated using waste heat from the reverberatory furnace. The resulting ash is then redissolved into concentrated solution in hot water. Solids that fail to dissolve are separated. The solution is then cooled to recrystallize nearly pure sodium carbonate decahydrate.  Industrial history  Leblanc established the first Leblanc process plant in 1791 in St. Denis. However, French Revolutionaries seized the plant, along with the rest of Louis Philip's estate, in 1794, and publicized Leblanc's trade secrets. Napoleon I returned the plant to Leblanc in 1801, but lacking the funds to repair it and compete against other soda works that had been established in the meantime, Leblanc committed suicide in 1806. By the early 19th century, French soda ash producers were making 10,000 - 15,000 tons annually. However, it was in Britain that the Leblanc process became most widely practiced. The first British soda works using the Leblanc process was built by the Losh family of iron founders at the Losh, Wilson and Bell works in Walker on the River Tyne in 1816, but steep British tariffs on salt production hindered the economics of the Leblanc process and kept such operations on a small scale until 1824. Following the repeal of the salt tariff, the British soda industry grew dramatically. The Bonnington Chemical Works was possibly the earliest production, and the chemical works established by James Muspratt in Liverpool and Flint, and by Charles Tennant near Glasgow became some of the largest in the world. Muspratt's Liverpool works enjoyed proximity and transport links to the Cheshire salt mines, the St Helens coalfields and the North Wales and Derbyshire limestone quarries.Peter Reed, Acid Rain and the Rise of the Environmental Chemist in Nineteenth Century Britain, (2014), p. 94 By 1852, annual soda production had reached 140,000 tons in Britain and 45,000 tons in France. By the 1870s, the British soda output of 200,000 tons annually exceeded that of all other nations in the world combined.  Pollution issues  The Leblanc process plants were quite damaging to the local environment. The process of generating salt cake from salt and sulfuric acid released hydrochloric acid gas, and because this acid was industrially useless in the early 19th century, it was simply vented into the atmosphere. Also, an insoluble smelly solid waste was produced. For every 8 tons of soda ash, the process produced 5.5 tons of hydrogen chloride and 7 tons of calcium sulfide waste. This solid waste (known as galligu) had no economic value, and was piled in heaps and spread on fields near the soda works, where it weathered to release hydrogen sulfide, the toxic gas responsible for the odor of rotten eggs. Because of their noxious emissions, Leblanc soda works became targets of lawsuits and legislation. An 1839 suit against soda works alleged, \\"the gas from these manufactories is of such a deleterious nature as to blight everything within its influence, and is alike baneful to health and property. The herbage of the fields in their vicinity is scorched, the gardens neither yield fruit nor vegetables; many flourishing trees have lately become rotten naked sticks. Cattle and poultry droop and pine away. It tarnishes the furniture in our houses, and when we are exposed to it, which is of frequent occurrence, we are afflicted with coughs and pains in the head ... all of which we attribute to the Alkali works.\\" In 1863, the British Parliament passed the first of several Alkali Acts, the first modern air pollution legislation. This act allowed that no more than 5% of the hydrochloric acid produced by alkali plants could be vented to the atmosphere. To comply with the legislation, soda works passed the escaping hydrogen chloride gas up through a tower packed with charcoal, where it was absorbed by water flowing in the other direction. The chemical works usually dumped the resulting hydrochloric acid solution into nearby bodies of water, killing fish and other aquatic life. The Leblanc process also meant very unpleasant working conditions for the operators. It originally required careful operation and frequent operator interventions (some involving heavy manual labour) into processes giving off hot noxious chemicals.Russell. Colin Archibald, Chemistry, society and environment: a new history of the British chemical industry, Royal Society of Chemistry, 2000. Sometimes, workmen cleaning the reaction products out of the reverberatory furnace wore cloth mouth-and-nose gags to keep dust and aerosols out of the lungs.Described, and called a \\"gag\\", in a recorded commentary in the Catalyst chemical industry museum in Runcorn (Cheshire, England), to keep alkali dust out of workers' lungs in the early years of the chemical industry in Britain.https://3darchaeology.co.uk/wp- content/uploads/2017/06/Volume-11-Issue-3.pdf (page 7) This improved somewhat later as processes were more heavily mechanised to improve economics and uniformity of product. By the 1880s, methods for converting the hydrochloric acid to chlorine gas for the manufacture of bleaching powder and for reclaiming the sulfur in the calcium sulfide waste had been discovered, but the Leblanc process remained more wasteful and more polluting than the Solvay process. The same is true when it is compared with the later electrolytical processes which eventually replaced it for chlorine production.  Obsolescence  In 1861, the Belgian chemist Ernest Solvay developed a more direct process for producing soda ash from salt and limestone through the use of ammonia. The only waste product of this Solvay process was calcium chloride, and so it was both more economical and less polluting than the Leblanc method. From the late 1870s, Solvay-based soda works on the European continent provided stiff competition in their home markets to the Leblanc- based British soda industry. Additionally the Brunner Mond Solvay plant which opened in 1874 at Winnington near Northwich provided fierce competition nationally. Leblanc producers were unable to compete with Solvay soda ash, and their soda ash production was effectively an adjunct to their still profitable production of chlorine, bleaching powder etc. (The unwanted by-products had become the profitable products). The development of electrolytic methods of chlorine production removed that source of profits as well, and there followed a decline moderated only by \\"gentlemen's' agreements\\" with Solvay producers.Reader W J Imperial Chemical Industries; A History Volume 1 The Forerunners 1870-1926 Oxford University Press 1970 SBN 19 215937 2 By 1900, 90% of the world's soda production was through the Solvay method, or on the North American continent, through the mining of trona, discovered in 1938, which caused the closure of the last North American Solvay plant in 1986. The last Leblanc-based soda ash plant closed in the early 1920s. However, because of solubility of the bicarbonate, the Solvay process does not work for the manufacture of potassium carbonate, and the Leblanc process continued in limited use for its manufacture until much later.  Biodiversity  There is a strong case for arguing that Leblanc process waste is the most endangered habitat in the UK, since the waste weathers down to calcium carbonate and produces a haven for plants that thrive in lime-rich soils, known as calcicoles. Only four such sites have survived the new millennium; three are protected as local nature reserves of which the largest, at Nob End near Bolton, is an SSSI and Local Nature Reserve - largely for its sparse orchid- calcicole flora, most unusual in an area with acid soils. This alkaline island contains within it an acid island, where acid boiler slag was deposited, which now shows up as a zone dominated by heather, Calluna vulgaris.Shaw, PJA & Halton W. (1998).

The band primarily consisted of vocalist Chrissy Amphlett and guitarist Mark McEntee. Amphlett garnered widespread attention for performing on stage in a school uniform and fishnet stockings, and often used an illuminated neon tube as a prop for displaying aggression towards both band members and the audience. Originally a five-piece, the band underwent numerous line-up changes, with Amphlett and McEntee remaining as core members, before its dissolution in 1996. In May 2001, the Australasian Performing Right Association (APRA), as part of its 75th-anniversary celebrations, named \\"Science Fiction\\" as one of the Top 30 Australian songs of all time. The band was inducted into the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) Hall of Fame in 2006 and in late 2007 Amphlett and McEntee reconvened to record a new single and begin working on a new album. The band played a short series of live gigs in Australia in late 2007 and early 2008. Divinyls broke up in 2009 and Amphlett died in 2013. In December 2018, McEntee announced he would be reforming the Divinyls for an Australian tour in early 2019, with Lauren Ruth Ward replacing Amphlett.Divinyls Reform for Australia Tour in 2019. The Rockpit, 3 December 2018. Retrieved 3 December 2018. On 6 February 2019, the tour was cancelled. Formation and albums Divinyls released five studio albums‚Äîfour placed in the Top 10 Australian chart, while one (Divinyls) reached No. 15 in the United States (US) and No. 33 for 3 weeks in Canada. Their biggest-selling single \\"I Touch Myself\\" (1990) achieved a No. 1 ranking in Australia, No. 4 in the United States, No. 10 in the United Kingdom (UK), and No. 13 in Canada. Amphlett was the cousin of 1960s Australian pop icon Patricia \\"Little Pattie\\" Amphlett, who had been married to Keith Jacobsen‚Äîyounger brother of pioneer rocker Col Joye and leading promoter Kevin Jacobsen. In her autobiography Pleasure and Pain (2005), Amphlett described breaking into the music scene from the age of fourteen, being arrested for busking when seventeen and travelling in Spain, and how her performances drew upon childhood pain. Amphlett and guitarist Mark McEntee were introduced by Jeremy Paul (ex-Air Supply) in the car park of a small music venue in Collaroy, Sydney, after Amphlett and Paul had finished a gig with their then band, Batonrouge. Amphlett and McEntee met again at the Sydney Opera House where Amphlett and Paul were singing in a choral concert in 1980. They recruited keyboardist Bjarne Ohlin later in 1980 and drummer Richard Harvey in 1981, respectively, and for almost two years they performed in pubs and clubs in Sydney's Kings Cross. During this time, Paul negotiated publishing and recording agreements that led to the band signing with WEA. Australian film director Ken Cameron saw Divinyls performing in a club. This led to them providing the soundtrack for his 1982 film Monkey Grip and also gave Amphlett, Paul and McEntee supporting roles in the movie. The group released two singles from the soundtrack, Music from Monkey Grip EP, \\"Boys in Town\\", which reached No. 8 on the national singles chart, and \\"Only Lonely\\". The band was the opening act at the 1983 US Festival. After the band's initial success, original manager and bassist Jeremy Paul left. He was replaced on bass, briefly by Ken Firth (ex-The Ferrets) and more permanently by Rick Grossman (ex-Matt Finish). Grossman left in 1987 to replace Clyde Bramley in Hoodoo Gurus. By early 1988, Divinyls consisted of Amphlett and McEntee with augmentation by additional musicians when recording or touring. Over the decade Divinyls released four albums, Music from Monkey Grip EP on WEA in 1982, Desperate on Chrysalis Records in 1983, What a Life! in 1985 and Temperamental in 1988. The latter two albums were also released by Chrysalis in the United States. They had hit singles in Australia with, \\"Science Fiction\\" No. 13 in 1983, \\"Good Die Young\\" No. 32 in 1984 and \\"Pleasure and Pain\\" which was written by Holly Knight and Mike Chapman and went No. 11 in 1985. Their later manager Vince Lovegrove organised Divinyls' transfer from WEA to Chrysalis and their first tours of the United States. They established a fan base there, without achieving major commercial success. Divinyls also had Australian hits with cover versions of The Easybeats' \\"I'll Make You Happy\\", and Syndicate of Sound's \\"Hey Little Boy\\" (\\"Hey Little Girl\\" with the gender switched) which reached No. 25 in 1988. Amphlett became a controversial and highly visible celebrity for her brash, overtly sexual persona and subversive humour in lyrics, performances and media interviews. =Image transformation= At the start of their popularity, Divinyls were considered to be a hard rock band. At some point, many fans referred to Amphlett as the female Angus Young, as both had similar mannerisms on stage and wore black- and-white school uniforms while performing in the early 1980s. The band's image gradually changed after the release of the album What a Life! when the band began wearing elaborate clothing and producing more songs in the pop music genre. By the time of the release of their album Temperamental, Divinyls' image had changed to a glamour fashion style where they produced modern pop music. 1990s: Divinyls duo In 1991, Divinyls released diVINYLS on Virgin Records and the single \\"I Touch Myself\\" which became their only Australian No.1 single. The song reached No. 4 in the United States and No. 10 in the United Kingdom. The majority of Divinyls' hits were co-written by Amphlett and McEntee, but in this case they wrote with Tom Kelly and Billy Steinberg. diVINYLS reached No. 5 on the Australian album charts and No. 15 on Billboard Top 200. The drummer for the diVINYLS sessions was Charley Drayton, who became romantically involved with Amphlett: they married in July 1999, and from 2000, lived together in New York. A disagreement with Virgin Records stifled future development outside Australia where they released popular albums and achieved two more top twenty singles with \\"I Ain't Gonna Eat Out My Heart Anymore\\" No. 19 in 1992 and \\"I'm Jealous\\" No. 14 in 1995. During the 1980s and 1990s Amphlett collaborated as a songwriter with other artists including Chrissie Hynde and Cyndi Lauper, and both Amphlett and McEntee worked on solo projects. A live album, Divinyls Live, was released in 1991 but Divinyls did not provide another studio album for five years. In the early 1990s, they recorded a series of cover songs for various movie soundtracks, including the Young Rascals' \\"I Ain't Gonna Eat Out My Heart Anymore\\" for Buffy the Vampire Slayer (1992), the Wild Ones' \\"Wild Thing\\" for Reckless Kelly (1993), and Roxy Music's \\"Love Is the Drug\\" for Super Mario Brothers (1993). The song \\"I Touch Myself\\" caused such a controversy it had trouble getting airplay in many US-area markets; so much to the point that while performing their song live in Texas at Austin Aqua Fest 1991 the plug was pulled on the band mid-set by organisers. It wasn't until 1996 that their fifth studio album, Underworld, was released in Australia by BMG. Despite the success of diVINYLS, Virgin had not kept them under contract and BMG did not release Underworld in the United States. As with What a Life!, they worked with three producers, beginning with Peter Collins recording \\"I'm Jealous\\" in Nashville, followed by Keith Forsey for \\"Sex Will Keep Us Together\\" and \\"Heart of Steel\\". Although \\"Heart of Steel\\" was chosen as a single, Divinyls discontinued working with Forsey because according to Amphlett \\"he was a bit too 'pop' for us\\" and remaining tracks were produced by their drummer Drayton. By the end of 1996, Amphlett and McEntee had a falling out and separated without formally disbanding Divinyls. After the separation Following Underworld, Amphlett pursued a stage career. In 1998, she played the role of Judy Garland in the Australian stage production of the life story of entertainer Peter Allen, titled The Boy from Oz. The production was a success and Amphlett's interpretation of Garland, during her final troubled years, brought her critical acclaim: she was nominated for the Helpmann Award for 'Best Female Actor in a Musical'. Amphlett and McEntee concentrated on solo projects and collaborations with other artists. Amphlett and Drayton lived in New York City from 2000, while McEntee ran a clothing label, Wheels and Doll Baby, in Perth with his partner, Melanie Greensmith. In November 2005 Amphlett published her autobiography Pleasure and Pain: My Life co-written with Larry Writer; she detailed her achievements, drug and alcohol abuse, love affairs and triumphs while a member of Divinyls. 2006: Hall of Fame and reformation On 16 August 2006, Divinyls were inducted into the ARIA Hall of Fame and made their first performance for 10 years at the award ceremony. They reformed shortly afterwards and a compilation, Greatest Hits, was released by EMI Music Australia in August 2006. The band recorded four new songs via a satellite link: Amphlett and Drayton at Palm Studios in Las Vegas and McEntee in Perth. A single and B-side, \\"Don't Wanna Do This\\"/\\"Asphyxiated\\", was released in November 2007, with a third track, \\"All Pretty Things\\", released on a compilation album for the Homebake Festival. Amphlett stated that the band would return to the studio to record a full album provided they \\"survived\\" their Homebake headline gig and national tour. They performed during the Australian Idol grand final at the Sydney Opera House, on 25 November 2007, although their performance of \\"Boys in Town\\" (also performed by Idol winner Natalie Gauci) had to be repeated after Network Ten's transmission feed was interrupted. A national tour of Australia followed in December 2007 with a touring band featuring Drayton on drums, Jerome Smith on bass, Charlie Owen on guitar and newest member Clayton Doley on keyboards. Amphlett revealed on 7 December 2007 that she had multiple sclerosis in an interview with Richard Wilkins on Network Nine's A Current Affair‚Äînevertheless, she was looking forward to touring with Divinyls. The next day, Divinyls headlined the Homebake music festival where Amphlett displayed an emotional fragility when attempting to get the crowd to sing along with her. In August 2009, Amphlett announced that Divinyls were finished and she had a new band in New York. Death of Amphlett and abortive reformation Aged 53 years, Amphlett died on 21 April 2013 at her home in New York City after a protracted battle with breast cancer since 2010. Amphlett stated that she had been unable to receive radiotherapy or chemotherapy as treatment for the cancer due to her multiple sclerosis. Amphlett's cousin Patricia Thompson announced the news in an official public statement: \\"Our beloved Chrissy peacefully made her transition this morning. Christine Joy Amphlett succumbed to the effects of breast cancer and multiple sclerosis, diseases she vigorously fought with exceptional bravery and dignity.\\" In 2014, some of Australia's leading female artists came together to cover \\"I Touch Myself\\" to raise awareness and funds for breast cancer. In 2017, the band performed a one-off show in Perth with The Preatures' Isabella Manfredi and Jack Moffit joining as guests on lead vocals and rhythm guitar, respectively. McEntee, Grossman and Harvey completed the line-up. In December 2018, McEntee announced he would be reforming the group with new singer Lauren Ruth Ward, ex-Divinyls guitarist Frank Infante and a new rhythm section for an Australian tour, to begin in 2019. However, this announcement was criticised by Drayton and several fans as an \\"ultimate disrespect\\", with Drayton stating that anyone other than Amphlett who fronted the Divinyls should \\"seek some trustworthy advice\\".Divinyls Australian Tour 'Ultimate Disrespect' to Chrissy Amphlett.

He is the lead guitarist, keyboardist and a founding member of Angels & Airwaves, appearing on every album except The Dream Walker (2014). Music career Kennedy was a member of Box Car Racer, a rock band formed by Blink-182 members Tom DeLonge and Travis Barker. Box Car Racer, then a side project to Blink-182, put out its only album in 2002. Kennedy was also a member of the hardcore groups Over My Dead Body from San Diego and Hazen Street from New York. With Angels & Airwaves he had released five albums. David and band member Tom DeLonge were close friends and grew up together in Poway, California. In 2014, Kennedy took a break from music to focus on his career with James Coffee Co, a San Diego-based coffee house of which he is a part owner that specializes in producing handcrafted artisan roasted coffee beans. On April 18, 2018, DeLonge announced on Instagram that Kennedy and bassist Matt Wachter had rejoined Angels & Airwaves and are set to appear on the next album. Instruments While playing with Angels & Airwaves, Kennedy was often seen playing his Gibson Memphis Custom Shop ES-335 Diamond Limited Run Electric Guitars, in all three colors in which they are available. He used Gibson Dirty Fingers Humbucking Pickups, the same bridge pickup Tom uses in all of his signature ES-333 models, in order to emulate Delonge's signature distorted, over driven tone when playing hand muted octave chords, often with delay effects. David played through Mesa Boogie triple rectifier heads and matching cabinets. Most of David's rig emulates that of DeLonge's, including the use of amps, preamp, cabs and effects, with the only exception being David's use of Ernie Ball Regular Slinky (10-46) strings as opposed to DeLonge's use of Ernie Ball Skinny Top, Heavy Bottom (10-52) strings. From 2010 to 2014, David used one Fender '65 Twin Reverb for clean, and one Vox AC30 for overdrive, matching Tom's setup once again. David had also used the Tom Delonge Signature Gibson ES-333 in some 2012 live performances and is seen with it in the Surrender music video. Motorcycle racing David Kennedy is known to have a love of motorcycles. In July 2009 he entered and won his first race at the Willow Springs Motorcycle Club. Afterwards Kennedy stated, > ‚ÄúI was nervous at the start, feeling just like I do before I go on stage to > play for a huge crowd. There's a lot to compare between playing on stage and > racing. Once the race started I just wanted to perform as best as I possibly > could. I always want to be the best at what I dedicate myself to doing. A > lot of people have helped me get to this point with my riding and I couldn't > let them down. So it felt as though my riding was a lot like doing a > performance.‚Äù He added that he wants to race as many tracks as he can. On October 19, David placed second in his second race at Willow Springs, and managed to break his placement streak on November 14 by once again taking first.

Pathology is the medical discipline that describes conditions typically observed during a disease state, whereas physiology is the biological discipline that describes processes or mechanisms operating within an organism. Pathology describes the abnormal or undesired condition, whereas pathophysiology seeks to explain the functional changes that are occurring within an individual due to a disease or pathologic state. History =Etymology= The term pathophysiology comes from the Ancient Greek œÄŒ¨Œ∏ŒøœÇ (pathos) and œÜœÖœÉŒπŒøŒªŒøŒ≥ŒØŒ± (phusiologia). =Nineteenth century= Reductionism In Germany in the 1830s, Johannes M√ºller led the establishment of physiology research autonomous from medical research. In 1843, the Berlin Physical Society was founded in part to purge biology and medicine of vitalism, and in 1847 Hermann von Helmholtz, who joined the Society in 1845, published the paper \\"On the conservation of energy\\", highly influential to reduce physiology's research foundation to physical sciences. In the late 1850s, German anatomical pathologist Rudolf Virchow, a former student of M√ºller, directed focus to the cell, establishing cytology as the focus of physiological research, while Julius Cohnheim pioneered experimental pathology in medical schools' scientific laboratories. Germ theory By 1863, motivated by Louis Pasteur's report on fermentation to butyric acid, fellow Frenchman Casimir Davaine identified a microorganism as the crucial causal agent of the cattle disease anthrax, but its routinely vanishing from blood left other scientists inferring it a mere byproduct of putrefaction. In 1876, upon Ferdinand Cohn's report of a tiny spore stage of a bacterial species, the fellow German Robert Koch isolated Davaine's bacterides in pure culture ‚Äîa pivotal step that would establish bacteriology as a distinct discipline‚Äî identified a spore stage, applied Jakob Henle's postulates, and confirmed Davaine's conclusion, a major feat for experimental pathology. Pasteur and colleagues followed up with ecological investigations confirming its role in the natural environment via spores in soil. Also, as to sepsis, Davaine had injected rabbits with a highly diluted, tiny amount of putrid blood, duplicated disease, and used the term ferment of putrefaction, but it was unclear whether this referred as did Pasteur's term ferment to a microorganism or, as it did for many others, to a chemical.Bulloch, William, The History of Bacteriology (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1938 & 1960 / New York: Dover Publications, 1979), p 143‚Äì144, 147-148 In 1878, Koch published Aetiology of Traumatic Infective Diseases, unlike any previous work, where in 80 pages Koch, as noted by an historian, \\"was able to show, in a manner practically conclusive, that a number of diseases, differing clinically, anatomically, and in aetiology, can be produced experimentally by the injection of putrid materials into animals.\\" Koch used bacteriology and the new staining methods with aniline dyes to identify particular microorganisms for each. Germ theory of disease crystallized the concept of cause‚Äîpresumably identifiable by scientific investigation. Scientific medicine The American physician William Welch trained in German pathology from 1876 to 1878, including under Cohnheim, and opened America's first scientific laboratory ‚Äîa pathology laboratory‚Äî at Bellevue Hospital in New York City in 1878. Welch's course drew enrollment from students at other medical schools, which responded by opening their own pathology laboratories. Once appointed by Daniel Coit Gilman, upon advice by John Shaw Billings, as founding dean of the medical school of the newly forming Johns Hopkins University that Gilman, as its first president, was planning, Welch traveled again to Germany for training in Koch's bacteriology in 1883. Welch returned to America but moved to Baltimore, eager to overhaul American medicine, while blending Vichow's anatomical pathology, Cohnheim's experimental pathology, and Koch's bacteriology. Hopkins medical school, led by the \\"Four Horsemen\\" ‚ÄîWelch, William Osler, Howard Kelly, and William Halsted‚Äî opened at last in 1893 as America's first medical school devoted to teaching German scientific medicine, so called. =Twentieth century= Biomedicine The first biomedical institutes, Pasteur Institute and Berlin Institute for Infectious Diseases, whose first directors were Pasteur and Koch, were founded in 1888 and 1891, respectively. America's first biomedical institute, The Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research, was founded in 1901 with Welch, nicknamed \\"dean of American medicine\\", as its scientific director, who appointed his former Hopkins student Simon Flexner as director of pathology and bacteriology laboratories. By way of World War I and World War II, Rockefeller Institute became the globe's leader in biomedical research. Molecular paradigm The 1918 pandemic triggered frenzied search for its cause, although most deaths were via lobar pneumonia, already attributed to pneumococcal invasion. In London, pathologist with the Ministry of Health, Fred Griffith in 1928 reported pneumococcal transformation from virulent to avirulent and between antigenic types ‚Äînearly a switch in species‚Äî challenging pneumonia's specific causation.\\"In the bacteriology of the 1920s, the conversion of the R to the S form could be regarded as an adaptation to the environment. However, the transformation of Type I to Type II was the equivalent of the transformation of one species into another, a phenomenon never before observed. Avery was initially skeptical of Griffith's findings and for some time refused to accept the validity of his claims, believing that they were the result of inadequate experimental controls. Avery's research on therapeutic sera led him to conclude that pneumococcal types were fixed and that specific therapeutic agents could thus be developed to combat the various types. A transformation from type to type in vivo presented a disturbing clinical picture, as well as a challenge to the theoretical formulations of contemporary bacteriology\\" [Oswald T Avery Collection, \\"Shifting focus: Early work on bacterial transformation, 1928-1940\\", Profiles in Science, US National Library of Medicine, Web: 24 Jan 2013].Dubos, Ren√© J, Oswald T Avery: His Life and Scientific Achievements (New York: Rockefeller University Press, 1976), pp 133, 135-136 The laboratory of Rockefeller Institute's Oswald Avery, America's leading pneumococcal expert, was so troubled by the report that they refused to attempt repetition.Dubos, Ren√©, \\"Memories of working in Oswald Avery's laboratory\\", Symposium Celebrating the Thirty-Fifth Anniversary of the Publication of \\"Studies on the chemical nature of the substance inducing transformation of pneumococcal types\\", 2 Feb 1979 When Avery was away on summer vacation, Martin Dawson, British-Canadian, convinced that anything from England must be correct, repeated Griffith's results, then achieved transformation in vitro, too, opening it to precise investigation. Having returned, Avery kept a photo of Griffith on his desk while his researchers followed the trail. In 1944, Avery, Colin MacLeod, and Maclyn McCarty reported the transformation factor as DNA, widely doubted amid estimations that something must act with it. At the time of Griffith's report, it was unrecognized that bacteria even had genes. The first genetics, Mendelian genetics, began at 1900, yet inheritance of Mendelian traits was localized to chromosomes by 1903, thus chromosomal genetics. Biochemistry emerged in the same decade.Bechtel, William, Discovering Cell Mechanisms: The Creation of Modern Cell Biology (New York: Cambridge University Press, 2005) In the 1940s, most scientists viewed the cell as a \\"sack of chemicals\\" ‚Äîa membrane containing only loose molecules in chaotic motion‚Äî and the only especial cell structures as chromosomes, which bacteria lack as such. Chromosomal DNA was presumed too simple, so genes were sought in chromosomal proteins. Yet in 1953, American biologist James Watson, British physicist Francis Crick, and British chemist Rosalind Franklin inferred DNA's molecular structure ‚Äîa double helix‚Äî and conjectured it to spell a code. In the early 1960s, Crick helped crack a genetic code in DNA, thus establishing molecular genetics. In the late 1930s, Rockefeller Foundation had spearheaded and funded the molecular biology research program ‚Äîseeking fundamental explanation of organisms and life‚Äî led largely by physicist Max Delbr√ºck at Caltech and Vanderbilt University.Kay, Lily, Molecular Vision of Life: Caltech, the Rockefeller Foundation, and the Rise of the New Biology (New York: Oxford University Press, 1993) Yet the reality of organelles in cells was controversial amid unclear visualization with conventional light microscopy. Around 1940, largely via cancer research at Rockefeller Institute, cell biology emerged as a new discipline filling the vast gap between cytology and biochemistry by applying new technology ‚Äîultracentrifuge and electron microscope‚Äî to identify and deconstruct cell structures, functions, and mechanisms. The two new sciences interlaced, cell and molecular biology. Mindful of Griffith and Avery, Joshua Lederberg confirmed bacterial conjugation ‚Äîreported decades earlier but controversial‚Äî and was awarded the 1958 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. At Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory in Long Island, New York, Delbr√ºck and Salvador Luria led the Phage Group ‚Äîhosting Watson‚Äî discovering details of cell physiology by tracking changes to bacteria upon infection with their viruses, the process transduction. Lederberg led the opening of a genetics department at Stanford University's medical school, and facilitated greater communication between biologists and medical departments. Disease mechanisms In the 1950s, researches on rheumatic fever, a complication of streptococcal infections, revealed it was mediated by the host's own immune response, stirring investigation by pathologist Lewis Thomas that led to identification of enzymes released by the innate immune cells macrophages and that degrade host tissue. In the late 1970s, as president of Memorial Sloan‚ÄìKettering Cancer Center, Thomas collaborated with Lederberg, soon to become president of Rockefeller University, to redirect the funding focus of the US National Institutes of Health toward basic research into the mechanisms operating during disease processes, which at the time medical scientists were all but wholly ignorant of, as biologists had scarcely taken interest in disease mechanisms.Letter: Lewis Thomas (MSKCC) to Joshua Lederberg (Stanford Univ), 7 Aug 1978, p 1 Thomas became for American basic researchers a patron saint. =Examples= *The pathophysiology of Parkinson's disease is death of dopaminergic neurons as a result of changes in biological activity in the brain with respect to Parkinson's disease (PD). There are several proposed mechanisms for neuronal death in PD; however, not all of them are well understood. Five proposed major mechanisms for neuronal death in Parkinson's Disease include protein aggregation in Lewy bodies, disruption of autophagy, changes in cell metabolism or mitochondrial function, neuroinflammation, and blood-brain barrier (BBB) breakdown resulting in vascular leakiness. *The pathophysiology of heart failure is a reduction in the efficiency of the heart muscle, through damage or overloading. As such, it can be caused by a wide number of conditions, including myocardial infarction (in which the heart muscle is starved of oxygen and dies), hypertension (which increases the force of contraction needed to pump blood) and amyloidosis (in which misfolded proteins are deposited in the heart muscle, causing it to stiffen). Over time these increases in workload will produce changes to the heart itself. *The pathophysiology of multiple sclerosis is that of an inflammatory demyelinating disease of the CNS in which activated immune cells invade the central nervous system and cause inflammation, neurodegeneration and tissue damage. The underlying condition that produces this behaviour is currently unknown. Current research in neuropathology, neuroimmunology, neurobiology, and neuroimaging, together with clinical neurology provide support for the notion that MS is not a single disease but rather a spectrum *The pathophysiology of hypertension is that of a chronic disease characterized by elevation of blood pressure. Hypertension can be classified by cause as either essential (also known as primary or idiopathic) or secondary. About 90‚Äì95% of hypertension is essential hypertension. *The pathophysiology of HIV/AIDS involves, upon acquisition of the virus, that the virus replicates inside and kills T helper cells, which are required for almost all adaptive immune responses. There is an initial period of influenza-like illness, and then a latent, asymptomatic phase. When the CD4 lymphocyte count falls below 200 cells/ml of blood, the HIV host has progressed to AIDS, a condition characterized by deficiency in cell-mediated immunity and the resulting increased susceptibility to opportunistic infections and certain forms of cancer. *The pathophysiology of spider bites is due to the effect of its venom. A spider envenomation occurs whenever a spider injects venom into the skin. Not all spider bites inject venom ‚Äì a dry bite, and the amount of venom injected can vary based on the type of spider and the circumstances of the encounter. The mechanical injury from a spider bite is not a serious concern for humans. *The pathophysiology of obesity involves many possible pathophysiological mechanisms involved in its development and maintenance. This field of research had been almost unapproached until the leptin gene was discovered in 1994 by J. M. Friedman's laboratory. These investigators postulated that leptin was a satiety factor. In the ob/ob mouse, mutations in the leptin gene resulted in the obese phenotype opening the possibility of leptin therapy for human obesity. However, soon thereafter J. F. Caro's laboratory could not detect any mutations in the leptin gene in humans with obesity. On the contrary Leptin expression was increased proposing the possibility of Leptin-resistance in human obesity.

The city was built on Mount Mithridat, a hill on the western side of the Cimmerian Bosporus. It was founded by Milesians in the late 7th or early 6th century BC. The ruins of the site are now located in the modern city Kerch. Early existence A coin from Panticapaeum, bearing a star inside a diadem and the letters \\"Œ†ŒëŒù\\", 2nd century BC. During the first centuries of the city's existence, imported Greek articles predominated: pottery (see Kerch Style), terracottas, and metal objects, probably from workshops in Rhodes, Corinth, Samos, and Athens. Local production, imitated from the models, was carried on at the same time. Athens manufactured a special type of bowl for the city, known as Kerch ware. Local potters imitated the Hellenistic bowls known as the Gnathia style as well as relief wares‚ÄîMegarian bowls. The city minted silver coins from the 5th century BC and gold and bronze coins from the 4th century BC.Sear, David R. (1978). Greek Coins and Their Values . Volume I: Europe (pp. 168-169).

Representations of Pan on 4th century BC gold and silver Pantikapaion coins Fifth to first centuries BC In the 5th‚Äì4th centuries BC, the city became the residence first of the Archaeanactids and then of the Spartocids, dynasties of Thracian kings of Bosporus, and was hence itself sometimes called Bosporus. Its economic decline in the 4th‚Äì3rd centuries BC was the result of the Sarmatian conquest of the steppes and the growing competition of Egyptian grain. =Mithridates= Small statue of Scythians with bows from Panticapeum, fourth century BC. The last of the Spartocids, Paerisades V, apparently left his realm to Mithridates VI Eupator, king of Pontus. This transition was arranged by one of Mithridates's generals, Diophantus, who earlier had been sent to Taurica to help local Greek cities against Palacus of Lesser Scythia. The mission did not go smoothly: Paerisades was murdered by Scythians led by Saumacus, and Diophantus escaped to return later with reinforcements to suppress the revolt (c. 110 BC). Half of a century later, Mithridates took his life in Panticapaeum, when, after his defeat in a war against Rome, his son and heir Pharnaces and citizens of Panticapaeum turned against him.

Biddiss, a contributor to the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, as a \\"racialist writer\\".Biddiss, Michael (ndg) \\"Chamberlain, Houston Stewart\\" in Oxford Dictionary of National Biography Chamberlain married Eva von B√ºlow, the daughter of composer Richard Wagner, in December 1908, twenty-five years after Wagner's death.Eva von Bulow's mother, Cosima Wagner, was still married to Hans von B√ºlow when Eva was born ‚Äì but her biological father was Wagner. Chamberlain's best known book is the two-volume Die Grundlagen des neunzehnten Jahrhunderts (The Foundations of the Nineteenth Century), Electronic copy is available from the Hathi Trust Digital Library (volume 1) and (volume 2). published in 1899, which became highly influential in the pan-Germanic V√∂lkisch movements of the early 20th century and later influenced the antisemitism of Nazi racial policy. Indeed, Chamberlain has been referred to as \\"Hitler's John the Baptist\\".; citing Forman, James D. (1978) Nazism, New York. p.14 Early life and education Houston Stewart Chamberlain was born in Southsea, Hampshire, England, the son of Rear Admiral William Charles Chamberlain, RN. His mother, Eliza Jane, daughter of Captain Basil Hall, RN, died before he was a year old; his grandmother brought him up in France. Chamberlain's poor health frequently led him to being sent to the warmer climates of Spain and Italy for the winter. This constant moving about made it hard for Chamberlain to form lasting friendships. = Cheltenham college = Chamberlain's education, begun in a lyc√©e at Versailles, took place mostly on the Continent, but his father had planned a military career for his son. At the age of eleven he was sent to Cheltenham College, an English boarding school which produced many army and navy officers.Redesdale (1913), p.vi Chamberlain grew up in a self-confident, optimistic Victorian atmosphere that celebrated the 19th century as the \\"Age of Progress\\"; a time of growing wealth, scientific discoveries, technological advances and democratic political reforms, a world that many Victorians only expected to get progressively better and better with Britain of course leading the way for the rest of the world.Field (1981), pp.20‚Äì21 Chamberlain grew up as a Liberal, and shared the general values of 19th-century British liberalism such as a faith in progress, of a world that could only get better, of the greatness of Britain as a liberal democratic and capitalist society.Field (1981), pp.23 & 27 Chamberlain deeply disliked Cheltenham, and felt lonely and out of place there.Field (1981), pp.24‚Äì25 The young Chamberlain was \\"a compulsive dreamer\\", more interested in the arts than in the military, and he developed a fondness for nature and a near-mystical sense of self.Mosse (1968), p.ix Chamberlain's major interests in his studies at Cheltenham were the natural sciences, especially astronomy.Field (1981), p.24 Chamberlain later recalled: \\"The starlight exerted an indescribable influence on me. The stars seemed closer to me, more gentle, more worthy of trust, and more sympathetic ‚Äì for that is the only word which describes my feelings ‚Äì than any of the people around me in school. For the stars, I experienced true friendship\\". = Embracing conservativism = During his youth, Chamberlain ‚Äì while not entirely rejecting at this point his liberalism ‚Äì became influenced by the romantic conservative critique of the Industrial Revolution. Bemoaning the loss of \\"Merry Old England\\", this view argued for a return to a highly romanticized view of a mythic, bucolic period of English history that had never existed, with the people living happily in harmony with nature on the land overseen by a benevolent, cultured elite. In this critique, the Industrial Revolution was seen as a disaster which forced people to live in dirty, overcrowded cities, doing dehumanizing work in factories while society was dominated by a philistine, greedy middle class. The prospect of serving as an officer in India or elsewhere in the British Empire held no attraction for him. In addition, he was a delicate child with poor health. At the age of fourteen he had to be withdrawn from school. After Cheltenham, Chamberlain always felt out of place in Britain, a society whose values Chamberlain felt were not his values, writing in 1876: \\"The fact may be regrettable but it remains a fact; I have become so completely un-English that the mere thought of England and the English makes me unhappy\\".Field (1981), p.32 Chamberlain then travelled to various spas around Europe, accompanied by a Prussian tutor, Herr Otto Kuntze, who taught him German and interested him in German culture and history. Fascinated by Renaissance art and architecture, Chamberlain learned Italian and planned to settle in Florence for a time.Field (1981), pp.36‚Äì37 = University of Geneva and racial theory = Chamberlain then went to Geneva, where he studied under Carl Vogt (a supporter of racial typology at the University of Geneva),Bramwell, A., Blood and Soil ‚Äì Richard Walther Darr√© and Hitler's \\"Green Party\\", London, 1985, p. 206, Graebe, M√ºller Argoviensis, Thury, Plantamour, and other professors. He studied systematic botany, geology, astronomy, and later the anatomy and physiology of the human body.Redesdale (1913), p. vi  Botany dissertation: theory of vital force  Under the tutelage of Professor Julius von Wiesner of the University of Vienna, Chamberlain studied botany in Geneva, earning a Bacheliers en sciences (BSc) physiques et naturelles in 1881. His thesis, Recherches sur la s√®ve ascendante (Studies on rising sap), was not finished until 1897published by Attinger Fr√©res at Neuchatel the same year and did not culminate in a further qualification. The main thrust of Chamberlain's dissertation is that the vertical transport of fluids in vascular plants via xylem cannot be explained by the fluid mechanical theories of the time, but only by the existence of a \\"vital force\\" (force vitale) that is beyond the pale of physical measurement. He summarises his thesis in the Introduction: Physical arguments, in particular transpirational pull and root pressure, have since been shown to be adequate for explaining the ascent of sap.Tyree, Melvin T. and Zimmerman, Martin H. (2003). Xylem Structure and the Ascent of Sap (2nd ed.) Springer.  Still liberal: Accusing Disraeli for ruining England  During his time in Geneva, Chamberlain, who always despised Benjamin Disraeli, came to hate his country more and more, accusing the Prime Minister of taking British life down to what Chamberlain considered to be his extremely low level.Field (1981), p.353 During the early 1880s, Chamberlain was still a Liberal, \\"a man who approached issues from a firmly Gladstonian perspective and showed a marked antipathy to the philosophy and policies of British Conservatism\\".Field (1981), p.78 Chamberlain often expressed his disgust with Disraeli, \\"the man whom he blamed in large measure for the injection of selfish class interest and jingoism into British public life in the next decades\\".Field (1981), p.80 In 1881, he wrote to his family in Britain, praising William Ewart Gladstone for introducing the Land Bill to bring in \\"fair rents\\" in Ireland and withdrawing from the Transvaal.Field (1981), pp.78‚Äì80 An early sign of his anti-Semitism came in 1881 when he described the landlords in Ireland affected by the Land Bill as \\"blood-sucking Jews (sic)\\". The main landowning classes in Ireland then were Anglo-Irish gentiles, though at this stage of his life his anti-Semitic remarks were few and far between.Field (1981), p.79  Support of World Ice Theory  Chamberlain was an early supporter of Hanns H√∂rbiger's Welteislehre (\\"World Ice Theory\\"), the theory that most bodies in our solar system are covered with ice. Due in part to Chamberlain's advocacy, this became official cosmological dogma during the Third Reich.  Anti scientific claims  Chamberlain's attitude towards the natural sciences was somewhat ambivalent and contradictory ‚Äì he later wrote: \\"one of the most fatal errors of our time is that which impels us to give too great weight to the so- called 'results' of science.\\" Still, his scientific credentials were often cited by admirers to give weight to his political philosophy. Chamberlain rejected Darwinism, evolution and social Darwinism and instead emphasized \\"Gestalt\\" which he said derived from Goethe.see Harrington, Anne (1999) Reenchanted Science: Holism in German Culture from Wilhelm II to Hitler. Princeton, New Jersey: Princeton University Press. p.106 Wagnerite An ardent Francophile in his youth, Chamberlain had a marked preference for speaking French over English.Buruma (2000) p.219 It was only at the age of twenty three in November 1878, when he first heard the music of Richard Wagner‚Äîwhich struck him with all the force of a religious revelation‚Äîthat Chamberlain became not only a Wagnerite, but an ardent Germanophile and Francophobe.Field (1981), pp.53‚Äì54 As he put later, it was then he realized the full \\"degeneracy\\" of the French culture that he had so admired compared to the greatness of the German culture that had produced Wagner, who Chamberlain viewed as one of the great geniuses of all time. In the music of Wagner, Chamberlain finally found the mystical, life-affirming spiritual force that he had been unsuccessfully seeking to find in British and French cultures. Further increasing his love of Germany was that he had fallen in love with a German woman named Anna Horst, and she with him.Field (1981), p.33 As Chamberlain's wealthy, elitist family back in Britain objected to him marrying the lower middle-class Horst on the grounds that she was socially unsuitable for him, this further estranged him from Britain, a place whose people Chamberlain regarded as cold, unfeeling, callous and concerned only with money. By contrast, Chamberlain regarded Germany as the romantic \\"land of love\\", a place whose people had human feelings like love, and whose culture was infused with a special spirituality that brought out the best in humanity.Field (1981), pp.33‚Äì35 In 1883‚Äì1884, Chamberlain lived in Paris and worked as a stockbroker.Field (1981), pp.41‚Äì43. Chamberlain's attempts to play the Paris bourse ended in failure as he proved to be inept at business, and much of his hatred of capitalism stemmed from his time in Paris.Field (1981), pp.43‚Äì44 More happily for him, Chamberlain founded the first Wagner society in Paris and often contributed articles to the Revue wagn√©rienne, the first journal in France devoted to Wagner studies.Field (1981), pp.60‚Äì62 & 64‚Äì67 Together with his friend, the French writer √âdouard Dujardin, Chamberlain did much to introduce Wagner to the French, who until then had largely ignored Wagner's music.Field (1981), p.64 Thereafter he settled in Dresden, where \\"he plunged heart and soul into the mysterious depths of Wagnerian music and philosophy, the metaphysical works of the Master probably exercising as strong an influence upon him as the musical dramas\\". Chamberlain immersed himself in philosophical writings, and became a V√∂lkisch author, one of those concerned more with a highly racist understanding of art, culture, civilisation and spirit than with quantitative physical distinctions between groups.Bramwell, A. (1985) Blood and Soil ‚Äì Richard Walther Darr√© and Hitler's \\"Green Party\\", London. pp.23 & 40\\\\. This is evidenced by his huge treatise on Immanuel KantChamberlain, Houston Stewart (1905) Immanuel Kant: Die Pers√∂nlichkeit als Einf√ºhrung in das Werk. Bruckmann. with its comparisons. His knowledge of Friedrich Nietzsche is demonstrated in that work (p. 183) and in Foundations (p. 153n). It was during his time in Dresden that Chamberlain came to embrace v√∂lkisch thought through his study of Wagner, and from 1884 onwards, anti- Semitic and racist statements became the norm in his letters to his family in Britain.Field (1981), p.83 In 1888, Chamberlain wrote to his family proclaiming his joy at the death of the Emperor Friedrich III, a strong opponent of anti-Semitism whom Chamberlain called a \\"Jewish liberal\\", and rejoicing that his anti-Semitic son Wilhelm II was now on the throne.Field (1981), p.90 June 1888 was an auspicious month for Chamberlain. Besides the death of the \\"Jew-lover\\" Friedrich III, June 1888 also saw Chamberlain's first visit to the Wahnfried to meet Cosima Wagner, the reclusive leader of the Wagner cult.Biddiss (1998), p.80 Chamberlain later recalled that Cosima Wagner had \\"electrified\\" him as he felt the \\"deepest love\\" for Wagner's widow while Wagner wrote to a friend that she felt a \\"great friendship\\" with Chamberlain \\"because of his outstanding learning and dignified character\\".Field (1981), p.74 Wagner came to regard Chamberlain as her surrogate son.Field (1981), p.75 Under her influence, Chamberlain abandoned his previous belief that art was a separate entity from other fields and came to embrace the v√∂lkisch belief of the unity of race, art, nation and politics. Saxony was a center of v√∂lkisch activity in the late 19th century, and in the elections to the Saxon Landtag in 1893, v√∂lkisch candidates won 6 out of the 16 seats.Field (1981), p.89 Chamberlain's status as an immigrant to Germany always meant he was to a certain extent an outsider in his adopted country ‚Äì a man who spoke fluent German, but always with an English accent. In a classic case of being plus royaliste que le roi (more royalist than the kings), Chamberlain tried very hard to be more German than the Germans, and it was his efforts to fit in that led him to v√∂lkisch politics.Field (1981), p.331 Likewise, his anti-Semitism allowed him to define himself as a German in opposition to a group that allegedly threatened all Germans, thereby allowing him to integrate better into the Wagnerian circles with whom he socialized most of the time. Chamberlain's friend Hermann Keyserling later recalled that Chamberlain was an eccentric English \\"individualist\\" who \\"never saw Germany as it really is\\", instead having an idealized, almost mythic view of Germany and the Germans.Field (1981), p.320 This was especially the case as initially the German Wagnerites had rejected Chamberlain, telling him that only Germans could really understand Wagner, statements that very much hurt Chamberlain.Field (1981), p.58 To compensate, Chamberlain became \\"√ºberdeutsch\\", the man who wanted to be more German than the Germans. By this time Chamberlain had met his first wife, the Prussian Anna Horst, whom he would divorce in 1905 after 28 years of marriage.Shirer (1959), p.105 Chamberlain was an admirer of Richard Wagner, and wrote several commentaries on his works including Notes sur Lohengrin (\\"Notes on Lohengrin\\") (1892), an analysis of Wagner's drama (1892), and a biography (1895), emphasising in particular the heroic Teutonic aspects in the composer's works. Stewart Spencer, writing in Wagner Remembered,London 2000 described Chamberlain's edition of Wagner letters as \\"one of the most egregious attempts in the history of musicology to misrepresent an artist by systematically censoring his correspondence\\". In particular, Wagner's lively sex life presented a problem for Chamberlain. Wagner had abandoned his first wife Minna, had an open affair with the married woman Mathilde Wesendonck and had started sleeping with his second wife Cosima while she was still married to her first husband.Field (1981), p.133 Chamberlain in his Wagner biography went to considerable lengths to distort the Master's love-life such as implying that Wagner's relationship with Cosima von B√ºlow only started after the death of her first husband. During his time in Dresden, Chamberlain like many other v√∂lkisch activists became fascinated with Hindu mythology and legend, and learned Sanskrit in order to read the ancient Indian epics like the Vedas and the Upanishads in their original form.Field (1981), p.304 In these stories about ancient Aryan heroes conquering the Indian subcontinent, Chamberlain found a very appealing world governed by a rigid caste system with social inferiors firmly locked into their place; full of larger-than-life Aryan gods and aristocratic heroes and a world that focused on the spiritual at the expense of the material. Since by this time, historians, archaeologists and linguists had all accepted that the Aryans (\\"light ones\\") of Hindu legend were an Indo-European people, Chamberlain had little trouble arguing that these Aryans were in fact Germanic peoples, and modern Germans had much to learn from Hinduism, stating \\"in the night of the inner life ... the Indian ... finds his way in the dark more surely than anyone\\". For Chamberlain the Hindu texts offered a body of pure Aryan thought that made it possible to find the harmony of humanity and nature, which provided the unity of thought, purpose and action that provided the necessary spirituality for Aryan peoples to find true happiness in a world being destroyed by a soulless materialism.Field (1981), pp.304‚Äì05 The popularity of the Hindu texts with the v√∂lkisch movement explains why the swastika, an ancient Indian symbol, was adopted by the v√∂lkisch activists as one of their symbols. Chamberlain in 1886 Champion of Wagnerism In 1889, he moved to Austria. During this time it is said his ideas on race began taking shape, influenced by the concept of Teutonic supremacy he believed embodied in the works of Richard Wagner and the French racist writer Arthur de Gobineau.Chase, Allan (1977) The Legacy of Malthus: The Social Costs of the New Scientific Racism New York: Alfred A. Knopf. pp.91‚Äì92 In his book Essai sur l'in√©galit√© des races humaines, the aristocratic Gobineau, who had an obsessive hatred of commoners, had developed the theory of an Aryan master race as a way of bolstering his social standingBlue, Gregory (Spring 1999) \\"Gobineau on China: Race Theory, the \\"Yellow Peril\\" and the Critique of Modernity\\" Journal of World History, Volume 10, issue 1, p.99 as he believed that French aristocrats like himself were the descendants of the Germanic Franks who had conquered the Roman province of Gaul while ordinary French people were the descendants of racially inferior Latin and Celtic peoples. Wagner had met Gobineau while on vacation in Rome in 1876, and the two had become friends.Field (1981), p.152 Wagner was greatly influenced by Gobineau's theories, but could not accept Gobineau's theory of inevitable racial decay amongst what was left of the \\"Aryan race\\", instead preferring the idea of racial regeneration of the Aryans.Field (1981), pp.152‚Äì53 The Franco-Israeli historian Saul Friedl√§nder opined that Wagner was the inventor of a new type of anti-Semitism, namely \\"redemptive anti- semitism\\", a type of v√∂lkisch anti-semitism that could explain all in the world in regards to Jew-hatred and offer a form of \\"redemption\\" for the anti- Semitic.Friedl√§nder (1998), p.87 Chamberlain had attended Wagner's Bayreuth Festival in 1882 and struck up a close correspondence with his widow Cosima. In 1908, twenty-five years after Wagner's death, he married Eva von B√ºlow- Wagner, Franz Liszt's granddaughter and Richard Wagner's daughter (Wagner had started fathering children by Cosima while she was still married to Hans von B√ºlow ‚Äì despite her surname, Eva was actually Wagner's daughter). The next year he moved to Germany and became an important member of the \\"Bayreuth Circle\\" of German nationalist intellectuals. As an ardent Wagnerite, Chamberlain saw it as his life's mission to spread the message of racial hatred which he believed Wagner had advocated.Friedl√§nder (1998), p.89 Chamberlain explained his work in promoting the Wagner cult as an effort to cure modern society of its spiritual ills that he claimed were caused by capitalism, industrialisation, materialism, and urbanisation. Chamberlain wrote about modern society in the 1890s: > Like a wheel that spins faster and faster, the increasing rush of life > drives us continually further apart from each other, continually further > from the 'firm ground of nature'; soon it must fling us out into empty > nothingness.Field (1981), p.150 In another letter, Chamberlain stated: > If we do not soon pay attention to Schiller's thought regarding the > transformation from the state of Need into the Aesthetic State, then our > condition will degenerate into a boundless chaos of empty talk and arms > foundries. If we do not soon heed Wagner's warning‚Äîthat mankind must awaken > to a consciousness of its \\"pristine holy worth\\"‚Äîthen the Babylonian tower of > senseless doctrines will collapse on us and suffocate the moral core of our > being forever. In Chamberlain's view, the purpose of the Wagner cult was nothing less than the salvation of humanity. As such, Chamberlain became engulfed in the \\"redemptive anti-semitism\\" that was at the core of both Wagner's worldview and of the Wagner cult. Vienna years In September 1891, Chamberlain visited Bosnia and Herzegovina as a journalist.Field (1981), p.98 In 1878, the Ottoman provinces of Bosnia-Herzegovina had been occupied by Austria-Hungary; though the two provinces remained nominally Ottoman until 1908, in practice they were part of the Austrian empire from 1878 onwards. Because Bosnia-Herzegovina was still officially part of the Ottoman Empire, neither province was represented in the Austrian Reichsrat or the Hungarian Diet, and instead the two provinces were in practice a colony of Austria-Hungary. Chamberlain had been commissioned by the Austrian government to write propaganda glorying its colonial rule of Bosnia-Herzegovina for a Geneva newspaper. Chamberlain's articles about Bosnia reveal his increasing preference for dictatorship over democracy with Chamberlain praising the Austrians for having utterly no democratic aspects to their rule of Bosnia-Herzegovina.Field (1981), p.100 Chamberlain wrote that what he had seen in Bosnia-Herzegovina was the perfect example of Wagner's dictum: \\"Absolute monarch ‚Äì free people!\\" Chamberlain declared that the Bosnians were extremely lucky not to have the shambles and chaos of a democratic \\"parliamentary regime\\", instead being ruled by an idealist, enlightened dictatorship that did what was best for them. Equally important in Chamberlain's Bosnian articles was his celebration of \\"natural man\\" who lived on the land as a small farmer as opposed to what Chamberlain saw as the corrupt men who lived in modern industrial, urban society.Field (1981), p.101 At the time Chamberlain visited Bosnia-Herzegovina, the provinces had been barely touched by modernization, and for the most part, Bosnians continued to live much as their ancestors had done in the Middle Ages. Chamberlain was enchanted with what he saw, and forgetting for the moment that the purpose of his visit was to glorify Austrian rule, expressed much sadness in his articles that the \\"westernization\\" being fostered by the Austrians would destroy the traditional way of life in Bosnia.Field (1981), pp.100‚Äì01 Chamberlain wrote about the average Bosnian: > [The Bosnian peasant] builds his house, he makes his shoes, and plough, etc; > the woman weaves and dyes the stuffs and cooks the food. When we have > civilized these good people, when we have taken from them their beautiful > costumes to be preserved in museums as objects of curiosity, when we have > ruined their national industries that are so perfect and so primitive, when > contact with us has destroyed the simplicity of their manner‚Äîthen Bosnia > will no longer be interesting to us. Chamberlain's awe and pride in the tremendous scientific and technological advances of the 19th century were always tempered with an extremely strong nostalgia for what he saw as the simpler, better and more innocent time when people lived on the land in harmony with nature. In his heart, Chamberlain was always a romantic conservative who idealised the Middle Ages and was never quite comfortable with the changes wrought by the Industrial Revolution. In Bosnia, Chamberlain saw an essentially medieval society that still moved to the ancient rhythm of life that epitomized his pastoral ideal. Remembering Bosnia several years later, Chamberlain wrote: > The spirit of a natural man, who does everything and must create everything > for himself in life, is decidedly more universal and more harmoniously > developed than the spirit of an industrial worker whose whole life is > occupied with the manufacturing of a single object ‚Ä¶ and that only with the > aid of a complicated machine, whose functioning is quite foreign to him. A > similar degeneration is taking place amongst peasants: an American farmer in > the Far West is today only a kind of subordinate engine driver. Also among > us in Europe it becomes every day more impossible for a peasant to exist, > for agriculture must be carried out in \\"large units\\"‚Äîthe peasant > consequently becomes increasingly like an industrial worker. His > understanding dries up; there is no longer an interaction between his spirit > and surrounding Nature. Chamberlain's nostalgia for a pre-industrial way of life that he expressed so strongly in his Bosnia articles earned him ridicule, as many believed that he had an absurdly idealized and romanticized view of the rural life that he never experienced first-hand.Field (1981), p.102 In 1893, after receiving a letter from Cosima Wagner telling him that he had to read Gobineau's Essai sur l'in√©galit√© des races humaines, Chamberlain, who was fluent in French, duly complied with her request.Biddiss (1998) p. 81 Chamberlain accepted Gobineau's belief in an Aryan master-race, but rejected his pessimism, writing that Gobineau's philosophy was \\"the grave of every attempt to deal practically with the race question and left only one honorable solution, that we at once put a bullet through our heads\\".Buruma (2000), p. 220 Chamberlain's time in Vienna shaped his anti-Semitism and Pan-Germanism. Despite living in Vienna from 1889 to 1909, when he moved to Bayreuth, Chamberlain had nothing but contempt for the multi-ethnic, multi-religious Habsburg empire, taking the viewpoint that the best thing that could happen to the Austrian empire would be for it to be annexed by Germany to end the V√∂lkerchaos (chaos of the peoples).Field (1981), pp. 114‚Äì15 Vienna had a large Jewish population (until 1938, Vienna was about 10% Jewish), and Chamberlain's time in Vienna may have been the first time in his life when he actually encountered Jews. Chamberlain's letters from Vienna constantly complain about how he was having to meet and deal with Jews, every one of whom he detested.Field (1981), pp. 115‚Äì16 In 1894 after visiting a spa, Chamberlain wrote: \\"Unfortunately like everything else ... it has fallen into the hands of the Jews, which includes two consequences: every individual is bled to the utmost and systematically, and there is neither order nor cleanliness.\\"Field (1981), p.116 In 1895, he wrote: > However, we shall have to move soon anyway, for our house having been sold > to a Jew ... it will soon be impossible for decent people to live in it ... > Already the house being almost quite full of Jews, we have to live in a > state of continual warfare with the vermin which is a constant and > invariable follower of this chosen people even in the most well-to-do > classes. In another letter of 1895, Chamberlain wrote he was still influenced by French anarchist Pierre-Joseph Proudhon's critique of the Jews as mindlessly materialistic, writing that Proudhon was \\"one of the most acute minds of the century\\" and \\"I find many points of contact between the Wagner-Schiller mode of thought and the anarchism of Proudhon.\\"Field (1981), p. 81 At the same time, Chamberlain's marriage to Anna began to fall apart, as his wife was frequently sick and though she assisted her husband with his writings, he did not find her very intellectually stimulating.Field (1981), pp. 332‚Äì33 Chamberlain started to complain more and more that his wife's frequent illnesses forced him to tend to her and were holding back his career.Field (1981), p.334 Though Chamberlain was always very supportive of German imperialism, he had nothing but scorn for British imperialism, viewing Britain as the world's biggest bully, a view that he expressed more and more vehemently as the 1890s went on. In 1895, Chamberlain wrote to his aunt about the Hamidian massacres in the Ottoman Empire during 1894‚Äì96: > The Armenian insurrection [of 1894] with the inevitable retaliation of > massacres and persecution (of course enormously exaggerated by those > greatest liars in creation, backed by their worthy friends the English > journalists) was all got up at the precise moment when English politics > required a \\"diversion\\". In 1896, Chamberlain wrote to his aunt: > The English press is the most insufferably arrogant, generally ignorant, the > most passionately one-sided and narrow-minded in its judgments that I know; > it is the universal bully, always laying down the law for everybody, always > speaking as if it were umpire of the universe, always abusing everybody all > round and putting party spirit in all its judgments, envenoming thus the > most peaceful discussions. It is this and this only which has made England > hated all the world over. During the whole year 1895, I never opened an > English newspaper without finding War predicated or threatened‚ÄîNo other > nation in the world has wanted war or done anything but pray for > peace‚ÄîEngland alone, the world's bully, has been stirring it up on all > sides.Field (1981), pp. 355‚Äì56 During the 1890s, Chamberlain was an outspoken critic of British policy in South Africa, writing to his uncle in 1898: > We are the heathen nation and race par excellence. War, conquest, commerce, > money and above all an eternal readiness to knock every man down who stands > in our way. And the only thing thoroughly distasteful to me in England and > Englishmen generally, and English politics in particular, is this eternal > coquetting with a religion to which every one of their feelings and opinions > and acts is in direct contradiction.Field (1981), p. 356 At the time of the Boer War, Chamberlain supported the Boers against the British, though not publicly, and he expressed much regret that two white peoples should be killing each other at a time when he believed that white supremacy around the world was being threatened by the alleged \\"Yellow Peril\\".Field (1981), p. 357 In July 1900, Chamberlain wrote to his aunt: > One thing I can clearly see, that is, that it is criminal for Englishmen and > Dutchmen to go on murdering each other for all sorts of sophisticated > reasons, while the Great Yellow Danger overshadows us white men and > threatens destruction ... The fact that a tiny nation of peasants absolutely > untrained in the conduct of war, has been able to keep the whole united > empire at bay for months, and has only been overcome‚Äîand has it been > overcome?‚Äîby sending out an army superior in number to the whole population > including women and children, has lowered respect for England beyond > anything you can imagine on your side of the water, and will certainly not > remain lost on the minds of those countless millions who have hitherto been > subdued by our prestige only. Chamberlain seized upon the fact that some of the Randlords were Jewish to argue in his letters to Cosima Wagner that the war was a case of Anglo-Jewish aggression against the Germanic Afrikaners.Field (1981), pp. 357‚Äì58 Wagner wrote back to Chamberlain: \\"This extermination of one of the most excellent Germanic races is so horrible that I know of nothing I have experienced which is comparable to it.\\" As a leading Wagnerite in Vienna, Chamberlain befriended a number of other prominent Wagnerites, such as Prince Hohenhohe-Langenburg, Ludwig Schemann, Georg Meurer, and Baron Christian von Ehrenfels.Field (1981), p. 128 The most important friendship that Chamberlain made during his time in Vienna was with German Ambassador to Austria-Hungary, Prince Philip von Eulenburg, who shared Chamberlain's love of Wagnerian music. Besides being a passionate Wagnerite, Eulenburg was also an anti-Semite, an Anglophobe and a convinced enemy of democracy who found much to admire in Chamberlain's anti- Semitic, anti-British and anti-democratic writings.Buruma (2000) p. 218 Die Grundlagen (The Foundations) In February 1896, the Munich publisher Hugo Bruckmann, a leading v√∂lkisch activist who was later to publish Mein Kampf commissioned Chamberlain to write a book that was intended to summarize all of the achievements of the 19th century.Field (1981), pp.169‚Äì70; Lobenstein- Reichmann (2008), 21-22 In October 1899 Chamberlain published his most famous work, Die Grundlagen des neunzehnten Jahrhunderts, in German. The Foundations is a pseudo-scientific \\"racial history\\" of humanity from the emergence of the first civilizations in the ancient Near East to the year 1800. It argues that all of the \\"foundations\\" of the great 19th century, which saw huge economic, scientific and technological advances in the West, were the work of the \\"Aryan race\\".Field (1981), p.180 Die Grundlagen was only the first volume of an intended three-volume history of the West with the second and third volumes taking up the story of the West in the 19th century and the looming war for world domination in the coming 20th century between the Aryans on one side vs. the Jews, blacks and Asians on the other side.Field (1981), pp.171‚Äì72 Chamberlain never wrote the second or third volumes, much to the intense annoyance of Cosima Wagner, who was upset that Die Grundlagen stopped in 1800 before Wagner was born, and thus gave her late husband short shrift.Field (1981), pp.343‚Äì45 The book argued that Western civilisation is deeply marked by the influence of Teutonic peoples. = Races defined as Aryan = Chamberlain grouped all European peoples ‚Äì not just Germans, but Celts, Slavs, Greeks, and Latins ‚Äì into the \\"Aryan race\\", a race built on the ancient Proto- Indo-European culture. In fact he even included the Berber people of North Africa in the Aryan race: \\"The noble Moor of Spain is anything but a pure Arab of the desert, he is half a Berber (from the Aryan family) and his veins are so full of Gothic blood that even at the present day noble inhabitants of Morocco can trace their descent back to Teutonic ancestors.\\"Chamberlain, Houston Stewart Chamberlain (2005) [1899] The Foundations of the Nineteenth Century. Adamant Media Corporation. p.398. chap.5 At the helm of the Aryan race, and, indeed, all races, according to Chamberlain, were the Germanic or Teutonic peoples, who had best preserved the Aryan blood.Field (1981), p.223 Chamberlain used the terms Aryan, Indo-European and Indo-Germanic interchangeably, but he went out of his way to emphasise that purest Aryans were to be found in Central Europe and that in both France and Russia miscegenation had diluted the Aryan blood.Field (1981), p.191 The Russians in particular had become a semi-Asian people on the account of the rule of the Golden Horde. Much of Chamberlain's theory about the superiority of the Aryan race was taken from the writings of the French aristocrat Arthur de Gobineau, but there was a crucial difference in that Gobineau had used the Aryan race theory as a way of dividing society between an Aryan nobility vs. racially inferior commoners whereas Chamberlain used the Aryan racial theory as a way of uniting society around its supposed common racial origins.Field (1981), pp.223‚Äì24 = Aryan race virtues = Everything that Chamberlain viewed as good in the world was ascribed to the Aryans. Lobenstein-Reichmann (2008), pp. 175-185 For an example, in The Foundations Chamberlain explained at considerable length that Jesus Christ could not possibly be a Jew, and very strongly implied that Christ was an Aryan.Field (1981), p.183 Chamberlain's tendency to see everything good as the work of the Aryans allowed him to claim whoever he approved of for the Aryan race, which at least was part of the appeal of the book in Germany when it was published in 1899. Chamberlain claimed all of the glories and achievements of ancient Greece and Rome as due entirely to Aryan blood, which supposedly flowed in the veins of the ancient Greeks and Romans. Chamberlain wrote that ancient Greece was a \\"lost ideal\\" of beautiful thought and art that the modern Germans were best placed to recover if only the German people could embrace Wagner.Field (1981), pp.180‚Äì81 Chamberlain praised Rome for its militarism, civic values, patriotism, respect for the law and reverence for the family as offering the best sort of Aryan government.Field (1981), p.182 Reflecting his opposition to feminism, Chamberlain lamented how modern women were not like the submissive women of ancient Rome whom he claimed were most happy in obeying the wills of their husbands. Chamberlain asserted that Aryans and Aryans alone are the only people in the entire world capable of creating beautiful art and thinking great thoughts, so he claimed all of the great artists, writers and thinkers of the West such as Homer, Dante, Giotto, Donatello, Albrecht D√ºrer, Leonardo da Vinci, Martin Luther, William Shakespeare, Rembrandt, Ludwig van Beethoven, Immanuel Kant and Johann Wolfgang von Goethe as part of one long glorious tradition of beautiful Aryan art and thought, which Chamberlain planned to have culminate with the life-changing, racially regenerating music of Richard Wagner in the 19th century.Field (1981), pp.196‚Äì98 As the British historian George Peabody Gooch wrote, here was \\"a glittering vision of mind and muscle, of large scale organization, of intoxicating self-confidence, of metallic brilliancy, such as Europe has never seen\\".Field (1981), p.196 The antithesis of the heroic Aryan race with its vital, creative life-improving qualities was the \\"Jewish race\\", whom Chamberlain presented as the inverse of the Aryan Lobenstein-Reichmann (2008), pp. 186-217. Every positive quality the Aryans had, the Jews had the exact opposing negative quality.Field (1981), pp.190‚Äì91 & 195 The American historian Geoffrey Field wrote: > To each negative \\"Semitic\\" trait Chamberlain counter-posed a Teutonic > virtue. Kantian moral freedom took the place of political liberty and > egalitarianism. Irresponsible Jewish capitalism was sharply distinguished > from the vague ideal of Teutonic industrialism, a romantic vision of an > advanced technological society which had somehow managed to retain the > Volksgemeinschaft, cooperation and hierarchy of the medieval guilds. The > alternative to Marxism was \\"ethical socialism\\", such as that described by > Thomas More, \\"one of the most exquisite scholars ever produced by a Teutonic > people, of an absolutely aristocratic, refined nature\\". In the rigidly > elitist, disciplined society of Utopia with its strong aura of Christian > humanism, Chamberlain found an approximation of his own nostalgic, communal > ideal. \\"The gulf separating More from Marx,\\" he wrote, \\"is not the progress > of time, but the contrast between Teuton and Jew.\\"Field (1981), p.195 = The Jewish wars claim = Chamberlain announced in The Foundations that \\"all the wars\\" in history were \\"so peculiarly connected with Jewish financial operations\\".Field (1981) p.190 Chamberlain warned that the aim of the Jew was \\"to put his foot upon the neck of all nations of the world and be Lord and possessor of the whole earth\\".Field (1981), p.189 As part of their plans to destroy Aryan civilization, Chamberlain wrote: \\"Consider, with what mastery they use the law of blood to extend their power.\\" Chamberlain wrote that Jewish women were encouraged to marry Gentiles while Jewish men were not, so the male line \\"remained spotless ... thousands of side-branches are cut off and employed to infect Indo-Europeans with Jewish blood.\\" In his account of the Punic wars between \\"Aryan Rome\\" and \\"Semitic Carthage\\", Chamberlain praised the Romans for their total destruction of Carthage in 146 BC at the end of the Third Punic War as an example of how Aryans should deal with Semites. Later, Chamberlain argued that the Romans had become too tolerant of Semites like the Jews, and this was the cause of the downfall of the Roman empire.Field (1981), p.182 Chamberlain argued that it was due to miscegenation that the Jews had caused the Aryan Roman Empire to go into decline and collapse. Chamberlain wrote that the \\"African half breed soldier emperor\\" Caracalla had granted Roman citizenship to all the subjects in the Empire regardless of race or religion in 212 AD, and as result of this, the Romans had freely mixed with Semitic and African peoples, leading Chamberlain to conclude: \\"Like a cataract the alien blood poured down into the depopulated city of Rome and soon the Romans ceased to exist.\\" As such, the destruction of the Western Roman Empire by the Germanic peoples was merely an act of liberation from the V√∂lkerchaos (\\"Chaos of the Peoples\\") that the Roman empire had become.Field (1981), p. 184. = Theories of Jewish conspiracy =  Jewish race domination claim  The ultimate aim of the Jew, according to Chamberlain, was to create a situation were \\"there would be in Europe only a single people of pure race, the Jews, all the rest would be a herd of pseudo- Hebraic mestizos, a people beyond all doubt degenerate physically, mentally and morally.\\"  Catholicism a Jewish invention  As part of their plans to destroy the Aryans, Chamberlain claimed that the Jews had founded the Roman Catholic Church, which only preached a \\"Judaized\\" Christianity that had nothing to do with the Christianity created by the Aryan Christ.Field (1981), p.192 At least some historians have argued that The Foundations are actually more anti-Catholic than anti-Semitic, but this misses the point that the reason why Chamberlain attacked the Catholic Church so fiercely was because he believed the Papacy was controlled by the Jews. Chamberlain claimed that in the 16th century the Aryan Germans under the leadership of Martin Luther had broken away from the corrupt influence of Rome, and so laid the foundations of a \\"Germanic Christianity\\".Field (1981), p. 194  Democracy a failed Jewish invention  Chamberlain claimed that the natural and best form of government for Aryans was a dictatorship, and so he blamed the Jews for inventing democracy as part of their plans for destroying the Aryans. In the same way, Chamberlain blamed capitalism ‚Äì which he saw as a very destructive economic system ‚Äì as something invented by the Jews to enrich themselves at the expense of the Aryans while at the same time crediting the Jews with inventing socialism with its message of universal human equality as a cunning Jewish stratagem to divert attention away from all the economic devastation wrought by Jewish financiers.  Jewish fault for Chinese lack of culture  Chamberlain's relentless determination to prove that everything he viewed as evil in the world as the work of the Jews led him to some odd conclusions. Chamberlain had a deep dislike of the Chinese, and so in The Foundations he announced that Chinese civilization had been founded by the Jews because just like the Jews the Chinese had \\"... the total absence of all culture and the one-sided emphasizing of civilization\\".Field (1981), p. 193 For Chamberlain, this was more than sufficient proof that the Jews had created Chinese civilization. = Jewish race - not religion = The Franco-Israeli historian Saul Friedl√§nder described The Foundations ‚Äì with its theory of two \\"pure\\" races left in the world, namely the German and Jewish locked into a war for world domination which could only end with the complete victory of one over the other ‚Äì as one of the key texts of \\"redemptive anti-semitism\\". Because Chamberlain viewed Jews as a race, not a religion, Chamberlain argued the conversion of Jews was not a \\"solution\\" to the \\"Jewish Question\\", stating Jewish converts to Christianity were still Jews.Field (1981), p. 311 In taking this stance, Chamberlain was going beyond his hero Wagner. The Dutch journalist Ian Buruma wrote: > Wagner himself, like Luther, still believed that a Jew could, as he put it > with his customary charm, \\"annihilate\\" his Jewishness by repudiating his > ancestry, converting and worshiping at the shrine of Bayreuth. So in theory > a Jew could be a German ‚Ä¶ But to the mystical chauvinists, like Chamberlain, > who took a tribal view of Germanness, even radical, Wagnerian assimilation > could never be enough: the Jew was an alien virus to be purged from the > national bloodstream. The more a Jew took on the habits and thoughts of his > gentile compatriots, the more he was to be feared.Buruma (2000) p. 167 = Leaving \\"the solution\\" to the reader = Chamberlain did not advocate the extermination of Jews in The Foundations; indeed, despite his determination to blame all of the world's problems on the Jews, Chamberlain never proposed a solution to this perceived problem.Field (1981), p. 222 Instead, Chamberlain made the cryptic statement that after reading his book, his readers would know best about how to devise a \\"solution\\" to the \\"Jewish Question\\". Friedl√§nder has argued that if one were to seriously take up the theories of \\"redemptive anti-semitism\\" proposed in The Foundations, and push them to their logical conclusion, then inevitably one would reach the conclusion that genocide might be a perfectly acceptable \\"solution\\" to the \\"Jewish Question\\". Friedl√§nder argued that there is an implied genocidal logic to The Foundations as Chamberlain argued that Jews were a race apart from the rest of humanity; that evil was embedded within the genes of the Jews, and so the Jews were born evil and remained evil until they died, indeed a Jew could never stop being evil even if he or she wanted to; and that for these biological reasons alone, the Jews would never cease their endless attempts to destroy all that was good within the world.  Follow up book by Josef Remier  Inspired by The Foundations, one v√∂lkisch writer, Josef Remier, published Ein Pangermanisches Deutschland (\\"A Pan-Germanic Germany\\") in 1905, which used The Foundations to advocate that Germany conquer the Russian Empire, after which special commissions of doctors, anthropologists and \\"breeding experts\\" were to divide the population into three categories; ethnic Germans, those capable of being \\"Germanized\\", and those incapable of \\"improvement\\", with all Slavs and Jews being included in the last category.Field (1981), p. 230 Field wrote that Remier's vision anticipated the \\"war of extermination\\" that was Operation Barbarossa in 1941 in \\"many horrifying aspects\\". = 'The Foundations' sales, reviews and acceptance = The Foundations sold well: eight editions and 60,000 copies within 10 years, 100,000 copies by the outbreak of World War I and 24 editions and more than a quarter of a million copies by 1938.Shirer (1959), p. 107 The success of The Foundations after it was published in October 1899 made Chamberlain into a celebrity intellectual.Field (1981), p. 227 The popularity of The Foundations was such that many Gymnasium (high school) teachers in the Protestant parts of Germany made Die Grundlagen required reading for their students.Field (1981), p. 232 One teacher remembered: \\"I myself read the whole book in one go when as a young Gymnasium teacher in N√ºrnberg it fell into my hands. And with a flushed face I put it aside full of excitement. I can picture the scene today [1927] and can reawaken the old feeling.\\"Field (1981), p. 132 The book sold very well, but reviews in Germany were very mixed. Conservative and National Liberal newspapers gave generally friendly reviews to The Foundations.Field (1981), pp. 228‚Äì29 V√∂lkisch newspapers gave overwhelming positive reviews to The Foundations with many v√∂lkisch reviewers calling Die Grundlagen one of the greatest books ever written.Field (1981), pp. 229‚Äì30 = Discrimination of Jews following the book = German universities were hotbeds of v√∂lkisch activity in the early 20th century, and The Foundations was extremely popular on university campuses with many university clubs using The Foundations as a reason to exclude Jewish students from joining.Field (1981), pp. 231‚Äì32 Likewise, military schools were centers of v√∂lkisch thought in the early 20th century, and so The Foundations was very popular with officer cadets; though since neither the Navy nor the Prussian, Bavarian, Saxon and W√ºrttemberg armies accepted Jewish officer candidates, Die Grundlagen did not lead to Jews being excluded. The only exceptions to the otherwise total exclusion of German Jews from the officer corps were the Bavarian and Saxon armies, which were prepared to accept Jews as reserve officers.Wette (2006), p. 33 Liberal and Social Democratic newspapers gave the book extremely poor reviews with reviewers complaining of an irrational way of reasoning in The Foundations, noting that Chamberlain quoted the writings of Goethe out of context in order to give him views that he had not held, and that the entire book was full of an obsessive anti-Semitism which they found extremely off-putting.Field (1981), pp. 227‚Äì28 = Catholic and Protestant responses = Because of Chamberlain's anti-Catholicism, Catholic newspapers all published very hostile reviews of The Foundations, though Catholic reviewers rarely faulted Die Grundlagen for its anti-Semitism.Field (1981), pp. 235‚Äì36 Protestant v√∂lkisch newspapers gave The Foundations very good reviews, while more orthodox Protestant newspapers were disturbed by Chamberlain's call for a racialized Christianity.Field (1981), pp. 236‚Äì37 One Protestant reviewer, Professor Baentsch of Jena, wrote that Chamberlain had systematically distorted the Book of Job, the Psalms, the Prophets, and other books of the Old Testament, leading him to conclude that it was no surprise that Chamberlain found so little common ground between Christianity and Judaism given the way he had misrepresented the entire Old Testament.Field (1981), p. 236 = Jewish response = One German Jewish reviewer, the Berlin banker Heinrich Meyer- Cohn, wrote that The Foundations was \\"bad, unclear, and illogical in its train of thought and unpleasing in style, full of false modesty and genuine superciliousness, full of real ignorance and false affectation of learning\\".Field (1981), p. 231 German Jewish groups like the Centralverein deutscher Staatsb√ºrger j√ºdischen Glaubens and the Verein zur Abwehr des Antisemitismus repeatedly issued statements in the early 20th century that the popularity of The Foundations was a major source of concern for them, noting that Die Grundlagen had caused a major increase in anti-Semitism with many German Jews now finding themselves the objects of harassment and sometimes violence.Field (1981), pp. 245‚Äì47 The German Jewish journalist Moritz Goldstein wrote in 1912 that he had become a Zionist because he believed there was no future for Jews in Germany, and one of the reasons for that belief was: \\"Chamberlain believes what he says and for that very reason his distortions shock me. And thousands more believe as he does for the book goes one edition after another and I would still like to know if many Germanic types, whose self-image is pleasantly indulged by this theory, are able to remain critical enough to question its countless injustices and errors?\\" Goldstein added that the case of Chamberlain showed his views as typical of those of \\"the best spirits, clever, truth-loving men who, however, as soon they speak of Jews, fall into a blind, almost rabid hatred\\". Portrait by Franz von Lenbach, c. 1902 Evangelist of Race = Visit to England and attack on its Jews = In 1900, for the first time in decades, Chamberlain visited Britain, a place he disparagingly called \\"the land of the Boer-eaters\\".Field (1981), p. 359 Writing to Cosima Wagner from London, Chamberlain stated sadly that his Britain, the Britain of aristocratic rule, hard work and manly courage, the romanticized \\"Merry Old England\\" of his imagination was no more; it had been replaced by what Chamberlain saw as a materialist, soulless society, atomized into individuals with no sense of the collective purpose and entirely dominated by greed.Field (1981), p. 358 Chamberlain wrote that since the 1880s Britain had \\"chosen the service of Mammon\\", for which he blamed the Jews, writing to Wagner: \\"This is the result, when one has studied politics with a Jew for a quarter century.\\" The \\"Jew\\" Chamberlain was referring to was Disraeli, whom Chamberlain had always hated with a passion. Chamberlain concluded: \\"My old England was nowhere recognizable.\\" Chamberlain declared in his letter that all British businessmen were now dishonest; the middle class, smug and stupid; small farmers and shops were no longer able to compete with Jewish-owned big business; and the monarchy was \\"irretrievably weakened\\" by social change. In short, for Chamberlain Britain was no longer his country. = German superiority to rule the world = In the summer of 1900, Chamberlain wrote an essay in the magazine Jugend, where he declared that: \\"The reign of Wilhelm II has the character of the dawning of a new day.\\"R√∂hl (2004), p. 1040 Chamberlain went on to write that Wilhelm was \\"in fact the first German Kaiser\\" who knew his mission was to \\"ennoble\\" the world by spreading \\"German knowledge, German philosophy, German art and‚Äîif God wills‚ÄîGerman religion. Only a Kaiser who undertakes this task is a true Kaiser of the German people.\\"R√∂hl (2004), pp. 1040‚Äì41 To allow Germany to become a world power, Chamberlain called for the Reich to become the world's greatest sea power, as Chamberlain asserted that whatever power rules the seas also rules the world.R√∂hl (2004), p. 1041 Chamberlain wrote that \\"without a fleet nothing can be done. But equipped with a great fleet, Germany is embarking on the course to which Cromwell showed England the way, and she can and must steer resolutely towards the goal of becoming the first power in the world. She has the moral justification for it and therefore also the duty.\\" = Kaiser Wilhelm II = In early 1901, the German Emperor Wilhelm II read The Foundations and was immensely impressed with the book.Field (1981), p. 249 The Imperial Grand Chamberlain at the court, Ulrich von B√ºlow, the brother of the Chancellor Prince Bernhard von B√ºlow, wrote in a letter to a friend in January 1901 that the Kaiser was \\"studying the book a second time page by page\\". In November 1901, Chamberlain's friend, the German diplomat and courtier Prince Philip von Eulenburg, who happened to be the best friend of Wilhelm II, introduced Chamberlain to the Kaiser. Chamberlain and Wilhelm first met at Eulenburg's estate at Liebenberg and soon became very good friends, maintaining a regular correspondence which continued until Chamberlain's death in 1927. To reach Liebenberg from Vienna, Chamberlain had first to take a train to Berlin, and then board another train to Liebenberg. Chamberlain's meeting with the Kaiser was considered so important that when Chamberlain reached Berlin, he was met by the Chancellor Prince Bernhard von B√ºlow, who joined him on the trip to Liebenberg. During the train ride, B√ºlow and Chamberlain had a long discussion about The Foundations and then French literature. Upon reaching the gates of Liebenberg in the evening, Chamberlain and B√ºlow were met by Wilhelm and Eulenburg who were surrounded by servants carrying torches.Field (1981), p. 250 When he met Chamberlain for the first time, Wilhelm told him: \\"I thank you for what you have done for Germany!\\" The next day, Eulenburg wrote to a friend that the Emperor \\"stood completely under the spell of this man [Chamberlain], whom he understood better than any of the other guests because of his thorough study of The Foundations\\". Until Chamberlain's death, he and Wilhelm had what the American historian Geoffrey Field called \\"a warm, personal bond\\", which was expressed in a series of \\"... elaborate, wordy letters, full of mutual admiration and half-baked ideas\\". The Wilhelm‚ÄìChamberlain letters were full of \\"the perplexing thought world of mystical and racist conservatism\\". They ranged far and wide in subject matter: the ennobling mission of the Germanic race, the corroding forces of Ultramontanism, materialism and the \\"destructive poison\\" of Judentum were favorite themes.Field (1981), pp. 250‚Äì51 Other subjects often discussed in the Wilhelm-Chamberlain letters were the dangers posed to the Reich by the \\"Yellow Peril\\", \\"Tartarized Slavdom\\", and the \\"black hordes\\".Field (1981), p. 252 In 1901, Wilhelm informed Chamberlain in a letter that: \\"God sent your book to the German people, just as he sent you personally to me, that is my unshakably firm conviction.\\"R√∂hl (2004), p. 205 Wilhelm went on to praise Chamberlain as his \\"comrade-in-arms and ally in the struggle for Teutons against Rome, Jerusalem, etc.\\" In 1902, Wilhelm wrote another letter in which he told Chamberlain: \\"May you save our German Volk, our Germanentum, for God has sent you as our helper!\\" Chamberlain in his turn advised Wilhelm to create \\"a racially aware ... centrally organised Germany with a clear sense of purpose, a Germany which would 'rule the world'\\". In 1903, Chamberlain wrote to Wilhelm to claim that as in the last decadent days of Rome, \\"the civis britannicus is now become a purely political concept\\" with no racial content being involved.Buruma (2000) p.221 Chamberlain wrote with disgust how for two shillings and a sixpence, \\"every Basuto nigger\\" could now carry a British passport. Chamberlain went on to predict within the next fifty years \\"the English aristocracy will be nothing but a money oligarchy, without a shred of racial solidarity or relation to the throne.\\" Chamberlain went on to deplore the practice of raising businessmen to the peerage in Britain, contemptuously declaring that in Britain mere \\"brewers, ink manufacturers and ship-owners\\" now sat in the House of Lords. Chamberlain ended his letter to the Kaiser by calling the general British public \\"a herd which has no will and which a few newspapers and handful of politicians manipulate as they wish\\". Wilhelm's later concept of \\"Juda-England\\", of a decaying Britain sucked dried by Jewish capitalists, owed much to Chamberlain. The Dutch journalist Ian Buruma described Chamberlain's letters to the Kaiser as pushing his \\"... Anglophobic, anti-Semitic, Germanophile ideas to the point of murderous lunacy\\". The liberal Berliner Zeitung newspaper complained in an editorial of the close friendship between Wilhelm II and such an outspoken racist and anti-Semite as Chamberlain, stating this was a real cause for concern for decent, caring people both inside and outside Germany.Field (1981), p. 251 = Admiring England and loathing it = For Wilhelm, all pride about being German had a certain ambivalence, as he was in fact half-British.Buruma (2000) pp. 210‚Äì11 In an age of ultra-nationalism with identities being increasingly defined in racial terms, his mixed heritage imposed considerable psychological strain on Wilhelm, who managed at one and the same time to be both an Anglophile and Anglophobe; he was a man who both loved and hated the British, and his writings about the land of his mother displayed both extreme admiration and loathing. Buruma observed that for all his much-vaunted beliefs in public about the superiority of everything German, in private Wilhelm often displayed signs of an inferiority complex to the British, as if he really felt deep down that it was Britain, not Germany, that was the world's greatest country. For Wilhelm, someone like Chamberlain, the Englishman who came to Germany to praise the Fatherland as the world's greatest nation, and who had \\"scientifically\\" proven that \\"fact\\" in The Foundations, was a \\"dream come true\\" for him.Buruma (2000) pp. 219‚Äì20 Writing about the Chamberlain-Wilhelm relationship, Field stated: > Chamberlain helped place Wilhelm's tangled and vaguely formulated fears of > Pan Slavism, the black and yellow \\"hordes\\", Jews, Ultramontanes, Social > Democrats, and free-thinkers to a global and historical framework copiously > footnoted and sustained by a vast array of erudite information. He elevated > the Emperor's dream of a German mission into an elaborate vision of divinely > ordained, racial destiny. The lack of precision, the muddle, and logical > flaws that are so apparent to modern readers of The Foundations did not > bother Wilhelm: he eagerly submitted to its subjective, irrational style of > reasoning. ... And if the Kaiser was a Prussian with an ingrained respect > for English values and habits, Chamberlain was just as much an Englishman > who was deeply ambivalent about his own birthplace and who revered German > qualities and Prussian society. Almost unconsciously, as his vast > correspondence shows, he adopted an obsequious, scraping tone when > addressing the lowliest of Prussian army officers. If Wilhelm was drawn to > the very Englishness of Chamberlain, the author of The Foundations saw in > the Hohenzollern prince‚Äîat least until the World War‚Äîthe very symbol of his > idealized Deutschtum.Field (1981), pp. 254 & 261 Chamberlain, who in the words of Buruma was \\"an English fetishist of German blood\\" who wrote long pseudo-scientific articles about how \\"Germanic racial genius\\" manifested itself in the cultural works of Richard Wagner, Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, Ludwig van Beethoven, and William Shakespeare (Chamberlain considered Shakespeare to be a \\"Germanic playwright\\" who properly belonged to Germany), was the \\"perfect match\\" for Wilhelm. Chamberlain frequently wrote to an appreciative and admiring Wilhelm telling him that it was only the noble \\"German spirit\\" which was saving the world from being destroyed by a \\"deracinated Yankee-Anglo-Jewish materialism\\".Buruma (1998), p. 219 Finally, Wilhelm was also a Wagnerite and found much to admire in Chamberlain's writings praising Wagner's music as a mystical, spiritual life- force that embodied all that was great about the \\"German spirit\\". = 'The Foundations' book success = The success of The Foundations made Chamberlain famous all over the world. In 1906, the Brazilian intellectual S√≠lvio Romero cited Chamberlain together with Otto Ammon, Georges Vacher de Lapouge and Arthur de Gobineau as having proved that the blond \\"dolichocephalic\\" people of northern Europe were the best and greatest race in the entire world, and urged that Brazil could become a great nation by a huge influx of German immigrants who would achieve the embranquecimento (whitening) of Brazil.Skidmore, Thomas (1993) Black Into White: Race and Nationality in Brazilian Thought, Durnham: Duke University Press. p. 56 Chamberlain received invitations to lecture on his racial theories at Yale and Johns Hopkins universities, but turned them down on the grounds that he had no wish to visit what he viewed as a culturally and spiritually debased nation like the United States.  Not family with Joseph and Neville Chamberlain  When the book was first published, reviewers often asked who this Chamberlain was, and there was much fevered speculation in the German press as to whether Chamberlain was related to Joseph Chamberlain, the British Colonial Secretary who, as the principal author of the British forward policy in South Africa, was one of the most detested men in the Reich. Several German magazines mistakenly printed pictures of Joseph Chamberlain's sons, Austen Chamberlain and Neville Chamberlain, identifying them as the author of The Foundations. Many Germans breathed a collective sigh of relief when it was subsequently established that Houston Stewart Chamberlain was not related to the famous Chamberlain family of Birmingham. = The Chamberlain circle = After the success of The Foundations, a Chamberlain Kreis (circle) appeared in Vienna that comprised the Indologist Leopold von Schroeder, Count Ulrich von B√ºlow; Countess Melanie Metternich-Zichy, Countess Marietta von Coundenhove, Baroness Emma von Ehrenfels, the music critic and Wagnerite Gustav Schonaich, Count Ulrich von Brockdorff-Rantzau, Count Hermann Keyserling and Rudolf Kassner who met weekly at Chamberlain's home to discuss his racial theories.Field (1981), p. 321 = Personal life and financials = It was during this period that Chamberlain had an affair with Baroness von Ehrenfels, the wife of his friend Baron Christian von Ehrenfels and another affair with a Viennese showgirl, Lili Petri.Field (1981), p. 348 In 1906, his marriage to Anna ended in divorce.Field (1981), p. 336 Besides the income from sales of The Foundations and the essays he was constantly writing for newspapers and journals, Chamberlain was supported financially by a wealthy German piano-manufacturer, August Ludowici (who liked Chamberlain so much that he purchased a house for him), and by the Swiss industrialist Ag√©nor Boissier, giving an annual income of about 30,000‚Äì40,000 marks (by contrast a German school-teacher had an annual income of 1,000 marks, while a professor made about 12,000 marks per year).Field (1981), pp. 337‚Äì38 In 1908, after Cosima Wagner suggested the match, Chamberlain married Wagner's daughter Eva von B√ºlow. He was extremely happy to be married to the daughter of his hero Wagner.Field (1981), pp. 347‚Äì50 = Chamberlain's character = Chamberlain, the self-proclaimed \\"Evangelist of Race\\", saw himself as a prophet, writing to the Kaiser: \\"Today, God relies only on the Germans. That is the knowledge, the sure truth, which has filled my soul for years; I have sacrificed my peace in serving it; for it I shall live and die.\\"Field (1981), p. 325 Eulenburg recalled that under his quiet demeanor Chamberlain had a \\"fiery spirit with those eyes and looks which speak volumes\\". The few who knew Chamberlain well described him as a quiet, reserved man full of urbane erudition and charm; a modest, genial character with elegant manners dressed in expensive suits who could talk brilliantly and with much wit about a great number of subjects for hours. But under his polished surface, Chamberlain had a \\"fanatical and obsessive\\" side. His copious notebooks and letters show a man with \\"a profoundly irrational mind\\", a markedly sadistic and deeply paranoid individual who believed himself to be the victim of a monstrous worldwide Jewish conspiracy to destroy him.Field (1981), pp. 325‚Äì26 Chamberlain's status as a semi-recluse came about because of his fear that the Jews were plotting his murder. = German world dominance by race = A strong imperialist, Chamberlain was naturally a fervent supporter of Weltpolitik, under which Germany sought to become the world's dominant power, which he justified on racist grounds. In 1904, when the German government committed the Herero and Namaqua Genocide against the Herero and Namaqua peoples in German South-West Africa (modern Namibia), Chamberlain congratulated Wilhelm in a letter for his genocidal policies, praising the Kaiser for his \\"war of extermination\\", which was \\"a fine example\\" of how Aryans should deal with \\"niggers\\".Fraser (January 1990), p. 414 In a 1906 letter to Wilhelm, Chamberlain announced that due to miscegenation caused by the Jews, Britain, France, Austria and Russia were all declining powers, and only the \\"pure\\" German Reich was capable of protecting the \\"life-giving center of Western Europe\\" from the \\"Tartarized Russians, the dreaming weakly mongrels of Oceania and South America, and the millions of blacks, impoverished in intellect and bestially inclined, who even now are arming for the war of the races in which there will be no quarter given\\". Thus, Chamberlain wrote to Wilhelm, German Weltpolitik was a \\"sacred mission\\" to protect the superior races and cultures from the inferior. Chamberlain concluded his letter that the ideas of white supremacy had \\"not only justified the vast aggressions of Russia and England in the nineteenth century, but it also sanctions beforehand all that Germany may choose to appropriate in the twentieth\\". = Antisemite Eulenburg's Homosexuality = In 1908, the Harden‚ÄìEulenburg affair badly damaged Wilhelm's reputation when Wilhelm's and Chamberlain's mutual friend Eulenburg was exposed in the press as a homosexual. Since Eulenburg had been the Emperor's best friend since 1886, the scandal led to much gossip all over the Reich about whether Wilhelm and Eulenburg had been more than just best friends. Eulenburg was quite open about being gay when he was in the company of his closest friends, and he and Wilhelm had been the very best of friends for 22 years, leading the British historian John C. G. R√∂hl to conclude it was very unlikely that Wilhelm was ignorant of Eulenburg's sexual orientation as he claimed after Eulenburg was outed.R√∂hl (2004), pp. 61‚Äì62 After Eulenburg was exposed, the Kaiser wrote him a very cold letter saying that he could not stand the company of homosexuals, as such their friendship was now over and he never wanted to see or hear from Eulenburg again. Chamberlain was never as close to Eulenburg as Wilhelm was, and seemed genuinely shocked to learn of the allegations that Eulenburg was gay.Field (1981), p. 260 The Eulenburg affair played a role in Germany very similar to the Dreyfus affair in France, except that the victim in this case was the prominent anti-Semite Eulenburg. During the scandal, practically the entire v√∂lkisch movement came out in support of Eulenburg whom they portrayed as an Aryan heterosexual framed by false allegations of homosexuality by the Jews Max Bernstein and Magnus Hirschfeld.Domeier (2015), p. 169 The German journalist Theodor Wolff wrote in 1906 about Eulenburg's role as one of Germany's chief anti-Semites: > I bet you ten to one that it was that skald [Eulenburg], the friend and > admirer of Gobineau, who first pointed his other friend, the Kaiser towards > the racial prophet's most eager disciple, Houston Stewart Chamberlain. The > mystical notion of the \\"race that will bring order to the world\\" found its > way from Gobineau via Eulenburg and Chamberlain to the Kaiser, and this > notion in turn gave rise to the thought that \\"the world should be healed by > the German spirit.\\"Domeier (2015) p. 172 In a letter to Chamberlain, Wilhelm wrote that entire scandal had emerged because of \\"Jewish cheek, slander and lies\\".R√∂hl (2004), p. 206 In the same letter, an enraged Wilhelm told Chamberlain that Maximilian Harden, the German Jewish convert to Lutheranism and the journalist who had outed Eulenburg was a \\"loathsome, dirty Jewish fiend\\" and a \\"poisonous toad out of the slime of hell, a disgraceful stain on our Volk\\". However, despite his strongly held anti-Semitism and his frequently expressed wish to expel the entire German Jewish community, the Kaiser held back under the grounds that if he expelled all of the Jews from Germany, it would set the German economy back by a century, and as such, he had to grudgingly tolerate his Jewish subjects.R√∂hl (2004), pp. 206‚Äì07 = Toning down attacks on Catholicism = As a part of his role as the \\"Evangelist of Race\\", Chamberlain toned down his anti-Catholicism in the first decade of the 20th century, realizing belatedly that his attacks on the Catholic Church in The Foundations had alienated the German Catholic community from his message.Field (1981), pp. 307‚Äì09 = Themes: German unity and German science and philosophy = As a well-known public intellectual, Chamberlain wrote on numerous subjects in a vast array of newspapers and magazines. Besides attacking the Jews, one of the chief themes of Chamberlain's essays was the unity of German culture, language, race and art, and the need for the unity of German art with a racialized \\"Germanic Christianity\\".Field (1981), pp. 310‚Äì11 The other major theme of Chamberlain's work was science and philosophy. Chamberlain was always keenly interested in modern science and saw himself as a scientist, but he was deeply critical of the claim that modern science could explain everything, believing there was a spiritual side to humanity that science could not explain.Field (1981), pp. 280‚Äì81 As such, Chamberlain believed that modern Germany was being destroyed by people losing their spiritual aspects owing to the materialist belief that science could explain all.Field (1981), p. 281 In his 1905 biography of one of his heroes, the philosopher Immanuel Kant, Chamberlain argued that Kant had shown the limits of rationalism and reason for understanding the world.Field (1981), p. 283 Instead, Chamberlain argued that Kant had shown that the instinctive approach based on intuition was a far more valid way of understanding the world. Inevitably, Chamberlain's \\"Kantian\\" way of understanding science was used to attack the Jews, with Chamberlain writing: ::\\"In order to understand Kant we must ... begin by once and for all getting rid of the heavy burden of inherited and indoctrinated Jewish conceptions.\\"Field (1981), p. 284 In the same way, Chamberlain's 1912 biography of another of his heroes, Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, was used to pass on the same message. Chamberlain depicted Goethe as a \\"Kantian\\" man who had correctly embraced both the rational, scientific approaches to life and the instinctive, mystical approach to achieve a synthesis that embraced the best of both worlds.Field (1981), pp. 287‚Äì90 Again, Chamberlain used Goethe as a way of bashing the Jews, with Chamberlain claiming that Goethe had favored banning sexual relations between Aryans and Jews and was a man who would not have \\"suffered among us\\" the Jewish artists, journalists, and professors of modern Germany.Field (1981), p. 290 The German Jewish journal Im deutschen Reich wrote in a review of Goethe that Chamberlain had appropriated Goethe in \\"a polemic about race politics, racial hygiene and racial worth from the standpoint of a monomaniacal Judeophobia\\". = Embracing Treitschke = The policies of Weltpolitik, especially the Tirpitz Plan, brought about a period of Anglo-German tension in the first years of the 20th century. Chamberlain, who detested the land of his birth, had no trouble taking sides in the emerging Anglo-German antagonism. Chamberlain, who came to hate Britain, expressed his approval of the writings of the Anglophobic and anti-Semitic German historian Heinrich von Treitschke, whose view of Britain as a grasping, greedy nation of cheap traders dishonestly vacuuming up the world's wealth was the same as his own. In another letter to Wilhelm, Chamberlain wrote: \\"There are periods, when history is, as it were, woven on a loom ... in such a way that the warp and woof are established and are essentially unalterable; but then come times when the threads are introduced for a new fabric, when the time of material and the design must first be determined. ... We find ourselves in such a time today.\\"Field (1981), pp .359‚Äì60 = Necessary German power = Chamberlain declared to Wilhelm that Germany now had to become the world's greatest power, both for its own good and for the good of the rest of the world.Field (1981), p. 360 In his letter, Chamberlain dismissed France as a second-rate nation that could only fall further; Russia was a nation of \\"stupid\\" Slavs which was only just being held together because Nicholas II had German blood; without the German blood in the House of Romanov \\"nothing would remain but a decaying mati√®re brute\\" in Russia; and Britain was clearly declining into a bottomless pit of greed, ineffective democratic politics and unrestrained individualism. Chamberlain was very anti-American and called the United States a \\"Dollar dynasty\\", writing: > From dollars only dollars can come, nothing else; spiritually America will > live only so long as the stream of European spiritual power flows there, not > a moment longer. That part of the world, it may be proven, creates > sterility, it has as little of a future as it has a past. Chamberlain concluded his letter to Wilhelm that: \\"The future progress of mankind depends on a powerful Germany extending far across the earth.\\" To this end, Chamberlain advocated German expansionism both in Europe and all over the world; building the High Seas Fleet which would break the British mastery of the seas; and restructuring German society along the lines advocated by the extreme right-wing v√∂lkisch Pan-German League.Field (1981), pp. 360‚Äì61 Bust of Chamberlain (c. 1914), from an unfinished clay model for a bust by Joseph Hinterbeher Propagandist of the World War In August 1914, he started suffering from a progressive paralysis of the limbs. At the end of the war, Chamberlain's paralysis had already befallen much of his body; his chronically bad health had reached its final stage. By the time World War I started in 1914, Chamberlain remained British only by virtue of his name and nationality. When the war started, Chamberlain tried to enlist in the German Army, but was turned down on the account of his age (then 58) and bad health.Field (1981), p.363 In August 1914, Chamberlain wrote a letter to his brother, the Japanologist Basil Hall Chamberlain, explaining why he had sided with his adopted country that read: \\"No war has ever been simpler than this; England has not for a moment reduced her efforts to do everything humanly possible to bring it about and to destroy every peaceful impulse. ... Germany's victory will not be England's ruin; quite the contrary, it is the only hope for England's rescue from the total ruin in which she now stands. England's victory will be terrible for the whole world, a catastrophe.\\"Field (1981), p. 352 The same month, Chamberlain published an essay celebrating Wilhelm II as an \\"Aryan soldier-king\\" and as a \\"Siegfried\\" who had embraced the \\"struggle against the corroding poison of Jewry\\".R√∂hl (2004), p. 207 Chamberlain went on to call the war \\"a life-or-death struggle ... between two human ideals: the German and the un-German\\". Accordingly, the Reich must \\"for the next hundred years or more\\" strengthen all things German and carry out \\"the determined extermination of the un-German\\". Chamberlain happily welcomed the war, writing in September 1914 to his friend Prince Max of Baden: \\"I thank God that I have been allowed to experience these two exaltations‚Äî1870 and 1914‚Äîand that I was both times in Germany and saw the truth with my own eyes.\\"Field (1981), p. 381 In his 1914 essay, \\"Whose Fault Is the War?\\", Chamberlain blamed the war on France, Russia and especially Britain.Field (1981), p. 365 Chamberlain argued though St. Petersburg and Paris were both seeking war, it was London who had masterminded the war, and the French and Russians were just British puppets.Field (1981), pp. 365‚Äì66 Initially Chamberlain expected the war to be over by the end of 1914, and was very disappointed when that did not occur. In 1916 he also acquired German citizenship. He had already begun propagandising on behalf of the German government and continued to do so throughout the war. His vociferous denunciations of his land of birth, it has been posited,Adorno, Theodor W. (1985) \\"On the Question: \\"What is German?\\", Levin, Thomas Y. (trans.) in New German Critique, No. 36. 1985. p.123 were the culmination of his rejection of his native England's capitalism, in favour of a form of German Romanticism akin to that which he had cultivated in himself during his years at Cheltenham. The British historian John C. G. R√∂hl wrote the war made the \\"brutality in general and anti-Semitism in particular\\" of people like the Kaiser and Chamberlain \\"more intense\\". During World War I, Chamberlain published several propaganda texts against his country of birth‚ÄîKriegsaufs√§tze (Wartime Essays). In the first four tracts, he maintained that Germany is a nation of peace; England's political system is a sham, while Germany exhibits true freedom; German is the greatest and only remaining \\"living\\" language; and the world would be better off doing away with English and French-styled parliamentary governments in favour of German rule \\"thought out by a few and carried out with iron consequence\\". The final two discuss England and Germany at length.Chamberlain, Houston Stewart (1915) The Ravings of a Renegade: Being the War Essays of Houston Stewart Chamberlain. Charles H. Clark (trans.). London: Jarrold and Sons Chamberlain's basic argument was that democracy was an idiotic system as equality was a myth‚Äîhumans were very different with different abilities and talents, so democratic equality where the opinions of one voter mattered much as the opinions of the next was a completely flawed idea.Field (1981), pp. 368‚Äì69 Quoting the French scientist Gustave Le Bon, Chamberlain wrote the vast majority of people were simply too stupid to properly understand the issues, and as such Germany with its rule by elites was a much better governed nation than France.Field (1981), p. 369 In Germany, Chamberlain asserted, true freedom existed, as freedom came from the state alone which made it possible for society to function, not the individual as was the case in Britain and France, which Chamberlain claimed was a recipe for chaos.Field (1981), p. 368 Field summarized Chamberlain's thesis \\"... the essence of German freedom was the willing submission as a matter of conscience to legitimately constituted authorities; it implied duty more than rights and was something spiritual and internal for which each moral being had to strive. Consigning 'liberty' to an inner, 'nonpolitical' moral realm, Chamberlain closed off any discussion of the specific conditions for a free society and simply asserted that freedom was perfectly compatible with an authoritarian system of government.\\" Quoting‚Äîsometimes wildly out of context‚Äîvarious British, French and American authors, such as John Richard Green, William Edward Hartpole Lecky, John Robert Seeley, John Ruskin, Thomas Carlyle, Paul Bourget, Francis Delaisi, James Bryce, John Burgess, Woodrow Wilson, and H. G. Wells, Chamberlain argued that in democratic states, it was always big business that was really in charge; as such democracy was a fraud and democratic governments only served the rich; and democratic states only existed \\"to further the interests of money making all over the globe\\".Field (1981), pp. 367‚Äì71 Chamberlain's attacks on democracy as a sham designed to allow \\"Jewish plutocrats\\" to rule the world were not only very anti-British and anti-French, but also anti-American.Field (1981), pp. 368‚Äì71 Right from the start of the war, Chamberlain attacked all democratic governments in the world including the neutral United States as a fraud perpetrated by the Jews.Field (1981), pp. 370‚Äì71 Chamberlain wrote that America \\"is a hellish whirlpool, in which all the contradictions of the world, all the greed, envy and lust brew and simmer; a wild struggle of millions of ignorant egotists, men without ideas, ideals, or traditions, without shared values, without any capacity for sacrifice, an atomic chaos endowed with no true power of nature\\".Field (1981), p. 371 Until the United States entered the war in 1917, the Ausw√§rtiges Amt worked hard to prevent Chamberlain's essays with their strong anti-American content from appearing abroad out of the fear that they would offend opinion in America. Chamberlain's wartime writings also gained much attention ‚Äì albeit of a highly negative sort ‚Äì in his native Britain, with The Times Literary Supplement declaring: \\"The most ignorant of the Germans has not written greater nonsense.\\"Field (1981), p. 366. In 1915, an unauthorised translation of Chamberlain's wartime essays was published in London under the unflattering title of The Ravings of a Renegade. In his 1915 pamphlet Deutschland und England (Germany and England), Chamberlain vigorously took the side of his adopted land against the land of his birth. Chamberlain explained in Germany and England how the British were once noble Aryans like the Germans who lived in a perfect rigidly hierarchical, romantically rural \\"unmixed\\" society, but then starting in the 16th century capitalism had corrupted the English. Capitalism had turned the English into an urban nation dominated by a vulgar money-grubbing, philistine middle class incapable of any sort of culture. The beautiful English countryside, which Chamberlain claimed was once the home of an idyllic agrarian society, had become an ugly urban landscape full of polluting factories owned by greedy Jewish capitalists. Even worse in Chamberlain's opinion, capitalism had led the English into a process of racial degeneration, democracy and rule by the Jews. Chamberlain wrote with disgust how the sons of the English aristocracy \\"disappear from society to make money\\", leading to a warped \\"moral compass\\" on their part in contrast to Germany where the Junkers either tended to their estates or had careers in the Army. Chamberlain's discussion of Britain ended with the lament that his idealised \\"Merry Old England\\" no longer existed, with Chamberlain writing: > We were merry, we are merry no longer. The complete decline of country life > and the equally complete victory of God Mammon, the deity of Industry and > Trade, have caused the true, harmless, refreshing merriness to betake itself > out of England. Germany by contrast in Chamberlain's view, had preserved its racial purity and by having an authoritarian government and a welfare state, had avoided both laissez-faire capitalism and Jewish rule.Buruma (200), pp. 220‚Äì221 It was for this reason that Chamberlain alleged that Britain had started World War I in 1914 to destroy Germany. For all these reasons Chamberlain stated he had come to hate Britain and love Germany, as Germany had preserved everything that Chamberlain considered to be noble in humanity while Britain had long since lost its nobility of spirit. Chamberlain received the Iron Cross from the Kaiser, with whom he was in regular correspondence, in 1916.Shirer (1959), p. 108 By this time, Chamberlain's obsessive anti-Semitism had reached the point that Chamberlain was suffering from nightmares in which he was kidnapped and sentenced to death by the Jews. In 1915, Chamberlain wrote proudly in a letter to a friend that: \\"My lawyer friend in Munich tells me there is no living being whom the Jews hate more than I.\\" In another essay, Chamberlain wrote the \\"pure Germanic force\\" had to be saved from the \\"disgusting worm\\" (the phrase \\"disgusting worm\\" was often used by Wagner to describe the Jews). Chamberlain wrote the purpose of this \\"struggle\\" was \\"salvation from the claws of the un- German and anti-German\\", going on to quote from Wagner's 1850 anti-Semitic essay Das Judenthum in der Musik that \\"Against this devil's brood stands Germany as God's champion: Siegfried against the worm!\\" During the war years, Chamberlain was one of the \\"annexationists\\" who wanted the war to end with Germany annexing most of Europe, Africa and Asia to give the Reich the \\"world power status\\" he believed it deserved.Field (1981), pp. 381‚Äì82 As such, Chamberlain worked closely with the Pan-German League, the Conservatives and the v√∂lkische groups to mobilise public support for the maximum war aims he sought. Chamberlain was a founding member of the Independent Commission for a German Peace, and in July 1915 he signed the Address of the Intellectuals, a petition signed by 1,347 teachers, writers, professors, and theologians asking the government to win the war in order to annex as much territory as possible. Much of this propaganda including Chamberlain's essays in support of the maximum war aims had a very strong anti-Semitic character, as Chamberlain claimed that it was the entire German Jewish community who were supposedly seeking a compromise peace to end the war, and were preventing the full mobilization of Germany's power that would allow the Reich to win the war.Field (1981), p. 382 In a letter to his friend Prince Maximilian of Baden, Chamberlain wrote: > I learned today from a man who is especially well-placed to observe these > things‚Äîeven when they go on secretly‚Äîthat the Jews are completely > intoxicated by their success in Germany‚Äîfirst from the millions they have > gained through the war, then because of the praise showered on them in all > official quarters, and thirdly from the protection they and their > machinations enjoy from the censor. Thus, already they are beginning to lose > their heads and reach a degree of insolence which may allow us to hope for a > flood-tide of reaction. May God grant it!. In October‚ÄìNovember 1916, the so-called Judenz√§hlung (\\"Jew count\\") was held by the German Army to examine the popular anti-Semitic claim that German Jews were \\"shirking\\" their duty to the Fatherland by avoiding war service.Field (1981), pp. 386‚Äì87 The \\"Jew count\\" revealed that in fact German Jews were disproportionately over-represented in the front-line units, as most German Jews were anxious to prove their German patriotism and love of the Fatherland by volunteering for front-line duty. Many young German Jewish men wished to rebut the anti-Semitic canard that they were not real Germans by fighting for the Fatherland, and thus showing that they loved Germany as much as their Gentile neighbors, hence the disproportionate number of German Jews on the front-line compared to their share of the German population.Wette (2006), pp. 34-37 As the results of the \\"Jew count\\" did not please the two men in charge of High Command, namely Field Marshal Paul von Hindenburg and General Erich Ludendorff, the latter a \\"fanatical anti-Semite\\" who had been expecting the \\"Jew Count\\" to reveal that German Jews were disproportionally underrepresented on the front-line, the High Command issued a facetious statement saying that for the safety of the German Jewish community the \\"Jew count\\" could not be made public, as it would endanger the lives of German Jews.Wette, (2006), p. 37 The implication that if people could see just how far German Jews were allegedly \\"shirking\\" their duty to the Fatherland, then pogroms would break out in Germany led to a major upsurge in anti-Semitism, which Chamberlain was quick to exploit.Field (1981), p. 387 In support of a harder line both in the war and on the home front, Chamberlain involved himself in the intrigues to oust Theobald von Bethmann-Hollweg as Chancellor and replace him with the \\"hard man\\", Admiral Alfred von Tirpitz.Field (1981), p. 383 In Chamberlain's opinion, if only Germany were to wage the war more ruthlessly and brutally, then the war would be won.Field (1981), pp. 383‚Äì84 Chamberlain loathed Bethmann-Hollweg whom he saw as an inept leader who simply did not have the will to win. Chamberlain had an unbounded confidence in the ability of the Army and Navy to win the war, but on the home front, Chamberlain believed the Reich was \\"leaderless\\" as he viewed Bethmann-Hollweg as a Jewish \\"puppet\\" unwilling and unable to stop defeatism, corruption or the demand for more democracy. Besides supporting Tirpitz as Chancellor, Chamberlain was all for adopting unrestricted submarine warfare‚Äîeven at the risk of provoking the United States into the war‚Äîas the best way of starving Britain into surrender.Field (1981), p. 384 Chamberlain was also a very public supporter of Zeppelin raids to destroy British cities. After a discussion with his friend and admirer, Count Ferdinand von Zeppelin, Chamberlain published a newspaper essay in July 1915 complaining that the government had imposed far too many restrictions on Zeppelin raids in order to save innocent British lives, and he argued that his country should bomb British cities with no concern for lives of civilians as ordinary British people deserved to die. The campaign by the annexationists against Bethmann-Hollweg was in large part motivated by the fact that the annexationists believed that Bethmann-Hollweg was not one of them. Had Chamberlain or any of the other annexationists been aware of the secret September Programme of 1914, where Bethmann-Hollweg planned to announce his intentions for annexing much of Europe and Africa after the soon to be expected fall of Paris, they would have had a different opinion of Bethmann- Hollweg.Fraser (January 1990), pp. 410-24 Under the constitution of 1871, the Reichstag had limited powers, but one of those was the right to vote on the budget. In the 1912 Reichstag elections, the anti-militarist Social Democrats had won the largest number of seats in the Reichstag. Thus Bethmann-Hollweg had to work with the SPD to get the budgets passed to finance the war. In August 1914, the government had been able to persuade the majority of the SPD to support the war on the grounds that Russia was supposedly about to attack Germany. The SPD broke into two; the Majority Social Democrats supported the war while the minority Independent Social Democrats stayed true to their pacifist beliefs and opposed the war. The Majority Social Democrats agreed to support the war to the extent it was portrayed as a defensive struggle against Russia, but the Majority SPD wanted nothing to do with the annexationists. Hence, Bethmann-Hollweg's refusal to support the annexationists in public was due to pragmatic political considerations, namely, his need for majority Social Democratic co-operation in the Reichstag as opposed to being against the annexationists as Chamberlain mistakenly believed.Fraser (January 1990), p. 410 If the parties supporting annexationists, such as the Conservatives, National Liberals and Free Conservatives, had done better in the 1912 elections, Bethmann-Hollweg would almost certainly have taken a different line in public regarding the demands of the annexationists. Much of Chamberlain's strident, aggressive and embittered rhetoric reflected the fact that the annexationists were a minority in Germany, albeit a significant, vocal, well organised minority with many influential members inside and outside the government, but a minority nonetheless.Fraser (January 1990), p. 419 The majority of the German people did not support the annexationists. Chamberlain regarded the refusal of the democratic parties like the left-wing SPD, the right-of-the-centre Zentrum and the liberal Progressives to join the annexationist movement as essentially high treason. In August 1916, there occurred what amounted to a military coup d'√©tat when Field Marshal Paul von Hindenburg and General Erich Ludendorff informed Wilhelm and Bethmann-Hollweg that henceforward the Army would no longer obey either the Kaiser or the government, and that from now the Emperor and the Chancellor would now obey the Army. In July 1917 Hindenburg and Ludendorff had Bethmann-Hollweg dismissed and replaced with Georg Michaelis as Chancellor. Chamberlain's preferred candidate as Chancellor, Admiral Tirpitz, was passed over. Tirpitz was an intelligent, media-savvy, charismatic political intriguer with a desperate hunger for political power, but the duumvirate of Hindenburg and Ludendorff regarded Tirpitz as Chancellor as too much of a threat to their own power. In response to the firing of Bethmann-Hollweg, the democratic parties decided to protest by passing a peace resolution. The Reichstag Peace Resolution of July 1917‚Äîin which the SPD, Zentrum and the Progressives all joined forces to vote for a resolution asking the government to start peace talks at once on the basis of a return to the status quo of 1914‚Äî\\"inflamed the paranoia and desperation of the right. The annexationists prepared for a war to the knife against the Chancellor and domestic \\"traitors\\".\\"Field (1981), p. 388 Chamberlain was disappointed that Tirpitz had not been appointed Chancellor; however, he was overjoyed with Bethmann-Hollweg's sacking and welcomed the military dictatorship of Hindenburg and Ludendorff as giving Germany the sort of government it needed.Field (1981), p. 389 Chamberlain was always inclined to hero worship, and for him, Hindenburg and Ludendorff were the greatest of a long line of German heroes. Chamberlain wrote in 1917 that: \\"Had Hindenburg and Ludendorff stood on the first day in their rightful place, the peace would in all probability have been dictated in Paris before the end of 1914.\\" Besides being an annexationist who wanted to see the war end with Germany as the world's greatest power, Chamberlain also advocated a set of wide-ranging changes to German society intended to achieve a \\"rebirth\\" of Germany.Field (1981), p. 377 Chamberlain wanted to see the Spirit of 1914 made permanent, to convert the wartime Burgfrieden (\\"peace within a castle under siege\\") into a peacetime Volksgemeinschaft (people's community). He also wanted a new economic and social system that would be a \\"third way\\" between capitalism and socialism to bring about the Volksgemeinschaft organized along corporatist lines. To achieve this, Chamberlain called for the end to any remaining democratic features the constitution of 1871 still possessed and the creation of a pure dictatorship; for the end of the capitalist system with the state to nationalize huge sections of the economy while at the same time respecting the right to private property; and for the militarization of society on a new scale.Field (1981), pp. 371‚Äì77 Chamberlain was somewhat vague about how this corporatist society would work in practice, but what he wanted was rule by an oligarchy of aristocrats, intellectuals, bureaucrats and military officers who would run a \\"planned economy\\" via \\"scientific management\\".Field (1981), pp. 373‚Äì74 The entire German people (except for the Jews, whom Chamberlain believed did not belong in Germany) were to be united by a common loyalty to the Emperor. A fanatical monarchist, Chamberlain saw the monarchy as the bedrock of German life, writing in his 1915 book Politische Ideale: \\"Whoever speaks of a republic in Germany belongs on the gallows; the monarchical idea is here a holy law of life.\\"Field (1981), p. 372. At the same time, Chamberlain envisioned a Germany that would somehow remain the leading industrial power at the forefront of modern technology while at the same time become a romantic, agrarian society where ordinary people would work the land and retain their traditional deference to the aristocracy.Field (1981), pp. 371‚Äì73 Chamberlain was also vague about how this could be achieved, writing only that a \\"planned economy\\", \\"scientific management\\" and an economically interventionist state committed to social reforms would make it all possible. After Germany's diplomatic defeat in the Second Moroccan Crisis in 1911, Wilhelm II became the Schattenkaiser (the \\"Shadow Emperor\\"), an increasingly reclusive figure who was seen less and less in public. The war further reinforced Wilhelm's tendency to avoid the public spotlight as much as possible. In private, Chamberlain grew disillusioned with his friend, complaining that instead of being the \\"Aryan soldier king\\" leading the Reich to victory as he wanted and expected him to be, the Kaiser was a weak leader as the \\"Shadow Emperor\\" was hiding himself away in deep seclusion from the rest of Germany at his hunting lodges. Wilhelm's hiding himself away from his own people during the war did immense damage to the prestige of the monarchy, and if the Kaiser's seclusion did not make the November Revolution of 1918 inevitable, it at least made it possible. As a monarchist, Chamberlain was worried about how Wilhelm was hurting his own reputation, and often vainly urged the Kaiser to appear in public more often. Chamberlain wrote in 1916 that Wilhelm had an \\"absolute incapability for judging character\\" and was now being \\"forced to obey a Frankfurt pimp\\", the last being a disparaging reference to Bethmann-Hollweg. Chamberlain was always very careful to avoid attacking Wilhelm in public, but his violent press attacks against Bethmann- Hollweg caused something of a rift with the Kaiser who felt Chamberlain's very public criticism of the Chancellor was also an indirect attack on him. Nonetheless, despite the strains the war imposed on their friendship, Chamberlain and Wilhelm continued to write throughout the war, but pointedly did not meet in person anymore, though Chamberlain's increasing paralysis also played a part. Wilhelm wrote to Chamberlain on 15 January 1917, stating: > The war is a struggle between two Weltanschauungen, the Teutonic-German for > morality, right, loyalty and faith, genuine humanity, truth and real > freedom, against ... the worship of Mammon, the power of money, pleasure, > land-hunger, lies, betrayal, deceit and‚Äîlast but not least‚Äîtreacherous > assassination! These two Weltanschauungen cannot be reconciled or tolerate > one another, one must be victorious, the other must go under!R√∂hl (2004), p. > 208 In response, Chamberlain wrote back to Wilhelm on 20 January 1917, declaring: > England has fallen totally into the hands of the Jews and the Americans. A > person does not understand this war unless he realizes that it is in the > deepest sense the war of Judentum and its near relative Americanism for the > control of the world‚Äîa war against Christianity, against Bildung, moral > strength, uncommercial art, against every idealist perspective on life, and > for the benefit of a world that would include only industry, finance, and > trade‚Äîin short, unrestricted plutocracy. All the other additional > factors‚ÄîRussian greed, French vanity, Italian bombast, the envious and > cowardly spirit of the neutrals‚Äîare whipped up, made crazy; the Jew and the > Yankee are the driving forces that operate consciously and in a certain > sense have hitherto been victorious or at all events successful ... It is > the war of modern mechanized \\"civilization\\" against the ancient, holy and > continually reborn culture of chosen races. Machines will crush both spirit > and soul in their clutches. Chamberlain continued to believe right up until the end of the war that Germany would win only if the people willed victory enough, and this sort of ideological war between \\"German idealism\\" vs. \\"Jewish materialism\\" could only end with one side utterly crushing the other. In the last two years of the war, Chamberlain became obsessed with defeating the \\"inner enemy\\" that he believed was holding Germany back. In this regard, Chamberlain frequently asserted that Germany was not one nation, but two; on one side, the \\"patriots\\" like Admiral Alfred von Tirpitz, General Erich Ludendorff, Field Marshal Paul von Hindenburg, Wolfgang Kapp, J. F. Lehmann and Count von Reventlow; and on the other, the \\"traitors\\" which included people like Philipp Scheidemann, Eduard David and Matthias Erzberger. No compromise between these two Germanies was possible or desirable, Chamberlain argued, and one would have to be destroyed. Chamberlain's wartime writings against the \\"inner enemy\\" anticipated the \\"stab-in-the-back legend\\" which emerged after 1918. Chamberlain was a founding member of both the extreme-right, anti-Semitic Deutschlands Erneuerung newspaper, and of the Fatherland Party in 1917. The character of the Fatherland Party was well illustrated by an infamous incident in January 1918 when at a Fatherland Party rally in Berlin, a group of disabled war veterans were invited to debate the Fatherland Party's speakers.Evans (2005), p. 68 The wounded veterans, including men who were paralyzed, blinded, missing limbs, etc. all declared that they were now against the war and had become pacifists. The crippled veterans deplored the Fatherland Party's militarism and demand for war to go until victory, regardless of how many more would have to die or end up living with destroyed bodies. The ultra-nationalists of the Fatherland Party were so enraged by what the crippled veterans had to say that the audience stormed the stage, and savagely beat the disabled veterans senseless. Chamberlain, who lived in Bayreuth. was not present during the Berlin rally, but expressed his approval of what had happened when he heard of it. During the war, most Germans saw Britain as the main enemy, and so Chamberlain's status as the Englishman who supported the Reich made him an even more famous celebrity in Germany than he had been before 1914. Chamberlain's wartime essays were widely read. The first set of essays sold 160,000 copies within six months of publication while the second set sold 75,000 copies within six weeks of publication.Field (1981), p. 390 Between 1914 and 1918 about 1 million copies of Chamberlain's essays were sold, making Chamberlain one of Germany's best read writers during the war. In December 1915, it was estimated that between the direct sales of Chamberlain's essays and reprints in newspapers, at least 3 million people had read Chamberlain's war-time writings. Such was the power of Chamberlain as a public figure that in August 1916 the German Jewish industrialist Walther Rathenau‚Äîwhom Chamberlain had often accused of profiteering‚Äîmailed Chamberlain a copy of his bank balance sheets, which showed that Rathenau was in fact getting poorer as a result of the war, and politely asked Chamberlain to stop accusing him of war profiteering.Field (1981), pp. 391‚Äì92 Rathenau's appeal made no impression, and Chamberlain continued to accuse Rathenau of war profiteering right until he was assassinated in 1922.Field (1981), p. 392 In 1917 Chamberlain wrote about the liberal Frankfurter Zeitung newspaper: \\"No knowledgeable person, can doubt that the enemy is at work among us ... whenever England has something up her sleeve against the interests of Germany, she uses the Frankfurter Zeitung.\\" Bernhard Guttmann, the editor of the Frankfurter Zeitung sued Chamberlain for libel about that article. In August 1918, the sensational libel trial which attracted much media attention opened. The Frankfurter Zeitung's lawyers were Conrad Haussmann and Hertz while Chamberlain was defended by Heinrich Class and Adolf Jacobsen.Field (1981), pp. 392‚Äì93 On 16 August 1918, the trial ended with the judge ruling that Chamberlain was indeed guilty of libel and fined him 1,500 marks.Field (1981), p. 393 The guilty verdict set off a storm in right-wing circles, who quickly held several successful fund-raisers that raised the necessary 1,500 marks to pay Chamberlain's fine.Field (1981), p. 394 Portrait, unknown date Hitler's mentor In November 1918, Chamberlain was completely shattered and horrified by Germany's defeat in the war, a defeat he believed to be impossible, as well as by the November Revolution, which had toppled his beloved monarchy.Field (1981), pp. 396‚Äì97 Adding to his bitterness, Chamberlain was now so paralyzed that he could no longer leave his bed, something that he believed to be the result of poisoning by the British secret service.Field (1981), p. 397 Chamberlain saw both the defeat and the revolution of 1918 as the work of the Jews, writing in 1919 that Germany was now under the \\"supremacy of the Jews\\".Field (1981), p. 401 In his last years, Chamberlain's anti-Semitic writings grew ever more violent and bloodthirsty as Chamberlain became even more intensely anti-Semitic than he had been before 1918. In March 1920, Chamberlain supported the Kapp Putsch against the Weimar Republic, which he called the Judenrepublik (\\"Jewish Republic\\"), and was even more embittered by its failure.Field (1981), p. 417 The Kapp putsch was defeated by a general strike called by the Social Democrats which shut down the entire German economy. A young v√∂lkisch activist Josef Stolzing-Cerny and a Chamberlain prot√©g√© who had participated in the Kapp putsch wrote to Chamberlain after its failure: \\"Unfortunately Kapp was not all 'the man with the lion heart', much rather the man with the beer heart, for he continually used all his energies befuddling his brain with alcohol. ... In the same situation a Bismarck or a Napoleon would have hunted the whole Jewish-socialist republic to the devil.\\" Stolzing-Cerny went on to criticize Kapp for not unleashing the Freikorps Marinebrigade Ehrhardt which had taken Berlin against the Jews of Berlin, instead ordering the Freikorps to keep order. After the failure of the putsch, Chamberlain no longer considered Wolfgang Kapp to be one of his heroes, and instead damned him as a weak-willed coward all too typical of German conservatives who talked tough, but never followed up their words with action. More importantly, the failure of the Kapp putsch to a certain extent discredited traditional German conservatism in Chamberlain's eyes, and led him on the search for a more radical alternative, a type of \\"German socialism\\" that would offer a \\"third way\\" between capitalism and socialism.Field (1981), p. 419 In January 1921, Stolzing-Cerny, who joined the NSDAP in December 1920, wrote to Chamberlain about the new man on the political scene, \\"one Adolf Hitler, an Austrian worker, a man of extraordinary oratorical talents and an astonishingly rich political knowledge who knows marvelously how to thrill the masses\\".Field (1981), p. 421 Initially, Chamberlain was hesitant about Hitler, believing that he might be another Kapp, but after the \\"battle of Coburg\\", in which Hitler had personally fought with his followers in a street battle against the Communists, Chamberlain started to see Hitler as someone who practiced what he preached.Field (1981), p. 422 From that time onwards, Chamberlain started to closely follow and admire Hitler, whom he saw as \\"Germany's savior\\". Hitler in his turn had read The Foundations, Chamberlain's biography of Wagner, and many of his wartime essays, and was much influenced by all that Chamberlain had written.Field (1981), p. 452 British historian Sir Ian Kershaw, a biographer of Hitler, writes that > ... Hitler drew heavily for his ideas from well known anti-Semitic tracts > such as those by Houston Stewart Chamberlain, Adolf Wahrmund and especially, > the arch-popularizer Theodor Fritsch (one of whose emphasis was the alleged > sexual abuse of women by the Jews)...Kershaw, Ian (1998) Hitler: 1889-1936: > Hubris. New York: Norton. p. 151 The fact that Hitler was an ardent Wagnerite who adored Wagner's music gave Chamberlain and Hitler a mutual ground for friendship beyond their shared hatred of the Jews. Likewise, Joseph Goebbels had been converted to the v√∂lkisch ideology after reading Chamberlain's books and essays, and came to the conclusion on the basis of Chamberlain's writings that the West could only be saved by removing the Jews from German society.Evans (2005), p. 204 During this period, Chamberlain, who was practically a member of the Wagner family, started to push for the Bayreuth Festival to become openly identified with v√∂lkisch politics, and to turn the previously apolitical festival into a v√∂lkisch rally.Field (1981), pp. 428‚Äì29 Despite his paralysis, Chamberlain whose mind was still sharp, remained active as a writer, maintaining a correspondence with a whole gamut of figures from Admiral Alfred von Tirpitz to the radical anti-Semitic journalist Theodor Fritsch, the leader of the v√∂lkisch Hammerbund (\\"Hammer League\\").Field (1981), p. 429 From his exile in the Netherlands, the former Kaiser wrote to Chamberlain in 1922 to tell him that thanks to his essays, he had become a Marcionist and now rejected the Old Testament.R√∂hl (2004), p. 209 Wilhelm claimed that on the basis of Chamberlain's work, he now knew that what had become the Old Testament was in fact a Zoroastrian text from ancient Persia (modern Iran) and was therefore \\"Aryan\\". The former Kaiser claimed that the Jews had stolen and rewritten this sacred text from the Aryan Persians, ending his letter: \\"Let us free ourselves from the Judentum with its Jawe!\\" In 1923, Wilhelm wrote to tell Chamberlain of his belief that not only were the Jews \\"not our religious forebears\\", but that Jesus was \\"not a Jew\\", was instead an Aryan \\"of exceptional beauty, tall and slim with a noble face inspiring respect and love; his hair blond shading into chestnut brown, his arms and hands noble and exquisitely formed\\". In 1923 Chamberlain met with Adolf Hitler in Bayreuth, and in September he sat in his wheelchair next to Hitler during the v√∂lkisch \\"German Day\\" paramilitary parade. In September 1923 he wrote a grateful and highly admiring open letter to the NSDAP leader. Chamberlain, paralysed and despondent after Germany's losses in World War I, wrote to Hitler after his first visit in September 1923: Chamberlain's letter‚Äîwhich made him into the first celebrity to endorse the NSDAP‚Äîcaused a media sensation in Germany and led Hitler to rejoice \\"like a child\\" at the news.Field (1981), p. 438 When Hitler staged the Munich Beer Hall Putsch in November 1923, Chamberlain wrote an essay for the V√∂lkischer Beobachter entitled \\"God Wills It!\\" calling on all Germans who love Germany to join the putsch.Field (1981), p. 439 After the failure of the Munich Putsch, Chamberlain wrote: \\"We are deeply affected by this tragic fate, Jew and Jesuit can now triumph again!\\". Chamberlain joined the Nazi Party and contributed to its publications. Its primary journal, the V√∂lkischer Beobachter, dedicated five columns to praising him on his 70th birthday, describing The Foundations as the \\"gospel of the National Socialist movement\\".Shirer (1959), p. 109 In January 1924, Chamberlain published an essay praising Hitler as one of the \\"rare beautiful beings... a man of genuine simplicity with a fascinating gaze\\" whose words \\"always come directly from the heart\\".Field (1981), p. 440 Chamberlain praised Hitler for embarking upon a \\"Vernichtungskrieg\\" (\\"war of destruction\\") against all of Germany's enemies.Field (1981), p. 441 Chamberlain further wrote about Hitler‚Äîwhom he viewed as the greatest of all his heroes‚Äîthat: > Because he [Hitler] is no mere phrasemonger, but consistently pursues his > thought to an end and draws his conclusions from it, he recognizes and > proclaims that one cannot simultaneously embrace Jesus and those that > crucified him. That is the splendid thing about Hitler‚Äîhis courage! ... In > this respect he reminds one of Luther. And whence come the courage of these > two men? It derives from the holy seriousness each has for the cause! Hitler > utters no word he does not mean in earnest; his speeches contain no padding > or vague, provisional statements ... but the result of this is that he is > decried as a visionary dreamer. People consider Hitler a dreamer whose head > is full of impossible schemes and yet a renowned and original historian > called him \\"the most creative mind since Bismarck in the area of > statecraft.\\" I believe ... we are all inclined to view those things as > impractical that we do not already see accomplished before us. He, for > example, finds it impossible to share our conviction about the pernicious, > even murderous influence of Jewry on the German Volk and not to take action; > if one sees the danger, then steps must be taken against it with utter > dispatch. I daresay everyone recognizes this, but nobody risks speaking out; > nobody ventures to extract the consequences of his thoughts for his actions; > nobody except Hitler. ... This man has worked like a divine blessing, > cheering hearts, opening men's eyes to clearly seen goals, enlivening their > spirits, kindling their capacity for love and for indignation, hardening > their courage and resoluteness. Yet we still need him badly: May God who > sent him to us preserve him for many years as a \\"blessing for the German > Fatherland!\\"Field (1981), pp. 441‚Äì42 After the failure of the Munich Putsch, Hitler was convicted of high treason and imprisoned. When the 1924 Bayreuth Festival opened, Chamberlain's efforts to identify the festival with v√∂lkisch politics finally bore fruit.Field (1981), p. 443 The Festspielh√ºgel opera house and the way leading up to it were decorated with v√∂lkisch symbols like the swastika, parades by the nationalist Verb√§nde were held outside the Festspielh√ºgel, prominent v√∂lkisch leaders like General Erich Ludendorff appeared on the stage to give a speech attacking the Weimar Republic before one of the operas was performed, and a petition was offered to the audiences demanding that Hitler be pardoned. The 1924 festival led to 10,000 people in one night signing the petition asking for Hitler's release. From his prison cell at Landsberg prison, Hitler wrote to Siegfried Wagner expressing his sorrow about being unable to attend his beloved Bayreuth Festival and to express his thanks to the entire Wagner family and Chamberlain for turning the Bayreuth festival into a v√∂lkisch rally, adding that when he got out of prison, he would come to Bayreuth as \\"the first witness and herald\\" of Germany's rebirth.Field (1981), pp. 443‚Äì44 Hitler stated this would be the best medicine for Chamberlain's health as \\"the road to Berlin\\" started in Bayreuth.Field (1981), p. 444 In May 1926, one year before Chamberlain's death, Hitler and Goebbels visited him in Bayreuth. Chamberlain assured Hitler of his belief that he was the \\"chosen one\\" destined to lead Germany back to greatness after the defeat of 1918, to make the Reich a world power, and finally smash the Jews.Field (1981), p. 445 Much of Hitler's genuine affection for Chamberlain was due to the fact that Chamberlain never lost his faith in Hitler's potential, even at time in the mid-1920s when the NSDAP was faring very poorly.Field (1981), pp. 441‚Äì45 Chamberlain continued living in Bayreuth until his death in 1927.Mosse (1968), pp. xi, xivDegener, Herrmann A. L. (ed.) (1928) Wer Ist's? (the German Who's Who), Berlin. vol. 9, p. 1773 records the death on 9 January 1927, of \\"Houston Stewart Chamberlain, writer, Bayreuth\\". Chamberlain died on 9 January 1927 and was buried at the Bayreuth cemetery in the presence of Adolf Hitler. His gravestone bears a verse from the Gospel of Luke, which he considered to spell out the essential difference between his ideal type of Christianity, and Judaism and Catholicism as he saw them: \\"The Kingdom of God is within you.\\" () Impact of The Foundations During his lifetime Chamberlain's works were read widely throughout Europe, and especially in Germany. His reception was particularly favourable among Germany's conservative elite. Kaiser Wilhelm II patronised Chamberlain, maintaining a correspondence, inviting him to stay at his court, distributing copies of The Foundations of the Nineteenth Century among the German Army, and seeing that The Foundations was carried in German libraries and included in the school curricula. In 1932 in an essay entitled \\"Anti-Semitics\\" denouncing antisemitism, the \\"homeless left\\" German journalist Carl von Ossietzky wrote: \\"Intellectual anti-Semitism was the special prerogative of Houston Stewart Chamberlain, who, in The Foundations of the Nineteenth Century, concretized the fantasies of Count Arthur de Gobineau, which had penetrated to Bayreuth. He translated them from the language of harmless snobbery into [the language] of a modernized, seductive mysticism.\\"Ossietzky (1994), p. 280 Ossietzky ended his essay with the warning: \\"Today there is a strong smell of blood in the air. Literary anti- Semitism forges the moral weapon for murder. Sturdy and honest lads will take care of the rest.\\" The Foundations would prove to be a seminal work in German nationalism. Due to its success, aided by Chamberlain's association with the Wagner circle, its ideas of Aryan supremacy and a struggle against Jewish influence spread widely across the German state at the beginning of the century. If it did not form the framework of later Nazi ideology, at the very least it provided its adherents with a seeming intellectual justification.Mosse (1968), xvi. Many of Chamberlain's ideas such as his emphasis on a racial struggle between Aryans vs. Jews for world domination; his championing of \\"world power status\\" for Germany; his call for a \\"planned economy\\" (something realized in 1936 when Hitler brought in the First Four Year Plan which saw the German state take over the economy); his vision of Germany becoming the Volksgemeinschaft (people's community\\"); his demand for a \\"third way\\" between capitalism and socialism; his total opposition to democracy; and his nostalgia for an agrarian lifestyle were central to Nazism.Field (1981), p. 449 The only Nazi idea that Chamberlain missed was lebensraum (living space), the perceived need for Germany to colonize Eastern Europe while displacing the existing population to make room for Aryan colonists. However, there were differences in that Chamberlain was always a monarchist and believed that when his friend Hitler came to power, he would restore the monarchy and put his other friend Wilhelm II back on the throne. Had Chamberlain lived to see the Third Reich, he likely would have been disappointed that Hitler did not carry out the restoration of the monarchy that he so desired. Moreover, Chamberlain was just one of the many v√∂lkische thinkers who influenced Hitler. Chamberlain himself lived to see his ideas begin to bear fruit. Adolf Hitler, while still growing as a political figure in Germany, visited him several times (in 1923 and in 1926, together with Joseph Goebbels) at the Wagner family's property in Bayreuth. Later, in January 1927, Hitler, along with several highly ranked members of the Nazi Party, attended Chamberlain's funeral. Chamberlain's ideas particularly influenced Alfred Rosenberg, who became the Nazi Party's in-house philosopher. In 1909, some months before his 17th birthday, Rosenberg went with an aunt to visit his guardian where several other relatives were gathered. Bored, he went to a book shelf, picked up a copy of Chamberlain's The Foundations and wrote of the moment: \\"I felt electrified; I wrote down the title and went straight to the bookshop.\\" In 1930 Rosenberg published The Myth of the Twentieth Century, a homage to and continuation of Chamberlain's work. Rosenberg had accompanied Hitler when he called upon Wagner's widow, Cosima, in October 1923 when he met her son-in-law. Hitler told the ailing Chamberlain he was working on his own book which, he intended, should do for the Third Reich what Chamberlain's book had done for the Second.Cecil, Robert (1972) The Myth of the Master Race: Alfred Rosenberg and Nazi Ideology, London. p. 12-13. Beyond the Kaiser and the NSDAP, assessments were mixed. The French Germanic scholar Edmond Vermeil considered Chamberlain's ideas \\"essentially shoddy,\\" but the anti-Nazi German author Konrad Heiden, despite objections to Chamberlain's racial ideas, described him as \\"one of the most astonishing talents in the history of the German mind, a mine of knowledge and profound ideas\\".Shirer (1959), pp. 105-06 In a 1939 work Martin Heidegger (himself a former Nazi) dismissed Chamberlain's work as presenting a subjective, individualistic \\"Weltanschauung\\" (fabricated worldview).Heidegger, Martin Besinnung, Gesamtausgabe, Band 66, Vittorio Klostermann, Frankfurt am Main, 1997, p. 402, section 131, \\"Metaphysik und Weltanschauung. \\"Die 'Weltanschauung' ist eine neuzeitliche Verunstaltung der Metaphysik, ihr Ma√üstab ist die √ñffentlichkeit, in der Jedermann Jedes zug√§nglich findet und auf solche Zug√§nglichlichkeit einen Anspruch erhebt; dem widerstreitet nicht, da√ü 'Weltanschauungen' dann sehr 'pers√∂nlich' und auf den 'Einzelnen' zugeschnitten sind; diese Einzelnen f√ºhlen sich als die abseitigen Jederm√§nner, als Menschen, die auf sich gestellt f√ºr sich ein Welt-Bild, die Welt als Bild vor-stellen und eine Art des Sichzurechtfindens (Charakter) sich zustellen (z.B.

The renal medulla is split up into a number of sections, known as the renal pyramids. Blood enters into the kidney via the renal artery, which then splits up to form the interlobar arteries. The interlobar arteries each in turn branch into arcuate arteries, which in turn branch to form interlobular arteries, and these finally reach the glomeruli. At the glomerulus the blood reaches a highly disfavourable pressure gradient and a large exchange surface area, which forces the serum portion of the blood out of the vessel and into the renal tubules. Flow continues through the renal tubules, including the proximal tubule, the Loop of Henle, through the distal tubule and finally leaves the kidney by means of the collecting duct, leading to the renal pelvis, the dilated portion of the ureter. The renal medulla (Latin renes medulla = kidney middle) contains the structures of the nephrons responsible for maintaining the salt and water balance of the blood. These structures include the vasa rectae (both spuria and vera), the venulae rectae, the medullary capillary plexus, the loop of Henle, and the collecting tubule.Netter's, plate 337 The renal medulla is hypertonic to the filtrate in the nephron and aids in the reabsorption of water. Blood is filtered in the glomerulus by solute size. Ions such as sodium, chloride, potassium, and calcium are easily filtered, as is glucose. Proteins are not passed through the glomerular filter because of their large size, and do not appear in the filtrate or urine unless a disease process has affected the glomerular capsule or the proximal and distal convoluted tubules of the nephron. Though the renal medulla only receives a small percentage of the renal blood flow, the oxygen extraction is very high, causing a low oxygen tension and more importantly, a critical sensitivity to hypotension, hypoxia, and blood flow.Miller's Anesthesia, 8th edition. 553-554. The renal medulla extracts oxygen at a ratio of ~80% making it exquisitely sensitive to small changes in renal blood flow. The mechanisms of many perioperative renal insults are based on the disruption of adequate blood flow (and therefore oxygen delivery) to the renal medulla. Interstitium The medullary interstitium is the tissue surrounding the loop of Henle in the medulla. It functions in renal water reabsorption by building up a high hypertonicity, which draws water out of the thin descending limb of the loop of Henle and the collecting duct system.hypertonicity, in turn, is created by an efflux of urea from the inner medullary collecting duct. Page 837 Pyramids Renal pyramids (or malpighian pyramids or Malpighi's pyramids named after Marcello Malpighi, a seventeenth-century anatomist) are cone- shaped tissues of the kidney. In humans, the renal medulla is made up of 10 to 18 of these conical subdivisions. The broad base of each pyramid faces the renal cortex, and its apex, or papilla, points internally towards the pelvis. The pyramids appear striped because they are formed by straight parallel segments of nephrons' Loops of Henle and collecting ducts. The base of each pyramid originates at the corticomedullary border and the apex terminates in a papilla, which lies within a minor calyx, made of parallel bundles of urine collecting tubules. Papilla The renal papilla is the location where the renal pyramids in the medulla empty urine into the minor calyx in the kidney. Histologically it is marked by medullary collecting ducts converging to form a papillary duct to channel the fluid. Transitional epithelium begins to be seen. =Clinical significance= Some chemicals toxic to the kidney, called nephrotoxins, damage the renal papillae. Damage to the renal papillae may result in death to cells in this region of the kidney, called renal papillary necrosis. The most common toxic causes of renal papillary necrosis are NSAIDs, such as ibuprofen, acetylsalicylic acid, and phenylbutazone, in combination with dehydration. Perturbed renal papillary development has also been shown to be associated with onset of functional obstruction and renal fibrosis. Renal papillary damage has also been associated with nephrolithiasis and can be quantified according to the papillary grading score, which accounts for contour, pitting, plugging and randall plaque.

Some provider companies operate multiple cellular networks and similarly use colocated base stations for two or more cellular networks, (CDMA2000 or GSM, for example). Some cities require that cell sites be inconspicuous; they can be blended with the surrounding area or mounted on buildings or advertising towers. Preserved treescapes can often hide cell towers inside an artificial or preserved tree. These installations are generally referred to as concealed cell sites or stealth cell sites.  Overview  A cellular network is a network of handheld mobile phones (cell phones) in which each phone communicates with the telephone network by radio waves through a local antenna at a cellular base station (cell site). The coverage area in which service is provided is divided into a mosaic of small geographical areas called \\"cells\\", each served by a separate low power multichannel transceiver and antenna at a base station. All the cell phones within a cell communicate with the system through that cell's antenna, on separate frequency channels assigned by the base station from a common pool of frequencies used by the system. The purpose of cellular organization is to conserve radio bandwidth by frequency reuse; the low power radio signals used within each cell do not travel far beyond the cell, so the radio channels can be reused in geographically separated cells. When a mobile user moves from one cell to another, their phone is automatically \\"handed off\\" to the new cell's antenna, and assigned a new set of frequencies, and subsequently communicates with this antenna. This background handoff process is transparent to the user and can occur in the middle of a phone call without any service interruption. Each cell phone has an automated full duplex digital transceiver and communicates with the cell antenna over two digital radio channels in the UHF or microwave band, one for each direction of the bidirectional conversation, plus a control channel which handles registering the phone with the network, dialing, and the handoff process. Typically a cell tower is located at the edge of one or more cells and covers multiple cells using directional antennas. A common geometry is to locate the cell site at the intersection of three adjacent cells, with three antennas at 120¬∞ angles each covering one cell. The type of antenna used for cellular base stations (vertical white rectangles in pictures), called a sector antenna, usually consists of a vertical collinear array of dipoles. It has a flat fan-shaped radiation pattern, which is tilted slightly down to cover the cell area without radiating at higher angles into further off cells which reuse the same frequencies. The elevation angle of the antenna must be carefully adjusted, so the beam covers the entire cell without radiating too far. In modern sector antennas beam tilt can usually be adjusted electronically, to avoid the necessity of a lineman climbing the tower to mechanically tilt the antenna when adjustment is needed.

Operation  = Range = The working range of a cell site (the range which mobile devices connects reliably to the cell site) is not a fixed figure. It will depend on a number of factors, including, but not limited to: * Height of antenna over surrounding terrain (Line-of-sight propagation). * The frequency of signal in use. * The transmitter's rated power. * The required uplink/downlink data rate of the subscriber's deviceJ. Andrews, A. Gohsh (2007). Fundamentals of WiMAX, p. 43 * The directional characteristics of the site antenna array. * Reflection and absorption of radio energy by buildings or vegetation. * It may also be limited by local geographical or regulatory factors and weather conditions. * In addition there are timing limitations in some technologies (e.g., even in free space, GSM would be limited to 35 km, with 70 km being possible with special equipment) Generally, in areas where there are enough cell sites to cover a wide area, the range of each one will be set to: * Ensure there is enough overlap for \\"handover\\" to/from other sites (moving the signal for a mobile device from one cell site to another, for those technologies that can handle it - e.g. making a GSM phone call while in a car or train). * Ensure that the overlap area is not too large, to minimize interference problems with other sites. In practice, cell sites are grouped in areas of high population density, with the most potential users. Cell phone traffic through a single site is limited by the base station's capacity; there is a finite number of calls or data traffic that a base station can handle at once. This capacity limitation is commonly the factor that determines the spacing of cell mast sites. In suburban areas, masts are commonly spaced 1‚Äì2 miles (2‚Äì3 km) apart and in dense urban areas, masts may be as close as ¬º-¬Ω mile (400‚Äì800 m) apart. The maximum range of a mast (where it is not limited by interference with other masts nearby) depends on the same considerations. In any case the limiting factor is the ability of a low-powered personal cell phone to transmit back to the mast. As a rough guide, based on a tall mast and flat terrain, it may be possible to get between 50 and 70 km (30‚Äì45 miles). When the terrain is hilly, the maximum distance can vary from as little as to due to encroachment of intermediate objects into the wide center fresnel zone of the signal.Frequently Asked PCS Questions undated, URL retrieved 14 August 2007. Depending on terrain and other circumstances, a GSM Tower can replace between 2 and of cabling for fixed wireless networks.NTIA Seeks Input on Broadband Stimulus Money undated, URL retrieved 3 March 2009. In addition, some technologies, such as GSM, have an additional absolute maximum range of , which is imposed by technical limitations. CDMA and IDEN have no such limit defined by timing.  Practical Example of Range  * 3G/4G/5G (FR1) Mobile base station tower: it is technically possible to cover up to 50 km-150 km. (Macrocell) * 5G (FR2) Mobile base station: the distances between the 5G base-station is about 250‚Äì300 m, due to the use of millimetre waves. = Channel reuse = The concept of \\"maximum\\" range is misleading in a cellular network. Cellular networks are designed to support many conversations with a limited number of radio channels (slices of radio frequency spectrum necessary to make one conversation) that are licensed to an operator of a cellular service. To overcome this limitation, it is necessary to repeat and reuse the same channels at different locations. Just as a car radio changes from one local station to a completely different local station with the same frequency when traveling to another city, the same radio channel gets reused on a cell mast only a few miles away. To do this, the signal of a cell mast is intentionally kept at low power and in many cases tilted downward to limit its reach. This allows covering an area small enough not to have to support more conversations than the available channels can carry. Due to the sectorized arrangement of antennas on a tower, it is possible to vary the strength and angle for each sector depending on the coverage from other towers in the area. = Signal limiting factor = A cellphone may not work at times because it is too far from a mast, or because the phone is in a location where cell phone signals are attenuated by thick building walls, hills, or other structures. The signals do not need a clear line of sight but greater radio interference will degrade or eliminate reception. When many people try to use the cell mast at the same time, e.g. during a traffic jam or a sports event, then there will be a signal on the phone display but it is blocked from starting a new connection. The other limiting factor for cell phones is the ability to send a signal from its low powered battery to the cell site. Some cellphones perform better than others under low power or low battery, typically due to the ability to send a good signal from the phone to the mast. The base station controller (a central computer that specializes in making phone connections) and the intelligence of the cellphone keeps track of and allows the phone to switch from one mast to the next during conversation. As the user moves towards a mast it picks the strongest signal and releases the mast from which the signal has become weaker; that channel on that mast becomes available to another user. =Geolocation= Cellular geolocation is less precise than by GPS, but it is available to devices that do not have GPS receivers and where the GPS is not available. The precision of this system varies and is highest where advanced forward link methods are possible and is lowest where only a single cell site can be reached, in which case the location is only known to be within the coverage of that site. An advanced forward link is where a device is within range of at least three cell sites and where the carrier has implemented timing system use. Another method is using angle of arrival (AoA) and it occurs when the device is in range of at least two cell sites, produces intermediate precision. Assisted GPS uses both satellite and cell phone signals. In the United States, for emergency calling service using location data (locally called \\"Enhanced 911\\"), it was required that at least 95% of cellular phones in use on 31 December 2005 support such service. Many carriers missed this deadline and were fined by the Federal Communications Commission. = Radio power and health = The Federal Communications Commission, says: ::\\"Measurement data obtained from various sources have consistently indicated that 'worst-case' ground-level power densities near typical cellular towers are on the order of 1 ¬µW/cm¬≤ (or 10 mW/m¬≤) or less (usually significantly less).\\"Questions and Answers about Biological Effects and Potential Hazards of Radiofrequency Electromagnetic Fields Fourth Edition. FCC. August 1999. Page 21. Retrieved 7 April 2013 Cell phones, cell towers, wi-fi, smart meters, DECT phones, cordless phones, baby monitors and other wireless devices all emit non-ionizing radio frequencies, which the World Health Organization (WHO) has classified as a \\"potential\\" carcinogen, although according to the National Cancer Institute \\"No mechanism by which ELF-EMFs or radiofrequency radiation could cause cancer has been identified.\\"  Temporary sites  Although cell antennas are normally attached to permanent structures, carriers also maintain fleets of vehicles, called cells-on-wheels (COWs), that serve as temporary cell sites. A generator may be included for use where network electrical power is not available, and the system may have a wireless backhaul link allowing use where a wired link is not available. COWs are also used at permanent cell sites‚Äîas temporary replacements for damaged equipment, during planned outages, and to augment capacity such as during conventions. Cell on wheels (COW) Employment Cell site workers are called tower climbers or transmission tower workers. Transmission tower workers often work at heights of up to 1,500 feet (450 m), performing maintenance and repair work for cellular phone and other wireless communications companies. Spy agency setup According to documents leaked to Der Spiegel, the NSA sells a $40,000 \\"active GSM base station\\" to be used as a tool to mimic a mobile phone tower and thus monitor cell phones. In November 2014, The Wall Street Journal reported that the Technical Operations Group of the U.S. Marshals utilizes spy devices, known as \\"dirtboxes\\", to mimic powerful cell tower signals. Such devices are designed to cause mobile phones to switch over to the tower, as it is the strongest signal within reach. The devices are placed on airplanes to effectively create a \\"dragnet\\", gathering data about phones as the planes travel above populated areas.  Off-grid systems  Ryse Energy Small Wind Turbine & Solar PV on a telecom tower An off-grid cell site is not connected to the public electrical grid. Usually the system is off-the-grid because of difficult access or lack of infrastructure. Fuel cell or other backup power systems are added to critical cell sites to provide day-today and emergency power. Traditionally sites have used internal-combustion-engine-driven generator sets,Ballard fuel cells to power telecom backup power units for motorola however, being less efficient than public power, they increase operating expense and are a source of pollution (atmospheric, acoustic, etc.) and some are in areas protected by environment and landscape conservation. Renewable sources, such as solar power and wind powerSuch as Wind-it tower may be available where cell sites are placed. This can reduce the cost of fuel to the cell site or telecom tower by upto 75% They can be backed up by a fuel generator system which allows the cell site to work when the renewable sources are not enough. One such energy production system consists of: In a recent case study, Ryse Energy reduced a cell sites monthly opex spend from US$1,300-1,500 using traditioanl diesel generations, to US$150 using a wind, solar and battery storage installation. Electrical energy from intermittent sources is stored in secondary batteries which are usually designed to have an average of 2 days of self-sufficiency, also known as automony, to allow time for maintenance personnel to arrive at site when a repair is needed. The renewable energy systems supply electrical power when available. The fuel cells are activated only when the natural sources are not enough to supply the energy the system needs. The emergency power supply (the fuel cells) is designed to last an average of 10 days. In this way the structure is completely self-sufficient: this enables the maintenance team to pay only few visits to the site, since it is usually hard to get to. Camouflage Camouflaged monopole, called \\"monopalm\\", in Tucson, Arizona There is often local opposition to new masts for reasons of safety and appearance. The latter is sometimes tackled by disguising the mast as something else, such as a flag pole, street lamp, or a tree (e.g. palm trees, pine trees, cypress) or rooftop structures or urban features such as chimneys or panels. These concealed cell sites can distinguish themselves by foliage shape and bark type. The foliage of all these antennas is composed of leaves made of plastic material accurately designed, taking into consideration quantity, shape and array suitable to completely conceal the antennas and all accessory parts in a natural manner. The materials used guarantee absolute radio-electric transparency and resistance to UVA rays. Nicknames include \\"monopalm\\" for a monopole disguised as a palm tree or \\"Pseudopinus telephoneyensis\\" for a mast disguised as a pine tree. In monopoles, the directional antennas are sometimes hidden in a plastic housing near the top of the pole so that the crossbars can be eliminated. An antenna colored to blend in with its host building, in Sopot, Poland Rooftop structures such as concealment chimneys or panels, 6 to 12 meters high, may conceal one or more mobile telephone operators on the same station. Roofmask panels can be fixed to existing rooftop structures, restyling them quickly and cheaply. Mobile telephone base stations are becoming a contemporary symbol, connected and intertwining with material and immaterial networks. Telestyles are architecturally blended cell towers, the result of cooperation with designers and architects. Miniature Researchers at Alcatel-Lucent have developed a cell site called lightRadio that fits in the palm of hand. It is the size of a Rubik's cube. It is capable of relaying 2G, 3G and 4G signals. They are more energy efficient and deliver broadband more efficiently than current cell sites. They could be used in very populated urban areas to make room for more radio space.The tiny cube that could cut your cell phone bill, CNN Money, 21 March 2011, David Goldman See also * Cellular network * Node B * OpenBTS * Mobile phone radiation and health * Telecom infrastructure sharing * Base transceiver station * Radio masts and towers * Mobile cell sites * Distributed antenna system * Telecommunications lease * Title 47 of the Code of Federal Regulations * In re Application of the United States for Historical Cell Site Data * Tower climber References External links *Maps of All Towers Across the United Kingdom *FCC: Universal Licensing Information *FCC: Information On Human Exposure To Radio frequency Fields From Cellular and PCS Radio Transmitters *Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Agency (ARPANSA) Base Station Survey 2007- 2011 Telecommunications infrastructure ","title":"Cell site"},{"id":"598346","text":"Capturing the Friedmans is a 2003 HBO documentary film directed by Andrew Jarecki. It focuses on the 1980s investigation of Arnold and Jesse Friedman for child molestation. It was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature in 2003. Some of the Friedmans' alleged victims and family members wrote to the Awards Committee protesting the nomination, their identities confirmed but protected by the judge who presided over the court case. Production Jarecki initially was making a short film, Just a Clown, which he completed, about children's birthday party entertainers in New York, including the popular clown David Friedman (\\"Silly Billy\\"). During his research, Jarecki learned that David Friedman's brother, Jesse, and his father, Arnold, had pleaded guilty to child sexual abuse, and the family had an archive of home movies. Jarecki interviewed some of the children involved and ended up making a film focusing on the Friedmans. Synopsis The investigation into Arnold Friedman's life started in 1987 after the U.S. Postal Service intercepted a magazine of child pornography received from the Netherlands. In searching his Great Neck, New York, home, investigators found a collection of child pornography. After learning that Friedman taught children computer classes from his home, local police began to suspect him of abusing his students. The Friedmans were allowed to stay at home in order to prepare for court and took numerous home videos while Arnold Friedman (and, later, his son Jesse) awaited trial. The videos were not made with publishing in mind, but rather as a way to record what was happening in their lives. The movie shows much of this footage: family dinners, conversations and arguments. Arnold's wife, Elaine, was unsure of her husband's guilt and advised him to confess in order to protect their son; she soon divorced him. Arnold Friedman pleaded guilty to multiple charges of sodomy and sexual abuse. According to the Friedman family, he confessed in the hopes that his son would be spared prison time. Jesse Friedman later confessed as well but later claimed he did so to avoid being sent to prison for life. He said in mitigation that his father had molested him. According to Jesse's lawyer Peter Panaro, who visited Arnold in a Wisconsin federal prison, Arnold admitted to molesting two boys, but not those who attended his computer classes. He is also quoted as claiming that, when he was 13, he sexually abused his younger brother, Howard, who was eight years old at the time; Howard Friedman, interviewed in the movie, says he does not recall this. Jesse Friedman, in a subsequent statement, said that his father told him and his brothers that he sexually abused Howard.\\"Presentation by Jesse Friedman, May 17, 2012\\", http://www.freejesse.net/case-story, consulted 10-20-2014. Arnold Friedman died by suicide in prison in 1995, leaving a $250,000 life insurance benefit to Jesse. Jesse Friedman was released from New York's Clinton Correctional Facility in 2001 after serving 13 years of his sentence. Currently, he is running an online book-selling business. Reception The film received predominantly positive reviews. Review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reported an approval rating of 97% based on 151 reviews, with an average rating of 8.5/10. The film was ranked as the 7th best-reviewed movie of 2003 on the website's best of the year list. The low-budget documentary was a success with audiences as well, grossing over $3 million in theaters and making it a surprise hit. Elvis Mitchell of The New York Times wrote, \\"Mr. Jarecki so recognizes the archetypal figures in the Friedman home that he knows to push things any further through heavy-handed assessment would be redundant.\\" He praised Jarecki for operating under the premise \\"that first impressions can't be trusted and that truth rests with each person telling the story.\\" The Washington Post columnist Desson Howe offered similar praise, writing, \\"It's testament to Jarecki's superbly wrought film that everyone seems to be, simultaneously, morally suspect and strikingly innocent as they relate their stories and assertions...This is a film about the quagmire of mystery in every human soul.\\" Similarly, Roger Ebert wrote, \\"The film is as an instructive lesson about the elusiveness of facts, especially in a legal context. Sometimes guilt and innocence are discovered in court, but sometimes, we gather, only truths about the law are demonstrated.\\" The film won the Grand Jury prize at the Sundance Film Festival for 2003. Capturing the Friedmans was voted the fifth film in the 2005 Channel 4 programme The 50 Greatest Documentaries. In one of the few negative reviews, Los Angeles Times writer Kenneth Turan wrote a critique of both the film and Jarecki, stating, \\"Jarecki's pose of impartiality gets especially troublesome for audiences when it enables him to evade responsibility for dealing with the complexities of his material.\\" Criticism intensified as Jarecki's choice not to pursue his firm belief in the Friedmans' innocence became publicly known. In his review, Ebert had recounted Jarecki's statement at the Sundance Film Festival that he did not know whether Arnold and Jesse Friedman were guilty of child molestation. Ebert roundly praised Jarecki for communicating this ambiguity. It has since emerged that Jarecki funded Jesse Friedman's appeal. Writing for The Village Voice, Debbie Nathan ‚Äì who was hired by Jarecki as a consultant after having been interviewed for the film ‚Äì wrote of Jarecki, \\"Polling viewers at Sundance in January, he was struck by how they were split over Arnold and Jesse's guilt. Since then, he's crafted a marketing strategy based on ambiguity, and during Q&As; and interviews, he has studiously avoided taking a stand.\\". There was a critical blacklash due to footage the director left out on purpose. Jarecki's film omitted a third co-defendant, Ross Goldstein, a teenage neighbor who also pleaded guilty to charges of child molestation and who corroborated some of the children's accusations at the time and went to prison. Jarecki also omitted a tearful confession of guilt by Jesse Friedman in prison on Geraldo Rivera‚Äôs talk show in 1989. Jesse Friedman detailed how his father had molested him as a child. Additional materials The 2003 DVD release included a second DVD: \\"Capturing the Friedmans - Outside the Frame\\". It included: * Unseen home movies (\\"Passover Seder\\", \\"Grandma Speaks\\", \\"Jesse's Last Night\\") * Great Neck Outraged. * New Witnesses and Evidence. * Uncut footage of the prosecution's star witness. * Friedman family scrapbook and hidden audio tapes. * Just a Clown (the 20-minute short featuring David Friedman that led to Capturing the Friedmans). * Jesse's Life Today. * An altercation at the film's New York premiere. * The Judge (Abbey Boklan) speaks out at the Great Neck premiere. * A ROM section with key documents from the family and the case. The materials show an altercation from a discussion period following the film's premiere in which the retired head of the Nassau County Police's Sex Crimes Unit Frances Galasso argues with Debbie Nathan, as well as a speech by trial judge Abbey Boklan from the showing in Great Neck. Both made the claim that the film had ignored relevant evidence of Jesse's guilt. This evidence included his appearance on the Geraldo Rivera show, when Jesse confessed to sexually abusing children,The recording of this video has not been released publicly, as of 2016. and the fact that there was another defendant (Ross Goldstein), who turned state's evidence and pleaded guilty, and two other unindicted co-conspirators. (Goldstein is not named in the film but it is said in one of the other DVD extras that he declined to be interviewed. One of the unindicted co-conspirators claims in the same section that both were accused falsely by Goldstein.) In the video of the discussion period, Jesse's lawyer at the time, Peter Panaro, said that he had advised Jesse not to appear on Rivera's talk show (Panaro was also present on the show), and in fact had Jesse sign an affidavit saying that he was doing so against legal advice. Subsequent legal developments In August 2010, a federal appeals court upheld the conviction of Jesse Friedman on technical legal grounds, but took the unusual step of urging prosecutors to reopen Friedman's case, saying that there was a \\"reasonable likelihood that Jesse Friedman was wrongfully convicted\\". The decision cited \\"overzealousness\\" by law enforcement officials swept up in the hysteria over child molestation in the 1980s. Following the appeals court ruling, the Nassau District Attorney's office began a three-year investigation led by District Attorney Kathleen M. Rice. On June 24, 2013, the report was released. In a 155-page report, the district attorney's office concluded that none of four issues raised in a strongly-worded 2010 ruling by the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit were substantiated by the evidence. Instead, it concluded, \\"By any impartial analysis, the reinvestigation process prompted by Jesse Friedman, his advocates and the Second Circuit, has only increased confidence in the integrity of Jesse Friedman's guilty plea and adjudication as a sex offender.\\" Jesse Friedman was regarded as a \\"narcissist\\" and a \\"psychopathic deviant\\" by a psychiatrist his attorney hired to conduct an evaluation. Boklan had been subject to \\"selectively edited and misleading film portrayals in Capturing the Friedmans\\". A four-member independent advisory panel guided and oversaw the work. It included Barry Scheck, a founder of the Innocence Project, one of the country's leading advocates for overturning wrongful convictions, and a member of O.J. Simpson's defense team. However, Scheck has subsequently complained that key documents were not available to the panel, and urged the matter be reopened. Prior to the report's release, details emerged, including letters from some of the alleged victims in which they recant their accusations and implicate the police in coercing their statements. Prior to the report's release, The Village Voice conducted an interview with Jesse Friedman, who described himself as \\"freakishly optimistic\\", and also reported that Ross Goldstein, a childhood friend of Jesse Friedman's, had broken his 25-year silence to explain he had been coerced into cooperating with the district attorney's office: \\"He told the review panel of how he'd been coerced into lying, how prosecutors coached him through details of the Friedmans' computer lab, which he'd never even seen, and how he was imprisoned for something he'd never done.\\" On February 10, 2015, Jesse Friedman was back in state appellate court seeking to have Nassau County prosecutors turn over to him the remainder of their evidence against him. A state Appeals Court found, in December 2015, that the prosecutors did not have to release the records. According to a spokesperson for the Nassau County District Attorney, because Friedman pleaded guilty and there was no trial, the records of witnesses who did not testify are confidential, and the law does not mandate their disclosure.

The related abstract noun - banausia is defined by Hesychius as \\"every craft () [conducted] by means of fire\\", reflecting the folk etymology of the word as coming from (baunos) \\"furnace\\" and (au≈ç) \\"to dry\\".Banausie. In: Heinrich August Pierer, Julius L√∂be (in German): Universal-Lexikon der Gegenwart und Vergangenheit. Fourth ed., vol. 2; Altenburg 1857, page 264 (Online bei zeno.org) The actual etymology of the words is unknown; they are not attested outside Attic-Ionic or before the 5th century BC. The epic heroes call their smiths - dƒìmiourgoi. Athenian usage The use of banausos follows an economic transition in Greece: the use of coinage, the invention of the trireme and of hoplite armor, the prevalence of chattel slavery permitted the rise of a new hoplite class, who used the term to distance themselves from the artisans. Banausos was used as a term of invective, meaning \\"cramped in body\\" (Politics 1341 a 7) and \\"vulgar in taste\\" (1337 b 7), by the extreme oligarchs in Athens in the 5th century BC, who were led by Critias. In this usage, it refers to the laboring class as a whole; i.e. the artisans, such as potters, stonemasons, carpenters, professional singers, artists, musicians, and all persons engaged in trade or retail. It makes no distinction between slave or free. These extreme oligarchs were opposed both to the moderate oligarchs, such as Theramenes, and to the democrats, such as Pericles, Cleon, and Thrasybulus. They held power at Athens for less than a year, with the assistance of a Spartan army; because of their use of exile, purges, midnight arrests, and judicial murder, are remembered as the Thirty Tyrants. But while they vanished from the political scene, the word remained. Philosophers Plato, the philosopher, was Critias's nephew, and used banausos in much the same sense, although in the Republic he preferred the installation of philosophers, such as himself, above the hoplites, who were in turn above the artisan. It was also current among the first generation of his pupils, such as Aristotle, who writes, \\"Those who provide necessaries for an individual are slaves, and those who provide them for society are handicraftsmen and day-laborers.\\" Plato further held that commerce had a corrupting influence in communities and acquisition of wealth destroyed their - homonoia (like-mindedness) and was the principal cause of - stasis (faction). He also held that \\"merchants and craftsmen would be less willing to defend the civic territory than farmers would\\" and commerce and mercantilism had a morally corrupting influence. Plato was concerned with the \\"best\\" state, which requires citizens who are the best and because they possess arete. This is in contrast to the attitude, cited by Heraclitus: \\"We will have none best among us; if any among us would be the best, let him be so elsewhere and among others.\\" Plato argued, and Aristotle follows him in this, although not in other things, that the pursuit of arete required leisure. Technical education was necessary but did not make good citizens. Leisure was a necessity of good citizenship ‚Äì something the banausoi do not have. Banausia deforms the body, rendering it useless for military and political duties. Those occupations tire out the body and therefore the mind preventing self-education by reading and conversing with others. \\"It accustoms a man's mind to low ideas, and absorbs him in the pursuit of the mere means of life.\\" Plato and Aristotle teach that the highest thing in man is reason and therefore, the purpose of human perfection lies with the activity of reason; i.e. the 'theoretic' or contemplative life. Trade, industry and mechanical labour prevent this idea. These activities are necessary for a good human condition of life but when these activities are merely regarded as means to making money and not as acts of service to truth, service to others and arete, then these, occupations become base. After the time of Alexander the Great, however, philosophers largely avoided practical politics. Thereafter banausos mostly appears in glossaries to Plato and Aristotle. Later philosophic schools had different politics. For example, Cassius Dio defined democracy (dƒìmokrate√≠a) thus: \\"when every man gets the honor that is his due.\\" Revivals It has been conjectured that the Elizabethan use of \\"mechanical\\" (as in e.g. Shakespeare's Midsummer Night's Dream) is a translation of banausos. This is certainly possible -- the earliest recorded use of \\"mechanical\\" (OED s.v.) is from John Lyly, who used a linguistic style with many influences from Greek. Banausos (or rather - banausikos) has also been adapted into English, as the rare word banausic, both as a term of abuse, and to represent Greek usage. According to Dagobert D. Runes' Dictionary of Philosophy, it means \\"vulgar and illiberal\\", particularly when referring to arts or occupations that \\"deform the body or the mind.\\" Its use in English is not found before 1845, with the Victorian revival of classical learning. One of the contributions of classical philology to the Kultur-movement in Wilhelmine and post-Wilhelmine Germany was the use of banausisch as an insult -- along with the myths that the German Soul is essentially Greek, that the ancient Greeks were blond, and that the modern Greeks are not descended from them. Today in German Banause is used to mean an uncouth person indifferent to high culture, like English philistine. These ideas have become less accepted since World War II, but they were occasionally reflected in the English-speaking world. For example, Edith Hamilton accepted them as the best scholarship of her school days. Again, a junior colleague of Sir Gilbert Murray permitted himself (in 1935) the following, which goes well beyond Greek usage: :The aim of a journalist may either be to enlarge the circulation of a paper or to give his readers a true and intelligent picture of the world; of a lawyer either to extend his practice or to help justice be done; of a business man either to grow rich or to play his part as a 'nurse' of the community. These alternatives are not exclusive. But where the former predominates, the amount of arete generated will be small, and journalists, lawyers and industrialists will be banausoi rather than men.

Elvis Weinstein, is an American writer and performer, best known for his roles as Dr. Laurence Erhardt and the original puppeteer and voice for Tom Servo and Gypsy on Mystery Science Theater 3000. He should not be confused with the similarly named Josh Weinstein, longtime writer on The Simpsons. Mystery Science Theater 3000 Weinstein was one of the founding writers/performers of the show in 1988 at the age of 17. Weinstein worked on Mystery Science Theater 3000 during its original appearance on Minneapolis UHF station KTMA-TV from 1988 to 1989, and its first season on Comedy Central (then called the Comedy Channel) from 1989 to 1990. However, a significant age gap existed between him and the other cast members; he was only 17 when he joined the show, having been recruited by Joel from his \\"Creative Stand-Up and Smartology\\" comedy classes. This ultimately led to Weinstein feeling unhappy with the more professional approach to the show the move to the Comedy Channel demanded, and caused him to leave the show.https://www.youtube.com/v/I3tP8bxfV-s In an April 2019 episode of Bill Corbett‚Äôs Funhouse podcast, Weinstein elaborated on his experience at Best Brains, claiming that MST3K producer, Jim Mallon, was openly hostile toward him and used the age disparity between him and the rest of the cast as a pretext for paying him significantly less for his work on the show than his cohorts. In 2018, Weinstein returned to the show, providing guest appearances in two of the twelfth season's episodes. Work after MST3K After leaving Mystery Science Theater 3000, Weinstein became a writer for The Young Person's Guide to Becoming a Rock Star and Malcolm and Eddie; he also served as writer and producer for the NBC dramedy Freaks and Geeks. He changed his professional name from \\"Josh\\" to \\"J. Elvis\\" to avoid confusion with former Simpsons writer Josh Weinstein. He was head writer for NBC's late night show Later with Greg Kinnear and America's Funniest Home Videos. Weinstein has an extensive background in stand-up comedy; he has performed over a thousand shows as a stand-up comedian, and has written material for Garry Shandling, Dennis Miller, Roseanne Barr, Louie Anderson and other comedians.

Associated with musical genres including Afropop, jazz, and world music, she was an advocate against apartheid and white-minority government in South Africa. Born in Johannesburg to Swazi and Xhosa parents, Makeba was forced to find employment as a child after the death of her father. She had a brief and allegedly abusive first marriage at the age of 17, gave birth to her only child in 1950, and survived breast cancer. Her vocal talent had been recognized when she was a child, and she began singing professionally in the 1950s, with the Cuban Brothers, the Manhattan Brothers, and an all-woman group, the Skylarks, performing a mixture of jazz, traditional African melodies, and Western popular music. In 1959, Makeba had a brief role in the anti-apartheid film Come Back, Africa, which brought her international attention, and led to her performing in Venice, London, and New York City. In London, she met the American singer Harry Belafonte, who became a mentor and colleague. She moved to New York City, where she became immediately popular, and recorded her first solo album in 1960. Her attempt to return to South Africa that year for her mother's funeral was prevented by the country's government. Makeba's career flourished in the United States, and she released several albums and songs, her most popular being \\"Pata Pata\\" (1967). Along with Belafonte she received a Grammy Award for her 1965 album An Evening with Belafonte/Makeba. She testified against the South African government at the United Nations and became involved in the civil rights movement. She married Stokely Carmichael, a leader of the Black Panther Party, in 1968. As a result, she lost support among white Americans and faced hostility from the US government, leading her and Carmichael to move to Guinea. She continued to perform, mostly in African countries, including at several independence celebrations. She began to write and perform music more explicitly critical of apartheid; the 1977 song \\"Soweto Blues\\", written by her former husband Hugh Masekela, was about the Soweto uprising. After apartheid was dismantled in 1990, Makeba returned to South Africa. She continued recording and performing, including a 1991 album with Nina Simone and Dizzy Gillespie, and appeared in the 1992 film Sarafina!. She was named a UN goodwill ambassador in 1999, and campaigned for humanitarian causes. She died of a heart attack during a 2008 concert in Italy. Makeba was among the first African musicians to receive worldwide recognition. She brought African music to a Western audience, and popularized the world music and Afropop genres. She also made popular several songs critical of apartheid, and became a symbol of opposition to the system, particularly after her right to return was revoked. Upon her death, former South African President Nelson Mandela said that \\"her music inspired a powerful sense of hope in all of us.\\" Early years =Childhood and family= Zenzile Miriam Makeba was born on 4 March 1932 in the black township of Prospect, near Johannesburg. Her Swazi mother, Christina Makeba, was a sangoma, or traditional healer, and a domestic worker. Her Xhosa father, Caswell Makeba, was a teacher; he died when she was six years old. Makeba later said that before she was conceived, her mother had been warned that any future pregnancy could be fatal. Neither Miriam nor her mother seemed likely to survive after a difficult labour and delivery. Miriam's grandmother, who attended the birth, often muttered \\"uzenzile\\", a Xhosa word that means \\"you brought this on yourself\\", to Miriam's mother during her recovery, which inspired her to give her daughter the name \\"Zenzile\\". When Makeba was eighteen days old, her mother was arrested and sentenced to a six-month prison term for selling umqombothi, a homemade beer brewed from malt and cornmeal. The family could not afford the small fine required to avoid a jail term, and Miriam spent the first six months of her life in jail. As a child, Makeba sang in the choir of the Kilnerton Training Institute in Pretoria, an all-black Methodist primary school that she attended for eight years. Her talent for singing earned her praise at school. Makeba was baptised a Protestant, and sang in church choirs, in English, Xhosa, Sotho, and Zulu; she later said that she learned to sing in English before she could speak the language. The family moved to the Transvaal when Makeba was a child. After her father's death, she was forced to find employment; she did domestic work, and worked as a nanny. She described herself as a shy person at the time. Her mother worked for white families in Johannesburg, and had to live away from her six children. Makeba lived for a while with her grandmother and a large number of cousins in Pretoria. Makeba was influenced by her family's musical tastes; her mother played several traditional instruments, and her elder brother collected records, including those of Duke Ellington and Ella Fitzgerald, and taught Makeba songs. Her father played the piano, and his musical inclination was later a factor in Makeba's family accepting what was seen as a risque choice of career. In 1949, Makeba married James Kubay, a policeman in training, with whom she had her only child, Bongi Makeba, in 1950. Makeba was then diagnosed with breast cancer, and her husband, who was said to have beaten her, left her shortly afterwards, after a two-year marriage. A decade later she overcame cervical cancer via a hysterectomy. =Early career= Makeba began her professional musical career with the Cuban Brothers, a South African all-male close harmony group, with whom she sang covers of popular American songs. Soon afterwards, at the age of 21, she joined a jazz group, the Manhattan Brothers, who sang a mixture of South African songs and pieces from popular African- American groups. Makeba was the only woman in the group. With the Manhattan Brothers she recorded her first hit, \\"Laku Tshoni Ilanga\\", in 1953, and developed a national reputation as a musician. In 1956 she joined a new all- woman group, the Skylarks, singing a blend of jazz and traditional South African melodies. Formed by Gallotone Records, the group was also known as the Sunbeams. Makeba sang with the Skylarks when the Manhattan Brothers were travelling abroad; later, she also travelled with the Manhattan Brothers. In the Skylarks, Makeba sang alongside Rhodesian-born musician Dorothy Masuka, whose music Makeba had followed, along with that of Dolly Rathebe. Several of the Skylarks' pieces from this period became popular; the music historian Rob Allingham later described the group as \\"real trendsetters, with harmonisation that had never been heard before.\\" Makeba received no royalties from her work with the Skylarks. While performing with the Manhattan Brothers in 1955, Makeba met Nelson Mandela, then a young lawyer; he later remembered the meeting, and that he felt that the girl he met \\"was going to be someone.\\" In 1956, Gallotone Records released \\"Lovely Lies\\", Makeba's first solo success; the Xhosa lyric about a man looking for his beloved in jails and hospitals was replaced with the unrelated and innocuous line \\"You tell such lovely lies with your two lovely eyes\\" in the English version. The record became the first South African record to chart on the United States Billboard Top 100. In 1957, Makeba was featured on the cover of Drum magazine. alt=A young black man singing In 1959, Makeba sang the lead female role in the Broadway-inspired South African jazz opera King Kong; among those in the cast was the musician Hugh Masekela. The musical was performed to racially integrated audiences, raising her profile among white South Africans. Also in 1959, she had a short guest appearance in Come Back, Africa, an anti-apartheid film produced and directed by the American independent filmmaker Lionel Rogosin. Rogosin cast her after seeing her on stage in African Jazz and Variety show, on which Makeba was a performer for 18 months. The film blended elements of documentary and fiction and had to be filmed in secret as the government was expected to be hostile to it. Makeba appeared on stage, and sang two songs: her appearance lasted four minutes. The cameo made an enormous impression on viewers, and Rogosin organised a visa for her to attend the premiere of the film at the twenty-fourth Venice Film Festival in Italy, where the film won the prestigious Critics' Choice Award. Makeba's presence has been described as crucial to the film, as an emblem of cosmopolitan black identity that also connected with working-class black people due to the dialogue being in Zulu. Makeba's role in Come Back, Africa brought her international recognition and she travelled to London and New York to perform. In London she met the American singer Harry Belafonte, who became her mentor, helping her with her first solo recordings. These included \\"Pata Pata\\", which would be released many years later, and a version of the traditional Xhosa song \\"Qongqothwane\\", which she had first performed with the Skylarks. Though \\"Pata Pata\\"‚Äîdescribed by Musician magazine as a \\"groundbreaking Afropop gem\\"‚Äîbecame her most famous song, Makeba described it as \\"one of my most insignificant songs\\". While in England, she married Sonny Pillay, a South African ballad singer of Indian descent; they divorced within a few months. Makeba then moved to New York, making her US music debut on 1 November 1959 on The Steve Allen Show in Los Angeles for a television audience of 60 million. Her New York debut at the Village Vanguard occurred soon after; she sang in Xhosa and Zulu, and performed a Yiddish folk song. Her audience at this concert included Miles Davis and Duke Ellington; her performance received strongly positive reviews from critics. She first came to popular and critical attention in jazz clubs, after which her reputation grew rapidly. Belafonte, who had helped Makeba with her move to the US, handled the logistics for her first performances. When she first moved to the US, Makeba lived in Greenwich Village, along with other musicians and actors. As was common in her profession, she experienced some financial insecurity, and worked as a babysitter for a period. Exile =United States= Breakthrough Soon after the Sharpeville massacre in 1960, Makeba learned that her mother had died. When she tried to return home for the funeral, she found that her South African passport had been cancelled. Two of Makeba's family members were killed in the massacre. The incident left her concerned about her family, many of whom were still in South Africa, including her daughter: the nine-year-old Bongi joined her mother in the US in August 1960. During her first few years in the US, Makeba had rarely sung explicitly political music, but her popularity had led to an increase in awareness of apartheid and the anti-apartheid movement. Following the Sharpeville killings, Makeba felt a responsibility to help, as she had been able to leave the country while others had not. From this point, she became an increasingly outspoken critic of apartheid and the white-minority government; before the massacre, she had taken care to avoid overtly political statements in South Africa. Her musical career in the US continued to flourish. She signed a recording contract with RCA Victor, and released Miriam Makeba, her first studio album, in 1960, backed by Belafonte's band. RCA Victor chose to buy out Makeba's contract with Gallotone Records, and despite the fact that Makeba was unable to perform in South Africa, Gallotone received US$45,000 in the deal, which meant that Makeba received no royalties for her debut album. The album included one of her most famous hits in the US, \\"Qongqothwane\\", which was known in English as \\"The Click Song\\" because Makeba's audiences could not pronounce the Xhosa name. Time magazine called her the \\"most exciting new singing talent to appear in many years\\", and Newsweek compared her voice to \\"the smoky tones and delicate phrasing\\" of Ella Fitzgerald and the \\"intimate warmth\\" of Frank Sinatra. The album was not commercially successful, and Makeba was briefly dropped from RCA Victor: she was re-signed soon after as the label recognised the commercial possibilities of the growing interest in African culture. Her South African identity had been downplayed during her first signing, but it was strongly emphasised the second time to take advantage of this interest. Makeba made several appearances on television, often in the company of Belafonte. In 1962, Makeba and Belafonte sang at the birthday party for US President John F. Kennedy at Madison Square Garden, but Makeba did not go to the party afterwards because she was ill. Kennedy nevertheless insisted on meeting her, so Belafonte sent a car to pick her up. In 1964, Makeba released her second studio album for RCA Victor, The World of Miriam Makeba. An early example of world music, the album peaked at number eighty-six on the Billboard 200. Makeba's music had a cross-racial appeal in the US; white Americans were attracted to her image as an \\"exotic\\" African performer, and black Americans related their own experiences of racial segregation to Makeba's struggle against apartheid. Makeba found company among other African exiles and √©migr√©s in New York, including Hugh Masekela, to whom she was married from 1963 to 1968. During their marriage, Makeba and Masekela were neighbours of the jazz musician Dizzy Gillespie in Englewood, New Jersey; they spent much of their time in Harlem. She also came to know actors Marlon Brando and Lauren Bacall, and musicians Louis Armstrong and Ray Charles. Fellow singer-activist Nina Simone became friendly with Makeba, as did actor Cicely Tyson; Makeba and Simone performed together at Carnegie Hall. Makeba was among black entertainers, activists, and intellectuals in New York at the time who believed that the civil rights movement and popular culture could reinforce each other, creating \\"a sense of intertwined political and cultural vibrancy\\"; other examples included Maya Angelou and Sidney Poitier. She later described her difficulty living with racial segregation, saying \\"There wasn't much difference in America; it was a country that had abolished slavery but there was apartheid in its own way.\\" Travel and activism Makeba being welcomed during a visit to Israel in 1963 Makeba's music was also popular in Europe, and she travelled and performed there frequently. Acting on the advice of Belafonte, she added songs from Latin America, Europe, Israel, and elsewhere in Africa to her repertoire. She visited Kenya in 1962 in support of the country's independence from British colonial rule, and raised funds for its independence leader Jomo Kenyatta. Later that year she testified before the United Nations Special Committee against Apartheid about the effects of the system, asking for economic sanctions against South Africa's National Party government. She requested an arms embargo against South Africa, on the basis that weapons sold to the government would likely be used against black women and children. As a result, her music was banned in South Africa, and her South African citizenship and right to return were revoked. Makeba thus became a stateless person, but she was soon issued passports by Algeria, Guinea, Belgium and Ghana. In her life, she held nine passports, and was granted honorary citizenship in ten countries. Soon after her testimony, Haile Selassie, the emperor of Ethiopia, invited her to sing at the inauguration of the Organisation of African Unity, the only performer to be invited. As the fact of her ban from South Africa became well known she became a cause c√©l√©bre for Western liberals, and her presence in the civil rights movement provided a link between that movement and the anti-apartheid struggle. In 1964 she was taught the song \\"Malaika\\" by a Kenyan student while backstage at a performance in San Francisco; the song later became a staple of her performances. Throughout the 1960s, Makeba strengthened her involvement with a range of black-centred political movements, including the civil rights, anti-apartheid, Black Consciousness, and Black Power movements. She briefly met the Trinidadian-American activist Stokely Carmichael‚Äîthe leader of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee and a prominent figure in the Black Panther Party‚Äîafter Belafonte invited him to one of Makeba's concerts; they met again in Conakry six years later. They entered a relationship, initially kept secret from all but their closest friends and family. Makeba participated in fundraising activities for various civil rights groups, including a benefit concert for the 1962 Southern Christian Leadership Conference that civil rights activist Martin Luther King Jr. referred to as the \\"event of the year\\". Following a concert and rally in Atlanta in support of King, Makeba and others were denied entrance to a restaurant as a result of Jim Crow laws, leading to a televised protest in front of the establishment. She also criticised King's Southern Christian Leadership Conference for its investment in South African companies, informing press that \\"Now my friend of long standing supports the country's persecution of my people and I must find a new idol\\". Her identity as an African woman in the civil rights movement helped create \\"an emerging liberal consensus\\" that extreme racial discrimination, whether domestically or internationally, was harmful. In 1964 she testified at the UN for a second time, quoting a song by Vanessa Redgrave in calling for quick action against the South African government. On 15 March 1966, Makeba and Belafonte received the Grammy Award for Best Folk Recording for An Evening with Belafonte/Makeba. The album dealt with the political plight of black South Africans under apartheid, including several songs critical of the South African government, such as \\"Ndodemnyama we Verwoerd\\" (\\"Watch our Verwoerd\\", a reference to Hendrik Verwoerd, one of the architects of apartheid). It sold widely and raised Makeba's profile in the US; Belafonte and Makeba's concert tour following its release was often sold out, and the album has been described as the best they made together. Makeba's use of lyrics in Swahili, Xhosa, and Sotho led to her being seen as a representation of an \\"authentic\\" Africa by American audiences. In 1967, more than ten years after she first recorded the song, the single \\"Pata Pata\\" was released in the US on an album of the same title, and became a worldwide hit. During its recording, she and Belafonte had a disagreement, after which they stopped recording together. =Guinea= Makeba in 1969 Makeba married Carmichael in March 1968; this caused her popularity in the US to decline markedly. Conservatives came to regard her as a militant and an extremist, an image that alienated much of her fanbase. Her performances were cancelled and her coverage in the press declined despite her efforts to portray her marriage as apolitical. White American audiences stopped supporting her, and the US government took an interest in her activities. The Central Intelligence Agency began following her, and placed hidden microphones in her apartment; the Federal Bureau of Investigation also placed her under surveillance. While she and her husband were travelling in the Bahamas, she was banned from returning to the US, and was refused a visa. As a result, the couple moved to Guinea, where Carmichael changed his name to Kwame Tour√©. Makeba did not return to the US until 1987. Guinea remained Makeba's home for the next 15 years, and she and her husband became close to President Ahmed S√©kou Tour√© and his wife, Andr√©e. Tour√© wanted to create a new style of African music, and all musicians received a minimum wage if they practised for several hours every day. Makeba later stated that \\"I've never seen a country that did what S√©kou Tour√© did for artists.\\" After her rejection from the US she began to write music more directly critical of the US government's racial policies, recording and singing songs such as \\"Lumumba\\" in 1970 (referring to Patrice Lumumba, the assassinated Prime Minister of the Congo), and \\"Malcolm X\\" in 1974. Makeba performed more frequently in African countries, and as countries became independent of European colonial powers, was invited to sing at independence ceremonies, including in Kenya, Angola, Zambia, Tanganyika, and Mozambique. In September 1974 she performed alongside a multitude of well-known African and American musicians at the Zaire 74 festival in Kinshasa, Zaire (formerly the Congo). She also became a diplomat for Ghana, and was appointed Guinea's official delegate to the UN in 1975; that year, she addressed the United Nations General Assembly. She continued to perform in Europe and Asia, as well as her African concerts, but not in the US, where a de facto boycott was in effect. Her performances in Africa were immensely popular: she was described as the highlight of FESTAC 77, a Pan- African arts festival in Nigeria in 1977, and during a Liberian performance of \\"Pata Pata\\", the stadium proved so loud that she was unable to complete the song. \\"Pata Pata\\", like her other songs, had been banned in South Africa. Another song she sang frequently in this period was \\"Nkosi Sikelel' iAfrika\\", though she never recorded it. Makeba later stated that it was during this period that she accepted the label \\"Mama Africa\\". In 1976, the South African government replaced English with Afrikaans as the medium of instruction in all schools, setting off the Soweto uprising. Between 15,000 and 20,000 students took part; caught unprepared, the police opened fire on the protesting children, killing hundreds and injuring more than a thousand. Hugh Masekela wrote \\"Soweto Blues\\" in response to the massacre, and the song was performed by Makeba, becoming a staple of her live performances for many years. A review in the magazine Musician said that the song had \\"searingly righteous lyrics\\" about the uprising that \\"cut to the bone\\". She had separated from Carmichael in 1973; in 1978 they divorced and in 1981 she married Bageot Bah, an airline executive. =Belgium= Makeba's daughter Bongi, who was a singer in her own right and had often accompanied her mother on stage, died in childbirth in 1985. Makeba was left responsible for her two grandchildren, and decided to move out of Guinea. She settled in the Woluwe-Saint-Lambert district of the Belgian capital Brussels. In the following year, Masekela introduced Makeba to Paul Simon, and a few months later she embarked on Simon's very successful Graceland Tour. The tour concluded with two concerts held in Harare, Zimbabwe, which were filmed in 1987 for release as Graceland: The African Concert. After touring the world with Simon, Warner Bros. Records signed Makeba and she released Sangoma (\\"Healer\\"), an album of healing chants named in honour of her sangoma mother. Her involvement with Simon caused controversy: Graceland had been recorded in South Africa, breaking the cultural boycott of the country, and thus Makeba's participation in the tour was regarded as contravening the boycott (which Makeba herself endorsed). In preparation for the Graceland tour, she worked with journalist James Hall to write an autobiography titled Makeba: My Story. The book contained descriptions of her experience with apartheid, and was also critical of the commodification and consumerism she experienced in the US. The book was translated into five languages. She took part in the Nelson Mandela 70th Birthday Tribute, a popular-music concert staged on 11 June 1988 at London's Wembley Stadium, and broadcast to an audience of 600 million across 67 countries. Political aspects of the concert were heavily censored in the US by the Fox television network. The use of music to raise awareness of apartheid paid off: a survey after the concert found that among people aged between 16 and 24, three-quarters knew of Mandela, and supported his release from prison. Return to South Africa, final years and death Following growing pressure from the anti-apartheid movement both domestically and internationally, in 1990 State President Frederik Willem de Klerk reversed the ban on the African National Congress and other anti-apartheid organisations, and announced that Mandela would shortly be released from prison. Mandela was released in February 1990. He persuaded Makeba to return to South Africa, which she did, using her French passport, on 10 June 1990. Makeba and Dizzy Gillespie in Calvados, France, 1991 Makeba, Gillespie, Simone, and Masekela recorded and released her studio album, Eyes on Tomorrow, in 1991. It combined jazz, R&B;, pop, and traditional African music, and was a hit across Africa. Makeba and Gillespie then toured the world together to promote it. In November she made a guest appearance on a US sitcom, The Cosby Show. In 1992, she starred in the film Sarafina!, which centred on students involved in the 1976 Soweto uprising. Makeba portrayed the title character's mother, Angelina, a role which The New York Times described as having been performed with \\"immense dignity\\". On 16 October 1999, Makeba was named a Goodwill Ambassador of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. In January 2000, her album, Homeland, produced by the New York City based record label Putumayo World Music, was nominated for a Grammy Award in the Best World Music Album category. She worked closely with Gra√ßa Machel-Mandela, the South African first lady, advocating for children suffering from HIV/AIDS, child soldiers, and the physically handicapped. She established the Makeba Centre for Girls, a home for orphans, described in an obituary as her most personal project. She also took part in the 2002 documentary Amandla!: A Revolution in Four-Part Harmony, which examined the struggles of black South Africans against apartheid through the music of the period. Makeba's second autobiography, Makeba: The Miriam Makeba Story, was published in 2004. In 2005 she announced that she would retire and began a farewell tour, but despite having osteoarthritis, continued to perform until her death. During this period, her grandchildren Nelson Lumumba Lee and Zenzi Lee, and her great-grandchild Lindelani, occasionally joined her performances. On 9 November 2008, Makeba fell ill during a concert in Castel Volturno, near Caserta, Italy. The concert had been organised to support the writer Roberto Saviano in his stand against the Camorra, a criminal organisation active in the Campania region. She suffered a heart attack after singing her hit song \\"Pata Pata\\", and was taken to the Pineta Grande clinic, where doctors were unable to revive her. Music and image =Musical style= The groups with which Makeba began her career performed mbube, a style of vocal harmony which drew on American jazz, ragtime, and Anglican church hymns, as well as indigenous styles of music. Johannesburg musician Dolly Rathebe was an early influence on Makeba's music, as were female jazz singers from the US. Historian David Coplan writes that the \\"African jazz\\" made popular by Makeba and others was \\"inherently hybridized\\" rather than derivative of any particular genre, blending as it did marabi and jazz, and was \\"Americanized African music, not Africanized American music\\". The music that she performed was described by British writer Robin Denselow as a \\"unique blend of rousing township styles and jazz-influenced balladry\\". Makeba released more than 30 albums during her career. The dominant styles of these shifted over time, moving from African jazz to recordings influenced by Belafonte's \\"crooning\\" to music drawing from traditional South African musical forms. She has been associated with the genres of world music and Afropop. She also incorporated Latin American musical styles into her performances. Historian Ruth Feldstein described her music as \\"[crossing] the borders between what many people associated with avant-garde and 'quality' culture and the commercial mainstream\\"; the latter aspect often drew criticism. She was able to appeal to audiences from many political, racial, and national backgrounds. She was known for having a dynamic vocal range, and was described as having an emotional awareness during her performances. She occasionally danced during her shows, and was described as having a sensuous presence on stage. She was able to vary her voice considerably: an obituary remarked that she \\"could soar like an opera singer, but she could also whisper, roar, hiss, growl and shout. She could sing while making the epiglottal clicks of the Xhosa language.\\" She sang in English and several African languages, but never in Afrikaans, the language of the apartheid government in South Africa. She once stated \\"When Afrikaaners sing in my language, then I will sing theirs.\\" English was seen as the language of political resistance by black South Africans due to the educational barriers they faced under apartheid; the Manhattan Brothers, with whom Makeba had sung in Sophiatown, had been prohibited from recording in English. Her songs in African languages have been described as reaffirming black pride. =Politics and perception= Makeba said that she did not perform political music, but music about her personal life in South Africa, which included describing the pain she felt living under apartheid. She once stated \\"people say I sing politics, but what I sing is not politics, it is the truth\\", an example of the mixing of personal and political issues for musicians living during apartheid. When she first entered the US, she avoided discussing apartheid explicitly, partly out of concern for her family still in South Africa. Nonetheless, she is known for using her voice to convey the political message of opposition to apartheid, performing widely and frequently for civil rights and anti-apartheid organisations. Even songs that did not carry an explicitly political message were seen as subversive, due to their being banned in South Africa. Makeba saw her music as a tool of activism, saying \\"In our struggle, songs are not simply entertainment for us. They are the way we communicate.\\" Makeba's use of the clicks common in languages such as Xhosa and Zulu (as in \\"Qongqothwane\\", \\"The Click Song\\") was frequently remarked upon by Western audiences. It contributed to her popularity and her exotic image, which scholars have described as a kind of othering, exacerbated by the fact that Western audiences often could not understand her lyrics. Critics in the US described her as the \\"African tribeswoman\\" and as an \\"import from South Africa\\", often depicting her in condescending terms as a product of a more primitive society. Commentators also frequently described her in terms of the prominent men she was associated with, despite her own prominence. During her early career in South Africa she had been seen as a sex symbol, an image that received considerably less attention in the US. Makeba was described as a style icon, both in her home country and the US. She wore no makeup and refused to straighten her hair for shows, thus helping establish a style that came to be known internationally as the \\"Afro look\\". According to music scholar Tanisha Ford, her hairstyle represented a \\"liberated African beauty aesthetic\\". She was seen as a beauty icon by South African schoolgirls, who were compelled to shorten their hair by the apartheid government. Makeba stuck to wearing African jewellery; she disapproved of the skin-lighteners common among South African women at the time, and refused to appear in advertisements for them. Her self-presentation has been characterised by scholars as a rejection of the predominantly white standards of beauty that women in the US were held to, which allowed Makeba to partially escape the sexualisation directed at women performers during this period. Nonetheless, the terms used to describe her in the US media have been identified by scholars as frequently used to \\"sexualize, infantalize, and animalize\\" people of African heritage. Legacy =Musical influence= Makeba has been credited with popularising world music, along with artists such as Youssou N'Dour, Salif Keita, Ang√©lique Kidjo, Ali Farka Tour√©, and Baaba Maal (pictured clockwise from top left). Makeba was among the most visible Africans in the US; as a result, she was often emblematic of the continent of Africa for Americans. Her music earned her the moniker \\"Mama Africa\\", and she was variously described as the \\"Empress of African Song\\", the \\"Queen of South African music\\", and Africa's \\"first superstar\\". Music scholar J. U. Jacobs said that Makeba's music had \\"both been shaped by and given shape to black South African and American music\\". The jazz musician Abbey Lincoln is among those identified as being influenced by Makeba. Makeba and Simone were among a group of artists who helped shape soul music. Longtime collaborator Belafonte called her \\"the most revolutionary new talent to appear in any medium in the last decade\\". Speaking after her death, Mandela called her \\"South Africa's first lady of song\\", and said that \\"her music inspired a powerful sense of hope in all of us.\\" Outside her home country Makeba was credited with bringing African music to a Western audience, and along with artists such as Youssou N'Dour, Salif Keita, Ali Farka Tour√©, Baaba Maal and Ang√©lique Kidjo, with popularising the genre of world music. Her work with Belafonte in the 1960s has been described as creating the genre of world music before the concept entered the popular imagination, and also as highlighting the diversity and cultural pluralism within African music. Within South Africa, Makeba has been described as influencing artists such as kwaito musician Thandiswa Mazwai and her band Bongo Maffin, whose track \\"De Makeba\\" was a modified version of Makeba's \\"Pata Pata\\", and one of several tribute recordings released after her return to South Africa. South African jazz musician Simphiwe Dana has been described as \\"the new Miriam Makeba\\". South African singer Lira has frequently been compared with Makeba, particularly for her performance of \\"Pata Pata\\" during the opening ceremony of the 2010 Football World Cup. A year later, Kidjo dedicated her concert in New York to Makeba, as a musician who had \\"paved the way for her success\\". In an obituary, scholar Lara Allen referred to Makeba as \\"arguably South Africa's most famous musical export\\". In 2016 the French singer Jain released \\"Makeba\\", a tribute. =Activism= Makeba was among the most visible people campaigning against the apartheid system in South Africa, and was responsible for popularising several anti-apartheid songs, including \\"Meadowlands\\" by Strike Vilakezi and \\"Ndodemnyama we Verwoerd\\" (Watch out, Verwoerd) by Vuyisile Mini. Due to her high profile, she became a spokesperson of sorts for Africans living under oppressive governments, and in particular for black South Africans living under apartheid. When the South African government prevented her from entering her home country, she became a symbol of \\"apartheid's cruelty\\", and she used her position as a celebrity by testifying against apartheid before the UN in 1962 and 1964. Many of her songs were banned within South Africa, leading to Makeba's records being distributed underground, and even her apolitical songs being seen as subversive. She thus became a symbol of resistance to the white- minority government both within and outside South Africa. In an interview in 2000, Masekela said that \\"there [was] nobody in Africa who made the world more aware of what was happening in South Africa than Miriam Makeba.\\" Makeba has also been associated with the movement against colonialism, with the civil rights and black power movements in the US, and with the Pan-African movement. She called for unity between black people of African descent across the world: \\"Africans who live everywhere should fight everywhere. The struggle is no different in South Africa, the streets of Chicago, Trinidad or Canada. The Black people are the victims of capitalism, racism and oppression, period\\". After marrying Carmichael she often appeared with him during his speeches; Carmichael later described her presence at these events as an asset, and Feldstein wrote that Makeba enhanced Carmichael's message that \\"black is beautiful\\". Along with performers such as Simone, Lena Horne, and Abbey Lincoln, she used her position as a prominent musician to advocate for civil rights. Their activism has been described as simultaneously calling attention to racial and gender disparities, and highlighting \\"that the liberation they desired could not separate race from sex\\". Makeba's critique of second-wave feminism as being the product of luxury led to observers being unwilling to call her a feminist. Scholar Ruth Feldstein stated that Makeba and others influenced both black feminism and second-wave feminism through their advocacy, and the historian Jacqueline Castledine referred to her as one of the \\"most steadfast voices for social justice\\". =Awards and recognition= Makeba's 1965 collaboration with Harry Belafonte won a Grammy Award, making her the first African recording artist to win this award. Makeba shared the 2001 Polar Music Prize with Sofia Gubaidulina. They received their prize from Carl XVI Gustaf, the King of Sweden, during a nationally televised ceremony at Berwaldhallen, Stockholm, on 27 May 2002. Makeba won the Dag Hammarskj√∂ld Peace Prize in 1986, and in 2001 was awarded the Otto Hahn Peace Medal in Gold by the United Nations Association of Germany (DGVN) in Berlin, \\"for outstanding services to peace and international understanding\\". She also received several honorary doctorates. In 2004, she was voted 38th in a poll ranking 100 Great South Africans. Mama Africa, a musical about Makeba, was produced in South Africa by Niyi Coker. Originally titled Zenzi!, the musical premiered to a sold-out crowd in Cape Town on 26 May 2016. It was performed in the US in St. Louis, Missouri and at the Skirball Center for the Performing Arts in New York City between October and December 2016. The musical returned to South Africa in February 2017 for what would have been Makeba's 85th birthday. From 25 to 27 September 2009, a tribute television show to Makeba entitled Hommage √† Miriam Makeba and curated by Beninoise singer-songwriter and activist Ang√©lique Kidjo, was held at the Cirque d'hiver in Paris. The show was presented as Mama Africa: Celebrating Miriam Makeba at the Barbican in London on 21 November 2009. A documentary film titled Mama Africa, about Makeba's life, co-written and directed by Finnish director Mika Kaurism√§ki, was released in 2011. On 4 March 2013, and again on International Women's Day in 2017, Google honoured her with a Google Doodle on their homepage. In 2014 she was honoured (along with Nelson Mandela, Albertina Sisulu and Steve Biko) in the Belgian city of Ghent, which named a square after her, the \\"Miriam Makebaplein\\".

In many cultures the metal silver is generally valuable but less so than gold. Greek myth The original silver age (ŒëœÅŒ≥œÖœÅœåŒΩ ŒìŒ≠ŒΩŒøœÇ) was the second of the five \\"Ages of Man\\" described by the ancient poet Hesiod in his poem Works and Days, following the Golden age and preceding the Bronze Age. These people lived for one hundred years as children without growing up, then suddenly aged and died. Zeus destroyed these people because of their impiety, in the Ogygian Deluge. After Kronos was exiled, the world was ruled by Zeus. As a result of Pandora releasing the evils upon the world, a second generation of men and the age was called silver because the race of man was less noble than the race of the Golden Age. In the silver age Zeus reduced the spring, and reconstructed the year into four seasons, so that men for the first time sought the shelter of houses and had to labor to supply their food. The first seeds of grain were placed in the ground since now man had to gather their own food. A child grew up at his mother's side a hundred years, but adulthood lasted a short time. Being less noble than the Golden Age, humanity could not keep from fighting with one another, nor would they properly honor and or serve the immortals. The actions of the second generation infuriated Zeus, so in punishment he destroyed them. Other silver ages The term has been applied to a number of other periods following a \\"Golden Age\\", including: * The Silver Age of Latin literature * The Silver Age of Comic Books, the 2000 DC Comics series Silver Age was named after the period * The Silver Age of Russian Poetry * The Silver Age of Alpinism * The Treta Yuga of Vedic philosophy of the ages.

It is used to polish, passivate, and deburr metal parts. It is often described as the reverse of electroplating. It may be used in lieu of abrasive fine polishing in microstructural preparation.G.F. Vander Voort, ed., \\"Chemical and Electrolytic Polishing,\\" ASM Handbook, Vol. 9: Metallography and Microstructures, ASM International, 2004, p 281-293, . Mechanism Electropolishing principle: 1\\\\. Electrolyte 2\\\\. Cathode 3\\\\. Work-piece to polish (Anode) 4\\\\. Particle moving from the work-piece to the cathode 5\\\\. Surface before polishing 6\\\\. Surface after polishing Typically, the work-piece is immersed in a temperature-controlled bath of electrolyte and serves as the anode; it is connected to the positive terminal of a DC power supply, the negative terminal being attached to the cathode. A current passes from the anode, where metal on the surface is oxidised and dissolved in the electrolyte, to the cathode. At the cathode, a reduction reaction occurs, which normally produces hydrogen. Electrolytes used for electropolishing are most often concentrated acid solutions having a high viscosity, such as mixtures of sulfuric acid and phosphoric acid. Other electropolishing electrolytes reported in the literature include mixtures of perchloric acid with acetic anhydride (which has caused fatal explosions), and methanolic solutions of sulfuric acid. To electropolish a rough surface, the protruding parts of a surface profile must dissolve faster than the recesses. This process, referred to as anodic levelling, can be subject to incorrect analysis when measuring the surface topography. Anodic dissolution under electropolishing conditions deburrs metal objects due to increased current density on corners and burrs. Most importantly, successful electropolishing should operate under diffusion limited constant current plateau, achieved by following current dependence on voltage (polarisation curve), under constant temperature and stirring conditions. Applications Due to its ease of operation and its usefulness in polishing irregularly-shaped objects, electropolishing has become a common process in the production of semiconductors. As electropolishing can also be used to sterilize workpieces, the process plays an essential role in the food, medical, and pharmaceutical industries.https://www.thefabricator.com/article/finishing/electropolishing- applications-and-techniques\\"7 Industries That Depend on Electropolishing\\". https://www.electro-glo.com/7-industries-that-depend-on-electropolishing/ It is commonly used in the post-production of large metal pieces such as those used in drums of washing machines, bodies of ocean vessels and aircraft, and automobiles.https://www.ableelectropolishing.com/industry- solutions/aerospace/https://www.electro-glo.com/about-us/ While nearly any metal may be electropolished, the most-commonly polished metals are 300- and 400-series stainless steel, aluminum, copper, titanium, and nickel- and copper-alloys.https://www.delstar.com/metals-that-can-be- electropolishedhttps://www.electro-glo.com/electropolishing-products/ Ultra- high vacuum (UHV) components are typically electropolished in order to have a smoother surface for improved vacuum pressures, out-gassing rates, and pumping speed. Electropolishing is commonly used to prepare thin metal samples for transmission electron microscopy and atom probe tomography because the process does not mechanically deform surface layers like mechanical polishing does.

In a style written for the general audience, the book covers what modern psychology knows about the reasons for some of the most important aspects of human behavior. Contents Aronson begins the book by citing a number of scenarios, real and constructed -- reactions to the Kent State shootings, the Stanford prison experiments, and a four-year-old boy given a drum set among them -- that illustrate a variety of human behaviors seen in real life. The rest of the book is spent primarily on explaining how human minds operate and interact with each other, using these situations as examples. The book covering topics include the causes of prejudice, aggression, and cognitive dissonance. In explaining the reasons why people behave in unusual ways, Aronson cites his \\"first law\\": > People who do crazy things are not necessarily crazy. Style and use of experimental method As a scientist, Aronson leans on the importance of case work and experimental study. Thus, the Social Animal's explanations of human behavior are largely validated with citations of studies done by researchers of social psychology.

Life and work Fabiana Bravo was born in Guaymall√©n Department, outside Mendoza, Argentina, to a family of modest means. She moved to Buenos Aires at age 22, and actively sought parts in the city's vibrant theatre scene. She appeared in Jos√© Cibri√°n's Dr√°cula, and Peter MacFarlane's Broadway Follies and Broadway II, among other productions. It was a personally tailored full scholarship program at The Catholic University of America that brought Fabiana Bravo from Argentina to Washington DC. From there she also studied interpretation at the Renata Scotto Institute in Savona, Italy, and Verdian repertoire at the Verdi Opera Studio in Parma, Italy. Finally, she accepted a one-year scholarship program to study in Voghera, Italy, at the Academy of Vocal Arts. Her talent was noticed by singer Valeria Lynch, who hired Bravo and who, in 1995 introduced her to Italian tenor Luciano Pavarotti. Pavarotti included Bravo in an operatic talent contest, which she won, and which led to her role with Pavarotti as Lucia di Lammermoor at the Academy of Music in Philadelphia. Fabiana Bravo met with and performed for the United States Supreme Court in 1999, and has brought recognition of her hometown of Mendoza, through a series of very popular South American Recitals. She was added to the Metropolitan Opera Roster in the 2001/2002 season, and continues to perform in New York, Washington, D.C., San Francisco, and Chicago with regularity. She would go on to portray Tosca, Countess Almaviva, Leonora, Giorgetta, and Madama Butterfly in some of the world‚Äôs most renowned houses. In 1999, she was named Argentina's Woman of the Year for her remarkable contributions to the arts. She has also received numerous awards such as a Pl√°cido Domingo Operalia Finalist, Opera Index winner and Met Council Winner of the Regional Finalist Competition. In recent years, Bravo has sung the Countess Almaviva in The Marriage of Figaro (1997), Mimi in La boh√®me (1998), Donna Anna in Don Giovanni (1999) and the title role in Ariadne auf Naxos (2002), all in opera productions of Washington D.C's Summer Opera Theatre Company. She also sings with Virginia Opera, where her performance of Donna Anna brought her recognition as a much sought-after artist. She is now a renowned name in the international opera world, and performs in concert and opera throughout the world. Ms. Bravo currently resides in Washington, DC and Mendoza, Argentina.

Early life Tunku Muhriz is the only son out of six children of the late Tuanku Munawir ibni Almarhum Tuanku Abdul Rahman, the Yang di-Pertuan Besar of Negeri Sembilan from 1960 to 1967, and of his consort, Tunku Ampuan Durah binti Almarhum Tunku Besar Burhanuddin. Born in 1948, Tunku Muhriz received his early education at the Tuanku Muhammad and Tunku Besar Schools in Tampin, the King George V School in Seremban, Negeri Sembilan and later at the Aldenham School in the United Kingdom. Tunku Muhriz obtained a degree in law (LLB) from the University College of Wales at Aberystwyth (later known as the University of Wales, Aberystwyth). He began his career in an international bank in Malaysia and became a director and shareholder of a company licensed as brokers in interbank foreign exchange and in the currency deposits market(1973‚Äì1986). He was the chairman and shareholder of a Malaysian joint venture with a worldwide advertising agency (1981‚Äì1992), chairman and director of a joint venture company involved in the manufacturing of building products(1995‚Äì1998) and a director and shareholder of a company engaged in electrical engineering and construction (1995 to present). He has been on the board of directors of Bangkok Bank since 2006. Tunku Besar Tuanku Muhriz was made Tunku Besar, or heir presumptive in 1960. However, he was bypassed by the Council of Undangs to become Yang di-Pertuan Besar when his father died in 1967 for his uncle, Tuanku Jaafar. Tuanku Jaafar was elected by the Undangs as the 10th Yang di-Pertuan Besar of Negeri Sembilan. The Negeri Sembilan Constitution states that the order of succession should first be the sons of the previous Ruler, followed by the grandsons of the previous Ruler, then by the brothers of the previous Ruler, and only then by the sons of the brothers of the previous Ruler. Tuanku Muhriz was first in the order of succession before the death of Tuanku Munawir, followed by Tunku Jaafar and Tunku Abdullah. When Tuanku Munawir died, Tuanku Muhriz was not chosen. Instead the council chose his half-uncle Tuanku Jaafar ibni Almarhum Tuanku Abdul Rahman, a diplomat. It has been suggested that the then Prime Minister of Malaysia, Tunku Abdul Rahman, influenced the Undangs not to choose Tuanku Muhriz on account of his youth (he was then only nineteen). Yang di-Pertuan Besar On 29 December 2008, The Council of Undang proclaimed him as the 11th Yang di- Pertuan Besar of Negeri Sembilan succeeding Almarhum Tuanku Jaafar ibni Almarhum Tuanku Abdul Rahman who had died on 27 December 2008. It has been learnt that many prominent Malaysians had backed Tuanku Muhriz to succeed as the Ruler of Negeri Sembilan in view of his modest and dignified personality and by his having a successful corporate career. He was also the rightful heir, by tradition, to the throne on the death of his father. Due to a lifelong habit of keeping a low profile, Tuanku Muhriz was largely unknown outside royal circles in Negeri Sembilan. However, Tuanku Muhriz was hardly the underdog in the intense negotiations that was played out for the position of Yang di-Pertuan Besar of Negri Sembilan. During the closed discussions to elect the successor to the late Tuanku Jaafar, at least two, if not all four of the Undangs strongly championed his candidacy. They refused to budge when it was suggested that they consider Tunku Naquiyuddin, Tuanku Jaafar's eldest son, instead as the next Ruler of Negeri Sembilan. Tuanku Muhriz has throughout his life established and maintained strong ties with the Undangs, the general nobility, the lesser royalty and people of Negeri Sembilan, and more so since moving back to the state a few years ago. He also has powerful backers within the political establishment in the state, with the then serving Menteri Besar Tan Mohd Isa Abdul Samad among his supporters. There has been a quiet campaign by his loyal supporters at state and federal level to portray him as a well-spoken and well-educated man; someone who had the great strength of character to put aside the disappointment of not being appointed Ruler of the state in 1967: and who continues to lead a dignified and respectable life. His supporters said that in contrast to members of Tuanku Jaafar's family, Tuanku Muhriz shuns publicity and though he can be very progressive in his outlook, he seems more rooted in traditional ways. Tuanku Jaafar's family are said to be completely devastated with the decision of the Undangs to select Tuanku Muhriz over Tunku Naquiyuddin. They too had several powerful politicians in their camp but the Undangs were not to be swayed. Personal life Tunku Muhriz is married to Terengganu princess Tuanku Aishah Rohani and the royal couple have three sons: Tunku Ali Redhauddin, Tunku Zain Al-'Abidin and Tunku Alif Hussein.

As the first famous pioneer among black filmmakers, he was the first African American to produce and direct major motion pictures‚Äîdeveloping films relating the experience of slaves and struggling black Americans, and creating the \\"blaxploitation\\" genre. He is best remembered for his iconic photos of poor Americans during the 1940s (taken for a federal government project), for his photographic essays for Life magazine, and as the director of the 1971 film Shaft.

He was the youngest of fifteen children. His father was a farmer who grew corn, beets, turnips, potatoes, collard greens, and tomatoes. They also had a few ducks, chickens, and hogs.Parks,1990, p. 6. He attended a segregated elementary school. The town was too small to afford a separate high school that would facilitate segregation of the secondary school, but black people were not allowed to play sports or attend school social activities,Parks, 1990, pp. 1‚Äì2. and they were discouraged from developing any aspirations for higher education. Parks related in a documentary on his life that his teacher told him that his desire to go to college would be a waste of money. When Parks was eleven years old, three white boys threw him into the Marmaton River, knowing he couldn't swim. He had the presence of mind to duck underwater so they wouldn't see him make it to land.Parks, 1990, p. 16. His mother died when he was fourteen. He spent his last night at the family home sleeping beside his mother's coffin, seeking not only solace, but a way to face his own fear of death.Parks, 1990, pp. 12‚Äì13. Soon after, he was sent to St. Paul, Minnesota, to live with a sister and her husband. He and his brother-in-law argued frequently and Parks was finally turned out onto the street to fend for himself at age 15. Struggling to survive, he worked in brothels, and as a singer, piano player, bus boy, traveling waiter, and semi-pro basketball player.D'Ooge, Craig, \\"Photographer Gordon Parks Donates Archives to the Library of Congress\\", press release PR 95-096, 7/5/95, ISSN 0731-3527, Library of Congress, June 30, 1995. Retrieved January 2, 2016. In 1929, he briefly worked in a gentlemen's club, the Minnesota Club. There he not only observed the trappings of success, but was able to read many books from the club library.Parks,1990, pp. 26‚Äì27. When the Wall Street Crash of 1929 brought an end to the club, he jumped a train to Chicago,Parks, 1990, pp. 30‚Äì34. where he managed to land a job in a flophouse.Parks, 1990, p. 35. Career =Photography= At the age of 25, Parks was struck by photographs of migrant workers in a magazine. He bought his first camera, a Voigtl√§nder Brillant, for $7.50 at a Seattle, Washington, pawnshopGordon Park, bio Gale Group. and taught himself how to take photos. The photography clerks who developed Parks's first roll of film applauded his work and prompted him to seek a fashion assignment at a women's clothing store in St. Paul, Minnesota, owned by Frank Murphy. Those photographs caught the eye of Marva Louis, wife of heavyweight boxing champion Joe Louis. She encouraged Parks and his wife, Sally Alvis, to move to Chicago in 1940,Parks, 1990, p. 77. where he began a portrait business and specialized in photographs of society women. Parks's photographic work in Chicago, especially in capturing the myriad experiences of African Americans across the city, led him to receive the Julius Rosenwald Fellowship, in 1941, paying him $200 a month and offering him his choice of employer, which, in turn, contributed to being asked to join the Farm Security Administration, which was chronicling the nation's social conditions, under the auspice of Roy Stryker.Moskowitz, \\"Gordon Parks: A Man for All Seasons,\\" The Journal of Blacks in Higher Education, 2003. Government photography Over the next few years, Parks moved from job to job, developing a freelance portrait and fashion photographer sideline. He began to chronicle the city's South Side black ghetto and, in 1941, an exhibition of those photographs won Parks a photography fellowship with the Farm Security Administration (FSA). American Gothic, Washington, D.C. ‚Äì a well-known photograph by Parks Working at the FSA as a trainee under Roy Stryker, Parks created one of his best-known photographs, American Gothic, Washington, D.C.,Yvonne Shinhoster Lamb, \\"'Life' Photographer And 'Shaft' Director Broke Color Barriers\\", The Washington Post, March 8, 2006. named after the iconic Grant Wood painting, American Gothic‚Äîa legendary painting of a traditional, stoic, white American farm couple‚Äîwhich bore a striking, but ironic, resemblance to Parks' photograph of a black menial laborer. Parks' \\"haunting\\" photograph shows a black woman, Ella Watson, who worked on the cleaning crew of the FSA building, standing stiffly in front of an American flag hanging on the wall, a broom in one hand and a mop in the background. Parks had been inspired to create the image after encountering racism repeatedly in restaurants and shops in the segregated capital city.Natanson, Nicholas, \\"From Sophie's Alley to the White House: Rediscovering the Visions of Pioneering Black Government Photographers,\\" from Prologue Magazine,\\" Special Issue: \\"Federal Records and African American History, Summer 1997, Vol. 29, No. 2, National Archives website. Retrieved January 2, 2016. A later photograph in the FSA series, by Parks, shows Ella Watson and her family Upon viewing the photograph, Stryker said that it was an indictment of America, and that it could get all of his photographers fired. He urged Parks to keep working with Watson, which led to a series of photographs of her daily life. Parks said later that his first image was overdone and not subtle; other commentators have argued that it drew strength from its polemical nature and its duality of victim and survivor, and thus affected far more people than his subsequent pictures of Mrs. Watson. (Parks' overall body of work for the federal government‚Äîusing his camera \\"as a weapon\\"‚Äîwould draw far more attention from contemporaries and historians than that of all other black photographers in federal service at the time. Today, most historians reviewing federally commissioned black photographers of that era focus almost exclusively on Parks.) After the FSA disbanded, Parks remained in Washington, D.C. as a correspondent with the Office of War Information,D'Ooge, Craig, \\"Media Advisory: Photographer Gordon Parks To Donate Personal Collection to the Library of Congress\\", press release PR 95-095, ISSN 0731-3527, Library of Congress, June 30, 1995. Retrieved January 2, 2016. where he photographed the all-black 332d Fighter Group. He was unable to follow the group in the overseas war theatre, so he resigned from the O.W.I. He would later follow Stryker to the Standard Oil Photography Project in New Jersey, which assigned photographers to take pictures of small towns and industrial centers. The most striking work by Parks during that period included, Dinner Time at Mr. Hercules Brown's Home, Somerville, Maine (1944); Grease Plant Worker, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania (1946); Car Loaded with Furniture on Highway (1945); Self Portrait (1945); and Ferry Commuters, Staten Island, N.Y. (1946). Commercial and civic photography Parks renewed his search for photography jobs in the fashion world. Following his resignation from the Office of War Information, Parks moved to Harlem and became a freelance fashion photographer for Vogue under the editorship of Alexander Liberman. Despite racist attitudes of the day, Vogue editor, Liberman, hired him to shoot a collection of evening gowns. Parks photographed fashion for Vogue for the next few years and he developed the distinctive style of photographing his models in motion rather than in static poses. During this time, he published his first two books, Flash Photography (1947) and Camera Portraits: Techniques and Principles of Documentary Portraiture (1948). A 1948 photographic essay on a young Harlem gang leader won Parks a staff job as a photographer and writer with America's leading photo-magazine, Life. His involvement with Life would last until 1972. For over 20 years, Parks produced photographs on subjects including fashion, sports, Broadway, poverty, and racial segregation, as well as portraits of Malcolm X, Stokely Carmichael, Muhammad Ali, and Barbra Streisand. He became \\"one of the most provocative and celebrated photojournalists in the United States.\\" His photographs for Life magazine, namely his 1956 photo essay, titled \\"The Restraints: Open and Hidden,\\"\\"CDS Exhibit Features Gordon Parks‚Äôs Segregation Series, 'The Restraints: Open and Hidden'\\", CDs Porch. illuminated the effects of racial segregation while simultaneously following the everyday lives and activities of three families in and near Mobile, Alabama: the Thorntons, Causeys, and Tanners. As curators at the High Museum of Art Atlanta note, while Parks‚Äô photo essay served as decisive documentation of the Jim Crow South and all of its effects, he did not simply focus on demonstrations, boycotts, and brutality that were associated with that period instead, however, he \\"emphasized the prosaic details\\" of the lives of several families.Stange, Bare witness: Photographs by Gordon Parks, 2006High Museum of Art Atlanta, https://www.high.org/Art/Exhibitions/Gordon-Parks-Segregation- Story.aspx An exhibition of photographs from a 1950 project Parks completed for Life was exhibited in 2015 at the Boston Museum of Fine Arts.Kennedy, Randy, \\"‚ÄòA Long Hungry Look‚Äô: Forgotten Gordon Parks Photos Document Segregation\\", The New York Times, December 24, 2014 (with 11 images in a slide show); also published in print on December 28, 2014, p. AR1, the New York edition, with the headline \\"A Long Hungry Look\\". Parks returned to his hometown, Fort Scott, Kansas, where segregation persisted, and he documented conditions in the community and the contemporary lives of many of his eleven classmates from the segregated middle school they attended. The project included his commentary, but the work was never published by Life. During his years with Life, Parks also wrote a few books on the subject of photography (particularly documentary photography), and in 1960 was named Photographer of the Year by the American Society of Magazine Photographers. =Film= In the 1950s, Parks worked as a consultant on various Hollywood productions. He later directed a series of documentaries on black ghetto life that were commissioned by National Educational Television. With his film adaptation of his semi- autobiographical novel, The Learning Tree in 1969 for Warner Bros.-Seven Arts, Parks became Hollywood's first major black director. It was filmed in his home town of Fort Scott, Kansas.Parks, 1990, p. 278. Parks also wrote the screenplay and composed the musical score for the film, with assistance from his friend, the composer Henry Brant. Shaft, a 1971 detective film directed by Parks and starring Richard Roundtree as John Shaft, became a major hit that spawned a series of films that would be labeled as blaxploitation. The blaxploitation genre was one in which images of lower-class blacks being involved with drugs, violence and women, were exploited for commercially successful films featuring black actors, and was popular with a section of the black community. Parks' feel for settings was confirmed by Shaft, with its portrayal of the super-cool leather-clad, black private detective hired to find the kidnapped daughter of a Harlem racketeer. Parks also directed the 1972 sequel, Shaft's Big Score, in which the protagonist finds himself caught in the middle of rival gangs of racketeers. Parks's other directorial credits include The Super Cops (1974) and Leadbelly (1976), a biographical film of the blues musician Huddie Ledbetter. In the 1980s, he made several films for television and composed the music and a libretto for Martin, a ballet tribute to Martin Luther King Jr., which premiered in Washington, D.C. during 1989. It was screened on national television on King's birthday in 1990. In 2000, as an homage, he had a cameo appearance in the Shaft sequel that starred Samuel L. Jackson in the title role as the namesake and nephew of the original John Shaft. In the cameo scene, Parks was sitting playing chess when Jackson greeted him as, \\"Mr. P.\\" =Musician and composer= His first job was as a piano player in a brothel when he was a teenager.Parks, 1990, pp. 19‚Äì20. Parks also performed as a jazz pianist. His song \\"No Love\\", composed in another brothel, was performed during a national radio broadcast by Larry Funk and his orchestra in the early 1930s.Parks, 1990, p. 45. Parks composed Concerto for Piano and Orchestra (1953) at the encouragement of black American conductor, Dean Dixon, and his wife Vivian, a pianist,Parks, 1990, p. 150. and with the help of the composer Henry Brant.Parks, 1990, p. 153. He completed Tree Symphony in 1967. In 1989, he composed and directed Martin, a ballet dedicated to Martin Luther King Jr., the civil rights leader who had been assassinated. =Writing= Starting in the late-1940s, Parks began writing‚Äîa second career that would produce 15 books and lead to his role as a prominent black filmmaker‚Äîstarting with books on the art and craft of photography. Beginning in the 1960s, Parks branched out into literature, writing The Learning Tree (1963). He authored several books of poetry, which he illustrated with his own photographs, and he wrote three volumes of memoirs--A Choice of Weapons (1966), Voices in the Mirror (1990), and A Hungry Heart (2005). In 1981, Parks turned to fiction with Shannon, a novel about Irish immigrants fighting their way up the social ladder in turbulent early 20th-century New York. Parks' writing accomplishments include novels, poetry, autobiography, and non-fiction that includes photographic instructional manuals and film-making books. During this period, Parks also wrote the poem \\"The Funeral\\". =Painting= Parks' photography-related abstract oil paintings were showcased in a 1981 exhibition at Alex Rosenberg Gallery in New York titled \\"Gordon Parks: Expansions: The Aesthetic Blend of Painting and Photography.\\" =Essence magazine= Parks was a co-founder of Essence magazine and served as its editorial director during the first three years of its circulation. Personal life Parks in 2000 Parks was married and divorced three times. He married Sally Alvis in Minneapolis during 1933Parks, 1990, p. 61. and they divorced in 1961. In 1962, he married Elizabeth Campbell, daughter of cartoonist E. Simms Campbell, and they divorced in 1973.Sheena C. Howard, Encyclopedia of Black Comics, Golden: Fulcrum Publishing, 2017, p. 47. Parks first met Chinese-American editor Genevieve Young (stepdaughter of Chinese diplomat Wellington Koo) in 1962 when he began writing The Learning Tree.Parks, 1990, p. 207. At that time, his publisher assigned her to be his editor. They became romantically involved at a time when they both were divorcing previous spouses, and married in 1973. They divorced in 1979. Candace Bushnell claims to have dated Parks in 1976, when she was 18 and he was 58. For many years, Parks was romantically involved with Gloria Vanderbilt, the railroad heiress and designer. Their relationship evolved into a deep friendship that endured throughout his lifetime. Parks had four children: Gordon, Jr., David, Leslie, and Toni (Parks-Parsons). His oldest son Gordon Parks, Jr., whose talents resembled his father's, was killed in a plane crash in 1979 in Kenya, where he had gone to direct a film.\\"Filmmaker Gordon Parks; victim of airplane crash\\", The Day, April 3, 1979.Parks, 1990, p. 335. Parks has five grandchildren: Alain, Gordon III, Sarah, Campbell, and Satchel. Malcolm X honored Parks when he asked him to be the godfather of his daughter, Qubilah Shabazz. He died of cancer at the age of 93 while living in Manhattan, New York City, and is buried in his hometown of Fort Scott, Kansas.  Legacy  = In film = With his film Shaft (along with Melvin Van Peebles's Sweet Sweetback's Baadasssss Song, released earlier the same year), Parks is credited with co-creating the genre of blaxploitation, an ethnic subgenre of the exploitation film that emerged in the United States during the early 1970s. The action film also helped to alter Hollywood's view of African Americans, introducing the black action hero into mainstream cinema. Director Spike Lee cites Parks as an inspiration, stating \\"You get inspiration where it comes from. It doesn't have to be because I'm looking at his films. The odds that he got these films made under, when there were no black directors, is enough.\\" = In music = Parks is referenced in Kendrick Lamar's music video, for his song, \\"ELEMENT.\\".

The word \\"Elgygytgyn\\" means \\"white lake\\" in the Chukchi language. The lake is of particular interest to scientists because it has never been covered by glaciers. This has allowed the uninterrupted build-up of of sediment at the bottom of the lake, recording information on prehistoric climate change. Geography Landsat 7 satellite image of the lake Lake El'gygytgyn is located in the Anadyr Plateau, part of the Anadyr Highlands. It is drained to the southeast by the Enmyvaam, a tributary of the Belaya. It is approximately in diameter and has a maximum depth of . The lake is centered within an impact crater with a rim diameter of that formed 3.6 million years ago during the Pliocene. Before it was reliably dated, preliminary papers in the late 1970s suggested either ElgygytgynR.S.

Glass (1979), Zhamanshin crater, a possible source of Australasian tektites? Geology, July 1979, v. 7, p. 351-353 as the source of the young Australasian strewnfield.  Scientific drilling  In late 2008 and early 2009, an international team from the USA (Dr. Julie Brigham-Grette), Germany (Dr. Martin Melles), Russia (Dr. Pavel Sergeevich Minuyk) and Austria (Dr. Christian Koeberl) conducted a drilling program targeting three holes in El'gygytgyn Lake. The resulting cores are designated ICPD Site 5011-1 and 5011-3. This co-sponsored by the International Continental Scientific Drilling Program (ICDP), with funding also provided by the U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF), the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF), Alfred Wegener Institute (AWI) and GeoForschungsZentrum Potsdam (GFZ), the Russian Academy of Sciences Far East Branch (RAS FEB), the Russian Foundation for Basic Research (RFBR), and the Austrian Federal Ministry of Science and Research (BMWF). Fauna The conditions in the El'gygytgyn lake are extremely severe for fish life. Even so, there are three species permanently inhabiting the lake's harsh aquatic environment. Fly Fishing Russia ‚Äì The Elgygytgyn Lake, Chukotka These are three types of char: Salvelinus boganidae, S. elgyticus (Small-mouth char) and Salvethymus svetovidovi (long-finned char).Salvethymus svetovidovi The two latter species are endemic to the El'gygytgyn lake. The golets (Salvelinus alpinus, ) has been introduced recently. Fish species in the lake are adapted to its very cold waters, which are generally just above the freezing point, and spend most of the year in total darkness. The surface is frozen for about 10 months of the year. It may start to melt in the summer, but some years it never fully thaws.Arctic char (Salvelinus alpinus) in the lake See also *List of lakes of Russia References External links * Dr. Matt Nolan at the University of Alaska Fairbanks * Polar Expedition to Siberian Lake will Yield Details of Past Climate PhysOrg.com. * NASA Earth Observatory * Haltia E.

She flew on five Space Shuttle missions between 1985 and 1998, including two dockings with the Mir space station. Since leaving NASA, she has worked in museums and STEM leadership as well as a professor of aerospace engineering. Early life Dunbar was born in Sunnyside, Washington. She graduated from Sunnyside High School in 1967. She attended the University of Washington and received her undergraduate degree in ceramic engineering in 1971. After college, she worked for Boeing Computer Services for two years as a systems analyst. From 1973 to 1975, Dunbar conducted research for her master's thesis at the University of Washington in the field of mechanisms and kinetics of ionic diffusion in sodium beta-alumina. She is a member of Kappa Delta sorority. In 1975, Dunbar was invited to participate in research at the Atomic Energy Research Establishment in Oxfordshire, as a visiting scientist. Her work there involved the wetting behavior of liquids on solid substrates. Following her work in England, she accepted a senior research engineer position with Rockwell International Space Division in Downey, California. Her responsibilities there included developing equipment and processes for the manufacture of the Space Shuttle thermal protection system in Palmdale. She represented Rockwell International as a member of the Dr. Kraft Ehricke evaluation committee on prospective space industrialization concepts. Dunbar completed her doctorate at the University of Houston in 1983. Her multi- disciplinary dissertation (materials science and physiology) involved evaluating the effects of simulated space flight on bone strength and fracture toughness. These results were correlated to alterations in hormonal and metabolic activity. Dunbar is a private pilot with over 200 hours in single engine land aircraft. She has logged more than 700 hours flying time in T-38 jets as a back-seater, and has over 100 hours as co-pilot in a Cessna Citation jet. Dunbar was formerly married to fellow astronaut Ronald M. Sega. NASA career Dunbar became a payload officer/flight controller at the Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center in 1978. She served as a guidance and navigation officer/flight controller for the Skylab reentry mission in 1979 and was subsequently designated project officer/payload officer for the integration of several Space Shuttle payloads. Dunbar became a NASA astronaut in August 1981. Her technical assignments included assisting in the verification of Shuttle flight software at the Shuttle Avionics Integration Laboratory (SAIL), serving as a member of the Flight Crew Equipment Control Board, participation as a member of the Astronaut Office Science Support Group, and supporting operational development of the remote manipulator system (RMS). She served as chief of the Mission Development Branch, as the Astronaut Office interface for \\"secondary\\" payloads, and as lead for the Science Support Group. In 1993, Dunbar served as Deputy Associate Administrator, Office of Life and Microgravity Sciences at NASA Headquarters in Washington, D.C. In February 1994, she traveled to Star City, Russia, where she spent 13 months training as a back-up crew member for a three-month flight on Mir. In March 1995, she was certified by the Russian Gagarin Cosmonaut Training Center as qualified to fly on long duration Mir flights. From October 1995 to November 1996, she was detailed to the NASA JSC Mission Operations Directorate as Assistant Director where she was responsible for chairing the International Space Station Training Readiness Reviews, and facilitating Russian/American operations and training strategies. Spaceflight experience A veteran of five space flights, Dunbar has logged more than 1,208 hours (50 days) in space. She served as a mission specialist on STS-61-A in 1985, STS-32 in 1990, and STS-71 in 1995, and was the Payload Commander on STS-50 in 1992, and STS-89 in 1998. STS-61-A Challenger (October 30-November 6, 1985), was the West German D-1 Spacelab mission. It was the first to carry eight crew members, the largest to fly in space, and was also the first in which payload activities were controlled from outside the United States. More than 75 scientific experiments were completed in the areas of physiological sciences, materials science, biology, and navigation. During the flight, Dunbar was responsible for operating Spacelab and its subsystems and performing a variety of experiments. Her mission training included six months of experiment training in Germany, France, Switzerland, and The Netherlands. STS-61-A launched from the Kennedy Space Center, Florida, and returned to land at Edwards Air Force Base, California. Mission duration was 7 days, 44 minutes 51 seconds, traveling 2.5 million miles in 111 orbits of the Earth. STS-32 Columbia (January 9‚Äì20, 1990), launched from the Kennedy Space Center, Florida, and returned to a night landing at Edwards Air Base in California. During the flight, the crew successfully deployed the Syncom IV-F5 satellite, and retrieved the 21,400-pound Long Duration Exposure Facility (LDEF) using the RMS. They also operated a variety of middeck experiments including the Microgravity Disturbance Experiment (MDE) using the Fluids Experiment Apparatus (FEA), Protein Crystal Growth (PCG), American Flight Echocardiograph (AFE), Latitude/Longitude Locator (L3), Mesoscale Lightning Experiment (MLE), Characterization of Neurospora Circadian Rhythms (CNCR), and the IMAX Camera. Dunbar was principal investigator for the MDE/FEA Experiment. Additionally, numerous medical test objectives, including in-flight lower body negative pressure (LBNP), in-flight aerobic exercise and muscle performance were conducted to evaluate human adaptation to extended duration missions. Mission duration was 10 days, 21 hours, 01 minute, 38 seconds, traveling 4.5 million miles in 173 orbits of the Earth. STS-50 Columbia (June 25 to July 9, 1992). Dunbar was the Payload Commander on STS-50, the United States Microgravity Lab-1 mission which was dedicated to microgravity fluid physics and materials science. Over 30 experiments sponsored by over 100 investigators were housed in the Spacelab in the Shuttle's Payload Bay. A payload crew of four operated around-the-clock for 13 days performing experiments in scientific disciplines such as protein crystal growth, electronic and infrared detector crystal growth, surface tension physics, zeolite crystal growth, and human physiology. Mission duration was 13 days, 19 hours, 30 minutes and 4 seconds, traveling 5.7 million miles in 221 orbits of the Earth. STS-71 Atlantis (June 27 to July 7, 1995), was the first Space Shuttle mission to dock with the Russian Space Station Mir, and involved an exchange of crews. The Atlantis was modified to carry a docking system compatible with the Russian Mir Space Station. Dunbar served as MS-3 on this flight which also carried a Spacelab module in the payload bay in which the crew performed medical evaluations on the returning Mir crew. These evaluations included ascertaining the effects of weightlessness on the cardio/vascular system, the bone/muscle system, the immune system, and the cardio/pulmonary system. Mission duration was 9 days, 19 hours, 23 minutes and 8 seconds, traveling 4.1 million miles in 153 orbits of the earth. STS-89 Endeavour (January 22‚Äì31, 1998), was the eighth Shuttle- Mir docking mission during which the crew transferred more than 9,000 pounds of scientific equipment, logistical hardware and water from Space Shuttle Endeavour to Mir. In the fifth and last exchange of a U.S. astronaut, STS-89 delivered Andy Thomas to Mir and returned with David Wolf. Mission duration was 8 days, 19 hours and 47 seconds, traveling 3.6 million miles in 138 orbits of the Earth. Dunbar was the Payload Commander, responsible for all payload activities including the conduct of 23 technology and science experiments. Post-NASA career Dunbar retired from NASA in September 2005. She served as president and CEO of The Museum of Flight in Seattle until April 2010. From 2013 to 2015, Dunbar led the University of Houston's STEM Center and was a faculty member in the Cullen College of Engineering.

Dunbar"},{"id":"598405","text":"Potchefstroom (, colloquially Potch) is an academic city in the North West Province of South Africa. It hosts the Potchefstroom Campus of the North-West University. Potchefstroom is on the Mooi Rivier (Afrikaans for \\"pretty river\\"), roughly west-southwest of Johannesburg and east-northeast of Klerksdorp. Potchefstroom, together with Rustenburg, is the second-largest city in the North West Province. The largest city, Klerksdorp, is about away. Etymology Several theories exist about the origin of the city's name. According to one theory, it originates from Potgieter + Chef + stroom (referring to Voortrekker leader and town founder Andries Potgieter; \\"chef\\" indicates the leader of the Voortrekkers, and \\"stroom\\" refers to the Mooi River). Geoffrey Jenkins writes, \\"Others however, attribute the name as having come from the word 'Potscherf', meaning a shard of a broken pot, due to the cracks that appear in the soil of the Mooi River Valley during drought resembling a broken pot\\".Jenkins, 1971:8 M. L. Fick suggests that Potchefstroom developed from the abbreviation of \\"Potgieterstroom\\" to \\"Potgerstroom\\", which became \\"Potchefstroom\\". However, this does not account for the appearance of \\"Potjestroom\\" on many documents and photographs. The African National Congress decided to change the name of the municipality and some street names in 2006, favouring \\"Tlokwe\\" as the new name. In 2007, its name was changed from Potchefstroom Municipality to Tlokwe Municipality. However, the city continued to use the name Potchefstroom. The Tlowke Municipality merged with the Ventersdorp Municipality in 2016, forming the larger JB Marks Local Municipality. History Potchefstroom, founded in 1838 by the Voortrekkers, is the second-oldest European settlement in the Transvaal. The oldest European settlement is Klerksdorp, about west. Some historians challenge this, because the first settlement was in the \\"upper regions of the Schoon Spruit\\" (believed to have been between Klerksdorp and Potchefstroom). However, Potchefstroom was the first to develop into a town. Until 1840, the towns of Potchefstroom and Winburg and their surrounding territories were a Boer Republic known as the Republic of Winburg- Potchefstroom. Voortrekker leader Andries Hendrik Potgieter was elected as chief commandant. In October 1840, after a meeting between Potgieter, Andries Pretorius and G. R. van Rooyen, it was decided that Potchefstroom would unite with \\"Pieter Mouriets Burg\\" (Pietermaritzburg). On 16‚Äì17 January 1852, the Sand River Convention was signed between Andries Pretorius (representing the Boers) and Major W. S. Hogge and C. M. Owen (representing Britain). According to the convention, the British government would allow the immigrant farmers north of the Vaal River to govern themselves with no interference from either side. This signalled the establishment of the Zuid-Afrikaanse Republiek (ZAR) (South African Republic). In Article 17 of the Constitution of the ZAR dated 18 February 1858 (which was accepted in Rustenburg), it was stated that \\"Potchefstroom, located on the Mooi River, would be the capital of the Republic and that Pretoria would be the seat of government\\". In May 1860, Potchefstroom became the \\"chief city\\" of the republic and the capital moved to Pretoria. On 16 December 1880, the First Boer War began when the Boers laid siege to the old fort. The siege ended amicably on 23 March 1881. The British built concentration camps during the Second Boer War for Boer women, children, and elderly men, where more than 27,000 died of starvation and disease. At the opening of the city hall in 1909, colonial secretary Jan Smuts was asked about the possibility of Potchefstroom becoming capital of the Union. He replied that the city stood no chance, but should aim to be South Africa's largest educational centre.Jenkins, 1971:104 This has led to Potchefstroom's being the \\"city of expertise\\", with numerous tertiary educational institutions. It has hosted the annual late-September Aardklop Arts Festival, a predominantly- Afrikaans arts festival, since 1997. Population The Potchefstroom Municipality, which encompasses several neighbouring settlements, had a population of 128,357 in the 2007 community survey. Of these, 69.6 percent were black, 27.0 percent were white, three percent were coloureds and 0.4 percent were Asian. However, the city itself and surrounding suburbs have a population of 43,448, of which 69.9 percent are white, 25.4 percent are black, 2.8 percent were coloured and 1.3 percent were Asian. Ken McArthur of Potchefstroom won a gold medal at the 1912 Stockholm Olympics in the marathon. McArthur was known in his home village of North Antrim for his training routine, which consisted of racing a narrow-gauge train. Education Potchefstroom is home to five tertiary institutions, 30 other schools and a number of research bureaus and training centres, including: *The North-West University, a merged tertiary institution which was created on 1 January 2004, with campuses in Potchefstroom, Mafikeng and Vanderbijlpark. The Potchefstroom Campus (formerly the Potchefstroomse Universiteit vir Christelike Ho√´r Onderwys, founded in 1869) is the largest, and the university's head office is located there. The North-West University became one of South Africa's larger universities after the merger, with about 32,000 full-time and distance- education students. * Pearson Institute of Higher Education, was founded in 1989 as a private, university-level, degree-conferring institution in South Africa. They have 12 campuses across South Africa. They focus on making their students employable and real-world ready. Each course is designed to equip students with the tools they need to excel in the world of work. Take the next step and enrol in one of the more than 40 registered tertiary programmes. *The Potchefstroom College of Education (originally the Normal College), which was founded in 1919. The college was originally housed in galvanised-iron buildings on the same premises as the Potchefstroom High School for Boys, and moved to its present location in 1923. The College of Education was incorporated by the university on 1 January 2001. *The Technical College Potchefstroom, founded in 1939 when the Union Education Department began \\"continuation classes\\". *The Agricultural Centre, previously known as the Experimental Farm (1902) and Agricultural College (1939), is the largest agricultural facility in one location in southern Africa. The centre houses the headquarters of the Highveld Region of the Department of Agriculture, the Grain Crops Institute, and the Agricultural College. The Potchefstroom Koekoek chicken was developed there. * CTU Training Solutions Potchefstroom Campus is a FET college in Potchefstroom since 2006, specializing in IT, Business and Design training - full time, part-time or any corporate training. *Potchefstroom Akademie, founded in 1981 by Tina Sch√∂ltz, offers tertiary education in somatology, health and skincare therapy, holistic health therapies and interior design and decorating. *Potchefstroom High School for Girls: Originally known as the Central School, it was established in 1874. Girls High was founded in 1905, when the Central School was divided into separate high schools for boys and girls. *Potchefstroom High School for Boys, established in 1874, has been at its current site since 1905. *Potchefstroom Gimnasium, founded in January 1907 as Die Voorbereidende Skool, was a preparatory school for theological studies and part of the Potchefstroom University before moving to its current location. On 25 January 1915, it changed its name to Goeverement Skool. A year later it was the first school to use Afrikaans in addition to Dutch and English, and first Afrikaans high school north of the Vaal River. In 1918, it became a high school and changed its name to Potchefstroom Gimnasium. *Potchefstroom Central Primary School, the city's only English-speaking primary school *Ho√´r Volkskool Potchefstroom, founded in 1927 *The Hair Academy of South Africa (THASA), founded in 2008, is registered with the Department of Higher Education and Training and provides national and international hairdressing qualifications. Public primary and high schools in Potchefstroom's townships include Boitirelo Primary School, Lesego Primary School, Boitshoko High School and Tlokwe High School. Sports facilities Potchefstroom, known as the North West Province's \\"Home of Sport\\", is the provincial headquarters of 17 major sports. The city council emphasises the establishment, maintenance and upgrading of its sports facilities, particularly to meet the sporting and recreational needs of its younth. The Mooi River and other trails add colour and variety to facilities available to residents and tourists. Potchefstroom has hosted two World Cup- winning teams (in cricket and football), and is a home away from home for international athletes and teams. At altitude, it provides a good balance between altitude and quality training. The city has no large factories, and good air quality. Athletes and professional teams train at the North-West University's High Performance Institute of Sport. Cricket is popular, with Senwes Park the home ground of the Highveld Lions. During the 2003 Cricket World Cup, Potchefstroom hosted matches between Australia and the Netherlands, Australia and Namibia, and South Africa and Kenya. Potchefstroom co-hosted the 2009 Cricket World Cup Qualifier. The South Africa national cricket team has regularly chosen Potchefstroom for off-season training and has hosted the Australian team's off-season cricket camps. During the 2003 Cricket World Cup, Australia's cricket team chose Potchefstroom as their home base and won the tournament. Rugby is arguably Potchefstroom's most popular sport. Ol√´n Park, the main rugby stadium, is primarily used for rugby union matches by the Leopards in the Vodacom Cup and the first division of the Currie Cup. The stadium is also used for football matches, and has hosted the South Africa under-23 team. Jomo Cosmos, a Premier Soccer League, team relegated to the National First Division, also uses the stadium for some matches. Profert Ol√´n Park was named after Carl Ludwig Theodor Ol√´n, president of the Western Transvaal Rugby Union between 1922 and 1934. Profert, a local fertiliser company, maintains the playing field. The Absa Puk Oval is on the North-West University campus. The university sport grounds is known as the Fanie du Toit Sports Complex. The main rugby field has hosted several Leopards games and the Potchefstroom Campus' Varsity Cup matches. PUC McArthur Stadium, the athletics stadium, was renovated for the fourth time in 2014. Built in 1892, it was named in honour of 1912 Olympic marathon gold medalist Ken McArthur. Noted local athletes include Godfrey Khotso Mokoena, the silver medalist in the long jump at the 2008 Beijing Summer Olympic Games, Hezeki√©l Sepeng, Jorrie Muller, Justine Robbeson and Ryan Diedericks. The visit of the Spain national football team during the 2010 FIFA World Cup brought a new level of sport to Potchefstroom and the NWU. Spain, who won their inaugural FIFA World Cup title, chose Potchefstroom as their base camp. A new sports complex was built at the North-West University for the team, and the local airport was expanded to accommodate large passenger planes. Politics Mayor Maphetle Maphetle of the African National Congress was dismissed in late 2012 after a motion of no confidence passed, and Annette Combrink of the opposition Democratic Alliance was elected mayor. Three months later a motion of no confidence removed Combrink, and Maphetle was reinstated. Since then, municipal-council and mayoral elections have been keenly contested.

Although 18 episodes were planned, only 13 were produced. The series was put on hiatus by the WB Network after two episodes due to poor ratings. It returned to the WB in the summer of 2000 but was canceled after four additional episodes. The series went on to develop a cult following, thanks to repeated airings of all 13 episodes on Teletoon's Teletoon Unleashed block; Cartoon Network's popular late-night programming block Adult Swim; and Too Funny To Sleep, a late-night programming block on TBS. Mission Hill was formerly known as The Downtowners, although MTV's production of the similarly titled Downtown forced a name change. It has also been popular outside of the United States and Canada, receiving broadcasts in Australia, Eastern Europe, Latin America, Spain and New Zealand. Stylistically, the series is recognizable for its bright, neon color palette, and features a peculiar mixture of modern animation and traditional \\"cartoonish\\" drawings (dashed lines coming from eyes to indicate line of vision, red bolts of lightning around a spot in pain). The style was made to be reminiscent of Warner Bros. cartoons from the 1930s to 1950s, as well as 1960's Hanna-Barbera cartoons. The designs were done by Lauren MacMullan, who cites the comic series Eightball as her source of inspiration for her overall design. The series was created in 1997https://www.polygon.com/2017/9/6/16256458/mission-hill-simpsons-bill- oakley-josh-weinstein-matt-groening by Bill Oakley and Josh Weinstein, former executive producers of The Simpsons, and the artistic designer was Lauren MacMullan. It features the voices of Wallace Langham, Scott Menville, Brian Posehn, Vicki Lewis, Nick Jameson, Tom Kenny, Herbert Sig√ºenza, Jane Wiedlin, Tress MacNeille and Lisa Kushell. The theme song is a faster, instrumental version of \\"Italian Leather Sofa\\" by Cake. Warner Home Video released all 13 completed episodes on DVD, on November 29, 2005. On June 30, 2020, Bill Oakley announced plans for a spinoff tentatively titled Gus and Wally, which will be set six months after the series' conclusion and will focus on the elderly gay couple who were supporting characters in Mission Hill. Premise Set in the world of teens and 20-somethings, this series follows hip 24-year-old Andy French, whose sheltered suburban teenage brother Kevin moves in with him and his roommates in a big-city loft. Characters =Main= * Andrew \\"Andy\\" French (Wallace Langham) ‚Äì A 24-year-old in his third consecutive \\"post- college slump year.\\" Andy is an aspiring cartoonist. From the pilot episode to \\"Unemployment, Part 1,\\" Andy worked at a waterbed store where his boss was a lecherous, short, ill-tempered, foul-mouthed man who frequented strip clubs. From \\"Unemployment, Part 2\\" to \\"Plan 9 from Mission Hill\\" (and including the unproduced episodes \\"Supertool\\" and \\"Pretty in Pink\\"), Andy works as an artist at the same advertising agency as Jim. Often bored and mellow, Andy is easily annoyed by his younger brother, Kevin, though it has been shown that Andy does indeed care about him. However, he often has a habit of calling him and others \\"douchebag\\". * Kevin French (Scott Menville) ‚Äì Andy's 17-year-old nerd brother. Kevin moved in with Andy when his parents left for Wyoming, bringing his sheltered, suburban mindset to Mission Hill. He hopes to attend Yale University, and prides himself on his SAT scores. He has a habit of \\"bling- blonging,\\" saying \\"bling blong\\" over and over again while doing homework to drown out any/all distractions and is prone to heavily overreact to trivial matters. * James \\"Jim\\" Kuback (Brian Posehn) ‚Äì In his mid-20s, loftmate Jim has been Andy's best friend since high school. He is extremely tall and lanky, with red hair and a beard much like his voice actor, and speaks in a deep, monotone voice. Jim is a genius at all things electronic, whether it's electronic music or computers. He is mellow and able to express a wide variety of sentiments by nuancing the word \\"Okay.\\" Jim is a high-powered advertising agent who is paid vast amounts of money to alter marketing campaigns to appeal to Generation Y. * Posey Tyler (Vicki Lewis) ‚Äì In her mid 20s, Posey, the fourth hippie loftmate, is somewhat a flower child, and very concerned about the health and well-being of her plants. She often gives her vegetables to charity, but gets upset when they are damaged. She often speaks quickly and in a nervous tone. * Stogie ‚Äì Andy's pet Golden Retriever, who can apparently stomach anything from alcohol drinks to remote controls. At one point in the series his primary source of food was eating the couch cushions. Posey has stated that \\"there are dark forces at work within him\\", in the first episode. =Supporting= * Gus Duncz (Nick Jameson) ‚Äì A gay man in his late 60s, he owns a diner in Mission Hill. He is a very large, burly man with a short temper and is married to Wally. According to audio commentary by the producers, Gus is based on Broderick Crawford, though according to the audio commentary for The Simpsons seventh season episode, \\"Marge Be Not Proud,\\" Bill Oakley and Josh Weinstein claim the inspiration for the character was Lawrence Tierney (who voiced the Try-N-Save store detective who catches Bart shoplifting). * Wally Langford (Tom Kenny) ‚Äì A gay man in his late 60s, Wally is a projectionist at the local art movie house. He is based on David Niven. He enjoys cinema and ragtime music. In the episode \\"I Married a Gay Man from Outer Space\\", it is revealed that he directed a film in the 1950s entitled The Man from Pluto (which parodied Plan 9 from Outer Space). It starred his partner Gus in the title role. * Natalie Leibowitz-Hernandez (Vicki Lewis) ‚Äì Late 20s. Politically correct and intellectually well-endowed, Natalie is a professor of Women's Studies at the local college. Sensitive to biases in our culture, Natalie and her husband have yet to name their baby as they want it to have cultural significance reflective of their own respective cultures. She is of Jewish religion. She is a working mother who supports both \\"Baby Nameless\\" and her non-working \\"marital partner\\" Carlos. The character of Natalie was based and modeled on the writer and educator Lois M. Leveen, a longtime friend of the show's creators. She auditioned for the voice of her own character, but the actress Vicki Lewis was determined to be even more \\"Lois-y\\" than Lois Leveen herself, and she was cast in the role instead.https://twitter.com/thatbilloakley/status/2150587298750464 https://twitter.com/thatbilloakley/status/2150853913870336 * Carlos Hernandez (Herbert Sig√ºenza) ‚Äì Late 20s. He is a struggling Latino artist and stay-at- home dad for Baby Nameless. Unlike his wife Natalie, Carlos is a Christian, his work is, at times, reminiscent of Jackson Pollock, Diego Rivera and Bob Ross. He prides himself on having no discernible style. Carlos and Natalie have a pet snake as a result of an episode involving a raid on an animal testing lab. * Gwen (Jane Wiedlin) ‚Äì Early 20s. Andy's on-and-off girlfriend, Gwen completed two years of community college before settling in Mission Hill. She met Andy working at Ron's Waterbed World. Someday she'd like to be an accomplished person who achieves her goals and makes a serious contribution to society. She likes The Go-Go's. * Toby Mundorf (Josh Weinstein) ‚Äì In his late teens and one of Kevin's best friends in Mission Hill. His overprotective mother worries a great deal about him, as he frequently suffers from allergies, asthma, and hunger. Despite his large size, he is a born coward. * George Bang (Bill Oakley) ‚Äì Kevin's other best friend. George works long hours after school in his father's market. George is extremely competitive in everything from taking tests to playing video games. He shares all the same interests as his best friends and is particularly proud of owning the complete Babylon 5 Collectible Card Game. Unlike his friends Toby and Kevin, his parents don't seem to be overprotective, so he is more sarcastic and aggressive than either of them. George has an older sister named Tina who goes to Polytech. George is of Korean descent. * Ron (Nick Jameson) ‚Äì A sleazy, immoral Armenian (though the commentary described Ron as being from a country that used to be a part of the Soviet Union, which does include Armenia, but could also be any number of countries from Eastern Europe and Central Asia) man and former boss of Andy (who loathes him). On \\"Unemployment, Part 1,\\" Ron was arrested for tax evasion and his store was confiscated by the government. He has an extremely short temper and often takes his rage out on his employees. Production Episodes Thirteen episodes of the series were produced while five more were written, but never completed. Animatics for some of these episodes were in production at the time of the series' cancellation. It was planned to put these animatics on the DVD for the series, but this never came to fruition. However, several of the animatics‚Äîincluding a completed video animatic and synchronized audio read-through of the episode \\"Pretty in Pink (Crap Gets in Your Eyes)\\"‚Äîhave been released through various internet outlets. =Season 1 (1999‚Äì2002)= =Unfinished episodes= Location The series takes place in a district called Mission Hill. Mission Hill is a diverse neighborhood in a much larger city called Cosmopolis. Cosmopolis is depicted as a large modern urban metropolis similar to New York City or Chicago. The official website states Mission Hill is a mix of Mission Hill in Boston (only miles away from where creator Bill Oakley went to college), Mission District in San Francisco, Silver Lake in Los Angeles, Wicker Park in Chicago, and Williamsburg in Brooklyn. The exact location of Cosmopolis has never been revealed, as it is a mix of East and West Coast cities. Most of the series takes place in the neighborhood of Mission Hill, although the skyscrapers of Downtown Cosmopolis are seen in the background. In the DVD commentaries, Josh Weinstein says that a large portion of the development of the series was spent developing Mission Hill into a functional, albeit fictional, city. Writers and animators worked together to create fictional advertisements, bands, foods, and even bus schedules. Boston, MA has a neighborhood called Mission Hill in the Roxbury section of the city which bears many similarities to its fictional counterpart. Home release DVD cover Warner Home Video released all 13 completed episodes on DVD on November 29, 2005. The collection replaced some of the original soundtracks with stock music, most glaringly \\"Everybody Hurts\\" by R.E.M. in the episode \\"Andy Vs. The Real World\\". The DVD collection also dubbed over some of the original voice tracks to remove any references to the replaced music, for example changing Andy's voice track from saying \\"Gordon Lightfoot\\" to \\"Scott Joplin\\" in the episode \\"Unemployment Part 1\\". Awards Mission Hill received the 2000 Pulcinella Award for \\"Best Series for All Audiences\\"; the award cited the series' \\"stylized design and honest approach to sexual and moral issues.\\" The series won an award from GLAAD for its positive portrayal of a gay relationship.

He occupied the command module pilot seat during the flight of Apollo 7 in 1968. After retiring from both NASA and the Air Force, he became the Peace Corps country director for Thailand, before moving into private business. Biography =Early life and education= Eisele was born June 23, 1930, in Columbus, Ohio, and graduated from West High School in 1948. He was an –ïagle Scout. He received a Bachelor of Science degree from the United States Naval Academy in 1952, and chose a commission in the United States Air Force. He received a Master of Science degree in Astronautics from the U.S. Air Force Institute of Technology, Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio, in 1960. =Flight experience= Eisele attended and graduated from the Aerospace Research Pilot School (Class 62A) at Edwards Air Force Base, California in 1962; his classmates included Charles Bassett and Theodore Freeman. Eisele was a project engineer and experimental test pilot at the Air Force Special Weapons Center at Kirtland Air Force Base, New Mexico. He flew experimental test flights in support of special weapons development programs. He logged more than 4,200 hours flying time, 3,600 of which were in jet aircraft. =NASA career= Eisele prior to launching of Apollo 7. The Apollo 7 crew: Eisele (l.), Wally Schirra (c.), and Walter Cunningham (r.). Barbara Eden, Bob Hope, the Apollo 7 astronauts, and Paul Haney (voice of Mission Control) on The Bob Hope Show (November 6, 1968). Eisele was part of NASA's third group of astronauts, selected in October 1963. In early 1966, Eisele was quietly selected as Pilot for the Apollo 1 crew, along with Command Pilot Virgil I. \\"Gus\\" Grissom and Senior Pilot Ed White. But after dislocating his shoulder twice during training in January 1966, Eisele was replaced by Roger B. Chaffee. After corrective surgery on January 27, Eisele was named to the crew for the second crewed Apollo flight, with Command Pilot Walter \\"Wally\\" Schirra and Pilot Walter Cunningham. At this time, Eisele was promoted to the Senior Pilot position. In December 1966, Apollo 2 was cancelled on the grounds that it would be an unnecessary repeat of Apollo 1, and Schirra, Eisele, and Cunningham became the backups to Grissom's crew. But after Grissom, White, and Chaffee were killed in the Apollo 1 spacecraft fire of January 27, 1967, Schirra, Eisele, and Cunningham were named to fly the first crewed Apollo mission instead. It would ultimately be called Apollo 7. As the launch date approached, Eisele's participation was at risk; he was having an extramarital affair with a woman who would later become his second wife. Astronaut Office Chief Deke Slayton had warned the crew that they were all \\"expendable\\", and that any extramarital affairs must not become public. Eisele remained on the crew, and on October 11, 1968, Apollo 7 was launched on an 11-day mission‚Äîthe first crewed flight test of the third generation United States spacecraft. By this time, the Senior Pilot title was changed to Command Module Pilot. Together with spacecraft commander Schirra and Lunar Module Pilot Cunningham, Eisele performed simulated transposition and docking maneuvers with the upper stage of their Saturn IB launch vehicle, and acted as navigator, taking star sightings and aligning the spacecraft's guidance and navigation platform. The crew completed eight successful test firing maneuvers of the service module's propulsion engine. They also tested the performance of all spacecraft systems and broadcast the first live televised coverage of crew activities. Apollo 7 was placed in an Earth-orbit with an apogee of and perigee of . The 260-hour, 4.5 million mile (7.25 Gm; 7.25 million km) shakedown flight was successfully concluded on October 22, 1968, with splashdown occurring in the Atlantic, 8 miles (15 km) from the carrier USS Essex and only from the predicted target. Eisele logged 260 hours in space. Eisele served as backup Command Module Pilot for the 1969 Apollo 10 flight. Eisele resigned from the Astronaut Office in 1970 and became technical assistant for manned spaceflight at the NASA Langley Research Center, a position he occupied until retiring from both NASA and the Air Force in 1972. =Post-NASA career= In July 1972, Eisele became Country Director of the U.S. Peace Corps in Thailand. Returning from Thailand two years later, he became Sales Manager for Marion Power Shovel, a division of Dresser Industries. Eisele then handled private and corporate accounts for the investment firm of Oppenheimer & Company. In 1980, Eisele moved to Wilton Manors, Florida. In 1981, Eisele was appointed to a vacant seat on the Wilton Manors City Commission, and served in that political office for roughly one year. After Eisele's death, the City of Wilton Manors named Donn Eisele Park in his memory. Eisele was a guide in the 1986 Concorde Comet Chase flights out of Miami and New York. =Death= In 1987, at the age of 57, Eisele died of a heart attack while on a business trip to Tokyo, Japan, where he was to attend the opening of a new Space Camp patterned on the one at the U.S. Space & Rocket Center in Huntsville, Alabama. Eisele was cremated in Japan, and his ashes were buried in Arlington National Cemetery with full military honors. Organizations Eisele was an Eagle Scout, a member of Tau Beta Pi, and a Freemason, belonging to Luther B. Turner Lodge # 732 in Columbus, Ohio. Awards and honors Among the honors he received during his career were the NASA Exceptional Service Medal, the Air Force Senior Pilot Astronaut Wings, and the Air Force Distinguished Flying Cross. He was a co-recipient of the AIAA 1969 Haley Astronautics Award and was presented the National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences Special Trustees Award in 1969. Eisele was a part of a group of Apollo astronauts to be inducted into the International Space Hall of Fame in 1983. He was one of 24 Apollo astronauts who were inducted into the U.S. Astronaut Hall of Fame in 1997. In 2008, NASA posthumously awarded Eisele the NASA Distinguished Service Medal for his Apollo 7 mission. Legacy A family-approved account of Donn Eisele's life appears in the 2007 book In the Shadow of the Moon. Eisele's posthumously discovered memoir Apollo Pilot was published by University of Nebraska Press in 2017. In the 1998 HBO miniseries From the Earth to the Moon, Eisele was portrayed by John Mese. In the final three episodes of the 2015 ABC television series The Astronaut Wives Club, Eisele was portrayed by Ryan Doom. Susan Eisele Black donated a sample of a Moon rock to Broward County Main Library on behalf of her late husband, on October 23, 2007. Broward County Library, located in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, is the only library in the United States to have a lunar rock on display. The precious Moon rock is typically exhibited at science museums and schools. See also *List of Eagle Scouts *The Astronaut Monument References External links *Astronautix biography of Donn F.

Eisele"},{"id":"598419","text":"The Stage is a British weekly newspaper and website covering the entertainment industry, and particularly theatre. It was founded in 1880. It contains news, reviews, opinion, features, and recruitment advertising, mainly directed at those who work in theatre and the performing arts. History The first edition of The Stage was published (under the title The Stage Directory ‚Äì a London and Provincial Theatrical Advertiser) on 1 February 1880 at a cost of three old pence for twelve pages. Publication was monthly until 25 March 1881, when the first weekly edition was produced. At the same time, the name was shortened to The Stage and the publication numbering restarted at number 1. The publication was a joint venture between founding editor Charles Lionel Carson and business manager Maurice Comerford. It operated from offices opposite the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane. Carson, whose real name was Lionel Courtier-Dutton, was cited as the founder. His wife Emily Courtier Dutton later founded several theatrical charities. The Stage entered a crowded market, with many other theatre titles (including The Era) in circulation. Undercutting their rivals, Carson and Comerford dropped the price of the paper to one penny; soon it became the only remaining title in the field. The newspaper has remained in family ownership. Upon the death in 1937 of Charles Carson's son Lionel, who had assumed the joint role of managing director and editor, control passed to the Comerford family. From 1995, the newspaper has awarded The Stage Awards for Acting Excellence at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe. In 2004, 96-year-old contributor Simon Blumenfeld was recognised by Guinness World Records as the world's oldest weekly newspaper columnist. The column continued until shortly before his death in 2005. The Stage Awards were launched in 2010. They are given annually and recognise outstanding organisations working in theatre and beyond in the following categories: London theatre, regional theatre, producer, school, fringe theatre, theatre building, unsung hero and international. In August 2013, The Stage launched The Stage Castings, an online casting service with a video audition function. In May 2019, The Stage partnered with the Andrew Lloyd Webber Foundation and UK Theatre to launch Get Into Theatre, a website dedicated to theatre careers. Careers started via The Stage In 1956, writer John Osborne submitted his script for Look Back in Anger in response to an advertisement by the soon-to- be-relaunched Royal Court Theatre. Dusty Springfield responded to an advertisement for female singers in 1958. Idris Elba got his first acting role in a play after applying to a job ad in the paper. Harold Pinter gained his first job after responding to an advert and Kenneth Branagh landed the lead in The Billy Trilogy, in the BBC Play for Today series, after it was advertised in the paper. Ricky Tomlinson responded to an ad for United Kingdom, another Play for Today, in 1981 and Sandi Toksvig landed her first television job playing the part of Ethel in No. 73 after answering an ad in The Stage. Television presenter Maggie Philbin won her first major role, as a co- presenter of Multi-Coloured Swap Shop, after answering an advertisement in The Stage. A number of pop groups have recruited all or some of their members through advertisements placed in the newspaper, most notably the Spice Girls in 1994,The Spice Girls; Cripps, Rebecca; & Peachey, Mal (1997).

Selected in 1967, England was among a group of astronauts who served as backups during the Apollo and Skylab programs. Like most others in his class, he flew during the Space Shuttle program, serving as a mission specialist on STS-51F in 1985. He has logged more than 4,000 hours of flying time and 188 hours in space. England helped develop and use radars to probe the Moon on Apollo 17 and glaciers in Washington and Alaska. He participated in and led field parties during two seasons in Antarctica. England is currently dean of the College of Engineering and Computer Science at the University of Michigan's Dearborn campus. Biography =Early years and education= England was born May 15, 1942, in Indianapolis, Indiana, but his hometown is West Fargo, North Dakota. He attended primary school in Indianapolis, Indiana, and graduated from high school in North Dakota. At the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) he received his Bachelor of Science and Master of Science degrees in Earth and planetary sciences (course 12A) in 1965, and a Doctor of Philosophy degree in Earth and planetary sciences in 1970. England was a graduate fellow at MIT for the three years immediately preceding his first assignment to NASA. =Career= England was selected as a scientist-astronaut by NASA in August 1967, as part of the 6th astronaut selection. At 25 years 81 days old, he was the youngest candidate to be selected up to that time. He subsequently completed the initial academic training and a 53-week course in flight training at Laughlin Air Force Base, Texas. He received his wings with distinguished honors in April 1969. England served as a support crewman for the Apollo 13 and 16 flights. He was also an EVA CapCom during the Apollo 16 mission, talking to the astronauts while they explored the surface of the moon. Notably, he developed and communicated instructions for construction of the lithium hydroxide canisters on Apollo 13. England and Philip Chapman resigned from NASA in 1972, citing a decline in crewed missions. Neither had flown in space at that point. England joined the U.S. Geological Survey. He was deputy chief of the Office of Geochemistry and Geophysics for the U.S. Geological Survey, and associate editor for the Journal of Geophysical Research. He served on the National Academy's Space Studies Board, and on several federal committees concerned with Antarctic policy, nuclear waste containment, and federal science and technology. England returned to the Johnson Space Center in 1979 as a senior scientist-astronaut (mission specialist), was assigned to the operation mission development group of the Astronaut Office, and eventually managed that group. Space shuttle flight STS-51-F, carrying a seven-man crew and Spacelab-2, was launched from Kennedy Space Center, Florida on July 29, 1985. This mission was the first pallet-only Spacelab mission and the first mission to operate the Spacelab Instrument Pointing System (IPS). It carried 13 major experiments of which seven were in the field of astronomy and solar physics, three were for studies of the Earth's ionosphere, two were life science experiments, and 1 studied the properties of superfluid helium. England was responsible for activating and operating the Spacelab systems, operating the IPS and the Remote Manipulator System, assisting with experiment operations, and performing a contingency EVA had one been necessary. After 126 orbits of the Earth, STS 51-F Challenger landed at Edwards Air Force Base, California, on August 6, 1985. From May 1986 to May 1987, England served as a program scientist for Space Station Freedom (which later evolved into the International Space Station). From June 1987 to December 1987, he taught Remote Sensing Geophysics at Rice University. England retired from NASA in 1988. =Post-NASA career= England is dean of the College of Engineering and professor of electrical engineering and computer science at the University of Michigan‚ÄìDearborn. He is also a professor of electrical engineering and computer science and atmospheric, oceanic, and of space sciences in the College of Engineering at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. =Personal= England was married for 51 years to his childhood sweetheart, Kathi (Kreutz) until her death in 2013 and has two daughters, Heidi and Heather. He has five grandchildren. He is currently married to Susan Mills Stretchberry. His recreational interests include sailing and amateur radio. England's career is chronicled in the book NASA's Scientist-Astronauts by David Shayler and Colin Burgess.

Abdominal cavity The female reproductive system is made up of the internal and external sex organs that function in reproduction of new offspring. In humans, the female reproductive system is immature at birth and develops to maturity at puberty to be able to produce gametes, and to carry a foetus to full term. The internal sex organs are the uterus, Fallopian tubes, and ovaries. The uterus or womb accommodates the embryo which develops into the foetus. The uterus also produces vaginal and uterine secretions which help the transit of sperm to the Fallopian tubes. The ovaries produce the ova (egg cells). The external sex organs are also known as the genitals and these are the organs of the vulva including the labia, clitoris, and vaginal opening. The vagina is connected to the uterus at the cervix. At certain intervals, the ovaries release an ovum, which passes through the Fallopian tube into the uterus. If, in this transit, it meets with sperm, a single sperm (1-cell) can enter and merge with the egg or ovum (1-cell), fertilizing it into a zygote (1-cell). Fertilization usually occurs in the Fallopian tubes and marks the beginning of embryogenesis. The zygote will then divide over enough generations of cells to form a blastocyst, which implants itself in the wall of the uterus. This begins the period of gestation and the embryo will continue to develop until full-term. When the foetus has developed enough to survive outside the uterus, the cervix dilates and contractions of the uterus propel the newborn through the birth canal (the vagina). The corresponding equivalent among males is the male reproductive system. External organs The female external reproductive organs are the secondary organs that are visible externally. =Vulva= The vulva consists of all of the external parts and tissues and includes the mons pubis, pudendal cleft, labia majora, labia minora, Bartholin's glands, clitoris, and vaginal opening. Internal organs Sagittal MRI showing the location of the vagina, cervix, and uterus Illustration depicting female reproductive system (sagittal view) Frontal view as scheme of reproductive organs The female internal reproductive organs are the vagina, uterus, Fallopian tubes, and ovaries. =Vagina= The vagina is a fibromuscular (made up of fibrous and muscular tissue) canal leading from the outside of the body to the cervix of the uterus or womb. It is also referred to as the birth canal in the context of pregnancy. The vagina accommodates the male penis during sexual intercourse. Semen containing spermatozoa is ejaculated from the male at orgasm, into the vagina potentially enabling fertilization of the egg cell (ovum) to take place. =Cervix= The cervix is the neck of the uterus, the lower, narrow portion where it joins with the upper part of the vagina. It is cylindrical or conical in shape and protrudes through the upper anterior vaginal wall. Approximately half its length is visible, the remainder lies above the vagina beyond view. The vagina has a thick layer outside and it is the opening where the fetus emerges during delivery. =Uterus= The uterus or womb is the major female reproductive organ. The uterus provides mechanical protection, nutritional support, and waste removal for the developing embryo (weeks 1 to 8) and fetus (from week 9 until the delivery). In addition, contractions in the muscular wall of the uterus are important in pushing out the fetus at the time of birth. The uterus contains three suspensory ligaments that help stabilize the position of the uterus and limits its range of movement. The uterosacral ligaments keep the body from moving inferiorly and anteriorly. The round ligaments restrict posterior movement of the uterus. The cardinal ligaments also prevent the inferior movement of the uterus. The uterus is a pear-shaped muscular organ. Its major function is to accept a fertilized ovum which becomes implanted into the endometrium, and derives nourishment from blood vessels which develop exclusively for this purpose. The fertilized ovum becomes an embryo, develops into a fetus and gestates until childbirth. If the egg does not embed in the wall of the uterus, a female begins menstruation. =Fallopian tube= The Fallopian tubes are two tubes leading from the ovaries into the uterus. On maturity of an ovum, the follicle and the ovary's wall rupture, allowing the ovum to escape and enter the Fallopian tube. There it travels toward the uterus, pushed along by movements of cilia on the inner lining of the tubes. This trip takes hours or days. If the ovum is fertilized while in the Fallopian tube, then it normally implants in the endometrium when it reaches the uterus, which signals the beginning of pregnancy.The fallopian tubes made up of cillated columnar epithelium tissues =Ovaries= The ovaries are small, paired organs located near the lateral walls of the pelvic cavity. These organs are responsible for the production of the egg cells (ova) and the secretion of hormones. The process by which the egg cell (ovum) is released is called ovulation. The speed of ovulation is periodic and impacts directly to the length of a menstrual cycle. After ovulation, the egg cell is captured by the Fallopian tube, after traveling down the Fallopian tube to the uterus, occasionally being fertilized on its way by an incoming sperm. During fertilization the egg cell plays a role; it releases certain molecules that are essential to guiding the sperm and allows the surface of the egg to attach to the sperm's surface. The egg can then absorb the sperm and fertilization can then begin. The Fallopian tubes are lined with small hairs (cilia) to help the egg cell travel. Physiology The reproductive tract (or genital tract) is the lumen that starts as a single pathway through the vagina, splitting up into two lumens in the uterus, both of which continue through the Fallopian tubes, and ending at the distal ostia that open into the abdominal cavity. In the absence of fertilization, the ovum will eventually traverse the entire reproductive tract from the fallopian tube until exiting the vagina through menstruation. The reproductive tract can be used for various transluminal procedures such as fertiloscopy, intrauterine insemination, and transluminal sterilization. Development Chromosome characteristics determine the genetic sex of a fetus at conception. This is specifically based on the 23rd pair of chromosomes that is inherited. Since the mother's egg contains an X chromosome and the father's sperm contains either an X or Y chromosome, it is the male who determines the fetus's sex. If the fetus inherits the X chromosome from the father, the fetus will be a female. In this case, testosterone is not made and the Wolffian duct will degrade thus, the M√ºllerian duct will develop into female sex organs. The clitoris is the remnants of the Wolffian duct. On the other hand, if the fetus inherits the Y chromosome from the father, the fetus will be a male. The presence of testosterone will stimulate the Wolffian duct which will bring about the development of the male sex organs and the M√ºllerian duct will degrade. Clinical significance = Vaginitis = Vaginitis is inflammation of the vagina and largely caused by an infection. It is the most common gynaecological condition presented. It is difficult to determine any one organism most responsible for vaginitis because it varies from range of age, sexual activity, and method of microbial identification. Vaginitis is not necessarily caused by a sexually transmitted infection as there are many infectious agents that make use of the close proximity to mucous membranes and secretions. Vaginitis is usually diagnosed based on the presence of vaginal discharge, which can have a certain color, odor, or quality. = Bacterial vaginosis = This is a vaginal infection in women. It differs from vaginitis in that there is no inflammation. Bacterial vaginosis is polymicrobial, consisting of many bacteria species. The diagnosis for bacterial vaginosis is made if three of the following four criteria are present: (1) Homogenous, thin discharge, (2) a pH of 4.5 in the vagina, (3) epithelial cells in the vagina with bacteria attached to them, or (4) a fishy odor. It has been associated with an increased risk of other genital tract infections such as endometritis. = Yeast infection = This is a common cause of vaginal irritation and according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention at least 75% of adult women have experienced one at least once in their lifetime. Yeast infections are caused by an overgrowth of fungus in the vagina known as Candida. Yeast infections are usually caused by an imbalance of the pH in the vagina, which is usually acidic. Other factors such as pregnancy, diabetes, weakened immune systems, tight fitting clothing, or douching can also be a cause. Symptoms of yeast infections include itching, burning, irritation, and a white cottage-cheese-like discharge from the vagina. Women have also reported that they experience painful intercourse and urination as well. Taking a sample of the vaginal secretions and placing them under a microscope for evidence of yeast can diagnose a yeast infection. Treatment varies from creams that can be applied in or around the vaginal area to oral tablets that stop the growth of fungus. =Genital mutilation= There are many practices of mutilating female genitalia in different cultures. The most common two types of genital mutilation practiced are clitoridectomy, the circumcision of the clitoris and the excision of the prepuce the skin around the clitoris. They can all involve a range of adverse health consequences such as bleeding, irreparable tissue damage, and sepsis which can sometimes prove fatal. =Genital surgery= Genitoplasty refers to surgery that is carried out to repair damaged sex organs particularly following cancer and its treatment. There are also elective surgical procedures which change the appearance of the external genitals. Reproductive rights The International Federation of Gynaecology and Obstetrics was founded in 1954 to promote the well-being of women particularly in raising the standards of gynaecological practice and care. As of 2010 there were 124 countries involved. Reproductive rights are legal rights related to reproduction and reproductive health. Women have the right to control matters involving their sexuality including their sexual and reproductive health. Violation of these rights include forced pregnancy, forced sterilization, forced abortion and genital mutilation. Female genital mutilation is the complete or partial removal of a female's external genitals. History It is claimed in the Hippocratic writings that both males and females contribute their seed to conception; otherwise, children would not resemble either or both of their parents. Four-hundred years later, Galen \\"identified\\" the source of 'female semen' as the ovaries in female reproductive organs.Anwar, Etin. \\"The Transmission of Generative Self and Women's Contribution to Conception.\\" Gender and Self in Islam.

Ronald Ellwin Evans Jr., USN (November 10, 1933 ‚Äì April 7, 1990) was an American naval officer and aviator, electrical engineer, aeronautical engineer, NASA astronaut and, one of the 24 astronauts to have flown to the Moon, one of 12 people to have flown to the Moon without landing on it. Before becoming an astronaut, Evans graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree in Electrical Engineering from the University of Kansas and joined the U.S. Navy. After receiving his naval aviator wings, Evans served as a fighter pilot and flew combat during the Vietnam War. In 1964 he received a Master of Science degree in Aeronautical Engineering from the U.S. Naval Postgraduate School. Achieving the rank of captain, he retired from the Navy in 1976. Evans was selected as an astronaut by NASA as part of Astronaut Group 5 in 1966 and made his only flight into space as Command Module Pilot aboard Apollo 17 in December 1972, the last crewed mission to the Moon, with Commander Eugene Cernan and Lunar Module Pilot Harrison Schmitt. During the flight, Evans and five mice orbited the Moon a record 75 timesNASA Apollo 17 summary page as his two crewmates descended to the surface. He is the last person to orbit the Moon alone and, at 148 hours, holds the record for the most time spent in lunar orbit. In 1975 Evans served as backup Command Module Pilot for the Apollo‚ÄìSoyuz Test Project mission. During Apollo 17's return flight to Earth, Evans performed an extravehicular activity to retrieve film cassettes from the exterior of the spacecraft, the command and service module. It was the third \\"deep space\\" EVA, and is the spacewalk performed at the greatest distance from any planetary body. As of , it remains one of only three deep space EVAs, all made during the Apollo program's J-missions. It was also the final spacewalk of the Apollo program. Biography =Early life and education= Evans was born on November 10, 1933, in St. Francis, Kansas, to parents Clarence Ellwin Evans (1911‚Äì1985) and Marie A. Evans (; 1913‚Äì1992). He had two siblings, Larry Joe Evans (1935‚Äì1951) and Jay Evans.Ron Evans' family He was active in the Boy Scouts of America where he achieved its second highest rank, Life Scout. He graduated from Highland Park High School in Topeka, Kansas, in 1951, received a Bachelor of Science degree in Electrical Engineering from the University of Kansas in 1956, and a Master of Science degree in Aeronautical Engineering from the U.S. Naval Postgraduate School in 1964. He was a member of Tau Beta Pi, Society of Sigma Xi, and Sigma Nu. =Military service= In June 1957 he completed flight training after receiving his commission as an Ensign through the Navy ROTC Program at the University of Kansas. Upon receiving his aviator wings in 1962, he was a fighter pilot with Fighter Squadron 142 (VF-142), serving on two aircraft carrier cruises in the Pacific Ocean, then a combat flight instructor for the F-8 aircraft with Fighter Squadron 124 (VF-124). From 1964 to 1966 Evans was on sea duty in the Pacific, assigned to Fighter Squadron 51 (VF-51), flying F-8 Crusader from the carrier . During this assignment, he completed a seven-month tour of duty flying combat missions in Vietnam War. He was with VF-51 when he was selected as an astronaut in April 1966. Evans logged 5,100 hours of flight time, including 4,600 hours in jet aircraft. Evans during his trans-Earth EVA on Apollo 17 =NASA career= Evans was one of the 19 astronauts selected by NASA in April 1966. He served as a member of the astronaut support crews for the Apollo 7 and Apollo 11 flights, and as backup Command Module Pilot for Apollo 14. Evans' only space flight was as Command Module Pilot of Apollo 17, the last scheduled U.S. crewed mission to the Moon. He was accompanied by Eugene Cernan and Harrison Schmitt. While Cernan and Schmitt landed and worked on the Moon in the Taurus‚ÄìLittrow valley, Evans remained in lunar orbit on board the Command Module America, completing assigned work tasks which required visual geological observations, hand-held photography of specific targets, and the control of cameras and other highly sophisticated scientific equipment carried in the service module's SIM bay. The Blue Marble, an iconic photograph of Earth, is credited to the three crewmen of Apollo 17. On the way back to Earth, Evans completed a one-hour, six-minute extravehicular activity, successfully retrieving three camera cassettes and completing a personal inspection of the equipment bay area. He logged 301 hours and 51 minutes in space, 1 hour and 6 minutes of which were spent in extravehicular activity. He holds the record of most time spent in lunar orbit: six days and four hours (148 hours). Evans was later backup Command Module Pilot for the 1975 Apollo‚ÄìSoyuz Test Project (ASTP) mission. Evans retired from the U.S. Navy as Captain on April 30, 1976, with 21 years of service, and remained active as a NASA astronaut involved in the development of NASA's Space Shuttle program. He served as a member of the operations and training group within the Astronaut Office, responsible for launch and ascent phases of the Space Shuttle flight program. =Later years= Evans retired from NASA in March 1977 to pursue a career in the coal industry. Later he worked with Western American Energy Corporation in Scottsdale, Arizona, and was Director of Space Systems Marketing for Sperry Flight Systems. He died in his sleep of a heart attack in Scottsdale, Arizona, on April 7, 1990, and was survived by his widow Jan; his daughter, Jaime D. Evans (born August 21, 1959); and his son, Jon P. Evans (born October 9, 1961).Date of death according to death certificate issued by the State of Arizona on April 27, 1990, Certificate Number 169985, signed by G. E. Bolduc, MD. Awards and honors Evans was presented with the NASA Distinguished Service Medal in 1973, the Johnson Space Center Superior Achievement Award in 1970, the Navy Distinguished Service Medal in 1973, Navy Astronaut Wings, eight Air Medals, the Vietnam Service Medal, and the Navy Commendation Medal with combat distinguishing service in 1966. He received a University of Kansas Distinguished Service Citation in 1973, and was named Kansan of the Year in 1972. He was inducted into the International Space Hall of Fame in 1983, and the U.S. Astronaut Hall of Fame on October 4, 1997.

A goodwill ambassador may be an individual from one country who resides in or travels to another country, on a diplomatic mission (or international friendship mission) at a peer to peer level; that is: country to country, state to state, city to city, or as an intermediate emissary representative of the people of a specific organization or cultural group such as an indigenous tribe or enclave population. Goodwill ambassadors have been a part of governments and countries for as long as diplomacy has existed. They represent their constituents by traveling abroad exchanging or delivering gifts and presents while bringing awareness to their cause or purpose through public relations activities and organizing events. Goodwill ambassadors are responsible for delivering humanitarian relief, implementing public programs and providing development assistance to demonstrate benevolence and compassion between parties. Most often nation- states and organizations use well-known celebrities such as actors, actresses, musicians, scientists, authors, former politicians and other high society figures; but they also engage civilians and government officials to fulfill the role. Goodwill missions of US states and international nations are usually carried out or overseen by the head of state, but do not necessarily involve official diplomatic credentials beyond a letter of presentation, letters patent or a letter of credence, it is very rare that goodwill ambassadors are ever issued a diplomatic passport. However, some countries, such as Haiti, do issue credentials that include diplomatic immunity for goodwill ambassadorsWyclef Jean, Ban Ki-Moon, Bill Clinton Visit Haiti to Raise Global Awareness and Needs of Devastated Country. and organizations sometimes issue a civil service credential or international identification such as a laissez- passer.  Governments and Countries  Most governments have goodwill ambassadors that are appointed or known implicitly that promote the objectives of the country or government, normally without promoting political agendas or official state business. (See public diplomacy and citizen diplomacy) Governments of countries often recognize the spouse of a president, governor, prime minister or a monarch as goodwill ambassadors such as the First-Lady of the United States, Prince Philip the Duke of Edinburgh for the British Empire, and in the Caribbean country of Belize there is the Special Envoy for Women and Children, all are formally recognized or known as national goodwill ambassadors. Many countries and their national states or provincial regions use goodwill ambassadors to promote tourism, economic development, traditional values, customs and cultural ideals that contribute to their recognition. = United States = US states have civil service recognition programs that designate goodwill ambassadors honorarily and officially who are responsible for promoting tourism, economic development, cultural events and the prosperity of the state in general. The oldest example of this is the Kentucky Colonel, which is the highest award bestowed by the state's governor, established in 1813, the honorary award is given to civilians based on performing a great deed, community service or for accomplishing a noteworthy achievement that deserves recognition. The distinction of Kentucky colonel entitles the recipient to use the honorary title of \\"Colonel\\" and is denoted through the issuance of letters patent and is an official designation. Other US states also have similar civilian awards that denote the role of goodwill ambassador which are well-recognized including that of the Tennessee Colonel, Rhode Island Commodore, Nebraska Admiral, Order of the Longleaf Pine, Arkansas Traveler, Yellow Rose of Texas, and Sagamore of the Wabash. = United Kingdom = In the United Kingdom, Queen Elizabeth II bestows knighthood to her goodwill ambassadors upon being recognized for their contributions to the United Kingdom and the Commonwealth of Nations, which entitles them to use the titles of \\"Sir\\" or \\"Dame\\" as Commanders of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire. = Japan = Goodwill ambassadors are not always people, in 2008 Japan adopted the cartoon character Hello Kitty as their official goodwill tourism ambassador to China and Hong Kong. = Republic of Kosovo = Honorary Ambassador of the Republic of Kosovo is a title given to foreign citizens and citizens originating from Kosovo, who have contributed to the national interest of country and use their fame, the award is provided as a state decoration. Angelina Jolie, UNHCR Goodwill Ambassador at the World Economic Forum with spouse Brad Pitt and Kofi Annan, Secretary-General, United Nations with his spouse in Davos, Switzerland in 2006 = United Nations = The United Nations agencies appoint and employ popular celebrities to advocate their missions including FAO, UNAIDS, UNDP, UNEP, UNFPA, UNODC, UNICEF, UNHCR, UNIDO, UNESCO, WFP, WHO, UNWOMEN, OHCHR, UN-Habitat, and IMO all have or may have goodwill ambassadors who are appointed officially by the UN. The largest of these United Nations programs is UNICEF which has over three hundred (300) ambassadors around the world designated by country or region. The United Nations began using goodwill ambassadors to promote their missions in 1954, the first was actor Danny Kaye. The most famous of today's contemporary goodwill ambassadors was Angelina Jolie, who currently serves professionally as a Special Envoy to the UNHCR. International Organizations A wide range of organizations employ goodwill ambassadors to promote their programs and reach out to others based on goodwill relations and benevolence. There are supra governmental organizations such as the African Union and the European Union and international non-governmental organizations like the IUCN and the IOM. Goodwill ambassadors are also used by social and civil society organizations such as Rotary International, the Olympic Games, the Muscular Dystrophy Association and the organization of goodwill ambassadors, Globcal International which provides practical training, international appointments and nominations for those who become members. = Amnesty International = The Ambassador of Conscience Award is Amnesty International's most prestigious human rights award. It celebrates individuals and groups who have furthered the cause of human rights by showing exceptional courage standing up to injustice and who have used their talents to inspire others. It also aims to generate debate, encourage public action and raise awareness of inspirational stories and human rights issues. = Civil Society Award Programs = Numerous governmental and nongovernmental organizations employ goodwill ambassadors following the practice of honoring individuals with awards that denote goodwill ambassador status and roles. Awards are given for good relations, fundraising, acts of philanthropy and recognition for cause advocacy; some examples of such recognition are comedian Trevor Noah who received a South African Goodwill Ambassador Award in 2015,Staff. \\"South Africa Prizes Noah\\".

Blue and purple areas indicate rising due to the removal of the ice sheets. Yellow and red areas indicate falling as mantle material moved away from these areas in order to supply the rising areas, and because of the collapse of the forebulges around the ice sheets. This layered beach at Bathurst Inlet, Nunavut is an example of post- glacial rebound after the last Ice Age. Little to no tide helped to form its layer-cake look. Isostatic rebound is still underway here. Post-glacial rebound (also called isostatic rebound or crustal rebound) is the rise of land masses after the removal of the huge weight of ice sheets during the last glacial period, which had caused isostatic depression. Post-glacial rebound and isostatic depression are phases of glacial isostasy (glacial isostatic adjustment, glacioisostasy), the deformation of the Earth's crust in response to changes in ice mass distribution. The direct raising effects of post- glacial rebound are readily apparent in parts of Northern Eurasia, Northern America, Patagonia, and Antarctica. However, through the processes of ocean siphoning and continental levering, the effects of post-glacial rebound on sea level are felt globally far from the locations of current and former ice sheets.Milne, G.A., and J.X. Mitrovica (2008) Searching for eustasy in deglacial sea-level histories. Quaternary Science Reviews. 27:2292‚Äì2302. Overview Changes in the elevation of Lake Superior due to glaciation and post-glacial rebound During the last glacial period, much of northern Europe, Asia, North America, Greenland and Antarctica was covered by ice sheets, which reached up to three kilometres thick during the glacial maximum about 20,000 years ago. The enormous weight of this ice caused the surface of the Earth's crust to deform and warp downward, forcing the viscoelastic mantle material to flow away from the loaded region. At the end of each glacial period when the glaciers retreated, the removal of this weight led to slow (and still ongoing) uplift or rebound of the land and the return flow of mantle material back under the deglaciated area. Due to the extreme viscosity of the mantle, it will take many thousands of years for the land to reach an equilibrium level. The uplift has taken place in two distinct stages. The initial uplift following deglaciation was almost immediate due to the elastic response of the crust as the ice load was removed. After this elastic phase, uplift proceeded by slow viscous flow at an exponentially decreasing rate. Today, typical uplift rates are of the order of 1 cm/year or less. In northern Europe, this is clearly shown by the GPS data obtained by the BIFROST GPS network. Studies suggest that rebound will continue for at least another 10,000 years. The total uplift from the end of deglaciation depends on the local ice load and could be several hundred metres near the centre of rebound. Recently, the term \\"post-glacial rebound\\" is gradually being replaced by the term \\"glacial isostatic adjustment\\". This is in recognition that the response of the Earth to glacial loading and unloading is not limited to the upward rebound movement, but also involves downward land movement, horizontal crustal motion, changes in global sea levels and the Earth's gravity field, induced earthquakes, and changes in the Earth's rotation. Another alternate term is \\"glacial isostasy\\", because the uplift near the centre of rebound is due to the tendency towards the restoration of isostatic equilibrium (as in the case of isostasy of mountains). Unfortunately, that term gives the wrong impression that isostatic equilibrium is somehow reached, so by appending \\"adjustment\\" at the end, the motion of restoration is emphasized. Effects Post-glacial rebound produces measurable effects on vertical crustal motion, global sea levels, horizontal crustal motion, gravity field, Earth's rotation, crustal stress, and earthquakes. Studies of glacial rebound give us information about the flow law of mantle rocks, which is important to the study of mantle convection, plate tectonics and the thermal evolution of the Earth. It also gives insight into past ice sheet history, which is important to glaciology, paleoclimate, and changes in global sea level. Understanding postglacial rebound is also important to our ability to monitor recent global change. =Vertical crustal motion= Much of modern Finland is former seabed or archipelago: illustrated are sea levels immediately after the last ice age. Erratic boulders, U-shaped valleys, drumlins, eskers, kettle lakes, bedrock striations are among the common signatures of the Ice Age. In addition, post- glacial rebound has caused numerous significant changes to coastlines and landscapes over the last several thousand years, and the effects continue to be significant. In Sweden, Lake M√§laren was formerly an arm of the Baltic Sea, but uplift eventually cut it off and led to its becoming a freshwater lake in about the 12th century, at the time when Stockholm was founded at its outlet. Marine seashells found in Lake Ontario sediments imply a similar event in prehistoric times. Other pronounced effects can be seen on the island of √ñland, Sweden, which has little topographic relief due to the presence of the very level Stora Alvaret. The rising land has caused the Iron Age settlement area to recede from the Baltic Sea, making the present day villages on the west coast set back unexpectedly far from the shore. These effects are quite dramatic at the village of Alby, for example, where the Iron Age inhabitants were known to subsist on substantial coastal fishing. As a result of post- glacial rebound, the Gulf of Bothnia is predicted to eventually close up at Kvarken in more than 2,000 years. The Kvarken is a UNESCO World Natural Heritage Site, selected as a \\"type area\\" illustrating the effects of post- glacial rebound and the holocene glacial retreat. In several other Nordic ports, like Tornio and Pori (formerly at Ulvila), the harbour has had to be relocated several times. Place names in the coastal regions also illustrate the rising land: there are inland places named 'island', 'skerry', 'rock', 'point' and 'sound'. For example, Oulunsalo \\"island of Oulujoki\\" is a peninsula, with inland names such as Koivukari \\"Birch Rock\\", Santaniemi \\"Sandy Cape\\", and Salmioja \\"the brook of the Sound\\". (Compare and .) Map of Post Glacial Rebound effects upon the land-level on the British Isles. In Great Britain, glaciation affected Scotland but not southern England, and the post- glacial rebound of northern Great Britain (up to 10 cm per century) is causing a corresponding downward movement of the southern half of the island (up to 5 cm per century). This will eventually lead to an increased risk of floods in southern England and south-western Ireland. Since the glacial isostatic adjustment process causes the land to move relative to the sea, ancient shorelines are found to lie above present day sea level in areas that were once glaciated. On the other hand, places in the peripheral bulge area which was uplifted during glaciation now begins to subside. Therefore, ancient beaches are found below present day sea level in the bulge area. The \\"relative sea level data\\", which consists of height and age measurements of the ancient beaches around the world, tells us that glacial isostatic adjustment proceeded at a higher rate near the end of deglaciation than today. The present-day uplift motion in northern Europe is also monitored by a GPS network called BIFROST. Results of GPS data show a peak rate of about 11 mm/year in the north part of the Gulf of Bothnia, but this uplift rate decreases away and becomes negative outside the former ice margin. In the near field outside the former ice margin, the land sinks relative to the sea. This is the case along the east coast of the United States, where ancient beaches are found submerged below present day sea level and Florida is expected to be submerged in the future. GPS data in North America also confirms that land uplift becomes subsidence outside the former ice margin. =Global sea levels= To form the ice sheets of the last Ice Age, water from the oceans evaporated, condensed as snow and was deposited as ice in high latitudes. Thus global sea level fell during glaciation. The ice sheets at the last glacial maximum were so massive that global sea level fell by about 120 metres. Thus continental shelves were exposed and many islands became connected with the continents through dry land. This was the case between the British Isles and Europe (Doggerland), or between Taiwan, the Indonesian islands and Asia (Sundaland). A sub-continent also existed between Siberia and Alaska that allowed the migration of people and animals during the last glacial maximum. The fall in sea level also affects the circulation of ocean currents and thus has important impact on climate during the glacial maximum. During deglaciation, the melted ice water returns to the oceans, thus sea level in the ocean increases again. However, geological records of sea level changes show that the redistribution of the melted ice water is not the same everywhere in the oceans. In other words, depending upon the location, the rise in sea level at a certain site may be more than that at another site. This is due to the gravitational attraction between the mass of the melted water and the other masses, such as remaining ice sheets, glaciers, water masses and mantle rocks and the changes in centrifugal potential due to Earth's variable rotation. =Horizontal crustal motion= Accompanying vertical motion is the horizontal motion of the crust. The BIFROST GPS network shows that the motion diverges from the centre of rebound. However, the largest horizontal velocity is found near the former ice margin. The situation in North America is less certain; this is due to the sparse distribution of GPS stations in northern Canada, which is rather inaccessible. =Post-glacial rebound and isostasy= Vertical motion of a crustal block means that this block is not in isostatic equilibrium. However, it is in the process of reaching this equilibrium. =Tilt= The combination of horizontal and vertical motion changes the tilt of the surface. That is, locations farther north rise faster, an effect that becomes apparent in lakes. The bottoms of the lakes gradually tilt away from the direction of the former ice maximum, such that lake shores on the side of the maximum (typically north) recede and the opposite (southern) shores sink. This causes the formation of new rapids and rivers. For example, Lake Pielinen in Finland, which is large (90 x 30 km) and oriented perpendicularly to the former ice margin, originally drained through an outlet in the middle of the lake near Nunnanlahti to Lake H√∂yti√§inen. The change of tilt caused Pielinen to burst through the Uimaharju esker at the southwestern end of the lake, creating a new river (Pielisjoki) that runs to the sea via Lake Pyh√§selk√§ to Lake Saimaa. The effects are similar to that concerning seashores, but occur above sea level. Tilting of land will also affect the flow of water in lakes and rivers in the future, and thus important for water resource management planning. In Sweden Lake Sommen's outlet in the northwest has a rebound of is 2.36 mm/a while in the eastern Svanaviken it is 2.05 mm/a. This means the lake is being slowly tilted and the southeastern shores drowned. =Gravity field= Ice, water and mantle rocks have mass, and as they move around, they exert a gravitational pull on other masses towards them. Thus, the gravity field, which is sensitive to all mass on the surface and within the Earth, is affected by the redistribution of ice/melted water on the surface of the Earth and the flow of mantle rocks within. Today, more than 6000 years after the last deglaciation terminated, the flow of mantle material back to the glaciated area causes the overall shape of the Earth to become less oblate. This change in the topography of Earth's surface affects the long-wavelength components of the gravity field. The changing gravity field can be detected by repeated land measurements with absolute gravimeters and recently by the GRACE satellite mission. The change in long-wavelength components of Earth's gravity field also perturbs the orbital motion of satellites and has been detected by LAGEOS satellite motion. =Vertical datum= The vertical datum is a theoretical reference surface for altitude measurement and plays vital roles in many human activities, including land surveying and construction of buildings and bridges. Since postglacial rebound continuously deforms the crustal surface and the gravitational field, the vertical datum needs to be redefined repeatedly through time. =State of stress, intraplate earthquakes and volcanism= According to the theory of plate tectonics, plate-plate interaction results in earthquakes near plate boundaries. However, large earthquakes are found in intraplate environment like eastern Canada (up to M7) and northern Europe (up to M5) which are far away from present-day plate boundaries. An important intraplate earthquake was the magnitude 8 New Madrid earthquake that occurred in mid-continental US in the year 1811. Glacial loads provided more than 30 MPa of vertical stress in northern Canada and more than 20 MPa in northern Europe during glacial maximum. This vertical stress is supported by the mantle and the flexure of the lithosphere. Since the mantle and the lithosphere continuously respond to the changing ice and water loads, the state of stress at any location continuously changes in time. The changes in the orientation of the state of stress is recorded in the postglacial faults in southeastern Canada. When the postglacial faults formed at the end of deglaciation 9000 years ago, the horizontal principal stress orientation was almost perpendicular to the former ice margin, but today the orientation is in the northeast-southwest, along the direction of seafloor spreading at the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. This shows that the stress due to postglacial rebound had played an important role at deglacial time, but has gradually relaxed so that tectonic stress has become more dominant today. According to the Mohr‚ÄìCoulomb theory of rock failure, large glacial loads generally suppress earthquakes, but rapid deglaciation promotes earthquakes. According to Wu & Hasagawa, the rebound stress that is available to trigger earthquakes today is of the order of 1 MPa. This stress level is not large enough to rupture intact rocks but is large enough to reactivate pre-existing faults that are close to failure. Thus, both postglacial rebound and past tectonics play important roles in today's intraplate earthquakes in eastern Canada and southeast US. Generally postglacial rebound stress could have triggered the intraplate earthquakes in eastern Canada and may have played some role in triggering earthquakes in the eastern US including the New Madrid earthquakes of 1811. The situation in northern Europe today is complicated by the current tectonic activities nearby and by coastal loading and weakening. Increasing pressure due to the weight of the ice during glaciation may have suppressed melt generation and volcanic activities below Iceland and Greenland. On the other hand, decreasing pressure due to deglaciation can increase the melt production and volcanic activities by 20-30 times. =Recent global warming= Recent global warming has caused mountain glaciers and the ice sheets in Greenland and Antarctica to melt and global sea level to rise. Therefore, monitoring sea level rise and the mass balance of ice sheets and glaciers allows people to understand more about global warming. Recent rise in sea levels has been monitored by tide gauges and satellite altimetry (e.g. TOPEX/Poseidon). As well as the addition of melted ice water from glaciers and ice sheets, recent sea level changes are affected by the thermal expansion of sea water due to global warming, sea level change due to deglaciation of the last glacial maximum (postglacial sea level change), deformation of the land and ocean floor and other factors. Thus, to understand global warming from sea level change, one must be able to separate all these factors, especially postglacial rebound, since it is one of the leading factors. Mass changes of ice sheets can be monitored by measuring changes in the ice surface height, the deformation of the ground below and the changes in the gravity field over the ice sheet. Thus ICESat, GPS and GRACE satellite mission are useful for such purpose. However, glacial isostatic adjustment of the ice sheets affect ground deformation and the gravity field today. Thus understanding glacial isostatic adjustment is important in monitoring recent global warming. One of the possible impacts of global warming-triggered rebound may be more volcanic activity in previously ice-capped areas such as Iceland and Greenland. It may also trigger intraplate earthquakes near the ice margins of Greenland and Antarctica. Unusually rapid (up to 4.1 cm/year) present glacial isostatic rebound due to recent ice mass losses in the Amundsen Sea embayment region of Antarctica coupled with low regional mantle viscosity is predicted to provide a modest stabilizing influence on marine ice sheet instability in West Antarctica, but likely not to a sufficient degree to arrest it. Applications The speed and amount of postglacial rebound is determined by two factors: the viscosity or rheology (i.e., the flow) of the mantle, and the ice loading and unloading histories on the surface of Earth. The viscosity of the mantle is important in understanding mantle convection, plate tectonics, dynamical processes in Earth, the thermal state and thermal evolution of Earth. However viscosity is difficult to observe because creep experiments of mantle rocks at natural strain rates would take thousands of years to observe and the ambient temperature and pressure conditions are not easy to attain for a long enough time. Thus, the observations of postglacial rebound provide a natural experiment to measure mantle rheology. Modelling of glacial isostatic adjustment addresses the question of how viscosity changes in the radial and lateral directions and whether the flow law is linear, nonlinear, or composite rheology. Mantle viscosity may additionally be estimated using seismic tomography, where seismic velocity is used as a proxy observable Ice thickness histories are useful in the study of paleoclimatology, glaciology and paleo-oceanography. Ice thickness histories are traditionally deduced from the three types of information: First, the sea level data at stable sites far away from the centers of deglaciation give an estimate of how much water entered the oceans or equivalently how much ice was locked up at glacial maximum. Secondly, the location and dates of terminal moraines tell us the areal extent and retreat of past ice sheets. Physics of glaciers gives us the theoretical profile of ice sheets at equilibrium, it also says that the thickness and horizontal extent of equilibrium ice sheets are closely related to the basal condition of the ice sheets. Thus the volume of ice locked up is proportional to their instantaneous area. Finally, the heights of ancient beaches in the sea level data and observed land uplift rates (e.g. from GPS or VLBI) can be used to constrain local ice thickness. A popular ice model deduced this way is the ICE5G model. Because the response of the Earth to changes in ice height is slow, it cannot record rapid fluctuation or surges of ice sheets, thus the ice sheet profiles deduced this way only gives the \\"average height\\" over a thousand years or so. Glacial isostatic adjustment also plays an important role in understanding recent global warming and climate change. Discovery Before the eighteenth century, it was thought, in Sweden, that sea levels were falling. On the initiative of Anders Celsius a number of marks were made in rock on different locations along the Swedish coast. In 1765 it was possible to conclude that it was not a lowering of sea levels but an uneven rise of land. In 1865 Thomas Jamieson came up with a theory that the rise of land was connected with the ice age that had been first discovered in 1837. The theory was accepted after investigations by Gerard De Geer of old shorelines in Scandinavia published in 1890. Legal implications In areas where the rising of land is seen, it is necessary to define the exact limits of property. In Finland, the \\"new land\\" is legally the property of the owner of the water area, not any land owners on the shore. Therefore, if the owner of the land wishes to build a pier over the \\"new land\\", they need the permission of the owner of the (former) water area. The landowner of the shore may redeem the new land at market price. Usually the owner of the water area is the partition unit of the landowners of the shores, a collective holding corporation.

Conservation status Mniarogekko chahoua is currently being evaluated by CITES as a possible candidate for protective status. Taxonomy and systematics Mniarogekko chahoua was first described in 1869 as Platydactylus chahoua by Arthur Bavay, a French pharmacist and herpetologist.Beolens B, Watkins M, Grayson M. (2011). The Eponym Dictionary of Reptiles. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press. xiii + 296 pp. . (Rhacodactylus chahoua, p. 19). Description Mniarogekko chahoua gets its common name from the moss or lichen-like pattern it displays. Colors range from rusty red and brown to green or gray. There has been some notation that color could possibly be a geographic indicator in this species as the geckos from the outer islands most often display the lighter gray patterns. It commonly reaches a snout to vent length (SVL) of . It possesses a strong, well-muscled, fully prehensile tail and is not subject to dropping it as readily as some of its relatives. Diet Mniarogekko chahoua, like all of the New Caledonian geckos, are omnivores. Their diet in the wild consists of various insects and fruits. They may also consume small lizards. Reproduction Mniarogekko chahoua lays two well calcified eggs that become adhered to one another shortly after laying. This is known as \\"egg gluing\\". Mniarogekko chahoua is the only Rhacodactylus gecko that lays adhering eggs. The eggs are generally laid on top of the substrate (generally behind loose tree bark) and are guarded by the female. The eggs hatch 60‚Äì90 days after laying. Herpetoculture This gecko is seen in herpetoculture but rarely. A male-female pair may be kept in a terrarium with a minimum size of , but as with all arboreal geckos, the taller the enclosure the better. Plenty of hiding spaces including cork rounds and bushy plants should be used in the enclosure. References Further reading * Bauer AM, Jackman TR, Sadlier RA, Whitaker AH.

It was originally developed by AT&T; and first released in 1983. Four major versions of System V were released, numbered 1, 2, 3, and 4. System V Release 4 (SVR4) was commercially the most successful version, being the result of an effort, marketed as Unix System Unification, which solicited the collaboration of the major Unix vendors. It was the source of several common commercial Unix features. System V is sometimes abbreviated to SysV. , the AT&T-derived; Unix market is divided between three System V variants: IBM's AIX, Hewlett-Packard's HP-UX and Oracle's Solaris.  Overview  = Introduction = Unix history tree AT&T; System V license plate System V was the successor to 1982's UNIX System III. While AT&T; developed and sold hardware that ran System V, most customers ran a version from a reseller, based on AT&T;'s reference implementation. A standards document called the System V Interface Definition outlined the default features and behavior of implementations. = AT&T; support = During the formative years of AT&T;'s computer business, the division went through several phases of System V software groups, beginning with the Unix Support Group (USG), followed by Unix System Development Laboratory (USDL), followed by AT&T; Information Systems (ATTIS), and finally Unix System Laboratories (USL). = Rivalry with BSD = In the 1980s and early-1990s, UNIX System V and the Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD) were the two major versions of UNIX. Historically, BSD was also commonly called \\"BSD Unix\\" or \\"Berkeley Unix\\".Garfinkel, Simson. Spafford, Gene. Schwartz, Alan. Practical UNIX and Internet Security. 2003. pp. 15-20 Eric S. Raymond summarizes the longstanding relationship and rivalry between System V and BSD during the early period:Raymond, Eric S. The Art of Unix Programming. 2003. p. 38 While HP, IBM and others chose System V as the basis for their Unix offerings, other vendors such as Sun Microsystems and DEC extended BSD. Throughout its development, though, System V was infused with features from BSD, while BSD variants such as DEC's Ultrix received System V features. AT&T; and Sun Microsystems worked together to merge System V with BSD-based SunOS to produce Solaris, one of the primary System V descendants still in use today. Since the early 1990s, due to standardization efforts such as POSIX and the commercial success of Linux, the division between System V and BSD has become less important.  Releases  Blit, connected to a SVR3 host and showing the Layers interface = SVR1 = System V, known inside Bell Labs as Unix 5.0, succeeded AT&T;'s previous commercial Unix called System III in January, 1983. Unix 4.0 was never released externally, which would have been designated as System IV. This first release of System V (called System V.0, System V Release 1, or SVR1) was developed by AT&T;'s UNIX Support Group (USG) and based on the Bell Labs internal USG UNIX 5.0. System V also included features such as the vi editor and curses from 4.1 BSD, developed at the University of California, Berkeley; it also improved performance by adding buffer and inode caches. It also added support for inter-process communication using messages, semaphores, and shared memory, developed earlier for the Bell-internal CB UNIX. SVR1 ran on DEC PDP-11 and VAX minicomputers. = SVR2 = The DEC VAX-11/780 was the porting base for SVR2 AT&T;'s UNIX Support Group (USG) transformed into the UNIX System Development Laboratory (USDL), which released System V Release 2 in 1984. SVR2 added shell functions and the SVID. SVR2.4 added demand paging, copy-on-write, shared memory, and record and file locking. The concept of the \\"porting base\\" was formalized, and the DEC VAX-11/780 was chosen for this release. The \\"porting base\\" is the so-called original version of a release, from which all porting efforts for other machines emanate. Educational source licenses for SVR2 were offered by AT&T; for US$800 for the first CPU, and $400 for each additional CPU. A commercial source license was offered for $43,000, with three months of support, and a $16,000 price per additional CPU. Apple Computer's A/UX operating system was initially based on this release. SCO XENIX also used SVR2 as its basis. The first release of HP-UX was also an SVR2 derivative. Maurice J. Bach's book, The Design of the UNIX Operating System, is the definitive description of the SVR2 kernel. = SVR3 = 3B2 line of minicomputers was the porting base for SVR3 AT&T;'s UNIX System Development Laboratory (USDL) was succeeded by AT&T; Information Systems (ATTIS), which distributed UNIX System V, Release 3, in 1987. SVR3 included STREAMS, Remote File Sharing (RFS), the File System Switch (FSS) virtual file system mechanism, a restricted form of shared libraries, and the Transport Layer Interface (TLI) network API. The final version was Release 3.2 in 1988, which added binary compatibility to Xenix on Intel platforms (see Intel Binary Compatibility Standard). User interface improvements included the \\"layers\\" windowing system for the DMD 5620 graphics terminal, and the SVR3.2 curses libraries that offered eight or more color pairs and other at this time important features (forms, panels, menus, etc.). The AT&T; 3B2 became the official \\"porting base.\\" SCO UNIX was based upon SVR3.2, as was ISC 386/ix. Among the more obscure distributions of SVR3.2 for the 386 were ESIX 3.2 by Everex and \\"System V, Release 3.2\\" sold by Intel themselves; these two shipped \\"plain vanilla\\" AT&T;'s codebase. IBM's AIX operating system is an SVR3 derivative. = SVR4 = HP 9000 C110 running HP-UX in console mode OpenWindows, an early desktop environment for SVR4 HP 9000 735 running HP-UX with the Common Desktop Environment (CDE) A GNOME-based OpenSolaris desktop Sun Ultra 20 with Solaris 10 System V Release 4.0 was announced on October 18, 1988 and was incorporated into a variety of commercial Unix products from early 1989 onwards. A joint project of AT&T; Unix System Laboratories and Sun Microsystems, it combined technology from: * SVR3 * 4.3BSD * Xenix * SunOS New features included: * From BSD: TCP/IP support, sockets, UFS, support for multiple groups, C shell. * From SunOS: the virtual file system interface (replacing the File System Switch in System V release 3), NFS, new virtual memory system including support for memory mapped files, an improved shared library system based on the SunOS 4.x model, the OpenWindows GUI environment, External Data Representation (XDR) and ONC RPC. * From Xenix: x86 device drivers, binary compatibility with Xenix (in the x86 version of System V). * Korn shell. * ANSI X3J11 C compatibility. * Multi-National Language Support (MNLS). * Better internationalization support. * An application binary interface (ABI) based on Executable and Linkable Format (ELF). * Support for standards such as POSIX and X/Open. Many companies licensed SVR4 and bundled it with computer systems such as workstations and network servers. SVR4 systems vendors included Atari (Atari System V), Commodore (Amiga Unix), Data General (DG/UX), Fujitsu (UXP/DS), Hitachi (HI-UX), Hewlett-Packard (HP-UX), NCR (Unix/NS), NEC (EWS-UX, UP-UX, UX/4800, SUPER-UX), OKI (OKI System V), Pyramid Technology (DC/OSx), SGI (IRIX), Siemens (SINIX), Sony (NEWS-OS), Sumitomo Electric Industries (SEIUX), and Sun Microsystems (Solaris) with illumos in the 2010s as the only open-source platform. Software porting houses also sold enhanced and supported Intel x86 versions. SVR4 software vendors included Dell (Dell UNIX), Everex (ESIX), Micro Station Technology (SVR4), Microport (SVR4), and UHC (SVR4).Eric S. Raymond, A buyer's guide to UNIX versions for PC-clone hardware, posted to Usenet November 16, 1994. The primary platforms for SVR4 were Intel x86 and SPARC; the SPARC version, called Solaris 2 (or, internally, SunOS 5.x), was developed by Sun. The relationship between Sun and AT&T; was terminated after the release of SVR4, meaning that later versions of Solaris did not inherit features of later SVR4.x releases. Sun would in 2005 release most of the source code for Solaris 10 (SunOS 5.10) as the open-source OpenSolaris project, creating, with its forks, the only open-source (albeit heavily modified) System V implementation available. After Oracle took over Sun, Solaris was forked into proprietary release, but illumos as the continuation project is being developed in open-source. A consortium of Intel-based resellers including Unisys, ICL, NCR Corporation, and Olivetti developed SVR4.0MP with multiprocessing capability (allowing system calls to be processed from any processor, but interrupt servicing only from a \\"master\\" processor). Release 4.1 ES (Enhanced Security) added security features required for Orange Book B2 compliance and Access Control Lists and support for dynamic loading of kernel modules. = SVR4.2 / UnixWare = In 1992, AT&T; USL engaged in a joint venture with Novell, called Univel. That year saw the release System V.4.2 as Univel UnixWare, featuring the Veritas File System. Other vendors included UHC and Consensys. Release 4.2MP, completed late 1993, added support for multiprocessing and it was released as UnixWare 2 in 1995. Eric S. Raymond warned prospective buyers about SVR4.2 versions, as they often did not include on-line man pages. In his 1994 buyers guide, he attributes this change in policy to Unix System Laboratories. = SVR5 / UnixWare 7 = The Santa Cruz Operation (SCO), owners of Xenix, eventually acquired the UnixWare trademark and the distribution rights to the System V Release 4.2 codebase from Novell, while other vendors (Sun, IBM, HP) continued to use and extend System V Release 4. Novell transferred ownership of the Unix trademark to The Open Group. Any operating system that meets the Single Unix Specification (SUS), effectively a successor to the System V Interface Definition, may be granted Unix rights. The SUS is met by Apple's macOS, a BSD derivative, as well as several other operating systems not derived from either BSD or System V. System V Release 5 was developed in 1997 by the Santa Cruz Operation (SCO) as a merger of SCO OpenServer (an SVR3-derivative) and UnixWare, with a focus on large-scale servers. It was released as SCO UnixWare 7. SCO's successor, The SCO Group, also based SCO OpenServer 6 on SVR5, but the codebase is not used by any other major developer or reseller. = SVR6 (cancelled) = System V Release 6 was announced by SCO to be released by the end of 2004, but was apparently cancelled.SCO updates Unix, OpenServer product plans InfoWorld, August 19, 2003 It was supposed to support 64-bit systems.SCO UNIX Roadmap at Archive.is The industry has coalesced around The Open Group's Single UNIX Specification version 3 (UNIX 03). See also: Smallfoot  Market position  MATE desktop on OpenIndiana, an SVR4 derivative = Availability during the 1990s on x86 platforms = In the 1980s and 1990s, a variety of SVR4 versions of Unix were available commercially for the x86 PC platform. However, the market for commercial Unix on PCs declined after Linux and BSD became widely available. In late 1994, Eric S. Raymond discontinued his PC- clone UNIX Software Buyer's Guide on USENET, stating, \\"The reason I am dropping this is that I run Linux now, and I no longer find the SVr4 market interesting or significant.\\" In 1998, a confidential memo at Microsoft stated, \\"Linux is on track to eventually own the x86 UNIX market\\", and further predicted, \\"I believe that Linux ‚Äì moreso than NT ‚Äì will be the biggest threat to SCO in the near future.\\" An InfoWorld article from 2001 characterized SCO UnixWare as having a \\"bleak outlook\\" due to being \\"trounced\\" in the market by Linux and Solaris, and IDC predicted that SCO would \\"continue to see a shrinking share of the market\\". = Project Monterey = Project Monterey was started in 1998 to combine major features of existing commercial Unix platforms, as a joint project of Compaq, IBM, Intel, SCO, and Sequent Computer Systems. The target platform was meant to be Intel's new IA-64 architecture and Itanium line of processors. However, the project was abruptly canceled in 2001 after little progress.Raymond, Eric S. The Art of Unix Programming. 2003. p. 43 = System V and the Unix market = By 2001, several major Unix variants such as SCO UnixWare, Compaq Tru64 UNIX, and SGI IRIX were all in decline. The three major Unix versions doing well in the market were IBM AIX, Hewlett-Packard's HP-UX, and Sun's Solaris. In 2006, when SGI declared bankruptcy, analysts questioned whether Linux would replace proprietary Unix altogether. In a 2006 article written for Computerworld by Mark Hall, the economics of Linux were cited as a major factor driving the migration from Unix to Linux: The article also cites trends in high-performance computing applications as evidence of a dramatic shift from Unix to Linux: In a November 2015 survey of the top 500 supercomputers, Unix was used by only 1.2% (all running IBM AIX), while Linux was used by 98.8%; the same survey in November 2017 reports 100% of them using Linux. System V derivatives continued to be deployed on some proprietary server platforms. The principal variants of System V that remain in commercial use are AIX (IBM), Solaris (Oracle), and HP-UX (HP). According to a study done by IDC, in 2012 the worldwide Unix market was divided between IBM (56%), Oracle (19.2%), and HP (18.6%). No other commercial Unix vendor had more than 2% of the market. Industry analysts generally characterize proprietary Unix as having entered a period of slow but permanent decline. = OpenSolaris and illumos distributions= OpenSolaris and its derivatives are the only SVR4 descendants that are open-source software. Core system software continues to be developed as illumos used in illumos distributions such as SmartOS, OpenIndiana and others. = System V compatibility = The System V interprocess communication mechanisms are available in Unix-like operating systems not derived from System V; in particular, in Linux (a reimplementation of Unix) as well as the BSD derivative FreeBSD. POSIX 2008 specifies a replacement for these interfaces. FreeBSD maintains a binary compatibility layer for the COFF format, which allows FreeBSD to execute binaries compiled for some SVR3.2 derivatives such as SCO UNIX and Interactive UNIX.Lehey, Greg. The Complete FreeBSD: Documentation from the Source. 2003. pp. 164-165 Modern System V, Linux, and BSD platforms use the ELF file format for natively compiled binaries.

Culinary use  Fil√© powder is used in Louisiana Creole cuisine in the making of some types of gumbo, a thick Creole soup or stew often served over rice. Several different varieties exist. In New Orleans, what is known as Creole gumbo generally varies from house to house though still retaining its Native American origins. The Creoles of Cane River make a gumbo focused much more on fil√©. Fil√© can provide thickening when okra is not in season, in types of gumbo that use okra or a roux as a thickener for gumbo instead of fil√©.Howard Mitcham (1978), Creole Gumbo and All That Jazz, , as quoted in How to make Homemade File Powder at Nola Cuisine Sprinkled sparingly over gumbo as a seasoning and a thickening agent, fil√© powder adds a distinctive, earthy flavor and texture. Fil√© powder is made by harvesting the young leaves and stems of the sassafras tree and grinding them. Fil√© powder is generally not added until after the vegetables and meats or seafood are finished cooking and removed from the heat source.  History and etymology Choctaw Indians of the American South (Florida, Mississippi, Alabama, Louisiana) were the first to use dried, ground sassafras leaves as a seasoning. The French word fil√© is the past participle of the verb filer, meaning (among other things) \\"to turn into threads\\", \\"to become ropy\\". The name may derive from the word \\"ki ngombo\\", often shortened to \\"gombo\\", which meant okra in the Central Bantu dialect. Okra was a common thickener in soups and stews prepared by the African inhabitants of Louisiana, who were brought to the colony in large numbers beginning in 1719. Some scholars have suggested that the gumbo was adapted from the West African soups and stews which were thickened with okra. Eventually, okra was replaced as a thickener with the traditional sassafras. The earliest known mention of the dish is from a transcript of the interrogation of an enslaved African woman named Comba in 1764. In it, she states that she gave \\"un gombeau\\" to another slave. Other scholars have suggested that the name may derive from the Choctaw word for fil√© (kombo). Some early 20th century authors, most notably Celestine Eustis, suggested that gumbo including fil√© powder was an early special-occasion dish for native tribes. This is further implied by a late 18th-century Creole practice. At that time, rice was a luxury for many Creoles. They served gumbo over corn grits, a pairing common in the stews of native tribes.  Health concerns  Safrole and sassafras oil have been banned by the FDA as a carcinogen since 1960 and can not be used in food manufacture for this reason. According to a study published in 1997, the tree's leaves (from which fil√© is produced), do not contain detectable amounts of safrole.  Cultural references  \\"Fil√© gumbo\\" is famously mentioned in the classic country song by Hank Williams Sr., \\"Jambalaya (On the Bayou)\\", which held the number-one position on the U.S. country music charts for fourteen non-consecutive weeks in 1952.

To date, twenty-six novels have been published in the main series, with some novels comprising as many as four volumes. The series has also spawned anime, audio drama, manga, comic adaptations, a video game, as well as a short story collection, art books, and a supplemental guide book. Plot introduction D wanders through a far-future post-nuclear Earth that combines elements of pulp genres: western, science fiction, horror and Lovecraftian horror, high fantasy, folklore and occult science. The planet, once terrified by the elegant but cruel Nobles (vampires), ancient demons, mutants and their technological creations, is now slowly returning to a semblance of order and human control‚Äîthanks in part to the decadence that brought about the downfall of the vampire race, to the continued stubbornness of frontier dwellers, and to the rise of a caste of independent hunters-for- hire who eliminate supernatural threats. Some time in 1999, a nuclear war occurred. The Nobility were vampires that planned for a possible nuclear war and sequestered all that was needed to rebuild civilization in their shelters. They use their science combined with magic to restore the world in their image. Nearly all magical creatures are engineered, with a very small number being demons who survived the holocaust. Despite their technology being great enough to create a blood substitute as food, they still prefer to feed on humans. As such, they create a civilization where vampires and humans coexist, eventually developing the planet into parklands and cities. The society eventually stagnates when vampire technology perfects scientific prophecy, which determines they are at their zenith of existence and thus are doomed to fall, overthrown by humans. The human race was also transformed at this time, with fear for the vampires being woven into their genetics, and the inability to remember vampire weaknesses such as garlic and crucifixes. Unlike vampires from traditional lore, the Nobility have the ability to reproduce sexually, although their offspring will permanently cease aging after reaching physical maturity, having inherited their vampire parent's immortality. Main characters = D = D is a dhampir, the half-breed child of a vampire father and human mother, the ideal vampire hunter. He is renowned for his consummate skill and unearthly grace, but feared and despised for his mixed lineage: born of both races but belonging to neither. Often underestimated by his opponents, D possesses surprising power and resourcefulness, having most of the strengths of the Nobility and only mild levels of their common weaknesses. It has been seen in both movies that his power is not only physical, but extends into the magical realm as well. His supernatural powers make him one of the strongest beings in the world, if not the second strongest (second only to his father). However, D prefers his physical abilities, only using his magic in times of great need. Unlike most dhampirs, D is able to live as a \\"normal\\" human; however, he is marked by his unearthly beauty and exceptionally powerful aura, and thus rarely accepted by human settlements. In terms of weaknesses, he is randomly susceptible to sun-sickness, a severe type of sunstroke, about once every five years (far less than most dhampirs). D also recovers from it at a rate far greater than other dhampirs. Usually it takes several days to recover from sunlight syndrome, longer if the dhampir is exceedingly powerful, but D recovered in a few hours (around 1‚Äì6 hours approximately) despite being one of the strongest dhampirs alive. Otherwise, D does not appear to suffer from other vampiric weaknesses usual to dhampirs, being able to physically restrain opponents with his aura and having godlike reflexes surpassing even those of Nobles. His symbiotic left hand states, in \\"Vampire Hunter D: Bloodlust: \\"The three of you became impatient with the heartless Bastet and impaled her on 'The Sword'\\". Speculation on whether \\"The Sword\\" is D's sword or not is debatable. It is important to note here, however, that the movie differs sharply from the book it takes its story from, Vampire Hunter D: Demon Deathchase, and future entries in the novel series do not differentiate between Dracula, The Vampire King, The Sacred Ancestor and D's father, proposing that they are one and the same. D rides a cybernetic horse with mechanical legs and other enhancements, wields a crescent longsword which looks similar to Yoshitaka Amano's scimitar sword design found in many of his works of art, but the sword has a hefty length, similar to that of a Japanese nodachi. D always wears a mystical blue pendant; it prevents many of the automatic defenses (such as laser fields and small nuclear blasters) created by the Nobility in past millennia from working properly, and allows him to enter their sealed castles. In the novels and game, he also uses wooden needles which he can throw with super speed. He protects his milk-white face from the noonday sun with long black hair, flowing black clothing and cape, and the shadow of a wide-brimmed hat. D is described as appearing as a youth between 17 and 18 years old, though D's age is unknown (although in the novel Pale Fallen Angel parts I and II, it is made known that he is at least 5,000 years old). His beauty is mesmerizing, often unintentionally wooing women and sometimes flustering men. Very little is known of D's past and the identity of his parents is ambiguous, but his innate power suggests that his father is an extraordinarily powerful vampire. Regarding D's birth, some Nobles whisper dark rumors about their vampire progenitor, the Sacred Ancestor known as Count Dracula, bedding a human woman called \\"Mina the Fair\\" (implied to be Mina Harker). Dracula conducted bizarre crossbreeding experiments involving himself and countless human women or even other vampires, with the only successful product of the experiments being D. D, wanting nothing to do with his father save for killing him, refuses to go by his true name. Instead, he shortens it to the first letter. In Twin Shadowed Knight it is revealed that D has a twin who goes unnamed. The twin states that he and D were born from the same woman in exactly the same conditions. = Left Hand = The symbiote that resides in D's left hand D is the host for a sentient symbiote, Left Hand, a wisecracking homunculus with a human face residing in his left palm, who can suck in massive amounts of matter through a wind void or vacuum tunnel. Left Hand enjoys needling the poker-faced D, but only appears as needed, rarely witnessed or heard by anyone other than D, yet aware of many of D's thoughts and actions. At all other times, D's left hand appears normal. Besides providing a contrast to D's reserved demeanor, Left Hand is incredibly useful, possessing many mysterious powers such as psychometry, inducing sleep, determining the medical condition of a victim, and the ability to size up the supernatural powers or prowess of an enemy, even beyond D's keen senses. In the first and second novels, Left Hand can also revive D when his physical condition is suffering, by consuming the four elements and converting the resulting energy into life force. This ability even saved D from the usually fatal stake through the heart he received from Rei-Ginsei in the first novel. Left Hand has its own mind and will, and acts as D's guide and sole permanent companion, providing a reservoir of knowledge pertaining to the lost Noble culture. So far, Left Hand's origins are unknown, and it is unclear how they came to be joined. However, some of its nature is revealed in the third book, which features a similar creature; it is implied he was one of the Barbarois (human/monster hybrids) who served in the personal retinue of Count Dracula. = Dracula = Dracula's role in the novels is very mixed, appearing both as the bane and savior to isolated towns, and deified as a legendary god-king to the vampires, many of whom have never even met him in person. D quotes Dracula's precepts (\\"Transient guests are we\\"‚Äîimplied to refer to the Nobility) in the first novel. Dracula appears both as a lawgiver honored for his intelligence, who showed some interest in preserving humans, and as a ruthless scientist (in the second novel), conducting hybrid breeding experiments with humans in order to perpetuate his own dwindling species. D appears to have encountered his alleged father on at least one occasion, as when at times D reaches a place where the imprint of Dracula's power remains, D remembers Dracula telling him that \\"You are my only success.\\" Like D, Dracula is portrayed as a mysterious and handsome young wanderer who deals with both life and death. However, in the English dub of the anime, D states that Dracula respected humanity and did not feed on innocent people. Publication history Beginning in 1983, Kikuchi has so far written 31 Vampire Hunter novels spanning 44 volumes. All of the official publications in the series were originally published by Asahi Sonorama until the Sonorama branch went out of business in September 2007. The release of D ‚Äì Throng of Heretics in October 2007 under the Asahi Bunko ‚Äì Sonorama Selection label marked the transition to the new publisher, Asahi Shimbun Publishing, a division of Asahi Sonorama's parent company. From December 2007 through January 2008, Asahi Shimbun Publishing reprinted the complete Vampire Hunter catalogue under the Sonorama Selection label. On May 11, 2005, the first official English translation was released under DH Press, translated by Kevin Leahy. As of November 2016, 21 novels have been translated into and released in English, spanning 24 volumes. In January 2011, Hideyuki Kikuchi published the first spinoff set in the Vampire Hunter universe, a series of prequels titled , illustrated by Ayami Kojima, artist and character designer for the Castlevania series of video games. It takes place over 5,000 years before Vampire Hunter D and focuses on expanding the history of the Nobility, following the exploits of the vampire warrior Lord Greylancer. In 2013, Viz Media's Haikasoru imprint released the first official English translation of the prequel series, retitled Noble V: Greylancer, translated by Takami Nieda with newly commissioned cover artwork by Vincent Chong. Adaptations =1985 animated film= Vampire Hunter D remains a cult classic among English-speaking audiences. Billed by the Japanese producers as a \\"dark future science-fiction romance\\" Vampire Hunter D is set in the year 12,090 AD, in a post-nuclear holocaust world where vampires, mutants and demons \\"slither through a world of darkness\\" (in the words of the film's opening introduction). =1988‚Äì1990 audio dramas= Asashi Sonorama created audio drama adaptations of three of the novels, in five parts: # Raiser of Gales \\"D\\" (January 1988) (the book it was based on was published May 1984) # D ‚Äì Demon Deathchase (June 1988) # D ‚Äì Mysterious Journey to the North Sea I: To the North Sea (March 1990) # D ‚Äì Mysterious Journey to the North Sea II: Summer at Last (May 1990) # D ‚Äì Mysterious Journey to the North Sea III: When Winter Comes Again (June 1990). Most of the voice cast for the original OVA reprised their roles. Originally released on cassette tape, in 2005 they were re- released as a special edition, five-disc Vampire Hunter D Audio Drama Box, including a small supplemental booklet with a new short story by Kikuchi and an \\"art cloth\\" with an illustration by Amano. =1999 video game= A video game based on Vampire Hunter D Bloodlust was also made for the PlayStation game console, titled Vampire Hunter D. It is a survival horror game, but also similar to a standard adventure title. The player can see D from different pre-rendered angles throughout the game, and allow D to attack enemies with his sword. D can also use magic, Left Hand's abilities, and items. The story of the game is similar to that of Vampire Hunter D Bloodlust, although it takes place entirely within the castle as D fights all the enemies. Only two of the Barbarois mutants appear as enemies. There are 3 endings, 1 of which is similar to the end of the anime. =2000 animated film= The second film, Vampire Hunter D: Bloodlust garnered respect for its advanced animation techniques, detailed art style and character designs, voice acting originally recorded in English (English voice casting/direction by Jack Fletcher), and its sophisticated orchestral soundtrack composed, arranged and conducted by Marco D'Ambrosio. Its art style closely mirrored that of the illustrator and original character designer of the first movie, Yoshitaka Amano. The storyline features a larger cast than the first film. The second Vampire Hunter D movie (known as Vampire Hunter D: Bloodlust outside of Japan) is based on the third of Hideyuki Kikuchi's Vampire Hunter D novels (Demon Deathchase in English). Unlike the first film, which was released in 1985, this movie is rated NC-16 in Singapore, M in Australia, 15 in the UK, R13 in New Zealand and R for violence/gore in the USA (except for the Blu-ray release, which is unrated).Vampire Hunter D Bloodlust on IMDb, The Internet Movie Database, September 26, 2008 =2007 manga adaptation= In November 2007, the first volume of Saiko Takaki's manga adaptation of Hideyuki Kikuchi's series was published simultaneously in the U.S., Japan, and Europe. The project, overseen by Digital Manga Publishing and Hideyuki Kikuchi, aimed to adapt the entire catalogue of Vampire Hunter D novels into a manga form, however it had concluded after the eighth volume =2016 comic book series= On June 30, 2016, a Kickstarter crowdfunding campaign for a five-issue Vampire Hunter D comic book series titled Vampire Hunter D: Message from Mars was announced. Published by Stranger Comics with supervision from series creator Hideyuki Kikuchi and support from the creative teams at Unified Pictures and Digital Frontier, Message from Mars is an adaptation of the 2005 short story Message from Cecile and acts as a prequel to the then-in-development animated series. The series is written by Brandon M. Easton and illustrated by Michael Broussard, with visual development by Christopher Shy. The campaign's stretch goals also include an official Vampire Hunter D Pathfinder Roleplaying Game supplement written by F. Wesley Schneider. The campaign reached its $25,000 funding goal on July 1, 2016 and its initial $50,000 stretch goal on July 7, 2016. The campaign concluded on August 9, 2016, with 1,736 backers pledging a total of $107,025, reaching four out of five stretch goals. Following the first issue the series was placed on temporary hiatus due to a serious medical emergency in Broussard's family, resuming production in early 2018 with new artists Ryan Benjamin and Richard Friend. =Upcoming animated series= In June 2015, a new CGI animated series tentatively titled Vampire Hunter D: Resurrection was announced, produced by Unified Pictures and Digital Frontier. The series would be produced by Kurt Rauer and Scott McLean, and directed by Yoichi Mori, with Bloodlust director Yoshiaki Kawajiri acting as supervising director and series creator Hideyuki Kikuchi providing editorial supervision. The series was currently in pre-production, and is developed as an hour-long serial drama with the intent of being broadcast on a major American cable network or on-demand provider, with Japanese distribution to follow. As of June 2016 the series is still in pre-production, with plans to begin shipping the project to distributors by the end of the year. Given the abundance of source material, the current plan is to produce as many as seven seasons, without revisiting the source material that was adapted into the first two films. In February 2018 it was announced that the pilot episode would be written by Brandon M. Easton, writer for the Message from Mars comic book series. The first draft of the pilot was completed in October 2018. =Other media= In July 2008, Devils Due Publishing announced that it had acquired the rights to publish an English-language Vampire Hunter D comic book mini- series titled Vampire Hunter D: American Wasteland, to be written by Jimmy Palmiotti and pencilled by Tim Seeley, however the project was cancelled in 2009.LBCC '09: Jimmy Palmiotti (Jonah Hex, Powergirl and More) ComicVine, October 6, 2009 Intended to infuse the standard Vampire Hunter D formula and mythos with more Western sensibilities, it would have told an original story about D departing the Frontier to embark on a journey to a new land still ruled by the vampiric Nobility.}} In 2010, it was reported in Japanese horror magazine Rue Morgue that Hideyuki Kikuchi was in talks with one of the producers for Capcom's Resident Evil video game series to develop a live- action Vampire Hunter D adaptation.'Vampire Hunter D' Live-Action Movie In The Works?

The term pulmonary circulation is readily paired and contrasted with the systemic circulation. The vessels of the pulmonary circulation are the pulmonary arteries and the pulmonary veins. A separate system known as the bronchial circulation supplies oxygenated blood to the tissue of the larger airways of the lung.  Structure  3D rendering of a high resolution computed tomography of the thorax. The anterior thoracic wall, the airways and the pulmonary vessels anterior to the root of the lung have been digitally removed in order to visualize the different levels of the pulmonary circulation. Image showing main pulmonary artery coursing ventrally to the aortic root and trachea. The right pulmonary artery passes dorsally to the ascending aorta, while the left pulmonary artery passes ventrally to the descending aorta. Deoxygenated blood leaves the heart, goes to the lungs, and then re-enters the heart; Deoxygenated blood leaves through the right ventricle through the pulmonary artery. From the right atrium, the blood is pumped through the tricuspid valve (or right atrioventricular valve), into the right ventricle. Blood is then pumped from the right ventricle through the pulmonary valve and into the main pulmonary artery. =Lungs= The pulmonary arteries carry deoxygenated blood to the lungs, where carbon dioxide is released and oxygen is picked up during respiration. Arteries are further divided into very fine capillaries which are extremely thin-walled. The pulmonary vein returns oxygenated blood to the left atrium of the heart. =Veins= The oxygenated blood then leaves the lungs through pulmonary veins, which return it to the left part of the heart, completing the pulmonary cycle. This blood then enters the left atrium, which pumps it through the mitral valve into the left ventricle. From the left ventricle, the blood passes through the aortic valve to the aorta. The blood is then distributed to the body through the systemic circulation before returning again to the pulmonary circulation. =Arteries= From the right ventricle, blood is pumped through the semilunar pulmonary valve into the left and right main pulmonary arteries (one for each lung), which branch into smaller pulmonary arteries that spread throughout the lungs. Development The pulmonary circulation loop is virtually bypassed in fetal circulation. The fetal lungs are collapsed, and blood passes from the right atrium directly into the left atrium through the foramen ovale: an open conduit between the paired atria, or through the ductus arteriosus: a shunt between the pulmonary artery and the aorta. When the lungs expand at birth, the pulmonary pressure drops and blood is drawn from the right atrium into the right ventricle and through the pulmonary circuit. Over the course of several months, the foramen ovale closes, leaving a shallow depression known as the fossa ovalis. Clinical significance A number of medical conditions can affect the pulmonary circulation. * Pulmonary hypertension describes an increase in resistance in the pulmonary arteries * Pulmonary embolus is a blood clot, usually from a deep vein thrombosis that has lodged in the pulmonary vasculature. It can cause difficulty breathing or chest pain, is usually diagnosed through a CT pulmonary angiography or V/Q scan, and is often treated with anticoagulants such as heparin and warfarin. * Cardiac shunt is an unnatural connection between parts of the heart that leads to blood flow that bypasses the lungs. * Vascular resistance * Pulmonary shunt History The opening page of one of Ibn al-Nafis's medical works The discovery of pulmonary circulation has been attributed to several scientists over the years. In much of modern medical literature, the discovery is credited to English physician William Harvey (1578 - 1657 CE). Other sources credit Spanish physician Michael Servetus (c. 1509 - 1553 CE) and Arab physician Ibn al-Nafis (1213 - 1288 CE) with the discovery. However, earlier descriptions of the cardiovascular system are found in ancient cultures. The earliest known description of the role of air in circulation was produced in Egypt in 3500 BCE. At this time, Egyptians believed that the heart was the origin of many channels that connected different parts of the body and transported air as well as urine, blood, and the soul. The Edwin Smith Papyrus (1700 BCE), named for American Egyptologist Edwin Smith (1822 - 1906 CE) who purchased the scroll in 1862, provided evidence that Egyptians believed that the heartbeat created a pulse that transported the above substances throughout the body. A second scroll, the Ebers Papyrus (c. 1550 BCE), also emphasized the importance of the heart and its connection to vessels throughout the body and described methods to detect cardiac disease through pulse abnormalities. However, despite their knowledge of the heartbeat, vessels, and pulse, the Egyptians attributed the movement of substances throughout the vessels to air that resided in these channels, rather than to the heart's force. The Egyptians knew that air played an important role in circulation, but they did not yet apparently have a concept for the precise role of the lungs. The next addition to the human understanding of pulmonary circulation came with the Ancient Greeks. The physician Alcmaeon (520 - 450 BCE) proposed that the brain, not the heart, was the connection point for all of the vessels in the body. He believed that the function of these vessels was to bring the spirit (pneuma) and air to the brain. Empedocles (492 - 432 BCE), a philosopher, proposed a series of pipes impermeable to blood but continuous with blood vessels which carried the pneuma throughout the body. He proposed that this spirit was internalized with pulmonary respiration. The physician Hippocrates (460 - 370 BCE) developed the view that the liver and spleen produced blood, which traveled to the heart to be cooled by the lungs that surrounded it. Hippocrates described the heart as having two ventricles connected by an interventricular septum. He depicted the heart as the connecting point for all the vessels of the body and proposed that some vessels carried only blood, while others also carried air. These air-carrying vessels were the pulmonary veins, which brought air to the left ventricle, and the pulmonary artery, which carried air to the right ventricle and blood to the lungs. He also proposed two atria of the heart that functioned to capture air. Hippocrates was one of the first to begin to accurately describe the anatomy of the heart and to describe the involvement of the lungs in circulation, but his descriptions of the process of pulmonary circulation and of the functions of the parts of the heart were still largely incorrect. Greek philosopher and scientist Aristotle (384 - 322 BCE) followed Hippocrates and proposed that the heart had three ventricles, rather than two, that all connected to the lungs. The Greek physician Erasistratus (315 - 240 BCE) agreed with Hippocrates and Aristotle that the heart was the origin of all of the vessels in the body but proposed a system in which air was breathed into the lungs and traveled to the left ventricle via pulmonary veins. It was transformed there into the pneuma and distributed throughout the body by arteries, which contained only air. In this system, veins distributed blood throughout the body, and this blood did not circulate, but rather was consumed by the organs. The Greek physician Galen (129 - c. 210 CE) provided the next insights into pulmonary circulation. Though many of his theories, like those of his predecessors, were incorrect, his theory of pulmonary circulation dominated the medical community for hundreds of years after his death. Galen contradicted Erasistratus before him by proposing that arteries carried both air and blood, rather than air alone. He proposed that the liver was the point of origin for all blood vessels and that the heart was not a pumping muscle, but rather an organ which blood passed through. Galen's theory included a new description of pulmonary circulation. In it, air was inhaled into the lungs where it became the pneuma. Pulmonary veins transmitted this pneuma to the left ventricle of the heart to cool the blood simultaneously arriving there. This mixture of pneuma, blood, and cooling produced the vital spirits which could then be transported throughout the body via arteries. Galen also proposed that the heat of the blood arriving in the heart produced noxious vapors which were expelled through the same pulmonary veins that first brought the pneuma. He wrote that the right ventricle played a different role than the left; it transported blood to the lungs where the impurities were vented out so that clean blood could be distributed throughout the body. Though Galen's description of the anatomy of the heart was more complete than those of his predecessors, it included several mistakes. Most notably, Galen believed that blood flowed between the two ventricles of the heart through small, invisible pores in the interventricular septum. The next developments in the human understanding of pulmonary circulation did not come until centuries later. Persian polymath Avicenna (c. 980 - 1037 CE) wrote a medical encyclopedia entitled The Canon of Medicine. In this book, he translated and compiled contemporary medical knowledge and added some new information of his own. However, Avicenna's description of pulmonary circulation reflected the incorrect views of Galen. The Arab physician, Ibn al-Nafis, wrote the Commentary on Anatomy in Avicenna's Canon in 1242 in which he provided the first known accurate description of pulmonary circulation as it is known today. Ibn al-Nafis made two key improvements on Galen's ideas of pulmonary circulation. First, he disproved the existence of the pores in the interventricular septum that Galen had believed to allow blood flow between the left and right ventricles. Second, he followed that the only way for blood to get from the right to the left ventricle in the absence of interventricular pores was pulmonary circulation. He also described the anatomy of the lungs in clear, correct detail, which his predecessors had not. However, like Aristotle and Galen, al- Nafis still believed that the vital spirit was formed in the left ventricle from a mixture of blood and air. Despite the enormity of Ibn al-Nafis's improvements on the theories of pulmonary circulation that preceded him, his commentary on The Canon was not widely known to Western scholars until the manuscript was discovered in Berlin, Germany, in 1924. As a result, Ibn al- Nafis was not widely credited with the discovery of pulmonary circulation in Western medical literature until recently. It took several hundred years for European scientists and physicians to reach the same conclusions that al-Nafis had. Italian polymath Leonardo da Vinci (1452 - 1519 CE) was one of the first to propose that the heart was just a muscle, rather than a vessel of spirits and air, but he ascribed to Galen's ideas of circulation and defended the existence of interventricular pores. The Flemish physician Andreas Vesalius (1514 - 1564 CE) published corrections to Galen's view of circulatory anatomy, questioning the existence of interventricular pores, in his book De humani corporis fabrica libri septem in 1543. Michael Servetus after him was the first European physician to accurately describe pulmonary circulation. His assertions matched those of al-Nafis, and though he has been frequently credited with making the discovery on his own, it is likely that he had access to Ibn al-Nafis's work while writing his own texts. Servetus published his findings in Christianismi Restituto (1553), a theological work that was considered \\"heretical\\" by Catholics and Calvinists alike, burned on the stake (along with its author) and barely survived in a few copies. Italian physician Realdo Colombo (c. 1515 - 1559 CE) published a book, De re anatomica libri XV, in 1559 that accurately described pulmonary circulation as well. It is still debated among historians as to whether or not Colombo reached his conclusions on his own or if he based his work on those of al-Nafis and Servetus. Finally, William Harvey provided the most complete and accurate description of pulmonary circulation of any of the European physicians in his treatise Exercitatio Anatomica de Motu Cordis et Sanguinis in Animalibus in 1628.

In September 2004, BOC had over 30,000 employees on six continents, with sales of over ¬£10.6 billion.BOC Report and Accounts 2005 BOC was a constituent of the FTSE 100 Index and the FT 30. On 5 September 2006 the BOC Group became part of the Linde Group of Germany.  History  =Early years as Brin's Oxygen Company (1886‚Äì1905)= Brin's Oxygen Company, Ltd. was formed in 1886, by two French brothers, Arthur and Leon Brin. In the early years, the company manufactured oxygen using a high temperature barium oxide process, known as the Brin process, developed from the work of French scientist Jean Baptiste Boussingault. The main application for gaseous oxygen at that time was in connection with generation of limelight, used in magic lanterns and theatre lighting. A major new market emerged around 1903, with the development of the oxyacetylene welding process. Around the same time, new cryogenic air separation processes had been devised independently in Britain, the United States and Germany. The German engineer and founder of the Linde Group, Carl von Linde, won the patent for the process. The Brin brothers negotiated an agreement to use the Linde patents. In exchange, Carl von Linde was given a stake and a board position in Brin's Oxygen Company, which he held until 1914. The new process replaced the inefficient barium oxide process, paving the way for larger scale and more efficient production. =As BOC and expansion (1906‚Äì1978)= In 1906, the Brin brothers renamed the company the British Oxygen Company or BOC. During the First World War, the business increased significantly as the mass production of needed war machinery‚Äîships, tanks and trucks‚Äîinvolved either metal cutting or welding. In the post-war period, it grew by acquisitions, which included Sparklets Ltd, Allen-Liversidge Ltd and the Quasi-Arc Company. During the Second World War, the gases for munitions and for medical needs were provided by BOC. As in the First World War, the business grew. After the war, BOC formed subsidiaries in over twenty countries. In the 1950s, due to the increased demand for automobiles, improved methods of manufacturing steel were invented which required \\"tonnage\\" oxygen. This meant further increase in business for BOC. BOC diversified into many industries in the 1960s and '70s. One was refrigeration market and it set up a joint venture called BOC-Linde Refrigeration Ltd.', with Linde AG of Germany in 1968. It also acquired Ace Refrigeration Ltd and J. Muirhead Ltd, quick frozen food suppliers, in 1969. With the plan of expanding into the Far East, it set up British Oxygen (Far East) Ltd, based in Tokyo. It established subsidiaries and joint ventures in Jamaica, the Netherlands, South Africa, Sweden and Spain for a number of products; which included transformers, magnetising equipment, frozen foods, stable isotopes, radioactively labelled compounds and cryogenic systems. In 1971, the company installed the largest mainframe computer in Britain, linking a network of computers throughout the country, and sold computer time to outside customers. As a result, BOC diversified into the computer business. The 1973 oil crisis led to a rethinking of BOC's future strategy. It divested non-strategic assets; and concentrated on its primary business, especially the gases and health care markets, and the expansion of these businesses to Europe, the Americas and the Far East. In 1975, the company officially became 'BOC International Ltd', reflecting its success in developing business outside of Britain, and in products beyond oxygen. =BOC Group (1978‚Äì2006)= An important part of BOC's history was the acquisition of Airco Industrial Gases, an American competitor. After 11 years of litigation, in 1978 Airco became a wholly owned subsidiary of BOC. The enlarged company changed its name to the BOC Group. In 1999, reports emerged that the US Industrial gases company Praxair - a 1992 spun off from Linde AG's US division, 'Union Carbide Industrial Gases' \\\\- were in possible merger discussions with BOC Group. Following the breakup of the talks, France's L'Air Liquide S.A. and Air Products & Chemicals Inc. made a series of cash offers to acquire the group.BOC rejects takeover bid On 13 July 1999, the BOC board approved a pre-conditional cash offer of ¬£14.60 per share. The BOC Group's assets were to be divided between Air Liquide and Air Products in the US$11 billion deal.Balloon goes up on BOC independence On 12 May 2000, the bid lapsed, following failure to reach a satisfactory agreement with the United States Federal Trade Commission.BOC merger collapses Following the collapse of the bid, BOC Group developed a new strategy to stimulate business growth in new products and markets, and to reshape its existing portfolio of businesses to improve Group performance. In 2001, BOC Group announced it was cutting 1,500 jobs. In late 2002, the company merged its Japanese industrial and medical gas businesses with those of Air Liquide to form Japan Air Gases. BOC also acquired Praxair's operations in Poland. In November 2003, BOC Group announced that it would complete the sale of Afrox Healthcare - a hospital and managed health care group operating in South Africa - to a consortium led by Black Economic Empowerment investors.BOC sells South African Hospital stake =Part of the Linde Group (2006‚Äìpresent)= The BOC Group's total revenues in 2005, including its share of joint ventures and associate companies, were ¬£4.6 billion and was then the second largest industrial gas supplier in the world. Industrial gases business made up for more than 80% of sales. The group was getting nearly one-third of its revenues from Asia Pacific; Europe accounted for 28% and the Americas 27%. In January 2006, the Linde Group made a preliminary proposal to acquire BOC Group based in a ¬£15 per share all-cash offer, which was rejected by the BOC board of directors. In March 2006, the second proposal based on a ¬£16 per share all-cash offer, valuing the company at ¬£8.2bn (US$14.4bn; ‚Ç¨12bn), was accepted and takeover was completed on 5 September 2006.Statement on Linde homepage After nearly a century of intermittent courtship, BOC became a part of Linde Group and the synergy overtook Air Liquide as the global market leader. On 6 September, BOC Group employees received a welcome pack including a letter from Linde CEO Professor Dr. Wolfgang Reitzle, a small badge representing the new logo of 'The Linde Group' and a Swatch watch. Many of these watches quickly appeared on eBay. On 12 March 2007, the Linde Group divested the vacuum business known as BOC Edwards to the private investment group 'CCMP Capital'. Operations The BOC Group business activities included: *The Process Gas Solutions (PGS) line of business, supplying large product volumes by pipeline, on-site generation or cryogenic tanker. *The Industrial and Special Products (ISP) line of business providing packaged gas, chemicals and related products and services. The gases involved are typically delivered in high pressure cylinders and range from technical grades to high purity specialty gases. *BOC Edwards supplying the semiconductor industry with vacuum, chemical delivery and abatement systems and related services. It also supplies vacuum equipment to many industrial and scientific sectors. *Gist Limited provides logistics solutions, transport and warehousing to a number of sectors including food, beverage and fashion retail for large corporations including Marks & Spencer, Waitrose and Tesco. Headquarters When BOC was a global company, the head office of BOC was in Windlesham, a small village approximately 25 miles south west of London. The office, built in the 1980s is a fine example of modern architecture and when seen from the air resembles the shape of an oxygen molecule. Today, this office stands empty and has now been sold. Many of the staff that were based in the Windlesham office have since moved to the BOC office in Guildford and Linde plc's head office in Munich, Germany.

The village is part of Stratford-on-Avon district, and in the 2001 census it had a population of 2,278, increasing to 2,337 at the 2011 Census. Kineton is about ten miles (16 km) from the towns of Banbury to the south-east, Warwick and Leamington Spa to the north, and Stratford-upon- Avon to the west. Nearby is the village of Wellesbourne with its historic water mill, Compton Verney House art gallery, the British Motor Museum at Gaydon, the Burton Dassett Hills country park and the battlefield of Edgehill. Kineton, in the district historically known as the Vale of the Red Horse, can also be considered to be part of the informal area of Banburyshire. Kineton district council ward covers Gaydon, Lighthorne, Lighthorne Heath, Compton Verney, Combrook, Little Kineton and Chadshunt, a population of 4,228 according to the 2001 census, rising to 4,320 at the 2011 census. The village has some areas of light industry but is largely agricultural; many residents commute to nearby towns and cities for employment. History King John's Castle The first recorded reference to Kineton was in 969, when Saxon King Edgar granted some land here to a trusted counsellor. The village is mentioned in the Domesday Book as Kington. On the outskirts of the village, at the foot of Pittern Hill, are the remains of the earthworks of a motte-and-bailey castle, known as King John's Castle, so called because it is believed that King John held a Court Leet there. Kineton gave its name to the area of south- east Warwickshire known as Kineton Hundred.Allen, Geoff (2000). Warwickshire Towns & Villages, Watford, Hertfordshire: Sigma Leisure Ltd. Early in the 13th century, Stephen de Segrave had a Tuesday market in his manor of Kineton, and a fair on the eve and day of St Peter and St Paul. The market died out by 1840, when the market house was pulled down and a school built on its site, but the fair on 5 February continued until recently. For a period of the English Civil War, Kineton was looted by Prince Rupert with part of the Royalist army. This was after he had defeated Sir James Ramsay, from the Parliamentarians, and by doing this he failed to aid the rest of his army, thus leading to a neutral ending to the Battle of Edgehill on 23 October 1642. A year later, in July 1643, King Charles met with Queen Henrietta Maria at Kineton. John Newton who lived from 1725 to 1807 and for a while lived in the village of Kineton where he wrote the words to \\"Amazing Grace\\" in 1772 William Kendall, co-builder of Birmingham Town Hall and subsequent Warwick County Surveyor and Steward to the Earl of Warwick, lived in Little Kineton in 1841.Harris, Penelope, \\"The Architectural Achievement of Joseph Aloysius Hansom (1803-1882): Designer of the Hansom Cab, Birmingham Town Hall, and Churches of the Catholic Revival\\", The Edwin Mellen Press, 2010, pp.73,74 ; 1841 census. Military connections During World War II, Kineton served as a transit camp, with Polish and Czechoslovakian troops stationed there. One of the UK's main military ammunition depots is located partially within Kineton parish, and is known as the Defence Storage and Distribution Agency (DSDA), Kineton.http://www.mod.uk/DefenceInternet/DefenceFor/ServiceCommunity/Hive/Central/KinetonHive.htm It extends to several hundred acres and is linked to the main Network Rail system by a branch line. The depot also stores spare railway carriages and trains on behalf of the various UK Train Operating companies. Partially within Kineton parish, from 1942 until 1977, RAF Gaydon operated as both a training unit and a front-line bomber base. In 1978, the site passed into civilian ownership and today contains the British Motor Museum, the headquarters and factory of sports car manufacturer Aston Martin, and the Jaguar Land Rover Gaydon Centre. Present St Peter's Church, Kineton Near the centre of the village stands St Peter's Church. Work on the current building, which replaced an earlier church on the same site, began in the 13th century. A completed church was consecrated in 1315. Of this new building only the fine tower remains. The rest of the building has been rebuilt and remodelled over the centuries. In the 18th century Sanderson Miller enlarged the nave and added two transepts. A further remodelling campaign, which transformed the building into its current form, took place in the 19th century. Pittern Hill Windmill In 2008, three new bells were cast to augment the bells to eight, one replacing an existing bell. Taylors Eayre & Smith Ltd of Loughborough carried out the work. The eight bells were rung for the first time on 5 November 2008. The village also has a 19th-century Methodist chapel and a 20th-century Roman Catholic church. Pittern Hill Mill, north-west of the village, is a stone windmill of the 18th century. Village shops include a Co-op store, a traditional butcher, a newsagent, a flower shop, an optician, and the Nifty Needle curtain and soft furnishings/fabrics shop and workroom. There is a post office/convenience store and had a branch of HSBC Bank now converted into a pharmacy (2017). The village has a veterinary practice, a caf√©, a fish and chip shop, two public houses, \\"The Swan\\", newly refurbished, and The Carpenters Arms (which has a Chinese take-away inside) and a restaurant, Shukur's Brasserie (which offers Bangladeshi and Indian cuisine). The village and surrounding area are served by Kineton Church of England Primary School and Kineton High School, which takes students aged 11‚Äì19. Transport Kineton is close to the Fosse Way Roman Road and the M40 motorway which links it to Birmingham and London. Regular bus services to Stratford upon Avon, Banbury and Leamington Spa are operated by Stagecoach and other independent companies. The village was once served by the Stratford-upon-Avon and Midland Junction Railway between Stratford-upon-Avon and Towcester. Kineton railway station opened on 1 June 1871 and was situated on the Broom to Fenny Compton line. The station closed in 1963 due to the Beeching Axe and the line itself closed two years later. Sports Kineton Sports and Social Club hosts football, cricket and bowls teams. The football team competes in the Leamington & District Sunday Football League, affiliated to the Birmingham FA and the cricket side competes in the Cotswold Hills League. Kinetonbcycle are a group cycling from Little Kineton at 19:15 on Wednesday nights covering around 25 miles with on and off-road routes and including a pub stop. Kineton Hign School is the home of Wellesbourne Badminton Club who play in the Leamington and Banbury Leagues and have a club night every Tuesday from 7.30 pm, and South Warwickshire Junior Badminton Club who are a Badminton England Affiliated Club playing on a Friday night at 6.30 pm.

In the Russian Empire, they were called Ostyaks, without differentiating them from several other Siberian peoples. Later they became known as Yenisey ostyaks, because they lived in the middle and lower basin of the Yenisei River in the Krasnoyarsk Krai district of Russia. The modern Kets lived along the eastern middle stretch of the river before being assimilated politically into Russia between the 17th and 19th centuries. According to the 2010 census, there were 1,220 Kets in Russia. History The Ket are thought to be the only survivors of an ancient nomadic people believed to have originally lived throughout central and southern Siberia. In the 1960s the Yugh people were distinguished as a separate, though similar, group. Today's Kets are the descendants of the tribes of fishermen and hunters of the Yenisei taiga, who adopted some of the cultural ways of those original Ket-speaking tribes of South Siberia. The earlier tribes engaged in hunting, fishing, and even reindeer breeding in the northern areas. The Ket were incorporated into the Russian state in the 17th century. Their efforts to resist were futile as the Russians deported them to different places to break up their resistance. This also broke up their strictly organized patriarchal social system and their way of life disintegrated. The Ket people ran up huge debts with the Russians. Some died of famine, others of diseases introduced from Europe. By the 19th century, the Kets could no longer survive without food support from the Russian state. In the 20th century, the Soviets forced collectivization upon the Ket. They were officially recognized as Kets in the 1930s when the Soviet Union started to implement the self-definition policy with respect to indigenous peoples. However, Ket traditions continued to be suppressed and self-initiative was discouraged. Collectivization was completed by the 1950s and the Russian lifestyle and language forced upon the Ket people. The population of Kets has been relatively stable since 1923. According to the 2002 census, there were 1,494 Kets in Russia. This compares with 1,200 in the 1970 census. Today the Ket live in small villages along riversides and are no longer nomadic. Language The Ket language has been linked to the Na-Den√© languages of North America in the Den√©‚ÄìYeniseian language family. This link has led to some collaboration between the Ket and some northern Athabaskan peoples. Ket means \\"man\\" (plural deng \\"men, people\\"). The Kets of the Kas, Sym and Dubches rivers use jugun as a self-designation. In 1788 Peter Simon Pallas was the earliest scholar to publish observations about the Ket language in a travel diary. In 1926, there were 1,428 Kets, of whom 1,225 (85.8%) were native speakers of the Ket language. The 1989 census counted 1,113 ethnic Kets with only 537 (48.3%) native speakers left. As of 2008, there were only about 100 people who still spoke Ket fluently, half of them over 50. It is entirely different from any other language in Siberia. Alexander Kotusov (1955‚Äì2019) was a Ket folk singer, composer and writer of songs in the Ket language.Siberian Lang ‚Äì Alexander Maksimovich Kotusov Culture The Ket traditional culture was researched by Matthias Castr√©n, Vasiliy Ivanovich Anuchin, Kai Donner, Hans Findeisen, and Yevgeniya Alekseyevna Alekseyenko.Hopp√°l 2005: 170‚Äì171 Shamanism was a living practice into the 1930s, but by the 1960s almost no authentic shamans could be found. Shamanism is not a homogeneous phenomenon, nor is shamanism in Siberia. As for shamanism among Kets, it shared characteristics with those of Turkic and Mongolic peoples.Hopp√°l 2005: 172 Additionally, there were several types of Ket shamans,Alekseyenko 1978Hopp√°l 2005: 171 differing in function (sacral rites, curing), power, and associated animals (deer, bear). Also, among Kets (as with several other Siberian peoples such as the KaragasDi√≥szegi 1960: 128, 188, 243Di√≥szegi 1960: 130Hopp√°l 1994: 75) there are examples of the use of skeleton symbolics. Hopp√°l interprets this as a symbol of shamanic rebirth,Hopp√°l 1994: 65 although it may symbolize also the bones of the loon (the helper animal of the shaman, joining the air and underwater worlds, just like the story of the shaman who travelled both to the sky and the underworld).Hopp√°l 2005: 198 The skeleton-like overlay represented shamanic rebirth among some other Siberian cultures as well.Hopp√°l 2005: 199 Of great importance to Kets are dolls, described as \\"an animal shoulder bone wrapped in a scrap of cloth simulating clothing.\\"A. A. Malygna, Dolls of the Peoples of Siberia 1988, p. 132, cited in Edward J. Vajda, Yeniseian Peoples and Languages: A History of Yeniseian Studies with an annotated bibliography and a source guide, Curzon Press, 2001. One adult Ket, who had been careless with a cigarette, said, \\"It's a shame I don't have my doll. My house burnt down together with my dolls.\\"Werner Herzog, Happy People: A Year in the Taiga (documentary film) 2010. Kets regard their dolls as household deities, which sleep in the daytime and protect them at night.Herzog Vajda spent a year in Siberia studying the Ket people, and finds a relationship between the Ket language and the Na-Dene languages, of which Navajo is the most prominent and widely spoken. Vyacheslav Ivanov and Vladimir Toporov compared Ket mythology with that of Uralic peoples, assuming in the studies that they are modelling semiotic systems in the compared mythologies. They have also made typological comparisons.Ivanov & Toporov 1973Ivanov 1984:390, in editorial afterword by Hopp√°l Among other comparisons, possibly from Uralic mythological analogies, the mythologies of Ob-Ugric peoplesIvanov 1984: 225, 227, 229 and Samoyedic peoplesIvanov 1984: 229, 230 are mentioned. Other authors have discussed analogies (similar folklore motifs, purely typological considerations, and certain binary pairs in symbolics) may be related to a dualistic organization of society‚Äîsome dualistic features can be found in comparisons with these peoples.Ivanov 1984: 229‚Äì231 However, for Kets, neither dualistic organization of societyZolotaryov 1980: 39 nor cosmological dualismZolotaryov 1980: 48 have been researched thoroughly. If such features existed at all, they have either weakened or remained largely undiscovered. There are some reports of a division into two exogamous patrilinear moieties,Zolotaryov 1980: 37 folklore on conflicts of mythological figures, and cooperation of two beings in the creation of the land, the motif of the earth-diver.Ivanov 1984: 229 This motif is present in several cultures in different variants. In one example, the creator of the world is helped by a waterfowl as the bird dives under the water and fetches earth so that the creator can make land out of it. In some cultures, the creator and the earth- fetching being (sometimes called a devil, or taking the shape of a loon) compete with one another; in other cultures (including the Ket variant), they do not compete at all, but rather collaborate.Paulson 1975 :295 However, if dualistic cosmologies are defined in a broad sense, and not restricted to certain concrete motifs, then their existence is more widespread; they exist not only among some Uralic peoples, but in examples on every inhabited continent.Zolotarjov 1980: 56  Origin  The Ket people share their origin with other Yeniseian people. They are closely related to other Siberians, East Asians and Indigenous peoples of the Americas. They are a Mongoloid population and belong mostly exclusive to yDNA haplogroup Q-M242. According to a recent study, the Ket and other Yeniseian people originated likely somewhere near the Altai Mountains or near Lake Baikal. Many Yeniseians were assimilated into the modern Turkic people. It is suggested that the Altaians are predominantly of Yeniseian origin and closely related to the Ket people. Other Siberian Turkic groups have also greatly assimilated Yeniseian people. The Ket people are also closely related to several Native American groups. According to this study, the Yeniseians are linked to Paleo-Eskimo groups. File:No-nb bldsa 3f081.jpgKet woman, 1913 File:No-nb bldsa 3f077.jpgKet women and children, 1913 File:No-nb bldsa 3f078.

The common name of this bird commemorates the British naturalist Edgar Leopold Layard; his first wife, Barbara Anne Calthrop, whom he married in 1845, is commemorated in the specific epithet. Description left Layard's parakeet is a green parrot, 29 cm long including a tail up to 13 cm. The adult has a bluish-grey head and back, separated by a green collar. There is a broad black chin stripe and the tail is blue tipped yellow. The upper mandible of the male's bill is red and the lower mandible is brown. The female is similar, but has an all black beak and less green on the face than the male. Immature birds are mainly green, with an orange bill.Forshaw (2006). plate 39. Behaviour Layard's parakeet is a bird of forests, particularly at the edges and in clearings, and also gardens. It is locally common. It undergoes local movements, driven mainly by the availability of the fruit, seeds, buds and blossoms that make up its diet. It is less gregarious than some of its relatives, and is usually in small groups outside the breeding season, when it often feeds with brahminy starlings. Its flight is swift and direct, and the call is a raucous chattering. It nests in holes in large trees, laying 3‚Äì4 white eggs.

Zootaxa 3404: 1‚Äì52. (Correlophus sarasinorum, new combination). also called commonly Roux's giant gecko, Sarasins' giant gecko, Sarasin's [sic] giant gecko (incorrectly), and the suras gecko, is a species of lizard in the family Diplodactylidae. The species is native to the southern portions of the outlying New Caledonian island of Grande Terre. Etymology The specific name, sarasinorum (masculine, genitive, plural), is in honor of Swiss zoologists Karl Friedrich Sarasin and Paul Benedict Sarasin, who were cousins.Beolens, Bo; Watkins, Michael; Grayson, Michael (2011). The Eponym Dictionary of Reptiles. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press. xiii + 296 pp. . (Rhacodactylus sarasinorum, p. 233). Conservation status C. sarasinorum is currently being evaluated by CITES for protective status and is considered vulnerable to extinction in many herpetological circles. It has been found only in six locales in its native habitat. Description Since there is a considerable variation in snout-to-vent length (SVL) of C. sarasinorum, which ranges from 3.5 to 5.5 inches (9 to 14 centimeters), it has been suggested that more than one subspecies exists; there is no universal consensus on this point. The basic color of the suras gecko is brown to gray. Two color patterns exist. A white spotted version is the recessive trait, and a white \\"V\\" pattern is the dominant trait. The gecko's appearance has often been described as similar to a large Correlophus ciliatus, with larger eyes. Habitat The preferred natural habitats of C. sarasinorum are forest and shrubland, at altitudes of . Behavior C. sarasinorum is nocturnal, and less arboreal than the other Rhacodactylus (sensu lato) geckos. It is often found hiding under the leaf litter or under loose bark. This species has an animal instinct of sleeping on top of plants or in small trees face up preventing the common FTS (Floppy Tail Syndrome) caused by the gecko sleeping upside down. Diet C. sarasinorum is an omnivore and is also considered to be frugiverous. In the wild it eats insects and fruit. Reproduction The female C. sarasinorum lays two eggs which are buried in a soft, damp substrate. The eggs hatch 60‚Äì90 days after being laid. In captivity The species C. sarasinorum is sometimes seen in captivity. A pair may be kept in a 20-gallon (76-liter) \\"high\\" terrarium.

Born Islwyn Ffoulkes Ellis in Wrexham and raised in Glyn Ceiriog, Elis was educated at the University of Wales colleges of Bangor and Aberystwyth. During World War II he was a conscientious objector and he began writing poetry and prose, winning the prose medal at the 1951 National Eisteddfod. He became a Presbyterian minister in 1950, and his first pastorate was at Moreia Chapel in Llanfair Caereinion. He translated the Gospel of Matthew into Welsh as Efengyl Mathew - trosiad i gymraeg diweddar, which was published in Caernarfon in 1961. He made his debut as a novelist in 1953 with Cysgod y Cryman (translated into English as Shadow of the Sickle), which would, in 1999, be chosen as the most significant Welsh language book of the 20th century. As a novelist Elis showed a great willingness to try out different forms, including popular ones. Cysgod y Cryman was followed by a study of intellectual decadence, Ffenestri tua'r Gwyll (Windows to the Dusk 1955). Yn √¥l i Leifior (1956; translated into English as Return to Lleifior) was a sequel to Cysgod y Cryman both set at the fictitious farming location Lleifior. In 1957, the Welsh nationalist party Plaid Cymru published his time- travel story Wythnos yng Nghymru Fydd (A Week in Future Wales), presenting an independent, utopian Wales and a dystopian \\"Western England\\" in alternative versions of 2033. Blas y Cynfyd (A Taste of Prehistory 1958) was followed by the colonial satire Tabyrddau'r Babongo (Drums of the Babongo 1961). He thus pioneered the use of genres unfamiliar to Welsh-speaking readers, provided them with a highly readable prose often set in contemporary settings, and did much to establish the position of the novel as a major genre in Welsh-language literature. For periods he set out to live off his writing, something hardly attempted before in modern Welsh. Later works included Y Blaned Dirion (The Meek Planet 1968, another science fiction novel), Y Gromlech yn yr Haidd (The Dolmen in the Barley, 1971) and Eira Mawr (Great Snow, 1972). He also wrote a play, pamphlets, hundreds of articles and short stories as well as editing, with Gwyn Jones, Welsh Short Stories for the Oxford University Press (1956). His work has appeared in English, German, Italian and Irish translation. He was lecturer and reader at the University of Wales, Lampeter between 1975 and 1988. From his schooldays to the mid-1970s, Elis devoted a vast amount of time to politics. He ran as Plaid Cymru's candidate in Montgomeryshire in the 1959 and 1964 general elections and in a 1962 byelection. The so-called \\"Elvis Rock\\" graffito beside the A44 road in Ceredigion was originally written with the word \\"Elis\\" by two of his supporters in the 1962 by-election, and subsequently altered to read \\"Elvis\\". In retirement, he received a DLitt from the University of Wales. In 1999 a biography of Elis by T Robin Chapman, published in both Welsh and in English, appeared.

Geometric, algebraic, and arithmetic objects are assigned objects called K-groups. These are groups in the sense of abstract algebra. They contain detailed information about the original object but are notoriously difficult to compute; for example, an important outstanding problem is to compute the K-groups of the integers. K-theory was invented in the late 1950s by Alexander Grothendieck in his study of intersection theory on algebraic varieties. In the modern language, Grothendieck defined only K0, the zeroth K-group, but even this single group has plenty of applications, such as the Grothendieck‚ÄìRiemann‚ÄìRoch theorem. Intersection theory is still a motivating force in the development of (higher) algebraic K-theory through its links with motivic cohomology and specifically Chow groups. The subject also includes classical number-theoretic topics like quadratic reciprocity and embeddings of number fields into the real numbers and complex numbers, as well as more modern concerns like the construction of higher regulators and special values of L-functions. The lower K-groups were discovered first, in the sense that adequate descriptions of these groups in terms of other algebraic structures were found. For example, if F is a field, then is isomorphic to the integers Z and is closely related to the notion of vector space dimension. For a commutative ring R, the group is related to the Picard group of R, and when R is the ring of integers in a number field, this generalizes the classical construction of the class group. The group K1(R) is closely related to the group of units , and if R is a field, it is exactly the group of units. For a number field F, the group K2(F) is related to class field theory, the Hilbert symbol, and the solvability of quadratic equations over completions. In contrast, finding the correct definition of the higher K-groups of rings was a difficult achievement of Daniel Quillen, and many of the basic facts about the higher K-groups of algebraic varieties were not known until the work of Robert Thomason.  History  The history of K-theory was detailed by Charles Weibel.Weibel 1999 = The Grothendieck group K0 = In the 19th century, Bernhard Riemann and his student Gustav Roch proved what is now known as the Riemann‚ÄìRoch theorem. If X is a Riemann surface, then the sets of meromorphic functions and meromorphic differential forms on X form vector spaces. A line bundle on X determines subspaces of these vector spaces, and if X is projective, then these subspaces are finite dimensional. The Riemann‚ÄìRoch theorem states that the difference in dimensions between these subspaces is equal to the degree of the line bundle (a measure of twistedness) plus one minus the genus of X. In the mid-20th century, the Riemann‚ÄìRoch theorem was generalized by Friedrich Hirzebruch to all algebraic varieties. In Hirzebruch's formulation, the Hirzebruch‚ÄìRiemann‚ÄìRoch theorem, the theorem became a statement about Euler characteristics: The Euler characteristic of a vector bundle on an algebraic variety (which is the alternating sum of the dimensions of its cohomology groups) equals the Euler characteristic of the trivial bundle plus a correction factor coming from characteristic classes of the vector bundle. This is a generalization because on a projective Riemann surface, the Euler characteristic of a line bundle equals the difference in dimensions mentioned previously, the Euler characteristic of the trivial bundle is one minus the genus, and the only nontrivial characteristic class is the degree. The subject of K-theory takes its name from a 1957 construction of Alexander Grothendieck which appeared in the Grothendieck‚ÄìRiemann‚ÄìRoch theorem, his generalization of Hirzebruch's theorem.Grothendieck 1957, Borel‚ÄìSerre 1958 Let X be a smooth algebraic variety. To each vector bundle on X, Grothendieck associates an invariant, its class. The set of all classes on X was called K(X) from the German Klasse. By definition, K(X) is a quotient of the free abelian group on isomorphism classes of vector bundles on X, and so it is an abelian group. If the basis element corresponding to a vector bundle V is denoted [V], then for each short exact sequence of vector bundles: :0 \\\\to V' \\\\to V \\\\to V \\\\to 0, Grothendieck imposed the relation . These generators and relations define K(X), and they imply that it is the universal way to assign invariants to vector bundles in a way compatible with exact sequences. Grothendieck took the perspective that the Riemann‚ÄìRoch theorem is a statement about morphisms of varieties, not the varieties themselves. He proved that there is a homomorphism from K(X) to the Chow groups of X coming from the Chern character and Todd class of X. Additionally, he proved that a proper morphism to a smooth variety Y determines a homomorphism called the pushforward. This gives two ways of determining an element in the Chow group of Y from a vector bundle on X: Starting from X, one can first compute the pushforward in K-theory and then apply the Chern character and Todd class of Y, or one can first apply the Chern character and Todd class of X and then compute the pushforward for Chow groups. The Grothendieck‚ÄìRiemann‚ÄìRoch theorem says that these are equal. When Y is a point, a vector bundle is a vector space, the class of a vector space is its dimension, and the Grothendieck‚ÄìRiemann‚ÄìRoch theorem specializes to Hirzebruch's theorem. The group K(X) is now known as K0(X). Upon replacing vector bundles by projective modules, K0 also became defined for non-commutative rings, where it had applications to group representations. Atiyah and Hirzebruch quickly transported Grothendieck's construction to topology and used it to define topological K-theory.Atiyah‚ÄìHirzebruch 1961 Topological K-theory was one of the first examples of an extraordinary cohomology theory: It associates to each topological space X (satisfying some mild technical constraints) a sequence of groups Kn(X) which satisfy all the Eilenberg‚ÄìSteenrod axioms except the normalization axiom. The setting of algebraic varieties, however, is much more rigid, and the flexible constructions used in topology were not available. While the group K0 seemed to satisfy the necessary properties to be the beginning of a cohomology theory of algebraic varieties and of non- commutative rings, there was no clear definition of the higher Kn(X). Even as such definitions were developed, technical issues surrounding restriction and gluing usually forced Kn to be defined only for rings, not for varieties. = K0, K1, and K2 = While it was not initially known, a group related to K1 had already been introduced in another context. Henri Poincar√© had attempted to define the Betti numbers of a manifold in terms of a triangulation. His methods, however, had a serious gap: Poincar√© could not prove that two triangulations of a manifold always yielded the same Betti numbers. It was clearly true that Betti numbers were unchanged by subdividing the triangulation, and therefore it was clear that any two triangulations that shared a common subdivision had the same Betti numbers. What was not known was that any two triangulations admitted a common subdivision. This hypothesis became a conjecture known as the Hauptvermutung (roughly \\"main conjecture\\"). The fact that triangulations were stable under subdivision led J.H.C. Whitehead to introduce the notion of simple homotopy type.Whitehead 1939, Whitehead 1941, Whitehead 1950 A simple homotopy equivalence is defined in terms of adding simplices or cells to a simplicial complex or cell complex in such a way that each additional simplex or cell deformation retracts into a subdivision of the old space. Part of the motivation for this definition is that a subdivision of a triangulation is simple homotopy equivalent to the original triangulation, and therefore two triangulations that share a common subdivision must be simple homotopy equivalent. Whitehead proved that simple homotopy equivalence is a finer invariant than homotopy equivalence by introducing an invariant called the torsion. The torsion of a homotopy equivalence takes values in a group now called the Whitehead group and denoted Wh(œÄ), where œÄ is the fundamental group of the two complexes. Whitehead found examples of non-trivial torsion and thereby proved that some homotopy equivalences were not simple. The Whitehead group was later discovered to be a quotient of K1(ZœÄ), where ZœÄ is the integral group ring of œÄ. Later John Milnor used Reidemeister torsion, an invariant related to Whitehead torsion, to disprove the Hauptvermutung. The first adequate definition of K1 of a ring was made by Hyman Bass and Stephen Schanuel.Bass‚ÄìSchanuel 1962 In topological K-theory, K1 is defined using vector bundles on a suspension of the space. All such vector bundles come from the clutching construction, where two trivial vector bundles on two halves of a space are glued along a common strip of the space. This gluing data is expressed using the general linear group, but elements of that group coming from elementary matrices (matrices corresponding to elementary row or column operations) define equivalent gluings. Motivated by this, the Bass‚ÄìSchanuel definition of K1 of a ring R is , where GL(R) is the infinite general linear group (the union of all GLn(R)) and E(R) is the subgroup of elementary matrices. They also provided a definition of K0 of a homomorphism of rings and proved that K0 and K1 could be fit together into an exact sequence similar to the relative homology exact sequence. Work in K-theory from this period culminated in Bass' book Algebraic K-theory.Bass 1968 In addition to providing a coherent exposition of the results then known, Bass improved many of the statements of the theorems. Of particular note is that Bass, building on his earlier work with Murthy,Bass‚ÄìMurthy 1967 provided the first proof of what is now known as the fundamental theorem of algebraic K-theory. This is a four-term exact sequence relating K0 of a ring R to K1 of R, the polynomial ring R[t], and the localization R[t, t‚àí1]. Bass recognized that this theorem provided a description of K0 entirely in terms of K1. By applying this description recursively, he produced negative K-groups K‚àín(R). In independent work, Max Karoubi gave another definition of negative K-groups for certain categories and proved that his definitions yielded that same groups as those of Bass.Karoubi 1968 The next major development in the subject came with the definition of K2. Steinberg studied the universal central extensions of a Chevalley group over a field and gave an explicit presentation of this group in terms of generators and relations.Steinberg 1962 In the case of the group En(k) of elementary matrices, the universal central extension is now written Stn(k) and called the Steinberg group. In the spring of 1967, John Milnor defined K2(R) to be the kernel of the homomorphism .Milnor 1971 The group K2 further extended some of the exact sequences known for K1 and K0, and it had striking applications to number theory. Hideya Matsumoto's 1968 thesisMatsumoto 1969 showed that for a field F, K2(F) was isomorphic to: :F^\\\\times \\\\otimes_{\\\\mathbf{Z}} F^\\\\times / \\\\langle x \\\\otimes (1 - x) \\\\colon x \\\\in F \\\\setminus \\\\\\\\{0, 1\\\\\\\\} \\\\rangle. This relation is also satisfied by the Hilbert symbol, which expresses the solvability of quadratic equations over local fields. In particular, John Tate was able to prove that K2(Q) is essentially structured around the law of quadratic reciprocity. = Higher K-groups = In the late 1960s and early 1970s, several definitions of higher K-theory were proposed. SwanSwan 1968 and GerstenGersten 1969 both produced definitions of Kn for all n, and Gersten proved that his and Swan's theories were equivalent, but the two theories were not known to satisfy all the expected properties. Nobile and Villamayor also proposed a definition of higher K-groups.Nobile‚ÄìVillamayor 1968 Karoubi and Villamayor defined well- behaved K-groups for all n,Karoubi‚ÄìVillamayor 1971 but their equivalent of K1 was sometimes a proper quotient of the Bass‚ÄìSchanuel K1. Their K-groups are now called KVn and are related to homotopy-invariant modifications of K-theory. Inspired in part by Matsumoto's theorem, Milnor made a definition of the higher K-groups of a field.Milnor 1970 He referred to his definition as \\"purely ad hoc\\",Milnor 1970, p. 319 and it neither appeared to generalize to all rings nor did it appear to be the correct definition of the higher K-theory of fields. Much later, it was discovered by Nesterenko and SuslinNesterenko‚ÄìSuslin 1990 and by TotaroTotaro 1992 that Milnor K-theory is actually a direct summand of the true K-theory of the field. Specifically, K-groups have a filtration called the weight filtration, and the Milnor K-theory of a field is the highest weight-graded piece of the K-theory. Additionally, Thomason discovered that there is no analog of Milnor K-theory for a general variety.Thomason 1992 The first definition of higher K-theory to be widely accepted was Daniel Quillen's.Quillen 1971 As part of Quillen's work on the Adams conjecture in topology, he had constructed maps from the classifying spaces BGL(Fq) to the homotopy fiber of , where œàq is the qth Adams operation acting on the classifying space BU. This map is acyclic, and after modifying BGL(Fq) slightly to produce a new space BGL(Fq)+, the map became a homotopy equivalence. This modification was called the plus construction. The Adams operations had been known to be related to Chern classes and to K-theory since the work of Grothendieck, and so Quillen was led to define the K-theory of R as the homotopy groups of BGL(R)+. Not only did this recover K1 and K2, the relation of K-theory to the Adams operations allowed Quillen to compute the K-groups of finite fields. The classifying space BGL is connected, so Quillen's definition failed to give the correct value for K0. Additionally, it did not give any negative K-groups. Since K0 had a known and accepted definition it was possible to sidestep this difficulty, but it remained technically awkward. Conceptually, the problem was that the definition sprung from GL, which was classically the source of K1. Because GL knows only about gluing vector bundles, not about the vector bundles themselves, it was impossible for it to describe K0. Inspired by conversations with Quillen, Segal soon introduced another approach to constructing algebraic K-theory under the name of Œì-objects.Segal 1974 Segal's approach is a homotopy analog of Grothendieck's construction of K0. Where Grothendieck worked with isomorphism classes of bundles, Segal worked with the bundles themselves and used isomorphisms of the bundles as part of his data. This results in a spectrum whose homotopy groups are the higher K-groups (including K0). However, Segal's approach was only able to impose relations for split exact sequences, not general exact sequences. In the category of projective modules over a ring, every short exact sequence splits, and so Œì-objects could be used to define the K-theory of a ring. However, there are non-split short exact sequences in the category of vector bundles on a variety and in the category of all modules over a ring, so Segal's approach did not apply to all cases of interest. In the spring of 1972, Quillen found another approach to the construction of higher K-theory which was to prove enormously successful. This new definition began with an exact category, a category satisfying certain formal properties similar to, but slightly weaker than, the properties satisfied by a category of modules or vector bundles. From this he constructed an auxiliary category using a new device called his \\"Q-construction.\\" Like Segal's Œì-objects, the Q-construction has its roots in Grothendieck's definition of K0. Unlike Grothendieck's definition, however, the Q-construction builds a category, not an abelian group, and unlike Segal's Œì-objects, the Q-construction works directly with short exact sequences. If C is an abelian category, then QC is a category with the same objects as C but whose morphisms are defined in terms of short exact sequences in C. The K-groups of the exact category are the homotopy groups of Œ©BQC, the loop space of the geometric realization (taking the loop space corrects the indexing). Quillen additionally proved his \\" theorem\\" that his two definitions of K-theory agreed with each other. This yielded the correct K0 and led to simpler proofs, but still did not yield any negative K-groups. All abelian categories are exact categories, but not all exact categories are abelian. Because Quillen was able to work in this more general situation, he was able to use exact categories as tools in his proofs. This technique allowed him to prove many of the basic theorems of algebraic K-theory. Additionally, it was possible to prove that the earlier definitions of Swan and Gersten were equivalent to Quillen's under certain conditions. K-theory now appeared to be a homology theory for rings and a cohomology theory for varieties. However, many of its basic theorems carried the hypothesis that the ring or variety in question was regular. One of the basic expected relations was a long exact sequence (called the \\"localization sequence\\") relating the K-theory of a variety X and an open subset U. Quillen was unable to prove the existence of the localization sequence in full generality. He was, however, able to prove its existence for a related theory called G-theory (or sometimes K‚Ä≤-theory). G-theory had been defined early in the development of the subject by Grothendieck. Grothendieck defined G0(X) for a variety X to be the free abelian group on isomorphism classes of coherent sheaves on X, modulo relations coming from exact sequences of coherent sheaves. In the categorical framework adopted by later authors, the K-theory of a variety is the K-theory of its category of vector bundles, while its G-theory is the K-theory of its category of coherent sheaves. Not only could Quillen prove the existence of a localization exact sequence for G-theory, he could prove that for a regular ring or variety, K-theory equaled G-theory, and therefore K-theory of regular varieties had a localization exact sequence. Since this sequence was fundamental to many of the facts in the subject, regularity hypotheses pervaded early work on higher K-theory. = Applications of algebraic K-theory in topology = The earliest application of algebraic K-theory to topology was Whitehead's construction of Whitehead torsion. A closely related construction was found by C. T. C. Wall in 1963.Wall 1965 Wall found that a space œÄ dominated by a finite complex has a generalized Euler characteristic taking values in a quotient of K0(ZœÄ), where œÄ is the fundamental group of the space. This invariant is called Wall's finiteness obstruction because X is homotopy equivalent to a finite complex if and only if the invariant vanishes. Laurent Siebenmann in his thesis found an invariant similar to Wall's that gives an obstruction to an open manifold being the interior of a compact manifold with boundary.Siebenmann 1965 If two manifolds with boundary M and N have isomorphic interiors (in TOP, PL, or DIFF as appropriate), then the isomorphism between them defines an h-cobordism between M and N. Whitehead torsion was eventually reinterpreted in a more directly K-theoretic way. This reinterpretation happened through the study of h-cobordisms. Two n-dimensional manifolds M and N are h-cobordant if there exists an -dimensional manifold with boundary W whose boundary is the disjoint union of M and N and for which the inclusions of M and N into W are homotopy equivalences (in the categories TOP, PL, or DIFF). Stephen Smale's h-cobordism theoremSmale 1962 asserted that if , W is compact, and M, N, and W are simply connected, then W is isomorphic to the cylinder (in TOP, PL, or DIFF as appropriate). This theorem proved the Poincar√© conjecture for . If M and N are not assumed to be simply connected, then an h-cobordism need not be a cylinder. The s-cobordism theorem, due independently to Mazur,Mazur 1963 Stallings, and Barden,Barden 1963 explains the general situation: An h-cobordism is a cylinder if and only if the Whitehead torsion of the inclusion vanishes. This generalizes the h-cobordism theorem because the simple connectedness hypotheses imply that the relevant Whitehead group is trivial. In fact the s-cobordism theorem implies that there is a bijective correspondence between isomorphism classes of h-cobordisms and elements of the Whitehead group. An obvious question associated with the existence of h-cobordisms is their uniqueness. The natural notion of equivalence is isotopy. Jean Cerf proved that for simply connected smooth manifolds M of dimension at least 5, isotopy of h-cobordisms is the same as a weaker notion called pseudo-isotopy.Cerf 1970 Hatcher and Wagoner studied the components of the space of pseudo-isotopies and related it to a quotient of K2(ZœÄ).Hatcher and Wagoner 1973 The proper context for the s-cobordism theorem is the classifying space of h-cobordisms. If M is a CAT manifold, then HCAT(M) is a space that classifies bundles of h-cobordisms on M. The s-cobordism theorem can be reinterpreted as the statement that the set of connected components of this space is the Whitehead group of œÄ1(M). This space contains strictly more information than the Whitehead group; for example, the connected component of the trivial cobordism describes the possible cylinders on M and in particular is the obstruction to the uniqueness of a homotopy between a manifold and . Consideration of these questions led Waldhausen to introduce his algebraic K-theory of spaces.Waldhausen 1978 The algebraic K-theory of M is a space A(M) which is defined so that it plays essentially the same role for higher K-groups as K1(ZœÄ1(M)) does for M. In particular, Waldhausen showed that there is a map from A(M) to a space Wh(M) which generalizes the map and whose homotopy fiber is a homology theory. In order to fully develop A-theory, Waldhausen made significant technical advances in the foundations of K-theory. Waldhausen introduced Waldhausen categories, and for a Waldhausen category C he introduced a simplicial category S*C (the S is for Segal) defined in terms of chains of cofibrations in C.Waldhausen 1985 This freed the foundations of K-theory from the need to invoke analogs of exact sequences. = Algebraic topology and algebraic geometry in algebraic K-theory = Quillen suggested to his student Kenneth Brown that it might be possible to create a theory of sheaves of spectra of which K-theory would provide an example. The sheaf of K-theory spectra would, to each open subset of a variety, associate the K-theory of that open subset. Brown developed such a theory for his thesis. Simultaneously, Gersten had the same idea. At a Seattle conference in autumn of 1972, they together discovered a spectral sequence converging from the sheaf cohomology of \\\\mathcal K_n, the sheaf of Kn-groups on X, to the K-group of the total space. This is now called the Brown‚ÄìGersten spectral sequence.Brown‚ÄìGersten 1973 Spencer Bloch, influenced by Gersten's work on sheaves of K-groups, proved that on a regular surface, the cohomology group H^2(X, \\\\mathcal K_2) is isomorphic to the Chow group CH2(X) of codimension 2 cycles on X.Bloch 1974 Inspired by this, Gersten conjectured that for a regular local ring R with fraction field F, Kn(R) injects into Kn(F) for all n. Soon Quillen proved that this is true when R contains a field,Quillen 1973 and using this he proved that :H^p(X, \\\\mathcal K_p) \\\\cong \\\\operatorname{CH}^p(X) for all p. This is known as Bloch's formula. While progress has been made on Gersten's conjecture since then, the general case remains open. Lichtenbaum conjectured that special values of the zeta function of a number field could be expressed in terms of the K-groups of the ring of integers of the field. These special values were known to be related to the √©tale cohomology of the ring of integers. Quillen therefore generalized Lichtenbaum's conjecture, predicting the existence of a spectral sequence like the Atiyah‚ÄìHirzebruch spectral sequence in topological K-theory.Quillen 1975 Quillen's proposed spectral sequence would start from the √©tale cohomology of a ring R and, in high enough degrees and after completing at a prime invertible in R, abut to the -adic completion of the K-theory of R. In the case studied by Lichtenbaum, the spectral sequence would degenerate, yielding Lichtenbaum's conjecture. The necessity of localizing at a prime suggested to Browder that there should be a variant of K-theory with finite coefficients.Browder 1976 He introduced K-theory groups Kn(R; Z/Z) which were Z/Z-vector spaces, and he found an analog of the Bott element in topological K-theory. Soule used this theory to construct \\"√©tale Chern classes\\", an analog of topological Chern classes which took elements of algebraic K-theory to classes in √©tale cohomology.Soul√© 1979 Unlike algebraic K-theory, √©tale cohomology is highly computable, so √©tale Chern classes provided an effective tool for detecting the existence of elements in K-theory. William G. Dwyer and Eric Friedlander then invented an analog of K-theory for the √©tale topology called √©tale K-theory.Dwyer‚ÄìFriedlander 1982 For varieties defined over the complex numbers, √©tale K-theory is isomorphic to topological K-theory. Moreover, √©tale K-theory admitted a spectral sequence similar to the one conjectured by Quillen. Thomason proved around 1980 that after inverting the Bott element, algebraic K-theory with finite coefficients became isomorphic to √©tale K-theory.Thomason 1985 Throughout the 1970s and early 1980s, K-theory on singular varieties still lacked adequate foundations. While it was believed that Quillen's K-theory gave the correct groups, it was not known that these groups had all of the envisaged properties. For this, algebraic K-theory had to be reformulated. This was done by Thomason in a lengthy monograph which he co-credited to his dead friend Thomas Trobaugh, who he said gave him a key idea in a dream.Thomason and Trobaugh 1990 Thomason combined Waldhausen's construction of K-theory with the foundations of intersection theory described in volume six of Grothendieck's S√©minaire de G√©om√©trie Alg√©brique du Bois Marie. There, K0 was described in terms of complexes of sheaves on algebraic varieties. Thomason discovered that if one worked with in derived category of sheaves, there was a simple description of when a complex of sheaves could be extended from an open subset of a variety to the whole variety. By applying Waldhausen's construction of K-theory to derived categories, Thomason was able to prove that algebraic K-theory had all the expected properties of a cohomology theory. In 1976, Keith Dennis discovered an entirely novel technique for computing K-theory based on Hochschild homology.Dennis 1976 This was based around the existence of the Dennis trace map, a homomorphism from K-theory to Hochschild homology. While the Dennis trace map seemed to be successful for calculations of K-theory with finite coefficients, it was less successful for rational calculations. Goodwillie, motivated by his \\"calculus of functors\\", conjectured the existence of a theory intermediate to K-theory and Hochschild homology. He called this theory topological Hochschild homology because its ground ring should be the sphere spectrum (considered as a ring whose operations are defined only up to homotopy). In the mid-1980s, Bokstedt gave a definition of topological Hochschild homology that satisfied nearly all of Goodwillie's conjectural properties, and this made possible further computations of K-groups.Bokstedt 1986 Bokstedt's version of the Dennis trace map was a transformation of spectra . This transformation factored through the fixed points of a circle action on THH, which suggested a relationship with cyclic homology. In the course of proving an algebraic K-theory analog of the Novikov conjecture, Bokstedt, Hsiang, and Madsen introduced topological cyclic homology, which bore the same relationship to topological Hochschild homology as cyclic homology did to Hochschild homology.Bokstedt‚ÄìHsiang‚ÄìMadsen 1993 The Dennis trace map to topological Hochschild homology facts through topological cyclic homology, providing an even more detailed tool for calculations. In 1996, Dundas, Goodwillie, and McCarthy proved that topological cyclic homology has in a precise sense the same local structure as algebraic K-theory, so that if a calculation in K-theory or topological cyclic homology is possible, then many other \\"nearby\\" calculations follow.Dundas‚ÄìGoodwillie‚ÄìMcCarthy 2012  Lower K-groups  The lower K-groups were discovered first, and given various ad hoc descriptions, which remain useful. Throughout, let A be a ring. = K0 = The functor K0 takes a ring A to the Grothendieck group of the set of isomorphism classes of its finitely generated projective modules, regarded as a monoid under direct sum. Any ring homomorphism A ‚Üí B gives a map K0(A) ‚Üí K0(B) by mapping (the class of) a projective A-module M to M ‚äóA B, making K0 a covariant functor. If the ring A is commutative, we can define a subgroup of K0(A) as the set : \\\\tilde{K}_0\\\\left(A\\\\right) = \\\\bigcap\\\\limits_{\\\\mathfrak p\\\\text{ prime ideal of }A}\\\\mathrm{Ker}\\\\dim_{\\\\mathfrak p}, where : :\\\\dim_{\\\\mathfrak p}:K_0\\\\left(A\\\\right)\\\\to \\\\mathbf{Z} is the map sending every (class of a) finitely generated projective A-module M to the rank of the free A_{\\\\mathfrak p}-module M_{\\\\mathfrak p} (this module is indeed free, as any finitely generated projective module over a local ring is free). This subgroup \\\\tilde{K}_0\\\\left(A\\\\right) is known as the reduced zeroth K-theory of A. If B is a ring without an identity element, we can extend the definition of K0 as follows. Let A = B‚äïZ be the extension of B to a ring with unity obtaining by adjoining an identity element (0,1). There is a short exact sequence B ‚Üí A ‚Üí Z and we define K0(B) to be the kernel of the corresponding map K0(A) ‚Üí K0(Z) = Z.Rosenberg (1994) p.30 Examples * (Projective) modules over a field k are vector spaces and K0(k) is isomorphic to Z, by dimension. * Finitely generated projective modules over a local ring A are free and so in this case once again K0(A) is isomorphic to Z, by rank.Milnor (1971) p.5 * For A a Dedekind domain, :K0(A) = Pic(A) ‚äï Z, where Pic(A) is the Picard group of A,Milnor (1971) p.14 and similarly the reduced K-theory is given by :\\\\tilde K_0(A)=\\\\operatorname{Pic} A. An algebro-geometric variant of this construction is applied to the category of algebraic varieties; it associates with a given algebraic variety X the Grothendieck's K-group of the category of locally free sheaves (or coherent sheaves) on X. Given a compact topological space X, the topological K-theory Ktop(X) of (real) vector bundles over X coincides with K0 of the ring of continuous real-valued functions on X., see Theorem I.6.18 Relative K0 Let I be an ideal of A and define the \\"double\\" to be a subring of the Cartesian product A√óA:Rosenberg (1994) 1.5.1, p.27 :D(A,I) = \\\\\\\\{ (x,y) \\\\in A \\\\times A : x-y \\\\in I \\\\\\\\} \\\\ . The relative K-group is defined in terms of the \\"double\\"Rosenberg (1994) 1.5.3, p.27 :K_0(A,I) = \\\\ker \\\\left({ K_0(D(A,I)) \\\\rightarrow K_0(A) }\\\\right) \\\\ . where the map is induced by projection along the first factor. The relative K0(A,I) is isomorphic to K0(I), regarding I as a ring without identity. The independence from A is an analogue of the Excision theorem in homology. K0 as a ring If A is a commutative ring, then the tensor product of projective modules is again projective, and so tensor product induces a multiplication turning K0 into a commutative ring with the class [A] as identity. The exterior product similarly induces a Œª-ring structure. The Picard group embeds as a subgroup of the group of units K0(A)‚àó.Milnor (1971) p.15 = K1 = Hyman Bass provided this definition, which generalizes the group of units of a ring: K1(A) is the abelianization of the infinite general linear group: :K_1(A) = \\\\operatorname{GL}(A)^{\\\\mbox{ab}} = \\\\operatorname{GL}(A) / [\\\\operatorname{GL}(A),\\\\operatorname{GL}(A)] Here :\\\\operatorname{GL}(A) = \\\\operatorname{colim} \\\\operatorname{GL}(n, A) is the direct limit of the GL(n), which embeds in GL(n + 1) as the upper left block matrix, and [\\\\operatorname{GL}(A), \\\\operatorname{GL}(A)] is its commutator subgroup. Define an elementary matrix to be one which is the sum of an identity matrix and a single off-diagonal element (this is a subset of the elementary matrices used in linear algebra). Then Whitehead's lemma states that the group E(A) generated by elementary matrices equals the commutator subgroup [GL(A), GL(A)]. Indeed, the group GL(A)/E(A) was first defined and studied by Whitehead,J.H.C. Whitehead, Simple homotopy types Amer. J. Math. , 72 (1950) pp. 1‚Äì57 and is called the Whitehead group of the ring A.  Relative K1  The relative K-group is defined in terms of the \\"double\\"Rosenberg (1994) 2.5.1, p.92 :K_1(A,I) = \\\\ker \\\\left({ K_1(D(A,I)) \\\\rightarrow K_1(A) }\\\\right) \\\\ . There is a natural exact sequenceRosenberg (1994) 2.5.4, p.95 : K_1(A,I) \\\\rightarrow K_1(A) \\\\rightarrow K_1(A/I) \\\\rightarrow K_0(A,I) \\\\rightarrow K_0(A) \\\\rightarrow K_0(A/I) \\\\ .  Commutative rings and fields  For A a commutative ring, one can define a determinant det: GL(A) ‚Üí A* to the group of units of A, which vanishes on E(A) and thus descends to a map det : K1(A) ‚Üí A*. As E(A) ‚óÖ SL(A), one can also define the special Whitehead group SK1(A) := SL(A)/E(A). This map splits via the map A* ‚Üí GL(1, A) ‚Üí K1(A) (unit in the upper left corner), and hence is onto, and has the special Whitehead group as kernel, yielding the split short exact sequence: :1 \\\\to SK_1(A) \\\\to K_1(A) \\\\to A^* \\\\to 1, which is a quotient of the usual split short exact sequence defining the special linear group, namely :1 \\\\to \\\\operatorname{SL}(A) \\\\to \\\\operatorname{GL}(A) \\\\to A^* \\\\to 1. The determinant is split by including the group of units A* = GL1(A) into the general linear group GL(A), so K1(A) splits as the direct sum of the group of units and the special Whitehead group: K1(A) ‚âÖ A* ‚äï SK1 (A). When A is a Euclidean domain (e.g. a field, or the integers) SK1(A) vanishes, and the determinant map is an isomorphism from K1(A) to A‚àó.Rosenberg (1994) Theorem 2.3.2, p.74 This is false in general for PIDs, thus providing one of the rare mathematical features of Euclidean domains that do not generalize to all PIDs. An explicit PID such that SK1 is nonzero was given by Ischebeck in 1980 and by Grayson in 1981.Rosenberg (1994) p.75 If A is a Dedekind domain whose quotient field is an algebraic number field (a finite extension of the rationals) then shows that SK1(A) vanishes.Rosenberg (1994) p.81 The vanishing of SK1 can be interpreted as saying that K1 is generated by the image of GL1 in GL. When this fails, one can ask whether K1 is generated by the image of GL2. For a Dedekind domain, this is the case: indeed, K1 is generated by the images of GL1 and SL2 in GL. The subgroup of SK1 generated by SL2 may be studied by Mennicke symbols. For Dedekind domains with all quotients by maximal ideals finite, SK1 is a torsion group.Rosenberg (1994) p.78 For a non-commutative ring, the determinant cannot in general be defined, but the map GL(A) ‚Üí K1(A) is a generalisation of the determinant. Central simple algebras In the case of a central simple algebra A over a field F, the reduced norm provides a generalisation of the determinant giving a map K1(A) ‚Üí F‚àó and SK1(A) may be defined as the kernel. Wang's theorem states that if A has prime degree then SK1(A) is trivial,Gille & Szamuely (2006) p.47 and this may be extended to square-free degree.Gille & Szamuely (2006) p.48 Wang also showed that SK1(A) is trivial for any central simple algebra over a number field, but Platonov has given examples of algebras of degree prime squared for which SK1(A) is non-trivial. = K2 = John Milnor found the right definition of K2: it is the center of the Steinberg group St(A) of A. It can also be defined as the kernel of the map :\\\\varphi\\\\colon\\\\operatorname{St}(A)\\\\to\\\\mathrm{GL}(A), or as the Schur multiplier of the group of elementary matrices. For a field, K2 is determined by Steinberg symbols: this leads to Matsumoto's theorem. One can compute that K2 is zero for any finite field.Lam (2005) p.139Lemmermeyer (2000) p.66 The computation of K2(Q) is complicated: Tate provedMilnor (1971) p.101 :K_2(\\\\mathbf{Q}) = (\\\\mathbf{Z}/4)^* \\\\times \\\\prod_{p \\\\text{ odd prime}} (\\\\mathbf{Z}/p)^* \\\\ and remarked that the proof followed Gauss's first proof of the Law of Quadratic Reciprocity.Milnor (1971) p.102Gras (2003) p.205 For non-Archimedean local fields, the group K2(F) is the direct sum of a finite cyclic group of order m, say, and a divisible group K2(F)m.Milnor (1971) p.175 We have K2(Z) = Z/2,Milnor (1971) p.81 and in general K2 is finite for the ring of integers of a number field.Lemmermeyer (2000) p.385 We further have K2(Z/n) = Z/2 if n is divisible by 4, and otherwise zero.Silvester (1981) p.228 Matsumoto's theorem Matsumoto's theorem states that for a field k, the second K-group is given byRosenberg (1994) Theorem 4.3.15, p.214 :K_2(k) = k^\\\\times\\\\otimes_{\\\\mathbf Z} k^\\\\times/\\\\langle a\\\\otimes(1-a)\\\\mid a ot=0,1\\\\rangle. Matsumoto's original theorem is even more general: For any root system, it gives a presentation for the unstable K-theory. This presentation is different from the one given here only for symplectic root systems. For non-symplectic root systems, the unstable second K-group with respect to the root system is exactly the stable K-group for GL(A). Unstable second K-groups (in this context) are defined by taking the kernel of the universal central extension of the Chevalley group of universal type for a given root system. This construction yields the kernel of the Steinberg extension for the root systems An (n > 1) and, in the limit, stable second K-groups. Long exact sequences If A is a Dedekind domain with field of fractions F then there is a long exact sequence : K_2F \\\\rightarrow \\\\oplus_{\\\\mathbf p} K_1 A/{\\\\mathbf p} \\\\rightarrow K_1 A \\\\rightarrow K_1 F \\\\rightarrow \\\\oplus_{\\\\mathbf p} K_0 A/{\\\\mathbf p} \\\\rightarrow K_0 A \\\\rightarrow K_0 F \\\\rightarrow 0 \\\\ where p runs over all prime ideals of A.Milnor (1971) p.123 There is also an extension of the exact sequence for relative K1 and K0:Rosenberg (1994) p.200 :K_2(A) \\\\rightarrow K_2(A/I) \\\\rightarrow K_1(A,I) \\\\rightarrow K_1(A) \\\\cdots \\\\ . Pairing There is a pairing on K1 with values in K2. Given commuting matrices X and Y over A, take elements x and y in the Steinberg group with X,Y as images. The commutator x y x^{-1} y^{-1} is an element of K2.Milnor (1971) p.63 The map is not always surjective.Milnor (1971) p.69  Milnor K-theory  The above expression for K2 of a field k led Milnor to the following definition of \\"higher\\" K-groups by : K^M_*(k) := T^*(k^\\\\times)/(a\\\\otimes (1-a)), thus as graded parts of a quotient of the tensor algebra of the multiplicative group k√ó by the two-sided ideal, generated by the :\\\\left \\\\\\\\{a\\\\otimes(1-a): \\\\ a eq 0,1 \\\\right \\\\\\\\}. For n = 0,1,2 these coincide with those below, but for n ‚âß 3 they differ in general., cf. Lemma 1.8 For example, we have K'(Fq) = 0 for n ‚âß 2 but KnFq is nonzero for odd n (see below). The tensor product on the tensor algebra induces a product K_m \\\\times K_n \\\\rightarrow K_{m+n} making K^M_*(F) a graded ring which is graded-commutative.Gille & Szamuely (2006) p.184 The images of elements a_1 \\\\otimes \\\\cdots \\\\otimes a_n in K^M_n(k) are termed symbols, denoted \\\\\\\\{a_1,\\\\ldots,a_n\\\\\\\\}. For integer m invertible in k there is a map :\\\\partial : k^* \\\\rightarrow H^1(k,\\\\mu_m) where \\\\mu_m denotes the group of m-th roots of unity in some separable extension of k. This extends to :\\\\partial^n : k^* \\\\times \\\\cdots \\\\times k^* \\\\rightarrow H^n\\\\left({k,\\\\mu_m^{\\\\otimes n}}\\\\right) \\\\ satisfying the defining relations of the Milnor K-group. Hence \\\\partial^n may be regarded as a map on K^M_n(k), called the Galois symbol map.Gille & Szamuely (2006) p.108 The relation between √©tale (or Galois) cohomology of the field and Milnor K-theory modulo 2 is the Milnor conjecture, proven by Vladimir Voevodsky. The analogous statement for odd primes is the Bloch-Kato conjecture, proved by Voevodsky, Rost, and others.  Higher K-theory  The accepted definitions of higher K-groups were given by , after a few years during which several incompatible definitions were suggested. The object of the program was to find definitions of K(R) and K(R,I) in terms of classifying spaces so that R ‚áí K(R) and (R,I) ‚áí K(R,I) are functors into a homotopy category of spaces and the long exact sequence for relative K-groups arises as the long exact homotopy sequence of a fibration K(R,I) ‚Üí K(R) ‚Üí K(R/I).Rosenberg (1994) pp. 245‚Äì246 Quillen gave two constructions, the \\"plus-construction\\" and the \\"Q-construction\\", the latter subsequently modified in different ways.Rosenberg (1994) p.246 The two constructions yield the same K-groups.Rosenberg (1994) p.289 = The +-construction = One possible definition of higher algebraic K-theory of rings was given by Quillen : K_n(R) = \\\\pi_n(B\\\\operatorname{GL}(R)^+), Here œÄn is a homotopy group, GL(R) is the direct limit of the general linear groups over R for the size of the matrix tending to infinity, B is the classifying space construction of homotopy theory, and the + is Quillen's plus construction. This definition only holds for n > 0 so one often defines the higher algebraic K-theory via : K_n(R) = \\\\pi_n(B\\\\operatorname{GL}(R)^+\\\\times K_0(R)) Since BGL(R)+ is path connected and K0(R) discrete, this definition doesn't differ in higher degrees and also holds for n = 0\\\\. = The Q-construction = The Q-construction gives the same results as the +-construction, but it applies in more general situations. Moreover, the definition is more direct in the sense that the K-groups, defined via the Q-construction are functorial by definition. This fact is not automatic in the plus-construction. Suppose P is an exact category; associated to P a new category QP is defined, objects of which are those of P and morphisms from M‚Ä≤ to M‚Ä≥ are isomorphism classes of diagrams : M'\\\\longleftarrow N\\\\longrightarrow M, where the first arrow is an admissible epimorphism and the second arrow is an admissible monomorphism. The i-th K-group of the exact category P is then defined as : K_i(P)=\\\\pi_{i+1}(\\\\mathrm{BQ}P,0) with a fixed zero-object 0, where BQP is the classifying space of QP, which is defined to be the geometric realisation of the nerve of QP. This definition coincides with the above definition of K0(P). If P is the category of finitely generated projective R-modules, this definition agrees with the above BGL+ definition of Kn(R) for all n. More generally, for a scheme X, the higher K-groups of X are defined to be the K-groups of (the exact category of) locally free coherent sheaves on X. The following variant of this is also used: instead of finitely generated projective (= locally free) modules, take finitely generated modules. The resulting K-groups are usually written Gn(R). When R is a noetherian regular ring, then G- and K-theory coincide. Indeed, the global dimension of regular rings is finite, i.e. any finitely generated module has a finite projective resolution P* ‚Üí M, and a simple argument shows that the canonical map K0(R) ‚Üí G0(R) is an isomorphism, with [M]=Œ£ ¬± [Pn]. This isomorphism extends to the higher K-groups, too. = The S-construction = A third construction of K-theory groups is the S-construction, due to Waldhausen.. See also Lecture IV and the references in It applies to categories with cofibrations (also called Waldhausen categories). This is a more general concept than exact categories.  Examples  While the Quillen algebraic K-theory has provided deep insight into various aspects of algebraic geometry and topology, the K-groups have proved particularly difficult to compute except in a few isolated but interesting cases. (See also: K-groups of a field.) = Algebraic K-groups of finite fields = The first and one of the most important calculations of the higher algebraic K-groups of a ring were made by Quillen himself for the case of finite fields: If Fq is the finite field with q elements, then: * K0(Fq) = Z, * K2i(Fq) = 0 for i ‚â•1, * K2i‚Äì1(Fq) = Z/(q i ‚àí 1)Z for i ‚â• 1\\\\. reproved Quillen's computation using different methods. = Algebraic K-groups of rings of integers = Quillen proved that if A is the ring of algebraic integers in an algebraic number field F (a finite extension of the rationals), then the algebraic K-groups of A are finitely generated. Armand Borel used this to calculate Ki(A) and Ki(F) modulo torsion. For example, for the integers Z, Borel proved that (modulo torsion) * Ki (Z)/tors.=0 for positive i unless i=4k+1 with k positive * K4k+1 (Z)/tors.= Z for positive k. The torsion subgroups of K2i+1(Z), and the orders of the finite groups K4k+2(Z) have recently been determined, but whether the latter groups are cyclic, and whether the groups K4k(Z) vanish depends upon Vandiver's conjecture about the class groups of cyclotomic integers. See Quillen‚ÄìLichtenbaum conjecture for more details.  Applications and open questions  Algebraic K-groups are used in conjectures on special values of L-functions and the formulation of a non-commutative main conjecture of Iwasawa theory and in construction of higher regulators.Lemmermeyer (2000) p.385 Parshin's conjecture concerns the higher algebraic K-groups for smooth varieties over finite fields, and states that in this case the groups vanish up to torsion. Another fundamental conjecture due to Hyman Bass (Bass' conjecture) says that all of the groups Gn(A) are finitely generated when A is a finitely generated Z-algebra. (The groups Gn(A) are the K-groups of the category of finitely generated A-modules) , Lecture VI  See also  *Bloch's formula *Fundamental theorem of algebraic K-theory *Basic theorems in algebraic K-theory *K-theory *K-theory of a category *K-group of a field *K-theory spectrum *Redshift conjecture *Topological K-theory *Rigidity (K-theory) Notes  References    (lower K-groups) (Quillen's Q-construction) * (relation of Q-construction to plus-construction) *.

It is a Latin word, first coined in the third century AD, meaning \\"Roman-ness\\" and has been used by modern historians as shorthand to refer to Roman identity and self-image. Literal meaning and origin Romanitas means, as a rough approximation, Roman-ness in Latin, although it has also been translated as \\"Romanism, the Roman way or manner\\". The term, not common in Roman sources, was first coined by the 3rd century Roman writer Tertullian, an early Christian from North Africa, in his work De Pallio. Tertullian used the term pejoratively to refer to those in his native Carthage who aped Roman culture. Concepts behind literal meaning Romanitas is used to refer to the collection of political and cultural concepts and practices defining what it is to be a Roman. Unlike the Greeks, the Romans did not see their common identity as being based on language and inherited ethnicity. Their identity was based on being part of a political and religious community with common values, customs, morality and way of life. That made historians seek to define romanitas using a number of approaches: one way is to consider the general ideals Romans attributed to themselves; another approach, which has achieved consensus among scholars, is to consider the construction of Roman identity during the process of colonisation. However, not all scholars accept that the notion of identity, which is inherited from social sciences, is adequate to understand what is to be Roman.SILVA, A. J. M. 2012, From lost Roman pottery to broken identities in Post-modern times: on the use of the concept of identity in Roman Archaeology, 28th Congress of the Rei Cretariae Romanae Fautores, Catania. https://www.academia.edu/1994803/From_lost_Roman_pottery_to_broken_identities_in_Post- modern_times_on_the_use_of_the_concept_of_identity_in_Roman_Archaeology It was not a word often used in ancient times, but it is used by modern writers to express the ideals which inspired the Roman State. It meant a great many things, but in short it meant what it was to be Roman (that is, Roman-ness). The Roman ideal was the citizen/soldier/farmer. The farmer was a hard working, frugal, practical man who worked the land with his own hands. The soldier was a courageous, strong man who obeyed orders and risked his own life in the name of Rome. Prior to the formation, under Gaius Marius, of the standing Roman Army, Rome had a militia-type defence-force which could be called up in time of war and then disbanded during peacetime. The ideal of the homo militaris ‚Äì embodying the functions of the citizen, soldier and farmer ‚Äì was Lucius Quinctius Cincinnatus. According to Roman legend, Cincinnatus was tending his farm when a messenger arrived, telling him that Rome was under attack and that he had been elected dictator. He was at first reluctant to go, but the Senate pleaded with him. He defeated the enemy tribe within a matter of weeks and, despite there remaining most of his six-month term as dictator with absolute power, returned to his farm. The attainment and possession of the virtue of gravitas was highly valued by Romans of the early Republic and by Roman intellectuals. Indeed, gravitas was the single most clarifying characteristic of early republican Roman society: The virtuous character of the Romans, their honesty and trustworthiness, is shown in the way they handled their finances. Polybius remarks: \\"Greek statesmen, if entrusted with a single talent, though protected by ten checking-clerks, as many seals and twice as many witnesses, yet cannot be induced to keep faith; whereas among the Romans, in their magistracies and embassies, men have the handling of a great amount of money, and yet from pure respect for their oath keep their faith intact.\\" Their cultural characteristics led to their development of \\"self government\\" by adopting a classical republic and thus this class formed the backbone of the Roman Republic. Because of the widespread influence of Roman classical literature, the idea of the homo militaris also took root in colonial and early United States.

Ariel was first established in 1978 and its population was in , composed of veteran and young Israelis, English- speaking immigrants, and immigrants from the Former Soviet Union, with an additional influx of 10,000 students.Ariel municipality Official website It is the fourth largest Jewish settlement in the West Bank, after Modi'in Illit, Beitar Illit, and Ma'ale Adumim. The international community considers Israeli settlements in the West Bank illegal under international law, but the Israeli government disputes this. Ariel's jurisdiction spans , and borders the Palestinian towns and villages Salfit, Marda and Iskaka. According to B'Tselem, within Ariel's municipal area there are several enclaves of privately owned Palestinian land, whose owners are not allowed access to them. Etymology Ariel (pronounced Ari'el), literally means 'Lion of God'. \\"Ari\\" (Lion) in Hebrew is also a synonym for bravery and courage and it is also the symbol of the tribe of Judah. The city of Ariel is named after Jerusalem.Ariel Founder details Ariel's history Ariel in the Hebrew Bible is one of the names for Jerusalem and the Temple of Jerusalem (Isaiah 29:1‚Äì8). History Ariel was founded in 1978 on land that was seized for military needs and on land that was declared state land, including cultivated farmland of Palestinian villages in the district and on rocky land the villagers used for grazing their flocks. At the beginning of 1978, a group of Israelis formed in order to create a settlement in the hills of the northern part of the West Bank made a formal request to the government to be given land to build a new community and were given three options by the army; the area near the 'lone tree' which would later become Barkan, the area which would later become Kfar Tapuach, and a hill near Kifl Hares that was known to the local Arabs as 'Jabel Mawat', the hill of death, because of inhospitable terrain. The leader of this group, Ron Nachman, chose the latter because of its strategic location on a possible Jordanian invasion route towards Israel's main population centre of Tel Aviv. In the spring of 1978, some of the group's men erected tents on the chosen hilltop, and in August 1978, a total of forty families came to live in the settlement. The original members of the group had gone through a screening process in order to put together a mix of skilled adults as well as young families that would be prepared psychologically to withstand starting a new settlement from scratch with little infrastructure and modern comforts. There were no paved roads or paths. Water was supplied periodically by a tanker truck. Electricity was provided by a generator since no electrical network existed in that area. Tents were replaced by prefabricated concrete blocks which served as living quarters, schools, and an infirmary. On September 1, 1978, the school year was officially opened. From 1978 to 1988, Ariel continued to develop, and established itself as the urban center for the nearby Jewish settlements. In 1980, the prefabricated homes were replaced with permanent housing. The College of Judea and Samaria, which would later become the Ariel University Center of Samaria, and eventually Ariel University, was founded in 1982. Three elementary schools, a community center, a sports hall, and a synagogue were built. In May 1982, Ariel was connected to the national power grid. During the mass immigration of Jews from Soviet Union that began in 1989 and continued throughout the 1990s, Ariel, which had a population of 8,000 in 1990, experienced a population boom. Unlike in Israel proper, apartments in Ariel were plentiful and cheap, which proved attractive to the immigrants.Soviet immigrants mark Passover ‚Äì The Spokesman Review. 9 April 1990 Some 6,000 Soviet immigrants moved to Ariel, almost doubling its population. In 2005, the residents of Netzarim, a former Israeli settlement in the Gaza Strip which had been evacuated, found temporary housing in the dormitories of the Ariel University Center of Samaria. At the beginning of the academic year, about one-third chose to settle permanently in Ariel, while the rest moved to Yevul. In 2007, the city began receiving immigrants from English-speaking countries such as the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, and South Africa in significant numbers. Nachman, a central figure in the Likud party, presided over Ariel from 1978 until his death in January 2013, at first as head of the local council and as mayor from 1985, when the settlement was officially recognized as a city. Both religious and secular Jews reside in Ariel. The city has sixteen synagogues. On 5 February 2018, an Israeli man was stabbed to death in a terror attack at a bus station at the entrance of Ariel.

Peacenow, May 2005Virtuel Israel Experience: Ariel The American-Israeli Cooperative Enterprise and west of the Jordan River, Jordan's western border. Ariel is adjacent to the Palestinian Authority town of Salfit and southwest of Nablus. It is approximately east of Petah Tikva, and east of Tel Aviv to which it is connected by the Highway 5 and northwest of Jerusalem, to which it is connected by Highway 60. Ariel's jurisdiction spans , and borders the Palestinian towns and villages Salfit, Marda and Iskaka. Ariel's municipal area contains several enclaves of privately owned Palestinian land, whose owners are not allowed access to them. The central water pumping station in Salfit has been polluted several times by overflow from the wastewater in Ariel. Economy The city has several shopping centres and two industrial zones (divided into light and heavy industry), a library. In July 2008, Israel approved the construction of 27 new factories, which were expected to be completed by September 2009. Political status Like other settlements in the Israeli-occupied territories, Ariel is considered illegal under international law, though Israel disputes this.Patience, Martin Kadima victory concerns settlers BBC, 31 March 2006 A series of Israeli governments has insisted that Ariel be included within Israel's future borders under any future peace treaty. The Israeli Ministry of the Interior gave the municipality of Ariel the status of a city council in 1998. In January 2010, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, accompanied by leading figures in his governing coalition, declared Ariel the \\"capital of Samaria\\", and an integral part of Israel. In December 2010, thirty-five MKs petitioned the government to annex Ariel to Israel.\\"Knesset members demand annexation of Ariel settlement\\" , The Palestine Telegraph, 4 December 2010. Palestinian representatives have opposed the incorporation of Ariel into Israel in any future settlement, arguing that the Ariel 'finger' would interrupt the territorial integrity of a Palestinian state and includes a major aquifer. Ariel's future is thus not clear: \\"as well as an obstacle to an Israeli-Palestinian agreement, it could also serve as a crucial trade-off for negotiators hammering out a final deal.\\" McDonald's Israel, the local subsidiary of the international fast food chain, turned down an offer to open a restaurant in Ariel in June 2013, citing its declared policy not to open any branches in West Bank settlements across the Green Line. Education and culture Ariel is home to the Ariel University, founded in 1982 as the College of Judea of Samaria. It later became known as the Ariel University Center of Samaria. Current enrollment is 12,000, consisting of both Jewish and Arab students. On December 24, 2012, after many legal battles, the school became fully accredited and recognized as the 9th Israeli University. University status is an issue of prestige, increased government funding, as well as the ability to open post-graduate studies (which are already offered at the college) and issue doctorate degrees. Formerly called the 'Academic College of Judea and Samaria', it changed its name in August 2007 in the interim period and anticipation of achieving the more prestigious 'university' status. The state-funded Ariel Center for the Performing Arts opened on November 8, 2010, with a performance of Piaf by the Beersheba Theater company. These performances were boycotted by sixty Israeli actors, writers, and directors, including Joshua Sobol, who refuse to perform in settlements. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Culture Minister Limor Livnat and the leader of the Kadima Party Tzipi Livni condemned the boycott and proposed cutting government funding those participating in it.Macintyre, Donald. \\"Israeli actors refuse to take the stage in settlement theatre\\", The Independent, 30 August 2010 The boycott was supported by Amos Oz, David Grossman and A. B. Yehoshua,Fyler, Boaz. \\"Yehoshua, Oz, Grossman back boycott of Ariel\\", Ynet News\\" 30 August 2010 It was opposed by Amnon Shamosh, who suggested that the boycott plays into the hands of right-wing extremists by linking art and politics. 150 U.S. actors supported the boycott.Israeli Artists Condemn Settlements, Jewish Voice for Peace However, five Israeli actors later withdrew from the boycott, indicating that they changed their mind or thought the letter they were signing called for a discussion on the issue rather than outright boycott. West Bank barrier The Israeli West Bank barrier was originally planned to extend out from the Israeli border to Ariel. Under American political pressure, the \\"finger\\", as the extension of the fence to include Ariel is often called, was not built. Instead, Ariel has a security fence surrounding it on only three sides.Westervelt, Eric. \\"Israeli Settlement Seeks Protection\\", National Public Radio International relations =Twin towns/ Sister cities= Ariel is twinned with: * Heredia, Costa Rica * Mobile, Alabama, United States * Cead√Ær-Lunga, Moldova * Divjak√´, Albania References External links * Ariel municipality Home page Hebrew * Ariel municipality Home page English * Ariel University Home page English * Ariel Center For The Performing Arts Home page Hebrew Cities in the West Bank Mixed Israeli settlements Populated places established in 1978 Israeli settlements 1978 establishments in the Israeli Military Governorate ","title":"Ariel (city)"},{"id":"598526","text":"Members of the parrot genus Psittacula or Afro-Asian ring-necked parakeets as they are commonly known in aviculture originates found from Africa to South- East Asia.

The majority of the Loriculus species occur on islands. Moreover, since Loriculus is spread across both sides of the Wallace Line it can be considered more Australasian than Asian. These parrots mostly have green plumage, with adults having coloured heads. The bill is stout, and the tail is long and graduated. The genus Psittacula was introduced by the French naturalist Georges Cuvier in 1800. The type species was subsequently designated as the red-breasted parakeet. The name of the genus is a diminutive of the Latin word psittacus for a \\"parrot\\". Species and phylogeny = Current taxonomy = Phylogeny of the genus Psittacula based on existing molecular evidence. Species with red lines are currently unplaced in the phylogeny, but do belong to this genus. The genus includes 16 species, of which three are extinct. * Newton's parakeet, Psittacula exsul - extinct (c.1875) * Echo parakeet, Psittacula eques ** R√©union parakeet, Psittacula eques eques - extinct mid-18th century * Mascarene grey parakeet, Psittacula bensoni - extinct (c.1764) * Rose-ringed parakeet, Psittacula krameri * Alexandrine parakeet, Psittacula eupatria * Seychelles parakeet, Psittacula wardi - extinct (1883) * Plum-headed parakeet, Psittacula cyanocephala * Blossom-headed parakeet, Psittacula roseata * Slaty-headed parakeet, Psittacula himalayana * Grey-headed parakeet, Psittacula finschii * Blue- winged parakeet, Psittacula columboides * Layard's parakeet, Psittacula calthrapae * Lord Derby's parakeet, Psittacula derbiana * Red-breasted parakeet, Psittacula alexandri (also called moustached parakeet) * Long-tailed parakeet, Psittacula longicauda * Nicobar parakeet, Psittacula caniceps = Alternative taxonomy = Recent genetic evidence has found that the genus Psittacula is likely paraphyletic; for example, genetic analysis has supported merging short-tailed parrots of the genus Tanygnathus, Psittinus, and the extinct Mascarinus with Psittacula. An alternative classification system to this was proposed by Braun et al. (2019) that splits the genus Psittacula into multiple monophyletic genera in order to preserve Tanygnathus, Psittinus, and Mascarinus as distinct genera. After the proposed split, the only remaining species in Psittacula sensu stricto are P. derbiana and P. alexandri. The list of split or monophyletic genera and species is displayed below: * Genus Himalayapsitta **Plum-headed parakeet, Himalayapsitta cyanocephala ** Grey- headed parakeet, Himalayapsitta finschii ** Slaty-headed parakeet, Himalayapsitta himalayana **Blossom-headed parakeet, Himalayapsitta roseata * Genus Nicopsitta **Blue-winged parakeet, Nicopsitta columboides **Layard's parakeet, Nicopsitta calthrapae * Genus Belocercus **Long-tailed parakeet, Belocercus longicauda * Genus Psittacula **Red-breasted parakeet, Psittacula alexandri ** Lord Derby's parakeet, Psittacula derbiana * Genus Palaeornis **Alexandrine parakeet, Palaeornis eupatria ** ‚Ä†Seychelles parakeet, Palaeornis wardi * Genus Alexandrinus **Rose-ringed parakeet, Alexandrinus krameri ** ‚Ä†Newton's parakeet, Alexandrinus exsul ** Mauritius parakeet, Alexandrinus (eques) echo * Genus Tanygnathus **Great-billed parrot, Tanygnathus megalorynchos ** Blue-naped parrot, Tanygnathus lucionensis ** Blue-backed parrot, Tanygnathus sumatranus ** Black-lored parrot, Tanygnathus gramineus * Genus Psittinus **Blue-rumped parrot, Psittinus cyanurus ** Simeulue parrot, Psittinus abbotti * Genus Mascarinus **‚Ä†Mascarene parrot, Mascarinus mascarin The study has not yet classified P. bensoni or P. caniceps. It has also found that the rose-ringed and Alexandrine parakeets are likely paraphyletic species themselves, and thus need to be split into multiple species. = Hypothetical extinct species = The Rothschild's or intermediate parakeet P. intermedia, found in northern India, was formerly considered a mystery, as only very few specimens were known. It has since been demonstrated to be a hybrid between the slaty-headed parakeet P. himalayana and the plum-headed parakeet P. cyanocephala. The taxonomy of the R√©union parakeet P. eques is also confusing. Extinct since 1770, little evidence even exists of the bird's existence. A study skin had been discovered at the Royal Museum of Scotland, explicitly referencing a book description of the R√©union birds. It is known from other descriptions, as well as illustrations of which it is unknown whether they were drawn from live or stuffed specimens. This may be the only material proof of these birds' existence. Taxonomists are unsure if the birds were a distinct species, or conspecific with the Mauritius parakeet, although genetic analysis supports it being a subspecies of the Mauritius parakeet.

His book, A History of the Birds of New Zealand, first published in 1873, was published as an enlarged version in 1888 and became a New Zealand classic. Biography Buller was born at Newark, the Wesleyan mission at Pakanae in the Hokianga, the son of Rev. James Buller, a Cornish missionary who had helped convert the people of Tonga to Methodism. He was educated at Wesley College in Auckland. In 1854, he moved to Wellington with his parents, where he was befriended by the naturalist William John Swainson. In 1859 he was made Native Commissioner for the Southern Provinces. In 1871 he travelled to England and was called to the bar at the Inner Temple. Three years later he returned to Wellington and practised law. In 1862, he married Charlotte Mair at Whangarei. They were to have four children. Buller was the author of A History of the Birds of New Zealand (1872‚Äì1873, 2nd ed. 1887‚Äì1888), with illustrations by John Gerrard Keulemans (and Henrik Gr√∂nvold?). In 1882 he produced the Manual of the Birds of New Zealand as a cheaper popular alternative. In 1905, he published a two-volume Supplement to the History of the Birds of New Zealand, which brought the work up to date. Buller was appointed Companion of the Most Distinguished Order of St Michael and St George in 1875. In November 1886, he was promoted to Knight Commander. Buller helped establish the scientific display in the New Zealand Court at the World's Fair in Paris and was decorated with the Officer of the Legion of Honour by the President of France in November 1889.Brewer, M., 'New Zealand and the Legion d'honneur: Officiers, Commandeurs and Dignites', The Volunteers: The Journal of the New Zealand Military Historical Society, 35(3), March 2010, p.136.'Death of Sir Walter Buller, A noted Ornithologist', Evening Post, 20 July 1906, p.6. He had several unsuccessful attempts at entering Parliament as a Liberal. He contested the general elections of 1876 (; beaten by the incumbent Walter Johnston) and (, where he came fourth of six candidates), and the in the electorate (where he was beaten by William Fraser, the official Liberal Party candidate). He emigrated to England and died at Fleet in Hampshire on 19 July 1906. Wellington playwright Nick Blake authored a play on Buller's life, Dr Buller's Birds, which had its debut at the 2006 NZ International Arts Festival.

Due to gravitational lensing, the light is diverted, making it seem to come from different places. If source, lens, and observer are all aligned, the light appears as a ring.  Introduction  Gravitational lensing is predicted by Albert Einstein's theory of general relativity. Instead of light from a source traveling in a straight line (in three dimensions), it is bent by the presence of a massive body, which distorts spacetime. An Einstein Ring is a special case of gravitational lensing, caused by the exact alignment of the source, lens, and observer. This results in symmetry around the lens, causing a ring-like structure. The geometry of a complete Einstein ring, as caused by a gravitational lens The size of an Einstein ring is given by the Einstein radius. In radians, it is :\\\\theta_1 = \\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{4GM}{c^2}\\\\;\\\\frac{D_{LS}}{D_S D_L}}, where : G is the gravitational constant, : M is the mass of the lens, : c is the speed of light, : D_L is the angular diameter distance to the lens, : D_S is the angular diameter distance to the source, and : D_{LS} is the angular diameter distance between the lens and the source. Over cosmological distances D_{LS} e D_S-D_L in general.  History  ALMA. The bending of light by a gravitational body was predicted by Albert Einstein in 1912, a few years before the publication of general relativity in 1916 (Renn et al. 1997). The ring effect was first mentioned in the academic literature by Orest Khvolson in a short article in 1924, in which he mentioned the ‚Äúhalo effect‚Äù of gravitation when the source, lens, and observer are in near-perfect alignment. Einstein remarked upon this effect in 1936 in a paper prompted by a letter by a Czech engineer, R W Mandl , but stated (In this statement, Œ≤ is the Einstein Radius currently denoted by \\\\theta_1, as in the expression above.) However, Einstein was only considering the chance of observing Einstein rings produced by stars, which is low ‚Äì the chance of observing those produced by larger lenses such as galaxies or black holes is higher since the angular size of an Einstein ring increases with the mass of the lens. The first complete Einstein ring, designated B1938+666, was discovered by collaboration between astronomers at the University of Manchester and NASA's Hubble Space Telescope in 1998. There have apparently not been any observations of a star forming an Einstein ring with another star, but there is a 45% chance of this happening in early May, 2028 when Alpha Centauri A passes between us and a distant red star. = Known Einstein rings = \\"Smiley\\" or \\"Cheshire Cat\\" image of galaxy cluster (SDSS J1038+4849) and gravitational lensing (an \\"Einstein ring\\") discovered by an international team of scientists, imaged with HST. Hundreds of gravitational lenses are currently known. About half a dozen of them are partial Einstein rings with diameters up to an arcsecond, although as either the mass distribution of the lenses is not perfectly axially symmetrical, or the source, lens, and observer are not perfectly aligned, we have yet to see a perfect Einstein ring. Most rings have been discovered in the radio range. The degree of completeness needed for an image seen through a gravitational lens to qualify as an Einstein ring is yet to be defined. The first Einstein ring was discovered by Hewitt et al. (1988), who observed the radio source MG1131+0456 using the Very Large Array. This observation saw a quasar lensed by a nearer galaxy into two separate but very similar images of the same object, the images stretched round the lens into an almost complete ring. These dual images are another possible effect of the source, lens, and observer not being perfectly aligned. The first complete Einstein ring to be discovered was B1938+666, which was found by King et al. (1998) via optical follow-up with the Hubble Space Telescope of a gravitational lens imaged with MERLIN. The galaxy causing the lens at B1938+666 is an ancient elliptical galaxy, and the image we see through the lens is a dark dwarf satellite galaxy, which we would otherwise not be able to see with current technology. In 2005, the combined power of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) with the Hubble Space Telescope was used in the Sloan Lens ACS (SLACS) Survey to find 19 new gravitational lenses, 8 of which showed Einstein rings, these are the 8 shown in the adjacent image. As of 2009 this survey has found 85 confirmed gravitational lenses, there is not yet a number for how many show Einstein rings. This survey is responsible for most of the recent discoveries of Einstein rings in the optical range, following are some examples which were found: *FOR J0332-3557, discovered by Remi Cabanac et al. in 2005, notable for its high redshift which allows us to use it to make observations about the early universe. *The \\"Cosmic Horseshoe\\" is a partial Einstein ring which was observed through the gravitational lens of LRG 3-757, a distinctively large Luminous Red Galaxy. It was discovered in 2007 by V. Belokurov et al. *SDSSJ0946+1006, the \\"double Einstein ring\\" was discovered by Raphael Gavazzi and Tomasso Treu in 2008, notable for the presence of multiple rings observed through the same gravitational lens, the significance of which is explained in the next section on extra rings. Another example is the radio/X-Ray Einstein ring around PKS 1830-211, which is unusually strong in radio. It was discovered in X-Ray by Varsha Gupta et al. at the Chandra X-Ray observatory It is also notable for being the first case of a quasar being lensed by an almost face-on spiral galaxy. There is also a radio ring around galaxy MG1654+1346, the image in the ring is that of a quasar radio lobe, discovered in 1989 by G.Langston et al.  Extra rings  SDSSJ0946+1006 is a Double Einstein Ring. Credit: HST/NASA/ESA Using the Hubble Space Telescope, a double ring has been found by Raphael Gavazzi of the STScI and Tommaso Treu of the University of California, Santa Barbara. This arises from the light from three galaxies at distances of 3, 6, and 11 billion light years. Such rings help in understanding the distribution of dark matter, dark energy, the nature of distant galaxies, and the curvature of the universe. The odds of finding such a double ring are 1 in 10,000. Sampling 50 suitable double rings would provide astronomers with a more accurate measurement of the dark matter content of the universe and the equation of state of the dark energy to within 10 percent precision. = A simulation = Below in the Gallery section is a simulation depicting a zoom on a Schwarzschild black hole in the plane of the Milky Way between us and the centre of the galaxy. The first Einstein ring is to the most distorted region of the picture and shows the galactic disc. The zoom then reveals a series of 4 extra rings, increasingly thinner and closer to the black hole shadow. They are multiple images of the galactic disk. The first and third correspond to points which are behind the black hole (from the observer's position) and correspond here to the bright yellow region of the galactic disc (close to the galactic center), whereas the second and fourth correspond to images of objects which are behind the observer, which appear bluer since the corresponding part of the galactic disc is thinner and hence dimmer here.

Menezes, Paul C. van Oorschot, Scott A. Vanstone. Fifth Printing (August 2001) page 251. The product cipher combines a sequence of simple transformations such as substitution (S-box), permutation (P-box), and modular arithmetic. The concept of product ciphers is due to Claude Shannon, who presented the idea in his foundational paper, Communication Theory of Secrecy Systems. For transformation involving reasonable number of n message symbols, both of the foregoing cipher systems (the S-box and P-box) are by themselves wanting. Shannon suggested using a combination of S-box and P-box transformation‚Äîa product cipher. The combination could yield a cipher system more powerful than either one alone. This approach of alternatively applying substitution and permutation transformation has been used by IBM in the Lucifer cipher system, and has become the standard for national data encryption standards such as the Data Encryption Standard and the Advanced Encryption Standard. A product cipher that uses only substitutions and permutations is called a SP-network. Feistel ciphers are an important class of product ciphers.

The stadium is served by the University of Washington Link light rail station, which provides rail service to downtown, Rainier Valley and Seattle‚ÄìTacoma International Airport. It is also accessible by several bus routes. The stadium underwent a $280 million renovation that was completed in 2013. Its U-shaped design was specifically oriented (18.167¬∞ south of due east) to minimize glare from the early afternoon sun in the athletes' eyes. The stadium's open end overlooks Lake Washington and the Cascade Mountains, including Mount Rainier. Prior to the 2013 renovation, its total capacity of 72,500 made it the largest stadium in the Pacific Northwest and one of the largest college football stadiums. History The original stadium was built in 1920 by Puget Sound Bridge and Dredging Company with a seating capacity of 30,000. It replaced Denny Field, located at the north end of campus, south of NE 45th St. and 20th Ave NE. Husky Stadium's first game was the concluding game of the 1920 season, a 28‚Äì7 loss to Dartmouth on November 27. On July 27, 1923, the stadium was the site of President Warren Harding's final public address; he died in San Francisco less than a week later. The capacity of the lower bowl was expanded with the addition of 10,000 seats around the rim in 1936. In 1943, 35,000 people watched a demonstration of a mock WWII bombing raid, showing how local forces would respond in an attack. The Seattle fire department and emergency response teams rescued mock victims and buildings constructed on the field that were exploded as P-38 planes flew overhead to demonstrate how citizens should react. The first of the stadium's iconic covered grandstands was constructed in 1950, adding 15,000 seats to the south side. Several thousand additional seats were added in 1968. An aerial view of Husky Stadium as seen the day before the start of the 2011 renovation project. \\"Go Huskies\\" and the \\"W\\" logo were painted on the north and south decks in September 2008.Washington-BYU Postgame Notes In 1987, 13,000 seats were added with the construction of the north grandstand. Similar to the south stand, this structure included a cantilevered steel roof covering a portion of the lower seats. The project made headlines on February 25, 1987, when the grandstand collapsed during construction as a result of miscommunication between the workers and the contractor, which led to the premature removal during the intended replacement of several support cables. Although there were no casualties, property damage ranged from $500,000 to $1 million and resulted in setbacks.HistoryLink Essay: Husky Stadium collapses on February 25, 1987 Husky Stadium was a primary venue for the 1990 Goodwill Games, where the crowd saw an address by former President Ronald Reagan, as well as an address by Arnold Schwarzenegger, and a performance by the Moody Blues & Gorky Park. The stadium hosted the opening and closing ceremonies, as well as the track & field competition. Husky Stadium was the temporary home of the Seattle Seahawks for five games (two preseason and three regular season) in 1994 while the Kingdome was temporarily closed for repairs to its damaged roof. After the demolition of the Kingdome in March 2000, the Seahawks played at Husky Stadium for the 2000 and 2001 seasons before moving into Seahawks Stadium (now CenturyLink Field) in 2002. The playing field at Husky Stadium was originally dirt, which was then replaced with natural grass in 1938. In 1968, Washington became one of the first major college teams to play on AstroTurf at home; at the time, the Houston Astrodome, Neyland Stadium in Knoxville, Tennessee, and Camp Randall Stadium in Madison, Wisconsin, were the only other major facilities with artificial turf. The AstroTurf field was replaced in 1972, 1977, 1987, and 1995. FieldTurf, a new variation of synthetic turf, was installed in 2000 at a cost of $1,074,958. The new turf features enhanced drainage and reduced abrasion through the use of synthetic fibers that are tufted into an infill of sand and rubber. The project was funded by Seattle Seahawks owner Paul Allen, who used Husky Stadium as a temporary home venue during the construction of CenturyLink Field. The first of its kind in the NFL, the surface was so popular with the players that the Seahawks, who had planned to use natural grass at their new stadium, instead installed their own FieldTurf surface. The FieldTurf at Husky Stadium was replaced with a newer one after nine seasons in 2009 at a cost of $350,000. Union Bay In addition to the new playing surface, the Seahawks made other improvements to Husky stadium in preparation for its tenure as an NFL venue for two seasons. A larger scoreboard debuted in 1998, with a \\"HuskyTron\\" video screen. Improved lighting for television, including corner lights, was added in 1999, and official NFL goalposts (optic yellow, in height) were installed in 2000. The Husky Stadium end zones were painted gold during the 1980s and early 1990s; the new AstroTurf in 1995 changed them to purple. They became natural green with the installation of FieldTurf in 2000, which lasted until 2009 when they reverted to gold for one season. Purple end zones returned prior the 2010 season, and were temporarily painted black for the Huskies' first \\"blackout\\" game against UCLA on November 18. On September 3, 2015, Alaska Airlines purchased naming rights to the field, which changed its official name to \\"Alaska Airlines Field at Husky Stadium.\\" The agreement, worth $41 million over 10 years, became the largest of its kind in college athletics. =The Wave= Pre-renovation in 2009, looking south; Downtown and Space Needle at top right Many claim that the first audience wave originated in Husky Stadium on Halloween 1981, at the prompting of Husky band trumpeter Dave Hunter. Contrary to Hunter's account, former Washington yell leader Robb Weller has also claimed credit for the first wave. Weller was the guest yell-king during the Huskies' homecoming football game against Stanford. His initial concept for the wave was for it to travel vertically, from the bottom of the stands to the top, within the Husky student section. When the stunt was met with limited interest, he then decided to reverse the movement of the wave to travel from top to bottom. This failed miserably, as it was necessary to turn backward to see the wave progressing downward. Weller then gave up and returned his attention to the game. However, a fan named Omar Parker sitting on the open (east) end of the stadium at the student side started yelling \\"sideways\\". Weller did not hear him, but then many students tried to initiate a \\"sideways\\" wave on their own. After a few attempts, and more yelling of \\"sideways\\" by students, Weller took notice. He instructed the crowd to stand as he ran past. He moved along the track toward the open end of the stadium, explaining to the student crowd what he would do, then ran along the track toward the closed end of the stadium, in front of the student section. The stunt caught on after a couple of tries and continued around the entire stadium, and was then repeated throughout the rest of the game and the season. Longtime UW band director Bill Bissell also claimed co-creator credit with Weller, suggesting that the wave was devised by both of them prior to the game. The following week Bill Scott (known as \\"Bill the Beer Man\\") started the wave in Husky Stadium and also at the Seattle Seahawks game in the Kingdome. =Loudness= Capacity crowd in the south stands at the 100th Apple Cup in 2007 Husky Stadium has long been recognized as one of the loudest stadiums in the nation. This is in part due to the stadium's design; almost 70% of the seats are located between the end zones, covered by cantilevered metal roofs that trap the sound.Husky Stadium listing at official Huskies athletic site On occasion, the high decibel levels at Husky games along with fans stomping their feet in the bleachers cause television cameras to shake. During the night game against #12 Nebraska on September 19, 1992, ESPN measured the noise level at over 130 decibels, well above the threshold of pain. The maximum recorded level of 133.6 decibels, according to ESPN, is the highest ever recorded at a college football stadium. =Tailgating= The north and south parking lots are packed with cars for tailgating. Husky Stadium is unusual in that fans can travel to football games by boat, known locally as \\"sailgating\\" (other stadiums with this feature include Neyland Stadium at Tennessee, Heinz Field at Pittsburgh, and McLane Stadium at Baylor). There can be upwards of 12,000 people out on Lake Washington next to Husky Stadium during game days.Tim Booth AP Sports Writer Before kickoff, the Washington crew team offers shuttles to anyone that wants to go to and from the boats and docks for the game.IdahoStatesman.com Fans also gather at the Dempsey Indoor Facility just north of the stadium for Husky Huddles. After the game, the Tyee Sports Council and the University of Washington Athletic Department put on events where fans can gather and hear analysis of the game from Washington coaches and Husky Legends, and listen to the Husky Marching Band. =2011‚Äì2013 renovation= Renovation in April 2012 Photo from student section in West endzone during Husky game in September 2019 Husky Stadium had developed numerous structural problems over the years as a result of standing for nine decades in Seattle's moist weather, particularly in the lower bowl. In November 2011, Husky Stadium began a $261 million renovation, the largest single capital project in the university's history. Home games were played at CenturyLink Field during the 2012 season while construction took place. The Apple Cup in 2011 was moved to CenturyLink (Qwest Field through 2011) to advance the start of the project by several weeks. The new Husky Stadium was developed by Wright Runstad & Company, designed by 360 Architecture, and constructed by Turner Construction company. The steel decking was supplied by Profile Steel. The new stadium is the first and primary income source of a completely remodeled athletic district which includes a new $19 million Husky Ballpark, a new track and field stadium, renovated soccer stadium, $50 million basketball operations and practice facility and recently completed projects such as the Husky Legends Center, the Conibear Shellhouse and Alaska Airlines Arena renovations, and the construction of the Dempsey Indoor facility. This major remodel of the athletic village coincided with construction for an underground station for a northern extension of the Link Light Rail system and a replacement of the Evergreen Point Floating Bridge. The renovation project incorporated a new grand concourse, press box, video and audio system, and football offices, as well as new and improved amenities, concession stands, and bathrooms. The track that had enclosed the playing field was removed, and the field itself lowered by four feet to make room for additional seating closer to the sidelines. The student section was relocated from the north sideline to the west end zone, and the temporary bleachers in the east end zone were replaced with a permanent structure featuring field-level suites. The addition of box suites reduced the seating capacity from 72,500 to 70,138.\\"Husky Stadium to debut after $280M renovation\\". USA Today. Associated Press. August 29, 2013. Retrieved September 1, 2013. Despite the reduction in capacity, the renovated stadium is expected to be as loud as its predecessor.Gall, Braden Ranking the Pac-12's College Football Stadiums. Athlon Sports, 2013-06-13. Additionally, new parking garages were constructed and facilities throughout the athletic village were renovated. NFL exhibition games Before the arrival of the Seattle Seahawks between 1955 and 1975, Husky Stadium hosted 12 NFL preseason games. The San Francisco 49ers played six times at the stadium, the most of any team. Other teams to make multiple appearances include the New York Giants, Los Angeles Rams, Cleveland Browns, and Chicago/St. Louis Cardinals. At one point after the 1970 NFL season, Ralph Wilson came close to moving the Buffalo Bills from dilapidated War Memorial Stadium to Husky Stadium. The threat of relocation prompted the developers in the Buffalo suburbs to construct Rich Stadium in Orchard Park (later Ralph Wilson Stadium and now New Era Field), which opened in 1973. The Bills have resided there ever since.

These cells have the ability to spontaneously produce an electrical impulse (action potential; see below for more details), that travels through the heart via the electrical conduction system (see figure 1) causing it to contract. In a healthy heart, the SA node continuously produces action potential, setting the rhythm of the heart and so is known as the heart's natural pacemaker. The rate of action potential production (and therefore the heart rate) is influenced by nerves that supply it. Structure The sinoatrial node is a banana-shaped structure that varies in size, usually between 10-30 millimeters (mm) long, 5‚Äì7 mm wide, and 1‚Äì2 mm deep. =Location= The SA node is located in the wall (myocardium) of the right atrium, laterally to the entrance of the superior vena cava in a region called the sinus venarum (hence sino- + atrial). It is positioned roughly between a groove called the crista terminalis located on the internal surface of the heart and the corresponding sulcus terminalis, on the external surface. These grooves run between the entrance of the superior vena cava and the inferior vena cava. =Microanatomy= stained image of the SA node (center-right on image) and its surrounding tissue. The SA node surrounds the sinoatrial nodal artery, seen as the open lumen. Cardiac muscle cells of the right atrium can be seen to the left of the node, and fat tissue to the right. The cells of the SA node are spread out within a mesh of connective tissue, containing nerves, blood vessels, collagen and fat. Immediately surrounding the SA node cells are paranodal cells. These cells have structures intermediate between that of the SA node cells and the rest of the atrium. The connective tissue, along with the paranodal cells, insulate the SA node from the rest of the atrium, preventing the electrical activity of the atrial cells from affecting the SA node cells. The SA node cells are smaller and paler than the surrounding atrial cells, with the average cell being around 8 micrometers in diameter and 20-30 micrometers in length (1 micrometer= 0.000001 meter). Unlike the atrial cells, SA node cells contain fewer mitochondria (the power plant of the cell), fewer myofibers (the contractile machinery of the cell), and a smaller sarcoplasmic reticulum (a calcium storage organelle that releases calcium for contraction). This means that the SA node cells are less equipped to contract compared to the atrial and ventricular cells. Action potentials pass from one cardiac cell to the next through pores known as gap junctions. These gap junctions are made of proteins called connexins. There are fewer gap junctions within the SA node and they are smaller in size. This is again important in insulating the SA node from the surrounding atrial cells. =Blood supply= The sinoatrial node receives its blood supply from the sinoatrial nodal artery. This blood supply, however, can differ hugely between individuals. For example, in most humans, this is a single artery, although in some cases there have been either 2 or 3 sinoatrial node arteries supplying the SA node. Also, the SA node artery mainly originates as a branch of the right coronary artery; however in some individuals it has arisen from the circumflex artery, which is a branch of the left coronary artery. Finally, the SA node artery commonly passes behind the superior vena cava, before reaching the SA node; however in some instances it passes in front. Despite these many differences, there doesn‚Äôt appear to be any advantage to how many sinoatrial nodal arteries an individual has, or where they originate =Venous drainage= There are no large veins that drain blood away from the SA node. Instead, smaller venules drain the blood directly into the right atrium. Function =Pacemaking= The main role of a sinoatrial node cell is to initiate action potentials of the heart that can pass through cardiac muscle cells and cause contraction. An action potential is a rapid change in membrane potential, produced by the movement of charged atoms (ions). In the absence of stimulation, non-pacemaker cells (including the ventricular and atrial cells) have a relatively constant membrane potential; this is known as a resting potential. This resting phase (see cardiac action potential, phase 4) ends when an action potential reaches the cell. This produces a positive change in membrane potential, known as depolarization, which is propagated throughout the heart and initiates muscle contraction. Pacemaker cells, however, do not have a resting potential. Instead, immediately after repolarization, the membrane potential of these cells begins to depolarise again automatically, a phenomenon known as the pacemaker potential. Once the pacemaker potential reaches a set value, the threshold potential, it produces an action potential. Other cells within the heart (including the Purkinje fibers and atrioventricular node) can also initiate action potentials; however, they do so at a slower rate and therefore, if the SA node is functioning properly, its action potentials usually override those that would be produced by other tissues. Outlined below are the 3 phases of a sinoatrial node action potential. In the cardiac action potential, there are 5 phases (labelled 0-4), however pacemaker action potentials do not have an obvious phase 1 or 2. Phase 4 Figure 3: Sinoatrial node action potential waveform, outlining major ion currents involved (downward deflection indicates ions moving into the cell, upwards deflection indicates ions flowing out of the cell). This phase is also known as the pacemaker potential. Immediately following repolarization, when the membrane potential is very negative (it is hyperpolarised), the voltage slowly begins to increase. This is initially due to the closing of potassium channels, which reduces the flow of potassium ions (Ik) out of the cell (see phase 2, below). Hyperpolarization also causes activation of hyperpolarisation-activated cyclic nucleotide‚Äìgated (HCN) channels. The activation of ion channels at very negative membrane potentials is unusual, therefore the flow of sodium (Na+) and some K+ through the activated HCN channel is referred to as a funny current (If). This funny current causes the membrane potential of the cell to gradually increase, as the positive charge (Na+ and K+) is flowing into the cell. Another mechanism involved in pacemaker potential is known as the calcium clock. This refers to the spontaneous release of calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (a calcium store) into the cytoplasm, also known as calcium sparks. This increase in calcium within the cell then activates a sodium-calcium exchanger (NCX), which removes one Ca2+ from the cell, and exchanges it for 3 Na+ into the cell (therefore removing a charge of +2 from the cell, but allowing a charge of +3 to enter the cell) further increasing the membrane potential. Calcium later reenters the cell via SERCA and calcium channels located on the cell membrane. The increase in membrane potential produced by these mechanisms, activates T-type calcium channels and then L-type calcium channels (which open very slowly). These channels allow a flow of Ca2+ into the cell, making the membrane potential even more positive. Phase 0 This is the depolarization phase. When the membrane potential reaches the threshold potential (around -20 to -50 mV), the cell begins to rapidly depolarise (become more positive).Verkerk, A., Borren, van, Peters, R., Broekhuis, E., Lam, K., Coronel, R., Bakker, de, Tan, H. and Wilders, R. (2007) 'Single cells isolated from human sinoatrial node: Action potentials and numerical reconstruction of pacemaker current‚Äô, Conference proceedings : ... Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society. IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society. Annual Conference., 2007, pp. 904‚Äì7. This is mainly due to the flow of Ca2+ through L-type calcium channels, which are now fully open. During this stage, T-type calcium channels and HCN channels deactivate. Phase 3 This phase is the repolarization phase. This occurs due to the inactivation of L-type calcium channels (preventing the movement of Ca2+ into the cell) and the activation of potassium channels, which allows the flow of K+ out of the cell, making the membrane potential more negative. Nerve supply Heart rate depends on the rate at which the sinoatrial node produces action potentials. At rest, heart rate is between 60 and 100 beats per minute. This is a result of the activity of two sets of nerves, one acting to slow down action potential production (these are parasympathetic nerves) and the other acting to speed up action potential production (sympathetic nerves). The sympathetic nerves begin in the thoracic region of the spinal cord (in particular T1-T4). These nerves release a neurotransmitter called noradrenaline (NA). This binds to a receptor on the SA node membrane, called a beta-1adrenoceptor. Binding of NA to this receptor activates a G-protein (in particular a Gs-Protein, S for stimulatory) which initiates a series of reactions (known as the cAMP pathway) that results in the production of a molecule called cyclic adenosinemonophosphate (cAMP). This cAMP binds to the HCN channel (see above). Binding of cAMP to the HCN, increases the flow of Na+ and K+ into the cell, speeding up the pacemaker potential, so producing action potentials at a quicker rate, and increasing heart rate.Larsson, P.H. (2010) 'How is the heart rate regulated in the sinoatrial node? Another piece to the puzzle‚Äô, 136(3). An increase in heart rate is known as positive chronotropy. The parasympathetic nerves supplying the SA node (in particular the Vagus nerves) originate in the brain. These nerves release a neurotransmitter called acetylcholine (ACh). ACh binds to a receptor called an M2 muscarinic receptor, located on the SA node membrane. Activation of this M2 receptor, then activates a protein called a G-protein (in particular Gi protein, i for inhibitory). Activation of this G-protein, blocks the cAMP pathway, reducing its effects, therefore inhibiting sympathetic activity and slowing action potential production. As well as this, the G-protein also activates a potassium channel, which allows K+ to flow out of the cell, making the membrane potential more negative and slowing the pacemaker potential, therefore decreasing the rate of action potential production and therefore decreasing heart rate.Osterried-er W., Noma A., Trautwein W. (1980) On the kinetics of the potassium current activated by acetylcholine in the SA node of the rabbit heart. Pfl√ºgers Arch. 386:101‚Äì109. A decrease in heart rate is known as negative chronotropy. The first cell to produce the action potential in the SA node isn‚Äôt always the same: this is known as pacemaker shift. In certain species of animals‚Äîfor example, in dogs‚Äîa superior shift (i.e. the cell that produces the fastest action potential in the SA node is higher than previously) usually produces an increased heart rate whereas an inferior shift (i.e. the cell producing the fastest action potential within the SA node is further down than previously) produces a decreased heart rate. Clinical significance Sinus node dysfunction describes an irregular heartbeat caused by faulty electrical signals of the heart. When the heart's sinoatrial node is defective, the heart‚Äôs rhythms become abnormal ‚Äì typically too slow or exhibiting pauses in its function or a combination, and very rarely faster than normal.Sinus node dysfunction Mount Sinai Hospital, New York Blockage of the arterial blood supply to the SA node (most commonly due to a myocardial infarction or progressive coronary artery disease) can therefore cause ischaemia and cell death in the SA node. This can disrupt the electrical pacemaker function of the SA node, and can result in sick sinus syndrome. If the SA node does not function, or the impulse generated in the SA node is blocked before it travels down the electrical conduction system, a group of cells further down the heart will become its pacemaker. History The sinoatrial node was first discovered by a young medical student, Martin Flack, in the heart of a mole, whilst his mentor, Sir Arthur Keith, was on a bicycle ride with his wife. They made the discovery in a makeshift laboratory set up in a farmhouse in Kent, England, called Mann's Place. Their discovery was published in 1907.

A left-handed pitcher, Gomez played in Major League Baseball (MLB) between 1930 and 1943 for the New York Yankees and the Washington Senators. Gomez was a five-time World Series champion with the Yankees. He was also known for his colorful personality and humor throughout his career and life. Gomez grew up in California and played for the San Francisco Seals after high school. He made his MLB debut with the Yankees in April 1930. He was selected as an All-Star every year between 1933 and 1939. He sustained an arm injury in 1940. Though he rebounded well in 1941, he pitched his last full season in 1942, then appeared in one game in 1943 before retiring with the Washington Senators. In 1933, Gomez married June O'Dea, who had a brief career as a Broadway actress. After his retirement, he became a popular public speaker. Gomez was elected to the National Baseball Hall of Fame by the Veterans Committee in 1972. He made an appearance at Yankee Stadium in 1987, when he and Whitey Ford were honored with plaques at the stadium's Monument Park. He died in California in 1989. Early life Gomez was born in Rodeo, California. His father, Francisco Gomez, had been born in California to a Spanish father, Juan Gomez, and a Portuguese mother, Rita. His mother, Lizzie Herring, was an American of Welsh-Irish descent. He played sandlot baseball in Oakland while attending Richmond High School and was recruited by the San Francisco Seals. The New York Yankees purchased Gomez from the Seals for an estimated $39,000. A memorial plaque dedicated to Lefty Gomez at the Lefty Gomez Field in Rodeo along with a cement impression of his left hand dated 11/22/1932 can be seen at 470 Parker Ave, Rodeo, CA 94572.

Career Gomez's 1933 Goudey baseball card Gomez made his major league debut on April 29, 1930. He pitched in only 15 games and finished the season with a 2-5 win-loss record, a 5.55 earned run average (ERA). Coming into the 1931 season, Gomez had good pitching velocity, but the Yankees were concerned about the pitcher's slender frame of and . Following a common medical strategy of the time, the team had most of his teeth extracted; they also had him drink three quarts of milk daily and gave him an unlimited meal allowance for road games. Gomez registered the second-best ERA in the American League in 1931. A 20-game winner four times and an All-Star every year from 1933 to 1939, Gomez led the league twice each in wins, winning percentage and ERA; he was a three-time league leader in shutouts and strikeouts. In the first major league All-Star Game (July 6, 1933), Gomez was the winning pitcher for the American League (AL) and drove in the first run of the game. This was out of character for him; he was notorious for poor hitting even by AL standards. Late in life, Gomez commented, \\"I never even broke a bat until last year when I was backing out of the garage.\\" His career OPS+ of -7 is the fifth-worst in baseball history among players with at least 1,000 plate appearances. Gomez holds the record for the most innings pitched in a single All-Star game (six, in 1934). Lefty's best season came in 1934, when he won 26 games and lost just five. In both 1934 and 1937, he won pitching's \\"Triple Crown\\" by leading the league in wins, ERA and strikeouts; he also led the AL both seasons in shutouts. His .649 career winning percentage ranks 15th in major league history among pitchers with 200 or more decisions. Among pitchers who made their MLB debuts from 1900 to 1950, only Lefty Grove, Christy Mathewson and Whitey Ford have both more victories and a higher winning percentage than Gomez. Gomez won six World Series games without a loss, a career World Series record. He won a World Series game in 1932, two in 1936, two in 1937 and one in 1938. He also set a World Series record by receiving two walks in the same inning on October 6, 1937. Nicknamed \\"El Goofo\\" and \\"Goofy Gomez\\", he was known for his sense of humor, even on the field. In one game, he came up to bat when it was slightly foggy. Bob Feller was on the mound and Gomez struck a match before stepping into the batter's box. \\"What's the big idea?\\" asked the umpire. \\"Do you think that match will help you see Feller's fast one?\\" Gomez replied, \\"No, I'm not concerned about that. I just want to make sure he can see me!\\" Another time, a reporter asked the noted brushback pitcher, \\"Is it true that you'd throw at your own mother?\\" Gomez replied, \\"You're damn right I would. She's a good hitter.\\" Gomez also often remarked, \\"I'd rather be lucky than good.\\" In 1940, Gomez suffered an arm injury, which left him up for grabs by another team, but in 1941 he played fairly well, winning 15 and losing 5. During that season, he was said to be a great starting pitcher, but won through the support of Johnny Murphy, who relieved him in later innings. After the 1942 season ended, Gomez took a job as a dispatcher with the General Electric River Works, a defense plant in Lynn, Massachusetts, which only paid $40 a week. Then on January 27, 1943, the Yankees sold him to the Boston Braves for $10,000 ($ in current dollar terms). Gomez never appeared in a game with the Braves, as later in the year he was released from his contract and signed with the Washington Senators. He pitched just one game ‚Äï on May 30, 1943, allowing four hits, four runs and walking five men ‚Äï before pulling a shoulder muscle in the fifth inning and retiring from baseball. He had a 189‚Äì102 career record with 1,468 strikeouts and a 3.34 ERA in 2,503 innings pitched. Marriage On February 26, 1933, Gomez married June O‚ÄôDea (1912‚Äì1992). A Broadway headliner who starred in Of Thee I Sing, she gave up her career in 1936. By 1937 the marriage was on shaky ground. Gomez traveled to Hollywood that April and June returned to Massachusetts to stay with family. Through the tabloids, she learned in December that Gomez was filing divorce papers in Mexico, charging incompatibility. Being a devout Catholic, June refused a divorce but agreed to a formal separation, citing abandonment and cruel and inhuman treatment. Publicly, Gomez said the whole idea of divorce was absurd, but after the first of the year he moved to Reno to get a six-week divorce. It was his intention for the divorce to be finalized by the time he began spring training in Florida. Separation proceedings continued for months, but were called off in May 1938. Gomez and O'Dea had two daughters and two sons. After baseball In retirement, Gomez became a sought-after dinner speaker known for his humorous anecdotes about his playing days and the personalities he knew. He was a bit of a screwball, nicknamed \\"El Goofo\\" or \\"Goofy Gomez\\" (a likewise-alliterative counterpart to his contemporary, Dizzy Dean), and delighted in playing practical jokes on everyone from teammates to umpires. On February 2, 1972, the Veterans Committee unanimously inducted Gomez into the National Baseball Hall of Fame, along with Giants outfielder Ross Youngs and former American League President Will Harridge. The Committee noted that Lefty pitched in seven World Series games with no losses and five wins. Wearing a Yankee cap, Gomez became the second player of Hispanic descent to be inducted. The 1983 Major League Baseball All-Star Game was dedicated to Gomez as he was the last surviving player from the 1933 All-Star Game. He also threw out the ceremonial first pitch. On August 2, 1987, he and Whitey Ford were honored with plaques to be placed in Monument Park at Yankee Stadium. Gomez's plaque says he was \\"Noted for his wit and his fastball, as he was fast with a quip and a pitch.\\" Despite advancing age, he was able to attend the ceremony. Although he was honored with the plaque, his uniform #11 has not been retired, and has since been worn by several Yankees including Joe Page, Johnny Sain, H√©ctor L√≥pez, Fred Stanley, Dwight Gooden, Chuck Knoblauch, Gary Sheffield, Doug Mientkiewicz, and Brett Gardner. Gomez spent the last years of his life in Novato, California; he died of congestive heart failure on February 17, 1989, in Marin General Hospital in Larkspur, California. A decade later, he was ranked #73 on The Sporting News list of the 100 Greatest Baseball Players, and was a nominee for the Major League Baseball All-Century Team.

This increase in membrane potential is what causes the cell membrane, which typically maintains a resting membrane potential of -70 mV, to reach the threshold potential and consequently fire the next action potential; thus, the pacemaker potential is what drives the self-generated rhythmic firing (automaticity) of pacemaker cells, and the rate of change (i.e., the slope) of the pacemaker potential is what determines the timing of the next action potential and thus the intrinsic firing rate of the cell. In a healthy sinoatrial node (SAN, a complex tissue within the right atrium containing pacemaker cells that normally determine the intrinsic firing rate for the entire heart), the pacemaker potential is the main determinant of the heart rate. Because the pacemaker potential represents the non-contracting time between heart beats (diastole), it is also called the diastolic depolarization. The amount of net inward current required to move the cell membrane potential during the pacemaker phase is extremely small, in the order of few pAs, but this net flux arises from time to time changing contribution of several currents that flow with different voltage and time dependence. Evidence in support of the active presence of K+, Ca2+, Na+ channels and Na+/K+ exchanger during the pacemaker phase have been variously reported in the literature, but several indications point to the ‚Äúfunny‚Äù(If) current as one of the most important.(see funny current). There is now substantial evidence that also sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca2+-transients participate to the generation of the diastolic depolarization via a process involving the Na‚ÄìCa exchanger. The rhythmic activity of some neurons like the pre-B√∂tzinger complex is modulated by neurotransmitters and neuropeptides, and such modulatory connectivity gives to the neurons the necessary plasticity to generating distinctive, state-dependent rhythmic patterns that depend on pacemarker potentials. Distinctions among autonomic foci In reality, the heart has several pacemakers known as autonomic foci, each which fires at its own intrinsic rate: * SA node: 60‚Äì100 bpm * Atrial foci: 60‚Äì80 bpm * Junctional foci: 40‚Äì60 bpm * Ventricular foci: 20‚Äì40 bpm The potentials will normally travel in order SA node ‚Üí atrial foci ‚Üí junctional foci ‚Üí ventricular foci Pacemaker potentials are fired not only by SA node, but also by the other foci. However, the other firing frequencies are slower than the one of the SA node (as seen above). Normally, all the foci will end up firing at the SA node rate, not their intrinsic rate. The other foci attempt to fire at their intrinsic rate, but they are activated by the SA node before they can fire. This rapid firing causes all the foci to fire faster than their intrinsic rates, a phenomenon known as overdrive-suppression. Thus, in the normal, healthy heart, only the SA node intrinsic rate is observable. Pathology However, in pathological conditions, the intrinsic rate becomes apparent. Consider a heart attack which damages the region of the heart between the SA node and the atrial foci. SA node ‚Üí block atrial foci ‚Üí junctional foci ‚Üí ventricular foci The other foci will not see the SA node firing; however, they will see the atrial foci. The heart will now beat at the intrinsic rate of the atrial foci. Induction The firing of the pacemaker cells is induced electrically by reaching the threshold potential of the cell membrane. The threshold potential is the potential an excitable cell membrane, such as a myocyte, must reach in order to induce an action potential. This depolarization is caused by very small net inward currents of calcium ions across the cell membrane, which gives rise to the action potential. Bio-pacemakers Bio-pacemakers are the outcome of a rapidly emerging field of research into a replacement for the electronic pacemaker. The bio-pacemaker turns quiescent myocardial cells (e.g. atrial cells) into pacemaker cells. This is achieved by making the cells express a gene which creates a pacemaker current.

He is the creator and executive producer of the Emmy Award-winning television series Monk on the USA Network, and is co-host of WFMU radio's long-running conceptual comedy program Seven Second Delay. He has written screenplays for a number of comedy films including Sgt. Bilko (starring Steve Martin) and Rat Race (directed by Jerry Zucker), and is frequently hired as a \\"script doctor\\" to inject humorous content into scripts written by other screenwriters. Television work Breckman wrote for Late Night with David Letterman from 1982 to 1984, and contributed sketches to Saturday Night Live from 1983 to 1996. One of his most well-known vignettes was a Saturday Night Live sketch called \\"White Like Me\\" (which he also directed), in which Eddie Murphy disguises himself as a Caucasian for a day. In 2003 he served as a jokewriter for comedian Steve Martin's stint as host of the Academy Awards. Breckman's biggest success, Monk, was a murder-mystery with a humorous edge. Breckman told New Jersey Monthly that he was a voracious reader of the works of Arthur Conan Doyle, John D. MacDonald, and other authors of ‚Äúsolvable‚Äù mysteries, as well as being a big fan of the TV series Columbo. ‚ÄúIn a way, it‚Äôs similar to comedy writing,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs puzzles and puzzle solving. Very logical.‚Äù In August 2009, USA Network launched Little Monk, a spinoff series that portrays the main character, detective Adrian Monk, as a child. Breckman was part of the show's team of writers. He wrote seven episodes of the 2000-2001 Comedy Central series TV Funhouse, and in 2015 wrote \\"Dog Show\\" for The Jack and Triumph Show. In July 2016 he was part of a team of writers for Triumph, the Insult Comic Dog's coverage of the Republican National Convention in Cleveland and the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia. The Good Cop, another humorous murder-mystery series created and written by Breckman, debuted on Netflix in September 2018. (It ran for ten episodes before being cancelled.) The show starred Tony Danza as Tony Caruso, Sr., \\"a disgraced, former NYPD officer who never followed the rules,\\" and Josh Groban as his son, Tony \\"T.J.\\" Caruso, Jr., a squeaky-clean homicide detective. About the series, Breckman said, \\"Many cop shows feature dark and provocative material: psycho-sexual killers, twisted, grim, flawed detectives.

Radio Since 1992, Breckman and WFMU station manager Ken Freedman have co-hosted a weekly one-hour comedy call-in radio program, Seven Second Delay. The premise of the program seems to be a never- ending series of dead-on-arrival concepts, with the comedic value hinging on Breckman's recurring acknowledgment of failure and his desire to go home as quickly as possible. Breckman has described his co-host as \\"a sad, bitter little man and [WFMU's] fundraisers are a good time to humiliate him and exploit his willingness to do just about anything, including prostituting himself, to raise money for his adorable little public hippy noise radio station.\\" From 2009 to 2012, Seven Second Delay broadcast remotely from the Upright Citizens Brigade Theater comedy club in Manhattan. In 2011 the UCB shows went bi-weekly. Guests on the program included Dick Cavett, Joe Franklin, Amy Sedaris, Peter Stampfel, Jules Feiffer, Andrew VanWyngarden (of the band MGMT), Dan Okrent, Nora Ephron, Wallace Shawn, Jim Downey, and numerous other celebrities with whom Breckman is familiar, as well as lesser- known fringe figures, whom Breckman ridiculed on the air for not being well- known celebrities. In 1998, Gadfly Records released Death-Defying Radio Stunts, a CD of outrageous moments from Seven Second Delay studio broadcasts.

A schematic view of an idealized action potential illustrates its various phases as the action potential passes a point on a cell membrane. B. Actual recordings of action potentials are often distorted compared to the schematic view because of variations in electrophysiological techniques used to make the recording. In electrophysiology, the threshold potential is the critical level to which a membrane potential must be depolarized to initiate an action potential. In neuroscience, threshold potentials are necessary to regulate and propagate signaling in both the central nervous system (CNS) and the peripheral nervous system (PNS). Most often, the threshold potential is a membrane potential value between ‚Äì50 and ‚Äì55 mV, but can vary based upon several factors. A neuron's resting membrane potential (‚Äì70 mV) can be altered to either increase or decrease likelihood of reaching threshold via sodium and potassium ions. An influx of sodium into the cell through open, voltage-gated sodium channels can depolarize the membrane past threshold and thus excite it while an efflux of potassium or influx of chloride can hyperpolarize the cell and thus inhibit threshold from being reached. Discovery Initial experiments revolved around the concept that any electrical change that is brought about in neurons must occur through the action of ions. The German physical chemist Walther Nernst applied this concept in experiments to discover nervous excitability, and concluded that the local excitatory process through a semi-permeable membrane depends upon the ionic concentration. Also, ion concentration was shown to be the limiting factor in excitation. If the proper concentration of ions was attained, excitation would certainly occur. This was the basis for discovering the threshold value. Along with reconstructing the action potential in the 1950s, Alan Lloyd Hodgkin and Andrew Huxley were also able to experimentally determine the mechanism behind the threshold for excitation. It is known as the Hodgkin‚ÄìHuxley model. Through use of voltage clamp techniques on a squid giant axon, they discovered that excitable tissues generally exhibit the phenomenon that a certain membrane potential must be reached in order to fire an action potential. Since the experiment yielded results through the observation of ionic conductance changes, Hodgkin and Huxley used these terms to discuss the threshold potential. They initially suggested that there must be a discontinuity in the conductance of either sodium or potassium, but in reality both conductances tended to vary smoothly along with the membrane potential. They soon discovered that at threshold potential, the inward and outward currents, of sodium and potassium ions respectively, were exactly equal and opposite. As opposed to the resting membrane potential, the threshold potential's conditions exhibited a balance of currents that were unstable. Instability refers to the fact that any further depolarization activates even more voltage-gated sodium channels, and the incoming sodium depolarizing current overcomes the delayed outward current of potassium. At resting level, on the other hand, the potassium and sodium currents are equal and opposite in a stable manner, where a sudden, continuous flow of ions should not result. The basis is that at a certain level of depolarization, when the currents are equal and opposite in an unstable manner, any further entry of positive charge generates an action potential. This specific value of depolarization (in mV) is otherwise known as the threshold potential. Physiological function and characteristics The threshold value controls whether or not the incoming stimuli are sufficient to generate an action potential. It relies on a balance of incoming inhibitory and excitatory stimuli. The potentials generated by the stimuli are additive, and they may reach threshold depending on their frequency and amplitude. Normal functioning of the central nervous system entails a summation of synaptic inputs made largely onto a neuron's dendritic tree. These local graded potentials, which are primarily associated with external stimuli, reach the axon initial segment and build until they manage to reach the threshold value. The larger the stimulus, the greater the depolarization, or attempt to reach threshold. The task of depolarization requires several key steps that rely on anatomical factors of the cell. The ion conductances involved depend on the membrane potential and also the time after the membrane potential changes. =Resting membrane potential= The phospholipid bilayer of the cell membrane is, in itself, highly impermeable to ions. The complete structure of the cell membrane includes many proteins that are embedded in or completely cross the lipid bilayer. Some of those proteins allow for the highly specific passage of ions, ion channels. Leak potassium channels allow potassium to flow through the membrane in response to the disparity in concentrations of potassium inside (high concentration) and outside the cell (low). The loss of positive(+) charges of the potassium(K+) ions from the inside of the cell results in a negative potential there compared to the extracellular surface of the membrane. A much smaller \\"leak\\" of sodium(Na+) into the cell results in the actual resting potential, about ‚Äì70 mV, being less negative than the calculated potential for K+ alone, the equilibrium potential, about ‚Äì90 mV. The sodium-potassium ATPase is an active transporter within the membrane that pumps potassium (2 ions) back into the cell and sodium (3 ions) out of the cell, maintaining the concentrations of both ions as well as preserving the voltage polarization. =Depolarization= However, once a stimulus activates the voltage-gated sodium channels to open, positive sodium ions flood into the cell and the voltage increases. This process can also be initiated by ligand or neurotransmitter binding to a ligand-gated channel. More sodium is outside the cell relative to the inside, and the positive charge within the cell propels the outflow of potassium ions through delayed-rectifier voltage-gated potassium channels. Since the potassium channels within the cell membrane are delayed, any further entrance of sodium activates more and more voltage-gated sodium channels. Depolarization above threshold results in an increase in the conductance of Na sufficient for inward sodium movement to swamp outward potassium movement immediately. If the influx of sodium ions fails to reach threshold, then sodium conductance does not increase a sufficient amount to override the resting potassium conductance. In that case, subthreshold membrane potential oscillations are observed in some type of neurons. If successful, the sudden influx of positive charge depolarizes the membrane, and potassium is delayed in re-establishing, or hyperpolarizing, the cell. Sodium influx depolarizes the cell in attempt to establish its own equilibrium potential (about +52 mV) to make the inside of the cell more positive relative to the outside. =Variations= The value of threshold can vary according to numerous factors. Changes in the ion conductances of sodium or potassium can lead to either a raised or lowered value of threshold. Additionally, the diameter of the axon, density of voltage activated sodium channels, and properties of sodium channels within the axon all affect the threshold value. Typically in the axon or dendrite, there are small depolarizing or hyperpolarizing signals resulting from a prior stimulus. The passive spread of these signals depend on the passive electrical properties of the cell. The signals can only continue along the neuron to cause an action potential further down if they are strong enough to make it past the cell's membrane resistance and capacitance. For example, a neuron with a large diameter has more ionic channels in its membrane than a smaller cell, resulting in a lower resistance to the flow of ionic current. The current spreads quicker in a cell with less resistance, and is more likely to reach the threshold at other portions of the neuron. The threshold potential has also been shown experimentally to adapt to slow changes in input characteristics by regulating sodium channel density as well as inactivating these sodium channels overall. Hyperpolarization by the delayed-rectifier potassium channels causes a relative refractory period that makes it much more difficult to reach threshold. The delayed-rectifier potassium channels are responsible for the late outward phase of the action potential, where they open at a different voltage stimulus compared to the quickly activated sodium channels. They rectify, or repair, the balance of ions across the membrane by opening and letting potassium flow down its concentration gradient from inside to outside the cell. They close slowly as well, resulting in an outward flow of positive charge that exceeds the balance necessary. It results in excess negativity in the cell, requiring an extremely large stimulus and resulting depolarization to cause a response. Tracking techniques Threshold tracking techniques test nerve excitability, and depend on the properties of axonal membranes and sites of stimulation. They are extremely sensitive to the membrane potential and changes in this potential. These tests can measure and compare a control threshold (or resting threshold) to a threshold produced by a change in the environment, by a preceding single impulse, an impulse train, or a subthreshold current. Measuring changes in threshold can indicate changes in membrane potential, axonal properties, and/or the integrity of the myelin sheath. Threshold tracking allows for the strength of a test stimulus to be adjusted by a computer in order to activate a defined fraction of the maximal nerve or muscle potential. A threshold tracking experiment consists of a 1-ms stimulus being applied to a nerve in regular intervals. The action potential is recorded downstream from the triggering impulse. The stimulus is automatically decreased in steps of a set percentage until the response falls below the target (generation of an action potential). Thereafter, the stimulus is stepped up or down depending on whether the previous response was lesser or greater than the target response until a resting (or control) threshold has been established. Nerve excitability can then be changed by altering the nerve environment or applying additional currents. Since the value of a single threshold current provides little valuable information because it varies within and between subjects, pairs of threshold measurements, comparing the control threshold to thresholds produced by refractoriness, supernormality, strength-duration time constant or \\"threshold electrotonus\\" are more useful in scientific and clinical study. Tracking threshold has advantages over other electrophysiological techniques, like the constant stimulus method. This technique can track threshold changes within a dynamic range of 200% and in general give more insight into axonal properties than other tests. Also, this technique allows for changes in threshold to be given a quantitative value, which when mathematically converted into a percentage, can be used to compare single fiber and multifiber preparations, different neuronal sites, and nerve excitability in different species. =\\"Threshold electrotonus\\"= A specific threshold tracking technique is threshold electrotonus, which uses the threshold tracking set-up to produce long-lasting subthreshold depolarizing or hyperpolarizing currents within a membrane. Changes in cell excitability can be observed and recorded by creating these long-lasting currents. Threshold decrease is evident during extensive depolarization, and threshold increase is evident with extensive hyperpolarization. With hyperpolarization, there is an increase in the resistance of the internodal membrane due to closure of potassium channels, and the resulting plot \\"fans out\\". Depolarization produces has the opposite effect, activating potassium channels, producing a plot that \\"fans in\\". The most important factor determining threshold electrotonus is membrane potential, so threshold electrotonus can also be used as an index of membrane potential. Furthermore, it can be used to identify characteristics of significant medical conditions through comparing the effects of those conditions on threshold potential with the effects viewed experimentally. For example, ischemia and depolarization cause the same \\"fanning in\\" effect of the electrotonus waveforms. This observation leads to the conclusion that ischemia may result from over-activation of potassium channels. Clinical significance The role of the threshold potential has been implicated in a clinical context, namely in the functioning of the nervous system itself as well as in the cardiovascular system. =Febrile seizures= A febrile seizure, or \\"fever fit\\", is a convulsion associated with a significant rise in body temperature, occurring most commonly in early childhood. Repeated episodes of childhood febrile seizures are associated with an increased risk of temporal lobe epilepsy in adulthood. With patch clamp recording, an analogous state was replicated in vitro in rat cortical neurons after induction of febrile body temperatures; a notable decrease in threshold potential was observed. The mechanism for this decrease possibly involves suppression of inhibition mediated by the GABAB receptor with excessive heat exposure. =ALS and diabetes= Abnormalities in neuronal excitability have been noted in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and diabetes patients. While the mechanism ultimately responsible for the variance differs between the two conditions, tests through a response to ischemia indicate a similar resistance, ironically, to ischemia and resulting paresthesias. As ischemia occurs through inhibition of the sodium-potassium pump, abnormalities in the threshold potential are hence implicated. =Arrythmia= Since the 1940s, the concept of diastolic depolarization, or \\"pacemaker potential\\", has become established; this mechanism is a characteristic distinctive of cardiac tissue. When the threshold is reached and the resulting action potential fires, a heartbeat results from the interactions; however, when this heartbeat occurs at an irregular time, a potentially serious condition known as arrythmia may result. Use of medications A variety of drugs can present prolongation of the QT interval as a side effect. Prolongation of this interval is a result of a delay in sodium and calcium channel inactivation; without proper channel inactivation, the threshold potential is reached prematurely and thus arrhythmia tends to result. These drugs, known as pro-arrhythmic agents, include antimicrobials, antipsychotics, methadone, and, ironically, antiarrhythmic agents. The use of such agents is particularly frequent in intensive care units, and special care must be exercised when QT intervals are prolonged in such patients: arrhythmias as a result of prolonged QT intervals include the potentially fatal torsades de pointes, or TdP. Role of diet Diet may be a variable in the risk of arrhythmia. Polyunsaturated fatty acids, found in fish oils and several plant oils, serve a role in the prevention of arrhythmias. By inhibiting the voltage-dependent sodium current, these oils shift the threshold potential to a more positive value; therefore, an action potential requires increased depolarization. Clinically therapeutic use of these extracts remains a subject of research, but a strong correlation is established between regular consumption of fish oil and lower frequency of hospitalization for atrial fibrillation, a severe and increasingly common arrythmia.

Wings 3D is named after the winged-edge data structure it uses internally to store coordinate and adjacency data, and is commonly referred to by its users simply as Wings. Wings 3D is available for Windows, Linux, and Mac OS X, using the Erlang environment. Overview Wings 3D can be used to model and texture low to mid-range polygon models. Wings does not support animations and has only basic OpenGL rendering facilities, although it can export to external rendering software such as POV-Ray and YafRay. Wings is often used in combination with other software, whereby models made in Wings are exported to applications more specialized in rendering and animation such as Blender. Interface Wings 3D uses context-sensitive menus as opposed to a highly graphical, icon-oriented interface. Modeling is done using the mouse and keyboard to select and modify different aspects of a model's geometry in four different selection modes: Vertex, Edge, Face and Body. Because of Wings's context-sensitive design, each selection mode has its own set of mesh tools. Many of these tools offer both basic and advanced uses, allowing users to specify vectors and points to change how a tool will affect their model. Wings also allows users to add textures and materials to models, and has built-in AutoUV mapping facilities.

It electrically connects the atria and ventricles. The AV node lies at the lower back section of the interatrial septum near the opening of the coronary sinus, and conducts the normal electrical impulse from the atria to the ventricles. The AV node is quite compact (~1 x 3 x 5 mm).Full Size Picture triangle of-Koch.jpg. Retrieved on 2008-12-22 Structure =Location= The AV node lies at the lower back section of the interatrial septum near the opening of the coronary sinus, which conducts the normal electrical impulse from the atria to the ventricles. The AV node is quite compact (~1 x 3 x 5 mm). It is located at the center of Koch's triangle‚Äîa triangle enclosed by the septal leaflet of the tricuspid valve, the coronary sinus, and the membranous part of the interatrial septum.Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine, 17e‚Äù Section 3: Disorders of Rhythm =Blood supply= The blood supply of the AV node is from the atrioventricular nodal branch. The origin of this artery is most commonly (80-90% of hearts) a branch of the right coronary artery, with the remainder originating from the left circumflex artery. This is associated with the dominance of the coronary artery circulation. In right-dominant individuals the blood supply is from the right coronary artery while in left dominant individuals it originates from the left circumflex artery. =Development= BMP (Bone morphogenetic protein) cell signaling plays a key role in diverse aspects of cardiac differentiation and morphogenesis. (BMPs) are multifunctional signaling molecules critical for the development of AV node. BMP influences AV node development through Alk3 receptor (Activin receptor-like kinase 3). Abnormalities seen in BMP and Alk3 are associated with some cardiovascular diseases like Ebstein‚Äôs anomaly and AV conduction disease. Function heart conduction system showing atrioventricular node The AV node receives two inputs from the right atrium: posteriorly, via the crista terminalis, and anteriorly, via the interatrial septum. Contraction of heart muscle cells requires depolarization and repolarization of their cell membranes. Movement of ions across cell membranes causes these events. The cardiac conduction system (and AV node part of it) coordinates myocyte mechanical activity. A wave of excitation spreads out from the sinoatrial node through the atria along specialized conduction channels. This activates the AV node. The atrioventricular node delays impulses by approximately 0.09s. This delay in the cardiac pulse is extremely important: It ensures that the atria have ejected their blood into the ventricles first before the ventricles contract.Campbell, N., & Reece, J. (2002). Biology. 6th ed. San Francisco: Benjamin Cummings This also protects the ventricles from excessively fast rate response to atrial arrhythmias (see below). AV conduction during normal cardiac rhythm occurs through two different pathways: *the first ‚Äúpathway‚Äù has a slow conduction velocity but shorter refractory period *the second ‚Äúpathway‚Äù has a faster conduction velocity but longer refractory period. An important property that is unique to the AV node is decremental conduction, in which the more frequently the node is stimulated the slower it conducts. This is the property of the AV node that prevents rapid conduction to the ventricle in cases of rapid atrial rhythms, such as atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter. The AV node's normal intrinsic firing rate without stimulation (such as that from the SA node) is 40-60 times/minute. This property is important because loss of the conduction system before the AV node should still result in pacing of the ventricles by the ‚Äî slower ‚Äî pacemaking ability of the AV node. Clinical significance * Atrioventricular conduction disease (AV block) describes impairment of the electrical continuity between the atria and ventricles. It occurs when the atrial depolarization fail to reach the ventricles or is conducted with an abnormally long delay. It can result from an injury or be a genetically inherited disorder. * Atrioventricular nodal re- entry tachycardia. * Cystic tumour of atrioventricular nodal region (CTAVN) CTAVN is of endodermal origin and occurs exclusively in the area of the AV node, tricuspid valve, and interatrial septum.

Berrigan's active protest against the Vietnam War earned him both scorn and admiration, especially regarding his association with the Catonsville Nine. It also landed him on the Federal Bureau of Investigation's \\"most wanted list\\" (the first-ever priest on the list),https://www.economist.com/news/obituary/21699058-first-ever-priest-fbis- most-wanted-list-died-april-30th-aged-94-obituary-daniel on the cover of Time magazine, and in prison. For the rest of his life, Berrigan remained one of the United States' leading anti-war activists. In 1980, he founded the Plowshares movement, an anti-nuclear protest group, that put him back into the national spotlight. He was also an award-winning and prolific author of some 50 books, a teacher, and a university educator. Early life Berrigan was born in Virginia, Minnesota, the son of Frieda Berrigan (n√©e Fromhart), who was of German descent, and Thomas Berrigan, a second-generation Irish Catholic and active trade union member. He was the fifth of six sons. His youngest brother was fellow peace activist Philip Berrigan. At age 5, Berrigan's family moved to Syracuse, New York. In 1946, Berrigan earned a bachelor's degree from St. Andrew-on-Hudson, a Jesuit seminary in Hyde Park, New York. In 1952 he received a master's degree from Woodstock College in Baltimore, Maryland. Berrigan was devoted to the Catholic Church throughout his youth. He joined the Jesuits directly out of high school in 1939 and was ordained to the priesthood on June 19, 1952. Career Berrigan taught at St. Peter's Preparatory School in Jersey City from 1946 to 1949. In 1954, Berrigan was assigned to teach French and theology at the Jesuit Brooklyn Preparatory School. In 1957 he was appointed professor of New Testament studies at Le Moyne College in Syracuse, New York. The same year, he won the Lamont Prize for his book of poems, Time Without Number. He developed a reputation as a religious radical, working actively against poverty and on changing the relationship between priests and lay people. While at Le Moyne, he founded its International House. While on a sabbatical from Le Moyne in 1963, Berrigan traveled to Paris and met French Jesuits who criticized the social and political conditions in Indochina. Taking inspiration from this, he and his brother Philip founded the Catholic Peace Fellowship, a group that organized protests against the war in Vietnam. On October 28, 1965, Berrigan, along with the Rev. Richard John Neuhaus and Rabbi Abraham Joshua Heschel, founded an organization known as Clergy and Laymen Concerned About Vietnam (CALCAV). The organization, founded at the Church Center for the United Nations, was joined by the likes of Dr. Hans Morgenthau, Dr. Reinhold Niebuhr, Rev. William Sloane Coffin, and the Rev. Philip Berrigan, among many others. The Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., who delivered his 1967 speech Beyond Vietnam: A Time to Break Silence under sponsorship from CALCAV, served as the national co-chairman of the organization. From 1966 to 1970, Berrigan was the assistant director of the Cornell University United Religious Work (CURW), the umbrella organization for all religious groups on campus, including the Cornell Newman Club (later the Cornell Catholic Community), eventually becoming the group's pastor. Berrigan was the first faculty advisor of Cornell University's first gay rights student group, the Student Homophile League, in 1968. Berrigan at one time or another held faculty positions or ran programs at Union Theological Seminary, Loyola University New Orleans, Columbia, Cornell, and Yale. His longest tenure was at Fordham (a Jesuit university located in the Bronx), where for a brief time he also served as poet-in-residence. Berrigan appeared briefly in the 1986 Warner Bros. film The Mission, playing a Jesuit priest. He also served as a consultant on the film.  Activism  = Vietnam War era = Berrigan, his brother and Josephite priest Philip Berrigan, and Trappist monk Thomas Merton founded an interfaith coalition against the Vietnam War and wrote letters to major newspapers arguing for an end to the war. In 1967, Berrigan witnessed the public outcry that followed from the arrest of his brother Philip, for pouring blood on draft records as part of the Baltimore Four.Religion and War Resistance in the Plowshares Movement (2008) Sharon Erickson Nepstad, Cambridge University Press, p48 Philip was sentenced to six years in prison for defacing government property. The fallout he had to endure from these many interventions, including his support for prisoners of war and, in 1968, seeing firsthand the conditions on the ground in Vietnam,http://libguides.depaul.edu/ld.php?content_id=10135847 further radicalized Berrigan, or at least strengthened his determination to resist American military imperialism. Berrigan traveled to Hanoi with Howard Zinn during the Tet Offensive in January 1968 to \\"receive\\" three American airmen, the first American prisoners of war released by the North Vietnamese since the U.S. bombing of that nation had begun.; new ed. 2002 In 1968, he signed the Writers and Editors War Tax Protest pledge, vowing to refuse to make tax payments in protest of the Vietnam War. In the same year, he was interviewed in the anti-Vietnam War documentary film In the Year of the Pig, and later that year became involved in radical non-violent protest. Catonsville Nine Daniel Berrigan and his brother Philip, along with seven other Catholic protesters, used homemade napalm to destroy 378 draft files in the parking lot of the Catonsville, Maryland, draft board on May 17, 1968. This group, which came to be known as the Catonsville Nine, issued a statement after the incident: Berrigan was arrested and sentenced to three years in prison, but went into hiding with the help of fellow radicals prior to imprisonment. While on the run, Berrigan was interviewed for Lee Lockwood's documentary The Holy Outlaw. The Federal Bureau of Investigation apprehended him on August 11, 1970 at the home of William Stringfellow and Anthony Towne. Berrigan was then imprisoned at the Federal Correctional Institution in Danbury, Connecticut until his release on February 24, 1972. In retrospect, the trial of the Catonsville Nine was significant, because it \\"altered resistance to the Vietnam War, moving activists from street protests to repeated acts of civil disobedience, including the burning of draft cards.\\" As The New York Times noted in its obituary, Berrigan's actions helped \\"shape the tactics of opposition to the Vietnam War.\\" =Plowshares movement= Daniel Berrigan is arrested for civil disobedience outside the U.S. Mission to the U.N. in 2006 On September 9, 1980, Berrigan, his brother Philip, and six others (the \\"Plowshares Eight\\") began the Plowshares movement. They trespassed onto the General Electric nuclear missile facility in King of Prussia, Pennsylvania, where they damaged nuclear warhead nose cones and poured blood onto documents and files. They were arrested and charged with over ten different felony and misdemeanor counts. On April 10, 1990, after ten years of appeals, Berrigan's group was re-sentenced and paroled for up to months in consideration of time already served in prison. Their legal battle was re- created in Emile de Antonio's 1982 film In the King of Prussia, which starred Martin Sheen and featured appearances by the Plowshares Eight as themselves. = Consistent life ethic = Berrigan endorsed a consistent life ethic, a morality based on a holistic reverence for life. As a member of the Rochester, New York-area consistent life ethic advocacy group Faith and Resistance Community, he protested via civil disobedience against abortion at a new Planned Parenthood clinic in 1991. =AIDS activism= Berrigan said of pastoral care to AIDS patients: Berrigan published Sorrow Built a Bridge: Friendship and AIDS reflecting on his experiences ministering to AIDS patients through the Supportive Care Program at St. Vincent's Hospital and Medical Center in 1989. The Religious Studies Review wrote, \\"the strength of this volume lies in its capacity to portray sensitively the impact of AIDS on human lives.\\" Speaking about AIDS patients, many of whom were gay, The Charlotte Observer quoted Berrigan saying in 1991, \\"Both the church and the state are finding ways to kill people with AIDS, and one of the ways is ostracism that pushes people between the cracks of respectability or acceptability and leaves them there to make of life what they will or what they cannot.\\" =Other activism= Berrigan and his niece, Frida Berrigan, at the Witness Against Torture event held in NYC's Lower East Side on December 18, 2008 Although much of his later work was devoted to assisting AIDS patients in New York City, Berrigan still held to his activist roots throughout his life. He maintained his opposition to American interventions abroad, from Central America in the 1980s, through the Gulf War in 1991, the Kosovo War, the U.S. invasion of Afghanistan, and the 2003 invasion of Iraq. He was also an opponent of capital punishment, a contributing editor of Sojourners, and a supporter of the Occupy movement. Berrigan has been considered by many to be a Christian anarchist.

Cengage Learning; 1 January 2016. . p. 129‚Äì.) is a collection of heart muscle cells specialized for electrical conduction. As part of the electrical conduction system of the heart, it transmits the electrical impulses from the AV node (located between the atria and the ventricles) to the point of the apex of the fascicular branches via the bundle branches. The fascicular branches then lead to the Purkinje fibers, which provide electrical conduction to the ventricles, causing the cardiac muscle of the ventricles to contract at a paced interval. Function The bundle of His is an important part of the electrical conduction system of the heart, as it transmits impulses from the atrioventricular node, located at the anterior-inferior end of the interatrial septum, to the ventricles of the heart. The bundle of His branches into the left and the right bundle branches, which run along the interventricular septum. The left bundle branch further divides into the left anterior and the left posterior fascicles. These bundles and fascicles give rise to thin filaments known as Purkinje fibers. These fibers distribute the impulse to the ventricular muscle. The ventricular conduction system comprises the bundle branches and the Purkinje networks. It takes about 0.03‚Äì0.04 seconds for the impulse to travel from the bundle of His to the ventricular muscle. Clinical significance Disorders affecting the cardiomyocytes that make up the electrical conduction system of the heart are called heart blocks. Heart blocks are separated into different categories based on the location of the cellular damage. Damage to any of the conducting cells in or below the bundle of His is collectively referred to as \\"infra- Hisian blocks\\". To be specific, blocks that occur in the right or left bundle branches are called \\"bundle branch blocks\\", and those that occur in either the left anterior or the left posterior fascicles are called \\"fascicular blocks\\", or \\"hemiblocks\\". The conditions in which both the right bundle branch and either the left anterior fascicle or the left posterior fascicle are blocked are collectively referred to as bifascicular blocks, and the condition in which the right bundle branch, the left anterior fascicle, and the left posterior fascicle are blocked is called trifascicular block. Infra-hisian blocks limit the heart's ability to coordinate the activities of the atria and ventricles, which usually results in a decrease in its efficiency in pumping blood. =Pacing= A 2000 study found that direct His bundle pacing is more effective in producing synchronized ventricular contraction‚Äîand therefore in improving cardiac function‚Äîthan apical pacing. Etymology These specialized muscle fibers in the heart were named after the Swiss cardiologist Wilhelm His Jr., who discovered them in 1893.

Commentary Rat bite fever is caused by either Streptobacillus moniliformis or Spirillum minor. The incidence of rat-bite fever is highest in urban areas with poor sanitation where the rat population is high, however in recent times cases have also been attributed to occupational contact with rodents such as pet shop employees or laboratory workers or through pet ownership. While the disease is usually caused by a bite, it can also occur from close contact with rodents or ingestion of contaminated food or water. The latter is known as Haverhill fever. The disease typically presents with chills and fever accompanied by headache, vomiting, and muscle pain. A rash and arthritis develop 2‚Äì4 days after the initial onset. Less commonly the infection can cause pneumonitis, endocarditis or meningitis. As these symptoms are common to many febrile diseases, this is often classified as a fever of unknown origin (FUO).

Biography  Born in Hartlepool in the fortieth year of Queen Victoria's reign, she lived under the rule of five more monarchs and 24 UK Prime Ministers. Hughes grew up in Middlesbrough in Yorkshire, where her father ran a music shop. She worked as a teacher in a primary school from the age of thirteen and married Noel Hughes, a retired army captain, after she retired aged 63. They remained married until Noel's death in 1979 at the age of 88. Her father, Herbert Milburn, died at age 93 and her mother, Annie, at 92. She had three younger brothers, Herbert, Henry and Reginald. Herbert died at 58 and Reginald at 62. She remained in robust health into extreme old age and achieved public recognition for her longevity, including tea with then-UK Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, in 1985, whom she jokingly admonished against cuddling up to her, as Hughes was a Labour Party supporter. Thatcher replied by saying \\"Oh well, never mind, let's have a cup of tea.\\" However, Hughes admitted to personally liking Thatcher, and described the Prime Minister as \\"A very nice woman.\\" For her one-hundred and tenth birthday, she flew on Concorde to New York City, one of only two supercentenarian air passengers ever recorded. She stayed at The Waldorf-Astoria Hotel for four days on an all-expenses paid visit and met then-Mayor Ed Koch. She became the oldest person in the United Kingdom when Scotland's Kate Begbie died in 1988, and broke the national longevity record, held until then by Anna Eliza Williams, in early-1992. Hughes lived in her own home in Marske-by-the-Sea until 1991, when she moved to a nursing home in Redcar due to her becoming too frail to look after herself. She also spent her final years in a wheelchair, though she remained mentally alert and sharp to the end of her life. She was described by relatives as \\"extremely domineering, outspoken, and sharp; but also as friendly and witty.\\" Hughes was never interviewed by demographers or other aging researchers, though the historian Peter Laslett went through the documentation pertaining to her case.

In 1972, he began studying political science and public administration at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. Gillon is married to Sari. He has three children and five grandchildren. Shin Bet career In 1972, Gillon was recruited by Shin Bet during his university studies. He initially worked as a bodyguard for senior staff. From 1982 to 1987, he was chief of the Shin Bet Jewish Department. From 1987 to 1989, he attended the National Security College, serving in a number of senior positions during his studies for an MA in political science and public administration. From 1989, he was chief of the Training Division. From 1990, he was chief of the Shin Bet Northern Command, a position in which he was responsible for Shin Bet activity in Lebanon. From 1993 to 1994, he was chief of the Administrative Division, responsible for HR, finances, and logistics. For four months in 1994, he was Shin Bet acting director during Yaakov Peri‚Äôs academic leave. From March 1995 to February 1996, Gillon was the director of Shin Bet. B'Tselem, Human Rights Watch, and other human rights organizations have criticized his oversight. \\"During his tenure, and until the Israel High Court of Justice ruled against such methods in 1999, GSS interrogators were officially sanctioned to use 'moderate physical pressure' on detainees (the vast majority of them Palestinians),\\" according to Amnesty International. From October 1994, when a suicide bomb killed 23 people, they were allowed to use \\"increased physical pressure\\". Secret government guidelines set down what \\"moderate physical pressure\\" and \\"increased physical pressure\\" allowed; according to court testimonies of GSS members themselves, this included subjecting detainees to sleep deprivation, prolonged shackling in painful positions, hooding with filthy sacks, being forced to squat like a frog (gambaz) and violent shaking (tiltul). During Carmi Gillon's period of service with the GSS such methods of interrogation were used against several hundred Palestinian detainees every year, many of whom were later released without charge.Amnesty International calls on Denmark to fulfil its obligations under the UN Convention against Torture 14 August 2001, AI Index MDE 15/074/2001 - News Service Nr. 143 In 1995, the Shin Bet's VIP protection unit failed to prevent the assassination of Prime Minister Rabin. Gillon had been in Paris at the time of the assassination, and upon returning to Israel, immediately submitted his resignation to Acting Prime Minister Shimon Peres, who rejected it. Nevertheless, he resigned the following year. The Shamgar Commission was critical of the Shin Bet under his tenure. Private sector After leaving the service, Gillon served as general manager of the Avner Insurance Company (1997‚Äì2000) and then as director general of the Peres Center for Peace (2000‚Äì2001). He also studied at Harvard Business School. Ambassador to Denmark From 2001 to 2003, he was the Israeli ambassador to Denmark. When he was nominated for the position in 2001, Human Rights Watch called for the Danish government to reject his appointmentLetter to Danish Minister of Foreign Affairs Mogens Lykketoft, Human Rights Watch 18 July 2001 and for Israel to withdraw his nomination, while Amnesty International asked the Danish authorities to investigate him for torture, and if there was enough evidence for a prosecution, to detain him under the UN Convention against Torture, and to either try him or extradite him to a state willing to try him. Danish Justice Minister Frank Jensen initially said that Gillon could be arrested and prosecuted under the terms of the Convention after he admitted using \\"moderate physical pressure\\" on Palestinian detainees,Sharon 'preparing war crimes defence', BBC News 26 July 2001 but later backed down, acknowledging that as an ambassador, Gillon was protected by diplomatic immunity. Gillon defended the use of torture as a means of \\"self-defense against terrorism.\\" He told Danish media that Israel might have to re- introduce \\"moderate physical pressure\\" when interrogating suspected Palestinian terrorists. \\"We banned this form of interrogation in Israel in 1999 because of the peace process. Unfortunately, it looks like we may have to start using it again,\\" Gillon said. One member of parliament, Centre Democrat leader Peter Duetoft, called opposition to Gillon's appointment \\"hypocritical\\" because Yasser Arafat, \\"the biggest terrorist\\", had recently visited Denmark without there having been similar objections.Something rotten in Denmark , by Ellis Shuman, Israel Insider 26 July 2001 In January 2014, Gillon arrived in Denmark to attend the Copenhagen Film Festival for a screening of The Gatekeepers and to deliver a lecture. After a Danish anti-torture NGO reported Gillon to the police for torture, Gillon left Denmark on January 10. The Prosecutor's Office subsequently rejected the complaint due to lack of evidence.https://www.timesofisrael.com/former-shin-bet-head-leaves-denmark- over-torture-complaint/Tortur Anklaget Eksdiplomat forlader Danmark, Politiken, 11 January 2014 Politics and other activities From 2003 to 2007, he was elected head of the Mevasseret Zion local council. From 2007 to 2013, he was vice president for external relations for Hebrew University of Jerusalem. Gillon has been a member of a number of boards of directors, including the Tahal Group, Danker Investment, and the Arab Israel Bank. From 2014, he was chairman and CEO of Carmi Gillon Inc., chairman of CYTEGIC, and external director of the Dan Hotels chain.Carmi Gillon -- CV, http://www.carmigillon.com/#!resume/galleryPage, accessed 5 May 2015 Over the years, Gillon has written several books and a range of articles on the subjects of foreign affairs and security.

Blue = troponin C; green = troponin I; magenta = troponin T.; ; rendered with PyMOL Troponin, or the troponin complex, is a complex of three regulatory proteins (troponin C, troponin I, and troponin T) that are integral to muscle contraction in skeletal muscle and cardiac muscle, but not smooth muscle. Measurements of cardiac-specific troponins I and T are extensively used as diagnostic and prognostic indicators in the management of myocardial infarction and acute coronary syndrome. Blood troponin levels may be used as a diagnostic marker for stroke, although the sensitivity of this measurement is low. Function Troponin is attached to the protein tropomyosin and lies within the groove between actin filaments in muscle tissue. In a relaxed muscle, tropomyosin blocks the attachment site for the myosin crossbridge, thus preventing contraction. When the muscle cell is stimulated to contract by an action potential, calcium channels open in the sarcoplasmic membrane and release calcium into the sarcoplasm. Some of this calcium attaches to troponin, which causes it to change shape, exposing binding sites for myosin (active sites) on the actin filaments. Myosin's binding to actin causes crossbridge formation, and contraction of the muscle begins. Troponin activation. Troponin C (red) binds Ca2+, which stabilizes the activated state, where troponin I (yellow) is no longer bound to actin. Troponin T (blue) anchors the complex on tropomyosin. Troponin is found in both skeletal muscle and cardiac muscle, but the specific versions of troponin differ between types of muscle. The main difference is that the TnC subunit of troponin in skeletal muscle has four calcium ion-binding sites, whereas in cardiac muscle there are only three. The actual amount of calcium that binds to troponin has not been definitively established. Physiology In both cardiac and skeletal muscles, muscular force production is controlled primarily by changes in the intracellular calcium concentration. In general, when calcium rises, the muscles contract and, when calcium falls, the muscles relax. Troponin is a component of thin filaments (along with actin and tropomyosin), and is the protein complex to which calcium binds to trigger the production of muscular force. Troponin itself has three subunits, TnC, TnI, and TnT, each playing a role in force regulation . Under resting intracellular levels of calcium, tropomyosin covers the active sites on actin to which myosin (a molecular motor organized in muscle thick filaments) binds in order to generate force. When calcium becomes bound to specific sites in the N-domain of TnC, a series of protein structural changes occurs such that tropomyosin is rolled away from myosin-binding sites on actin, allowing myosin to attach to the thin filament and produce force and shorten the sarcomere. Individual subunits serve different functions: * Troponin C binds to calcium ions to produce a conformational change in TnI * Troponin T binds to tropomyosin, interlocking them to form a troponin-tropomyosin complex * Troponin I binds to actin in thin myofilaments to hold the actin-tropomyosin complex in place Smooth muscle does not have troponin. =Subunits= TnT is a tropomyosin-binding subunit which regulates the interaction of troponin complex with thin filaments; TnI inhibits ATP-ase activity of acto-myosin; TnC is a Ca2+-binding subunit, playing the main role in Ca2+ dependent regulation of muscle contraction. TnT and TnI in cardiac muscle are presented by forms different from those in skeletal muscles. Two isoforms of TnI and two isoforms of TnT are expressed in human skeletal muscle tissue (skTnI and skTnT). Only one tissue-specific isoform of TnI is described for cardiac muscle tissue (cTnI), whereas the existence of several cardiac specific isoforms of TnT (cTnT) are described in the literature. No cardiac specific isoforms are known for human TnC. TnC in human cardiac muscle tissue is presented by an isoform typical for slow skeletal muscle. Another form of TnC, fast skeletal TnC isoform, is more typical for fast skeletal muscles. cTnI is expressed only in myocardium. No examples of cTnI expression in healthy or injured skeletal muscle or in other tissue types are known. cTnT is probably less cardiac specific. Expression of cTnT in skeletal tissue of patients with chronic skeletal muscle injuries has been described. Inside the cardiac troponin complex the strongest interaction between molecules has been demonstrated for cTnI ‚Äì TnC binary complex especially in the presence of Ca2+ ( KA = 1.5x10‚àí8 M‚àí1). TnC, forming a complex with cTnI, changes the conformation of cTnI molecule and shields part of its surface. According to the latest data cTnI is released in the blood stream of the patient in the form of binary complex with TnC or ternary complex with cTnT and TnC. cTnI-TnC complex formation plays an important positive role in improving the stability of cTnI molecule. cTnI, which is extremely unstable in its free form, demonstrates significantly better stability in complex with TnC or in ternary cTnI-cTnT-TnC complex. It has been demonstrated that stability of cTnI in native complex is significantly better than stability of the purified form of the protein or the stability of cTnI in artificial troponin complexes combined from purified proteins. Research =Cardiac conditions= Certain subtypes of troponin (cardiac I and T) are sensitive and specific indicators of damage to the heart muscle (myocardium). They are measured in the blood to differentiate between unstable angina and myocardial infarction (heart attack) in people with chest pain or acute coronary syndrome. A person who recently had a myocardial infarction would have an area of damaged heart muscle and elevated cardiac troponin levels in the blood. This can also occur in people with coronary vasospasm, a type of myocardial infarction involving severe constriction of the cardiac blood vessels. After a myocardial infarction troponins may remain high for up to 2 weeks. Cardiac troponins are a marker of all heart muscle damage, not just myocardial infarction, which is the most severe form of heart disorder. However, diagnostic criteria for raised troponin indicating myocardial infarction is currently set by the WHO at a threshold of 2 Œºg or higher. Critical levels of other cardiac biomarkers are also relevant, such as creatine kinase. Other conditions that directly or indirectly lead to heart muscle damage and death can also increase troponin levels, such as kidney failure. Severe tachycardia (for example due to supraventricular tachycardia) in an individual with normal coronary arteries can also lead to increased troponins for example, it is presumed due to increased oxygen demand and inadequate supply to the heart muscle. Troponins are also increased in patients with heart failure, where they also predict mortality and ventricular rhythm abnormalities. They can rise in inflammatory conditions such as myocarditis and pericarditis with heart muscle involvement (which is then termed myopericarditis). Troponins can also indicate several forms of cardiomyopathy, such as dilated cardiomyopathy, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy or (left) ventricular hypertrophy, peripartum cardiomyopathy, Takotsubo cardiomyopathy, or infiltrative disorders such as cardiac amyloidosis. Heart injury with increased troponins also occurs in cardiac contusion, defibrillation and internal or external cardioversion. Troponins are commonly increased in several procedures such as cardiac surgery and heart transplantation, closure of atrial septal defects, percutaneous coronary intervention, or radiofrequency ablation. =Non-cardiac conditions= The distinction between cardiac and non-cardiac conditions is somewhat artificial; the conditions listed below are not primary heart diseases, but they exert indirect effects on the heart muscle. Troponins are increased in around 40% of patients with critical illnesses such as sepsis. There is an increased risk of mortality and length of stay in the intensive-care unit in these patients. In severe gastrointestinal bleeding, there can also be a mismatch between oxygen demand and supply of the myocardium. Chemotherapy agents can exert toxic effects on the heart (examples include anthracycline, cyclophosphamide, 5-fluorouracil, and cisplatin). Several toxins and venoms can also lead to heart muscle injury (scorpion venom, snake venom, and venom from jellyfish and centipedes). Carbon monoxide poisoning or cyanide poisoning can also be accompanied by release of troponins due to hypoxic cardiotoxic effects. Cardiac injury occurs in about one-third of severe CO poisoning cases, and troponin screening is appropriate in these patients. In both primary pulmonary hypertension, pulmonary embolism, and acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), right ventricular strain results in increased wall tension and may cause ischemia. Of course, patients with COPD exacerbations might also have concurrent myocardial infarction or pulmonary embolism, so care has to be taken to attribute increased troponin levels to COPD. People with end-stage kidney disease can have chronically elevated troponin T levels, which are linked to a poorer prognosis. Troponin I is less likely to be falsely elevated. Strenuous endurance exercise such as marathons or triathlons can lead to increased troponin levels in up to one-third of subjects, but it is not linked to adverse health effects in these competitors. High troponin T levels have also been reported in patients with inflammatory muscle diseases such as polymyositis or dermatomyositis. Troponins are also increased in rhabdomyolysis. In hypertensive disorders of pregnancy such as preeclampsia, elevated troponin levels indicate some degree of myofibrillary damage. Cardiac troponin T and I can be used to monitor drug and toxin-induced cardiomyocyte toxicity. . In 2020, it was found that COVID-19 patients with severe disease had higher troponin I levels compared to those with milder disease. =Prognostic use= Elevated troponin levels are prognostically important in many of the conditions in which they are used for diagnosis. In a community-based cohort study indicating the importance of silent cardiac damage, troponin I has been shown to predict mortality and first coronary heart disease event in men free from cardiovascular disease at baseline. In people with stroke, elevated blood troponin levels are not a useful marker to detect the condition. =Subunits= First cTnI and later cTnT were originally used as markers for cardiac cell death. Both proteins are now widely used to diagnose acute myocardial infarction (AMI), unstable angina, post-surgery myocardium trauma and some other diseases related with cardiac muscle injury. Both markers can be detected in patient's blood 3‚Äì6 hours after onset of the chest pain, reaching peak level within 16‚Äì30 hours. Elevated concentration of cTnI and cTnT in blood samples can be detected even 5‚Äì8 days after onset of the symptoms, making both proteins useful also for the late diagnosis of AMI. Detection Cardiac troponin T and I are measured by immunoassay methods. * Due to patent regulations, a single manufacturer (Roche Diagnostics) distributes cTnT. * A host of diagnostic companies make cTnI immunoassay methods available on many different immunoassay platforms.https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fvets.2020.00531/abstract Troponin elevation following cardiac cell necrosis starts within 2‚Äì3 hours, peaks in approx. 24 hours, and persists for 1‚Äì2 weeks.

Broadly stated, RMA claims that in certain periods of the history of humankind, there were new military doctrines, strategies, tactics and technologies which led to an irrecoverable change in the conduct of warfare. Furthermore, those changes compel an accelerated adaptation of novel doctrines and strategies. In the United States, RMA is often linked to discussions such as the reorganization plan of the United States Army and total systems integration. History The original theorizing was done by the Soviet Armed Forces in the 1970s and 1980s, particularly by Marshal Nikolai Ogarkov.Steven Metz, James Kievit. \\"Strategy and the Revolution in Military Affairs: From Theory to Policy\\" June 27, 1995 The United States initially became interested in it through Andrew Marshall, the head of the Office of Net Assessment, a Department of Defense think tank. It slowly gained credence within official military circles, and other nations began exploring similar shifts in organization and technology. Interest in RMA and the structure of future U.S. armed forces is strong within China's People's Liberation Army and it has been incorporated into China's strategic military doctrine. Many other militaries have also researched and considered RMA as an organizational concept‚Äîe.g., those of Canada, United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Sweden, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, Singapore, Republic of China (Taiwan), India, Russia, and Germany‚Äîbut not all militaries have adopted RMA, due to its significant infrastructure and investment costs. = Soviet views = Nikolai Ogarkov called the early idea of RMA the Military Technological Revolution (MTR). Pentagon officials in the United States changed the name of his original idea, which is how it became known as RMA. Orgarkov's belief that the potential and possibility for new weapons was increasing rapidly led to the development of his initial idea. At the time of the initial development of MTR, the Soviets anticipated that certain technologies, including energy weapons and robots, would be in use by 2015 at the latest. They believed that the use of large ground forces would be minimized. In place of some ground forces, these new technologies would be implemented in order to establish dominance on the battlefield. Russians also believed that control of space would become essential for maintaining dominance in future conflicts. Soviets believed that it would be essential to control the satellite space around earth, in order to more effectively relay information. They also anticipated the ability to use space as a medium in which they could deploy weapons. = Renewed interest = The United States' victory in the 1991 Gulf War renewed interest in RMA theory. In the view of RMA proponents, American dominance through superior technology emphasized how the United States' technological advances reduced the relative power of the Iraqi military, by no means a lightweight rival, to insignificance. According to Stephen Biddle, part of the growth in popularity of the RMA theory after the Gulf War was that virtually all American military experts drastically over-estimated the coalition casualty count. This led many experts to assume that their models of war were wrong‚Äîthat a revolution of sorts had occurred. After the Kosovo War, in which the United States did not lose a single life, others suggested that war had become too sterile, creating a \\"virtual war\\". Furthermore, the United States‚Äô inability to capture Osama bin Laden or effectively combat the Iraqi insurgency led some to question RMA in the face of asymmetrical warfare, in which foes of the United States may increasingly engage in order to counter RMA's advantages. In 1997, the U.S. Army mounted an exercise codenamed \\"Force 21\\", to test the application of digital technologies in warfare in order to improve communications and logistics by applying private-sector technologies adapted for military use. Specifically, it sought to increase awareness of one's position on the battlefield as well as that of the enemy, in order to achieve increased lethality, greater control of the tempo of warfare, and fewer instances of friendly fire via improved identification friend or foe.The United States Army 1995 Modernization Plan. Force 21 In 2002, Chris Bray described RMA as new ideas about \\"the use of information and automation on the battlefield\\" to make forces \\"more lethal\\" and \\"more agile.\\" Areas of focus One of the central problems in understanding the current debate over RMA arises from many theorists' use of the term to refer to the revolutionary technology itself, which is the driving force of change. Concurrently, other theorists tend to use the term as referring to revolutionary adaptations by military organisations that may be necessary to deal with the changes in technology. Other theorists place RMA more closely inside the specific political and economic context of globalization and the end of the Cold War. When reviewing the gamut of theories, three fundamental versions of RMA come to the forefront. The first perspective focuses primarily upon changes in the nation-state and the role of an organised military in using force. This approach highlights the political, social, and economic factors worldwide, which might require a completely different type of military and organisational structure to apply force in the future. Authors such as the RAND Corporation's Sean J. A. Edwards (advocate of BattleSwarm tactics, a type of military swarming), Carl H. Builder and Lt. Col. Ralph Peters emphasized the decline of the nation-state, the nature of the emerging international order, and the different types of forces needed in the near future. The second perspective‚Äîmost commonly assigned the term RMA‚Äîhighlights the evolution of weapons technology, information technology, military organization, and military doctrine among advanced powers. This \\"System of Systems\\" perspective on RMA has been ardently supported by Admiral William Owens, former Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, who identified three overlapping areas for force assets. These are intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance, command, control, communications and intelligence processing, which allows for the use of precision force. Advanced versions of RMA incorporate other sophisticated technologies, including unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), nanotechnology, robotics, and biotechnology. Recently, the RMA debate focussed on \\"network-centric warfare\\" which is a doctrine that aims to connect all troops on the battlefield. Finally, the third concept is that a \\"true\\" revolution in military affairs has not yet occurred or is unlikely to. Authors such as Michael E. O'Hanlon and Frederick Kagan, point to the fact much of the technology and weapons systems ascribed to the contemporary RMA were in development long before 1991 and the Internet and information technology boom. Several critics point out that a \\"revolution\\" within the military ranks might carry detrimental consequences, produce severe economic strain, and ultimately prove counterproductive. Such authors tend to profess a much more gradual \\"evolution\\" in military affairs, as opposed to a rapid revolution. = Precision attack = In considering the implications of precision attack, it is clear that precision weapons, when coupled to recent developments in aerospace, have transformed warfare, and as a result, the question is not that \\"Does an RMA exist?\\" rather, \\"When did it begin, and what are its implications?\\" Tied to this are surprisingly persistent questions about the use and value of air power, now more accurately seen as aerospace power. If nothing else, given the record of precision air power application, aerospace power advocates should not still have to spend as much time as they do arguing the merits of three-dimensional war and precision attack's value to it. Modern joint service aerospace forces offer the most responsive, flexible, lethal, and devastating form of power projection across the spectrum of conflict, employing a range of aerospace weaponry such as maritime patrol aircraft, attack and troop-lift helicopters, land-based long-range aircraft, and battlefield rocket artillery systems. Service-specific aerospace power can often be formidable and, as such, has transformed conflict from two- dimensional to three-dimensional, and has changed the critical focus of conflict from that of seizing and holding to one of halting and controlling. In reviewing a few points from the military history of the 20th century, within roughly a decade of the first flight of an airplane, aircraft were having an occasionally decisive effect on the battlefield. Within four decades, a nation‚ÄîGreat Britain‚Äîsecured its national survival through air warfare. By the midst of the Second World War, three-dimensional attack (from above and below the surface) had become the primary means of sinking both vessels at sea and destroying the combat capability of armies on land. In fact, for the United States, this trend of inflicting losses and material destruction primarily through air attack continued after the second world war for Korea, Vietnam, the Gulf, Bosnia, and other, lesser, conflicts. In particular, air attack directed against land forces has been especially powerful in blunting and destroying opponents on the offensive, whether in older experience‚Äîsuch as confronting Rommel in the Western Desert, or Nazi armored forces trying to split the Normandy invasion at Mortain, or at the Bulge (where German commanders credited Allied fighter attacks on fuel trucks and supplies as being the decisive factor in halting their drive), in the opening and closing stages of the Korean War, and confronting the 1972 North Vietnamese Spring Invasion‚Äîor, more recently, in destroying the Khafji offensive of Saddam Hussein in 1991. NATO's reliance upon air power in the Yugoslav Wars was not surprising because from the very earliest days, the NATO alliance saw air power as the linchpin of Western military strength and the necessary offset to the Warsaw Pact's huge military forces. Given its historical underpinnings, we should not be surprised that the revolution in warfare that has been brought about both by the confluence of the aerospace and the electronic revolutions, and by the offshoot of both‚Äîthe precision guided munition‚Äîis one that has been a long time coming, back to the Second World War, back, even, to the experimenters of the First World War who attempted, however crudely, to develop \\"smart\\" weapons to launch from airships and other craft. Used almost experimentally until the latter stages of the Vietnam War, the precision weapon since that time has increasingly come to first influence, then dominate, and now perhaps to render superfluous, the traditional notion of a linear battlefield. Criticism The revolution of military affairs is the inclusion and expansion of new technology‚Äîe.g., drones, satellite imaging, and remotely operated vehicles‚Äîwithin current military tactics. RMA has generally been praised for its ability to reduce casualty rates and facilitate intelligence gathering. On the other hand, some critics argue that RMA serves to further dissociate soldiers from the horrific realities of warfare, while others maintain that RMA restricts the overall understanding of warfare and its dynamics. Scholars recommend gaining a critical understanding of RMA before implementing it. Operation Desert Storm is considered the first major global conflict successfully implementing RMA and is considered a paragon of future military operations due to the low casualty rate and the U.S. military's speed and precision. On the other hand, others claim that RMA technology severely inhibited the U.S. military's ability to respond to guerrilla tactics and that efforts to incorporate advanced weapons like Patriot missiles were unsuccessful. Indeed, a number of epistemological issues have cropped up. In the wake of RMA technologies such as drones, unmanned ground vehicles, and clean bombs there are several concerns about the distancing and disassociation that eclipse the realities of war. An analysis of tactical strikes reveals that while the number of ones own soldiers may be preserved as the number of long-range attacks increases, so does collateral damage. Furthermore, by removing the soldier-on-soldier element of warfare, the natural reactions and consequences of wartime actions are impacted, which has been frequently referred to as the removal of humanity from war. RMA technological advances have resulted in a dehumanizing of warfare, which negatively effects the decisions made by officers, as well as individuals in the field. Another critique argues that RMA's good intentions notwithstanding, the resulting collateral damage is unacceptable and thus urges more careful consideration in incorporating RMA technology. Stephen Biddle's 2004 book, Military Power: Explaining Victory and Defeat in Modern War, discounts the idea of RMA. He argues that military doctrine and tactics are far more important to battle outcomes in modern warfare than is technological progress, and that basic doctrine has changed little since the second half of World War I.

Because greater EDVs cause greater distention of the ventricle, EDV is often used synonymously with preload, which refers to the length of the sarcomeres in cardiac muscle prior to contraction (systole). An increase in EDV increases the preload on the heart and, through the Frank-Starling mechanism of the heart, increases the amount of blood ejected from the ventricle during systole (stroke volume). Sample values The right ventricular end-diastolic volume (RVEDV) ranges between 100 and 160 mL. The right ventricular end-diastolic volume index (RVEDVI) is calculated by RVEDV/BSA and ranges between 60 and 100 mL/m2.

It is one of the few newspapers authorized by the Hong Kong SAR government to publicize legal announcements, and also the only Hong Kong newspaper allowed to be circulated freely in mainland China. It is controlled by the Hong Kong Liaison Office and has a branch office in Shenzhen.  History  The HKCD was founded on 11 October 1952, at a price of 10 HK cents. Its stated aim was to serve as the voice of the local Hong Kong commerce, with a focus on worldwide economies, especially in Hong Kong and China. It also covered sport and, on weekends, offering columns and serialized short stories with pictures. Early coverage of horse and dog racing was curtailed by the government the early 70s, so as not to promote gambling, leading to a severe decline in circulation. In December 1989, a majority shareholding was acquired by the Joint Publishing (HK) Company Limited (the joint company of The Commercial Press (H.K.) Ltd, Chung Hwa Book Co. and Joint Publishing) for HK$160 million. In 1995, HKCD launched a mainland edition, in cooperation with mainland publishing companies. Since 1996, an online version has been available. In May 2005, the paper was upgraded, priced at HK$3 in Hong Kong and overseas, while in Mainland China, it sold for 3 yuan within Guangdong Province and 5 yuan in other provinces. The new version of the paper emphasizes business news from Hong Kong and the Pearl River Delta, along with some sports coverage. In 2015, assistant editor-in-chief Long Zhenyang was placed under ‚Äúpolitical measures‚Äù for comments he made during the 2014 Hong Kong protests and regarding the demolition of churches in Zhejiang. For the following year, he did not work as an editor but was allowed to continue writing, and in February 2016 resigned and sought political asylum in the United States, comparing the sociopolitical climate in Chinese politics to the Cultural Revolution, and saying that \\"All hope for social reform, and reforms to China‚Äôs political system, have now been extinguished.\\"Long Zhenyang: The resignation that shook Hong Kong media, BBC News, Juliana Liu, 18 Feb 2017 Contents A typical edition contains about 30 pages.

ESV is the lowest volume of blood in the ventricle at any point in the cardiac cycle. The main factors that affect the end-systolic volume are afterload and the contractility of the heart. Uses End systolic volume can be used clinically as a measurement of the adequacy of cardiac emptying, related to systolic function. On an electrocardiogram, or ECG, the end-systolic volume will be seen at the end of the T wave. Clinically, ESV can be measured using two-dimensional echocardiography, MRI (magnetic resonance tomography) or cardiac CT (computed tomography) or SPECT (single photon emission computed tomography). Sample values Along with end-diastolic volume, ESV determines the stroke volume, or output of blood by the heart during a single phase of the cardiac cycle. The stroke volume is the difference between the end- diastolic volume and the end-systolic volume. The end-systolic values in the table below are for the left ventricle: The right ventricular end-systolic volume (RVESV) normally ranges between 50 and 100 mL.

Members of this genus are very common perennial herbs with a native almost worldwide distribution, and introduced species growing in the few places where the genus is not native. Some are nuisance weeds (and are sometimes called dockweed or dock weed), but some are grown for their edible leaves. Rumex species are used as food plants by the larvae of a number of Lepidoptera species, and are the only host plants of Lycaena rubidus. Description They are erect plants, usually with long taproots. The fleshy to leathery leaves form a basal rosette at the root. The basal leaves may be different from those near the inflorescence. They may or may not have stipules. Minor leaf veins occur. The leaf blade margins are entire or crenate. The usually inconspicuous flowers are carried above the leaves in clusters. The fertile flowers are mostly hermaphrodites, or they may be functionally male or female. The flowers and seeds grow on long clusters at the top of a stalk emerging from the basal rosette; in many species, the flowers are green, but in some (such as sheep's sorrel, Rumex acetosella) the flowers and their stems may be brick-red. Each seed is a three-sided achene, often with a round tubercle on one or all three sides. Taxonomy The genus was first described by Carl Linnaeus in 1753. Within the family Polygonaceae, it is placed in the subfamily Polygonoideae. The genus Emex was separated from Rumex by Francisco Campder√° in 1819 on the basis that it was polygamous (i.e. had both bisexual and unisexual flowers on the same plant). However, some species of Rumex subg. Acetosa also have this characteristic, and most other features that are supposed to distinguish Emex are found in species of Rumex. Accordingly, in 2015, Schuster et al. demoted Emex to a subgenus of Rumex. Within the subfamily Polygonoideae, Rumex is placed in the tribe Rumiceae, along with the two genera Oxyria and Rheum. It is most closely related to Rheum, which includes Rhubarb. =Species= Rumex nervosus in Ethiopia , Plants of the World Online accepted the following species.

Uses These plants have many uses. Broad-leaved dock (Rumex obtusifolius) used to be called butter dock because its large leaves were used to wrap and conserve butter. Rumex hymenosepalus has been cultivated in the Southwestern US as a source of tannin (roots contain up to 25%), for use in leather tanning, while leaves and stems are used for a mordant-free mustard-colored dye. These plants are edible. The leaves of most species contain oxalic acid and tannin, and many have astringent and slightly purgative qualities. Some species with particularly high levels of oxalic acid are called sorrels (including sheep's sorrel Rumex acetosella, common sorrel Rumex acetosa, and French sorrel Rumex scutatus), and some of these are grown as leaf vegetables or garden herbs for their acidic taste. In the United Kingdom, Rumex obtusifolius is often found growing near stinging nettles and there is a widely held belief that the underside of the dock leaf, squeezed to extract a little juice, can be rubbed on the skin to counteract the itching caused by brushing against a nettle plant. This home remedy is not supported by any science, although it is possible that the act of rubbing may act as a distracting counterstimulation, or that belief in the dock's effect may provide a placebo effect. In traditional Austrian medicine, R. alpinus leaves and roots have been used internally for treatment of viral infections. Rumex nepalensis is also has a variety of medicinal uses in the Greater Himalayas, including Sikkim in Northeastern India. Fossil record Several fossil fruits of Rumex sp. have been described from middle Miocene strata of the Fasterholt area near Silkeborg in Central Jutland, Denmark. One fossil fruit of a Rumex species has been extracted from a borehole sample of the Middle Miocene fresh water deposits in Nowy Sacz Basin, West Carpathians, Poland. This fossil fruit is similar to the fruits of the extant species Rumex maritimus and Rumex ucranicus which both have fossil records from the Pliocene and Pleistocene of Europe.Macroscopic plant remains from the freshwater Miocene of the Nowy SƒÖcz Basin (West Carpathians, Poland) by Maria ≈Åa≈Ñcucka- ≈örodoniowa, Acta Palaeobotanica 1979 20 (1): 3-117.

He served as the head coach at Mississippi State University (1954‚Äì1955), the University of Washington (1956), and the University of Texas (1957‚Äì1976), compiling a career college football record of 184‚Äì60‚Äì5. In his 20 seasons at Texas, Royal's teams won three national championships (1963, 1969, and 1970), 11 Southwest Conference titles, and amassed a record of 167‚Äì47‚Äì5. He won more games than any other coach in Texas Longhorns football history. Royal also coached the Edmonton Eskimos of the Canadian Football League (CFL) for one season in 1953. He never had a losing season as a head coach for his entire career. Royal played football at the University of Oklahoma from 1946 to 1949. He was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame as a coach in 1983. Darrell K Royal‚ÄìTexas Memorial Stadium in Austin, Texas, where the Longhorns play their home games, was renamed in his honor in 1996. Early life \\"K\\" is Royal's given middle name, not an abbreviation. He received it in honor of his mother, Katy, who died when he was an infant. She died of cancer, but because of the stigma surrounding the disease at that time, Royal was led to believe until he was an adult that she had died giving birth to him. Playing career In 1942, during World War II, Royal finished Hollis High School, where he had played football. He joined the United States Army Air Corps, where he played football for the 3rd Air Force team during 1945 and was spotted and recruited by scouts for the University of Oklahoma Sooners football program. He played quarterback and defensive back at the University of Oklahoma under his mentor, coach Bud Wilkinson, from 1946 to 1949. While attending Oklahoma, he joined the Delta Upsilon fraternity. Royal was most noted for his prowess as a defensive back, where his 18 career interceptions and his three interceptions in the 1947 game against Oklahoma A&M; (now Oklahoma State) are still Sooner records. Royal's part-time contributions as quarterback had a similar impact, despite the fact that he shared time with Jack Mitchell and Claude Arnold at the position. He threw a 43-yard pass against North Carolina in the 1949 Sugar Bowl. Royal holds the fourth-best winning percentage in school history (minimum 15 starts) with a 16‚Äì1 mark as a part-time quarterback starter. His 11‚Äì0 mark as a starter in 1949 ranks as one of the best seasons in school history. In 1992, Royal was inducted into the Oklahoma Sports Hall of Fame. Coaching career =Early positions= Royal served as an assistant coach at North Carolina State, Tulsa and Mississippi State. He coached the Edmonton Eskimos of the Canadian Football League, and in 1954, he returned to Mississippi State for his first collegiate head coaching job. After two seasons, he left for Washington in the Pacific Coast Conference, but stayed in Seattle for less than ten months. =University of Texas= Royal took over as head coach at the University of Texas (UT) on December 18, 1956.United Press, ‚ÄúRoyal Named New Texas Coach,‚Äù The San Bernardino Daily Sun, San Bernardino, California, Wednesday 19 December 1956, Volume LXII, Number 94, page 24. The team went from a 1‚Äì9 record in 1956, their worst record ever, to a 6‚Äì4‚Äì1 mark in 1957 and a berth in the Sugar Bowl. Within two years, Royal had the Longhorns in the Cotton Bowl as the number-four team in the country. In Royal's 20 years as head coach, Texas never had a losing season. Royal posted a record at Texas, and his overall record was . Some of his most memorable games were against the Arkansas Razorbacks, and fellow College Football Hall of Fame head coach Frank Broyles. With Royal at the helm, Texas won the school's first three undisputed national championships (1963, 1969 and 1970), won or shared 11 Southwest Conference championships, and made 16 bowl appearances. His 1963 and 1969 teams finished the season undefeated and untied‚Äîsomething no Longhorn team would do again until 2005. Royal's teams were known for being very run-oriented. The quote, \\"Three things can happen when you pass, and two of them are bad,\\" is often attributed to Royal, but Royal himself attributed it to another run-first coach, Woody Hayes. Royal's coaching tactics were the subject of criticism in Gary Shaw's expos√© of college football recruiting and coaching practices, Meat on the Hoof, which was published in 1972, six years after Shaw left the Texas football program. Beginning in 1962, Royal also served as Texas's athletic director. He retired from coaching in 1976 and remained director of athletics until 1980. He then served as special assistant to the university president on athletic programs. During his tenure, Royal oversaw the integration of African-Americans into the UT athletics program. At that time, while UT began admitting black students in 1956 and opening the athletics program to them in 1963, there were no black student-athletes well into the late 1960s. In 2005, Royal retrospectively noted that \\"things they are a-changing. But they weren't changing that quickly around here at the time.\\". He offered a scholarship to Julius Whittier (1950-2018) of San Antonio after the last recipient dropped out due to poor academic performance, and Whittier became the first black student-athlete to play for the Texas Longhorns football team. Whittier went on to graduate from the Lyndon B. Johnson School of Public Affairs in 1976 with a master's degree and worked as a chief prosecutor with the Dallas District Attorney's Office. Royal also coached Freddie Steinmark, who was a member of the 1969 Longhorns National Championship team and subsequently died from bone cancer. Steinmark has been the topic of several books and a 2015 movie, My All American where Royal was portrayed by Aaron Eckhart. In 1996, the University honored Royal by renaming Texas Memorial Stadium as Darrell K Royal‚ÄìTexas Memorial Stadium. Royal was elected to the College Football Hall of Fame in 1983. Coach Royal was famous for the inspirational Royalisms he deployed as motivational tools. These sayings include: * \\"God gives talent, size, speed. But a guy can control how hard he tries.\\" * \\"I want to be remembered as a winning coach, but I also want to be remembered as an honest and ethical coach.\\" * \\"You've got to think lucky. If you fall into a mud hole, check your back pocket‚Äîyou might have caught a fish.\\" * \\"Punt returns will kill you quicker than a minnow can swim a dipper.\\" * \\"Don't matter what they throw at us. Only angry people win football games.\\" Death Royal died on November 7, 2012, due to complications of Alzheimer's disease. He is interred at the Texas State Cemetery in Austin, Texas. Royal was survived by his wife Edith (b. 1925), whom he married on July 26, 1944. They have a son, Sammy Mack, and two predeceased children, Marian Royal Kazen (1945‚Äì73) and David Wade Royal (1952‚Äì82), both of whom died in automobile-related accidents.

They often drew inspiration from surrealism and the contemporary avant-garde art movements, in particular action painting, abstract expressionism, jazz, improvisational theater, experimental music, and the interaction of friends in the New York City art world's vanguard circle. People Frank O'Hara was at the center of the group before his death in 1966. Because of his numerous friendships and his post as a curator at the Museum of Modern Art, he provided connections between the poets and painters such as Jane Freilicher, Fairfield Porter, and Larry Rivers (who was O'Hara's lover). There were many joint works and collaborations, particularly between poets such as O'Hara, Kenneth Koch, John Ashberry, and James Schuyler: Rivers inspired a play by Koch, Koch and Ashbery together wrote the poem \\"A Postcard to Popeye\\", Ashbery and Schuyler wrote the novel A Nest of Ninnies, and Schuyler collaborated on an ode with O'Hara, whose portrait was painted by Rivers. Yezzi, David, \\"Last One Off the Barricade Turn Out the Lights\\", a review in The New York Times of The Last Avant-Garde: The Making of the New York School of Poets, by David Lehman, Thursday, January 3, 1999 Ron Padgett and Ted Berrigan both came to the group from Tulsa, Oklahoma. Koch, O'Hara, Schuyler, and Ashbery were quite different as poets, but they admired each other and had much in common personally: * Except for Schuyler, all overlapped at Harvard University, * Except for Koch, all were homosexual, * Except for Ashbery, all did military service, * Except for Koch, all reviewed art, * Except for Ashbery, all lived in New York during their formative years as poets. All four were inspired by French Surrealists such as Raymond Roussel, Pierre Reverdy, and Guillaume Apollinaire. David Lehman, in his book on the New York poets, wrote: \\"They favored wit, humor and the advanced irony of the blague (that is, the insolent prank or jest) in ways more suggestive of Jasper Johns and Robert Rauschenberg than of the New York School abstract expressionist painters after whom they were named.\\" Poetry Concerning the New York School poets, critics argued that their work was a reaction to the Confessionalist movement in Contemporary Poetry. Their poetic subject matter was often light, violent, or observational, while their writing style was often described as cosmopolitan and world-traveled. The poets often wrote in an immediate and spontaneous manner reminiscent of stream of consciousness writing, often using vivid imagery. They drew on inspiration from Surrealism and the contemporary avant-garde art movements, in particular the action painting of their friends in the New York City art world circle such as Jackson Pollock and Willem de Kooning. Poets often associated with the New York School include John Ashbery, Frank O'Hara, Joe Brainard, Kenneth Koch, James Schuyler, Barbara Guest, Ted Berrigan, Bernadette Mayer, Alice Notley, Kenward Elmslie, Frank Lima, Ron Padgett, Lewis Warsh, Tom Savage and Joseph Ceravolo. Visual art The New York School which represented the New York abstract expressionists of the 1950s was documented through a series of artists' committee invitational exhibitions commencing with the 9th Street Art Exhibition in 1951 and followed by consecutive exhibitions at the Stable Gallery, NYC: Second Annual Exhibition of Painting and Sculpture, 1953;Second Annual Exhibition of Painting and Sculpture, (poster) , Albertkotin.com Third Annual Exhibition of Painting and Sculpture, 1954;Third Annual Exhibition of Painting and Sculpture, (poster) , Albertkotin.com Fourth Annual Exhibition of Painting and Sculpture, 1955;Fourth Annual Exhibition of Painting and Sculpture, (poster) , Albertkotin.com Fifth Annual Exhibitions of Painting and Sculpture, 1956Fifth Annual Exhibition of Painting and Sculpture, (poster) , Albertkotin.com and Sixth New York Artists‚Äô Annual Exhibition, 1957.New York Artists' 6th Annual Exhibition.

Their music influenced the music and events of the Fluxus group, and drew its name from the Abstract Expressionist painters above. Dance During the 1960s the Judson Dance Theater located at the Judson Memorial Church, New York City, revolutionized Modern dance. Combining in new ways the idea of Performance art, radical and new Choreography, sound from avant-garde composers, and dancers in collaboration with several New York School Visual artists. The group of artists that formed Judson Dance Theater are considered the founders of Postmodern dance. The theater grew out of a dance composition class taught by Robert Dunn, a musician who had studied with John Cage. The artists involved with Judson Dance Theater were avant-garde experimenatalists who rejected the confines of ballet technique, vocabulary and theory. The first Judson concert took place on July 6, 1962, with dance works presented by Steve Paxton, Freddie Herko, David Gordon, Alex and Deborah Hay, Yvonne Rainer, Elaine Summers, William Davis, and Ruth Emerson. Seminal dance artists that were a part of the Judson Dance Theater include: David Gordon, Steve Paxton, Yvonne Rainer, Trisha Brown, Lucinda Childs, Deborah Hay, Elaine Summers, Sally Gross, Aileen Passloff, and Meredith Monk. The years 1962 to 1964 are considered the golden age of the Judson Dance Theater. During the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s New York School artists collaborated with several other choreographer / dancers including: Simone Forti, Anna Halprin, Merce Cunningham, Martha Graham, and Paul Taylor.

Orkney Brewery was founded in March 1988 by Roger White at the old schoolhouse in Sandwick, Orkney, Scotland. Atlas was formed in 2002 by Neill Cotton and merged with Orkney in 2004 under the name Highland & Islands Breweries. Highland & Islands was taken over by Sinclair Breweries in 2006. History and development In June 2004, the Orkney Brewery was acquired from its retiring founder by the shareholders of Atlas Brewery to form Highlands and Islands Breweries. Neill Cotton, founder of Atlas Brewery, was Managing Director of Highlands and Islands and drove a series of changes at The Orkney Brewery, including a rebranding and the launch of a very interesting lager. In summer 2006, the company was bought by Sinclair Breweries Ltd. Availability The cask ales are available in various pubs around Britain and at British beer festivals. The filtered bottled ales are sold throughout Europe and in North America. Beers Skull Splitter The Orkney brewery produces cask ale and filtered beer in bottles, and since October 2005, a lager. Dark Island a rich, fruity, vinous dark ale, is the biggest seller. Dark Island has won Champion Beer of Scotland on several occasions. Red MacGregor, a 4% bitter has won the World Cask Beer Gold Medal (BIIA 2001). The same name is used for a 5% premium bitter available filtered in the bottle.

Skull Splitter takes its name after Torfinn Hausakljuv who was nicknamed \\"Skullsplitter\\". Hausakluif was the 7th Viking Earl of Orkney sometime around 950 AD.SkullSplitter at Legends Ltd. Skull Splitter was in the centre of some controversy over its name. The Portman Group, which is the alcohol watchdog group, carried out an investigation based on complaints that the ale had an \\"aggressive theme\\". The Portman Group decided on 23 December 2008 not to uphold the complaint after the brewery launched a strong campaign to save this 20-year-old beer, informing the Group of the beer's namesake.Skull Splitter on the BBCNews of the decision on SkullSplitter The model for the Skull Splitter label was photographer Michael Hockney, who lived in Quoyloo. Hockney was asked by Roger White if he could take a shot for a small promotional poster. A member of Orkney Islands Council, who was a Shetlander, offered his full Viking regalia and himself to provide a suitable Skullsplitter image. At the last minute, the council member decided it was something that an elected official should maybe not do, but insisted White borrow the costume. Hockney arrived at Broch of Gurness to meet White and the model, and was told of the last minute change. White suggested Hockney looked suitably Viking-like and that perhaps he should wear the costume. The Fuji 6x9 camera was set up and Hockney struggled to get his size 10 feet into size 7 deerskins. Roger White also brought his 35mm camera and it was, in fact, White's camera that took the shot.

He was one of the founders of the Amateur Athletic Union (AAU) on Jan 21, 1888 , serving as its secretary from 1889 until 1906 when he was elected as President of the Amateur Athletic Union from 1906 to 1909. He declined a fourth term and was re-elected to his former position as secretary- treasurer until his sudden death which followed an emergency operation. Sullivan also served as the chairman of the Greater New York Irish Athletic Association in 1903 and on the New York City Board of Education from 1908 to 1912. Biography He was born on 18 November 1862 in New York City. His business career began in 1878 at Frank Leslie's publications. In 1880, he started a paper The Athletics News. His career continued in sports publishing, and sporting goods businesses. His athletics on the track had started in 1877 as a member of the Pastime Athletic Club. In 1888 and 1889 he won the all round championship of the club. He also was one of the most influential people in the early Olympic movement, although his relationship with IOC president Pierre de Coubertin was tense. Sullivan was also an organizer of the Outdoor Recreation League and served as its second president. Sullivan \\"was the advertising representative of A. G. Spalding & Brothers\\", Spalding (company), which provided running shoes, implements, balls and gloves for many sports. 1904 St. Louis Olympic Games Sullivan was a chief organizer of the 1904 Summer Olympics. He decided to allow only one water station on the 24.85 mile course of the marathon even though it was conducted in heat over unpaved roads choked with dust. His ostensible reason was to conduct research on \\"purposeful dehydration,\\" even though dehydration is potentially fatal. The marathon ended with the worst ratio of entrants to finishers (14 of 32) and by far the slowest winning time, 3:28:45, almost 30 minutes slower than the second fastest winning time.http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/the-1904-olympic- marathon-may-have-been-the-strangest-ever-14910747/?no-ist He also organized the Anthropology Days. 1912 Olympic Games The 1912 Summer Olympics allowed female divers and swimmers, but Sullivan, on behalf of the United States Olympic Committee, barred American women from participating even though there were capable women willing to participate. Death and funeral In 1911 he was injured in a train wreck in Fort Wayne, Indiana. He died on 16 September 1914 at Mount Sinai Hospital, New York after an operation on his intestines. For the funeral on 19 September 1914, his body was conveyed from his home, 540 West 114th Street, to St. Aloysius Gonzaga's Church, at 132d Street and Seventh Avenue, where a requiem Mass was held. Legacy James E. Sullivan created The Athletic News in 1880 . The 1914 National Outdoor Track and Field Championships were postponed (Sept 19 to Oct 3) in his honor (after his death). In 1930, the AAU established the James E. Sullivan Award in his honour. It is awarded annually to the best amateur athlete in the US. In 1977, he was inducted into the National Track & Field Hall of Fame.

It is 4.1 miles (6.6 km) west of Haslemere, bypassed by the A3 road, and lies on the Hampshire/Sussex border. It is in the civil parish of Bramshott and Liphook, which also includes Bramshott and Hammer Bottom. Liphook has a railway station, on the Portsmouth Direct Line. The village grew as a coaching stop between London and Portsmouth during the 17th and 18th centuries. It served as a base during the First World War and the Second World War for Canadian troops stationed in Southern England. History =Pre- coaching times= The first record of Liphook is in the Bramshott Manor Court Rolls to one 'Robert of Lupe' in 1281. Then follows Matilda of 'Lhupe' in 1337, William at 'Lupe' in 1365, John at 'Lepe' in 1386, and John Maunser at 'Leope' in 1423. On his death in 1428, John Maunser's tenancy at 'Lepe' between modern London Road and Headley Road is the first identifiable landmark in Liphook. Sir Edmund Pakynham inherited a tenement and land in 'Lepoke' in 1527, and John Hooke bought the manor of 'Chiltle' in 'Lippuck' in 1591. John Speed's map of 1610 shows it as Lippocke. It was also a tuppe. It seems some people escaped from the manors of Bramshott, Chiltlee and Ludshott to Liphook, an area above the marshes around the River Wey, to evade taxes of their local Lords. =The coaching age= Liphook grew further as a coach stop on the London - Portsmouth route. In Tudor times mail was sent from London to Portsmouth via Southampton and the route through Liphook was only used in emergencies, such as the Armada of 1588. The map of 1675 by John Ogilby shows this road bypassing Bramshott and going through Lippock, however the quality of this road was very poor. Originally travellers' needs were catered for by stalls, eventually replaced by the half-timbered houses that exist around The Square. Growth accelerated with wagons being replaced by coaches, and coaching in Liphook was firmly established by 1660. The roads were often unmaintained and unsigned - Samuel Pepys records three journeys by this road in May 1661, April 1662 and August 1668, on the last occasion staying in Lippock: The Royal Anchor coaching inn, The Square, Liphook A coach service from London to Portsmouth started in 1688, which coincided with growth of The Royal Anchor coaching inn, and other 17th century buildings in The Square. The Royal Anchor has a fireback dated 1588 which supports the supposition that there was an earlier building on the site. In the 17th century the Royal Navy considered the road from Petersfield to Portsmouth impassable for heavy goods in winter. Improvements were made in the 18th century to roads and coaches along with the coming of the turnpike. Turnpiking between Petersfield and Portsmouth began in 1710 and between Kingston and Petersfield via Liphook in 1749. The Old Toll House by Radford Bridge in Liphook dates from the 18th century. Highwaymen were a problem in the 18th century as notices in the Royal Anchor show. By 1784 London-Portsmouth coaches carried mail through Liphook. Turnpiking reduced the journey from London-Portsmouth from two days in the 1660s to 10 hours in 1819. Cary's New Itinerary of 1819 records seven coaches on weekdays left London for Portsmouth via Liphook and three during the night. Local tradition has it that Nelson spent his last night in England in Liphook before sailing for the Battle of Trafalgar. George III and Queen Charlotte on their stay gave permission for The Blue Anchor to be renamed The Royal Anchor. =The railway era= Liphook railway station The London and South Western Railway came to Liphook in 1859. The Portsmouth Direct Line was built after the 1840s 'railway mania'. Originally the LSWR route from London to Portsmouth was via a branch from Southampton to Gosport, where passengers then went on the chain ferry across Portsmouth harbour. This lasted until the London, Brighton and South Coast Railway extended their London-Brighton line to Portchester. Initially the LSWR constructed a branch from Woking to Guildford in 1845 then Godalming in 1849, but were reluctant to extend it to Havant. Thomas Brassey, a railway contractor, was granted Act of Parliament to construct a single track in 1853 (doubling was completed on 1 March 1878 ). The first train arrived in Liphook on 24 January 1859, but a dispute between the LSWR and the LBSCR meant full service was not initiated until 7 May. Railways caused the long-distance coaching trade to reduce in the village. The railway station became the hub of short-distance horse-drawn transport, with the blacksmiths shop in The Square flourishing until at least 1918. Chiltlee Manor House, Liphook The railway was originally planned to bypass Liphook, but the Liphook Deviation amendment of the Act of Parliament altered it to its present course. In doing so it bisected the estate of Chiltlee Manor, a split that exists to this day. The northern part remained as fields and the village cricket pitch, until its requisition to become the British Army's Ordnance Supply Unit in 1939. After decommissioning it was sold to Sainsbury's to form the site of their shop, the Millennium Centre and several other housing developments. The southern part was sold to Mary Ann Robb in 1869, who built the house of Chiltlee Place and the surrounding arboretum in 1880. In the 1960s the site was sold to the Berg firm of builders for construction of their housing estate. Liphook's population grew modestly, from 1,367 in 1861 to 1,614 in 1891. The railway did not cause a more substantial increase, since many could not afford to pay the fare for more than an occasional excursion. The Kelly's Directory of 1895 shows far more shopkeepers in Liphook than Bramshott: Liphook had become the predominant centre of the Parish of Bramshott. A few wealthy people however saw the potential of commuter travel, notably Mary Ann Robb and London solicitor William Thomas Longbourn, who bought Foley Manor in 1859. He later sold it to William Barrington Tristram, a former member of the Bombay Council who built the house's Victorian extension. =20th century= From 1916-1928 author and poet Flora Thompson lived in Liphook where her husband was postmaster. Her first work, Bog-Myrtle and Peat, was published in 1921 when she lived in Liphook. The roads 'Lark Rise' and 'Candleford Gate' are named after two of the works. During both World War I and II Liphook was the base for Canadian troops. Recent roads in Liphook have been given Canadian place names to commemorate the armed forces of that country which trained in this area during the World Wars. The cemetery of St Mary's church in Bramshott has a section of Canadian graves, including those of both war dead and victims of the influenza outbreak of 1918. Liphook was one of three sites (with Longmoor and Bordon) occupied by the Royal Engineers' Engineer Stores Depot which, in 1948, employed 700 men. It was established in 1943, originally called Chiltlee Manor Engineer Stores Depot and in 1945 was designated 2 Engineer Stores Depot under the War Office. In 1948 the local MP (for Petersfield), General Sir George Jeffreys, asked the Secretary of State for War, Emanuel Shinwell, whether the men at Liphook were fully occupied as the men themselves stated that they were not. Mr Shinwell promised an investigation. The depot continued its military function until it was closed in 1968. During the hot summer of 1983, Liphook made the news as the hottest spot (33.7C) in the United Kingdom on three days in July. Governance Liphook is in the parliamentary constituency of East Hampshire, and included in the parish of Liphook & Bramshott together with several other settlements nearby. Amenities Liphook village centre =Transport= Liphook was located on both the main road (A3) and rail (Portsmouth Direct Line) links between London and Portsmouth, but is now bypassed by the A3. It is served by Liphook railway station. =Education= Liphook is the location of the public school Churcher's College Junior school, (the Senior school being located in nearby Petersfield) and Highfield Brookham preparatory school. The site previously housed Littlefield school, which was bought by Churcher's and converted. Liphook is also the home of Bohunt School, a top fifty secondary state school. =Sport= Liphook and Ripsley CC. Ripsley House beyond. Liphook and Ripsley Cricket Club play on a ground to the southwest of the village just over the border in West Sussex.

Diagrams have been used since ancient times on walls of caves , but became more prevalent during the Enlightenment. Sometimes, the technique uses a three-dimensional visualization which is then projected onto a two- dimensional surface. The word graph is sometimes used as a synonym for diagram.  Overview  The term \\"diagram\\" in its commonly used sense can have a general or specific meaning: * visual information device : Like the term \\"illustration\\", \\"diagram\\" is used as a collective term standing for the whole class of technical genres, including graphs, technical drawings and tables. * specific kind of visual display : This is the genre that shows qualitative data with shapes that are connected by lines, arrows, or other visual links. In science the term is used in both ways. For example, Anderson (1997) stated more generally: \\"diagrams are pictorial, yet abstract, representations of information, and maps, line graphs, bar charts, engineering blueprints, and architects' sketches are all examples of diagrams, whereas photographs and video are not\\".Michael Anderson (1997). \\"Introduction to Diagrammatic Reasoning,\\" at cs.hartford.edu. Retrieved 21 July 2008. On the other hand, Lowe (1993) defined diagrams as specifically \\"abstract graphic portrayals of the subject matter they represent\\". In the specific sense diagrams and charts contrast with computer graphics, technical illustrations, infographics, maps, and technical drawings, by showing \\"abstract rather than literal representations of information\\". The essence of a diagram can be seen as: * a form of visual formatting devices * a display that does not show quantitative data (numerical data), but rather relationships and abstract information * with building blocks such as geometrical shapes connected by lines, arrows, or other visual links. Or in Hall's (1996) words \\"diagrams are simplified figures, caricatures in a way, intended to convey essential meaning\\".Bert S.

The basic shape according to White (1984) can be characterized in terms of \\"elegance, clarity, ease, pattern, simplicity, and validity\\". Elegance is basically determined by whether or not the diagram is \\"the simplest and most fitting solution to a problem\\".

The x-axis often describes end-diastolic volume, right atrial pressure, or pulmonary capillary wedge pressure. The three curves illustrate that shifts along the same line indicate a change in preload, while shifts from one line to another indicate a change in afterload or contractility. A blood volume increase would cause a shift along the line to the right, which increases left ventricular end diastolic volume (x axis), and therefore also increases stroke volume (y axis). The Frank‚ÄìStarling law of the heart (also known as Starling's law and the Frank‚ÄìStarling mechanism) represents the relationship between stroke volume and end diastolic volume.Widmaier, E. P., Hershel, R., & Strang, K. T. (2016).Vander's Human Physiology: The Mechanisms of Body Function(14th ed.). New York, NY: McGraw-Hill Education. The law states that the stroke volume of the heart increases in response to an increase in the volume of blood in the ventricles, before contraction (the end diastolic volume), when all other factors remain constant. As a larger volume of blood flows into the ventricle, the blood stretches the cardiac muscle fibers, leading to an increase in the force of contraction. The Frank-Starling mechanism allows the cardiac output to be synchronized with the venous return, arterial blood supply and humoral length, without depending upon external regulation to make alterations. The physiological importance of the mechanism lies mainly in maintaining left and right ventricular output equality. Physiology The Frank-Starling mechanism occurs as the result of the length-tension relationship observed in striated muscle, including for example skeletal muscles, arthropod muscle and cardiac (heart) muscle. As a muscle fiber is stretched, active tension is created by altering the overlap of thick and thin filaments. The greatest isometric active tension is developed when a muscle is at its optimal length. In most relaxed skeletal muscle fibers, passive elastic properties maintain the muscle fibers length near optimal, as determined usually by the fixed distance between the attachment points of tendons to the bones (or the exoskeleton of arthropods) at either end of the muscle. In contrast, the relaxed sarcomere length of cardiac muscle cells, in a resting ventricle, is lower than the optimal length for contraction. There is no bone to fix sarcomere length in the heart (of any animal) so sarcomere length is very variable and depends directly upon blood filling and thereby expanding the heart chambers. In the human heart, maximal force is generated with an initial sarcomere length of 2.2 micrometers, a length which is rarely exceeded in a normal heart. Initial lengths larger or smaller than this optimal value will decrease the force the muscle can achieve. For longer sarcomere lengths, this is the result of there being less overlap of the thin and thick filaments; for shorter sarcomere lengths, the cause is the decreased sensitivity for calcium by the myofilaments. An increase in filling of the ventricle increases the load experienced by each cardiac muscle fiber, stretching the fibers toward their optimal length. The stretching of the muscle fibers augments cardiac muscle contraction by increasing the calcium sensitivity of the myofibrils,Klabunde, Richard E. \\"Cardiovascular Physiology Concepts\\". Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, 2011, p. 74. causing a greater number of actin-myosin cross-bridges to form within the muscle fibers. Specifically, the sensitivity of troponin for binding Ca2+ increases and there is an increased release of Ca2+ from the sarcoplasmic reticulum. In addition, there is a decrease in the spacing between thick and thin filaments, when a cardiac muscle fiber is stretched, allowing an increased number of cross- bridges to form. The force that any single cardiac muscle fiber generates is related to the sarcomere length at the time of muscle cell activation by calcium. The stretch on the individual fibers, caused by ventricular filling, determines the sarcomere length of the fibres. Therefore the force (pressure) generated by the cardiac muscle fibres is related to the end-diastolic volume of the left and right ventricles as determined by complexities of the force- sarcomere length relationship. Due to the intrinsic property of myocardium that is responsible for the Frank-Starling mechanism, the heart can automatically accommodate an increase in venous return, at any heart rate. The mechanism is of functional importance because it serves to adapt left ventricular output to right ventricular output. If this mechanism did not exist and the right and left cardiac outputs were not equivalent, blood would accumulate in the pulmonary circulation (were the right ventricle producing more output than the left) or the systemic circulation (were the left ventricle producing more output than the right). Clinical examples = Premature ventricular contraction = Premature ventricular contraction causes early emptying of the left ventricle (LV) into the aorta. Since the next ventricular contraction occurs at its regular time, the filling time for the LV increases, causing an increased LV end-diastolic volume. Due to the Frank‚ÄìStarling mechanism, the next ventricular contraction is more forceful, leading to the ejection of the larger than normal volume of blood, and bringing the LV end-systolic volume back to baseline. = Diastolic dysfunction ‚Äì heart failure = Diastolic dysfunction is associated with a reduced compliance, or increased stiffness, of the ventricle wall. This reduced compliance results in an inadequate filling of the ventricle and a decrease in the end-diastolic volume. The decreased end-diastolic volume then leads to a reduction in stroke volume because of the Frank-Starling mechanism. History The Frank‚ÄìStarling law is named after the two physiologists, Otto Frank and Ernest Henry Starling. However, neither Frank nor Starling was the first to describe the relationship between the end-diastolic volume and the regulation of cardiac output. The first formulation of the law was theorized by the Italian physiologist Dario Maestrini, who on December 13, 1914, started the first of 19 experiments that led him to formulate the \\"legge del cuore\\" . Otto Frank's contributions are derived from his 1895 experiments on frog hearts. In order to relate the work of the heart to skeletal muscle mechanics, Frank observed changes in diastolic pressure with varying volumes of the frog ventricle. His data was analyzed on a pressure-volume diagram, which resulted in his description of peak isovolumic pressure and its affects on ventricular volume. Starling experimented on intact mammalian hearts, such as from dogs, to understand why variations in arterial pressure, heart rate, and temperature do not affect the relatively constant cardiac output. More than 30 years before the development of the sliding filament model of muscle contraction and the understanding of the relationship between active tension and sarcomere length, Starling hypothesized in 1914, \\"the mechanical energy set free in the passage from the resting to the active state is a function of the length of the fiber.\\" Starling used a volume-pressure diagram to construct a length- tension diagram from his data. Starling's data and associated diagrams, provided evidence that the length of the muscle fibers, and resulting tension, altered the systolic pressure.

Rolling papers are packs of several cigarette-size sheets, often folded inside a cardboard wrapper. Filter cigarette: History 1898 French cigarette paper advertisement poster The first cigarette paper was produces in Alcoy,Spain 1764. Paper cigarettes became popular in the second half of the 19th century, displacing the more expensive cigars and cigarillos.  Composition  Several brands of rolling papers Cigarette paper is made from thin and lightweight \\"rag fibers\\" (nonwood plant fibers) such as flax, hemp, sisal, rice straw, and esparto. The paper is available in rolls and rectangular sheets of varying sizes, and has a narrow strip of glue along one long edge. It may be transparent, colored and flavored. It has a high filler content and a basis weight of 10-28 g/m¬≤. To control the smoking properties, this paper has a porosity that is suited to the type of tobacco and contains additives that regulate burning. One critical paper characteristic is permeability; its primary physical influence is smoke dilution. Among the fillers used are calcium carbonate to influence the permeability and color, magnesium carbonate to improve ash color, or titanium oxide if a particularly white ash is required. Sodium potassium tartrate (Seignette's salt), sodium and potassium citrate are used as a combustion regulator in cigarette paper, increased levels result in faster burning papers. Poly(vinyl alcohol) in aqueous solution is used for cigarette adhesives. Permeability is defined as the measure of the volume of air that flows through a specified area of cigarette paper in a given unit of time. It is measured in CORESTA units. US commercial filter cigarette brands have paper permeability between 14 and 51 CORESTA units. Increased cigarette paper permeability results in increased smoke dilution with air. Fire-resistant cigarettes, which reduce the risk of fire from unattended cigarettes, are made with special paper that includes a plastic compound, ethylene vinyl acetate. If a cigarette made with this type of paper is left unattended, the plastic in the paper will help the cigarette self-extinguish. Other specialty papers for tobacco products are: * Imitation cork paper is a brownish yellow colored paper used for the production of cigarette tips. It has an imitation cork imprint and joins the filter to the tobacco stick. * Filter encasing paper is used for the production of acetate or cellulose filters. The tip paper may be covered with polyvinyl alcohol. * Cigar or cigarillo casing paper holds the chopped tobacco together and serves as the inner casing.  Consumption  =United States= In 2008, Tobacconist Magazine called roll-your-own (RYO) the tobacco industry's fastest growing segment. It estimates that 2-4% of cigarette smokers in the United States, or approximately 2.6 million people, make their own cigarettes. Many of these smokers have switched in response to increasingly high taxes on manufactured cigarettes.Iver Peterson, \\"Roll-your-owns cuts taxes\\", New York Times, October 14, 2002.TTB stats. =Canada= In 2000, a Canadian government survey estimated that 9% of Canada's 6,000,000 cigarette smokers smoked hand- rolled cigarettes \\"sometimes or most of the time\\", 7% smoked roll-your-owns \\"exclusively\\", and over 90% of rolling papers sold in Canada were for tobacco consumption. A more recent 2009 study has shown that approximately 925,000 Canadians roll their own cigarettes. =United Kingdom= According to The Publican, \\"Low price RYO has seen an astonishing rise of 175% in [2007] as cigarette smokers look for cheaper alternatives and to control the size of their smoke\\".The Publican - Home - Tobacco sales drop in Scotland. The National Health Service has reported that roll-your-own use has more than doubled since 1990, from 11% to 24%. Many of these smokers apparently believe that hand-rolled cigarettes are less harmful than manufactured products,BBC, \\"Smoker poll reveals roll-ups myth\\", May 30, 2006 Online copy. although it is equally possible that the increase is due to the steep rise in prices since the early-1990s to the present day. =Thailand= In Thailand, roll-your-own smokers have long exceeded those for manufactured brands;\\"Cigarette Consumption\\", Thailand Health Promotion Institute PDF document. Often, cheaper papers without gum are kept constantly between the fingers while smoking =New Zealand= The New Zealand Ministry of Health reported in 2005 that: 'The ratio of roll-your-own to manufactured or tailor-made cigarettes consumed by New Zealanders has risen over (at least) the past decade, perhaps reflecting price differences between these products, and currently approaching 50 percent overall.'Ministry of Health, \\"Seeing through the Smoke: Tobacco Monitoring in New Zealand\\", Public Health Intelligence: Occasional Bulletin (26), 2005 PDF document.  Taxation  Consumers' switching to roll-your-own has led to a response among certain tax authorities. In the United States, Indiana and Kentucky tax rolling papers. Kentucky set its tax at $0.25 per pack (for up to 32 leaves, larger packs are taxed at $0.0078 per leaf) in 2006 despite complaints from manufacturers. Louisiana Revised Statute 47:338.261 allows up to $1.25 per pack at retail.

Red arrow is path from left ventricle to aorta. Afterload is largely dependent upon aortic pressure. Afterload is the pressure that the heart must work against to eject blood during systole (ventricular contraction). Afterload is proportional to the average arterial pressure. As aortic and pulmonary pressures increase, the afterload increases on the left and right ventricles respectively. Afterload changes to adapt to the continually changing demands on an animal's cardiovascular system. Afterload is proportional to mean systolic blood pressure and is measured in millimeters of mercury (mm Hg).  Hemodynamics  Afterload is a determinant of cardiac output. Cardiac output is the product of stroke volume and heart rate. Afterload is a determinant of stroke volume (in addition to preload, and strength of myocardial contraction). Following Laplace's law, the tension upon the muscle fibers in the heart wall is the pressure within the ventricle multiplied by the volume within the ventricle divided by the wall thickness (this ratio is the other factor in setting the afterload). Therefore, when comparing a normal heart to a heart with a dilated left ventricle, if the aortic pressure is the same in both hearts, the dilated heart must create a greater tension to overcome the same aortic pressure to eject blood because it has a larger internal radius and volume. Thus, the dilated heart has a greater total load (tension) on the myocytes, i.e., has a higher afterload. This is also true in the eccentric hypertrophy consequent to high intensity aerobic training. Conversely, a concentrically hypertrophied left ventricle may have a lower afterload for a given aortic pressure. When contractility becomes impaired and the ventricle dilates, the afterload rises and limits output. This may start a vicious circle, in which cardiac output is reduced as oxygen requirements are increased. Afterload can also be described as the pressure that the chambers of the heart must generate to eject blood from the heart, and thus is a consequence of aortic pressure (for the left ventricle) and pulmonic pressure or pulmonary artery pressure (for the right ventricle). The pressure in the ventricles must be greater than the systemic and pulmonary pressure to open the aortic and pulmonic valves, respectively. As afterload increases, cardiac output decreases. Cardiac imaging is a somewhat limited modality in defining afterload because it depends on the interpretation of volumetric data.  Calculating afterload  Quantitatively, afterload can be calculated by determining the wall stress of the left ventricle, using the Young‚ÄìLaplace equation: \\\\left ( \\\\frac{EDP \\\\cdot EDR}{2h} \\\\right ) where EDP is end diastolic pressure in the left ventricle, which is typically approximated by taking pulmonary artery wedge pressure, EDR is end diastolic radius at the midpoint of the left ventricle, and h is mean thickness of the left ventricle wall. Both radius and mean thickness of the left ventricle may be measured by echocardiography.  Factors affecting afterload  Disease processes pathology that include indicators such as an increasing left ventricular afterload include elevated blood pressure and aortic valve disease. Systemic hypertension (HTN) (elevated blood pressure) increases the left ventricular (LV) afterload because the LV must work harder to eject blood into the aorta. This is because the aortic valve won't open until the pressure generated in the left ventricle is higher than the elevated blood pressure in the aorta. Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is increased blood pressure within the right heart leading to the lungs. PH indicates a regionally applied increase in afterload dedicated to the right side of the heart, divided and isolated from the left heart by the interventricular septum. In the natural aging process, aortic stenosis often increases afterload because the left ventricle must overcome the pressure gradient caused by the calcified and stenotic aortic valve, in addition to the blood pressure required to eject blood into the aorta. For instance, if the blood pressure is 120/80, and the aortic valve stenosis creates a trans-valvular gradient of 30 mmHg, the left ventricle has to generate a pressure of 110 mmHg to open the aortic valve and eject blood into the aorta. Due to the increased afterload, the ventricle has to work harder to accomplish its goal of ejecting blood into the aorta. Thus, in the long-term, increased afterload (due to the stenosis) results in hypertrophy of the left ventricle to account for the increased work required. Aortic insufficiency (Aortic Regurgitation) increases afterload, because a percentage of the blood that ejects forward regurgitates back through the diseased aortic valve. This leads to elevated systolic blood pressure. The diastolic blood pressure in the aorta falls, due to regurgitation. This increases pulse pressure. Mitral regurgitation (MR) decreases afterload. In ventricular systole under MR, regurgitant blood flows backwards/retrograde back and forth through a diseased and leaking mitral valve. The remaining blood loaded into the LV is then optimally ejected out through the aortic valve. With an extra pathway for blood flow through the mitral valve, the left ventricle does not have to work as hard to eject its blood, i.e. there is a decreased afterload. Afterload is largely dependent upon aortic pressure.

His writings have been noted as being rooted in several literary genres ‚Äì most prominently weird fiction ‚Äì and have overall been described by many critics as works of philosophical horror, often formed into short stories and novellas in the tradition of gothic fiction. The worldview espoused by Ligotti in his fiction and non-fiction is pessimistic and nihilistic. The Washington Post called him \\"the best kept secret in contemporary horror fiction.\\"Blurb from Ligotti's The Nightmare Factory. Career Ligotti started his career as a published writer in the early 1980s with a number of short stories published in various American small press magazines. He was contributing editor to Grimoire from 1982 to 1985. In 2015, Ligotti's first two collections, Songs of a Dead Dreamer and Grimscribe: His Lives and Works, were republished in one volume by Penguin Classics as Songs of a Dead Dreamer and Grimscribe. Michael Calia of The Wall Street Journal wrote of the reprint that \\"Horror writer Thomas Ligotti is about to enter the American literary canon. Penguin Classics published a volume of Mr. Ligotti‚Äôs short stories, making him one of 10 living writers, including Thomas Pynchon and Don DeLillo, among the hundreds the imprint has published in the U.S.\\" Ligotti's work received high praise following the publication from the likes of The New York Times Book Review, the Los Angeles Review of Books, The Washington Post, and The New Yorker. Terrence Rafferty contrasts Ligotti with Stephen King, observing, \\"King, the great entertainer, needs the story as the comedian needs the joke, and when he can‚Äôt quite deliver it he dies (in the comedian‚Äôs sense). King is a master of horror, though. When inspiration fails, he has the technique to fake it. Thomas Ligotti is a master of a different order, practically a different species. He probably couldn‚Äôt fake it if he tried, and he never tries. He writes like horror incarnate.\\" Ligotti collaborated with the musical group Current 93 on the albums In a Foreign Town, In a Foreign Land (1997, reissued 2002), I Have a Special Plan for This World (2000), This Degenerate Little Town (2001) and The Unholy City (2003), all released on David Tibet's Durtro label. Tibet has also published several limited editions of Ligotti's books on Durtro Press. Additionally, Ligotti played guitar on Current 93's contribution to the compilation album Foxtrot, whose proceeds went to the treatment of musician John Balance's alcoholism. Personal life He has cited Thomas Bernhard, William S. Burroughs, Emil Cioran, Vladimir Nabokov, Edgar Allan Poe, Giacomo Leopardi, Samuel Beckett, Franz Kafka, and Bruno Schulz as being among his favorite writers. H. P. Lovecraft is also an important touchstone for Ligotti: a few stories, \\"The Sect of the Idiot\\" in particular, make explicit reference to Lovecraft's Cthulhu Mythos, and one, \\"The Last Feast of Harlequin\\", was dedicated to Lovecraft. Also among his avowed influences are Algernon Blackwood, M.R. James, and Arthur Machen, all fin de si√®cle horror authors known for their subtlety and implications of the cosmic and supernatural in their stories. He has also invoked the influence of philosophers such as Arthur Schopenhauer and Peter Wessel Zapffe. Ligotti has suffered from chronic anxiety and anhedonia for much of his life; these have been prominent themes in his work. Ligotti avoids the explicit violence common in some recent horror fiction, preferring to establish a disquieting, pessimistic atmosphere through the use of subtlety and repetition. Ligotti has stated he prefers short stories to longer forms, both as a reader and as a writer, though he has written a novella, My Work Is Not Yet Done (2002) Ligotti's ancestry is three-quarters Sicilian, one-quarter Polish, a genetic combination he likes to think \\"contributed to the bizarre quality of my imagination and to what has been called its 'universality'.\\" He says that his Polish grandmother's stories, though not horrific, \\"put me in touch with an older and stranger world than I would otherwise have known and that emerged when I started writing stories so many years later\\". Ligotti attended Macomb County Community College between 1971 and 1973 and graduated from Wayne State University in 1978. For 23 years Ligotti worked as an Associate Editor at Gale Research (now the Gale Group), a publishing company that produces compilations of literary (and other) research. In the summer of 2001, Ligotti quit his job at the Gale Group and moved to south Florida. He politically identifies as socialist. Influence In 2003, Wildside Press published The Thomas Ligotti Reader: Essays and Explorations, a collection of essays about Ligotti's edited by Darrell Schweitzer. Author Jeff VanderMeer has penned numerous pieces praising Ligotti's writing, including the introduction to the Penguin Classics edition of Songs of a Dead Dreamer and Grimscribe. In 2014, the HBO television series True Detective attracted attention from some of Ligotti's fans because of the striking resemblance between the pessimistic, antinatalist philosophy espoused in the first few episodes by the character of Rust Cohle (played by Matthew McConaughey) and Ligotti's own philosophical pessimism and antinatalism, especially as expressed in The Conspiracy Against the Human Race. After accusations that dialogue from Cohle's character in True Detective were lifted from The Conspiracy Against the Human Race, the series' writer, Nic Pizzolatto, confirmed in The Wall Street Journal that Ligotti, along with several other writers and texts in the weird supernatural horror genre, had indeed influenced him. Pizzolatto said he found The Conspiracy Against the Human Race to be \\"incredibly powerful writing\\". On the topic of hard-boiled detectives, he asked: \\"What could be more hardboiled than the worldview of Ligotti or [Emil] Cioran?\\" Bibliography *Songs of a Dead Dreamer (1985, rev. & exp. 1989) *Grimscribe: His Lives and Works (1991) *Noctuary (1994) *The Agonizing Resurrection of Victor Frankenstein and Other Gothic Tales (1994) *The Nightmare Factory (1996).

All three featured stories which ran the gamut from fantasy and science fiction to straight crime dramas of mystery and suspense. Radio Written and directed by Robert Arthur and David Kogan, the radio series was sponsored by Adam Hats. It began on the Mutual Broadcasting System, December 5, 1943, continuing in many different time slots until September 16, 1952. The lonely sound of a distant locomotive heralded the arrival of the sinister narrator (portrayed by Maurice Tarplin), who introduced himself each week in the following manner: :This is the Mysterious Traveler, inviting you to join me on another journey into the strange and terrifying. I hope you will enjoy the trip, that it will thrill you a little and chill you a little. So settle back, get a good grip on your nerves and be comfortable--if you can! Cast members included Jackson Beck, Lon Clark, Roger DeKoven, Elspeth Eric, Wendell Holmes, Bill Johnstone, Joseph Julian, Jan Miner, Santos Ortega, Bryna Raeburn, Frank Readick, Luis van Rooten, Ann Shepherd, Lawson Zerbe and Bill Zuckert. Sound effects were by Jack Amrhein, Jim Goode, Ron Harper, Walt McDonough and Al Schaffer. \\"Behind the Locked Door\\", a popular, much-requested episode which took place in total darkness, was repeated several times during the years. Two archaeologists discover a century-old wagon train that had been sealed in a cave following a landslide. When their Native American guide is mysteriously and brutally attacked, the two, now lost in the darkness, conclude that the descendants of the wagon train are still living in the cave. Only 75 of the original 370 Mysterious Traveler episodes still exist. The popularity of the series spawned other supernatural shows, such as The Sealed Book. With scripts by a Mysterious Traveler writer and Tarplin as host- narrator, The Strange Dr. Weird was a nearly identical program.Passage, Frank M. The Mysterious Traveler log Magazine Luis van Rooten on The Mysterious Traveler Grace Publishing's 1951-52 Mysterious Traveler digest-sized magazine ran for five issues with cover paintings by famed pulp illustrator Norman Saunders. The publisher was David Kogan, and managing editor Robert Arthur also contributed many stories. The first issue (November 1951) carried a welcome from the Mysterious Traveler himself: :This is the Mysterious Traveler, inviting you to join me on another journey into the realm of mystery and suspense. This time the trip is to be made in the pages of a magazine, rather than on the air. Thousands of letters have come to me from the many listeners who enjoy my weekly radio program on the Mutual Broadcasting System, urging me to put some of my stories into printed form. :This magazine is the answer. Some of the stories in it will be my own, retold for your enjoyment in fiction form by the finest writers of today. But many of the other stories will be favorites of mine, both new and old, written by the world's greatest craftsmen of the mystery--such men and women as John Dickson Carr, Dorothy L. Sayers, Brett Halliday, Ray Bradbury, Craig Rice, Lawrence Blochman, all of whom you will find in this issue, and dozens of others who will appear in the issues to come. :These stories, both new and old, will be the finest I can collect for your enjoyment. They will have mystery, suspense, inventiveness, color--and above all they will be good reading, just as I try to make The Mysterious Traveler on the air good listening. :I hope you will enjoy this magazine, now in your hands for the first time. I hope also that you will let me know if it satisfies you, what kind of stories you would prefer to see in future issues, the titles of any favorite stories you would like me to bring back into print again, or any other comments you wish to make. Write me at: Studio 4, 105 East 15th St., New York 3, New York.

Short story and biography Anthony Boucher's 1950 detective story anthology, Four-and-Twenty-Bloodhounds, paired each story with a brief biography of the detective. In the case of \\"The Big Money\\" by Robert Arthur, Boucher apologized to the reader: :The most disquieting moment in editing this anthology came when I received the biographical questionnaire filled in by the Mysterious Traveler. In answer to the first blank, born , he had simply inserted: ?. And the succeeding answers were equally disconcerting and not in all cases publishable--though I have forwarded a copy to Miskatonic University for its files. Suffice it that no one--not even his nominal creators, Robert Arthur and David Kogan--knows whether the Traveler is detective, criminal or neither.

The first 13 episodes were broadcast live, and the remainder were pre-recorded. Fred Wiehe and Edward King were the directors, and Norman Rose was heard as both announcer and narrator, opening the show with: \\"Adventures in time and space... told [or transcribed] in future tense...\\" For two months beginning on July 7, 1950 the series was sponsored by Wheaties. Overview Preceded by Mutual's 2000 Plus (1950‚Äì52), Dimension X was not the first adult science fiction series on radio, but the acquisition of previously published stories immediately gave it a strong standing with the science fiction community, as did the choice of well established, respected writers in the field: Isaac Asimov, Robert Bloch, Ray Bradbury, Fredric Brown, Robert A. Heinlein, Murray Leinster, H. Beam Piper, Frank M. Robinson, Clifford D. Simak, William Tenn, Jack Vance, Kurt Vonnegut, Jack Williamson and Donald A. Wollheim. Ernest Kinoy and George Lefferts adapted most of the stories and also provided original scripts. In Science Fiction Television (2004), M. Keith Booker wrote: :It was not until the 1950s that science fiction radio really hit its stride, even as science fiction was beginning to appear on television as well. Radio programs such as Mutual's 2000 Plus and NBC's Dimension X were anthology series that offered a variety of exciting tales of future technology, with a special focus on space exploration (including alien invasion), though both series also often reflected contemporary anxieties about the dangers of technology.Booker, M. Keith. Science Fiction Television. Connecticut: Praeger Publishers, 2004. The series opened with \\"The Outer Limit,\\" Ernest Kinoy's adaptation of Graham Doar's short story from The Saturday Evening Post (December 24, 1949) about alien contact. A week later (April 15, 1950), the program presented Jack Williamson's most famous story, \\"With Folded Hands,\\" first published in the July 1947 issue of Astounding Science Fiction. With a five-month hiatus from January 1951 to June 1951, the series spanned 17 months. All 50 episodes of the series survived and can be heard today. Later, NBC's X Minus One (1955‚Äì58) utilized many of the same actors and scripts.

However, the early 1970s brought a wave of nostalgia for old-time radio; a new experimental episode, \\"The Iron Chancellor\\" by Robert Silverberg, was produced in 1973, but it failed to revive the series. NBC also tried broadcasting the old recordings, but their irregular once-monthly scheduling kept even devoted listeners from following the broadcasts.

He was the British flat racing Champion Jockey 26 times and is often considered the world's greatest ever jockey. He remains the only flat jockey to have been knighted. Early life Gordon Richards was brought up in the Shropshire village of Donnington Wood (now part of Telford), the son of a Shropshire coal miner. His father reared several pit ponies at their home, and it was in this environment that Sir Gordon fostered his love of the equestrian. He rode the ponies bareback from an early age, then from the age of seven, drove the pony and trap passenger service his family ran between Wrockwardine Wood and Oakengates station. It was at that age no doubt that he developed his unique riding style, using a long rein and an upright stance. He had two brothers, Colin and Clifford, who shared this love of horses and also became jockeys: the latter was a Classic winning jockey. Career After leaving school he took the first step towards becoming a jockey, becoming a stable boy aged 15 at Fox Hollies Stable in Wiltshire, owned by Jimmy White. It wasn't long before his riding skills were noticed by his new employer, who gave him his first ride in a race at Lincoln. Not long after his debut he won his first race at Leicester in March 1921. With the determination and single-mindedness that was his trademark, he achieved his dream of becoming a full-fledged jockey in 1925, and went on to become Champion Jockey in his first year, notching up 118 wins. Early in 1926, five years after Richards' racing debut, disaster struck the Shropshire jockey. He contracted tuberculosis and had to take time out from racing. But it was while he recuperated from the debilitating disease in a Norfolk sanatorium he met Bill Rowell, a fellow patient who was to have a major influence on his life. Rowell proved to be something of a mentor, teaching the young jockey how to cope with the riches that would come his way, as well as his popularity with high society in the class-ridden system that prevailed in Britain between the wars. The two became firm friends. By December 1926, Richards was back in the saddle, and returned to winning ways in the 1927 racing season. In 1932 he became stable jockey to Fred Darling, and that season, with 259 victories under his belt, he broke the record for the greatest number of wins in a year, a record he was to keep for nearly 50 years (he broke his own record in 1947 when riding 269 winners). The following year he set a world record winning twelve consecutive races including riding all six winners at Chepstow on 4 October.http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1133630/1/index.htm Achievement followed achievement, with Richards winning the 1947 2,000 Guineas at Newmarket Racecourse aboard Tudor Minstrel by 8 lengths, the largest winning margin in the race since 1900. Despite these huge successes, there was still one race where a win had always eluded him: The Epsom Derby. In 1942 he won 4 of the 5 'Classics' on horses, but still the big Derby win he craved remained out of his grasp. The 1953 Derby occurred on a week of great national, and personal celebration for Richards himself, as he became the first jockey to receive a knighthood. This time Sir Gordon rode Pinza, a huge horse for a flat-thoroughbred at 16 hands high, and he rode a terrific race. Pinza was in second position through much of the one and half mile (2414 m) course, competing against the Queen's own horse Aureole, and sweeping past the Aga Khan III's horse, Shikampur, into first place with just two furlongs (402 m) remaining. The long-awaited win was accompanied by thunderous cheers from the frenzied crowd. Winning The Derby was undoubtedly Sir Gordon's crowning victory, and he was promptly summoned from the winners' enclosure to be congratulated by the Queen. Sir Gordon's riding career ended in 1954 following a pelvis injury, but he continued to indulge his passion for racing, by becoming a horse trainer and advisor. As a trainer his main owners were the partnership of Sir Michael Sobell and his son-in-law Lord Weinstock. They placed their first horse, London Cry, with Richards in 1957 and he went on to win the Camridgeshire Handicap of 1958. He also trained for Lady Beaverbrook when she took up her interest in racing. An early owner was Dorothy Paget and when she died he was an influence in Sobell and Weinstock purchasing her stud (Ballymacoll Stud), breeding and racing stock. Training first at Ogbourne in Wiltshire and then at Whitsbury Stables in Hampshire, he sent out many winners and his best horse was the Sobell/Weinstock owned Reform. This colt won 11 of his 14 starts and his victories included the Champion Stakes, St James Palace Stakes and the Sussex Stakes. In addition he trained good horses such as Sunny Cove, Dart Board, Greengage and Pipe of Peace. His stable jockey for much of his training career was Scobie Breasley and when he retired Edward Hide took over. At the end of the 1970 season he was forced to retire from training. The details were that William Hill wished to restart his breeding operation from Whitsbury (which he leased to Richards). Sobell/Weinstock negotiated to buy West Ilsley Stables from Jakie Astor, but a stipulation of the purchase was that incumbent trainer, Dick Hern, and stable jockey, Joe Mercer, remained in place at West Ilsley. Given this situation he took up the role of Racing Manager in 1971 to Sir Michael Sobell and Lord Weinstock and Lady Beaverbrook and continued as such until his death. In this capacity he worked closely with Hern and was particularly active in the purchasing of yearlings for Lady Beaverbrook. Under his management these owners had tremendous success with horses such as Sun Prince, Sallust, Admetus, Cistus, Troy and Sun Princess (for Sobell/Weinstock) and Boldboy, Bustino, Relkino, Niniski and Petoski (for Lady Beaverbrook). Death and legacy He died in 1986. His funeral service was held at St Mary's, Kintbury, Berkshire, and he was buried at St Mary's Church, Marlborough, Wiltshire. horseracinghistory.co.uk Richards, Gordon (1904‚Äì1986). His legacy lives on in Shropshire today, with the Champion Jockey pub (now demolished) in Donnington named in his honour, and the 'Pinza Suite' in Oakengates Theatre, named after his winning horse. Not until 2002 was his record number of victories in a season exceeded, by jump jockey Tony McCoy. However, McCoy was able to utilise modern technology by flying between tracks and therefore compete in more races than Sir Gordon was able to. Richards' total of 4,870 winners is still a British Record. He also holds the record for the most consecutive winners ridden; 12 (half at a night meeting). He was British flat racing Champion Jockey a record 26 times.

However, they are poisoned by high concentrations of oxygen. They gather in the upper part of the test tube but not the very top. 5: Aerotolerant anaerobes do not require oxygen as they use fermentation to make ATP. Unlike obligate anaerobes, they are not poisoned by oxygen. They can be found evenly spread throughout the test tube. A facultative anaerobe is an organism that makes ATP by aerobic respiration if oxygen is present, but is capable of switching to fermentation if oxygen is absent. Some examples of facultatively anaerobic bacteria are Staphylococcus spp., Escherichia coli, Salmonella, Listeria spp., Shewanella oneidensis and Yersinia pestis.

The Black Museum is a radio crime-drama program produced by Harry Alan Towers in London. It was broadcast in Europe on Radio Luxembourg, a commercial radio station, and was not broadcast by the BBC until 1991. In 1946 Towers and his mother, Margaret Miller Towers, started a company called Towers of London that sold various syndicated radio shows around the world, including The Lives of Harry Lime with Orson Welles, The Secrets of Scotland Yard with Clive Brook, Horatio Hornblower with Michael Redgrave, and a series of Sherlock Holmes stories featuring John Gielgud as Holmes, Ralph Richardson as Watson and Welles as Moriarty. The Black Museum was based on real-life cases from the files of Scotland Yard's Black Museum. The program was transcribed in 1951 and was broadcast in the United States in 1952 on Mutual. More than 500 of the network's stations carried it. Ira Marion was the scriptwriter, and music for the series was composed and conducted by Sidney Torch. This same music was used for the opening credits of, and incidental music in, the 1955 film They Can't Hang Me, starring Terence Morgan. Orson Welles was both host and narrator for stories of horror and mystery, based on Scotland Yard's collection of murder weapons and various ordinary objects once associated with historical true crime cases. The show's opening began: :This is Orson Welles, speaking from London. :(Sound of Big Ben chimes) :The Black Museum... a repository of death. Here in the grim stone structure on the Thames which houses Scotland Yard is a warehouse of homicide, where everyday objects... a woman‚Äôs shoe, a tiny white box, a quilted robe... all are touched by murder. In 2002, Towers produced The Black Museum for television and hired director Gregory Mackenzie to be the showrunner and director for the anthology series using the original narration by Welles. The adaptation was shot on location in London in a film noir style and the pilot stars Michael York as the Scotland Yard Inspector Russel. Programme format and themes Walking through the museum, Welles would pause at one of the exhibits, and his description of an artifact served as a device to lead into a wryly-narrated dramatised tale of a brutal murder or a vicious crime. In the closing: \\"Now until we meet again in the same place and I tell you another tale of the Black Museum\\", Welles would conclude with his signature radio phrase, \\"I remain, as always, obediently yours\\". With the story themes deriving from objects in the collection (usually with the names of the people involved changed but the facts remaining true to history), the 51 episodes had such titles as \\"The Tartan Scarf\\" and \\"A Piece of Iron Chain\\" or \\"Frosted Glass Shards\\" and \\"A Khaki Handkerchief\\". An anomaly to the series was an episode called \\"The Letter\\" as this was the only story not about murder, but about forgery.  Broadcast history  In the United States, the series aired on the Mutual Network in 1952. It was rebroadcast on KABC, Los Angeles, California, in 1963‚Äì1964 and on KUAC (FM) in Fairbanks, Alaska, in 1967. Beginning May 7, 1953, it was also broadcast over Radio Luxembourg sponsored by the cleaning products Dreft and Mirro. Since the BBC carried no commercials, Radio Luxembourg aired sponsored programs at night to England. In the United States, there was a contemporary programme called Whitehall 1212 written and directed by Wyllis Cooper and broadcast by NBC, that was similar in scope to The Black Museum. It was hosted by Chief Superintendent John Davidson, curator of the Black Museum. It used many of the same picked cases as The Black Museum, and it nearly mirrored its broadcast run. The two shows were different in the respect that while Whitehall 1212 told the story of a case entirely from the point of view of the police starting from the crime scene, The Black Museum was more heavily dramatized and played out scenes of the actual murders and included scenes from the criminal's point of view.

Early life  Born in Little Rock, Arkansas, Adler grew up mostly in New York City. She attended The High School of Music & Art (later joined with LaGuardia High School) in New York City.\\"Our Alumni,\\" Alumni & Friends of LaGuardia High School website. Accessed Oct. 31, 2016. Her grandfather, Alfred Adler, was a noted Austrian Jewish psychotherapist, collaborator with Sigmund Freud and the founder of the school of individual psychology.  Education  Adler received a bachelor of arts in political science from the University of California, Berkeley and a master's degree from the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism in New York in 1970. She was a Nieman Fellow at Harvard University in 1982.  Journalism and radio  At the headquarters of NPR in Washington, DC, Margot Adler is honored with a memorial bench. During the mid-1960s, Adler worked as a volunteer reporter for KPFA-FM, the Pacifica Radio station in Berkeley, California. After returning to New York City, she worked at its sister station, WBAI-FM, where, in 1972, she created the talk show Hour of the Wolf (still on the air as hosted by Jim Freund), and later another talk show, called Unstuck in Time. Adler joined NPR in 1979 as a general assignment reporter, after spending a year as an NPR freelance reporter covering New York City, and subsequently worked on a great many pieces dealing with subjects as diverse as the death penalty, the right to die movement, the response to the war in Kosovo, computer gaming, the drug ecstasy, geek culture, children and technology and Pok√©mon. After 9/11, she focused much of her work on stories exploring the human factors in New York City, from the loss of loved ones, homes and jobs, to work in the relief effort. She was the host of Justice Talking up until the show ceased production on July 3, 2008. She was a regular voice on Morning Edition and All Things Considered. She was also co-producer of an award-winning radio drama, War Day.  Neopaganism  Adler wrote Drawing Down the Moon,Viking Press 1979; revised ed. Beacon Press 1987, and Penguin Books 1997 a 1979 book about Neopaganism which was revised in 2006.Drawing Down the Moon Spotlight in The Wiccan Pagan Times The book is considered by some a watershed in American Neopagan circles, as it provided the first comprehensive look at modern nature-based religions in the US. For many years it was the only introductory work about American Neopagan communities. Her second book, Heretic's Heart: A Journey Through Spirit and Revolution, was published by Beacon Press in 1997. Adler was a Wiccan priestess, an elder in the Covenant of the Goddess, and she also participated in the Unitarian Universalist faith community.  Death  In early 2011, Adler was diagnosed with endometrial cancer, which metastasized over the following three years. Adler died on July 28, 2014 at the age of 68. She remained virtually symptom-free until mid-2014. Adler was cared for in her final months by her son.

Some phoneticians distinguish upper pharyngeal consonants, or \\"high\\" pharyngeals, pronounced by retracting the root of the tongue in the mid to upper pharynx, from (ary)epiglottal consonants, or \\"low\\" pharyngeals, which are articulated with the aryepiglottic folds against the epiglottis in the lower larynx, as well as from epiglotto- pharyngeal consonants, with both movements being combined. Stops and trills can be reliably produced only at the epiglottis, and fricatives can be reliably produced only in the upper pharynx. When they are treated as distinct places of articulation, the term radical consonant may be used as a cover term, or the term guttural consonants may be used instead. In many languages, pharyngeal consonants trigger advancement of neighboring vowels. Pharyngeals thus differ from uvulars, which nearly always trigger retraction. For example, in some dialects of Arabic, the vowel is fronted to [√¶] next to pharyngeals, but it is retracted to next to uvulars, as in ÿ≠ÿßŸÑ 'condition', with a pharyngeal fricative and a fronted vowel, compared to ÿÆÿßŸÑ 'maternal uncle', with a uvular consonant and a retracted vowel. In addition, consonants and vowels may be secondarily pharyngealized. Also, strident vowels are defined by an accompanying epiglottal trill.

Voiced epiglottal affricate  Haida (Hydaburg Dialect)    } :*A voiced epiglottal stop may not be possible. When an epiglottal stop becomes voiced intervocalically in Dahalo, for example, it becomes a tap. Phonetically, however, voiceless vs voiced affricates or off- glides are attested: (Esling 2010: 695). :** Although traditionally placed in the fricative row of the IPA chart, is usually an approximant. Frication is difficult to produce or to distinguish because the voicing in the glottis and the constriction in the pharynx are so close to each other (Esling 2010: 695, after Laufer 1996). The IPA symbol is ambiguous, but no language distinguishes fricative and approximant at this place of articulation. For clarity, the lowering diacritic may used to specify that the manner is approximant () and a raising diacritic to specify that the manner is fricative (). The Hydaburg dialect of Haida has a trilled epiglottal and a trilled epiglottal affricate ~. (There is some voicing in all Haida affricates, but it is analyzed as an effect of the vowel.) For transcribing disordered speech, the extIPA provides symbols for upper-pharyngeal stops, ‚ü®‚ü© and ‚ü®‚ü©. Place of articulation The IPA first distinguished epiglottal consonants in 1989, with a contrast between pharyngeal and epiglottal fricatives, but advances in laryngoscopy since then have caused specialists to re-evaluate their position. Since a trill can be made only in the pharynx with the aryepiglottic folds (in the pharyngeal trill of the northern dialect of Haida, for example), and incomplete constriction at the epiglottis, as would be required to produce epiglottal fricatives, generally results in trilling, there is no contrast between (upper) pharyngeal and epiglottal based solely on place of articulation. Esling (2010) thus restores a unitary pharyngeal place of articulation, with the consonants being described by the IPA as epiglottal fricatives differing from pharyngeal fricatives in their manner of articulation rather than in their place: Edmondson et al. distinguish several subtypes of pharyngeal consonant.Edmondson, Jerold A., John H. Esling, Jimmy G. Harris, & Huang Tung- chiou (n.d.) \\"A laryngoscopic study of glottal and epiglottal/pharyngeal stop and continuant articulations in Amis‚Äîan Austronesian language of Taiwan\\" Pharyngeal or epiglottal stops and trills are usually produced by contracting the aryepiglottic folds of the larynx against the epiglottis. That articulation has been distinguished as aryepiglottal. In pharyngeal fricatives, the root of the tongue is retracted against the back wall of the pharynx. In a few languages, such as Achumawi, Amis of TaiwanVideo clips and perhaps some of the Salishan languages, the two movements are combined, with the aryepiglottic folds and epiglottis brought together and retracted against the pharyngeal wall, an articulation that has been termed epiglotto- pharyngeal. The IPA does not have diacritics to distinguish this articulation from standard aryepiglottals; Edmondson et al. use the ad hoc, somewhat misleading, transcriptions and . There are, however, several diacritics for subtypes of pharyngeal sound among the Voice Quality Symbols. Although upper- pharyngeal plosives are not found in the world's languages, apart from the rear closure of some click consonants, they occur in disordered speech. See voiceless upper-pharyngeal plosive and voiced upper-pharyngeal plosive. Distribution Pharyngeals are known primarily from three areas of the world: in the Middle East and North Africa, in the Semitic (e.g. Arabic, Hebrew, Tigrinya, and Tigre), Berber and Cushitic (e.g. Somali) language families; in the Caucasus, in the Northwest, and Northeast Caucasian language families; and in British Columbia, in Haida and the Salishan and Wakashan language families. There are scattered reports of pharyngeals elsewhere, as in Central (Sorani) and Northern (Kurmanji) Kurdish, Marshallese, the Nilo- Saharan language Tama, the Siouan language Stoney (Nakoda), and the Achumawi language of California. The approximant is more common, as it is a realization of /r/ in such European languages as Danish and Swabian German. According to the laryngeal theory, Proto-Indo-European might have had pharyngeal consonants. The fricatives and trills (the pharyngeal and epiglottal fricatives) are frequently conflated with pharyngeal fricatives in literature. That was the case for Dahalo and Northern Haida, for example, and it is likely to be true for many other languages. The distinction between these sounds was recognized by IPA only in 1989, and it was little investigated until the 1990s.

Barberi is one of two Barberi-class ferry boats operated as part of the Staten Island Ferry between Manhattan and Staten Island in New York City, besides MV Samuel I. Newhouse. With a capacity of 6,000, she is among the highest-capacity boats in the ferry's fleet. Since her introduction in 1981, she has had a history of incidents, including a 2003 crash that killed eleven people and a 2010 crash that injured thirty-seven. Andrew J. Barberi was named after the longtime coach of Curtis High School's football team, who had died shortly before the ship was commissioned. Barberi coached throughout the 1950s, '60s and '70s and was instrumental in the development of scholastic football on Staten Island. 2003 accident On October 15, 2003, Andrew J. Barberi was involved in a fatal accident. Eleven people died, including one decapitation, and 70 more were injured (including one man who lost his legs), as a result of Andrew J. Barberi colliding with a pier on Staten Island. On March 8, 2005, the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) published a report on its investigation into the incident. The NTSB determined the probable cause of the collision was the assistant pilot's unexplained sudden incapacitation, with a contributory cause of the Master's failure to maintain command and control of his vessel. 60 Minutes uncovered that the assistant pilot was short on sleep when he crashed the boat. The assistant pilot tried to commit suicide after the crash and admitted he had passed out on painkillers in the boat's pilothouse. He later pleaded guilty to 11 counts of seaman's manslaughter. The ferry director also pleaded guilty after failing to enforce a rule requiring that ferries be operated by two pilots. Andrew J. Barberi was rebuilt in West Brighton, Staten Island by Caddell Dry Dock & Repair Co. and on July 1, 2004, returned to regular service. 2010 accident =Incident= At approximately 9:00 a.m. on May 8, 2010, Andrew J. Barberi left Manhattan on her regularly scheduled crossing to the Staten Island terminal. The weather was calm with light winds, good visibility, and an ebbing tide. Aboard the vessel were 244 passengers, 18 crewmembers, 2 NYPD officers, and 2 concessionaires. As per standard procedure, both the captain and assistant captain were present in the Staten Island-end pilothouse. At 9:16, as Andrew J. Barberi was passing the Kill Van Kull buoy, the assistant captain began to reduce engine rpm and pitch in preparation for docking. The vessel initially responded as commanded, with AIS data indicating that the vessel had reduced speed slightly. Because Andrew J. Barberi was not equipped with a voyage data recorder at the time of the collision, it is impossible to determine exactly when the vessel failed to respond to the assistant captain's commands. When Andrew J. Barberi was approximately halfway between the KVK buoy and the Staten Island terminal, the captain asked the assistant captain to reduce speed. The assistant captain replied affirmatively and began to input reduced Pitch commands. As the vessel rapidly approached the slip, the captain ordered the assistant captain to input a full reverse pitch command. The assistant captain complied and input the ordered pitch command. At the same time, the captain increased engine rpm in order to produce more astern thrust. At this moment the assistant captain became aware that the propulsion units were not following his commands, so he repeatedly pushed the control levels downward to repeat his astern command. In the engine control room, the chief engineer began to notice that the sounds of the engines were not normal for this stage of the voyage. By watching a television mounted in the control room, an oiler became aware of the impending collision and notified the chief engineer. The chief engineer then ordered the engineering crew members to brace themselves for the collision. Up in the pilothouse, the Captain began to sound the whistle and issue the danger signal. The mate issued a brace command over the vessel's public address system and deckhands began to move passengers away from the vessel's bow. At 0918:33, Andrew J. Barberi forcefully collided with the terminal.The moment of the collision between Andrew J. Barberi and the Staten Island Terminal. As the collision occurred, many passengers who had not braced for impact were thrown to the floor. Eyewitness accounts of the incident mention that some passengers were thrown against glass doors and windows while others appeared to be thrown into the air by the force of the collision. Some passengers appeared to be emotionally disturbed by the incident and were observed weeping after the collision. Because the terminal's shore side transition bridge was free- floating, it is believed that the bridge absorbed some of the collision's energy. As a result of the impact, the transition bridge was lifted to a high of 5 feet above Andrew J. Barberi‚Äôs main deck and shifted back into a security fence. In the terminal, passengers waiting to embark described the collision as earthquake-like, shaking the entire building. Some passengers in the terminal began to run, fearing the vessel would break through the building. Once the vessel came to rest, the assistant captain input a no-pitch, or neutral, command into the propulsion units. After the impact, one of the two NYPD officers on board the ferry radioed for assistance. Upon receiving the officer's call, the NYPD's Ferry Security Division began to mobilize police resources to the scene of the collision. The NYPD also notified the USCG and FDNY. FDNY arrived approximately seven minutes later and began to administer first aid and search for any passengers who may have been thrown overboard by the collision. Around 40 passengers were taken to a local hospital for a variety of injuries. The remaining passengers disembarked via a gangway that had been placed between the vessel's main deck and the displaced transition bridge. Below deck, the vessel's engineers began to check the vessel for damage. The only damage was found above the waterline of the Staten Island end of the vessel. =Cause= Fractured bronze ring inside of a failed solenoid valve from Andrew J. Barberi. The initial discovery of the problem with the vessel's propulsion system occurred when the Barberi's chief engineer went up to the pilothouse after the collision. The engineer found that even though the pitch levers were in the neutral position, the propeller pitch indicator for the New York-end unit read out 50% thrust. This indication was confirmed by the stream of water that was being pushed away from the stern of the vessel. The chief engineer then unsuccessfully attempted to bring the propulsion unit to zero pitch using the pilothouse controls. Control of the propulsion units was transferred to the engine room, where the crew used the units‚Äô local controls to bring the pitch to zero. When the crew later attempted to back the Barberi out of the terminal using these local controls, both propulsion units functioned normally. On May 10, 2010, NTSB inspectors attempted to replicate the problem with the pilothouse controls. Because the vessel was docked during the testing, the units were tested without the engines running. Hydraulic pressure to the units was supplied by electric standby pumps, which limited the maximum attainable pitch command to 75%. When a full ahead pitch command was input from either pilothouse, both units responded normally. When a neutral pitch command was then input, the Staten Island end propulsion unit responded normally to the command, while the New York end unit remained locked at 75% thrust. When control was subsequently transferred to the engine room, both propulsion units responded normally to commands. The investigators then turned their attention to the New York-end's propulsion control panel. In this panel, electric solenoids were used to shift hydraulic valves. These valves sent hydraulic oil to the control cylinders on the propulsion units, shifting the pitch setting of the units. The panel was removed from the vessel and sent to the NTSB's material laboratory. Upon disassembling the ahead/astern solenoids on the panel, investigators found bronze ring fragments. These ring fragments had lodged themselves in the solenoids, preventing their correct operation. Due to the nature of the damage that the rings had sustained, NTSB investigators were unable to determine why they had originally fractured.

CSA was specified by ETSI and adopted by the DVB consortium in May 1994. It is being succeeded by CSA3, based on a combination of 128-bit AES and a confidential block cipher, XRC. However, CSA3 is not yet in any significant use, so CSA continues to be the dominant cipher for protecting DVB broadcasts. History CSA was largely kept secret until 2002. The patent papers gave some hints, but important details, like the layout of the so-called S-boxes, remained secret. Without these, free implementations of the algorithm was not possible. Initially, CSA was to remain implemented in hardware only, making it difficult to reverse engineer existing implementations. In 2002 FreeDec was released, implementing CSA in software. Though released as binary only, disassembly revealed the missing details and allowed reimplementation of the algorithm in higher-level programming languages. With CSA now publicly known in its entirety, cryptanalysts started looking for weaknesses.  Description of the cipher  The CSA algorithm is composed of two distinct ciphers: a block cipher and a stream cipher. When used in encryption mode the data are first encrypted using the 64 bits block cipher in CBC mode, starting from packet end. The stream cipher is then applied from packet start. = Block cipher = The block cipher process 64 bits blocks in 56 rounds. It uses 1 byte from expanded key on each round. Block cipher encryption = Stream cipher = The first 32 round of the stream cipher are used for initialization and do not generate any output. The first 64 bits of data are used as initialization vector during this phase and are left unchanged. The stream cipher then generates 2 bits of pseudo-random stream on each round which are xored starting at bit 64 of the packet. Stream cipher details Weaknesses Were CSA to be broken, encrypted DVB transmissions would be decipherable, which would compromise paid digital television services, as DVB has been standardised for digital terrestrial television in Europe and elsewhere, and is used by many satellite television providers. Most attacks on the pay-TV system have not targeted CSA itself, but instead the various key exchange systems responsible for generating the CSA keys (Conax, Irdeto, VideoGuard, etc.), either by reverse-engineering and breaking the algorithms altogether, or by intercepting the keys in real-time as they are generated on a legitimate decoder, and then distributing them to others (so-called card sharing). =Software implementations and bit slicing= The stream cipher part of CSA is prone to bit slicing, a software implementation technique which allows decryption of many blocks, or the same block with many different keys, at the same time. This significantly speeds up a brute force search implemented in software, although the factor is too low for a practical real-time attack. The block cipher part is harder to bit slice, as the S-boxes involved are too large (8x8) to be efficiently implemented using logical operations, a prerequisite for bit slicing to be more efficient than a regular implementation. However, as all operations are on 8-bit subblocks, the algorithm can be implemented using regular SIMD, or a form of ‚Äúbyteslicing‚Äù. As most SIMD instruction sets, (with the exception of AVX2) do not support parallel look-up tables, the S-box lookups are done in a non-bytesliced implementation, but their integration into the rest of the algorithm is not hampered markedly by the byteslicing. Both techniques are used in libdvbcsa, a free implementation of CSA. =Cryptanalysis= Cryptanalysis is made more difficult as most data is protected both by the block and the stream cipher. Adaption codes can result in packets with some data protected by only the block cipher or the stream cipher.http://sec.cs.kent.ac.uk/cms2004/Program/CMS2004final/p5a1.pdf =Brute force approach= While the CSA algorithm uses 64-bit keys, most of the time, only 48 bits of the key are unknown, since bytes 3 and 7 are used as parity bytes in CA systems, and may be easily recalculated. This allows for possible known-plaintext attacks when combined with knowledge of the underlying plaintext structure. As the first three bytes of the PES header is always 0x000001, it would be possible to launch a brute force attack. Such an attack would reveal millions of possible keys, but still few enough to make it practical to attempt decryption of other parts of the data with the same key in a second pass to recover the true key. =Known-plaintext attack= In 2011, a group of German researchers released an attack on CSA as used in the DVB system. By noting that MPEG-2 padding frequently requires long series of zeroes, leading to entire 184-byte cells being encrypted with zeroes only, it is possible to build up a rainbow table recovering the key from such a known- zero block. (A block would be known to be zero if two blocks with the same ciphertext were found, since presumably both would be zero blocks.) The attack described would require about 7.9 TB of storage, and enable an attacker with a GPU to recover a key in about seven seconds with 96.8% certainty. However, the attack is only effective when such all-zero padding blocks are present (i.e., in scenes with very little movement or noise), and it would be easily mitigated by for instance sending such all-zero cells unencrypted. This differs from the brute-force attack examples already mentioned, in that the plain-text contents of the entire cell is known before the attack, not just parts of a block, which enables the ahead-of-time computation of the rainbow table. =Fault attack= In 2004, a fault attack was published on the block cipher. The basic idea was to introduce a few deliberate faults in the intermediate calculations, making it possible to deduce the last eight round keys. From this, the final key can be computed. While very few faults are needed (on average two or three per round key recovered), fault attacks are usually impractical to carry out, in that it requires the ability to change bits at will inside the hardware of a decoder that already has the key in question.

It is especially important in increasing venous return to the heart, but may also play a role in arterial blood flow. General The skeletal pump is vital in negating orthostatic intolerance when standing. When moving upright, the blood volume moves to the peripheral parts of the body. To combat this the muscles involved in standing contract and help to bring venous blood volume to the heart. The pump is important in affecting the central and local supply of blood output. Venous return, cardiac output, and stroke volume were all increased during exercise experiments, as well as affecting the local muscle being used, blood volume. Arterial blood pumping Between muscle relaxations intramuscular pressure transiently returns to a level below the venous blood pressure and blood from the capillary system refills the veins until the next contraction. It is postulated that this change in pressure may be great enough to draw blood from the arterial side to the venous side. It is hypothesized that this pressure drop during rhythmic contraction actually increases blood flow through the muscle and may be responsible for a portion of the increase in muscle blood flow immediately at the onset of activity.Sheriff D. Point: The muscle pump raises muscle blood flow during locomotion. J Appl Physiol. 2005 Jul;99(1):371-2. While this explanation is attractive because it would explain the readily observable tight coupling between muscle contraction and a rapid increase in muscle blood flow, recent evidence has emerged that cast doubts on this theory. Experiments have shown that a strong muscle contraction can occur without a corresponding increase in skeletal muscle blood flow.Hamann, J. J., J. B. Buckwalter, and P. S. Clifford. Vasodilation is obligatory for contraction-induced hyperemia in canine skeletal muscle. Journal of Physiology (London). 557:1013-1020, 2004. Given the proposed manner of action of the muscle pump to increase arterial blood flow, it would seem impossible for a muscle contraction and skeletal muscle hyperemia to be uncoupled. Another experiment recently was only able to find evidence that vasodilation, not the skeletal muscle pump was responsible for maintaining proper pressure and blood return. However, this might have to do with the lack of rigorous physiological tests thus far used to be able to prove the pump. Experiments have shown the use of passive leg exercises where only vasodilation was responsible for increased blood return.

In most countries, cardiac surgery (involving the heart and the great vessels) and general thoracic surgery (involving the lungs, esophagus, thymus, etc.) are separate surgical specialties; the exceptions are the United States, Australia, New Zealand, and some EU countries, such as the United Kingdom and Portugal. Training A cardiac surgery residency typically comprises anywhere from 4 to 6 years (or longer) of training to become a fully qualified surgeon. Cardiac surgery training may be combined with thoracic surgery and / or vascular surgery and called cardiovascular (CV) / cardiothoracic (CT) / cardiovascular thoracic (CVT) surgery. Cardiac surgeons may enter a cardiac surgery residency directly from medical school, or first complete a general surgery residency followed by a fellowship. Cardiac surgeons may further sub-specialize cardiac surgery by doing a fellowship in a variety of topics including: pediatric cardiac surgery, cardiac transplantation, adult acquired heart disease, weak heart issues, and many more problems in the heart. =Australia and New Zealand= The highly competitive Surgical Education and Training (SET) program in Cardiothoracic Surgery is six years in duration, usually commencing several years after completing medical school. Training is administered and supervised via a bi- national (Australia and New Zealand) training program. Multiple examinations take place throughout the course of training, culminating in a final fellowship exam in the final year of training. Upon completion of training, surgeons are awarded a Fellowship of the Royal Australasian College of Surgeons (FRACS), denoting that they are qualified specialists. Trainees having completed a training program in General Surgery and have obtained their FRACS will have the option to complete fellowship training in Cardiothoracic Surgery of four year in duration, subject to college approval. It takes around eight to ten years minimum of post-graduate (post-medical school) training to qualify as a cardiothoracic surgeon. Competition for training places and for public (teaching) hospital places is very high currently, leading to concerns regarding workforce planning in Australia. =Canada= Historically, cardiac surgeons in Canada completed general surgery followed by a fellowship in CV / CT / CVT. During the 1990s, the Canadian cardiac surgery training programs changed to six-year \\"direct-entry\\" programs following medical school. The direct-entry format provides residents with experience related to cardiac surgery they would not receive in a general surgery program (e.g. echocardiography, coronary care unit, cardiac catheterization etc.). Residents in this program will also spend time training in thoracic and vascular surgery. Typically, this is followed by a fellowship in either Adult Cardiac Surgery, Heart Failure/Transplant, Minimally Invasive Cardiac Surgery, Aortic Surgery, Thoracic Surgery, Pediatric Cardiac Surgery or Cardiac ICU. Contemporary Canadian candidates completing general surgery and wishing to pursue cardiac surgery often complete a cardiothoracic surgery fellowship in the United States. The Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada also provides a three-year cardiac surgery fellowship for qualified general surgeons that is offered at several training sites including the University of Alberta, the University of British Columbia and the University of Toronto. Thoracic surgery is its own separate 2-3 year fellowship of general or cardiac surgery in Canada. Cardiac surgery programs in Canada: *University of Alberta - 1 position *University of British Columbia - 1 position *University of Calgary - 1 position *Dalhousie University - 1 position every other year *Universit√© Laval - 1 position every three years *University of Manitoba - 1 position *McGill University - 1 position every three years *McMaster University - 1 position every other year *Universit√© de Montr√©al - 1 position every three years *University of Ottawa - 1 position *University of Toronto - 1 position *Western University - 1 position =United Kingdom= In the United Kingdom, cardiac surgeons are trained by direct specialty training or through core surgical training. Through the core surgical training route, trainees can apply on their third year for specific training in cardiothoracic surgery. Thereafter, they may choose to subspecialise in areas such as aortic surgery, adult cardiac surgery, thoracic surgery, paediatric cardiothoracic surgery, and adult congenital surgery. =United States= Surgeon operating. Cardiac surgery training in the United States is combined with general thoracic surgery and called cardiothoracic surgery or thoracic surgery. A cardiothoracic surgeon in the U.S. is a physician (M.D. or D.O.) who first completes a general surgery residency (typically 5‚Äì7 years), followed by a cardiothoracic surgery fellowship (typically 2‚Äì3 years). The cardiothoracic surgery fellowship typically spans two or three years, but certification is based on the number of surgeries performed as the operating surgeon, not the time spent in the program, in addition to passing rigorous board certification tests. Recently, however, options for an integrated 6-year cardiothoracic residency (in place of the general surgery residency plus cardiothoracic residency) have been established at many programs (over 20). Applicants match into these I-6 programs directly out of medical school, and the application process has been extremely competitive for these positions as there were approximately 160 applicants for 10 spots in the U.S. in 2010. As of May 2013, there are now 20 approved programs, which include the following: Integrated 6 year Cardiothoracic Surgery programs in the United States: * Medical College of Wisconsin * Stanford University - 2 positions * University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill * University of Virginia * Columbia University - 2 positions * University of Pennsylvania * University of Pittsburgh - 2 positions * University of Washington * Northwestern University * Mount Sinai Hospital, New York * University of Maryland * University of California, Los Angeles UCLA - 2 resident positions, 1 Transplant Fellowship; 1 Congenital resident position * University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio * Medical University of South Carolina * University of Southern California - 2 positions * University of Rochester * University of California, Davis * Indiana University * University of Kentucky * Emory University * University of Michigan The American Board of Thoracic Surgery offers a special pathway certificate in congenital heart surgery which typically requires an additional year of fellowship. This formal certificate is unique because pediatric cardiac surgeons in other countries do not have formal evaluation and recognition of pediatric training by a licensing body. Cardiac surgery The earliest operations on the pericardium (the sac that surrounds the heart) took place in the 19th century and were performed by Francisco Romero (1801) Dominique Jean Larrey, Henry Dalton, and Daniel Hale Williams. Pioneers in Academic Surgery, U.S. National Library of Medicine The first surgery on the heart itself was performed by Norwegian surgeon Axel Cappelen on 4 September 1895 at Rikshospitalet in Kristiania, now Oslo. He ligated a bleeding coronary artery in a 24-year-old man who had been stabbed in the left axilla and was in deep shock upon arrival. Access was through a left thoracotomy. The patient awoke and seemed fine for 24 hours, but became ill with increasing temperature and he ultimately died from what the post mortem proved to be mediastinitis on the third postoperative day.Landmarks in Cardiac Surgery by Stephen Westaby, Cecil Bosher, The first successful surgery of the heart, performed without any complications, was by Ludwig Rehn of Frankfurt, Germany, who repaired a stab wound to the right ventricle on September 7, 1896.Absolon KB, Naficy MA (2002). First successful cardiac operation in a human, 1896: a documentation: the life, the times, and the work of Ludwig Rehn (1849-1930). Rockville, MD : Kabel, 2002Johnson SL (1970). History of Cardiac Surgery, 1896-1955. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins Press. p. 5. Surgery in great vessels (aortic coarctation repair, Blalock-Taussig shunt creation, closure of patent ductus arteriosus) became common after the turn of the century and falls in the domain of cardiac surgery, but technically cannot be considered heart surgery. One of the more commonly known cardiac surgery procedures is the coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), also known as \\"bypass surgery.\\" In this procedure, vessels from elsewhere in the patient's body are harvested, and grafted to the coronary arteries to bypass blockages and improve the blood supply to the heart muscle. =Early approaches to heart malformations= In 1925 operations on the heart valves were unknown. Henry Souttar operated successfully on a young woman with mitral stenosis. He made an opening in the appendage of the left atrium and inserted a finger into this chamber in order to palpate and explore the damaged mitral valve. The patient survived for several yearsDictionary of National Biography ‚Äì Henry Souttar (2004‚Äì08) but Souttar's physician colleagues at that time decided the procedure was not justified and he could not continue.Lawrence H Cohn (2007), Cardiac Surgery in the Adult, page 6+ Cardiac surgery changed significantly after World War II. In 1948 four surgeons carried out successful operations for mitral stenosis resulting from rheumatic fever. Horace Smithy (1914‚Äì1948) of Charlotte, revived an operation due to Dr Dwight Harken of the Peter Bent Brigham Hospital using a punch to remove a portion of the mitral valve. Charles Bailey (1910‚Äì1993) at the Hahnemann Hospital, Philadelphia, Dwight Harken in Boston and Russell Brock at Guy's Hospital all adopted Souttar's method. All these men started work independently of each other, within a few months. This time Souttar's technique was widely adopted although there were modifications. In 1947 Thomas Holmes Sellors (1902‚Äì1987) of the Middlesex Hospital operated on a Fallot's Tetralogy patient with pulmonary stenosis and successfully divided the stenosed pulmonary valve. In 1948, Russell Brock, probably unaware of Sellor's work, used a specially designed dilator in three cases of pulmonary stenosis. Later in 1948 he designed a punch to resect the infundibular muscle stenosis which is often associated with Fallot's Tetralogy. Many thousands of these \\"blind\\" operations were performed until the introduction of heart bypass made direct surgery on valves possible.Harold Ellis (2000) A History of Surgery, page 223+ =Open heart surgery= Open heart surgery is a procedure in which the patient's heart is opened and surgery is performed on the internal structures of the heart. It was discovered by Wilfred G. Bigelow of the University of Toronto that the repair of intracardiac pathologies was better done with a bloodless and motionless environment, which means that the heart should be stopped and drained of blood. The first successful intracardiac correction of a congenital heart defect using hypothermia was performed by C. Walton Lillehei and F. John Lewis at the University of Minnesota on September 2, 1952. The following year, Soviet surgeon Aleksandr Aleksandrovich Vishnevskiy conducted the first cardiac surgery under local anesthesia. Surgeons realized the limitations of hypothermia ‚Äì complex intracardiac repairs take more time and the patient needs blood flow to the body, particularly to the brain. The patient needs the function of the heart and lungs provided by an artificial method, hence the term cardiopulmonary bypass. John Heysham Gibbon at Jefferson Medical School in Philadelphia reported in 1953 the first successful use of extracorporeal circulation by means of an oxygenator, but he abandoned the method, disappointed by subsequent failures. In 1954 Lillehei realized a successful series of operations with the controlled cross-circulation technique in which the patient's mother or father was used as a 'heart-lung machine'. John W. Kirklin at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota started using a Gibbon type pump-oxygenator in a series of successful operations, and was soon followed by surgeons in various parts of the world. Nazih Zuhdi performed the first total intentional hemodilution open heart surgery on Terry Gene Nix, age 7, on February 25, 1960, at Mercy Hospital, Oklahoma City, OK. The operation was a success; however, Nix died three years later in 1963.Warren, Cliff, Dr. Nazih Zuhdi ‚Äì His Scientific Work Made All Paths Lead to Oklahoma City, in Distinctly Oklahoma, November, 2007, p. 30-33 In March, 1961, Zuhdi, Carey, and Greer, performed open heart surgery on a child, age , using the total intentional hemodilution machine. In 1985 Zuhdi performed Oklahoma's first successful heart transplant on Nancy Rogers at Baptist Hospital. The transplant was successful, but Rogers, a cancer sufferer, died from an infection 54 days after surgery. Dr. Nazih Zuhdi, the Legendary Heart Surgeon, The Oklahoman, Jan 2010 =Modern beating-heart surgery= Since the 1990s, surgeons have begun to perform \\"off-pump bypass surgery\\" ‚Äì coronary artery bypass surgery without the aforementioned cardiopulmonary bypass. In these operations, the heart is beating during surgery, but is stabilized to provide an almost still work area in which to connect the conduit vessel that bypasses the blockage; in the U.S., most conduit vessels are harvested endoscopically, using a technique known as endoscopic vessel harvesting (EVH). Some researchers believe that the off-pump approach results in fewer post-operative complications, such as postperfusion syndrome, and better overall results. Study results are controversial as of 2007, the surgeon's preference and hospital results still play a major role. =Minimally invasive surgery= A new form of heart surgery that has grown in popularity is robot-assisted heart surgery. This is where a machine is used to perform surgery while being controlled by the heart surgeon. The main advantage to this is the size of the incision made in the patient. Instead of an incision being at least big enough for the surgeon to put his hands inside, it does not have to be bigger than 3 small holes for the robot's much smaller \\"hands\\" to get through. =Pediatric cardiovascular surgery= Pediatric cardiovascular surgery is surgery of the heart of children. The first operations to repair cardio-vascularWikipedia: Coarctation of the Aorta. Coarctation is not cardiac (i.e., heart) but is a narrowing of the aorta, a great vessel near the heart defects in children were performed by Clarence Crafoord in Sweden when he repaired coarctation of the aorta in a 12-year-old boy. The first attempts to palliate congenital heart disease were performed by Alfred Blalock with the assistance of William Longmire, Denton Cooley, and Blalock's experienced technician, Vivien Thomas in 1944 at Johns Hopkins Hospital. Techniques for repair of congenital heart defects without the use of a bypass machine were developed in the late 1940s and early 1950s. Among them was an open repair of an atrial septal defect using hypothermia, inflow occlusion and direct vision in a 5-year old child performed in 1952 by Lewis and Tauffe. C. Walter Lillihei used cross-circulation between a boy and his father to maintain perfusion while performing a direct repair of a ventricular septal defect in a 4 year old child in 1954. He continued to use cross- circulation and performed the first corrections of tetratology of Fallot and presented those results in 1955 at the American Surgical Association. In the long-run, pediatric cardiovascular surgery would rely on the cardiopulmonary bypass machine developed by Gibbon and Lillehei as noted above. =Risks of cardiac surgery= The development of cardiac surgery and cardiopulmonary bypass techniques has reduced the mortality rates of these surgeries to relatively low ranks. For instance, repairs of congenital heart defects are currently estimated to have 4‚Äì6% mortality rates. A major concern with cardiac surgery is the incidence of neurological damage. Stroke occurs in 5% of all people undergoing cardiac surgery, and is higher in patients at risk for stroke. A more subtle constellation of neurocognitive deficits attributed to cardiopulmonary bypass is known as postperfusion syndrome, sometimes called \\"pumphead\\". The symptoms of postperfusion syndrome were initially felt to be permanent, but were shown to be transient with no permanent neurological impairment. In order to assess the performance of surgical units and individual surgeons, a popular risk model has been created called the EuroSCORE. This takes a number of health factors from a patient and using precalculated logistic regression coefficients attempts to give a percentage chance of survival to discharge. Within the UK this EuroSCORE was used to give a breakdown of all the centres for cardiothoracic surgery and to give some indication of whether the units and their individuals surgeons performed within an acceptable range. The results are available on the CQC website. CQC website for heart surgery outcomes in the UK for 3 years ending March 2009 The precise methodology used has however not been published to date nor has the raw data on which the results are based. Infection represents the primary non- cardiac complication from cardiothoracic surgery. Infections can include mediastinitis, infectious myo- or pericarditis, endocarditis, cardiac device infection, pneumonia, empyema, and bloodstream infections. Clostridum difficile colitis can also develop when prophylactic or post-operative antibiotics are used.  Thoracic surgery  A pleurectomy is a surgical procedure in which part of the pleura is removed. It is sometimes used in the treatment of pneumothorax and mesothelioma. =Lung volume reduction surgery= Lung volume reduction surgery, or LVRS, can improve the quality of life for certain COPD and emphysema patients. Parts of the lung that are particularly damaged by emphysema are removed, allowing the remaining, relatively good lung to expand and work more efficiently. The beneficial effects are correlated with the achieved reduction in residual volume. Conventional LVRS involves resection of the most severely affected areas of emphysematous, non-bullous lung (aim is for 20-30%). This is a surgical option involving a mini-thoracotomy for patients suffering end stage COPD due to underlying emphysema, and can improve lung elastic recoil as well as diaphragmatic function. The National Emphysema Treatment Trial was a large multicentre study (N = 1218) comparing LVRS with non-surgical treatment. Results suggested that there was no overall survival advantage in the LVRS group, except for mainly upper-lobe emphysema + poor exercise capacity, and significant improvements were seen in exercise capacity in the LVRS group. Possible complications of LVRS include prolonged air leak (mean duration post surgery until all chest tubes removed is 10.9 ¬± 8.0 days. In people who have a predominantly upper lobe emphysema, lung volume reduction surgery could result in better health status and lung function, though it also increases the risk of early mortality and adverse events. LVRS is used widely in Europe, though its application in the United States is mostly experimental. A less invasive treatment is available as a bronchoscopic lung volume reduction. = Lung cancer surgery = Not all lung cancers are suitable for surgery. The stage, location and cell type are important limiting factors. In addition, people who are very ill with a poor performance status or who have inadequate pulmonary reserve would be unlikely to survive. Even with careful selection, the overall operative death rate is about 4.4%. In non-small cell lung cancer staging, stages IA, IB, IIA, and IIB are suitable for surgical resection. Pulmonary reserve is measured by spirometry. If there is no evidence of undue shortness of breath or diffuse parenchymal lung disease, and the FEV1 exceeds 2 litres or 80% of predicted, the person is fit for pneumonectomy. If the FEV1 exceeds 1.5 litres, the patient is fit for lobectomy. There is weak evidence to indicate that participation in exercise programs before lung cancer surgery may reduce the risk of complications after surgery.  Complications  A prolonged air leak (PAL) can occur in 8-25% of people following lung cancer surgery. This complication delays chest tube removal and is associated with an increased length of hospital stay following a lung resection (lung cancer surgery). The use of surgical sealants may reduce the incidence of prolonged air leaks, however, this intervention alone has not been shown to results in a decreased length of hospital stay following lung cancer surgery. There is no strong evidence to support using non-invasive positive pressure ventilation following lung cancer surgery to reduce pulmonary complications.

Considered the patron saint of speedy cases, he is commemorated by the Catholic Church on 19 April.  Hagiography  Expeditus was probably born in Armenia. He was a Christian martyr, but not much else is known about him.Monks of Ramsgate. ‚ÄúHermogenes, Caius, Expeditus, Aristonicus, Rufus and Galatas‚Äù. Book of Saints, 1921.

If he was stationed at Melitene at the beginning of the fourth century, he would likely have been a member of the Legio XII FulminataM‚ÄôElderry, R. Knox. \\"The Legions of the Euphrates Frontier,\\" Classical Quarterly 3 (1909): 44‚Äì53 The earliest indication of devotion to St. Expeditus comes only from the second half of the eighteenth century. He was mentioned briefly in 1675 in the Acta sanctorum volume for April. However, according to Delehaye, the word \\"Expeditus\\" is a misreading of \\"Elpidius\\". The name \\"Expeditus\\" has provoked puns, so he has become the saint of rapidity. At first, he was invoked for urgent causes; he has since become the patron of dealers, sailors, students, and examinees; he is also implored for success in lawsuits. Given that \\"Expeditus\\" is Latin for a soldier without marching pack, i.e. a soldier with light equipment, this saint may be an anonymous individual known by his profession. His cult was already developed in Turin, Italy, in the Middle Ages.  Roman Catholic veneration  = Legends = According to tradition, Expeditus was a Roman centurion in Armenia who became a Christian and was beheaded during the Diocletian Persecution in AD 303\\\\. The day he decided to become a Christian, the Devil took the form of a crow (a snake in some versions of the legend) and told him to defer his conversion until the next day. Expeditus stamped on the bird and killed it, declaring, \\"I'll be a Christian today!\\" Expeditus was included in martyrologies in Italy before 1781. There was a tradition that Expeditus could be called upon to help settle overly long legal cases. His feast of April 19 is widely celebrated. Expedite is venerated in Europe and strongly in Latin America. Brazil has ceremonies in S√£o Paulo and crowds attending ceremonies to mark his April 19 feast day can reach in the hundreds of thousands. Many stories circulated about the origin of the cultus of Expeditus. One states that it began when a package marked expedite (meaning 'be ready' or alternately 'loosen') arrived with unidentified relics or statues. The recipients assumed that the statuary or relics belonged to an Expeditus, and so veneration began. Such an account is set in France in 1781. A case containing the relics of a saint, who was formerly buried in the Denfert-Rochereau catacombs of Paris, was delivered at a convent in the city. The senders had written exp√©dit on the case, to ensure fast delivery of the remains. The nuns assumed that \\"Exp√©dit\\" was the name of a martyr, and prayed for his intercession. When their prayers were answered, veneration spread rapidly through France and on to other Roman Catholic countries.\\"Saint Expeditus\\", La Reunion Another version of the story takes place in New Orleans, Louisiana, which was strongly influenced by French Catholic culture through the colonial period. This account says that Our Lady of Guadalupe Chapel (New Orleans) received a large shipment of statues of various saints, and that one case lacked an identifying label. It was labeled \\"Expedite\\" (Exp√©dit in French), so the residents assumed that must be the saint's name. Exp√©dit still figures prominently in Louisiana Creole folklore and is revered through amulets, flowers, candles, and intercessory prayers. = Iconographical depiction = Expeditus' typical depiction in artwork is as a young Roman centurion. The soldier is squashing a crow beneath his right foot and bearing a clock in early images. Later depictions have Expeditus holding a cross, inscribed with the Latin word hodie (\\"today\\"). A banderole with the word cras (\\"tomorrow\\" in Latin) emerges from the crow's mouth. Although in the English language a crow's cry is rendered as \\"caw caw,\\" in Italian the sound is \\"cra cra.\\", and Latin version was \\"cras cras\\".  R√©union Island  Roadside altars dedicated to Exp√©dit are common in R√©union and always painted red. Exp√©dit has a significant folk following on the French island of R√©union off the east coast of Africa in the Indian Ocean. Stories about the origin of his veneration follow the typical formula: a mysterious parcel marked with expedit arrived as an aid to instill pious virtues in the people. Another version says that Exp√©dit acquired his name through his help in placing vengeful curses. Decapitated statues of the saint are often found, the defacement inflicted in anger for a request not carried out, or in order to break an existing curse. Road-side altars dedicated to Exp√©dit can be as small as a box containing a small statue of the saint, or as large as a hut, containing multiple statues, candles, and flowers. In all cases, these altars are painted a bright red. Also common are ex-votos thanking Exp√©dit for wishes granted and favors received. In R√©union, the cult of Saint Exp√©dit has been syncretic, with Roman Catholicism absorbing other beliefs from Madagascar or India. Exp√©dit is a popular saint, revered by Reunionnais regardless of age or religion. As the worship of Exp√©dit is officially considered taboo, people do not generally visit the altars in the open. But, the altars are widespread on the island and obviously well-tended, showing that the cult is active.  Churches in the world  There are churches dedicated to Expeditus all over the world:  Chile  Himnos mil al glorioso Expedito, que su sangre en la Armenia verti√≥, cuyo nombre en el cielo fue escrito, y de m√°rtir el laurel alcanz√≥. ‚ÄîHimno a San Expedito A thousand hymns to glorious Expeditus, Who shed his blood in Armenia, Whose name was written in heaven, And gained the laurel of martyrdom. ‚ÄîHymn to Saint Expeditus Veneration in Chile is said to have begun when a devotee of Expeditus (or locally in Spanish, San Expedito) brought an image of him to Vi√±a del Mar, one of the most popular beach cities of Chile. She petitioned some local priests for help to have a small church built for him. It is said that local authorities initially rejected the idea, but the priests and the devout lady prayed to Expeditus, and in less than nine days they had the approval. Since then, the cult of San Expedito has become increasingly popular in Chile; from rich to poor, people pray novenas to him. The shrine in the Re√±aca sector of Vi√±a is a rather popular pilgrimage site, especially during summer.

Description  The common name of the rough-snouted giant gecko refers to the enlarged scales that cover its snout. Other characteristics of this gecko include broad toes and a prehensile tail. the rough-snouted giant gecko has a mottled color pattern, generally a grayish-green to brown mixed with white. Its body length (BDL) is usually around , making it a large gecko species, with its tail being roughly the same length.  Behavior and habitat  The rough-snouted giant gecko is a nocturnal species, hunting in the nighttime and taking shelter in the daytime. It lives in forests, mostly in tropical and subtropical climates but also in forests with evergreen trees. It exhibits ovoviviparity, causing it to have a lower reproductive rate than other species in its genus. Like all Rhacodactylus geckos, the rough-snouted giant gecko is an omnivore. Its diet consists mainly of insects and fruit, and can include as well small lizards and nestling birds and rodents.  Distribution  The rough-snouted giant gecko lives only in several small areas in New Caledonia. Sparse populations are known from Province Sud and Province Nord, specifically in Ile des Pins and small parts of Grand Terre, the main island of New Caledonia. Its occupies a total of 149 km2 of land up to above sea level. Although the exact population trend of the rough-snouted giant gecko is unknown, both its range and population size are declining for a number of reasons. Habitat loss is one of its major threats, specifically due to wildfires, larger animals such as pigs destroying its habitat, and humans clearing its forests in favor of farmland. In addition, rodents and cats were introduced to the area, which prey on the gecko; fire ants (i.e. Wasmannia auropunctata) are a danger as well. The species has also been collected and traded illegally in some areas, sometimes being used as a pet. Although some of the areas it lives in are protected, no conservation actions are taking place for the species. The decline of its population and its small distribution cause it to be listed as endangered on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species and has been assessed as vulnerable by Endemia.  Breeding  The rough-snouted giant gecko is the only Rhacodactylus gecko that gives live birth. It is sometimes seen in captivity and as an arboreal species, requires a vertically oriented terrarium. Males should be housed separately or as a part of a breeding pair or trio with females. Although males housed together will often fight, females are social and can be housed together.  Taxonomy  The description of the species was published by Jos√© Vicente Barbosa du Bocage in 1873.Bocage, J. V. Barboza du. 1873. M√©langes erp√©tologiques. l.

General Hackett's scenario takes place in 1985; Coyle never specifies the year, but it is assumed to take place in the late 1980s. While Hackett's book emphasizes strategy and world politics, Coyles features the experiences of the tank crews and infantrymen fighting on the front lines. The novel achieved best-selling status and became a series of comic books, an Origins Award-winning board wargame and later a video game. In 2015, it was adapted as a sister scenario for the Flames of War wargame. Plot summary The novel is set in West Germany and East Germany in the months of August and September; the year is unspecified. Team Yankee (\\"Y\\" in the ICAO and NATO phonetic alphabet) is an armor-heavy company-sized unit (a \\"Team\\" in Army parlance). There is nothing special about this team; it is an average company- sized U.S. unit in an average battalion of the Regular Army. Team Yankee is composed of First Platoon (Lieutenant Murray Weiss), Second Platoon (Second Lieutenant McAllister), Mech(anized Infantry) Platoon (Staff Sergeant Polgar), and Third Platoon (Second Lieutenant Gerry Garger). Captain Sean Bannon is company commander; First Lieutenant Robert Uleski is the executive officer; and company first sergeant is First Sergeant Raymond Harrert. Captain Bannon is 27 years old, married and has three children. He studied military history, with a graduate degree, but is seen as an average officer; Coyle notes in the preface that Bannon will probably never rise in rank above lieutenant colonel. The team has 10 M1 Abrams tanks, 5 M113 armored personnel carriers, and 2 M901 ITV TOW missile vehicles. The infantry is armed with Dragon antitank missiles and 66-millimeter LAWs. The Team also has a M113 AMEV (Armored Medical Evacuation Vehicle) and an M88 recovery vehicle. There are four M1s in each tank platoon, numbered 11, 12, 13, 14, 21... to 34. The XO's tank is numbered 55; the CO's tank 66. The parent unit of Team Yankee is the First Battalion, 4th Armor. Currently it is part of Task Force 3-78 Mechanized Infantry, commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Reynolds. TF 3-78 is formed from the First Battalion, 78th Infantry. The brigade commander is Colonel Brunn. The task force is composed of Team Yankee, C Company (Captain Craven) a standard infantry company, D Company, and another armor-heavy Team Bravo. In addition, there is an artillery support team (a FIST) (Second Lieutenant Rodney Unger) attached. =Prologue= The prologue begins with a series of quotations from international news sources listing the deteriorating international situation between the United States and the Soviet Union, particularly in the Persian Gulf, from July 15 to August 1, when NATO forces are mobilized and moved to the inter-German frontier. =Chapter 1: Stand-To= (August 3, early morning) The novel begins with Team Yankee deployed forward towards the frontier with the German Democratic Republic. Captain Bannon is awakened by a radio check from his Third Platoon Leader, Lieutenant Garger‚Äîthe third straight day Garger has used his radio to break radio silence. Unable to go back to sleep, Bannon inspects his unit and meets the other principal characters of the novel. He finds Garger, berates him, and decides that with a war coming on, Garger would need to be replaced as a liability. Meanwhile, at the Army base, Pat Bannon, Sean's wife, understands that the possibility of war is high, and prepares to evacuate her small children while exercising the informal leadership over the other Army wives of Team Yankee. =Chapter 2: First Battle= (August 3, 0730 hours) Colonel Reynolds inspects the forward positions of his task force, including Team Yankee, when the war starts. The Soviets push through the armored cavalry screen and attack the team, in dug in positions under cover. Team Bravo's company commander is killed in combat. Team Yankee repels the Soviet attack. To Captain Bannon's pleasant surprise, his problem lieutenant is proving to be quite competent in combat. At the base, Pat serves as the informal head of Team Yankee's dependents. She makes a trip into the nearest town to make sure Sue Garger, Gerry's wife, is recovered. The roads are choked with military and refugee traffic. =Chapter 3: Change of Mission= (August 3, late afternoon/evening) Pat Bannon, her children, and all the other dependents make it to Rhein-Main Air Base, where they await evacuation. As soon as an aircraft lands and offloads U.S. reinforcements, dependents are loaded on the plane. A Soviet air strike occurs while the dependents wait; Pat and her children must run past dead civilians to make the flight. Meanwhile, the task force and the Team recover from the first firefight. Bannon finds that the attitude of those who have actually seen combat differs from the staff, who are more enthusiastic about the war. =Chapter 4: Into the Vacuum= (August 4, morning) Team Yankee is ordered to attack Hill 214 with C Company in support. There is confusion in orders; Major Jordan, the battalion S-3, orders the attack be halted, while Colonel Reynolds, the battalion commander, orders Bannon to attack. 2LT McAllister, in Tank 21, is killed during the attack. =Chapter 5: Hunter and Hunted= (August 4, daytime) In the fighting, Bannon's tank, 66, is crippled and his driver is killed. The surviving three crewmen in 66 defeat three T-62 tanks, which did not suspect 66 was still in action; the crew destroys 66 to prevent its capture. Bannon rejoins the Team and takes over Lt. Uleski's tank 55. C Company never arrives and the Team is forced to fight to hold Hill 214 on its own. =Chapter 6: On The Razor's Edge= (August 4/5) Team Yankee holds off an attack by a Soviet battalion on Hill 214 during the night. Bannon's loader, PFC Richard Kelp, and Private McCauley volunteer to lead a Dragon gunner to engage the enemy on foot. The Dragon gunner is killed and Kelp and McCauley race against time to destroy a T-72 before it destroys them. Kelp is later awarded a Silver Star for his efforts. =Chapter 7: Check and Checkmate= (August 5, 0530 hours) The Team was scheduled to withdraw at 0330 to U.S. lines, but every man in the company, fatigued from the fighting, falls asleep. Bannon wakes up two hours later, wakes up his tank crew and platoon leaders to the universal chorus of \\"Oh, shit!\\" Bannon works out a way that the Team can withdraw in daylight with minimal casualties. =Chapter 8: R and R= The Team reaches the nearest town, where, to his fury, Bannon finds soldiers from C Company lounging around. Bannon reports to the task force commander; the Team is placed in reserve, where it can recover and receive reinforcements. 2nd Lt. Avery, an Armor School classmate of 2nd Lt Garger's, reports as Lt McAllister's replacement. Avery is puzzled by the slightly distant reception he gets from the Team's officers, including Garger. =Chapter 9: Deep Attack= (August 8 to 11) Lt. Avery, who has yet to enter combat, finds himself isolated from the other members of the Team. He finds himself even more isolated when the Team starts to paint kill rings on the barrels of each tank. The brigade to which Team Yankee belongs is ordered to follow up a West German counterattack into East Germany though the Thuringer Wald towards Leipzig and Berlin to cut off the Soviet offensive against the Northern Army Group. Because of the Team's combat experience, Bannon is ordered to lead the attack. Bannon expresses doubts to Colonel Reynolds that the rest of the battalion, in particular C Company, can carry out their role in supporting the armor teams; he is promised that there will be no more \\"rat-fucks\\". The attack is delayed because the enemy, a Polish T-55 tank battalion, launches its attack first, which gives the Team a chance to fight from defensive cover. The Poles fall back and the Task Force pursues. Avery gets his first kill. =Chapter 10: Red Dawn= (August 11, morning) The Task Force attack stops to consolidate its gains; the Polish unit that was scattered by Team Yankee reforms and attacks C Company. The Task Force, assisted by a German company, moves to support Captain Cravin's company. In the fight, the battalion XO is hit and taken out of action. D Company, Team Bravo, and the German unit, assisted by U.S. artillery, crush the Polish battalion. The Task Force halts to reorganize. Bannon sends the Mech Platoon to secure the nearest town. An East German teenager, apparently a member of the Free German Youth, wounds one of Polgar's infantrymen with an AK-47 rifle and is killed immediately. =Chapter 11: Counterattack= Lt. Avery, in Tank 21, is wounded in an air attack by a Soviet helicopter. First Sergeant Harrert and the maintenance crew salvage the tank, grimly noting it would be back in combat in 24 hours. The task force headquarters is attacked, severely wounding Colonel Reynolds and cutting off the XO, Major Jordan, from communicating with the Task Force; Bannon finds himself in command of the Task Force and leads three companies to defeat the Soviet counterattack and rescue the Task Force staff. =Chapter 12: \\"They Came in the Same Old Way\\"= The surviving Task Force staff, led by Major Jordan, resume command. C Company is effectively wiped out and its survivors are integrated with D Company. The Task Force plans to ambush a Soviet battalion heading westward into their position, centered on an East German town. Jordan plans a reverse slope defense, not attacking the Soviets at the logical choke point. The Soviet attackers, harassed by the Task Force scout platoon and U.S. artillery-delivered mines, fail to take the town or the hills to the north of the valley. The Soviet commander moves south, into Bannon's Team's guns. When asked to give his after-action report, Bannon flippantly quotes the Duke of Wellington, \\"They came, you know, in the same old way and we beat them in the same old way.\\" =Chapter 13: To the Saale= NATO as a whole, and the U.S. in particular, are running short of equipment and manpower. Units that are no longer capable of going on the offensive, or are not holding key terrain, are stripped of their most effective units. Team Yankee is thus moved from Task Force 3-78 to Task Force 1-4 Armored, which is their parent battalion, to continue the attack into Leipzig and Berlin. The Team is assigned a screening role to the main effort, and is ordered to feint as if they intend to capture a bridge over the Saale River. However, due to speed of their attack and a divided command between the Soviet Army and the KGB, Lt. Weiss' platoon is able to capture the bridge intact. =Chapter 14: The Day After= The next day, Bannon finds out that the Soviets have launched a nuclear attack on the city of Birmingham, England; NATO retaliates by destroying the city of Minsk, Belarus. The Task Force is ordered to prepare for nuclear warfare (by dispersion, deeper cover, and protection against the effects of a blast on electronics and optics). Bannon immediately orders a tightening on hygiene and equipment maintenance to lessen the long-term effects of nuclear war. Bannon prepares for the next attack when the news comes that a cease-fire was declared and the war is over. =Epilogue= The cease-fire holds. Life slowly resumes a routine closer to peacetime. A National Guard division relieves Bannon's division, and Bannon returns to his quarters only two months after he left, to reconnect with his family life. Major themes The novel has as a theme the actions of a company-sized armor unit of the United States Army in the World War III scenario as depicted by General Sir John Hackett in his novel, The Third World War. It also deals with, to a lesser degree, the reactions of men facing combat for the first time, and how they react after seeing combat. The novel also refers to \\"Company Commander\\", the WW2 infantry service memoir by Charles B. Macdonald... a recollection of Macdonald's service as an infantry officer. Non-fiction books describing similar experiences to those of the fictional Team Yankee are \\"Brazen Chariots\\" by Robert Crisp, which describes his service in the North African armored campaigns in the Second World War, and \\"Heights of Courage\\" by Avigdor Kahalani, an account of his experiences in the 1973 Yom Kippur War. Significance Team Yankee was Coyle's first novel, and its success made Coyle a prominent writer in the field of military fiction.

Comedian Will Ferrell played Bush and when asked by a mock debate moderator to \\"sum up, in a single word, the best argument for his candidacy\\", replied \\"strategery\\" (a mock-Bushism playing on the word \\"strategy\\"), thus satirizing Bush's reputation for mispronouncing words. The episode was later released as part of a video tape titled Presidential Bash 2000. Becoming a Bush catchphrase After the 2000 presidential election, people inside the Bush White House reportedly began using the term as a joke, and it later grew to become a term of art among them meaning oversight of any activity by Bush's political consultants. Bush's strategists also came to be known within the White House as \\"The Department of Strategery\\", or the \\"Strategery Group\\". A February 9, 2001 transcript of a CNN interview shows Bush using the term, presumably as an intentional nod to the comedy sketch. Affectionately embracing satirical portrayals has been a Bush tactic at other times as well, such as when he presented a self-parodying slide show at the May 2004 Radio and Television Correspondents Dinner about looking for weapons of mass destruction in the Oval Office after the political comic strip Doonesbury satirically portrayed him on a similar comical search. The term is now widely used in comic and popular discourse across the political spectrum. Rush Limbaugh picked up the usage soon after the SNL airing. A trial exhibit from the 2007 \\"Scooter\\" Libby trial included the term, in Libby's daily schedule for June 10, 2003, which showed that Libby had a 6:00 pm \\"Strategery Meeting\\" scheduled to last 90 minutes.Defense Exhibit DX1030 - Scooter Libby's Schedule, June 10, 2003 In a 2017 interview on Jimmy Kimmel Live!, Bush recalled a joke argument with SNL's Lorne Michaels about whether an SNL writer or Bush himself had actually coined the term. Other uses Sarah Palin used the term in an interview with Bill O'Reilly on his television show. Speaking of Charles Krauthammer and his political contacts, Palin commented \\"they're meeting people and they're doing their strategery\\". The term is also a centerpiece of the fictitious firm Strategery Capital Management, LLC, a satirical website, which mocks the Treasury's $700 billion \\"Troubled Asset Rescue Plan\\" (which itself is a spoof of the real-world Troubled Asset Relief Program, which Bush signed into law in 2008). A White House reporter, during a September 29, 2009, press briefing, began a question for press secretary Robert Gibbs with \\"From the standpoint of leverage or strategery...\\" The question, about Iran, drew laughs and a quip from Gibbs. Shepard Smith, on his evening news program The FOX Report with Shepard Smith on July 10, 2012, described London official's quoted \\"overall strategery\\" in placing anti-aircraft missiles on apartment buildings during the London Olympics.

These bacteria can be further categorized as obligate alkaliphiles (those that require high pH to survive), facultative alkaliphiles (those able to survive in high pH, but also grow under normal conditions) and haloalkaliphiles (those that require high salt content to survive).HORIKOSHI, KOKI. \\"Alkaliphiles: Some Applications of Their Products for Biotechnology.\\" MICROBIOLOGY AND MOLECULAR BIOLOGY REVIEWS 63.4 (1999): 735-50. Print. A typical bacillus culture. Many alkaliphiles possess a bacillus morphology. Background information Microbial growth in alkaline conditions presents several complications to normal biochemical activity and reproduction, as high pH is detrimental to normal cellular processes. For example, alkalinity can lead to denaturation of DNA, instability of the plasma membrane and inactivation of cytosolic enzymes, as well as other unfavorable physiological changes.Higashibata, Akira, Taketomo Fujiwara, and Yoshihiro Fukumori. \\"Studies on the Respiratory System in Alkaliphilic Bacillus; a Proposed New Respiratory System.\\" Extremophiles 2 (1998): 83‚Äì92. Print. Thus, to adequately circumvent these obstacles, alkaliphiles must either possess specific cellular machinery that works best in the alkaline range, or they must have methods of acidifying the cytosol in relation to the extracellular environment. To determine which of the above possibilities an alkaliphile uses, experimentation has demonstrated that alkaliphilic enzymes possess relatively normal pH optimums. The determination that these enzymes function most efficiently near physiologically neutral pH ranges (about 7.5‚Äì8.5) was one of the primary steps in elucidating how alkaliphiles survive intensely basic environments. Since the cytosolic pH must remain nearly neutral, alkaliphiles must have one or more mechanisms of acidifying the cytosol when in the presence of a highly alkaline environment. Mechanisms of cytosolic acidification Alkaliphiles maintain cytosolic acidification through both passive and active means. In passive acidification, it has been proposed that cell walls contain acidic polymers composed of residues such as galacturonic acid, gluconic acid, glutamic acid, aspartic acid, and phosphoric acid. Together, these residues form an acidic matrix that helps protect the plasma membrane from alkaline conditions by preventing the entry of hydroxide ions, and allowing for the uptake of sodium and hydronium ions. In addition, the peptidoglycan in alkaliphilic B. subtilis has been observed to contain higher levels of hexosamines and amino acids as compared to its neutrophilic counterpart. When alkaliphiles lose these acidic residues in the form of induced mutations, it has been shown that their ability to grow in alkaline conditions is severely hindered. However, it is generally agreed upon that passive methods of cytosolic acidification are not sufficient to maintain an internal pH 2-2.3 levels below that of external pH; there must also be active forms of acidification. The most characterized method of active acidification is in the form of Na+/H+ antiporters. In this model, H+ ions are first extruded through the electron transport chain in respiring cells and to some extent through an ATPase in fermentative cells. This proton extrusion establishes a proton gradient that drives electrogenic antiporters‚Äîwhich drive intracellular Na+ out of the cell in exchange for a greater number of H+ ions, leading to the net accumulation of internal protons. This proton accumulation leads to a lowering of cytosolic pH. The extruded Na+ can be used for solute symport, which are necessary for cellular processes. It has been noted that Na+/H+ antiport is required for alkaliphilic growth, whereas either K+/H+ antiporters or Na+/H+ antiporters can be utilized by neutrophilic bacteria. If Na+/H+ antiporters are disabled through mutation or another means, the bacteria are rendered neutrophilic.Krulwich, Terry A., Mashahiro Ito, Ray Gilmour, and Arthur A. Guffanti. \\"Mechanisms of Cytoplasmic PH Regulation in Alkaliphilic Strains of Bacillus.\\" Extremophiles 1 (1997): 163-69. Print. The sodium required for this antiport system is the reason some alkaliphiles can only grow in saline environments. Differences in alkaliphilic ATP production In addition to the method of proton extrusion discussed above, it is believed that the general method of cellular respiration is different in obligate alkaliphiles as compared to neutrophiles. Generally, ATP production operates by establishing a proton gradient (greater H+ concentration outside the membrane) and a transmembrane electrical potential (with a positive charge outside the membrane). However, since alkaliphiles have a reversed pH gradient, it would seem that ATP production‚Äîwhich is based on a strong proton motive force‚Äîwould be severely reduced. However, the opposite is true. It has been proposed that while the pH gradient has been reversed, the transmembrane electrical potential is greatly increased. This increase in charge causes the production of greater amounts of ATP by each translocated proton when driven through an ATPase.Hirabayashi, Toshikazu, Toshitaka Goto, Hajime Morimoto, Kazuaki Yoshimune, Hidetoshi Matsuyama, and Isao Yumoto. \\"Relationship between Rates of Respiratory Proton Extrusion and ATP Synthesis in Obligately Alkaliphilic Bacillus Clarkii DSM 8720T.\\" J Bioenerg Biomembr 44 (2012): 265-72. Print. Research in this area is ongoing. Applications and future research Alkaliphiles promise several interesting uses for biotechnology and future research. Alkaliphilic methods of regulating pH and producing ATP are of interest in the scientific community. However, perhaps the greatest area of interest from alkaliphiles lies in their enzymes: alkaline proteases; starch- degrading enzymes; cellulases; lipases; xylanases; pectinases; chitinases and their metabolites, including: 2-phenylamine; carotenoids; siderophores; cholic acid derivatives and organic acids. It is hoped that further research into alkaliphilic enzymes will allow scientists to harvest alkaliphiles' enzymes for use in basic conditions. Research aimed at discovering alkaliphile- produced antibiotics showed some success, yet has been held at bay by the fact that some products produced at high pH are unstable and unusable at a physiological pH range. Examples Examples of alkaliphiles include Halorhodospira halochloris, Natronomonas pharaonis, and Thiohalospira alkaliphila.

It was an ally of the United States, but there were several foreign policy differences between the two countries over the course of the Cold War. Canada was a founding member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) in 1949, the North American Aerospace Defence Command (NORAD) in 1958 and played a leading role in United Nations peacekeeping operations ‚Äì from the Korean War to the creation of a permanent UN peacekeeping force during the Suez Crisis in 1956. Subsequent peacekeeping interventions occurred in the Congo (1960), Cyprus (1964), the Sinai (1973), Vietnam (with the International Control Commission), Golan Heights, Lebanon (1978), and Namibia (1989‚Äì1990). Canada did not follow the American lead in all Cold War actions, sometimes leading to tensions. Canada refused to join the Vietnam War and in 1984 the last nuclear weapons based in Canada were removed. Relations were maintained with Cuba and the Canadian government recognized the People's Republic of China before the United States. The Canadian military maintained a standing presence in Western Europe as part of its NATO deployment at several bases in Germany ‚Äì including long tenures at CFB Baden-Soellingen and CFB Lahr, in the Black Forest region of West Germany. Also Canadian military facilities were maintained in Bermuda, France and the United Kingdom. From the early 1960s until the 1980s, Canada maintained weapon platforms armed with nuclear weapons ‚Äì including nuclear-tipped air-to-air rockets, surface-to-air missiles, and high-yield gravity bombs principally deployed in the Western European theatre of operations as well as in Canada. Background The Royal Canadian Air Force, February 1945. By the end of World War II, Canada fielded a significantly large air force, and navy. Canada emerged from the Second World War as a world power, radically transforming a principally agricultural and rural dominion of a dying empire into a truly sovereign nation, with a market economy focused on a combination of resource extraction and refinement, heavy manufacturing, and high-technology research and development. As a consequence of supplying so much of the war effort for six long years, Canada's military grew to an exceptional size: over a million service personnel, the world's fifth largest surface fleet and fourth largest air force. Despite a draw-down at the end of the war, the Canadian military nonetheless executed Operation Muskox, a massive deployment across the Canadian Arctic designed in part to train for a ground and air war in the region. Canadians also assisted in humanitarian efforts, and sending observers for the United Nations to India and Palestine in 1947 and 1948. There was never any doubt early on as to which side Canada was on in the Cold War due to its location and historical alliances. On the domestic front, the Canadian state at all levels fought vehemently against what it characterized as communist subversion. Canadian and business leaders opposed the advance of the labour movement on the grounds that it was a Bolshevik conspiracy during the interwar period. The peak moments of this effort were the Winnipeg General Strike of 1919 and the anticommunist campaigns of the depression, including the stopping of the On-to-Ottawa Trek. Early Cold War (1946‚Äì1960) In February 1946, the Canadian government disclosed to the public the defection of a Soviet cipher clerk, Igor Gouzenko, in Ottawa; who also disclosed the existence of a Soviet spy ring in the country. The event has been used by historians to mark the beginning of the Cold War era in Canada, with the Gouzenko affair triggering another red scare in Canada. Canada was a founding member of NATO (North Atlantic Treaty Organization), of which Prime Minister St. Laurent was a chief architect. Canada was one of its most ardent supporters and pushed (largely unsuccessfully) to have it become an economic and cultural organization in addition to a military alliance. Dew Line, the Mid-Canada Line, and the Pinetree Line, a series of early warning radar systems developed in the 1950s. To defend North America against a possible enemy attack, Canada and the United States began to work very closely together in the 1950s. The North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) created a joint air-defense system. In northern Canada, the Distant Early Warning Line (Dew Line) was established to give warning of Soviet bombers heading over the north pole. Similar early warning radar systems were also developed in the middle of Canada, known as the Mid-Canada Line; and across the 50th parallel north, known as the Pinetree Line. =Domestic anti-Communism= Canada addressed the threat posed by Communist sympathizers in a manner more moderate than in the United States. The United States wished the Canadian government would go further, asking for a purging of trade unions, but the Canadian government left the purge of trade unions to the AFL-CIO. The American officials were especially concerned about the sailors on Great Lakes freight vessels, and, in 1951, Canada added them to those already screened by its secret anti-communist screening program. The Communist Party of Canada had not been outlawed since Section 98 was repealed by Prime Minister Mackenzie King in 1935. Despite its comparatively moderate stance towards Communism, the Canadian state continued intensive surveillance of Communists and sharing of intelligence with the United States. PROFUNC was a Government of Canada top secret plan to identify and detain Communist sympathizers during the height of the Cold War.CBC: Secret Cold War plan included mass detentions Tensions between Canada and the United States heightened during this time as on April 4, 1957, Canadian Ambassador to Egypt, E. Herbert Norman, leaped to his death from a Cairo building after the United States Senate Subcommittee on Internal Security released a textual record of a previous hearing to the media. Despite having been cleared several years earlier, first by the RCMP in 1950, then again by the Canadian Minister of External Affairs, Lester B. Pearson, the United States media portrayed Norman as a spy and traitor. The only evidence the United States had was that as a student at Cambridge and Harvard he was a part of a Marxist communist study group. This made Pearson, who was still External Affairs Minister, backed by outrage across the country, send a note to the US Government, threatening to offer no more security information on Canadian citizens until it was guaranteed that this information would not slip beyond the executive branch of the government. =Peacekeeping= Two Canadian officers during the Korean War. During the war, Canadian Forces were dispatched as a part of the United Nations forces. It was during the Cold War period that Canada began to assert the international clout that went along with the reputation it had built on the international stage in World War I and World War II. In the Korean War, the moderately sized contingent of volunteer soldiers from Canada made noteworthy contributions to the United Nations forces and served with distinction. Of particular note is the Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry's contribution to the Battle of Kapyong. Canada's major Cold War contribution to international politics was made in the innovation and implementation of 'Peacekeeping'. Although a United Nations military force had been proposed and advocated for the preservation of peace vis a vis the U.N.'s mandate by Canada's representatives Prime Minister Mackenzie King and his Secretary of State for External Affairs Louis St. Laurent at the United Nations Conference on International Organization in San Francisco in June 1945, it was not adopted at that time. Lester B. Pearson, Secretary for External Affairs, 1957. The previous year, Pearson proposed the creation of a United Nations Emergency Force to diffuse the Suez Crisis. During the Suez Crisis of 1956, the idea promoted by Canada in 1945 of a United Nations military force returned to the fore. The conflict involving Britain, France, Israel and Egypt quickly developed into a potential flashpoint between the emerging 'superpowers' of the United States and the Soviet Union as the Soviets made intimations that they would militarily support Egypt's cause. The Soviets went as far as to say they would be willing to use \\"all types of modern weapons of destruction\\" on London and Paris ‚Äì an overt threat of nuclear attack. Canadian diplomat Lester B. Pearson re- introduced then Prime Minister Louis St. Laurent's UN military force concept in the form of an 'Emergency Force' that would intercede and divide the combatants, and form a buffer zone or 'human shield' between the opposing forces. Pearson's United Nations Emergency Force (UNEF) ‚Äì the first peacekeeping force, was deployed to separate the combatants and a cease-fire and resolution was drawn up to end the hostilities. Canada‚ÄìU.S. tensions (1961‚Äì1980) Great debate broke out while John Diefenbaker was Prime Minister as to whether Canada should accept U.S. nuclear weapons on its territory. Diefenbaker had already agreed to buy the BOMARC missile system from the Americans, which would be not as effective without nuclear warheads, but balked at permitting the weapons into Canada. A RCAF CIM-10 Bomarc missile in North Bay, Ontario. Viewed as an alternative to the defunct Avro Arrow program, its adoption garnered controversy given its nuclear payload. Canada also maintained diplomatic and economic ties with Cuba following the Cuban Revolution. Prior to the Cuban Missile Crisis, the insistence on a much more placated policy towards the Cuban government had been a source of contention between the United States and Canada. Prime Minister Diefenbaker firmly stood by his policy decision, insisting that this was the result of the rights of states to establish their own forms of government, rejection of current US interpretation of the Monroe Doctrine as well as Canada's right to establish its own foreign policy. Concern in the Canadian government was focused primarily on nuclear weapons, many politicians in the opposition and in power believed that as long as the US president retained absolute control of the nuclear weapons, Canadian forces could be ordered to undertake nuclear missions for the US without Canadian consent. During the Cuban Missile Crisis, Canada was expected to fall in line with American foreign policy, in that Canada's military forces were expected to go on immediate war alert status. Diefenbaker however, refused to do so emphasizing the need for United Nations intervention. It would only be after a tense phone call between President John F. Kennedy and Diefenbaker that Canada's armed forces would begin preparations for \\"immediate enemy attack\\". Although the crisis would eventually be solved by diplomatic talks between Nikita Khrushchev and Kennedy, nothing would loom larger over the Canadian state in the months following the crisis than the governing party's disarray on the question of nuclear arms. In the 1963 Canadian election, Diefenbaker was replaced by the famed diplomat Lester B. Pearson, who accepted the warheads. Further tensions developed when Pearson criticized the American role in the Vietnam War in a speech he gave at Temple University in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. See also Canada and the Vietnam War. Canadian Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau and U.S. President Richard Nixon, 1972. Tensions between Canada and the U.S. increased shortly after the implementation of the Nixon Shock in 1971. Shortly after the implementation of economic policies, and tariffs, known as the Nixon shock, the Canadian government began to articulate a Third Option policy; with plans to diversify Canadian trade, and downgrade the importance of its relationship with the United States. In a 1972 speech in Ottawa, Nixon declared the \\"special relationship\\" between Canada and the United States dead.Bruce Muirhead, \\"From Special Relationship to Third Option: Canada, the U.S., and the Nixon Shock,\\" American Review of Canadian Studies, Vol. 34, 2004 online edition During this period, Canada played a middle power role in international affairs, and pursued diplomatic relations with Communist countries that the US had severed ties with, such as Cuba and China after their respective revolutions. Canada argued that rather than being soft on Communism, it was pursuing a strategy of \\"constructive engagement\\" whereby it sought to influence Communism through the course of its international relationships. Canada also refused to join the Organization of American States, disliking the support and tolerance of the Cold War OAS for dictators. Under Pearson's successor Pierre Trudeau, US- Canadian policies grew further apart. Trudeau removed nuclear weapons from Canadian soil, formally recognized the People's Republic of China, established a personal friendship with Castro, and decreased the number of Canadian troops stationed at NATO bases in Europe. Final years of the Cold War (1980‚Äì1991) Brian Mulroney and Ronald Reagan had a close relationship, but the 1980s also saw widespread protests against American testing of cruise missiles in Canada's north. In addition, Canada may have played a small role in helping to bring about glasnost and perestroika. In the mid-1970s, Alexander Yakovlev was appointed as ambassador to Canada, remaining at that post for a decade. During this time, he and Canadian Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau became close friends. In the early 1980s, Yakovlev accompanied Mikhail Gorbachev, who at the time was the Soviet official in charge of agriculture, on his tour of Canada. The purpose of the visit was to tour Canadian farms and agricultural institutions in the hopes of taking lessons that could be applied in the Soviet Union; however, the two began, tentatively at first, to discuss the need for liberalisation in the Soviet Union. Yakovlev then returned to Moscow, and would eventually be called the \\"godfather of glasnost\\", the intellectual force behind Gorbachev's reform program. Theseus to lay an acoustic array throughout the Arctic seaboard, in an effort to detect Soviet submarines. In 1987, Canada released a long-awaited White Paper on Defence; signalling its intent to re-assert sovereignty over its Arctic Waters. Concerned that Soviet submarines were operating in Canada's Arctic Archipelago, several programs were proposed to close the gap between Canada's current capabilities and its commitments to NATO. Project Spinnaker was born, a joint Canada‚ÄìUS endeavour whose secret purpose was to provide the capability to monitor submarine traffic in Canadian Arctic waters by deploying acoustic listening posts on the seafloor. This project required the development of a large autonomous underwater vehicle ‚Äì named Theseus ‚Äì whose sole purpose was to lay communications trunk cables on the seafloor in waters with a permanent ice cover. In the spring of 1996, Theseus was transported to CFS Alert (on the northeastern tip of Ellesmere Island) then was deployed from an ice camp where it laid 180 km of fibre optic cable on the seafloor in ice-covered waters, successfully delivering it to an acoustic array deployed on the edge of the Continental Shelf. Post-Cold War When the Cold War ended, Canadian Forces were withdrawn from their NATO commitments in Germany, military spending was cut, and air raid sirens were removed across the country. The Diefenbunkers, Canada's military-operated fallout shelters designed to ensure continuity of government, were decommissioned. In 1994, the last active United States military base in Canada, Naval Station Argentia Newfoundland, was decommissioned and the facility was turned over to the Government of Canada. The base was a storage facility for the Mk 101 Lulu and B57 nuclear bombs and a key node in the US Navy's SOSUS network to detect Soviet nuclear submarines. Canada continues to participate in Cold War institutions such as NORAD and NATO, but they have been given new missions and priorities. CF-18 Hornet at CFB Baden‚ÄìSoellingen, shortly before the airbase's closure in 1993. The end of the Cold War saw the withdrawal of Canadian military formations in Europe. The Cold War in Canada came to an end during the period 1990‚Äì1995 as the traditional mission to contain Soviet expansion faded into the new realities of warfare. The Cold War required permanent foreign deployments to Western Europe, something which was no longer necessary, and as such bases closed down. Less equipment was needed, and so much was sold off, soon to be replaced by newer equipment designed for future conflicts. At home, bases were closed and operations consolidated and streamlined for maximum efficiency, as by the early 1990s many Canadians were openly questioning the necessity of large defence budgets. In 1990, Canadian troops were deployed to assist provincial police in Qu√©bec in an effort to defuse tensions between Mohawk Warriors and the Suret√© du Qu√©bec and local residents. In 1991 Canadian Forces personnel deployed in support of the American liberation of Kuwait. By 1992, Canadian peacekeepers were deployed to Cambodia, Croatia and Somalia. In 1993 Balkan involvement expanded into Bosnia and Canadian troops participated in some of the fiercest combat since the Korean War during Operation Medak Pocket. By the end of the 1990s, Canada would have a completely different military, one more inclined towards the rigours of peacekeeping and peace-making operations under multi-national coalitions. The country would be further involved in the Yugoslav Wars throughout the rest of the decade, would become involved in Haiti, and would further see action again in Zaire and East Timor. The Navy, by decade's end (and prior to the modern post-9/11 era), was comparatively brand new, the Air Force well-balanced and modern as well. The Army began to acquire new equipment, such as the LAV-III, Bison APC and the Coyote Reconnaissance Vehicle as it transitioned to fighting irregular warfare instead of the large tank battles once feared would rage across Western Europe. It is with Canada's late-Cold War and early-Peacekeeping Era military that Canada would embark on its deployment to Afghanistan, currently Canada's longest-running war.

It is a major landmark of the southern portion of Nicollet Mall and home to many events throughout the year, in addition to being the Orchestra's home. The auditorium seats 2,089, of which about 1,200 are accommodated on the main floor. The remaining seats are placed in three balconies above and along the sides of the main floor. The auditorium is actually a second building separated for acoustical reasons by a one-inch gap from the \\"shell\\" which contains the lobby and various administrative offices. The stage contains an unusual feature: a large cube motif in the rear stage wall which continues along the ceiling towards the rear of the auditorium. The cubes were added for acoustic reasons, successfully, and turned out to be visually striking as well. History The Hall was built by Hammel, Green and Abrahamson in 1974 (as was the adjacent Peavey Plaza) and opened for the 1974 concert season. Originally noted for its modernist design, chosen to represent an orchestra for everyone, not what was then perceived to be the formal \\"elitist\\" designs of the past. The exterior of the building was recognizable by its large, blue ventilation ducts. Their unusual size was chosen to reduce air velocity and hence noise. The lobby area's original \\"power plant\\" design was meant to remove tones of class and privilege from the symphony-going experience; it was upgraded in late 1997 and included several bars. Expansive windows overlooked the street. Built in 1975, Peavey Plaza was designed by landscape architect M. Paul Friedberg who also designed the Loring Greenway. The plaza which holds an amphitheater and water fountain is considered one of the endangered historic properties in Minnesota. Renovation In April 2007, it was announced that the hall would be undergoing a multimillion-dollar renovation.\\"What Sounds Great at Orchestra Hall? A $90m Facelift\\" St. Paul Pioneer Press, 30 April 2007. This renovation had a heavy emphasis on the lobby and patron areas. On April 9, 2010, plans were revealed for a $40 million renovation and expansion. The lobby and public areas were doubled in size and the former utilitarian exterior was replaced with stone and glass. A grand new entrance was also added. KPMB of Toronto were the architects and MBJ of Minneapolis were the structural engineers. Construction began in June 2012.

Despite the word \\"range\\", the iron ranges are not mountain chains, but outcrops of Precambrian sedimentary formations containing high percentages of iron. These cherty iron ore deposits are Precambrian in age for the Vermilion Range, while middle Precambrian in age for the Mesabi and Cuyuna ranges, all in Minnesota. The Gogebic Range in Wisconsin and the Marquette Iron Range and Menominee Range in Michigan have similar characteristics and are of similar age. Natural ores and concentrates were produced from 1848 until the mid 1950s, when taconites and jaspers were concentrated and pelletized, and started to become the major source of iron production. The far eastern area, containing the Duluth Complex along the shore of Lake Superior, and the far northern area, along the Canada‚ÄìUS border, of the region are not associated with iron ore mining. Due to its shape, the area is collectively referred to as the Arrowhead region of Minnesota. It consists of seven counties: Aitkin, Carlton, Cook, Itasca, Koochiching, Lake, and Saint Louis. The Iron Range and its economy Map of Minnesota with the Iron Range counties highlighted. Iron ore Croft Mine Historic Park Soudan Underground Mine State Park From a geological perspective, the Iron Range in Minnesota includes these four major iron deposits:2 Billion Years Ago: Iron Range Beginnings, Minnesota Historical Society * Mesabi Range, the largest iron range, largely within Itasca and Saint Louis counties; * Vermilion Range, northeast of the Mesabi, in Saint Louis and Lake counties; * Gunflint Range is in the extreme northern portion of Cook County and extends into Canada; and * Cuyuna Range, southwest of the Mesabi, largely within Crow Wing County. Within Minnesota, \\"The Iron Range Resources and Rehabilitation is a State Department, established by the legislature of 1941 to render public service through research and the actual development of all the state's resources both natural and human.\\" The Iron Range Resources and Rehabilitation Board (IRRRB), known simply as \\"the I-triple-R-B\\" or Iron Range Resources,Iron Range Resources is an economic development agency funded partly by taxes levied by the state on taconite-producing companies and charged with creating jobs. History Geologically, the iron ranges in Minnesota belong to the Animikie Group. The geologic history of the formations containing iron are typical of banded iron formations worldwide. Prior to the 19th century, Native American groups mined native copper on the Keweenaw Peninsula. William Austin Burt discovered iron ore in the Marquette Range near Negaunee, Michigan in 1844. Iron ore was quickly discovered on the Menominee Range in 1867, on the Gogebic Range in 1884, on the Vermilion Range in 1885, the Mesabi Range in 1890, and the Cuyuna Range in 1903. Underground mines were developed to remove the valuable ore of most ranges. However, iron mining operations on the Mesabi and Cuyuna Ranges evolved into enormous open pit mines, where steam shovels and other industrial machines could remove massive amounts of ore. \\"Large-scale commercial production of magnetite taconite ore on the Mesabi Range started in 1956 at the Peter Mitchell Mine near Babbitt, Minnesota.\\" Cities The Iron Range contains several smaller cities. Some of the more significant communities in the region include: * Aitkin (pop. 2,165) is located on the eastern edge of the Cuyuna Range. Aitkin was the birthplace of stage and film actor Warren William. * Aurora (pop. 1,853) is located on the Eastern Mesabi Range. The former St. James, Meadow, Miller and Stephens mines lie within the city limits. * Babbitt (pop. 1,475) * Biwabik (pop. 969) * Bovey (pop. 804) is located along U.S. Highway 169 between Coleraine and Taconite. Bovey was the birthplace of NHL goaltender Adam Hauser, San Francisco politician Richard Hongisto, and Eric Enstrom ‚Äì photographer of the famous 1918 photograph \\"Grace.\\" * Buhl (pop. 1,000) is located along U.S. Highway 169 between Chisholm and Virginia. Buhl is known for its fine water and claims \\"The Finest Water in America\\" on its water tower. * Chisholm (pop. 4,976) is the geographic center of the Mesabi Range, home of the Chisholm Bluestreaks. It is the home of Minnesota Discovery Center, the Minnesota Museum of Mining, and the Iron Range Research Center. Archibald \\"Moonlight\\" Graham, subject of the motion picture \\"Field of Dreams\\" settled in Chisholm. The motion picture \\"North Country\\" was also partly filmed in Chisholm. * Coleraine (pop. 1,970) is referred to as the \\"start place of the Iron Range.\\" The town was built in the early 20th century to accommodate the miners of the Oliver Iron Mining's Canisteo Mine. John Greenway was the superintendent of the mine; Greenway School District in Coleraine is named for him. * Crosby (pop. 2,386) is an old mining boomtown on the southwestern edge of the Iron Range, home of the Crosby-Ironton Rangers. * Duluth (pop. 86,265) The fourth largest city in the state, while not part of the Iron Range, is a destination for much of its production shipped via the DM&IR; railroad. Iron pellets are shipped \\"downward\\" through the Soo Locks to steel towns such as Cleveland, Erie, Toledo et al. The Port of Duluth allows for the iron ore to be easily shipped through the Great Lakes. * Deerwood (pop. 529) Mining engineer Cuyler Adams discovered the Cuyuna Range near Deerwood in 1895. * Ely (pop. 3,460), in the Vermillion Range, is perhaps best known as the most popular entry point for the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness. * Eveleth (pop. 3,718) is where U.S. Senator Paul Wellstone and seven others died in a plane crash in 2002 two miles away from the municipal airport. It also the site of the conflict that resulted in the landmark sexual harassment class action case Jenson v. Eveleth Taconite Co. and the film North Country. It is also home of the United States Hockey Hall of Fame. * Grand Rapids (pop. 10,869) is named for the local rapids in the Mississippi River, which was the uppermost limit of practical steamboat travel during the late 19th century. Today, those rapids are hidden underneath the dam of the Blandin Paper Mill, which has its papermaking facilities in downtown Grand Rapids. The city is considered to lie on the westernmost edge of the Mesabi Range. The current economy has a large tourist footing, with many local resorts, golf courses, and regional hunting and fishing. Grand Rapids is the birthplace of entertainer Judy Garland. * Gilbert (pop. 1,799) is home of one of Minnesota's most well known off-highway vehicle parks. It is also the location of Lake Ore-be-gone, which is actually an artificial lake created by flooding three open-pit iron ore mines. *Grand Marais (pop. 1,351) The area was a bustling fur trading station since the 1700s, and the French Voyageurs termed the settled village ‚ÄòGrand Marais‚Äô which is French for \\"Great Marsh\\", referring to a marsh that, in early fur- trading times, was 20 acres (8.1 ha) or less in area, nearly at the level of Lake Superior, and situated at the head of the little bay and harbor that led to the settlement of the village there. The town comprises much of the Gunflint Trail, which extends to the former Paulson Mine site. * Hibbing (pop. 16,361) is the largest city by area in the state of Minnesota and is the former boyhood home of Bob Dylan, basketball great Kevin McHale and the location of the Hull‚ÄìRust‚ÄìMahoning Open Pit Iron Mine, one of the largest open pit iron mines in the world. Hibbing is also the birthplace of Roger Maris. * Hoyt Lakes, Minnesota (pop. 1,888) is the located on Eastern Mesabi Range. Erie Mining Company previously mined ore and there is currently ongoing testing to mine new minerals. * Keewatin, Minnesota (pop. 1,068) is located between Nashwauk and Hibbing. It is home to U.S. Steel's KeeTac taconite mining and processing plant. It is the hometown of New England Patriots Hall of Famer Gino Cappelletti and Big Ten College Baseball's record holder for most career wins and current Minnesota Gophers baseball coach, John Anderson. * Kinney (pop. 169) is an old mining boomtown on the Iron Range, located between Buhl and Mountain Iron. * Mountain Iron (pop. 2,869) is home to Minntac, the world's largest taconite processing plant. * Nashwauk (pop. 983) is a small town between Grand Rapids and Hibbing, 4 miles from Keewatin. There are a few pit lakes in the area that now hold bass, lake trout, and northern pike. Currently (2010), Essar Minnesota Steel LLC is constructing a new direct-reduction steel producing facility north of town. It is a first for the Iron Range, as it will have blast furnaces on-site to produce steel from the mining of taconite. * Soudan is an unincorporated community in Breitung Township, Saint Louis County. It is located immediately east of the city of Tower on Minn.Highway 169 / Minn.Highway 1, where the area school and business district are located. It is the home of the Soudan Underground Mine State Park which contained the University of Minnesota's Soudan Underground Laboratory which housed detectors, including MINOS, over 700 meters below the surface of the Earth. * Taconite (pop. 360) named after the taconite pellets from iron ore was a town many miners lived in. The town recently celebrated its centennial year and is famous for its rich hockey tradition. * Two Harbors (pop. 3,745) is the county seat of Lake County, Minnesota along the shore of Lake Superior. The town was historically an important port for loading and shipping iron ore from the Range. However, like Duluth, Two Harbors is not itself a mining town. * Virginia (pop. 8,712), perched next to the Rouchleau mine pit which is nearly three miles long, a half-mile wide and 450 feet deep. Virginia is the major retail shopping center of the northern part of the Iron Range, and has the Thunderbird Mall. Four miles north of Virginia is the Laurentian Divide, which separates the watershed of the streams that flow north to the Arctic Ocean from the watershed of the streams that flow southeast through the Great Lakes to the Atlantic Ocean. The motion picture \\"North Country\\" was also partly filmed in Virginia, notably the courthouse sequences. * Winton (pop 172). Once several times larger than Ely, Winton sits just 3 miles north of Ely, and was once home to a very large lumber mill and was a lumber boomtown. Culture The area has a recognizably Italian, Slavic, and Scandinavian/Nordic heritage. A noticeable northern Minnesota accent is present in the area, especially among older people, hence the popular nickname, \\"Da Range.\\" See also North Central American English. Ice hockey is a predominant sport in the region, which has produced several NHL players as well as all three members of the \\"Iron line\\" from the 1980 U.S.A. Hockey Miracle on Ice team. Bob Dylan, who grew up in Hibbing, memorialized the Iron Range in the 1963 song \\"North Country Blues\\", a lament portraying hard times in the region. Presented in his 1964 album The Times They Are a-Changin', it includes such lines as: :So the mining gates locked and the red iron rotted :And the room smelled heavy from drinking :When the sad, silent song made the hour twice as long :As I waited for the sun to go sinking The Iron Range is known for Cornish pasties stuffed with carrots, ground beef and potatoes. Pasties were an easy lunch for those working deep in the iron mines. Slovenian and Croatian immigrants brought the honey-nut bread called potica to the Iron Range region that is still served at Easter and Christmas in northern Minnesota. Politics The rural area has remained a Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party stronghold because of its history of a largely unionized workforce in the mining industry, the mainstay of the economy of the Iron Range. In 2004, John Kerry carried most of the counties in the region by a comfortable margin. This was perhaps aided by George W. Bush referring to the area as the \\"Iron Ridge\\" in a campaign speech. Barack Obama outperformed McCain in 2008, carrying every county in the Iron Range. The area remains the greatest Democratic stronghold in Minnesota after the urban centers of Minneapolis and St. Paul. In 2016, Donald Trump's populist message enabled him to gain ground in the Iron Range, winning multiple counties and reducing the Democratic margins of victory in others. Climate The region is known for harsh winters, and pleasant summers. The average year-round temperature is in the 30s ¬∞F (between about 2 ¬∞C and 4 ¬∞C). Temperatures below ‚àí40 ¬∞F/¬∞C occur somewhere in the region during most winters. For example, statistics from the Midwestern Regional Climate Center climate summaries , record that Virginia, MN has a mean annual temperature of 38 ¬∞F, with an average January low temperature of ‚àí6.2 ¬∞F (about ‚àí21 ¬∞C) and July high of 77.4 ¬∞F (25 ¬∞C). Precipitation there averages 27 in (690 mm) annually and snowfall 53.2 in (135 cm). Near Lake Superior, the temperature differences are somewhat less extreme, but due to its proximity to the lake annual snowfalls over 100 inches are common.

Writers disagree in how much of the shield's surface is to be covered by a fess or other ordinary, ranging from one-fifth to one-third. The Oxford Guide to Heraldry states that earlier writers including Leigh, Holme, and Guillim favour one-third, while later writers such as Edmondson favour one-fifth \\"on the grounds that a bend, pale, or chevron occupying one-third of the field makes the coat look clumsy and disagreeable.\\"Woodcock & Robinson (1988), Oxford Guide to Heraldry, p. 58. A fess is likely to be shown narrower if it is uncharged, that is, if it does not have other charges placed on it, and/or if it is to be shown with charges above and below it; and shown wider if charged. The fess or bar, termed fasce in French heraldry, should not be confused with fasces.

A shield of (often six or eight) horizontal stripes of alternating colour is called barry. Narrower versions of the bar are called barrulets (\\"little bars\\"), and when a shield of horizontal stripes alternating colour is composed of ten or more stripes, it is called barruly or burely instead of barry. A cotise, defined as half the width of a barrulet, may be borne alongside a fess, and often two of these appear, one on either side of the fess. This is often termed \\"a fess cotised\\" (also cottised, coticed or cotticed). Another diminutive of the fess called a closet is said to be between a bar and barrulet, but this is seldom found. A fess when couped (\\"cut off\\" at either end, and so not reaching the sides of the shield) can be called humetty, but this term is very rare in the Anglophone heraldries and is most often used of the cross.

A charge placed horizontally may be termed fesswise or fessways, and two or more charges arranged in a horizontal row are blazoned in fess or in bar. Notable and unusual forms A mural fess, that is a fess embattled and masoned of the field, can be seen in the arms of Suzanne Elizabeth Altvater. The arms of Baroness Fritchie provide an example of three Barrulets fracted and there conjoined to a Chevronel. A flag which has a central horizontal stripe that is half the height of the flag is sometimes said to have a Spanish fess. The name is based on the most well-known example of this style of flag, the flag of Spain. See also * Bar (heraldry) Notes Further reading * Boutell, Charles (1890).

Long a serial composer, Rochberg abandoned the practice following the death of his teenage son in 1964; he claimed this compositional technique had proved inadequate to express his grief and had found it empty of expressive intent. By the 1970s, Rochberg's use of tonal passages in his music had invoked controversy among critics and fellow composers. A teacher at the University of Pennsylvania until 1983, Rochberg also served as chairman of its music department until 1968 and was named the first Annenberg Professor of the Humanities in 1978. For notable students Life Born in Paterson, New Jersey, Rochberg attended first the Mannes College of Music, where his teachers included George Szell and Hans Weisse, then the Curtis Institute of Music, where he studied with Rosario Scalero and Gian Carlo Menotti. He served in the United States Army in the infantry during World War II. He was Jewish . Rochberg served as chairman of the music department at the University of Pennsylvania until 1968 and continued to teach there until 1983. In 1978, he was named the first Annenberg Professor of the Humanities . He married Gene Rosenfeld in 1941, and had two children, Paul and Francesca. In 1964, his son died of a brain tumor. Rochberg died in Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania in 2005, aged 86. Most of his works are held in the archive of the Paul Sacher Foundation in Basel, Switzerland. Some can also be found in the Music Division of the New York Public Library, the Library of Congress in Washington D.C., the Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts in New York City, New York, the University of Pennsylvania, Curtis Institute of Music, Philadelphia, and the City University of New York. Music A longtime exponent of serialism, Rochberg abandoned this compositional technique upon the death of his teenage son in 1964. He said he had found serialism empty of expressive intent and that it had proved an inadequate means for him to express his grief and rage. By the 1970s, Rochberg had become controversial for the use of tonal passages in his music. His use of tonality first became widely known through the String Quartet No. 3 (1972), which includes an entire set of variations that are in the style of late Beethoven. Another movement of the quartet contains passages reminiscent of the music of Gustav Mahler. This use of tonality caused critics to classify him as a neoromantic composer. He compared atonality to abstract art and tonality to concrete art and compared his artistic evolution with Philip Guston's, saying \\"the tension between concreteness and abstraction\\" is a fundamental issue for both of them . His music has also been described as neoconservative postmodernism . Of the works Rochberg composed early in his career, the Symphony No. 2 (1955‚Äì56) stands out as an accomplished serial composition by an American composer. He is perhaps best known for his String Quartets Nos. 3‚Äì6 (1972‚Äì78). Rochberg conceived Nos. 4‚Äì6 as a set and named them the \\"Concord Quartets\\" after the Concord String Quartet, which premiered and recorded the works. The String Quartet No. 6 includes a set of variations on the Pachelbel Canon in D. A few of his works were musical collages of quotations from other composers. \\"Contra Mortem et Tempus\\", for example, contains passages from Pierre Boulez, Luciano Berio, Edgard Var√®se and Charles Ives. Symphonies Nos. 1, 2, and 5, and the Violin Concerto were recorded in 2001‚Äì2002 by the Saarbr√ºcken Radio Symphony Orchestra and conductor Christopher Lyndon Gee and released on the Naxos label. =Legacy= James Freeman, musician and teacher at Swarthmore College, said this about Rochberg and serialism: \\"If George Rochberg can do something like that, there's nothing that I can't do and get away with it. I don't have to write 12-tone music; I can if I want to. I can write stuff that sounds like Brahms. I can do anything I want. I'm free. And that was an extraordinary feeling in the late 1960s for young composers, I think, many of whom felt really constrained to write serial music\\" . Writings Rochberg's collected essays were published by the University of Michigan Press in 1984 as The Aesthetics of Survival. A revised and expanded edition , published shortly before his death, was awarded an ASCAP Deems Taylor Award in 2006 . Selections from his correspondence with Canadian composer Istv√°n Anhalt were published in 2007 by Wilfrid Laurier University Press . His memoirs, Five Lines, Four Spaces, were published by the University of Illinois Press in May 2009 .

In this sequel to Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior, Max (Mel Gibson) is exiled into the desert by the ruthless ruler of Bartertown, Aunty Entity (Tina Turner), and there encounters an isolated cargo cult centred on a crashed Boeing 747 and its deceased captain. The film is the third installment in the Mad Max film series and the last with Gibson as Max Rockatansky. The series was given a fourth installment in 2015 with Mad Max: Fury Road, starring Tom Hardy in the title role. Plot In post-apocalyptic Australia, Max Rockatansky is crossing the desert in a camel-drawn V8 wagon when he is attacked by a Transavia PL-12 Airtruk piloted by a man named Jedediah and his son. They steal his wagon and belongings, and Max continues on foot, following their trail to a survivor community named 'Bartertown' - which has rebuilt ramshackle vestiges of basic civilization, even electricity. Initially refused entry because he has nothing to trade, Max is brought before the founder and ruler of Bartertown, the ruthless Aunty Entity. She offers to resupply his vehicle and equipment if he completes a task for her. Aunty explains that Bartertown‚Äôs electrical supply depends on a crude methane refinery powered by pig feces. The refinery is run by a dwarf called Master and his giant bodyguard Blaster. \\"Master Blaster\\" holds an uneasy truce with Aunty for control of Bartertown; however, Master has begun to challenge Aunty's leadership. Aunty instructs Max to provoke a confrontation with Blaster. According to Bartertown law, conflicts are resolved by a duel to the death in a gladiatorial arena called Thunderdome. Max enters the subterranean Underworld refinery area to size up Master Blaster and befriends Pig Killer, a convict sentenced to work for slaughtering a pig to feed his family. Max finds his stolen vehicle in Master/Blaster's possession and is forced to disarm his own booby-trapped engine. Here he discovers that although Blaster is exceptionally strong, he is hypersensitive to high-pitched noises, which severely disorient and incapacitate him. Accusing Master of the theft of his vehicle, Max provokes him into demanding justice for the insult by entering Blaster into a Thunderdome duel with Max. Blaster dominates the duel until Max is able to use his bosun's whistle to gain the upper hand. Poised to kill Blaster, Max knocks his helmet off and is shocked to discover that Blaster has Down syndrome. Max refuses to kill a man with \\"the mind of a child\\" and confronts Aunty for deceiving him, thus exposing her plot. Master, previously unaware of this arrangement to kill Blaster, is furious and vows to shut down the refinery and, by extension, Bartertown. Aunty has Blaster killed, Master imprisoned, and Max exiled. He is bound on a horse and sent off in a random direction through the wasteland. When his mount perishes in a sinkhole, Max frees himself and presses on. Near death, Max is found by a desert dweller named Savannah Nix, who hauls him back to her home, \\"Planet Erf\\", a primitive community of children and teenagers who live in an oasis. The children, descended from survivors of a crashed Boeing 747, were left by their parents who went to find civilization. They believe Max to be the flight captain, G. L. Walker, returned to fix the aeroplane and fly them to civilization. Max denies this and insists that they remain in the relative safety of the oasis, knowing that the only \\"civilization\\" within reach is Bartertown. Some of the children, led by Savannah, leave anyway, determined to find the prophesied \\"Tomorrow-morrow Land.\\" Max stops them by force, but another tribe member, Scrooloose, sets them free during the night and leaves with them. Their leader, Slake M'Thirst, asks Max to go after them, and he agrees, taking a few of the children with him to help. They find Savannah's group in danger but are unable to save one of the children from a sinkhole. With no supplies left, they are forced to head for Bartertown. The group sneak in via an underground entrance, and, with Pig Killer's help, free Master and escape in a train- truck, destroying Bartertown's methane refinery in the process. Aunty leads the Imperial Guards in pursuit chasing in their postmodern vehicles, catching up to the train. Max's group slows them down while Scrooloose hijacks one of the pursuing vehicles. The group comes across Jedediah and his son, and Max coerces Jedediah into helping his group escape with their aeroplane. Max uses his vehicle to clear a path through Aunty's men, allowing the aeroplane to take off and escape, leaving him at Aunty's mercy. Aunty spares his life, having come to respect him, and departs to presumably make good on her vow to rebuild Bartertown. Jedediah flies the children to the coast, where they discover the nuclear-devastated ruins of Sydney. Years later, the children have established a small society of themselves and other lost wanderers in the ruins. Savannah, now leader of the group, recites a nightly story of their journey and the man who saved them, as Max, still alive in the desert, wanders on to places unknown. Cast * Mel Gibson as \\"Mad\\" Max Rockatansky, a former MFP officer and lone warrior. Max roves the desert aimlessly, his existence entirely based around self-survival. * Tina Turner as Aunty Entity, the ruthless, determined ruler of Bartertown. Entity is a glamorous, Amazon-like figure who recognises a strength of character in Max, and hopes to exploit him to gain sole control of Bartertown from Master. Despite her brutality and Bartertown's chaos, Entity is an intelligent, cultured woman, who holds a hope of one day rebuilding society to its former glory. In regard of the character, Miller said, \\"We needed someone whose vitality and intelligence would make her control over Bartertown credible. She had to be a positive character rather than a conventional evil 'bad guy.' We had worked on the script with [Turner] in mind. But we had no idea if she'd be interested.\\" * Bruce Spence as Jedediah the Pilot, a marauding pilot who trades stolen goods in Bartertown. Spence previously played the Gyro Captain in Mad Max 2. \\"They were well into the shoot when they offered me a part described as 'not the Gyro Captain but kind of like the Gyro Captain!'\\" said Spence. \\"They said there's kind of a reflection of him and that they were having difficulty casting the role so they thought to themselves, 'Why not Bruce!'\\" * Adam Cockburn as Jedediah Jr., Jedediah's son, who often helps his father steal supplies, flying his father's aeroplane while Jedediah procures the goods. * Frank Thring as the Collector, head of Bartertown's trade and exchange network. * Angelo Rossitto as Master, a diminutive former engineer, who parlays his technical expertise into building the methane extractor responsible for Bartertown's electricity. When the film begins, Master has grown power-crazed under the protection of Blaster, and the reverence he receives from the people of Bartertown. He frequently humiliates Entity into acknowledging his power over her. When Blaster is killed however, Master becomes a far more subdued, humble character, and eventually escapes with the help of Max, Pig Killer, and the children. * Paul Larsson as Blaster, Master's silent, mentally-impaired bodyguard. * Angry Anderson as Ironbar Bassey, head of Bartertown's security and Aunty Entity's Number One Henchman. Despite his short height he is a fierce warrior figure, wearing a doll's head standard on his back, who comes to dislike Max more and more as the film proceeds. After several near-death incidents where his survival becomes more and more unlikely, he is last seen giving the middle finger to the escaping heroes, having somehow survived even the film's climactic chase. * Robert Grubb as the Pig Killer, a convict in Bartertown sentenced to work in the methane refinery, shovelling pig feces, for the crime of killing one of Underworld's pigs to feed his children. He befriends Max, and when Max and the children return to rescue Master, the Pig Killer escapes to help them. * Helen Buday as Savannah Nix, leader of a tribe of child survivors (or the children of those survivors) from a crashed 747. Savannah is the one who ensures the tribe remembers its past through the \\"tells\\" and acts as a surrogate mother figure to many of them. * Tom Jennings as Slake M'Thirst, the male leader of the child tribe. * Edwin Hodgeman as Dr. Dealgood, the flamboyant Master of Ceremonies and chief auctioneer of Bartertown. *Rod Zuanic as Scrooloose. The misfit child able to copy everyone else's abilities and manners. * George Spartels as Blackfinger. Production Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome was the first Mad Max film made without producer Byron Kennedy, who was killed in a helicopter crash in 1983 while location scouting for the film. While the film was in development before Kennedy's death, director George Miller was hesitant to continue without his producing partner. \\"I was reluctant to go ahead,\\" said Miller. \\"And then there was a sort of need to ‚Äì let's do something just to get over the shock and grief of all of that.\\" A title card at the end of film reads: \\"...For Byron\\". Miller ended up co-directing the film with George Ogilvie, with whom he had worked on the 1983 miniseries The Dismissal. \\"I had a lot on my plate,\\" said Miller. \\"I asked my friend George Ogilvie, who was working on the mini-series, 'Could you come and help me?' But I don't remember the experience because I was doing it to just... You know, I was grieving.\\" Together, Miller and Ogilvie used a group workshopping rehearsal technique that they had developed.David Stratton, The Avocado Plantation: Boom and Bust in the Australian Film Industry, Pan MacMillan, 1990 p85-87 Exterior location filming took place primarily in the mining town of Coober Pedy, with the set for Bartertown built at an old brickworks (the Brickpit) at Homebush Bay in Sydney's western suburbs and the children's camp shot at the Blue Mountains. \\"Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome proved far more challenging than The Road Warrior,\\" said cinematographer Dean Semler. \\"We were dealing with more varied environments than before and it was essential that each of the worlds created for the film have a distinctly different look.\\" =Music= The musical score for Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome was composed by Maurice Jarre, replacing Brian May, who composed the music for the previous two films. The film also contains two songs performed by Tina Turner, \\"We Don't Need Another Hero (Thunderdome)\\" and \\"One of the Living\\", with the latter replacing Jarre's opening titles music. A soundtrack album was originally released by Capitol Records in 1985. It includes Turner's \\"We Don't Need Another Hero (Thunderdome)\\", which reached #1 in Canada, #2 in the US and #3 in the British single charts; it plays over the end credits. \\"One of the Living\\" was rerecorded for single release, and reached #15 in both Canada and the US, but only #55 in Britain. The song also won a Grammy for Best Rock Vocal. A double CD containing only Jarre's original music was issued in 2010 on Tadlow Music/Silva Screen Records. Release Although the film's budget was more extravagant than its predecessors', its box office yield was only moderate in comparison. Beyond Thunderdome grossed A$4,272,802 at the box office in Australia. In the United States and Canada it grossed $36 million, generating theatrical rentals of $18 million. Outside of the US, it earned a similar amount, giving it worldwide rentals of $36 million. =Critical reception= Critical reaction to the film was generally positive, although reviewers disagreed as to whether they considered the film the highest or lowest point of the Mad Max trilogy. Most of the criticism focused on the children in the second half of the film, whom many found too similar to the Lost Boys from the story of Peter Pan. Robert C. Cumbow of Slant Magazine identifies \\"whole ideas, themes and characterizations\\" adopted from Riddley Walker, a 1980 post-apocalyptic novel by Russell Hoban. On the other hand, critics praised the Thunderdome scene in particular; film critic Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times called the Thunderdome \\"the first really original movie idea about how to stage a fight since we got the first karate movies\\" and praised the fight between Max and Blaster as \\"one of the great creative action scenes in the movies\\". Ebert awarded the film 4 stars out of 4 and later placed the film on his list of the 10 best pictures of 1985.Ebert's 10 Best Lists: 1967-present via the Internet Archive. Chicago Sun-Times. Retrieved 11 May 2013. Variety wrote that the film \\"opens strong\\" and has good acting from Gibson, Turner, and the children. Despite mostly positive reviews from critics, some fans of the series have criticised the film for being \\"Hollywood-ized\\" and having a lighter tone than its predecessors. The film holds an 80% rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 49 reviews with an average rating of 6.43/10. The website's consensus reads, \\"Beyond Thunderdome deepens the Mad Max character without sacrificing the amazing vehicle choreography and stunts that made the originals memorable\\". =Legacy= As with the previous installments of the Mad Max series, Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome has influenced popular culture in various regards. The term \\"thunderdome\\" is now used in various contexts in which its meaning is similar to the sense in which it appears in the film, a contest where the loser suffers a great hardship. American filmmaker Chris Weitz has cited the film as an influence.

Early life  Garc√≠a Granados was born in Puerto de Santa Mar√≠a, Spain. As a young adolescent, he was brought to Central America. He was a member of a wealthy military family. At age twenty- three, Granados visited South America, Europe and the cities of New York and Philadelphia in the US. He completed his schooling in London.Guatemalan Military Museum: Miguel Garc√≠a Granados Reviewed on August 7th 2014. He was the brother of Guatemalan writer Mar√≠a Josefa Garc√≠a Granados.  Career  Garc√≠a Granados was known as a moderate liberal. He compromised with Rafael Carrera, and attempted to get along with his successor Vicente Cerna. Sympathetic with the revolt against the government, Garc√≠a Granados fled to exile and was supported by Guatemalan liberals. After returning to Guatemala, Garc√≠a Granados became the leader of the revolution against Cerna, eventually becoming known as its philosopher. Garc√≠a Granados played a key part in the regime of Justo Rufino Barrios, the founder of \\"the army of 45 men\\". He served as a provisional president from 1871 to 1873 after the liberal victory of Guatemala City. Garc√≠a Granados wanted to regularize the government by constructing a lawful regime. In 1872, Guatemala invaded Honduras, where Garc√≠a Granados decreed freedom of the press and expelled the Jesuits. Garc√≠a Granados and his successor Barrios support multiple liberal revolts. During his presidency, Garc√≠a Granados created the Guatemalan flag by decree, which remains almost identical to his 1871 version. Garcia Granados supported education and the arts. In 1871 he invited Italian conductor Pietro Visoni to stay in Guatemala and become the director of the main military band. Visoni later founded the Martial Symphony Band and the School of Substitutes (Escuela de Substitutos), the first formal music conservatory in Central America. After Garc√≠a Granados stepped down, Barrios served as president until the mid-1870s.  Retirement  Garc√≠a Granados retired from public life to write articles for Guatemalan magazines and newspapers; accounts of the time when he was the leader of the liberal forces and as president; an essay about monetary policy and two volumes of memoirs. Garc√≠a Granados Monument. Located on Avenida La Reforma, in front of the old Guatemalan Military School. In 1877, he arrived in Guatemala Jos√© Mart√≠, who started teaching in the just founded Instituto Nacional Central para Varones and Escuela Normal para Varones. In those days, the high schools' faculty included Spaniard politician Valero Pujol, German engineer Edwin Rockstroh and Cuban poet Jos√© Joaqu√≠n Palma, who used to gather for intellectual conversations. In one of those meetings, Mart√≠ met Mar√≠a Garc√≠a Granados y Sabor√≠o, general Garc√≠a Granados' daughter. Despite his engagement to a Cuban woman, Mart√≠ started visiting the Garcia Granados residency, where he frequently played chess with the general and paid his respects to Mar√≠a. Mar√≠a fell in love with Mart√≠, but after a sudden trip to Mexico in early 1878, came back to Guatemala already married. A few weeks after Marti left for good, Mar√≠a died, followed shortly thereafter by her father. In 1891, Mart√≠ wrote a poem in her memory, named La Ni√±a de Guatemala,The Girl from Guatemala. in which he implies that she died from love.  Death  Garcia Granados died on September 8, 1878 at age 69. Garcia Granaods was laid to rest in the old San Juan de Dios Cemetery.That cemetery was located where the San Juan de Dios Hospital in downtown Guatemala City stands today. In 1894, his remains were transferred to a monument erected in his honor at the new General Cemetery. His portrait appears on the 10 Quetzales bank note.

Turner would retain the name of the band throughout his career, although the group has undergone considerable line-up changes over time. The group was an offshoot of a large big band ensemble called \\"The Tophatters.\\" By the late 1940s Turner had renamed this group the \\"Kings of Rhythm.\\" Their early stage performances consisted largely of covers of popular jukebox hits of the day. In 1951, Turner and his Kings of Rhythm recorded the song \\"Rocket 88\\" (credited to Jackie Brenston and His Delta Cats),\\" which is a contender for the first rock and roll record. The song is inducted into the Blues Hall of Fame, the Grammy Hall of Fame, and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Singles. In the 1960s, the Kings of Rhythm became the band for the Ike & Tina Turner Revue. For a few years in the early 1970s they were renamed the Family Vibes, and released two albums under that name. After the disbanding of the Ike & Tina Turner Revue in 1976, Turner revived the Kings of Rhythm in 2001 and released the Grammy-nominated album Here And Now. The Kings of Rhythm backed Turner on his Grammy-winning album Risin' With The Blues (2006). After Turner died in 2007, the band for some time was under the leadership of pianist Ernest Lane, who was a childhood friend of Turner's. The Kings of Rhythm continue to perform with vocalist Earl Thomas. Career =Formation: The Tophatters= In high school, a teenage Ike Turner joined a huge local rhythm ensemble called \\"The Tophatters\\", who played dances around Clarksdale, Mississippi, playing big band arrangements from sheet music. Members of the band were taken from Clarksdale musicians, and included Turner's school friends Raymond Hill, Eugene Fox and Clayton Love. At one point the Tophatters had over 30 members, and eventually split into two, with one act who wanted to carry on playing dance band jazz calling themselves \\"The Dukes of Swing\\" and the other, led by Turner becoming the \\"Kings of Rhythm\\". Rivalry between the two former factions of the Tophatters lasted for some time, with the two staging an open air 'battle-of-the-bands' where they played from atop two flatbed trucks every fortnight. =1940s: Early years= The Kings of Rhythm had a regular Wednesday night residency at Clarksdale's Harlem Theater. This got them bookings around the Mississippi Delta region. Their early stage performances consisted largely of covers of popular jukebox hits. In March 1951 whilst driving between gigs, the Kings of Rhythm dropped in on a B.B. King club date in Chambers, Mississippi. Turner persuaded King to let the band sit in and play a number with him. King contests this, remembering that it was only Turner who sat in with his band. They were well received and the club owner booked them for a weekend residency, whilst King recommended them to Sam Philips at Sun Studios in Memphis, Tennessee. In the 50s, The Kings received regular airplay from live sessions on Clarksdale radio station WROX-AM, at the behest of DJ Early Wright. The band would sometimes play a session that lasted an hour. =1951: \\"Rocket 88\\"= Sam Phillips invited the Kings of Rhythm down to Memphis to record at Sun Studios, and the group had to devise an original song at short notice for the session. The saxophonist, Jackie Brenston, suggested a song about the new Rocket 88 Oldsmobile. Turner worked out the arrangement and the piano introduction and the band collaborated on the rest with Brenston on vocals. \\"Rocket 88\\" came out with the group erroneously credited as Jackie Brenston and his Delta Cats, instead of Ike Turner and his Kings of Rhythm featuring Jackie Brenston. The single went on to sell half a million copies, reaching the top of the Billboard R&B; charts in June 1951. The success of the record caused divisions within the group, with Brenston believing he was now the star and should front the group, and Turner and Raymond Hill bitter that they had received little recognition or recompense for writing and recording a hit record. Turner and the band were only paid $20 each for the record,\\"Ike Turner.\\" Unsung. Exec. Prod. Frank Sinton, Arthur Smith, Kent Weed, and Mark Rowland. Nar. Gary Anthony Williams. TV One, 17. Dec. 2012. Television. with the exception of Brenston who sold the rights to Phillips for $910. The group's regular singer, Johnny O'Neal, had left prior to the recording of \\"Rocket 88\\" to sign a contract with King Records, but Turner still refused to allow Brenston to take over as singer. Following the success of the record, Brenston was convinced he was the star of the group and left to pursue a solo career. This caused the group to fall apart with some members backing Brenston on the road. However Turner held onto the name and soon reformed the Kings of Rhythm with a new line-up. = 1952‚Äì1954: Sun/Modern Records = Between 1952 and 1954, Turner became a session musician and production assistant for Sam Philips at Sun Records and the Bihari brothers at Modern/RPM Records. Turner was also a freelance talent scout, and used the Kings of Rhythm as session musicians. They played on many recording for the Biharis Modern, RPM, and Flair labels. Turner's wife Bonnie Turner was a pianist and vocalist in his new line-up. They released the record, \\"My Heart Belongs To You\\" / \\"Looking for My Baby\\" from RPM in 1952. The Kings of Rhythm which included Bonnie Turner, Raymond Hill, Billy \\"The Kid\\" Emerson and Johnny O'Neal recorded for Sun in 1953 and 1954. Some of the recordings remained unissued until Charly Records released of Sun: The Roots Of Rock: Volume 3: Delta Rhythm Kings in 1976. Turner and the Kings of Rhythm last recorded for Sun in 1958 with Tommy Hodge, by then, Phillips had shifted his focus onto rockabilly music and wasn't recording many black musicians anymore. = 1954‚Äì1962: St. Louis = In late 1954, Turner took the reformed version of Kings of Rhythm north to East St. Louis, which included Kizart, Sims, O'Neal, Jessie Knight, Jr. and Turner's then wife Annie Mae Wilson on piano and vocals. Around this time, Turner moved over to playing guitar to accommodate Wilson, taking lessons from Willie Kizart to improve. Turner maintained strict discipline over the band, insisting they lived in a large house with him so he could conduct early morning rehearsals at a moment's notice. He would fire anyone he suspected of drinking or taking drugs, and would fine or physically assault band-members if they played a wrong note. He controlled everything from the arrangements down to the suits the band wore onstage. Starting off playing at a club called Kingsbury's in Madison, Illinois, within a year Turner had built up a full gig schedule, establishing his group as one of the most highly rated on the St. Louis club circuit, vying for popularity with their only real competition, Sir John's Trio featuring Chuck Berry. The bands would play all-nighters in St. Louis, then cross the river to the clubs of East St. Louis, and continue playing until dawn. In St. Louis for the first time Turner and the band were exposed to a developing white teenage audience who were excited by R&B.; Clubs they played in St. Louis included Club Imperial, which was popular with white teenagers, The Dynaflow, The Moonlight Lounge, Club Riviera and the West End Walters. In East St. Louis, the group would play at Kingsbury's, Manhattan Club and The Sportsman. In between live dates, Turner took the band to Cincinnati to record for Federal in 1956. The session produced the regional hit \\"I'm Tore Up,\\" featuring lead vocalist Billy Gayles. In 1958, the band recorded for Cobra/Artistic in Chicago. He befriended St. Louis R&B; fan Bill Stevens, who in 1959 set up the short-lived record label, Stevens Records, financed by his father Fred. Turner recorded numerous sessions for Stevens with various vocalists and musician lineups of the Kings of Rhythm, of which seven singles were released (these are collected on the Red Lightnin' compilation Hey Hey (RL0047). None of the Stevens records had wide distribution and the operation ceased after a year. In addition the band appeared on local television shows. They toured the \\"Chitlin' Circuit\\" of black southern clubs for many years. = 1960‚Äì1976: The Ike & Tina Turner Revue = After the addition of his future wife Little Ann (Tina Turner) as lead singer, Turner formed the Ike & Tina Turner Revue. The creation of the revue was in a large part the birth of the soul revues of the 1960s. The Kings of Rhythm and Tina were joined on stage by the Ikettes who contributed backing vocals and choreographed dance moves. As backing band to the duo, the band played on many substantial soul hits, including the million sellers \\"A Fool In Love\\" (1960) and \\"It's Gonna Work Out Fine\\"(1961) both for Sue Records. Also included in the revue were male singers Stacy Johnson, Vernon Guy, Jimmy Thomas and Bobby John. Turner moved the revue to California in 1962. In the mid-1960s Jimi Hendrix briefly played backing guitar in the band. Turner fired him because his guitar solos became \\"so elaborate they overstepped the bounds.\\" In 1964, the band released the single \\"Getting Nasty\\" / \\"Nutting Up\\" under the alias Nasty Minds on Turner's Sonja label. The Ike & Tina Turner Revue was featured in the 1966 concert film The Big T.N.T. Show. The lineup for that performance was Turner and Herb Sadler on guitar, James Norwood on drums, Sam Rhodes on bass and Ernest Lane on piano. In 1971, the Kings of Rhythm were renamed Family Vibes. They released two albums under that name, Strange Fruit (1972) and Confined to Soul (1973), both produced by Turner. The Ike & Tina Turner Revue disbanded in 1976 following an altercation between the Turners. = 1986‚Äì1987: St. Louis Kings of Rhythm = In 1986, a revival of the King of Rhythm consisting of several veteran members toured Europe as the St. Louis Kings Of Rhythm. The tour extended into 1987, and an album titled St. Louis Kings Of Rhythm was released on Timeless Records in Europe. Mayor Vincent Schoemehl officially appointed the St. Louis Kings Of Rhythm ambassadors for the City of St. Louis. = 2001‚Äìpresent: Reformation = In the late 1990s Turner toured with Joe Louis Walker, the positive response to the tour encouraged him to reform the Kings of Rhythm. The King of Rhythm toured the U.S. in 2001 and headlined a showcase at South by Southwest where they were hailed as one of the highlights of the conference. This led to the recording and release of the Grammy-nominated album Here And Now (2001) by Turner and the Kings of Rhythm. The album won two W.C. Handy Awards, the Blues Foundation's equivalent of the Grammy Awards, for Best Traditional Blues Album and Comeback Album of the Year in 2002. They received positive reviews for their performances at various music festivals, including Montreux Jazz Festival (2002), North Sea Jazz Festival (2002), and Jazz √† Vienne (2004). The Kings of Rhythm backed Turner on his Grammy-winning album Risin' With The Blues (2006). After Turner died in December 2007, the band was temporarily under the leadership of pianist Ernest Lane (1931‚Äì2012), a childhood friend of Turner's. The band performed Turner's classic songs at his funeral. Since 2008, the band has performed with vocalist Earl Thomas. Thomas became a fan of Ike & Tina Turner after watching the film Soul To Soul (1971) as a child. He met Turner in 2004 and remained in contact with him until his death.  Legacy  By some accounts, \\"Rocket 88\\" is considered the first rock and roll record. Speaking on \\"Rocket 88\\" being a contender for the first rock 'n' roll record, broadcaster Paul Gambaccini said: > In musical terms [he was] very important. \\"Rocket 88\\" is one of the two > records that can claim to be the first rock 'n' roll record, the other being > \\"The Fat Man\\" by Fats Domino from 1949. But \\"Rocket 88\\" does have a couple > of elements which \\"The Fat Man\\" did not. The wailing saxophone and that > distorted electric guitar. It was number one in the rhythm and blues chart > for five weeks, it's in the Grammy Hall of Fame and it was an indisputable > claim to fame for Ike Turner, even though his lead singer and saxophonist, > Jackie Brenston, got the label credit. = Awards = \\"Rocket 88\\" was inducted into the Blues Hall of Fame in 1991, the Grammy Hall of Fame in 1998, and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Singles in 2018.

She was a professor of psychology at McMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada, noted for her pioneering work in the field of evolutionary psychology and her contributions to the study of violence. Biography Wilson was born on October 1, 1942, in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada. She spent her childhood years in the Gwich'in community of Fort McPherson, where her mother, a nurse, provided medical services. She attended the University of Alberta, graduating with an undergraduate degree in psychology in 1964. She then studied behavioural endocrinology at the University of California and, after winning the a Commonwealth Scholarship, at University College London, England, where she earned her PhD in 1972. From 1972 through 1975, she was a visiting assistant professor at the University of Toronto, where she met her future husband, fellow psychologist Martin Daly. Together, they moved to Hamilton in 1978 after Daly was hired by McMaster University. In the 1980s, Wilson was appointed professor of Psychology at McMaster, where she remained for the rest of her career. Wilson was elected president of the Human Behavior and Evolution Society in 1997. With Daly, she was, for 10 years, the editor-in- chief of the journal Evolution and Human Behavior,. In 1998, she was named a fellow of the Royal Society. Wilson died in Hamilton on September 24, 2009, of cancer. In 2009, the Human Behavior and Evolution Society established the Margo Wilson Award (for best paper published in the previous year) to honour her contributions to the field.  Research  In 1978, Wilson proposed the idea to Daly that they could analyze patterns of homicide to better understand humans' social behaviours from an evolutionary perspective. For the next 30 years, Wilson and Daly collaborated on this research, authoring several books and over 100 academic papers and book chapters in this area.\\"Margo Wilson's research shed light on evolutionary psychology\\" by Julia Belluz, The Globe and Mail, October 1, 2009 Their first book on this topic, Homicide (1988), has been described as a \\"founding\\" and \\"classic\\" text for the field of evolutionary psychology.

Biography Son of Thomas Shenstone and Anne Penn, daughter of William Penn of Harborough Hall, then in Hagley (now Blakedown), Shenstone was born at the Leasowes, Halesowen on 18 November 1714. At that time this was an exclave of Shropshire within the county of Worcestershire and now in the West Midlands. Shenstone received part of his formal education at Halesowen Grammar School (now The Earls High School). In 1741, Shenstone became bailiff to the feoffees of Halesowen Grammar School. While attending Solihull School, he began a lifelong friendship with Richard Jago. He went up to Pembroke College, Oxford in 1732 and made another firm friend there in Richard Graves, the author of The Spiritual Quixote. Shenstone took no degree, but, while still at Oxford, he published Poems on various occasions, written for the entertainment of the author (1737). This edition was intended for private circulation only but, containing the first draft of The Schoolmistress, it attracted some wider attention. Shenstone tried hard to suppress it but in 1742 he published anonymously a revised draft of The Schoolmistress, a Poem in imitation of Spenser. The inspiration of the poem was Sarah Lloyd, teacher of the village school where Shenstone received his first education. Isaac D'Israeli contended that Robert Dodsley had been misled in publishing it as one of a sequence of Moral Poems, its intention having been satirical, as evidenced by the ludicrous index appended to its original publication. The view from the ruined Halesowen Priory towards The Leasowes (on the crest of the hill on the right). In 1741 he published The Judgment of Hercules. He inherited the Leasowes estate, and retired there in 1745 to undertake what proved the chief work of his life, the beautifying of his property. He embarked on elaborate schemes of landscape gardening which gave The Leasowes a wide celebrity (see ferme orn√©e), but sadly impoverished the owner. Shenstone was not a contented recluse. He desired constant admiration of his gardens, and he never ceased to lament his lack of fame as a poet. In 1759, Shenstone made the acquaintance of James Woodhouse, a shoe-maker from nearby Rowley Regis who had started writing poetry. Shenstone encouraged Woodhouse's literary efforts, allowing him access to the library at the Leasowes and including one of Woodhouse's works in a collection of poems published in 1762. Shenstone died unmarried on 11 February 1763. Critical appraisal Shenstone's poems of nature were written in praise of his most artificial aspects, but the emotions they express were obviously genuine. His Schoolmistress was admired by Oliver Goldsmith, with whom Shenstone had much in common, and his Elegies written at various times and to some extent biographical in character won the praise of Robert Burns who, in the preface to Poems, chiefly in the Scottish Dialect (1786), called him ... that celebrated poet whose divine elegies do honour to our language, our nation and our species. The best example of purely technical skill in his works is perhaps his success in the management of the anapaestic trimeter in his Pastoral Ballad in Four Parts (written in 1743), but first printed in Dodsley's Collection of Poems (vol. iv., 1755). Arthur Schopenhauer mentioned Shenstone in his discussion of equivocation. \\"[C]oncepts\\", Schopenhauer asserted, \\"which in and by themselves contain nothing improper, yet the actual case brought under them leads to an improper conception\\" are called equivocations. He continued: Bibliography Shenstone's works were first published by his friend Robert Dodsley (3 vols., 1764‚Äì1769). The second volume contains Dodsley's description of the Leasowes. The last, consisting of correspondence with Graves, Jago and others, appeared after Dodsley's death. Other letters of Shenstone's are included in Select Letters (ed. Thomas Hill 1778). The letters of Lady Luxborough (n√©e Henrietta St John) to Shenstone were printed by T. Dodsley in 1775; much additional correspondence is preserved in the British Museum letters to Lady Luxborough (Add. MS. 28958), Dodsley's letters to Shenstone (Add. MS. 28959), and correspondence between Shenstone and Bishop Percy from 1757 to 1763 the last being of especial interest; To Shenstone was due the original suggestion of Percy's Reliques, a service which would alone entitle him to a place among the precursors of the romantic movement in English literature. In a letter written in 1741 Shenstone became the first person to record the use of \\"floccinaucinihilipilification\\". In the first edition of the Oxford English Dictionary this was recognised as the longest word in the English language.

In recent years they have doubled as more influential political roles while retaining the ceremonial functions. A mayor's term of office denotes the municipal year. The most famous example is that of the Lord Mayor of the City of London. Traditionally mayors and provosts have been elected by town, borough and city councils. Since 2000, several districts now have directly elected mayors with extensive powers. See borough status in the United Kingdom for a list of English districts to have a borough charter (and therefore a mayor). The role of the chairman of a district council is exactly the same as the mayor of a borough council, and they have the same status as first citizen, after the Sovereign, in their district, but they are not addressed as mayor. Election In England, where a borough or a city is a local government district or a civil parish, the mayor is elected annually by the council from their number and chairs meetings of the council with a casting vote. Where the mayoralty used to be associated with a local government district but that district has been abolished, Charter Trustees may be set up to provide continuity until a parish council may be set up. Where a parish council (whether the successor of a former borough or not) has resolved to style itself a Town Council, then its chairman is entitled to the designation Town Mayor, though in practice, the word Town is often dropped. =Direct election= In 2000 the Labour government led by Tony Blair passed a local government reform which changed this system somewhat. Several districts in England now have directly elected mayors with real powers and an advisory cabinet to assist them. Also since 2000, the area of Greater London has had a Greater London Authority headed by the Mayor of London. This is a separate post to the historic and honorific Lord Mayor of London and may be characterised as a strategic, regional, role rather than as anything analogous to previous local government in England. Lord Mayors The right to appoint a Lord Mayor is a rare honour, even less frequently bestowed than city status. Currently, 23 cities in England have Lord Mayors: * Birmingham * Bradford * Bristol * Canterbury * Chester * Coventry * Exeter * Kingston upon Hull * Leeds * Leicester * Liverpool * London * Manchester * Newcastle upon Tyne * Norwich * Nottingham * Oxford * Plymouth * Portsmouth * Sheffield * Stoke-on-Trent * City of Westminster * York. Honorifics The Lord Mayors of London and York are styled The Right Honourable, Bristol also uses the honorific although without official sanction. All other Lord Mayors, as well as the Mayors of cities and the original Cinque Ports (Sandwich, Hythe, Dover, Romney and Hastings, are styled The Right Worshipful. All other Mayors are styled The Worshipful, though this is in practice seldom used for a Town Mayor. These honorific styles are used only before the Mayoral title and not before the name, and are not retained after the term of office. A mayor can also be styled Mr Mayor and usually appoints a consort, usually a spouse, other family member or fellow councillor. In England (and the Commonwealth) the designated female consort of a mayor is usually styled Mayoress or occasionally Mrs Mayor and accompanies the mayor to civic functions. A female mayor is also called mayor, not, as sometimes erroneously called, \\"Lady Mayoress\\". A mayoress or Lady Mayoress is a female consort of a mayor or Lord Mayor; a male consort of a mayor or Lord Mayor is a Mayor's Consort or Lord Mayor's Consort. The Lord Mayor of Bristol uses the prefix without official sanction.The Title of Lord Mayor ‚Äì Use of the Prefix \\"Right Honourable\\", The Times, 7 July 1932, p.16 See also *Local government in England *Municipal year References External links *BBC article *New Local Government Network *English city and regional mayors 2017 Local government in the United Kingdom Ceremonial officers in the United Kingdom ","title":"Mayors in England"},{"id":"598896","text":"The Daman and Diu Portuguese Creole, also known as Daman and Diu Indo- Portuguese and, to its speakers, as ' (Portuguese for \\"Home language\\"), refers to varieties of Portuguese-based creole spoken in Daman and Diu. Before the Indian annexation of the territory, the Daman creole went through a profound decreolization by Standard Portuguese of Goa, a phenomenon whereby the Indo- Portuguese creole reconverged with Standard Portuguese. Daman Indo- Portuguese The Daman creole is a descendant of the Norteiro creole, spoken originally by the Norteiros on the Coast from Chaul, Ba√ßaim, Bombay, Daman and Diu. The superstrate language is Portuguese. The substrate of the Daman creole is likely to be Konkani. Gujarati has also been suggested as a possible substrate, but this is doubtful since the Gujarati people moved into the region only after the Portuguese arrived. Diu Indo-Portuguese The Diu Indo-Portuguese or Diu Portuguese is spoken in Diu, India. It is a creole language based mainly on Portuguese and Gujarati. It is a member of the larger family of Indo-Portuguese creoles, particularly close to the variety of Daman. There is a considerably vital oral tradition in this language, with songs regularly performed in Diu, elsewhere in India and among Indo-Portuguese communities abroad. Widely spoken in the past, it was first documented in the 19th century by the initiative of Hugo Schuchardt. At present, the language is spoken natively by most of the local Catholics, numbering about 180, but is potentially endangered by the pressure of other languages such as Gujarati, English and standard Portuguese. Number of speakers The Portuguese heritage in Daman is more common and lively than in Goa and this helped to keep the language alive. The language is spoken by an estimated number of 2,000 Damanese. However, the Damanese Portuguese-Indian Association says that there are 10- 12,000 Portuguese speakers in the territory of 110,000 residents. Sunday Mass is celebrated in Portuguese.

Early life Carstares was born at Cathcart, near Glasgow, Scotland, the son of the Rev. John Carstares, a Covenanter. He was educated at the University of Edinburgh, and then at the University of Utrecht. In the Netherlands he had an introduction to Gaspar Fagel. Through Fagel he met the Prince of Orange, the future King William III of Great Britain, and began to take an active part in politics. During the Third Anglo-Dutch War, Carstares acted as an intelligence agent for the Prince of Orange, making journeys to England as \\"William Williams\\". He corresponded with Pierre du Moulin (died 1676), who ran the Prince's espionage. He was suspected by the English, and arrested by warrant in September 1674 on English soil. 1674 to 1689 Carstares was then committed to the Tower of London; the following year, 1675, he was transferred to Edinburgh Castle. He was believed to be concerned with Sir James Stewart in the authorship of a pamphlet An Account of Scotland's Grievances by reason of the D. of Lauderdale's Ministrie, humbly tendered to his Sacred Majesty (1674). John Maitland, 1st Duke of Lauderdale himself got Carstares to admit he had been involved in printing the pamphlet. Lauderdale used the threat of the torture of the boot, which could be employed legally in Scotland; but Carstares was not tortured. In August 1679 he was released, one of the government sops to Scottish opinion after the Battle of Bothwell Bridge. He cannot therefore have been the William Carstares who was the chief prosecution witness at the trial of William Staley (the first of the Popish Plot trials) in November 1678, although that Carstares was also a Scotsman, and like his namesake is said to have acted as an intelligence agent. After this, Carstares visited Ireland, joined nonconformist circles in London, and then in 1681 became pastor to a congregation at Theobalds, near Cheshunt in Hertfordshire. The aftermath of the Exclusion Crisis saw him directly involved in conspiracy with the Whig faction. Archibald Campbell, 9th Earl of Argyll in the Netherlands was in touch with Anthony Ashley Cooper, 1st Earl of Shaftesbury. Carstares provided liaison, while his brother-in-law William Dunlop was able to use his colonial project in the Province of Carolina as cover for Shaftesbury's preparations for rebellion. During 1682 Carstares was in the Netherlands, but the following year he was again in London. He was implicated in the Rye House Plot, and arrested in July 1683 at Tenterden, Kent, using an assumed name. He denied knowing any of the plot, though he had heard assassination rumours from Robert Ferguson. He was again threatened with torture in London, this time by Sir George Mackenzie. Once more he was transferred to Edinburgh. In July 1684 the Privy Council of Scotland tortured William Spence, Argyll's agent, and Carstares was implicated. Carstares himself, who had seen poor health in his detention, was tortured in September, with the thumbikins, and then the boot, clumsily applied. The next day John Drummond, Secretary of State in Scotland, made a deal with Carstares that his answers would not be used in court, and had a doctor see him. Carstares then replied to the questions of the Council. He signed a statement, managing to conceal the covert links to Dutch supporters, and the government published it. Later that month he was moved to Stirling Castle. In the trial of Baillie of Jerviswood, Mackenzie as Lord Advocate found a way to use the statement by Carstares to secure a conviction; Baillie was hanged, drawn and quartered in December 1684. Carstares was freed, and went to London, and then to The Hague shortly before the Monmouth Rebellion, as an adviser to the Prince of Orange. Under William III Carstares was court chaplain to William as Prince of Orange, and at the time of the Williamite Revolution sailed with the Prince to Torbay. He continued as royal chaplain for Scotland, once William was king in Great Britain. He was the confidential adviser of the king, especially with regard to Scottish affairs. He advocated that a Presbyterian polity should replace the Scottish bishops, and the immediate events of the Williamite conflicts bore out his opinion in practical terms. His subsequent influence on matters concerning the Kirk, as a courtier, earned him the nickname \\"Cardinal Carstares\\". He also manipulated the Parliament of Scotland, helped by being able to read James Johnston's mail. He was Queenberry's man at court in 1700. Later life On the accession of Queen Anne, Carstares retained his post as royal chaplain, but resided in Edinburgh, having been elected principal of the University of Edinburgh in 1703. He was a reforming administrator, introducing the Dutch professorial system of teaching He was also minister of Greyfriars Kirk, and afterwards of St Giles'. He was four times chosen Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland, in 1705, 1708, 1711 and 1715.John Warrick, The Moderators of the Church of Scotland from 1690 to 1740 (1913), p. 158; archive.org. He took an important part in promoting the Union, and was consulted by Harley and other leading Englishmen concerning it. During Anne's reign, the chief object of his policy was to frustrate the measures which were planned by Lord Oxford to strengthen the Episcopalian Jacobites, especially a bill for extending the privileges of the Episcopalians and the bill for replacing in the hands of the old patrons the right of patronage, which by the Revolution Settlement had been vested in the elders and the Protestant heritors. On the accession of George I, Carstares was appointed, with five others, to welcome the new dynasty in the name of the Church of Scotland. He was received graciously, and the office of royal chaplain was again conferred upon him. A few months after he was struck with apoplexy, and died on 28 December 1715. He is buried at Greyfriars Kirkyard, Edinburgh. The grave lies amongst the large monuments on the outer walls of the original churchyard, towards the south-west, slightly north-west of the Adam mausoleum.

Spaceflight Frimout flew as a payload specialist on STS-45 Atlantis (24 March to 2 April 1992). STS-45 was launched from and returned to land at the Kennedy Space Center, Florida. It was the first Spacelab mission dedicated to NASA's Mission to Planet Earth. During the nine-day flight, the crew aboard Atlantis operated the twelve experiments that constituted the ATLAS-1 (Atmospheric Laboratory for Applications and Science) cargo. ATLAS-1 obtained a vast array of detailed measurements of atmospheric chemical and physical properties, which contributed significantly to improving our understanding of our climate and atmosphere. In addition, this was the first time an artificial beam of electrons was used to stimulate a man-made auroral discharge. At mission conclusion, Frimout had traveled 3.2 million miles in 143 Earth orbits and logged over 214 hours in space. =Frimout-mania= His flight made him instantaneously very famous in Belgium and triggered what was called Frimout- mania. Prince Philippe of Belgium talked with him when he was in space and a ticker tape parade was organized when he came back to Belgium.

Run-time type information can apply to simple data types, such as integers and characters, or to generic types. This is a C++ specialization of a more general concept called type introspection. Similar mechanisms are also known in other programming languages, such as Object Pascal (Delphi). In the original C++ design, Bjarne Stroustrup did not include run-time type information, because he thought this mechanism was often misused. Overview In C++, RTTI can be used to do safe typecasts, using the \`dynamic_cast<>\` operator, and to manipulate type information at runtime, using the \`typeid\` operator and \`std::type_info\` class. RTTI is available only for classes that are polymorphic, which means they have at least one virtual method. In practice, this is not a limitation because base classes must have a virtual destructor to allow objects of derived classes to perform proper cleanup if they are deleted from a base pointer. RTTI is optional with some compilers; the programmer can choose at compile time whether to include the functionality. There may be a resource cost to making RTTI available even if a program does not use it. typeid The \`typeid\` keyword is used to determine the class of an object at run time. It returns a reference to \`std::type_info\` object, which exists until the end of the program.C++ standard (ISO/IEC14882) section 5.2.8 [expr.typeid], 18.5.1 [lib.type.info] -- http://cs.nyu.edu/courses/fall11/CSCI-GA.2110-003/documents/c++2003std.pdf The use of \`typeid\`, in a non-polymorphic context, is often preferred over \`dynamic_cast\` in situations where just the class information is needed, because \`typeid\` is always a constant-time procedure, whereas \`dynamic_cast\` may need to traverse the class derivation lattice of its argument at runtime. Some aspects of the returned object are implementation-defined, such as \`std::type_info::name()\`, and cannot be relied on across compilers to be consistent. Objects of class \`std::bad_typeid\` are thrown when the expression for \`typeid\` is the result of applying the unary * operator on a null pointer. Whether an exception is thrown for other null reference arguments is implementation-dependent. In other words, for the exception to be guaranteed, the expression must take the form \`typeid(*p)\` where \`p\` is any expression resulting in a null pointer. =Example= #include #include class Person { public: virtual ~Person() = default; }; class Employee : public Person {}; int main() { Person person; Employee employee; Person* ptr = &employee; Person& ref = employee; // The string returned by typeid::name is implementation- defined. std::cout << typeid(person).name() << std::endl; // Person (statically known at compile-time). std::cout << typeid(employee).name() << std::endl; // Employee (statically known at compile-time). std::cout << typeid(ptr).name() << std::endl; // Person* (statically known at compile- time). std::cout << typeid(*ptr).name() << std::endl; // Employee (looked up dynamically at run-time // because it is the dereference of a // pointer to a polymorphic class). std::cout << typeid(ref).name() << std::endl; // Employee (references can also be polymorphic) Person* p = nullptr; try { typeid(*p); // Not undefined behavior; throws std::bad_typeid. } catch (...) { } Person& p_ref = *p; // Undefined behavior: dereferencing null typeid(p_ref); // does not meet requirements to throw std::bad_typeid // because the expression for typeid is not the result // of applying the unary * operator. } Output (exact output varies by system and compiler): Person Employee Person* Employee Employee dynamic_cast and Java cast The \`dynamic_cast\` operator in C++ is used for downcasting a reference or pointer to a more specific type in the class hierarchy. Unlike the \`static_cast\`, the target of the \`dynamic_cast\` must be a pointer or reference to class. Unlike \`static_cast\` and C-style typecast (where type check is made during compilation), a type safety check is performed at runtime. If the types are not compatible, an exception will be thrown (when dealing with references) or a null pointer will be returned (when dealing with pointers). A Java typecast behaves similarly; if the object being cast is not actually an instance of the target type, and cannot be converted to one by a language-defined method, an instance of \`java.lang.ClassCastException\` will be thrown.http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/ClassCastException.html =Example= Suppose some function takes an object of type \`A\` as its argument, and wishes to perform some additional operation if the object passed is an instance of \`B\`, a subclass of \`A\`. This can be accomplished using \`dynamic_cast\` as follows. #include #include #include #include using namespace std; class A { public: // Since RTTI is included in the virtual method table there should be at // least one virtual function. virtual ~A() = default; void MethodSpecificToA() { cout << \\"Method specific for A was invoked\\" << endl; } }; class B: public A { public: void MethodSpecificToB() { cout << \\"Method specific for B was invoked\\" << endl; } }; void MyFunction(A& my_a) { try { // Cast will be successful only for B type objects. B& my_b = dynamic_cast(my_a); my_b.MethodSpecificToB(); } catch (const bad_cast& e) { cerr << \\" Exception \\" << e.what() << \\" thrown.\\" << endl; cerr << \\" Object is not of type B\\" << endl; } } int main() { array, 3> array_of_a; // Array of pointers to base class A. array_of_a[0] = make_unique **(); // Pointer to B object. array_of_a[1] = make_unique **(); // Pointer to B object. array_of_a[2] = make_unique(); // Pointer to A object. for (int i = 0; i < 3; ++i) MyFunction(*array_of_a[i]); } Console output: Method specific for B was invoked Method specific for B was invoked Exception std::bad_cast thrown. Object is not of type B A similar version of \`MyFunction\` can be written with pointers instead of references: void MyFunction(A* my_a) { B* my_b = dynamic_cast(my_a); if (my_b != nullptr) my_b->methodSpecificToB(); else std::cerr << \\" Object is not B type\\" << std::endl; } See also * Type inference * Type introspection * typeof * Reflection (computer science) * Template (C++) References External links * \`dynamic_cast\` operator at IBM Mac OS X Compilers * \`dynamic_cast\` operator at MSDN Articles with example C++ code C++ Class (computer programming) Data types ","title":"Run-time type information"},{"id":"598917","text":"Francis Andrew \\"Drew\\" Gaffney is an American doctor.

Gemar's biography NASA experience Selected by NASA in June 1985, Gemar completed a one-year training and evaluation program and became an astronaut in July 1986. He is qualified for assignment as a Mission Specialist on future Space Shuttle flight crews. Since then he has held a variety of technical assignments in support of the Space Shuttle Program, including flight software testing in the Shuttle Avionics Integration Laboratory (SAIL); launch support activities at the Kennedy Space Center; spacecraft communicator (CAPCOM) in mission control during Space Shuttle missions; Chief of Astronaut Appearances. Gemar has flown three times and has logged over 580 hours in space. He flew on STS-38 (November 15‚Äì20, 1990), STS-48 (September 12‚Äì18, 1991), and STS-62 (March 4‚Äì18, 1994). On his first mission, Gemar served on the five-man crew of STS-38 which launched at night from the Kennedy Space Center, Florida, on November 15, 1990. During the five- day mission crew members conducted Department of Defense operations. After 80 orbits of the Earth in 117 hours, in the first Shuttle recovery in Florida since 1985, Space Shuttle Atlantis and her crew landed back at the Kennedy Space Center on November 20, 1990. Gemar then served on the five-man crew of STS-48 aboard the Space Shuttle Discovery, which launched from the Kennedy Space Center, Florida, on September 12, 1991. During 81 orbits of the Earth, the crew successfully deployed the Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite (UARS), designed to study the Earth's upper atmosphere on a global scale thus providing scientists with their first complete data set on the upper atmosphere's chemistry, winds and energy inputs, in addition to conducting numerous secondary experiments ranging from growing protein crystals, to studying how fluids and structures react in weightlessness. This five-day mission concluded with a landing at Edwards Air Force Base, California, on September 18, 1991. Mission duration was 128 hours. Gemar's most recent mission was STS-62 aboard the Space Shuttle Columbia, which launched from the Kennedy Space Center, Florida, on March 4, 1994.

The Stars My Destination is a science fiction novel by American writer Alfred Bester. Set in the 24th or 25th century, which varies between editions of the book, when humans have colonized the Solar System, it tells the story of Gully [Gulliver] Foyle, a teleporter driven by a burning desire for revenge. Its first publication was in book form in June 1956 in the United Kingdom, where it was titled Tiger! Tiger!, named after William Blake's 1794 poem \\"The Tyger\\", the first verse of which is printed as the first page of the novel. The book remains widely known under that title in the markets in which this edition was circulated. It was subsequently serialized in Galaxy magazine in four parts beginning with the October 1956 issue. A working title was Hell's My Destination, and the book was also associated with the name The Burning Spear. Plot At the time when the book is set, \\"jaunting\\"--personal teleportation--has so upset the social and economic balance that the Inner Planets are at war with the Outer Satellites. Gully Foyle of the Presteign-owned merchant spaceship Nomad--an uneducated, unskilled, unambitious man whose life is at a dead end--is marooned in space when the ship is attacked and he alone survives. After six months of his waiting for rescue, a passing spaceship, the Vorga, also owned by the powerful Presteign industrial clan, ignores his signal and abandons him. Foyle is enraged and is transformed into a man consumed by revenge, the first of many transformations. Foyle repairs the ship, but is captured by a cargo cult in the Asteroid Belt which tattoos a hideous mask of a tiger on his face. He manages to escape and is returned to Terra. His attempt to blow up the Vorga fails, and he is captured by Presteign. Unknown to Foyle, the Nomad was carrying \\"PyrE\\", a new material which could make the difference between victory and defeat in the war. Presteign hires Saul Dagenham to interrogate Foyle and find the ship and PyrE. Protected by his own revenge fixation, Foyle cannot be broken, and he is put into a jaunte-proof prison. There he meets Jisbella McQueen, who teaches him to think clearly, and tells him he should find out who gave the order not to rescue him. Together they escape and get his tattoos removed--but not with total success: the subcutaneous scars become visible when Foyle becomes too emotional. They travel to the Nomad, where they recover not only PyrE, but also a fortune in platinum. Jisbella is captured by Dagenham, but Foyle escapes. Some time later, Foyle re-emerges as \\"Geoffrey Fourmyle\\", a nouveau riche dandy. Foyle has rigorously educated himself and had his body altered to become a killing machine. Through yoga he has achieved the emotional self-control necessary to prevent his stigmata from showing. He seeks out Robin Wednesbury, a one-way telepath, whom he had raped earlier in the novel, and persuades her to help him charm his way through high society. Foyle tracks down the crew of the Vorga to learn the identity of the ship's captain, but each is implanted with a death-reflex and dies when questioned. Each time, Foyle is tormented by the appearance of \\"The Burning Man\\", an image of himself on fire. At a society party, Foyle is smitten with Presteign's daughter Olivia. He also meets Jisbella again--now Dagenham's lover--who chooses not to reveal Foyle's identity, although Dagenham has realized it anyway (Foyle's alias was implanted in his subconscious mind during Dagenham's interrogation). During a nuclear attack by the Outer Satellites, Foyle goes to Olivia to save her. She tells him that to have her, he must be as cruel and ruthless as she is. Robin, traumatized by the attacks, tries to buy her way out of her arrangement with Foyle with the name of another Vorga crew member. Foyle agrees, but immediately reneges. In response, Robin goes to Central Intelligence to betray him. Foyle learns that the captain of the Vorga joined a cult on Mars and has had all her sensory nerves disabled, making her immune to conventional torture. Foyle kidnaps a telepath to interrogate the captain, and learns that the ship did not rescue him because it was picking up refugees, taking their belongings, and scuttling them into space. He also learns that Olivia Presteign was the person in charge. Olivia rescues him from Martian commandos, as she sees in Foyle someone who can match her hatred and need to destroy. Driven by a guilty conscience, Foyle tries to give himself up, but is captured by Presteign's lawyer Regis Sheffield, who turns out to be a spy for the Outer Satellites. Sheffield tells Foyle that when the Nomad was attacked, Foyle was taken off the ship, transported 600,000 miles away, and set adrift in a spacesuit to be a decoy to attract ships to be ambushed. Instead, Foyle space-jaunted--teleporting a cosmic distance, very much further than had been previously believed possible--back to the Nomad. Now, the Outer Satellites not only want PyrE, they want Foyle as well, to learn the secret of space-jaunting. Meanwhile, Presteign reveals that PyrE is activated by telepathy, and Robin is enlisted to trigger it to flush out Foyle. Bits of PyrE left exposed by Foyle's tests to determine its purpose cause destruction worldwide, but primarily at Foyle's abandoned encampment in St. Patrick's Cathedral, where Sheffield has brought him. The church partially collapses, killing Sheffield and trapping Foyle, unconscious but alive, over a pit of flame. Suffering from synesthesia brought on by the explosion affecting his neurological implants, Foyle jauntes through space and time as The Burning Man. Finally he lands in the future, where Robin telepathically tells him how to escape from the collapsing cathedral. Back in the present, Foyle is pressured to surrender the rest of the PyrE, which was protected from exploding by its Inert Lead Isotope container, and to teach mankind how to space-jaunte. He leads them to where the rest of the PyrE is hidden, but makes off with it and jauntes across the globe, throwing slugs of PyrE into the crowd at each stop. He asks humanity to choose: either destroy itself or follow him into space. Foyle now realizes the key to space-jaunting is faith: not the certainty of an answer, but the conviction that somewhere an answer exists. He jauntes from one nearby star to another, finding new worlds suitable for colonization, but reachable only if he shares the secret of space-jaunting. He comes to rest back with the cargo cult, where the people see him as a holy man and await his revelation. Background and influences The Stars My Destination anticipated many of the staples of the later cyberpunk movement, for instance the megacorporations as powerful as governments, a dark overall vision of the future and the cybernetic enhancement of the body. Bester added to this mix the concept that human beings could learn to teleport, or \\"jaunte\\" from point to point, provided they know the exact locations of their departure and arrival and have physically seen the destination, similar to A. E. van Vogt's Gilbert Gosseyn in the 1948 novel The World of Null-A. There is one overall absolute limit: no one can jaunte through outer space. (A jaunte of 1,000 miles is the maximum any jaunter is able to achieve, and even that is extremely rare.) On the surface of a planet, the jaunte rules supreme; otherwise, mankind is still restricted to machinery. In this world, telepathy is extremely rare, but does exist. One important character is able to send thoughts but not receive them. There are fewer than half a dozen full telepaths in all the worlds of the solar system. The novel can be seen as a science-fiction adaption of Alexandre Dumas' The Count of Monte Cristo. It is the study of a man completely lacking in imagination or ambition, Gulliver Foyle, who is introduced with \\"He was one hundred and seventy days dying and not yet dead...\\". Foyle is a cipher, a man with potential but no motivation, who is suddenly marooned in space. Even this is not enough to galvanize him beyond trying to find air and food on the wreck. But all changes when an apparent rescue ship deliberately passes him by, stirring him irrevocably out of his passivity. Foyle becomes a monomaniacal and sophisticated monster bent upon revenge. Wearing many masks, learning many skills, this \\"worthless\\" man pursues his goals relentlessly; no price is too high to pay. Like Edmond Dant√®s in The Count of Monte Cristo, Foyle is thrown into prison, the supposedly jaunte-proof \\"Gouffre Martel\\" located in caverns. He establishes a clandestine connection to another prisoner, Jisbella McQueen, and through her he is educated to the point where he can conceive a plan to escape and exact his revenge. Escaping with her and locating the wreck of the Nomad, he uses its treasure, as Dant√®s did, to re- invent himself as Geoffrey Fourmyle. The scenario of the shipwrecked man ignored by passing ships came from a National Geographic Magazine story that Bester had read, about the shipwrecked sailor Poon Lim who had survived four months on a raft in the South Atlantic during World War II, and ships had passed him without picking him up, because their captains were afraid that the raft was a decoy to lure them into torpedo range of German submarines. Bester once wrote that he used playful narration at one point to grab the reader's attention. =Terminology and allusions= The title \\"The Stars My Destination\\" appears in a quatrain quoted by Foyle twice during the book. The first time, while he is trapped in outer space, he states: :Gully Foyle is my name :And Terra is my nation. :Deep space is my dwelling place, :And death's my destination. Toward the end of the book, after he has returned to human life and become something of a hero, he states: :Gully Foyle is my name :And Terra is my nation. :Deep space is my dwelling place, :The stars my destination Both quatrains are based on a poetic form that was popular in England and the United States during the 18th-to-mid-20th centuries, in which a person stated their name, country, city or town, and a religious homily (often, \\"Heaven's my destination\\") within the rhyming four-line structure (see book rhyme). This literary device had been previously used by James Joyce in A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man. Bester may have come across his title expression in the writings of John Whiteside Parsons, one of the fathers of modern rocketry, who was also a science fiction fan and occultist. In 1943, Parsons wrote: \\"Rocketry may not be my True Will, but it's one hell of a powerful drive. With Thelema as my goal and the stars my destination and my home, I have set my eyes on high.\\"Pendle, George. Strange Angel: The Otherworldly Life of Rocket Scientist John Whiteside Parsons (Orlando, Florida: Mariner Book, 2006). p.169. Bester's initial work on the book began in England, and he took the names for his characters from a UK telephone directory. As a result, many of the characters are named after British or Irish towns or other features: Gulliver Foyle (and his pseudonym, Fourmyle of Ceres), Robin Wednesbury, the Presteign clan, Regis Sheffield, Y'ang-Yeovil, Saul Dagenham, Sam Quatt, Rodger Kempsey, the Bo'ness and Uig ship underwriters. Characters * Gulliver (\\"Gully\\") Foyle: Last remaining survivor of a merchant spaceship, the Nomad. Captured by the \\"Scientific People\\" on an asteroid, he is tattooed on his face according to their customs. The tattoos are later removed, but the scars left under his skin become visible when his emotions get out of control. * Presteign: Head of the wealthy Presteign clan, whose interests include a chain of luxury department stores, each managed by an identical \\"Mr. Presto\\". Wealthy people like Presteign demonstrate their status by using outmoded methods of transportation and never jaunting if they can avoid it. Presteign holds court in his Star Chamber, an elaborate old-fashioned office equipped with a bar, and staffed by robots. It is designed to disorient visitors and give him the psychological edge. * Robin Wednesbury: A Telesend, a one-way telepath who can send thoughts but not receive them. Foyle meets her in \\"jaunte rehab\\" while pretending to be someone who has lost the ability to jaunte. She discovers his deception but he kidnaps her and rapes her to intimidate her into silence. Later, as Fourmyle, he recruits her to help him navigate the upper echelons of society. After she discovers who he really is, he offers her the prospect of finding her family, who were refugees on the Vorga. * Jisbella (\\"Jiz\\") McQueen: Serving five years of \\"cure\\" in Gouffre Martel for larceny. She turned to crime in rebellion against the limitations imposed on women to \\"protect\\" them in a world where everyone can teleport. She escapes with Foyle and takes him to a criminal doctor who is able to bleach out his tattoos by applying a chemical with a tattoo needle. The process is agony for Foyle but Jisbella makes him endure it out of disgust for him. * Saul Dagenham: The head of a private \\"special services\\" agency contracted by Presteign to interrogate Gully Foyle and force him to reveal the location of the Nomad. Dagenham was a nuclear scientist who became radioactive in an accident. He cannot remain in a room with other people for more than a short time. The agents of \\"Dagenham Couriers Inc.\\" are a bizarre collection of freaks who specialize in \\"FFCC\\", or \\"Fun, Fantasy, Confusion and Catastrophe\\" to carry out their missions of theft, kidnapping and espionage. * Peter Y'ang-Yeovil: Head of a government Central Intelligence agency based on ancient Chinese principles, who is also trying to find Nomad. He is \\"a member of the dreaded Society of Paper Men, and an adept of the Tsientsin Image Makers\\". Although of Chinese descent and able to speak fluent Mandarin, he does not look Chinese. * Olivia Presteign: Daughter of Presteign. She is an albino who is blind to visible light, but can see in infrared and some radio waves. Like Jisbella, she too is in revolt against her treatment as a woman, and as a genetic anomaly. Her rebellion takes the form of interplanetary smuggling of refugees. It was on one such mission that she ordered her ship, the Vorga, to ignore the distress calls from Nomad. * Regis Sheffield: A high-priced lawyer working for Presteign, he is actually an agent of the Outer Satellites coalition. * \\"Bunny\\", Sheffield's personal secretary. He is apparently Chinese, speaks Mandarin with difficulty, and is said to resemble a frightened rabbit, hence the nickname. Speculative science The novel included some notable early descriptions of proto-science and fictional technology, among them Bester's portrayal of psionics, including the phenomenon of \\"jaunting\\", named after the scientist (Charles Fort Jaunte) who discovered it. Jaunting is the instantaneous teleportation of one's body (and anything one is wearing or carrying). One is able to move up to a thousand miles by just thinking. This suddenly revealed, and near-universal ability, totally disrupts the economic balance between the Inner Planets (Venus, Earth, Mars, and the Moon) and the Outer Satellites (various moons of Jupiter, Saturn, and Neptune), eventually leading to a war between the two. Jaunting has other effects on the social fabric of the novel's world, and these are examined in true science-fictional fashion. Women of the upper classes are locked away in jaunte-proof rooms \\"for their protection\\", the treatment of criminals of necessity goes back to the Victorian \\"separate system\\", and freaks and monsters abound. The second significant technology in the novel is the rare substance known as \\"PyrE\\", a weapons technology powerful enough to win an interplanetary war. Bester's description of synesthesia is the first popular account published in the English language. It is also quite accurate. Reception and influence Initially, reviews of The Stars My Destination were mixed. The well-regarded science fiction writer and critic Damon Knight, in In Search of Wonder (1956), wrote of the novel's \\"bad taste, inconsistency, irrationality, and downright factual errors\\", but called the ending of the book \\"grotesquely moving\\". In a profile of Bester for Continuum Encyclopedia of American Literature (2005), critic Steven H. Gale cited the novel as a reflection of the author's maturation, addressing as it does \\"the continued evolution of humankind as a species\\", a grander theme than those treated with in his earlier work. Gale declared the novel to be Bester's most stylistically ambitious work, citing the use of disparate fonts to evoke synaesthesia, the progressively intelligent language accorded to the maturing protagonist, and the framing of the narrative between the variations on Blake's quatrain. The book has received high praise from several science fiction writers. After criticizing unrealistic science fiction, Carl Sagan in 1978 listed The Stars My Destination as among stories \\"that are so tautly constructed, so rich in the accommodating details of an unfamiliar society that they sweep me along before I have even a chance to be critical\\". By 1987, when the author died, \\"It was apparent that the 1980s genre owed an enormous debt to Bester‚Äîand to this book in particular,\\" Neil Gaiman wrote in the introduction to a 1999 edition of the book. \\"The Stars My Destination is, after all, the perfect cyberpunk novel: it contains such cheerfully protocyber elements as multinational corporate intrigue; a dangerous, mysterious, hyperscientific MacGuffin (PyrE); an amoral hero; a supercool thief-woman ...\\" James Lovegrove called it \\"the very best of Bester\\", and Thomas M. Disch identified it as \\"one of the great sf novels of the 1950s\\". \\"Our field has produced only a few works of actual genius, and this is one of them,\\" wrote Joe Haldeman. who added that he reads the novel \\"every two or three years and it still evokes a sense of wonder.\\" According to Samuel R. Delany, the book is \\"considered by many to be the greatest single SF novel\\". while Robert Silverberg wrote that it is \\"on everybody's list of the ten greatest SF novels\\". Fantasy writer Michael Moorcock praised it as \\"a wonderful adventure story\\" that embodies truly libertarian principles.Moorcock, Michael. \\"Starship Stormtroopers \\". Cienfuegos Press Anarchist Review, 1978. Ty Franck, co-author of The Expanse series, said \\"I don't remember any of the other stories in [A Treasury of Great Science Fiction, Volume Two; an anthology of science fiction stories], and I read that book a dozen times. The only story that sticks out in my mind is The Stars My Destination.\\" In a 2011 survey asking leading science fiction writers to name their favourite work of the genre, The Stars My Destination was the choice of William Gibson and Moorcock. Gibson remarked that the book was \\"perfectly surefooted, elegantly pulpy\\", and \\"dizzying in its pace and sweep\\", and a \\"talisman\\" for him in undertaking his first novel. Moorcock hailed Bester's novel as a reminder of \\"why the best science fiction still contains, as in Ballard, vivid imagery and powerful prose coupled to a strong moral vision\\". In 2012, the novel was included in the Library of America two- volume boxed set American Science Fiction: Nine Classic Novels of the 1950s, edited by Gary K. Wolfe. Adaptations Howard Chaykin and Byron Preiss created a graphic adaptation the first half of which was published in 1979 by Baronet Publishing and the complete version - delayed due to Baronet's bankruptcy after releasing the original version - by Marvel Entertainment's Epic imprint in 1992.'The Complete Alfred Bester's The Stars My Destination' by Howard Chaykin and Byron Preiss A dramatisation titled Tiger! Tiger! was broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on September 14, 1991 and repeated on August 16, 1993. It was scripted by Ivan Benbrook and directed by Andy Jordan. Alun Armstrong played Gully Foyle, Miranda Richardson was Olivia, Siobhan Redmond was Robin Wednesbury and Lesley Manville was Jisbella McQueen. A 2004 anime series, Gankutsuou: The Count of Monte Cristo, was originally intended as an adaptation of The Stars My Destination, the copyright holders' refusal to allow an adaptation led the director, Mahiro Maeda, to instead use The Count of Monte Cristo, which had inspired Bester's story. Various film adaptations of the book have been scripted but none has yet made it to the screen.\\"Destination: Development Hell: How Alfred Bester's 'The Stars My Destination' Took a Jaunt to Hollywood\\" in David Hughes, The Greatest Sci-Fi Movies Never Made. Chicago IL: A Capella Books, 2001, pp. 8-17 While the novel has long been considered an \\"unfilmable\\" science fiction work, the screen rights were acquired by Universal Pictures in 2006\\"U has 'Stars' in its eyes\\" Variety (March 21, 2006) and by Paramount Pictures in 2015. In popular culture * Stephen King refers to The Stars My Destination in several works. In Lisey's Story (2006), the title character recalls it as her deceased husband's favorite novel. The short story \\"The Jaunt\\" (1981) takes its title from the book, and explicitly names and references it at several points. * Gully Foyle makes a cameo appearance as an agent for the Jurisfiction organisation in the BookWorld of author Jasper Fforde's Thursday Next series. Another novel in the series, The Well of Lost Plots, uses Stars My Destination as the title of a tabloid newspaper in the fictional universe of Emperor Zhark. * The novel inspired the song \\"Tiger! Tiger!\\" by the heavy metal band Slough Feg, which appeared on their 2007 album Hardworlder, the cover of which depicts Gully Foyle. * \\"The Stars Our Destination\\" is the name of a song on the 1994 Stereolab album Mars Audiac Quintet. * The British TV series The Tomorrow People uses \\"jaunting\\" to refer to teleportation. * In the 2000 video game Deus Ex, Gully Foyle is listed as a current resident of the 'Ton Hotel. * The character \\"Enzo Paulo Gugino\\" in John Scalzi's novel Zoe's Tale wrote a poem entitled \\"The Stars My Destination\\" based on \\"the title from an obscure fantasy adventure book that he'd never read but whose title stayed with him.\\" * The character Alfred Bester (Babylon 5) is named after the author. * In Crooked Little Vein by Warren Ellis, the novel, and more specifically the element PyrE, is referenced by Zack Pickles when explaining to protagonist Michael McGill the impact of rebel journalism on society and the power structure of society as a whole. * In the novel Death's End by Cixin Liu, the Planetary Defense Council adopts Resolution 479, initiating the Stars Our Destination Project. * Stars My Destination was the title of a year-long story arc in Starman comics. * In the mobile game Tokyo Afterschool Summoners, the lore of the character Nomad is heavily based on the contents of the book, as well as the poem \\"The Tyger\\".

Before becoming an astronaut, Gibson graduated from the University of Rochester and the California Institute of Technology. He became a research assistant in jet propulsion while completing his studies, and eventually became a research scientist for Philco Corporation until joining NASA in 1965. Gibson is the last surviving crew member of Skylab 4. Gibson was selected as part of NASA Astronaut Group 4, the first group of scientist-astronauts. He served on the support crew of Apollo 12, the second Moon landing mission, before working on the development of the Skylab space station. In 1973‚Äì74, Gibson made his only flight into space as science pilot aboard Skylab 4, the third and final crewed flight to Skylab. He, along with Commander Gerald Carr and Pilot William Pogue, spent just over 84 days in space. Gibson resigned from NASA in December 1974, but returned in 1977 to preside over the selection of scientist-astronaut candidates. Gibson retired from NASA for the last time in October, 1982. Early life and education Gibson was born in Buffalo, New York, on November 8, 1936. From ages 2 to 8, Gibson battled osteomyelitissoft spots in bonesand spent many months in and out of hospitals. Newly-available penicillin cured the disease. To strengthen his leg that was nearly amputated, Gibson took up sports: swimming, football, and track. He primarily used swimming to strengthen his leg. He was active in the Boy Scouts of America. He earned the rank of First Class.Edward G. Gibson at scouting.org He graduated from Kenmore Senior High School in Kenmore, New York, in 1955, and earned a Bachelor of Science degree in engineering from the University of Rochester in June 1959. At the University of Rochester, Gibson became a member of the Theta Chi fraternity. He received a Master of Science degree in engineering (jet propulsion option) from the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) in June 1960 and a Ph.D. in engineering with a minor in physics from Caltech in June 1964. Early career While studying at Caltech, Gibson was a research assistant in the field of jet propulsion and classical physics. His technical publications are in the fields of plasma physics and solar physics. He was senior research scientist with the Applied Research Laboratories of the Philco Corporation at Newport Beach, California, from June 1964 until moving to NASA. While at Philco, he did research in lasers and the optical breakdown of gases. Gibson has logged more than 4,300 hours flying time‚Äî2,270 hours in jet aircraft. NASA career Gibson's spacewalk during his time on Skylab 4 Gibson was selected as a scientist-astronaut by NASA in June 1965. He completed a 53-week course in flight training at Williams Air Force Base, Arizona, and earned his Air Force wings. Since then, he has flown helicopters and the T-38. He served as a member of the astronaut support crew and as a CAPCOM for the Apollo 12 lunar landing, becoming the first from the scientist-astronaut group to get a crew assignment of any kind. He also participated in the design and testing of many elements of the Skylab space station. As part of his preparation for the Skylab program, Gibson studied solar physics, ultimately writing an introductory monograph/textbook on solar astrophysics The Quiet Sun, apart from 1973 English edition published in the United States there was 1977 Russian edition of this book, published in the Soviet Union by Mir Publishers. =Skylab 4= Gibson at the Apollo Telescope Mount console in the Skylab Multiple Docking Adapter Gibson was the science pilot of Skylab 4. The third and final crewed visit to the Skylab space station, it launched November 16, 1973, and concluded February 8, 1974. This was the longest crewed flight (84 days 1 hour 15 minutes) in the history of crewed space exploration at that time. Gibson was accompanied on the record- setting 34.5-million-mile flight by Commander Gerald P. Carr and Pilot William R. Pogue. They successfully completed 56 experiments, 26 science demonstrations, 15 subsystem detailed objectives, and 13 student investigations during their 1,214 revolutions of the Earth. They also acquired a wide variety of earth resources observations data using Skylab's earth resources experiment package camera and sensor array. Dr. Gibson was the crewman primarily responsible for the 338 hours of Apollo Telescope Mount operation, which made extensive observations of solar processes.\\"NASA's Scientist-Astronauts,\\" David Shayler and Colin Burgess Until the Soviet Union's Soyuz 26 broke the record in March 1978, Gibson and his Skylab 4 teammates held the world record for individual time in space: 2,017 hours 15 minutes 32 seconds. Gibson logged 15 hours and 22 minutes in three EVAs outside the Skylab Orbital Workshop. Gibson resigned from NASA in December 1974 to do research on Skylab solar physics data as a senior staff scientist with the Aerospace Corporation of Los Angeles, California. Beginning in March 1976, he served for one year as a consultant to ERNO Raumfahrttechnik GmbH, in West Germany, on Spacelab design under the sponsorship of a U.S. Senior Scientist Award form the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation. In March 1977, Gibson returned to the Astronaut Office astronaut candidate selection and training as Chief of the Scientist-Astronaut Candidates. During his second tenure at NASA, Gibson had hoped to fly on another space station mission due to his experience on Skylab, but at the same time was not keen on flying a Space Shuttle mission. He served as CAPCOM for STS-1. Gibson ultimately decided to retire from NASA again on October 31, 1982 and began working for TRW. Post-NASA activities In October 1990, Gibson began his own consulting firm, Gibson International Corp. The firm provides consulting services on program management, market development and space infrastructure design and operations. He has performed a significant amount of speaking and writing, having published a text book in solar physics, two novels (Reach and In the Wrong Hands ), and edited The Greatest Adventure, a compilation of stories and pictures on space missions from many astronauts and cosmonauts around the world. Special honors Gibson was awarded a National Science Foundation Fellowship and the R.C. Baker Fellowship at the California Institute of Technology. He received the Johnson Space Center Certificate of Commendation (1970). He received the City of New York Gold Medal (1974). Gibson, along with the rest of the Skylab astronauts, received the City of Chicago Gold Medal in 1974. Gibson received the 1974 FAI Yuri Gagarin Gold Medal. In 1976, he received the U.S. Scientist Prize from the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation, which provided funds to research in West Germany for a year. He received the JSC Special Achievement Award in 1978. Gibson has also been presented with honorary doctorates of science from the University of Rochester and Wagner College in New York City, both in 1974. The three Skylab astronaut crews were awarded the 1973 Robert J. Collier Trophy \\"For proving beyond question the value of man in future explorations of space and the production of data of benefit to all the people on Earth.\\" In 1974, President Nixon presented the Skylab 4 crew with the NASA Distinguished Service Medal. The American Astronautical Society's 1975 Flight Achievement Award was awarded to the Skylab 4 crew. Federation Aeronautique Internationale awarded the Skylab 4 crew the De La Vaulx Medal and V. M. Komarov Diploma for 1974. Carr accepted the 1975 Dr. Robert H. Goddard Memorial Trophy from President Ford, awarded to the Skylab astronauts. The Skylab 4 crew won the AIAA Haley Astronautics Award in 1975 \\"For demonstrated outstanding courage and skill during their record- breaking 84-day Skylab mission\\".

Glassjaw has been rumored to discourage the purchasing of this album due to their acrimonious split from Roadrunner Records. Instead, they encourage people to download their music via file sharing software, such as Limewire. Robinson claimed that the label showed no interest in the band until he pushed to have them signed and showed little interest after. A remastered version of the album was released on March 24, 2009 with two bonus tracks: \\"Convectuoso\\" and a cover of Youth of Today's \\"Modern Love Story\\". Background and recording Glassjaw originally formed in 1993 after vocalist Daryl Palumbo and guitarist Justin Beck met each other working for a summer camp. Throughout the next few years, the group issued various demo tapes and EPs and experienced many line up changes. Their line up would eventually stabilize by 1999, featuring bassist Manuel Carrero, guitarist Todd Weinstock, and drummer Sammy Siegler. With this line up, the group booked a recording session with local producer Don Fury, and the demo recording that resulted from it would eventually be heard by producer Ross Robinson. Robinson, impressed by the material, would then show up to a rehearsal, after which he offered them studio time at Indigo Ranch and convinced Roadrunner Records to sign the group. Recording sessions for the album lasted for about two months total. While all material for the album was written by the band before production began, Robinson did influence arrangements of the tracks \\"Hurting and Shoving (She Should Have Let Me Sleep)\\" and the album's title track. Content The album has been noted for its overall angry and negative tone in terms of lyrics. The title track was written about Crohn's disease, an intestinal disorder that Palumbo was diagnosed with in 1996. Many songs on the record were written concerning bad relationships, and some accused the band of misogyny due to the violent nature of the lyrics. The band have made statements condemning the lyrics. Track listing All lyrics written by Daryl Palumbo. All music written by Glassjaw, except \\"Lovebites and Razorblades\\", \\"Hurting and Shoving (She Should Have Let Me Sleep)\\" and \\"Everything You Ever Wanted to Know About Silence\\", written by Glassjaw and Ross Robinson. Reception Everything You Ever Wanted to Know About Silence has received generally favorable reviews. Absolute Punk reviewer namel praised the songs \\"Pretty Lush\\" and \\"Piano\\", but said some of the album's songs have cringe-worthy lyrics and criticized the track \\"Babe\\". In a retrospective review of the album, Metal Sucks reviewer Mike Gitter was highly positive of the album. Gitter stated \\"Glassjaw laid down the bitchslap in-extremis\\" and regarded the album as a landmark. NME compared the album to \\"Jeff Buckley doused in napalm, crawling through a room full of broken glass.\\" Personnel *Daryl Palumbo - Vocals *Justin Beck - Guitar *Manuel Carrero - Bass guitar *Todd Weinstock - Guitar *Sammy Siegler - Drums *Ross Robinson - Production, mixing *Steve Evetts - Mixing *Chuck Johnson - Engineering *Ted Jensen - Mastering *Kaz Kiriya - Band photography *Paul Brown - Image photography References Glassjaw albums 2000 debut albums Roadrunner Records albums Albums produced by Ross Robinson Nu metal albums by American artists ","title":"Everything You Ever Wanted to Know About Silence"},{"id":"598948","text":"George Patrick John Rushworth Jellicoe, 2nd Earl Jellicoe, Baron Jellicoe of Southampton, (4 April 1918 ‚Äì 22 February 2007) was a British politician, diplomat and businessman. Lord Jellicoe was the only son but sixth and youngest child of John Jellicoe, 1st Earl Jellicoe, who was a First World War naval commander, commander at the Battle of Jutland, and Admiral of the Fleet; and his wife Florence Gwendoline (died 1964), who was the second daughter of Sir Charles Cayzer, 1st Bt., of Gartmore, Perthshire. As well as commanding the Special Boat Service in the Second World War, George Jellicoe was a long- serving parliamentarian, being a member of the House of Lords for 68 years (1939‚Äì2007). Early life Jellicoe was born at Hatfield and was christened on 29 July 1918 by the Most Rev. and Right Hon. Cosmo Lang, 89th Archbishop of York, while King George V (represented by Admiral Sir Stanley Colville) and HRH Princess Patricia of Connaught (later known as Lady Patricia Ramsay) stood sponsor as two of his godparents. The others were: Miss Lilian Lear, Admiral Sir Lionel Halsey (Third Sea Lord), Mr. Eustace Burrows (cousin), Major Herbert Cayzer (uncle), and The Rev. Frederick G. G. Jellicoe (uncle, and Rector of New Alresford). Much of his childhood was spent at St Lawrence Hall, near Ventnor on the Isle of Wight; at St Peter's Court, a prep school at Broadstairs, Kent; in London; and in the Dominion of New Zealand, where his father was viceroy with the title of Governor-General between 1921 and 1924. He was educated at Winchester College, where he was styled and known as Viscount Brocas. He won the Vere Herbert Smith history prize and secured an exhibition to Trinity College, Cambridge (matriculated 1936. BA, Modern History tripos 1939, but awarded 1966). He was chairman of the Pitt Club, and his tutor Steven Runciman became a lifelong friend. Second World War In October 1939, the young Jellicoe was a cadet in the first wartime intake at the RMC, Sandhurst.Windmill, Lorna Almonds.

He was commissioned into the Coldstream Guards on 23 March 1940, before joining No. 8 (Guards) Commando, with whom on 31 January 1941 he sailed to the Middle East with Colonel Bob Laycock's Layforce (whose commando officers included Evelyn Waugh, Randolph Churchill, Philip Dunne, Carol Mather, David Stirling, and many distinguished others). He served with L Detachment (from April 1942) (with some of the above and Stephen Hastings), which was the nucleus of the Special Air Service. He was mentioned in despatches thrice, and wounded (bullet in shoulder) once whilst with the 3rd Battalion, Coldstream Guards, in 22 (Guards) Brigade in the Western Desert in January 1941. He won the DSO in November 1942 for operating on a raid that claimed to have blown up more than 20 German aircraft (Ju 88s) on Heraklion airfield, Crete, that June: > His cool and resolute leadership, skill and courage throughout this very > hazardous operation were mainly responsible for the high measure of success > achieved. He ... placed charges on the enemy aircraft and brought off the > survivors after the four Free French members of the party had been betrayed > and killed or captured.London Gazette, 5 November 1942, quoted from L. > Almonds Windmill, page 49 In September 1943, Jellicoe was sent to the Italian-held island of Rhodes to negotiate with the Italian Admiral Inigo Campioni for the surrender of his forces to the Allies. However, negotiations were pre-empted by a surprise German attack on the island on 9 September. He was able to escape from Rhodes during the resulting chaos while the Italian garrison was captured by the German invasion force. This was part of the Dodecanese Campaign. In 1943, he was named Commander of the Special Boat Regiment, Middle East, and he was promoted to the rank of lieutenant-colonel. He was eventually promoted to brigadier.Churchill's secret warriors. Damien Lewis 2014. For the remainder of the war, his SBS command conducted secretive and dangerous operations along the coasts of Italy and Yugoslavia. In 1944, he won the MC for one of these actions. At the end of the war, Jellicoe was among the first Allied soldiers to enter German-occupied Athens, beating the communist-controlled guerrillas ELAS, to create a pro-Allied presence in the capital. Years later, when First Lord of the Admiralty, Jellicoe told at least one reporter, \\"The only serious military distinction I ever achieved was having a new type of assault boat named after me. It was called I am ashamed to say, the Jellicoe Inflatable Intruder Mark One.\\" In March 1944, Lord Jellicoe married Patricia Christine O'Kane (October 1917 ‚Äì March 2012), who was employed at the British Embassy in Beirut. She had been born and raised in Shanghai and was the daughter of a Greenock-born Irish father and an English mother. Patricia, Countess Jellicoe (popularly known as Patsy Jellicoe), would remain married to Lord Jellicoe until 1966, when they divorced. They had two sons and two daughters together, the eldest son being the 3rd Earl Jellicoe. HM Foreign Service 1947‚Äì1958 Soon after the war Lord Jellicoe joined His Majesty's Foreign Service, (appointed a Foreign Service Officer, Grade 8 in the Senior Branch of the Foreign Service, 10 September 1947). He served in London (German political department, Third Secretary); Washington (Third Secretary, when Donald Maclean of the Cambridge five was Head of Chancery, and then as one of the 11 Second Secretaries with H. A. R. Philby, seeing NATO signed on 4 April 1949, all when Sir Oliver Franks was Ambassador); transferred to Brussels 10 September 1951 (Head of Chancery) acted as Charg√© d'Affaires in 1952); London (no. 2 in Northern department in charge of the Soviet Desk from September 1953); and Baghdad from January 1956 (First Secretary and Deputy Secretary General of the Baghdad Pact Organisation). The Suez Crisis (from July 1956) wrecked everything the Pact was trying to achieve; Jellicoe was appalled by British policy and came close to resigning (L. Windmill p. 136). Jellicoe eventually left the Foreign Office in March 1958, after marital difficulties had caused an impasse (February 1958, Permanent Secretary Sir Derek Hoyar-Millar wrote; 'You have a choice of ceasing your relationship with this lady [Philippa Dunne] or changing your job'). He became a director of the Cayzer dynasty's Clan Line Steamers (cargo ships), and Union Castle Steamship Co. (passengers). However, enthusiasm for his mother's family's businesses ultimately gave way to the call of the Palace of Westminster, where, back from Iraq, he took the Oath in the Lords on 3 December 1957, in the Third Session of the 41st Parliament. House of Lords and 1960s Jellicoe during a skiing holiday. Jellicoe skiing in France. Having first sat in parliament on 25 July 1939, Jellicoe waited until 28 July 1958 to make his maiden speech in the House of Lords during a debate entitled \\"The International Situation: The Middle East\\". He spoke from the Cross-Benches about the Baghdad Pact and Iraq: By October 1958 he had joined the Conservatives, in the Lords a natural home for such a distinctly pinkPiers Dixon in Philip Ziegler & Desmond Seward (eds): Brooks's: A Social History, 1991. Whig, who gave him the honour of moving \\"an humble Address in Reply to Her Majesty's Most Gracious Speech\\" On 7 May 1959, he asked a prescient starred question on the planning of motorways: On 20 July 1959 he initiated a debate on Western aid for uncommitted countries, and by January 1961 he was a Lord-in-waiting to H.M. the Queen, a Government Whip, in Macmillan's administration. He was Joint Parliamentary Secretary, Ministry of Housing and Local Government June 1961 ‚Äì July 1962; Minister of State, Home Office July 1962 ‚Äì October 1963; First Lord of the Admiralty October 1963 ‚Äì April 1964; Minister of Defence for the Royal Navy April‚ÄìOctober 1964; delegate to the Council of Europe and the Western European Union (WEU) 1965‚Äì1967; president of the National Federation of Housing Societies 1965‚Äì1970; a governor of the Centre for Environmental Studies 1967‚Äì1970; chairman of the British Advisory Committee on Oil Pollution at Sea 1968; chairman of the third International Conference on oil pollution of the sea 1968; an hon. vice-president of PEST (Pressure for Economic and Social Toryism); and deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Lords 1967‚Äì1970. From April 1967 Lords Jellicoe and Carrington represented the Conservatives in the Lords on the Inter-Party conference group on Lords' reform, which came up with the unsuccessful Parliament (No.2) Bill (1968‚Äì1969). Leading the debate for the (Conservative) Opposition in November 1968 Jellicoe said: During the late 1960s he worked in the City of London where he became chairman of British Reserve Insurance and a director of S G Warburg (Finance and Development) Ltd. Cabinet minister and resignation In Ted Heath's administration he was Minister in charge for the Civil Service Department (CSD), Lord Privy Seal (as such he was eighth on the Roll of The Lords) and Leader of the House of Lords from 20 June 1970 until 24 May 1973. Having earlier re-established relations with the miners' union leaders in February 1972, Heath appointed Jellicoe \\"energy supremo\\" to restore power supplies around the time of the Three-Day Week and had him set up and chair a Civil Contingencies Unit, which was, when an internal crisis arose, to operate through \\"COBRA\\" (Cabinet Office Briefing Rooms). In June 1972 Jellicoe was sent to lead Concorde's first sales expedition. As Alan Trengove in My Lord, the super salesman, in the Australian The Sun of 22 June 1972 put it, Trengove considered Sir George Edwards and Sir Geoffrey Tuttle \\"equally impressive members of the sales team\\". (Supersonic flights were on the prototype Concorde G-BSST, certificate signed by Brian Trubshaw, and dated 15 June 1972). Jellicoe, with the help of his very experienced Chief Whip, the second Earl St. Aldwyn, steered the European Communities Act (1972) through the Lords, allowing no amendments. The Industrial Relations Act was another legislative highlight. In May 1973 Jellicoe admitted \\"some casual affairs\\" with call girls (from Mayfair Escorts) in the wake of an accidental confusion with Lord Lambton's prostitution scandal. His name seems to have emerged as a result of a connection between Lambton, the madame Norma Levy, and a tenement house or community hall in Somers Town in the London district of St. Pancras called Jellicoe Hall or House, after Basil Jellicoe (1899‚Äì1935) the housing reformer and priest. The word Jellicoe was seen in Levy's notebook, and a connection was assumed to the Minister rather than the building; a structure named after the earl's distant cousin, and one that may have been opened by the Admiral himself in June 1928. The resignation ended Jellicoe's third career in government service. After the resignation (over his marginal involvement in a minor indiscretion) Richard Crossman, writing in The Times, 30 May 1973 (page 18), described Jellicoe as: On return from the Whitsun recess, tributes were paid in the Lords to their departed leader: the (Labour Party) Opposition leader and Jellicoe's predecessor as Lord Privy Seal, Lord Shackleton said: Lord Byers for the Liberal Party added: \\"we regret bitterly his resignation ... He was a reforming innovator and the House owes a great deal more than it probably knows to the interest he took in this House and to his initiatives.\\" (Hansard, 5 June 1973) From the cross-benches Lord Strang added: William Kendall, general secretary of the Civil and Public Services Association said: In July 1973 the Diplock Commission, which had been set up to look into the security implications of Lambton and Jellicoe's adventures, concluded its section on Jellicoe (paragraph 24): Business and post-government public career With no estates to distract him, Jellicoe was free to re-join S. G. Warburg & Co. (1 October 1973), and with the help of Alan Lennox-Boyd, who was soon to retire from the board, he became a non-executive director of the sugar company Tate & Lyle in 1973, a position held until 1993. Thanks in the main to Sir Saxon Tate, and presumably because he had succeeded as chairman (until June 1978) of their subsidiary Tunnel Refineries, the family made him Tate & Lyle's first non-family chairman 1978‚Äì1983. Having revived and retrenched Tate & Lyle, Jellicoe became chairman of Booker Tate, 1988‚Äì91. Other non-governmental jobs included: chairman of engineering plant company the Davy Corporation (Davy McKee) (now subsumed into Aker Kv√¶rner) 1985‚Äì1990; director Sotheby's Holdings 1973‚Äì1993; Morgan Crucible 1974‚Äì88; Smiths Industries Ltd 1973‚Äì1986; S. G. Warburg & Co 1964‚Äì1970, 1973‚Äì1988. He was president of the London Chamber of Commerce and Industry 1979‚Äì1982. He succeeded Lord Limerick as chairman of the Department of Trade and Industry's British Overseas Trade Board (BOTB) 1983‚Äì1986, for which he was knighted. That was followed by chairmanship (1986‚Äì1990) and then the presidency (1990‚Äì1995) of the East European Trade Council (EETC). He was chairman of the Greek Fund Ltd 1988‚Äì1994 (Schroders) and of European Capital Ltd 1991‚Äì1995. Lord Jellicoe was chairman of the council of King's College London (KCL) 1974‚Äì1983; chairman of the Medical Research Council (MRC) 1982‚Äì1990; a trustee of the National Aids Trust (alongside the likes of Lord Goodman, David Puttnam and Robert Maxwell); president of the Royal Geographical Society (RGS) (and of the Institute of British Geographers (IBG) after amalgamation) 1993‚Äì1997; president of the Anglo-Hellenic League 1978‚Äì1986; president of the Kennet and Avon Canal Trust 1987‚Äì1994; president of the UK Crete Veterans Association 1991‚Äì2001; president of the British Heart Foundation (BHF) 1992‚Äì1995; chancellor of Southampton University 1984‚Äì1995, and has been closely associated with research and higher education. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1990. In 1995 he helped found Hakluyt & Company, a strategic intelligence and advisory firm, for which he was a director 1996‚Äì2000. He was president of the SAS Regimental Association 1996‚Äì2000, when he became its patron. Jellicoe was a member of the Onassis International Prizes Committee (1983‚Äì1992); a vice-president of The European-Atlantic Group and of the Byron Society; he was on the board of the Hellenic College London; patron of the City of Southampton Society; a patron of the Greek Archaeological Committee (UK); one of five patrons of The Community Foundation for Wiltshire and Swindon; a director of The Landscape Foundation (now dormant); patron of Friends of The Royal Hospital School; patron of the Hampshire and Wight Trust for Maritime Archaeology; a member of the World Innovation Fund (WIF) and an associate member of INEED. In 2002 he became a patron of The Second World War Experience Centre in Leeds. Later state contributions He was chairman of the Lords' Select Committee on Committees (1990‚Äì1993) and President of the Parliamentary and Scientific Committee (1980‚Äì1983). In 1983 he was author of the Jellicoe Report which reviewed the operation of the Prevention of Terrorism (Temporary Provisions) Act 1976. The Times saw this appointment as the end of nine years penance in the political wilderness. Between 1963 and 1973 Jellicoe had averaged 90 House of Lords daily attendances per parliamentary session. From 1973 to 1989 his attendance fell to an average of nine appearances per session. However, between 1990 and 2001 he made an average of 72 visits per session. He maintained this rate until early 2006, though his last full speech in the Lords was made as part of the Address in Reply to Her Majesty's Most Gracious Speech (the Queen's Speech debate) on 28 October 1996; his subject was Ukraine. When the House of Lords Act 1999 removed his hereditary automatic entitlement to attend and sit in the House of Lords, he was created a life peer as Baron Jellicoe of Southampton, of Southampton in the County of Hampshire, so that he could continue to be summoned: > 1\\\\. Earl Jellicoe (Lord Jellicoe of Southampton) ‚ÄîThe Rt Hon. George Patrick > John Rushworth Earl Jellicoe, having been created Baron Jellicoe of > Southampton, of Southampton in the County of Hampshire, for life by Letters > Patent dated 6 o'clock in the forenoon of 17th November 1999, took and > subscribed the oath pursuant to statute. Lord Jellicoe remained an active member of the House of Lords for the rest of his life. At his death in 2007, Lord Jellicoe was the longest-serving member of the House of Lords, and arguably the longest-serving parliamentarian in the world, having succeeded his father on 20 November 1935 and come of age and sat first in parliament on 25 July 1939. Because he waited until 28 July 1958 to make his maiden speech, a few peers (viz. Earl Ferrers and Lords Renton, Carrington, Healey, and Strabolgi) could have been considered to have been active parliamentarians longer. Moreover, at the time of his death, on the Privy Council only the Duke of Edinburgh (1951) and Lords Carrington (1959), Deedes and Renton (both 1962) had served longer. Character In May 1973, at the time of his resignation from the government, friends are quoted as saying: In July 1970, as one of the first people to be breathalized, he was banned from driving for a year and fined 75 pounds with 20 guineas costs for having consumed more than the permitted level of alcohol in Old Brompton Road at 4 a.m. on 21 March 1970. Luck saw to it that the case came after the General Election and the ban coincided with the arrival of his right to a full-time government car. In 2000, his friend, the former British Ambassador to the United States, Sir Nicholas Henderson, wrote: Lorna Windmill's biography termed Jellicoe a \\"British Achilles\\" on account of two of his careers derailing as a result of women: in the 1950s for love, and in the 1970s for escorts.  Personal life  Lord Jellicoe married firstly, 23 March 1944, Patricia O'Kane (1917‚Äì2012), by whom he had two sons and two daughters. He married secondly, in 1966, Philippa, daughter of Captain Philip Dunne (1904‚Äì1965), by whom he had one son and two daughters. He had eight children in total, born between 1944 and 1984. He was a member of Brooks's (since 1940), the Special Forces Club, the Ski Club of Great Britain and was a liveryman of the Worshipful Company of Mercers. He died on 22 February 2007, six weeks before his 89th birthday, at Tidcombe Manor, his house in Wiltshire.

Originally the overall process was called tapeout as historically early ICs used graphical black crepe tape on mylar media for photo imaging (erroneously believed to reference magnetic data‚Äîthe photo process greatly predated magnetic media). When using a standard process‚Äîwhere the interaction of the many chemical, thermal, and photographic variables is known and carefully controlled‚Äîthe behaviour of the final integrated circuit depends largely on the positions and interconnections of the geometric shapes. Using a computer-aided layout tool, the layout engineer‚Äîor layout technician‚Äîplaces and connects all of the components that make up the chip such that they meet certain criteria‚Äîtypically: performance, size, density, and manufacturability. This practice is often subdivided between two primary layout disciplines: Analog and digital. The generated layout must pass a series of checks in a process known as physical verification. The most common checks in this verification process areA. Kahng, J. Lienig, I. Markov, J. Hu: VLSI Physical Design: From Graph Partitioning to Timing Closure, , , p. 10. * design rule checking (DRC), * layout versus schematic (LVS), * parasitic extraction, * antenna rule checking, and * electrical rule checking (ERC). When all verification is complete, layout post processing is applied where the data is also translated into an industry- standard format, typically GDSII, and sent to a semiconductor foundry. The milestone completion of the layout process of sending this data to the foundry is now colloquially called \\"tapeout\\". The foundry converts the data into mask data and uses it to generate the photomasks used in a photolithographic process of semiconductor device fabrication. In the earlier, simpler, days of IC design, layout was done by hand using opaque tapes and films, an evolution derived from early days of printed circuit board (PCB) design -- tape-out. Modern IC layout is done with the aid of IC layout editor software, mostly automatically using EDA tools, including place and route tools or schematic- driven layout tools. Typically this involves a library of standard cells. The manual operation of choosing and positioning the geometric shapes is informally known as \\"polygon pushing\\".

He has earned the Air Force Distinguished Flying Cross, the Air Medal with 7 Oak Leaf Clusters, the Air Force Meritorious Service Medal, the Liethen-Tittle Award (for Outstanding Student at the USAF Test Pilot School), the Royal Air Force Cross, the NASA Exceptional Service Medal, and NASA Space Flight Medals. Education and early career Grabe graduated from Stuyvesant High School, New York, New York, in 1962, received a Bachelor of Science degree in Engineering Science from the United States Air Force Academy in 1966, and studied Aeronautics as a Fulbright Scholar at the Technische Hochschule, Darmstadt, West Germany, in 1967. Upon graduating from the U.S. Air Force Academy in 1966, Grabe went to Darmstadt, West Germany, as a Fulbright Scholar. He returned to the United States in 1967 to complete pilot training at Randolph Air Force Base, Texas. He subsequently flew F-100 aircraft with the 27th Tactical Fighter Wing at Cannon Air Force Base, New Mexico, and in 1969 was assigned as an F-100 pilot with the 3d Tactical Fighter Wing at Bien Hoa Air Base in the Republic of Vietnam, where he flew 200 combat missions. In 1970, he was reassigned to the 27th Tactical Fighter Wing at Cannon Air Force Base to fly F-100 and F-111 aircraft. He participated in the operational test and evaluation of the weapons system of the F-111D aircraft. Grabe attended the USAF Test Pilot School in 1974 and, upon graduating in 1975, was assigned to the Air Force Flight Test Center as a test pilot for the A-7 and F-111. He was the program manager and chief project pilot for the Air Force's digital flight control system for tactical fighters (DIGITAC) evaluation. He later served as an exchange test pilot with the Royal Air Force at Boscombe Down, United Kingdom, from 1976 to 1979. During this tour of duty, he served as the chief project pilot for the Royal Air Force Harrier and the Royal Navy Sea Harrier. He was an instructor at the USAF Test Pilot School at Edwards Air Force Base, California, when advised of his selection by NASA. He has logged more than 5,500 hours flying time. NASA experience Grabe became a NASA astronaut in August 1981. He has served as a chief verification pilot for STS-3 and STS-4 entry guidance, navigation and control simulation testing; as the Deputy Manager for Operations Integration, Space Shuttle Program Office; and subsequently as the Chief of Training within the Astronaut Office. A veteran of four space flights, Grabe served as Pilot on STS-51-J (October 3‚Äì7, 1985) and STS-30 (May 4‚Äì8, 1989), and was the mission commander on STS-42 (January 22‚Äì30, 1992) and STS-57 (June 21 to July 1, 1993). Grabe has logged over 627 hours in space. Effective April 11, 1994, Grabe left NASA and the Air Force to join Orbital Sciences Corporation, Dulles, Virginia. Space flight experience STS-51-J, the second Space Shuttle Department of Defense mission, launched from Kennedy Space Center, Florida, on October 3, 1985. This was the maiden voyage of the Atlantis, the final Orbiter in the Shuttle fleet. After 98 hours of orbital operations, Atlantis landed at Edwards Air Force Base, California, on October 7, 1985. Mission duration was 97 hours, 14 minutes, 38 seconds. STS-30 Atlantis launched from Kennedy Space Center, Florida, on May 4, 1989. During the four-day mission, the crew successfully deployed the Magellan Venus-exploration spacecraft, the first U.S. planetary science mission launched since 1978, and the first planetary probe to be deployed from the Shuttle. Magellan arrived at Venus in mid-1990, and mapped over 95% of the surface of Venus. Magellan has been one of NASA's most successful scientific missions and continues to operate today gaining information about the Venetian atmosphere and magnetic field. In addition, crew members also worked on secondary payloads involving fluid research in general, chemistry, and electrical storm studies. Following 64 orbits of the Earth, the STS-30 mission concluded with a landing at Edwards Air Force Base, California, on May 8, 1989. Mission duration was 96 hours, 57 minutes, 35 seconds. STS-42 Discovery launched from the Kennedy Space Center, Florida, on January 22, 1992. Fifty- five major experiments conducted in the International Microgravity Laboratory-1 module were provided by investigators from eleven countries, and represented a broad spectrum of scientific disciplines. During 128 orbits of the Earth, the seven-person crew accomplished the mission's primary objective of investigating the effects of microgravity on materials processing and life sciences. In this unique laboratory in space, the crew worked around-the-clock in two shifts. Experiments investigated the microgravity effects on the growth of protein and semiconductor crystals. Biological experiments on the effects of zero gravity on plants, tissues, bacteria, insects and human vestibular response were also conducted. This eight-day mission culminated in a landing at Edwards Air Force Base, California, on January 30, 1992. Mission duration was 193 hours, 14 minutes, 45 seconds. STS-57 Endeavour launched from the Kennedy Space Center, Florida, on June 21, 1993. The primary mission of this flight was the retrieval of the European Retrievable Carrier satellite (EURECA). Additionally, STS-57 featured the first flight of the Spacehab, a commercially provided middeck augmentation module for the conduct of microgravity experiments. Spacehab carried 22 individual flight experiments in materials processing and human factors. A spacewalk was conducted on this flight as part of an ongoing program to evaluate extravehicular activity (EVA) techniques for future missions. The Space Shuttle Endeavour landed at the Kennedy Space Center on July 1, 1993, after 10 days on orbit. Mission duration was 239 hours, 45 minutes. He is married to the former Lynn O'Keefe of Ottawa, Canada. Ron has two daughters and he and Lynn have a son. Recreational interests include skiing, wind surfing, and racquet sports.

Chokers can be made of a variety of materials, including velvet, plastic, beads, latex, leather, metal, such as silver, gold or platinum, etc. They can be adorned in a variety of ways, including with sequins, studs, or a pendant. American silk and metal choker from the 1870s Queen Alexandra History Golden choker necklaces were crafted by Sumerian artisans around 2500 BC and according to curators from the Jewelry Museum of Fine Arts, chokers have been around for thousands of years, first gracing the world's earliest civilizations: Ancient Egypt, in addition to the Sumerians in Mesopotamia. Often made with gold or lapis, the necklaces were thought to be protective and imbued with special powers. Chokers were also later worn in the First Century A.D. They are mentioned in the Talmud, book Shabbat, chapter 6Shabbos, beginning of chapter 6 as a common women's accessory. Historically, it was associated with high fashion, but could take on different meanings under different circumstances. In 1798, during the French Revolution, women wore red ribbons around their necks to pay homage to those who met their death at the guillotine. The ribbon could be worn around the neck, or another fashion came in the form of an X around the shoulders and back. Ballerinas and the upper class in the late 19th century commonly wore certain types of chokers. However, at that same time, in the late 19th century, a plain, thin, red, or black ribbon choker had ties to prostitution, as seen in Manet's Olympia (1861). The 19th century fashion for broad chokers reached its peak around 1900 in part due to Queen Alexandra of the United Kingdom wearing one to hide a small scar. Chokers were popular into the 1920s and again in the '40s as colliers de chien. In particular, the term dog collars or colliers de chien caught on, and these designs ‚Äì incorporating luxe diamonds, pearls, lace, and velvet ‚Äì could be seen as objects of the elite because the best kinds were custom-made to fit one's neck perfectly. In 1944 Life magazine stated that \\"a dowager fashion of 40 years ago\\" was being revived by young women, illustrating the trend with photos of models wearing the now vaguely rebellious \\"dog collars\\". Princess Maria Annunciata of Bourbon-Two Sicilies Modern fashion In recent years, chokers have been popular with a number of celebrities including Gwyneth Paltrow who wore one to the 1999 Academy Awards. Paris Hilton wore three inches of Swarovski around her neck in 2002. Rihanna has also been featured wearing chokers. In the 2010s, the choker became a popular fashion symbol among transgender women, due not only to its association with femininity, but also because of its potential to hide the Adam's apple without performing a tracheal shave.

The pianist hired for the studio-recorded album, More of Tom Lehrer, fell off his bench when he heard the title. =\\"Bright College Days\\"= This song borrows heavily from \\"The Whiffenpoof Song\\", the traditional signature song of the Yale Whiffenpoofs. =\\"The Elements\\"= The lyrics of \\"The Elements\\" (Flash animation) are a recitation of the names of all the chemical elements that were known at the time of writing, up to number 102, nobelium. It can be found on his albums Songs & More Songs by Tom Lehrer as well as An Evening Wasted with Tom Lehrer. The song is sung to the tune of Sir Arthur Sullivan's \\"Major General's Song\\" (\\"I am the very model of a modern major-general...\\") from The Pirates of Penzance. Since that time, 16 more have been discovered. At his concert in Copenhagen (1967), Lehrer admitted, \\"I like to play this song every once in a while, just to see if I can still do it!\\" Indeed, several of Lehrer's fans, such as actor Daniel Radcliffe, have tried and failed to sing it. That is, he sung it in its entirety, but with slight hiccups., broadcast November 12, 2010 At some concerts he also played a version he claims is based on Aristotle's elements: \\"There's earth and air and fire and water.\\", clip from a live performance in 1967 =\\"Oedipus Rex\\"= Lehrer comments that most popular movies of the time have a catchy title song that helps to draw in audiences. Believing that a recent (1957) film adaptation of Sophocles' play Oedipus Rex had failed at the box office because it did not have such a song, he wrote this one in ragtime style. =\\"Clementine\\"= \\"Clementine\\" is a parody of the old folk song \\"Oh My Darling, Clementine\\" as it might have turned out had it had been written by various composers in widely different styles of music. The first verse was in the style of Cole Porter (suggestive of \\"Night and Day\\"); the second verse an aria for baritone in the style of Mozart \\"or one of that crowd\\"; the third verse in the style of the Beatnik \\"Cool School\\" (suggestive of Thelonious Monk's \\"52nd Street Theme\\"); and the rousing finale was, in Lehrer's paraphrase of Shakespeare, \\"full of words and music, and signifying nothing,\\" in the style of Gilbert and Sullivan (suggestive of \\"My name is John Wellington Wells\\" or other patter songs). Lehrer's argument for rewriting the song is that folk songs in general are \\"so atrocious, because they're written 'by the people',\\" and that the original \\"Clementine\\" has \\"no recognizable merit whatsoever.\\" =\\"It Makes a Fellow Proud to Be a Soldier\\"= A parody of the official songs in use by the various branches of the United States military. Lehrer explains that the Army \\"didn't have no official song\\" when he started basic training; he wrote this one in an attempt to remedy the situation. (The branch adopted \\"The Army Goes Rolling Along\\" as its song in 1956, one year after Lehrer enlisted.Army Regulation 220-90, Army Bands, 14 December 2007, para 2-5f, g) One of the rare parodies of Lehrer's work emerged in Jim Bouton's classic book Ball Four: \\"It Makes a Fellow Proud to be an Astro\\", conjured up by members of the 1969 Houston Astros.

It is at the mouth of the River Blyth on the south side of the river. The town of Southwold lies to the north of the river and is the nearest town to Walberswick, around away. Walberswick is around south of Lowestoft on the North Sea coast. It is east of Halesworth and north-east of the county town of Ipswich. Coastal erosion and the shifting of the mouth of the River Blyth meant that the neighbouring town of Dunwich, to the south, was lost as a port in the last years of the 13th century. Following a brief period of rivalry and dispute with Dunwich, Walberswick became a major trading port from the 13th century until World War I. Almost half of the properties in the village are holiday homes.

The original sign went missing in the 1980s but after changing hands has since been returned and restored to mark the Queen's Diamond Jubilee. The restored sign has been erected opposite the church. Culture and community The village and surrounding beach and marshland have long attracted residents drawn from the arts, film and media. In the 1890s and 1900s the village became associated with Philip Wilson Steer and his circle of English Impressionists. It was home to the noted artist and architect Charles Rennie Mackintosh from 1914. It was also the birthplace of Oscar-nominated documentary film maker Humphrey Jennings famous for his World War II documentaries. Considering its size, an inordinate number of British celebrities own or have owned holiday homes in the village including the late Clement Freud and his wife Jill, and their daughter, Emma Freud and her partner Richard Curtis. Martin Bell, and Geoffrey Palmer, maintain properties here while Paul Heiney and Libby Purves live nearby. Film director Paul Greengrass has a house in the village, as does ITV's Director Peter Fincham. The village is the setting for Esther Freud's novel, The Sea House, thinly disguised as 'Steerborough' ‚Äì presumably a coded reference, or in-joke, towards one-time resident, Philip Wilson Steer (see above). Esther Freud, the cousin of Emma Freud and daughter of painter Lucian Freud, also has a house in the village with her husband, actor David Morrissey. The village was famous for its annual crabbing competition ‚Äì the British Open Crabbing Championship, last held in August 2010. The person who caught the single heaviest crab within a period of 90 minutes was declared the winner. The proceeds supported many charitable causes. Walberswick is reputedly haunted by a phantom coach, drawn by headless horses and driven by the murderer Tobias Gill, who was hanged in the area in the 18th century.  Transport  Walberswick is on the B1387 road which runs from the A12 south of Blythburgh to the village where it terminates. It is at the mouth of the River Blyth which forms part of Southwold Harbour. Some mooring points for smaller craft in the harbour lie on the Walberswick side of the river. The river is crossed by the Bailey Bridge, a footbridge, to the west of the village. This provides pedestrian and bicycle access across the river to Southwold. A passenger ferry, operated by a rowing boat, operates across the river closer to the centre of the village during the tourist season. Walberswick railway station was on the narrow-gauge Southwold Railway which ran from Halesworth (railway station) to Southwold (railway station). The station was located to the west of the village around south of the crossing at the Bailey Bridge. The line and station closed on 11 April 1929.

Biography  = Early life = Born in Tredegar, Monmouthshire, Bradfield attended the local Oakdale Comprehensive School where he suffered years of cruelty and bullying (he claims he was \\"a Woody Allen-esque little nerd\\") for his name (nicknamed Crossfire), lazy eye, musical bent and small size. James formed a close relationship with three friends: his cousin Sean Moore, who lived with James and his family throughout their childhood after his own parents' divorce, and future bandmates Nicky Wire and Richey Edwards. Bradfield loved to run and was a steeplechaser, and soon grew fond of punk rock band The Clash, although his earliest musical love was ELO. He gave up his dream of \\"being like Napoleon\\" and decided that he wanted to be a rock star. He learnt to play guitar by learning how to play Guns N' Roses's Appetite for Destruction with the curtains drawn in his parents' front room. = Solo career = Bradfield in De Montfort Hall in 2010 In late April 2006, a track from Bradfield's debut solo single entitled \\"That's No Way to Tell a Lie\\" premiered on Janice Long's show on BBC Radio 2. It became the first single from the album and was released on 10 July while the album, entitled The Great Western, was released on 24 July. The single debuted at #18 in the UK singles chart while the album debuted at #22 on the album chart. The positions were considered relatively successful considering the lack of promotion. In support of the album, Bradfield played a series of solo gigs in May 2006 in Manchester, Glasgow, Dundee, Nottingham, Birmingham, and London. The setlists consisted of tracks from The Great Western as well as several Manics tracks including \\"This Is Yesterday\\" and \\"Ocean Spray\\". He also played one further date at London ULU in June 2006, featuring a similar setlist to the other gigs. Bradfield also performed at the 2006 V Festival in late August. He embarked on his first full UK tour ‚Äì consisting of 15 dates ‚Äì in October. A second single, \\"An English Gentleman\\", was lifted from The Great Western before the tour and entered the UK chart at #31 on 1 October 2006. The second album by Bradfield, Even in Exile, was confirmed in March 2020 to NME alongside the announcement of a 2021 Manics album. That June, the album was confirmed to be inspired by the life and death of V√≠ctor Jara, with lyrics written as unpublished poetry by Patrick Jones. Two tracks, \\"There'll Come a War\\" and the instrumental \\"Seeking the Room With the Three Windows\\" were released the same day. The next week, the album was given a title and date alongside the launch of its first single, \\"The Boy From the Plantation\\", which debuted on Steve Lamacq's show on BBC Radio 6 Music. The album was released on 14 August 2020 on digital, CD, cassette, and vinyl and entered the UK charts at #6, giving Bradfield his first solo top 10 album. = Personal life = He currently lives in Llandaff, Cardiff. Despite having once said ‚ÄúI always get bored of the company of women really quickly,‚Äù he married the band's PR agent Myl√®ne Halsall in a ceremony in Florence, Italy on 11 July 2004. The couple have two children. He is a supporter of Cardiff Blues and Nottingham Forest. In 2015, Bradfield and fellow Manic Sean Moore went to Patagonia in aid of the Velindre charity.

Grainger Postdoctoral Fellow in Experimental Physics, University of Chicago (1988‚Äì89); and senior research fellow, California Institute of Technology (1989‚Äì1992). Grunsfeld's research has covered x-ray and gamma-ray astronomy, high-energy cosmic ray studies, and development of new detectors and instrumentation. Grunsfeld studied binary pulsars and energetic x-ray and gamma ray sources using the NASA Compton Gamma Ray Observatory, x-ray astronomy satellites, radio telescopes, and optical telescopes including the NASA Hubble Space Telescope. NASA career Grunsfeld was selected by NASA in March 1992 as an astronaut candidate and reported to the Johnson Space Center in August 1992. He completed one year of training and qualified for flight selection as a mission specialist. Grunsfeld was initially detailed to the Astronaut Office Mission Development Branch and was assigned as the lead for portable computers for use in space. Following his first flight, he led a team of engineers and computer programmers tasked with defining and producing the crew displays for command and control of the International Space Station (ISS). As part of this activity, he directed an effort combining the resources of the Mission Control Center (MCC) Display Team and the Space Station Training Facility. The result was the creation of the Common Display Development Facility (CDDF), responsible for the onboard and MCC displays for the International Space Station, using object-oriented programming techniques. Following his second flight, he was assigned as Chief of the Computer Support Branch in the Astronaut Office supporting Space Shuttle and International Space Station Programs and advanced technology development. Following STS-103, he served as Chief of the Extravehicular Activity Branch in the Astronaut Office. Following STS-109, Grunsfeld served as an instructor in the Extravehicular Activity Branch, and worked on the Orbital Space Plane, exploration concepts, and technologies for use beyond low earth orbit in the Advanced Programs Branch. He served as NASA Chief Scientist assigned to NASA Headquarters from 2003 to 2004. In January 2012, he became the associate administrator for the Science Mission Directorate at NASA's headquarters in Washington, replacing Ed Weiler. Grunsfeld has been actively engaged in communicating space science topics to the public through interviews, public lectures, and television appearances. He was recently interviewed by NASA's Astrobiology Magazine about the James Webb Telescope and at the Science with Hubble Space Telescope III conference in Venice, Italy, about carrying out repairs and upgrades on the Hubble Space Telescope. Recent public lectures include Hugging Hubble at the Space Telescope Science Institute's May 2010 Symposium, Big Science Questions at the 50th anniversary celebration of the Aspen Center for Physics and The Hubble Story presented as a special public lecture at Oxford University's Department of Physics. He has made several television appearances to discuss the successful landing of the Mars Curiosity Rover in August 2012 and its mission, including appearances on the PBS NewsHour with Judy Woodruff, the Colbert Report, and on NASAtelevision. On April 5, 2016, Grunsfield announced his retirement from NASA, which starts from April 30. Spaceflight experience John Grunsfeld works on the Hubble Space Telescope during STS-125 May 14, 2009 STS-67/Astro-2 (March 2‚Äì18, 1995) was launched from Kennedy Space Center, Florida, and returned to land at Edwards Air Force Base, California. It was the second flight of the Astro observatory, a unique complement of three ultra-violet telescopes. During this record-setting 16-day mission, the crew conducted observations around the clock to study the far ultraviolet spectra of faint astronomical objects and the polarization of ultraviolet light coming from hot stars and distant galaxies. Mission duration was 399 hours and 9 minutes. STS-81 (January 12‚Äì22, 1997) was a 10-day mission, the fifth to dock with Russia's Mir space station, and the second to exchange U.S. astronauts. The mission also carried the Spacehab double module providing additional middeck locker space for secondary experiments. In five days of docked operations more than three tons of food, water, experiment equipment and samples were moved back and forth between the two spacecraft. Grunsfeld served as the flight engineer on this flight. Following 160 orbits of the Earth the STS-81 mission concluded with a landing on Kennedy Space Center's Runway 33 ending a 3.9 million mile journey. Mission duration was 244 hours, 56 minutes. During this flight, Grunsfeld placed a phone call to NPR's auto- repair radio show, Car Talk. In this call he complained about his government Rockwell \\"van's\\" performance. To wit, it would run very loud and rough for about two minutes, quieter for another six and a half, and then the engine would quit. This created some consternation for the hosts until they realized that the van in question was, in fact, the Space Shuttle. STS-103 (December 19‚Äì27, 1999) was an eight-day mission during which the crew successfully installed new gyroscopes and scientific instruments and upgraded systems on the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). Enhancing HST scientific capabilities required three spacewalks (EVA). Grunsfeld performed two spacewalks totaling 16 hours and 23 minutes. The STS-103 mission was accomplished in 120 Earth orbits, traveling 3.2 million miles in 191 hours and 11 minutes. STS-109 (March 1‚Äì12, 2002) was the fourth Hubble Space Telescope (HST) servicing mission. The crew of STS-109 successfully upgraded the Hubble Space Telescope installing a new digital camera, a cooling system for the infrared camera, new solar arrays and a new power system. HST servicing and upgrades were accomplished by four crewmembers during a total of five EVAs in five consecutive days. Grunsfeld served as the Payload Commander on STS-109 in charge of the space walking activities and the Hubble payload. He also performed three spacewalks totaling 21 hours and 9 minutes, including the installation of the new Power Control Unit. STS-109 orbited the Earth 165 times, and covered 3.9 million miles in over 262 hours. STS-125 (May 11‚Äì24, 2009) was the fifth and final servicing mission to the Hubble Space Telescope. Atlantis launched from Kennedy Space Center Launch Pad 39A May 11, 2009 at 2:01 p.m. EDT, and landed on May 24, 2009 at California's Edwards Air Force Base. During the mission, Grunsfeld performed three of the mission's five back-to-back spacewalks, which installed two new instruments to the Hubble Space Telescope: The Cosmic Origins Spectrograph, and the Wide Field Camera 3. The mission also replaced a Fine Guidance Sensor, six new gyroscopes, and two battery unit modules, to allow the telescope to continue to function at least through 2014. One issue Grunsfeld and his crew experienced during the overhaul was the stripping of 10mm bolts due to improper assembly and technique which he discussed again on Car Talk. Grunsfeld has logged over 58 days in space, including eight space walks totaling 58 hours and 30 minutes. Space Telescope Science Institute According to a NASA press release in January 2010, Grunsfeld indicated he would leave the agency to serve as deputy director of the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore. There he helped prepare the institute for operations with NASA's planned James Webb Space Telescope. He also became a research professor in the Johns Hopkins University department of physics and astronomy in July, 2010. Mountaineering Grunsfeld appeared on the PBS NOVA episode \\"Deadly Ascent\\", which showed him climbing Denali, the highest peak in North America, in June 2000. Grunsfeld, along with Howard Donner, (a consultant to NASA) conducted research into the effects of body temperature at high altitudes by using internal thermometers swallowed in pill form. He was able to climb to an altitude of 17,200 feet before acute altitude sickness forced him to turn back. Grunsfeld was inspired by Edmund Hillary in mountaineering. In June 2004, Grunsfeld returned to McKinley while on vacation from NASA and successfully led a team that summitted. He is the only astronaut to have climbed to the top of Denali.

They are anaerobic or microaerophilic, and are often found in stratified water environments including hot springs, stagnant water bodies, as well as microbial mats in intertidal zones.Hunter, C.N., Daldal, F., Thurnauer, M.C., Beatty, J.T. \\"The Purple Phototropic Bacteria\\", Springer-Dordrecht, 2008. Unlike plants, algae, and cyanobacteria, purple sulfur bacteria do not use water as their reducing agent, and therefore do not produce oxygen. Instead, they can use sulfur in the form of sulfide, or thiosulfate (as well, some species can use H2, Fe2+, or NO2‚àí) as the electron donor in their photosynthetic pathways. The sulfur is oxidized to produce granules of elemental sulfur. This, in turn, may be oxidized to form sulfuric acid. The purple sulfur bacteria are largely divided into two families, the Chromatiaceae and the Ectothiorhodospiraceae, which produce internal and external sulfur granules respectively, and show differences in the structure of their internal membranes. They make up part of the order Chromatiales, included in the gamma subdivision of the Proteobacteria. The genus Halothiobacillus is also included in the Chromatiales, in its own family, but it is not photosynthetic. Characteristics of purple sulfur bacteria Major photosynthetic pigments: Bacteriochlorophylls a or b Location of photosynthetic pigments: Plasma membrane and chromatophore (lamellar membrane complexes that are continuous with the plasma membrane) Photosynthetic electron donors: H2, H2S, S Sulfur deposition: Inside the cell Metabolic type: Photolithoautotroph  Ecology  = Habitat = Purple sulfur bacteria are generally found in illuminated anoxic zones of lakes and other aquatic habitats where hydrogen sulfide accumulates and also in \\"sulfur springs\\" where geochemically or biologically produced hydrogen sulfide can trigger the formation of blooms of purple sulfur bacteria. Anoxic conditions are required for photosynthesis; these bacteria cannot thrive in oxygenated environments. The most favorable lakes for the development of purple sulfur bacteria are meromictic (permanently stratified) lakes. Meromictic lakes stratify because they have denser (usually saline) water in the bottom and less dense (usually fresh water) nearer the surface. Growth of purple sulfur bacteria is also supported by the layering in holomictic lakes. These lakes are thermally stratified; in the spring and summer time, water at the surface is warmed making it less dense than underlying colder water which provides a stable enough stratification for purple sulfur bacteria growth. If sufficient sulfate is present to support sulfate reduction, the sulfide, produced in the sediments, diffuses upward into the anoxic bottom waters, where purple sulfur bacteria can form dense cell masses, called blooms, usually in association with green phototrophic bacteria. Purple sulfur bacteria can also be found and are a prominent component in intertidal microbial mats. Mats, such as the Sippewissett Microbial Mat, have dynamic environments due to the flow of tides and incoming fresh water leading to similarly stratified environments as meromictic lakes. Purple sulfur bacteria growth is enabled as sulfur is supplied from the death and decomposition of microorganisms located above them within these intertidal pools. The stratification and sulfur source allows the PSB to grow in these intertidal pools where the mats occur. The PSB can help stabilize these microbial mat environment sediments through the secretion of extracellular polymeric substances that can bind the sediments in the pools.Hubas, C. et al. \\"Proliferation of Purple Sulphur Bacteria at the Sediment Surface Affects Intertidal Mat Diversity and Functionality\\", PLOS One, December 5, 2013. Retrieved February 12, 2020.Stal LJ (2010) https://ac.els- cdn.com/S0925857409000160/1-s2.0-S0925857409000160-main.pdf?_tid=2a3d5a5e-cd79-11e7-aa3b-00000aacb35f&acdnat;=1511130774_f1d9f08b3f0de5ea6f90b0d1427800bb Microphytobenthos as a biogeomorphological force in intertidal sediment stabilization. Ecol Eng 36: 236‚Äì245. doi:10.1016/ j.ecoleng.2008.12.032. =Ecological significance= Purple sulfur bacteria are able to affect their environment by contributing to nutrient cycling, and by using their metabolism to alter their surroundings. They are able to play a significant role in primary production suggesting that these organisms affect the carbon cycle through carbon fixation. Purple sulfur bacteria also contribute to the phosphorus cycle in their habitat, and the iron cycle. Through upwelling of these organisms, phosphorus, a limiting nutrient in the oxic layer of lakes, is recycled and provided to heterotrophic bacteria for use. This indicates that although purple sulfur bacteria are found in the anoxic layer of their habitat, they are able to promote the growth of many heterotrophic organisms by supplying inorganic nutrients to the above oxic layer. Another form of recycling of inorganic nutrients and dissolved organic matter by purple sulfur bacteria is through the food chain; they act as a source of food to other organisms. Some purple sulfur bacteria have evolved to optimize their environmental conditions for their own growth. For example, in the South Andros Black Hole in the Bahamas, purple sulfur bacteria adopted a new characteristic in which they are able to use their metabolism to radiate heat energy into their surroundings. Due to the inefficiency of their carotenoids, or light-harvesting centres, the organisms are able to release excess light energy as heat energy. This adaptation allows them to compete more effectively within their environment. By raising the temperature of the surrounding water, they create an ecological niche which supports their own growth, while also allowing them to outcompete other non-thermotolerant organisms.  Growth in meromictic lakes  Meromictic lakes are permanently stratified lakes produced by a gradient of saline concentrations. The highly salinated bottom layer is separated from the top layer of fresh water by the chemocline, where the salinity changes drastically. Due to the large difference in density, the upper and lower layers do not mix, resulting in an anoxic environment below the chemocline. This anoxic environment with light and sufficient sulfide availability is ideal for purple sulfur bacteria. A study done at the Mahoney Lake suggested that purple sulfur bacteria contributes to the recycling of the inorganic nutrient, phosphorus. The upwelling of purple sulfur bacteria into the top layer of water creates a source of bound phosphorus, and phosphatase activity releases this phosphorus into the water. The soluble phosphorus is then incorporated into heterotrophic bacteria for use in developmental processes. In this way, purple sulfur bacteria participates in the phosphorus cycle and minimizes nutrient loss.  Biomarkers  Purple sulfur bacteria make conjugated pigments called carotenoids that function in the light harvesting complex. When these organisms die and sink, some pigment molecules are preserved in modified form in the sediments. One carotenoid molecule produced, okenone, is diagenetically altered to the biomarker okenane. The discovery of okenane in marine sediments implies the presence of purple sulfur bacteria during the time of burial. Okenane has been identified in one sedimentary outcrop from Northern Australia dating to 1640 million years ago. The authors of the study concluded that, based on the presence of purple sulfur bacteria's biomarker, the Paleoproterozoic ocean must have been anoxic and sulfidic at depth. This finding provides evidence for the Canfield Ocean hypothesis.  Bioremediation  Purple sulfur bacteria can contribute to a reduction of environmentally harmful organic compounds and odour emission in manure wastewater lagoons where they are known to grow. Harmful compounds such as methane, a greenhouse gas, and hydrogen sulfide, a pungent, toxic compound, can be found in wastewater lagoons. PSB can help lower the concentration of both, and others.McGarvey, JA, et al. http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1472-765X.2009.02683.x/epdf \\"Induction of Purple Sulfur Bacterial Growth in Dairy Wastewater Lagoons by Circulation.\\" Letters in Applied Microbiology, vol. 49, no. 4, 2009, pp. 427-433. Harmful organic compounds can be removed through photoassimilation, the uptake of carbon by organisms through photosynthesis.\\"Photoassimilation  Definition of photoassimilation in English by Oxford Dictionaries.\\" https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/photoassimilation Oxford Dictionaries  English, Oxford Dictionaries, en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/photoassimilation. When PSB in the lagoons perform photosynthesis they can utilize the carbon from harmful compounds, such as methane,Leytem, AB, et al. https://ac.els- cdn.com/S0022030217305799/1-s2.0-S0022030217305799-main.pdf?_tid=a8cdccc8-cd79-11e7-8cad-00000aab0f6c&acdnat;=1511130986_0d85d5d96ffb65e1ca976c83f8706f90 \\"Methane Emissions from Dairy Lagoons in the Western United States.\\"Journal of Dairy Science, vol. 100, no. 8, 2017, pp. 6785-6803. as their carbon source. This removes methane, a greenhouse gas, from the lagoon and reduces the lagoons' atmospheric pollution affect. H2S can act as a sulfur source for PSB during these same photosynthetic processes that remove the organic compounds. The use of H2S as a reducing agent by PSB removes it from the lagoon and leads to a reduction of odour and toxicity in the lagoons.\\"Hydrogen sulfide.\\" http://www.npi.gov.au/resource/hydrogen-sulfide National Pollutant Inventory, Australian Government Department of Environment and Energy, www.npi.gov.au/resource/hydrogen-sulfide.

Denvers keel was laid 7 July 1964 at Lockheed Shipbuilding and Construction Company, Seattle, Washington. She was launched 23 January 1965, christened by Mrs. Ann Daniels Love, wife of John A. Love, the former governor of Colorado, and commissioned 26 October 1968. After 46 years of service, the Denver was decommissioned at Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam on 14 August 2014. At the time of her decommissioning, Denver was the oldest deployable warship in the U.S. Navy, and was one of the last active warships to have served in Vietnam. History =Role in the SS Columbia Eagle mutiny= In 1970, USS Denver played a key role in the SS Columbia Eagle incident. When the SS Columbia Eagle was commandeered by two mutinous crew members on 14 March 1970, Denver was immediately dispatched to intercept and recapture Columbia Eagle. Denver never really caught up with Columbian Eagle, and sat outside the 12-mile limits of Cambodia (to where Columbia Eagle had been diverted) for a few days then departed the area. =Vietnam War, 1975= In April 1975, Denver participated in Operation Frequent Wind, the evacuation of Saigon, Vietnam. =Collision with USNS Yukon= On 13 July 2000, the ship was participating in a refueling exercise near the end of a deployment. Denver, off the coast of Oahu, collided with its refueling vessel, . Denvers bow was seriously damaged. It remained in port at Pearl Harbor undergoing repairs for two weeks. =Typhoon Morakot= Beginning on 17 August 2009 Denver started rendering humanitarian assistance to Taiwan due to the destruction caused by Typhoon Morakot. Denver was tasked independently to render aid, led by Captain Donald Schmieley along with two embarked squadrons, HM-14 and HSC-25. Cooperating closely with Taiwan Army and Air Force, they were supporting efforts by airlifting food, medical supplies, and providing heavy lift support for earth moving equipment to assist with recovery efforts. Due to the sensitive nature surrounding Taiwan, especially with the One China policy, the Department of Defense did not publicly announce relief efforts. Denver was planned to be in the vicinity of Taiwan until 22 August 2009 to render aid to the people of Taiwan. Denver had just completed Talisman Saber 2009 and was on her way to her homeport when she was directly tasked with this humanitarian mission. =2008 Hull Swap= In 2008 Denver replaced . The crew from USS Juneau took all relevant gear and documents from the Juneau and transferred them to Denver. Denver was then home-ported at Sasebo Naval Base, Japan, where it would remain until being decommissioned. =2009 Sumatra earthquakes= The Denver was sent to Sumatra to assist in the recovery efforts following the earthquakes there in September 2009. =2010= During the 2010 Fall Patrol, from 1 September to 25 November 2010, Denver accompanied and on a tour of Southeast Asia. During the patrol, Denver took part in the 60th anniversary of the invasion of Incheon, Korea and assisted the Philippines in the wake of Typhoon Megi. On 17 November, Denver, Essex and Harpers Ferry became the first U.S. warships to visit Hong Kong's Victoria Harbour in more than two years. =2011= The ship departed Sasebo in September 2011 for a patrol of the western Pacific. Accompanying the ship were and USS Essex. =2012= In fall 2012, the Denver departed for the 31st MEU fall patrol. During certification exercises around Guam the Denver's boilers suffered severe damage. After 3 weeks of repair at Guam, the Denver left to continue patrol. The Denver finished the patrol with limited power. =Decommissioning= Denver was decommissioned on 14 August 2014 at Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam in Hawaii. She had been the oldest active duty ship in the US Navy behind . Upon Denver's decommissioning, became the Navy's second oldest ship.

Career On New Year's Eve, 1963, 16-year-old Weir and an underage friend were wandering the back alleys of Palo Alto, looking for a club that would admit them, when they heard banjo music. They followed the music to its source, Dana Morgan's Music Store. Here, a young Jerry Garcia, oblivious to the date, was waiting for his students to arrive. Weir and Garcia spent the night playing music together and then decided to form a band. The Beatles significantly influenced their musical direction. \\"The Beatles were why we turned from a jug band into a rock 'n' roll band,\\" said Bob Weir. \\"What we saw them doing was impossibly attractive. I couldn't think of anything else more worth doing.\\"Jackson, Blair (2000).

In the fall of 1968, the Dead played some concerts without Weir and Ron \\"Pigpen\\" McKernan. These shows, with the band billed as \\"Mickey and the Hartbeats\\", were intermixed with full-lineup Grateful Dead concerts. In his biography of Jerry Garcia, Blair Jackson notes, \\"Garcia and Lesh determined that Weir and Pigpen were not pulling their weight musically in the band‚Ä¶ Most of the band fights at this time were about Bobby's guitar playing.\\"Jackson, Blair (2000).

DeadBase XI: The Complete Guide to Grateful Dead Song Lists, DeadBase, , p. 8 The incident apparently led to a period of significant growth in Weir's guitar playing. Phil Lesh said that when drummer Mickey Hart left the band temporarily in early 1971, he was able to hear Weir's playing more clearly than ever and \\"I found myself astonished, delighted and excited beyond measure at what Bobby was doing.\\" Lesh described Weir's playing as \\"quirky, whimsical and goofy\\" and noted his ability to play chord voicings on the guitar (with only four fingers) that one would normally hear from a keyboard (with up to ten fingers).Searching for the Sound, Phil Lesh In the late 1970s, Weir began to experiment with slide guitar techniques and perform certain songs during Dead shows using the slide. His unique guitar style is strongly influenced by the hard bop pianist McCoy Tyner and he has cited artists as diverse as John Coltrane, the Rev. Gary Davis, and Igor Stravinsky as influences. Weir's first solo album Ace appeared in 1972, with the Grateful Dead performing as the band on the album, though credited individually. Included in this line-up were Keith Godchaux and his wife Donna, both of whom would be in the band by the time of the album's release.

During the early 1970s, Weir also used a Gibson ES-345, a 1961 or 1962 Gibson SG and a black Gibson Les Paul of indeterminate age in 1971. In 1974, Weir began working with Jeff Hasselberger at Ibanez to develop a custom instrument. Weir began playing the Ibanez 2681 during the recording of Blues for Allah; this was a testbed instrument with sliding pickups that Hasselberger used to develop several additional 2681s for use onstage, as well as Weir's custom \\"Cowboy Fancy\\" guitar, which he played from 1976 until the mid-1980s. Weir began using a Modulus Blackknife at that point, and continued to play the Blackknife, along with a hybrid Modulus/Casio guitar for the \\"Space\\" segment of Grateful Dead concerts for the rest of that band's history. Weir's acoustic guitars include several Martins, a Guild, an Ovation, and a line of Alvarez-Yairi signature models.

GRO, at almost 35,000 pounds (16 Mg), was the heaviest payload deployed to date by the Shuttle Remote Manipulator System (RMS). The crew also conducted an unscheduled spacewalk to free the GRO high gain antenna, and conducted the first scheduled extravehicular activity in 5¬Ω years to test concepts for moving about large space structures. Several middeck experiments and activities were conducted including test of elements of a heat pipe to study fluid transfer processed in microgravity environments (SHARE), a chemical processing apparatus to characterize the structure of biological materials (BIMDA), and an experiment to grow larger and more perfect protein crystals than can be grown on the ground (PCG II). Atlantis carried amateur radio equipment for voice contact, fast scan and slow scan TV, and packet radio. Several hundred contacts were made with amateur radio operators around the world. Mission duration was 143 hours, 32 minutes, 44 seconds. STS-59 Endeavour (April 9 - April 20, 1994) was the Space Radar Laboratory (SRL) mission. SRL consisted of three large radars, SIR-C/X-SAR (Shuttle Imaging Radar C/X-Band Synthetic Aperture Radar), and a carbon monoxide sensor that were used to enhance studies of the Earth's surface and atmosphere. The imaging radars operated in three frequencies and four polarizations. This multispectral capability of the radars provided information about the Earth's surface over a wide range of scales not discernible with previous single- frequency experiments. The carbon monoxide sensor MAPS (Measurement of Air Pollution by Satellite) used gas filter radiometry to measure the global distribution of CO in the troposphere. Real-time crew observations of surface phenomena and climatic conditions augmented with over 14,000 photographs aided investigators in interpretation and calibration of the data. The mission concluded with a landing at Edwards AFB after orbiting the Earth 183 times in 269 hours, 29 minutes. Godwin is at top right in an EMU suit STS-76 Atlantis (March 22 - March 31, 1996) was the third docking mission to the Russian space station Mir. Following rendezvous and docking with Mir, transfer of a NASA astronaut to Mir for a 5-month stay was accomplished to begin a continuous presence of United States astronauts aboard Mir for the next two-year period. The crew also transferred 4800 pounds (2,200 kg) of science and mission hardware, food, water and air to Mir and returned over 1100 pounds (500 kg) of U.S. and ESA science and Russian hardware. Godwin performed a six-hour spacewalk, the first while docked to an orbiting space station, to mount experiment packages on the Mir docking module to detect and assess debris and contamination in a space station environment. The packages will be retrieved by a future shuttle mission. The Spacehab module carried in the Shuttle payload bay was utilized extensively for transfer and return stowage of logistics and science and also carried Biorack, a small multipurpose laboratory used during this mission for research of plant and animal cellular function. This mission was also the first flight of Kidsat, an electronic camera controlled by classroom students via a Ku-band link between JSC Mission Control and the Shuttle, which uses digital photography from the Shuttle for science and education. The STS-76 mission was accomplished in 145 orbits of the Earth, traveling 3.8 million miles (6.1 Gm) in 221 hours and 15 minutes. STS-108 Endeavour (December 5 - December 17, 2001) was the 12th shuttle flight to visit the International Space Station. Endeavour's crew delivered the Expedition-4 crew and returned the Expedition-3 crew. The crew unloaded over 3 short tons (2.7 Mg) of supplies, logistics and science experiments from the Raffaello Multi-Purpose Logistics Module and repacked over 2 short tons (1.8 Mg) of items no longer needed on the station for return to Earth. Godwin used the Shuttle's robotic arm to install the MPLM onto the Station Node, and participated in a spacewalk to wrap thermal blankets around ISS Solar Array Beta Gimbal Assemblies. STS-108 was accomplished in 185 Earth orbits, traveling 4.8 million miles (7.7 Gm) in 283 hours and 36 minutes.

Burroughs began writing it on February 28, 1929, and the finished story was first published in The Blue Book Magazine as a six-part serial in the issues for April to September 1930. It was later published as a complete novel by Metropolitan in May 1931. Plot summary Like many other Burroughs stories, A Fighting Man of Mars resembles The Arabian Nights. The story is purportedly relayed back to earth via the Gridley Wave, a sort of super radio frequency previously introduced in Tanar of Pellucidar, the third of Burrough's Pellucidar novels, which thus provides a link between the two series. The story-teller is Ulysses Paxton, protagonist of the previous novel, The Master Mind of Mars, but this story is not about him; rather, it is the tale of Tan Hadron of Hastor, a lowly, poor padwar (a low-ranking officer) who is in love with the beautiful, haughty Sanoma Tora, daughter of Tor Hatan, a minor but rich noble. As he is only a padwar, Sanoma spurns him. Then Sanoma Tora is kidnapped, and the novel moves into high gear. As Tan Hadron crosses Mars (\\"Barsoom\\", as Burroughs calls it) searching for Sanoma Tora, he encounters some of Barsoom's most ferocious beasts: huge, many-armed, flesh-eating white apes, gigantic spiders, and the insane cannibals of U-Gor. He also meets the mad scientist Phor Tak, who cackles \\"Heigh-oo!\\" and is crazed with the desire for revenge. The initial simplicity of Burroughs' well-worn pursuit plot is elaborated by Hadron's rescue of an escaped slave, Tavia, from a band of six-limbed Green Martians of Torquas, en route to the city of Jahar where Hadron believes Sanoma Tora has been taken. Tavia is an atypical Burroughs heroine; depicted as self-reliant and competent with weapons, witty and intelligent, she compares favorably for both reader and Hadron with beautiful but shallow Sanoma Tora, who ultimately shows herself unworthy of the virtuous hero. With the addition of Nur An, a disaffected Jaharian warrior, and another escaped woman slave, Phao, Hadron's quest becomes more collaborative than Burroughs' usual, although Tavia, in an unsurprising plot development, is revealed to be a princess at the end.

Both the prize and the foundation are named after the village of Bollingen, Switzerland, where Carl Jung had a country retreat, the Bollingen Tower. The inaugural prize, chosen by a jury of Fellows in American Letters of the Library of Congress, was awarded to Ezra Pound for his collection of poems The Pisan Cantos. The choice of a work by a man who had been a committed fascist sympathizer and who was then under indictment for treason in World War II for his antisemitic broadcasts infuriated many. A bitter controversy ensued in the press, and the Library of Congress was requested by a congressional committee to disassociate itself from the award.Britannica online.

Continuance through the Yale University Library The Bollingen Foundation decided to continue the program, with the administrative tasks being handled by the Yale University Library. The prize was awarded annually from 1948 to 1963. In 1963 the amount of the award was increased to $5,000, and thereafter it was given every other year. After 1968, when the Bollingen Foundation was dissolved, the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation took over. In 1973 the Mellon Foundation established an endowment of $100,000 to enable the Yale Library to continue awarding the prize in perpetuity. In 1961 a similar prize was set up by the Bollingen Foundation for best translation and it was won by Robert Fitzgerald for his translation of the Odyssey. It has also been won by Walter W.

Hexagonal stipe bases of the fern Cyathea medullaris An orchid's stipe, with pollinia The stipe of a brown alga In the case of ferns, the stipe is only the petiole from the rootstock to the beginning of the leaf tissue, or lamina. The continuation of the structure within the lamina is then termed a rachis. In flowering plants, the term is often used in reference to a stalk that sometimes supports a flower's ovary. In orchids, the stipe or caudicle is the stalk-like support of the pollinia. It is a non-viscid band or strap connecting the pollinia with the viscidium (the viscid part of the rostellum or beak). A stipe is also a structure found in organisms that are studied by botanists but that are no longer classified as plants. It may be the stem-like part of the thallus of a mushroom or a seaweed, and is particularly common among brown algae such as kelp. The stipe of a kelp often contains a central region of cells that, like the phloem of vascular plants, serves to transport nutrients within the alga.

A holdfast is a root-like structure that anchors aquatic sessile organisms, such as seaweed, other sessile algae, stalked crinoids, benthic cnidarians, and sponges, to the substrate. Holdfasts vary in shape and form depending on both the species and the substrate type. The holdfasts of organisms that live in muddy substrates often have complex tangles of root-like growths. These projections are called haptera and similar structures of the same name are found on lichens. The holdfasts of organisms that live in sandy substrates are bulb-like and very flexible, such as those of sea pens, thus permitting the organism to pull the entire body into the substrate when the holdfast is contracted. The holdfasts of organisms that live on smooth surfaces (such as the surface of a boulder) have flattened bases which adhere to the surface. The organism derives no nutrition from this intimate contact with the substrate, as the process of liberating nutrients from the substrate requires enzymatically eroding the substrate away, thereby increasing the risk of organism falling off the substrate. The claw-like holdfasts of kelps and other algae differ from the roots of land plants, in that they have no absorbent function, instead serving only as an anchor.Attenborough, D.1984.

National Hydrography Dataset high-resolution flowline data. The National Map , accessed May 26, 2011 through five counties in southwestern Ohio in the United States. The Little Miami joins the Ohio River east of Cincinnati. It forms parts of the borders between Hamilton and Clermont counties and between Hamilton and Warren counties. The Little Miami River is one of 156 American rivers designated by the U.S. Congress or the Secretary of the Interior as a National Wild and Scenic River and lends its name to the adjacent Little Miami Scenic Trail. Hydrography Watersheds of the Great Miami River (beige) and Little Miami River (yellow) The Little Miami River is a tributary of the Ohio River. It is part of a watershed that drains a area in 11 southwestern Ohio counties: Clark, Montgomery, Madison, Greene, Warren, Butler, Clinton, Clermont, Brown, and Highland. The river discharges on average into the Ohio River. An average of flow through the river proper; after heavy rains, the river flow may rise to . Tributaries of the Little Miami include Beaver Creek, Sugar Creek, the East Fork Little Miami, North Fork, Todd's Fork, Duck Creek, Caesar Creek, Massie Creek, and Turtle Creek. The river's main tributary, the East Fork of the Little Miami, was dammed in 1977 by the United States Army Corps of Engineers to create Harsha Lake, located in East Fork State Park. Similarly, in 1973, the Army Corps dammed Caesar Creek to create Caesar Creek Lake, located in Caesar Creek State Park. The river's headwaters, considered part of the North Fork, are located about from South Charleston in Clark County, near Plattsburgh. The river empties into the Ohio River at California, a neighborhood of Cincinnati in Hamilton County. Between the headwaters and the mouth, there is a decrease in elevation. History The Little Miami River is named for the Miami, an Algonquian-speaking Native American people who lived in the region during the early days of white settlement. Historically, the river formed the eastern boundary of the Symmes Purchase and the western boundary of the Virginia Military District. In 1967 The Ohio University Development Planning Institute (Athens, Ohio) published \\"The Little Miami of Ohio; A Study of a Wild and Scenic River\\". This 56-page booklet, illustrated with maps and black and white photographs, first presented the idea of a corridor of parks and natural areas along the river. In June 1967 Dayton newspaper editor Glenn Thompson would bring together educator Arthur Morgan, business leader Charles Sawyer, and outdoor enthusiast Corwin Fred to form Little Miami Incorporated, dedicated to the preservation of the Little Miami River. Mr. Thompson was the editor of the Dayton Journal-Herald in the late 1950s, and a strong advocate for the preservation of green space in the Miami Valley. The members of the newly formed Little Miami Incorporated would convince Ohio Congressman Clarence Brown to ask for inclusion of the Little Miami in the final list of 27 rivers to be studied for a proposed Scenic Rivers Bill. The 1968 Wild and Scenic River Act designated portions of the Little Miami National Scenic River as Ohio's first National Wild and Scenic River. On April 23 of following year, the Little Miami State Scenic River from Milford to the headwaters became Ohio's first State Scenic River, due to legislation that predated the national act by a few months. The remainder of the river was added to the State Scenic River in 1971. Hydropower of the Little Miami River was developed into the largest privately owned ammunition manufacturing center between New England and the Mississippi River. Company towns for the Miami Powder Company and Peters Cartridge Company were built at Goes Station and Kings Mills, respectively. The portion of Peters Cartridge Company factory on the opposite side of the river from Kings Mills in Hamilton Township, which closed in 1944 and is now owned by DuPont, was declared a Superfund site in 1996. Since then, studies by the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency have established that the site no longer poses an environmental hazard to the nearby river. Even so, the site was listed as a Superfund National Priorities List (NPL) site by the Environmental Protection Agency in April 2012 for copper, lead and mercury soil contamination. In September 2018, 15 acres of the 71 acre site was removed for the NPL after successful cleanup goals were achieved.EPA's Superfund Site Information for PETERS CARTRIDGE FACTORY, Environmental Protection Agency Ecology The Little Miami River passing through Clifton Gorge in John Bryan State Park, Greene County The Little Miami River is home to at least 87 species of fish, as well as many species of turtles, frogs, water snakes, birds, mammals and invertebrates. The river contains 36 species of mussels, including two threatened species, one of which is endangered. Ohio considers five of the species to be endangered. Recently, zebra mussels and Asiatic clams have crowded out native species. The river is protected by a number of nature preserves owned by Little Miami Inc., as well as by state and local parks (see below). Recreation The Little Miami River is a National Scenic River. A series of state and county parks and bike trails have been built along the river, primarily the Little Miami Scenic Trail, which is concurrent with the Buckeye Trail and Little Miami Scenic State Park. Most of these trails have been built along the abandoned rail grades that run along the river (see Rail trail). The Ohio to Erie Trail project, under construction, aims to link these trails to other trails statewide to create a single bike trail from Lake Erie to the Ohio River. The Little Miami is also popular among canoers and anglers. There are several canoe liveries along its course and the smallmouth bass fishing in the river is among the best in the state. For a river its size and considering that it drains mainly agricultural land, the water quality of the Little Miami River is excellent. Visitors may see a variety of wildlife including several varieties of turtles, mallards, and other ducks, Canada geese and blue herons.

A four- flight veteran, Gernhardt has logged over 43 days in space, including 4 spacewalks totaling 23 hours and 16 minutes. He was a mission specialist on STS-69 in 1995, STS-83 in 1997, STS-94 in 1997, and STS-104 in 2001. Gernhardt served as an aquanaut on the first NEEMO (NASA Extreme Environment Mission Operations) crew aboard the Aquarius underwater laboratory in October 2001. In April 2005, he was the commander of the NEEMO 8 mission. Gernhardt drove the lunar rover prototype at President Barack Obama's inaugural parade on January 20, 2009. On September 19, 2011, NASA announced that Gernhardt would participate in the NEEMO 15 mission in October 2011 from the DeepWorker submersible. The DeepWorker is a small submarine used as an underwater stand- in for the Space Exploration Vehicle, which might someday be used to explore the surface of an asteroid. In June 2012, Gernhardt piloted the DeepWorker as part of the NEEMO 16 mission, for which he was principal investigator. Spaceflight experience STS-69 took place from September 7‚Äì18, 1995. Its prime objective was the successful deployment and retrieval of a SPARTAN satellite and the Wake Shield Facility (WSF). The WSF was designed to evaluate the effectiveness of using this free-flying experiment to grow semiconductors, high temperature superconductors and other materials using the ultra-high vacuum created behind the spacecraft, near the experiment package. Gernhardt was one of two astronauts to perform a spacewalk to evaluate future Space Station tools and hardware, logging 6 hours and 46 minutes of EVA. Mission duration was 260 hours, 29 minutes, and 8 seconds, traveling 4.5 million miles in 171 orbits of the Earth. STS-83 took place from April 4‚Äì8, 1997. This was the Microgravity Science Laboratory (MSL-1) Spacelab mission, and it was cut short due to problems with one of the Shuttle's three fuel cell power generation units.

Brass knuckles are pieces of metal shaped to fit around the knuckles. Despite their name, they are often made from other metals, plastics or carbon fibers. Designed to preserve and concentrate a punch's force by directing it toward a harder and smaller contact area, they result in increased tissue disruption, including an increased likelihood of fracturing the intended target bones on impact. The extended and rounded palm grip also spreads across the attacker's palm the counter-force that would otherwise be absorbed primarily by the attacker's fingers, reducing the likelihood of damage to the attacker's fingers.

Vajra mushti has been practiced in India since at least 12th century and mentioned in Manasollasa. The Nihang Sikhs used an early variant called Sher Panja in the 18th century. Cast iron, brass, lead, and wood knuckles were made in the United States during the American Civil War (1861‚Äì1865). Soldiers would often buy cast iron or brass knuckles. If they could not buy them, they would carve their own from wood, or cast them at camp by melting lead bullets and using a mold in the dirt. Some brass knuckles have rounded rings, which increase the impact of blows from moderate to severe damage. Other instruments (not generally considered to be \\"brass knuckles\\" or \\"metal knuckles\\" per se) may have spikes, sharp points and cutting edges. These devices come in many variations and are called by a variety of names, including \\"knuckle knives.\\" By the late 19th century, knuckledusters were incorporated into various kinds of pistols such as the Apache revolver used by criminals in France in the late 19th to early 20th centuries. During World War I the US Army issued two different knuckle knives, the US model 1917 and US model 1918 Mark I trench knives. Knuckles and knuckle knives were also being made in England at the time and purchased privately by British soldiers. By World War II, knuckles and knuckle knives were quite popular with both American and British soldiers. The Model 1918 trench knives were reissued to American paratroopers. British Commandos even had their very own \\"Death's Head\\" knuckle knife, featuring a skull-shaped brass knuckle handle.

A shimmy is a dance move in which the body is held still, except for the shoulders, which are quickly alternated back and forth. When the right shoulder goes back, the left one comes forward. It may help to hold the arms out slightly bent at the elbow, and when the shoulders are moved, keep the hands in the same position.  History  In 1917, a dance-song titled \\"Shim-Me-Sha-Wabble\\" by Spencer Williams was published, as was \\"The Jazz Dance\\", which included the \\"Shimmy-She\\", among others. Gilda Gray attributed to American Indians in a 1919 interview with Variety saying \\"You may not believe it but the original shimmy dance has never been properly introduced in New York. I know, for I have studied the dancing characteristics of the Indians for a long time and they are really responsible for the shimmy which they labeled the 'Shima Shiwa'. There have been continual efforts on the part of this dancer and that one, with each declaring that his or her version is the 'original.' There is no doubt but that the shimmy dance as it was constructed by the American Indian... would have a greater popularity if done right.\\" \\"I Wish I Could Shimmy Like My Sister Kate\\" was an up-tempo jazz dance song, written by Clarence Williams and Armand Piron, and published in 1919 which has been enduringly popular ever since and performed and recorded by many artists. Flappers often performed the dance in the 1920s. The origin of the name is often attributed to Gilda Gray, a Polish emigrant to America. An anecdote says that when she was asked about her dancing style, she answered, in heavy accent, \\"I'm shaking my chemise\\". However, in an interview Gilda denied having said this, and earlier usages of the word are recorded. In the late 1910s, others were also attributed as being the \\"inventor\\" of the shimmy, including Bee Palmer. Mae West, in her autobiography Goodness Had Nothing to Do with It, claimed to have retitled the \\"Shimmy-Shawobble\\" as the Shimmy herself, after seeing the moves in some black nightclubs. The dance was often considered to be obscene and was frequently banned from dance halls during the 1920s. The move is also known in Gypsy dances. In Russian this move is called \\"Tsyganochka\\", or \\"gypsy girl\\", and is done by gypsy female dancers to produce a chime of costume decorations made of the sewn-on coins. The dance move with this name is used in various modern dances. In the early 1960s, several dance songs featuring the Shimmy became hits, including Bobby Freeman's \\"Shimmy, Shimmy\\", the Olympics' \\"Shimmy Like Kate\\", and Little Anthony & the Imperials' \\"Shimmy Shimmy Ko-ko Bop\\".  Belly dance  The shimmy is also a class of belly dance moves. Depending on the desired effect, style, teacher, and country of origin of the particular dance, a shimmy might be executed differently, but altogether, the shimmy will manifest as a fast shaking or shuddering movement that can be rhythmic or arrhythmic. The movement may be localized, such as in the hips, shoulder, chest, etc., or the move might be loose and general, reverberating through the entire body. Shimmies in belly dance can also have orientation, such as an up/down movement or a twisting movement of the hips.

The ecoregion covers an area of 34,630 sq miles (89,691 km2) encompassing the Piedmont and coastal plain of seven states, extending from coastal southwestern Maine, southeastern New Hampshire, eastern Massachusetts, and Rhode Island, southward through Connecticut, New York State, New Jersey, southeast Pennsylvania, Delaware and Maryland. The ecoregion is bounded on the east by the Atlantic Ocean. To the north, it transitions to the New England- Acadian forests, which cover most of northern and inland New England. To the west, the ecoregion transitions to Allegheny Highlands forests and the Appalachian-Blue Ridge forests of the Appalachian Mountains. To the south lie the Southeastern mixed forests and the Middle Atlantic coastal forests. The ecoregion surrounds the distinct Atlantic coastal pine barrens ecoregion, which covers portions of New Jersey, Long Island and Cape Cod in southeastern Massachusetts. Climate The climate in this ecoregion is the broad transition from the humid continental in the north to the humid subtropical climate in the south. Flora Oak forests dominate this ecoregion. American chestnut (Castanea dentata) was formerly important, but its population was devastated by the chestnut blight early in the 20th century. =Dry-mesic oak forests= Northeastern interior dry-mesic oak forests are found throughout this ecoregion. They cover large areas at low and middle elevations, typically on flat to gently rolling terrain. Red oak (Quercus rubra), white oak (Quercus alba), and black oak (Quercus velutina) are common oaks in this habitat. Other trees include hickories (Carya spp.), red maple (Acer rubrum), sugar maple (Acer saccharum), white ash (Fraxinus americana), tulip tree (Liriodendron tulipifera), American beech (Fagus grandifolia), black cherry (Prunus serotina), black birch (Betula lenta), black tupelo (Nyssa sylvatica), and American elm (Ulmus americana). Flowering dogwood (Cornus florida) is a common understory tree. common shrubs are maple-leaved viburnum (viburnum acerifolium), spicebush (Lindera benzoin), and witch hazel (Hamamelis virginiana). In sandier or more acidic soils are mountain laurel (Kalmia latifolia), blueberry (Vaccinium pallidum), huckleberry (Gaylussacia baccata), and swamp azalea (Rhododendron viscosum). Mayapple (Podophyllum peltatum) is a common herbaceous plant. =Hemlock-northern hardwood forests= Hemlock- northern hardwood forests occur in deep coves, moist flats, and ravines. They include sugar maple, yellow birch (Betula alleghaniensis), and beech. These trees often form a deciduous canopy, but are sometimes mixed with hemlock (Tsuga canadensis) or white pine (Pinus strobus). Other common trees include oaks (most commonly red oak), tuliptree, black cherry, and sweet birch. In the Northeast, red spruce (Picea rubens) can be a minor canopy associate. Hophornbeam (Ostrya virginiana) is frequent but not dominant. =Dry oak-pine forests= Central Appalachian dry oak-pine forests occur on dry sites with loamy to sandy soils. A mix of oak and pine tree species dominate the canopy, typically chestnut oak (Quercus prinus), Virginia pine (Pinus virginiana), and white pine (Pinus strobus), but sometimes white oak (Quercus alba) or scarlet oak (Quercus coccinea). Varying amounts of oaks and pines result in oak forests, mixed oak-pine forests, or small pine forests. Shrubs such as hillside blueberry (Vaccinium pallidum), black huckleberry (Gaylussacia baccata), and mountain laurel (Kalmia latifolia) are common in the understory and can form a dense layer. =Pine-oak rocky woodlands= Central Appalachian pine-oak rocky woodlands occur on lower-elevation hilltops, outcrops, and rocky slopes and have a patchy or open aspect. Pitch pine (Pinus rigida) and Virginia pine (Pinus virginiana) are common within their respective ranges. These pines are often mixed with dry-site oaks such as chestnut oak (Quercus prinus), bear oak (Quercus ilicifolia), northern red oak (Quercus rubra), and scarlet oak (Quercus coccinea). Sprouts of chestnut (Castanea dentata) can also be found. In the northeast, eastern red-cedar (Juniperus virginiana) or hophornbeam (Ostrya virginiana) are sometimes important. In the understory, some areas have a fairly well-developed heath shrub layer, others a graminoid layer, the latter particularly common under deciduous trees such as oaks. Harriman State Park in New York. =Successional plant communities= These occur in formerly cleared land, such as old farms, that have been abandoned. Eastern red cedar (Juniperus virginiana) are some of the first trees to occupy these lands. =Freshwater wetlands= Marshes occur where standing water is present for most of the year. Common reed (Phragmites australis) and cattails (Typha spp.) are often abundant. Swamps and floodplains occur where standing water is present for only some parts of the year. Red maple is a common tree, and can be found with swamp tupelo, white ash, American elm, pin oak (Quercus palustris), swamp white oak (Quercus bicolor), and silver maple (Acer saccharinum). Spicebush is a common shrub. Skunk cabbage (Symplocarpus foetidus) is found here. Fauna Some of the animals that live in the Northeastern coastal deciduous forests are white-tailed deer, eastern gray squirrels, chipmunks, red foxes, sparrows, chickadees, copperheads, rattlesnakes, northern water snakes, box turtles, snapping turtles, garter snakes, snails, coyotes, black bears, beavers, woodchucks and raccoons. Chickadees, white-tailed deer, and eastern gray squirrels can be seen quite often. Gray wolves used to be quite common, but are extirpated, causing endemic growth in deer populations near suburban areas, with eastern coyotes generally taking their place by the mid-20th century. Moose may also be seen in some of the northernmost regions of the Northeastern coastal forests, though this is very, very rare.https://patch.com/massachusetts/worcester/moose-comeback-massachusetts- map-shows-sightings-deaths Areas of intact habitat The following natural areas are within this ecoregion * New Hampshire ** Bear Brook State Park ** Pawtuckaway State Park * Massachusetts ** Douglas State Forest ** Freetown- Fall River State Forest ** Hockomock Swamp ** Parker River National Wildlife Refuge ** Frederick Weston Memorial Forest ** Wompatuck State Park * Rhode Island ** Arcadia Management Area ** Great Swamp Management Area * Connecticut ** Meshomasic State Forest ** Natchaug State Forest ** Pachaug State Forest ** Yale-Myers Forest * New York ** Bear Mountain State Park ** Black Rock Forest ** Clarence Fahnestock State Park ** Harriman State Park ** Hudson Highlands State Park ** Oyster Bay National Wildlife Refuge ** Sterling Forest State Park ** Storm King State Park * New Jersey ** Abram S.

He won the 1996 World Series with the New York Yankees over his hometown Atlanta Braves and played in the 2006 World Series with the Detroit Tigers. In addition to being known for his fielding (winning 5 Gold Glove Awards), he pitched the 14th perfect game in MLB history. In 2008, he was the oldest baseball player in the American League. Rogers is nicknamed The Gambler, after a song made famous by a singer who also shares his name. Biography Rogers was born in Savannah, Georgia and grew up on a farm in Dover, Florida.1991 Topps baseball card #332 Rogers and his wife, Rebecca Lewis, reside in Westlake, Texas, with their two children. He enjoys golf, fishing and building houses for Habitat for Humanity. Baseball Career Rogers graduated from Plant City High School in Florida in 1982, where he played baseball only during his senior season, hitting .375 as a right fielder (he played shortstop in his senior league). He was selected by the Texas Rangers in the 39th round of the 1982 Major League Baseball draft, and signed for $1,000. He was converted into a pitcher on the strength of his throwing arm and left-handedness. Rogers spent 7 years in the minor leagues before making it to the Rangers in 1989 as a reliever. He became a starting pitcher for the club in 1993. During Rogers' career, he played for the: Texas Rangers (1989‚Äì95, 2000‚Äì02, 2004‚Äì05), New York Yankees (1996‚Äì97), Oakland Athletics (1998‚Äì99), New York Mets (1999), Minnesota Twins (2003), and Detroit Tigers (2006‚Äì08). With the Detroit Tigers in 2006, he won 17 regular season games, and excelled in the post-season with 23 straight scoreless innings over his 3 starts. He's one of only 3 pitchers in Rangers history through 2009 to win at least 17 games in 31 starts or fewer (set back in 1995), along with Scott Feldman (also in 2009) and Ferguson Jenkins (18 wins in 30 starts in 1978). =Oakland Athletics= Rogers was acquired by the Oakland Athletics from the Yankees for third baseman Scott Brosius in Billy Beane's first trade as general manager. Rogers led the Oakland pitching staff in his first season in innings (238.7) and wins (16). The next season, he started 19 games, winning only 5 with a 4.30 ERA. He was traded at the deadline to the New York Mets for Terrence Long and a minor league player. =New York Mets= During his short tenure, Rogers started 12 games during the regular season, winning 5 and losing 1, compiling a 4.03 earned run average. He's best remembered in a Mets uniform for walking in the series winning run against the Atlanta Braves in Game 6 of the 1999 NLCS, costing the Mets the series. =Texas Rangers= After the 1999 season, Rogers signed with the Texas Rangers. On June 29th, 2005, after walking out onto Ameriquest Field for a pre-game warmup against the LA Angels, Rogers shoved two cameramen,ESPN ‚Äì Rangers pitcher threatens and confronts cameramen ‚Äì MLB knocking one camera to the ground. One of the reporters resumed filming after picking up said camera, which angered Rogers into shoving him again, after grabbing and throwing the camera to the ground, kicking it. He was then led away by a teammate and later sent home by the Club. Larry Rodriguez (the assaulted cameraman) of Dallas/Fort Worth Metroplex' Fox Network affiliate KDFW was taken to a local hospital, complaining of shoulder, arm and leg pain. While in the hospital, Rodriguez made an official complaint of assault against Rogers. Two days after the incident, Commissioner Bud Selig suspended Rogers for 20 games and fined him $50,000. While an appeal of his suspension was pending, Rogers appeared at the 2005 All-Star Game in Detroit. The suspension was subsequently upheld by Selig. The commissioner was later overruled by independent arbitor Shyam Das, allowing Rogers to return to play after sitting out 13 games. On July 18th 2005, Rogers was charged with a Class A misdemeanor assault charge with regard to Rodriguez and a Class C misdemeanor assault charge with regard to the second, FSN Southwest, cameraman David Mammeli. Rogers was cited and released on $1,500 bond. The Class A charge was later reduced to Class C following Rogers' completion of an anger management course. On August 11th 2005, Rogers returned to the mound against the Boston Red Sox in Fenway Park. Rogers allowed 5 runs and 7 hits during 5 innings, on the way to a 16‚Äì5 Boston victory. He finished 2005 with a 3.46 ERA in 195 innings. Shortly after the regular season ended, the Rangers announced Rogers would not return to the team. On October 5th, 2005, Rodriguez filed a civil suit against Rogers and the Rangers, seeking an unspecified amount of monetary damages. =Signing with Detroit= Rogers warming up prior to a rehab start with the West Michigan Whitecaps, Single-A affiliates of the Detroit Tigers in 2007. On December 8th 2005, Rogers signed a two-year, $16 million contract with the Detroit Tigers. Rogers ended the 2006 regular season with a record of 17‚Äì8 and a 3.84 ERA. \\"We've needed a guy like that for a long time. I'm glad we went out and got him...He means a lot to our team and to guys like me,\\" said Tigers starter Jeremy Bonderman on Rogers. Rogers, on his first year in Detroit: \\"There's a lot of benefits here, by far, that you wouldn't know as a visiting player, and for me, I've been around quite a while, but I appreciate the town, the city, the people. The travel for a baseball player is very hard, but here it's not that difficult. It lends itself to being able to relax on certain days that you could get off. There's just more benefits, especially when you have the quality of people here like Dombrowski and like we have in Mr. Ilitch, those things that you can't take for granted. You add in Jim Leyland and the coaching staff here, and I just got lucky to choose this place...Right when I went in the door and met them, I knew. I knew where I was going to end up.\\" On March 30th 2007, ESPN reported that Rogers would miss 3 months after undergoing surgery for a blood clot in his pitching shoulder. He made his return on June 22nd against the Atlanta Braves, pitching 6 scoreless innings and allowing 2 hits while earning his first win of the season. =2006 postseason= On October 6th 2006, Rogers won his first postseason game, pitching 7 scoreless innings with 8 strikeouts in a 6‚Äì0 Tigers victory against the Yankees in Game 3 of the American League Division Series.

A week later on October 13th, Rogers retired 9 batters in a row, in Game 3 of the American League Championship Series against the Oakland Athletics, allowing only 2 hits and 2 walks in 7 scoreless innings, while striking out 6 and pacing the Tigers to a 3‚Äì0 victory, leaving the Tigers 1 win away from their first World Series appearance since 1984. Rogers started Game 2 of the 2006 World Series on October 22nd 2006\\\\. \\"We wanted Kenny to pitch 2 games at home,\\" Leyland said. He left the game with the Tigers in the lead 3‚Äì0, pitching 8 shutout innings, retiring 10 straight batters, striking out 5, allowing only 2 hits and 3 walks, making him the oldest starting pitcher to win a World Series game,Associated Press and 1 of only 2 pitchers over the age of 40 to do so (Curt Schilling would become the second in 2007). During the first inning, Fox cameras caught a smudge on Rogers' pitching hand. Rogers said it was dirt mixed with rosin from the rosin bag and wiped it off. MLB spokesperson Rich Levin said the incident was investigated, and the substance was described as dirt. Since it's not ruled a foreign substance, per Rule 8.02, Rogers remained in the game.The Official Site of Major League Baseball: News: Major League Baseball News In the process, Rogers extended his streak to 23 shutout innings. Examination of images from previous games revealed similar smudges in 2 other games. =Retirement= After injuries shortened his 2007‚Äì08 seasons, Rogers ceased playing at the end of 2008. With 219 career victories, he became the 7th 200-game winner who never won 20 games in any single season, joining Milt Pappas, Jerry Reuss, Frank Tanana, Charlie Hough, Dennis Mart√≠nez and Chuck Finley. Tim Wakefield joined the group with his 200th win in 2011. Mike Mussina reached 200 wins without having a 20-win season, but recorded a 20-win season afterward. On August 6th 2011, Rogers was enshrined into the Texas Rangers Hall of Fame. In 2010, Rogers served as a pitching coach for the Detroit Tigers during spring training. According to remarks by Justin Verlander and Jim Leyland, his ability to coach pitchers on fielding would be particularly of interest to the team. In 2011, Rogers threw out the ceremonial first pitch at Comerica Park in Game 3 of the ALDS. Rogers reportedly never formally retired from Major League Baseball. Accomplishments =Perfect game= Rogers pitched the 14th perfect game in baseball history on July 28, 1994 with the Rangers against the California Angels (the last no-hitter in Rangers history to date, and the only perfect game in franchise history). Soon after his feat, he appeared on ABC's Good Morning America on July 29, 1994, and on CBS's Late Show with David Letterman on August 1, 1994. He also met and appeared with musician Kenny Rogers at a function in Arlington, Texas on August 13, 1994. Rogers' 1994 perfect game was caught by Iv√°n Rodr√≠guez, who in June 2007 caught the no-hitter of Detroit Tiger Justin Verlander, both of whom were teammates of Rogers at the time. The game took place exactly three years to the day of the last perfect game, pitched by Dennis Mart√≠nez of the Montreal Expos on July 28, 1991. =Gold Gloves= Known as one of the finest fielding pitchers in baseball, Rogers won 5 Gold Glove Awards at pitcher, including 4 with the Rangers and 1 with the Tigers. He was honored with a Fielding Bible Award in 2008 as the top fielding pitcher in MLB.

She was born in Cairo as Lena Westropp, the daughter of a wealthy expatriate British family, and her early years ensured that she had a wide experience of culture. However, she was sent to England to Downe House, a girls' boarding school which specialised in the daughters of colonial servants. She was promising academically and attended Somerville College, Oxford and the University of Heidelberg. During the Second World War she was an organiser for the Women's Voluntary Service and the Land Army. She married twice, firstly Henry Peat, and then John Townsend. In 1955 she was first elected to the London County Council for her home seat of Hampstead, and took a special interest in the Education Committee. She was chosen to be Leader of the Opposition on the Education Committee from the early 1960s. Townsend was an unsuccessful candidate in the first Greater London Council election of 1964, being defeated in Camden. However, in 1967 she was more fortunate and won by about 4,000 votes. This brought with it membership of the LCC Education Committee's successor body, the Inner London Education Authority, and it was there that Townsend concentrated. The Conservatives had won narrow control of ILEA and Townsend ran for the Leadership, but lost to Christopher Chataway who was the preferred candidate of the Conservative Party nationally. Chataway did make Townsend his Deputy, and Chairman of the Schools Committee. The two worked well as a team, with both clearly on the left of the Conservative Party. Townsend supported 'Schools Councils' for pupils to take some responsibility for the management of their schools. She was nominated as a member of the Race Relations Board Conciliation Committee for London in 1968. She was a founder member of the Conservative Group for Europe. In 1969 Christopher Chataway was elected to Parliament in a byelection, and stepped down from the ILEA Leadership. Townsend was chosen as his successor, and largely continued his moderate policies. When Christian morality campaigner Mary Whitehouse attacked a BBC sex education film, Townsend defended it. She was however faced with a strike of teachers in November that year over a national pay claim. Fighting for re-election in 1970, Townsend promoted the record of three years of Conservative ILEA by pointing to the success in reducing class sizes by employing more teachers. However, there was a small swing to Labour, who regained control; Townsend lost her seat in Camden but was elected as an Alderman to the GLC and co-opted to ILEA's Education Committee. She remained as Leader of the Opposition until February 1971 when she resigned, saying that she needed a paying job. Townsend remained an Alderman of the GLC until 1977 when the Aldermanic system was abolished. She was a member of several bodies, most prominently as a Governor of the London College of Fashion (and Chair of Governors from 1967 to 1986). In Edward Heath's Dissolution Honours list of 1974 she was awarded a CBE. Keeping the links with the country of her birth, she was President of the Anglo-Egyptian Association from 1961 until it was wound up in 1987.

Andover Theological Seminary and Newton Theological Institution merged in 1965 to form the Andover Newton Theological School (1965-2018). In its original and merged forms, it was the first and thus the oldest theological seminary founded in the United States. The seminary continues as Andover Newton Seminary at Yale Divinity School launched in 2017. History Andover Theological Seminary traces its roots to the late 18th century and the desire for a well-educated clergy among Congregationalists in the United States. That desire was expressed in the founding of Phillips Academy in 1778 for \\"the promotion of true Piety and Virtue\\". In 1806, a growing split within the Congregational churches, known as the Unitarian Controversy, came to a full boil on the campus of Harvard College. The Hollis Chair of Divinity sat empty at Harvard for two years owing to tensions between liberal and more orthodox Calvinists. This theological battle soon divided many of the oldest churches in Massachusetts and began to impact church polity and the hiring of ministers. When the Harvard Board of Overseers appointed well-known liberal Henry Ware to the Hollis Chair in 1805, the Calvinists withdrew to organize and establish a new school in 1807, Andover Theological Seminary on the campus of Phillips Academy (est. 1778) in Andover, Massachusetts. This act, covered widely in the national press, was one of the significant events that contributed to the split in the denomination and to the eventual founding of the American Unitarian Association in 1825 (which joined the Universalists, founded in 1793, to become the Unitarian Universalist Association in 1961). Andover was founded by the joint efforts of traditionalist, \\"Old Calvinists\\" and the adherents of the New Divinity (also known as New England theology) which was more revivalistic. Leonard Woods, Moses Stuart, and Edward Dorr Griffin were early faculty. Between 1886 and 1892, a theological dispute known as the \\"Andover Controversy\\" broke out between the conservative \\"New England Calvinism\\" of the founders and the liberal theology of many on the faculty. President E. C. Smyth was investigated and dismissed for his liberal views in 1887, but in 1891 his dismissal was reversed, on technical grounds, by the Massachusetts Supreme Court, and the matter was dropped the following year. = Relocations and merger = In 1908, Harvard Divinity School and Andover attempted to reconcile, and the seminary moved its faculty and library to the Harvard campus (and soon into Andover Hall [1911]). Plans for a formal affiliation between the academies were made, but the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts disallowed the alliance since Andover's endowment is designated for a Christian theological education. Andover, therefore, relocated to the campus of Newton Theological Institution in 1931. Andover Theological Seminary and the Newton Theological Institution formally merged in 1965 as the Andover Newton Theological School (ANTS). Newton Theological Institution began instruction in 1825 at Newton Centre, Massachusetts as a graduate seminary formally affiliated with the group now known as American Baptist Churches USA, the oldest Baptist denomination in America. As the institution developed, it adopted Andover's curricular pattern and shared the same theological tradition of loyalty to the evangelical Gospel and zeal for its dissemination. In November 2015, ANTS announced that it would sell its campus and relocate to Yale Divinity School, after a presence of 190 years on that site. = Historical influence on Protestant missions = Prior to the founding of Andover and Newton, the model for the training of clergy was based on an undergraduate degree (actually the basis for the founding of most of the early colleges in the United States). The graduate model and the three year curriculum with a resident student body and resident faculty pioneered at Andover and Newton has become the standard for almost all of the 140 Protestant theological schools in the country. Reflecting that zeal, the modern missionary movement began in this country through a group of Andover students known as the Brethren. Both Andover and Newton quickly assumed leadership in the modern mission movement, drawing the two schools into close association of people and ideas. Graduates such as Luther Rice and Hiram Bingham pioneered in Christian missions around the world. Adoniram Judson, an 1810 Andover alumnus, is best known for his work in Burma, where he translated the Bible into Burmese and produced the first Burmese-English dictionary.

This substituent form is obtained by removing one hydrogen atom attached to the terminal carbon of propane. A propyl substituent is often represented in organic chemistry with the symbol Pr (not to be confused with the element praseodymium).

The Mordvins comprise one of the more numerous indigenous peoples of Russia. They identify themselves as separate ethnic groups: * Erzya * Moksha * Teryukhan * Tengushev (or Shoksha) Mordvins who became fully Russified or Turkified during the 19th to 20th centuries Less than one third of Mordvins live in the autonomous republic of Mordovia; the rest are scattered over the Russian oblasts of Samara, Penza, Orenburg and Nizhny Novgorod, while others live in Tatarstan, Chuvashia, Bashkortostan, Central Asia, Siberia, the Russian Far East, Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan, Armenia and the United States. The Erzya Mordvins (, Erzyat; also Erzia, Erza), who speak Erzya, and the Moksha Mordvins (, Mokshet), who speak Moksha, are the two major groups. The Qaratay Mordvins live in the Kama Tamaƒüƒ± District of Tatarstan and speak a Tatar language - albeit with a large proportion of Mordvin vocabulary (substratum). The Teryukhan, living in the Nizhny Novgorod Oblast of Russia, switched to using Russian in the 19th century. The Teryukhans recognize the term Mordva as pertaining to themselves, whereas the Qaratay also call themselves Muksha. The Tengushev Mordvins live in southern Mordovia and form a transitional group between Moksha and Erzya. The western Erzyans are also called Shoksha (or Shoksho). They are isolated from the bulk of the Erzyans, and the Mokshan dialects have influenced their dialect/language. Names thumbMordva populi (Mordva people) shown on a 1550 map by Giacomo Gastaldi as residing south of Kasimov and Nizhny Novgorod While Robert G. Latham had identified Mordva as a self-designation, identifying it as a variant of the name Mari, Aleksey Shakhmatov in the early 20th century noted that Mordva was not used as a self-designation by the two Mordvinic tribes of the Erzya and Moksha. Nikolai Mokshin again states that the term has been used by the people as an internal self-defining term to constitute their common origin. The linguist G√°bor Zaicz underlines that the Mordvins do not use the name 'Mordvins' as a self-designation. Feoktistov wrote \\"So-called Tengushev Mordvins are Erzyans who speak [the] Erzyan dialect with Mokshan substratum and in fact they are [an ethnic] group of Erzyans usually referred to as Shokshas. [It] was [the] Erzyans who historically [were] referred to as Mordvins, and Mokshas usually were mentioned separately as \\"Mokshas\\".

A land called Mordia at a distance of ten days journey from the Petchenegs is mentioned in Constantine VII's De administrando imperio. In medieval European sources, the names Merdas, Merdinis, Merdium, Mordani, Mordua, Morduinos have appeared. In the Russian Primary Chronicle, the ethnonyms Mordva and mordvichi first appear in the 11th century. After the Mongol invasion of Rus', the name Mordvin rarely gets mentioned in Russian annals, and is only quoted after the Primary Chronicle up until the 15th‚Äì17th centuries.(Kirjanov 1971, 148‚Äì149) LasloKappeler (1982) Taagepera =Etymologies= The name Mordva is thought to originate from an Iranian (Scythian) word, mard, meaning \\"man\\". The Mordvin word mirde denoting a husband or spouse is traced to the same origin. This word is also probably related to the final syllable of \\"Udmurt\\", and also in and perhaps even in . The first written mention of Erzya is considered to be in a letter dated to 968 AD, by Joseph, the Khazar khagan, in the form of arisa, and sometimes thought to appear in the works of Strabo and Ptolemy as Aorsy and Arsiity, respectively. Estakhri, from the 10th century, has recorded among the three groups of the Rus people the al-arsanija, whose king lived in the town of Arsa. The people have sometimes been identified by scholars as Erzya, sometimes as the aru people, and also as Udmurts. It has been suggested by historians that the town Arsa may refer to either the modern Ryazan or Arsk In the 14th century, the name Erzya is considered to have been mentioned in the form of ardzhani by Rashid-al-Din Hamadani,(Sbornik... 1941, 96) see L√°szl√≥ and as rzjan by Jusuf, the Nogaj khan(Safargaliev 1964, 12) L√°szl√≥ In Russian sources, the ethnonym Erza first appears in the 18th century.(Mokshin 1977, 47) L√°szl√≥ The earliest written mention of Moksha, in the form of Moxel, is considered to be in the works of a 13th-century Flemish traveler, William of Rubruck, and in the Persian chronicle of Rashid-al-Din, who reported the Golden Horde to be at war with the Moksha and the Ardzhans (Erzia). In Russian sources, 'Moksha' appears from the 17th century.(Mokshin 1977, 47)L√°szl√≥ Ethnic structure The Mordvins are divided into two ethnic subgroups and three further subgroups:Mokshin (1995), p. 43. Latham in his account of the \\"Native Races of the Russian Empire\\" (1854) divided the Mordvins into three groups, viz. the Ersad, on the Oka River, the Mokshad, on the Sura River and the Karatai, in the neighbourhood of Kazan. * the Erzya people or Erzyans, (Erzya: –≠—Ä–∑—è—Ç/Erzyat), speakers of the Erzya language. Less than half of the Erzyans live in the autonomous republic of Mordovia, Russian Federation, Sura River and Volga River. The rest are scattered over the Russian oblasts of Samara, Penza, Orenburg, as well as Tatarstan, Chuvashia, Bashkortostan, Siberia, Far East, Armenia and USA. * the Moksha people or Mokshans, (Moksha: –ú–æ–∫—à–µ—Ç/Mokshet), speakers of the Moksha language. Less than half of the Moksha population live in the autonomous republic of Mordovia, Russian Federation, in the basin of the Volga River. The rest are scattered over the Russian oblasts of Samara, Penza, Orenburg, as well as Tatarstan, Siberia, Far East, Armenia, Estonia, Australia and USA. *the Shoksha or Tengushev Mordvins constitute a transitional group between the Erzya and Moksha people and live in the southern part of Republic of Mordovia, in the Tengushevsk and Torbeevsk region. *the Karatai Mordvins or Qaratays live in the Republic of Tatarstan. They no longer speak a Volga-Finnic language but have assimilated with Tatars. *the Teryukhan Mordvins live near Nizhny Novgorod had been completely Russified by 1900 and today unambiguously identify as ethnic Russians. Mokshin concludes that the above grouping does not represent subdivisions of equal ethnotaxonomic order, and discounts Shoksha, Karatai and Teryukhan as ethnonyms, identifying two Mordvin sub-ethnicities, the Erzya and the Moksha, and two \\"ethnographic groups\\", the Shoksha and the Karatai.\\"the ethnic structure of the Mordva people at present reveals two subethnoses ‚Äì Erzia and Moksha ‚Äì and two ethnographic groups ‚Äì so-called Shoksha and Karatai\\" Mokshin (1995), p. 43 Two further formerly Mordvinic groups have assimilated to (Slavic and Turkic) superstrate influence: *The Meshcheryaks are believed to be Mordvins who have converted to Russian Orthodox Christianity and have adopted the Russian language. *The Mishars are Mordvins who came under Tatar influence and adopted the language (Mishar Tatar dialect) and the Sunni Muslim religion.Tengushev Mordvins, Karatai Mordvins, Teryukhan Mordvins, Meshcheryaks, Mishars in Religion Erzya practices Christianity (Eastern Orthodox and Lutheranism brought by Finnish missionaries in the 1990s) and Ineshkipaza, a native monotheistic religion with some elements of pantheism. Almost all national-oriented intellectuals practice Ineshkipazia or Lutheranism. Mariz‚Äô Kemal, well-known Erzyan poetess, is also an organizer of traditional Erzyan religion communities. This phenomenon appeared after formation of Mordovian diocese of ROC in 1990. In those days Erzyan intellectuals were hoping to introduce of Erzyan language into worship ceremonies as well as to revive of Erzyan religious and cultural identity, even within ROC structure. Failure of these hopes made many Erzyan believers more radical and stimulated national-oriented intellectuals to renew their ethnic Ineshkipaza religion. Appearance Erzya women of Penza Oblast dressed in traditional costumes The 1911 Britannica noted that the Mordvins, although they had largely abandoned their language, had \\"maintained a good deal of their old national dress, especially the women, whose profusely embroidered skirts, original hair-dress large ear-rings which sometimes are merely hare-tails, and numerous necklaces covering all the chest and consisting of all possible ornaments, easily distinguish them from Russian women.\\" Britannica described the Mordvins as having mostly dark hair and blue eyes, with a rather small and narrow build. The Moksha were described as having a darker skin and darker eyes than the Erzya, while the Qaratays were described as \\"mixed with Tatars\\". Latham described the Mordvins as taller than the Mari, with thin beards, flat faces and brown or red hair, red hair being more frequent among the Ersad than the Mokshad. James Bryce described \\"the peculiar Finnish physiognomy\\" of the Mordvin diaspora in Armenia, \\"transplanted hither from the Middle Volga at their own wish\\", as characterised by \\"broad and smooth faces, long eyes, a rather flattish nose\\". Cultures, folklores and mythologies An Erzya ritual performance in Podlesnaya Tavla, Mordovia According to Tatiana Deviatkina, although sharing some similarities, no common Mordvin mythology has emerged, and therefore the Erza and Moksha mythologies are defined separately. In the Erza mythology, the superior deities were hatched from an egg. The mother of gods is called Ange Patiai, followed by the Sun God, Chipaz, who gave birth to Nishkepaz; to the earth god, Mastoron kirdi; and to the wind god, Varmanpaz. From the union of Chipaz and the Harvest Mother, Norovava, was born the god of the underworld, Mastorpaz. The thunder god, Pur‚Äôginepaz, was born from Niskende Teitert, (the daughter of the mother of gods, Ange Patiai). The creation of the Earth is followed by the creation of the Sun, the Moon, humankind, and the Erza. Humans were created by Chipaz, the sun god, who, in one version, molded humankind from clay, while in another version, from soil. In Moksha mythology, the Supreme God is called Viarde Skai. According to the legends, the creation of the world went through several stages: first the Devil moistened the building material in his mouth and spat it out. The piece that was spat out grew into a plain, which was modeled unevenly, creating the chasms and the mountains. The first humans created by Viarde Skai could live for 700‚Äì800 years and were giants of 99 archinnes. The underworld in Mokshan mythology was ruled by Mastoratia. Latham reported strong pagan elements surviving Christianization. The 1911 Britannica noted how the Mordvins: History thumbEastern Europe c. 9th century =Prehistory= The Mordvins emerged from the common Volgaic group around the 1st century AD.Mokshin, p. 32 Proof that the Mordvins have long been settled in the vicinity of the Volga is also found in the fact that they still call the river Rav, reflecting the name Rha recorded by PtolemyPre- and Proto-historic Finns by Abercromby, pp. 8 (c. AD 100 ‚Äì c. 170). The Gorodets culture dating back to around 500 BC has been associated with these people. The north-western neighbours were the Muromians and Merians who spoke related Finno-Ugric languages. To the north of the Mordvins lived the Maris, to the south the Khazars. The Mordvins' eastern neighbors, possibly remnants of the Huns, became the Bolgars around 700 AD. Researchers have distinguished the ancestors of the Erzya and the Moksha from the mid-1st century AD by the different orientations of their burials and by elements of their costumes and the variety of bronze jewellery found by archaeologists in their ancient cemeteries. The Erzya graves from this era were oriented north-south, while the Moksha graves were found to be oriented south-north. The Mordvin language began to diverge into Moksha and Erzya over the course of the 1st millennium AD.Taagepera, p. 152Mokshin (1995), p. 33. Erzyans lived in the northern parts of the territory, close to present-day Nizhny Novgorod. The Mokshans lived further south and west of present-day Mordovia, closer to the neighbouring Iranian, Bolgar and Turkic tribes, and fell under their cultural influence. The social organization of Moksha and Erzya depended on patriarchy; the tribes were headed by elders kuda-ti who selected a tekshtai, senior elders responsible for coordinating wider regions. =Early history= Mordovian woman, 1781 Around 800 AD two major empires emerged in the neighborhood: Kievan Rus in present-day Ukraine and Russia adopted Eastern Orthodox Christianity, the Bolgar kingdom located at the confluence of Kama and Volga rivers adopted Islam, and some Moksha areas became tributaries to the latter until the 12th century. Following the foundation of Nizhny Novgorod by Kievan Rus in 1221, the Mordvin territory increasingly fell under Russian domination, pushing the Mordvin populations southwards and eastwards beyond the Urals, and reducing their cohesion. The Russian advance was halted by the Mongol Empire, and the Mordvins became subjects to Golden Horde until the beginning of 16th century. Christianization of the Mordvin peoples took place during the 16th to 18th centuries, and most Mordvins today adhere to the Russian Orthodox Church all carrying Russian Orthodox names. In the 19th century Latham reported strong pagan elements surviving Christianization, the chief gods of the Erzyans and the Mokshas being called Paas and Shkai, respectively. =Modern history= In the Russian Empire, the Mordvins were known as capable carpenters, and Ivan the Terrible used them to build bridges and clear forests during his advance on Kazan. Although the Mordvins were given an autonomous territory as a titular nation within the Soviet Union in 1928, Russification intensified during the 1930s, and knowledge of the Mordvin languages by the 1950s was in rapid decline. After the fall of the Soviet Union, the Mordvins, like other indigenous peoples of Russia, experienced a rise in national consciousness. The Erzya national epic is called Mastorava, which stands for \\"Mother Earth\\". It was compiled by A. M. Sharonov and first published in 1994 in the Erzya language (it has since been translated into Moksha and Russian). Mastorava is also the name of a movement of ethnic separatism founded by D. Nadkin of the Mordovian State University, active in the early 1990s.Tatiana Mastyugina, Lev Perepelkin, Vitaliƒ≠ Vyacheslavovich Naumkin, Irina Zviagelskaia, An Ethnic History of Russia: Pre-revolutionary Times to the Present, Greenwood Publishing Group (1996), , p. 133; Timur Muzaev, ƒñtnicheskiƒ≠ separatizm v Rossii (1999), p. 166ff. Finno-Ugric peoples, whose territories were included in the former USSR as well as many others, had a very brief period of national revival in 1989-1991. Finno-Ugric peoples of Idel-Ural were able to conduct their own national conventions: Udmurts (November 1991), Erzya and Moksha (March 1992), Mari (October 1992), the united convention of Finno-Ugric folks of Russia in Izhevsk (May 1992). All these conventions accepted similar resolutions with appeals to democratize political and public life in their respective republics and to support the national revival of Finno-Ugric peoples. Estonia had strong influence on moods and opinions that dominated these conventions, (especially among national- oriented intellectuals) because many students at the University of Tartu were from Finno-Ugric republics of Russia. At the time of the Soviet Union‚Äôs disintegration, Erzya and Moksha accounted for only 32,5% in total structure of population in –ú–æ—Ä–¥–æ–≤—ñ—ó. The return of many Erzyans and Mokshans to their national identities was strongly challenged by Russification, urbanization and demographic crisis. In addition, part of Mokshan—à national elites (and Erzyan to a lesser extent) came forward with an idea, that Erzyans and Mokshans are just sub-ethnic groups within the united Mordovian nation. This concept was readily supported by Russian authorities, but most representatives of the Erzyan national movement reacted very negatively. National activists perceived the idea of ‚Äúunited Mordovian nation‚Äù as another tool for hard Russification. In 1989 Veƒ∫mema community center emerges in Mordovia. Very soon it becomes popular attracting both Erzyans and Mokshans. In some time only cultural activity becomes quite a narrow scope for part of radical activists, and Veƒ∫mema experiences a major split. Moderate members create Vajƒ£eƒ∫ organization focused on revival and popularization of national traditions, and a more radical group founded Mastorava, Erzan-Mokshan civic movement, that aims not only a cultural revival of both nations but also wants the presentation of their interests in government bodies.  National representative bodies  Erzya has its own system of national representative bodies. Every time before Raske≈Ñ ozks that takes place every three years, A≈•a≈Ñ E≈∫em (erz. Council of elders) is convened. A≈•a≈Ñ E≈∫em is a collective body that discusses the major problems of Erzyan people. A≈•a≈Ñ E≈∫em elects chief elder, Inyazor, by a secret ballot. Inyazor represents all Erzyan people till next Raske≈Ñ Ozks. During the period from 1999 through 2019 position of Inyazor was held by Kshumantsian‚ÄôPirguzh, who was awarded Order of the Cross of St. Mary‚Äôs Land (est. Maarjamaa Risti teenetem√§rk) by President of Estonia in 2014. In 2019 during regular Raske≈Ñ Ozks Syres‚Äô Boliayen‚Äô, chairman of Er≈∫a≈Ñ Val Society, co-founder of Free Idel-Ural civic movement was elected as new Inyazor. His candidature was supported by 12 from 18 elders. Russian authorities do not recognize the legitimacy of the national representative bodies of Erzyan people. Syres‚Äô Boliayen‚Äô is now in exile in Ukraine and representatives of A≈•a≈Ñ e≈∫em, as well as first Inyazor Kshumantsian‚ÄôPirguzh, repeatedly reported about political pressure from Russian authorities. According to Russian laws, the activity of national political parties (Erzya, Mari, Tatars, Chuvashs or any other) is forbidden. Consequently, the national representative agency of Erzya people is the only possible instrument to express the political aspirations of Erzya. Due to the activity of Veƒ∫mema, Vajƒ£eƒ∫ and Mastorava situation with human rights for Erzyans and Mokshans in Mordovia has changed significantly. Mordovian National theatre and faculty of national culture were founded in the republic, Language Law was adopted, productive relationships and contacts with foreign diaspores were established. Aforementioned organizations became a ‚Äútalent foundry‚Äù for new associations of Erzya and Moksha, namely Od Vij, Er≈∫ava, ƒπitova, and Jurhtava; as well as for Mastorava and Er≈∫a≈Ñ Mastor newspapers. Exactly due to the activity of all mentioned organizations and societies Erzyan and Mokshan national movements become able to progress from the ethnographic stage of their struggle to a political one.–í–ª–∞—Å—Ç–µ–π –ú–æ—Ä–¥–æ–≤–∏–∏ –ø—Ä–∏–∑–≤–∞–ª–∏ –Ω–µ –≤–º–µ—à–∏–≤–∞—Ç—å—Å—è –≤ –¥–µ—è—Ç–µ–ª—å–Ω–æ—Å—Ç—å –°–æ–≤–µ—Ç–∞ —Å—Ç–∞—Ä–µ–π—à–∏–Ω —ç—Ä–∑—è–Ω—Å–∫–æ–≥–æ –Ω–∞—Ä–æ–¥–∞ https://www.idelreal.org/a/30062876.html At the end of the 1980s Pirguzh Kshumantsian‚Äô, human rights defender, and Mariz‚Äô Kemal, poetess, became leaders of Erzyan national movement. They revived the tradition of Raske≈Ñ Ozks (erz. Family Prayer). 5 days before the very first Raske≈Ñ Ozks Kshumantsian‚Äô, as main organizer of the event, was arrested by Russian authorities. Police forced him to abandon the realization of Prayer, however, he refused to comply with the demands. In 1999 Pirguzh Kshumantsian‚Äô was elected as the first Inyazor (chief elder) in the newest history of Erzyan people. He held this position up to 2019. Mariz‚Äô Kemal adhered to the principle of \\"Kavto keƒ∫≈• - kavto ra≈õke≈•\\" (erz. \\"Two languages - two nations\\"), that denied the existence of the single Mordovian nation as the combination of sub-ethnic groups, namely Erzya and Moksha. National life in the Republic of Mordovia began to draw down with the installation of Vladimir Putin‚Äôs rule. The new president of Russia considered national republics and native peoples as ‚Äúenemies inside‚Äù. May 1, 2020 Atyan‚Äô Ezem (erz. Elders‚Äô Council) approved new system of national representative bodies. Statute on creation and functioning of national representative bodies of Erzya people consists of six chapters, describing aims and tasks of Erzya national movement, its governing bodies, their plenary powers and structure. According to the document, national movement directed by Promks ‚Äì convention of delegates from Erzya political parties and public organizations. Convention forms Atyan‚Äô Ezem, that is operative between Promks sessions and elects Inyazor (Chief Elder), who presents Erzya people and speaks on behalf of all the nation. In the event that there are any legal limitations for creation and operation of national parties (such prohibition exists in Russian Federation nowadays), then plenary powers of Promks are carried by Atyan‚Äô Ezem. The main objective of Promks, Atyan‚Äô Ezem and Inyazor, is to provide and defend national, political, economic and cultural rights of Erzya, including right to national self- determination within national Erzya territories. Erzya approved structure of their national representative bodies http://idel-ural.org/en/archives/erzya- approved-structure-of-their-national-representative-bodies/ Languages The Mordvinic languages, a subgroup of the Uralic family, are Erzya and Moksha, with about 500,000 native speakers each. Both are official languages of Mordovia alongside Russian. The medieval Meshcherian language may have been Mordvinic, or close to Mordvinic. Erzya is spoken in the northern and eastern and north-western parts of Mordovia, as well as in the adjacent oblasts of Nizhny Novgorod, Penza, Samara, Saratov, Orenburg, and Ulyanovsk, and in the republics of Chuvashia, Tatarstan, and Bashkortostan. Moksha is the majority language in the western part of Mordovia. Due to differences in phonology, lexicon, and grammar, Erzya and Moksha are not mutually intelligible, to the extent that Russian language is often used for intergroup communications. The two Mordvinic languages also have separate literary forms. The Erzya literary language was created in 1922 and the Mokshan in 1923. Both are currently written using the standard Russian alphabet. Demographics Mordvins in the Volga-Urals region (2010 Russian census) Latham (1854) quoted a total population of 480,000. Mastyugina (1996) quotes 1.15 million. The 2002 Russian census reports 0.84 million. According to estimates by Tartu University made in the late 1970s, less than one third of Mordvins lived in the autonomous republic of Mordovia, in the basin of the Volga River. Others are scattered (2002) over the Russian oblasts of Samara (116,475), Penza (86,370), Orenburg (68,880) and Nizhni Novgorod (36,705), Ulyanovsk (61,100), Saratov (23,380), Moscow (22,850), Tatarstan (28,860), Chuvashia (18,686), Bashkortostan (31,932), Siberia (65,650), Russian Far East (29,265).

It is also known as \\"PZL P-37\\" or \\"PZL P.37\\", but the letter \\"P\\" was generally reserved for fighters of Zygmunt Pu≈Çawski's design (such as the PZL P.11).E.g. Cynk (1971, 1973, 1990, 2007) Upon its introduction to service, it was popularly considered to be not only the most modern and effective weapon then possessed by Poland, but also to be one of the most advanced bombers then operational in the world. From mid-1938 onwards, there was huge interest expressed by various nations in potential export sales of the PZL.37; in response to this highly favourable reception, PZL, being keen to meet the demands, developed additional variants that were intended for the export market, such as the PZL.37C (which was to be powered by a pair of Gnome-Rhone 14N-0/1 radial engines). An improved enlarged derivative, known as the PZL.49 Mi≈õ, was also developed for the Polish Air Force. The ≈Åo≈õ was extensively used in the defense of Poland during the rapid invasion of Poland by Nazi Germany in September 1939. On 1 September 1939, the Polish Air Force had roughly 86 PZL.37s in total, but less than a half of those actually saw active combat use due to aircraft being used by training units, being in maintenance, or having been held in reserve. The bombers suffered from a high attrition rate due to lack of fighter protection, and the final Polish combat missions were performed on 19 September. During October 1940, around 26-27 of the PZL.37s that had been evacuated from Poland were seized by the Romanian government and 23 of these aircraft were subsequently used by the Royal Romanian Air Force, including offensive missions against the Soviet Union. Development =Background= Throughout the majority of the interwar period, the dominant military philosophies and practices within the leadership of Poland was that aircraft were of a secondary importance and a separate air-oriented service within the Polish Armed Forces would be of questionable value. Instead, it was decided to develop the nation's aviation assets to principally function as a means of providing aerial support to the newly formed Polish Land Forces. As such, a relatively minimal budget was allocated for aviation matters while no dedicated doctrine in respect to air power was developed, neither was an effective bomber force pursued in any form throughout much of this period and, when such a force was established, it was met with controversy and heavy criticism from officers who were sceptical that Poland required any bomber aircraft at all.Cynk 1973, p. 121. Despite this unpromising lack of interest, a separate service, known as the Wojska Lotnicze (Polish Air Force), had been formed during 1918. During the Polish‚ÄìSoviet War of 1919, there had been proposals mooted for the formation of a specialised bomber group equipped with modified Breguet 14 B2 biplanes; however, these were not quickly followed up upon due to a lack of understanding and appreciation amongst senior officers. During April 1920, the first Polish bomber squadron was stood up at Pozna≈Ñ‚Äì≈Åawica Airport, Greater Poland, equipped with a variety of captured ex-German aircraft such as Gotha G.IVs, AEG G.IVs, and Friedrichshafen G.IIIs. However, following the end of the conflict with the Soviets, this bomber squadron was amalgamated with a reconnaissance-orientated squadron.Cynk 1973, pp. 121-122. During 1920, the Polish Air Force heavily benefited from an extensive re-armament and expansion programme headed by General W≈Çodzimierz Zag√≥rski, under which the formation of dedicated bomber regiments was envisioned. Accordingly, an order was placed for 32 French-built Farman F.68 BN.4 Goliath twin-engined night bombers, with which it was intended to equip and launch these squadrons. An additional pair of army co-operation squadrons were repurposed as light bomber units instead, equipped with French Potez XV B2 aircraft. Unfortunately, Zag√≥rski's reforms were abandoned following the May Coup lead by J√≥zef Pi≈Çsudski.Cynk 1973, p. 122. Throughout the 1920s and 1930s, some officials within Poland remained interested in the establishment of a national bomber force, in some cases for prestige value rather than in terms of strict military value. During 1927, the Department of Aeronautics authorised the development of the Lublin R-VIII, a large single-engined reconnaissance bomber. In the following year, the department ordered Polish aviation manufacturer Pa≈Ñstwowe Zak≈Çady Lotnicze (PZL) to make preparations towards the development of a heavy multi-engined night bomber; while numerous proposals and design studies were made by both PZL and private factories, but none were approved for further development by the department.Cynk 1973, pp. 122-123. Instead, it was decided to procure a number of Dutch-built Fokker F.VII to meet the bomber role, the first of which being delivered during 1929, despite condemnation of the aircraft's poor defensive armament, limited payload capacity, and excessive weight.Cynk 1973, p. 123. =Emergence= Despite not being approved for further development, PZL decided to independently continue refining their designs for a multi- engined night bomber. These studies, led by aircraft engineer Wladyslaw Zalewski, developed an advanced concept, known as the PZL 3, for an all-metal low-wing cantilever monoplane bomber, which was intended to be powered by an arrangement of four Bristol Jupiter radial engines positioned in tandem pairs and armed with a pair of side-mounted gun turrets in addition to an internally-stowed bombload of 3,000 kg (6,613 lb). However, during December 1930, all work on this concept was abandoned as an economy measure and the construction of a prototype was abandoned. Reportedly, technical data for the PZL 3 was later received by French manufacturer Potez.Cynk 1973, pp. 123-124. During the 1930s, discussions were held regarding a potential replacement of Poland's Fokker F.VIIs. Numerous concepts were explored by the Department of Aeronautics, the most impressive submission was deemed to have been made by Polish aeronautical engineer Jerzy DƒÖbrowski, who had produced the initial proposals that would lead to the PZL.37 during spring 1934 and submitted to the department in July 1934. The concept was of a very quick monoplane bomber manned by a crew of four, featuring all-metal stressed-skin construction and powered by a pair of radial engines capable of producing 800-1,200 hp. The airframe was aerodynamically clean and was to be capable of very high performance, far in advance of contemporary bombers; wind tunnel testing using scale models of the aircraft were extremely encouraged.Cynk 1973, p. 124. During October 1934, the instruction to proceed with the proposal, initially designated P.37, was received by PZL.Cynk 1973, pp. 124-125. An express priority was placed upon performance over armament and equipment, relying upon its high speed for its defence; as such, only a single 7.7 mm machine gun was allocated to each turret position instead of the twin-guns and 20 mm dorsal cannon previously considered. On 14 April 1935, the department issued its approval of a full-scale wooden mock-up of the aircraft, authorising the construction of a pair of prototypes along with a structural test frame.Cynk 1973, p. 125. During early 1936, the necessity of revising the design's structure delayed the construction of the partially-assembled first prototype. During May 1936, the prototype commenced ground testing and taxiing trials; however, on 15 June, while being rolled out for its intended first flight, an engine failure was sustained prior to the attempt, resulting in its delay. On 30 June 1936, the first PZL.37/I prototype, which was fitted with a single vertical stabilizer, performed its maiden flight successfully. In August 1936, the initial factory tests were completed, after which the first prototype participated in official airworthiness and service trials. These revealed a handful of shortcomings, including rear fuselage flutter, excessive vibration on the instrumentation panel, overheating of the cylinder heads, and criticism of the cockpit's lack of space, however, test pilots were typically highly impressed with the aircraft. In response to the feedback from the first prototype's testing, several improvements and other modifications were made, some of which was introduced on the original prototype while more extensive changes were introduced upon the second prototype. This second prototype, known as PZL.37/II, featured the adoption of twin-vertical stabilizers, a re- worked cockpit and an altered ventral gun position amongst other changes, functioned as a representative aircraft of the anticipated production bomber and performed its first flight during autumn 1936.Cynk 1973, pp. 125-126. Suitably impressed, the department accepted the aircraft for production, placing an initial order for 10 pre-production aircraft, as well as bestowing a name upon the bomber, ≈Åo≈õ.Cynk 1973, p. 126. =Production= The second prototype of the PZL.37 ≈Åo≈õ Production of the ≈Åo≈õ commenced during the winter of 1936-1937. During 1938, the first 10 serial aircraft were manufactured, designated as the PZL.37A; these were furnished with a single vertical stabilizer. The next 19 interim aircraft were constructed to the PZL.37A bis standard, having been outfitted with the newer twin tail configuration. All of these aircraft were powered by the British-developed Bristol Pegasus XII B radial engine, which was produced in Poland under licence. The main production variant, the PZL.37B (or: ≈Åo≈õ II), was furnished with the twin tail arrangement along with newer Pegasus XX engines. During autumn 1938, production of the PZL.37B commenced for the Polish Air Force. During the initial period of service, 2 prototypes and 6 serial aircraft were lost in separate crashes; these had been caused by several technical problems, most of which involved the rudder. Following the implementation of some structural changes, the PZL.37B became a highly reliable aircraft. By the outbreak of the Second World War, roughly 92 PZL.37 bombers had been produced and delivered to the Polish Air Force, and a further 31 were in different phases of production. Prior to the Second World War, the PZL.37B ≈Åo≈õ was widely considered to be one of the most advanced bombers then operational in the world. It was able to carry a heavier bombload than considerably larger aircraft, such as the British-built Vickers Wellington, though the dimensions of the individual bombs were limited. Being smaller than most contemporary medium bombers, the ≈Åo≈õ was relatively fast and easy to handle. As a consequence of a favourable landing gear arrangement, having been fitted with double wheels, the bomber could operate from austere airstrips as well as rough fields or meadows. Typically amongst bombers of the late 1930s, its defensive armament consisted of only three machine guns, which subsequently proved too weak against enemy fighters in combat. =Export interest and further development= Starting with a presentation at a salon in Belgrade in June 1938 and in Paris in November, the PZL.37 met with a huge interest. For export purposes, new variants were developed: the PZL.37C with Gnome-Rhone 14N-0/1 radial engines of 985 cv (971 BHP, 724 kW), maximum speed 445 km/h and the PZL.37D with 14N-20/21 of 1,065 cv (1,050 BHP, 783 kW), maximum speed 460 km/h. In 1939, 20 PZL.37Cs were ordered by Yugoslavia, 12 by Bulgaria, 30 PZL.37Ds and license by Romania and 10, raw materials and parts for next 25 and license by Turkey and, finally, 12 aircraft for Greece.Glass 2008, p. 97. The Belgian company Constructions A√©ronautiques G. Renard was granted permission to perform the license production of between 20‚Äì50 aircraft for the Second Spanish Republic; however, the venture was abandoneded due to the victory of the opposing Nationalists in the Spanish Civil War. In addition to the Belgian venture, it is known that Denmark, Estonia, Finland and Iran were all at various stages of negotiation for their own acquisitions of the type. The Polish military were not allowed to establish an arrangement with Iran due to \\"lack of production abilities\\". Nevertheless, the outbreak of the war acted to prevent the production of any of these aircraft. At that time, PZL developed the next variant for the Polish Air Force, the PZL.49 Mi≈õ, but this was not completed before the war. Possessing slightly bigger dimensions, the Mi≈õ (\\"Bear\\") was to be fitted with Bristol Hercules II radial engines of 1,350 BHP (1,370 cv, 1,007 kW), capable of a maximum speed of 520 km/h along with the addition of an upper turret. Design alt=A Polish PZL.37 ≈Åo≈õ medium bomber aircraft The PZL.37 ≈Åo≈õ was a twin-engined all-metal monoplane medium bomber.Cynk 1973, p. 141. It was relatively conventional in layout, being outfitted with low-set wings, a twin tail (on the majority of aircraft), and a metal-covered exterior. The aircraft was quite small for its bomb load and range; its capacity was achieved in part by a lift-generating, airfoil-shaped fuselage, which was another then-unusual feature (previously used e.g. on PZL.26 sports plane). It was much shorter and had smaller wings than many German and French counterparts; it was slightly larger than the Lockheed Model 10 Electra Amelia Earhart used. The crew consisted of four: pilot, commander-bombardier, radio operator and a rear gunner. The bombardier was accommodated in the glazed nose, with a forward machine gun. The radio operator sat inside the fuselage, above the bomb bay, and he also operated an underbelly rear machine gun. The ≈Åo≈õ featured retractable main undercarriage, which retracted into purpose- built alcoves located within the engine nacelles. The undercarriage was double-wheeled, complete with independent suspension for each wheel. The bomber was powered by a pair of Bristol Pegasus radial engines; the PZL.37A model had Pegasus XII B engines (normal power: 860 BHP (873 cv, 642 kW), maximum: 940 BHP (953 cv, 701 kW)), the PZL.37B variant had Pegasus XX engines (normal power: 905 HP (918 cv, 675 kW), maximum: 970 BHP (984 cv, 723 kW)). Originally, it was intended for a popular wing profile, designed by Ryszard Bartel (also used in many other successful Polish airframes incl. PZL P.11) to be used for the aircraft; however, the requirement of providing bomb storage with the internal space of the wings necessitated modification to the design. Some publications claim the resulting profile displayed laminar-flow properties (one of the first in the world), but this is disputed ‚Äì its shape which resembled laminar flow wings developed in later years, but this was largely fortuitous, and at any rate achieving the laminar flow regime would have required additional construction features (most importantly extremely smooth wings shaped with extreme precision)For the difficulties in achieving this in the first purposely designed airplane aiming at laminar flow, the P-51 Mustang, see which the aircraft simply lacked. However, the profile did display lower drag than expected and the initial PZL.37A version possessed a maximal speed 10 per cent higher than the originally planned 360 km/h. The modified profile was viewed as highly successful and was later re-used for other projects (sometimes in further modified form; e.g. PZL.46 Sum, PZL.49 Mi≈õ, PZL.50). The bomber's offensive payload was spread across a two-section bomb bay set within the fuselage (providing space for up to 4 bombs) and a total of 8 compact bomb bays located in the central section of the wings (which had space for a maximum of 16 bombs). This arrangement of bomb bays imposed considerable restrictions on the types of bombs that could be carried, especially in the wing bays which were quite small due to the need to fit between the ribs of the wing. The maximum load was 2,580 kg (2 √ó 300 kg and 18 √ó 110 kg). Apart from a pair of 300 kg bombs in one of the fuselage bomb bays, it could not carry bombs larger than 110 kg. When flown at the maximum loadout, the majority of the weight of the bombs was carried inside the wings. There were no provisions for mounting bombs on the outside of the aircraft. During the invasion of Poland in 1939, 110 kg was the maximum weight used, since the 300 kg bombs were available only in small quantities, and were difficult to load at improvised airfields with little infrastructure. 50 kg bombs were also used. Maximal bomb load taken from soft surface runways was reduced to about 800‚Äì1200 kg. Operational history =Poland= During early 1938, the Polish Air Force started to receive the ≈Åos A variant;Air International October 1988, p. 197. it was followed by deliveries of the improved PZL.37B to operational units, which had been slowed by delays in supply of the Pegasus XX engines and other equipment, during the autumn of 1938.Air International October 1988, pp. 216‚Äì217. On 1 September 1939, the Polish Air Force had roughly 86 PZL.37s in total, but less than a half of those were used in combat. 36 PZL.37Bs were in four bomber escadres of a Bomber Brigade: the 11th, 12th, 16th and 17th escadres (two escadres with nine aircraft each, constituted a group, in Polish: dywizjon; the PZL.37 were in groups X and XV). The remainder of the Bomber Brigade's aircraft were PZL.23 Kara≈õ. About 50 remaining PZL.37s were assigned to the reserve XX group, training units or in repairs. As a consequence of there only having been a few months available to train the crews and complete the equipping of the bombers, the planes were not fully ready when the war broke out. For example, the extra internal fuel tanks for the type were not yet in service, thus the maximum range of the bomber that had been quoted in specifications was in practice not achievable. A group of Polish Air Force PZL.37 bombers on the ground, 1939 Only the PZL.37s of the Bomber Brigade actively participated in the defence of Poland. By 1 September, they had been deployed to rural improvised airfields, so they were not destroyed on the ground by the Germans in their initial attack on the main Polish airbases.Cynk 1973, p. 137. However, because of this move away from developed airfields to short fields with poor surfaces, during the campaign the planes could take off with only a fraction of their maximum bomb load (typically 800 kg or 8 x 100 kg bombs), which limited their effectiveness. During the invasion of Poland, from 4 September onward the planes of the Bomber Brigade were attacking German armoured columns in day attacks, forced by the desperate situation to perform this mission for which they were not designed (the original plans to bomb targets inside Germany were quickly abandoned).Cynk 1973, pp. 137-137. Most notably, they hampered the advance of the XVI Army Corps near Czƒôstochowa and Radomsko. During these engagements, the PZL.37 suffered heavy losses as a result of a lack of adequate fighter protection, which was further amplified by the operational tactics employed, usually flying missions in units of no more than three aircraft at a time. The last combat flights took place on 16 September.Cynk 1973, p. 138. During the campaign, the combat units were reinforced with several other aircraft, and about 46 PZL.37s were used in combat. Of the Bomber Brigade aircraft, ten PZL.37s were shot down by fighters, five shot down by enemy anti-aircraft artillery, two bombed on the ground and a further ten lost in other ways. A number of not fully completed, training or reserve PZL.37s were also destroyed on airfields and in factories (18 PZL.37s were bombed in a reserve base in Ma≈Çaszewicze and in a factory in Warsaw ‚Äì Okƒôcie). =Captured aircraft= Twenty-six or twenty-seven Polish Air Force PZL.37s (17 from the Bomber Brigade and ten training ones) were withdrawn in 1939 to Romania. During October 1940, these aircraft were seized by the Romanian government and 23 of these aircraft would be used by the Romanian Air Force in the 4th Group, consisting of the 76th and 77th bomber escadres.Cynk 1973, pp. 138-139. Some were uparmed with four machine guns (the Polish PWU machineguns were still used). About one third were lost in crashes due to lack of experience of Romanian pilots with the PZL.37's handling and its high wing loading, and due to engine faults. About 15 were used in combat against the Soviet Union from 22 June 1941. Among others, they first operated in Bessarabia, while they were later used to conduct bombing missions targeting Kiev and Odessa. Some of the bombers were lost on these missions, mostly due to anti-aircraft fire. Because of a lack of spare parts, the remaining planes were withdrawn from the front in October 1941; after this, the type was mainly used for training. During April 1944, the 76th escadrille returned to combat, with nine aircraft, but it was withdrawn from the front on 3 May 1944. After Romania joined the Allies, on 1 September 1944, German aircraft destroyed five PZL.37s on the ground during retaliatory attacks against Romanian targets. Additionally, a number of captured planes underwent testing by both Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union.Cynk 1973, p. 139. Relatively few PZL.37s fell into German hands, probably only two aircraft; this is partially due to the efforts of Polish factory workers who scrapped roughly 30 PZL.37s that remained in factories in Okƒôcie and Mielec, under the pretext of cleaning up the area, during October 1939, before the German authorities were able to reconnoiter. Preserved parts and models of PZL.37 ≈Åo≈õ There are no surviving PZL.37 aircraft. An original PZL Pegaz 20 engine of the type used in PZL.37 ≈Åo≈õ is in the collection of the Polish Aviation Museum in Krak√≥w. This engine was sent from Poland to the United States in the spring of 1939 to be exhibited at the 1939 New York World's Fair and thus survived the war, and was returned to Poland in 2006.Serce \\"≈Åosia\\" wr√≥ci≈Ço do Polski ‚Äì page from the Polish Aviation Museum website, includes galleries A 1:1 scale non-flying model of PZL.37 ≈Åo≈õ was assembled at PZL Mielec factory, in the factory hall used to construct these bombers before the war.

The phrase is a primarily American colloquialism, termed as such based on a stereotypical scenario where the father of the pregnant bride-to-be threatens the reluctant groom with a shotgun to ensure that he follows through with the wedding.  Rationale  One purpose of such a wedding can be to get recourse from the man for the act of impregnation; another reason is trying to ensure that the child is raised by both parents. In some cases, as in early America and in the Middle East, a major objective was the restoring of social honour to the mother. The practice is a loophole method of preventing the birth of legally illegitimate children, or if the marriage occurs early enough, to conceal the fact that conception occurred prior to marriage. In some societies the stigma attached to pregnancy out of wedlock can be enormous, and coercive means (in spite of the legal defense of undue influence) for gaining recourse are often seen as the prospective father-in-law's \\"right\\", and an important, albeit unconventional, coming of age event for the young father-to-be. Often a couple will arrange a shotgun wedding without explicit outside encouragement, and some religious teachings consider it a moral imperative to marry in that situation.  By culture  =Asia= West Asia Pre-marital sexual relations remain taboo across all social strata throughout the Middle East. In many cases, fornication is illegal and even a criminal offence. Even when it is not, the social response can be extreme, especially against women who have lost their virginity prior to marriage. In this cultural milieu, shotgun weddings serve to obscure the fact that a baby was conceived prior to marriage. When that proves impossible, the social standing of the couple involved is irreparably damaged. Nevertheless, shotgun weddings serve to prevent the individuals involved, especially the women, from becoming social pariahs. Apart from instances of regional slang, there is no special term for \\"shotgun weddings\\" in Arabic. This is because they are not recognised as a regular social phenomenon and because a successful Middle Eastern shotgun wedding is not known to be a shotgun wedding by the guests.  East Asia  Marriages preceded by pregnancy by age in Japan (2010). *In Japan, the slang term , or for short, emerged in the late 1990s. The term can literally be translated as \\"oops-we-did-it-marriage,\\" implying an unintended pregnancy. Notable celebrities with these marriages include Namie Amuro, Takako Uehara, Y≈çko Oginome, Hitomi Furuya, Ami Suzuki, Kaori Iida, Nozomi Tsuji, Anna Tsuchiya, Meisa Kuroki, Leah Dizon, Melody Miyuki Ishikawa, Riisa Naka, Rie Miyazawa and Emi Takei.Haruna Kashiwase, \\"Shotgun Weddings a Sign of the Times in Japan,\\" Population Today, July 2002, prb.org \\"Japan embraces shotgun weddings\\". Telegraph. June 22, 2009. Retrieved July 25, 2010. A quarter of all Japanese brides are pregnant at the time of their wedding, according to the Health Labor and Welfare Ministry, and pregnancy is one of the most common motivations for marriage. The prevalence and celebrity profile of dekichatta- kon has inspired Japan's wedding industry to introduce an even more benign phrase, . *In China, the term Â•âÂ≠êÊàêÂ©ö () means that the couple married because conception occurred outside of marriage. It is a pun on the phrase Â•âÊó®ÊàêÂ©ö, pronounced Fengzhichenghun and implying that a wedding is approved by imperial edict. It is becoming increasingly common among China's youngest generation. However, in the same age group, there is objection and criticism to such a practice.Â•âÂ≠êÊàêÂ©öÊàêÂ∏∏ÁèæË±° \\"Â§ßËÇöÊñ∞Â®ò\\"ÊåëÊà∞ÂÇ≥Áµ±Ë≤ûÊìç Married by the child became a norm, \\"Pregnant brides\\" are challenging the traditional chastity.‚ÄúÂ•âÂ≠êÊàêÂ©ö‚ÄùÊåëÊàò‰º†ÁªüÈÅìÂæ∑Â∫ïÁ∫ø \\"Married by the Child\\" challenging traditional marital limits. *In Korea, the slang term ÏÜçÎèÑÏúÑÎ∞ò (RR: Sokdowiban; literally: \\"speeding over the limit\\") refers to the situation in which the pregnancy preceded the marriage. *In Vietnam, the term \\"B√°c sƒ© b·∫£o c∆∞·ªõi\\" (literally meaning \\"because [the] doctor said so\\") is often used with humorous intention. =Southeast Asia= *The Philippines also has a shotgun wedding tradition wherein a man shall be forced to marry a woman whom he impregnates. Other forms of this tradition include a girl's parents forcing the man to marry their daughter due to the latter's social status or wealth (rather than his desire to marry the girl) and others. Firearms may or may not be used during the coercion but other forms of threats include litigation (which is common in cases of impregnation wherein the girl's family threatens to file rape charges against the man). *Indonesia has a similar condition with the Philippines; this is usually called \\"married by accident\\". = Europe = Because of the sexual revolution beginning in the 1960s, the concepts of love, sexuality, procreation and marriage began to separate after being intimately entangled in social consciousness for centuries. However, sexual practice had not always followed social convention, resulting in shotgun or Knobstick weddings. *In the United Kingdom, one source reports that almost 40% of all brides were pregnant in 1850. Quoted at *In Denmark, a 1963 study found that 50% of all brides were pregnant. *In the Netherlands and Belgium, the Dutch term moetje was a commonly used euphemism for marriage resulting from unintended pregnancy. The noun is formed from imperative of the verb moeten (\\"must\\", \\"to have to\\") with the added suffix -je, indicating a diminutive. Thus, it might be translated as a \\"little must\\" or a \\"little you-have-to\\", i.e. one is compelled to marry to avoid the shame of giving birth out of wedlock. Moetjes were a common occurrence in Belgium and the Netherlands until the first half of the 20th century. In the early 1960s, about a quarter of all marriages in the Netherlands were shotgun marriages; however, in some areas, up to 90% of the brides were pregnant. By the late 2000s, the practice had become so rare that the term was growing obsolete. According to a 2013 by the Centrum voor Leesonderzoek, the word moetje was recognised by 82.5% of the Dutch and 43.1% of the Flemish.Woordenkennis van Nederlanders en Vlamingen anno 2013, p. 679. Centrum voor Leesonderzoek. = North America = *In the United States, the use of duress or violent coercion to marry is no longer common, although many anecdotal stories and folk songs record instances of such coercion in 18th- and 19th-century America. The phenomenon has become less common as the stigma associated with out-of-wedlock births has declined and the number of such births has increased. Effective birth control and legalized abortion have also resulted in fewer unplanned pregnancies carried to term. Nonetheless a marriage which occurs when the bride is pregnant, even when there is no family or social pressure involved, is still sometimes referred to as a \\"shotgun wedding\\".

Equity is measured by comparing the ratio of contributions (or costs) and benefits (or rewards) for each person. Considered one of the justice theories, equity theory was first developed in the 1960s by J. Stacy Adams, a workplace and behavioral psychologist, who asserted that employees seek to maintain equity between the inputs that they bring to a job and the outcomes that they receive from it against the perceived inputs and outcomes of others (Adams, 1963). According to Equity Theory, in order to maximize individuals' rewards, we tend to create systems where resources can be fairly divided amongst members of a group. Inequalities in relationships will cause those within it to be unhappy to a degree proportional to the amount of inequality. The belief is that people value fair treatment which causes them to be motivated to keep the fairness maintained within the relationships of their co-workers and the organization. The structure of equity in the workplace is based on the ratio of inputs to outcomes. Inputs are the contributions made by the employee for the organization. Background Equity theory focuses on determining whether the distribution of resources is fair to both relational partners. It proposes that individuals who perceive themselves as either under-rewarded or over-rewarded will experience distress, and that this distress leads to efforts to restore equity within the relationship. It focuses on determining whether the distribution of resources is fair to both relational partners. Equity is measured by comparing the ratios of contributions and benefits of each person within the relationship. Partners do not have to receive equal benefits (such as receiving the same amount of love, care, and financial security) or make equal contributions (such as investing the same amount of effort, time, and financial resources), as long as the ratio between these benefits and contributions is similar. Much like other prevalent theories of motivation, such as Maslow‚Äôs hierarchy of needs, equity theory acknowledges that subtle and variable individual factors affect each person‚Äôs assessment and perception of their relationship with their relational partners (Guerrero et al., 2005). According to Adams (1965), anger is induced by underpayment inequity and guilt is induced with overpayment equity (Spector 2008). Payment whether hourly wage or salary, is the main concern and therefore the cause of equity or inequity in most cases. In any position, an employee wants to feel that their contributions and work performance are being rewarded with their pay. If an employee feels underpaid then it will result in the employee feeling hostile towards the organization and perhaps their co-workers, which may result in the employee not performing well at work anymore. It is the subtle variables that also play an important role in the feeling of equity. Just the idea of recognition for the job performance and the mere act of thanking the employee will cause a feeling of satisfaction and therefore help the employee feel worthwhile and have better outcomes. =Definition of equity= Individuals compare their job inputs and outcomes with those of others and then respond to eliminate any perceived inequities. Referent Comparisons: =Inputs and outcomes= Inputs Inputs are defined as each participant‚Äôs contributions to the relational exchange and are viewed as entitling him/her to rewards or costs. The inputs that a participant contributes to a relationship can be either assets ‚Äì entitling him/her to rewards ‚Äì or liabilities - entitling him/her to costs. The entitlement to rewards or costs ascribed to each input vary depending on the relational setting. In industrial settings, assets such as capital and manual labor are seen as \\"relevant inputs\\" ‚Äì inputs that legitimately entitle the contributor to rewards. In social settings, assets such as physical beauty and kindness are generally seen as assets entitling the possessor to social rewards. Individual traits such as boorishness and cruelty are seen as liabilities entitling the possessor to costs (Walster, Traupmann & Walster, 1978). Inputs typically include any of the following: * Time *Education *Œïxperience *Effort * Loyalty *Hard Work *Commitment *Ability *Adaptability * Flexibility * Tolerance *Determination * Enthusiasm *Personal sacrifice *Trust in supervisors *Support from co-workers and colleagues *Skill Outcomes Outputs are defined as the positive and negative consequences that an individual perceives a participant has incurred as a consequence of his/her relationship with another. When the ratio of inputs to outputs is close, then the employee should have much satisfaction with their job. Outputs can be both tangible and intangible. Typical outputs include any of the following: * Job security * Salary * Employee benefit *Expenses *Recognition * Reputation * Responsibility *Sense of achievement *Praise *Thanks *Stimuli =Propositions= Equity theory consists of four propositions: ; self-inside: Individuals seek to maximize their outcomes (where outcomes are defined as rewards minus costs). ; self-outside: Groups can maximize collective rewards by developing accepted systems for equitably apportioning rewards and costs among members. Systems of equity will evolve within groups, and members will attempt to induce other members to accept and adhere to these systems. The only way groups can induce members to equitably behave is by making it more profitable to behave equitably than inequitably. Thus, groups will generally reward members who treat others equitably and generally punish (increase the cost for) members who treat others inequitably. ; others-inside: When individuals find themselves participating in inequitable relationships, they become distressed. The more inequitable the relationship, the more distress individuals feel. According to equity theory, both the person who gets \\"too much\\" and the person who gets \\"too little\\" feel distressed. The person who gets too much may feel guilt or shame. The person who gets too little may feel angry or humiliated. ; other-outside: Individuals who perceive that they are in an inequitable relationship attempt to eliminate their distress by restoring equity. The greater the inequity, the more distress people feel and the more they try to restore equity. (Walster, Traupmann and Walster, 1978) In business Equity theory has been widely applied to business settings by industrial psychologists to describe the relationship between an employee's motivation and his or her perception of equitable or inequitable treatment. In a business setting, the relevant dyadic relationship is that between employee and employer. As in marriage and other contractual dyadic relationships, equity theory assumes that employees seek to maintain an equitable ratio between the inputs they bring to the relationship and the outcomes they receive from it (Adams, 1965). Equity theory in business, however, introduces the concept of social comparison, whereby employees evaluate their own input/output ratios based on their comparison with the input/outcome ratios of other employees (Carrell and Dittrich, 1978). Inputs in this context include the employee‚Äôs time, expertise, qualifications, experience, intangible personal qualities such as drive and ambition, and interpersonal skills. Outcomes include monetary compensation, perquisites (\\"perks\\"), benefits, and flexible work arrangements. Employees who perceive inequity will seek to reduce it, either by distorting inputs and/or outcomes in their own minds (\\"cognitive distortion\\"), directly altering inputs and/or outcomes, or leaving the organization (Carrell and Dittrich, 1978). These perceptions of inequity are perceptions of organizational justice, or more specifically, injustice. Subsequently, the theory has wide-reaching implications for employee morale, efficiency, productivity, and turnover. =Assumptions of equity theory applied to business= The three primary assumptions applied to most business applications of equity theory can be summarized as follows: # Employees expect a fair return for what they contribute to their jobs, a concept referred to as the \\"equity norm\\". # Employees determine what their equitable return should be after comparing their inputs and outcomes with those of their coworkers. This concept is referred to as \\"social comparison\\". # Employees who perceive themselves as being in an inequitable situation will seek to reduce the inequity either by distorting inputs and/or outcomes in their own minds (\\"cognitive distortion\\"), by directly altering inputs and/or outputs, or by leaving the organization. (Carrell and Dittrich, 1978)'''' =Implications for managers= Equity theory has several implications for business managers: *People measure the totals of their inputs and outcomes. This means a working mother may accept lower monetary compensation in return for more flexible working hours. *Different employees ascribe personal values to inputs and outcomes. Thus, two employees of equal experience and qualification performing the same work for the same pay may have quite different perceptions of the fairness of the deal. *Employees are able to adjust for purchasing power and local market conditions. Thus a teacher from Alberta may accept lower compensation than his colleague in Toronto if his cost of living is different, while a teacher in a remote African village may accept a totally different pay structure. *Although it may be acceptable for more senior staff to receive higher compensation, there are limits to the balance of the scales of equity and employees can find excessive executive pay demotivating. *Staff perceptions of inputs and outcomes of themselves and others may be incorrect, and perceptions need to be managed effectively. *An employee who believes he is overcompensated may increase his effort. However he may also adjust the values that he ascribes to his own personal inputs. It may be that he or she internalizes a sense of superiority and actually decrease his efforts. Criticisms and related theories Criticism has been directed toward both the assumptions and practical application of equity theory. Scholars have questioned the simplicity of the model, arguing that a number of demographic and psychological variables affect people's perceptions of fairness and interactions with others. Furthermore, much of the research supporting the basic propositions of equity theory has been conducted in laboratory settings, and thus has questionable applicability to real-world situations (Huseman, Hatfield & Miles, 1987). Critics have also argued that people might perceive equity/inequity not only in terms of the specific inputs and outcomes of a relationship, but also in terms of the overarching system that determines those inputs and outputs. Thus, in a business setting, one might feel that his or her compensation is equitable to other employees', but one might view the entire compensation system as unfair (Carrell and Dittrich, 1978). Researchers have offered numerous magnifying and competing perspectives: =Equity sensitivity construct= The Equity Sensitivity Construct proposes that individuals have different preferences for equity and thus react in different ways to perceived equity and inequity. Preferences can be expressed on a continuum from preferences for extreme under-benefit to preferences for extreme over-benefit. Three archetypal classes are as follows: *Benevolent individuals, those who prefer their own input/outcome ratios to be less than those of their relational partner. In other words, the benevolent prefers to be under-benefited. *Equity Sensitives, those who prefer their own input/outcome ratios to be equal to those of their relational partner. *Entitled individuals, those who prefer their own input/outcome ratios to exceed those of their relational partner. In other words, the entitled prefers to be over-benefited. (Huseman, Hatfield & Miles, 1987) =Fairness model= The Fairness Model proposes an alternative measure of equity/inequity to the relational partner or \\"comparison person\\" of standard equity theory. According to the Fairness Model, an individual judges the overall \\"fairness\\" of a relationship by comparing their inputs and outcomes with an internally derived standard. The Fairness Model thus allows for the perceived equity/inequity of the overarching system to be incorporated into individuals' evaluations of their relationships (Carrell and Dittrich, 1978). =Game theory= Behavioral economics has recently started to apply game theory to the study of equity theory. For instance, Gill and Stone (2010) analyze how considerations of equity influence behavior in strategic settings in which people compete and develop the implications for optimal labor contracts.

There are two types of scapulars, the monastic and devotional scapular, although both forms may simply be referred to as \\"scapular\\".J L Neve, 2007, Churches and Sects of Christendom page 158Catherine Fournier, 2007, Marian Devotion in the Domestic Church Ignatius Press page 18 As an object of popular piety, it serves to remind the wearers of their commitment to live a Christian life. The \\"monastic scapular\\" appeared first, perhaps as early as the 7th century in the Order of Saint Benedict.Mackenzie Edward Charles Walcott, 2008, Sacred Archaeology Kessinger Publishing page 70 It is a somewhat large length of cloth suspended both front and back from the shoulders of the wearer, often reaching to the knees. It may vary in shape, color, size and style. Monastic scapulars originated as aprons worn by medieval monks, and were later extended to habits for members of religious organizations, orders or confraternities. Monastic scapulars now form part of the habit of monks and nuns in many Christian orders.William Johnston, Encyclopedia of Monasticism page 310 The \\"devotional scapular\\" is a much smaller item and evolved from the monastic scapular. These may also be worn by individuals who are not members of a monastic order. The devotional scapular typically consists of two small (usually rectangular) pieces of cloth, wood or laminated paper, a few inches in size, which may bear religious images or text. These are joined by two bands of cloth and the wearer places one square on the chest, rests the bands one on each shoulder and lets the second square drop down the back.James O'Toole, 2005, Habits of Devotion: Catholic Religious Practice in Twentieth-Century America, Cornell University Press page 98Matthew Bunson, 2004, Encyclopedia of Catholic History, OSV Press page 804 In many cases, both forms of the scapular come with a set of promises for the faithful who wear them. Some of the promises are rooted in tradition. For Roman Catholics, over the centuries several popes have approved specific indulgences for scapulars, as for some other objects of popular piety.Frances Andrews, 2006, The Other Friars: The Carmelite, Augustinian, Sack and Pied Friars in the Middle Ages, page 33Samuel Phillips Day, 2009, Monastic institutions BiblioLife page 108 History Abba Antony of Egypt depicted wearing a brown monastic scapular and cloak The scapular may have emerged from an apron-like piece of cloth worn by monks. Item 55 of the Rule of Saint Benedict, dating to the 7th century refers to the use of the scapular.Robert Maguire, 2008, Papal Indulgences: Two Lectures Kessinger Publishing page 53Andre Vauchez, 2001, Encyclopedia of the Middle Ages, Fitzroy Dearborn Press page 1314Terryl Nancy Kinder, 2002, Cistercian Europe, Eardman Press page 59Rule of St Benedict (RB) ch. 55.4-6: \\"‚Ä¶ in temperate regions for each monk a \\"hood(ed cloak)\\"(? cucullam, cowl) and tunic will suffice ‚Äì in winter a woolen \\"hood(ed cloak)\\"(? cucullam, cowl) is necessary, in summer a thinner or worn one ‚Äì, and a scapular for work, and footwear: socks (pedules, slip-shoes) and shoes ‚Ä¶\\" Timothy Fry, \\"RB 1980\\", p. 262, comments: \\"This word (scapulare) is found in antiquity only here in RB and in Vita patr. iuren. 3.5, where it appears as a summer garment. De Vog√º√© 6.916 thinks it is a modified version of the cuculla specially adapted for work. It clearly derives from the Latin scapula, meaning \\"shoulders\\", and it may reasonably be concluded that it was a sleeveless or short-sleeved garment ‚Ä¶ However, A. Guillaumont, \\"√âvagre le Pontique: Trait√© Pratique\\" (SC 171, Paris, √âditions du Cerf 1971, p. 488), suggests that the scapular may be the equivalent to the Greek analabos, which Cassian (inst. 1,5) translates uncertainly by three terms: subcinctoria, redimicula and rebracchiatoria, the purpose of which is to fasten the tunic for work.\\"RB 55.6 has unspecific \\"work\\", not \\"manual work\\" (in RB 48.1 called \\"manual labour\\"), whilst elsewhere there is mention of the \\"Work of God\\", arguably not only in connection with prayer (e.g. RB 7.63, 22.6, 58.7). Apparently therefore RB regards both prayer and labour as \\"work\\". Thus, whether in the oratory or in the fields, a monk is always at work, and so a \\"scapular for work\\" is to be worn always. RB 22.5 supports those who hold that it is meant to be worn even during the night rest. These considerations support the view that St Benedict meant the scapular to be worn not as protective wear but for a symbolic reason, such as with regard to the purpose of the monk in the monastery. The monks' purpose is evident from RB's own purpose, which is a compilation of precepts for those who wish by \\"the labour of obedience to return to him from whom they had drifted through the sloth of disobedience\\" (RB Prol 2) and therefore, in response to \\"the Lord seeking his workman in the multitude of people\\" (RB Prol 14), undergo \\"teaching\\" in \\"a school of the Lord's service\\" (RB Prol 45-50)... A light or minimal item of clothing, as has been suggested on linguistic grounds, would be better suited to a symbolic than a protective use. In the Catholic Church the key elements of a monk's habit eventually became the tunic, the cincture, the scapular and the hood. A nun's clothing included the tunic, the scapular and the head veil.William Johnston, Encyclopedia of Monasticism page 309 Some authors interpret the scapular as a symbolic apron based on the fact that monks and nuns, when engaged on some manual labor, tend to cover it with a protective apron or carefully tuck it up or throw the front length back over their shoulder to prevent it from getting in the way.Terrence Kardong, 1996, Benedict's Rule: A Translation and Commentary Liturgical Press page 444 Varieties =Monastic scapular= Carthusians in white hooded scapulars, by Francisco de Zurbar√°n, 1630‚Äì1635 Today, the monastic scapular is part of the garb, the habit, of many Christian religious orders, of both monks and nuns. It is an outer garment about the width of the chest, from shoulder to shoulder. It hangs down in the front and back almost to the feet, but is open on the sides (it was originally joined by straps at the waist). It is related to the analavos worn in the Eastern tradition. Historically, the monastic scapular was at times referred to as scutum (i.e. shield), as it was laid over the head, which it originally covered and protected with one portion (from which the hood afterwards developed). A specific aspect of the use of the monastic scapular from its earliest days was obedience and the term jugum Christi, i.e. \\"yoke of Christ\\", was used to refer to it. The term \\"yoke of Christ\\" signified obedience and removing a scapular was like removing the yoke of Christ, i.e. rebelling against authority. For instance, the Carmelite constitution of 1281 prescribed that the scapular should be worn to bed under penalty of serious fault, and the constitution of 1369 included automatic excommunication for a Carmelite saying Mass without a scapular.John Welch, 1996, The Carmelite Way Paulist Press page 58Father Kieran Kavanaugh, 2008, Scapular Devotion Discalced Carmelite nuns from Argentina wearing the Brown Scapular Over the centuries the religious orders adapted the basic scapular as they considered appropriate for themselves, as a result of which there are now several distinct designs, colors, shapes and lengths in use. The Carthusians and others attached a hood to their scapular, rather than keeping the former a separate item of their habit, while some, like the Dominican Order or Carmelites, wear it beneath another layer, like a shoulder cape or capuce (that is, the \\"hood\\"). The color selection could change over time; for instance, prior to 1255, the Augustinian scapulars for novices were black and those of the lay brethren were white, but thereafter all scapulars but those of the lay brethren had to be white.Francis de Zulueta, 2008, Early Steps In The Fold, Miller Press, page 89 In some cases the monastic scapular was used to distinguish the rank or level of the wearer within a religious order. For instance, in some Byzantine monastic practices, two levels of fully professed monk or nun exist: those of the \\"little habit\\" and those other of the \\"great habit\\", these being more senior and not having to do manual labor. In these cases, the \\"great habit\\" was simply distinguished from the \\"little habit\\" by the addition of a scapular decorated with the instruments of the Passion.Aleksei Pentkovsky, 1999, The Pilgrim's Tale Paulist Press page 43 Just as the stole is the vestment that came to mark the office of a priest, the monastic scapular became the equivalent for those in the monastic life and even today, a long scapular identifies its wearer as a member of a religious order. It is a symbol of the confraternal way, combining in itself the principle of ora et labora (prayer and work), and so the form was later adopted by pious laity who wished to have an open sign of their devotion. =Non-monastic reduced scapular= Some authors suggest that the tradition of wearing a reduced form of a non-monastic scapular started in the 11th century with Saint Peter Damian and the monastic scapular was gradually transformed from an item of clothing that was part of the habit of monks and nuns to a smaller item that expressed devotion by individuals, called oblates, who lived in the world, but wished to be affiliated with a monastery.Greg Dues, 1992, Catholic Customs and Traditions, Twenty-Third Publications pages 127 and 185 In the Middle Ages, it became common for Christian faithful to share in the spirituality of the new mendicant orders in an auxiliary sense, sometimes called Third Orders because they were founded after the initial orders of the friars and nuns. Although these people (called Tertiaries) were permitted to wear the \\"tertiary habit\\", because they had not taken religious vows they were not usually permitted to wear the full habit of the order. With time, it was considered a high honor and great privilege to be granted a small cloth attached by bands which would be worn over the torso in the same manner as the full monastic scapular. Confraternities came to be formed in which people would be granted the wearing of this item as a mark of their sharing in the good works of a particular order.Ann Ball, 2003 Encyclopedia of Catholic Devotions and Practices page 512 Among Franciscans, they were known as Cordbearers, due to their also wearing a small cord around the waist in imitation of the one worn by the friar. After the disruptions of religious life during the period of the French Revolution and the Napoleonic invasions of France and Italy, wearing of the tertiary habit became prohibited. Thus it eventually became common that a smaller form of an order's scapular would be bestowed upon the non-monastic. Rather than a full length of cloth, it consisted of two rectangles (several inches wide, and much larger than a modern devotional scapular) of wool joined by bands in some fashion. These are still worn today by the \\"Third Order\\" members of the Franciscans, Carmelites, and Dominicans. In order to gain the benefits of the order, the members must wear these scapulae constantly. However, in 1883 in his \\"Constitution On the Law of the Franciscan Third Order\\" called Misericors Dei Filius, Pope Leo XIII declared that wearing either these medium-sized scapulae of the \\"Third Order\\" or the miniature forms of the smaller devotional scapular entitled the wearer equally to gain the indulgences associated with the order.Misericors Dei Filius at the Franciscan Archive Some religious orders still give a short version (sometimes called the \\"reduced scapular\\", but this usage is archaic) of their large scapular to non-monastics that are spiritually affiliated with them. Such short scapulars are designed to be unobtrusive and can be worn under regular clothing at home and at work. =Devotional scapular= The devotional scapular of Our Lady of Mount Carmel or Brown Scapular Devotional scapulars are objects of popular piety, primarily worn by Roman Catholics, as well as some Anglicans and Lutherans, designed to show the wearer's pledge to a confraternity, a saint, or a way of life, as well as reminding the wearer of that promise. Some devotional scapulars bear images, or verses from scripture. Devotional scapulars typically consist of two rectangular pieces of cloth, wool or other fabric that are connected by bands. One rectangle hangs over the chest of the wearer, while the other rests on the back, with the bands running over the shoulders. Some scapulars have extra bands running under the arms and connecting the rectangles to prevent them from getting dislodged underneath the wearer's top layer of clothes. Rosary and scapular The roots of devotional scapulars can be traced to the gathering of laity into confraternities for spiritual direction, whereby the faithful would be assigned some badge or token of affiliation and devotion. The image or message on the scapular usually reflects the order's focus, tradition or favored devotion.Francis de Zulueta, 2008, Early Steps In The Fold: Instructions for Converts, and Enquirers, Miller Press, page 300 Devotional scapulars and the indulgences attached to them grew along with the growth of Catholic confraternities during the 17th and 18th centuries. The fact that specific promises and indulgences were attached to the wearing of scapulars helped increase their following, as was seen with the early example of the Brown Scapular, habit of the Carmelites.Henry Charles Lea, 2002, A History of Auricular Confession and Indulgences in the Latin Church, Adamant Media Corp. page 263 This promise was based on the Carmelite tradition that the Blessed Virgin Mary appeared to St. Simon Stock at Cambridge, England in 1251 in answer to his appeal for help for his oppressed order and recommended the Brown Scapular of the Our Lady of Mount Carmel to him and promised salvation for the faithful who wore it piously.Donovan STL, Colin. \\"Brown Scapular\\", EWTNMatthew Bunson, 2008, The Catholic Almanac, page 155Gerald M. Costello, 2001, Treasury of Catholic Stories, OSV Press, , page 128 Regardless of the scholarly debates regarding the exact origin of the Brown Scapular, it is clear that it has been a part of the Carmelite habit since the late 13th century. Our Lady of Mount Carmel statue in Chile with a Brown Scapular, an example of the use of the scapular in Marian art The Blue Scapular of the Immaculate Conception that dates to 1617 was eventually granted a significant number of indulgences, and many graces were promised to those who would honor the Immaculate Conception by wearing the Blue Scapular and live chastely according to their state in life. In 1885 Pope Leo XIII approved the Scapular of the Holy Face, (also known as The Veronica) and elevated the Priests of the Holy Face to an archconfraternity.Henry Charles Lea, 2002, A History of Auricular Confession and Indulgences in the Latin Church, Adamant Media Corp. page 506 He also approved the Scapular of Our Lady of Good Counsel and the Scapular of St. Joseph, both in 1893, and the Scapular of the Sacred Heart in 1900.Francis de Zulueta, 2008, Early Steps In The Fold, Miller Press, page 317 In 1611, the Servite Order's confraternity and their Black Scapular of the Seven Sorrows of Mary received indulgences from Pope Paul V.Henry Charles Lea, 2002, A History of Auricular Confession and Indulgences in the Latin Church, Adamant Media Corp. page 469 During the 19th century, a number of other Scapulars were approved. The green Scapular of the Immaculate Heart of Mary was approved by Pope Pius IX in 1877 and the white Scapular of Our Lady of Good Counsel received the approval of Leo XIII in 1893 for the purpose of invoking Mary's guidance upon its wearer. The black Scapular of Our Lady Help of the Sick, (for the Confraternity founded by St. Camillus de Lellis) was approved by Pius IX in 1860. In 1863 he also approved the Green Scapular, which is not from a Confraternity but an image inspired by a vision of the Blessed Mother experienced by Sr. Justine Bisqueyburu from the Daughters of Charity of Saint Vincent de Paul. By the early 20th century the devotional scapular had gained such a strong following among Catholics worldwide that Joseph Hilgers, in the Catholic Encyclopedia of 1912 stated: \\"Like the rosary, [the Brown Scapular] has become the badge of the devout Catholic\\". In the 1917 reported apparitions of Our Lady of F√°tima the Virgin Mary is said to have appeared \\"with a Rosary in one hand and a scapular in the other\\". Sister L√∫cia (one of the three F√°tima children visionaries) stated that the Virgin Mary told her: \\"The Rosary and the Scapular are inseparable\\".Thomas W. Petrisk, 1998, The Fatima Prophecies, St. Andrews Press, page 345Lucia Santos, 1976, Fatima in Lucia's Own Words, Ravengate Press Lynette Marie Ordaz, 2008, The Real Mary, Authorhouse Books, page 88 In the United States \\"Scapular Magazine\\" helped enroll one million Americans to pray the Rosary based on the Fatima messages.Eli Lederhendler, 2006 Jews, Catholics, and the Burden of History Oxford University Press page 98 The Rosary and the devotional scapular continue to be linked in the 21st century.Zenit News 2008 Cardinal Urges Devotion to Rosary and Scapular While a number of scapulars (e.g. the Scapular of the Holy Face, also known as The Veronica) are entirely Christocentric, the most widespread scapulars (including the Brown Scapular of Our Lady of Mount Carmel and the Blue Scapular of the Immaculate Conception) relate to Marian devotions and consecrations.Blue Scapular of the Immaculate Conception John Paul II stated that he received his first Brown Scapular of Mount Carmel at age ten when his Marian devotion was taking shape and he continued to wear it into his papacy.Pope John Paul II, 1996, Gift And Mystery, Doubleday Books page 28 The Catholic Encyclopedia lists 18 small scapulars approved by the Roman Catholic church: # The White Scapular of the Most Blessed Trinity (1193) # The White Scapular of Our Lady of Ransom (1218) # The Brown Scapular of Our Lady of Mount Carmel (1250) # The Black Scapular of the Seven Sorrows of Mary (1255) # The Blue Scapular of the Immaculate Conception # The Red Scapular of the Most Precious Blood # The Black Scapular of the Passion (1720) # The Red Scapular of the Passion (1846) # The Black Scapular of Help of the Sick (1860) # The White Scapular of the Immaculate Heart of Mary (1877) # The Blue and Black Scapular of St. Michael the Archangel (1880) # The Scapular of St. Benedict (1882) # The Scapular of the Holy Face (1885) # The White Scapular of the Our Lady of Good Counsel (1893) # The White Scapular of St. Joseph (1898) # The White Scapular of The Most Sacred Heart of Jesus (1900) # The Scapular of the Sacred Hearts of Jesus and Mary (1901) # The White Scapular of St. Dominic (1903) Of all the types recognized by the Roman Catholic Church the best-known, and perhaps the most popular, is the Scapular of Our Lady of Mount Carmel, sometimes referred to as the Brown Scapular from the color of its bands. The wearing of a devotional scapular has been viewed as a constant meditation by Bishop Leo De Goesbriand: \\"Wherever I am, whatever I am doing, Mary never sees me without seeing upon my body an evidence of my devotion to her.\\"L. De Goesbriand 2008, Meditations for the Use of the Secular Clergy page 408 This scapular, with its history in Britain, along with the Scapular of Our Lady of Walsingham are also popular devotions in the Anglican Church. The Green Scapular, \\"instituted for the conversion of those without faith\\" is another popular scapular among the Christian community. From a spiritual viewpoint, Father Etienne Richer argues that devotional scapular is one of key Roman Catholic devotions that harmonize with Catholic Liturgy in the meditative process.Raymond Burke, 2008, Mariology: A Guide for Priests, Deacons,seminarians, and Consecrated Persons, Queenship Publishing page 667 =In Protestant churches= Scapular wearing is sometimes found in Protestant churches including Anglican, Lutheran, and Methodist. Instructions are provided in United Methodist Church allowing scapular to be worn over the alb by anyone lay or clergy, not as a pastoral stole or chasuble, either colored for the Church season or not.https://www.umcdiscipleship.org/resources/12-simple-rules-on-what-to-wear- what-not-to-wear-umc-edition referenced 23-June-2019 Some Anglican churches use the scapular to designate the difference of vestments between choristers boys and girlshttps://lincolncathedral.com/worship-music/chorister-lincoln- cathedral/ referenced 23-June-2019http://media.gettyimages.com/photos/choristers-from-the-salisbury- cathedral-choir-practice-ahead-of-the-picture-id158668662?s=612x612 referenced 23-June-2019, a tradition that continues in Church of South India for women and men.https://i.ytimg.com/vi/jEZOBpwt5uc/maxresdefault.jpg referenced 8 July 2019 Lutheran churches sometimes use scapulars as vestments for both men and women servershttp://trinitywv.org/worship-music.html referenced 23-June-2019 over cassocks which are regarded as clerical clothinghttp://download.elca.org/ELCA%20Resource%20Repository/What_are_vestments_and_paraments_Why_are_they_used.pdf referenced 23-June-2109 not vestments. Scapulars in Protestant churches do not necessarily have the same meaning as in Catholic church. Choirs may wear scapular over alb in Lutheran colleges. Investment, blessing and rules Though each scapular has its own particular qualifications and usage, the Roman Catholic Church has set down certain rules that pertain to all its types, be they monastic or devotional. A scapular associated with a confraternity must be invested by an ordained representative of that group. A scapular associated with a mystery or devotion may simply be blessed by a priest and given to the wearer. To receive the benefits or indulgences granted the scapular generally must be worn constantly. It may be placed aside for a time but, during that period, the wearer does not receive the scapular's benefits. Should the wearer take up the wearing of it again, the benefits are again conferred. A devotional scapular must be in good repair with both bands intact. Multiple scapulae may be worn on the same bands, but the bands must be the color of those prescribed by the scapular with the most preeminence, and that scapular must be foremost with the others behind in order of precedence. If a scapular becomes damaged to the point where it cannot be in good repair, it must be replaced. However, it is not necessary for the wearer to be reinvested as it is the devotion of the wearer, not the object itself, that confers the benefit of the scapular.

It has a long history dating back to the Achaemenid period. In ancient times, it was one of the main centers of the Academy of Gondishapur. Etymology The word Ahvaz is a modern Persianized form of the Arabic \\"Ahwaz\\" which in turn, is derived from an older Persian word. The Dehkhoda Dictionary specifically defines the \\"Suq-al-Ahvaz\\" as \\"Market of the Khuzis\\", where \\"Suq\\" is the Elamite word for market, and \\"Ahvaz\\" is a broken plural () of the form \\"af'ƒÅl\\" () of the word \\"Huz\\", which itself comes from the Persian Huz, from Achaemenid inscriptions where the term first appears. Thus, \\"Ahvaz\\" in Persian means \\"the Huz-i people\\", which refers to the Khuzi original inhabitants of Kh≈´zestƒÅn. The name of the region appears in medieval Syriac sources as ', literally meaning \\"land of the Huzis\\". The term \\"Huz\\", meanwhile, is the Old Persian rendition of Suz (Susa-Susiana), the native Elamite name of the region. See Origin of the name Khuzestan and Elam#Etymology for more details. History =Ancient history= Ahvaz is the analog of \\"Avaz\\" and \\"Avaja\\" which appear in Darius's epigraph. This word appears in Naqsh-Rostam inscription as \\"Khaja\\" or \\"Khooja\\" too. First named ≈åhrmazd-Arda≈°ƒìr (Persian: Hormizdartazir)Dodgeon M. H. and Lieu S. N. C., The Roman Eastern Frontier and The Persian Wars; A Documentary History, London (1991), p.35; it was built near the beginning of the Sassanid dynasty on what historians believe to have been the site of the old city of Taryana, a notable city under the Persian Achaemenid dynasty, or the city of Aginis referred to in Greek sources where Nearchus and his fleet entered the Pafitigris.. It was founded either by Ardashir I in 230 (cf. Encyclop√¶dia Iranica, al-Muqaddasi, et al.) or (according to the Middle Persian ≈†ahrestƒÅnƒ´hƒÅ ƒ´ ƒírƒÅn≈°ahr) by his grandson Hormizd I; the cities name either combined Ardashir's name with the Zoroastrian name for God, ≈åhrmazd or Hormizd's name with that of his grandfather. It became the seat of the province, and was also referred to as H≈´m≈°ƒìr. During the Sassanid era, an irrigation system and several dams were constructed, and the city prospered. Examples of Sassanid-era dams are Band-e Bala-rud, Band-e Mizan, Band-e Borj Ayar and Band-e Khak. The city replaced Susa, the ancient capital of Susiana, as the capital of what was then called KhuzestƒÅn. The city had two sections; the nobles of the city lived in one part while the other was inhabited by merchants.cf. Encyclop√¶dia Iranica When the Arabs invaded the area in 640, the part of the city home to the nobility was demolished but the H≈´j-ƒ´-stƒÅnwƒÅƒçƒÅr \\"Market of Kh≈´z State\\", the merchant area, remained intact. The city was therefore renamed S≈´q al-AhwƒÅz, \\"Market of the Khuz\\", a semi-literal translation of the Persian name of this quarter - AhwƒÅz being the Arabic broken plural of H√ªz, taken from the ancient Persian term for the native Elamite peoples, H≈´ja (remaining in medieval kh≈´zƒ´g \\"of the Khuzh\\" and modern KhuzestƒÅn \\"Khuz State\\", as noted by Dehkhoda dictionary). =Medieval history= During the Umayyad and Abbasid eras, Ahvaz flourished as a center for the cultivation of sugarcane and as the home of many well- known scholars. It is discussed by such respected medieval historians and geographers as ibn Hawqal, Tabari, Istakhri, al-Muqaddasi, Ya'qubi, Masudi, and Mostowfi Qazvini. Nearby stood the Academy of Gundishapur, where the modern-day teaching hospital is said to have been first established. Ahvaz was devastated in the Mongol invasions of the 13th and 14th centuries and subsequently declined into a village. The dam and irrigation channels, no longer maintained, eroded and finally collapsed early in the 19th century. During this time Ahvaz was primarily inhabited by the original Khuzhis and a small number of Sabians. Although most Arab migrants fled the city, a few stayed. Some minor cultivation continued, while all evidence of sugarcane plantations is still going on in Haft Teppe area in north of Ahvaz, although ruins of sugarcane mills from the medieval era remained in existence.X. de Planhol, Encyclop√¶dia Iranica Several ruins of water mills also still remain in Shush and Shushtar. = Modern history = The seat of the province has, for the most of its history, been in its northern reaches, first at Susa (Shush) and then at Shushtar. During a short spell in the Sasanian era, the capital of the province was moved to its geographical center, where the river town of Hormuz-Ardashir (modern Ahvaz). However, later in the Sasanian time and throughout the Islamic era, the provincial seat returned and stayed at Shushtar, until the late Qajar period. With the increase in the international sea commerce arriving on the shores of Khuzestan, Ahvaz became a more suitable location for the provincial capital. The River Karun is navigable all the way to Ahvaz (above which, the Karun flows through rapids). The town was thus refurbished by the order of the Qajar king, Naser al-Din Shah and renamed after him, N√¢seri. Shushtar quickly declined, while Ahvaz/N√¢seri prospered to the present day. In the 19th century, \\"Ahvaz was no more than a small borough inhabited mainly by Sabeans (1,500 to 2,000 inhabitants according to Ainsworth in 1835; 700 according to Curzon in 1890).\\"Encyclop√¶dia Iranica, p.690, see entry: Ahvaz In the 1880s, under Qajar rule, the Karun River was dredged and re-opened to commerce. A newly built railway crossed the Karun at Ahvaz. The city again became a commercial crossroads, linking river and rail traffic. The construction of the Suez Canal further stimulated trade. A port city was built near the old village of Ahvaz, and named Bandar-e-Naseri in honor of Nassereddin Shah Qajar. Oil was found near Ahvaz in the early 20th century, and the city once again grew and prospered as a result of this newfound wealth. From 1897 to 1925, the city of Ahvaz was in the hands of heshmatoddoleh Ghajar, who acted as governor and Sarhang Reza Gholi Khane Arghoon commander of Ghajari's army based in Khuzestan. Sheikh Khaz'al was recognized by Mozaffar ad-Din Shah Qajar as hereditary ruler of Mohammerah, Sardar Asad Bakhtiari as the most powerful leader of Khuzestan's Bakhtiaries. He had power and authority over most regions of Khuzestan, such as Dezful, Shushtar, Izeh, even Ahvaz and Amir mojahede bakhtiari in Ramhormoz and Behbahan. At this time, the newly founded Ahvaz was named N√¢seri in honour to its founder Nassereddin Shah Qajar. Afterwards, during the Pahlavi period, it resumed its old name, Ahvaz. The government of the Kh≈´zestƒÅn Province was transferred there from Sh√ªshtar in 1926. The Trans-Iranian Railway reached Ahvaz in 1929 and by World War II, Ahvaz had become the principal built-up area of the interior of Kh≈´zestƒÅn. Professional segregation remained well marked between various groups in that period still feebly integrated: Persians, sub-groupings of Persians and Arabs. Natives of the Isfahan region held an important place in retail trade, owners of cafes and hotels and as craftsmen.Ibid, p.690 Iraq attempted to annex Kh≈´zestƒÅn and Ahvaz in 1980, resulting in the Iran‚ÄìIraq War (1980‚Äì1988). Ahvaz was close to the front lines and suffered badly during the war. Iraq had pressed its claims to Kh≈´zestƒÅn. Iraq had hoped to exacerbate ethnic tensions and win over popular support for the invaders. Most accounts say that the Iranian Arab inhabitants resisted the Iraqis rather than welcome them as liberators. However, some Iranian Arabs claim that as a minority they face discrimination from the central government; they agitate for the right to preserve their cultural and linguistic distinction and more provincial autonomy.

The Sapygidae are a small family with only about 80 species described, and they are not of major economic importance.

In contrast to traditionalADS Chapter 479 Hours of Duty work arrangements that require employees to work a standard 9a.m. to 5p.m. day, flextime typically involves a \\"core\\" period of the day during which employees are required to be at work (e.g., between 11a.m. and 3p.m.), and a \\"bandwidth\\" period within which all required hours must be worked (e.g., between 5:30 a.m. and 7:30 p.m.). The working day outside of the \\"core\\" period is \\"flexible time\\", in which employees can choose when they work, subject to achieving total daily, weekly or monthly hours within the \\"bandwidth\\" period set by employers, and subject to the necessary work being done. The total working time required of employees on flextime schedules is the same as that required under traditional work schedules. A flextime policy allows staff to determine when they will work, while a flexplace policy allows staff to determine where they will work. Advantages include allowing employees to coordinate their work hours with public transport schedules, with the schedules of their children, and with daily traffic patterns to avoid high congestion times such as rush hour. Some claim that flexible working will change the nature of the way we work. The idea of flextime was invented by Christel Kammerer.

(2018) 'Women's Work Penalty' in access to flexible working arrangements across Europe. European Journal of Industrial Relations. Many studies examine the outcomes of flexible working.

There is increasing evidence for the \\"business case\\" of flexible working. A meta analysis of studies have shown that flexible working can provide a wide range of benefits for companies, including increase in performance, productivity, and reduction in absenteeism etc.de Menezes, LM and Kelliher, C.

Flexible working can both prevent and create opportunities. There is generally a positive relationship between flexible working and perceptions of job quality in term of work-life balance and helping to improve and control autonomy particularly for remote workers, but some factors such as opportunities for advancement will be negatively affected due to the variations on different dimensions of job quality.Kelliher, C. & Anderson, D., 2008.

Flexible employment is one of the vital factors in the European Union policy discourse. It is a means to reduce unemployment, increase economic and social cohesion, maintain economic competitiveness and enhance equal opportunities between women and men.Perrons, D., 1999. Flexible Working Patterns and Equal Opportunities in the European Union Conflict or Compatibility? European Journal of International Law Journal of women study. 6 (4), pp.391-418 However, flexible working is not without problems. Studies have also shown that flexible working can lead to increase in overtime hours.  The European Commission  In 2017, the European Commission proposed the Directive on Work-Life Balance which includes the extension of the right to request flexible working arrangements (reduced working hours, flexible working hours and flexibility in place of work) to all working parents of children up to 12 and carers with dependent relatives. It also includes non legislative measures ensuring protection against discrimination and dismissal for parents (including pregnant women and workers coming back from a leave) and carers, and encouraging a gender-balanced use of family-related leaves and flexible working arrangements.  United Kingdom  Haller founded a company in the UK in 1971 and registered the trademark \\"Flextime\\", the mark remains the property of that company's successor hfx Ltd. In spring 2003, 17.7% of men and 26.7% of women were employed with flexitime arrangements in the United Kingdom, (Office for National Statistics 2003). In the United Kingdom, flexitime working is commonplace in both the private and public sectors. The practice is often found in administrative and back office functions of commercial organisations and local councils. In 2003, the UK Government introduced legislation that gave parents of children under 6, or the parents of disabled children under 18, the right in law to request a flexible working arrangement from their employer. A survey in 2005 by the National Office of Statistics showed that 71% of female workers and 60% of male workers were aware of the rights created under the 2003 legislation. Between 2003 and 2005 more than 14% of all workers had requested a change to flexible working. Since April 2007 the right to request flexible working also applies to carers of adults. On 13 November 2012 Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg announced plans to extend the right to request flexible working to all employees, this legislation takes effect in April 2014. Lawyers have suggested that this will lead to \\"major headaches\\" for employers. Now being enforced by the law on 30 June 2014, industrial reports concentrate on workers right to request for flexible working and how it is guided by Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service (ACAS).

Shift workers are generally excluded from flextime schemes as are senior managers. Other groups of workers for whom flextime arrangements are rare include those who serve the public during specific opening times. The advantages of Flextime for the individual include a better work-life balance, fewer commutes, less fatigue, more days off, lower sickness rates. The benefits for the company include; better motivated workers, more efficient and effective operation, less fatigued workers, so fewer errors; they get people working overtime hours without paying overtime rates, fewer facilities required, and lower sickness rates. For employers, flextime can aid the recruitment and retention of staff. It has been a particularly popular option in 2009 for employers trying to reduce staff costs without having to make redundancies during the recession. It can also help provide staff cover outside normal working hours and reduce the need for overtime. Additionally flextime can also improve the provision of equal opportunities to staff unable to work standard hours. Flextime can give employees greater freedom to organize their working lives to suit personal needs. In addition, travelling can be cheaper and easier if it is out of peak time.  United States  In Florida, flextime workers, like salaried workers, are exempted from insurance regulations, and are given broad leeway in setting their own work schedule. Unlike exempted salaried workers, employers are still required to pay overtime to a flextime worker if they work more than 40 hours per week. In recent years, the term \\"flextime\\" has acquired a more controversial definition when used to describe proposals to overhaul the nation's overtime regulations. Under one such proposal by the Bush administration made public on August 5, 2004, employers would not be required to pay non-exempt employees overtime for working more than 40 hours in a week so long as the employee works no more than 80 hours over a two-week period. For example, a worker could be required to work 70 hours one week and receive no overtime compensation as long as they work 10 hours or less the following week. Such arrangements are opposed by trade unions such as the AFL-CIO. In certain industries and disciplines, such as information technology, flextime permits workers to vary their schedule. For example, they may opt to work four 10-hour days per week, taking Monday or Friday off. Another flextime schedule is to work nine-hour days Monday through Thursday, an eight-hour day on Friday, taking every other Friday off. Some agencies of the United States government allow employees to work such a schedule, and designate it as an alternative work schedule (AWS).FEDweek, The 2014 Federal Employees Handbook (2013). Workers may arrange to coordinate their days off so that their responsibilities are adequately covered. Other workers may opt simply to come in early, such as 5 or 6a.m., and leave in the mid-afternoon, or come in late and therefore leave late. One benefit of such a schedule is that commuting times occur outside of the congested rush hour traffic within a given geographic region. Flextime arrangements also help parents: one parent works 10a.m. ‚Äì 6p.m. and is in charge of the children before school / daycare, while the other parent works 7a.m. ‚Äì 3p.m. and is in charge of the children after school / daycare. This allows parents time to commute. Flextime is also beneficial to workers pursuing an education. It is an ongoing part of the work-life balance discussions in many companies.  Australia  Flexi-time in Australia is usually referred to accumulated overtime hours that an employee can build up and exchange for the equivalent amount of time off. (Example: Jane works 7a.m. ‚Äì 3p.m. Monday to Friday. Over the past month, Jane has worked 8 hours overtime meaning she is eligible for a paid day off.) If employees accumulate too many flex hours, they are required to perform a \\"flex burndown\\", as they are burning down the flex. Similarly, taking a flex day off is known as \\"flexing\\". It is implemented formally in the federal Australian Public Service and is available for staff in most state and territory government departments. With current changes to industrial relations laws (2006), from State to Federal level there are no new published guidelines (online) for flexi-time.  Recording working  There are many different methods used for recording working time ranging from sophisticated software (computer programs) to handwritten time sheets. Most of these methods are associated with the payment of wages in return for hours worked. As a result, they often do not address a fundamental difference of most flexible working systems ‚Äì namely the intention of flexible working to allow an employee to \\"trade hours\\" with their employer in return for a fixed wage ().  Millennials  \\"Millennial\\" is the name most commonly used to describe those born between 1980 and 2000. As the right to request for flexible working is extended to all by law, many benefits are expected to rise. With \\"Millennials\\" becoming the interest of many organisations, flexible working seems to attract them.BBC, 2014. Flexible working rights extended to all. [Online]. Available at: https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-28078690. Accessed 3 February 2015. As ethnic diversity and high level of education are their main characteristics, it is seen that Millennials are more likely to change their jobs more than the previous generation for economic reasons. Additionally, due to the delay in the retirement of baby boomers' generation, gaps in workforce were created, waiting for the Millennial generation to fill them.Red Tree Leadership & Development, 2012, The Millennial Takeover. Visually website. [Online]. Available at: http://visual.ly/millennial-takeover. Accessed 4 February 2015.  Advantages and criticisms  Flexible working is a pattern of working arrangements that enable employees to decide the time, duration, and location of their work.Fell, S.S., 2013. Top 10 Benefits of Flexible Work Policies for Companies. Available at: http://www.huffingtonpost.com/sara-sutton- fell/top-10-benefits-of-flexib_b_4158603.html Flexible working patterns have gained the interest of both academics and industrial practitioners for some time, with implementation into law in certain countries as far back as 1930, but also in recent years. Existing literature highlights the fundamental importance of flexible working to both academics and organizations as a means of establishing a good work‚Äìlife balance for employees; work-life balance for employees is theorized to increase employee efficiency, which in turns leads to increase in productivity of the organisation.Silla, I., 2005. Job Insecurity and Health-Related Outcomes among Different Types of Temporary Workers. Economic and Industrial Democracy, 26(1), pp.89‚Äì117Guest, D., 2004. Flexible employment contracts, the psychological contract and employee outcomes: an analysis and review of the evidence. International Journal of Management Reviews, 5-6(1), pp.1‚Äì19 This would also be suggested from research on the decreasing returns of working hours. Academic literature has identified benefits of flexible working patterns to employees including life satisfaction, better wellbeing, a good work-life balance,Stanger, M., 2014. Companies That Offer Flexible Schedules Get More Out Of Their Employees. Available at: http://www.businessinsider.com/most-flexible-employers- according-to-payscale-2013-1 and health benefits but some researchers argue that although there are such benefits, there are some negative effect such as work intensity, job insecurity associated with flexible working arrangement. Research works such as Evans et al., (2000) also highlight that flexible working pattern may not be applicable to all occupational fields, the authors also heighted the medical profession as one of such fields.Evans, J., Goldacra, M. & Lambert, T., 2000. Views of UK medical graduates about ¬Ø exible and part-time working in medicine : a qualitative study., pp.355‚Äì362 A further critique is that some patterns of work deemed \\"flexible\\" such as a compressed work week may be put forward by the employer, rather than suiting the individual employee, and thus may not capture the same benefits as employee- chosen flexible working. Industrial sources also have been able to highlight one of the positive effects of flexible working patterns as being able to attract highly qualified professionals, but BrookinsBrookins, M., 2015. Negatives of Flexible Work Schedules. Available at: http://smallbusiness.chron.com/negatives-flexible-work-schedules-1236.html established some negative effects flexible working patterns had to employers as it adds expenses and responsibility on the organisation, negative availability perspectives of employees on the customers, and employee availability. Both academics and industrial sources were established that in some professions flexible working arrangement may not be available or its availability will have a negative perspective on employees by others with a non-flexible arrangement, example of such profession is the medical profession. The researcher done by Evans et al., (2000) on flexible working patterns in the medical profession emphasized how some medical doctors may attributes negative perception with colleagues with flexible working pattern. In 1930, Employees in the United Kingdom were given the right to request for flexible working arrangement, but there was no instructions or guideline on the way for this would work. Flexible working concept is also a relatively new form of working arrangement and this has limited its application in other parts of the world such as some region in Africa. Flexible working patterns is a working arrangement that enable employees to determine the duration, time and location of their work. It has been seen both by academics and industrial sources to have benefit sure as increase of work-life balance for employee, which in turns leads to increase in productivity for the employer or organisation. Organisations hoping to adopt this form of working pattern for its employee should conduct research on how flexible working pattern can be successfully conducted, thus avoiding some of the expenses and pitfalls existing research has linked to flexible working practices.  Flexible working time accounts  Flexible working time accounts is also known as deposited working-time accounts or work bank account system. It is derived from the German Federal Labor Government's reform program, which was passed by the German Federal Government on August 21, 2002. Then Federal Chancellor, Gerhard Schr√∂der, announced that the program will invite the former director of human resources management of Volkswagen company, Peter Hartz, chaired the Labour Market Reform Committee. This program's goal is to make the rigidity of the labor system more flexible and to change the old social welfare policy, in order to lighten heavy financial burden. =Definitions= The concept of flexible working time accounts is to establish labor-self accounts, and labors can save their working hours, just like saving money, into their own accounts. The working hours in their accounts are their assets, so that employers and workers both sides can increase or decrease the work required by each other without affecting the salaries and welfare. While achieving the purpose of flexible labor, and the account-system may be short-term, long or permanent (life-time) of the convention. =Characteristics= Flexible working time accounts system has the following four characteristics # Flexible working time accounts shall be calculated for at least the period of one year. # The calculation of long-term account system is usually based on time and money, occasionally there may be passed on from other labors' accounts, the situation is only applicable to short-term working time. # When using long-term working time accounts, there are two features can be used to classify: ## Optional long-term accounts Most using of optional long-term accounts occur in the period that labors are still holding a post in their own company, labors can withdraw from accounts after negotiating between employers and labors, usually due to labors'personally needs. ## Aged-related long-term accounts Aged-related long-term accounts can be used when labors'career get mature, preparing of early retirement. semi-retirement, or preparation of retirement. # Unlike the short-term account system, there is the lowest limit standard of withdrawing hours, however, the setting of standard is according to different demand of labors.

(circa 1350) The noun mohel (mohala in Aramaic) \\"circumciser\\", is derived from the same verb stem as milah \\"circumcision.\\" The noun appeared for the first time in the fourth century as the title of a circumciser (Shabbat 156a). Origins of circumcision For Jews, male circumcision is mandatory as it is prescribed in the Torah. In the Book of Genesis, it is described as a mark of the Covenant between God and the descendants of Abraham: \\"Throughout all generations, every male shall be circumcised when he is eight days old...This shall be my covenant in your flesh, an eternal covenant. The uncircumcised male whose foreskin has not been circumcised, shall have his soul cut off from his people; he has broken my Covenant\\".Genesis 17:9-14 at bible.ort.org In Leviticus: \\"God spoke to Moses, telling him to speak to the Israelites: When a woman conceives and gives birth to a boy ... on the eighth day, the flesh of his foreskin shall be circumcised.\\"Leviticus 12:1-3 at bible.ort.org Functions Biblically, the infant's father (avi haben) is commanded to perform the circumcision himself. However, as most fathers are not comfortable or do not have the training, they designate a mohel. The mohel is specially trained in circumcision and the rituals surrounding the procedure. Many mohalim are doctors or rabbis (and some are both) or cantors and are required to receive appropriate training both from the religious and medical fields. Traditionally, the mohel uses a scalpel to circumcise the newborn. Today, doctors and some non-Orthodox mohalim use a perforating clamp before they cut the skin. The clamp makes it easier to be precise and shortens recovery time. Orthodox mohalim have rejected perforating clamps, arguing that by crushing and killing the skin it causes a great amount of unnecessary pain to the newborn, cutting off the blood flow completely, which according to Jewish law is dangerous to the child and strictly forbidden, and also renders the orlah (foreskin) as cut prior to the proper ritual cut. Under Jewish law, a mohel must draw blood from the circumcision wound. Most mohels do it by hand with a suction device,Rabbi probed for circumcised infants' herpes, nbcnews.com, 2 February 2005. Retrieved 2 February 2015. but some follow the traditional practice of doing it by mouth. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued a warning in 2012 about the health implications of the latter practice, citing 11 cases of neonatal Herpes simplex virus (HSV) and two recorded fatalities. A 2013 review of cases of neonatal HSV infections in Israel identified ritual circumcision as the source of HSV-1 transmission in 31.8% of the cases. Female mohels According to traditional Jewish law, in the absence of a Jewish male expert, a woman that has the required skills is also authorized to perform the circumcision, provided that she is Jewish.Talmud Avodah Zarah 27a; Menachot 42a; Maimonides' Mishneh Torah, Milah, 2:1; Shulkhan Arukh, Yoreh De'ah, 264:1 Non-Orthodox Judaism allows female mohels, called mohalot (, plural of mohelet, feminine of mohel), without restriction. In 1984, Dr. Deborah Cohen became the first certified Reform Jewish mohelet; she was certified by the Berit Mila Program of Reform Judaism. In popular culture In the popular sitcom Seinfeld, a mohel played by Charles Levin appears in the episode The Bris.

An individual with astereognosis is unable to identify objects by handling them, despite intact elementary tactile, proprioceptive, and thermal sensation. With the absence of vision (i.e. eyes closed), an individual with astereognosis is unable to identify what is placed in their hand based on cues such as texture, size, spatial properties, and temperature. As opposed to agnosia, when the object is observed visually, one should be able to successfully identify the object. Individuals with tactile agnosia may be able to identify the name, purpose, or origin of an object with their left hand but not their right, or vice versa, or both hands. Astereognosis refers specifically to those who lack tactile recognition in both hands. In the affected hand(s) they may be able to identify basic shapes such as pyramids and spheres (with abnormally high difficulty) but still not tactilely recognize common objects by easily recognizable and unique features such as a fork by its prongs (though the individual may report feeling a long, metal rod with multiple, pointy rods stemming off in uniform direction). These symptoms suggest that a very specific part of the brain is responsible for making the connections between tactile stimuli and functions/relationships of those stimuli, which, along with the relatively low impact this disorder has on a person's quality of life, helps explain the rarity of reports and research of individuals with tactile agnosia. However in some cases, those persons with tactile agnosia may have many challenges in daily life and occupation. An example is a task that requires typing quickly, as this agnosia type prevents the recognition of keys without looking at a keyboard. Astereognosis is associated with lesions of the parietal lobe or dorsal column or parieto-temporo-occipital lobe (posterior association areas) of either the right or left hemisphere of the cerebral cortex. Despite cross-talk between the dorsal and ventral cortices, fMRI results suggest that those with ventral cortex damage are less sensitive to object 3D structure than those with dorsal cortex damage. Unlike the ventral cortex, the dorsal cortex can compute object representations. Thus, those with object recognition impairments are more likely to have acquired damage to the dorsal cortex. Those suffering from Alzheimer‚Äôs disease show a reduction in stereognosis, the ability to perceive and recognize the form of an object in the absence of visual and auditory information. This supports the notion that astereognosis appears to be an associative disorder in which the connections between tactile information and memory is disturbed. While astereognosis is characterized by the lack of tactile recognition in both hands, it seems to be closely related to tactile agnosia (impairment connected to one hand). Tactile agnosia observations are rare and case-specific. Josef Gerstmann recounts his experience with patient JH, a 34-year-old infantryman who suffered a lesion to the posterior parietal lobe due to a gunshot. Following the injury, JH was unable to recognize or identify everyday objects by their meaning, origin, purpose and use with his left hand using tactile sensation alone. His motility performance, elementary sensitivity, and speech were intact, and he lacked abnormalities in brain nerves. The majority of all objects JH touched with his left hand went unrecognized, but very simple objects (i.e. globes, pyramids, cube, etc.) were regularly recognized based on form alone. For more complex objects, his behavior and recognition varied daily based on his tactile resources that changed over time and depended on his fatigue. That is, JH‚Äôs ability to recognize depended on his concentration and ability to recognize simple forms and single qualities like size, shape, etc. With further interrogation and greater effort, he was able to correctly identify more specific features of an object (i.e. softness, rounded or cornered, broad or narrow) and could even draw a copy of it, but he was often left unable to identify the object by name, use, or origin. This behavioral deficit occurred even if JH had handled the object in his fully intact right hand. Interventions tend to focus on helping these patients and their family and caregivers cope and adapt to the condition, and furthermore, to help patients function independently within their context.

The band was composed of Alun Woodward (vocals, guitar), Emma Pollock (vocals, guitar), Stewart Henderson (bass), and Paul Savage (drums). Biography The band was formed after friends Woodward, Henderson and Savage were ejected from the band Bubblegum. Joined by Savage's then-girlfriend Pollock, the band named themselves after Tour de France winning cyclist, Pedro Delgado. Their first commercial release came with the inclusion of their track \\"Liquidation Girl\\" on the compilation album Skookum Chief Powered Teenage Zit Rock Angst from Nardwuar the Human Serviette. Instead of signing to a record label, the band started their own, Chemikal Underground, on which they released their own records and also some from other local bands, among them Mogwai and Arab Strap. Chemikal Underground's first release was the Delgados first single \\"Monica Webster / Brand New Car\\". The single caught the attention of BBC Radio 1 DJ John Peel, and the band quickly became one of his favourites, going on to record seven sessions for his show. The cost of Chemikal Underground's second release, the single \\"Disco Nation 45\\" by Bis, left the cash-strapped label unable to afford another release by the Delgados, so their next release \\"Lazarwalker\\" came from the London-based Radar Records. Tempted by Radar to a five-album deal, the band declined, instead poaching their A&R; contact, Graeme Beattie, for work at Chemikal Underground. Another single, \\"Cinecentre\\" followed in early 1996 as the band juggled work at the label with several tours, and recorded their debut album. The band released two more singles, this time taken from their album Domestiques released in November 1996. The song \\"Under Canvas, Under Wraps\\" being voted number three in John Peel's Festive Fifty that year. The band released their second album in 1998. Peloton - also a cycling reference. The single \\"Pull the Wires From the Wall\\" gave the Delgados their first hit single in the UK Singles Chart, reaching number 69. The band's close relationship with Peel continued, with \\"Pull the Wires From the Wall\\" voted to number one in the Festive Fifty (it would also make the all time chart made in 2000). The Delgados' evolution continued with The Great Eastern in 2000. The record was produced by Dave Fridmann. Their next single, \\"American Trilogy\\", reached number 61 in the UK chart. The record was nominated for the Mercury Music Prize. Their fourth album, Hate, was released on Mantra rather than the band's own label. The song \\"The Light Before We Land\\" was used as the opening theme for the anime Gunslinger Girl, while the song \\"Woke From Dreaming\\" is played at the beginning of episode 7. The band returned to their own label for 2004's Universal Audio. The band announced they were splitting up in April 2005 due to the departure of Henderson who found it difficult \\"to pour so much of my energy and time into something that never quite seemed to get the attention or respect [he] felt it deserved.\\" The four will continue to run Chemikal Underground together. Songwriters Pollock and Woodward are pursuing individual projects, while Savage will continue production duties at the band's Chem19 in a new studio. Since the band's separation, the track \\"I Fought the Angels\\" from Universal Audio has been used in the fourth episode in the second season of the Golden Globe-winning medical drama Grey's Anatomy in 2006, and in the opening scene in the series premiere of BBC Three's Lip Service in 2010. A double disc containing 29 tracks, The Complete BBC Peel Sessions, was released on 12 June 2006 in Europe, and later in the year in the United States. Woodward released his debut solo album in June 2009 under the name Lord Cut- Glass. Savage also played on the album.

Harding, the 29th President of the United States of America. Many of these individuals came into Harding's personal orbit during his tenure as a state-level politician in Ohio, hence the name. During the Harding administration, several members of the Ohio Gang became involved in financial scandals. These included the Teapot Dome scandal and apparent malfeasance at the U.S. Department of Justice, some of which ended in prison terms and a suicide. Following Harding's sudden death of a heart attack in 1923, many members of the Ohio Gang were effectively removed from the corridors of power by Harding's Vice President and successor, Calvin Coolidge. Background Secretary of the Interior Albert B. Fall, chief perpetrator of the Teapot Dome bribery scandal Warren G. Harding was elected President by promising to return the nation to \\"normalcy\\", and opposing the idealism of his predecessor Woodrow Wilson. He captured 60% of Americans‚Äô votes and won by a landslide. After Harding had won the election, he appointed many of his allies and campaign contributors to powerful political positions in control of vast amounts of government money and resources. Attorney General Harry M. Daugherty and Interior Secretary Albert B. Fall were considered to have been responsible for acts of corruption and cronyism. Albert Fall was responsible for the Teapot Dome scandal. Teapot Dome was considered America‚Äôs biggest political scandal up until Watergate. The group met regularly at the infamous Little Green House on K Street. Also associated with the secret hide out was Jesse W. Smith who was said to have committed suicide because he faced scrutiny from Harding‚Äôs supporters about his activities. There is no information that proves that Harding knew of the scandals that were going on during his time in office. He may not have learned much of it until the eve of his death. Fall was mainly responsible for the Teapot Dome scandal and was eventually jailed for taking bribes. Later President Coolidge forced the resignation of Daugherty for the same crimes. =Internal opposition= Attorney General Harry M. Daugherty, one of the leaders of the so-called Ohio Gang Not every member of the Harding administration was a member of the so-called \\"Ohio Gang.\\" Among the critics of the clique was Harding's straitlaced Secretary of Commerce, Herbert Hoover, who while generally appreciative of Harding viewed the motivations and behavior of the Ohio Gang with thinly concealed disgust.Herbert Hoover, The Memoirs of Herbert Hoover: The Cabinet and the Presidency, 1920-1933. New York: Macmillan, 1952; pg. 48 In his memoirs, published in 1952, Hoover depicted Harding's Ohio cronies as a reflection of a character flaw: > [Harding] had another side which was not good. His political associates had > been men of the type of Albert B. Fall, whom he appointed Secretary of the > Interior; Daugherty, whom he appointed Attorney General; Forbes, whom he > appointed Director of the Veterans' Bureau; Thomas W. Miller, whom he > appointed Alien Property Custodian, and Jesse W. \\"Jess\\" Smith who had office > room in the Department of Justice. > He enjoyed the company of these men and his old Ohio associates in and out > of the government. Weekly White House poker parties were his greatest > relaxation. The stakes were not large, but the play lasted most of the > night.... I had lived too long on the frontiers of the world to have strong > emotions against people playing poker for money if they liked it, but it > irked me to see it in the White House. Although the religious Hoover was invited to the White House poker party only once and never invited back, he was nevertheless held in esteem by Harding, and he was abruptly added to the entourage for the President's July 1923 trip to Alaska, which came in the wake of Jess Smith's suicide.Hoover, The Memoirs of Herbert Hoover: The Cabinet and the Presidency, 1920-1933, pp. 48-49. Even as Harding prepared to leave Washington, DC, Hoover found him \\"nervous and distraught,\\" and his mood changed little on board ship to Alaska.Hoover, The Memoirs of Herbert Hoover: The Cabinet and the Presidency, 1920-1933, pg. 49. Hoover later recalled: > One day after lunch when we were a few days out, Harding asked me to come to > his cabin. He plumped at me the question: \\"If you knew of a great scandal in > our administration, would you for the good of the country and the party > expose it publicly or would you bury it?\\" My natural reply was \\"Publish it, > and at least get credit for integrity on your side.\\" He remarked that this > method might be politically dangerous. I asked for more particulars. He said > that he had received some rumors of irregularities, centering around Smith, > in connection with cases in the Department of Justice. He had followed the > matter up and finally sent for Smith. After a painful session he told Smith > that he would be arrested in the morning. Smith went home, burned all his > papers, and committed suicide. Harding gave me no information about what > Smith had been up to. I asked what Daugherty's relations to the affair were. > He abruptly dried up and never raised the question again. During his Alaskan trip Harding suffered the first heart attack in what would prove to be his last days.Hoover, The Memoirs of Herbert Hoover: The Cabinet and the Presidency, 1920-1933, pp. 50-53. Following Harding's death, Hoover and his co-thinker, Secretary of State Charles Evans Hughes, approached new President Calvin Coolidge and asked him to remove prominent Ohio Gang member Daugherty as Attorney General.Hoover, The Memoirs of Herbert Hoover: The Cabinet and the Presidency, 1920-1933, pg. 54. Harding's death had done nothing to stem the tide of emerging scandals revolving around his Ohio clique, with the news dominated by the story of Teapot Dome bribery and allegations of wrongdoing in the Office of the Alien Property Custodian, the Veterans' Bureau, and the Office of the Attorney General.Hoover, The Memoirs of Herbert Hoover: The Cabinet and the Presidency, 1920-1933, pg. 53. Hoover recalled: > Coolidge was loath to believe that such things were possible. He greatly > delayed the removal of Daugherty from the Cabinet. From this man's long-time > character, he should never have been in any government.... Coolidge had a > high sense of justice and asserted that he had no definite knowledge of > wrongdoings by Daugherty and could not remove him on rumors. We urged that > Daugherty had lost the confidence of the whole country and himself should be > willing to retire for the good of public service. Finally, on March 28, 1924 Coolidge requested and received a letter of resignation from Daugherty, effectively terminating the Ohio Gang's last leading member.Mark Grossman, \\"Harry Micajah Daugherty (1860-1941),\\" in Political Corruption in America: An Encyclopedia of Scandals, Power, and Greed. Santa Barbara, CA: ABC-CLIO, 2003; pp. 91-93. The term \\"Ohio Gang\\", while used as an epithet by some during the decade of the 1920s and subsequently, was embraced by others.

Different views of what constitutes this community may include a focus on moral standards, economic practices, political structures, and/or cultural forms. A person who adheres to the idea of cosmopolitanism in any of its forms is called a cosmopolitan or cosmopolite. In a cosmopolitan community individuals from different places (e.g. nation-states) form relationships of mutual respect. As an example, Kwame Anthony Appiah suggests the possibility of a cosmopolitan community in which individuals from varying locations (physical, economic, etc.) enter relationships of mutual respect despite their differing beliefs (religious, political, etc.). Various places are called \\"cosmopolitan\\"; this does not usually mean cosmopolitan; cosmopolitan means people of various ethnic, cultural and/or religious backgrounds live nearby and interact with each other. Etymology The word derives from the , or kosmopolit√™s, formed from \\"\\", kosmos, i.e. \\"world\\", \\"universe\\", or \\"cosmos\\", and , \\"polit√™s\\", i.e. \\"citizen\\" or \\"[one] of a city\\". Contemporary usage defines the term as \\"citizen of the world\\".. Definitions Definitions of cosmopolitanism usually begin with the Greek etymology of \\"citizen of the world\\". However, as Appiah points out, \\"world\\" in the original sense meant \\"cosmos\\" or \\"universe\\", not earth or globe as current use assumes.Kwame Anthony Appiah, Cosmopolitanism: Ethics in a World of Strangers, W.W. Norton, New York, 2006, p. xiv. One definition that handles this issue is given in a recent book on political globalization: > Cosmopolitanism can be defined as a global politics that, firstly, projects > a sociality of common political engagement among all human beings across the > globe, and, secondly, suggests that this sociality should be either > ethically or organizationally privileged over other forms of sociality. The Chinese term tianxia (all under Heaven), a metonym for empire, has also been re-interpreted in the modern age as a conception of cosmopolitanism, and was used by 1930s modernists as the title of a Shanghai-based, English- language journal of world arts and letters, T'ien Hsia Monthly. Multilingual modern Chinese writers such as Lin Yutang, Wen Yuan-ning also translated cosmopolitanism using the now more common term shijie zhuyi (ideology of world[liness]). Philosophical =Philosophical roots= Diogenes Cosmopolitanism can be traced back to Diogenes of Sinope (c. 412 B.C.), the founding father of the Cynic movement in Ancient Greece. Of Diogenes it is said: \\"Asked where he came from, he answered: 'I am a citizen of the world (kosmopolit√™s)'\\".Diogenes La√´rtius, The Lives of Eminent Philosophers, Book VI, passage 63; online text in Greek and in English at the Perseus Project. In Ancient Greece, the broadest basis of social identity at that time was either the individual city-state or the Greeks (Hellenes) as a group. The Stoics, who later took Diogenes' idea and developed it, typically stressed that each human being \\"dwells [...] in two communities ‚Äì the local community of our birth, and the community of human argument and aspiration\\".Nussbaum, Martha C. (1997). Kant and Stoic Cosmopolitanism, in The Journal of Political Philosophy Volume 5, Nr 1, pp. 1‚Äì25 A common way to understand Stoic cosmopolitanism is through Hierocles' circle model of identity that states that we should regard ourselves as concentric circles, the first one around the self, next immediate family, extended family, local group, citizens, countrymen, humanity. Within these circles human beings feel a sense of \\"affinity\\" or \\"endearment\\" towards others, which the Stoics termed Oikei√¥sis. The task of world citizens becomes then to \\"draw the circles somehow towards the centre, making all human beings more like our fellow city dwellers, and so forth\\". =Modern cosmopolitan thinkers= In his 1795 essay Perpetual Peace: A Philosophical Sketch, Immanuel Kant stages a ius cosmopoliticum (cosmopolitan law/right) as a guiding principle to help global society achieve permanent, enduring peace. Kant's cosmopolitan right stems from an understanding of all human beings as equal members of a universal community. Cosmopolitan right thus works in tandem with international political rights, and the shared, universal right of humanity. Kant's cosmopolitan right is fundamentally bound to the conditions of universal hospitality and the right of resort. Universal hospitality is defined as the right to be welcomed upon arrival in foreign territory, but is contingent on a guest arriving in a peaceful manner. Kant makes the additional claim that all human beings have the basic right of resort: the right to present oneself in a foreign land. The right of resort is derived from Kant's understanding of the Earth's surface as essentially communal, and further emphasizing his claims on equally shared universal rights among all human beings. The philosophical concepts of Emmanuel Levinas, on ethics, and Jacques Derrida, on hospitality, provide a theoretical framework for the relationships between people in their everyday lives and apart from any form of written laws or codes. For Levinas, the foundation of ethics consists in the obligation to respond to the Other. In Being for the Other, he writes that there is no \\"universal moral law,\\" only the sense of responsibility (goodness, mercy, charity) that the Other, in a state of vulnerability, calls forth. The proximity of the Other is an important part of Levinas's concept: the face of the Other is what compels the response. For Derrida, the foundation of ethics is hospitality, the readiness and the inclination to welcome the Other into one's home. Ethics, he claims, is hospitality. Pure, unconditional hospitality is a desire that underscores the conditional hospitality necessary in our relationships with others. Levinas's and Derrida's theories of ethics and hospitality hold out the possibility of an acceptance of the Other as different but of equal standing. Isolation is not a feasible alternative in the world, therefore, it is important to consider how best to approach these interactions, and to determine what is at stake for ourselves and the others: what conditions of hospitality to impose, and whether or not we have responded to the call of the Other. Further, both theories reveal the importance of considering how best to interact with the Other and others, and what is at stake. Derrida in an interview with Bennington (1997) summarized \\"cosmopolitanism\\", A further state of cosmopolitanism occurred after the Second World War. As a reaction to the Holocaust and the other massacres, the concept of crimes against humanity became a generally accepted category in international law. This clearly shows the appearance and acceptance of a notion of individual responsibility that is considered to exist toward all of humankind.Beck, Ulrich (2006). The Cosmopolitan Vision, Cambridge: Polity Press, p. 45 Philosophical cosmopolitans are moral universalists: they believe that all humans, and not merely compatriots or fellow-citizens, come under the same moral standards. The boundaries between nations, states, cultures or societies are therefore morally irrelevant. A widely cited example of a contemporary cosmopolitan is Kwame Anthony Appiah.Appiah, Kwame Anthony (2006), Cosmopolitanism. Ethics in a World of Strangers, London: Penguin Books Some philosophers and scholars argue that the objective and subjective conditions arising in today's unique historical moment, an emerging planetary phase of civilization, creates a latent potential for the emergence of a cosmopolitan identity as global citizens and possible formation of a global citizens movement.GTI Paper Series see Dawn of the Cosmopolitan: The Hope of a Global Citizens Movement, paper #15, and Global Politics and Institutions, paper #3 These emerging objective and subjective conditions in the planetary phase include improved and affordable telecommunications; space travel and the first images of our fragile planet floating in the vastness of space; the emergence of global warming and other ecological threats to our collective existence; new global institutions such as the United Nations, World Trade Organization, or International Criminal Court; the rise of transnational corporations and integration of markets often termed economic globalization; the emergence of global NGOs and transnational social movements, such as the World Social Forum; and so on. Globalization, a more common term, typically refers more narrowly to the economic and trade relations and misses the broader cultural, social, political, environmental, demographic, values and knowledge transitions taking place. =Contemporary cosmopolitan thinkers= A number of contemporary theorists propose, directly and indirectly, various ways of becoming or being a cosmopolitan individual. Thich Nhat Hanh discusses what he calls \\"Interbeing\\" as a way of living one's life in relation to others; \\"Interbeing\\" might easily be compared to cosmopolitanism. Nhat Hanh's philosophical beliefs are grounded in the precepts of Buddhist teachings, which involve compassion and understanding to protect and live in harmony with all people, animals, plants, and minerals. He further describes what he calls \\"Mindfulness Training of the Order of Interbeing\\" as being aware of sufferings created by, but not limited to, the following causes: fanaticism and intolerances that disrupt compassion and living in harmony with others; indoctrination of narrow-minded beliefs; imposition of views; anger; and miscommunication. Understanding and compassion for others seems to be achieved by the understanding of others' suffering and the root causes of suffering. Therefore, to be responsible is to recognize and understand suffering, which then leads to compassion. It is through this process that others can be recognized as people. Other theorists, philosophers, and activists contend that recognizing suffering is necessary to end violence. In Scared Sacred, Velcrow Ripper takes a journey to different sites of great suffering that ultimately leads him toward developing compassion. In \\"The Planet\\", Paul Gilroy explores how the construction and naturalization of race and the hierarchies produced by difference shape the hatred of others. It is the deconstruction of these ideologies that can lead to the compassion and humanization of others. Thus individual responsibility is being aware of what Judith Butler calls the precariousness of life in self and other; being a cosmopolitan seems to be, above all, a social, ethical enterprise. In Cosmopolitanism: Ethics in a World of Strangers, Kwame Anthony Appiah notes how social ethics seem to operate: Whatever obligation one might have to another, especially a foreign other, that obligation does not supersede the obligations one has to those people most familiar to them. However, as Judith Butler questions, \\"at what cost do I establish the familiar as the criterion\\" for valuing others? If one values the familiar more than the foreign, what are the consequences? Paul Gilroy offers a possible alternative to this emphasis on familiarity arguing that \\"methodical cultivation of a degree of estrangement from one's own culture and history ... might qualify as essential to a cosmopolitan commitment.\\" This estrangement entails a \\"process of exposure to otherness\\" in order to foster \\"the irreducible value of diversity within sameness.\\" Estrangement, therefore, could lead to de-emphasising the familiar in ethics by integrating otherness. For Gilroy, being cosmopolitan seems to involve both a social, ethical enterprise and a cultural enterprise. In \\"The Planet\\", Gilroy describes the cases of Tom Hurndall and Rachel Corrie; each seems to exemplify what might be considered Gilroy's figure of the cosmopolitan. Both Hurndall and Corrie removed themselves (geographically) from their home cultures, presumably both physically and mentally estranging themselves from their own cultures and histories. Hurndall and Corrie were both killed in 2003 (in separate incidents). Gilroy's model of estrangement might actually undermine itself through its examples; this might be construed as a failure of Gilroy's theory to address the practical difficulties of estranging oneself from the familiar. The Venus Project, an international, multidisciplinary educational organization created by Jacque Fresco, works to spread cosmopolitan ideas by transcending artificial boundaries currently separating people and emphasizing an understanding our interdependence with nature and each other. Some forms of cosmopolitanism also fail to address the potential for economic colonization by powerful countries over less powerful ones. Frantz Fanon, in The Wretched of the Earth, observes that when nations achieved independence from European colonizers, frequently there was no system in place to secure their economic future, and they became \\"manager[s] for Western enterprise...in practise set[ting] up its country as the brothel of Europe.\\" When \\"third world\\" nations are drawn into economic partnerships with global capital, ostensibly to improve their national quality of life, often the only ones benefitting from this partnership are well-placed individuals and not the nation itself. Further, Mahmood Mamdani in Good Muslim, Bad Muslim suggests that the imposition of Western cultural norms, democracy and Christianity to name only two, has historically resulted in nationalist violence; however, Appiah has implied that democracy is a pre-requisite for cosmopolitan intervention in developing nations. Cosmopolitanism, in these instances, appears to be a new form of colonization: the powerful exploit the weak and the weak eventually fight back. Much of the political thinking of the last two centuries has taken nationalism and the framework of the sovereign nation-state for granted. With the advance of globalization and the increased facility of travel and communication, some thinkers consider that the political system based on the nation-state has become obsolete and that it is time to design a better and more efficient alternative. Jes√∫s Moster√≠n analyzes how the world political system should be organized in order to maximize individual freedom and individual opportunity. Rejecting as muddled the metaphysical notion of free will, he focuses on political freedom, the absence of coercion or interference by others in personal decisions. Because of the tendencies to violence and aggression that lurk in human nature, some constraint on freedom is necessary for peaceful and fruitful social interaction. Especially, there is no rational ground for curtailing the cultural freedoms (of language, religion and customs) in the name of the nation, the church, or the party. From this point of view, the Internet provides a much more attractive model than the nation-state. Neither is there any just reason for restraining the free circulation of people, ideas, or goods. Moster√≠n thinks that the nation-state is incompatible with the full development of freedom, whose blossoming requires the reorganization of the world political system along cosmopolitan lines. He proposes a world without sovereign nation-states, territorially organized in small autonomous but not- sovereign cantonal polities, complemented by strong world organizations. He emphasizes the difference between international institutions, led by representatives of the national governments, and world or universal institutions, with clearly defined aims served by directors selected by their personal qualifications, independently of any national bias or proportion. Criticizing the abstract nature of most versions of cosmopolitanism, Charles Blattberg has argued that any viable cosmopolitanism must be \\"rooted,\\" by which he means based upon a \\"global patriotism.\\" More general philosophical reviews of cosmopolitanism and multiculturalism are also available. Carol Nicholson compares John Searle's opposition to multiculturalism with Charles Taylor's celebration of it. She uses Richard Rorty as a triangulation point in that he remains neutral about multiculturalism, but his philosophical analysis of truth and practice can be deployed to argue against Searle and in favor of Taylor. At a conference on \\"Philosophy in a Multicultural Context\\", Rasmus Winther excavated the philosophical assumptions and practices connected with cosmopolitanism and multiculturalism. He develops Bruno Latour's conception of the philosopher as public diplomat. Political and sociological Emile Durkheim (1858‚Äì1917) observed the development of what he called the 'cult of the individual', which is a new religion that replaced the Christianity that was dying out, and which is centered around the sacredness of human dignity. This new religion would provide the new foundations of Western society, and these foundations are closely related to human rights and individual nation's constitutions. A society's sacred object would be the individual's human dignity, and the moral code guiding the society is found in that country's way of interpreting human dignity and human rights. Thus, rather than finding solidarity through national culture, or a particular traditional religious doctrine, society would be unified by its adherence to political values, i.e. individual rights and a defence of human dignity.Durkheim, Emile. \\"Individualism and Individuals\\": Originally published as \\"L'individualisme et les intellectuels,\\" Revue bleue, 4e serie, 10 (1898): 7-13. Translated by Mark Traugott. Article accessed: https://www.scribd.com/document/85771137/Durkheim- Individualism-and-the-Intellectuals Durkheim's cult of the individual has many similarities to John Rawls' political liberalism, which Rawls developed almost a century after Durkheim.See Cladis, Mark. 'A Communitarian Defense of Liberalism: Emile Durkheim and Contemporary Social Theory' (Stanford University Press: Stanford, 1992). Ulrich Beck (May 15, 1944 ‚Äì January 1, 2015) was a sociologist who posed the new concept of cosmopolitan critical theory in direct opposition to traditional nation-state politics. Nation-state theory sees power relations only among different state actors, and excludes a global economy, or subjugates it to the nation-state model. Cosmopolitanism sees global capital as a possible threat to the nation state and places it within a meta-power game in which global capital, states and civil society are its players. It is important to mark a distinction between Beck's cosmopolitanism and the idea of a world state. For Beck, imposing a single world order was considered hegemonic at best and ethnocentric at worst. Rather, political and sociological cosmopolitanism rests upon these fundamental foundations: * \\"Acknowledging the otherness of those who are culturally different\\" * \\"Acknowledging the otherness of the future\\" * \\"Acknowledging the otherness of nature\\" * \\"Acknowledging the otherness of the object\\" * \\"Acknowledging the otherness of other rationalities\\" A number of philosophers, including Emmanuel Levinas, have introduced the concept of the \\"Other\\". For Levinas, the Other is given context in ethics and responsibility; we should think of the Other as anyone and everyone outside ourselves. According to Levinas, our initial interactions with the Other occur before we form a will‚Äîthe ability to make choices. The Other addresses us and we respond: even the absence of response is a response. We are thus conditioned by the Other's address and begin to form culture and identity. After the formation of the will, we choose whether to identify with the addresses by others and, as a result, continue the process of forming identity.Emmanuel Levinas. Totality and Infinity. An Essay on Exteriority. Lingis A (trans) Duquesne University Press, Pittsburgh, PA 1998. pp. 84, 100‚Äì01 During this process, it is possible to recognize ourselves in our interactions with Others. Even in situations where we engage in the most minimal interaction, we ascribe identities to others and simultaneously to ourselves. Our dependence on the Other for the continuous formation of language, culture, and identity means that we are responsible to others and that they are responsible to us. Also once we've formed a will, it becomes possible to recognize this social interdependence. When we have gained the capacity for recognition, the imperative is to perform that recognition and thereby become ethically responsible to the Other in conscience. Cosmopolitanism shares some aspects of universalism ‚Äì namely the globally acceptable notion of human dignity that must be protected and enshrined in international law. However, the theory deviates in recognising the differences between world cultures. In addition, cosmopolitanism calls for equal protection of the environment and against the negative side effects of technological development. Human dignity, however, is convoluted because it is necessary to first distinguish who has the right to be respected and second to consider what rights are protectable. Under cosmopolitanism, all humans have rights; however, history shows that recognition of these rights is not guaranteed. As an example, Judith Butler discusses a Western discourse of \\"human\\" in Precarious Life: The Powers of Mourning and Violence. Butler works through the idea of \\"human\\" and notes that \\"human\\" has been \\"naturalized in its 'Western' mold by the contemporary workings of humanism\\" (32). Thus, there is the idea that not all \\"human\\" lives will be supported in the same way, indeed, that some human lives are worth more protection than others. Others have extended this idea to examine how animals might be reconfigured as cosmopolitan, present the world-over with varying identities in different places. This idea is reiterated in Sunera Thobani's \\"Exalted Subjects: Studies in the Making of Race and Nation in Canada,\\" where she discusses a discourse in which Muslim people fall into a good/bad dichotomy: a \\"good Muslim\\" is one who has been Westernized and a \\"bad Muslim\\" is one who visibly rejects Western cultural influences. Thobani notes that it is through media representations that these ideas become naturalized. Individuals who embrace Western ideals are considered fully \\"human\\" and are more likely to be afforded dignity and protection than those who defend their non-Westernized cultural identities. According to those who follow Beck's reasoning, a cosmopolitan world would consist of a plurality of states, which would use global and regional consensus to gain greater bargaining power against opponents. States would also utilize the power of civil society actors such as Non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and consumers to strengthen their legitimacy and enlist the help of investors to pursue a cosmopolitan agenda. Other authors imagine a cosmopolitan world moving beyond today's conception of nation-states. These scholars argue that a truly cosmopolitan identity of Global Citizen will take hold, diminishing the importance of national identities. The formation of a global citizens movement would lead to the establishment of democratic global institutions, creating the space for global political discourse and decisions, would in turn reinforce the notion of citizenship at a global level. Nested structures of governance balancing the principles of irreducibility (i.e., the notion that certain problems can only be addressed at the global level, such as global warming) and subsidiarity (i.e., the notion that decisions should be made at as local a level possible) would thus form the basis for a cosmopolitan political order.GTI Paper Series see Global Politics and Institutions, paper #3 Daniele Archibugi proposes a renewed model for global citizenship:Daniele Archibugi, The Global Commonwealth of Citizens: Toward a Cosmopolitan Democracy, Princeton University Press, 2009. institutional cosmopolitanism. It advocates some reforms in global governance to allow world citizens to take more directly a part into political life. A number of proposals have been made in order to make this possible. Cosmopolitan democracy, for example, suggests strengthening the United Nations and other international organizations by creating a World Parliamentary Assembly.Daniele Archibugi, Debating Cosmopolitics, London: Verso, 2003. Criticism \\"Cosmopolitanism\\" became a rhetorical weapon used by nationalists against \\"alien\\" ideas that went counter to orthodoxy. European Jews were frequently accused of being \\"rootless cosmopolitans.\\" Joseph Stalin in a 1946 Moscow speech attacked writings in which \\"the positive Soviet hero is derided and inferior before all things foreign and cosmopolitanism that we all fought against from the time of Lenin, characteristic of the political leftovers, is many times applauded.\\"Jeff Greenfield, \\"The Ugly History of Stephen Miller‚Äôs ‚ÄòCosmopolitan‚Äô Epithet: Surprise, surprise‚Äîthe insult has its roots in Soviet anti-Semitism.\\" Politico 3 August, 2017 In the German Democratic Republic, cosmopolitanism was characterized as a bourgeois-imperialist ideology that rejects the nations' right to independence and national sovereignty. Cosmopolitanism was said to promote the dismantling of national and patriotic traditions and national culture. It was said to be advocated by the Anglo-American imperialism with an aim to establish world hegemony (World Government) operating in the interests of monopoly capitalism. Its opposite was not chauvinist bourgeois nationalism, but patriotism; love of your native place, your country. Love of the homeland was said to be one of the deepest feelings of the working people, expressed in the struggle against conquerors and oppressors.Taschenkalender der Kasernierten Volkspolizei 1954. Berlin : Verl. d. Minist. d. Innern, pp. 248-249. In the 21st century, the epithet became a weapon used by Vladimir Putin in Russia, and by nationalists in Hungary and Poland.Jeff Greenfield, \\"The Ugly History of Stephen Miller‚Äôs ‚ÄòCosmopolitan‚Äô Epithet\\" In modern times, Stephen Miller, a Trump administration senior policy advisor, has publicly criticized CNN reporter Jim Acosta as exhibiting \\"cosmopolitan bias\\" during a discussion on the government's new immigration plan.

(abbreviated 8vo, 8¬∫, or In-8) is a technical term describing the format of a book, which refers to the size of leaves produced from folding a full sheet of paper on which multiple pages of text were printed to form the individual sections (or gatherings) of a book. An octavo is a book or pamphlet made up of one or more full sheets (e.g. of A2 paper) on which 16 pages of text were printed, which were then folded three times to produce eight leaves. Each leaf of an octavo book thus represents one eighth the size of the original sheet. Other common book formats are folios and quartos. Octavo is also used as a general description of the size of books that are about tall (almost A4 paper size), and as such does not necessarily indicate the actual printing format of the books, which may even be unknown as is the case for many modern books. These terms are discussed in greater detail in book sizes. Format An octavo is a book or pamphlet made up of one or more full sheets of paper on which 16 pages of text were printed, which were then folded three times to produce eight leaves. Each leaf of an octavo book thus represents one eighth the size of the original sheet. There are many variations in how octavos were produced. For example, bibliographers call a book printed as an octavo (eight leaves per full sheet), but bound in gatherings of 4 leaves each, an \\"octavo in 4s.\\"Ronald B. McKerrow, An Introduction to Bibliography for Literary Students, Oxford 1927 and later eds., p. 28. The actual size of an octavo book depends on the size of the full sheet of paper on which it was printed. The size of such sheets varied in different localities and times. A sixteenth century octavo printed in France or Italy is about the size of a modern cheap paperback, whereas an eighteenth-century octavo printed in England is larger, about the size of a modern hardcover novel. The Gutenberg Bible was printed as a folio in about 1455, in which four pages of text were printed on each sheet of paper, which were then folded once. Several such folded conjugate pairs of leaves were inserted inside another to produce the sections or gatherings, which were then sewn together to form the final book. The oldest surviving octavo book apparently is the so-called \\"Turkish calendar\\" for 1455, presumably printed in late 1454, about the same time as the Gutenberg Bible.British Library, Incunabula Short Title Catalogue, entry for the 1454 Turkish Calendar.Margaret Bingham Stillwell, The Beginning of the World of Books, 1450-1470, Bibliographical Society of America, New York, 1972, p. 6, described as a tract of 6 leaves, but not identifying the format. Numerous other octavos survive beginning from about 1461.

Beginning in 1501, Aldus Manutius of Venice began to print classical works in small octavo format which were easily portable. These editions contained only the text of the works, without the commentary and notes, and became very popular with educated readers. As a result, Aldus became closely associated with the octavo format.Martin Lowry, The World of Aldus Manutius, Cornell University Press, 1979, pp. 137-167. Size Beginning in the mid-nineteenth century, technology permitted the manufacture of large sheets or rolls of paper on which books were printed, many text pages at a time. As a result, it may be impossible to determine the actual format (i.e., the number of leaves formed from each sheet fed into a press). The term \\"octavo\\" as applied to such books may refer simply to the size of the book. The use of the term \\"octavo\\" as applied to such books refers to books which are generally between tall, the most common size for modern hardbound books. More specific sizes are denoted by reference to certain paper sizes as follows: *Foolscap octavo (6¬æ\\" by 4¬º\\") (170 mm x 108 mm) *Crown octavo (7¬Ω\\" by 5\\") (190 mm x 126 mm) *Demy octavo (8¬æ\\" by 5‚Öù\\") (221 mm x 142 mm) *Globe octavo (? by ?) *Royal octavo (10\\" by 6¬º\\") (253 mm x 158 mm) See also *Book size *Bookbinding *Folio *Quarto *Paper size *Units of paper quantity References Book formats ","title":"Octavo"},{"id":"599192","text":"Lassa witch doctors A witch doctor was originally a type of healer who treated ailments believed to be caused by witchcraftLugira, Aloysius Muzzanganda. African Traditional Religion, p. 100 (Infobase Publishing, 2009). and is now more commonly a term used to refer to healers, particularly in regions which use traditional healing rather than contemporary medicine. Original meaning of the term In its original meaning witch doctors were not witches themselves, but rather people who had remedies to protect others against witchcraft. Witchcraft-induced conditions were their area of expertise, as described in this 1858 news report from England:The Ipswich Journal (Ipswich, England), Saturday, September 25, 1858. > Recourse was had by the girl's parents to a cunning man, named Burrell, > residing at Copford, who has long borne the name of \\"The Wizard of the > North:\\" but her case was of so peculiar a character as to baffle his skill > to dissolve the spell, Application was next made to a witch doctor named > Murrell, residing at Hadleigh, Essex, who undertook to effect a cure, giving > a bottle of medication, for which he did not forget to charge 3s. 6d., and > promising to pay a visit on Monday evening to the \\"old witch,\\" Mrs. Mole, > and put an end to her subtle arts... ... the news of the expected coming of > the witch-doctor spread far and wide, and about eight o'clock there could > not have been less than 200 people collected near the cottage of Mrs. Mole > to witness the supernatural powers of the Hadleigh wizard. In Europe The Oxford English Dictionary states that the first record of the use of this term was in 1718, in Francis Hutchinson's work An Historical Essay concerning Witchcraft, with Observations upon Matters of Fact; Tending to Clear the Texts of the Sacred Scriptures, and Confute the Vulgar Errors about that Point. Hutchinson used the phrase in a chapter defending a prisoner who was charged with witchcraft, by asserting that the \\"Witch-Doctor\\" himself was the one using sorcery: > The said Dorothy Durent, having been with a Witch-Doctor, acknowledges upon > Oath, that by his Advice she hang'd up her Child's Blanket in the Chimney, > found a Toad in it at Night, had put it into the Fire, and held it there > tho' it made a great and horrible Noise, and flash'd like Gunpower, and went > off like a Pistol, and then became invisible, and that by this the Prisoner > was scorch'd and burn'd lamentably. Charles Mackay's book, Extraordinary Popular Delusions and the Madness of Crowds, first published in 1841, attests to the practice of belief in witch doctors in England at the time. > In the north of England, the superstition lingers to an almost inconceivable > extent. Lancashire abounds with witch-doctors, a set of quacks, who pretend > to cure diseases inflicted by the devil. The practices of these worthies may > be judged of by the following case, reported in the \\"Hertford Reformer,\\" of > the 23rd of June, 1838. The witch-doctor alluded to is better known by the > name of the cunning man, and has a large practice in the counties of Lincoln > and Nottingham. According to the writer in \\"The Reformer,\\" the dupe, whose > name is not mentioned, had been for about two years afflicted with a painful > abscess and had been prescribed for without relief by more than one medical > gentleman. He was urged by some of his friends, not only in his own village > but in neighbouring ones, to consult the witch-doctor, as they were > convinced he was under some evil influence. He agreed and sent his wife to > the cunning man, who lived in New Saint Swithin's, in Lincoln. She was > informed by this ignorant impostor that her husband's disorder was an > infliction of the devil, occasioned by his next-door neighbours, who had > made use of certain charms for that purpose. From the description he gave of > the process, it appears to be the same as that employed by Dr. Fian and > Gellie Duncan, to work woe upon King James. He stated that the neighbours, > instigated by a witch, whom he pointed out, took some wax, and moulded it > before the fire into the form of her husband, as near as they could > represent him; they then pierced the image with pins on all sides ‚Äì repeated > the Lord's Prayer backwards, and offered prayers to the devil that he would > fix his stings into the person whom that figure represented, in like manner > as they pierced it with pins. To counteract the effects of this diabolical > process, the witch-doctor prescribed a certain medicine, and a charm to be > worn next to the body, on that part where the disease principally lay. The > patient was to repeat the 109th and 119th Psalms every day, or the cure > would not be effectual. The fee which he claimed for this advice was a > guinea. A healing ceremony held in Worcester, England on October 26, 2017, is a rare modern example of the practice in Europe. A sacred river blessing was conducted by a travelling witch doctor at the River Severn after rumours of a cholera risk. Vibrio cholerae non-O1/non-O139 was said to be present in the river due to migrating salmon which had consumed crustacean zooplankton carrying the bacteria. In Africa Shona traditional healer, or n'anga (Zimbabwe). In southern Africa, traditional healers are known as sangomas. The Oxford English Dictionary states that the first use of the term \\"witch doctor\\" to refer to African shamans (i.e. medicine men) was in 1836 in a book by Robert Montgomery Martin. BBC News reported, on March 12, 2015, that, \\"More than 200 witchdoctors and traditional healers have been arrested in Tanzania in a crackdown on the murder of albino people. The killings have been driven by the belief ‚Äì advanced by some witchdoctors ‚Äì that the body parts have properties that confer wealth and good luck. According to the Red Cross, witchdoctors are prepared to pay $75,000 (¬£57,000) for a complete set of albino body parts. Nearly 80 albino Tanzanians have been killed since 2000, the UN says. The latest victims include a one-year-old albino boy, killed in north-western Tanzania. The government banned witchdoctors in January as part of its efforts to prevent further attacks and kidnappings targeting people with albinism.\\"  In Nepal and Northeastern India  Statues of jhƒÅkri at Banjhakri Falls and Energy Park in Gangtok, Sikkim, India JhƒÅkri () is the Nepali word for shaman. It is sometimes reserved specifically for practitioners of Nepali shamanism, such as that practiced among the Tamang people and the Magars; it is also used in the Indian states of Sikkim and West Bengal, which border Nepal. JhƒÅkri shamanism is practiced among numerous ethnic groups of Nepal and Northeast India, including the Limbu, Rai, Sunwar, Sherpa, Kami, Tamang, Gurung, Magars, Lepcha and Khas. Belief in spirits is prevalent, hence also the fear of spirit possession. Some vernacular words for jhƒÅkri are phedangbo in the Limbu language, maangpa or nakchyong in Khambu, and boongthing in Lepcha. JhƒÅkris perform rituals during weddings, funerals, and harvests. They diagnose and cure diseases. Their practices are influenced by Hinduism, Tibetan Buddhism, Mun, and B√∂n rites. Even now the indigenous ethnic groups of Assam, Northeastern India (especially in the Mayong region as well other rural places) have shamanistic medicine man who treats diseases using sorcery as well as witchcraft and black magic for which it was once renowned for. Similar Shamans and Medicine Man are prevalent among the indigenous communities throughout the rural areas of the NE India.

New-age music is broadly defined as relaxing, even \\"meditative\\", music that is primarily instrumental.

There is some debate on what can be considered \\"new-age music\\"; for example several musicians in Celtic music or Smooth jazz have expressed annoyance at being labeled \\"new-age musicians\\". For more on that debate, see the article on new- age music. In addition, several musicians object to the label because they fear it implies a connection to the New Age movement.

given by a publisher to booksellers, librarians, journalists, celebrities, or others, or as a contest or school prize, before the book is printed for mass distribution. Overview ARCs may lack the final dust jacket, formatting, and binding of the finished product. The text of an advance edition may also differ slightly from the market book (the final version that is distributed for sale), because changes may be made after advance readers make comments or find errors in the manuscript. When a celebrity reader or journalist gives an endorsement, that may be added to the dust-cover and other promotional items. ARCs are normally distributed three to six months before the book is officially released to reviewers, bookstores, magazines, and (in some cases) libraries. Book collectors often seek ARCs, which may contain text errors or typos that add value, as coins or stamps with errors do. On rare occasions (for instance, on the publication of an eagerly awaited or controversial book), a publisher may require the recipients of an ARC to sign a confidentiality of content agreement. However, in most cases the sheer number of ARCs produced and distributed makes that impractical. A typical genre publisher will produce 5,000 ARCs for a new book by a moderately popular writer. Before it was a common practice to produce and distribute ARCs in this way, publishers used uncorrected, bound galley proofs only for the editing and proof-reading process. Typically, they were bound in plain paper covers without illustrations, printed in black and white, and significantly larger than their market book counterparts. In contrast, ARCs usually are printed in full color, and have bindings, format, and illustrations that are similar to those of the market book. The phrase 'uncorrected proof' appears on the ARC cover. Although ARCs are usually free promotional items, some early versions of books, even some labeled by the publisher as ARCs, are sold to the public. An example is Captain Vorpatril's Alliance by Lois McMaster Bujold. Digital advance copies Publishers who produce galley proofs in electronic form rather than as a physical book do not use them as ARCs. However, with the rise of ebooks and ereaders, it is now common for ARCs (in contrast to galley proofs) to be distributed as eBooks on websites such as NetGalley. Both traditionally published and self-published ARCs may be available for distribution on such sites. Recently, eARC has come into common use for advance copies of eBooks. This usage dates back to at least 2010 and was promoted by Baen Books for their trade eBooks from at least 2013 onward. References Books by type Book terminology ","title":"Advance copy"},{"id":"599203","text":"Raynaud syndrome, also known as Raynaud's phenomenon, is a medical condition in which spasm of arteries cause episodes of reduced blood flow. Typically, the fingers, and less commonly the toes, are involved. Rarely, the nose, ears, or lips are affected. The episodes result in the affected part turning white and then blue. Often, numbness or pain occurs. As blood flow returns, the area turns red and burns. The episodes typically last minutes, but can last several hours. Episodes are often triggered by cold or emotional stress. Primary Raynaud's, also known as idiopathic, means that it is spontaneous and unrelated to another disease. Secondary Raynaud's occurs as a result of another condition. Secondary Raynaud's can occur due to a connective-tissue disorder, such as scleroderma or lupus, injuries to the hands, prolonged vibration, smoking, thyroid problems, and certain medications, such as birth control pills. Diagnosis is typically based on the symptoms. The primary treatment is avoiding the cold. Other measures include the discontinuation of nicotine or stimulant use. Medications for treatment of cases that do not improve include calcium channel blockers and iloprost. Little evidence supports alternative medicine. Severe disease may rarely be complicated by skin sores or gangrene. About 4% of people have the condition. Onset of the primary form is typically between ages 15 and 30 and occurs more frequently in females. The secondary form usually affects older people. Both forms are more common in cold climates. It is named after the French physician Maurice Raynaud, who described the condition in 1862.  Signs and symptoms  Raynaud's affecting all five fingers Bluish coloration The condition can cause localized pain, discoloration (paleness), and sensations of cold and/or numbness. When exposed to cold temperatures, the blood supply to the fingers or toes, and in some cases the nose or earlobes, is markedly reduced; the skin turns pale or white (called pallor) and becomes cold and numb. These events are episodic, and when the episode subsides or the area is warmed, the blood flow returns, and the skin color first turns red (rubor), and then back to normal, often accompanied by swelling, tingling, and a painful \\"pins and needles\\" sensation. All three color changes are observed in classic Raynaud's. However, not all patients see all of the aforementioned color changes in all episodes, especially in milder cases of the condition. The red flush is due to reactive hyperemia of the areas deprived of blood flow. In pregnancy, this sign normally disappears due to increased surface blood flow. Raynaud's has occurred in breastfeeding mothers, causing nipples to turn white and painful. difficulty breastfeeding.  Causes  = Primary = Raynaud's disease, or primary Raynaud's, is diagnosed if the symptoms are idiopathic, that is, if they occur by themselves and not in association with other diseases. Some refer to primary Raynaud's disease as \\"being allergic to coldness\\". It often develops in young women in their teens and early adulthood. Primary Raynaud's is thought to be at least partly hereditary, although specific genes have not yet been identified. Smoking increases frequency and intensity of attacks, and a hormonal component exists. Caffeine, estrogen, and nonselective beta- blockers are often listed as aggravating factors, but evidence that they should be avoided is not solid. = Secondary = Raynaud's phenomenon, or secondary Raynaud's, occurs secondary to a wide variety of other conditions. Secondary Raynaud's has a number of associations: * Connective tissue disorders: ** scleroderma ** Systemic lupus erythematosus ** Rheumatoid arthritis ** Sj√∂gren's syndrome ** Dermatomyositis ** Polymyositis ** Mixed connective tissue disease ** Cold agglutinin disease ** Ehlers-Danlos syndrome * Eating disorders: ** Anorexia nervosa * Obstructive disorders: ** Atherosclerosis ** Buerger's disease ** Takayasu's arteritis ** Subclavian aneurysms ** Thoracic outlet syndrome * Drugs: ** Beta-blockers ** Cytotoxic drugs ‚Äì particularly chemotherapeutics and most especially bleomycin ** Cyclosporin ** Bromocriptine ** Ergotamine ** Sulfasalazine ** Anthrax vaccines whose primary ingredient is the Anthrax Protective Antigen ** Stimulant medications, such as those used to treat ADHD (amphetamine and methylphenidate) ** OTC pseudoephedrine medications (Chlor-Trimeton, Sudafed, others) * Occupation: ** Jobs involving vibration, particularly drilling and prolonged use of a string trimmer (weed whacker), suffer from vibration white finger ** Exposure to vinyl chloride, mercury ** Exposure to the cold (e.g., by working as a frozen food packer) * Others: ** Physical trauma to the extremities ** Lyme disease ** Hypothyroidism ** Cryoglobulinemia ** Cancer ** Chronic fatigue syndrome ** Reflex sympathetic dystrophy ** Carpal tunnel syndrome ** Magnesium deficiency ** Multiple sclerosis ** Erythromelalgia (clinically presenting as the opposite of Raynaud's, with hot and warm extremities, often co-exists in patients with Raynaud's) ** Chilblains (also clinically presenting as the opposite of Raynaud's, with hot and itchy extremities, however it affects smaller areas than erythromelalgia, for instance the tip of a toe rather than the whole foot) Raynaud's can precede these other diseases by many years, making it the first presenting symptom. This may be the case in the CREST syndrome, of which Raynaud's is a part. Patients with secondary Raynaud's can also have symptoms related to their underlying diseases. Raynaud's phenomenon is the initial symptom that presents for 70% of patients with scleroderma, a skin and joint disease. When Raynaud's phenomenon is limited to one hand or one foot, it is referred to as unilateral Raynaud's. This is an uncommon form, and it is always secondary to local or regional vascular disease. It commonly progresses within several years to affect other limbs as the vascular disease progresses. Mechanism Underlying mechanism Its pathophysiology includes hyperactivation of the sympathetic nervous system causing extreme vasoconstriction of the peripheral blood vessels, leading to tissue hypoxia.  Diagnosis  Heat signatures of a Raynaud's hand (top) and a healthy hand (bottom): Red indicates warm areas whilst green indicates cool areas. (Image taken with a thermographic camera) Consensus diagnostic criteria Distinguishing Raynaud's disease (primary Raynaud's) from phenomenon (secondary Raynaud's) is important. Looking for signs of arthritis or vasculitis, as well as a number of laboratory tests, may separate them. If suspected to be secondary to systemic sclerosis, one tool which may help aid in the prediction of systemic sclerosis is thermography. A careful medical history will seek to identify or exclude possible secondary causes. * Digital artery pressures are measured in the arteries of the fingers before and after the hands have been cooled. A decrease of at least 15 mmHg is diagnostic (positive). * Doppler ultrasound to assess blood flow * Full blood count may reveal a normocytic anaemia suggesting the anaemia of chronic disease or kidney failure. * Blood test for urea and electrolytes may reveal kidney impairment. * Thyroid function tests may reveal hypothyroidism. * Tests for rheumatoid factor, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, and autoantibody screening may reveal specific causative illnesses or an inflammatory process. Anti-centromere antibodies are common in limited systemic sclerosis (CREST syndrome). * Nail fold vasculature (capillaroscopy) can be examined under a microscope. To aid in the diagnosis of Raynaud's phenomenon, multiple sets of diagnostic criteria have been proposed. Table 1 below provides a summary of these various diagnostic criteria. Recently, International Consensus Criteria were developed for the diagnosis of primary Raynaud's phenomenon by a panel of experts in the fields of rheumatology and dermatology.  Management  Secondary Raynaud's is managed primarily by treating the underlying cause, and as primary Raynaud's, avoiding triggers, such as cold, emotional and environmental stress, vibrations and repetitive motions, and avoiding smoking (including passive smoking) and sympathomimetic drugs. =Medications= Medications can be helpful for moderate or severe disease. * Vasodilators ‚Äì calcium channel blockers, such as the dihydropyridines nifedipine or amlodipine, preferably slow-release preparations ‚Äì are often first-line treatment. They have the common side effects of headache, flushing, and ankle edema, but these are not typically of sufficient severity to require cessation of treatment. The limited evidence available shows that calcium-channel blockers are only slightly effective in reducing how often the attacks happen. Although, other studies also reveal that CCBs may be effective at decreasing severity of attacks, pain and disability associated with Raynaud's phenomenon. People whose disease is secondary to erythromelalgia often cannot use vasodilators for therapy, as they trigger 'flares' causing the extremities to become burning red due to too much blood supply. * People with severe disease prone to ulceration or large artery thrombotic events may be prescribed aspirin. * Sympatholytic agents, such as the alpha-adrenergic blocker prazosin, may provide temporary relief to secondary Raynaud's phenomenon. * Losartan can, and topical nitrates may, reduce the severity and frequency of attacks, and the phosphodiesterase inhibitors sildenafil and tadalafil may reduce their severity. * Angiotensin receptor blockers or ACE inhibitors may aid blood flow to the fingers, and some evidence shows that angiotensin receptor blockers (often losartan) reduce frequency and severity of attacks, and possibly better than nifedipine. * The prostaglandin iloprost is used to manage critical ischemia and pulmonary hypertension in Raynaud's phenomenon, and the endothelin receptor antagonist bosentan is used to manage severe pulmonary hypertension and prevent finger ulcers in scleroderma. * Statins have a protective effect on blood vessels, and SSRIs such as fluoxetine may help symptoms, but the data is weak. * PDE5 inhibitors are used off-label to treat severe ischemia and ulcers in fingers and toes for people with secondary Raynaud's phenomenon; as of 2016, their role more generally in Raynaud's was not clear. = Surgery = * In severe cases, an endoscopic thoracic sympathectomy procedure can be performed. Here, the nerves that signal the blood vessels of the fingertips to constrict are surgically cut. Microvascular surgery of the affected areas is another possible therapy, but this procedure should be considered as a last resort. * A more recent treatment for severe Raynaud's is the use of botulinum toxin. The 2009 article studied 19 patients ranging in age from 15 to 72 years with severe Raynaud's phenomenon of which 16 patients (84%) reported pain reduction at rest; 13 patients reported immediate pain relief, three more had gradual pain reduction over 1‚Äì2 months. All 13 patients with chronic finger ulcers healed within 60 days. Only 21% of the patients required repeated injections. A 2007 article describes similar improvement in a series of 11 patients. All patients had significant relief of pain. =Alternative medicine= Evidence does not support the use of alternative medicine, including acupuncture and laser therapy.  Prognosis  The prognosis of primary Raynaud syndrome is often very favorable, with no mortality and little morbidity. However, a minority develops gangrene. The prognosis of secondary Raynaud is dependent on the underlying disease, and how effective blood flow-restoring maneuvers are.

He began his career as a radio and big band singer who went on to appear in film and on Broadway. From 1965 to 1986, Griffin hosted his own talk show, The Merv Griffin Show. He also created the internationally popular game shows Jeopardy! and Wheel of Fortune through his television production companies, Merv Griffin Enterprises and Merv Griffin Entertainment. Early life Griffin was born July 6, 1925, in San Mateo, California, to Mervyn Edward Griffin, Sr., a stockbroker, and Rita Elizabeth Griffin (n√©e Robinson), a homemaker. The family was Irish American. Raised as a Catholic, Griffin started singing in his church choir as a boy, and by his teens was earning extra money as a church organist. His abilities as a pianist played a part in his early entry into show business. Merv attended St. Matthews Catholic grade school in San Mateo, California. He attended San Mateo High School, graduating in 1942, and continued to aid in financing the school. He attended San Mateo Junior College and then the University of San Francisco. He was a member of the international fraternity Tau Kappa Epsilon. During World War II, Griffin was declared 4F after failing several military physical examinations due to having a slight heart murmur.\\"Merv Griffin, Before He Was a Legend \\" August 12, 2009. During the Korean War several years later, he was examined and deemed healthy enough to serve, but by that time was above age 26 and therefore exempt from the draft. Career =Singing= Griffin started as a singer on radio at age 19, appearing on San Francisco Sketchbook, a nationally syndicated program based at KFRC. Griffin was overweight as an adolescent and a young man, which disappointed some radio fans when they saw him in person. He wrote years later in his autobiography that originally there was a deliberate effort to keep the public from finding out how he looked. Embarrassed by the weight issue, Griffin resolved to change his appearance, losing 80 pounds in four months. Freddy Martin heard him on the radio show and asked Griffin to tour with his orchestra, which he did for four years. Griffin had an uncredited role as a radio announcer in the 1953 horror/science fiction classic The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms. By 1945, Griffin had earned enough money to form his own record label, Panda Records, which produced Songs by Merv Griffin, the first U.S. album ever recorded on magnetic tape.Entertainment Legend Merv Griffin Dies At 82 , from Billboard In 1947, he had a 15-minute Monday-to-Friday singing program on KFRC in San Francisco. He became increasingly popular with nightclub audiences, and his fame soared among the general public with his 1950 hit \\"I've Got a Lovely Bunch of Coconuts\\". The song reached the number one spot on the Hit Parade and sold three million copies. At one of his nightclub performances, Griffin was discovered by Doris Day. Day arranged for a screen test at the Warner Bros. Studios for a role in By the Light of the Silvery Moon. Griffin did not get the part, but the screen test led to supporting roles in other musical films such as So This Is Love in 1953. The film caused a minor controversy when Griffin shared an open-mouthed kiss with Kathryn Grayson. The kiss was a first in Hollywood film history since the introduction of the Production Code in 1934. Griffin would go on to film more pictures (The Boy from Oklahoma and Phantom of the Rue Morgue), but soon became disillusioned with movie-making. Griffin bought his contract back from Warner Bros. and decided to devote his attention to a new medium: television. In the summer of 1954, Merv Griffin and Betty Ann Grove sang and danced for a show called \\"Summer Holiday\\" (and \\"Song Snapshots from a Summer Holiday\\"). The premise of the show was a \\"Live musical show with two singers simulating a trip to various places in the world.\\" The show name had alternating titles for the same show, different nights, but were filled with the patter of songs and feet by the two hosts. Merv and Betty were brought together by Byron Paul, producer of \\"The Jane Froman Show\\", and Irving Mansfield, the show's creator. Mansfield remembered Merv for his singing in the Grace Moore picture and for his hit song, \\"I've Got a Lovely Bunch of Coconuts.\\" The producer of the show (Byron Paul) had already considered Miss Grove for the summer replacement show, but \\"it was just a matter of finding a boy,\\" Byron said. \\"I'm quite excited. They're both young, fresh, work well together, work well independently. And I've never met two people who are easier to get along with.\\" The show ran for one summer.TV Guide September 4‚Äì10, 1954 =Game show host= From 1958 to 1962, Griffin hosted a game show produced by Mark Goodson and Bill Todman called Play Your Hunch. The show appeared on all three networks, but primarily on NBC. He also hosted a prime time game show for ABC called Keep Talking. Additionally, he substituted for a week for the vacationing Bill Cullen on The Price Is Right, and also for Bud Collyer on To Tell the Truth. In 1963, NBC offered him the opportunity to host a new game show, Word for Word, which Griffin produced. He also produced Let's Play Post Office for NBC in 1965; Reach for the Stars for NBC in 1967; and One in a Million for ABC in 1967. =Talk show host= Griffin scored a coup when Tonight Show host Jack Paar accidentally emerged onto the set of Play Your Hunch during a live broadcast, and Griffin got him to stay for a spontaneous interview. After Paar left The Tonight Show, but before Johnny Carson took over (Carson was still hosting Who Do You Trust? for ABC), Griffin was one of the many guest hosts who presided over Tonight in the interim. Griffin was considered the most successful of the guest hosts,\\"Late Night\\". Pioneers of Television, January 9, 2008. and was rewarded with his own daytime talk show on NBC in 1962. This live, 55-minute program was not successful, however, and was cancelled in 1963. Griffin (right) and sidekick Arthur Treacher in 1969 In 1965, Griffin launched a syndicated talk show for Group W (Westinghouse Broadcasting) titled The Merv Griffin Show. The show aired in a variety of time slots throughout North America; many stations ran it in the daytime, others aired it in prime-time and a few broadcast it opposite Johnny Carson's The Tonight Show. Griffin's announcer/sidekick was the veteran British character actor Arthur Treacher, who had been his mentor. After Treacher left the show in 1970, Griffin would do the announcing himself, and walk on stage with the phrase: \\"And now..., here I come!\\" According to an obituary article on August 24, 2007 in Entertainment Weekly, The Merv Griffin Show was on the air for 21 years and won eleven Emmy Awards during its run. Griffin was not shy about tackling controversial subjects, especially the Vietnam War. The guests on the Westinghouse show were an eclectic mix of entertainers, authors, politicians, and \\"personality\\" performers like Zsa Zsa Gabor. Griffin also booked controversial guests like George Carlin, Dick Gregory, Richard Pryor, Norman Mailer, and Bertrand Russell. Griffin received critical acclaim for booking such guests, but was also widely criticized for it. When philosopher and anti-war activist Bertrand Russell used Griffin's show to condemn the war in Vietnam, Griffin was criticized for letting Russell have his say. Arnold Schwarzenegger, later the 38th governor of California, made his talk show debut in the United States on Griffin's talk show in 1974 after moving from Austria. Griffin dedicated two shows to the topic of Transcendental Meditation and its founder Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, one in 1975, the other in 1977; the 1977 edition aired separate from the main series as a standalone special in some regions such as Canada. Griffin himself was an enthusiastic student of the practice. Griffin would also frequently chat with audience members. One regular audience member, Lillian Miller, would become a fixture on Griffin's program throughout its run. Griffin's best friend since the sixth grade, Robert (Bob) Murphy, was the producer of The Merv Griffin Show, and eventually became president of Merv Griffin Enterprises. =Late-night host= CBS gave Griffin a late-night show opposite Carson in 1969, a move which proved disastrous. The network was uncomfortable with the guests Griffin wanted, who often spoke out against the Vietnam War and on other taboo topics. When political activist Abbie Hoffman was Griffin's guest in April 1970, CBS blurred the video of Hoffman so viewers at home would not see his trademark American flag pattern shirt even though other guests had worn the same shirt in the past, uncensored. Griffin disliked the censorship imposed by CBS and complained. Sensing that his time at CBS was ending, and tired of the restrictions imposed by the network, Griffin secretly signed a contract with rival company Metromedia. The contract with Metromedia would give him a syndicated daytime talk show deal as soon as CBS canceled Griffin's show. Within a few months, Griffin was fired by CBS. His new show began the following Monday and ran until the mid-1980s. By 1986, Griffin was ready to retire and ended his talk show run. Thanks to profits from his highly successful game shows, Griffin had become one of the world's wealthiest entertainers. Game show creator Griffin created and produced the successful television game show Jeopardy! in 1964; in an Associated Press profile released right before the show premiered, Griffin talked about the show's origins: The show, originally titled What's the Question?, premiered on NBC on March 30, 1964, hosted by Art Fleming, and lasted for 11 years. Griffin wrote the 30-second piece of music heard during the show's Final Jeopardy! Round, and which later became the iconic melody of the theme for the syndicated version of the show hosted by Alex Trebek. In 1975, NBC canceled Jeopardy! after moving it twice on its daytime schedule, despite having an additional year on its network contract left to fulfill. Griffin produced the show's successor, Wheel of Fortune, which premiered on January 6, 1975. Wheel, with Chuck Woolery as host and Susan Stafford as the hostess, had successful ratings throughout its network run. From December 1975 to January 1976, the show expanded to an hour, in response to the successful 60-minute version of The Price Is Right on CBS. \\"Wheel\\" barely escaped cancellation in 1980, when NBC replaced three of its other game shows with a daytime talk show starring David Letterman; NBC finally cancelled it in 1989, when CBS picked it up for a year (only to return to NBC, when the daytime version was finally cancelled for good in 1991). The show became a phenomenon, when on September 19, 1983, a nighttime version hit the syndication market with Pat Sajak and Vanna White as host and hostess, respectively. Around the same time, Griffin composed the show's best-known theme song, \\"Changing Keys\\", which was used in several variants from then until 2002. As for Jeopardy!, two different revivals of the show would be produced: one on NBC that ran for five months in late 1978/early 1979 with Art Fleming returning as host, and the other airing in first-run syndication beginning on September 10, 1984, starring Alex Trebek. The syndicated versions of both Jeopardy! and Wheel remain on the air today. In 1990, Griffin had an ambitious but unsuccessful attempt at adapting the venerable board game Monopoly into a game show of the same name. His last game show was a wild game show called Ruckus, which emanated from the Resorts International Hotel & Casino in Atlantic City, which he owned at the time. Involving slapstick stunts and a somewhat truncated version of his old Reach for the Stars, the show initially aired locally in New York, with the intent of national syndication early the following year. The Amazing Johnathan left the show after 65 episodes because of a contract dispute and the show was scrapped before it was to be nationally syndicated. A national audience did get a look at it, via reruns that aired for a time on GSN. Upon his retirement, Griffin sold his production company, Merv Griffin Enterprises, to the then-Columbia Pictures Television, at the time a unit of The Coca-Cola Company, for US$250 million on May 6, 1986, the largest acquisition of an entertainment company owned by a single individual at that time. Following the sale, Forbes named him the richest Hollywood performer in history. He retained the title of creator of both his game shows. The two powerhouses spun off numerous programs, and Griffin often would sign on as a creative consultant. The spin-offs included Wheel 2000 on CBS in 1997 and the short lived Jep! on GSN in 1998, both for children; Rock & Roll Jeopardy! on VH1 in 1998 for purveyors of pop music trivia; a teen-oriented game called Click!, which introduced Ryan Seacrest as its host, and‚Äîin association with Wink Martindale‚ÄîHeadline Chasers in 1985. On May 14, 2003, Griffin was honored with the Broadcast Music, Inc. (BMI) President's Award at its annual Film and Television Awards ceremony, for having created some of America's best-known game show melodies. In 2007, Griffin's production company, Merv Griffin Entertainment, began production on a new syndicated game show Merv Griffin's Crosswords (originally titled Let's Play Crosswords and Let's Do Crosswords). The show taped in Los Angeles after initial reports that it would be produced at WMAQ-TV in Chicago. The show was produced in association with Program Partners and the William Morris Agency and began airing September 10, 2007. NBC-owned-and-operated stations in New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, San Francisco and Dallas carried the show, with many stations airing two episodes per day. The show lasted only one season, airing its last episode May 16, 2008; it has run in reruns on various channels since its cancellation. Business ventures Merv Griffin Way with the Beverly Hilton in the background Griffin ventured into real estate, purchasing the Beverly Hilton Hotel in Beverly Hills in 1987. In 1988 Griffin purchased Resorts International and two of their hotels, in Atlantic City, NJ and Paradise Island in the Bahamas from Donald Trump and other investors. Part of the deal was that Trump would buy Resorts' interest in the yet to be constructed Taj Mahal project for $273 million. Griffin subsequently sought bankruptcy court protection on December 23, 1989 for Resorts International Inc., his troubled hotel and casino operator. The background to this was on November 12, when Resorts reached a tentative agreement with certain bondholders, several bondholders petitioned the United States Bankruptcy Court in Camden, New Jersey, to put the company into involuntary bankruptcy to protect legal claims they might have against Trump, the real estate investor Griffin outbid for Resorts the prior year. As a result, this literally wiped out or greatly reduced the investments of the bondholders, so that Mr. Griffin could sue Trump and yet still retain a significant portion for himself. Besides Resorts International, the holding company for casinos in Atlantic City and the Bahamas, three company affiliates also filed for Chapter 11 protection: Griffin Resorts Inc., Resorts International Financing Inc. and Griffin Resorts Holding Inc. An active desert resident, he was a supporter of the La Quinta Arts Festival and the owner of the Merv Griffin Givenchy Resort & Spa in Palm Springs, now The Parker. He owned a ranch near La Quinta, California where he raised thoroughbred racehorses, as well as St. Clerans Manor, a boutique hotel, set in an eighteenth-century estate once owned by director John Huston, near Craughwell, in County Galway, Ireland. In the 1980s, Griffin purchased the Paradise Island Resort and Casino in the Bahamas for US$400 million from Trump, but he later sold it for just US$125 million. Griffin sold his empire to The Coca-Cola Company for $250 million in 1986, then went on a buying spree of hotels, so that his wealth in 2003 was said to be around $1.2 billion. Personal life Griffin was married to the former Julann Wright from 1958 to 1976; they remained friends after their divorce. The two had one son, Tony Griffin, born in 1959; Tony, in turn, had two children of his own. In an interview with The New York Times published on May 26, 2005, Griffin recalled a quip he frequently used when asked about his sexual orientation: \\"I tell everybody that I'm a quarter-sexual. I will do anything with anybody for a quarter.\\" He was otherwise secretive about the details of his business and personal life. In 1991, Deney Terrio, the host of the Griffin-created Dance Fever, sued Griffin, alleging sexual harassment, but the suit was dismissed. The same year, Brent Plott, a longtime employee who worked as a bodyguard, horse trainer and driver, filed a $200 million palimony lawsuit, which was also dismissed. Griffin characterized both lawsuits as extortion. Griffin's Los Angeles Times obituary repeated a 1991 statement he had made regarding Plott's lawsuit: \\"This is a shameless attempt to extort money from me. This former bodyguard and horse trainer was paid $250 a week, lived in one of two apartments underneath my former house as part of his security function, and left my payroll six or seven years ago. His charges are ridiculous and untrue.\\" On being wealthy, he said that \\"if people know you're rich, they don't talk with you when you walk down the street.\\" He kept his wealth an open secret, amassing media outlets, hotels and casinos with a net worth widely estimated at more than one billion dollars. Griffin stated he did not really know his worth because it \\"would keep me from sleeping at night\\". Former First Lady Nancy Reagan and he exchanged birthday greetings each July 6 for their shared birthday. Griffin was also an honorary pallbearer at the funeral of President Ronald Reagan in 2004, having been friends with both of the Reagans for many years. Griffin was a longtime member of the Republican Party. =Honors= In 1974, Griffin was inducted to the Hollywood Walk of Fame. In 1998, a Golden Palm Star on the Walk of Stars in Palm Springs was dedicated to him. In 2005, he accepted the degree Doctor of Laws (honoris causa) from the National University of Ireland, Galway, and in 2008, he was posthumously inducted into the Television Hall of Fame. Illness and death Griffin's grave, located at Westwood Village Memorial Park Cemetery in Westwood, Los Angeles, California Griffin's prostate cancer, treated originally in 1996, returned and he was admitted to Cedars Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, where his condition deteriorated, leading to his death on August 12, 2007, at the age of 82. Funeral services were held for Griffin on August 17, 2007, at the Church of the Good Shepherd in Beverly Hills. The well-attended service included Nancy Reagan; Arnold Schwarzenegger, who gave the eulogy along with Tony Griffin, Maria Shriver, and various actors, television stars, employees, and friends, including Pat Sajak, Vanna White, Alex Trebek, Dick Van Dyke, Jack Klugman, Dick Van Patten, Ellen DeGeneres, Portia de Rossi, Ryan Seacrest, Johnny Mathis, Catherine Oxenberg and Casper Van Dien. Pallbearers included Griffin Group vice-chairman Ron Ward, President Robert Pritchard, and Vice President Michael Eyre, as well as Tony Griffin. His 7-year-old grandson Donovan Mervyn was an honorary pallbearer as was Nancy Reagan. His 12-year-old granddaughter Farah gave a reading. A post-burial reception was held at the Beverly Hilton, a property owned by Griffin from 1987 to 2003. He was buried in Westwood Village Memorial Park Cemetery and his headstone epitaph (even though in his book Merv, written with David Bender in 2003, states it would be \\"Stay Tuned\\") reads \\"I will _not_ be right back after this message\\", an epitaph Griffin announced on The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson. GSN honored Griffin by airing ten-episode marathons of Wheel and Jeopardy! during the weekend of August 18‚Äì19, 2007. The Wheel marathon included two episodes with cameo appearances by Griffin: Sajak's departure from the daytime version in 1989 and a 1992‚Äì93 episode that ended with Griffin, his band \\"The MervTones,\\" and White singing at a dinner club in Orlando, Florida. The Jeopardy! marathon consisted of a rerun of the Jeopardy! Million Dollar Masters Tournament from 2002. His estate was sold for $7 million.

SOLARIS synchrotron in Poland (electromagnets in storage ring) A synchrotron is a particular type of cyclic particle accelerator, descended from the cyclotron, in which the accelerating particle beam travels around a fixed closed-loop path. The magnetic field which bends the particle beam into its closed path increases with time during the accelerating process, being synchronized to the increasing kinetic energy of the particles (see image). The synchrotron is one of the first accelerator concepts to enable the construction of large-scale facilities, since bending, beam focusing and acceleration can be separated into different components. The most powerful modern particle accelerators use versions of the synchrotron design. The largest synchrotron-type accelerator, also the largest particle accelerator in the world, is the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) near Geneva, Switzerland, built in 2008 by the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN). It can accelerate beams of protons to an energy of 6.5 teraelectronvolts (TeV). The synchrotron principle was invented by Vladimir Veksler in 1944. Edwin McMillan constructed the first electron synchrotron in 1945, arriving at the idea independently, having missed Veksler's publication (which was only available in a Soviet journal, although in English). The first proton synchrotron was designed by Sir Marcus Oliphant and built in 1952.  Types  Several specialized types of synchrotron machines are used today: *A storage ring is a special type of synchrotron in which the kinetic energy of the particles is kept constant. *A synchrotron light source is a combination of different electron accelerator types, including a storage ring in which the desired electromagnetic radiation is generated. This radiation is then used in experimental stations located on different beamlines. In addition to the storage ring, a synchrotron light source usually contains a linear accelerator (linac) and another synchrotron which is sometimes called a booster in this context. The linac and the booster are used to successively accelerate the electrons to their final energy before they are magnetically \\"kicked\\" into the storage ring. Synchrotron light sources in their entirety are sometimes called \\"synchrotrons,\\" although this is technically incorrect. *A cyclic collider is also a combination of different accelerator types, including two intersecting storage rings and the respective pre-accelerators.  Principle of operation  The synchrotron evolved from the cyclotron, the first cyclic particle accelerator. While a classical cyclotron uses both a constant guiding magnetic field and a constant-frequency electromagnetic field (and is working in classical approximation), its successor, the isochronous cyclotron, works by local variations of the guiding magnetic field, adapting the increasing relativistic mass of particles during acceleration. A drawing of the Cosmotron In a synchrotron, this adaptation is done by variation of the magnetic field strength in time, rather than in space. For particles that are not close to the speed of light, the frequency of the applied electromagnetic field may also change to follow their non-constant circulation time. By increasing these parameters accordingly as the particles gain energy, their circulation path can be held constant as they are accelerated. This allows the vacuum chamber for the particles to be a large thin torus, rather than a disk as in previous, compact accelerator designs. Also, the thin profile of the vacuum chamber allowed for a more efficient use of magnetic fields than in a cyclotron, enabling the cost-effective construction of larger synchrotrons. While the first synchrotrons and storage rings like the Cosmotron and ADA strictly used the toroid shape, the strong focusing principle independently discovered by Ernest Courant et al. and Nicholas Christofilos allowed the complete separation of the accelerator into components with specialized functions along the particle path, shaping the path into a round-cornered polygon. Some important components are given by radio frequency cavities for direct acceleration, dipole magnets (bending magnets) for deflection of particles (to close the path), and quadrupole / sextupole magnets for beam focusing. The interior of the Australian Synchrotron facility, a synchrotron light source. Dominating the image is the storage ring, showing a beamline at front right. The storage ring's interior includes a synchrotron and a linac. The combination of time-dependent guiding magnetic fields and the strong focusing principle enabled the design and operation of modern large-scale accelerator facilities like colliders and synchrotron light sources. The straight sections along the closed path in such facilities are not only required for radio frequency cavities, but also for particle detectors (in colliders) and photon generation devices such as wigglers and undulators (in third generation synchrotron light sources). The maximum energy that a cyclic accelerator can impart is typically limited by the maximum strength of the magnetic fields and the minimum radius (maximum curvature) of the particle path. Thus one method for increasing the energy limit is to use superconducting magnets, these not being limited by magnetic saturation. Electron/positron accelerators may also be limited by the emission of synchrotron radiation, resulting in a partial loss of the particle beam's kinetic energy. The limiting beam energy is reached when the energy lost to the lateral acceleration required to maintain the beam path in a circle equals the energy added each cycle. More powerful accelerators are built by using large radius paths and by using more numerous and more powerful microwave cavities. Lighter particles (such as electrons) lose a larger fraction of their energy when deflected. Practically speaking, the energy of electron/positron accelerators is limited by this radiation loss, while this does not play a significant role in the dynamics of proton or ion accelerators. The energy of such accelerators is limited strictly by the strength of magnets and by the cost. = Injection procedure = Unlike in a cyclotron, synchrotrons are unable to accelerate particles from zero kinetic energy; one of the obvious reasons for this is that its closed particle path would be cut by a device that emits particles. Thus, schemes were developed to inject pre-accelerated particle beams into a synchrotron. The pre-acceleration can be realized by a chain of other accelerator structures like a linac, a microtron or another synchrotron; all of these in turn need to be fed by a particle source comprising a simple high voltage power supply, typically a Cockcroft-Walton generator. Starting from an appropriate initial value determined by the injection energy, the field strength of the dipole magnets is then increased. If the high energy particles are emitted at the end of the acceleration procedure, e.g. to a target or to another accelerator, the field strength is again decreased to injection level, starting a new injection cycle. Depending on the method of magnet control used, the time interval for one cycle can vary substantially between different installations.  In large- scale facilities  Soleil near Paris) One of the early large synchrotrons, now retired, is the Bevatron, constructed in 1950 at the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory. The name of this proton accelerator comes from its power, in the range of 6.3 GeV (then called BeV for billion electron volts; the name predates the adoption of the SI prefix giga-). A number of transuranium elements, unseen in the natural world, were first created with this machine. This site is also the location of one of the first large bubble chambers used to examine the results of the atomic collisions produced here. Another early large synchrotron is the Cosmotron built at Brookhaven National Laboratory which reached 3.3 GeV in 1953.The Cosmotron Among the few synchrotrons around the world, 16 are located in the United States. Many of them belong to national laboratories; few are located in universities. = As part of colliders = Until August 2008, the highest energy collider in the world was the Tevatron, at the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory, in the United States. It accelerated protons and antiprotons to slightly less than 1 TeV of kinetic energy and collided them together. The Large Hadron Collider (LHC), which has been built at the European Laboratory for High Energy Physics (CERN), has roughly seven times this energy (so proton-proton collisions occur at roughly 14 TeV). It is housed in the 27 km tunnel which formerly housed the Large Electron Positron (LEP) collider, so it will maintain the claim as the largest scientific device ever built. The LHC will also accelerate heavy ions (such as lead) up to an energy of 1.15 PeV. The largest device of this type seriously proposed was the Superconducting Super Collider (SSC), which was to be built in the United States. This design, like others, used superconducting magnets which allow more intense magnetic fields to be created without the limitations of core saturation. While construction was begun, the project was cancelled in 1994, citing excessive budget overruns -- this was due to na√Øve cost estimation and economic management issues rather than any basic engineering flaws. It can also be argued that the end of the Cold War resulted in a change of scientific funding priorities that contributed to its ultimate cancellation. However, the tunnel built for its placement still remains, although empty. While there is still potential for yet more powerful proton and heavy particle cyclic accelerators, it appears that the next step up in electron beam energy must avoid losses due to synchrotron radiation. This will require a return to the linear accelerator, but with devices significantly longer than those currently in use. There is at present a major effort to design and build the International Linear Collider (ILC), which will consist of two opposing linear accelerators, one for electrons and one for positrons. These will collide at a total center of mass energy of 0.5 TeV. = As part of synchrotron light sources = Synchrotron radiation also has a wide range of applications (see synchrotron light) and many 2nd and 3rd generation synchrotrons have been built especially to harness it. The largest of those 3rd generation synchrotron light sources are the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF) in Grenoble, France, the Advanced Photon Source (APS) near Chicago, USA, and SPring-8 in Japan, accelerating electrons up to 6, 7 and 8 GeV, respectively. Synchrotrons which are useful for cutting edge research are large machines, costing tens or hundreds of millions of dollars to construct, and each beamline (there may be 20 to 50 at a large synchrotron) costs another two or three million dollars on average. These installations are mostly built by the science funding agencies of governments of developed countries, or by collaborations between several countries in a region, and operated as infrastructure facilities available to scientists from universities and research organisations throughout the country, region, or world. More compact models, however, have been developed, such as the Compact Light Source.  Research  Synchrotrons are unique devices because they produce extraordinary synchrotron light (synchrotron radiation). The unique properties of this type of light include its enormous intensity; it is millions of times brighter than the light that comes to Earth from the Sun. In addition, synchrotron radiation contains electromagnetic waves from the infrared spectrum, through visible and ultraviolet light up to the X-rays. Thanks to this, scientists can study various materials in many ways, both externally and internally. In this way, they learn how these materials are built, and what their chemical composition and electrical or magnetic properties are. Many types of measurements are possible only when synchrotron light is used. This light also allows scientists to get better quality information in less time than by using traditional light sources. Because synchrotrons offer such vast opportunities, they are used in many branches of science such as biology, chemistry, physics, material engineering, nanotechnology, medicine, pharmacology, geology, and crystallography. Synchrotrons are extremely efficient; they work 24 hours a day, seven days a week, providing radiation for scientists conducting measurements simultaneously at many experimental end-stations. They are real research factories.https://synchrotron.uj.edu.pl/en_GB/dla-gosci-i-mediow/solaris-w- pigulce Applications * Life sciences: protein and large-molecule crystallography * LIGA based microfabrication * Drug discovery and research * X-ray lithography * Analysing chemicals to determine their composition * Observing the reaction of living cells to drugs * Inorganic material crystallography and microanalysis * Fluorescence studies * Semiconductor material analysis and structural studies * Geological material analysis * Medical imaging * Particle therapy to treat some forms of cancer * Radiometry: calibration of detectors and radiometric standards See also * List of synchrotron radiation facilities * Synchrotron light * Computed X-ray tomography * Energy amplifier * Superconducting radio frequency * Coherent diffraction imaging References External links *ESRF (European Synchrotron Radiation Facility) *National Synchrotron Radiation Research Center (NSRRC) in Taiwan *Elettra Sincrotrone Trieste - Elettra and Fermi lightsources *Canadian Light Source *Australian Synchrotron *French synchrotron Soleil *Diamond UK Synchrotron *Lightsources.org *IAEA database of electron synchrotron and storage rings *CERN Large Hadron Collider *Synchrotron Light Sources of the World *A Miniature Synchrotron: room-size synchrotron offers scientists a new way to perform high-quality x-ray experiments in their own labs, Technology Review, February 4, 2008 *Brazilian Synchrotron Light Laboratory *Podcast interview with a scientist at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility *Indian SRS * Sameen Ahmed Khan, Synchrotron Radiation (in Asia), ATIP Report, No. ATIP02.034, 28 pages (21 August 2002).

It is used by listeners for yoga, massage, meditation, reading as a method of stress management to bring about a state of ecstasy rather than trance, or to create a peaceful atmosphere in their home or other environments, and is associated with environmentalism and New Age spirituality. New-age music includes both acoustic forms, featuring instruments such as flutes, piano, acoustic guitar and a wide variety of non- Western acoustic instruments, and electronic forms, frequently relying on sustained synth pads or long sequencer-based runs. Vocal arrangements were initially rare in the genre, but as it has evolved vocals have become more common, especially those featuring Native American-, Sanskrit-, or Tibetan- influenced chants, or lyrics based on mythology such as Celtic legends. There is no exact definition of new-age music. An article in Billboard magazine in 1987 commented that \\"New Age music may be the most startling successful non- defined music ever to hit the public consciousness\\". Many consider it to be an umbrella term for marketing rather than a musical category, and to be part of a complex cultural trend. New-age music was influenced by a wide range of artists from a variety of genres. Tony Scott's Music for Zen Meditation (1964) is considered to be the first new-age recording. Paul Horn (beginning with 1968's Inside) was one of the important predecessors. Irv Teibel's Environments series (1969‚Äì79) featured natural soundscapes, tintinnabulation, and \\"Om\\" chants and were some of the first publicly available psychoacoustic recordings. Steven Halpern's 1975 Spectrum Suite was a key work that began the new-age music movement.Wright, Carol. Spectrum Suite‚ÄîSteven Halpern. AllMusic. Definitions New-age music is defined more by the use and effect or feeling it produces rather than the instruments and genre used in its creation; it may be acoustic, electronic, or a mixture of both. New-age artists range from solo or ensemble performances using classical-music instruments ranging from the piano, acoustic guitar, flute or harp to electronic musical instruments, or from Eastern instruments such as the sitar, tabla, and tamboura. There is also a significant overlap of sectors of new-age music with ambient music, classical music, jazz, electronica, world music, chillout, space music, pop music and others. The two definitions typically associated with the new-age genre are: * New-age music with an ambient sound that has the explicit purpose of aiding meditation and relaxation, or aiding and enabling various alternative spiritual practices, such as alternative healing, yoga practice, guided meditation, chakra auditing, and so on. The proponents of this definition are almost always musicians who create their music expressly for these purposes.Steven Halpern, New Age Voice Magazine, June 1999 issue To be useful for meditation music needs to have repetitive dynamic and texture, without sudden loud chords and improvisation which could disturb the meditator. It is minimalist in conception, and thus are mostly instrumentalist rather than vocalist musicians. Subliminal messages are also used in new-age music, and the use of music instruments along with the natural sounds of the animals (like whales, wolves and eagles) and nature (waterfalls, ocean waves, rain) is also popular. Flautist Dean Evenson was one of the first musicians to combine peaceful music with the sounds of nature launching a genre that became popular for massage and yoga. Other prominent artists who create new-age music expressly for healing or meditation include Irv Teibel, Paul Horn, Deuter, Steven Halpern, Paul Winter, Lawrence Ball, Karunesh, Krishna Das, Deva Premal, Bhagavan Das, Snatam Kaur and so on. * Music which is found in the new-age sections of record stores. This is largely a definition of practicality, given the breadth of music that is classified as \\"new age\\" by retailers who are often less interested in finely grained distinctions between musical styles than are fans of those styles. Music which falls into this definition is usually music which cannot be easily classified into other, more common definitions, but can contain almost any kind of music‚Äîit is more a marketing slogan rather than musical category. =Debate and criticism= Kitaro, a prominent New Age music artist from Japan Stephen Hill, founder of the Hearts of Space in 1973, considers that \\"many of the artists are very sincerely and fully committed to New Age ideas and ways of life\\". Some composers like Kitar≈ç consider their music to be part of their spiritual growth, as well expressing values and shaping the culture. Douglas Groothuis stated that rejection of all music labeled as \\"new age\\" would be to fall prey to a taboo and quarantine mentality, as most of the music belongs to the \\"progressive\\" side of new-age music, where composers necessarily do not have a New Age worldview. However, it is often noted that \\"New-age music\\" is a mere popular designation which successfully sells records. J. Gordon Melton argued it does not refer to a specific genre of music, but to music which is used in therapeutic or other new-age purposes. Kay Gardner considered that the label \\"New Age\\" is considered an inauthentic commercial intention of the so-called new-age music. She commented that \\"a lot of New Age music is schlock\\" and how due to records sales everyone with a home studio put in some sounds of crickets, oceans, or rivers, as a guarantee of sales. What started as ambient mood music related with New Age activity, became a term for a musical conglomeration of jazz, folk, rock, ethnic, classical, and electronic, among other music styles, with the former and markedly different musical and theoretical movement. Thus under the umbrella term, some consider that the Mike Oldfield's progressive rock album Tubular Bells (1973) became one of the first albums to be referred to under the genre description of New Age. Others consider that music by the Greek composer Vangelis, and general modern jazz- rock fusion, exemplify the progressive side of new-age music. Other artists included are Jean-Michel Jarre (even though his electronic excursions predate the term), Andreas Vollenweider, George Winston, Mark Isham, Michael Hedges, Shadowfax, Mannheim Steamroller, Kitar≈ç, Yanni, Enya, Clannad, Enigma among others. However, many musicians and composers dismiss the labeling of their music as \\"New age\\". When the Grammy Award for Best New Age Album was first created in 1987, its first winner, Andreas Vollenweider, said \\"I don't have any intention to label my music... It's ridiculous to give a name to anything that is timeless\\". Peter Bryant, music director of WHYY-FM (90.9) and host of a New-age program, noted that \\"I don't care for the term... New-age has a negative connotation... In the circles I come in contact with, people working in music, 'new-age' is almost an insult\\", that it refers to \\"very vapid, dreamy kinds of dull music... with no substance or form or interest\\", and that the term has \\"stuck\\". Harold Budd commented how \\"When I hear the term 'new-age I reach for my revolver... I don't think of myself as making music that is only supposed to be in the background. It's embarrassing to inadvertently be associated with something that you know in your guts is vacuous\\". Vangelis considers it a style which \\"gave the opportunity for untalented people to make very boring music\\". Yanni stated that \\"I don't want to relax the audience; I want to engage them in the music, get them interested\\", and that \\"New age implies a more subdued, more relaxed music than what I do. My music can be very rhythmic, very energetic, even very ethnic\\". David Van Tieghem, George Winston and Kitar≈ç also rejected the label of new-age artist. David Lanz argued that he had \\"finally figured out that the main reason people don't like the term New Age is because it's the only musical category that isn't a musical term\\". Andreas Vollenweider noted that \\"we have sold millions of records worldwide before the category New Age was actually a category\\", and shared the concern that \\"the stores are having this problem with categorization\\". Ron Goldstein, president of Private Music, agreed with such a standpoint, and explained that \\"Windham Hill was the hub of this whole thing. Because of that association, New-age has come to be perceived as this West Coast thing\\". However, the label managing director Sam Sutherland, argued that even founders of Windham Hill, William Ackerman and Anne Robinson, \\"shied away from using any idiomatic or generic term at all. It's always seemed a little synthetic\\", and as a company they stopped making any kind of deliberate protests to the use of the term simply because it was inappropriate. Both Goldstein and Sutherland concluded that the tag has helped move merchandise, and that new-age music will be absorbed into the general body of pop music within a few years from 1987. The New York Times music critic Jon Pareles noted that \\"new-age music\\" absorbed other music styles in more softer form, but those same well defined styles don't need the new-age category, and that \\"new-age music\\" resembles other music because it is aimed as a marketing niche‚Äîto be a \\"formula show\\" designated for urban \\"ultra-consumers\\" as status accessory, that the Andean, Asian and African traditional music influences invoke the sense of \\"cosmopolitanism\\", while nature in the album artwork and sound the \\"connection to unspoiled landscapes\\". =Alternative terms= As described in this article, the borders of this umbrella genre are not well defined; however music retail stores will include artists in the \\"new-age\\" category even if the artists belong to different genre, and themselves use different names for their style of music. Here are some other terms used instead of \\"new-age\\": Kay Gardner called the original new-age music \\"healing music\\" or \\"women's spirituality\\". Paul Winter, who is considered a new-age music pioneer, also dismissed the term, and preferred \\"earth music\\". The term \\"instrumental music\\" or \\"contemporary instrumental\\" can include artists that do not use electronic instruments in their music, such as solo pianist David Lanz. Similarly, pianists such as Yanni and Bradley Joseph both use this term as well, although they use keyboards to incorporate layered orchestral textures into their compositions. Yanni has distinguished the music genre from the spiritual movement bearing the same name.Puckett, Jeffrey Lee, \\"Yanni up close: Musician known for larger-than-life venues also loves the Louisville Palace\\", The Courier-Journal, April 26, 2012. The term \\"contemporary instrumental music\\" was also suggested by Andreas Vollenweider, while \\"adult alternative\\" by Gary L. Chappell, which was the term by which Billboard called the new-age and world-music album charts. History The concept arose with the involvement of professional musicians in the New-Age movement. Initially, it was of no interest to the musical industry, so the musicians and related staff founded their own small independent recording businesses. Sales reached significant numbers in unusual outlets such as bookstores, gift stores, health-food stores and boutiques, as well as by direct mail. With the demand of a large market, the major recording companies began promoting new-age music in the 1980s. New-age music was influenced by a wide range of artists from a variety of genres‚Äîfor example, folk-instrumentalists John Fahey and Leo Kottke, minimalists Terry Riley, Steve Reich, La Monte Young, and Philip Glass, classical avant-garde Daniel Kobialka, synthesizer performers Brian Eno, and jazz artists Keith Jarrett, Weather Report, Mahavishnu Orchestra, Paul Horn (beginning with 1968's Inside), Paul Winter (beginning in the mid-1960s with the Paul Winter Consort) and Pat Metheny.Birosik, Patti Jean (1989). The New Age Music Guide. Collier Books. .Werkhoven, Henk N. (1997). The International Guide to New Age Music. Billboard Books / Crown Publishing Group. . Tony Scott's Music for Zen Meditation (1964) is considered to be the first new-age recording., but initially it was popular mostly in California, and was not sold nationally until the 1980s. Another school of meditation music arose among the followers of Rajneesh; Deuter recorded D (1971) and Aum (1972), which mixed acoustic and electronic instruments with sounds of the sea. Kay Gardner's song Lunamuse (1974) and first recording Mooncircles (1975), which were a synthesis of music, sexuality and Wiccan spirituality, were \\"new-age music before it got to be new-age music\\". Her A Rainbow Path (1984) embraced Halpern's theory of healing music from that time with women's spirituality, and she became one of the most popular new-age sacred-music artists. Paul Winter's Missa Gaia/Earth Mass (1982) is described as \\"a masterpiece of New Age ecological consciousness that celebrates the sacredness of land, sky, and sea\\". His work on the East Coast is considered to be one of the most important musical expressions of new-age spirituality. On the West Coast, musicians concentrated more on music for healing and meditation. The most notable early work was Steven Halpern's Spectrum Suite (1975), the musical purpose of which was described as to \\"resonate specific areas of the body... it quiets the mind and body\\", and whose title relates \\"to the seven tones of the musical scale and the seven colors of the rainbow to the seven etheric energy sources (chakras) in our bodies\\". In the 1970s his music work, and the theoretical book Tuning the Human Instrument (1979), pioneered the contemporary practice of musical healing in the United States. In 1976 the record label Windham Hill Records was founded, with an initial $300 investment, and would gross over $26 million annually ten years later. Over the years many record labels were formed that embraced or rejected the new-age designation, such as Narada Productions, Private Music, Music West, Lifestyle, Audion, Sonic Atmospheres, Living Music, Terra (Vanguard Records), Novus Records (which mainly recorded jazz music), FM (CBS Masterworks) and Cinema (Capitol Records). Between the intentional extremes of the West and East Coast are some of the most successful new-age artists, like George Winston and R. Carlos Nakai. Winston's million-selling December (1982), released by Windham Hill Records, was highly popular. Most of Nakai's work, with first release Changes in 1983, consists of improvised songs in native North American style. During the 1990s, his music became virtual anthems for new-age spirituality. In 1981, Tower Records in Mountain View, California added a \\"new age\\" bin. By 1985, independent and chain record retail stores were adding sections for new age, and major labels began showing interest in the genre, both through acquisition of some existing new-age labels such as Paul Winter's Living Music and through signing of so-called \\"new-age\\" artists such as Japanese electronic composer Kitar≈ç and American crossover jazz musician Pat Metheny, both signed by Geffen Records. Most of the major record labels accepted new age artists by the beginning of the next year. In the late 1980s the umbrella genre was the fastest-growing genre with significant radio broadcast. It was seen as an attractive business due to low recording costs. From 1982 to 1989, working on his own and with Lura Jane Geiger, Adam Geiger, New Age Composer/Keyboardist, produced and sold a series of cassette tapes of New Age music on the LuraMedia recording label. Stephen Hill founded the new-age radio show Hearts of Space in 1973. In 1983, was picked up by NPR for syndication to 230 affiliates nationally, and year later was started a record label Hearts of Space Records. On Valentine's Day in 1987, the former Los Angeles rock radio station KMET changed to a full-time new-age music format with new call letters KTWV, branded as The Wave. During The Wave's new-age period, management told the station employees to refer to The Wave as a \\"mood service\\" rather than a \\"radio station\\". DJs stopped announcing the titles of the songs, and instead, to maintain an uninterrupted mood, listeners could call a 1‚Äì800 phone number to find out what song was playing. News breaks were also re-branded and referred to as \\"wave breaks\\". Other new-age-specialty radio programs included Forest's Musical Starstreams and John Diliberto's Echoes. Most major cable television networks have channels that play music without visuals, including channels for New age, such as the \\"Soundscapes\\" channel on Music Choice. The two satellite radio companies Sirius Satellite Radio & XM Satellite Radio each had their own channels that played new-age music. Sirius‚ÄîSpa (Sirius XM) (73), XM‚ÄîAudio Visions (77). When the two merged in November 2008 and became SiriusXM, the Spa name was retained for the music channel with the majority of Audio Vision‚Äôs music library being used. In 1987 was formed the Grammy Award for Best New Age Album, while in 1988 the Billboard's New Age weekly charts. In 1989 Suzanne Doucet produced and held the first international New-Age Music Conference in Los Angeles. By 1989, there were over 150 small independent record labels releasing new-age music, while new-age and adult-alternative programs were carried on hundreds of commercial and college radio stations in the U.S., and over 40 distributors were selling new-age music through mail- order catalogs. In the 1990s many small labels of new-age style music emerged in Japan, but for this kind of instrumental music the terms \\"relaxing\\" or \\"healing\\" music were more popular. Enigma's Sadeness (Part I) became an international hit, reaching number one in 24 countries including UK, also number five on the US Billboard Hot 100, selling over 5 million worldwide. At the time Holland was the home of two leading European new-age labels‚ÄîOreade and Narada Media. Oreade reported that in 1997 the latest trend was \\"angelic\\" music, while from Narada Media predicted that the genre will develop in the direction of world music (with Celtic, Irish and African influences). In 1995 some \\"new-age\\" composers like Kitar≈ç, Suzanne Ciani and Patrick O'Hearn moved from major to independent record labels due to lack of promotion, diminishing sales or limited freedom of creativity. In 2001 Windham Hill celebrated its 25th anniversary, Narada and Higher Octave Music continued to move into world and ethno-techno music, and Hearts of Space Records were bought by Valley Entertainment. Enya's \\"Only Time\\" peaked at #10 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart, while the album A Day Without Rain at #2 on the Billboard 200, being the number one new-age artist of the year. Today, new-age music flourishes on streaming sites like Spotify and Tidal.

In this picture the recto page shown is of the following page in a book and hence comes next to the verso of the previous page. Recto is the \\"right\\" or \\"front\\" side and verso is the \\"left\\" or \\"back\\" side when text is written or printed on a leaf of paper () in a bound item such as a codex, book, broadsheet, or pamphlet. Etymology The terms are shortened from Latin: and ' (which translate as \\"on the right side of the leaf\\" and \\"on the back side of the leaf\\"). The two opposite pages themselves are called ' and ' in Latin, e.g. Quibus carminibus finitur totum primum folium versum (rectum vacat) voluminis \\"These poems finish the full back page (the front is blank) of the first leaf of the volume\\" [Giovanni Battista Audiffredi], Catalogus historico- criticus Romanarum editionum saeculi XV (1783), p. 225. and the ablative ', ' already imply that the text on the page (and not the physical page itself) are referred to. Usage In codicology, each physical sheet (', abbreviated fol. or f.) of a manuscript is numbered and the sides are referred to as ' and ', abbreviated as r and v respectively. Editions of manuscripts will thus mark the position of text in the original manuscript in the form fol. 1r, sometimes with the r and v in superscript, as in 1r, or with a superscript o indicating the ablative ', ', as in 1ro. e.g. Roberts, Longinus on the Sublime: The Greek Text Edited After the Paris Manuscript (2011), 170; Wijngaards, The Ordained Women Deacons of the Church's First Millennium (2012), 232; etc. Tylus, Manuscrits fran√ßais de la collection berlinoise disponibles √† la Biblioth√®que Jagellonne de Cracovie (XVIe-XIXe si√®cles) (2010) This terminology has been standard since the beginnings of modern codicology in the 17th century. Lyons (2011) argues that the term ' \\"right, correct, proper\\" for the front side of the leaf derives from the use of papyrus in Late Antiquity, as a different grain ran across each side, and only one side was suitable to be written on, so that usually papyrus would carry writing only on the \\"correct\\", smooth side (and just in exceptional cases would there be writing on the reverse side of the leaf).Martyn Lyons (2011). Books A Living History. Getty Publications. p. 21. . The terms \\"recto\\" and \\"verso\\" are also used in the codicology of manuscripts written in right-to-left scripts, like Syriac, Arabic and Hebrew. However, as these scripts are written in the other direction to the scripts witnessed in European codices, the recto page is to the left while the verso is to the right. The reading order of each folio remains first verso, then recto regardless of writing direction. The terms are carried over into printing; 'Recto verso is an expression in French that means \\"two sides of a sheet or page\\". In Flanders the term recto verso is also used to indicate two- sided printing. Duplex printers are referred to as recto verso printers. is the norm for printed books but was an important advantage of the printing press over the much older Asian woodblock printing method, which printed by rubbing from behind the page being printed, and so could only print on one side of a piece of paper. The distinction between recto and verso can be convenient in the annotation of scholarly books, particularly in bilingual edition translations. The \\"recto\\" and \\"verso\\" terms can also be employed for the front and back of a one-sheet artwork, particularly in drawing. A drawing is a sheet with drawings on both sides, for example in a sketchbook‚Äîalthough usually in these cases there is no obvious primary side. Some works are planned to exploit being on two sides of the same piece of paper, but usually the works are not intended to be considered together. Paper was relatively expensive in the past; indeed good drawing paper still is much more expensive than normal paper. By book publishing convention, the first page of a book, and sometimes of each section and chapter of a book, is a recto page, and hence all recto pages will have odd numbers and all verso pages will have even numbers. In many early printed books or incunables and still in some 16th- century books (e.g. Jo√£o de Barros's D√©cadas da √Åsia), it is the (\\"leaves\\") rather than the pages, that are numbered. Thus each carries a consecutive number on its recto side, while on the verso side there is no number.See e.g. a modern reprint of the 3rd D√©cada (1563): √Åsia de Jo√£o de Barros: Dos feitos que os Portugueses fizeram no descobrimento e conquista dos mares e terras do Oriente. Tercera D√©cada. Imprensa Nacional ‚Äì Casa da Moeda, 1992. This was also very common in e.g. internal company reports in the 20th century, before double-sided printers became commonplace in offices.

Use of this phrase is first attested in 1901. The term mama's boy has a connotation of effeminacy and weakness. In classical Freudian psychoanalytic theory, the term Oedipus complex denotes a child's desire to have sexual relations with the parent of the opposite sex. Sigmund Freud wrote that a child's identification with the same-sex parent is the successful resolution of the Oedipus complex.Charles Rycroft A Critical Dictionary of Psychoanalysis (London, 2nd Ed. 1995)Joseph Childers, Gary Hentzi eds. Columbia Dictionary of Modern Literary and Cultural Criticism (New York: Columbia University Press, 1995) This theory came into the popular consciousness in America in the 1940s, when sociologists and psychiatrists posited that mothers who were either too close or too distant could hamper the psycho-social development of male children, causing any number of conditions such as autism, asthma, schizophrenia, and homosexuality.

This unfinished work of Dante consists of four trattati, or \\"books\\": a prefatory one, plus three books that each include a canzone (long lyrical poem) and a prose allegorical interpretation or commentary of the poem that goes off in multiple thematic directions. The Convivio is a major stage of development for Dante, very different from the visionary world of the Vita nuova (although like the earlier work it too is a medium for the author‚Äôs evolving sense of artistic vocation and philosophical-spiritual quest). This difference is reflected in how the two works use the prosimetrum format: in the Vita Nova there is a complex interrelation and intertwining between the prose and the poetry, while in the Convivio large blocks of prose have an autonomous existence apart from the poems; the content of the poetry is not amplified or edited in the prose so much as commented upon prosaically, to serve as points of departure for the various subjects that the Convivio discusses. Dante himself tells us that the prose of the Convivio is \\"temperate and virile,\\" in contrast to the \\"fervid and passionate\\" prose of the Vita Nova; and that while the approach to this in the work of his youth was \\"like dreaming\\" the Convivio approaches it subjects soberly and wide awake, often modeling its style on Scholastic authors. The Convivio is a kind of vernacular encyclopedia of the knowledge of Dante's time; it touches on many areas of learning, not only philosophy but also politics, linguistics, science, and history. The treatise begins with the prefatory book, or proem, which explains why a book like the Convivio is needed and why Dante is writing it in the vernacular instead of Latin. It is one of Dante's early defenses of the vernacular, expressed in greater detail in his (slightly earlier) linguistic treatise De vulgari eloquentia (On Eloquence in the Vernacular). Books 2 and 3 form a unit, both focusing on Dante's new love after the death of Beatrice‚Äîhis love for Lady Philosophy, \\"the most beautiful and dignified daughter of the Emperor of the universe,\\" as he calls her. Book 2 discusses allegory and Lady Philosophy (in connection with the canzone Voi che ‚Äôntendendo il terzo ciel movete [You who move the third heaven with an act of the intellect], which opens the book), and also brings such subjects as astronomy, angelology, and the soul's immortality. Book 3 is a hymn of praise for philosophy, launched by an allegorical interpretation of Dante's great canzone Amor che ne la mente mi ragiona (Love, who speaks to me in my mind). In this book, Dante asserts that true philosophy cannot arise from any ulterior motives, such as prestige or money‚Äîit is only possible when the seeker has a love of wisdom for its own sake. Book 4 is by far the longest of the Convivio, and is noticeably distinct from the two books that precede it. The subject of book 4 is the nature of nobility. It opens with the longest canzone of the Convivio, Le dolci rime d‚Äôamor (Those sweet poems of love), which is explicitly about gentilezza or nobility, as well as a condemnation of avarice, asserting that reason and the spirit of acquisition are mutually incompatible. The first half of book 4's thirty chapters are dedicated to debunking the false idea of nobility as an inherited trait, one restricted to the aristocracy, while the final fifteen chapters delineate what true nobility consists of‚Äîthe perfection of a thing according to its nature‚Äîand how nobility manifests in people at various stages of life. The Convivio, in its autobiographical passages and in the trajectories of its lines of thought, gives us a rich portrait of Dante himself, of great importance for an understanding of his work as a whole, especially the Divine Comedy.

Headquartered in Reston, Virginia, it is the oldest national engineering society in the United States. Its constitution was based on the older Boston Society of Civil Engineers from 1848.Perspectives in Civil Engineering: Commemorating the 150th Anniversary of the American Society of Civil Engineers Jeffrey S. Russell; ASCE Publications, January 1, 2003; 392 pages, page 129 \\"They used the constitution of the Boston Society of Civil Engineers, founded four years earlier, as a framework.\\" ASCE is dedicated to the advancement of the science and profession of civil engineering and the enhancement of human welfare through the activities of society members. It has more than 152,000 members in 177 countries. Its mission is to provide essential value to members, their careers, partners, and the public; facilitate the advancement of technology; encourage and provide the tools for lifelong learning; promote professionalism and the profession; develop and support civil engineers. History The first serious and documented attempts to organize civil engineers as a professional society in the newly created United States were in the early 19th century.Goldman, Joanne Abel.

The American civil engineer: Origins and conflict. Technology Press, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 1960. In 1828, John Kilbourn of Ohio, managed a short-lived \\"Civil Engineering Journal\\", editorializing about the recent incorporation of the Institution of Civil Engineers in Great Britain that same year, Kilbourn suggested that the American corps of engineers could constitute an American society of civil engineers. Later, in 1834, an American trade periodical, the \\"American Railroad Journal\\" advocated for similar national organization of civil engineers. = Institution of American Civil Engineers = On December 17, 1838, a petition started circulating asking civil engineers to meet in 1839 in Baltimore, Maryland to organize a permanent society of civil engineers. Prior to that, thirteen notable civil engineers largely identifiable as being from New York, Pennsylvania, or Maryland met in Philadelphia. This group presented the Franklin Institute of Philadelphia with a formal proposal that an Institution of American Civil Engineers be established as an adjunct of the Franklin...\\" Some of them were: * Benjamin Wright. In 1969, the American Society of Civil Engineers declared Wright to be the 'Father of American Civil Engineering'. * William Strickland * Pennsylvanians Edward Miller and Solomon. W. Roberts, the latter being Chief Engineer for the Allegheny Portage railroad, the first crossing of the Allegheny mountains (1831‚Äì1834) Forty engineers actually appeared at the February 1839 meeting Baltimore including J. Edgar Thomson (Future Chief Engineer and later President of the Pennsylvania Railroad), Wright, Roberts, Edward Miller, and the Maryland engineers Isaac Trimble and architect Benjamin H. Latrobe and attendees from as far as Massachusetts, Illinois, and Louisiana. Subsequently, a group met again in Philadelphia, led by its Secretary, Edward Miller to take steps to formalize the society, participants now included such other notable engineers as: * John B. Jervis * Claudius Crozet * William Gibbs McNeill * George Washington Whistler * Walter Gwynn * J. Edgar Thompson * Sylvester Welch, brother of future ASCE president Ashbel Welch * Other members included Jonathan Knight and Moncure Robinson. Miller drafted up a proposed constitution which gave the society's purpose as \\"the collection and diffusion of professional knowledge, the advancement of mechanical philosophy, and the elevation of the character and standing of the Civil Engineers of the United States.\\" Membership in the new society restricted membership to engineers and \\"architects and eminent machinists were to be admitted only as Associates.\\" Hunt, C. Warren. (1897). Historical sketch of the American Society of Civil Engineers. New York: [Printed by order of the Board of Direction]. Accessed at HathiTrust The proposed constitution failed, and no further attempts were made to form another society. Miller later ascribed the failure due to the difficulties of assembling members due available means for traveling in the country at time. One of the other difficulties members would have to contend with was the requirement to produce each year, one previously unpublished paper or \\"...present a scientific book, map, plan or model, not already in the possession of the Society, under the penalty of $10.\\" In that same period, the editor of the American Railroad Journal commented that effort had failed in part due to certain jealousies which arose due to the proposed affiliation with the Franklin Institute. That journal continued discussion on forming an engineers' organization from 1839 thru 1843 serving its own self interests in advocating its journal as a replacement for a professional society but to no avail. = The American Society of Civil Engineers and Architects = During the 1840s, professional organizations continued to develop and organize in the United States. The organizers motives were largely to \\"improve common standards, foster research, and disseminate knowledge through meetings and publications.\\"Schlesinger, A. (1944). Biography of a Nation of Joiners. The American Historical Review, 50(1), 1-25. doi:10.2307/1843565 Accessed on November 9, 2017, at JSTOR=1843556. Unlike earlier associations such as the American Philosophical Society, these newer associations were not seeking to limit membership as much as pursue \\"more specialized interests.\\" Examples of this surge in new professional organizations in America were the American Statistical Association (1839), American Ethnological Society (1842), American Medical Association (1847), American Association for the Advancement of Science, (1848) and National Education Association (1852). During this same period of association incorporations on the 1840s, attempts were again made at organizing an American engineer association. They succeeded at first with the Boston Society of Civil Engineers, organized in 1848 and then in October 1852, with an effort to organize a Society of Civil Engineers and Architects in New York. Led by Alfred W. Craven, Chief Engineer of the Croton Aqueduct and future ASCE president, the meeting resolved to incorporate the society under the name \\"American Society of Civil Engineers And Architects\\". Membership eligibility was restricted to \\"civil, geological, mining and mechanical Engineers, architects, and other persons who, by profession, are interested in the advancement of science.\\" James Laurie was elected the society's first president. The meetings only went through 1855 and with the advent of the American Civil War, the society suspended its activities. The next meeting was more than twelve years later in 1867. A number of the original founders such as James Laurie, J.W. Adams, C. W. Copeland and W. H. Talcott were at this meeting and were dedicated to the objective of resuscitating the Society. They also planned to put the society on a more permanent footing as well as electing fifty-four new members to the Society. With success in that effort, the young engineering society passed a resolution noting that its preservation was mainly due to the persevering efforts of its first president, James Laurie. The address of President James Pugh Kirkwood delivered at that meeting in 1867 was the first publication of the Society, appearing in Volume 1 of \\"Transactions\\", bearing date of 1872. = 19th century = At an early meeting of the Board of Direction in 1852, instructions were given for the incorporation of the \\"American Society of Civil Engineers and Architects\\" but this was the proper steps were never taken, and therefore this name never legally belonged to the Association. On March 4, 1868, by a vote of 17 to 4, the name was changed to \\"American Society of Civil Engineers\\", but it was not until April 17, 1877, that the lack of incorporation was discovered and the proper steps taken to remedy the defect. The society was then chartered and incorporated in New York state. American Society of Civil Engineers., American Society of Civil Engineers., (1877).

Nora Stanton Blatch Barney 1921 =20th century= Nora Stanton Barney was among the first women in the United States to earn a civil engineering degree, graduating from Cornell University in 1905 with a degree in civil engineering. In the same year, she was accepted as a junior member of the organization and began work for the New York City Board of Water Supply. She was the first female member of ASCE, where she was allowed to be a junior member, but was denied advancement to associate member in 1916 because of her gender. In 2015, she was posthumously advanced to ASCE Fellow status. U.S. stamp commemorating the 100th anniversary of the ASCE in 1952 In 1999, the ASCE elected the top- ten \\"civil engineering achievements that had the greatest positive impact on life in the 20th century\\" in \\"broad categories\\". Monuments of the Millennium were a \\"combination of technical engineering achievement, courage and inspiration, and a dramatic influence on the development of [their] communities\\". The achievements and monuments that best exemplified them included: * Airport design and development the Kansai International Airport in Osaka, Japan * Dams the Hoover Dam on the Colorado River in the United States * Interstate Highway System \\"the system overall\\" * Long-span bridges like the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco, California * Rail transportation as exemplified by the Eurotunnel rail system connecting the UK and France * Sanitary landfills and solid waste disposal \\"sanitary waste disposal advances overall\\" * Skyscrapers the Empire State Building in Midtown Manhattan, New York City * Wastewater treatment the Chicago wastewater system * Water supply and distribution the California State Water Project * Water transportation the Panama Canal Overview ASCE's mission is to deliver essential value to \\"its members, their careers, our partners, and the public\\" as well as enable \\"the advancement of technology, encourage and provide the tools for lifelong learning, promote professionalism and the profession.\\" The Society also seeks to \\"develop and support civil engineer leaders, and advocate infrastructure and environmental stewardship.\\" The Society as an exempt organization in the United States (Section 501(c)(3)) was required to reported its program service accomplishments and related expenses and revenues. =Publications= ASCE stated that dissemination of technical and professional information to the civil engineering profession was a major goal of the society. This is accomplished through a variety of publications and information products, including 35 technical and professional journals amongst them the ASCE Journal of Structural Engineering, the Journal of Environmental Engineering, the Journal of Hydraulic Engineering, Journal of Hydrologic Engineering, the Journal of Transportation Engineering, Part A: Systems, Journal of Water Resources Planning and Management, Civil Engineering, the Society's monthly magazine, an online bibliographic database, conference proceedings, standards, manuals of practice and technical reports. The ASCE Library contains 470+ E-books and standards, some with chapter-level access and no restrictive DRM, and 600+ online proceedings. =Conferences, meetings, and education= Each year, more than 55,000 engineers earn continuing education units (CEUs) and/or professional development hours (PDHs) by participating in ASCE's continuing education programs. ASCE hosts more than 15 annual and specialty conferences, over 200 continuing education seminars and more than 300 live web seminars. Meetings include \\"...committees, task forces, focus groups, workshops and seminars designed to bring together civil engineering experts either from specific fields or those with a broad range of experience and skills. These meetings deal with specific topics and issues facing civil engineers such as America's failing infrastructure, sustainability, earthquakes, and bridge collapses.\\" =Engineering programs= The engineering programs division directly advances the science of engineering by delivering technical content for ASCE's publications, conferences and continuing education programs. It consists of eight discipline specific institutes, four technical divisions and six technical councils. The work is accomplished by over 600 technical committees with editorial responsibility for 28 of ASCE's 33 journals. On an annual basis, the division conducts more than twelve congresses and specialty conferences. As a founding society of ANSI and accredited standards development organization, ASCE committees use an established and audited process to produce consensus standards under a program supervised by the Society's Codes and Standards Committee. Civil Engineering Certification Inc. (CEC), affiliated with ASCE, has been established to support specialty certification academies for civil engineering specialties and is accredited by the Council of Engineering and Scientific Specialty Boards (CESB). CEC also handles safety certification for state, municipal, and federal buildings, formerly the province of the now-defunct Building Security Council. The Committee on Critical Infrastructure (CCI) provides vision and guidance on ASCE activities related to critical infrastructure resilience, including planning, design, construction, O&M;, and event mitigation, response and recovery. Certification is the recognition of attaining advanced knowledge and skills in a specialty area of civil engineering. ASCE offers certifications for engineers who demonstrate advanced knowledge and skills in their area of engineering. *American Academy of Water Resources Engineers (AAWRE) *Academy of Geo-Professionals (AGP) *Academy of Coastal, Ocean, Port & Navigation Engineers (ACOPNE) Institutes ASCE also has nine full-service institutes created to serve working professionals working within specialized fields of civil engineering: *Architectural Engineering Institute (AEI) *Coasts, Oceans, Ports and Rivers Institute (COPRI) *Construction Institute (CI) *Engineering Mechanics Institute (EMI) *Environmental and Water Resources Institute (EWRI) *Geo-Institute (G-I) *Transportation and Development Institute (T&DI;) *Structural Engineering Institute (SEI) *Utility Engineering & Surveying Institute (UESI) Advocacy To advance its policy mission, ASCE \\"...identifies legislation to improve the nation's infrastructure, and advance the profession of engineering specifically, ASCE lobbied on legislation at the Federal, State and local levels. In 2015, ASCE's Lobbying at the Federal level was focused primarily upon: *Reauthorization of the federal surface transportation programs such as Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act (MAP-21) *Reauthorization of the brownfields revitalization and environmental restoration act. *Reauthorization of the national dam safety program and creation of a national levee safety program due to National Levee Safety Act Of 2007, WRDA Title IX, Section 9000. *Reauthorization of the Clean Water State Revolving Fund program *Reauthorization of the drinking water state revolving fund program *Water resources development act *funding for stem education programs *Reauthorization of the 1977 national earthquake hazards reduction program *Reauthorization of the national windstorm impact reduction act *Safe building code incentive act *Appropriations for federal programs relating to civil engineering, including surface transportation, aviation, water resources, environment, education, homeland security, and research and development. Lobbying at the state and local level focused primarily upon licensure of civil engineers, procurement of engineering services, continuing education, and the financing of infrastructure improvements as well as lobbying at the state level to raise the minimum requirements for licensure as a professional engineer as part of ASCE's Raise the Bar (RTB) and Civil Engineering Body of Knowledge (CEBoK) initiatives. For 2018, ASCE identified Federal advocacy priorities as follows: * Civil engineering education (higher education) * Clean water, drinking water and wastewater issues * Natural hazards mitigation & infrastructure security * Qualifications-Based Selection for engineering services * Research and Development Funding * Science, technology, engineering and math(STEM) education & support (K-12) * Sustainability, implicitly sustainable engineering * Transportation infrastructure The State advocacy priorities in 2018 are as follows: * Licensing * Natural Hazards Impact Mitigation * Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM) education & support (K-12) * State support for civil engineering higher education * Sustainability, implicitly sustainable engineering * Tort reform & indemnification for pro bono services * Transportation infrastructure financing =Strategic issues and initiatives= To promote the Society's objectives and address key issues facing the civil engineering profession, ASCE developed three strategic initiatives: Sustainable Infrastructure, the ASCE Grand Challenge, and Raise the Bar. =Policy statements= ASCE developed policy statements on major technical, professional and educational issues of interest to the civil engineering community and the nation in the following areas: * Coastal zones, off shore and waterways * Dams, flood control and levees * Disaster mitigation and response * Diversity * Education, inclusive of statements on history and heritage of civil engineering, STEM and academic prerequisites for licensure and professional practice laying out ASCE's Raise the Bar and Civil Engineering Body of Knowledge initiatives. * Energy * Engineering practice, inclusive of statements on civil engineering project team, engineering surveying, Aesthetics, Professional Ethics and Conflict of Interest, Combating Corruption * Environmental issues, inclusive of statements on acid rain, physical and economic impacts of climate change, pollution management, wetlands regulatory policy, support for the Endangered Species, harmful algal blooms, greenhouse gases and electronic waste recycling. * Government * Hazardous and solid waste * Infrastructure, inclusive of statements on ** Sustainable growth and development that integrates \\"... appropriate urban scale and form, diversity of land use and good engineering design to achieve a balance between the interests of the individual, the community and the natural and built environments.\\"L√©l√©, Sharachchandra M. \\"Sustainable development: a critical review.\\" World development 19.6 (1991): 607-621.

ASCE argues that policy makers should seek to maximize the rate of economic return on infrastructure investment. ASCE advocates for these decision-makers to follow established project and program management principles funded from a wide range of options and types of infrastructure debt such as dedicated user-fees, bonds, Public‚Äìprivate partnership, private investment, infrastructure banks such as the proposed National Infrastructure Reinvestment Bank, state and federal loan funds such as the Highway Trust Fund or State Revolving Funds. This effort had three sub-initiatives: *** Leadership in Infrastructure Renewal, ASCE makes the argument that the United States needs a \\"compelling and overarching vision\\" for infrastructure investment. This statement on infrastructure policy and related reports laid the conceptual framework for the ASCE Report Card for America's Infrastructure, related \\"Failure to Act\\" reports and State and Regional Infrastructure Report Cards and guiding principle recommendations for planning and executing critical infrastructure in the United States. *** Sustainability, Resiliency and Innovation, ASCE advocates that life-cycle cost analysis should be a part of every new or renewed infrastructure project with funding allocated to develop new and improved techniques in delivering projects, construction engineering and building materials for meeting society's infrastructure needs. This statement on infrastructure policy and related reports laid the conceptual framework for the ASCE Grand Challenge and related report on the recommended use of life-cycle cost analysis in transportation planning. *** Plans to Sustain and Enhance Infrastructure, ASCE makes the argument that infrastructure investment should be prioritized by program managers and executed by project managers; according to well-conceived management plans that are consistent with the \\"...national vision and focus on system wide metrics.\\" ** Regulatory process for infrastructure development, ASCE advocates for strategies that expedite regulatory processes and related decision-making for critical infrastructure projects to \\"proceed in a timely manner\\". Its recommendations in this area was for programs to require concurrent reviews by project stakeholders managing design codes (such as UBC and NEC)and other permitting such as wetlands dredge and fill for infrastructure projects. ASCE also recommended the creation of a \\"single administrative processing/permitting agency\\" for approving plans for constructing critical infrastructure as well as time-limits on permitting agency decision-making for approving infrastructure project plans. * International * Legal reform * Licensure * Procurement/contract issues * Public involvement * Quality/standards * Research * Space * Tax issues * Transportation issues * Wastewater * Water resources management Awards and designations ASCE Historical Marker at Philadelphia City Hall.

One award is present in each category of design, construction, government, education, and management. = Walter L. Huber Civil Engineering Research Prize = In July 1946, the Board of Direction authorized annual awards on recommendation by the Society's Committee on Research to stimulate research in civil engineering. In October 1964, Mrs. Alberta Reed Huber endowed these prizes in honor of her husband, Walter L. Huber, Past President, ASCE. The Huber Prize is considered the highest level mid-career research prize in civil engineering and is awarded for outstanding achievements and contributions in research with respect to all disciplines of civil engineering. LTPP International Data Analysis Contest Award The LTPP International Data Analysis Contest is an annual data analysis contest held by the ASCE in collaboration with the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA). The participants are supposed to use the LTPP data. ASCE Foundation The ASCE Foundation is a charitable foundation established in 1994 to support and promote civil engineering programs that \\"... enhance quality of life, promote the profession, advance technical practices, and prepare civil engineers for tomorrow.\\" It is incorporated separately from the ASCE, although it has a close relationship to it and all the Foundation's personnel are employees of ASCE. The Foundation Board of Directors has seven persons and its bylaws require that four of the seven directors must be ASCE officers as well and the ASCE executive director and Chief financial officer must also be ASCE employees. The Foundation's support is most often to ASCE's charitable, educational and scientific programs. The Foundation's largest program is supporting three strategic areas; lifelong learning and leadership, advocacy for infrastructure investment and the role of civil engineers in sustainable practices. In 2014, this foundation's support in these areas was almost US$4 million.

The press release was considered controversial because it contained information not present in the report, conflicting with the report, and minimized the Army Corps' involvement in the catastrophe: \\"Even without breaching, Hurricane Katrina's rainfall and surge overtopping would have caused extensive and severe flooding‚Äîand the worst loss of life and property loss ever experienced in New Orleans.\\" The report stated that had levees and pump stations not failed, \\"far less property loss would have occurred and nearly two-thirds of deaths could have been avoided.\\" The ASCE administration was criticized by the Times-Picayune for an attempt to minimize and understate the role of the Army Corps in the flooding.(June 19, 2007) EDITORIAL: Sound bites and spin jobs The Times-Picayune. Retrieved November 17, 2015. Ethics complaint In October 2007, Raymond Seed, a University of California-Berkeley civil engineering professor and ASCE member submitted a 42-page ethics complaint to the ASCE alleging that the Corps of Engineers with ASCE's help sought to minimize the Corps' mistakes in the flooding, intimidate anyone who tried to intervene, and delay the final results until the public's attention had turned elsewhere. The Corps acknowledged receiving a copy of the letter and refused to comment until the ASCE's Committee on Professional Conduct (CPC) had commented on the complaint. It took over a year for the ASCE to announce the results of the CPC. The ASCE self-study panel did not file charges of ethical misconduct and blamed errors on \\"staff\\" and not review panel members having created the June press release.\\" Review panels to examine alleged ethics breaches On November 14, 2007, ASCE announced that U.S. Congressman Sherwood Boehlert, R‚ÄëN.Y. (ret), would lead an independent task force of outside experts to review how ASCE participated in engineering studies of national significance.Task force will review engineers' studies The Times Picayune, December 8, 2007 ASCE President David Mongan said the review was to address criticism of ASCE¬¥s role in assisting the Army Corps of Engineers-sponsored investigation of Katrina failures. Mongan assured citizens of metro New Orleans in a letter to the Times Picayune, that ASCE took \\"this matter very seriously and that appropriate actions are being taken\\".ASCE is investigating The Times Picayune, December 2, 2007 The panel recommended in results released on September 12, 2008, that ASCE should immediately take steps to remove the potential for conflict of interest in its participation in post-disaster engineering studies. The most important recommendations were that peer review funds over $1 million should come from a separate source, like the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), that ASCE should facilitate but not control the assessment teams, and that information to the public and press should be disseminated not under the extremely tight controls that Ray Seed and his team experienced. It concluded that ASCE should draw up an ethics policy to eliminate questions of possible conflicts of interest. On April 6, 2009, an internal probe with the ASCE issued a report that ordered a retraction of the ASCE's June 1, 2007, press release. The panel determined that the press release had \\"inadvertently conveyed a misleading impression regarding the role of engineering failures in the devastation of New Orleans\\", that it incorrectly said that surge levels along Mississippi's coastline were higher than water levels caused by a tsunami in the Indian Ocean in 2004, and that it had incorrectly repeated estimates of deaths and property damage in New Orleans that might have occurred if levees and floodwalls had not been breached.  Grassroots group spoof of ASCE - USACE relationship  On November 5, 2007, New Orleans-based grassroots group Levees.org led by Sandy Rosenthal criticized the ASCE's close relationship with the United States Army Corps of Engineers in a spoof online public service announcement. On November 12, 2007, the ASCE asked Levees.org to remove the video from the internet, threatening the organization with legal action if it did not comply. On November 13, the Times-Picayune posted the video on its website. Flanked by lawyers with Adams and Reese in the presence of extensive media coverage, the group ignored the threat and posted the video to YouTube citing Louisiana's Anti-SLAPP statute, a \\"strategic lawsuit against public participation\\", which allows courts to weed out lawsuits designed to chill public participation on matters of public significance. In a response for comment, ASCE President Mongan replied, \\"Since the video has already been widely reposted by other organizations, moving forward, we feel our time and expertise are best utilized working to help protect the residents of New Orleans from future storms and flooding.\\" USACE grant money for disinformation, 2008 In March 2008, Levees.org announced that records obtained under the Freedom of Information Act revealed that as early October 2005, the Army Corps of Engineers had directed and later paid the ASCE more than $1.1 million for its peer review (Grant Number: W912HZ-06-1-0001). The grant also paid for a series of misleading ASCE presentations attempting to shift blame away from the corps and onto local levee officials. Members of the ASCE are forbidden from making false or exaggerated statements and also from making statements for an interested party unless this is disclosed. Levees.org claimed the records showed how the external peer review would be done in four phases: Phase 1 was research and analysis on the performance of the levees, floodwalls and other important structures. Phase 2 was provision of information on the current system to prevent future flooding. Phase 3 was provision of information to evaluate alternative approaches to flood protection. Phase 4 was transfer information and knowledge gained to a broader audience within Corps and its consultancy community to communicate lessons learned. The group claimed that these records were proof that ASCE's routine powerpoint presentation from 2007 and 2008 were a public relations campaign to repair the corps' reputation. ASCE officials responded that ASCE paid for the powerpoint presentations itself and had not used USACE grant money for that purpose.

These are aggregations of efferent nerve fibers from the upper motor neurons that travel from the cerebral cortex and terminate either in the brainstem (corticobulbar) or spinal cord (corticospinal) and are involved in the control of motor functions of the body. The corticobulbar tract conducts impulses from the brain to the cranial nerves.Chapter 9 of \\"Principles of Physiology\\" (3rd edition) by Robert M. Berne and Mathew N. Levy. Published by Mosby, Inc. (2000) . These nerves control the muscles of the face and neck and are involved in facial expression, mastication, swallowing, and other motor functions. The corticospinal tract conducts impulses from the brain to the spinal cord. It is made up of a lateral and anterior tract. The corticospinal tract is involved in voluntary movement. The majority of fibres of the corticospinal tract cross over in the medulla oblongata, resulting in muscles being controlled by the opposite side of the brain. The corticospinal tract contains the axons of the pyramidal cells, the largest of which are the Betz cells, located in the cerebral cortex. The pyramidal tracts are named because they pass through the pyramids of the medulla oblongata. The corticospinal fibers when descending from the internal capsule to the brain stem, converge to a point from multiple directions giving the impression of an inverted pyramid. Involvement of the pyramidal tract at any level leads to pyramidal signs. The myelination of the pyramidal fibres is incomplete at birth and gradually progresses in cranio-caudal direction and thereby progressively gaining functionality. Most of the myelination is complete by two years of age and thereafter it progresses very slowly in cranio-caudal direction up to twelve years of age. Structure Pyramidal tracts The term pyramidal tracts refers to upper motor neurons that originate in the cerebral cortex and terminate in the spinal cord (corticospinal) or brainstem (corticobulbar). Nerves emerge in the cerebral cortex, pass down and may cross sides in the medulla oblongata, and travel as part of the spinal cord until they synapse with interneurons in the grey column of the spinal cord. There is some variation in terminology. The pyramidal tracts definitively encompass the corticospinal tracts, and many authors also include the corticobulbar tracts. =Corticospinal tract= Nerve fibres in the corticospinal tract originate from pyramidal cells in layer V of the cerebral cortex. Fibres arise from the primary motor cortex (about 30%), supplementary motor area and the premotor cortex (together also about 30%), and the somatosensory cortex, parietal lobe, and cingulate gyrus supplies the rest. The cells have their bodies in the cerebral cortex, and the axons form the bulk of the pyramidal tracts. The nerve axons travel from the cortex through the posterior limb of internal capsule, through the cerebral peduncle and into the brainstem and anterior medulla oblongata. Here they form two prominences called the medulla oblongatary pyramids. Below the prominences, the majority of axons cross over to the opposite side from which they originated, known as decussation. The axons that cross over move to the outer part of the medulla oblongata and form the lateral corticospinal tract, whereas the fibres that remain form the anterior corticospinal tract. About 80% of axons cross over and form the lateral corticospinal tract; 10% do not cross over and join the tract, and 10% of fibres travel in the anterior corticospinal tract. The nerve axons traveling down the tract are the efferent nerve fibers of the upper motor neurons. These axons travel down the tracts in the white matter of the spinal cord until they reach the vertebral level of the muscle that they will innervate. At this point, the axons synapse with lower motor neurons. The majority of axons do not directly synapse with lower motor neurons, but instead synapse with an interneuron that then synapses with a lower motor neuron. This generally occurs in the anterior grey column. Nerve axons of the lateral corticospinal tract that did not cross over in the medulla oblongata do so at the level of the spinal cord they terminate in. These tracts contain more than 1 million axons and the majority of the axons are myelinated. The corticospinal tracts myelinate largely during the first and second years after birth. The majority of nerve axons are small (<4Œºm) in diameter. About 3% of nerve axons have a much larger diameter (16Œºm) and arise from Betz cells, mostly in the leg area of the primary motor cortex. These cells are notable because of their rapid conduction rate, over 70m/sec, the fastest conduction of any signals from the brain to the spinal cord. Horizontal section through the lower part of the pons, showing the fibers of the corticospinal tract (#19) passing through the pontine nuclei =Corticobulbar tract= Fibres from the ventral motor cortex travel with the corticospinal tract through the internal capsule, but terminate in a number of locations in the midbrain (cortico-mesencephalic tract), pons (Corticopontine tract), and medulla oblongata (cortico-bulbar tract). The upper motor neurons of the corticobulbar tract synapse with interneurons or directly with the lower motor neurons located in the motor cranial nerve nuclei, namely oculomotor, trochlear, motor nucleus of the trigeminal nerve, abducens, facial nerve and accessory and in the nucleus ambiguus to the hypoglossal, vagus and accessory nerves. These nuclei are supplied by nerves from both sides of the brain, with the exception of the parts of the facial nerve that control muscles of the lower face. These muscles are only innervated by nerves from the contralateral (opposite) side of the cortex. Function The nerves within the corticospinal tract are involved in movement of muscles of the body. Because of the crossing-over of fibres, muscles are supplied by the side of the brain opposite to that of the muscle. The nerves within the corticobulbar tract are involved in movement in muscles of the head. They are involved in swallowing, phonation, and movements of the tongue. By virtue of involvement with the facial nerve, the corticobulbar tract is also responsible for transmitting facial expression. With the exception of lower muscles of facial expression, all functions of the corticobulbar tract involve inputs from both sides of the brain. The extrapyramidal system refers to tracts within the spinal cord involved in involuntary movement but not part of the pyramidal tracts. Their functions include the control of posture and muscle tone. Clinical significance # Damage to the fibres of the corticospinal tracts, anywhere along their course from the cerebral cortex to the lower end of the spinal cord, can cause an upper motor neuron syndrome. # A few days after the injury to the upper motor neurons, a pattern of motor signs and symptoms appears, including spasticity, hyperactive reflexes, a loss of the ability to perform fine movements, and an extensor plantar response known as the Babinski sign. # Symptoms generally occur alongside other sensory problems. # Causes may include disorders such as strokes, cerebral palsy, subdural hemorrhage, abscesses and tumours, neurodegenerative diseases such as multiple system atrophy, inflammation such as meningitis and multiple sclerosis, and trauma to the spinal cord, including from slipped discs. # If the corticobulbar tract is damaged on only one side, then only the lower face will be affected, however if there is involvement of both the left and right tracts, then the result is pseudobulbar palsy. This causes problems with swallowing, speaking, and emotional lability. # Severe disabling involuntary movements such as hemiballismus or severe chorea might exhaust the patient and become a life threatening situation. # In the past, this condition was treated by partial section of the pyramidal tract either at the primary motor cortex or at the cruz cerebri (pedunculotomy).

A key Ohio Republican political insider, he is best remembered for his service as Attorney General of the United States under Presidents Warren G. Harding and Calvin Coolidge, as well as for his involvement in the Teapot Dome scandal during Harding's presidency. Despite his status as a key political leader of the Ohio Republican Party from the 1880s through the first decade of the 20th century, Daugherty was himself only briefly a statewide elected politician, serving just two terms in the Ohio General Assembly, working closely during the last two years with Governor William McKinley. Although he sought national office several times, Daugherty was thwarted in his effort to obtain the nomination of his party and was never elected to office again. Daugherty remained an influential figure behind the election of several Congressmen and U.S. Senators. In 1920 he was Harding's campaign manager at the Republican National Convention. Following Harding's successful election Daugherty was named Attorney General. In this capacity, he was instrumental in winning presidential pardons for jailed anti-war dissidents such as Eugene V. Debs. Twice the subject of federal corruption investigations, in 1924 Daugherty was forced to resign his post as Attorney General by the late Harding's presidential successor, Calvin Coolidge. Biography =Early years= Harry M. Daugherty was born January 26, 1860 in the small town of Washington Court House, Ohio. Daugherty's father, John H. Daugherty, was the Pennsylvania-born son of Irish immigrants and worked as a farmer and tailor.James N. Giglio, H.M. Daughterty and the Politics of Expediency. Kent, OH: Kent State University Press, 1978; pg. 2. His mother, Jane Draper Daugherty, was from a prominent Ohio family with Virginia roots dating back to the time of the American Revolution. Daugherty was a first cousin of actress Majel Coleman.Shadow of Blooming Grove, Francis Russell, McGraw Hill, 1968 Daugherty's father died of diphtheria when Harry was just four years old, as did one of his brothers, leaving his mother as the sole provider for the household.Giglio, H.M. Daugherty and the Politics of Expediency, pg. 3. Harry and his older brother, Mally, were forced by economic necessity to take a variety of jobs from a relatively early age to help with the family's living expenses. Daugherty's mother later recalled that he was so young when he worked in a local grocery store that he had to stand on a wooden crate to reach the cash register. Daugherty's mother wanted him to become a Methodist minister, but the prospect of life as a clergyman held no appeal for him. Instead, after graduating from high school in Washington Court House, Daugherty studied medicine for a year before taking a position as a cub reporter for The Cincinnati Enquirer. In 1878 Daugherty entered the University of Michigan Law School, accepted there despite not having first obtained an undergraduate education. He supplemented his insufficient income by gambling, winning a significant sum betting on the election of James Garfield in the 1880 presidential election. Sports betting was also an area of some interest to Daugherty and his brother, who went so far as to tap telegraph wires so that they could obtain game information in advance.Giglio, H.M. Daugherty and the Politics of Expediency, pp. 3-4. Initially successful, this ethically shady activity was ultimately discovered and exposed by local gamblers puzzled by the brothers' uncanny success. Daugherty graduated from law school in 1881 and returned home to Ohio, where he accepted a job in the office of a Washington Court House attorney, spending his spare time preparing to take the Ohio state bar examination.Giglio, H.M. Daugherty and the Politics of Expediency, pg. 4. =Factional soldier= Gov. Joseph B. Foraker, with whom Daugherty was politically allied as a young man, as he appeared in 1902. In 1882 Daugherty was elected by the Fayette County Republican Central Committee as the recording secretary of the organization. He ran for political office in the election of 1882, winning election as the clerk of nearby Union Township. In this capacity Daugherty served a single two-year term, earning a salary of $1500 per year. The following year Daugherty was elected secretary of the Fayette County Executive Committee, where he earned a reputation as an intense and astute young political activist. He was selected as one of five delegates from the Fayette Country Republican Party as a delegate to the Ohio State Republican Convention in 1883, held in Columbus. There Daugherty helped select an aggressive young Cincinnati judge named Joseph B. Foraker as the party's 1883 gubernatorial nominee.Giglio, H.M. Daugherty and the Politics of Expediency, pg. 5. A close political relationship developed between Foraker and Daugherty, with Daugherty exerting himself in support of Foraker's unsuccessful 1883 campaign. When Foraker was elected as Governor of Ohio in 1885, he was able to return the favor, boosting his prot√©g√© Daugherty's career. The connection between the two was tightened further in September 1884, when Daugherty married Lucille Walker of Wellston, Ohio ‚Äì a cousin of Foraker's wife. Daugherty was elected to a two-year term on the city council in the election of 1885, serving from 1886 to 1887.Giglio, H.M. Daugherty and the Politics of Expediency, pg. 6. He was elected as chairman of the Fayette County Republican Central Committee in 1886 but spent most of his time helping to establish a law practice. After practicing alone for three years, Daugherty formed a partnership with Horatio B. Maynard, a prominent local lawyer, and the new practice soon emerged as a leading law firm in the county. In 1889 Republican David Worthington decided not to seek reelection to the Ohio General Assembly and Daugherty threw his hat into the ring. After eking out a narrow victory in the Republican primary election, Daugherty emerged victorious in November, winning election to the Ohio House of Representatives by slightly more than 800 votes out of 5,100 ballots cast. Although Daugherty won his race, his close political ally Joseph Foraker lost his bid for a third term as Governor and the Democratic Party won control of the Assembly as well, forcing Daugherty to participate as a member of the minority party. Daugherty won reelection to the Ohio House of Representatives in the fall of 1891, beating his Democratic opponent by more than 750 votes out of about 4,900 cast.Giglio, H.M. Daugherty and the Politics of Expediency, pg. 10. This time Ohio Republicans recaptured not only the Governor's mansion ‚Äì electing William McKinley to the state's chief executive office ‚Äì but also the majority of the state assembly. Since in this era United States Senators were elected by state legislatures rather than by direct vote of the people, this meant that a Republican would be sent to Washington, DC to fill the expiring term of Senator John Sherman when the assembly reconvened in January 1892. =Change of alliances= Mark Hanna, a key leader of the Sherman faction of the Ohio Republican Party, as he appeared in 1896. The Ohio Republican Party had for several years been deeply split along factional lines, with Senator Sherman and former Governor Foraker leading rival groups of party activists and political functionaries. Foraker was determined to challenge Sherman for his Senate seat and sought assurances from Daugherty that he would continue to support him when the matter came before the legislature. This placed Daugherty in a difficult position, since his native Fayette County was solidly behind the Sherman faction, which included Governor McKinley and the significant financial clout of Cleveland businessman Mark Hanna.Giglio, H.M. Daugherty and the Politics of Expediency, pp. 8-10. Forced by the logic of the situation to switch alliances rather than risk being cast into political oblivion, Daugherty abandoned Foraker in the final contest of the Ohio Republican caucus on January 2, 1892, joining 52 others in voting for Sherman, against 38 for the insurgent campaign of Foraker.Giglio, H.M. Daugherty and the Politics of Expediency, pg. 11. In the aftermath of the caucus that would determine Ohio's U.S. Senator, editorials of the Democratic Columbus Post charged that Daugherty and fourteen other Ohio legislators had changed their support from Foraker to Sherman based upon \\"intimidation, threats, promises, and actual purchase\\" and accused Daugherty by name of having accepted cash payments. A formal investigation of this charge by a bi-partisan four member committee of the Ohio State Senate followed, with Daugherty being unanimously cleared of all charges in a report issued in April 1892.Giglio, H.M. Daugherty and the Politics of Expediency, pg. 12. The 1892 Senatorial campaign marked the formal attachment of Daugherty to the dominant Sherman-Hanna faction of the Ohio Republican Party after the better part of a decade as a trusted adherent of the rival Foraker faction.Giglio, H.M. Daugherty and the Politics of Expediency, pg. 13. The move broadened Daugherty's political possibilities, and he was made chairman of the powerful Corporations Committee and named a member of the Judiciary Committee. In 1893 Daugherty was chosen as chairman of the Ohio Republican State Convention which nominated McKinley as the party's candidate for Governor.\\"Harry M. Daugherty,\\" in Joseph Patterson Smith (ed.), History of the Republican Party of Ohio: Volume 2. Chicago: Lewis Publishing Co., 1898; pp. 411-412. Governor McKinley also named Daugherty as his floor leader in the House of Representatives, keeping party members in line behind the governor's legislative agenda. Over the next two years McKinley and Daugherty forged a close political friendship, working together closely and frequently sharing meals at breakfast and in the evening. With the Foraker faction, however, Daugherty became persona non grata due to what was perceived as his duplicitous political disloyalty. Daugherty attempted to gain nomination as a Republican candidate for Congress in 1892, but the 7th District Republican Convention which put forward the party's nominee was irreconcilably split between Daugherty and his former law partner, A.R. Creamer, and wound up backing a dark horse candidate as a compromise, George W. Wilson.Giglio, H.M. Daugherty and the Politics of Expediency, pp. 14-15. Wilson won his race in the November 1892 general election and wound up serving four years in Congress on behalf of the 7th District. In the aftermath of his failure to win a seat in Congress, Sherman offered Daugherty a political appointment as Assistant District Attorney in Columbus.Giglio, H.M. Daugherty and the Politics of Expediency, pg. 15. Daugherty ultimately decided to decline this position, instead opening a new law office in that city, while still remaining a resident and practicing attorney in his hometown of Washington Court House. =The Washington Court House riot= Ohio Historical Marker at the Fayette County Courthouse in Washington Court House, Ohio On October 9, 1894, a black man named William Dolby was accused of assaulting a white woman named Mary C. Boyd in her home at Parrett's Station, a small settlement near Washington Court House.Howard Burba, \\"A Wild Night at Washington C.H.,\\" Dayton Daily News, June 26, 1932. Dolby fled but was soon arrested and taken back to the jail at Washington Court House, where signs quickly pointed to an outburst of mob violence.Giglio, H.M. Daugherty and the Politics of Expediency, pg. 16. Dolby supposedly confessed to the crime \\"upon being apprehended\\". The Fayette County sheriff called upon Governor McKinley to send out the militia to defend the prisoner from a prospective lynch mob following his sentencing to twenty years in prison at a hearing held on October 16. On October 17 two companies of militiamen arrived at Washington Court House to guard Dolby for his coming transport to the Ohio Penitentiary at Columbus. That evening a mob gathered and began a siege of the jail, attempting to batter down the jailhouse doors so that the prisoner could be removed and violently killed. Commander of the National Guard forces, Colonel Alonzo Coit, ordered his troops to fire upon the enraged lynch mob, which they did, killing five rioters and wounding fifteen others. The mob still failed to disperse and fears grew that an armed assault would be launched by furious local citizens on the militiamen defending the jail. Around 2 am a second volley was fired by the defenders, this time over the heads of the rioters, with the gunfire finally having its desired effect of breaking up the unlawful gathering. In the aftermath Governor McKinley appointed a special court of inquiry to investigate the riot and militia shooting. Following an investigation, the court of inquiry returned an indictment against Col. Coit, charging him with manslaughter in the incident. McKinley then called upon Daugherty to shoulder the politically unpopular job of defending Coit at trial, in the face of a wrathful Fayette County citizenry which sought his conviction. Daugherty accepted the Coit case, and on March 5, 1895, won his acquittal of manslaughter charges. =From politician to political operator= Theodore E. Burton, a Congressman and Senator, was a key Daugherty ally during the first decade of the 20th Century. Although Daugherty sought nomination by the Ohio Republican Party for Governor in 1895, Hanna decided to support another candidate instead, so Daugherty decided to launch a run for Ohio Attorney General instead.Giglio, H.M. Daugherty and the Politics of Expediency, pp. 16-17. The Ohio Republican Convention was dominated by the Foraker faction, however, and Foraker loyalist Frank S. Monnett was nominated for the Attorney General post over the deeply distrusted Daugherty.Giglio, H.M. Daugherty and the Politics of Expediency, pg. 17. Not daunted by his loss, in 1896 Daugherty announced his desire to win election to Congress. An advisory primary election was held among Fayette County Republicans in March 1896, in which Daugherty narrowly won a bitterly fought race.Giglio, H.M. Daugherty and the Politics of Expediency, pg. 18. The actual nomination was to be made by the 7th District Republican Convention, however, and there Daugherty fell victim to factional machinations, with the nomination going instead to Walter L. Weaver, who would ultimately serve two terms in Congress.Giglio, H.M. Daugherty and the Politics of Expediency, pp. 18-19. For a second time Daugherty had been denied. The Republican National Committee recognized Daugherty's gifts as an indefatigable partisan and effective stump speaker, however, and sent him out on the road in support of McKinley's campaign for President of the United States in 1896. Daugherty traveled through Nebraska, North Dakota, South Dakota, Minnesota, and Ohio, logging over 9,000 miles traveled in delivering some 47 campaign speeches in support of McKinley and the Republicans' successful effort. In 1898 conflict emerged between Daugherty and Hanna over the slow payment of thousands of dollars of legal fees incurred by then-U.S. Senator Hanna in defending himself against a Senate investigation of electoral bribery charges.Giglio, H.M. Daugherty and the Politics of Expediency, pp. 19-21. While Daugherty's insistence upon being paid had made for a tense relationship, the actual parting of their ways came in 1899, when Daugherty again sought the Republican nomination for Governor of Ohio.Giglio, H.M. Daugherty and the Politics of Expediency, pg. 21. Neither Foraker nor Hanna supported Daugherty for the position, with Hanna lending his support to George K. Nash and Foraker clearly still seething over Daugherty's 1892 abandonment. Daugherty took his fight all the way to the Ohio Republican Convention before losing to Nash, 461 delegate votes to 205.Giglio, H.M. Daugherty and the Politics of Expediency, pg. 23. Over the next five years Daugherty skillfully built political influence in the Ohio Republican establishment by dealing with leaders of both of the party's major factions.Giglio, H.M. Daugherty and the Politics of Expediency, pg. 26. Daugherty maintained considerable influence with Republicans in the state legislature, who had known and worked with Daugherty for years.Giglio, H.M. Daugherty and the Politics of Expediency, pg. 27. His political rehabilitation was only partial, however, for as long as Foraker and Hanna remained the top factional leaders of Ohio Republican politics there remained a very real ceiling beyond which Daugherty could never hope to rise.Giglio, H.M. Daugherty and the Politics of Expediency, pg. 28. Hanna's death in February 1904 and a subsequent discrediting of some of his top allies such as George B. Cox on grounds of political bossism again cleared the way for Daugherty's emergence. By 1906 Daugherty stood as a leader of a new insurgent political faction which included Congressman Theodore E. Burton of Cleveland and former Governor Myron T. Herrick. Daugherty and Burton aligned themselves with supporters of William Howard Taft, Secretary of War under progressive Republican President Theodore Roosevelt, and together the factional allies forced Foraker out of the United States Senate and into political retirement, aided by muckraking news reports that Foraker had received nearly $30,000 as a political retainer from the Standard Oil Trust.Giglio, H.M. Daugherty and the Politics of Expediency, pg. 34. Daugherty was instrumental in helping his ally Burton win election to the Senate in 1908 but was once again relegated to a key backstage role instead of himself standing for election to high office.Giglio, H.M. Daugherty and the Politics of Expediency, pg. 35. Daugherty's position as a political boss rather than a public politician had once again been confirmed. During the party split of 1912, Daugherty was a staunch supporter of Taft and old guard Republican conservatism against the progressive Republicanism espoused by Roosevelt.Giglio, H.M. Daugherty and the Politics of Expediency, pg. 55. Daugherty was a key figure on the ground in Ohio in behalf of the Taft campaign, issuing a major address on May 18 which was so well regarded that it was reproduced as a pamphlet by the Taft organization.Giglio, H.M. Daugherty and the Politics of Expediency, pg. 58. Although Daugherty's machinations along with Cuyahoga County boss Maurice Maschke carried the state Republican convention for Taft, a split of the Republican field in the November election propelled Democrat Woodrow Wilson to the presidency with a plurality of under 42% of the vote. =The Harding campaign= U.S. Senator Warren Harding, circa 1918. The establishment of primary elections for the U.S. Senate in 1914 greatly reduced the power of political bosses such as Daugherty. He remained fully engaged as a political operative in spite of this major change, however, attaching himself to a powerful state senator named Warren G. Harding. Daugherty had known Harding since the autumn of 1899, when he had been prominent in Ohio politics and Harding was a 35-year-old upstart.Giglio, H.M. Daugherty and the Politics of Expediency, pg. 82. It would not be too many years before these roles were reversed, however, with Harding elected to the state senate in 1901 and appointed Republican floor leader in that same session. Harding was an eloquent speaker and a skilled negotiator of political compromise and emerged as one of the top leaders of the Foraker faction. During the 1912 party split, Daugherty and Harding forged a political friendship working on behalf of the Taft campaign, with Daugherty filling the role of Ohio Republican Party chairman with Harding's newspaper, the Marion Daily Star, giving Daugherty its full support.Giglio, H.M. Daugherty and the Politics of Expediency, pg. 83. Both were politically ambitious and while they enjoyed one another's company, they were not intimate personal friends. Harding managed to win election to the Senate in 1914. Daugherty ran for the Republican Senate nomination in 1916, campaigning against former Senator Charles W.F. Dick and former Governor Herrick. Herrick won the nomination, and lost the general election to Atlee Pomerene.Dodd, Mead and Company, New International Yearbook: A Compendium of the World's Progress, 1917, page 503 Ever the political manipulator, in January 1918 Daugherty observed the significance of the growing temperance movement and opportunistically attempted to become a movement leader in the state.Giglio, H.M. Daugherty and the Politics of Expediency, pg. 84. Daugherty was himself a drinker but was not a man to let personal habits stand in the way of political possibility. As an Ohio Republican boss in 1920, Daugherty engineered Harding's ascendancy as the presidential nominee at that year's Republican National Convention in Chicago. The decision to propel Harding forward, if the nomination wasn't decided on the first ballot, was made in what became known in American politics as the smoke-filled room in the Blackstone Hotel. Harding won the nomination after the vote deadlocked between Leonard Wood and Frank Lowden, an event whose possibility Daugherty had suggested months before in an interview. Daugherty subsequently served as campaign manager for Harding in the presidential election of 1920. He ran the campaign based on Harding's affable personality and fairly neutral political stance, advocating a return to \\"normalcy\\" after World War I. =Attorney General of the United States= Following the resounding Republican victory in the fall of 1920, Daugherty was named Attorney General of the United States by President-elect Harding. Daugherty was confirmed by the Senate and assumed office on March 4, 1921.Mark Grossman, \\"Harry Micajah Daugherty (1860-1941),\\" in Political Corruption in America: An Encyclopedia of Scandals, Power, and Greed. Santa Barbara, CA: ABC-CLIO, 2003; pp. 91-93. =The \\"Ohio Gang\\"= Attorney General Harry M. Daugherty in his office. Having achieved power, Harding gathered around him a group of political cronies, including factional friends from the Ohio Republican establishment like Daugherty and others of like mind from other states, a group known colloquially as the \\"Ohio Gang.\\" Critics such as Harding's Secretary of Commerce Herbert Hoover viewed the clique with thinly disguised disgust: > [Harding] had another side which was not good. His political associates had > been men of the type of Albert B. Fall, whom he appointed Secretary of the > Interior; Daugherty, whom he appointed Attorney General; Forbes, whom he > appointed Director of the Veterans' Bureau; Thomas W.

New York: Macmillan, > 1952; pg. 48 Several of Harding's Ohio Gang associates lost no time enriching themselves at the public expense. Soon rumblings began to be heard over possible malfeasance in various government departments, including Daugherty's Department of Justice. C. H. Sykes Then on April 14, 1922, The Wall Street Journal broke a sensational story about a secret bribery scheme involving oil company kickbacks to government officials in exchange for the granting of extraordinarily favorable oil extraction leases via single-bid contracts.\\"Senate Investigates the 'Teapot Dome' Scandal,\\" United States Senate Historical Minutes, www.senate.gov/ The next day Democratic Senator John B. Kendrick of Wyoming introduced a resolution which set in motion the Senate investigation that would ultimately expose this so-called Teapot Dome scandal, involving an illegal financial relationship between Fall, Harding's Secretary of the Interior, and a subsidiary of the Sinclair Consolidated Oil Corporation. Daugherty was accused by opponents of the administration of having been complicit in the Teapot Dome affair by failing to intervene after he had learned of the malfeasance. A pair of special prosecutors ‚Äì Republican Assistant Attorney General Owen J. Roberts and former Democratic Senator Atlee Pomerene ‚Äì were appointed to conduct a more thorough investigation of the matter. After taking testimony on the matter the pair cleared Daugherty of wrongdoing, their final report indicating that the Attorney General had neither been aware of the fraudulent oil contracts nor had he taken any bribes related to the affair. This very specific absolution did not mean that all was on the level at the Justice Department, however. In July 1923, just as Harding was preparing to leave on a working cruise to Alaska, Daugherty's personal assistant, Jess Smith, suddenly committed suicide.Hoover, The Memoirs of Herbert Hoover: The Cabinet and the Presidency, 1920-1933, pp. 48-49. Although as a pious Quaker, Hoover was never part of the President's inner circle, yet was abruptly added to the traveling party on the cruise by a \\"nervous and distraught\\" Harding, who apparently sought his counsel.Hoover, The Memoirs of Herbert Hoover: The Cabinet and the Presidency, 1920-1933, pg. 49. Hoover later recalled: > One day after lunch when we were a few days out, Harding asked me to come to > his cabin. He plumped at me the question: \\"If you knew of a great scandal in > our administration, would you for the good of the country and the party > expose it publicly or would you bury it?\\" My natural reply was \\"Publish it, > and at least get credit for integrity on your side.\\" He remarked that this > method might be politically dangerous. I asked for more particulars. He said > that he had received some rumors of irregularities, centering around Smith, > in connection with cases in the Department of Justice. He had followed the > matter up and finally sent for Smith. After a painful session he told Smith > that he would be arrested in the morning. Smith went home, burned all his > papers, and committed suicide. Harding gave me no information about what > Smith had been up to. I asked what Daugherty's relations to the affair were. > He abruptly dried up and never raised the question again. Returning from his Alaskan trip Harding suffered the first heart attack in what would prove to be the beginning of his terminal last days, finally dying in San Francisco on August 2, 1923. Harding's death did nothing to quell the tide of emerging scandals revolving around his Ohio clique, with the news dominated by the story of Teapot Dome bribery and allegations of wrongdoing in the Office of the Alien Property Custodian, the Veterans' Bureau, and the Office of the Attorney General.Hoover, The Memoirs of Herbert Hoover: The Cabinet and the Presidency, 1920-1933, pg. 53. While new President Calvin Coolidge initially resisted calls to sack Daugherty, Hoover and Secretary of State Charles Evans Hughes prevailed upon him to eliminate a man whom they considered to be a corrupt official. In his memoirs Hoover remembered: > Coolidge was loath to believe that such things were possible. He greatly > delayed the removal of Daugherty from the Cabinet. From this man's long-time > character, he should never have been in any government.... Coolidge had a > high sense of justice and asserted that he had no definite knowledge of > wrongdoings by Daugherty and could not remove him on rumors. We urged that > Daugherty had lost the confidence of the whole country and himself should be > willing to retire for the good of public service.Hoover, The Memoirs of > Herbert Hoover: The Cabinet and the Presidency, 1920-1933, pg. 54. On March 28, 1924, Coolidge acquiesced, demanding and receiving a letter of resignation from Daugherty. He was quickly replaced as Attorney General by Harlan Fiske Stone, dean of the Columbia Law School. =American Metal Company affair= In 1926, Daugherty was indicted on charges that he improperly received funds in the sale of American Metal Company assets seized during World War I. The indictment came down one year after Smith, Republican political boss John T. King of Connecticut, and former Alien Property Custodian Thomas W. Miller were charged with the same misconduct. Daugherty's case went to trial twice, with the first jury deadlocking with 7-5 in favor of conviction. He was acquitted after a single juror remained unconvinced of his guilt in the second trial. =Later years, death, and legacy= Daugherty returned to practicing law until his retirement in 1932, and that year published, with ghostwriter Thomas Dixon, The Inside Story of the Harding Tragedy about his time in the Harding administration. In the book he claimed that Fall had become Secretary of the Interior by forging Daugherty's signature, and that Smith, his close friend, had killed himself because of diabetes, not a guilty conscience. Spending many of his final years in Florida and Mackinac Island, Michigan, Daugherty planned to write more books to clear his reputation, but in October 1940, he suffered two heart attacks and was stricken with pneumonia. Bedridden and blind in one eye during this last year, he died peacefully in his sleep with his son and daughter at his side on October 12, 1941. Daugherty was buried at Washington Cemetery in Washington Court House, Ohio.Marker #2-24 Harry M. Daugherty , Ohio Historical Society, 2003. Accessed 2013-05-22.

Built in 1886, it was the home of Manningham Rugby Football Club until 1903, when they changed code from rugby football to association football and became Bradford City. It has been Bradford City's home since, although it is now owned by former chairman Gordon Gibb's pension fund. It has also been home to Bradford (Park Avenue) for one season, and Bradford Bulls rugby league side for two seasons, as well as host to a number of England youth team fixtures. Football architect Archibald Leitch was commissioned to redevelop the ground when Bradford City were promoted to the First Division in 1908. The stadium underwent few changes until the fatal fire on 11 May 1985, when 56 supporters were killed and at least 265 were injured. It underwent a ¬£2.6 million redevelopment and was re-opened in December 1986. The ground underwent significant changes in the 1990s, and early 2000s, and now has a capacity of 25,136. The record attendance of 39,146 was set in 1911 for an FA Cup tie against Burnley, making it the oldest surviving attendance record at a Football League ground in the country. The highest attendance at Valley Parade, as it is now, was against Reading in the 2015 FA Cup Quarter-finals. History Manningham Rugby Football Club, formed in 1876, originally played games at Cardigan Fields, in the Carlisle Road area of Bradford. When their ground was sold to facilitate the construction of Drummond School, the club required a new home. Consequently, they bought one-third of the Valley Parade site in Manningham, taking a short-term lease out on the rest of the land in time to play there for the 1886‚Äì87 season. The new ground and the road it was built upon both adopted the name of the local area, Valley Parade, a name deriving from the steep hillside below Manningham. The land was previously a quarry, and formed part of a greater site owned by Midland Railway Company. The club spent ¬£1,400 appointing designers to oversee the excavation and levelling of the land, and moved a one-year-old stand from Carlisle Road to the highest part of the new ground. The original ground comprised the relocated stand, a 2,000-capacity stepped enclosure with the players' changing rooms beneath the stand, the playing area, a cinder athletics track and fencing to limit the total capacity to 18,000. The playing field was made of ballast, ashes, soil and sods. The ground was officially opened on 27 September 1886 for a game against Wakefield Trinity which was watched by a capacity crowd, but construction work meant most of Manningham's early games were away fixtures. On Christmas Day 1888, 12-year old Thomas Coyle was killed at the ground when the barrier under which he was sitting collapsed on him breaking his neck. An inquest decided the death was accidental and the accident happened due to the weight of spectators leaning on the barrier. The takings from the game totalling ¬£115 were distributed to Coyle's family and the families of other boys injured in the incident. The ground's current main stand Manningham RFC continued playing until 1903, when financial difficulties, caused by relegation at the turn of the century, prompted club officials to change codes from rugby football to association football. The first association football game to be played at Valley Parade was a promotional fixture on 6 April 1903 between a side of West Yorkshire footballers and Sheffield United's 1903 FA Cup winning side. The game had been organised to stimulate interest in the sport in Bradford and attracted 8,000 fans. The new football club, Bradford City, were elected to The Football League's Division Two the following month. Bradford City's first game at Valley Parade came on 5 September 1903 against Gainsborough Trinity, drawing a crowd of 11,000. As a result of alterations first implemented in 1897, City players originally changed in a shed behind one end of the ground, and visiting teams used the old rugby club dressing rooms at the back of the nearby Belle Vue Hotel. However, after City's 5‚Äì1 defeat by Manchester United on 10 February 1906, United player Bob Bonthron was attacked as he left the ground. As a result, The Football Association closed the ground for 14 days, ordering City to switch its changing rooms to the nearby Artillery Barracks for the 1906‚Äì07 season. Several supporters faced criminal proceedings for the incident. The concrete Midland Road stand for Bradford City Football Club nearing completion in 1908.\\"Reinforced Concrete Football Stand at Bradford\\", Concrete and Constructional Engineering, Vol. V., No. 1, January 1910, pp. 16-22. After Bradford City won the Division Two championship in 1907‚Äì08, the club hurried through a reconstruction programme of the ground to prepare for the club's first season in Division One. Football architect Archibald Leitch was commissioned to design new terracing in the paddock‚Äîa standing area in front of the 5,300-seater main stand which was built in 1908‚Äîand build a Spion Kop at the north side of the ground and an 8,000-capacity stand at the Midland Road end opposite the main stand. Further work was performed to lower the railings, erect barriers, move the pitch and add extra turnstiles. The changing rooms were also moved, with a tunnel leading from the rooms underneath the Kop along the main stand side of the ground. The total project cost ¬£9,958, and raised the capacity to 40,000. The work was not completed until midway through the 1908‚Äì09 season. The first match after work was finished took place on Christmas Day 1908, when 36,000 fans saw City host Bristol City. The improvements allowed Bradford City to set their record attendance of 39,146 on 11 March 1911 against Burnley during the club's FA Cup winning run. It is the longest surviving attendance record at any league ground in the country. The Midland Road stand On 17 March 1932, Bradford City paid Midland Railway Company ¬£3,750 for the remaining two-thirds of the site to become outright owners of the ground, which was now 45 years old. The stadium had remained virtually unchanged since 1908, and did so until 1952, when the capacity of the ground was reduced after examinations of the foundations were ordered following the 1946 Burnden Park disaster. The investigation resulted in the closure of half the Midland Road stand. The stand's steel frame was then sold to Berwick Rangers for ¬£450 and a smaller replacement stand was built at Valley Parade in 1954. Six years later, the stand had to be demolished for a second time because of continuing foundation problems. It was another six years before all four stands at Valley Parade were able to be opened for the first time. To enable construction of a new stand on the Midland Road side of the ground, the club directors moved the pitch closer to the main stand. The new stand was then the narrowest stand in the league. Further improvements were made to the stand in 1969, ready for the club's FA Cup tie with Division One side Tottenham Hotspur on 3 January 1970, which ended in a 2‚Äì2 draw in front of 23,000 fans. The cost of the work forced the club to sell Valley Parade to Bradford Corporation for ¬£35,000, but it was bought back by 1979 for the same price. During the period from 1908 to 1985, the club carried out a number of other lesser work to the rest of the ground. It also included the introduction of floodlights in English football. Valley Parade's first floodlights cost ¬£3,000 and were lamps mounted on telegraph poles running along each side of the ground. They were originally used against Hull City on 20 December 1954. The floodlights were replaced in 1960 and again used for the first time against Hull City, but when one fell over in 1962, an FA Cup game with Gateshead had to go ahead with only three pylons, prompting an FA inquiry. In 1985, football ground writer Simon Inglis described the view from the main stand, which was still the same as when it was developed in 1908, as \\"like watching football from the cockpit of a Sopwith Camel\\" because of its antiquated supports and struts. fire, but before further work at the end of that decade On 11 May 1985, one of the worst sporting disasters occurred at Valley Parade, 56 people died and at least 265 were injured when the main stand was engulfed by fire. The fire started 40 minutes into the club's final game of the 1984‚Äì85 season against Lincoln City and destroyed the main stand in just nine minutes. For the next season and the first five months of the 1986‚Äì87 season, Bradford City played home games at Leeds United's Elland Road, Huddersfield Town's Leeds Road and Bradford Northern's Odsal Stadium, while Valley Parade was rebuilt. Huddersfield-based firm J Wimpenny carried out the ¬£2.6 million work, which included funding from insurance pay- outs, Football League stadium grants, club funds and a ¬£1.46 million Government loan obtained by two Bradford MPs, Geoffrey Lawler and Max Madden. A new 5,000 all-seater main stand was built, longer than the structure which had burned down. The Kop was also covered for the first time and increased to a 7,000 capacity. Other minor work was carried out to the ground's other two stands. On 14 December 1986, 582 days after the fire, The Hon Sir Oliver Popplewell, who had conducted the inquiry into the fire, opened the new stadium before an exhibition match against an England international XI. It was first used for a league game on Boxing Day when City lost 1‚Äì0 to Derby County. A view of the main stand from the Bradford end of the ground The two stands which were not altered after the fire were both improved during the 1990s. The Bradford end of the ground was made a double-decker, all-seater stand, with a new scoreboard, in 1991. City's promotion to Division One in 1996 meant that chairman Geoffrey Richmond announced the construction of a 4,500 seater stand on the Midland Road side. It was first used for a Yorkshire derby against Sheffield United on Boxing Day 1996, before being officially opened by Queen Elizabeth II on 27 March 1997. Richmond continued his plans to redevelop the ground as City continued to rise through the league. The roof of the Kop, which was the largest safe-standing terrace in the country at the time, was removed and the capacity reduced during City's 1998‚Äì99 promotion season, to prepare for a summer ¬£6.5 million rebuilding programme. The Kop was converted into a two-tier 7,500-seat capacity stand. An additional 2,300-seat capacity corner section was built, which filled in the corner between the main stand and Kop. When opened in December 2000 it took the capacity of Valley Parade to more than 20,000 for the first time since 1970. A suite of offices and a shop were added at the same time. Once the work was completed, a second tier was added to the main stand at the cost of ¬£6.5 million. It was opened in 2001, increasing the main stand's capacity to 11,000, and the ground's capacity to 25,000. Richmond also planned to increase the main stand's capacity by a further 1,800 seats by building new changing rooms and office blocks, and add a second tier to the Midland Road stand, to increase the ground capacity to more than 35,000. However, the club went into administration in May 2002, and Richmond was replaced by new co-owners Julian Rhodes and Gordon Gibb. The following year, Valley Parade was sold to Gibb's pension fund for ¬£5 million, with the club's offices, shop and car park sold to London-based Development Securities for an additional ¬£2.5 million. Bradford City's annual rent bill in 2011 to Gibb's pension fund is ¬£370,000. The total budget for the year, including other rent payments, rates, maintenance and utility bills is ¬£1.25 million. The ground has been renamed a number of times for sponsorship reasons. Sponsors have included The Pulse radio station, Bradford & Bingley, Intersonic and Coral Windows. The ground was renamed due to sponsorship as the Northern Commercials Stadium in July 2016 but was still commonly known throughout football as Valley Parade. In July 2019 it was re-sponsored and renamed the Utilita Energy Stadium. Structure and facilities The Kop, formerly known as the Carlsberg stand The stadium is divided into five all- seater stands, the JCT600 Stand, the Kop, the Midland Road Stand, the North West Corner and the TL Dallas Stand. All five stands are covered except for a small part of the main stand, and all but the Midland Road Stand being two- tiered. Most of the stands are cantilever structures, and because of the ground's location on the hillside, the Midland Road Stand overhangs the road. Many of the stands have more traditional names, but have since been renamed because of sponsorship deals. The JCT600 Stand is the ground's main stand, and is often called the latter by fans, but is also known as the Sunwin stand owing to the former sponsor. The Kop, was the former standing area, and its name was derived, like at many stadia across the country, from the Battle of Spion Kop. The East Stand, sponsored by Northern Commercials, is also named the Midland Road stand, because of the road on that side of the ground. The TL Dallas Stand is also known as the Bradford end, because it is nearest to the city centre. The total capacity of Valley Parade is 25,136. The largest stand is the JCT600 Stand, which holds 9,004 supporters, followed by the Kop, which has a capacity of 7,492. The Midland Road Stand holds 4,500, and the North West Corner 2,300. The TL Dallas Stand is the smallest of the five stands with a capacity of 1,840. The stadium includes 134 seats for media representatives. The Sunwin Stand has further room for expansion, and is unusual because it only runs three-quarters of the length of the pitch. The rest of this side is taken up by a brick building, situated in the south west corner of the stadium, which houses the club changing rooms and the security offices. The Sunwin Stand also includes the ground's 17 executive boxes and conference facilities, which have capacity for up to 700 people. A second function room, called the Bantams Bar, in the Kop, has room for another 300 people. There is also more office space, a club store, ticket office and museum in the car park behind the Kop. From early 2010, the area near the store will also include a dental surgery, which will be run by NHS Bradford and Airedale in partnership with the football club. Visiting team fans sat in the TL Dallas Stand from 1995 to 2008, but have also been given other parts of the ground for larger matches. In March 2008, the club announced that the TL Dallas Stand would be made available for home fans for the 2008‚Äì09 season. The decision came after an overwhelmingly positive text message poll from the club's supporters to use the Bradford End of the ground. Visiting team fans have been accommodated in the end blocks of the East Stand since the start of the 2008‚Äì09 season. Fire disaster A memorial, erected on the club's main stand, to the victims of the fire in 1985 A memorial in Bradford city centre On 11 May 1985, a crowd of 11,076 attended Bradford City's final Division Three game of the 1984‚Äì85 season against Lincoln City. The Bradford side had secured the Division Three title the week before when they defeated Bolton Wanderers 2‚Äì0. The league trophy was presented to City's skipper Peter Jackson before the Lincoln game. The score was still 0‚Äì0 after 40 minutes of the game, when a small fire was noticed three rows from the back near one end of the main stand. The flames became more visible within minutes, and police started to evacuate people in the stand less than six minutes later. Club chairman Stafford Heginbotham, who was in the main stand, described the effect and his reaction to the disaster: \\"The fire just spread along the length of the stand in seconds. The smoke was choking. We couldn't breathe. It was to be our day.\\" The game was stopped, and the wooden roof caught fire. The fire spread the length of the stand, and timber and the roof began to fall onto the crowds. Black smoke enveloped the rear passageways, where fans were trying to escape. Ultimately, the fire killed 56 spectators, ranging from 11-year-old children to the 86-year-old former chairman of the club, Sam Firth. At least 265 further supporters were injured. The few existing narrow escape routes led to locked doors in some cases, and the only escape for most spectators was directly onto the field. The match was abandoned and never replayed, with The Football League ordering the scoreline at the time of abandonment to stand. Sir Oliver Popplewell published his inquiry into the fire in 1986, which introduced new safety legislation for sports grounds across the country. Forensic scientist David Woolley believed the cause of the fire was from a discarded cigarette or match, which had dropped through gaps between the seating to a void below the stand where rubbish had built up. A number of police officers and 22 spectators were later awarded bravery awards for their deeds on the day. The old wooden roof of the stand was due to be replaced the day after the Lincoln match, because it did not meet the safety regulations required for Division Two, where the team would be playing in the following season. Instead, it took until July 1986 for rebuilding work to begin. The ground was used for reserve team fixtures from September 1985, but only journalists and club officials were present to watch. Bradford City's senior team played home games at other grounds in West Yorkshire for 19 months while Valley Parade was rebuilt. The new ground cost ¬£2.6 million (¬£ million today) to rebuild, and was reopened in December 1986. More than ¬£3.5 million (¬£ million today) was raised for victims of the fire and their families through the Bradford Disaster Appeal Fund. Memorials have been erected at the ground and at Bradford City Hall, the latter of which was provided by Bradford's twin town of Hamm, in Germany. The disaster is also marked by an annual remembrance ceremony on 11 May at Bradford City Hall, and an annual Easter-weekend youth tournament, contested between Bradford, Lincoln and other teams from across Europe. Other uses Valley Parade hosted its first international football game just two months after its first Football League match. The game's governing bodies wanted to promote the sport in the West Riding of Yorkshire, so chose Valley Parade to host a game between an English League side and an Irish League side, despite the ground not being up to standard. An estimated 20,000 spectators attended the match on 10 October 1903, which the English League won 2‚Äì1. Over the next 20 years the ground hosted a number of other representative games, including an England international trial, the 1904 FA Amateur Cup Final and an under-15s schoolboy international between England and Scotland. But it was not until 6 April 1987 that the ground hosted another international when England under-18s drew 1‚Äì1 with Switzerland. Other under-18 fixtures have been played since, the last of which was between England and Belgium in November 2000. It hosted two England under-21 international friendlies. The first was against Denmark's under-21s on 8 October 1999. The hosts thrashed the visitors 4‚Äì1. The other was against Italy's under-21s 26 March 2002. it ended in a 1 - 1 draw with 21,642 in attendance.

The highest league attendance of 37,059, was for a Bradford derby match between Bradford City and Bradford (Park Avenue) on 17 September 1927 in Division Three (North). The record attendance since the Valley Parade grounds were rebuilt in 1986 (all- seated attendance) is 24,321, set on 7 March 2015 in the 2015 FA Cup Quarter- finals draw against Reading, surpassing the previous record of 23,971, set on 10 December 2012 in the club's 2012‚Äì13 Football League Cup Quarter-finals victory over Arsenal. The lowest attendance for a league home match at Valley Parade is 1,249, on 15 May 1981, for a Division Four fixture with Hereford United. The record gate receipts that Bradford City have received are ¬£181,990 for the Premier League game with Manchester United on 13 January 2001. Official attendance figures for league games were not kept by The Football League until 1925. City's official highest average attendance at Valley Parade since then is 18,551 for the 1928‚Äì29 promotion season from Division Three (North), although the club reported an average of 22,585 in 1920‚Äì21.

Transport Bradford is served by two railway stations. They are Bradford Interchange, which is also the city's main bus terminus, and away from the ground, and Bradford Forster Square, which is away from the ground. Bradford Interchange connects to Leeds railway station for London North Eastern Railway and CrossCountry train services, Grand Central provide a direct service to London, and provides First Bradford and Keighley Bus Company buses to the ground. Forster Square, which provides train services operated by Northern, also connects to Leeds. The stadium has no parking facilities available to supporters on matchdays. In 2000, as part of the expansion of Valley Parade, the club drew up a green transport plan in a bid to ease traffic congestion around the ground. Proposals included a new railway station on the line between Leeds and Bradford Forster Square, and a discounted bus service. No station has ever been built, and a discounted bus route was withdrawn because of low patronage. References External links * Bradford City A.F.C. Bradford (Park Avenue) A.F.C.

It won the 1980 Locus Award for Best Science Fiction Novel and was nominated for both the Nebula Award for Best Novel in 1979, and the Hugo Award for Best Novel in 1980. Plot A scientific expedition to the planet Saturn in 2025, aboard the ship Ringmaster, discovers a strange satellite in orbit around the planet. Commanding the ship is Cirocco Jones, a tall NASA career woman, aided by astronomer Gaby Plauget, the clone twin physicists April and August Polo, pilot Eugene Springfield, physician Calvin Greene and engineer Bill (whose last name is never given). As they reach the satellite they realize it is a huge hollow torus, a Stanford torus habitat. Before they can report this the ship is entangled in cables from the object. The crew is rendered unconscious and later wake up inside the habitat. Initially separated, Cirroco and Gaby find each other and travel together through the world inside the torus to find the rest of the crew. As the story progresses, they find Calvin living as a companion inside a Blimp, an intelligent gasbag a kilometer long, one of many that swim forever in the air inside the habitat. Calvin can speak to the blimp and understand its responses, which consist of whistles. His blimp's name is Whistlestop, in human terms. Calvin helps Gaby and Cirocco find the other crew members (except April). He ultimately decides to leave his human companions to live with the blimp permanently. The remaining companions encounter the Titanides, strange centaur-like beings who speak a language based on music. Cirocco finds she has the ability to speak their language. The Titanides are in a perpetual state of war with the Angels, birdlike humanoid creatures. They fight because of an impulse that occurs when they are near each other, but do not know why they have the impulse. The humans learn from the Titanides that there is a controlling intelligence, called Gaea, and it lives 600 km above them, in the hub of the torus. Cirocco, Gaby, and Gene decide to climb up to this place using the support cables that maintain the structure against centrifugal force. During the journey, Gene's behavior becomes increasingly erratic. He rapes Gaby and then rapes Cirocco. He thinks he killed Gaby while he gives chase to Cirocco only Gaby is not dead and eventually cuts his ear off with a hatchet. After he passes out Gaby destroys his face. They get rid of him and keep going. Months of climbing brings them high in one of the spokes of the great wheel. There they find April, who has been transformed into an angel. She, like the other Angels, is solitary by nature, and can hardly bear to be near them. Finally reaching the hub, they discover Gaea, who presents herself as a frumpy middle aged woman. She explains that the great wheel is very old, and some of the regional intelligences around the rim have rebelled against the center. It was, in fact, one of these regional intelligences that had captured the Ringmaster and altered its crew. Gaea rescued them and, unable to change them back, placed them where they would be happy. She makes an offer to Cirocco: in exchange for long life and unusual abilities, she can be Gaea's agent at the Rim, her Wizard. Cirocco accepts, with the condition that the war between the Titanides and Angels must stop. Gaea's personality is that of a movie addict. She has been watching television signals from Earth and is obsessed by movies, especially from Hollywood's Golden Age. The Titanide-Angel war was the result of her having seen war movies, and realizing that humanity will inevitably declare war on her. The war is a way for her to practice.

Marisa is considered by Rolling Stone Brasil to be the second greatest singer, behind only Elis Regina. She also has two albums (MM and Verde, Anil, Amarelo, Cor-de-Rosa e Carv√£o) on the list of the 100 best albums of Brazilian music. Biography Monte was born in Rio de Janeiro, daughter of the engineer Carlos Saboia Monte and Sylvia Marques de Azevedo Monte. On her father's side, she is descended from the Saboias, one of the oldest Italian families in Brazil. She studied singing, piano, and drums as a child, and began studying opera singing at 14. After failing to break through into 1980s Brazilian pop rock she went into semi-exile in Italy, where she met the famous producer Nelson Motta. Thereafter she became a hybrid of MPB diva and pop rock performer. While most of her music is in the style of modern MPB, she has also recorded traditional samba and folk tunes, largely in collaboration with such musicians and songwriters as Carlinhos Brown, Arnaldo Antunes, and Nando Reis and producer Arto Lindsay. She has also collaborated with the New York pop music vanguard, including Laurie Anderson, David Byrne, Marc Ribot, Bernie Worrell and Philip Glass. =1987‚Äì1990: Beginnings and first album= Aged 19, she moved to Rome, where she studied bel canto for 10 months. After that, she began appearing in bars and nightclubs singing Brazilian music, accompanied by friends. One of these shows was attended by the producer Nelson Motta, who directed her first show in Rio de Janeiro upon her return. The Veludo Azul show had seasons in Rio and S√£o Paulo, and caught the attention of record companies. Monte was invited to record her first special by the television program TV Manchete, which was called MM, and released on LP and VHS. Her first big hit appeared on this album, \\"Bem Que Se Quis\\" (the Nelson Motta version for the Italian composer Pino Daniele's \\"E Po' Che Fa\\"). Her hit was played exhaustively on Brazilian radio stations, and was included on the soundtrack of Lauro C√©sar Muniz's soap opera O Salvador de P√°tria on the Globo network (1989). The soundtrack sold 500 thousand copies and is No. 62 on the list of 100 greatest Brazilian music albums. =1991‚Äì1996: Artistic development= In 1991, Marisa Monte released her second album, titled Mais, on EMI.

In 1994, she released her third album, Verde, Anil, Amarelo, Cor-de-Rosa e Carv√£o. This album is on the list of the 100 best albums of Brazilian music, in position No. 87. =2000‚Äì2001: Consolidated musical career= In 2000, she released Mem√≥rias, Cr√¥nicas, e Declarac√µes de Amor, which was followed by a DVD of the same name in 2001, being a recording of her performances over three nights at the ATL Hall, in Rio de Janeiro. In 2011, she contributed a collaboration with Devendra Banhart and Rodrigo Amarante \\"N√∫ Com A Minha M√∫sica\\" (\\"Naked with My Music\\") for the Red Hot Organization's most recent charitable album Red Hot+Rio 2, a follow-up to the 1996 Red Hot+Rio.

These medieval land terms include the following: * a burgage, a plot of land rented from a lord or king * a hide: the hide, from the Anglo-Saxon word meaning \\"family\\", was, in the early medieval period, a land-holding that was considered sufficient to support a family. This was equivalent to 60 to 120 old acres (approximately ) depending on the quality of the land. The hide was the basis for the assessment of taxes. The hide was not ubiquitous in Anglo-Saxon England, with, for example, land in Kent being assessed in sulungs (approximately twice the size of the average hide). * a Knight's fee: is the amount of land for which the services of a knight (for 40 days) were due to the Crown. It was determined by land value, and the number of hides in a Knight's Fee varied. * a hundred: a division of an English shire consisting of 100 hides. The hundreds of Stoke, Desborough and Burnham in Buckinghamshire are known as the Chiltern Hundreds. * a franconian Lan used in Poland since the 13th century, consisted of 43.2 morgs = 23 to 28 hectares. The term Lan was also used to indicate a full-sized farm, as opposed to one split up into a number of smaller sections. * a wapentake: a subdivision of a county used in Yorkshire and other areas of strong Danish influence. It is similar to hundred or a ward. It was used in Yorkshire, Lincolnshire, Nottinghamshire, Derbyshire, Leicestershire and Rutland. * a shire was originally a type of a subdivision of a county; some shires evolved into administrative areas equivalent to a county; a shire was headed by a shire reeve (becoming sheriff, in Saskatchewan the mayor of a rural municipality is a reeve); shires were most commonly subdivided into hundreds, but other types of subdivisions were also made * a rape: Sussex was divided into six rapes, which were intermediate divisions between the county and the hundred. A rape was to have its own river, forest and castle. * a lathe: Kent was divided into five lathes, from the Old English laeth, meaning district. * a riding: was a division of land in Yorkshire and in Lindsey, which was the northern part of modern day Lincolnshire. The riding was a third part of the shire. The name is derived from the Old Norse , meaning \\"one-third\\". * a ward: a ward is a subdivision of a county, equivalent to a wapentake or a hundred. It was used in Northumberland, Cumberland, Westmorland, and Durham.

Despite his lack of volubility, he rises steadily into the ranks of the TCS Tiger's Claw, eventually leading his flight wing to numerous successes in the Vega Sector campaign, Operation Thor's Hammer and the Firekkan campaign, eventually reaching the rank of lieutenant colonel and being awarded numerous medals, including the Terran Confederation Medal of Honor. When the Claw moves into the K'tithrak Mang sector to deal with a Kilrathi command post, however, his number comes up: with the sole exception of a few pilots who had been transferred to other ships, and Blair himself who is out on patrol, the Claw is lost with all hands; no one can confirm how. Blair's flight data recorder picks up odd signals that appear to be Kilrathi fighters with cloaking devices, but it is stolen when he lands on the TCS Austin. Admiral Geoffrey Tolwyn believes that Blair is lying to cover his own treachery, finds him guilty of negligence (due to lack of evidence), demotes him to captain and exiles him to the backwater Caernavon Station. Blair is widely branded the \\"Coward of K'tithrak Mang\\" and reviled throughout the Terran Confederation. Ten years later, in Wing Commander II: Vengeance of the Kilrathi, Blair is still on Caernavon, but when the TCS Concordia, Tolwyn's new flagship, jumps in-system and is ambushed, Blair singlehandedly rescues it. Cognizant of the need to keep the best pilots on the front lines, Tolwyn reluctantly shifts Blair to active service aboard the Concordia, where he serves alongside a number of old friends from the Claw: Jeannette \\"Angel\\" Devereaux, Mariko \\"Spirit\\" Tanaka, Etienne \\"Doomsday\\" Montclair, defected Kilrathi pilot Ralgha \\"Hobbes\\" nar Hhallas and Zack \\"Jazz\\" Colson. New to the roster is Dirk \\"Stingray\\" Wright, enthusiastic and brash. James \\"Paladin\\" Taggart drops in on occasion, but Todd \\"Maniac\\" Marshall is far away doing testing on Morningstar-class heavy fighters. To dampen the mood, however, a saboteur is on the Concordia, committing terrorist acts and assassinating Confed personnel. In his time aboard the Concordia, Blair is able to finally record incontrovertible evidence of the Kilrathi Strakha stealth fighters, uncover and defeat the traitor (\\"Jazz\\" Colson), destroy the K'Tithrak Mang HQ and avenge the Tiger's Claw, and start a romantic liaison with Angel. He is also promoted to the rank of colonel by a grudgingly respectful Tolwyn. More ominously, he gains the personal attention of Kilrathi Crown Prince Thrakhath nar Kiranka; he is eventually given the Kilrathi warrior name \\"Heart of the Tiger\\". Blair subsequently becomes involved in a number of Secret Ops projects, including the TCS Gettysburg mutiny, the defection of four Kilrathi planets to the Confederation, the testing of the new Morningstar heavy fighter and deployment of the Crossbow prototype bomber, and the destruction of the traitorous Society of Mandarins (culminating in Maverick finally defeating and killing Jazz in single combat). He fights at the Battle of Earth and is grounded with injuries for six months, during which time the Kilrathi push the Confederation to the wall. He resumes active duty just in time for Wing Commander III: Heart of the Tiger to start. With the Concordia lost in the Vespus system and his lover, Angel gone MIA, Blair (now portrayed by Mark Hamill) is assigned to the TCS Victory, a carrier twice as old as he is (late 30s) and being kept to the rear lines of the war. Despite the relatively unglamorous nature of his assignment, Blair, along with his wing of pilots including top aces Hobbes and Maniac, is able to provide at least some defense for the TCS Behemoth before its destruction at the hands of a traitor. It is from this point that Blair discovers what truly happened to Angel through a holographic recording. An unstable and vengeful Blair then leads a wing that is responsible for delivering the Temblor Bomb on the Kilrathi home planet, resulting in the death of the Emperor, as well as Prince Thrakhath (engaged and defeated by Blair in the planet's atmosphere) and is able to avenge Angel. The destruction of Kilrah leads to the surrender of the Kilrathi and the signing of a permanent peace treaty, ending the 40-year Terran-Kilrathi War. Blair is now entitled to add a new label to his roster: \\"Savior of the Confederation\\". After the war, Blair attempts to return to his roots on Nephele II and become a farmer. Tolwyn reactivates him at the start of Wing Commander IV: The Price of Freedom however, to investigate allegations that the Union of Border Worlds has been causing trouble for Confed shipping (claims that Confed is doing the same thing to Border Worlds shipping are ignored). A third faction is eventually implicated, and Blair succeeds in uncovering it, though he is forced to defect to the Union of Border Worlds to do so, since the faction appears to be supported by elements within Confed. This so-called \\"Black Lance Affair\\" results in the disgrace and suicide of Space Marshal Tolwyn. Blair remains in the military for the rest of his life, though he accepts a transfer from Space Forces to Navy. He is the architect and main proponent of the 'mega-carrier' plan, and is aboard the TCS Midway, the first of the new class, on its maiden voyage, detailed in Wing Commander: Prophecy. When the ship unexpectedly encounters invaders from another part of the galaxy (codenamed \\"Nephilim\\"), the Midway single-handedly beats them back, mostly led by player character Lieutenant Lance Casey. Commodore Blair is, unfortunately, lost in the action against the Nephilim, missing and presumed dead on a critical mission to assist Casey in destroying the aliens' galaxy- invading wormhole. =In other media= Mark Hamill also voiced Blair in the Wing Commander Academy animated series. In the 1999 live-action film Wing Commander, Blair was portrayed by actor Freddie Prinze, Jr. This version of Blair was a \\"Pilgrim\\" who possessed a superhuman space navigation ability. He was also on much friendlier terms with Admiral Tolwyn. Blair appears in the following Wing Commander novels: Wing Commander: Heart of the Tiger (WCIII game novelization), Wing Commander: The Price of Freedom (WCIV game novelization), Wing Commander (movie novelization), Wing Commander: Pilgrim Stars (sequel to the movie novel; Blair chooses the callsign \\"Pilgrim\\" by novel's end), Wing Commander: Pilgrim Truth (third novel based upon the movie), and Wing Commander: End Run (in this novel his callsign is \\"Phoenix\\"). Reception The character was very well received and was during the series' heydey he has been widely regarded as one of the best in gaming at the time.

The Ems Ukaz or Ems Ukase (; ), was a secret decree (ukaz) of Tsar Alexander II of Russia issued in 1876, banning the use of the Ukrainian language in print, with the exception of reprinting of old documents. The ukaz also forbade the import of Ukrainian publications and the staging of plays or lectures in Ukrainian. It was named after the city of Bad Ems, Germany, where it was promulgated.  Background  In the 1860s, a decade and a half after the Imperial Russian government had broken up the Brotherhood of Sts Cyril and Methodius in Kiev (March 1847), and exiled or arrested its founder Nikolay Kostomarov and other prominent figures, Ukrainian intellectuals were gaining further awareness of their cultural background. Hromada cultural associations (named after the traditional village assembly) started in a number of cities, and Sunday schools started in the cities and towns (the Russian Imperial administration had neglected education). The new cultural movement was partly driven by publications in both Russian and Ukrainian, including journals (such as Kostomarov's Osnova, 1861‚Äì62, and Hlibov's Chernyhosvs‚Äôkyy Lystok, 1861‚Äì63), historical and folkloristic monographs (Kostomarov's biography of the Cossack hetman Bohdan Khmelnytsky, Kulish's two-volume folklore collection Zapiski o Yuzhnoy Rusi, Notes on Southern Rus', 1856‚Äì57), and elementary primers (Kulish's Hramatka, 1857, 1861, Shevchenko's Bukvar Yuzhnoruskiy, 1861 ). In Osnova, Kostomarov published his influential article \\"Dve russkiye narodnosti\\" (\\"Two Russian Nationalities\\"). Although Ukrainianism had been considered popular and somewhat chic in Russian cultural circles, a debate began at the time over its relation to the ideology of Russian Pan-Slavism‚Äîepitomized by a quotation of Pushkin: \\"will not all the Slavic streams merge into the Russian sea?\\"‚Äîand a rhetoric of criticism emerged. Conservative Russians called the Ukrainian movement a \\"Polish intrigue\\", while Polish commentators had been complaining that Ukrainianism had been used as a weapon against Polish culture in right- bank Ukraine. After the 1861 emancipation of the serfs in the Russian Empire, many landowners were unhappy with the loss of their serfs, while peasants were generally displeased with the terms of the emancipation. In this atmosphere of discontent, increasing reports reached the imperial government that Ukrainian leaders were plotting to separate from Russia. The 1863 January Uprising in Poland raised tensions around the issue of ethnic separatism in general even further. Several Ukrainian activists were arrested, Sunday schools and hromadas were closed and their publication activities were suspended. A new Ukrainian translation by Pylyp Morachevskyi of parts of the New Testament was vetted and passed by the Imperial Academy of Sciences, but rejected by the Holy Synod of the Russian Orthodox church, because it was considered politically suspect. Volodymyr Kozyrsky, Vasyl Shenderovsky, \\"The spiritual valour of Pylyp Morachevsky (to the bicentenary anniversary of his birth)\\", Zerkalo Nedeli (the Mirror Weekly), 5‚Äì19 August 2006, in Russian, in Ukrainian . In response, Interior Minister Count Pyotr Valuyev issued a decree through an internal document circulated to the censors on 18 July 1863, known as Valuyev's Circular. The Circular implemented a policy based on the opinion of the Kiev Censorship Committee cited in the Circular, that \\"the Ukrainian language never existed, does not exist, and shall never exist\\". It banned the publication of secular and religious books (apart from belles-lettres), on the premise that the distribution of such publications was a tool for fostering separatist tendencies, coming primarily from Poland.  Ems Ukaz  In the 1870s, the Kiev Hromada and the South-Western Branch of the Imperial Russian Geographic Society began to publish important works in Kiev, in Russian, about Ukrainian ethnography. Authors included Mykhailo Drahomanov, Volodymyr Antonovych, Ivan Rudchenko, and Pavlo Chubynsky. They held an Archaeological Congress in 1874, and published in the Russian-language paper Kievskiy telegraf. A member of the Geographic Society, Mikhail Yuzefovich, sent two letters to St Petersburg warning of separatist activity. Tsar Alexander II appointed an Imperial Commission on Ukrainophile Propaganda in the Southern Provinces of Russia, which found evidence of a danger to the state, and recommended extending the scope of the Valuyev decree. While enjoying a spa in Bad Ems, Germany, in May 1876, the Tsar signed what would come to be called the \\"Ems Ukaz\\", extending the publication ban to apply to all books and song lyrics in the \\"Little Russian dialect\\", and to prohibit the importation of such materials. Public lectures, plays, and song performances in Ukrainian were forbidden, suspect teachers removed from teaching, and presumably dangerous organizations and newspapers shut down. The ukaz coincided with other actions against Ukrainian culture. Drahomanov and fellow activist Mykola Ziber were sacked from their posts at Kiev's University of St Vladimir, and emigrated along with other cultural leaders such as Fedir Vovk and Serhiy Podolynsky. The situation was exposed by professor Mykhailo Drahomanov at the 1878 Paris International Literary Congress. = Yaryzhka = In 1881, the new Tsar Alexander III amended the ukaz. Ukrainian lyrics and dictionaries would be allowed, but the Kulishivka Ukrainian alphabet was still prohibited, and such publications would have to write Ukrainian with Russian orthography. This usage was disparagingly called the Yaryzhka (, ) by some Ukrainians in reference to the Russian letter yery . Performance of Ukrainian plays and humorous songs could be approved by local authorities, but Ukrainian-only theatres and troupes could not be established. Many illegal performances and publications were delivered through ingenuity and bribery, but Ukrainian cultural development practically ceased.  Aftermath  After the Russian Revolution of 1905, the Imperial Academy of Sciences recommended that the ukaz's restrictions be lifted. Ukrainian-language newspapers began publication, Prosvita (‚ÄòEnlightenment‚Äô) educational societies were formed, some university professors lectured in Ukrainian, and the Orthodox bishop of the Podolia vicariate, Parfeniy Levytsky, allowed the language to be used in services and church schools there. In 1910, concerned about potential revolutionary activity, Interior Minister Pyotr Stolypin restored the ukaz's restrictions and shut down the Prosvita societies and Ukrainian-language publications. Russian-language press and intellectuals launched a campaign against the idea of Ukrainian autonomy or separatism. Thus, self-aware Ukrainians remained a small intelligentsia in Dnieper Ukraine, out of touch with a much larger rural population who lacked the opportunity for a cultural education. Russian imperial ideology dominated the schools and the army, and the Russian language was the only one used for official business in the urban workplace, government offices, and public services. In the meantime, Ukrainian self-identity would grow in Austro-Hungarian Galicia, out of reach of Russian imperial authorities. The ukaz was never cancelled, but became void along with all other imperial Russian laws in the February Revolution of 1917‚Äì18. After the Revolution, Ukrainian language, education and culture was allowed to flower in the Ukrainian National Republic, the Hetmanate, and under the Ukrainization policies of Soviet Ukraine before 1931.

Sahl pioneered a style of social satire which pokes fun at political and current event topics using improvised monologues and only a newspaper as a prop. Sahl spent his early years in Los Angeles and moved to the San Francisco Bay Area where he made his professional stage debut at the hungry i nightclub in 1953. His popularity grew quickly, and after a year at the club he traveled the country doing shows at established nightclubs, theaters and college campuses. In 1960 he became the first comedian to have a cover story written about him by Time magazine. He appeared on various television shows, played a number of film roles, and performed a one-man show on Broadway. Television host Steve Allen claimed that Sahl was \\"the only real political philosopher we have in modern comedy.\\" His social satire performances broke new ground in live entertainment, as a stand-up comic talking about the real world of politics at that time was considered \\"revolutionary.\\" It inspired many later comics to become stage comedians, including Lenny Bruce, Jonathan Winters, George Carlin and Woody Allen. Allen credits Sahl's new style of humor with \\"opening up vistas for people like me.\\" Numerous politicians became his fans, with John F. Kennedy asking him to write his jokes for campaign speeches. After Kennedy's assassination in 1963, however, Sahl became obsessed with the Warren Report's inaccuracies and conclusions, and spoke about it often during his shows. This alienated much of his audience and led to a decline in his popularity for the remainder of the 1960s. By the 1970s, however, his shows and popularity staged a partial comeback which continues to the present.\\"Mort Sahl invented stand-up comedy ‚Äî so what‚Äôs he doing at a community theatre in Northern California?\\", National Post, May 25, 2015 A biography of Sahl, Last Man Standing, by James Curtis, was released in 2017.\\"Comedian Mort Sahl and biographer James Curtis talk about ‚ÄòLast Man Standing,‚Äô the story of Sahl‚Äôs fearless, funny life\\", Orange County Register, June 2, 2017 Early life and education Sahl was born on May 11, 1927, in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, the only child of Jewish parents. His father, Harry Sahl, came from an immigrant family on New York's Lower East Side, and hoped to become a Broadway playwright. He met his wife when she responded to an advertisement he took out in a poetry magazine. Unable to break into the writing field they moved to Canada where he owned a tobacco store in Montreal.Time magazine, August 15, 1960, pp. 44-48 The family later relocated to Los Angeles, California where his father, unable to become a Hollywood writer, worked as a clerk and court reporter for the FBI. Sahl notes, \\"My dad was disappointed in his dreams and he distrusted that world for me.\\" Sahl went to Belmont High School in Los Angeles where he wrote for the school's newspaper. Actor Richard Crenna was a classmate. When the U.S. entered World War II after Pearl Harbor, Sahl, then fourteen, joined the school's Reserve Officers' Training Corps (ROTC). He won a medal for marksmanship and an American Legion Americanism award. Wanting to express his patriotism, he wore his ROTC uniform to school and in public and, when he turned fifteen, he dropped out of high school to join the Army by lying about his age. His mother tracked him down and brought him back home two weeks later after she revealed his true age. Upon graduating from high school, his father tried to get him into West Point and had received his Congressman's help. But Sahl had by then already enlisted in the United States Air Force. He was later stationed in Alaska with the 93rd Air Depot Group. In the military, however, he resisted the discipline and authoritarian control it had over his life. He expressed his nonconformity by growing a beard and refusing to wear a cap as required. He also wrote articles for a small newspaper criticizing the military, which resulted in his being penalized with three months of KP duty. He was discharged in 1947 and enrolled in Compton College, followed by the University of Southern California. He received a B.S. degree in 1950 with majors in traffic engineering and city management. He continued with the masters program but dropped out to become an actor and playwright. Career =Breaking into comedy= Between 1950 and 1953 he tried to get jobs as a stand-up comedian in about 30 nightclubs throughout Los Angeles, but with no success. NBC, where he once auditioned, told him he would never succeed as a comedian. He even offered to perform free during intermissions for the chance to show his talent. He recalls that period: \\"Despite all the folklore about the faith of friends in the struggling young artist, my friends constantly discouraged me.\\" He and a friend then rented an old theater, which they called Theater X, for \\"experimental,\\" and he began writing and staging one-act plays. One of his plays was titled \\"Nobody Trusted the Truth.\\" But unable to attract a large enough audience, they eventually closed the theater. For income, Sahl began doing odd jobs and writing. He worked as a used car salesman and a messenger, and wrote an unpublished novel and short stories. He went to New York hoping to sell his plays, but only managed to earn about eighteen dollars a week. He recalls, \\"I couldn't get a thing going. I was working on a novel, I was out of work, and I was out of gas.\\" As a result, he decided to try something different, by performing his plays as monologues. He felt it would be easier to do his monologue on stage instead of trying to sell it to others. \\"I knew that if I was going to get anything done, I'd have to do it myself,\\" he says. He returned to Los Angeles where he appeared at some clubs but his new style of monologue comedy received little attention. In 1953 he began dating Sue Babior. When she moved to Berkeley to study at the University of California, Sahl hitchhiked there to be with her. He spent his time auditing classes and hanging out at local coffee houses. For income he wrote for a few avant-garde publications. He slept in the back seat of a friend's car since Babior was living with roommates, including Nancy Droeger and Althia Sims. \\"Things were simple then,\\" he says. \\"All we had to worry about was the destiny of man.\\"Playboy magazine, February, 1969 He felt at home in the San Francisco Bay Area, commenting, \\"I was born in San Francisco.\\" The three years he lived in Berkeley were a valuable experience, he said. He sought out any clubs where he could perform as a stand-up, and Babior suggested he audition for the hungry i, a nightclub in San Francisco. Its owner, Enrico Banducci, took an immediate liking to Sahl's comedy style and offered him a job at $75 a week (About $720 in 2020 money), which became his first steady job as a stand-up comedian. Word about Sahl's satirical comedy acts spread quickly. He received good reviews from influential newspaper columnist, Herb Caen, which gave him instant credibility: \\"I don't know where Mr. Sahl came from but I'm glad he's here,\\" he wrote after watching his show. Caen began inviting his own friends, such as film comedians Danny Kaye and Eddie Cantor, to watch Sahl's performances. Cantor took him \\"under his wing\\" and gave him suggestions.By the end of his first year at the hungry i, Sahl was earning $3,000 a week (about $29,000 a week in 2020 money) and performing to packed houses. \\"I'd be washing cars if it weren't for Enrico,\\" he said later in his career, appreciating that Banducci was the first club owner to give him the chance to perform as a stand-up comedian. =Nightclub shows and national acclaim= After a year at the hungry i, Sahl began appearing at clubs throughout the country, including the Black Orchid and Mister Kelly's in Chicago, the Crescendo in Los Angeles, and the Village Vanguard and the Blue Angel in New York City.Hashagen, Paul. Fire Department, City of New York, Turner Publishing (2002) p. 148 Many of the clubs had never before had a stand-up comedian perform, which required Sahl to break in as a new kind of act. \\"I had to build up my own network of places to play,\\" he says. Numerous celebrities dropped by to see his shows after they heard about the \\"new phenomenon,\\" referring to Sahl's unique style of comedy. Woody Allen, who saw his show at the Blue Angel in 1954, commented that \\"he was suddenly this great genius that appeared who revolutionized the medium.\\" British comedy actor John Cleese became immediately interested in Sahl's radical style of humor, and accorded to him the same level of respect that the Beatles once reserved for Elvis Presley. On The Ed Sullivan Show in 1960 Television host Steve Allen, who originated the Tonight Show, said he was \\"struck by how amateur he seemed,\\" but added that the observation was not meant as a criticism, but as a \\"compliment\\". He noted that all the previous successful comics dressed formally, were glib and well-rehearsed, and were always in control of their audiences. Allen said that Sahl's \\"very un-show business manner was one of the things I liked when I first saw him work.\\" Sahl dressed casually, with no tie and usually wearing his trademark V-neck campus- style sweater. His stage presence was seen as being \\"candid and cool, the antithesis of the slick comic,\\" states theater critic Gerald Nachman. And although Sahl acquired a reputation for being an intellectual comedian, it was an image he disliked and disagreed with: \\"It was absurd. I was barely a C student,\\" he said. His naturalness on stage was partly due to his preferring improvisation over carefully rehearsed monologues. Sahl explained: His casual style of stand-up, where he seemed to be one-on-one with his audience, influenced new comedians, including Lenny Bruce and Dick Gregory. Sahl was the least controversial, however, because he dressed and looked \\"collegiate\\" and focused on politics, while Bruce confronted sexual and language conventions and Gregory focused on the civil rights movement. After seeing Mort Sahl on stage, Woody Allen, whose writings were often about his personal life, decided to give it a try: \\"I'd never had the nerve to talk about it before. Then Mort Sahl came along with a whole new style of humor, opening up vistas for people like me.\\" Commenting about Sahl's monologues, Nachman describes him as a \\"gifted narrator, so good at taking you along on his travels that you didn't quite realize until the show was over that you had been on a labyrinthine journey.\\" The speed with which Sahl gave his monologues was also notable. British film critic Penelope Gilliatt recalls how Sahl's improvisation \\"goes on a breakneck stammering loop and you think it will never make the circle. It always does.\\" For her it was like watching a circus act: \\"He freewheels a bike on a high wire tightrope with his brain racing and his hands off the handlebars.\\" Sahl's popularity \\"mushroomed like an Atomic cloud during the 50s,\\" says filmmaker Robert B. Weide, adding, \\"Simply put, Mort Sahl reinvented stand-up comedy.\\" Time magazine in 1960 published a cover story about him and his rise to fame, in which they described him as \\"the best of the New Comedians [and] the first notable American political satirist since Will Rogers.\\" Along with his nightclub performances, he appeared in some films and on television shows, including his network debut on The NBC Comedy Hour in May 1956.\\"The Big Party\\" (1959, NBC) (on YouTube.com); accessed February 14, 2015. His audience had also widened to include not only students and a \\"hip\\" public, but now even noted politicians sought out his shows. Some became friends, such as presidential candidate John F. Kennedy, who asked him to prepare a bank of political jokes he could use at public functions. Kennedy liked his style of political satire and what he described as Sahl's \\"relentless pursuit of everybody.\\" Adlai Stevenson and Hubert Humphrey were fans, Humphrey stating that \\"whenever there is a political bloat, Mort sticks a pin in it.\\" They valued the fact that he stayed current and took material from major newspapers and magazines. He kept his material fresh, wrote few notes, and entertained his audiences by presenting otherwise serious news with his brand of humor. He was not fond of television news, however, which he blamed in 1960 for \\"spoon-feeding\\" the public, and was therefore responsible for the \\"corruption and ignorance that may sink this country.\\" As a result of Sahl's popularity, besides getting on the cover of Time, he also became the first comedian to make a record album, the first to do college concerts and was the first comedian to win a Grammy.\\"Legendary Comedians Mort Sahl and Dick Gregory at the Rrazz Room\\", Goldstar =Declining career in 1960s= Following Kennedy's assassination in 1963, Sahl's interest in who was responsible was so great that he became a deputized member of New Orleans District Attorney Jim Garrison's team to investigate the assassination. As a result, Sahl's comedy would often reflect his politics and included readings and commentary about the Warren Commission Report, of which he consistently disputed the accuracy.\\"Mors Sahl Live in New York City\\", January 17, 1992 He alienated much of his audience, was effectively blacklisted and more of his planned shows were cancelled. His income dropped from $1 million to $19,000 by 1964. According to Nachman, the excessive focus on the Kennedy assassination details was Sahl's undoing and wrecked his career. Sahl later admitted that \\"there's never been anything that had a stronger impact on my life than this issue,\\" but added that he nonetheless \\"thought it was a wonderful quest.\\" =Partial comeback in the 1970s to the present= Sahl in 2007 By the 1970s the rising tide of counterculture eventually fueled Sahl's partial comeback as a veteran comedian, and he was included along with the new comedians breaking into the field, such as George Carlin, Lily Tomlin and Richard Pryor. In the 1980s he headlined for Banducci's new clubs in San Francisco. In the late 1980s he was trying to write screenplays, besides doing sporadic shows around the country. In 1987 he had a successful multiweek run in Australia.\\"L.A. To Get Another Taste Of The Biting Wit Of Mort Sahl\\", Los Angeles Times, March 21, 1987. In 1988 Sahl was back in New York and performed a one-man Off-Broadway show, Mort Sahl's America, which, despite getting good reviews from critics was not a box office success. The New York Times stated, \\"History has returned Mort Sahl to the spotlight when he is most needed. His style has an intuitive spontaneity. His presence is tonic.\\" Robert Weide produced a biographical documentary, Mort Sahl: The Loyal Opposition, which ran on PBS in 1989.'Mort Sahl: The Loyal Opposition, Whyaduck Productions, March 2, 2012. However, the level of success he once had now eluded him. One Los Angeles Times critic wrote, \\"Sahl is a man with a country but not a stage.\\" A number of television specials gave him a venue to perform in front of live audiences. The Monitor Channel broadcast a series of eight shows called Mort Sahl Live beginning in November 1991.\\"Mort Sahl Live #1 Atlantic City 11/16/91\\", The Monitor Channel, November 16, 1991\\"Mort Sahl Live #2 Anaheim 2/21/91\\", The Monitor Channel, December 12, 1991. From the 1990s on he has performed, but less often and mostly in theaters and college auditoriums.\\"BARK AND BITE : For Nearly Four Decades, Mort Sahl Has Been the Voice of Social Satire; Don't Expect Him to Back Off Now\\", Los Angeles Times, October 22, 1992 When Woody Allen saw him perform in 2001 at one of his rare New York club appearances, Allen told him, \\"this is crazy‚Äîyou should be working all the time.\\" Allen then called his manager Jack Rollins: \\"Listen, this guy is hilarious. We gotta bring him to New York.\\" Sahl then did shows at Joe's Pub in Manhattan to standing-room only audiences. Sahl is #40 on Comedy Central's list of the 100 greatest stand-up comedians of all time, ranked between Billy Crystal and Jon Stewart. In 2003 he received the Fifth Annual Alan King Award in American Jewish Humor from the National Foundation for Jewish Culture.\\"Mort Sahl\\", A.V. Club, January 7, 2004. In 2011, the Library of Congress placed his 1955 recording, At Sunset, on the National Recording Registry. =Satire comedy style= Sahl's humor is based on current events, especially politics, which led Milton Berle to describe him as \\"one of the greatest political satirists of all time.\\" His trademark persona is to enter the stage with a newspaper in hand, casually dressed in a V-neck sweater. He would often recite some news stories combined with satire. He was dubbed \\"Will Rogers with fangs\\" by Time magazine in 1960. Sahl would discuss people or events almost as if he were reporting them for the first time, and would digress into related stories or his own experiences. TV executive Roger Ailes said he saw him read the paper one day and after a few hours Sahl got up onstage with an entire evening's worth of new material. \\"With no writers, he just did what he had seen in the afternoon paper. He was a genius.\\" Sahl's presentation of news commentary as a form of social satire created a wide assortment of celebrity and political fans, including Adlai Stevenson, Marlene Dietrich, S.J. Perelman, Saul Bellow and Leonard Bernstein. Arthur M. Schlesinger, Jr. said his popularity was due to the public's \\"yearning for youth, irreverence, trenchancy, satire, [and] a clean break with the past.\\" And Steve Allen introduced him on one of his shows as being \\"the only real political philosopher we have in modern comedy.\\" Combined with his improvisational skill, Sahl's naturalness was also considered unique for a stage performer. Woody Allen notes that other comics were jealous of Sahl's stage persona and did not understand how he could perform by simply talking to the audience. Nachman states that the \\"mere idea of a stand-up comic talking about the real world was in itself revolutionary ... [and] the comedians who followed him‚ÄîLenny Bruce, Woody Allen, Dick Gregory, Phyllis Diller, Shelley Berman, Jonathan Winters‚Äîwere cast in a familiar nightclub mold.\\" Personal life Sahl has been married three times. He married Susan J. Babior in 1955; they divorced in 1958. In 1967 he married actress and model China Lee and they divorced in 1991. They had one son, Mort Sahl Jr., who died in 1996, aged 19, from an unknown drug-related reaction. Comedian Mort Sahl, wife China Lee and son Mort Sahl Jr. at Le Palmier Restaurant in New York City.

He regrets their separation, saying \\"I'm sorry I divorced Kenslea; I'm still in love with my wife.

In June 2007 a number of star comedians including George Carlin and Jonathan Winters, gave Sahl an 80th birthday tribute.Mort Sahl Acclaim , Mortsahlofficial.com; accessed February 14, 2016. Sahl does not drink, smoke, use drugs or use swear words, on or off stage. In 2008, Sahl moved from Los Angeles to Mill Valley, California, a suburb of San Francisco, where he became friends with comedian Robin Williams who lived nearby.

It denotes a rank within the former Holy Roman Empire (962‚Äì1806), which was below that of Emperor and King but above that of a Grand Duke (debatably), Prince and Duke.Meyers Taschenlexikon Geschichte 1982, vol 1, p22 & vol 2 pp106 & 319 The territory ruled by an Archduke or Archduchess was called an Archduchy. All remaining Archduchies ceased to exist in 1918. Terminology The English word is first recorded in 1530, derived from Middle French ', a 15th-century derivation from Medieval Latin ', from Latin - (Greek ) meaning \\"authority\\" or \\"primary\\" (see arch-) and ' \\"duke\\" (literally \\"leader\\"). \\"Archduke\\" (; ) is a title distinct from \\"Grand Duke\\" (; ; ), a later monarchic title borne by the rulers of other European countries (for instance, Luxembourg). History The Latin title archidux is first attested in reference to Bruno the Great, who ruled simultaneously as Archbishop of Cologne and Duke of Lotharingia in the 10th century, in the work of his biographer Ruotger. In Ruotger, the title served as an honorific denoting Bruno's unusual position rather than a formal office. The title was not used systematically until the 14th century, when the title \\"Archduke of Austria\\" was invented in the forged Privilegium Maius (1358‚Äì1359) by Duke Rudolf IV of Austria. Rudolf originally claimed the title in the form palatinus archidux (\\"palatine archduke\\"). The title was intended to emphasize the claimed precedence (thus \\"Arch-\\") of the Duchy of Austria, in an effort to put the Habsburgs on an even level with the Prince-Electors of the Holy Roman Empire, as Austria had been passed over when the Golden Bull of 1356 assigned that dignity to the four highest-ranking secular Imperial princes and three Archbishops. Holy Roman Emperor Charles IV refused to recognise the title, as did all the other ruling dynasties of the member countries of the Empire. But Duke Ernest the Iron and his descendants unilaterally assumed the title of Archduke. The archducal title was only officially recognized in 1453 by Emperor Frederick III, when the Habsburgs had solidified their grip on the throne of the de jure elected Holy Roman Emperor, making it de facto hereditary.Konstantin Moritz A. Langmaier: Erzherzog Albrecht VI. von √ñsterreich (1418‚Äì1463). Ein F√ºrst im Spannungsfeld von Dynastie, Regionen und Reich. K√∂ln u. a. 2015, S. 644f.https://www.researchgate.net/project/Albrecht- VI-1418-1463 Despite that imperial authorization of the title, which showed a Holy Roman Emperor from the Habsburg dynasty deciding over a title claim of the Habsburg dynasty, many ruling dynasties of the countries which formed the Empire refused to recognize the title \\"Archduke\\". Ladislaus the Posthumous, Duke of Austria, who died in 1457, never got in his lifetime the imperial authorization to use it, and accordingly, neither he nor anyone in his branch of the dynasty ever used the title. Emperor Frederick III himself simply used the title \\"Duke of Austria\\", never Archduke, until his death in 1493. The title was first granted to Frederick's younger brother, Albert VI of Austria (d. 1463), who used it at least from 1458. In 1477, Frederick III also granted the title of Archduke to his first cousin, Sigismund of Austria, ruler of Further Austria (). Frederick's son and heir, the future Emperor Maximilian I, started to use the title, but apparently only after the death of his wife Mary of Burgundy (d. 1482), as Archduke never appears in documents issued jointly by Maximilian and Mary as rulers in the Low Countries (where Maximilian is still titled \\"Duke of Austria\\"). The title appears first in documents issued under the joint rule of Maximilian and his son Philip in the Low Countries. Archduke was initially borne by those dynasts who ruled a Habsburg territory-- i.e., only by males and their consorts, appanages being commonly distributed to cadets. But these \\"junior\\" archdukes did not thereby become sovereign hereditary rulers, since all territories remained vested in the Austrian crown. Occasionally a territory might be combined with a separate gubernatorial mandate ruled by an archducal cadet. Usage From the 16th century onward, \\"Archduke\\" and its female form, \\"Archduchess\\", came to be used by all the members of the House of Habsburg (e.g. Queen Marie Antoinette of France was born Archduchess Maria Antonia of Austria). Upon extinction of the male line of the Habsburgs and the marriage of their heiress, the Holy Roman Empress-consort Maria Theresa, Queen of Hungary and Archduchess of Austria, to Francis Stephen, Duke of Lorraine, who was elected Holy Roman Emperor, their descendants formed the House of Habsburg-Lorraine. After the dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire this usage was retained in the Austrian Empire (1804‚Äì1867) and the Austro-Hungarian Empire (1867‚Äì1918). The official use of titles of nobility and of all other hereditary titles, including Archduke, has been illegal in the Republic of Austria for Austrian citizens since the Law on the Abolition of Nobility (Gesetz vom 3. April 1919 √ºber die Aufhebung des Adels, der weltlichen Ritter- und Damenorden und gewisser Titel und W√ºrden). Thus those members of the Habsburg family who are residents of the Republic of Austria are simply known by their first name(s) and their surname Habsburg- Lothringen. However, members of the family who reside in other countries may or may not use the title, in accordance with laws and customs in those nations. For example, Otto Habsburg-Lothringen (1912‚Äì2011), the eldest son of the last Habsburg Emperor, was an Austrian, Hungarian and German citizen. As he lived in Germany, where it is permitted to use hereditary titles as part of the civil surname (including indications of origin, such as von or zu), his official civil name was Otto von Habsburg (literally: Otto of Habsburg), whereas in Austria he was registered as Otto Habsburg. The King of Spain also bears the nominal title of Archduke of Austria as part of his full list of titles, as the Bourbon dynasty adopted all the titles previously held by the Spanish Habsburgs when they took over the Spanish throne. However, \\"Archduke\\" was never considered by the Spanish Bourbons as a substantial dignity of their own dynasty, but rather as a traditional supplementary title of the Spanish Kings since the days of the Habsburg dynasty on the royal throne (1516‚Äì1700). Hence, no member of the royal family other than the King bears the (additional) title of \\"Archduke\\".

The boatswain supervises the other members of the ship's deck department, and typically is not a watchstander, except on vessels with small crews. Additional duties vary depending upon ship, crew, and circumstances. History Boatswain of the Royal Navy, c. 1820 The word boatswain has been in the English language since approximately 1450. It is derived from late Old English batswegen, from bat (boat) concatenated with Old Norse sveinn (swain), meaning a young man, apprentice, a follower, retainer or servant. Directly translated to modern Norwegian it would be b√•tsvenn, while the actual crew title in Norwegian is b√•tsmann (\\"boats-man\\"). While the phonetic spelling bosun is reported as having been observed since 1868, this latter spelling was used in Shakespeare's The Tempest written in 1611, and as Bos'n in later editions. =Royal Navy= The rank of boatswain is the oldest rank in the Royal Navy, and its origins can be traced back to the year 1040. In that year, when five English ports began furnishing warships to King Edward the Confessor in exchange for certain privileges, they also furnished crews whose officers were the master, boatswain, carpenter and cook. Later these officers were \\"warranted\\" by the British Admiralty. They maintained and sailed the ships and were the standing officers of the navy. The boatswain was the officer responsible for the care of the rigging, cordage, anchors, sails, boats, flags and other stores. The Royal Navy's last official boatswain, Commander E. W. Andrew OBE, retired in 1990. Naval cadets The rank of cadet boatswain, in some schools, is the second highest rank in the combined cadet force naval section that a cadet can attain, below the rank of coxswain and above the rank of leading hand. It is equivalent to the rank of colour sergeant in the army and the royal marines cadets; it is sometimes an appointment for a senior petty officer to assist a coxswain. Job description Boatswain of Felix von Luckners yacht Seeteufel, smoking a pipe and hosing the vessel's deck The boatswain works in a ship's deck department as the foreman of the unlicensed (crew members without a mate's licence) deck crew. Sometimes, the boatswain is also a third or fourth mate. A boatswain must be highly skilled in all matters of marlinespike seamanship required for working on deck of a seagoing vessel. The boatswain is distinguished from other able seamen by the supervisory roles: planning, scheduling, and assigning work. As deck crew foreman, the boatswain plans the day's work and assigns tasks to the deck crew. As work is completed, the boatswain checks on completed work for compliance with approved operating procedures.Oregon University System, 2004 Outside the supervisory role, the boatswain regularly inspects the vessel and performs a variety of routine, skilled, and semi-skilled duties to maintain all areas of the ship not maintained by the engine department. These duties can include cleaning, painting, and maintaining the vessel's hull, superstructure and deck equipment as well as executing a formal preventive maintenance program. A boatswain's skills may include cargo rigging, winch operations, deck maintenance, working aloft, and other duties required during deck operations. The boatswain is well versed in the care and handling of lines, and has knowledge of knots, hitches, bends, whipping, and splices as needed to perform tasks such as mooring a vessel. The boatswain typically operates the ship's windlasses when letting go and heaving up anchors. Moreover, a boatswain may be called upon to lead firefighting efforts or other emergency procedures encountered on board. Effective boatswains are able to integrate their seafarer skills into supervising and communicating with members of deck crew with often diverse backgrounds. Originally, on board sailing ships the boatswain was in charge of a ship's anchors, cordage, colours, deck crew and the ship's boats. The boatswain would also be in charge of the rigging while the ship was in dock. The boatswain's technical tasks were modernised with the advent of steam engines and subsequent mechanisation. A boatswain also is responsible for doing routine pipes using what is called a boatswain's call. There are specific sounds which can be made with the pipe to indicate various events, such as emergency situations or notifications of meal time. A common slang name for this instrument was the pippity dippity.https://www.exploratorium.edu/sites/default/files/pdfs/OTW_TH.pdf Notable boatswains A number of boatswains and naval boatswains mates have achieved fame. Reuben James and William Wiley are famous for their heroism in the Barbary Wars and are namesakes of the ships USS Reuben James and USS Wiley. Medal of Honor recipients Francis P. Hammerberg and George Robert Cholister were U.S. Navy boatswain's mates, as was Navy Cross recipient Stephen Bass. Victoria Cross recipients John Sheppard, John Sullivan, Henry Curtis, and John Harrison were Royal Navy boatswain's mates. There are also a handful of boatswains and boatswain's mates in literature. The boatswain in William Shakespeare's The Tempest is a central character in the opening scene, which takes place aboard a ship at sea, and appears again briefly in the final scene. Typhoon by Joseph Conrad has a nameless boatswain who tells Captain MacWhirr of a \\"lump\\" of men going overboard during the peak of the storm. Also, the character Bill Bobstay in Gilbert and Sullivan's musical comedy H.M.S. Pinafore is alternatively referred to as a \\"bos'un\\"See quote from \\"The Complete Annotated Gilbert & Sullivan\\" at . and a \\"boatswain's mate\\".See quote from S.W. Gilbert in \\"The story of the H.M.S. Pinafore\\" at . Another boatswain from literature is Smee from Peter Pan. Lord Byron had a Newfoundland dog named Boatswain. Byron wrote the famous poem \\"Epitaph to a Dog\\" and had a monument made for him at Newstead Abbey. The 1907 naval gothic novel The Boats of the \\"Glen Carrig\\" by William Hope Hodgson features the character of the ship's ‚Äúbo'sun‚Äù as an important member of the crew and a personal friend to the narrator. Billy was a boatswain in the fictional Starz TV show Black Sails. Scouting Quartermaster is the highest rank in the Sea Scouts, BSA, an older youth (13-21) co-ed programme. The youth can also elect a youth leader, giving that youth the title \\"boatswain\\". In the Netherlands, a boatswain (Bootsman) is the patrol leader of a Sea Scout patrol (Bak), in Flanders it is the assistant patrol leader of a Sea Scout patrol (Kwartier).

born 30 June 1964) is the first wife of Prince Joachim of Denmark, the younger son of Margrethe II of Denmark. She was born in Hong Kong and is of mixed Chinese- European ancestry. She was introduced to Prince Joachim in 1994. They married in 1995 and had two sons together, until the marriage was dissolved in 2005. Early life and family Of English, Chinese, Czech, and Austrian ancestry, Alexandra Manley was born in Hong Kong, as the eldest of three daughters of Richard Nigel Manley (born in Shanghai, China on 11 August 1924 to a father of English and Chinese ancestry, died 12 January 2010, buried 10 February 2010 in Liesing Cemetery, Vienna) and Christa Maria Manley of Czech and Austrian descent (born Christa Maria Nowotny in Austria in 1933). Her father was an insurance company executive and her mother was the manager of a communications company. She was christened at the Cathedral of Saint John, Hong Kong. She attended Quarry Bay Junior School (1969‚Äì1971), Glenealy School (1971‚Äì1974) and Island School (1974‚Äì1982), all in Hong Kong. Manley studied international business at Vienna University of Economics and Business in Austria. She also went to Japan and England for studies. It is not known whether she obtained a university degree. From 1990 to 1995, she was employed by GT Management (Asia) Ltd., Hong Kong, where from 1990 to 1993 she worked in Sales and Marketing and from 1993 as a deputy chief executive of that department. First marriage and children Alexandra met Prince Joachim at a private dinner in Hong Kong in January 1994, where he was working for a Danish shipping company. After a whirlwind courtship, thought to have begun in late 1994, Prince Joachim, on bended knee, presented Alexandra with a diamond and ruby engagement ring while the couple vacationed together in the Philippines. Their engagement, which took both Alexandra's family and Danish royal Watchers by surprise, was officially revealed in May 1995. They were married on 18 November 1995, by Queen Margrethe's Chaplain-in-Ordinary, in the Chapel of Frederiksborg Castle at Hiller√∏d. The wedding festivities were held at Fredensborg Palace. The bride's gown was designed by J√∏rgen Bender; she wore the Alexandrine Drop Tiara, originally the property of Alexandrine of Mecklenburg-Schwerin, which was a wedding gift from Queen Margrethe. When she married Prince Joachim, she gave up her career in marketing. It is believed that she had renounced her British citizenship prior to become a Danish subject upon her marriage. Prince Joachim and Princess Alexandra have two children from their former marriage: * Prince Nikolai William Alexander Frederik (born 28 August 1999). * Prince Felix Henrik Valdemar Christian (born 22 July 2002). Life as a princess Alexandra became popular with the Danish people. Known for her fashion sense and charity work, she was dubbed the Diana of the North. She is a native English and German speaker (through her father and mother, respectively), and her fluency in German helped her pick up the Danish language quickly. Within a few months she spoke it nearly without accent, which further endeared her to the Danes. As she said in an interview, \\"I don't find the grammar especially difficult, but the pronunciation can be hard, since we swallow some of our words. It reminds me a little of Chinese, with the glottal stop ‚Ä¶ Saying something with an upswing or a downswing can give a word an entirely different meaning,\\" she explained. \\"It was my decision to learn the language immediately. It would have been terrible to have to stand up and speak English at an engagement, or thank someone for something. It would have been utterly wrong. This is my home, and so there was no other option\\". Both during and after her marriage, she was involved in numerous philanthropic pursuits, including the Children's Red Cross, the Danish Society for the Blind, UNICEF, and single mothers' advocacy group Mother Help. She also served as a UNICEF ambassador when she travelled to Thailand to visit HIV/AIDS patients. End of marriage By mid-2004, rumours were circulating throughout Denmark and neighbouring Sweden and Norway that her marriage to Prince Joachim had gone sour. On 16 September 2004, Alexandra and Joachim announced their separation and eventual intention to divorce. It would be the first in the Royal Family since 1846. Newspaper reports speculating on the reasons for the marital rupture soon followed. The Folketing decided to put Alexandra on the civil list for life, independent of her possible future remarriage. Alexandra's payments of her new yearly allowance of 2.1m kroner (US$330,000) started retroactively from 1 October 2004. The couple divorced on 8 April 2005. On 23 June 2017, she announced that she would renounce her entitlement to the Danish civil list in July 2020, coinciding with the 18th birthday of Prince Felix. Second marriage and current life In mid-2005 there were reports and pictures of Alexandra together with Martin J√∏rgensen (b. 2 March 1978 in Valby), the son of Jacob J√∏rgensen. Jacob J√∏rgensen is well known in Denmark for his film production company JJ Film, which produced numerous documentaries in which members of the royal family co-operated and participated. She married Martin J√∏rgensen on 3 March 2007 in a private ceremony at √òster Egede Church near Fakse. In September 2015, it was announced that J√∏rgensen and the Countess were divorcing after eight and a half years of marriage. The Countess had cited differences in values as the reason for the divorce. According to Royal Central, the divorce was finalized in 2015. In 2007 the Countess of Frederiksborg joined the Danish board of directors of Ferring Pharmaceuticals. In 2017, it was announced that she would take up the position of Poling Chair of Business and Government at the Indiana University Kelley School of Business. In August 2017 she attended the 18th birthday party of her son Prince Nikolai along with many members of the royal family, including Queen Margrethe II.

When married together they are known as \\"The Irons\\" A Halligan tool on display at the NYC Fire Museum (middle), next to the earlier Kelly tool (2nd from left) it was based on A Halligan bar, also known as a Halligan tool\\"Forcible Entry Reference Guide - Techniques and Procedures,\\" New York City Fire Department, December 2006, p. 14, accessed June 10, 2017., is a forcible entry tool used by firefighters and law enforcement. History The tool was designed by and named after a New York City Fire Department (FDNY) First Deputy Chief named Hugh Halligan in 1948. Later that year, the first prototype of the Halligan bar was made by blacksmith Peter Clarke. Because the device had been invented by one of its members, the FDNY did not initially purchase the tool in order to avoid the appearance of a conflict of interest.Fire Department City of New York: The Bravest; An Illustrated History 1865-2002, page 72. The Boston Fire Department was the first major customer of the Halligan bar, purchasing one for every fire company in the city. The tool was popular enough that members of New York ladder companies began buying it with their own money until the department ultimately decided to purchase the tool, gradually leading to widespread adoption across North America and eventually worldwide. The Halligan bar has become the most versatile hand tool to be used for the past seven decades for a multitude of fireground tasks.Morelock, Jamie. Upgrading the Halligan Bar's Roof Ring. Fire Engineering. Pennwell Corporation. Volume 163, Issue 3. Page 47. 2010. Design and use Based on the earlier Kelly tool, the Halligan is a multipurpose tool for prying, twisting, punching, or striking. It consists of a claw (or fork), a blade (wedge or adze), and a tapered pick, which is especially useful in quickly breaching many types of locked doors. Either the adze end or fork end of the tool can be used to break through the latch of a swinging door by forcing the tool between the door and doorjamb and prying the two apart, striking it with a sledgehammer or a flat- head axe. The firefighter holding the Halligan can use a \\"baseball bat swing\\" to sink the pick into the door frame near the door handle and then force the door by applying pressure to the adze.White, Billy & Johnson, Fergus. The Backup Firefighter's Role in the Initial Fire Attack. Fire Engineering. 2011. Another option is to use the Halligan to pry the door off the top hinges. The pick and adze (only when properly used) provide protection to the arms, hands, and body of the holder during forcible entry operation.Fisher, Rob. History of the Halligan Bar. Firefighternation. 2007 The Halligan can be used to knock down a wall in a house to get to another area.Equipment Used by Firefighters. ABCO Fire Protection. The Halligan can be used to make a purchase point on a car hood to cut the battery.Fritz, Richard. Tools of the Trade: Hand Tools and Their Use. Pennwell Books. 1997. The point can be used to break glass on a car or building for access or ventilation.Schottke, David. Fundamentals of Firefighter Skills. Jones and Barlett Publishers. 2014 The pick can be placed into the shackle (or eye) of a padlock or hasp and twisted or pried to break it free. It can also be driven into a roof to provide a foothold for firefighters engaged in vertical ventilation. Using a K-tool and the adze end, a lock cylinder can easily be pulled. The fork end is routinely used to shut off gas meter valves. The Halligan can also be used for vehicle extrication among other things. The tool can be used to pry open the hood of a car when it is jammed from an accident.Smith, Steve. militarygovernmentcareeres.knojji.com. 2013. The Halligan can be used as a step to get up on a window that is at head level.The Art of the Fire Service. Tips From the Bucket. Vententersarch.com The Halligan can be tied to a rope and act as an anchor in the window frame, for improvised bailout.Thomas Delmar Learning. The Firefighter's Handbook. Thomas and Delmar Learning. Clifton Park, New York. 2000. One variant of the Halligan has a heavy sliding collar on the shaft. Once the prying end of the tool is wedged into position, the sliding 'hammer' is used to force the wedge, allowing for proper seating before prying. The adze end is also assisted by using the sliding hammer to generate forced traction on a hooked cylinder. Another variant has an end that resembles a lever-type can opener, used for making large holes for access or ventilation in sheet metal. The Halligan is available in a number of lengths ‚Äì typically ‚Äì and of various materials, including titanium, beryllium copper or stainless steel. Carrying straps or rings can be found. The 18-inch Halligan is often referred to as an officer's tool. A Halligan bar and a flathead axe can be joined together (and partially interlocked, head-to-toe) to form what is known as a married set, set of irons or simply The Irons. This combination of tools is most common within the fire service. However, the Halligan may also be married with a Halligan hook or sledgehammer as an alternative.

The siege was the culmination of a series of events that began in December 1910, with an attempted jewellery robbery at Houndsditch in the City of London by a gang of Latvian immigrants which resulted in the murder of three policemen, the wounding of two others, and the death of George Gardstein, the leader of the Latvian gang. An investigation by the Metropolitan and City of London Police forces identified Gardstein's accomplices, most of whom were arrested within two weeks. The police were informed that the last two members of the gang were hiding at 100 Sidney Street in Stepney. The police evacuated local residents from the environs, and on the morning of 3 January a firefight broke out. Armed with inferior weapons, the police sought assistance from the army. The siege lasted for about six hours. Towards the end of the stand-off, the building caught fire; no single cause has been identified. One of the agitators in the building was shot before the fire spread. While the London Fire Brigade were damping down the ruins‚Äîin which they found the two bodies‚Äîthe building collapsed, killing a fireman, Superintendent Charles Pearson. The siege marked the first time the police had requested military assistance in London to deal with an armed stand-off. It was also the first siege in Britain to be caught on camera, as the events were filmed by Path√© News. Some of the footage included images of the Home Secretary, Winston Churchill. His presence caused a political row over the level of his operational involvement. At the trial in May 1911 of those arrested for the Houndsditch jewellery robbery, all but one of the accused were acquitted; the conviction was overturned on appeal. The events were fictionalised in film‚Äîin The Man Who Knew Too Much (1934) and The Siege of Sidney Street (1960)‚Äîand novels. On the centenary of the events two tower blocks in Sidney Street were named after Peter the Painter, one of the minor members of the gang who was probably not present at either Houndsditch or Sidney Street. The murdered policemen and the fireman who died are commemorated with memorial plaques. Background =Immigration and demographics in London= 1900 map of Jewish East London. Circled on the left of the map is the location of the Houndsditch murders; circled on the right is the location of 10 Sidney Street. The map is coloured to show the density of Jewish residents in East London: the darker the blue, the higher the Jewish population. In the 19th century, the Russian Empire was home to about five million Jews, the largest Jewish community at the time. Subjected to religious persecution and violent pogroms, many emigrated and between 1875 and 1914 around 120,000 arrived in the United Kingdom, mostly in England. The influx reached its peak in the late 1890s when large numbers of Jewish immigrants‚Äîmostly poor and semi-skilled or unskilled‚Äîsettled in the East End of London. The concentration of Jewish immigrants into some areas was almost 100 per cent of the population, and a study undertaken in 1900 showed that Houndsditch and Whitechapel were both identified as a \\"well-defined intensely Jewish district\\". Some of the expatriates were revolutionaries, many of whom were unable to adapt to life in the politically less oppressive London. The social historian William J. Fishman writes that \\"the ' (crazy) Anarchists were almost accepted as part of the East End landscape\\"; the terms \\"socialist\\" and \\"anarchist\\" had been conflated in the British press, who used the terms interchangeably to refer to those with revolutionary beliefs. A leading article in The Times described the Whitechapel area as one that \\"harbours some of the worst alien anarchists and criminals who seek our too hospitable shore. And these are the men who use the pistol and the knife.\\" From the turn of the century, gang warfare persisted in the Whitechapel and Aldgate areas of London between groups of Bessarabians and refugees from Odessa; various revolutionary factions were active in the area. The Tottenham Outrage of January 1909, by two revolutionary Russians in London‚ÄîPaul Helfeld and Jacob Lepidus‚Äîwas an attempt to rob a payroll van, which left two dead and twenty injured. The event used a tactic often employed by revolutionary groups in Russia: the expropriation or theft of private property to fund radical activities. The influx of √©migr√©s and the increase of violent crime associated with it, led to popular concerns and comments in the press. The government passed the Aliens Act 1905 in an attempt to reduce immigration. The popular press reflected the opinions of many at the time; a leading article in The Manchester Evening Chronicle supported the bill to bar \\"the dirty, destitute, diseased, verminous and criminal foreigner who dumps himself on our soil\\". The journalist Robert Winder, in his examination of migration into Britain, opines that the Act \\"gave official sanction to xenophobic reflexes which might ... have remained dormant\\". =Latvian √©migr√© gang= By 1910 Russian √©migr√©s met regularly at the Anarchist Club in Jubilee Street, Stepney. Many of its members were not anarchists, and the club became a meeting and social venue for the Russian √©migr√© diaspora, most of whom were Jewish. The small group of Latvians who became involved in the events at Houndsditch and Sidney Street were not all anarchists‚Äîalthough anarchist literature was later found among their possessions. Members of the group were probably revolutionaries who had been radicalised by their experiences in Russia. All had extreme left-wing political views and believed the expropriation of private property was a valid practice. The probable leader of the group was George Gardstein, whose real name was likely to have been Poloski or Poolka; he used the aliases Garstin, Poloski, Poolka, Morountzeff, Mourimitz, Maurivitz, Milowitz, Morintz, Morin and Levi. Gardstein, who probably was an anarchist, had been accused of murder and acts of terrorism in Warsaw in 1905 before his arrival in London. Another member of the group, Jacob (or Yakov) Peters, had been an agitator in Russia while in the army and later as a dockyard worker. He had served a term in prison for his activities and had been tortured by the removal of his fingernails. Yourka Dubof was another Russian agitator who had fled to England after being flogged by Cossacks. Fritz Svaars was a Latvian who had been arrested by the Russian authorities three times for terrorist offences, but escaped each time. He had travelled through the United States, where he undertook a series of robberies, before arriving in London in June 1910. Another member was \\"Peter the Painter\\", a nickname for an unknown figure, possibly named Peter Piaktow (or Piatkov, Pjatkov or Piaktoff), or Janis Zhaklis. Bernard Porter, in a brief sketch in the Dictionary of National Biography, writes that no firm details are known of the anarchist's background and that \\"None of the ... biographical 'facts' about him ... is altogether reliable.\\" William (or Joseph) Sokoloff (or Sokolow) was a Latvian who had been arrested in Riga in 1905 for murder and robbery before travelling to London. Another of the group's members was Karl Hoffman‚Äîwhose real name was Alfred Dzircol‚Äîwho had been involved in revolutionary and criminal activities for several years, including gun- running. In London he had practised as a decorator. John Rosen‚Äîreal name John Zelin or Tzelin‚Äîcame to London in 1909 from Riga and worked as a barber, while another member of the gang was Max Smoller, also known as Joe Levi and \\"Josepf the Jew\\". He was wanted in his native Crimea for several jewel robberies. =Policing in the capital= Following the Metropolitan Police Act 1829 and the City of London Police Act 1839, the capital was policed by two forces, the Metropolitan Police, who held sway over most of the capital, and the City of London Police, who were responsible for law enforcement within the historic City boundaries. The events in Houndsditch in December 1910 fell into the purview of the City of London service, and the subsequent actions at Sidney Street in January 1911 were in the jurisdiction of the Metropolitan force. Both services came under the political control of the Home Secretary, who in 1911 was the 36-year-old rising politician Winston Churchill. While on the beat, or in the course of their normal duties, the officers of the City of London and Metropolitan forces were provided with a short wooden truncheon for protection. When they faced armed opponents‚Äîas was the case in Sidney Street‚Äîthe police were issued with Webley and Bull Dog revolvers, shotguns and small-bore rifles fitted with .22 Morris-tube barrels, the last of which were more commonly used on small indoor shooting galleries. Houndsditch murders, December 1910 Scene of the robbery, showing a group of policemen in Exchange Buildings, which backs onto the Houndsditch frontage of the shop At the beginning of December 1910 Smoller, using the name Joe Levi, visited Exchange Buildings, a small cul-de-sac that backed onto the properties of Houndsditch. He rented No. 11 Exchange Buildings; a week later Svaars rented number 9 for a month, saying he needed it for storage. The gang were unable to rent number 10, which was directly behind their target, 119 Houndsditch, the jeweller's shop owned by Henry Samuel Harris. The safe in the jeweller's was reputed to contain between ¬£20,000 and ¬£30,000 worth of jewellery; Harris's son later stated the total was only around ¬£7,000. Over the next two weeks the gang brought in various pieces of necessary equipment, including a 60-foot (18.25 m) length of India rubber gas hose, a cylinder of compressed gas and a selection of tools, including diamond-tipped drills. With the exception of Gardstein, the identities of the gang members present in Houndsditch on the night of 16 December 1910 have never been confirmed. Bernard Porter, writing in the Dictionary of National Biography, considers that Sokoloff and Peters were present and, in all likelihood, were two of those who shot the policemen who interrupted their burglary. Porter opines that Peter the Painter was probably not at the property that night, while the journalist J P Eddy suggests that Svaars was among those present. Donald Rumbelow, a former policeman who wrote a history of the events, considers that those present consisted of Gardstein, Smoller, Peters and Dubof, with a second group in case the work needed to continue into the following day, which included among their number Sokolow and Svaars. Rumbelow considers a third group on standby, staying at Hoffman's lodgings, to have comprised Hoffman, Rosen and Osip Federoff, an unemployed locksmith. Rumbelow also considers that present at the events‚Äîeither as lookouts or in unknown capacities‚Äîwere Peter the Painter and Nina Vassilleva. On 16 December, working from the small yard behind 11 Exchange Buildings, the gang began to break through the back wall of the shop; number 10 had been unoccupied since 12 December. At around 10:00 that evening, returning to his home at 120 Houndsditch, Max Weil heard curious noises coming from his neighbour's property. Outside his house Weil found Police Constable Piper on his beat and informed him of the noises. Piper checked at 118 and 121 Houndsditch, where he could hear the noise, which he thought was unusual enough to investigate further. At 11:00 he knocked at the door of 11 Exchange Buildings‚Äîthe only property with a light on in the back. The door was opened in a furtive manner and Piper became suspicious immediately. So as not to rouse the man's concerns, Piper asked him \\"is the missus in?\\" The man answered in broken English that she was out, and the policeman said he would return later. Sergeants Tucker and Bentley and Constable Choate, murdered while on duty on 16 December 1910 Piper reported that as he was leaving Exchange Buildings to return to Houndsditch he saw a man acting suspiciously in the shadows of the cul-de-sac. As the policeman approached him, the man walked away; Piper later described him as being approximately , pale and fair-haired. When Piper reached Houndsditch he saw two policemen from the adjoining beats‚Äîconstables Woodhams and Choate‚Äîwho watched 120 Houndsditch and 11 Exchange Buildings while Piper went to the nearby Bishopsgate Police Station to report. By 11:30 seven uniformed and two plain clothes policemen had gathered in the locality, each armed with his wooden truncheon. Sergeant Bentley from Bishopsgate police station knocked at number 11, unaware that Piper had already done so, which alerted the gang. The door was answered by Gardstein, who made no response when Bentley asked if anyone was working there. Bentley asked him to fetch someone who spoke English; Gardstein left the door half-closed and disappeared inside. Bentley entered the hall with Sergeant Bryant and Constable Woodhams; as they could see the bottom of his trouser legs, they soon realised that someone was watching them from the stairs. The police asked the man if they could step into the back of the property, and he agreed. As Bentley moved forward, the back door opened and one of the gang exited, firing from a pistol as he did so; the man on the stairs also began firing. Bentley was shot in the shoulder and the neck‚Äîthe second round severing his spine. Bryant was shot in the arm and chest and Woodhams was wounded in the leg, which broke his femur; both collapsed. Although they survived, neither Bryant or Woodhams fully recovered from their injuries. As the gang exited the property and made to escape up the cul-de- sac, other police intervened. Sergeant Charles Tucker from Bishopsgate police station was hit twice, once in the hip and once in the heart by Peters: he died instantly. Choate grabbed Gardstein and wrestled for his gun, but the Russian managed to shoot him in the leg. Other members of the gang ran to Gardstein's assistance, shooting Choate twelve times in the process, but Gardstein was also wounded; as the policeman collapsed, Gardstein was carried away by his accomplices, who included Peters. As these men, aided by an unknown woman, made their escape with Gardstein they were accosted by Isaac Levy, a passer-by, whom they threatened at pistol-point. He was the only witness to the escape who was able to provide firm details; other witnesses confirmed they saw a group of three men and a woman, and thought one of the men was drunk as he was being helped by his friends. The group, which included Peters, went to Svaars' and Peter the Painter's lodgings at 59 Grove Street (now Golding Street), off Commercial Road, where Gardstein was tended by two of the gang's associates, Luba Milstein (Svaars' mistress) and Sara Trassjonsky. As they left Gardstein on the bed, Peters left his Dreyse pistol under the mattress, either to make it seem the wounded man was the one who had killed Tucker, or to enable him to defend himself against a possible arrest. Other policemen arrived in Houndsditch, and began to attend to the wounded. Tucker's body was put into a taxi and he was taken to the London Hospital (now the Royal London Hospital) in Whitechapel Road. Choate was also taken there, where he was operated on, but he died at 5:30am on 17 December. Bentley was taken to St Bartholomew's Hospital. He was half-conscious on arrival, but recovered enough to be able to have a conversation with his pregnant wife and answer questions about the events. At 6:45pm on 17 December his condition worsened, and he died at 7:30. The killings of Tucker, Bentley and Choate remain one of the largest multiple murders of police officers carried out in Britain in peacetime. Investigation, 17 December 1910 ‚Äì 2 January 1911 Police finding Gardstein's body, as seen in The Illustrated Police News The City of London police informed the Metropolitan force, as their protocol demanded, and both services issued revolvers to the detectives involved in the search. The subsequent investigation was challenging for the police because of the cultural differences between the British police and the largely foreign residents of the area covered by the search. The police did not have any Russian, Latvian or Yiddish speakers on the force. In the early hours of the morning of 17 December Milstein and Trassjonsky became increasingly concerned as Gardstein's condition worsened, and they sent for a local doctor, explaining that their patient had been wounded accidentally by a friend. The doctor thought the bullet was still in the chest‚Äîit was later found to be touching the right ventricle of the heart. The doctor wanted to take Gardstein to the London Hospital, but he refused; with no other course open to him, the doctor sold them pain medication and left. The Russian was dead by 9:00 that morning. The doctor returned at 11:00am and found the body. He had not heard of the events at Exchange Buildings the night before, and so reported the death to the coroner, not the police. At midday the coroner reported the death to the local police who, led by Divisional Detective Inspector Frederick Wensley, went to Grove Street and discovered the corpse. Trassjonsky was in the next room when they entered, and she was soon found by the police, hastily burning papers; she was arrested and taken to the police headquarters at Old Jewry. Many of the papers recovered linked the suspects to the East End, particularly to the anarchist groups active in the area. Wensley, who had extensive knowledge of the Whitechapel area, subsequently acted as a liaison officer to the City of London force throughout the investigation. Gardstein's body was removed to a local mortuary where his face was cleaned, his hair brushed, his eyes opened and his photograph taken. The picture, and descriptions of those who had helped Gardstein escape from Exchange Buildings, were distributed on posters in English and Russian, asking locals for information. About 90 detectives vigorously searched the East End, spreading details of those they were looking for. A local landlord, Isaac Gordon, reported one of his lodgers, Nina Vassilleva, after she had told him she had been one of the people living at Exchange Buildings. Wensley questioned the woman, finding anarchist publications in her rooms, along with a photograph of Gardstein. Information began to come in from the public and the group's associates: on 18 December Federoff was arrested at home, and on 22 December Dubof and Peters were both captured. Memorial service St Paul's Cathedral for Tucker, Bentley and Choate, 23 December 1910 On 22 December a public memorial service took place for Tucker, Bentley and Choate at St Paul's Cathedral. King George V was represented by Edward Wallington, his Groom in Waiting; also present were Churchill and the Lord Mayor of London. The crime had shocked Londoners and the service showed evidence of their feelings. An estimated ten thousand people waited in St Paul's environs, and many local businesses closed as a mark of respect; the nearby London Stock Exchange ceased trading for half an hour to allow traders and staff to watch the procession along Threadneedle Street. After the service, when the coffins were being transported on an eight-mile (13 km) journey to the cemeteries, it was estimated that 750,000 people lined the route, many throwing flowers onto the hearses as they passed. Identity parades were held at Bishopsgate police station on 23 December. Isaac Levy, who had seen the group leaving Exchange Buildings, identified Peters and Dubof as the two he had seen carrying Gardstein. It was also ascertained that Federoff had been witnessed at the events. The following day Federoff, Peters and Dubof all appeared at the Guildhall police court where they were charged with being connected to the murder of the three policemen, and with conspiracy to burgle the jewellery shop. All three pleaded not guilty. On 27 December the poster bearing Gardstein's picture was seen by his landlord, who alerted police. Wensley and his colleagues visited the lodgings on Gold Street, Stepney and found knives, a gun, ammunition, false passports and revolutionary publications. Two days later there was another hearing at the Guildhall police court. In addition to Federoff, Peters and Dubof, present in the dock were Milstein and Trassjonsky. With some of the defendants having a low standard of English, interpreters were used throughout the proceedings. At the end of the day the case was adjourned until 6 January 1911. On New Year's Day 1911 the body of L√©on Beron, a Russian Jewish immigrant, was found on Clapham Common in South London. He had been badly beaten and two S-shaped cuts, both two inches long, were on his cheeks. The case became connected in the press with the Houndsditch murders and the subsequent events at Sidney Street, although the evidence at the time for the link was scant. The historian F G Clarke, in his history of the events, located information from another Latvian who stated that Beron had been killed not because he was one of the informers who had passed on information, but because he was planning to pass the information on, and the act was a pre-emptive one, designed to scare the locals into not informing on the anarchists. The posters of Gardstein proved effective, and late on New Year's Day a member of the public came forward to provide information about Svaars and Sokoloff. The informant told police that the men were hiding at 100 Sidney Street, along with a lodger, Betty Gershon, who was Sokoloff's mistress. The informant was persuaded to visit the property the following day to confirm the two men were still present. A meeting took place on the afternoon of 2 January to decide the next steps. Wensley, high-ranking members of the Metropolitan force and Sir William Nott-Bower, the Commissioner of the City Police, were present. Events of 3 January The Illustrated London News caption reads: \\"Scots Guards on active service in Sidney Street: Two of the men firing from a bedroom opposite the besieged house.\\" Just after midnight on 3 January, 200 police officers from the City of London and Metropolitan forces cordoned off the area around 100 Sidney Street. Armed officers were placed at number 111, directly opposite number 100, and throughout the night the residents of the houses on the block were roused and evacuated. Wensley woke the ground floor tenants at number 100 and asked them to fetch Gershon, claiming that she was needed by her sick husband. When Gershon appeared she was grabbed by the police and taken to the City of London police headquarters; the ground floor lodgers also evacuated. Number 100 was now empty of all residents, apart from Svaars and Sokoloff, neither of whom seemed to be aware of the evacuation. The police's operating procedure‚Äîand the law which governed their actions‚Äîmeant they were unable to open fire without being fired upon first. This, along with the structure of the building, which had a narrow, winding stairwell up which police would have to pass, meant any approach to the gang members was too perilous to attempt. It was decided to wait until dawn before taking any action. At about 7:30am a policeman knocked on the door of number 100, which elicited no response; stones were then thrown at the window to wake the men. Svaars and Sokoloff appeared at the window and opened fire at the police. A police sergeant was wounded in the chest: he was evacuated under fire across the rooftops, and taken to the London Hospital. Some members of the police returned fire, but their guns were only effective over shorter ranges, and proved ineffective against the comparatively advanced automatic weapons of Svaars and Sokoloff. By 9:00am it was apparent that the two gunmen possessed superior weapons and ample ammunition. The police officers in charge on the scene, Superintendent Mulvaney and Chief Superintendent Stark, contacted Assistant Commissioner Major Frederick Wodehouse at Scotland Yard. He telephoned the Home Office and obtained permission from Churchill to bring in a detachment of Scots Guards, who were stationed at the Tower of London. It was the first time that the police had requested military assistance in London to deal with an armed siege. Twenty- one volunteer marksmen from the Guards arrived at about 10:00am and took firing positions at each end of the street and in the houses opposite. The shooting continued without either side gaining any advantage. Churchill observing the events at Sidney Street Churchill arrived on the scene at 11:50am to observe the incident at first hand; he later reported that he thought the crowd were unwelcoming to him, as he heard people asking \\"Oo let 'em in?\\", in reference to the Liberal Party's immigration policy that had allowed the influx from Russia. Churchill's role during the siege is unclear. His biographers, Paul Addison and Roy Jenkins, both consider that he gave no operational commands to the police, but a Metropolitan police history of the event states that the events of Sidney Street were \\"a very rare case of a Home Secretary taking police operational command decisions\\". In a subsequent letter to The Times, Churchill clarified his role while he was present: > I did not interfere in any way with the dispositions made by the police > authorities on the spot. I never overruled those authorities nor overrode > them. From beginning to end the police had an absolutely free hand. ... I > did not send for the Artillery or the Engineers. I was not consulted as to > whether they should be sent for. Shooting between the two sides reached a peak between 12:00 and 12:30pm, but at 12:50 smoke was seen coming from the building's chimneys and from the second floor windows; it has not been established how the fire was started, whether by accident or design. The fire slowly spread, and by 1:30 it had taken a firm hold and had spread to the other floors. A second detachment of Scots Guards arrived, bringing with them a Maxim machine gun, which was never used. Shortly afterwards Sokoloff put his head out of the window; he was shot by one of the soldiers and he fell back inside. The senior officer of the London Fire Brigade present on the scene sought permission to extinguish the blaze, but was refused. He approached Churchill in order to have the decision overturned, but the Home Secretary approved the police decision. Churchill later wrote: Firemen tackle the fire at 100 Sidney Street after the end of the siege > I now intervened to settle this dispute, at one moment quite heated. I told > the fire-brigade officer on my authority as Home Secretary that the house > was to be allowed to burn down and that he was to stand by in readiness to > prevent the conflagration from spreading. By 2:30pm the shooting from the house had ceased. One of the detectives present walked close to the wall and pushed the door open, before retreating. Other police officers, and some of the soldiers, came out and waited for the men to exit. None did, and as part of the roof collapsed, it was clear to onlookers that the men were both dead; the fire brigade was allowed to start extinguishing the fire. At 2:40 Churchill left the scene, at about the time the Royal Horse Artillery arrived with two 13-pounder field artillery pieces. When the firemen entered the property to douse the flames, they soon located Sokoloff's body, which was extracted. A wall collapsed on a group of five firemen, who were all taken to the London Hospital. One of the men, Superintendent Charles Pearson, had a fractured spine; he died six months after the siege as a result of his injuries. After shoring up the building, the firemen resumed their search of the premises. At around 6:30pm the second body‚Äîthat of Svaars‚Äîwas found; it was taken to the mortuary. Aftermath Detectives inspect the house at 100 Sidney Street at the conclusion of the siege The siege was captured by Path√© News cameras‚Äîone of their earliest stories and the first siege to be captured on film‚Äîand it included footage of Churchill. When the newsreels were screened in cinemas, Churchill was booed with shouts of \\"shoot him\\" from audiences. His presence was controversial to many and the Leader of the Opposition, Arthur Balfour, remarked, \\"He [Churchill] was, I understand, in military phrase, in what is known as the zone of fire‚Äîhe and a photographer were both risking valuable lives. I understand what the photographer was doing, but what was the right hon. Gentleman doing? That I neither understood at the time, nor do I understand now.\\" Jenkins suggests that he went simply because \\"he could not resist going to see the fun himself\\". An inquest was held in January into the deaths at Houndsditch and Sidney Street. The jury took fifteen minutes to reach the conclusion that the two bodies located were those of Svaars and Sokoloff, that Tucker, Bentley and Choate had been murdered by Gardstein and others during the burglary attempt. Rosen was arrested on 2 February at work in Well Street, Hackney, and Hoffman was taken into custody on 15 February. The committal proceedings spread from December 1910‚Äîwith Milstein and Trassjonsky appearing‚Äîto March 1911, and included Hoffman from 15 February. The proceedings consisted of 24 individual hearings. In February Milstein was discharged on the basis that there was insufficient evidence against her; Hoffman, Trassjonsky and Federoff were released in March on the same basis. The case against the four remaining arrested gang members was heard at the Old Bailey by Mr Justice Grantham in May. Dubof and Peters were accused of Tucker's murder, Dubof, Peters, Rosen and Vassilleva were charged with \\"feloniously harbouring a felon guilty of murder\\" and for \\"conspiring and agreeing together and with others unknown to break and enter the shop of Henry Samuel Harris with intent to steal his goods\\". The case lasted for eleven days; there were problems with the proceedings because of the language difficulties and the chaotic personal lives of the accused. The case resulted in acquittals for all except Vassilleva, who was convicted of conspiracy in the burglary and sentenced to two years' imprisonment; her conviction was overturned on appeal. After the high levels of criticism aimed at the Aliens Act, Churchill decided to strengthen the legislation, and proposed the Aliens (Prevention of Crime) Bill under the Ten Minute Rule. The MP Josiah C Wedgwood objected, and wrote to Churchill to ask him not to introduce the hard-line measures \\"You know as well as I do that human life does not matter a rap in comparison with the death of ideas and the betrayal of English traditions.\\" The bill did not become law. Legacy The inadequacy of the police's firepower led to criticism in the press, and on 12 January 1911 several alternative weapons were tested. The trials resulted in the Metropolitan Police replacing the Webley revolver with the Webley & Scott .32 calibre MP semi-automatic pistol later that year; the City of London Police adopted the weapon in 1912. The members of the group dispersed after the events. Peter the Painter was never seen or heard from again. It was assumed he left the country, and there were several possible sightings in the years afterwards; none were confirmed. Jacob Peters returned to Russia, rose to be deputy head of the Cheka, the Soviet secret police, and was executed in Joseph Stalin's 1938 purge. Trassjonsky had a mental breakdown and was confined for a time at Colney Hatch Lunatic Asylum. Her eventual fate and date of death are unknown. Dubof, Federoff and Hoffmann disappeared from the records; Vassilleva remained in the East End for the remainder of her life and died at Brick Lane in 1963. Smoller left the country in 1911 and travelled to Paris, after which he disappeared; Milstein later emigrated to the United States. The siege was the inspiration for the final scene in Alfred Hitchcock's original 1934 version of The Man Who Knew Too Much; the story was heavily fictionalised in the 1960 film The Siege of Sidney Street. The siege was also the inspiration for two novels, The Siege of Sidney Street (1960) by F Oughton and A Death Out of Season (1973) by Emanuel Litvinoff. In September 2008 Tower Hamlets London Borough Council named two tower blocks in Sidney Street, Peter House and Painter House; Peter the Painter was only involved in a minor capacity in the events and was not present at the siege. The name plaques on the buildings call Peter the Painter an \\"anti-hero\\"; the decision angered the Metropolitan Police Federation. A council spokesman said that \\"There is no evidence that Peter the Painter killed the three policemen, so we knew we were not naming the block after a murderer. ... but he is the name that East Enders associate with the siege and Sidney Street.\\" In December 2010, on the centenary of the events at Houndsditch, a memorial plaque for the three murdered policemen was unveiled near the location. Three weeks later, on the anniversary of the siege, a plaque was unveiled in honour of Pearson, the fireman who died because the building collapsed on him.

Heminges and his sixteen-year-old wife settled in the parish of St Mary Aldermanbury, and had at least thirteen children there between the years 1590 and 1613.

Heminges also built and operated a taphouse at the Globe.. Heminges was mentioned in Shakespeare's will, along with Richard Burbage and Henry Condell, each being bequeathed 26 shillings and eightpence to buy mourning rings. Stanley Wells and others have wondered if that bequest represented a kind of pact for the three men to create and publish an edition of Shakespeare‚Äôs collected plays.Wells, Stanley.

As a sharer in the Globe Theatre, Heminges‚Äô name, along with the other sharers, is mentioned several times in various legal documents that were discovered by American researcher Charles William Wallace. The Globe was plagued by lawsuits as the shares were left to beneficiaries who did not have the continued welfare of the company at heart. In one such lawsuit, Heminges v. Ostler, Heminges was sued by his daughter, Thomasina Ostler over a share of the company. The surviving records do not specify the final outcome of the suit. At his death, Heminges‚Äô shares in the Globe and Blackfriars theatres passed to his son, William Heminges.Chambers, Vol. 2 , pp. 322‚Äì3. The lawsuit records are valuable to historians for the detailed information they contain regarding the company business.Aaron, Melissa, D.

Oxford University Press Work John Heminges and Henry Condell Memorial in London, commemorating their work with Shakespeare The extent and nature of Heminges' acting is not entirely clear. He is known to have performed in Ben Jonson's Sejanus and Every Man in His Humour (in both cases, alongside Shakespeare). A Jacobean inscription in the 1616 Jonson folio lists him playing the role of Corbaccio in Volpone; since the same list includes Nathan Field, who did not join the King's Men until 1616, it seems that Heminges continued to act, at least intermittently, into his fifties. Edmond Malone reported seeing Heminges' name associated with the role of Falstaff; there is, however, no other evidence of this connection. There is little more evidence to substantiate the claim later made by an actor to Alexander Pope that Heminges was a tragedian. Of his activities as manager more is known. Court documents relating to the King's Men generally list Heminges as the recipient of money due the company; the records of Henry Herbert indicate that Heminges at least sometimes served as the point of contact between the company and the Master of the Revels. He appears to have owned a structure abutting the Globe Theatre, which may have been used as an alehouse. He served as trustee for Shakespeare when the latter purchased a house in Blackfriars in 1613. References Notes * *Pam Hinks.

With John Heminges, he was instrumental in preparing and editing the First Folio, the collected plays of Shakespeare, published in 1623.Pogue, Kate. Shakespeare's Friends. Greenwood Publishing Group (2006) pp. 129-136 Life and career Condell's early life is obscure. It appears that he may have been from East Anglia, as his will mentions 'my Cosen Gilder late of newe Buckenham‚Äô. According to Edmond: > The only Henry Condell so far discovered at a suitable date in that part of > England was the son of a Robert Condell of St Peter Mancroft, Norwich, a > fishmonger, and his wife, Joan, n√©e Yeomans, of New Buckenham, a market town > not far from Norwich. Henry Condell, presumably their son, was baptized at > St Peter on 5 September 1576. Traditionally, he is associated with the \\"Harry\\" who appears in the cast list for Richard Tarlton's The Seven Deadly Sins, but this identification is little more than conjecture. If the connection is true, then Condell was an actor as early as 1590, acting in Lord Strange's Men alongside John Heminges and Augustine Phillips. Condell was definitely in London by 24 October 1596, when he married, at St Laurence Pountney, Elizabeth Smart (d.1635), the only child of John Smart of the Strand, gentleman. They settled in St Mary Aldermanbury, the parish in which Heminges lived. Condell, like Heminges, served as churchwarden in that church. Nine children were baptized there, born between 1599 and 1614, of whom only three survived to adulthood: Elizabeth (baptized 26 October 1606), who married Herbert Finch; Henry (baptized 6 May 1610, died 1630); and William (baptized 26 May 1611). Details of Condell's mature life, as is usual for Renaissance actors, are few. His status within the Lord Chamberlain's and King's companies appears to have been high; in official communications he is generally listed shortly after Burbage and Heminges. Actors' wills indicate that he was close to at least some of his colleagues in the company. Shakespeare and Phillips bequeathed him money for mourning rings; Nicholas Tooley and Alexander Cooke named him as trustee for their estates. Condell prospered enough in his profession to purchase a country home at Fulham in Middlesex and other property, including an estate called Brockhampton in Snowshill, Gloucestershire. The indentures recording the latter purchase contain the only known example of Condell's signature or handwriting apart from his last will. In addition to Every Man in His Humour (1598) and Every Man Out of His Humour (1599), Condell is known to have performed in four more of Jonson's plays: Sejanus (1603), Volpone (1605), The Alchemist (1610), and Catiline (1611). He was the original Cardinal in John Webster's The Duchess of Malfi (c. 1613). And he was listed in eight of the cast lists that were added to the second Beaumont and Fletcher folio of 1679: * Bonduca * The Captain * The Humorous Lieutenant * The Knight of Malta * The Loyal Subject * The Mad Lover * The Queen of Corinth * Valentinian John Heminges and Henry Condell Memorial in London, commemorating their work with Shakespeare Condell appears to have ended his stage career around 1619. He signed each of the nine sheets of his last will and testament on 13 December 1627. He died at Fulham aged 51, and was buried at St Mary Aldermanbury on 29 December 1627. His widow, Elizabeth, was buried there on 3 October 1635. Condell left an extensive estate, including shares in the Globe and Blackfriars Theatres. Fictional portrayals In the 2016 sitcom Upstart Crow, Henry Condell is played by Dominic Coleman. Notes References * *Collier, J. P.. Lives of the Original Actors in Shakespeare's Plays.

After supposedly fighting in and escaping the Sidney Street Siege in 1911, he became an anti-hero in London's East End. He was never caught, and there is some question as to whether he had participated in the Sidney Street incident, or even whether he actually existed at all. Biography In the late 19th and early 20th centuries London became a destination for many eastern European immigrants, who settled mostly in the East End. Ethnic groups joined together in gangs, and numerous immigrants continued radical political activities. They often stole in order to fund their politics. In the wake of the Houndsditch Murders in London on 16 December 1910, a member of the gang involved was found dead at a flat at which Peter Piatkow had lived with Fritz Svaars. Both of the latter men were believed to be members of a Latvian radical group. Svaars was the cousin of Jacob Peters, another Latvian far-leftist. In January 1911 the police were informed that Svaars and an accomplice were hiding out at 100 Sidney Street. They surrounded the area and laid siege to the building in order to flush out the radicals. Another member was \\"Peter the Painter\\", a nickname for an unknown figure, possibly named Peter Piaktow (or Piatkov, Pjatkov or Piaktoff), He used several aliases, including Schtern, Straume, Makharov and Dudkin or Janis Zhaklis. Bernard Porter, writing in the Dictionary of National Biography, states that no firm details are known of the anarchist's background and that \\"None of the ... biographical 'facts' about him ... is altogether reliable.\\" In 1988, based on research in the KGB archives, Philip Ruff, a historian of anarchism, suggested Peter the Painter might be ƒ¢ederts Eliass. He was a Latvian artist involved in the 1905 Revolution in Russia and was living in exile in England during the time of the Sidney Street Siege. He returned to Riga after the Bolshevik 1917 Revolution. More recently, Ruff has identified Peter the Painter as JƒÅnis ≈ΩƒÅklis (also spelled Janis Zhaklis or Zhakles), another Latvian far-leftist. Like Peters, Zhaklis was a member of the Latvian Social Democratic Workers' Party in 1905; among his exploits was gaining the escape of Fritz Svaars from prison in Riga. Zhaklis associated with Eliass in exile in Finland, where they were involved together in the robbery of the Russian State Bank branch in Helsinki. Zhaklis broke with the Social Democrats and became an anarchist. It is unclear what happened to him after 1911. In August 2012 Ruff published a book on the life of Janis Zhaklis; it was released by Dienas GrƒÅmata (in Latvian) as Pa stƒÅvu liesmu debesƒ´s: NenotveramƒÅ latvie≈°u anarhista Pƒìtera MƒÅldera laiks un dzƒ´ve (A Towering Flame: The Life & Times of Peter the Painter). This has been succeeded by an English-language edition, published by Breviary Stuff in 2019. Legacy and honours *The type of gun which Peter the Painter allegedly used at Sidney Street, a German Mauser C96 pistol, was sometimes called a Peter the Painter after him, particularly in Ireland during the War of Independence and later.The Independent, 17 February 2004 *In September 2008 Tower Hamlets London Borough Council named two tower blocks in Sidney Street, Peter House and Painter House, even though Peter the Painter was only involved in a minor capacity in the events, and was not present at the siege. A local councillor and the Metropolitan Police Federation protested against this, saying that the killer should not be recognised. *The song \\"Peter the Painter\\", by Ian Dury and the Blockheads, is unrelated, referring instead to the artist Peter Blake. In popular culture *Peter the Painter was portrayed by Peter Wyngarde in the 1960 film The Siege of Sidney Street, about the anarchist movement and the police action. *Peter Piatkow aka Peter the Painter is a key character in part of Gavin Lyall's 1993 novel Spy's Honour. In the second part of the novel \\"Climbing Spy Hill\\" he is the leader of a group of Irish fenians attempting to rob the Royal Navy depot at Queenstown port, Ireland. Piatkow is portrayed unsympathetically, planning on killing all the people, including the domestic staff, at the naval commander's residence, and his own confederates, so that he can keep all the proceeds of the robbery for himself. *Peter the Painter is featured as a character in the 4th episode of the Australian murder mysteries series, Miss Fisher's Murder Mysteries. In this episode‚Äî\\"Death at Victoria Dock\\", involving the murder of a Latvian anarchist in Melbourne's docks in the mid 1920s‚ÄîPeter is identified to Phryne Fisher in a club as the man involved in the Sidney Street Siege in London. He is a key character in the episode. The original book published by Kerry Greenwood includes an audiobook interview with the author who explains that in earlier original research she interviewed two wharfies who had worked at the Melbourne docks in the 1920s and who confirmed the rumor that Peter the Painter had lived in exile there. *The character Peter the Painter is portrayed by Drago»ô Bucur in the 2012 ITV drama Titanic. Peter is sailing on the ship in an attempt to escape England for the United States. Aboard the ship he has a romantic encounter with the wife of a fellow passenger and murders another when confronted about his identity. He is also central in orchestrating an uprising amongst the 3rd class passengers when they are prevented from boarding the lifeboats. * Peter the Painter is one of the members of the Council of Seven Days (originally from G.K. Chesterton's The Man Who Was Thursday) in Kim Newman's graphic novel Anno Dracula: 1895.

Lepontic is an ancient Alpine Celtic language that was spoken in parts of Rhaetia and Cisalpine Gaul (what is now Northern Italy) between 550 and 100 BC. Lepontic is attested in inscriptions found in an area centered on Lugano, Switzerland, and including the Lake Como and Lake Maggiore areas of Italy. Lepontic is a Celtic language.LinguistList: LeponticJohn T. Koch (ed.) Celtic culture: a historical encyclopedia ABC-CLIO (2005) While some recent scholarship (e.g. Eska 1998) has tended to consider it simply as an early outlying form of Gaulish and closely akin to other, later attestations of Gaulish in Italy (Cisalpine Gaulish), some scholars (notably Lejeune 1971) continue to view it as a distinct Continental Celtic language.Koch 2006; 1142. Within this latter view, the earlier inscriptions found within a 50 km radius of Lugano are considered Lepontic, while the later ones, to the immediate south of this area, are considered Cisalpine Gaulish. Lepontic was assimilated first by Gaulish, with the settlement of Gaulish tribes north of the River Po, and then by Latin, after the Roman Republic gained control over Gallia Cisalpina during the late 2nd and 1st century BC. Classification Some scholars view (e.g. Lejeune 1971, Koch 2008) Lepontic as a distinct Continental Celtic language. Other scholars (e.g. Evans 1992, Solinas 1995, Eska 1996, McCone 1996, Matasovic 2009) consider it as an early form of Cisalpine Gaulish (or Cisalpine Celtic) and thus a dialect of the Gaulish language. An earlier view, which was prevalent for most of the 20th century and until about 1970, regarded Lepontic as a \\"para-Celtic\\" western Indo-European language, akin to but not part of Celtic, possibly related to Ligurian (Whatmough 1933 and Pisani 1964). However, Ligurian itself has been considered akin to, but not descended from, Common Celtic, see Kruta 1991 and Stifter 2008. Referring to linguistic arguments as well as archaeological evidence, Schumacher even considers Lepontic a primary branch of Celtic, perhaps even the first language to diverge from Proto-Celtic. In any case, the Lepontic inscriptions are the earliest attestation of any form of Celtic. Language =The alphabet= The alphabets of Este (Venetic), Magr√® and Bolzano/Bozen-Sanzeno (Raetic), Sondrio (Camunic), Lugano (Lepontic) The alphabet of Lugano, based on inscriptions found in northern Italy and Canton Ticino, was used to record Lepontic inscriptions, among the oldest testimonies of any Celtic language, in use from the 7th to the 5th centuries BC. The alphabet has 18 letters, derived from the archaic Etruscan alphabet The alphabet does not distinguish voiced and unvoiced occlusives, i.e. P represents /b/ or /p/, T is for /t/ or /d/, and K for /g/ or /k/. Z is probably for /ts/. U /u/ and V /w/ are distinguished. Œò is probably for /t/ and X for /g/. There are claims of a related script discovered in Glozel. Corpus Lepontic is known from around 140 inscriptions written in the alphabet of Lugano, one of five main Northern Italic alphabets derived from the Etruscan alphabet. Similar scripts were used for writing the Rhaetic and Venetic languages and the Germanic runic alphabets probably derive from a script belonging to this group. The grouping of all inscriptions written in the alphabet of Lugano into a single language is disputed. Indeed, it was not uncommon in antiquity for a given alphabet to be used to write multiple languages. And, in fact, the alphabet of Lugano was used in the coinage of other Alpine tribes, such as the Salassi, Salluvii, and Cavares (Whatmough 1933, Lejeune 1971). While many of the later inscriptions clearly appear to be written in Cisalpine Gaulish, some, including all of the older ones, are said to be in an indigenous language distinct from Gaulish and known as Lepontic. Until the publication of Lejeune 1971, this Lepontic language was regarded as a pre-Celtic language, possibly related to Ligurian (Whatmough 1933, Pisani 1964). Following Lejeune 1971, the consensus view became that Lepontic should be classified as a Celtic language, albeit possibly as divergent as Celtiberian, and in any case quite distinct from Cisalpine Gaulish (Lejeune 1971, Kruta 1991, Stifter 2008). Some have gone further, considering Lepontic and Cisalpine Gaulish essentially one and the same (Eska 1998). However, an analysis of the geographic distribution of the inscriptions shows that the Cisalpine Gaulish inscriptions are later and from an area to the south of the earlier (Lepontic) inscriptions, with which they display significant differences as well as similarities. While the language is named after the tribe of the Lepontii, which occupied portions of ancient Rhaetia, specifically an Alpine area straddling modern Switzerland and Italy and bordering Cisalpine Gaul, the term is currently used by some Celticists (e.g. Eska 1998) to apply to all Celtic dialects of ancient Italy. This usage is disputed by those who continue to view the Lepontii as one of several indigenous pre-Roman tribes of the Alps, quite distinct from the Gauls who invaded the plains of Northern Italy in historical times. The older Lepontic inscriptions date back to before the 5th century BC, the item from Castelletto Ticino being dated at the 6th century BC and that from Sesto Calende possibly being from the 7th century BC (Prosdocimi, 1991). The people who made these inscriptions are nowadays identified with the Golasecca culture, a Celtic culture in northern Italy (De Marinis 1991, Kruta 1991 and Stifter 2008). The extinction date for Lepontic is only inferred by the absence of later inscriptions. Texts Lepontic alphabet See also * Cisalpine Celtic * Glozel tablets References Sources * De Marinis, R.C.

For active tuberculosis it is often used together with rifampicin, pyrazinamide, and either streptomycin or ethambutol. For latent tuberculosis it is often used by itself. It may also be used for atypical types of mycobacteria, such as M. avium, M. kansasii, and M. xenopi. It is usually taken by mouth but may be used by injection into muscle. Common side effect include increased blood levels of liver enzymes and numbness in the hands and feet. Serious side effects may include liver inflammation and acute liver failure. It is unclear if use during pregnancy is safe for the baby. Use during breastfeeding is likely safe. Pyridoxine may be given to reduce the risk of side effects. Isoniazid works in part by disrupting the formation of the bacteria's cell wall which results in cell death. Isoniazid was first made in 1952. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. The World Health Organization classifies isoniazid as critically important for human medicine. Isoniazid is available as a generic medication. Medical uses =Tuberculosis= Isoniazid is often used to treat latent and active tuberculosis infections. In persons with isoniazid-sensitive Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection, drug regimens based on isoniazid are usually effective when persons adhere to the prescribed treatment. However, in persons with isoniazid-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection, drug regimens based on isoniazid have a high rate of failure. Isoniazid has been approved as prophylactic therapy for the following populations: * People with HIV infection and a PPD (purified protein derivative) reaction of at least 5 mm induration * Contacts of people with tuberculosis and who have a PPD reaction at least 5 mm induration * People whose PPD reactions convert from negative to positive in a two-year period ‚Äì at least 10 mm induration for those up to 35 years of age, and at least 15 mm induration for those at least 35 years old * People with pulmonary damage on their chest X-ray that is likely to be due to healed tuberculosis and also have a PPD reaction at least 5 mm induration * Injection drug users whose HIV status is negative who have a PPD reaction at least 10 mm induration * People with a PPD of greater than or equal to 10 mm induration who are foreign-born from high prevalence geographical regions, low-income populations, and patients residing in long-term facilities Isoniazid can be used alone or in combination with Rifampin for treatment of latent tuberculosis, or as part of a four-drug regimen for treatment of active tuberculosis. The drug regimen typically requires daily or weekly oral administration for a period of three to nine months, often under Directly Observed Therapy (DOT) supervision. =Non-tuberculous mycobacteria= Isoniazid was widely used in the treatment of Mycobacterium avium complex as part of a regimen including rifampicin and ethambutol. Evidence suggests that isoniazid prevents mycolic acid synthesis in M. avium complex as in M. tuberculosis and although this is not bactericidal to M. avium complex, it greatly potentiates the effect of rifampicin. The introduction of macrolides led to this use greatly decreasing. However, since rifampicin is broadly underdosed in M. avium complex treatment this effect may be worth re- investigating. =Special populations= It is recommended that women with active tuberculosis who are pregnant or breastfeeding take isoniazid. Preventive therapy should be delayed until after giving birth. Nursing mothers excrete a relatively low and non-toxic concentration of INH in breast milk, and their babies are at low risk for side effects. Both pregnant women and infants being breastfed by mothers taking INH should take vitamin B6 in its pyridoxine form to minimize the risk of peripheral nerve damage. Vitamin B6 is used to prevent isoniazid-induced B6 deficiency and neuropathy in people with a risk factor, such as pregnancy, lactation, HIV infection, alcoholism, diabetes, kidney failure, or malnutrition. People with liver dysfunction are at a higher risk for hepatitis caused by INH, and may need a lower dose. Levels of liver enzymes in the bloodstream should be frequently checked in daily alcohol drinkers, pregnant women, IV drug users, people over 35, and those who have chronic liver disease, severe kidney dysfunction, peripheral neuropathy, or HIV infection since they are more likely to develop hepatitis from INH. Side effects Up to 20% of people taking isoniazid experience peripheral neuropathy when taking doses of 6 mg/kg of weight daily or higher. Gastrointestinal reactions include nausea and vomiting. Aplastic anemia, thrombocytopenia, and agranulocytosis due to lack of production of red blood cells, platelets, and white blood cells by the bone marrow respectively, can also occur. Hypersensitivity reactions are also common and can present with a maculopapular rash and fever. Gynecomastia may occur. Asymptomatic elevation of serum liver enzyme concentrations occurs in 10% to 20% of people taking INH, and liver enzyme concentrations usually return to normal even when treatment is continued. Isoniazid has a boxed warning for severe and sometimes fatal hepatitis, which is age-dependent at a rate of 0.3% in people 21 to 35 years old and over 2% in those over age 50.Trevor, A. & Katzung, B. (2013). Katzung & Trevor's Pharmacology: examination & board review (10th ed., p. 417). New York. McGraw-Hill Medical, Lange. Symptoms suggestive of liver toxicity include nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, dark urine, right upper quadrant pain, and loss of appetite. Black and Hispanic women are at higher risk for isoniazid-induced hepatotoxicity. When it happens, isoniazid-induced liver toxicity has been shown to occur in 50% of patients within the first 2 months of therapy. Some recommend that liver function should be monitored carefully in all people receiving it, but others recommend monitoring only in certain populations. Headache, poor concentration, weight gain, poor memory, insomnia, and depression have all been associated with isoniazid use. All patients and healthcare workers should be aware of these serious side effects, especially if suicidal ideation or behavior are suspected. Isoniazid is associated with pyridoxine (vitamin B6) deficiency because of its similar structure. Isoniazid is also associated with increased excretion of pyridoxine. Pyridoxal phosphate (a derivative of pyridoxine) is required for Œ¥-aminolevulinic acid synthase, the enzyme responsible for the rate-limiting step in heme synthesis. Therefore, isoniazid-induced pyridoxine deficiency causes insufficient heme formation in early red blood cells, leading to sideroblastic anemia. Drug interactions People taking isoniazid and acetaminophen are at risk of acetaminophen toxicity. Isoniazid is thought to induce a liver enzyme which causes a larger amount of acetaminophen to be metabolized to a toxic form. Isoniazid decreases the metabolism of carbamazepine, thus slowing down its clearance from the body. People taking carbamazepine should have their carbamazepine levels monitored and, if necessary, have their dose adjusted accordingly. It is possible that isoniazid may decrease the serum levels of ketoconazole after long-term treatment. This is seen with the simultaneous use of rifampin, isoniazid, and ketoconazole. Isoniazid may increase the amount of phenytoin in the body. The doses of phenytoin may need to be adjusted when given with isoniazid. Isoniazid may increase the plasma levels of theophylline. There are some cases of theophylline slowing down isoniazid elimination. Both theophylline and isoniazid levels should be monitored. Valproate levels may increase when taken with isoniazid. Valproate levels should be monitored and its dose adjusted if necessary. Mechanism of action Isoniazid is a prodrug that inhibits the formation of the mycobacterial cell wall. Isoniazid must be activated by KatG, a bacterial catalase-peroxidase enzyme in Mycobacterium tuberculosis. KatG catalyzes the formation of the isonicotinic acyl radical, which spontaneously couples with NADH to form the nicotinoyl-NAD adduct. This complex binds tightly to the enoyl-acyl carrier protein reductase InhA, thereby blocking the natural enoyl-AcpM substrate and the action of fatty acid synthase. This process inhibits the synthesis of mycolic acids, which are required components of the mycobacterial cell wall. A range of radicals are produced by KatG activation of isoniazid, including nitric oxide, which has also been shown to be important in the action of another antimycobacterial prodrug pretomanid. 500px Isoniazid is bactericidal to rapidly dividing mycobacteria, but is bacteriostatic if the mycobacteria are slow-growing. It inhibits the cytochrome P450 system and hence acts as a source of free radicals. Isoniazid is a mild monoamine oxidase inhibitor(MAO-I). Metabolism Isoniazid reaches therapeutic concentrations in serum, cerebrospinal fluid, and within caseous granulomas. It is metabolized in the liver via acetylation into acetylhydrazine. Two forms of the enzyme are responsible for acetylation, so some patients metabolize the drug more quickly than others. Hence, the half- life is bimodal, with \\"slow acetylators\\" and \\"fast acetylators\\". A graph of number of people versus time shows peaks at one and three hours. The height of the peaks depends on the ethnicities of the people being tested. The metabolites are excreted in the urine. Doses do not usually have to be adjusted in case of renal failure. History First synthesis was described in 1912. A. Kachugin invented the drug against tuberculosis under name Tubazid. Three pharmaceutical companies unsuccessfully attempted to patent the drug at the same time, the most prominent one being Roche, which launched its version, Rimifon, in 1952. With the introduction of isoniazid, a cure for tuberculosis was first considered possible. The drug was first tested at Many Farms, a Navajo community in Arizona, due to the Navajo reservation's tuberculosis problem and because the population had not previously been treated with streptomycin, the main tuberculosis treatment at the time. The research was led by Walsh McDermott, an infectious disease researcher with an interest in public health, who had previously taken isoniazid to treat his own tuberculosis. Isoniazid and a related drug, iproniazid, were among the first drugs to be referred to as antidepressants. Preparation Isoniazid is an isonicotinic acid derivative. It is manufactured using 4-cyanopyridine and hydrazine hydrate. In another method, isoniazid was claimed to have been made from citric acid starting material. Brand names Hydra, Hyzyd, Isovit, Laniazid, Nydrazid, Rimifon, and Stanozide. Other uses =Chromatography= Isonicotinic acid hydrazide is also used in chromatography to differentiate between various degrees of conjugation in organic compounds barring the ketone functional group. The test works by forming a hydrazone which can be detected by its bathochromic shift. =Dogs= Isoniazid may be used for dogs, but there have been concerns it can cause seizures.

Within the park are over 25 miles of hiking trails, rock formations, waterfalls, and recess caves. The trails are open from dawn to dusk, all year round including holidays. The park contains seven separate hiking areas: Ash Cave, Cantwell Cliffs, Cedar Falls, Conkle's Hollow (nature preserve), Old Man's Cave, Rock House and Hemlock Bridge Trail to Whispering Cave. History The name Hocking Hills Hocking County was named after the Hockhocking River. Hockhocking, in the Delaware tongue, signifies a bottle. In Shawnee, Wea-tha-Kagh-Qua-sepe, meant bottle river. The Hockhocking River had a waterfall of nearly 20 feet located about 6 or 7 miles northwest of Lancaster. Above the falls, the creek was very narrow and straight, forming the \\"bottle\\" neck. The Hockhocking enters the county from Good Hope Township in the northwest and then flows southwest, touches Marion Township, continues through Falls and Green Townships, and exits the county through northwestern Starr Township. The river is then in Athens County. History: The Adena culture is believed to be one of the first inhabitants of the area of Hocking Hills 1700s - Native American Tribes of Delaware, Wyandot, and Shawnee travelled through and lived in the area 1818 - Hocking County created in Ohio 1830s - Powder mill was built 1840 - Hocking Canal was completed allowing for more settlers to travel there 1924 - After local popular hiking areas were threatened by the accessibility of more traffic, the State Forest Law was passed in 1915 allowing the state to purchase the first parcel of land in Hocking Hills around Old Man's Cave. Old Man's Cave History of the Park More than 330 million years ago, the Hocking Hills State Park area was relatively level and was covered by the waters of the Atlantic Ocean. For millions of years, the ocean's currents deposited immense amounts of sand and gravel. After millions of years, the ocean receded, and the sandy layers bonded with silica to form the Black Hand Sandstone that underlies the area. It formed like a sandwich, with a hard top and bottom and a soft middle layer. When the Appalachian Mountains arose, form and feature were cast upon the area and created Hocking Hills State Park. Hocking Hills State Park was hemmed in by the ancient north-flowing Teahs River to the west, and the then north-flowing Hocking to the east. The landscape remained fairly static for millions of years. Any changes were minuscule, and were slow to develop. When the Wisconsin Glacier began melting back to the north about 10,000 years ago, the landscape would undergo dramatic changes. The glacier stopped in northern Hocking County, so the area suffered indescribable flooding. The ancient Teahs River was buried under tons of glacial silt, and the direction of the Hocking River was reversed. When the glacial torrents found cracks in the hard capstone, the water poured through to flush out the soft middle layer. This left long tunnels where the gorges are today. Eventually, the weight of the tops caused them to come crashing down. The \\"slump rocks\\" in the gorges today are what's left of the hard top layer. In just a few centuries, the rushing waters of the glacier carved the soft middle layer of sandstone into the myriad dimples and wrinkles that decorate the cliffs and grottos today. Early settlers in Muskingum County found an ancient black human handprint on a cliff that is part of this same sandstone formation. That is the same \\"Black Hand Sandstone\\" that is seen in six areas of the Hocking Hills State Park. Tourist accommodations There are about 200 campsites in the park, most equipped with electricity. The campground is close to all of the hiking trails in the area and has flush toilets, shower houses with hot water, vending machines, a camp store, a pool, and other amenities. The area also has many cabins and hotels in this area. In 2017, over 2 million people visited Hocking Hills. To handle the growing tourism, a summer shuttle service from Downtown Logan began to lessen the overtaxing on the park's parking facilities. The Ohio Department of Natural Resources (ODNR) broke ground on a new visitors' center. The $6 million project is scheduled to be completed in December 2018. Attractions The Ash Cave complex The area is very popular with tourists and collectively is known as the Hocking Hills Region. It features many private inns, campgrounds, cabins, restaurants, and other related businesses, including a recently developed zipline. Other attractions include: *Nature Preserves and State Parks: Nearby are also other attractions of the Hocking Hills, including Hocking State Forest, Conkles Hollow State Nature Preserve, Lake Logan State Park, and Rockbridge State Nature Preserve. The deep gorges and high cliffs result from the erosion-resistant Blackhand Sandstone, which extends well to the northeast of the Hocking Hills. Other open-space areas have been established within the range of the Blackhand, including Lake Katharine State Nature Preserve. * Lakes: Lake Logan in Hocking Hills State Park covers 400 acres, 320 acres of which is dry land, and is two miles long. The lake was built in 1955 for recreational purposes and offers visitors hiking, boating, picnicking and swimming. * Canoeing and kayaking are popular activities in the Hocking Hills * Boating: Canoeing, kayaking and rafting are all allowed on various places in the state park. * Rock Climbing and Rappelling: Ninety-nine acres of forest land have been set aside for rock clim bing and rappelling in Hocking State Forest. * Swimming: Lake Logan and Rose Lake offer swimming and beaches for visitors. There is also a swimming pool open to the public outside of the Hocking Hills State Park lodge. * Hunting and fishing: Hunting and fishing are permitted as regulated by the Division of Wildlife. With permits, visitors are allowed to hunt during hunting season. Fishing is permitted in Lake Logan, which can include a variety of fish such as bluegill, crappie, bass, saugeye and catfish. Cedar Falls * Bird Watching: Hocking Valley Birding Trail identifies opportunities for bird watchers to enjoy the avian life in Hocking Hills. * Archery: The Hocking Hills State Park offers a free archery range. * Air Tours: Hocking Hills Scenic Air Tours offers airplane rides with views of the State Park. * Horseback Riding: Hocking Hills State Park provides horseback riding trails that share space with both hiking trails and hunting areas. * Train Rides: The trains of the Hocking Valley Scenic Railway provide visitors a glimpse into the transportation and industrial history of the Hocking Hills area. * Weddings: Some individuals have chosen to use the State Park as their outdoor wedding ceremony location. * Canopy Tours: Nearby the State Park is Hocking Hills Canopy Tours, an outdoor zipline tour that offers three different rides: a SuperZip, Nightflight and traditional canopy tour. The Hocking Hills region was recently named the Canopy Tour Capital of the Midwest. * Astronomy: The John Glenn Astronomy Park, named after astronaut and US Senator John Glenn, opened in June 2018. During the day, visitors can study the position of the sun and orientation throughout the year. At night, visitors can see the planets and stars not being obstructed by light pollution. Flora Upper Falls at Old Man's Cave. Several rare plants are known from this area, including plants that are outside their normal range. Canadian yew, bigleaf magnolia, and many others are here. Trails There are numerous hiking trails, including several safe for pets, located throughout the state park. Some trails in Hocking Hills State Park include: * Old Man's Cave: 1 mile * Ash Cave Gorge: mile, wheelchair accessible * Ash Cave Rim: mile * Cedar Falls: mile * Rock House: 1 mile * Cantwell Cliffs: 1 mile * Conkle's Hollow: 1 mile * Conkle's Hollow Rim: 2 miles * Buckeye Trail: Cedar Falls ‚Äì Ash Cave: 3 miles, Old Man's Cave ‚Äì Cedar Falls: 3 miles In popular culture Lower Falls at Old Man's Cave. Many of the adventures in Jeff Smith's comic book series Bone take place in Old Man's Cave, a place inspired by the Hocking Hills State Park, which Smith enjoyed since he was a child. The waterfalls of the park also influenced Smith's frequent use of water as a recurring visual element in Bone, calling it \\"an age-old storytelling symbol\\". Other public lands View inside Rock House. As noted, Hocking Hills State Park is embedded within the Hocking State Forest. Crane Hollow Nature Preserve, a private preserve, fills in a large part of the non-public area. On the south side, Camp Oti-Okwa, owned by Big Brothers-Big Sisters, is also a sizeable protected area. There are three state nature preserves within the Forest, but only Conkles Hollow State Nature Preserve is open to the public. Also nearby are Clear Creek Metro Park, Lake Logan State Park, and Rockbridge State Nature Preserve.

The word Zeus was dropped before the band started recording, as the members decided it was too long to look good on a T-shirt. There were a few personnel changes in the early days, but since 1986 the lineup has remained relatively stable (with only the drummer changing several times since then) and the band were still active as of 2020. History The band were active in the progressive rock revival spearheaded by the likes of Marillion, Pallas, Solstice and Twelfth Night in the early 1980s, and indeed (like their peers IQ) often appeared as support acts to Marillion and other major neo-prog bands, both on tours and at the Marquee venue which hosted many regular prog evenings. After their debut album The Jewel, the band pursued a more commercial direction, documented in the Kowtow album and the Red Shoes and Saved By You EPs, but despite these efforts failed to break through to a mainstream audience. The group appeared at the 1983 Reading Festival and were signed to Elusive Records. In 1991, the band established their own label, Toff Records, and released the archival release The Rest of Pendragon, a collection of EP tracks, and the studio album The World, in which they returned to a more progressive style that the band would continue to develop over their next three studio albums, The Window of Life, The Masquerade Overture, and Not Of This World. From this point on their fortunes have improved, and while they are still relatively obscure in their home country they have a significant following in Europe; in particular, they have managed to develop a strong fanbase in Poland, and have both released at least one compilation specifically for the Polish market and recorded several live albums there. In 2002, the band released Acoustically Challenged, documenting an \\"unplugged\\" session with a number of the band's songs retooled for acoustic instruments, which was originally broadcast on Radio 3 Warsaw. This was considered an unusual move for a progressive rock band, since progressive rock tends to focus a lot on the use of electronic synthesisers and electric guitars; however, the melodic qualities of the band's compositions proved to be well- suited to an acoustic context, and the album was reasonably successful. This heralded a new willingness to experiment on the part of the band, following a run of studio albums all broadly in the same vein as The World. On 2005's Believe they took their music in a somewhat darker direction, causing a certain amount of controversy amongst their fans. 2008's Pure, which featured elements of progressive metal, refined the style of Believe and was well received by the progressive rock fandom, being voted Album of the Year 2008 on DPRP. On the community website progarchives.com Pure enjoyed the current \\"most popular album\\" spot for a period in 2008, and remains in the site's top 10 prog releases of 2008 (as voted by site users). On 21 April 2009, Pendragon released a live album and DVD, Concerto Maximo, shot in Katowice on 13 October 2008. It was filmed and edited by Metal Mind. It was released in several versions - a 2-CD release that features just the audio from the show, a DVD featuring the full show, and a DVD-and-2-CD special edition, which was limited to 1000 copies. In October 2010, the band recorded the follow-up to Pure, the album Passion which was released in the spring of 2011. This was followed by Men Who Climb Mountains in 2014. Both albums continued the darker, heavier, more progressive metal-influenced direction of the band. In April 2014, the band announced that they had parted ways with drummer Scott Higham for \\"personal reasons\\". He was then replaced by Craig Blundell. In June 2015, Blundell was replaced by Jan-Vincent Velazco. In September 2019 the band released a 40th Anniversary boxed set containing five compact discs. The first three represent a complete live concert recording made in London during 2018. The remaining two discs are re-mixed and remastered versions of the albums The World and Men Who Climb Mountains. In February 2020, a new album called Love Over Fear was released.

The battle was fought between the defending forces of the Habsburg Monarchy under the leadership of Nikola IV Zrinski (, ), former Ban of Croatia, and the invading Ottoman army under the nominal command of Sultan Suleiman the Magnificent ( S√ºleymƒÅn). After the Battle of Moh√°cs in 1526, which resulted in the end of the independent Kingdom of Hungary, Ferdinand I was elected King by the nobles of both Hungary and Croatia. This was followed by a series of conflicts with the Habsburgs and their allies, fighting against the Ottoman Empire. In the Little War in Hungary both sides exhausted themselves after sustaining heavy casualties. The Ottoman campaign in Hungary ceased until the offensive against Szigetv√°r. In January 1566 Suleiman went to war for the last time. The siege of Szigetv√°r was fought from 5 August to 8 September 1566 and, though it resulted in an Ottoman victory, there were heavy losses on both sides. Both commanders died during the battle‚ÄîZrinski in the final charge and Suleiman in his tent from natural causes.It is generally accepted that Suleiman died in his tent behind the siege lines from natural causes, before the Turks achieved victory. According to George F. Nafziger, Suleiman died of a heart attack when learned of his victory. According to Stephen Turnbull, several contemporary accounts, such as the ones used later by Nicholas VII Zrinski for his epic, attribute Suleiman's death to Zrinski's hand. More than 20,000 Ottomans had fallen during the attacks and almost all of Zrinski's 2,300-man garrison was killed, with most of the final 600 men killed on the last day.Lieber (1845), p. 345. Although the battle was an Ottoman victory, it stopped the Ottoman push to Vienna that year. Vienna was not threatened again until the Battle of Vienna in 1683. The importance of the battle was considered so great that the French clergyman and statesman Cardinal Richelieu was reported to have described it as \\"the battle that saved (Western) civilization\\". The battle is still famous in Croatia and Hungary and inspired both the Hungarian epic poem The Siege of Sziget and the Croatian opera Nikola ≈†ubiƒá Zrinski.Cornis-Pope and Neubauer (2004), pp. 518‚Äì522. Background Artistic impression of Szigetv√°r by Daniel Meisner and Eberhard Kieser, 1625 On 29 August 1526 the forces of the Kingdom of Hungary led by King Louis II were defeated at the Battle of Moh√°cs by Ottoman forces led by Sultan Suleiman the Magnificent.Turnbull (2003), p. 49 Louis died in the battle which resulted in the end of the independent Kingdom of Hungary, as he died without an heir. Both Hungary and Croatia became disputed territories with claims from both the Habsburg and Ottoman empires. Ferdinand I from the House of Habsburg, brother of Holy Roman Emperor Charles V, married the sister of Louis IITurnbull (2003), pp. 49‚Äì51. and was elected King by the nobles of both Hungary and Croatia.Corvisier and Childs (1994), p. 289Milan Kruhek: Cetin, grad izbornog sabora Kraljevine Hrvatske 1527, Karlovaƒçka ≈Ωupanija, 1997, Karlovac The throne of Hungary became the subject of a dynastic dispute between Ferdinand and John Z√°polya from Transylvania. Suleiman had promised to make Z√°polya the ruler of all Hungary.Turnbull (2003), pp. 55‚Äì56. Ferdinand set out to enforce his claim on Hungary and captured Buda from John Z√°polya in 1527, only to relinquish his hold on it in 1529 when an Ottoman counter-attack stripped Ferdinand of all his territorial gains during 1527 and 1528. The Siege of Vienna in 1529 was the first attempt by Suleiman the Magnificent to capture the Austrian capital. This siege signalled the pinnacle of Ottoman power and the maximum extent of Ottoman expansion in central Europe. =Little War= Artistic impression of the battle of Szigetv√°r by Antonio Lafreri, 1566 The years from 1529 to 1552 were known as the \\"Little War\\". Following Suleiman's unsuccessful siege of Vienna in 1529, Ferdinand launched a counter- attack in 1530 to regain the initiative. An assault on Buda was driven off by John Z√°polya, although Ferdinand was successful elsewhere‚Äîcapturing Gran (Esztergom) and other forts along the Danube river, a vital strategic frontier. Suleiman's response came in 1532 when he led a massive army of over 120,000 troops to besiege Vienna again. Ferdinand withdrew his army, leaving only 700 men with no cannons and a few guns to defend G√ºns (Koszeg) although Ibrahim Pasha, the Grand Vizier of the Ottomans, did not realize how poorly defended Koszeg was. Suleiman came to join him shortly after the Siege of G√ºns had started. For more than 25 days, Croatian captain Nikola Juri≈°iƒá and his garrison of 800 Croats held out against 19 full-scale assaults and an incessant bombardment by the over 120,000 Ottomans. As a result, the city was offered a surrender on favourable terms and, although the offer was rejected, the Ottomans retreated√Ågoston and Alan Masters (2009), p. 583According to Stephen Turnbull, the city was offered terms for a nominal surrender. The only Ottomans who would be allowed to enter the castle would be a token force who would raise the Turkish flag. Anyway, Suleiman withdrew at the arrival of the August rains, and did not continue towards Vienna as previously planned, but homeward. leading to a peace treaty between Ferdinand and Suleiman. John Z√°polya was recognized as the King of Hungary by the Habsburgs, although as an Ottoman vassal. The treaty did not satisfy either John Z√°polya or Ferdinand, and their armies began skirmishes along the borders. In 1537, Ferdinand attacked John's forces at Osijek in violation of the treaty. The siege was a disaster of similar magnitude to that of Moh√°cs, with an Ottoman relief army smashing the Austrians. Rather than attack Vienna again, Suleiman attacked Otranto in southern Italy. At the naval Battle of Preveza in 1538, the Ottomans inflicted another defeat on the Habsburg-led coalition.Turnbull (2003), p. 52. John Z√°polya died in 1540 and was succeeded by his infant son John II Sigismund Z√°polya. For much of his reign, the country was governed by his mother Isabella Jagiellon, with continued support from Suleiman. John II remained the nominal King of Hungary until he abdicated in 1570 and returned the country to Habsburg rule. A further humiliating defeat was inflicted on the Habsburgs in the 1541 Siege of Buda, when the Ottomans responded to a request for help from Isabella Jagiellon. In April 1543, Suleiman launched another campaign in Hungary, taking back Bran and other forts and returning much of Hungary to Ottoman control. In August 1543, the Ottomans succeeded in the Siege of Esztergom, which was followed by the capture of three Hungarian cities: Sz√©kesfeh√©rv√°r, Sikl√≥s, and Szeged, offering better security for Buda. Another peace agreement between the Habsburgs and the Ottomans lasted until 1552, when Suleiman decided to attack Eger. The siege proved futile, and the Habsburg victory reversed a period of territorial losses in Hungary. Their retention of Eger gave the Austrians good reason to believe that Hungary was still contested ground and the Ottoman campaign in Hungary ended, until its revival in 1566.

He was 72 years old and, although having gout to the extent that he was carried on a litter, he nominally commanded his thirteenth military campaign. On 1 May 1566 the Sultan left Constantinople at the head of one of the largest armies he had ever commanded. His opposite number, Count Nikola IV Zrinski, was one of the largest landholders in the Kingdom of Croatia, a seasoned veteran of border warfare, and a Ban (Croatian royal representative) from 1542 to 1556.Krokar Slide Set #27, image 42 In his early life he distinguished himself in the Siege of Vienna and pursued a successful military career. Suleiman's forces reached Belgrade on 27 June after a forty-nine-day march. Here he met with John II Sigismund Z√°polya who he earlier promised to make the ruler of all Hungary. Learning of Zrinski's success in an attack upon a Turkish encampment at Sikl√≥s, Suleiman decided to postpone his attack on Eger () and instead attack Zrinski's fortress at Szigetv√°r to eliminate him as a threat.Setton (1991), pp. 845‚Äì846. =Siege= The advanced guard of the Turks arrived on 2 August 1566 and the defenders made several successful sorties causing considerable loss to the Turks. The Sultan arrived with the main force on 5 AugustCopp√©e (1864), pp. 562‚Äì565. and his big war tent was erected on the Similehov hill, giving him a view of the battle. The Sultan stayed in his camp where he received verbal battle progress reports from his Grand Vizier Sokollu Mehmed Pasha, the real operational commander of the Ottoman forces.Sakaoƒülu (1999), pp. 140‚Äì141. Count Zrinski found himself besieged by a hostile army of at least 150,000 soldiers with powerful artillery. Zrinski had assembled a force of around 2,300 Croatian and Hungarian soldiers prior to the siege. These consisted of his personal forces, and those of his friends and allies,Perok (1861), pp. 46‚Äì48. primarily Count Ga≈°par Alapiƒá and lieutenants Miklou≈° Kobak, Petar Pataƒçiƒá, and Vuk Paprutoviƒá. The majority of the defenders were Croatian, with a significant Hungarian contingent represented in both the men-at-arms and the leadership. Szigetv√°r was divided by water into three sections: the old town, the new town, and the castle‚Äîeach of which was linked to the next by bridges and to the land by causeways. Although it was not built on particularly high ground, the inner castle, which occupied much of the area of today's castle, was not directly accessible to the attackers. This was because two other baileys had to be taken and secured before a final assault on the inner castle could be launched. When the Sultan appeared before the fortress, he saw the walls hung with red cloth, as though for a festive reception, and a single great cannon thundered once to greet the mighty warrior monarch.Roworth (1840), p. 53. The siege began on 6 August when Suleiman ordered a general assault on the ramparts, which was repulsed. Despite being undermanned, and greatly outnumbered, the defenders were sent no reinforcements from Vienna by the imperial army. After over a month of exhausting and bloody struggle, the few remaining defenders retreated into the old town for their last stand. The Sultan tried to entice Zrinski to surrender, ultimately offering him leadership of Croatia under Ottoman influence.Pardoe (1842), p. 84. Count Zrinski did not reply and continued to fight. Emperor Maximilian and 80,000 soldiers stood in the vicinity of Gy≈ër but did not attack the Ottomans to take the pressure off Szigetv√°r.Paul Lendvai; (2004) The Hungarians: A Thousand Years of Victory in Defeat p. 94-100 Princeton University Press, The fall of the castle appeared inevitable but the Ottoman high command hesitated. On 6 September Suleiman died in his tent. His death was kept secret at great effort, with only the Sultan's innermost circle knowing of his demise. This was because the Ottomans feared that their soldiers would give up the battle if they knew that their leader died, so his death was kept secret for 48 days. A courier was dispatched from the camp with a message for Suleiman's successor, Selim II. The courier may not even have known the content of the message he delivered to distant Asia Minor within a mere eight days. =Final battle= The final battle began on 7 September, the day after Suleiman's demise. By this time, the fortress walls had been reduced to rubble by mining with explosives and wood fueled fires at the corners of the walls. In the morning an all-out attack began with fusillades from small arms, \\"Greek fire\\", and a concentrated cannonade.According to Robert William Fraser, more than 10,000 large cannon balls were shot into the fortress during the siege. Soon the castle, the last stronghold within Szigetv√°r, was set ablaze and cinders fell into the apartments of the count. The Ottoman army swarmed through the city, drumming and yelling. Zrinski prepared for a last charge addressing his troops: Zrinski did not allow the final assault to break into the castle. As the Turks were pressing forwards along a narrow bridge the defenders suddenly flung open the gate and fired a large mortar loaded with broken iron, killing 600 attackers. Zrinski then ordered a charge and led his remaining 600 troops out of the castle. He received two musket wounds in his chest and was killed shortly afterwards by an arrow to the head. Some of his force retired into the castle. The Turks took the castle and most of the defenders were slain. A few of the captured defenders were spared by Janissaries who had admired their courage, with only seven defenders managing to escape through the Ottoman lines. Zrinski's corpse was beheaded and it is considered his head was sent by Mehmed Pasha to Budin Pasha Sokullu Mustafa, or to new Sultan Selim II, but eventually, the head was buried by son Juraj IV Zrinski, Boldizs√°r Batthy√°ny, and Ferenc Tahy in September 1566 at the Pauline monastery in Sveta Jelena, ≈†enkovec, Croatia. His body received an honourable burial by a Turk who had been his prisoner, and well treated by him. =Powder magazine explosion= Before leading the final sortie by the castle garrison, Zrinski ordered a fuse be lit to the powder magazine.According to Francis Lieber, explosion of the powder magazine is somewhat disputable. After cutting down the last of the defenders the besiegers poured into the fortress. The Ottoman Army entered the remains of Szigetv√°r and fell into the booby trap; thousands perished in the blast when the castle's magazine exploded.Dupuy (1970), p. 501. The Vizier Ibrahim's life was saved by one of Zrinski's household who warned him of the trap when the Vizier and his troops searched for treasure and interrogated the survivors. While inquiring about the treasure the prisoner replied that it had been long expended, but that 3,000 lbs of powder were under their feet to which a slow match had been attached. The Vizier and his mounted officers had just enough time to escape but 3,000 Turks perished in the explosion.Nafziger & Walton (2003), p. 105 Aftermath Almost all of Zrinski's garrison was wiped out after the final battle. Ottoman casualties were also heavy. Three pashas, 7,000 Janissaries, and 28,000 other soldiers are said to have perished. Sources vary on the exact number with estimates ranging from 20,000‚Äì35,000. After the battle the Grand Vizier forged bulletins in the Sultan's name, proclaiming victory. These announced that the Sultan regretted that his current state of health prevented him from continuing with the successful campaign. His body was returned to Constantinople while the inner circle of officials pretended to keep up communication with him. Turkish sources state that the illusion was maintained for three weeks and that even the Sultan's personal physician was strangled as a precaution. It is likely that the long journey and the siege had a detrimental effect on the Sultan's health. His death meant that any advances were postponed as the Grand Vizier had to return to Constantinople for the succession of the new Sultan, Selim II. Even if Suleiman had lived his army could not have achieved much in the short time that remained between the fall of Szigeth and the onset of winter.Elliott (2000), p. 118. The prolonged resistance at Szigeth delayed the Ottoman push to Vienna. Two ambassadors were sent by Emperor Maximilian: Croatian Antun Vranƒçiƒá and Styrian Christoph Teuffenbach. They arrived in Istanbul on 26 August 1567 and were well received by Sultan Selim II.Setton (1984), pp. 921‚Äì922. An agreement ending the war between the Austrian and Ottoman empires was reached on 17 February 1568, after five months of negotiations with Sokollu Mehmed Pasha (also known as Mehmed-pa≈°a Sokoloviƒá, being originally from Bosnia). The Treaty of Adrianople was signed on 21 February 1568. Sultan Selim II agreed to an eight-year truce, although the agreement brought 25 years of (relative) peace between the Empires until the Long War. The truce was conditional and Maximilian agreed to pay an annual tribute of 30,000 ducats. Legacy and depictions in art Head sculptures of Nikola IV Zrinski (left) and Sultan Suleiman (right) at Hungarian-Turkish Friendship Park in Szigetv√°r The Croatian Renaissance poet and writer Brne Karnarutiƒá, from Zadar, wrote The Conquest of the City of Sziget (Vazetje Sigeta grada) sometime before 1573.Karnarutiƒá (1866), pp. 1‚Äì83. His work was posthumously published in 1584 in Venice. This is the first Croatian historical epic dealing with national history and the Battle of Szigetv√°r. It was inspired by Marko Maruliƒá's Judita. The battle was also immortalized in the Hungarian epic poem Szigeti Veszedelem (\\"Peril of Sziget\\"), written in fifteen parts by Zrinski's great-grandson Nicholas VII of Zrin (also a Ban of Croatia) in 1647 and published in 1651. This was one of the first such epics in the Hungarian language and was also inspired by Maruliƒá's Judita. Kenneth Clark's renowned history Civilisation lists the Szigeti Veszedelem as one of the major literary achievements of the 17th century. In spite of the author and other members of Zrinski family being fierce enemies of the Turks, the poem never demonizes them. The Turks are portrayed as human beings and a love story between Deliman the Tatar and the Sultan's daughter Cumilla is interwoven into the main plot. Petar Zrinski (), the brother of Nikola VII Zrinski, published Opsida Sigecka (1647/8) in the Croatian language‚Äînot surprising since the Zrinski family were bilingual. Another Croatian nobleman warrior-poet Pavao Ritter Vitezoviƒá (1652‚Äì1713) wrote about the battle. His poem Odiljenje sigetsko (\\"The Sziget Farewell\\"), first published in 1684, reminisces about the event without rancour or crying for revenge. The last of the four cantos is titled \\"Tombstones\\" and consists of epitaphs for the Croatian and Turkish warriors who died during the siege, paying equal respect to both. Karl Theodor K√∂rner, 1791‚Äì1813, a German poet, wrote in 1812 a drama, Zriny, about the battle. Ivan Zajc's 1876 opera Nikola ≈†ubiƒá Zrinski is his most famous and popular work in Croatia. This recounts the heroic defiance of the Croats towards the Turks, as a metaphor for their later nationalist impulses within the Habsburg monarchy. Zrinski is depicted in the plot as a 16th-century Croatian hero who defeated the Turks a couple of times before perishing sacrificially, along with his family and close supporters, in the siege of Szigeth castle. The opera is patriotic with a famous aria \\"U boj, u boj\\".

He played six years in Major League Baseball in the US, and thirteen years in Nippon Professional Baseball (NPB) in Japan. Rhodes is the all-time NPB home run leader among foreign-born players, and he is tied for 11th overall with 464 home runs in Japan. He hit 55 home runs in 2001, equaling the NPB single-season mark set by Sadaharu Oh in 1964. Early life Rhodes was born in Cincinnati, Ohio. He acquired the nickname \\"Tuffy\\" as a child because of his serious approach to baseball. Rhodes attended Western Hills High School in Cincinnati. Career Prior to Japan, he was a center fielder playing for the Houston Astros, Chicago Cubs and Boston Red Sox from 1990-1995. In his major league career, Rhodes batted .224, with 13 home runs and 44 runs batted in, 74 runs scored and 14 stolen bases in 225 games played. In , he hit an extra-inning home run to win the American Association championship for the Iowa Cubs. His only season of more than 250 at bats came with the 1994 Cubs. In that season, Rhodes became the first National League player to hit three home runs on opening day when he connected off Dwight Gooden at Wrigley Field. In this game, Rhodes also became the first major leaguer ever to hit home runs in his first three at-bats of a season. Granted free agency after the season, Rhodes signed with the Kintetsu Buffaloes in the Pacific League of NPB. In the season, he hit his 55th homer to tie Sadaharu Oh's Japanese League single season home run record, set in . For the rest of the season, opposing pitchers intentionally walked Rhodes to prevent him from breaking Oh's record. (The current record is 60, set by Wladimir Balentien in 2013.) The following year, Alex Cabrera tied the record. Over 8 seasons with the Buffaloes, Rhodes hit 288 home runs for the team. After Kintetsu refused to sign him to a multi-year contract, Rhodes signed a two-year deal with the Yomiuri Giants of the Japanese Central League in 2004. A successful first year was followed by a difficult second year. He left the team halfway through the 2005 season due to injury, and was released in the off-season. In 2006, he tried to return to the major leagues with the Cincinnati Reds but was released by the team in spring training. He did not play again that season. After spending the rest of 2006 with his family, however, he returned to Japan in 2007, signing a one-year contract with the Orix Buffaloes. After 10 seasons in NPB, Rhodes became just the second foreign player to accrue the required service time to no longer be counted as a foreign player for roster purposes, joining Tai-Yuan Kuo. In the past decade, Alex Ram√≠rez and Alex Cabrera have also achieved the same classification. Rhodes began the 2007 season with a bang by hitting a home run in his first game, and connecting for two more in the next game on two consecutive at bats. According to manager Terry Collins, Rhodes still had an 'explosive' bat.Asahi.com While the Buffaloes struggled to a last-place finish in 2007, and also not having any protection to speak of in the lineup, Rhodes' comeback was a spectacular one, batting .291 and hitting 42 home runs to go with 96 runs batted in. The next season, teamed with fellow gaijin slugger Alex Cabrera, Rhodes hit 40 home runs and drove in 118 runs. Combined, Cabrera and Rhodes, who earned the nickname \\"Caburo\\" late in the season, slammed 76 home runs and drove in 222 runs. Rhodes' 118 RBI also led the league as the Buffaloes made an improbable run to the playoffs, finishing second in the Pacific League and making their first playoff appearance since their 1996 Japan Series victory. However, the success did not last as the Buffaloes were swept in the short first-round of the Pacific League Climax Series by Yu Darvish and the more experienced Hokkaido Nippon Ham Fighters. Rhodes played for one more season with Orix before retiring for good at the end of the 2009 season.

According to Christian tradition, the Image of Edessa was a holy relic consisting of a square or rectangle of cloth upon which a miraculous image of the face of Jesus had been imprinted‚Äîthe first icon (\\"image\\"). In the Orthodox Churches, including English-speaking Orthodoxy, the image is generally known as the Mandylion. By this account, King Abgar of Edessa wrote to Jesus, asking him to come cure him of an illness. Abgar received a reply letter from Jesus, declining the invitation, but promising a future visit by one of his disciples. One of the seventy disciples, Thaddeus of Edessa, is said to have come to Edessa, bearing the words of Jesus, by the virtues of which the king was miraculously healed. This tradition was first recorded in the early 4th century by Eusebius of Caesarea,Eusebius, Historia Ecclesiae 1.13.5 and .22. who said that he had transcribed and translated the actual letter in the Syriac chancery documents of the king of Edessa, but who makes no mention of an image.Steven Runciman, \\"Some Remarks on the Image of Edessa\\", Cambridge Historical Journal 3.3 (1931:238-252), p. 240 The report of an image, which accrued to the legendarium of Abgar, first appears in the Syriac work, the Doctrine of Addai: according to it, the messenger, here called Ananias, was also a painter, and he painted the portrait, which was brought back to Edessa and conserved in the royal palace.Runciman 1931, loc. cit.. The first record of the existence of a physical image in the ancient city of Edessa (now Urfa) was by Evagrius Scholasticus, writing about 593, who reports a portrait of Christ of divine origin (Œ∏ŒµœåœÑŒµœÖŒ∫œÑŒøœÇ), which effected the miraculous aid in the defence of Edessa against the Persians in 544.Evagrius, in Migne, Patrologia Graecalxxxvi, 2, cols. 2748f, noted by Runciman 1931, p. 240, note 5; remarking that \\"the portrait of Christ has entered the class of Œ±œáŒµŒπœÅŒøœÄŒøŒØŒ∑œÑŒøŒπ icons\\". The image was moved to Constantinople in the 10th century. The cloth disappeared when Constantinople was sacked in 1204 during the Fourth Crusade, and is believed by some to have reappeared as a relic in King Louis IX of France's Sainte-Chapelle in Paris. This relic disappeared in the French Revolution.Two documentary inventories: year 1534 (Gerard of St. Quentin de l'Isle, Paris) and year 1740. See Grove Dictionary of Art, Steven Runciman, Some Remarks on the Image of Edessa, Cambridge Historical Journal 1931, and Shroud.com for a list of the group of relics. See also an image of the Gothic reliquary dating from the 13th century, in Histor.ws . The provenance of the Edessa letter between the 1st century and its location in his own time are not reported by Eusebius. The materials, according to the scholar Robert Eisenman, \\"are very widespread in the Syriac sources with so many multiple developments and divergences that it is hard to believe they could all be based on Eusebius' poor efforts\\" (Eisenman 1997:862). The Eastern Orthodox Church observes a feast for this icon on August 16, which commemorates its translation from Edessa to Constantinople. History of the legend The story of the Mandylion is likely the product of centuries of development. The first version is found in Eusebius' History of the Church (1.13.5 ‚Äì 1.13.22). Eusebius claimed that he had transcribed and translated the actual letter in the Syriac chancery documents of the king of Edessa. This records a letter written by King Abgar of Edessa to Jesus, asking him to come cure him of an illness. Jesus replies by letter, saying that when he had completed his earthly mission and ascended to heaven, he would send a disciple (Thaddeus of Edessa) to heal Abgar (and does so). At this stage, there is no mention of an image of Jesus. In AD 384, Egeria, a pilgrim from either Gaul or Spain, was given a personal tour by the Bishop of Edessa, who provided her with many marvellous accounts of miracles that had saved Edessa from the Persians and put into her hands transcripts of the correspondence of Abgarus and Jesus, with embellishments. Part of her accounts of her travels, in letters to her sisterhood, survive. \\"She na√Øvely supposed that this version was more complete than the shorter letter which she had read in a translation at home, presumably one brought back to the Far West by an earlier pilgrim\\" (Palmer 1998). Her escorted tour, accompanied by a translator, was thorough; the bishop is quoted: \\"Now let us go to the gate where the messenger Ananias came in with the letter of which I have been telling you.\\" (Palmer). There was however, no mention of any image reported by Egeria, who spent three days inspecting every corner of Edessa and the environs. The next stage of development appears in the Doctrine of Addai [Thaddeus], c. 400, which introduces a court painter among a delegation sent by Abgar to Jesus, who paints a portrait of Jesus to take back to his master: The later legend of the image recounts that because the successors of Abgar reverted to paganism, the bishop placed the miraculous image inside a wall, and setting a burning lamp before the image, he sealed them up behind a tile; that the image was later found again, after a vision, on the very night of the Persian invasion, and that not only had it miraculously reproduced itself on the tile, but the same lamp was still burning before it; further, that the bishop of Edessa used a fire into which oil flowing from the image was poured to destroy the Persians. The image itself is said to have resurfaced in 525, during a flood of the Daisan, a tributary stream of the Euphrates that passed by Edessa. This flood is mentioned in the writings of the court historian Procopius of Caesarea. In the course of the reconstruction work, a cloth bearing the facial features of a man was discovered hidden in the wall above one of the gates of Edessa. Writing soon after the Persian siege of 544, Procopius says that the text of Jesus' letter, by then including a promise that \\"no enemy would ever enter the city\\", was inscribed over the city gate, but does not mention an image. Procopius is sceptical about the authenticity of the promise, but says that the wish to disprove it was part of the Persian king Khosrau I's motivation for the attack, as \\"it kept irritating his mind\\".Kitzinger, 103‚Äì104, 103 with first quote; Procopius, Histories of the Wars, II, 26, 7‚Äì8, quoted, and 26‚Äì30 on Jesus' promise, Loeb translation quoted. The Syriac Chronicle of Edessa written in 540-550 also claim divine interventions in the siege, but does not mention the Image. Some fifty years later, Evagrius Scholasticus in his Ecclesiastical History (593) is the first to mention a role for the image in the relief of the siege,Kitzinger, 103 attributing it to a \\"God-made image\\", a miraculous imprint of the face of Jesus upon a cloth. Thus we can trace the development of the legend from a letter, but no image in Eusebius, to an image painted by a court painter in Addai, which becomes a miracle caused by a miraculously-created image supernaturally made when Jesus pressed a cloth to his wet face in Evagrius. It was this last and latest stage of the legend that became accepted in Eastern Orthodoxy, the image of Edessa that was \\"created by God, and not produced by the hands of man\\". This idea of an icon that was Acheiropoietos (ŒëœáŒµŒπœÅŒøœÄŒøŒØŒ∑œÑŒøœÇ, literally \\"not-made-by-hand\\") is a separate enrichment of the original legend: similar legends of supernatural origins have accrued to other Orthodox icons. The Ancha icon is reputed to be the Keramidion, another acheiropoietos recorded from an early period, miraculously imprinted with the face of Christ by contact with the Mandylion. To art historians it is a Georgian icon of the 6th-7th century. According to the Golden Legend, which is a collection of hagiographies, compiled by Jacobus de Varagine in the thirteenth century the king Abgarus sent an epistle unto Jesus and he answered him writing that he will send him one of his disciples (Jude Thaddeus) to heal him. The same works adds: Later events The Holy Mandylion disappeared again after the Sassanians conquered Edessa in 609. A local legend, related to historian Andrew Palmer when he visited Urfa (Edessa) in 1999, relates that the towel or burial cloth (mendil) of Jesus was thrown into a well in what is today the city's Great Mosque. The Christian tradition exemplified in Georgios Kedrenos' Historiarum compendiumKedrenos, ed. Bekker, vol. I:685; see K. Weitzmann, \\"The Mandylion and Constantine Porphyrogennetos\\", Cahiers arch√©ologiques 11 (1960:163-84), reprinted in Studies in Classical and Byzantine Manuscript Illumination, H. Kessler, ed. (Chicago, 1971:224-76). is at variance with this, John ScylitzesJohn Scylitzes. 231f, noted in Holger A. Klein, \\"Sacred Relics and Imperial Ceremonies at the Great Palace of Constantinople\\", 2006:91 and note 80 ([ reprinted on-line]). recounting how in 944, when the city was besieged by John Kourkouas, it was exchanged for a group of Muslim prisoners. At that time the Image of Edessa was taken to Constantinople where it was received amidst great celebration by emperor Romanos I Lekapenos, who deposited it in the Theotokos of the Pharos chapel in the Great Palace of Constantinople. Not inconsequentially, the earliest known Byzantine icon of the Mandylion or Holy Face, preserved at Saint Catherine's Monastery in Egypt, is dated c. 945.K. Weitzmann, The Monastery of Saint Catherine at Mount Sinai: The Icons I: From the Sixth to the Tenth Century, Princeton, 1976:94-98, and plates xxxvi- xxxvii. The Mandylion remained under Imperial protection until the Crusaders sacked the city in 1204 and carried off many of its treasures to Western Europe, though the \\"Image of Edessa\\" is not mentioned in this context in any contemporary document. Similarly, it has been claimed that the Shroud of Turin disappeared from Constantinople in 1204, when Crusaders looted the city. The leaders of the Crusader army in this instance were French and Italian (from Venice), and it is believed that somehow because of this, the Shroud made its way to France.Archaeological Study Bible by Zondervan A small part of a relic, believed to be the same as this, was one of the large group sold by Baldwin II of Constantinople to Louis IX of France in 1241 and housed in the Sainte- Chapelle in Paris (not to be confused with the Sainte Chapelle at Chamb√©ry, home for a time of the Shroud of Turin) until it disappeared during the French Revolution. The famous Portuguese Jesuit, Jer√≥nimo Lobo, who visited Rome in 1637, mentions the sacred portrait sent to King Abgar as being in this city: \\"I saw the famous relics that are preserved in that city as in a sanctuary, a large part of the holy cross, pieces of the crown and several thorns, the sponge, the lance, Saint Thomas's finger, one of the thirty coins for which the Saviour was sold, the sacred portrait, the one that Christ Our Lord sent to King Abagaro, the sacred staircase on which Christ went up and down from the Praetorium, the head of the holy Baptist, the Column, the Altar on which Saint Peter said mass, and countless other relics.\\"The itinerario of Jeronimo Lobo, 1984, page 400 File:Cathedral of the Holy Mandylion (Andronikov Monastery) 10.jpgThe katholikon of Andronikov Monastery is the oldest (outside the Kremlin) building in Moscow and one of numerous Russian churches dedicated to the Holy Mandylion File:Christos Acheiropoietos.jpg\\"The Saviour Not Made by Hands\\", a Novgorodian icon from c. 1100 Links with the Shroud of Turin Author Ian Wilson has argued that the object venerated as the Mandylion from the 6th to the 13th centuries was in fact the Shroud of Turin, folded in four, and enclosed in an oblong frame so that only the face was visible. Wilson cites documents in the Vatican Library and the University of Leiden, Netherlands, which seem to suggest the presence of another image at Edessa. A 10th-century codex, Codex Vossianus Latinus Q 69From the library of Gerhard Johann Vossius. found by Gino Zaninotto in the Vatican Library contains an 8th-century account saying that an imprint of Christ's whole body was left on a canvas kept in a church in Edessa: it quotes a man called Smera in Constantinople: \\"King Abgar received a cloth on which one can see not only a face but the whole body\\" (in Latin: [non tantum] faciei figuram sed totius corporis figuram cernere poteris).Codex Vossianus Latinus, Q69, and Vatican Library, Codex 5696, fol.35, which was published in Pietro Savio, Ricerche storiche sulla Santa Sindone Turin 1957. Surviving images Two images survive today which are associated with the Mandylion. =Holy Face of Genoa= This image is kept in the Church of St Bartholomew of The Armenians in Genoa, Italy. In the 14th century it was donated to the doge of Genoa Leonardo Montaldo by the Byzantine Emperor John V Palaeologus. It has been the subject of a detailed 1969 study by Colette Dufour Bozzo, who dated the outer frame to the late 14th century, giving a terminus ante quem for the inner frame and the image itself. Bozzo found that the image was imprinted on a cloth that had been pasted onto a wooden board.Das Mandylion von Genua und sein pal√§ologischer Rahmen - The Mandylion of Genoa (in German) See also: Annalen van de stad Genua uit de 14de eeuw beschrijven dat het de echte Edessa-mandylion betreft (in Dutch) The similarity of the image with the Veil of Veronica suggests a link between the two traditions. =Holy Face of San Silvestro= This image was kept in Rome's church of San Silvestro in Capite, attached to a convent of Poor Clares, up to 1870, and is now kept in the Matilda chapel in the Vatican Palace. It is housed in a Baroque frame added by Sister Dionora Chiarucci, head of the convent, in 1623. The earliest evidence of its existence is 1517, when the nuns were forbidden to exhibit it to avoid competition with the Veronica. Like the Genoa image, it is painted on board and therefore is likely to be a copy. It was exhibited at Germany‚Äôs Expo 2000 in the pavilion of the Holy See.

Veil of Veronica Veronica holding her veil, Hans Memling, c. 1470 The Veil of Veronica, or Sudarium (Latin for sweat- cloth), often called simply \\"The Veronica\\" and known in Italian as the Volto Santo or Holy Face (but not to be confused with the carved crucifix Volto Santo of Lucca), is a Christian relic of a piece of cloth which, according to tradition, bears the likeness of the face of Jesus not made by human hand (i.e., an acheiropoieton).

The word \\"Moro\\" is a term for Muslim people who lived in the Southern Philippines, an area that includes Mindanao, Jolo and the neighboring Sulu Archipelago. Background The Moros have a 400-year history of resisting foreign rule. The violent armed struggle against the Spanish, against the Americans, against the Japanese, and against the Filipinos, is considered by current Moro leaders as part of the four centuries-long \\"national liberation movement\\" of the Bangsamoro (Moro Nation).Banlaoi 2012, p. 24. This conflict persisted and developed into their current war for independence against the Philippine state.Banlaoi 2005 , p. 68. A \\"culture of jihad\\" emerged among the Moros due to the centuries-long war against the Spanish invaders. The ethnic Moro population of the southern Philippines resisted both Spanish and United States colonization. The Moro areas of Western Mindanao have been the most rebellious areas in the Philippines along with Samar Island and Bicol Region. The Spaniards were restricted to a handful of coastal garrisons or Forts and they made occasional punitive expeditions into the vast interior regions. After a series of unsuccessful attempts during the centuries of Spanish rule in the Philippines, Spanish forces occupied the abandoned city of Jolo, Sulu, the seat of the Sultan of Sulu, in 1876. The Spaniards and the Sultan of Sulu signed the Spanish Treaty of Peace on July 22, 1878. Control of the Sulu archipelago outside of the Spanish garrisons was handed to the Sultan. The treaty had translation errors: According to the Spanish-language version, Spain had complete sovereignty over the Sulu archipelago, while the Tausug version described a protectorate instead of an outright dependency. Despite the very nominal claim to the Moro territories, Spain ceded them to the United States in the Treaty of Paris which signaled the end of the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War. Following the American occupation of the Northern Philippines during 1899, Spanish forces in the Southern Philippines were abolished, and they retreated to the garrisons at Zamboanga and Jolo. American forces took control over the Spanish government in Jolo on May 18, 1899, and at Zamboanga in December 1899. The Moros resisted the new American colonizers as they had resisted the Spanish. The Spanish, American, and Philippine governments have all been fought against by the Muslims of Sulu and Mindanao. Ottoman Empire's role John Hay, the American Secretary of State, asked the ambassador to Ottoman Empire, Oscar Straus in 1899 to approach Ottoman Sultan Abdul Hamid II to request that the Sultan write a letter to the Moro Sulu Muslims of the Sulu Sultanate in the Philippines telling them to submit to American suzerainty and American military rule. Despite the sultan's \\"pan- Islamic\\" ideology, he readily aided the American forces because he felt no need to cause hostilities between the West and Muslims. Abdul Hamid wrote the letter, which was sent to Mecca where two Sulu chiefs brought it home to Sulu. It was successful, and the \\"Sulu Mohammedans ... refused to join the insurrectionists and had placed themselves under the control of [the American] army, thereby recognizing American sovereignty.\\" John P. Finley wrote that: > After due consideration of these facts, the Sultan, as Caliph caused a > message to be sent to the Mohammedans of the Philippine Islands forbidding > them to enter into any hostilities against the Americans, inasmuch as no > interference with their religion would be allowed under American rule. As > the Moros have never asked more than that, it is not surprising, that they > refused all overtures made, by Aguinaldo's agents, at the time of the > Filipino insurrection. President McKinley sent a personal letter of thanks > to Mr. Straus for the excellent work he had done, and said, its > accomplishment had saved the United States at least twenty thousand troops > in the field. If the reader will pause to consider what this means in men > and also the millions in money, he will appreciate this wonderful piece of > diplomacy, in averting a holy war. President McKinley did not mention the Ottoman Empire's role in the pacification of the Sulu Moros in his address to the first session of the Fifty-sixth Congress in December 1899 since the agreement with the Sultan of Sulu was not submitted to the Senate until December 18. Cause of the war After the American government informed the Moros that they would continue the old protectorate relationship that they had with Spain, the Moro Sulu Sultan rejected this and demanded that a new treaty be negotiated. The United States signed the Kiram-Bates Treaty with the Moro Sulu Sultanate which guaranteed the Sultanate's autonomy in its internal affairs and governance, including article X that guaranteed preservation of slavery, while America dealt with its foreign relations, in order to keep the Moros out of the Philippine‚ÄìAmerican War. Once the Americans subdued the northern Filipinos, the Bates Treaty with the Moros was adjusted by the Americans through removal of article X and they invaded Moroland.http://dtic.mil/cgi- bin/GetTRDoc?AD=ADA406868 Luga p. 22. After the war in 1915, the Americans imposed the Carpenter Treaty on Sulu. Philippine‚ÄìAmerican War events First Republic forces in the southern Philippines were commanded by General Nicolas Capistrano, and American forces conducted an expedition against him in the winter of 1900‚Äì1901. On March 27, 1901, Capistrano surrendered. A few days later, General Emilio Aguinaldo was captured in Luzon. This major victory in the war in the north allowed the Americans to devote more resources to the south, and they began to push into the interior of Bangsamoro. On August 31, 1901, Brig. Gen. George Whitefield Davis replaced Kobbe as the commander of the Department of Mindanao-Jolo. Davis adopted a conciliatory policy towards the Moros. American forces under his command had standing orders to buy Moro produce when possible and to have \\"heralds of amity\\" precede all scouting expeditions. Peaceful Moros would not be disarmed. Polite reminders of America's anti-slavery policy were allowed. One of Davis' subordinates, Captain John J. Pershing, assigned to the American garrison at Iligan, set out to better relations with the Moros of the Maranao tribes on the northern shore of Lake Lanao. He successfully established friendly relations with Amai- Manabilang, the retired Sultan of Madaya. Although retired, Manabilang was the single most influential personage among the fragmented inhabitants of the northern shore of the lake. His alliance did much to secure American standing in the area. Conflict Not all of Davis' subordinates were as diplomatic as Pershing. Many veterans of the Indian Wars took the \\"only good Indian is a dead Indian\\" mentality with them to the Philippines, and \\"civilize 'em with a Krag\\" became a similar catchphrase. Three ambushes of American troops by Moros, one of which involved Juramentados, occurred to the south of Lake Lanao, outside of Manabilang's sphere of influence. These events prompted Maj. Gen. Adna R. Chaffee, the military governor of the Philippines, to issue a declaration on April 13, 1902, demanding that the offending Datu hand over the killers of American troops and stolen government property. Not compliant, a punitive expedition under Col. Frank Baldwin set out to settle matters with the south-shore Moros. Although an excellent officer, Baldwin was \\"eager,\\" and a worried Davis joined the expedition as an observer. On May 2, 1902, Baldwin's expedition attacked a Moro cotta (fortress) at the Battle of Pandapatan, also known as the Battle of Bayan. Pandapatan's defenses were unexpectedly strong, leading to 18 American casualties during the fighting. On the second day, the Americans used ladders and moat-bridging tools to break through the Moro fortifications, and a general slaughter of the Moro defenders followed. thumb The expeditionary force built at Camp Vickers one mile south of Pandapatan, and Davis assigned Pershing to Baldwin's command as an intelligence officer and as director of Moro affairs. As director, 'Black Jack' Pershing had a veto over Baldwin's movements, which was an unstable arrangement. This arrangement was tested when survivors of Pandapatan began building a Cotta at Bacalod. Baldwin wanted to move on the hostile Moros immediately, but Pershing warned that doing so could create an anti-American coalition of the surrounding Datus, while some patient diplomacy could establish friendly relations with most of the Moros, isolating the hostile minority. Baldwin grudgingly agreed. On June 30, Pershing assumed command of Camp Vickers, and Baldwin returned to Malabang. A command the size of Camp Vickers would normally have gone to an officer with the rank of Major, and a careful shuffling of personnel would be required to ensure that reinforcements to the Camp did not include officers that were senior to Pershing. On July 4, 1902, President Theodore Roosevelt issued a proclamation declaring an end to the Philippine Insurrection and a cessation of hostilities in the Philippines \\"except in the country inhabited by the Moro tribes, to which this proclamation does not apply.\\" Later that month, Davis was promoted and replaced Chaffee as the supreme commander of American forces in the Philippines. Command of the Mindanao-Jolo Department went to Brig. Gen. Samuel S. Sumner. Meanwhile, Pershing settled down to conduct diplomacy with the surrounding Moros, and a July 4th celebration had 700 guests from neighboring rancherias. In September 1902, he led the Masiu Expedition, which resulted in a victory that did much to establish American dominance in the area. On February 10, 1903, Pershing was declared a Datu by the formerly hostile Pandita Sajiduciaman of the Bayan Moros (who had been defeated at the Battle of Pandapatan)‚Äîthe only American to be so honored. Pershing's career at Camp Vickers culminated in the March Around Lake Lanao during April and May 1903. Dansalan also known as the Marawi Expedition, it included the Battle of Bacolod and First Battle of Taraka but was otherwise peaceful. This expedition quickly became a symbol of American control of the Lake Lanao region and was regarded with dismay by the Moro Maranao inhabitants of that region. While Pershing was working to the south of Lake Lanao, Major Robert Lee Bullard was working to the north, building a road from Iligan to Marawi. Although never officially declared one, like Pershing, he was regarded as a Datu by the Moros. Because of the Lake Lanao Moros' very personalistic style of leadership, they had troubles seeing them as two officers in the same army. Instead, they saw them as two powerful chieftains who might become rivals. During Pershing's March Around Lake Lanao, one Moro ran to Bullard, exclaiming that Pershing had gone Juramentado, meaning berserk and that Bullard had better run up the white flag (signaling that they had no quarrel with Pershing's troops). Bullard was unable to explain to the Moro why he was not worried about Pershing's approach. On another occasion, a powerful datu proposed an alliance with Bullard, for the purposes of defeating Pershing and establishing overlordship over the entire Lake Lanao region. On June 1, 1903, the Moro Province was created, which included \\"all of the territory of the Philippines lying south of the eight parallel of latitude, excepting the island of Palawan and the eastern portion of the northwest peninsula of Mindanao.\\" The province had a civil government, but many civil service positions, including the district governors and their deputies, were held by members of the American military. The governor of the province served as the commander of the Department of Mindanao-Jolo. This system of combined civil and military administration had several motivations behind it. One was the continued Moro hostilities. Another was the Army's experience during the Indian Wars when it came into conflict with the civilian Bureau of Indian Affairs. A third was that the Moros, with their feudal, personalistic style of government, would have no respect for a military leader who submitted to the authority of a non-combatant. In addition to the executive branch, under the governor, the province also had a legislative branch: the Moro Council. This Council \\"consisted of the governor, a state attorney, a secretary, a treasurer, a superintendent of schools, and an engineer.\\" Although the governor appointed all of the other members of the council, this body was permanent and provided a more solid foundation for laws than the fiats of the governor, which might be overturned by his successor. The province was divided into five districts, with American officers serving as district governors and deputy governors. These districts included: Cotabato, Davao, Lanao, Sulu, and Zamboanga. The districts were sub-divided into tribal wards, with major datus serving as ward chiefs and minor datus serving as deputies, judges, and sheriffs. This system took advantage of the existing structure of Moro political society, which was based on personal ties while paving the way for a more individualistic society, where the office, not the person holding it, would be given respect. On August 6, 1903, Major General Leonard Wood assumed his position as the governor of Moro Province and commander of the Department of Mindanao-Jolo. Wood was somewhat heavy-handed in his dealing with the Moros, being \\"personally offended by the Moro propensity for blood feuds, polygamy, and human trafficking\\" and with his \\"ethnocentrism sometimes [leading] him to impose American concepts too quickly in Moroland.\\" In addition to his views of the Moros, Wood also faced an uphill Senate battle over his appointment to the rank of Major General, which was finally confirmed on March 19, 1904. This drove him to seek military laurels in order to shore up his lack of field experience, sometimes leading the Provincial army on punitive expeditions over minor incidents that would have been better handled diplomatically by the district governors. The period of Wood's governorship had the hardest and bloodiest fighting of America's occupation of Moroland. Some of the Moros fighting against the American troops were women who dressed exactly the same as men. This led to the song sung by American troops called \\"If a Lady's Wearin' Pantaloons\\". =Province under Leonard Wood (1903‚Äì1906)= Wood instituted many changes during his tenure as governor of Moro Province: * On Wood's recommendation, the United States unilaterally abrogated the Bates Treaty, citing continuing piracy and attacks on American personnel. The Sultan of Sulu was demoted to a purely religious office, with no more power than any other datu, and was provided with a small salary. The United States assumed direct control over Moroland. * Slavery was abolished. Slave trading and raiding were repressed, but slaves were left with their owners. Wood announced that slaves were \\"at liberty to go and build homes for themselves wherever they like[d],\\" and pledged the military's protection for any former slaves that did so. Similar actions had been taken by individual commanders in the past, but Wood's edict had the backing of the Moro Council, giving it more permanent weight. * The Cedula Act of 1903 created an annual registration poll tax. This registration poll tax was highly unpopular with the Moros, since they interpreted it as a form of tribute. According to Hurley, participation in the Cedula was very low as late as 1933. * The legal code of Moroland was reformed. Disputes between Moros and non-Christians had been left to Moro laws and customs, with Philippine laws only applying to disputes with Christians. This led to a double standard, with a Moro who killed a Christian facing a stiff prison sentence, but with a Moro who killed another Moro facing only a maximum fine of 150 pesos. Wood attempted to codify Moro law, but there was simply too much variance in laws and customs between the different tribes and even between neighboring cottas. Wood placed the Moros underneath the Philippine criminal code, but actual enforcement of this proved difficult. * Private land ownership was introduced, in order to help the Moros transition to a more individualistic society from their traditional tribal society. Each family was given 40 acres (16 ha) of land, with datus given additional land in accordance with their status. Land sales had to be approved by the district governments in order to prevent fraud. * An educational system was established. By June 1904, there were 50 schools with an average enrollment of 30 students each. Because of difficulties in getting teachers that spoke native languages, classes were conducted in English after initial training in that language. Many Moros were suspicious of the schools, but some offered buildings for use as schools. * Trade was encouraged in order to give the Moros an alternative to fighting. Trade had been discouraged by banditry, piracy, and the possibility of intertribal disputes between Moro merchants and local customers. When trading with foreign merchants (usually maritime Chinese), a lack of warehousing made for a buyer's market, leading to low prices. Wood handled banditry and piracy by establishing military posts at river mouths in order to protect sea and land routes. Starting with a pilot project in Zamboanga, a system of Moro Exchanges was established. These exchanges provided Moro traders with warehouses and temporary housing in exchange for honoring a ban on fighting within the exchange. Bulletin-boards listed market prices in Hong Kong and Singapore, and the district governments guaranteed fair prices. These Exchanges proved highly successful and profitable, and provided a neutral ground for feuding datus to settle their differences. Campaigns Major military campaigns during Wood's governorship include: * Wood's March Around Lake Lanao during the fall of 1903 was an abortive attempt to replicate Pershing's earlier March. * In October and November 1903, Wood personally led the Provincial Army to put down the Hassan Uprising, which was led by the most powerful datu on the island of Jolo. * In the spring of 1904, Wood destroyed or captured 130 cottas during the Second Battle of Taraca. * Beginning in the spring of 1904 and continuing into the fall of 1905, American forces conducted a lengthy and massive manhunt for Datu Ali, the overlord of Cottabato Valley. Datu Ali had rebelled over Wood's anti-slavery policy. Engagements during this campaign include the Battle of Siranaya, the Simpetan Massacre, and the Battle of the Malalag River. * The First Battle of Bud Dajo was fought from March 5 to March 7, 1906. An estimated 600 Muslims were killed, fighting a force of 800 Americans. The Incident in the Philippines written by Mark Twain condemned the American massacre at Bud Dajo. =Governorship of Tasker H. Bliss (1906‚Äì1909)= On February 1, 1906, Major. Gen. Tasker H. Bliss replaced General Wood as the commander of the Department of Mindanao-Jolo, and replaced him as governor of Moro Province sometime after the First Battle of Bud Dajo. Bliss' tenure is regarded as a \\"peace era\\", and Bliss launched no punitive expeditions during his term in office. However, this superficial peace came at the price of tolerating a certain amount of lawlessness. Constabulary forces in pursuit of Moro fugitives often found themselves forced to abandon their chase after the fugitives took refuge at their home cottas. The constabulary forces were outnumbered, and a much larger (and disruptive) expedition would have been required to dislodge the fugitives from their hiding place. However, this period also demonstrated the success of new aggressive American tactics. According to Rear Admiral D.P. Mannix, who fought the Moros as a young lieutenant from 1907‚Äì1908, the Americans exploited Muslim taboos by wrapping dead Moros in pig's skin and \\"stuffing [their] mouth[s] with pork\\", thereby deterring the Moros from continuing with their suicide attacks. A compilation of the diary of Rear Admiral D.P. Mannix III. =Governorship of John J. Pershing (1909‚Äì1913)= Cornelius C. Smith (far right), a recipient of the Medal of Honor, as commander of the Philippine Constabulary with Brig. Gen. John J. Pershing and Moro chieftains in 1910. Smith participated in expeditions against the Moro rebels for much of his time in the Philippines. On November 11, 1909, Brigadier General John J. Pershing assumed his duties as the third and final military governor of Moro Province. Reforms Pershing enacted the following reforms during his tenure as governor: * In order to extend rule of law into the interior, Pershing stationed the Philippine Scouts in small detachments throughout the interior. This reduced crime and promoted agriculture and trade, at the cost of reduced military efficiency and troop training. The benefits of this reform outweighed the costs. * The legal system was streamlined. Previously, trials had started with the Court of First Instance, which convened every 6 months, and appeals to the Supreme Court in Manila often took more than one year. Pershing expanded the jurisdiction of the local ward courts, which were presided over by the district governors and secretaries, to include most civil cases and all criminal cases except for capital offenses. The Court of First Instance became the court of last resort. This reform was popular with the Moros, since it was quick, simple, and resembled their traditional unification of executive and judicial powers. * Pershing promised to donate government land for purposes of building Muslim houses of worship. * Pershing recognized the practice of sacopy ‚Äì indentured servitude in exchange for support and protection ‚Äì as legitimate, but reaffirmed the government's opposition to involuntary slavery. * Labor contract law was reformed in 1912. Defaults on contracts by workers or employers were no longer punishable unless there was intent to defraud or injure. Moros, unused to Western notions of work, were prone to absenteeism, which could lead to breach of contract suits. * The economy of Moro Province continued to expand under Pershing. The three most important exports ‚Äì hemp, copra, and lumber ‚Äì increased 163% during his first three years, and Moros began to make bank deposits for the first time in their history. * The Moro Exchange system was retained and was supplemented by Industrial Trading Stations. These stations operated in the interior, where merchants seldom went, and bought any non-perishable goods the Moros wished to sell. The stations also sold goods to the Moros at fair prices, preventing price gouging during famines. Tactics Pershing wrote the following in his autobiography about the juramentado: > [The] juramentado attacks were materially reduced in number by a practice > the army had already adopted, one that the Mohammadans held in abhorrence. > The bodies were publicly buried in the same grave with a dead pig. It was > not pleasant to have to take such measures but the prospect of going to hell > instead of heaven sometimes deterred the would-be assassins.Pershing, John > (2013) My Life Before the World War, 1860‚Äì1917: A Memoir, pp. 284-85 > Lexington, Kentucky: University Press of Kentucky. Though this treatment was inflicted on captured juramentado, historians do not believe that Pershing was directly involved with such incidents, or that he personally gave such orders to his subordinates. Letters and memoirs from soldiers describing events similar to this do not have credible evidence of Pershing's having been personally involved.Horton, Alex (August 18, 2017) \\"Trump said to study General Pershing. Here‚Äôs what the president got wrong\\" The Washington PostQiu, Linda (August 18, 2017) \\"Study Pershing, Trump Said. But the Story Doesn‚Äôt Add Up\\" The New York Times =Surrender of Arms= The four-day battle of Bagsak Mountain on Jolo island in 1913 Law enforcement in the Moro Province was difficult. Outlaws would go to ground at their home cottas, requiring an entire troop of police or soldiers to arrest them. There was always the danger of a full-fledged battle breaking out during such an arrest, and this led to many known outlaws going unpunished. In 1911, Pershing resolved to disarm the Moros. Army Chief of Staff Leonard Wood (former Moro Province governor) disagreed with this plan, stating that the move was ill- timed and that the Moros would hide their best arms, turning in only their worst. Pershing waited until roads into the interior had been completed, so that government troops could protect disarmed Moros from holdouts. He conferred with the Datus, who mostly agreed that disarmament would be a good idea ‚Äì provided that everybody disarmed. Six weeks before putting his disarmament plan into action, Pershing informed Governor-General William Cameron Forbes, who agreed with the plan. Pershing did not consult or inform his commanding officer, Major. Gen. J. Franklin Bell. On September 8, 1911, Executive Order No. 24, which ordered the disarmament, was issued. The deadline for disarmament was December 1, 1911. Resistance to disarmament was particularly fierce in the district of Jolo and led to the Second Battle of Bud Dajo (which, while involving roughly equivalent forces as the first battle, was far less bloody causing only 12 Moro casualties), and the Battle of Bud Bagsak. =Transition to civil authority= By 1913, Pershing agreed that the Moro Province needed to transition to civil government. This was prompted by the Moro's personalistic approach to government, which was based on personal ties rather than a respect for an abstract office. To the Moros, a change of administration meant not just a change in leadership but a change in regime, and was a traumatic experience. Rotation within the military meant that each military governor could serve only for a limited time. Civil governors were needed in order to provide for a lengthy tenure in office. Until 1911, every district governor and secretary had been a military officer. By November 1913, only one officer still held a civil office ‚Äì Pershing himself. In December 1913, Pershing was replaced as governor of Moro Province by a civilian, Frank Carpenter. Casualties During the Moro Rebellion, the Americans suffered losses amounting to 130 killed and 323 wounded. Another 500 or so died of disease. The Philippine Scouts who augmented American forces during the campaign suffered 116 killed and 189 wounded. The Philippine Constabulary suffered heavily as well with more than 1,500 losses sustained of which half were fatalities. On the Moro side, casualties were high as surrender was uncommon when Moros were engaged in combat.

Panglima Hassan in the Hassan uprising was shot dozens of times before his jihad was stopped. As a result, Americans elected to phase out revolvers with .38 caliber ammunition in favor of .45 ACP to continue their fight against the Moros. Arrows, bayonets, guns, and Kris were used in often suicidal attacks by the Moros during their war with the Americans. Suicide attacks became more popular among Moros due to the overwhelming firepower of the Americans in conventional battles. Moro women took part in the resistance at the Battle of Bud Dajo against the American General Lenard Wood in 1906. Barbed wire proved to be of no impediment since Moro Juramentado warriors managed to surge directly through it even as it ripped at their flesh and even as they were shot repeatedly with bullets. The Moros used barongs to inflict injuries upon American soldiers. Moros under Jikiri managed to survive in a cave under machine gun fire and Colt gunfire. Kris and Kampilan were used by Moros in fierce close quarter combat against the Americans. Muskets were also used by the Moro. The Moro employed bayonets at close range when shooting was not possible according to the American journal The Field Artillery Journal, Volume 32. Americans were even charged at by Moros using spears. Moros fought to the death against Americans armed with rifles and artillery while they themselves used only Kris at the crater battle. Novels have been written about Juramentados deliberately impaling themselves on their bayonets in attempts to reach and kill American soldiers. In popular culture * Vic Hurley's history of the Moros, \\"Swish of the Kris The Story of the Moros\\" tells the story of Col. Alexander Rodgers using pigs to subdue the Moros in the Philippines. Hurley wrote that Col. Rodgers was known as \\"the Pig\\" to the Moros.Swish of the Kris p. 223, Cerebus books And another Hurley book \\"The Jungle Patrol, the story of the Philippine Constabulary\\" also relates the story of pigs being used against them. * Hurley wrote the screenplay for the Hollywood film The Real Glory in 1937; the film was released in 1939. It was based on a 1937 novel of the same name by Charles L. Clifford, a pen name of Hurley's. There is a scene in the movie where Gary Cooper as Dr. Bill Canavan drapes a captured Muslim in a pigskin. He proclaims that all slain Muslim rebels will be buried in pig skins to prevent their entry into paradise. The film served as American military propaganda, portraying the US Army as brave defenders of the local population being terrorised by the Moros, whom the film inaccurately depicts as bloodthirsty raiders oppressing the local Filipino community.

Respected for his guitar playing, Bloomfield knew and played with many of Chicago's blues musicians before achieving his own fame and was instrumental in popularizing blues music in the mid-1960s. He was ranked No. 22 on Rolling Stone's list of \\"100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time\\" in 2003 and No. 42 by the same magazine in 2011. He was inducted into the Blues Hall of Fame in 2012 and, as a member of the Paul Butterfield Blues Band, was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2015. Early years Bloomfield was born into a wealthy Chicago Jewish-American family. Bloomfield's father, Harold Bloomfield, was born in Chicago in 1914. Harold's father, Samuel Bloomfield, started Bloomfield Industries in the early 1930s. After Samuel passed away, Harold and his brother, Daniel, took over the company. Bloomfield's mother, Dorothy Klein, was born in Chicago in 1918 and married Harold in 1940. She came from an artistic, musical family, working as an actress and a model before marrying Harold. Bloomfield's family lived in various locations around Chicago before settling at 424 West Melrose Street on the North Side. When he was twelve his family moved to suburban Glencoe, Illinois, where he attended New Trier High School for two years. During this time, he began playing in local bands, and Bloomfield put together a group called the Hurricanes, named after Ohio rock band Johnny and the Hurricanes. New Trier High School expelled Bloomfield after his band performed a raucous rock and roll song at a 1959 school gathering. He attended Cornwall Academy in Massachusetts for one year and then returned to Chicago, where he spent his last year of education at a local YMCA school, Central YMCA High School. Bloomfield had attended a 1957 Chicago performance by blues singer Josh White, and began spending time in Chicago's South Side blues clubs and playing guitar with such black bluesmen as Sleepy John Estes, Yank Rachell, and Little Brother Montgomery. He first sat in with a black blues band in 1959, when he performed with Luther \\"Guitar Junior\\" Johnson at a Chicago club called the Place. He performed with Howlin' Wolf, Muddy Waters, and many other Chicago blues performers during the early 1960s. In 1962 he married Susan Smith. Writing in 2001, keyboardist, songwriter and record producer Al Kooper said Bloomfield's talent \\"was instantly obvious to his mentors. They knew this was not just another white boy; this was someone who truly understood what the blues were all about.\\" Among his early supporters were B.B. King, Muddy Waters, Bob Dylan and Buddy Guy. \\"Michael used to say, 'It's a natural. Black people suffer externally in this country. Jewish people suffer internally. The suffering's the mutual fulcrum for the blues.'\\" The Butterfield Band (1965 - 1967) In the early 1960s he met harmonica player and singer Paul Butterfield and guitarist Elvin Bishop, with whom he would later play in The Paul Butterfield Blues Band. He also began friendships and professional associations with fellow Chicagoan Nick Gravenites and Bronx-born record producer Norman Dayron, who was attending the University of Chicago. He developed a friendship with blues singer Big Joe Williams. In 1963 Bloomfield and his two friends George Mitchell and Pete Welding ran a weekly blues showcase at the Fickle Pickle. He subsequently built up his reputation in two Chicago clubs, Big John's and Magoo's. With help from his friend Joel Harlib, a Chicago photographer who became Bloomfield's de facto manager, he became a Columbia Records recording artist. In early 1964 Harlib took an audition tape by Bloomfield to Columbia producer and talent scout John Hammond, who signed him to Columbia's Epic Records label. Bloomfield recorded a few sessions for Columbia in 1964 that remained unreleased until after his death. In early 1965 he joined the Paul Butterfield Blues Band, which included Elvin Bishop and keyboardist Mark Naftalin, along with drummer Sam Lay and bassist Jerome Arnold, who had previously worked in Howlin' Wolf's band. Elektra Records producer Paul Rothchild recorded the band in spring 1965, but the majority of the tracks were not released until the 1990s. However, one of the tracks Rothchild recorded during his first pass at producing the group, a Nick Gravenites song titled \\"Born in Chicago,\\" was included on the Elektra album Folksong '65, which sold two hundred thousand copies when it was released in September 1965. \\"Born in Chicago\\" became an underground hit for the Butterfield Band. Their debut album, The Paul Butterfield Blues Band, was recorded in September and released the following month. In June 1965, Bloomfield had recorded with Bob Dylan, whom he had met in 1963 at a Chicago club called the Bear. The club was bankrolled by future Dylan and Butterfield manager Albert Grossman, who would play a major part in Bloomfield's career. Bloomfield's Telecaster guitar licks were featured on Dylan's \\"Like a Rolling Stone\\", a single produced by Columbia Record's Tom Wilson. Bloomfield would play on most of the tracks on Dylan's 1965 Highway 61 Revisited album, and he appeared onstage with Dylan in July at the Newport Folk Festival, where Dylan used Bloomfield and the Butterfield Band‚Äîminus Paul Butterfield‚Äîalong with keyboardists Al Kooper and Barry Goldberg. The show marked Dylan's first use of an electric band in a live performance, and Bloomfield's playing on the songwriter's \\"Maggie's Farm\\" is considered a landmark electric-guitar performance. After the Newport Folk Festival ended, Bloomfield helped Dylan complete the sessions for Highway 61 Revisited, and Dylan asked Bloomfield to join his touring band. Bloomfield demurred, preferring to continue playing with the Butterfield Band. After Sam Lay fell ill after a series of dates in November 1965, the Butterfield Band brought Chicago-born drummer Billy Davenport into the group. During the first part of 1966, the band played in California, and they recorded their second album, East-West, that summer. The record's title track found the band exploring modal music, and it was based upon a song Gravenites and Bloomfield had been playing since 1965, \\"It's About Time.\\" Bloomfield played on recording sessions between 1965 and 1967. His guitar playing had a huge impact on San Francisco Bay Area musicians after playing with the Butterfield band at Bill Graham‚Äôs Fillmore West. He became a mentor and teacher for many guitarists in the area. He did a 1965 date with Peter, Paul and Mary that resulted in a song called \\"The King of Names,\\" and he recorded in 1966 with pop group Chicago Loop, whose \\"When She Wants Good Lovin' (My Baby Comes to Me)\\" made Billboard Magazine's chart that year. He also played guitar on recordings by Chuck Berry, Mitch Ryder and James Cotton. The Electric Flag (1967 - 1968) Bloomfield tired of the Butterfield Band's rigorous touring schedule and, relocating to San Francisco, sought to create his own group. He formed the short-lived Electric Flag in 1967, with two longtime Chicago collaborators, Barry Goldberg and vocalist Nick Gravenites. The band featured a horn section. The band's rhythm section was composed of bassist Harvey Brooks and drummer Buddy Miles. Miles had previously played in Wilson Pickett's touring band, while Brooks had performed with Al Kooper in bands in New York City. The group's first effort was the soundtrack for director-producer Roger Corman's 1967 movie, The Trip, which was recorded in the spring of that year. The Electric Flag debuted at the 1967 Monterey Pop Festival and issued an album, A Long Time Comin', in April 1968 on Columbia Records. Critics complimented the group's distinctive, intriguing sound but found the record itself somewhat uneven. By that time, however, the band was already disintegrating; rivalries between members, shortsighted management, and heroin abuse all took their toll. Shortly after the release of that album, Bloomfield left his own band, with Gravenites, Goldberg, and bassist Harvey Brooks following.  Work with Al Kooper  Bloomfield also made an impact through his work with Al Kooper, who had played with Bloomfield on Dylan's \\"Like a Rolling Stone\\". Kooper had become an A&R; man for Columbia Records, and Bloomfield and Kooper had played piano on Moby Grape's 1968 Grape Jam, an instrumental album that had been packaged with the group's Wow collection. \\"Why not do an entire jam album together?\\" Kooper remembered in 1998, writing the booklet notes for the Bloomfield anthology Don't Say That I Ain't Your Man: Essential Blues, 1964‚Äì1969. \\"At the time, most jazz albums were made using this modus operandi: pick a leader or two co-leaders, hire appropriate sidemen, pick some tunes, make some up and record an entire album on the fly in one or two days. Why not try and legitimize rock by adhering to these standards? In addition, as a fan, I was dissatisfied with Bloomfield's recorded studio output up until then. It seemed that his studio work was inhibited and reined in, compared to his incendiary live performances. Could I put him in a studio setting where he could feel free to just burn like he did in live performances?\\" The result was Super Session, a jam album that spotlighted Bloomfield's guitar skills on one side. Bloomfield, who suffered from insomnia, left the sessions after the first day. Guitarist Stephen Stills completed the album with Kooper. It received excellent reviews and became the best-selling album of Bloomfield's career. Its success led to a live sequel, The Live Adventures of Mike Bloomfield and Al Kooper, recorded over three nights at Fillmore West in September 1968.  Solo work  Bloomfield continued with solo, session and back-up work from 1968 to 1980. He played guitar on Mother Earth's cover of Memphis Slim's \\"Mother Earth,\\" a track from their 1968 Living with the Animals album, and on two albums by Texas-born soul singer Wayne Talbert. With Mark Naftalin, he produced the 1968 sessions for James Cotton's 1968 album Cotton in Your Ears. He released his first solo album, It's Not Killing Me, in 1969. Bloomfield also helped Janis Joplin assemble her Kozmic Blues Band (for the album I Got Dem Ol' Kozmic Blues, Again Mama!) in 1969, co-wrote \\"Work Me, Lord\\" for the album, and played the guitar solo on Joplin's blues composition \\"One Good Man.\\" Columbia released another 1969 album, a live concert jam, Live at Bill Graham's Fillmore West, including Mark Naftalin, former Electric Flag bandmates Marcus Doubleday and Snooky Flowers, and a guest appearance by Taj Mahal. In the same year he reunited with Paul Butterfield and Sam Lay for the Chess Records album Fathers and Sons, featuring Muddy Waters and pianist Otis Spann. Bloomfield composed and recorded the soundtrack for the film Medium Cool, directed by his second cousin, Haskell Wexler. The film includes footage shot in Chicago during the 1968 Democratic National Convention. With Nick Gravenites, he produced blues guitarist Otis Rush's 1969 album Mourning in the Morning, recorded at FAME Studios in Muscle Shoals, Alabama with a band that included keyboardists Mark Naftalin and Barry Beckett, along with guitarist Duane Allman. During 1970 Bloomfield gave up playing because of his heroin addiction: He recorded his second solo album, Try It Before You Buy It, in 1973. Columbia rejected it; the complete version of the record would not appear until 1990. Also in 1973, he cut Triumvirate with Dr. John and guitarist and singer John Hammond Jr. In 1974, he rejoined the Electric Flag for an album titled The Band Kept Playing. In 1975 he recorded an album with the group KGB. The group's name is an acronym of the initials of singer and songwriter Ray Kennedy, Barry Goldberg and Bloomfield. The band also included Ric Grech and drummer Carmine Appice. Grech and Bloomfield quit shortly after its release. As the record hit stores in 1976, Bloomfield told journalists that the group had been an ill-conceived moneymaking project. The album was not well received by critics, but it did contain the standout track \\"Sail On, Sailor\\". Its authorship was credited to \\"Wilson-Kennedy\\", and had a bluesy, darker feel, along with Ray Kennedy's original cocaine-related lyrics. In the same year, he performed with John Cale on Cale's soundtrack for the film Caged Heat. In 1976 he recorded an instructional album for guitarists, If You Love These Blues, Play 'Em as You Please, which was financed through Guitar Player magazine. In the 1970s Bloomfield played in local San Francisco Bay area clubs, including the Keystone Korner, and sat in with other bands. In 1977, Bloomfield was selected by Andy Warhol to do the soundtrack for the pop artist's last film, Andy Warhol's Bad (also known as BAD). An unreleased single, \\"Andy's Bad\\", was also produced for the project. During 1979‚Äì1981 he performed often with the King Perkoff Band, sometimes introducing them as the \\"Michael Bloomfield and Friends\\" outfit. Bloomfield recorded \\"Hustlin' Queen\\", written by John Isabeau and Perkoff in 1979. He toured Italy and Sweden with guitarist Woody Harris and cellist Maggie Edmondson in the summer of 1980. He sat in with Bob Dylan at San Francisco's Warfield Theatre on November 15, 1980. Bloomfield played on Dylan's \\"Like a Rolling Stone\\" and \\"The Groom's Still Waiting at the Altar\\". He continued to play live dates, and his performance at San Francisco State College on February 7, 1981, would be his final appearance. Although Bloomfield came from a wealthy family, he never inherited a large lump sum. He received annual income from a trust that had been set up by his paternal grandfather, which gave him $50,000 each year. Death Bloomfield died in San Francisco on February 15, 1981. He was found seated behind the wheel of his car, with all four doors locked. According to police, an empty Valium bottle was found on the car seat, but no suicide note was found. The medical examiner who performed the autopsy ruled the death accidental, though he was unable to determine a cause of death, because no drugs were found in Bloomfield's system, and there were no signs of foul play. Bloomfield's last album, Cruisin' for a Bruisin', was released the day his death was announced. His remains are interred in a crypt at Hillside Memorial Park Cemetery, in Culver City, near Los Angeles. Style Bloomfield's musical influences include Scotty Moore, Chuck Berry, Little Richard, B.B. King, Big Joe Williams, Otis Rush, Albert King, Freddie King and Ray Charles. Bloomfield originally used a Fender Telecaster, though he had also used a Fender Duo-Sonic while recording for Columbia following his 1964 signing to the label. During his tenure with the Butterfield Blues Band he used that Tele on the first Butterfield Album and on their earliest tours in fall of 1965. By November he had swapped that guitar with International Submarine Band guitarist John Nuese for Nuese's 1954 Gibson Les Paul Goldtop model, which he used for some of the East-West sessions and which he acquired in Boston. In 1967, Bloomfield swapped the Goldtop with his friend repairman/musician Dan Erlewine for Dan's 1959 Les Paul Standard and $100. The Les Paul Standard had proven unpopular in the late 1950s because it was deemed too heavy and too expensive by rock and roll guitarists. Gibson discontinued manufacturing the model in 1960. Bloomfield used the Les Paul Standard in the Electric Flag and on the Super Session album and concerts. He later switched between the Les Paul and the Telecaster, but his use of the Les Paul inspired other guitarists to use the model and spurred Gibson to reintroduce the Les Paul Standard in 1968. Bloomfield eventually lost the guitar in Canada; Wolkin and Keenom's biography revealed that a club owner kept the guitar as partial compensation after Bloomfield cut short a round of appearances. This turned out to be accurate and the gig in question was at the Cave in Vancouver, booked from Tue. Nov. 12th 1974, for five days, until Sat. the 16th. The band played the first night but the next day, Bloomfield boarded a plane and flew home to San Francisco with virtually no notice to the club, hotel, or band members; his friend Mark Naftalin found a note on a torn piece of paper in the hotel room that read, \\"bye bye, sorry\\". Bloomfield's two guitars had been left at the club and were retained by club owner Stan Grozina, who wanted compensation for lost revenues. Unlike contemporaries such as Jimi Hendrix and Jeff Beck, Bloomfield rarely experimented with feedback and distortion, preferring a loud yet clean, almost chiming sound with a healthy amount of reverb and vibrato; this approach would strongly influence Jerry Garcia, who segued from a career in acoustic-based music to electric rock at the height of the Butterfield Band's influence in 1965. One of his amplifiers of choice was a 1965 Fender Twin Reverb. His solos, like those of most blues guitarists, were based in the minor pentatonic scale and the blues scale. However, his liberal use of chromatic notes within the pentatonic framework and his periodic lines based on Indian and Eastern modes allowed a considerable degree of fluidity in his solos. Gibson has since released a Michael Bloomfield Les Paul‚Äîreplicating his 1959 Standard‚Äîin recognition of his impact on the blues genre, his role in the revived production of the guitar, and his influence on many other guitarists. Because the actual guitar had been unaccounted for so many years, Gibson relied on hundreds of photographs provided by Bloomfield's family to reproduce the guitar. The model comes in two configurations‚Äîa clean Vintage Original Specifications (VOS) version, with only Bloomfield's mismatched volume and tone control knobs, missing toggle switch cover, and kidney-shaped tuners replacing the Gibson originals indicating its inspiration and a faithful, process-aged reproduction of the guitar as it was when Bloomfield played it last, complete with the finish smudge below the bridge and various nicks and smudges elsewhere around the body. His influence among contemporary guitarists continues to be widely felt, primarily in the techniques of vibrato, natural sustain, and economy of notes. Guitarists such as Joe Bonamassa, Arlen Roth, Carlos Santana, Slash, Jimmy Vivino, Chuck Hammer, Eric Johnson, Elliot Easton, Robben Ford, John Scofield, Jimmy Herring, Phil Keaggy, and G.E. Smith remain essentially influenced by Bloomfield's early recorded work.

Interest in the origins of the MahƒÅsƒÅ·πÉghika school lies in the fact that their Vinaya recension appears in several ways to represent an older redaction overall. Many scholars also look to the MahƒÅsƒÅ·πÉghika branch for the initial development of Mahayana Buddhism. Location Karli Chaitya section in perspective The original center of the MahƒÅsƒÅ·πÉghika sect was in Magadha, but they also maintained important centers such as in Mathura and Karli.Potter, Karl. Encyclopaedia of Indian Philosophies, Vol. 8: Buddhist Philosophy 100-350 AD. 2002. p. 23 The Kukku·π≠ikas were situated in eastern India around VƒÅrƒÅ·πáasƒ´ and PƒÅ·π≠aliputra and the Bahu≈õrutƒ´ya in Ko≈õala, Andhra, and Gandhara. The LokottaravƒÅda subschool itself claimed to be of the 'Middle Country', i.e. Ganges Basin region in the north of India. The MahƒÅsƒÅ·πÉghikas and the LokottaravƒÅda subschool also had centres in the Gandhara region.The EkavyƒÅvahƒÅrika are not known from later times.Warder, A.K. Indian Buddhism. 2000. p. 281-82 The Caitika branch was based in the Coastal Andhra region and especially at AmarƒÅvati and NƒÅgƒÅrjunako·πá·∏çƒÅ. This Caitika branch included the P≈´rva≈õailas, Apara≈õailas, RƒÅjagirikas, and the SiddhƒÅrthikas. Finally, Madhyadesa was home to the Praj√±aptivƒÅdins.Elizabeth Cook. Light of Liberation: A History of Buddhism in India. Dharma Publishing, 1992. p. 242-243 The ancient Buddhist sites in the lower Krishna Valley, including AmarƒÅvati, NƒÅgƒÅrjunako·πá·∏çƒÅ and Jaggayyape·π≠a, \\"can be traced to at least the third century BCE, if not earlier.\\"Padma, Sree. Barber, Anthony W. Buddhism in the Krishna River Valley of Andhra. SUNY Press 2008, pg. 2. The cave temples at the Aja·πá·π≠ƒÅ Caves, the Ellora Caves, and the Karla Caves are associated with the MahƒÅsƒÅ·πÉghikas.Gadkari, Jayant. Society and Religion: From Rgveda to Puranas. 1996. p. 198 Origins Most sources place the origin of the MahƒÅsƒÅ·πÉghikas to the Second Buddhist council. Traditions regarding the Second Council are confusing and ambiguous, but it is agreed that the overall result was the first schism in the Sangha between the Sthavira nikƒÅya and the MahƒÅsƒÅ·πÉghika nikƒÅya, although it is not agreed upon by all what the cause of this split was.Skilton, Andrew. A Concise History of Buddhism. 2004. p. 47 Andrew Skilton has suggested that the problems of contradictory accounts are solved by the MahƒÅsƒÅ·πÉghika ≈öƒÅriputraparip·πõcchƒÅ, which is the earliest surviving account of the schism.Skilton, Andrew. A Concise History of Buddhism. 2004. p. 48 In this account, the council was convened at PƒÅ·π≠aliputra over matters of vinaya, and it is explained that the schism resulted from the majority (MahƒÅsa·πÉgha) refusing to accept the addition of rules to the Vinaya by the minority (Sthaviras). The MahƒÅsƒÅ·πÉghikas therefore saw the Sthaviras as being a breakaway group which was attempting to modify the original Vinaya.Skilton, Andrew. A Concise History of Buddhism. 2004. p. 64 Scholars have generally agreed that the matter of dispute was indeed a matter of vinaya, and have noted that the account of the MahƒÅsƒÅ·πÉghikas is bolstered by the vinaya texts themselves, as vinayas associated with the Sthaviras do contain more rules than those of the MahƒÅsƒÅ·πÉghika vinaya. Modern scholarship therefore generally agrees that the MahƒÅsƒÅ·πÉghika vinaya is the oldest. According to Skilton, future historians may determine that a study of the MahƒÅsƒÅ·πÉghika school will contribute to a better understanding of the early Dhamma-Vinaya than the TheravƒÅda school. Appearance and language =Appearance= Eight Auspicious Signs of Buddhism Between 148 and 170 CE, the Parthian monk An Shigao came to China and translated a work which describes the color of monastic robes (Skt. kƒÅ·π£ƒÅya) utilized in five major Indian Buddhist sects, called Da Biqiu Sanqian Weiyi (Ch. Â§ßÊØî‰∏ò‰∏âÂçÉÂ®ÅÂÑÄ).Hino, Shoun. Three Mountains and Seven Rivers. 2004. p. 55 Another text translated at a later date, the ≈öƒÅriputraparip·πõcchƒÅ, contains a very similar passage corroborating this information. In both sources, the MahƒÅsƒÅ·πÉghikas are described as wearing yellow robes. The relevant portion of the ≈öƒÅriputraparip·πõcchƒÅ reads: The lower part of the yellow robe was pulled tightly to the left.Baruah, Bibhuti. Buddhist Sects and Sectarianism. 2008. p. 47 According to Dudjom Rinpoche from the tradition of Tibetan Buddhism, the robes of fully ordained MahƒÅsƒÅ·πÉghika monastics were to be sewn out of more than seven sections, but no more than twenty-three sections.Dudjom Rinpoche. Perfect Conduct: Ascertaining the Three Vows. 1999. p. 16 The symbols sewn on the robes were the endless knot (Skt. ≈õrƒ´vatsa) and the conch shell (Skt. ≈õa·πÖkha), two of the Eight Auspicious Signs in Buddhism. =Language= The Tibetan historian Buton Rinchen Drub (1290-1364) wrote that the MahƒÅsƒÅ·πÉghikas used PrƒÅkrit, the SarvƒÅstivƒÅdins Sanskrit, the SthaviravƒÅdins used Pai≈õƒÅcƒ´ and the Sa·πÉmitƒ´ya used Apabhra·πÉ≈õa.Yao, Zhihua.

Karla Caves, MahƒÅrƒÅ·π£tra, India. = List of doctrinal tenets = Andre Bareau, in his Buddhist sects of the small vehicle (1955), lists numerous doctrinal tenets as upheld by the MahƒÅsƒÅ·πÉghika. Some of these include:Andre Bareau, Les sectes bouddhiques du Petit V√©hicule (Ecole Fransaise d'Extreme-Orient, 1955), Chapitre I 'Les Mahasanghika', pp. 55-74. # The Buddhas are supramundane (lokottara), devoid of asravas and the mundane natures. # In all their words (vaca), Tathagatas turn the wheel of Dharma. They can also express all the Dharmadhatu in a single sound. # The material body (rupakaya), power (prabhava) and longevity of the Buddha is unlimited (ananta). # The Buddha does not sleep or dream. # The Tathagata answers questions without thinking. # Buddhas never say a word because they are always in samadhi, but beings, thinking that they utter words, jump for joy. # In a single moment of thought (ekaksanikacitta), Buddhas comprehend all dharmas. # The Buddhas remain in all directions. There are Buddhas everywhere in the four directions. # When the Bodhisattvas enter into a womb (garbha), they possess nothing impure and are entirely provided with organs and members, rather than developing gradually. When they enter a womb, Bodhisattvas also take on the appearance of a white elephant. # Bodhisattvas, because they want to help beings become perfect, make vows to be reborn in bad destinations. # The different aspects of the four noble truths are known in a single moment (ekaksanika). # The five sensory (indriya) faculties consist of balls of flesh, therefore only consciousness (vijnana) sees forms, hears sounds, etc. # There are no indeterminate (avyakrta) things (dharma), that is, there are no dharmas that are neither good nor bad. # When one enters certainty [to become a Buddha] (samyaktvaniyama) one has abandoned all the fetters (samyojana). # \\"Stream enterers\\" (srotapanna) can commit all misdeeds, except for the irremediable crimes (anantarya). # All sutras uttered by Buddha are nƒ´tƒÅrtha (\\"of plain or clear meaning\\"). # Since they do not know everything (sabba), there are Arhats who are subject to ignorance (avijja), who have doubts (kariksa), who are saved by others. # The self-presence of mind is bright. It is soiled (i.e. darkened) by adventitious secondary defilement. # The tendencies (anusaya) are neither consciousnesses (citta) nor mental factors (caitta), and are devoid of object (analambana). # The past and the future do not really exist. # 'There is no intermediate state (antarabhava). # Virtue (sila) is not mental (acetasika) and it is not consecutive to thought (cittanuparivatti). # Tendencies (anusaya) are indeterminate (abyakata), not- caused (ahetuka) and disjointed from thought (cittavippayutta). # There is a root-consciousness (m≈´lavij√±ƒÅna) which serves as the support (dsraya) for eye- perception and the other sensory perceptions, like the root of the tree is the principle of the leaves, etc. # The current consciousnesses (pavattivi√±√±ƒÅna) can be simultaneous (sahabhu) and do not carry karmic seeds (bija). # The path (marga) and the defilements (kle≈õa) appear together. # The act (karman) and its maturation (vipaka) evolve at the same time. # Material things last a long time and so go through transformation (as milk turns into curds), but mental factors and consciousnesses do not because they have a swift production and cessation. # Thought (citta) penetrates the whole body (kaya) and, depending on the object (visaya) and the support (acraya), it can contract or expand. Cave 1, Aja·πá·π≠ƒÅ Caves, MahƒÅrƒÅ·π£tra, India = Buddhas and bodhisattvas = The MahƒÅsƒÅ·πÉghikas advocated the transcendental and supramundane nature of the buddhas and bodhisattvas, and the fallibility of arhats.Baruah, Bibhuti. Buddhist Sects and Sectarianism. 2008. p. 48 Of the 48 special theses attributed by the Samayabhedoparacanacakra to the MahƒÅsƒÅ·πÉghika, EkavyƒÅvahƒÅrika, LokottaravƒÅda, and the Kukku·π≠ika, 20 concern the supramundane nature of buddhas and bodhisattvas.Sree Padma. Barber, Anthony W. Buddhism in the Krishna River Valley of Andhra. 2008. p. 56 According to the Samayabhedoparacanacakra, these four groups held that the Buddha is able to know all dharmas in a single moment of the mind.Yao, Zhihua. The Buddhist Theory of Self-Cognition. 2005. p. 11 Yao Zhihua writes: A doctrine ascribed to the MahƒÅsƒÅ·πÉghikas is, \\"The power of the tathƒÅgatas is unlimited, and the life of the buddhas is unlimited.\\"Tanaka, Kenneth. The Dawn of Chinese Pure Land Buddhist Doctrine. 1990. p. 8 According to Guang Xing, two main aspects of the Buddha can be seen in MahƒÅsƒÅ·πÉghika teachings: the true Buddha who is omniscient and omnipotent, and the manifested forms through which he liberates sentient beings through his skillful means (Skt. upƒÅya).Guang Xing. The Concept of the Buddha: Its Evolution from Early Buddhism to the Trikaya Theory. 2004. p. 53 For the MahƒÅsƒÅ·πÉghikas, the historical Gautama Buddha was merely one of these transformation bodies (Skt. nirmƒÅ·πáakƒÅya), while the essential real Buddha was equated with the DharmakƒÅya.Sree Padma. Barber, Anthony W. Buddhism in the Krishna River Valley of Andhra. 2008. pp. 59-60 The MahƒÅsƒÅ·πÉghika LokƒÅnuvartanƒÅ s≈´tra makes numerous supramundane claims about the Buddha, including that: * He was not produced through union of father and mother, but magically produced. * His feet never touch the ground or get dirty, his footprints are only a show. * His body and mouth does not get dirty, he only makes a show of cleaning himself. * He did not really suffer and struggle to attain enlightenment for six years, this was just a show. * He never gets hungry, he only manifests this in order to allow others to gain merit by giving. * He does not really produce human waste, this is only a show. * His body does not grow tired, ill or old, and is not affected by cold or heat, it only appears to have these qualities. Like the MahƒÅyƒÅna traditions, the MahƒÅsƒÅ·πÉghikas held the doctrine of the existence of many contemporaneous buddhas throughout the ten directions.Guang Xing. The Concept of the Buddha: Its Evolution from Early Buddhism to the Trikaya Theory. 2004. p. 65 In the MahƒÅsƒÅ·πÉghika LokƒÅnuvartana S≈´tra, it is stated, \\"The Buddha knows all the dharmas of the countless buddhas of the ten directions.\\" It is also stated, \\"All buddhas have one body, the body of the Dharma.\\" In the view of MahƒÅsƒÅ·πÉghikas, advanced bodhisattvas have severed the bonds of karma, and are born out of their own free will into lower states of existence (Skt. durgati) in order to help liberate other sentient beings. As described by Akira Hirakawa:Williams, Paul. The Origins and Nature of MahƒÅyƒÅna Buddhism. 2004. p. 182 The concept of many bodhisattvas simultaneously working toward buddhahood is also found among the MahƒÅsƒÅ·πÉghika tradition, and further evidence of this is given in the Samayabhedoparacanacakra, which describes the doctrines of the MahƒÅsƒÅ·πÉghikas.Guang Xing. The Concept of the Buddha: Its Evolution from Early Buddhism to the Trikaya Theory. 2004. p. 66 These two concepts of contemporaneous bodhisattvas and contemporaneous buddhas were linked in some traditions, and texts such as the MahƒÅpraj√±ƒÅpƒÅramitƒÅupade≈õa use the principle of contemporaneous bodhisattvas to demonstrate the necessity of contemporaneous buddhas throughout the ten directions.Guang Xing. The Concept of the Buddha: Its Evolution from Early Buddhism to the Trikaya Theory. 2004. pp. 65-66 It is thought that the doctrine of contemporaneous buddhas was already old and well established by the time of early MahƒÅyƒÅna texts such as the A·π£·π≠asƒÅhasrikƒÅ Praj√±ƒÅpƒÅramitƒÅ S≈´tra, due to the clear presumptions of this doctrine. =Mundane and supramundane= The MahƒÅsƒÅ·πÉghikas held that the teachings of the Buddha were to be understood as having two principal levels of truth: a relative or conventional (Skt. sa·πÉv·πõti) truth, and the absolute or ultimate (Skt. paramƒÅrtha) truth. For the MahƒÅsƒÅ·πÉghika branch of Buddhism, the final and ultimate meaning of the Buddha's teachings was \\"beyond words,\\" and words were merely the conventional exposition of the Dharma.Buescher, John. Echoes from an Empty Sky: The Origins of the Buddhist Doctrine of the Two Truths. 2005. p. 46 K. Venkata Ramanan writes:Ramanan, K. Venkata. NƒÅgƒÅrjuna's Philosophy. 1998. pp. 62-63 Texts According to Bart Dessein, the Mohe sengzhi lu (MahƒÅsƒÅ·πÉghika Vinaya) provides some insight into the format of this school's textual canon. They appear to have had a Vinaya in five parts, an Abhidharmapi·π≠aka, and a Sutrapi·π≠aka: > Of these texts, their Vinaya was translated into Chinese by Buddhabhadra and > Faxian between 416 and 418 CE in the Daochang Monastery in Nanjing, capital > of the Eastern Jin Dynasty. In this text, their Abhidharma is defined as > \\"the s≈´trƒÅnta in nine parts\\" (navƒÅ·πÖga). This suggests that the early > MahƒÅsƒÅ·πÉghikas rejected the abhidharmic developments that occurred within > SarvƒÅstivƒÅda circles. As is the case with their Vinayapi·π≠aka, also their > Sutrapi·π≠aka seems to have consisted of five parts (ƒÅgama): > *Dƒ´rghƒÅgama,*MadhyamƒÅgama,*Sa·πÉyuktƒÅgama, *EkottarƒÅgama and *K·π£udrakƒÅgama. Dessein also mentions that the school probably also had a Bodhisattvapi·π≠aka, which included material that \\"in all likelihood consisted of texts that formed part of the early development of the bodhisattva path as an alternative career to that of the arhant, perhaps serving as a foundation for the later developments of the bodhisattva doctrine\\". =Abhidharma= According to some sources, abhidharma was not accepted as canonical by the MahƒÅsƒÅ·πÉghika school.\\"Abhidhamma Pitaka.\\" Encyclop√¶dia Britannica. Ultimate Reference Suite. Chicago: Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, 2008. The TheravƒÅdin Dƒ´pava·πÉsa, for example, records that the MahƒÅsƒÅ·πÉghikas had no abhidharma.Walser, Joseph. NƒÅgƒÅrjuna in Context: MahƒÅyƒÅna Buddhism and Early Indian Culture. 2005. p. 213 However, other sources indicate that there were such collections of abhidharma. During the early 5th century, the Chinese pilgrim Faxian is said to have found a MahƒÅsƒÅ·πÉghika abhidharma at a monastery in PƒÅ·π≠aliputra. When Xuanzang visited DhƒÅnyaka·π≠aka, he wrote that the monks of this region were MahƒÅsƒÅ·πÉghikas, and mentions the P≈´rva≈õailas specifically.Baruah, Bibhuti. Buddhist Sects and Sectarianism. 2008. p. 437 Near DhƒÅnyaka·π≠aka, he met two MahƒÅsƒÅ·πÉghika bhik·π£us and studied MahƒÅsƒÅ·πÉghika abhidharma with them for several months, during which time they also studied various MahƒÅyƒÅna ≈õƒÅstras together under Xuanzang's direction. On the basis of textual evidence as well as inscriptions at NƒÅgƒÅrjunako·πá·∏çƒÅ, Joseph Walser concludes that at least some MahƒÅsƒÅ·πÉghika sects probably had an abhidharma collection, and that it likely contained five or six books.Walser, Joseph. NƒÅgƒÅrjuna in Context: MahƒÅyƒÅna Buddhism and Early Indian Culture. 2005. pp. 212-213 = MahƒÅvastu = The MahƒÅvastu (Sanskrit for \\"Great Event\\" or \\"Great Story\\") is the most well known of the LokottaravƒÅda branch of the MahƒÅsƒÅ·πÉghika school. It is a preface to their Vinaya Pitaka and contains numerous JƒÅtaka and AvadƒÅna tales, stories of past lives of the Buddha and other bodhisattvas.\\"MahƒÅvastu\\" (2008). It is considered a primary source for the notion of a transcendent (lokottara) Buddha, who across his countless past lives developed various abilities such as omniscience (sarvaj√±ana), the lack of any need for sleep or food and being born painlessly without the need for intercourse.Williams (1989/2007), pp. 18‚Äì19 The text shows strong parallels with the Pali Mahakhandhaka. = Sariputrapariprccha = The ≈öariputraparip·πõcchƒÅ (Shelifu Wen Jing, ËàçÂà©ÂºóÂïèÁ∂ì, Taisho 1465, p. 900b), translated into Chinese between 317 and 420, is a Mahasamghika Vinaya work which also provides a history of early Buddhism and its schisms.Lamotte, Etienne, History of Indian Buddhism: From the Origins to the Saka Era, p. 189. = LokƒÅnuvartanƒÅ s≈´tra = The LokƒÅnuvartanƒÅ s≈´tra (Chinese: ‰ΩõË™¨ÂÜÖËóèÁôæÂØ∂Á∂ì, pinyin : f√≥shu≈ç n√®i z√†ng b«éi b«éo jƒ´ng) is a text preserved in some Sanskrit fragments as well as in Tibetan and Chinese translation. It is one of three texts belonging to the MahƒÅsƒÅ·πÉghika in the Chinese Buddhist canon (Taish≈ç Tripi·π≠aka , Volume 17, text No. 807).Xing, Guang, The LokƒÅnuvartanƒÅ S≈´tra, Journal of Buddhist Studies,Vol IV, 2006. = Satyasiddhisastra = The Tattvasiddhi-≈öƒÅstra (\\"the treatise that accomplishes reality\\"; C: ÊàêÂØ¶Ë´ñ, Chengshilun), is an Abhidharma work by a figure known as Harivarman (250-350). Some scholars including A.K. Warder, attribute the work to the Bahusrutiyas, however others disagree and see it as a Sautrantika work.Warder, A.K. Indian Buddhism, page 398.Lin, Qian. Mind in Dispute: The Section on Mind in Harivarman‚Äôs *Tattvasiddhi, University of Washington Chinese sources mention that he was initially a Sautrantika teacher who later lived with the Mahasamghikas. = Manuscript Collections = The Chinese Buddhist monk Xuanzang visited a MahƒÅsƒÅ·πÉghika-LokottaravƒÅda vihara in the 7th century at Bamyan, Afghanistan, and this monastery site has since been rediscovered by archaeologists. Birch bark manuscripts and palm-leaf manuscripts of texts in this monastery's collection, including Mahayana sutras, have been discovered at the site, and these are now located in the Sch√∏yen Collection. Some manuscripts are in the GƒÅndhƒÅrƒ´ language and Kharo·π£·π≠hƒ´ script, while others are in Sanskrit and written in forms of the Gupta script. Manuscripts and fragments that have survived from this monastery's collection include the following source texts: * PrƒÅtimok·π£a Vibha·πÖga of the MahƒÅsƒÅ·πÉghika-LokottaravƒÅda (MS 2382/269) * MahƒÅparinirvƒÅ·πáa S≈´tra, a sutra from the ƒÄgamas (MS 2179/44) * Ca·πÉgƒ´ S≈´tra, a s≈´tra from the ƒÄgamas (MS 2376) * Diamond Sutra, a Mahayana sutra (MS 2385) * Bhai·π£ajyaguru S≈´tra, a Mahayana sutra (MS 2385) * ≈örƒ´mƒÅlƒÅdevƒ´ Si·πÉhanƒÅda S≈´tra, a Mahayana sutra (MS 2378) * PravƒÅra·πáa S≈´tra, a Mahayana sutra (MS 2378) * Sarvadharmaprav·πõttinirde≈õa S≈´tra, a Mahayana sutra (MS 2378) * AjƒÅta≈õatrukauk·πõtyavinodana S≈´tra, a Mahayana sutra (MS 2378) * ≈öƒÅriputrƒÅbhidharma (MS 2375/08) Relationship to MahƒÅyƒÅna Sculpture of the Buddha from Mathura. 5th or 6th century CE =Acceptance of MahƒÅyƒÅna= In the 6th century CE, ParamƒÅrtha, a Buddhist monk from Ujjain in central India, wrote about a special affiliation of the MahƒÅsƒÅ·πÉghika school with the MahƒÅyƒÅna tradition. He associates the initial composition and acceptance of MahƒÅyƒÅna s≈´tras with the MahƒÅsƒÅ·πÉghika branch of Buddhism.Walser, Joseph. NƒÅgƒÅrjuna in Context: MahƒÅyƒÅna Buddhism and Early Indian Culture. 2005. p. 50 He states that 200 years after the parinirvƒÅ·πáa of the Buddha, much of the MahƒÅsƒÅ·πÉghika school moved north of RƒÅjag·πõha, and were divided over whether the MahƒÅyƒÅna teachings should be incorporated formally into their Tripi·π≠aka. According to this account, they split into three groups based upon the relative manner and degree to which they accepted the authority of these MahƒÅyƒÅna texts.Walser, Joseph. NƒÅgƒÅrjuna in Context: MahƒÅyƒÅna Buddhism and Early Indian Culture. 2005. p. 51 ParamƒÅrtha states that the Kukku·π≠ika sect did not accept the MahƒÅyƒÅna s≈´tras as buddhavacana (\\"words of the Buddha\\"), while the LokottaravƒÅda sect and the EkavyƒÅvahƒÅrika sect did accept the MahƒÅyƒÅna s≈´tras as buddhavacana.Sree Padma. Barber, Anthony W. Buddhism in the Krishna River Valley of Andhra. 2008. p. 68. Paramartha's report states: > In this school, there were some who believed these sutras and some who did > not. Those who did not believe them . . . said that such sutras are made by > man and are not proclaimed by the Buddha, . . . that the disciples of the > Lesser Vehicle only believe in the Tripitaka, because they did not > personally hear the Buddha proclaim the Greater Vehicle. Among those who > believed these sutras, there were some who did so because they had > personally heard the Buddha proclaim the Greater Vehicle and therefore > believed these sutras; others believed them, because it can be known through > logical analysis that there is this principle [of the Greater Vehicle]; and > some believed them because they believed their masters. Those who did not > believe [them] did so because these sutras were self-made and because they > were not included in the five Agamas.Sree Padma. Barber, Anthony W. Buddhism > in the Krishna River Valley of Andhra. 2008. pp. 153-154 ParamƒÅrtha also wrote about the origins of the Bahu≈õrutƒ´ya sect in connection with acceptance of MahƒÅyƒÅna teachings. According to his account, the founder of the Bahu≈õrutƒ´ya sect was named YƒÅj√±avalkya.Warder, A.K. Indian Buddhism. 2000. p. 267 In ParamƒÅrtha's account, YƒÅj√±avalkya is said to have lived during the time of the Buddha, and to have heard his discourses, but was in a profound state of samƒÅdhi during the time of the Buddha's parinirvƒÅ·πáa. After YƒÅj√±avalkya emerged from this samƒÅdhi 200 years later, he discovered that the MahƒÅsƒÅ·πÉghikas were teaching only the superficial meaning of the s≈´tras, and therefore founded the Bahu≈õrutƒ´ya sect in order to expound the full meaning. According to ParamƒÅrtha, the Bahu≈õrutƒ´ya school was formed in order to fully embrace both \\"conventional truth\\" and \\"ultimate truth.\\"Walser, Joseph. NƒÅgƒÅrjuna in Context: MahƒÅyƒÅna Buddhism and Early Indian Culture. 2005. p. 52 Bart Dessein links the Bahu≈õrutƒ´ya understanding of this full exposition to the MahƒÅyƒÅna teachings.Sree Padma. Barber, Anthony W. Buddhism in the Krishna River Valley of Andhra. 2008. p. 61 In his writings, ParamƒÅrtha also indicated as much:Walser, Joseph. NƒÅgƒÅrjuna in Context: MahƒÅyƒÅna Buddhism and Early Indian Culture. 2005. pp. 51-52 =Royal patronage= Some early MahƒÅyƒÅna s≈´tras reference wealthy female donors and provide evidence that they were developed in the ƒÄndhra region, where the MahƒÅsƒÅ·πÉghika Caitika groups were predominant. The MahƒÅyƒÅna MahƒÅmegha S≈´tra, for example, gives a prophecy about a royal princess of the ≈öatavƒÅhana dynasty who will live in ƒÄndhra, along the K·πõ·π£·πáa River, in DhƒÅnyaka·π≠aka, seven hundred years after the parinirvƒÅ·πáa of the Buddha. Several scholars such as √âtienne Lamotte, and Alex and Hideko Wayman, associate the ƒÄndra Ik·π£vƒÅku dynasty with patronage of MahƒÅyƒÅna s≈´tras.Osto, Douglas. Power, Wealth and Women in Indian MahƒÅyƒÅna Buddhism: The Ga·πá·∏çavy≈´ha- s≈´tra 2011. pp. 114-115 Epigraphic evidence at NƒÅgƒÅrjuniko·πá·∏ça also provides abundant evidence of royal and wealthy female donors. =Praj√±ƒÅpƒÅramitƒÅ= A number of scholars have proposed that the MahƒÅyƒÅna Praj√±ƒÅpƒÅramitƒÅ teachings were first developed by the Caitika subsect of the MahƒÅsƒÅ·πÉghikas. They believe that the A·π£·π≠asƒÅhasrikƒÅ Praj√±ƒÅpƒÅramitƒÅ S≈´tra originated amongst the southern MahƒÅsƒÅ·πÉghika schools of the ƒÄndhra region, along the K·πõ·π£·πáa River. Guang Xing states, \\"Several scholars have suggested that the Praj√±ƒÅpƒÅramitƒÅ probably developed among the MahƒÅsƒÅ·πÉghikas in southern India, in the ƒÄndhra country, on the K·πõ·π£·πáa River.\\" These MahƒÅsƒÅ·πÉghikas had two famous monasteries near AmarƒÅvati and the DhƒÅnyaka·π≠aka, which gave their names to the schools of the P≈´rva≈õailas and the Apara≈õailas. Each of these schools had a copy of the A·π£·π≠asƒÅhasrikƒÅ Praj√±ƒÅpƒÅramitƒÅ S≈´tra in Prakrit. Guang Xing also assesses the view of the Buddha given in the A·π£·π≠asƒÅhasrikƒÅ Praj√±ƒÅpƒÅramitƒÅ S≈´tra as being that of the MahƒÅsƒÅ·πÉghikas. Edward Conze estimates that this s≈´tra originated around 100 BCE. =TathƒÅgatagarbha= Cave complex associated with the MahƒÅsƒÅ·πÉghika sect. Karla Caves, MahƒÅrƒÅ·π£tra, India Brian Edward Brown, a specialist in TathƒÅgatagarbha doctrines, writes that it has been determined that the composition of the ≈örƒ´mƒÅlƒÅdevƒ´ Si·πÉhanƒÅda S≈´tra occurred during the ƒ™k·π£vƒÅku Dynasty in the 3rd century as a product of the MahƒÅsƒÅ·πÉghikas of the ƒÄndhra region (i.e. the Caitika schools).Brown, Brian Edward. The Buddha Nature: A Study of the TathƒÅgatagarbha and ƒÄlayavij√±ƒÅna. 2010. p. 3 Wayman has outlined eleven points of complete agreement between the MahƒÅsƒÅ·πÉghikas and the ≈örƒ´mƒÅlƒÅ, along with four major arguments for this association. Anthony Barber also associates the earlier development of the TathƒÅgatagarbha S≈´tra with the MahƒÅsƒÅ·πÉghikas, and concludes that the MahƒÅsƒÅ·πÉghikas of the ƒÄndhra region were responsible for the inception of the TathƒÅgatagarbha doctrine.Sree Padma. Barber, Anthony W. Buddhism in the Krishna River Valley of Andhra. 2008. pp. 155-156 According to Stephen Hodge, internal textual evidence in the A·πÖgulimƒÅlƒ´ya S≈´tra, MahƒÅbherihƒÅraka Parivarta S≈´tra, and the MahƒÅyƒÅna MahƒÅparinirvƒÅ·πáa S≈´tra, indicates that these texts were first circulated in South India and then gradually propagated up to the northwest, with Kashmir being the other major center. The A·πÖgulimƒÅlƒ´ya S≈´tra gives a more detailed account by mentioning the points of distribution as including South India, the Vindhya Range, Bharuch, and Kashmir. The language used in the MahƒÅyƒÅna MahƒÅparinirvƒÅ·πáa S≈´tra and related texts, seems to indicate a region in southern India during the time of the ≈öƒÅtavƒÅhana Dynasty. The ≈öƒÅtavƒÅhana rulers gave rich patronage to Buddhism, and were involved with the development of the cave temples at Karla and Aja·πá·π≠ƒÅ, and also with the Great St≈´pa at AmarƒÅvati. During this time, the ≈öƒÅtavƒÅhana Dynasty also maintained extensive links with the Ku·π£ƒÅ·πáa Empire. Using textual evidence in the MahƒÅyƒÅna MahƒÅparinirvƒÅ·πáa S≈´tra and related texts, Stephen Hodge estimates a compilation period between 100 CE and 220 CE for the MahƒÅyƒÅna MahƒÅparinirvƒÅ·πáa S≈´tra. Hodge summarizes his findings as follows: In the 6th century CE, ParamƒÅrtha wrote that the MahƒÅsƒÅ·πÉghikas revere the s≈´tras which teach the TathƒÅgatagarbha. =Bodhisattva canons= Within the MahƒÅsƒÅ·πÉghika branch, the Bahu≈õrutƒ´yas are said to have included a Bodhisattva Pi·π≠aka in their canon, and ParamƒÅrtha wrote that the Bahu≈õrutƒ´yas accepted both the Hƒ´nayƒÅna and MahƒÅyƒÅna teachings. In the 6th century CE, BhƒÅvaviveka speaks of the SiddhƒÅrthikas using a VidyƒÅdhƒÅra Pi·π≠aka, and the P≈´rva≈õailas and Apara≈õailas both using a Bodhisattva Pi·π≠aka, all implying collections of MahƒÅyƒÅna texts within the MahƒÅsƒÅ·πÉghika schools.Walser, Joseph. NƒÅgƒÅrjuna in Context: MahƒÅyƒÅna Buddhism and Early Indian Culture. 2005. p. 53 During the same period, Avalokitavrata speaks of the MahƒÅsƒÅ·πÉghikas using a \\"Great ƒÄgama Pi·π≠aka,\\" which is then associated with MahƒÅyƒÅna s≈´tras such as the Praj√±ƒÅparamitƒÅ and the Da≈õabh≈´mika S≈´tra. =Views of scholars= Since at least the Meiji period in Japan, some scholars of Buddhism have looked to the MahƒÅsƒÅ·πÉghika as the originators of MahƒÅyƒÅna Buddhism.Williams, Paul. The Origins and Nature of MahƒÅyƒÅna Buddhism. 2004. p. 380 According to Akira Hirakawa, modern scholars often look to the MahƒÅsƒÅ·πÉghikas as the originators of MahƒÅyƒÅna Buddhism.Williams, Paul. The Origins and Nature of MahƒÅyƒÅna Buddhism. 2004. pp. 181-2 According to A.K. Warder, it is \\"clearly\\" the case that the MahƒÅyƒÅna teachings originally came from the MahƒÅsƒÅ·πÉghika branch of Buddhism.Warder, A.K. Indian Buddhism. 2000. p. 11 Warder holds that \\"the MahƒÅyƒÅna originated in the south of India and almost certainly in the ƒÄndhra country.\\"Warder, A.K. Indian Buddhism. 2000. p. 313 Anthony Barber and Sree Padma note that \\"historians of Buddhist thought have been aware for quite some time that such pivotally important Mahayana Buddhist thinkers as NƒÅgƒÅrjuna, Dignaga, Candrakƒ´rti, ƒÄryadeva, and Bhavaviveka, among many others, formulated their theories while living in Buddhist communities in ƒÄndhra.\\"Padma, Sree. Barber, Anthony W. Buddhism in the Krishna River Valley of Andhra. 2008. p. 1 Andr√© Bareau has stated that there can be found MahƒÅyƒÅna ontology prefigured in the MahƒÅsƒÅ·πÉghika schools, and has offered an array of evidence to support this conclusion.Ray, Reginald. Buddhist Saints in India: A Study in Buddhist Values and Orientations. 1999. p. 426 Bareau traces the origin of the MahƒÅyƒÅna tradition to the older MahƒÅsƒÅ·πÉghika schools in regions such as Odisha, Kosala, Ko√±kana, and so on. He then cites the Bahu≈õrutƒ´yas and Praj√±aptivƒÅdins as sub-sects of the MahƒÅsƒÅ·πÉghika that may have played an important role in bridging the flow of MahƒÅyƒÅna teachings between the northern and southern MahƒÅsƒÅ·πÉghika traditions. Andr√© Bareau also mentions that according to Xuanzang and Yijing in the 7th century CE, the MahƒÅsƒÅ·πÉghika schools had essentially disappeared, and instead these travelers found what they described as \\"MahƒÅyƒÅna.\\" The region occupied by the MahƒÅsƒÅ·πÉghika was then an important center for MahƒÅyƒÅna Buddhism. Bareau has proposed that MahƒÅyƒÅna grew out of the MahƒÅsƒÅ·πÉghika schools, and the members of the MahƒÅsƒÅ·πÉghika schools also accepted the teachings of the MahƒÅyƒÅna. Additionally, the extant MahƒÅsƒÅ·πÉghika Vinaya was originally procured by Faxian in the early 5th century CE at what he describes as a \\"MahƒÅyƒÅna\\" monastery in PƒÅ·π≠aliputra.Walser, Joseph. NƒÅgƒÅrjuna in Context: MahƒÅyƒÅna Buddhism and Early Indian Culture. 2005. p. 40 Vinaya Recension Cave temple associated with the MahƒÅsƒÅ·πÉghikas. Ellora Caves =Early features= The MahƒÅsƒÅ·πÉghika Vinaya recension is essentially very similar to the other recensions, as they all are to each other. The MahƒÅsƒÅ·πÉghika recension differs most from the other recensions in structure, but the rules are generally identical in meaning, if the Vibhangas (explanations) are compared. The features of the MahƒÅsƒÅ·πÉghika Vinaya recension which suggest that it might be an older redaction are, in brief, these: The Bhiksu-prakirnaka and Bhiksuni- prakirnaka and the Bhiksu-abhisamacarika-dharma sections of the MahƒÅsƒÅ·πÉghika Vinaya are generally equivalent to the Khandhakas/ Skandhakas of the Sthavira derived schools. However, their structure is simpler, and according to recent research by Clarke, the structure follows a matika (Matrix) which is also found embedded in the Vinayas of several of the Sthavira schools, suggesting that it is presectarian. The sub-sections of the Prakirnaka sections are also titled pratisamyukta rather than Skandhaka / Khandhaka. Pratisamyukta / Patisamyutta means a section or chapter in a collection organised by subject; the 'samyukta-principle', like the Samyutta-Nikaya / Samyukta-agama. Scholars such as Master Yin Shun, Choong Moon Keat, and Bhikkhu Sujato have argued that the Samyutta / Samyukta represents the earliest collection among the Nikayas / Agamas, and this may well imply that it is also the oldest organising principle too. (N.B. this does not necessarily say anything about the age of the contents). There are also fewer stories in general in the Vinaya of the subsidiary school, the MahƒÅsƒÅ·πÉghika-LokottaravƒÅda, and many of them give the appearance of badly connected obvious interpolations, whereas in the structure of the Sthavira recensions the stories are integrated into the whole scheme. In the formulations of some of the pratimoksha rules also, the phrasing (though generally identical in meaning to the other recensions) often appears to represent a clearer but less streamlined version, which suggests it might be older. This is particularly noticeable in the Bhiksuni-Vinaya, which has not been as well preserved as the Bhiksu-Vinaya in general in all the recensions. Yet the formulation of certain rules which seem very confused in the other recensions (e.g. Bhikkhuni Sanghadisesa three = six in the Ma-L) seems to better represent what would be expected of a root formulation which could lead to the variety of confused formulations we see (presumably later) in the other recensions. The formulation of this rule (as an example) also reflects a semi-parallel formulation to a closely related rule for Bhiksus which is found in a more similar form in all the Vinayas (Pc64 in Pali). =Depiction of Devadatta= According to Reginald Ray, the MahƒÅsƒÅ·πÉghika Vinaya mentions the figure of Devadatta, but in a way that is different from the vinayas of the Sthavira branch. According to this study, the earliest vinaya material common to all sects simply depicts Devadatta as a Buddhist saint who wishes for the monks to live a rigorous lifestyle.Ray, Reginald. Buddhist Saints in India: A Study in Buddhist Values and Orientations. 1999. p. 168 This has led Ray to regard the story of Devadatta as a legend produced by the Sthavira group.Ray, Reginald. Buddhist Saints in India: A Study in Buddhist Values and Orientations. 1999. pp. 169-170 However, upon examining the same vinaya materials, Bhikkhu Sujato has written that the portrayals of Devadatta are largely consistent between the MahƒÅsƒÅ·πÉghika Vinaya and the other vinayas, and that the supposed discrepancy is simply due to the minimalist literary style of the MahƒÅsƒÅ·πÉghika Vinaya. He also points to other parts of the MahƒÅsƒÅ·πÉghika Vinaya that clearly portray Devadatta as a villain, as well as similar portrayals that exist in the LokottaravƒÅdin MahƒÅvastu. =Chinese translation= The MahƒÅsƒÅ·πÉghika Vinaya is extant in the Chinese Buddhist Canon as Mohesengzhi L√º (Êë©Ë®∂ÂÉßÁ•óÂæã; Taish≈ç Tripi·π≠aka 1425). The vinaya was originally procured by Faxian in the early 5th century CE at a MahƒÅyƒÅna monastery in PƒÅ·π≠aliputra. This vinaya was then translated into Chinese as a joint effort between Faxian and Buddhabhadra in 416 CE, and the completed translation is 40 fascicles in length.Rulu. Bodhisattva Precepts. 2012. p. 7 According to Faxian, in Northern India, the vinaya teachings were typically only passed down by tradition through word of mouth and memorization. For this reason, it was difficult for him to procure manuscripts of the vinayas that were used in India. The MahƒÅsƒÅ·πÉghika Vinaya was reputed to be the original vinaya from the lifetime of the Buddha, and \\"the most correct and complete.\\"Beal, Samuel (tr.). Travels of Fa-hian, or Fo-kw≈è-ki. 1885. p. lxxi =Legacy= Although Faxian procured the MahƒÅsƒÅ·πÉghika Vinaya in India and had this translated into Chinese, the tradition of Chinese Buddhism eventually settled on the Dharmaguptaka Vinaya instead. At the time of Faxian, the SarvƒÅstivƒÅda Vinaya was the most common vinaya tradition in China. In the 7th century, Yijing wrote that in eastern China, most people followed the Dharmaguptaka Vinaya, while the MahƒÅsƒÅ·πÉghika Vinaya was used in earlier times in Guanzhong (the region around Chang'an), and that the SarvƒÅstivƒÅda Vinaya was prominent in the Yangzi region and further south.Mohr, Thea. Tsedroen, Jampa. Dignity and Discipline: Reviving Full Ordination for Buddhist Nuns. 2010. p. 187 In the 7th century, the existence of multiple Vinaya lineages throughout China was criticized by prominent Vinaya masters such as Yijing and Dao'an (654‚Äì717). In the early 8th century, Dao'an gained the support of Emperor Zhongzong of Tang, and an imperial edict was issued that the sa·πÉgha in China should use only the Dharmaguptaka Vinaya for ordination.Heirman, Ann. Bumbacher, Stephan Peter. The Spread of Buddhism. 2007. pp. 194-195 Ati≈õa was ordained in the MahƒÅsƒÅ·πÉghika lineage. However, because the Tibetan Emperor Ralpacan had decreed that only the M≈´lasarvƒÅstivƒÅda order would be permitted in Tibet, he did not ordain anyone.

The river eventually breached the bridge and washed much of it away, but the event is remembered in local legends of the Native Americans as the Bridge of the Gods. Greenleaf Peak and the Bonneville landslide from Bonneville Dam The Bridge of the Gods is also the name of a modern manmade bridge, across the Columbia River between Oregon and Washington. The southern face of Greenleaf Peak The southern face of Table Mountain Geologic history Interpretations of the age of the Bonneville landslide have evolved as more investigators have studied it and as more modern dating techniques have become available. Early work based on dendrochronology and radiocarbon dating suggested the landslide occurred between AD 1060 and 1180 or between 1250 and 1280. The year 1100 has often been cited as the date of the Bonneville landslide. More recent work using radiocarbon dating and lichenometry has suggested dates between 1500 and 1760 or between 1670 and 1760. These younger radiocarbon ages permitted a possible link to the 1700 Cascadia earthquake. However, more recent investigations using radiocarbon dating and dendrochronology show the landslide occurred around 1450, that could be associated with an earlier great earthquake that occurred in the mid-fifteenth century. The Bonneville landslide sent a large amount of debris south from Table Mountain and Greenleaf Peak, covering more than . The debris slid into the Columbia Gorge close to modern-day Cascade Locks, Oregon, blocking the Columbia River with a natural dam approximately high and long. The impounded river formed a lake and drowned a forest of trees for about . Native Americans might have crossed the river on the dam or, as their oral histories say, a bridge. Although no one knows how long it took, the Columbia River eventually broke through the dam and washed away most of the debris, forming the Cascades Rapids, themselves submerged in 1938 by the construction of the Bonneville Dam. Geologists have determined that debris from several distinct landslides in the same area overlap, forming what is called the Cascades landslide complex. The Bonneville landslide was the most recent, and perhaps the largest landslide of the complex. Studies to understand the nature of the landslide complex and to map the lobes of individual landslide events were undertaken during the 1960s and 1970s. The composite nature of the landslide complex may explain the early discrepancies between date estimates of the Bonneville Landslide. Native American legend Native American lore contains numerous legends to explain the eruptions of Mount St. Helens and other volcanoes in the Cascade Volcanic Arc. The most famous of these is the Bridge of the Gods legend told by the Klickitats. In their tale, the chief of all the gods, Tyhee Saghalie and his two sons, Pahto (also called Klickitat) and Wy'east, traveled down the Columbia River from the Far North in search of a suitable area to settle.Archie Satterfield, Country Roads of Washington (Backinprint.com: 2003) , page 82 They came upon an area that is now called The Dalles and thought they had never seen a land so beautiful. The sons quarreled over the land and to solve the dispute, their father shot two arrows from his mighty bow; one to the north and the other to the south. Pahto followed the arrow to the north and settled there while Wy'east did the same for the arrow to the south. Saghalie then built Tanmahawis, the Bridge of the Gods, so his family could meet periodically. When the two sons of Saghalie both fell in love with a beautiful maiden named Loowit, she could not choose between them. The two young chiefs fought over her, burying villages and forests in the process. The area was devastated and the earth shook so violently that the huge bridge fell into the river, creating the Cascades Rapids of the Columbia River Gorge.The Bridge of the Gods, theoutlaws.com (accessed 26 November 2006) For punishment, Saghalie struck down each of the lovers and transformed them into great mountains where they fell. Wy'east, with his head lifted in pride, became the volcano known today as Mount Hood, and Pahto, with his head bent toward his fallen love, was turned into Mount Adams. The fair Loowit became Mount St. Helens, known to the Klickitats as Louwala-Clough which means \\"smoking or fire mountain\\" in their language (the Sahaptin called the mountain Loowit).

He presented Family Fortunes from 1987 until 2002. Early life Dennis was born Leslie Dennis Heseltine on 12 October 1953 in the Garston suburb of Liverpool. His mother worked in a factory while his father, who worked in a betting shop after serving in the Royal Navy during the Second World War, was listed as a football player on the books of Liverpool FC but did not play for the first team. He lived in the suburb of Speke for a while and attended the Stockton Wood and Joseph Williams primary schools, before going on to attend Quarry Bank High School upon passing his 11-plus, by which time his family had moved to the suburb of Childwall. He had a weekend job in the men's clothing store Burton while in school, and started as a stand-up comedian in working men's clubs. Career =Early work and Family Fortunes= As a comedian, Dennis performed in social clubs all around the northwest of England. He was given his earliest opportunities in his home city of Liverpool, later crediting husband-and-wife theatrical agents Stuart and Dorene Gillespie (who had themselves been a successful variety act) with discovering him in his autobiography. His debut radio broadcast was in 1971 on Stuart's BBC Radio Merseyside series Variety Time (the programmes were taped in front of a live audience in Merseyside clubs). In 1974, he won the ITV talent show New Faces and appeared on numerous light entertainment shows. He almost became the first contestant ever to score the maximum 120 points on New Faces, but had to settle for 119 when Tony Hatch gave him 9 out of 10 in his final mark, drawing derision from the rest of a judges panel that included fellow Liverpool comedian Arthur Askey. In 1982, Dennis joined as one of the teams on Russ Abbot's Madhouse and The Russ Abbot Show before forming a comedy partnership with fellow impressionist Dustin Gee, which in turn led to a series of their own, The Laughter Show. Following Gee's sudden and unexpected death in January 1986, Dennis carried on The Laughter Show as a solo performer and became the third host of Family Fortunes for a 15-year run between 1987 and 2002. It was at a recording of an episode of Family Fortunes in 1997 that Dennis was surprised by This Is Your Life. When a contestant on Family Fortunes gave a particularly silly answer to a survey question, Dennis would sometimes say, \\"If it's [the answer] up there, I'll give you the money myself!\\" His Liverpudlian accent famously led him to pronounce \\"myself\\" as \\"meself\\", which soon made the sentence his catchphrase. This backfired on an episode where a contestant was asked to \\"name a way of toasting someone\\" and the contestant answered \\"over fire\\", which matched with \\"grill\\" for ¬£12; according to an anonymous source, Dennis made good on his promise and provided the prize money himself. =Theatre= Dennis' stage work includes Amos Hart in Chicago and Bill Snibson in Me and My Girl in the West End. He has starred in Skylight at the Water Mill Theatre in Newbury, Mr Wonderful at the Gateway Theatre in Chester, and Misery at the Coliseum Theatre in Oldham. He also appeared in Just Between Ourselves and co-starred alongside Janet Suzman in Cherished Disappointments in Love at London's Soho Theatre. He co-starred with Christopher Cazenove and John Duttine in a national tour of Art and as Norman Bartholomew in Anthony Shaffer's dark comedy Murderer at London's Menier Chocolate Factory. He later starred in a hit season of Neville's Island at the Birmingham Repertory Theatre. Dennis appeared as Mr. Fulton in High School Musical 2 on a UK tour from August 2009 to February 2010. He toured in Hairspray as Wilbur Turnblad alongside Michael Ball, Brian Conley and Michael Starke ‚Äì who alternated the role of Edna Turnblad. He starred in the touring production of Legally Blonde The Musical in 2012, playing the role of Professor Callahan. In 2017, Dennis played the role of Uncle Fester on the UK tour of the musical production of The Addams Family. The production starred Samantha Womack and Carrie Hope Fletcher and was produced by James Yeoburn and Stuart Matthew Price for United Theatrical, Katy Lipson for Aria Entertainment and Music & Lyrics in association with Festival Theatre, Edinburgh. In 2019, Dennis performed with the Royal Shakespeare Company in Restoration plays The Provoked Wife and Venice Preserved. =Early film and TV= Dennis' film debut was in the 1996 film Intimate Relations. He also appeared in the comedy film Large and Wildlife, a short film directed by Nick Allsop. He had previously made appearances on two episodes of Bang Bang, It's Reeves and Mortimer in The \\"Club\\" sketch, where he played himself. When he took part in a video-only special of Shooting Stars in 1993, Vic Reeves when introducing him pronounced his name as though it were French, saying \\"Les Dennis, the French fire engine\\". Dennis has appeared in Brookside (as Jeff Evans; 2001) and episodes of Merseybeat, Family Affairs, Casualty, the short-lived revival of Crossroads, and Hotel Babylon. =Big Brother= Dennis appeared in the second series of the UK Celebrity Big Brother during the period when his marriage to Amanda Holden was breaking down again ‚Äì he described his time in the BB House as \\"not one of his wisest moves\\", although he went on to finish as runner-up to Mark Owen. =2005‚Äì2007= On 11 August 2005 Dennis appeared as a guest star in an episode of the first series of BBC sitcom Extras, written by and starring Ricky Gervais and Stephen Merchant. In this appearance, Dennis portrayed a fictional version of himself, alongside Gerard Kelly, who played a camp theatre director, the recurring character Bunny. Dennis would go on to say that \\"you could say Extras changed my life.\\" In early 2006, Dennis presented and performed in BBC One's The Sound of Musicals and guested in New Street Law on BBC One. In summer 2006, he played scriptwriter Nick Chase in a new comedy play called Marlon Brando's Corset, which toured the UK from July 2006, including a month-long run at the Edinburgh Fringe. He appeared as a guest in August 2006 on the ITV drama series, The Bill starring as a man suspected of murdering his father. Dennis appeared alongside fellow former Russ Abbot performer Lisa Maxwell, who played D.I. Samantha Nixon in the series. At the 2006 Edinburgh International Television Festival, it was announced Dennis would make a return to the gameshow genre, presenting a new big-money quiz show titled In the Grid for Channel 5. The show debuted on 30 October 2006 and aired for one series. From April 2007, he also hosted UKTV Gold's TV Now and Then quiz show. The same month he guest-starred on BBC One's Holby City. He appeared on The Friday Night Project as a panellist on \\"Who knows the most about the guest host?\\" when Rupert Everett guest hosted. In theatre Dennis guest-starred as narrator in Side by Side by Sondheim at the Venue, London. As one of the team, he completed running the Safaricom Marathon in Lewa to raise funds for the BBC Wildlife Fund, screened on BBC One's Saving Planet Earth in July 2007. In August 2007, he starred in the hit play Certified Male‚Äîabout the highs and lows of modern manhood‚Äîat the Edinburgh Festival. He then toured in The Servant of Two Masters, directed by Michael Bogdanov and at Christmas he returned to pantomime after a ten-year break, co- starring in Cinderella with Hollywood veteran Mickey Rooney at the Empire Theatre, Sunderland, produced by First Family Entertainment. =2008‚Äì2012= Dennis's autobiography, Must The Show Go On?, was published by Orion in early 2008. In April 2008, Dennis toured in Eurobeat Almost Eurovision prior to a West End season in the show. Also in 2008, he narrated the home video clip show on Challenge, Les Dennis's Home Video Heroes, and appeared in the ITV documentary Les Dennis' Liverpool, which was, coincidentally, broadcast a week after BBC Two ran Alexei Sayle's Liverpool, a three-part documentary on the city. During Christmas 2008 panto season, Dennis appeared as Buttons in Cinderella at the Empire Theatre, Liverpool. The pantomime also featured Jennifer Ellison as Cinderella, and Cilla Black as the Fairy Godmother. At Christmas 2008, Les was featured on the Wombats' Christmas single and video Is This Christmas? in aid of MENCAP. Dennis was a celebrity player on Alan Carr's Celebrity Ding Dong in 2008; he began the episode by mentioning how the set was a ripoff of the Family Fortunes set, only to have Alan Carr interrupt him by making an \\"X\\" with his arms and imitating the infamous \\"UH-UHH!\\" sound. In 2009, Dennis played Herbert Soppitt in J. B. Priestley's When We Are Married at the West Yorkshire Playhouse, Leeds and the Playhouse, Liverpool. At Christmas 2009, he returned to the Liverpool Empire to appear in Peter Pan with Fonz actor Henry Winkler and again in 2010 to play the role of Aladdin's brother, Wishee Washee in Aladdin. As of 2010, Dennis presents the children's TV series Fee Fi Fo Yum for CBBC. From 17 October 2011, Dennis started a week- long stint in Countdowns Dictionary Corner, ending on 21 October. In 2011 he again worked with Ricky Gervais and Stephen Merchant, with recurring appearances as a fictionalised version of himself in the Warwick Davis comedy series, Life's Too Short. From August 2012, he performed in the play Jigsy at the Assembly Rooms (Edinburgh) as part of the Edinburgh Fringe Festival. =2013‚Äìpresent= In 2013 Dennis was reunited with Warwick Davis when the pair joined the cast of the West End production of Monty Python's Spamalot at London's Playhouse Theatre. His next theatrical appearance came in an adaptation of Peter James' novella The Perfect Murder\\". In 2013, Dennis was a contestant in Celebrity MasterChef. He finished as runner-up to Ade Edmondson. He has since returned to the show as a guest judge. In December of that year Dennis appeared in an episode of Midsomer Murders titled \\"The Christmas Haunting\\". =Coronation Street= On 23 January 2014, it was announced that Dennis would join the long-running ITV soap opera Coronation Street, playing the part of Michael Rogers (later changed to Michael Rodwell after press release), a petty burglar. He began filming on 27 January 2014, and made his first appearance on TV on 24 March 2014. The show's producer Stuart Blackburn said: \\"Les is a fantastic performer and a real coup for Corrie. I can't wait for him to join the team\\". On 18 November 2016, Dennis's character Michael Rodwell was killed off from Coronation Street, after suffering a heart attack and being left for dead by the show's villain, Michael's love rival Pat Phelan. =After Coronation Street= In April 2017, Dennis took the role of Uncle Fester in The Addams Family UK tour. Personal life Dennis has a son named Philip from his first marriage to Lynne Webster, which lasted from 1974 to 1990. He also had an affair with actress Sophie Aldred, which he documented in his autobiography. He married actress Amanda Holden on 4 June 1995. They had a temporary split in 2000 when Holden's affair with actor Neil Morrissey was exposed in the press, before eventually separating in December 2002 and divorcing in 2003. Dennis met Claire Nicholson in 2005. The couple have a daughter, Eleanor Grace, who was born on 24 April 2008. They were married on 23 November 2009 in Highgate. Their son, Thomas Christopher, was born on 14 April 2011. Dennis is a lifelong Liverpool FC fan.

An alternative is to bend the flaps back and tie them behind the head, which is called \\"ski-style\\" ‚Äî this offers less protection from the elements, but much better visibility, essential for high-speed skiing. The dense fur also offers some protection against blunt impacts to the head. The word derives from (), \\"ears\\" in Russian and many Slavic languages.  Basic materials  Ushankas are often made from inexpensive sheepskin (tsigeyka, :ru:–¶–∏–≥–µ–π–∫–∞), rabbit or muskrat fur. Artificial fur hats are also manufactured and are referred to as \\"fish fur\\" since the material is not from any real animal. The simplest \\"fish fur\\" of ushankas was made of wool pile with cloth substrate and cloth top, with the exception of the flaps, which had the pile exposed. Mink fur ushankas are widely used in the Arctic regions of Russia, protecting the ears and chin of the wearer even from \\"deep frost\\", which is around .

Such hats are also seen in Scandinavian countries Sweden and Norway, in the Eurasian and European Slavic countries Russia, Ukraine, Slovenia, and in Caucasus region in Georgia and Armenia. The design of ushanka with a perfectly round crown was developed in the 17th century when in central and northern Russia a hat with earflaps called treukh was worn. The modern ushanka design from 1917 is also inspired by the Norwegian norvezhka, a hat which was invented by Norwegian arctic explorers. The main difference from the treukh is that the earflaps of the norvezhka were much longer. In addition, Russian Cossacks of the Kuban have influenced the design of modern Ushanka through interaction with peoples from Central Asia and Caucasus. In 1917 During the Russian Civil War, the ruler of Siberia, Aleksandr Kolchak, introduced a winter uniform hat, commonly referred to as a kolchakovka, c. 1918. It was similar to the ushanka. In 1933, W. C. Fields wore a kolchakovka in the short film The Fatal Glass of Beer. However, Kolchak and the White Army lost the war, and their headgear was not adopted in the new Soviet Union. Red Army soldiers instead wore the budenovka, which was made of felt. It was designed to resemble historical bogatyr helmets, and did not provide much protection from the cold. During the Winter War against Finland, organizational failures and inadequate equipment left many Soviet troops vulnerable to cold, and many died of exposure. The Finnish army had much better equipment including an ushanka-style fur hat, the turkislakki M36, introduced in 1936. In 1939, shortly before the Winter War, the slightly improved turkislakki M39 was introduced, and is still in use today. After the winter war, the Red Army received completely redesigned winter uniforms. Budenovkas were finally replaced with ushankas based on the Finnish example. Officers were issued fur ushankas; other ranks received ushankas made with plush or \\"fish fur\\". When they experienced the harsh Russian winter, for example during the Battle of Moscow, German soldiers started to wear ushankas and other Soviet-type winter gear, as their uniforms did not provide adequate protection. WW2 ushanka presented in the Army museum (Russia) and Saumur tank museum (France). The ushanka became a symbol and media icon of the Soviet Union and later the Russian Federation. Photographs of U.S. President Gerald Ford wearing the cap during a 1974 visit to the Soviet Union were seen as a possible sign of d√©tente.

Gray (American civilian police), green (for camouflage), blue (police, United States Post Office) and black versions are in current usage. In 2013, the Russian army announced that the ushanka was being replaced by new headgear, which is essentially the same ushanka with a rounder crown and small sealable openings in the flaps for wearing headphones. The ushanka was used by the East German authorities before German reunification, and remained part of the German police uniform in winter afterwards. In the Finnish Defence Forces, a gray hat is used with M62 uniform and a green one of different design is a part of M91 and M05 winter dress. Armoured troops have a black hat (M92), while generals may wear a white M39 hat. The Royal Canadian Mounted Police use a \\"regulation hat\\" (between an ushanka and an aviator hat), made of muskrat fur. This replaced the former Astrakhan (hat). Similar ones are used by Toronto Transit Commission staff during winter. A similar type of headgear is worn in China's People's Liberation Army's winter uniform. Featured in an iconic image of Lei Feng, this type of hat is often called by Chinese \\"the Lei Feng hat\\" (Èõ∑ÈîãÂ∏Ω, Lei Feng mao).Èõ∑ÈîãÂ∏Ω (\\"Lei Feng hat\\") It is claimed that British wartime airmen visiting the Kola Inlet to help to protect the Arctic convoys quickly started to wear ushankas because their own uniform hats were not warm enough, but \\"kept the ear flaps tied up to the crown as any Russian would, because it was considered unmanly to wear them down.\\" However, in the Russian military up to this day, the way of wearing the ushanka ‚Äî up flaps, down flaps or ski-style ‚Äî is considered a part of uniform of the day and is usually decided by a unit commander at reveille, so the Russian soldiers aren't actually free about the way they wear their hats. A variant of the ushanka is popular in Norway, especially in the north. It is infamous for its name, \\"bj√∏rnefitte\\" (bear's vagina), which is considered vulgar in most parts of the country.  Similar hats  Trapper hats are \\"a sort of hybrid between the aviator cap and the ushanka‚Äîthey combine the style of the former with the furriness of the latter\\". They are considered more casual than the military- derived ushanka.

The \\"417\\" signifies that each pattern in the code consists of 4 bars and spaces in a pattern that is 17 units (modules) long. The PDF417 symbology was invented by Ynjiun P. Wang at Symbol Technologies in 1991. It is defined in ISO standard 15438. Applications PDF417 is used in many applications by both commercial and government organizations. PDF417 is one of the formats (along with Data Matrix) that can be used to print postage accepted by the United States Postal Service. PDF417 is also used by the airline industry's Bar Coded Boarding Pass (BCBP) standard as the 2D bar code symbolism for paper boarding passes. PDF417 is the standard selected by the Department of Homeland Security as the machine readable zone technology for RealID compliant driver licenses and state issued identification cards. PDF417 barcodes are also included on visas and border crossing cards issued by the State of Israel (example).  Features  In addition to features typical of two dimensional bar codes, PDF417's capabilities include: * Linking. PDF417 symbols can link to other symbols which are scanned in sequence allowing even more data to be stored. * User- specified dimensions. The user can decide how wide the narrowest vertical bar (X dimension) is, and how tall the rows are (Y dimension). * Public domain format. Anyone can implement systems using this format without any license.http://www.iso.org/iso/fr/home/store/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=43816 The introduction of the ISO/IEC document states: ::Manufacturers of bar code equipment and users of bar code technology require publicly available standard symbology specifications to which they can refer when developing equipment and application standards. It is the intent and understanding of ISO/IEC that the symbology presented in this International Standard is entirely in the public domain and free of all user restrictions, licences and fees. Format right The PDF417 bar code (also called a symbol) consists of 3 to 90 rows, each of which is like a small linear bar code. Each row has: * a quiet zone. This is a mandated minimum amount of white space before the bar code begins. * a start pattern which identifies the format as PDF417. * a \\"row left\\" codeword containing information about the row (such as the row number and error correction level) * 1‚Äì30 data codewords: Codewords are a group of bars and spaces representing one or more numbers, letters, or other symbols. * a \\"row right\\" codeword with more information about the row. * a stop pattern. * another quiet zone. All rows are the same width; each row has the same number of codewords. =Codewords= PDF417 uses a base 929 encoding. Each codeword represents a number from 0 to 928. The codewords are represented by patterns of dark (bar) and light (space) regions. Each of these patterns contains four bars and four spaces (where the 4 in the name comes from). The total width is 17 times the width of the narrowest allowed vertical bar (the X dimension); this is where the 17 in the name comes from. Each pattern starts with a bar and ends with a space. The row height must be at least 3 times the minimum width: Y ‚â• 3 X., 5.8.2. There are three distinct bar-space patterns used to represent each codeword. These patterns are organized into three groups known as clusters. The clusters are labeled 0, 3, and 6. No bar-space pattern is used in more than one cluster. The rows of the symbol cycle through the three clusters, so row 1 uses patterns from cluster 0, row 2 uses cluster 3, row 3 uses cluster 6, and row 4 again uses cluster 0. Which cluster can be determined by an equation:, 5.3.1. :K = b_1 - b_2 + b_3 - b_4 + 9 \\\\,\\\\, \\\\pmod 9 Where K is the cluster number and the bi refer to the width of the i-th black bar in the symbol character (in X units). Alternatively, :K = E_1 - E_2 + E_5 - E_6 + 9 \\\\,\\\\, \\\\pmod 9 Where Ei is the i-th edge-to-next-same-edge distance. Odd indices are the leading edge of a bar to the leading edge of the next bar; even indices are for the trailing edges. One purpose of the three clusters is to determine which row (mod 3) the codeword is in. The clusters allow portions of the symbol to be read using a single scan line that may be skewed from the horizontal., 5.11.1. For instance, the scan might start on row 6 at the start of the row but end on row 10. At the beginning of the scan, the scanner sees the constant start pattern, and then it sees symbols in cluster 6. When the skewed scan straddles rows 6 and 7, then the scanner sees noise. When the scan is on row 7, the scanner sees symbols in cluster 0. Consequently, the scanner knows the direction of the skew. By the time the scanner reaches the right, it is on row 10, so it sees cluster 0 patterns. The scanner will also see a constant stop pattern. =Encoding= Of the 929 available code words, 900 are used for data, and 29 for special functions, such as shifting between major modes. The three major modes encode different types of data in different ways, and can be mixed as necessary within a single bar code: *Byte: each group of 5 code words represents 6 bytes. (Because 9005 > 2566.) Additional bytes are encoded one per code word. *Numeric: n digits are encoded in +1 code words, up to a maximum of 44 digits in 15 code words. *Text: Each code word represents two base-30 digits, which are used by a system of four submodes to represent the printable ASCII characters (plus CR, LF and HT): ** Uppercase: A-Z, SP, Change to lowercase, Change to mixed, Interpret next digit as punctuation ** Lowercase: a-z, SP, Interpret next digit as uppercase, Change to mixed, Interpret next digit as punctuation ** Mixed: 0-9, &, CR, HT, comma, :, #, -, period, $, /, +, %, *, =, ^, Change to punctuation, SP, Change to lowercase, Change to uppercase, Interpret next digit as punctuation ** Punctuation: ;, <, >, @, [, \\\\, ], _, \`, ~, !, CR, HT, comma, :, LF, -, period, $, /, \\", , *, (, ), ?, {, }, ', Change to uppercase =Error correction= When the PDF417 symbol is created, from 2 to 512 error detection and correction codewords are added. PDF417 uses Reed-Solomon error correction. When the symbol is scanned, the maximum number of corrections that can be made is equal to the number of codewords added, but the standard recommends that two codewords be held back to ensure reliability of the corrected information. Comparison with other symbologies PDF417 is a stacked barcode that can be read with a simple linear scan being swept over the symbol.For example, the Symbol Technologies LS-4000 series. Those linear scans need the left and right columns with the start and stop code words. Additionally, the scan needs to know what row it is scanning, so each row of the symbol must also encode its row number. Furthermore, the reader's line scan won't scan just a row; it will typically start scanning one row, but then cross over to a neighbor and possibly continuing on to cross successive rows. In order to minimize the effect of these crossings, the PDF417 modules are tall and narrow -- the height is typically three times the width. Also, each code word must indicate which row it belongs to so crossovers, when they occur, can be detected. The code words are also designed to be delta-decodable, so some code words are redundant. Each PDF data code word represents about 10 bits of information (log2(900) ‚âà 9.8), but the printed code word (character) is 17 modules wide. Including a height of 3 modules, a PDF417 code word takes 51 square modules to represent 10 bits. That area does not count other overhead such as the start, stop, row, format, and ECC information. Other 2D codes, such as DataMatrix and QR, are decoded with image sensors instead of uncoordinated linear scans. Those codes still need recognition and alignment patterns, but they do not need to be as prominent. An 8 bit code word will take 8 square modules (ignoring recognition, alignment, format, and ECC information). In practice, a PDF417 symbol takes about four times the area of a DataMatrix or QR Code.

In an interview for the BBC Radio 4 programme The Party's Over, Taaffe gave a few biographical details: \\"I came into contact with Socialist Fight in 1960\\" writes Taaffe.The Rise of Militant, p. 10 Socialist Fight was the newspaper of a small group of mainly (but not entirely) industrial militants in Liverpool going by the name of the Revolutionary Socialist League (RSL), and led by Jimmy Deane and Ted Grant. Taaffe \\"does not subscribe to the view that the struggles of small groupings are of no historical significance\\".Taaffe The Rise of Militant, p. 9 This small group supported the ideas of Leon Trotsky, who proposed that genuine Marxism, followed by Lenin, had always argued that only the working class in the advanced capitalist countries could lead a revolution to establish socialism. These were the ideas to which Taaffe subscribed. Taaffe argues that, \\"There is a long tradition going right back to the 1930s and Trotsky himself, of Trotskyist groups and organisations which endeavoured to find a base within the labour movement and working class.\\"  Peter Taaffe and the Militant newspaper  In 1964, Taaffe writes that the \\"youth supporters of Militant\\" drew on their experiences gained during the 1960 Clydeside apprentices' strike in \\"seeking to organise and mobilise the Liverpool apprentices. Ted Mooney and I played leading roles, together with Harry Dowling and Dave Galashan, in organising an apprentices' strike in one factory, English Electric, on the East Lancashire Road.\\" About 20,000 of the 70,000 engineering apprentices downed tools in total.'The Rise of Militant' p. 20-21 By this time, the second issue of the Militant had come out. Earlier in 1964, Ted Grant, Liverpudlians Jimmy Deane (who was National Secretary) and Keith Dickenson, Ellis Hillman, John Smith, and others on the executive of the RSL decided to launch the Militant newspaper \\"without complete unanimity\\" Taaffe writes.Rise of Militant p. 17. Jimmy Deane was National Secretary until 1965. Before his death he made his minutes of these meetings available. cf http://www.warwick.ac.uk/services/library/mrc/ead/325col.htm Peter Taaffe, who lived in Liverpool at that time, was appointed editor.Jimmy Deane's minutes of these decisions. In op cit http://www.warwick.ac.uk/services/library/mrc/ead/325col.htm He recalled this time in the Radio 4 programme, The Party's Over: In 1965, Taaffe was able to move to London. He became full-time national secretary as well as editor of Militant, despite a serious shortage of money: \\"I was compelled first of all to sleep on the floor of a supporter in Balham... once or twice spending sleepless nights in the entrances of subways\\".The Rise of Militant, p. 11 Eventually, the group became known by the name of the paper, and was either referred to as Militant or the Militant tendency. Many of Peter Taaffe's major signed articles in Militant during the first few years were on international topics: the Congo, Dominica, Latin America, Vietnam, Rhodesia, and China. In Issue 16, in May 1966, perhaps to coincide with the international working class celebrations on May Day, Taaffe's article led the front page with the banner headline 'Internationalism the Only Road'. In September 1965, Militant, in issue no.9, ran a front-page article by Taaffe under the banner headline: \\"Nationalise the 400 Monopolies\\". This was the first instance of Militant's demand for the nationalisation of usually a specific number of multinational companies, which were said to control 80% or more of the economy, under workers' control and management, and the establishment of a socialist plan of production. Demands of this nature in Militant follow the Transitional Program written by Leon Trotsky, pushing beyond what the \\"bourgeois state\\" was willing to concede.  Expulsion from the Labour Party  By the 1980s, the Militant tendency had become the most prominent Trotskyist organisation in Britain. Two books by Peter Taaffe: The Rise of Militant and Liverpool ‚Äì A City That Dared to Fight (with Tony Mulhearn) describe this period. The Labour Party under Michael Foot (and later Neil Kinnock) moved to purge Militant from the party. In 1983, Peter Taaffe, along with the other four members of the Militant newspaper's editorial board (Ted Grant, Keith Dickinson, Lynn Walsh, and Clare Doyle), were expelled from the Labour Party. A year later, speaking at the Wembley Conference Centre to several thousand supporters celebrating 20 years of the Militant newspaper, Taaffe highlighted the media attention now fixed on Militant. Speaking about a \\"marvellous article\\" in the Daily Mirror, by now under the ownership of Robert Maxwell, he said: His speech contrasted on the one hand the determination showed by strikers during the miners strike in 1984‚Äì1985, and the Liverpool victory of the previous year under the leadership of the Militant tendency, and on the other the \\"five years of defeats\\" inflicted on workers as a result of poor Labour and trade union leadership.Militant Rally of 1984 (Part one, morning rally,) at Socialist Party historic videos, also on DVD, published by the Socialist Party 2007.) Peter Taaffe is referring to the period beginning with the victory of Thatcher in 1979. Taaffe characterised Neil Kinnock, Labour leader from 1983, in this way: \\"The bourgeois recognized early that Kinnock's role in attacking Liverpool and the miners was an attempt to sanitise the Labour Party, ridding it of all that 'socialist nonsense'.\\" Taaffe went on to predict \\"an enormous recoil towards the left\\" within the Labour Party. But this prognosis was overtaken by the profound changes which took place in the Labour Party. In 1988, Taaffe began assessing with the Scottish Militant members the prospects of activism against the government's Poll tax (officially the Community Charge) legislation. But for Taaffe and the leadership of the Militant, the prospects for Militant in the Labour Party were poor.  The Liverpool struggle 1983‚Äì1987  In the four-year Liverpool struggle, Taaffe was closely involved with developments, discussing with close friends and leading Liverpool Militant supporters, such as the former print worker Tony Mulhearn.Derek Hatton, Deputy leader of Liverpool City Council says \\"the man who has had the greatest political influence on my political thinking, and on the way in which we shaped our policy in Liverpool, was Peter Taaffe\\". Inside left, p. 32 He was President of the Liverpool District Labour Party during these events, in which the Liverpool City Council declared it was \\"Better to break the law than break the poor\\", agreed an illegal budget, and built 4,800 houses and bungalows, and improved 7,400 houses and flats (amongst other works), before the 47 councillors were surcharged and removed from office . Their opponents however argued that Liverpool was in chaos. Taaffe wanted to take the Liverpool battle towards a split with the Labour Party at that stage. In the interview for the BBC Radio 4 programme The Party's Over, Taaffe makes the following remarks: The Liverpool District Labour Party, which Taaffe says in the same interview had a very large attendance of 700, was suspended by the Labour Party in 1986. Thus Taaffe here indicates that he argued for defying the ban, which would have been in all essentials a split from the Labour Party.  The Poll Tax 1989‚Äì1991  In Glasgow, in April 1988, a \\"one-day conference with delegates from every area of Scotland where Militant had supporters and influence\\",The Rise of Militant p. 312 was held with Taaffe present. This conference decided to adopt the tactic of mass non-payment of the Poll Tax, and the \\"building of a Scottish-wide network of local anti-poll tax unions and regional federations\\" ‚Äì a strategy which was clearly in tune with large swathes of the population. In fact Prime Minister John Major subsequently reported that 17.5 million people had either not paid or were in serious arrearsDanny Burns Poll Tax Rebellion, p. 176 just before abolishing it. Anti-Poll Tax Unions were set up around the country, and brought together on an all-Scotland and then an all-Britain basis. These bodies, which brought Tommy Sheridan to prominence and are described in n Taaffe's 'The Rise of Militant', had to be built outside, and essentially in opposition to the Labour Party, which was implementing the Poll Tax at local level. \\"The august Times (11 July 1984) thundered: 'Danegeld in Liverpool'.\\", writes Peter Taaffe in Liverpool ‚Äì A City That Dared to Fight, chapter 8, p. 151 . The Poll Tax non-payment campaign has been widely credited for causing British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's downfall. The BBC, for instance, reports: \\"The unpopularity of the new charge led to the poll tax riots in London in March 1990 and ‚Äì indirectly ‚Äì to the downfall of the then Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher in the November of the same year\\". The headline of this 'On this day' retrospective is \\"1990: One in five yet to pay poll tax\\" (See also Poll Tax Riots.) Peter Taaffe argues that:  The Open Turn  From 1987, differences between Taaffe and others on the executive committee of Militant and the CWI, and Grant and his supporters became apparent. The decisive issue between the two sides arose in 1991. It centred on whether the group should take an \\"open turn\\", initially called the \\"Scottish turn\\", which meant founding an independent political party outside of the Labour Party, or whether it should continue with entryism. Taaffe and the majority in Militant supported the Scottish turn and the creation of Scottish Militant Labour whilst Grant and a minority opposed it. These became known as the 'Majority' and the 'Minority' positions, and both produced documents which were circulated.Marxism and the British Labour Party ‚Äì the 'Open Turn' debate. The \\"Open Turn\\" debate took place essentially between April and October 1991. In April 1991, the Militant executive body decided to support the \\"Scottish Turn\\" as it was initially termed.Taaffe The Rise of Militant, p. 433-434 In January 1992, the majority leadership claimed that the minority was intending to split from Militant. Peter Taaffe published an extended editorial in Militant (24 January 1992) entitled \\"A parting of the ways\\" which announced that following the \\"Scottish turn\\" decision at the special conference in October 1991, Tommy Sheridan would be the group's Glasgow Pollock candidate in the approaching general election. Taaffe stated that those ten months had been one of \\"profound debate\\" culminating in the special October 1991 in which the majority had overwhelming support. Many opponents of the \\"Scottish turn\\" will remain loyal supporters of Militant, Taaffe predicted. Immediately after the special conference, Taaffe stated that Ted Grant and his group took steps to set up \\"their own small premises and their own staff and are raising their own funds. We regret Ted Grant has split in this way. He made a vital contribution...\\" Grant, Alan Woods, Rob Sewell, and other leading supporters of the 'Minority' were expelled, and reconstituted themselves as the Socialist Appeal tendency, after its paper, and Scottish Militant Labour eventually became the Scottish Socialist Party (SSP).A debate took place between 1998 and 2001 in which the leadership of the Scottish section of the Committee for a Workers' International proposed a change in the political character of the Scottish section. The leadership of the SSP eventually broke away from the CWI. Cf Party, Programme, Reformism and the International ‚Äì the 'Scottish debate' The SSP had gained several MSPs in the Scottish Parliament, but the SSP split in 2006, with Tommy Sheridan forming Solidarity ‚Äì Scotland's socialist movement  \\"A parting of the ways\\"  In the Militant editorial\\"A parting of the ways\\", Militant, January 1992 and in the document \\"Two Trends: Political Roots of The Breakaway\\"\\"Two Trends: Political Roots of The Breakaway\\", Militant document, January 1992 in January 1992, and in his book about Militant, Taaffe identified other issues which had become problematic. Political disagreements within the group existed over Black Monday, Russia, Afghanistan and South Africa).Peter Taaffe The Rise of Militant, p. 328, p. 445 Taaffe accused Grant of \\"never [being] prepared to enter into a dialogue. Ted effectively claimed a right of political veto\\" over the executive committee of the Militant. For Taaffe, there was a difference of views over the achievements of the last ten years. \\"They [Grant and his supporters] claim that over the last ten years Militant has relegated theory and moved towards activism. Incredibly, they dismiss as \\"activism\\" the outstanding interventions of Militant supporters in the miner's strike and the Liverpool council battle...Above all they relegate our successful leadership of the anti-poll tax movement which defeated Thatcher.\\" On the contrary, counters Taaffe, it is Grant and his followers who have fallen into \\"dogmatism\\" and betray an atrophy of thought: \\"The former minority are political dinosaurs. They operate with outmoded formulas which no longer apply... an absolutely dogmatic, black and white, undialectical approach towards political phenomena, both in Britain and on an international scale.\\". He claimed that Grant \\"publicly asserted his views against the majority of the editorial board on crucial issues, [which] threatened to have a disorientating effect on some of our supporters\\". One disagreement over current events was over 'Black Monday' ‚Äì a sharp fall in the international stock markets in 1987. Grant believed a worldwide slump would arise from the fall of the stock markets. \\"From a capitalist point of view at best this will be the worst post-war slump, but it is possible that it will be worse than the slump of 1929‚Äì1933\\".Militant, 30 October 1987 Whilst Grant had the support of Alan Woods and Michael Roberts on this issue, he was opposed by Taaffe, Lynn Walsh, Bob Labi and what was to become the \\"majority\\". Here was first clearly delineated the dividing line that was drawn between the supporters of Grant and Taaffe. Taaffe writes that the discussion on the executive was \\"very sharp\\".The Rise of Militant, p. 447 Taaffe argued that, \\"To other members of the Editorial Board it was clear that the major capitalist states, especially Germany and Japan, were stepping in to finance a stabilisation of the world financial system. This, we argued, would allow the boom to continue for a time, postponing a recession and other problems into the future. This was what happened.\\" Despite the disagreements, Grant proceeded to publish his views in the Militant. Looking back in 1992 Taaffe argues that Grant should have been challenged in writing. Such a challenge would have meant the formation of factions in 1987. A final issue was the approaching collapse of the Soviet Union, or for them, the crisis of Stalinism. Taaffe and the majority believed that the restoration of capitalism was possible in the Soviet Union. Grant disagreed. In fact in the same article on \\"Black Monday\\" Grant added his view that, \\"Any illusions in Gorbachev changing anything fundamental, will be shattered by the attitude of the Moscow bureaucracy to this crisis.\\" The collapse of Stalinism was, Taaffe counters, \\"the end of an epoch\\", which led to capitalist triumphalism.For instance, Francis Fukuyama, The End of History and the Last Man  The Socialist Party  The majority in the Militant tendency, led by Peter Taaffe, argued that the Labour Party had become a thoroughly bourgeois party which no longer represented the working class. Militant went on to become Militant Labour and then the Socialist Party in 1997, with Taaffe as general secretary. It campaigns in the trade unions to break the link with Labour and found a new party based on the working class, in contrast to the supporters of Socialist Appeal, who support a policy of work within the Labour Party and the trade unions in opposition to New Labour under Tony Blair. Internationally, Taaffe won majority support in the Committee for a Workers' International (CWI). The opposition to the Open Turn internationally was expelled from the CWI and founded the Committee for a Marxist International and its in Defence of Marxism website. The CWI later founded a website Marxist resource from the Committee for a Workers' International in part to publish the documents written by Peter Taaffe and others in the CWI about these and other developments and debates, as a contribution to an analysis of what they perceive to be the complexities of the current period, and how to build the path to the working class for the ideas of Marxism. Taaffe continued to play an important role in the Committee for a Workers' International, writing books and pamphlets such as the History of the CWI, Afghanistan, Islam and the Revolutionary Left (2002) and on the anniversary of the British general strike, 1926 General Strike ‚Äì workers taste power (2006). Taaffe's Marxism in Today's World (2006) arose from a visit to the CWI's offices in London by an Italian Marxist publishing collective, Guiovane Talpa, who conducted a probing interview with Peter Taaffe and Bob Labi on CWI policy over several days, publishing the transcript in Italian. At the completion of the project the CWI published an additional English version. This book discusses the views of the CWI on war, capitalism the environment and other issues, and is now being published in India. In November 2016, Taaffe publicly applied to rejoin the Labour Party as part of a group of 75 activists. With the aim of supporting party leader Jeremy Corbyn against his internal opponents, his objective was for Labour Party affiliation of the Socialist Party and the standing of joint candidates. Following the 2020 national congress of the Socialist Party, the newly elected Socialist Party Executive Committee unanimously agreed that deputy general secretary Hannah Sell take over as general secretary from Peter Taaffe. He was elected political secretary and remains on the Executive Committee.  Publications  Taaffe has written a number of books and pamphlets, including: *Socialism and Left Unity, (2008) *Marxism in Today's World, (2006) *1926 General Strike ‚Äì workers taste power, (April 2006) *Upheavals in China (pamphlet), (April 2005). *A socialist world is possible, (February 2005) *Empire Defeated: Vietnam War ‚Äì The Lessons For Today, (2003) *Post-September 11: Can US Imperialism be challenged?

The model draws evidence from the observation that a large number of antipsychotics have dopamine-receptor antagonistic effects. The theory, however, does not posit dopamine overabundance as a complete explanation for schizophrenia. Rather, the overactivation of D2 receptors, specifically, is one effect of the global chemical synaptic dysregulation observed in this disorder.  Introduction  Some researchers have suggested that dopamine systems in the mesolimbic pathway may contribute to the 'positive symptoms' of schizophrenia 2002 ‚Ä¢ A. Heinz ‚Ä¢ Dopaminergic dysfunction in alcoholism and schizophrenia ‚Äì psychopathological and behavioral correlates. (whereas problems with dopamine function in the mesocortical pathway may be responsible for the 'negative symptoms', such as avolition and alogia). Abnormal expression, thus distribution of the D2 receptor between these areas and the rest of the brain may also be implicated in schizophrenia, specifically in the acute phase. A relative excess of these receptors within the limbic system means Broca's area, which can produce illogical language, has an abnormal connection to Wernicke's area, which comprehends language but does not create it. Note that variation in distribution is observed within individuals, so abnormalities of this characteristic likely play a significant role in all psychological illnesses. Individual alterations are produced by differences within glutamatergic pathways within the limbic system, which are also implicated in other psychotic syndromes. Among the alterations of both synaptic and global structure, the most significant abnormalities are observed in the uncinate fasciculus and the cingulate cortex. The combination of these creates a profound dissymmetry of prefrontal inhibitory signaling, shifted positively towards the dominant side. Eventually, the cingulate gyrus becomes atrophied towards the anterior, due to long-term depression (LTD) and long-term potentiation (LTP) from the abnormally strong signals transversely across the brain. This, combined with a relative deficit in GABAergic input to Wernicke's area, shifts the balance of bilateral communication across the corpus callosum posteriorly. Through this mechanism, hemispherical communication becomes highly shifted towards the left/dominant posterior. As such, spontaneous language from Broca's can propagate through the limbic system to the tertiary auditory cortex. This retrograde signaling to the temporal lobes that results in the parietal lobes not recognizing it as internal results in the auditory hallucinations typical of chronic schizophrenia. In addition, significant cortical grey matter volume reductions are observed in this disorder. Specifically, the right hemisphere atrophies more, while both sides show a marked decrease in frontal and posterior volume. This indicates that abnormal synaptic plasticity occurs, where certain feedback loops become so potentiated, others receive little glutaminergic transmission. This is a direct result of the abnormal dopaminergic input to the striatum, thus (indirectly) disinhibition of thalamic activity. The excitatory nature of dopaminergic transmission means the glutamate hypothesis of schizophrenia is inextricably intertwined with this altered functioning. 5-HT also regulates monoamine neurotransmitters, including dopaminergic transmission. Specifically, the 5-HT2A receptor regulates cortical input to the basal ganglia and many typical and atypical antipsychotics are antagonists at this receptor. Several antipsychotics are also antagonists at the 5-HT2C receptor, leading to dopamine release in the structures where 5-HT2C is expressed; striatum, prefrontal cortex, nucleus accumbens, amygdala, hippocampus (all structures indicated in this disease), and currently thought to be a reason why antipsychotics with 5HT2C antagonistic properties improves negative symptoms. More research is needed to explain the exact nature of the altered chemical transmission in this disorder. Recent evidence on a variety of animal models of psychosis, such as sensitization of animal behaviour by amphetamine, or phencyclidine (PCP, Angel Dust), or excess steroids, or by removing various genes (COMT, DBH, GPRK6, RGS9, RIIbeta), or making brain lesions in newborn animals, or delivering animals abnormally by Caesarian section, all induce a marked behavioural supersensitivity to dopamine and a marked rise in the number of dopamine D2 receptors in the high-affinity state for dopamine. This latter work implies that there are multiple genes and neuronal pathways that can lead to psychosis and that all these multiple psychosis pathways converge via the high-affinity state of the D2 receptor, the common target for all antipsychotics, typical or atypical. Combined with less inhibitory signalling from the thalamus and other basal ganglic structures, from hyoptrophy the abnormal activation of the cingulate cortex, specifically around Broca's and Wernicke's areas, abnormal D2 agonism can facilitate the self-reinforcing, illogical patterns of language found in such patients. In schizophrenia, this feedback loop has progressed, which produced the widespread neural atrophy characteristic of this disease. Patients on neuroleptic or antipsychotic medication have significantly less atrophy within these crucial areas. As such, early medical intervention is crucial in preventing the advancement of these profound deficits in bilateral communication at the root of all psychotic disorders. Advanced, chronic schizophrenia can not respond even to clozapine, regarded as the most potent antipsychotic, as such, a cure for highly advanced schizophrenia is likely impossible through the use of any modern antipsychotics, so the value of early intervention cannot be stressed enough.  Discussion  = Evidence for the dopamine hypothesis = Stimulants such as amphetamine, and cocaine increase the levels of dopamine in the brain and can cause symptoms of psychosis, particularly after large doses or prolonged use. This is often referred to as \\"amphetamine psychosis\\" or \\"cocaine psychosis,\\" but may produce experiences virtually indistinguishable from the positive symptoms associated with schizophrenia. Similarly, those treated with dopamine enhancing levodopa for Parkinson's disease can experience psychotic side effects mimicking the symptoms of schizophrenia. Up to 75% of patients with schizophrenia have increased signs and symptoms of their psychosis upon challenge with moderate doses of methylphenidate or amphetamine or other dopamine-like compounds, all given at doses at which control normal volunteers do not have any psychologically disturbing effects. Some functional neuroimaging studies have also shown that, after taking amphetamine, patients diagnosed with schizophrenia show greater levels of dopamine release (particularly in the striatum) than non-psychotic individuals. However, the acute effects of dopamine stimulants include euphoria, alertness and over-confidence; these symptoms are more reminiscent of mania than schizophrenia. Since the 2000s, several PET studies have confirmed an altered synthesis capacity of dopamine in the nigrostriatal system demonstrating a dopaminergic dysregulation. A group of drugs called the phenothiazines, including antipsychotics such as chlorpromazine, has been found to antagonize dopamine binding (particularly at receptors known as D2 dopamine receptors) and reduce positive psychotic symptoms. This observation was subsequently extended to other antipsychotic drug classes, such as butyrophenones including haloperidol. The link was strengthened by experiments in the 1970s which suggested that the binding affinity of antipsychotic drugs for D2 dopamine receptors seemed to be inversely proportional to their therapeutic dose. This correlation, suggesting that receptor binding is causally related to therapeutic potency, was reported by two laboratories in 1976. Genetic evidence has suggested that there may be genes, or specific variants of genes, that code for mechanisms involved in dopamine function, which may be more prevalent in people experiencing psychosis or diagnosed with schizophrenia. Dopamine-related genes linked to psychosis in this way include COMT, DRD4, and AKT1. People with Schizophrenia appear to have a high rate of self-medication with nicotine; the therapeutic effect likely occurs through dopamine modulation by nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. However, there was controversy and conflicting findings over whether postmortem findings resulted from drug tolerance to chronic antipsychotic treatment. Compared to the success of postmortem studies in finding profound changes of dopamine receptors, imaging studies using SPET and PET methods in drug naive patients have generally failed to find any difference in dopamine D2 receptor density compared to controls. Comparable findings in longitudinal studies show: \\" Particular emphasis is given to methodological limitations in the existing literature, including lack of reliability data, clinical heterogeneity among studies, and inadequate study designs and statistic,\\" suggestions are made for improving future longitudinal neuroimaging studies of treatment effects in schizophrenia A recent review of imaging studies in schizophrenia shows confidence in the techniques, while discussing such operator error. In 2007 one report said, \\"During the last decade, results of brain imaging studies by use of PET and SPET in schizophrenic patients showed a clear dysregulation of the dopaminergic system.\\" Recent findings from meta-analyses suggest that there may be a small elevation in dopamine D2 receptors in drug-free patients with schizophrenia, but the degree of overlap between patients and controls makes it unlikely that this is clinically meaningful. While the review by Laruelle acknowledged more sites were found using methylspiperone, it discussed the theoretical reasons behind such an increase (including the monomer-dimer equilibrium) and called for more work to be done to 'characterise' the differences. In addition, newer antipsychotic medication (called atypical antipsychotic medication) can be as potent as older medication (called typical antipsychotic medication) while also affecting serotonin function and having somewhat less of a dopamine blocking effect. In addition, dopamine pathway dysfunction has not been reliably shown to correlate with symptom onset or severity. HVA levels correlate trendwise to symptoms severity. During the application of debrisoquin, this correlation becomes significant. Giving a more precise explanation of this discrepancy in D2 receptor has been attempted by a significant minority. Radioligand imaging measurements involve the monomer and dimer ratio, and the 'cooperativity' model. Cooperativitiy is a chemical function in the study of enzymes.Safra, JE (Chairman) 2005 'Cooperativity' The New Encyclopaedia Britannica, Vol 3, Micropaedia, p 666 Dopamine receptors interact with their own kind, or other receptors to form higher order receptors such as dimers, via the mechanism of cooperativity.Fuxe K, Marcellino D, Guidolin D, Woods A, Agnati L, Chapter 10 ‚Äì Dopamine Receptor Oligermization, in Neve KA (ed)'Dopamine Receptors' Springer (2009) Philip Seeman has said: \\"In schizophrenia, therefore, the density of [11C] methylspiperone sites rises, reflecting an increase in monomers, while the density of [11C] raclopride sites remains the same, indicating that the total population of D2 monomers and dimers does not change.\\" (In another place Seeman has said methylspiperone possibly binds with dimers) With this difference in measurement technique in mind, the above- mentioned meta-analysis uses results from 10 different ligands. Exaggerated ligand binding results such as SDZ GLC 756 (as used in the figure) were explained by reference to this monomer-dimer equilibrium. According to Seeman, \\"...Numerous postmortem studies have consistently revealed D2 receptors to be elevated in the striata of patients with schizophrenia\\". However, the authors were concerned the effect of medication may not have been fully accounted for. The study introduced an experiment by Abi-Dargham et al. in which it was shown medication-free live schizophrenics had more D2 receptors involved in the schizophrenic process and more dopamine. Since then another study has shown such elevated percentages in D2 receptors is brain-wide (using a different ligand, which did not need dopamine depletion). In a 2009 study, Annisa Abi- Dagham et al. confirmed the findings of her previous study regarding increased baseline D2 receptors in schizophrenics and showing a correlation between this magnitude and the result of amphetamine stimulation experiments. Some animal models of psychosis are similar to those for addiction ‚Äì displaying increased locomotor activity.\\"Amphetamine psychosis has been proposed as a model for some features of schizophrenia... This model of amphetamine sensitization has also been adopted as a paradigm for researchers interested in the addictive powers of drugs of abuse.\\" For those female animals with previous sexual experience, amphetamine stimulation happens faster than for virgins. There is no study on male equivalent because the studies are meant to explain why females experience addiction earlier than males. Even in 1986 the effect of antipsychotics on receptor measurement was controversial. An article in Science sought to clarify whether the increase was solely due to medication by using drug-naive schizophrenics: \\"The finding that D2 dopamine receptors are substantially increased in schizophrenic patients who have never been treated with neuroleptic drugs raises the possibility that dopamine receptors are involved in the schizophrenic disease process itself. Alternatively, the increased D2 receptor number may reflect presynaptic factors such as increased endogenous dopamine levels (16). In either case, our findings support the hypothesis that dopamine receptor abnormalities are present in untreated schizophrenic patients.\\" (The experiment used 3-N-[11C]methylspiperone ‚Äì the same as mentioned by Seeman detects D2 monomers and binding was double that of controls.) It is still thought that dopamine mesolimbic pathways may be hyperactive, resulting in hyperstimulation of D2 receptors and positive symptoms. There is also growing evidence that, conversely, mesocortical pathway dopamine projections to the prefrontal cortex might be hypoactive (underactive), resulting in hypostimulation of D1 receptors, which may be related to negative symptoms and cognitive impairment. The overactivity and underactivity in these different regions may be linked, and may not be due to a primary dysfunction of dopamine systems but to more general neurodevelopmental issues that precede them. Increased dopamine sensitivity may be a common final pathway. Another finding is a six-fold excess of binding sites insensitive to the testing agent, raclopride;For a discussion of opposing studies see p 143: Seeman said this increase was probably due to the increase in D2 monomers. Such an increase in monomers may occur via the cooperativity mechanism which is responsible for D2High and D2Low, the supersensitive and lowsensitivity states of the D2 dopamine receptor. More specifically, \\"an increase in monomers, may be one basis for dopamine supersensitivity\\". = Evidence against the dopamine hypothesis = Further experiments, conducted as new methods were developed (particularly the ability to use PET scanning to examine drug action in the brain of living patients) challenged the view that the amount of dopamine blocking was correlated with clinical benefit. These studies showed that some patients had over 90% of their D2 receptors blocked by antipsychotic drugs, but showed little reduction in their psychoses. This primarily occurs in patients who have had the psychosis for ten to thirty years. At least 90-95% of first-episode patients, however, respond to antipsychotics at low doses and do so with D2 occupancy of 60-70%. The antipsychotic aripiprazole occupies over 90% of D2 receptors, but this drug is both an agonist and an antagonist at D2 receptors. Furthermore, although dopamine-inhibiting medications modify dopamine levels within minutes, the associated improvement in patient symptoms is usually not visible for at least several days, suggesting that dopamine may be indirectly responsible for the illness.R. Thompson, The Brain, Similarly, the second generation of antipsychotic drugs ‚Äì the atypical antipsychotics ‚Äì were found to be just as effective as older typical antipsychotics in controlling psychosis, but more effective in controlling the negative symptoms, despite the fact that they have lower affinity for dopamine receptors than for various other neurotransmitter receptors.Diaz, Jaime. How Drugs Influence Behavior. Englewood Cliffs: Prentice Hall, 1996. More recent work, however, has shown that atypical antipsychotic drugs such as clozapine and quetiapine bind and unbind rapidly and repeatedly to the dopamine D2 receptor. All of these drugs exhibit inverse agonistic effects at the 5-HT2A/2C receptors, meaning serotonin abnormalities are also involved in the complex constellation of neurologic factors predisposing one to the self reinforcing language-based psychological deficits found in all forms of psychosis. The excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate is now also thought to be associated with schizophrenia. Phencyclidine (also known as PCP or \\"Angel Dust\\") and ketamine, both of which block glutamate (NMDA) receptors, are known to cause psychosis at least somewhat resembling schizophrenia, further suggesting that psychosis and perhaps schizophrenia cannot fully be explained in terms of dopamine function, but may also involve other neurotransmitters.\\"Daring to Think Differently about Schizophrenia\\". New York Times, February 24, 2008. Similarly, there is now evidence to suggest there may be a number of functional and structural anomalies in the brains of some people diagnosed with schizophrenia, such as changes in grey matter density in the frontal and temporal lobes. It appears, therefore, that there are multiple causes for psychosis and schizophrenia, including gene mutations and anatomical lesions. Psychiatrist David Healy has argued that drug companies have inappropriately promoted the dopamine hypothesis of schizophrenia as a deliberate and calculated simplification for the benefit of drug marketing. = Relationship with glutamate = Research has shown the importance of glutamate receptors, specifically N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs), in addition to dopamine in the etiology of schizophrenia. Mice with only 5% of the normal levels of NMDAR's expressed schizophrenic like behaviors seen in animal models of schizophrenia while mice with 100% of NMDAR's behaved normally. Schizophrenic behavior in low NMDAR mice has been effectively treated with antipsychotics that lower dopamine. NMDAR's and dopamine receptors in the prefrontal cortex are associated with the cognitive impairments and working memory deficits commonly seen in schizophrenia. Rats that have been given a NMDAR antagonist exhibit a significant decrease in performance on cognitive tasks. Rats given a dopamine antagonist (antipsychotic) experience a reversal of the negative effects of the NMDAR antagonist. Glutamate imbalances appear to cause abnormal functioning in dopamine. When levels of glutamate are low dopamine is overactive and results in the expression schizophrenic symptoms. = Criticisms = Dr Ronald Pies, the current editor in Chief Emeritus of Psychiatric Times with a circulation of about 50,000 psychiatrists monthly, wrote on July 11, 2011 \\" In truth, the ‚Äúchemical imbalance‚Äù notion was always a kind of urban legend- - never a theory seriously propounded by well-informed psychiatrists.\\"\\"Psychiatry‚Äôs New Brain-Mind and the Legend of the Chemical Imbalance\\" by Ronald W. Pies, MD. July 11, 2011. = Combined networks of dopamine, serotonin, and glutamate = Psychopharmacologist Stephen M. Stahl suggested in a review of 2018 that in many cases of psychosis, including schizophrenia, three interconnected networks based on dopamine, serotonin, and glutamate - each on its own or in various combinations - contributed to an overexcitation of dopamine D2 receptors in the ventral striatum.

Power, Wealth and Women in Indian MahƒÅyƒÅna Buddhism: The Ga·πá·∏çavy≈´ha-s≈´tra 2011. pp. 114-115 Epigraphic evidence at NƒÅgƒÅrjuniko·πá·∏ça also provides abundant evidence of royal and wealthy female donors. =Praj√±ƒÅpƒÅramitƒÅ= A number of scholars have proposed that the MahƒÅyƒÅna Praj√±ƒÅpƒÅramitƒÅ teachings were first developed by the Caitika subsect of the MahƒÅsƒÅ·πÉghikas. They believe that the ' originated amongst the southern MahƒÅsƒÅ·πÉghika schools of the ƒÄndhra region, along the K·πõ·π£·πáa River. Guang Xing states, \\"Several scholars have suggested that the Praj√±ƒÅpƒÅramitƒÅ probably developed among the MahƒÅsƒÅ·πÉghikas in southern India, in the ƒÄndhra country, on the K·πõ·π£·πáa River.\\" These MahƒÅsƒÅ·πÉghikas had two famous monasteries near the AmarƒÅvati and the DhƒÅnyaka·π≠aka, which gave their names to the schools of the P≈´rva≈õailas and the Apara≈õailas. Each of these schools had a copy of the A·π£·π≠asƒÅhasrikƒÅ Praj√±ƒÅpƒÅramitƒÅ S≈´tra in Prakrit. Guang Xing also assesses the view of the Buddha given in the A·π£·π≠asƒÅhasrikƒÅ Praj√±ƒÅpƒÅramitƒÅ S≈´tra as being that of the MahƒÅsƒÅ·πÉghikas. Edward Conze estimates that this s≈´tra originated around 100 BCE. =TathƒÅgatagarbha= Brian Edward Brown, a specialist in TathƒÅgatagarbha doctrines, writes that it has been determined that the composition of the ≈örƒ´mƒÅlƒÅdevƒ´ Si·πÉhanƒÅda S≈´tra occurred during the ƒÄndra Ik·π£vƒÅku dynasty in the 3rd century CE as a product of the MahƒÅsƒÅ·πÉghikas of the ƒÄndhra region (i.e. the Caitika schools).Brown, Brian Edward. The Buddha Nature: A Study of the TathƒÅgatagarbha and ƒÄlayavij√±ƒÅna. 2010. p. 3 Alex Wayman has outlined eleven points of complete agreement between the MahƒÅsƒÅ·πÉghikas and the ≈örƒ´mƒÅlƒÅ, along with four major arguments for this association. After its composition, this text became the primary scriptural advocate in India for the universal potentiality of Buddhahood.Brown, Brian Edward. The Buddha Nature: A Study of the TathƒÅgatagarbha and ƒÄlayavij√±ƒÅna. 2010. p. 3 Anthony Barber also associates the earlier development of the TathƒÅgatagarbha S≈´tra with the MahƒÅsƒÅ·πÉghikas, and concludes that the MahƒÅsƒÅ·πÉghikas of the ƒÄndhra region were responsible for the inception of the TathƒÅgatagarbha doctrine. =Bodhisattva canons= In the 6th century CE, BhƒÅviveka speaks of the SiddhƒÅrthikas using a VidyƒÅdhƒÅra Pi·π≠aka, and the Apara≈õailas and Uttara≈õailas (P≈´rva≈õailas) both using a Bodhisattva Pi·π≠aka, implying collections of MahƒÅyƒÅna texts within these Caitika schools.Walser, Joseph. NƒÅgƒÅrjuna in Context: MahƒÅyƒÅna Buddhism and Early Indian Culture. 2005. p. 53 During the same period, Avalokitavrata speaks of the MahƒÅsƒÅ·πÉghikas using a \\"Great ƒÄgama Pi·π≠aka\\", which is then associated with MahƒÅyƒÅna s≈´tras such as the Praj√±ƒÅparamitƒÅ and the Ten Stages Sutra.Walser, Joseph. NƒÅgƒÅrjuna in Context: MahƒÅyƒÅna Buddhism and Early Indian Culture. 2005. p. 53 Avalokitavrata also states that MahƒÅyƒÅna s≈´tras such as the Praj√±ƒÅparamitƒÅ were recited by the Apara≈õailas and the P≈´rva≈õailas.Walser, Joseph. NƒÅgƒÅrjuna in Context: MahƒÅyƒÅna Buddhism and Early Indian Culture. 2005. p. 53 According to the TheravƒÅdin text NikƒÅyasa·πÖgraha, the large MahƒÅyƒÅna collection called the MahƒÅratnak≈´·π≠a S≈´tra (Taish≈ç Tripi·π≠aka, 310) was composed by the \\"Andhakas\\", meaning the Caitika schools of the ƒÄndhra region.Adikaram, E.W. Early History of Buddhism in Ceylon. 1953. p. 100Paul, Diana. The Buddhist Feminine Ideal. 1980. p. 12 This collection includes the ≈örƒ´mƒÅlƒÅdevƒ´ Si·πÉhanƒÅda S≈´tra, the Longer SukhƒÅvatƒ´vy≈´ha Sutra, the Ak·π£obhyavy≈´ha S≈´tra, a long text called the Bodhisattva Pi·π≠aka, and others.Sangharakshita. The Eternal Legacy: An Introduction to the Canonical Literature of Buddhism. 2006. p. 168 The MahƒÅratnak≈´·π≠a collection totals 49 MahƒÅyƒÅna s≈´tras, divided into 120 fascicles in the Chinese translation.  Disputes with TheravƒÅda  In the MahƒÅvihara tradition of the TheravƒÅda school, Buddhagho·π£a grouped the Caitika schools in the ƒÄndhra region, such as the RƒÅjagirikas and the SiddhƒÅrthikas, as the \\"Andhakas\\". Works such as the KathƒÅvatthu show that MahƒÅvihara polemics were directed overwhelmingly at these \\"Andhakas\\" in India. =Textual authenticity= The Caitika schools rejected the post-Asokan texts that were in use by the Anuradhapura Maha Viharaya tradition such as the Parivara, the six books of Abhidharma, the Patisambhidamagga, the Niddesa, some Jataka tales, some verses, and so on. For example, the Caitikas claimed that their own Jataka tales represented the original collection before the Buddhist tradition split into various lineages.Warder, A.K. Indian Buddhism. 2000. pp. 286-287 =Interpretation of Buddhist texts= One dispute recorded in the KathƒÅvatthu between the MahƒÅviharavasins and the Andhakas was a fundamental matter concerning the interpretation of the Buddha's teachings. The Andhakas are said to have held that the Buddha's actions and speech were supramundane, but some may only perceive the conventional or mundane interpretation. For the MahƒÅsƒÅ·πÉghika branch of Buddhism, the ultimate meaning of the Buddha's teachings was \\"beyond words\\", and words were merely a conventional exposition of the Dharma. The TheravƒÅda MahƒÅviharavasins, in contrast, argued that literal interpretations of the Buddha's teachings were best.Buescher, John.

O'Halloran, Library of Congress collection The Kitchen Debate () was a series of impromptu exchanges through interpreters between U.S. Vice President Richard Nixon, then 46, and Soviet First Secretary Nikita Khrushchev, 65, at the opening of the American National Exhibition at Sokolniki Park in Moscow on July 24, 1959. An entire house was built for the exhibition which the American exhibitors claimed that anyone in the United States could afford. It was filled with labor-saving and recreational devices meant to represent the fruits of the capitalist American consumer market. The debate was recorded on color videotape, and Nixon made reference to this fact; it was subsequently broadcast in both countries. History In 1959, the Soviets and Americans agreed to hold exhibits in each other's countries as a cultural exchange to promote understanding. This was a result of the 1958 U.S.‚ÄìSoviet Cultural Agreement. The Soviet exhibit in New York City opened in June 1959, and Vice President Nixon was on hand the following month to open the US exhibit in Moscow. Nixon took Soviet First Secretary Nikita Khrushchev on a tour of the exhibit. There were multiple displays and consumer goods provided by more than 450 American companies. The centerpiece of the exhibit was a geodesic dome which housed scientific and technical experiments in a 30,000 square-foot facility. The Soviets purchased the dome at the end of the Moscow exhibition. William Safire was the exhibitor's press agent, and he recounted that the Kitchen Debate took place in a number of locations at the exhibition, but primarily in the kitchen of a suburban model house which was cut in half for easy viewing.Safire, William. \\"The Cold War's Hot Kitchen\\", The New York Times, Friday, July 24, 2009. This was only one of a series of four meetings that occurred between Nixon and Khrushchev during the 1959 exhibition. Nixon was accompanied by President Eisenhower's younger brother Milton S. Eisenhower, former president of Johns Hopkins University. Khrushchev surprised Nixon during the first meeting in the Kremlin when he protested the Captive Nations Resolution passed by the US Congress which condemned the Soviet Union for its \\"control\\" over the \\"captive\\" peoples of Eastern Europe and called upon Americans to pray for those people. After protesting the actions of the US Congress, he dismissed the new technology of the US and declared that the Soviets would have all of the same things in a few years and then say \\"Bye bye\\" as they surpassed the U.S. Khrushchev criticised the large range of American gadgets. He satirically asked \\"Don't you have a machine that puts food into the mouth and pushes it down?\\", a reference to Charlie Chaplin's 1936 film Modern Times. Nixon responded that at least the competition was technological rather than military. Both men agreed that the United States and the Soviet Union should seek areas of agreement. The second visit occurred in a television studio inside the American exhibit. At the end, Khrushchev stated that everything that he had said in their debate should be translated into English and broadcast in the US. Nixon responded, \\"Certainly it will, and everything I say is to be translated into Russian and broadcast across the Soviet Union. That's a fair bargain.\\" Khrushchev vigorously shook hands to this proposal. Nixon argued that the Americans built to take advantage of new techniques, while Khrushchev advocated for Communism by arguing that the Soviets built for future generations. Khrushchev stated, \\"This is what America is capable of, and how long has she existed? 300 years? 150 years of independence and this is her level. We haven't quite reached 42 years, and in another 7 years, we'll be at the level of America, and after that we'll go farther.\\" Safire reported that Leonid Brezhnev was present and attempted to obstruct his photos. The third visit occurred inside the kitchen on a cutaway model home that was furnished with a dishwasher, refrigerator, and range. It was designed to represent a $14,000 home that a typical American worker could afford. Television broadcast and American reaction The three major American television networks broadcast the Kitchen Debate on July 25, 1959. The Soviets subsequently protested, as Nixon and Khrushchev had agreed that the debate should be broadcast simultaneously in America and the Soviet Union, with the Soviets threatening to withhold the tape until they were ready to broadcast. The American networks, however, had felt that delay would cause the news to lose its immediacy.Richard H. Shepard. \\"Debate Goes on TV over Soviet Protest\\", The New York Times, July 26, 1959 The debate was broadcast on Moscow television on July 27, albeit late at night and with Nixon's remarks only partially translated.Associated Press. \\"Soviet TV Shows Tape of Debate\\". The New York Times, July 28, 1959 American reaction was mixed. The New York Times called it \\"an exchange that emphasized the gulf between east and west but had little bearing on the substantive issue\\" and portrayed it as a political stunt.\\"News of the Week in Review\\", The New York Times, July 26 The Times also declared that public opinion seemed divided after the debates.\\"Moscow Debate Stirs U.S Public\\", The New York Times, July 27, 1959 Time magazine, on the other hand, praised Nixon, saying that he \\"managed in a unique way to personify a national character proud of peaceful accomplishment, sure of its way of life, confident of its power under threat.\\"\\"Better to See Once\\", Time, August 3, 1959 Nixon gained popularity because of the informal nature of the exchange, improving upon the lukewarm reception that he previously had with the American public.Paul Kengor. \\"The Vice President, Secretary of State, and Foreign Policy\\".

Journal of Interdisciplinary History Vol 1, No. 1 (1970) pp 49‚Äì105 He also impressed Khrushchev, according to William Safire. \\"The shrewd Khrushchev came away from his personal duel of words with Nixon persuaded that the advocate of capitalism was not just tough-minded but strong-willed.\\" Khrushchev claimed that he did all he could to bring about Nixon's defeat in his 1960 presidential campaign after their confrontation. The trip raised Nixon's profile as a public statesman, greatly improving his chances of receiving the Republican presidential nomination the following year.\\"Now the Summit\\", The New York Times, August 3, 1959 In the Kitchen Debate, Khrushchev claimed that Nixon's grandchildren would live under communism and Nixon claimed that Khrushchev's grandchildren would live in freedom. In a 1992 interview, Nixon commented that at the time of the debate, he was sure Khrushchev's claim was wrong, but Nixon was not sure that his own assertion was correct. Nixon said that events had proven that he was indeed right because Khrushchev's grandchildren now lived in freedom, referring to then recent collapse of the Soviet Union. March 30, 1992. Khrushchev's son Sergei Khrushchev was a naturalized American citizen.

While they are identified as a unique doctrinal tendency, they were part of the SarvƒÅstivƒÅda Vinaya lineage of monastic ordination.Tadeusz Skorupski, SautrƒÅntika, Oxford Bibliographies, LAST MODIFIED: 29 MAY 2015, DOI: 10.1093/OBO/9780195393521-0210 Their name means literally \\"those who rely upon the sutras\\", which indicated, as stated by the commentator Yasomitra, that they hold the sutras, but not the Abhidharma commentaries (sastras), as authoritative. The views of this group first appear in the Abhidharmako≈õabhƒÅ·π£ya of Vasubandhu. Name The name SautrƒÅntika indicates that unlike other North Indian Sthaviras, this school held the Buddhist sutras as central to their views, over and above the ideas presented in the Abhidharma literature. The Sarvastivada scholar Samghabhadra, in his Nyayanusara, attacks a school of thought named Sautrantika which he associates with the scholars ≈örƒ´lƒÅta and his student Vasubandhu.Dessein, Bart; Teng, Weijen. Text, History, and Philosophy: Abhidharma across Buddhist Scholastic Traditions, BRILL, 2016, pg 232 According to Samghabhadra, a central tenet of this school was that all sutra is explicit meaning (nitartha), hence their name. The SarvƒÅstivƒÅdins sometimes referred to them as the school, meaning \\"those who utilize the method of examples\\". This latter name may have been a pejorative label. It is also possible that the name 'DƒÅr·π£·π≠ƒÅntika' identifies a predecessor tradition, or another related, but distinct, doctrinal position; the exact relationship between the two terms is unclear. Charles Willemen identifies the SautrƒÅntika as a Western branch of the SarvƒÅstivƒÅdins, active in the Gandhara area, who split from the SarvƒÅstivƒÅdins sometime before 200 CE, when the SautrƒÅntika name emerged. Other scholars are less confident of a specific identification for the SautrƒÅntika; Nobuyoshi Yamabe calls specifying the precise identity of the SautrƒÅntika \\"one of the biggest problems in current Buddhist scholarship.\\" History The founding of the SautrƒÅntika school is attributed to the elder KumƒÅralƒÅta (c. 3rd century CE), author of a \\"collection of d·πõ·π£tƒÅnta\\" (D·πõ·π£tƒÅntapa·πÖkti) called the KalpanƒÅma·πá·∏çitƒ´kƒÅ. The SautrƒÅntikas were sometimes also called \\"disciples of KumƒÅralƒÅta\\". According to Chinese sources, Harivarman (250-350 CE) was a student of KumƒÅralƒÅta who became disillusioned with Buddhist Abhidharma and then wrote the Tattvasiddhi- ≈õƒÅstra in order to \\"eliminate confusion and abandon the later developments, with the hope of returning to the origin\\".Lin, Qian. Mind in Dispute: The Section on Mind in Harivarman‚Äôs *Tattvasiddhi, University of Washington, page 15-16 The Tattvasiddhi was translated into Chinese and became an important text in Chinese Buddhism until the Tang Dynasty. Other works by SautrƒÅntika affiliated authors include the AbhidharmƒÅm·πõtarasa-≈õƒÅstra attributed to Gho·π£aka, and the AbhidharmƒÅvatƒÅra-≈õƒÅstra attributed to Skandhila.Charles Willemen, Bart Dessein, Collett Cox (editors) Sarvastivada Buddhist Scholasticism, Handbuch Der Orientalistik, page 108. The elder ≈örƒ´lƒÅta, who was Vasubandhu's teacher is also known as a famous SautrƒÅntika who wrote the SautrƒÅntika-vibhƒÅ·π£a.Przyluski, Jean; Darstantika, Sautrantika and Sarvastivaldin. The Indian Historical Quarterly 1940, 6 pp.246--254 Gho·π£aka's AbhidharmƒÅm·πõtarasa and Harivarman's Tattvasiddhi have both been translated into English. The Buddhist philosopher Vasubandhu wrote the famous Abhidharma work Abhidharmako≈õakƒÅrikƒÅ which presented SarvƒÅstivƒÅda-VaibhƒÅ·π£ika Abhidharma tenets, he also wrote a \\"bhƒÅ·π£ya\\" or commentary on this work, which presented critiques of the VaibhƒÅ·π£ika tradition from a SautrƒÅntika perspective. The Abhidharmako≈õa was highly influential and is the main text on Abhidharma used in Tibetan and Chinese Buddhism up until today. Buddhist logic (pramƒÅ·πáavƒÅda) as developed by DignƒÅga and Dharmakƒ´rti is also associated with the SautrƒÅntika school. Doctrine No separate vinaya (monastic code) specific to the SautrƒÅntika has been found, nor is the existence of any such separate disciplinary code evidenced in other texts; this indicates that they were likely only a doctrinal division within the SarvƒÅstivƒÅdin school. The SautrƒÅntika criticized the SarvƒÅstivƒÅdins on various matters such as ontology, philosophy of mind and perception.Williams, Paul (editor). Buddhism: YogƒÅcƒÅra, the epistemological tradition and TathƒÅgatagarbha, Volume 5, page 48. While the SarvƒÅstivƒÅdin abhidharma described a complex system in which past, present, and future phenomena are all held to have some form of their own existence, the SautrƒÅntika subscribed to a doctrine of \\"extreme momentariness\\" that held that only the present moment existed. They seem to have regarded the SarvƒÅstivƒÅdin position as a violation of the basic Buddhist principle of impermanence. As explained by Jan Westerhoff, this doctrine of momentariness holds that each present moment \\"does not possess any temporal thickness; immediately after coming into existence each moment passes out of existence\\" and that therefore \\"all dharmas, whether mental or material, only last for an instant (ksana) and cease immediately after arising\\".Westerhoff, Jan, The Golden Age of Indian Buddhist Philosophy, Oxford University Press, 2018, p. 75. The SarvƒÅstivƒÅdin abhidharma also broke down human experience in terms of a variety of underlying phenomena (a view similar to that held by the modern Theravadin abhidhamma); the SautrƒÅntika believed that experience could not be differentiated in this manner. Sautrantika doctrines expounded by elder ≈örƒ´lƒÅta and critiqued in turn by Samghabhadra's Nyayanusara include:Dessein, Bart; Teng, Weijen. Text, History, and Philosophy: Abhidharma across Buddhist Scholastic Traditions, BRILL, 2016, pg 231 *The theory of anudhatu (or *purvanudhatu, \\"subsidiary element\\"), which is also associated with the theory of seeds (Bƒ´ja) espoused by Vasubandhu.Fukuda, Takumi. BHADANTA RAMA: A SAUTRANTIKA BEFORE VASUBANDHU, Journal of the International Association of Buddhist Studies, Volume 26 Number 2 2003. This theory was used to explain karma and rebirth. *The doctrine that caitasikas (mental factors) are but modes of citta (mind) and are not separate elemental dharmas which come together in \\"association\\" (samprayoga) as the VaibhƒÅ·π£ika believed. This view is also expoused at length in Harivarman's Tattvasiddhi.Lin, Qian. Mind in Dispute: The Section on Mind in Harivarman‚Äôs *Tattvasiddhi, University of Washington, page 10 *The doctrine that the sense-elements (dhatu) alone are real existents, not the aggregates (skandha) or sense spheres (ayatana). *A process of direct perception (pratyaksha) which differed from the direct realism of the VaibhƒÅ·π£ika, and instead posited a form of indirect representationalism.Ronkin, Noa, \\"Abhidharma\\", The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Fall 2014 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), URL = According to Vasubandhu, the SautrƒÅntika also held the view that there may be many Buddhas simultaneously, otherwise known as the doctrine of contemporaneous Buddhas.
