HeuristicLab has a strong focus on providing a graphical user interface so that users are not required to have comprehensive programming skills to adjust and extend the algorithms for a particular problem. In HeuristicLab algorithms are represented as operator graphs and changing or rearranging operators can be done by drag-and-drop without actually writing code. The software thereby tries to shift algorithm development capability from the software engineer to the user and practitioner. Developers can still extend the functionality on code level and can use HeuristicLab's plug-in mechanism that allows them to integrate custom algorithms, solution representations or optimization problems.  History  Development on HeuristicLab was started in 2002 by Stefan Wagner and Michael Affenzeller. The main motivation for the development of HeuristicLab was to build a paradigm- independent, flexible, extensible, and comfortable environment for heuristic optimization on top of a state-of-the-art programming environment and by using modern programming concepts. As the Microsoft .NET framework seemed to fulfill this requirements it was chosen as the development environment and C# as programming language. The first officially available version of HeuristicLab was 1.0 released in 2004 with an improved version 1.1 released in 2005. Development on the next version of HeuristicLab started in the same year. Among many things it was decided that HeuristicLab 2.0 should provide an entirely new user experience and lift the burden of programming off of the user. Therefore, HeuristicLab 2.0 was the first version featuring graphical tools for creating algorithms, however due to the complexity of the user interface HeuristicLab 2.0 was never released to the public. In the summer of 2007 it was decided that a new iteration of HeuristicLab was needed which should combine the usability of version 1.1 with the algorithm modeling concepts of version 2.0. HeuristicLab 3.0 was released internally in the beginning of 2008. In the next 2 years HeuristicLab was gradually improved which led to the release of version 3.3 in summer 2010 as open source software.  Features  A screenshot of HL showing the algorithm designer and a programmable operator ; Algorithm Designer : One of the features that distinguishes HeuristicLab from many other metaheuristic software frameworks is the algorithm designer. HeuristicLab allows to model algorithms in a graphical way without having to write any source code. Algorithms in HeuristicLab are a composition of operators which are chained together. This sequence of operators is called the operator graph and can be viewed and edited for any algorithm in HeuristicLab. HeuristicLab also offers a so called Programmable Operator that can include source code which can be written from within HeuristicLab. Seeing how other algorithms work allows to try out new ideas by starting from an existing algorithm and incrementally modifying it. Of course new algorithms can also be created by writing code. ; Experiment Designer : In HeuristicLab's Experiment Designer different algorithms with different parameter settings and problems can be composed, executed and analyzed. This is very useful for parameter tuning tasks where different parameterizations have to be executed and compared. HeuristicLab offerers a number of tools for graphically analyzing the results. ; Plugin Infrastructure : Every functionality in HeuristicLab is available as a plugin. Developers can create and reuse plugins to integrate new features and extend the functionality of HeuristicLab. ; Some other features : * Genetic programming models can be simplified. The genetic programming trees can be exported to MATLAB, LaTeX, Excel or other formats. * Algorithms, problems, experiments, and results can be saved. Algorithms can be executed, pause, saved, restored, and continued. * Algorithms and experiments can be executed in parallel on multi-core and distributed computing systems. * Charts can be customized and exported to various image formats. * Results and other data can be copied to and from Microsoft Excel or other applications. * Write and solve MIP/LP models with integrated Google OR-Tools * HeuristicLab can be coupled with external applications, such as simulation models, to optimize their parameters. * Support for distributed computing (HeuristicLab Hive) based on a master-slave model similar to e.g. Boinc  Supported algorithms  The following list gives an overview of the algorithms supported by HeuristicLab: *Genetic glgorithm-related ** Genetic Algorithm ** Age-layered Population Structure (ALPS) ** Genetic Programming ** Evolution Strategy ** CMA-ES ** Island Genetic Algorithm ** Island Offspring Selection Genetic Algorithm ** RAPGA ** SASEGASA ** Offspring Selection Evolution Strategy (OSES) ** Offspring Selection Genetic Algorithm ** Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II * Ensemble Modeling * Gaussian Process Regression and Classification * Gradient Boosted Trees * Gradient Boosted Regression * Local Search * Particle Swarm Optimization * Parameter-less population pyramid (P3) * Robust Taboo Search * Scatter Search * Simulated Annealing * Tabu Search * Variable Neighborhood Search * Performance Benchmarks * Cross Validation * k-Means * Linear Discriminant Analysis * Linear Regression * Nonlinear Regression * Multinomial Logit Classification * Nearest Neighbor Regression and Classification * Neighborhood Components Analysis * Neural Network Regression and Classification * Random Forest Regression and Classification * Support Vector Regression and Classification * Elastic-Net * Kernel Ridge Regression * Decision Tree Regression * Barnes-Hut t-SNE * User-Defined Algorithm: Allows to model algorithms within HeuristicLab's graphical modeling tools.

Tonson Group owns subsidiary Tonson Property, one of three property development companies in the Ratanarak Group. Tonson Group is developing Tonson Property as a luxury and ultra-prime property brand specialising in contemporary minimalist architecture and design. Involvement with Rama III District Chachchon‚Äôs father Krit Ratanarak is reported to be taking a lead in the development of Bangkok‚Äôs Rama III Riverside district in the central south west of the city. Krit is also reported to have bought the Prada store on Bond Street, London for ¬£32 million in 2011 through Tonson Group and property companies within the Ratanarak Group. The Rama III area was referred to as ‚Äòthe Wall Street of Bangkok‚Äô before the 1996 financial crisis. Today it is again regarded as an up-and-coming district of central Bangkok amid long-term moves to redevelop the area along the lines of London‚Äôs Canary Wharf. In 2010 the Rama III area saw the second highest increase in condominium prices in central Bangkok after the Central Business District. The Rama III area has a high volume of undeveloped land that runs along the river and some of the city‚Äôs best transport infrastructure, including the Bhumibol Bridge named after Thailand‚Äôs king who opened the new bridge in 2010. Rama III has been identified by the Bangkok Metropolitan Authority as part of a zone to be developed as a model of environmentally friendly transit. The Rama III riverside area was unaffected by the severe flooding that submerged many areas of Bangkok in November 2011.

Conard is an American businessman, author and scholar. He is the New York Times bestselling author of The Upside of Inequality: How Good Intentions Undermine the Middle Class and Unintended Consequences: Why Everything You've Been Told About the Economy Is Wrong; and a contributor to Oxford University Press‚Äô United States Income, Wealth, Consumption, and Inequality. Conard is an adjunct fellow at the American Enterprise Institute for Public Policy Research. Previously, he was a managing director at Bain Capital, where he worked closely with former presidential candidate Mitt Romney. Early life and education Conard grew up in the Detroit metropolitan area and graduated from the University of Michigan with a BSE in Operations Research in 1978. He earned his MBA with distinction from Harvard Business School in 1982. Early career and Bain Capital Prior to business school, Conard worked as an automotive engineer at Ford Motor Company. After graduating, he joined Bain & Company, the Boston-based global management-consulting firm, eventually becoming a vice president and leading the firm's industrial practice. Conard left Bain in 1990 to become a director at Wasserstein Perella & Co., a boutique investment bank. At Wassernstein, he headed the firm's Transaction Development Group. Conard was a managing director at Bain Capital, the head of Bain's New York office and the leader of its industrial practice. He joined the firm in 1993 prior to the firm raising $300 million of private equity. When Conard retired in 2007, Bain Capital managed $75 billion of capital and had offices in Boston, New York, San Francisco, London, Paris, Tokyo, Hong Kong, Shanghai, and Mumbai. His first acquisition was that of a pharmaceutical company for half a billion dollars. That same company later rose to more than $10 billion in value. While at Bain Capital, Conard took Waters Corporation, DDI, ChipPac, Innophos, and Sensata public and sat on their boards of directors. He still sits on the board of Waters Corporation. Writing, speaking, and scholar career Conard is the author of two top-ten New York Times bestsellers: Unintended Consequences: Why Everything You've Been Told About the Economy Is Wrong and The Upside of Inequality: How Good Intentions Undermine the Middle Class; and a contributor to Oxford University Press‚Äô United States Income, Wealth, Consumption, and Inequality. He became the tenth most searched author on Google in 2012 after publishing his first book. Conard joined the American Enterprise Institute as a visiting scholar in 2012. His work with AEI focuses on U.S. economic policy - in particular, on the effect of taxes, government policies, and finance on risk-taking and innovation. =Unintended Consequences= Conard published Unintended Consequences: Why Everything You've Been Told About the Economy Is Wrong in May 2012. The book was featured on the cover of the New York Times Sunday Magazine and went on to become a New York Times top ten non-fiction bestseller. While the New York Times predicted the book might become ‚Äúthe most hated book of the year,‚Äù leading economists such as Greg Mankiw, Andrei Shleifer, Steven Levitt, Nouriel Roubini, Tyler Cowen, and Glenn Hubbard publicly endorsed the book. In contrast to the New York Times, The Wall Street Journal called the book ‚Äúa full throttle defense of economic dynamism‚Ä¶refreshing at a time when so many take the failure of capitalism for granted.‚Äù The New York Times described Unintended Consequences as ‚Äú‚Ä¶arguing that growing income inequality shows the economy is working.‚Äù Timothy Noah, the author of The Great Divergence: America's Growing Inequality noted: ‚Äúthe biggest surprise, on opening Unintended Consequences, lies in discovering that this book isn't about income inequality at all.‚Äù The book analyzes why the U.S. has outperformed other high-wage economies, explains the causes of the financial crisis, and makes recommendations for accelerating growth in its aftermath. Conard summarizes his book in a 23-minute video for The UP Experience. Since its publication, Conard has made over 250 television appearances in which he has debated leading economists including Paul Krugman, Joe Stiglitz, Alan Krueger, Austan Goolsbee, and Jared Bernstein; journalists including Fareed Zakaria, Chris Hayes, and Andrew Ross Sorkin; and politicians such as Barney Frank, Howard Dean, and Eliot Spitzer. Conard also debated Jon Stewart for 33 minutes, one of Stewart's longest interviews. The video of the debate has received nearly 100,000 views. He has also written op-eds for The Wall Street Journal, The Washington Post, Foreign Affairs, Harvard Business Review, Fortune, and Politico, among others. =The Upside of Inequality= Conard published The Upside of Inequality: How Good Intentions Undermine the Middle Class in September 2016. The book debuted at #8 on the New York Times top ten non- fiction list and reached #1 on the New York Times business book list. The Upside of Inequality was met with positive reviews, including former president of Harvard University and economist Larry Summers, a very tough critic on the other side of the aisle, blurbed \\"I profoundly disagree but respect the clarity with which he makes his case...\\" and called it \\"a very valuable contribution\\" that will \\"sharpen your thinking on critical economic issues.\\" Noted economist Tyler Cowen who wrote on Bloomberg News: \\"Conard‚Äôs central idea is that risk-bearing equity capital is the truly scarce asset in most economic situations, and economic analysis should adapt accordingly. He is very creative in seeing some of the implications of this view. I... found it very stimulating to ponder. It puts many of the pieces together in a new and different way.\\" Harvard economist Greg Mankiw recommended Upside and interviewed Conard on CSPAN. David Author, George Borjas, Larry Lindsey, and other prominent economists also praised it. National Review said the book is a \\"rousing defense of conservative beliefs about how markets and incentives drive prosperity.\\" Political activities In March 2011, Conard made a $1 million U.S. dollar contribution to the super PAC promoting Mitt Romney's candidacy in the 2012 U.S. Presidential Election through W Spann LLC, a shell corporation that rendered him anonymous and appeared to exist for the sole purpose of contributing to Romney's campaign. In August 2011, he came forward to quell the controversy that arose. Personal life Conard is married to Jill Davis, an author and former writer for the Late Show with David Letterman.

It features four of the band's extended plays for Creation Records‚ÄîYou Made Me Realise (1988), Feed Me with Your Kiss (1988), Glider (1990) and Tremolo (1991)‚Äîand seven additional rare and unreleased songs. Compiled and remastered by the band's vocalist and guitarist Kevin Shields, EP's 1988‚Äì1991 was released as a two-disc CD set alongside remastered versions of My Bloody Valentine's two original studio albums, Isn't Anything (1988) and Loveless (1991). Upon its release, EP's 1988‚Äì1991 received positive reviews from music critics and placed in several international charts, including Ireland, the United Kingdom, Belgium, South Korea and Japan. Background Rumours of a My Bloody Valentine box set circulated amongst the general public in April 2008. Following a listing on HMV Japan's web site, media sources reported that a five-disc limited edition box set containing remastered versions of Isn't Anything (1988), Loveless (1991), a compilation of the band's EPs, a compilation of unreleased songs and a DVD were due to be released on 25 June 2008. A listing was also made available on Amazon UK, under the title Complete Box with an expected release date of 7 July 2008. In an article published in The Guardian in May 2008, Sean O'Hagan, a close friend of My Bloody Valentine's vocalist and guitarist Kevin Shields, commented on the rumours, saying: \\"a representative from Sony (who now possess the band's back catalogue) emailed to ask if I would write the sleevenotes for a very imminent My Bloody Valentine box set featuring Shields's remastered versions of Isn't Anything and Loveless, as well as all the songs that appeared on their now hard-to-find EPs and several unreleased tracks. An interview was scheduled for the following week as soon as Shields had approved the CD artwork. I am still waiting. In the meantime, the release of the box set has been postponed indefinitely.\\" Promotional copies of partially remastered editions of Isn't Anything and Loveless were leaked in June 2008 although neither compilations mentioned by O'Hagan or other media sources were released. Release EP's 1988‚Äì1991 was announced for release on 23 March 2012 through an official press release by Sony Music Ireland. The album was released in Ireland on 4 May 2012, and three days later in the United Kingdom, on CD and made available as a digital download from various online retailers. A CD-only version of the album was released in Japan on 12 June. Kevin Shields mentioned in an interview with Pitchfork Media that LP versions of the album are due \\"probably in a few months.\\" EP's 1988‚Äì1991 charted in four countries upon its release. The album debuted, and peaked, at number 21 on the Irish Albums Chart, falling to number 68 in its second week. The album also debuted at number 33 on the UK Albums Chart, number 192 on the Belgian Albums Chart in Flanders, number 189 on the Belgian Albums Chart in Wallonia, number 69 on the Gaon Albums Chart in South Korea, and number 17 on the Oricon Albums Chart in Japan. Reception EP's 1988‚Äì1991 has received positive reviews. AllMusic rated the album four out of five stars. Drowned in Sound reviewer Dom Gourlay awarded the album a 9 out of 10 rating and said \\"although marginally falling short of perfection as a complete package, [the album] is a fascinating collection detailing the unassailable rise of arguably the most influential guitar band this past quarter of a century.\\" Writing for The Irish Times, Tony Clayton-Lea said the release, along with Isn't Anything and Loveless, \\"highlight once again how traditional musical structures can be subverted and inverted to the point where it‚Äôs simultaneously familiar and comforting, yet odd and uneasy,\\" awarding it four out of five stars. Mic Wright of musicOMH noted that \\"for anyone who has been mesmerised by the power, beauty and oddness of MBV, it's yet another opportunity to get obsessed,\\" describing the album as \\"the sound of sweet sedation, like being serenaded by angels as you come out from under a general anaesthetic.\\" Pitchork editor Mark Richardson awarded the album a rare 9.5/10 rating and referred to the album‚Äîalong with Isn't Anything and Loveless‚Äîas the \\"best new reissue\\". Richardson selected the \\"crunchy pop tunes at the tail end of the disc\\" as the highlights of the album, noting that the songs \\"complement to the superior material on the EPs.\\" RT√â's entertainment network, RT√â Ten, referred to EP's 1988‚Äì1991 as \\"the real treasures in these re-releases\\" and called it \\"a cause for celebration.\\" State magazine awarded the album a full ten out of ten rating and praised the collection of EPs individually, calling You Made Me Realise \\"a massive step-up\\" from their previous material and the preceding Loveless EPs as \\"similarly revelatory\\".

The election saw the Scottish National Party make further advances by gaining 4 seats to become the largest party on the Council while also increasing their vote share significantly. The Scottish Labour Party lost 1 seat to become the second largest party on the Council. Independents gained a seat to have a total of 6 members. The Scottish Conservative and Unionist Party lost 2 thirds of their former seats while the Scottish Liberal Democrats were wiped out, losing both seats. Following the election the SNP formed a minority administration on the Council. This replaced the previous Labour minority administration which existed from 2007-2012.

Charles Tilly defines it as \\"a social movement advancing exclusive competing claims to control of the state, or some segment of it\\". Jeff Goodwin and James M. Jasper define it more simply (and consistently with other works) as \\"a social movement that seeks, as minimum, to overthrow the government or state\\". A social movement may want to make various reforms and to gain some control of the state, but as long as they do not aim for an exclusive control, its members are not revolutionary. Social movements may become more radical and revolutionary, or vice versa - revolutionary movements can scale down their demands and agree to share powers with others, becoming a run-of-the-mill political party. Goodwin distinguishes between a conservative (reformist) and radical revolutionary movements, depending on how much of a change they want to introduce. A conservative or reformist revolutionary movement will want to change fewer elements of the socio-economic and cultural system than a radical reformist movement (Godwin also notes that not all radical movements have to be revolutionary). A radical revolutionary movement will thus want both to take an exclusive control of the state, and to fundamentally transform one of more elements of its society, economy or culture. An example of a conservative movement would be the American Revolutionary movement of the 18th century, or the Mexican Revolutionary movement of the early 20th century. Examples of radical revolutionary movements include the Bolsheviks in Russia, the Chinese Communist Party and other communist movements in Southeast Asia and in Cuba (which attempted to introduce broad changes to the economic system), the movements of the 1979 Iranian Revolution against the shah, and some Central American guerrilla movements. For a movement to be considered revolutionary in the modern-day United States it should call for a change of the dominant economic system (capitalism) or the political system (two-party representative democracy) operating in that society. The same social movement may be viewed differently depending on a given context (usually the government of the country where it unfolds). For example, Jack Goldstone notes that the human rights movement can be seen as a regular social movement in the West, but it is a revolutionary movement under oppressive r√©gimes like that in China. Another example he mentions was the racial equality movement, which could be seen as revolutionary a few decades ago in South Africa, but is just a regular social movement. A revolutionary movement can be non-violent, although it is less common than not. Revolutionary movements usually have a wider repertoire of contention than non-revolutionary ones. Five crucial factors to the development and success of a revolutionary movements include: # mass discontent leading to popular uprisings # dissident political movements with √©lite participation # strong and unifying motivations across major parts of the society # a significant political crisis affecting the state - reducing state ability or will to deal with the opposition (see political opportunity) # external support (or at last, lack of interference on behalf of the state) See also *List of social movements  References  ","title":"Revolutionary movement"},{"id":"35463231","text":"Nils Miatke (born 30 January 1990 in Drachhausen) is a German footballer who plays as a midfielder for FSV Zwickau.

In the Sub-Saharan region of Africa where Angola is located, poor maternal health has been an ongoing problem contributing to the decreased level of health in the population in the early 21st century. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), maternal health refers to the health of women during pregnancy, childbirth, and the postpartum period. Maternal health is an important factor in determining the status of health in all countries as the health of newborns, which depends on the health of the mother, has an effect on the developmental stages of each individual. In Angola, maternal health is affected by many different factors, including the country's history, economic state, and overall prevalence of infectious diseases. The WHO lists the leading causes of maternal death as severe bleeding, infections, high blood pressure during pregnancy, obstructed labor, and unsafe abortions. These causes compose approximately 80 percent of all maternal mortalities worldwide with the vast majority occurring in developing countries. The other remaining factors that contribute to maternal death include malaria, anemia, and HIV/AIDS during pregnancy. The WHO also states that the reasons why so many women die during childbirth are usually poverty, long distance to care, lack of information, inadequate service, and cultural practices. All of these causes of maternal death, and the corresponding reasons, are very familiar among women in Angola. Introduction Angola represents a country with one of the highest maternal death rates in the world.Jacobsen, Kathryn. Introduction to Global Health. Jones and Bartlett Publishers, 2008. Statistics vary, but the estimated maternal mortality ratio (MMR) toward the end of the Civil War was between 1,281‚Äì1,500 maternal deaths to 100,000 live births.Pettersson, Karne. Christensson, Kyllike. Freitas, Engracia da Gloria Gomes de. Johansson, Eva. Adaptation of health care seeking behavior during childbirth: Focus group discussions with women living in the suburban areas of Luanda, Angola. Health Care for Women International, 2004. Accessed April 9, 2012 This estimate was taken during the late 1990s and, again, in 2002 by UNICEF and represents the MMR situation in the country at the end of the War. In 2008, the estimate decreased to around 610 deaths per 100,000 live births. In comparison, Sweden is estimated to have an MMR of 5deaths to 100,000 live births.http://www.childinfo.org/maternal_mortality_countrydata.php. Accessed April 10, 2012 According to the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), the MMR of the country appears to be decreasing since the end of the Civil War in 2002. However, it is still one of the highest in the world. On average, women give birth 7.2 times. The infant mortality ratio is 154 deaths per 1,000 live births. The mortality rate of children under 5 years of age is 254 per 1,000 live births. These figures represent improvement since the end of the War, although they still are very high and show the need for improvement in maternal health.. Accessed 10, 2012 Despite the improvements that have been made, the Human Development Index for 2011 shows a poor level of maternal health in Angola. A high level of adolescent fertility and low use of contraceptives for women of all ages was reported. This is observed by the high total fertility rate. These factors contribute to an elevated risk of health problems during pregnancy and childbirth.Human Development Report 2011 Tables. Human development statistical annex Factors contributing to maternal health Economist Amartya Sen gave an important definition of human health. Sen stated, \\"Health is among the most important conditions in human life.\\" Health is crucial in the growth of an economy, academic achievements, mental development, opportunities for employment and earning an income, as well as security and well-being. Maternal health is considerably more important because it is directly related to the health of an unborn child. The health conditions of a pregnant woman affect her child throughout the child's life. Sen explains that an individual's capabilities to live a fulfilled life are dependent on their mental and physical capabilities. These capabilities are greatly influenced by maternal factors.Dereulin, Severine. Shahani, L. An Introduction to the Human Development and Capabilities Approach: Freedom and Agency. London Earthscan. 2009. In any given country, the health of the people is affected by many different factors. Health factors can be as simple as daily life activities, as well as national and cultural customs. Specifically, maternal health, according to Dr. Jacobsen, is closely related to social economic class, education, economics, topography, and infectious diseases.Jacobsen, Kathryn. Introduction to Global Health. Jones and Bartlett Publishers.,2008. The health risks and factors that women in Angola face are unique to the country, as well as reflect the issues of the region of Sub- Saharan Africa. The health of a population is greatly influenced by what takes place in women before, during, and after pregnancy. Diseases, political conflict, cultural beliefs, health systems and practices all contribute to the health of a population by influencing maternal health. =Infrastructure= Many human capabilities have been listed by a number of economists. These capabilities try to outline the important factors needed by individuals in order to live full and enriched lives. The writer and feminist economist, Martha Nussbaum, created a list of essential capabilities that individuals need in order to be productive and content. One of the human capacities listed by Nussbaum is bodily health.Nussbaum, Martha. Promoting Women's Capabilities. Achieving bodily health in Angola is difficult for many reasons, but, especially, for the women who are in their child-bearing years. Martha Nussbaum and other feminist economists have tried to show in an academic environment how important gender equality is in order to establish and improve economies and health care on every level of society. In the case of Angolan women, the level of gender inequality involving health care service is unclear.Sen, Amartya Many Faces of Gender Inequality. Frontline. volume 18 issue 22. 2001. The main issue facing women in Angola is not related to cultural inequality, but the fact that the health care system, infrastructure, and economy were devastated during the Angolan Civil War and have been slow to rebuild. The government has tried since 2002 to provide more basic services to the citizens, but progress is slow. Shantha Bloemen, a writer for the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), reported that progress to meet the necessary requirements that ensure an enriched life is improving slowly because the country's infrastructure and medical personnel are not yet sufficient to meet the needs of the population.Bloemen, Shantha. Brick by Brick and Doctor by Doctor, Angola rebuilds it Health Care System. http://www.unicef.org/infobycountry/angola_54038.html. Accessed April 30, 2012 =HIV/AIDS= Eileen Stillwaggon, an economist at Gettysburg College, has written extensively on HIV/AIDS and the problems associated with the disease throughout Sub-Saharan Africa and Angola. The AIDS epidemic in the area has caused generations of people to die and has been spreading throughout the region since the 1980s.Stillwaggon, Eileen. Feminist Economics. Race, Sex, and the Neglected Risks for Women and Girls in Sub-Sahara Africa. 2008. Stillwaggon addresses a number of risk factors that increase the risk of HIV/AIDS in individuals, as well as populations. She specifically addressed women and girls in Africa as falling victim to the increased risk of the HIV/AIDS infection due to both biological and social risk factors. HIV/AIDS is a problem throughout the country. It has decreased the population's health and increased the risks associated with pregnancy. However, HIV/AIDS has affected maternal health in Angola less severely than in other Sub-Saharan African countries. The Civil War affected the prevalence of HIV/AIDS paradoxically in the country. The War caused large-scale internal migration to take place across Angola. Individuals and families moved in order to avoid conflict. Citizens also left the country as refugees. Migrating people have a higher risk of contracting communicable diseases, including HIV. Throughout the 1970s, 1980s, and early 1990s, AIDS swept across many countries in the region. The Civil War in Angola created an environment of political instability and violence. The War decreased the number of foreign people entering the country and was responsible for a smaller initial population infection rate during the first years of the AIDS epidemic in Sub-Saharan Africa.Agadjanian, Victor. Avogo, Winfred. Forced Migration and HIV/AIDS Risk in Angola. IOM. 2008. This is evident by CIA country reports stating that the HIV/AIDS rate in Angola in 2008 sat at only 2 percent, compared favorably to neighboring Zambia, which has an HIV/AIDS rate of 13 percent.https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world- factbook/geos/za.html. April 10, 2012 =Angolan Civil War= Of all the factors that negatively affect maternal health in Angola, the Angolan Civil War may have been the most severe. According to USAID, during the War as many as 1 million people were killed, 4.5 million people became internally displaced, and 450,000 fled the country as refugees. The consequences of the War have been devastating throughout the country and had a particularly negative effect on women seeking prenatal care. In a study done to assess the health care-seeking behavior of Angolan women, it was made clear by Karne Pettersson that the War damaged the country's health infrastructure. Records in war-torn areas were not kept during episodes of violence, and many were lost due to the War. Vital records, including death and birth certificates, were not kept current, and access to reliable health care was limited for citizens. For this reason, data from this time period regarding maternal health is difficult to find. This harsh reality during the War was partially responsible for a cultural shift. Pettersson goes on to explain that the war has affected the attitudes of women in Angola regarding health care and child birth. Understandably, the War has made women more cautious and distrustful of government programs, including health care programs. The War has caused behavioral changes in women seeking health care. It is common for women today to not seek medical attention when in childbirth but to give birth to their children at home. =Unsafe abortion= Unsafe abortions are one of the leading causes of maternal death in the developing world. In many African countries, abortions are considered taboo. Women who get abortions often are associated with negative stereotypes due to cultural beliefs. Many of these cultural issues force women to seek abortions in unsafe ways. According to the Women's international Network News, these \\"back-alley\\" abortions are the cause of thousands of deaths every year.Africa: Huge death toll of illegal abortions ignored. Women's International Network News; Summer98, Vol. 24 Issue 3. More political attention has been given to the issue of abortions in Angola due to the unsafe procedures and the health effects on young women. Justice Minister Guilhermina Prata recently presented legislation with the intent to help decrease the number of illegal abortions done in Angola. In the region of Sub- Sahara Africa, the majority, if not all, of illegal abortions are unsafe. It is believed that 40 percent of women who have an illegal abortion die due to complications of the surgery. Information on unsafe abortions in Angola is difficult to obtain. However, due to the nature of the health care system and the prevalence of unofficial fees, the number of illegal abortions is potentially much higher than is reported. The debate regarding unsafe abortions in Angola is not new and is highly affected by the cultural and religious atmosphere in the country.Makamure, Lucia. Angola: Abortion bill causes uproar. Southern Africa Gender Protocol Alliance. http://www.genderlinks.org.za/article/angola-abortion-bill-causes- uproar-2012-02-05 2012. Accessed April 10, 2012 =Cultural aspects of maternal health= Maternal health in Angola is greatly influenced by culture. However, the culture in Angola is a culmination of a society that has faced decades of war, urbanization, political uncertainty, and a number of other issues that have caused poor health. According to Pettersson, on the individual level, women named the following four factors that highly influenced their decisions regarding child birth and prenatal care: 1) the individual's perception of the quality of care, 2) the process of labor, 3) the significance of informal fees, and 4) the woman's perception of being empowered to make her own decisions regarding childbirth. Perceptions of the quality of care vary greatly across the country. For many women, care at a formal facility is so bad that they prefer to stay at home and have a home delivery. The process of labor is affected by strong traditions. Great influence is given by grandparents with more traditional methods who normally suggest home births. However, due to more access to technology and the mixing of women in larger cities, a shift is taking place moving toward more advanced means of childbirth in formal hospitals. Despite this shift of thinking from traditional to more modern ways of child birth, other factors, such as high informal fees and an individual woman's perception of being \\"courageous\\", seem to bar women from seeking care in health facilities. Many women still view childbirth as an opportunity to show the physical strength that they have. =Poverty= One of the major problems with maternal health in Angola is the existence of widespread poverty throughout the country. The poverty in the country is a result of the long period of violence. The infrastructure was so badly damaged during the War that electricity is not reliable or accessible to many areas, especially areas of dense poverty. Poverty is associated with an elevated risk of all kinds of health problems, especially with maternal health. USAID reported in 2010, in Angola, 68 percent of the population lives below the poverty line, living on only $1.70 per day. Of these, 28 percent live in extreme poverty, living on only $0.70 per day. Poverty discourages women from seeking healthcare during childbirth. It is common for women to give birth at home for free instead of going to the hospital and being forced to pay ‚Äúhidden\\" fees or ad hoc fees in order to receive care. This causes complications in childbirth. If a woman waits too long to seek care and experiences a complication during delivery, emergency attention is not given, and the woman, child, or both, face a higher risk of death.Pettersson, Karne. Christensson, Kyllike. Freitas, Engracia da Gloria. Johansson, Eva. Strategies Applied by Women in Coping With ad hoc Demands for Unauthorized User Fees During Pregnancy and Childbirth. A Focus Group Study From Angola. Health Care for Women International, 28:224‚Äì246, 2007. In Angola, ad hoc demands at clinics are commonplace. Kyllike Christensson, co-author of \\"Ad Hoc Demands,\\" found while studying the social aspects of child birth behavior that it is not uncommon for patients to arrive at a hospital or a clinic in need of care and be forced to wait until payment is made. In many cases, women chose to have their children at home instead of go to a hospital. This reality, along with the negative level of confidence many women have of the clinicians, results in higher numbers of MMR and IMR. Policies to improve maternal health Christensson explained that many international programs to improve maternal health are currently being developed and implemented in Angola. The government has implemented programs that train midwife providers in order to increase the number of births attended to by a credentialed clinician. UNICEF has reported that the government is also investing money into education and health care. The money that is generated due to the large oil reserves in the country is being used to improve maternal and child health across the country. Free clinics are available to pregnant women and women with small children.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mA1SnN4N_zo. Accessed April 9, 2012 Along with government programs in Angola, many different non-governmental organizations are becoming involved with health care and maternal health. The Christian Children Fund Angola began a program in the country shortly after the end of the Civil War. The program addressed malnourished children and specifically provided emergency obstetric care. Programs like these vary in size and their ability to adequately reach large populations. However, they continue to be important in increasing maternal health throughout the country.Whitson, Donald T. Emergency Health and Nutrition Project Bocoio, Angola. 2004.

Both episodes were directed by Jayson Thiessen and written by M.A. Larson. Part one of the episode aired in the United States on September 17, 2011 on the Hub, while part two aired the following week, on September 24. The episode received a Nielsen household rating of 0.2, and was viewed by over 339,000 viewers, making it the highest- rated episode ever broadcast by the Hub at that point. The series follows a unicorn named Twilight Sparkle as her mentor Princess Celestia guides her to learn about friendship in Ponyville. Twilight becomes close friends with five other ponies: Applejack, Rarity, Fluttershy, Rainbow Dash, and Pinkie Pie. In the first part of the episode, a draconequus named Discord escapes from his stone prison, while Twilight and her five friends discover that the Elements of Harmony have been stolen. They must retrieve them in order to save Equestria from eternal chaos, but have to contend with Discord's mind games first. In part two, Twilight is determined to find the Elements of Harmony after her best friends are hypnotically brainwashed by Discord, and all of Equestria begins to fall into disarray. Plot =Part one= Cheerilee walks her students through Canterlot's sculpture garden, where she shows her class a strange statue of a chimera-like creature known as a draconequus, a creature that represents discord and a lack of harmony. The Cutie Mark Crusaders then get into a fight over exactly what the statue represents. Soon, the statue begins to mysteriously pulse, though nopony notices at the moment. As the group moves away from the statue, the statue starts to crack, and an evil laughter is heard. Later, Twilight Sparkle and the Mane Six find strange phenomena occurring around Ponyville, such as cotton candy clouds dispensing chocolate milk, ears of corn in their husks instantly turning into popcorn, and Applejack's apples growing bigger. Twilight's magic is not strong enough to stop it, though they can get some of the phenomena somewhat under control. Soon, Spike coughs up a letter from Celestia, urging Twilight and her best friends to see her in Canterlot. On arrival, Celestia takes them to a grand hall with stained-glass windows, including one heralding the ponies' defeat of Nightmare Moon, and to the vault where the Elements of Harmony are kept. Celestia tells the ponies that the strange phenomena they have noticed is being caused by an old enemy of hers named Discord, the spirit of chaos and disharmony. Celestia tells of how Discord once ruled Equestria in an eternal state of chaos before she and Luna defeated him by turning him into a stone statue (the Draconequus statue that stood in the sculpture garden). But he has recently escaped his prison and Celestia asks Twilight and her best friends to use the Elements of Harmony to defeat Discord, however they are shocked to find that the box that normally holds the Elements is completely empty upon opening it. Suddenly, an image of Discord on the stained-glass windows comes to life, teasing the ponies and Celestia. Discord claims to have taken the Elements and alludes to where they can be located. Twilight believes Discord is referring to the hedge maze near the castle and the six race there. Discord appears in his true form and challenges the ponies to a game, telling them that the only rules are they are not allowed to fly or use magic (enforcing this rule by making the unicorns' horns and Pegasi's wings vanish), and that if any of them leave the game, he automatically wins. Despite their handicap, the ponies enter the maze, but they are soon separated by Discord's magic. He is able to individually test Applejack, Pinkie Pie, Rarity, and Fluttershy against their respected Elements, making them be momentarily hypnotized, lose some of their color, and become a polar opposite of their Element. Twilight encounters each of them after this point, aware of their personality shift, but oblivious to their encounter with Discord. Soon, they find Rainbow Dash, having regained her wings, flying away from the maze and betraying not only her Element of Loyalty, but also forfeiting the game by leaving; Discord makes the maze fall around them and he boasts his victory, warning of an incoming storm of chaos. =Part two= Twilight confronts Discord by accusing him of cheating. However, Discord counters this by reminding her that, while he had hinted at where the Elements were, he never said anything about them being in the labyrinth. As he disappears and teases the ponies with another storm of chocolate rain, Twilight realizes that a line from Discord's riddle actually refers to Ponyville itself. Determined and with renewed hope, Twilight leads her best friends back to Ponyville, which Discord has altered in a chaotic manner. Discord continues to taunt Twilight, who is determined to get back to the library in town to find a way to defeat Discord while her best friends' personalities continue to become more warped, losing even more of their color until they are completely monochrome. Managing to get them all into the library, Twilight and Spike locate the book about the Elements of Harmony, and are surprised and delighted to find the book actually contains the Elements. She forces her best friends to wear the Elements, though they are more willing to help after she angrily states that the sooner they defeat Discord, the sooner they never have to see each other again; Twilight also assigns Spike as the temporary Element of Loyalty because Rainbow Dash is not present. They go to face Discord, but the Elements fail to activate. The other four ponies and Spike quickly drop the elements and depart, leaving Twilight despondent and finally losing her own color. Twilight sadly returns to the library, preparing to pack and leave Ponyville, when she finds Spike coughing up scroll after scroll. Twilight is surprised to find these to be the friendship report letters that she had previously sent to Celestia, and the memories of her friendships in Ponyville make her regain her color. Inspired by this, she returns to her other four best friends and uses a memory spell to remind them of their friendship, cancelling Discord's magic and returning them to normal. Rainbow Dash is still apart from the group, however, and without her, the Elements will not activate. They find Rainbow Dash protecting a cloud, believing it to be her home of Cloudsdale. They start to give chase, but Rainbow flies away. They quickly use a hot-air balloon, pulled along by Fluttershy, to catch up to Rainbow. At first, it seems that Rainbow has the upper hand, but they manage to catch up to her as soon as Fluttershy is reminded of Discord. The ponies eventually catch Rainbow and manage to tie her down long enough for Twilight to cast her memory spell. The ponies collect the Elements and reapproach Discord, who casually passes off their threat. However, with all six ponies restored, the Elements activate, firing a rainbow-beam of light that engulfs Discord and Ponyville. Ponyville immediately returns to normal and Discord is once again turned to stone. The ponies' victory is celebrated by a large ceremony at Canterlot led by Celestia, who praises their heroism and the power of their friendship and reveals a new stained-glass window of the six ponies defeating Discord. Production John de Lancie guest stars in the episode as Discord \\"The Return of Harmony\\" was directed by James Wootton, with Jayson Thiessen functioning as supervising director and was written by M.A. Larson. John de Lancie guest stars in the episode as Discord. According to Thiessen, Lauren Faust had conceived of Discord while watching a series of Star Trek: The Next Generation episodes, using Q (portrayed by de Lancie) as a template. When it came time to consider voice actors for the role, the production team had considered using a stand-in for de Lancie, but were surprised to learn that de Lancie himself was available for the role. Upon hearing the news, the team altered some elements of the episode to provide more allusion to his previous role, such as the flash of light when Discord would appear or disappear. de Lancie was later surprised by the large positive responses from the adult fans of the series, leading him to learn more about this fandom, and participating as executive director of the documentary about the fandom Bronies: The Extremely Unexpected Adult Fans of My Little Pony. de Lancie has since re- voiced Discord for later episodes of the series and promotions on The Hub. The episodes were the final to feature Lauren Faust as executive producer. Near the end of the first season, Faust announced that she had left the series, and for the second season, she stepped down as executive producer, to become consulting producer. Her involvement in the second season consisted mainly of story conception and scripts. Despite her decreased participation, she still has high hopes for the staff members, stating \\"the gaps I have left are being filled by the same amazing artists, writers, and directors who brought you Season 1. I'm certain the show will be as entertaining as ever\\". In addition, a new storyboard editor named Jim Miller was hired for the second season, and a majority of the animation was \\"outsourced\\" to animation company Top Draw. According to Thiessen, this allowed for a greater pre-production process for season two episodes. \\"The Return of Harmony\\" was the first episode of the second season. According to Thiessen, the Hub and its parent company Hasbro had \\"approved the season two before we were done with season one; they knew they had something good on their hands.\\" He explained, \\"they saw [the success] of the show early on, which is [‚Ä¶] rare because usually a season will be one and aired before a network will renew it because they want to know what the numbers are, but they, I guess, a bit of a risk on their behalf, but I'm glad they did.\\" The finale scene of the episode is a parody of the ending from the 1977 film Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope. According to Thiessen, the joke was an \\"afterthought\\"; originally, there was going to be a more elaborate ending, but due to time constraints, a new finale was created. During the animation stage, one of the directors noted that the scene was \\"kind of like the ending to A New Hope,\\" and so, the decision was made to create \\"scene for scene\\" parody of the original. Reception =Ratings= The first part of \\"The Return of Harmony\\" aired on September 17, 2011, while the second part aired on September 24. The first part was viewed by over 339,000 viewers, making it one of the highest-rated episodes ever broadcast by The Hub. In addition, the first part received a 0.2 Nielsen household rating in the United States, meaning that it was seen by 0.2 percent of all households watching television at the time of the broadcast. The episode received a 0.1 18‚Äì49 rating, meaning that it was viewed by 0.1 percent of all 18- to 49-year-olds watching television at the time of broadcast. The episode was later beaten by \\"A Canterlot Wedding,\\" which scored a total viewership of 483,000 and 475,000. =Reviews= Both parts of the episode received widespread universal acclaim. In a review of the first part, Carina Belles from We Got This Covered called the series \\"plain awesome\\", noting that it was \\"basically Lord of the Rings, only with ponies.\\" Belles praised the expressing animation, writing \\"the already incredible art has also improved, with a wider variety of styles being used.\\" A review from Republibot of the first part of the episode called the plot \\"an interesting revisit of the premise of the pilot ['Friendship Is Magic']\\". Furthermore, the review called John de Lancie's performance \\"superb\\" and praised the animation. Reviews for part two were positive as well. Republibot gave the episode a largely positive review, however, the site did note that the episode \\"feels a bit rushed, even as a two-parter,\\" and that \\"Fluttershy's and Rarity's restoration sequences in particular feel rushed and inadvertently echo [the mind wipe sequences from] Men in Black.\\" Many reviews praised the series' pop culture references. Carina Belles applauded the series for making subtle pop culture references, citing Pinkie Pie's mention of \\"Chocolate Rain\\", a reference to the Internet meme. Many reviews and critics positively commented on the episode's ending, which featured a parody of the closing scenes to the original Star Wars. Cyriaque Lamar from i09 wrote positively of the scene, writing, \\"Honestly, modern My Little Pony fandom is one of those things I'm live-and-let-live about, even though it baffles me entirely [but] this morning's episode of the show did a little homage to A New Hope.\\" i09 later named the scene one of \\"The Best Television Moments of 2011\\". John Farrier from Neatorama wrote, \\"It's hard for Bronies to get respect from some quarters, but [the closing Star Wars parody] scene alone says much in favor of the show.\\" The entertainment site Dorkly, an affiliate of CollegeHumor, featured a video comparing the two scenes and wrote, \\"May the adorable be with you.\\" Topless Robot writer Anne Mathews named the Star Wars parody the \\"Nerdiest Easter Egg\\" in My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic, writing, \\"This scene is a direct shoutout to the fans and completely cements the creator Lauren Faust's geek cred. The only thing missing is a Wookiee yell at the end!\\" Home media release The two-part episode was part of the Season 2 DVD set, released by Shout Factory on May 14, 2013. It was also part of the \\"Cutie Mark Quests\\" DVD, released on June 30, 2015, alongside \\"The Show Stoppers\\" and the two-part season five premiere episode \\"The Cutie Map\\" (labelled as \\"Cutie Markless\\").

A 24-episode anime television series adaptation by J.C.Staff aired between October 2012 and March 2013. It has been licensed by Sentai Filmworks in North America.  Plot  Sakura Dormitory is a dorm of the high school affiliated with Suimei University of the Arts (often shortened as Suiko), which hosts the strangest, most trouble- making students. After being kicked out of the normal dorm for keeping a stray cat, Sorata Kanda moves into Sakura Dormitory. As he starts to get used to the life in the dorm, Mashiro Shiina, a world-famous artist who cannot even take care of her daily life, moves in. Sorata is forced to become Mashiro's caretaker. The story is about their daily lives as well as mental growth.  Characters  = Sakura Dormitory residents = ; : :Sorata is the male protagonist of the story. He is a second-year (later third year) student of Suiko, who lives in room 101 of Sakura Dormitory. He was kicked out of the regular dorms after he chose not to give up a stray cat he found (he cannot resist taking in stray cats, and he ends up keeping seven of them in his room). As many of the Sakura Dormitory residents have outstanding grades and art skills, he often feels plain and normal among them. :Chihiro, the dorm supervisor, chooses him to take care of Mashiro, the \\"pet girl\\" referenced in the title, and he is, understandably, reluctant to do so but ends up getting used to it. At the end of the thirteenth novel, he confesses to Mashiro. Sorata decides to become a computer game designer, but his game proposal to a famous computer game company is repeatedly turned down. In the sixth novel, he decides to make a game on his own. A major plot of the story is how his personality and self-expectation evolves. ; : :Mashiro is the female protagonist of the story. She is the resident of room 202, as well as a world famous artist who transferred into Suiko as a second-year to learn how to draw manga. Although her artwork is widely admired, she knows nothing other than drawing and has an extreme lack of common sense and living ability. Due to this, Sorata is forced to \\"adopt\\" Mashiro and help her out with the basic tasks of everyday life that everyone else takes for granted; he even has to pick out underwear for her to wear or she will go out without them. Her focus on what she wants to do, draw manga, awes Sorata and inspires him. She has very bad grades, since she cannot pay attention in class, but she can still pass the make-up exams by photographically memorizing all of the answers with her art talent. In the third novel, Mashiro starts to develop feelings for Sorata and she even claims that she cannot live without him. According to Mashiro, she plans to live in Sorata's house and work as a manga artist after graduation. ; : :Nanami is Sorata's classmate, who later moves into Sakura Dormitory's room 203. Although she is harsh to Sorata, she actually has a crush on him, and everyone aside from Sorata has noticed this. She left her home to become a voice actress without her parents' consent, and has to live on her own. After she finds herself low on money, as well as noticing that Sorata and Mashiro are becoming close, she chooses to move into Sakura Dormitory, which is more affordable than standard student housing. She meets Sorata's mother in the fifth novel and earns the latter's admiration. Sorata's mother even tells him that she would welcome Nanami as a daughter-in-law. In the sixth novel, she fails her voice actor tryout and decides to reconcile with her parents before deciding her next step. She is able to convince her parents to let her continue her VA studies and returns to Sakura Dormitory for her final year of high school. She speaks with a Kansai dialect when she is angry or flustered. ; : :Misaki is the resident of room 201, a third-year- student of Suiko who later attends Suimei University of the Arts. She is very outgoing and optimistic and Sorata often refers to her as an \\"alien\\". She has very good grades and is very good at drawing, but the school decided to send her to Sakura Dormitory because she pays too much attention to drawing anime and manga. She is very good at animation and can handle the work required to make one without help from others. She has already sold an animation to a famous publishing company and made enough money off of it to live comfortably for the rest of her life. She has feelings for Jin, and openly expresses them, but Jin turns a blind eye to this and dates many other girls, which makes her very depressed. The two finally become a couple during the fifth novel. In the sixth novel, she registers their marriage without asking Jin, making them officially husband and wife; her new name is . She moves out of Sakurasou after graduating and moves into the house next door which has a recording studio in the basement. ; : :Jin is the resident of room 103 and a third-year student of Suiko. He is Misaki's childhood friend and has feelings for her, but he feels he is not good enough for her, so he ends up becoming a playboy. He has dated several girls, including Misaki's elder sister, but in the end he breaks up with all of them. He finally goes out with Misaki during the fifth novel. He wants to become a playwright/script writer worthy of her artistic talents, and chooses to attend a university in ≈åsaka to achieve his goal. To pacify Misaki, he gives her a marriage registration form with his signature as a warranty that he will return, but Misaki signs and turns it in on the same day that he leaves for ≈åsaka, which makes them officially married. ; : :Ry≈´nosuke is the resident of room 102. Ry≈´nosuke is a second-year student of Suiko. He is a hikikomori who rarely leaves his room, and usually communicates with others by text message or e-mail. To reduce the need to personally communicate with others, he has written the \\"Maid\\" AI program, which responds to messages in his place. He is an expert of computer programming, and gives Sorata much useful advice about his computer game. According to Ry≈´nosuke, his ultimate goal is to have Maid become a real human. He has gynophobia, and will pass out when a girl touches him. This affliction becomes more severe after Rita falls in love with him and kisses him on the cheek. His favorite food is tomatoes, saying that he trusts tomatoes more than anything in the world. He is nicknamed \\"Dragon\\" by Misaki. During his middle school years, Ry≈´nosuke was a part of a game project made by his friends, but his intelligence was such that the others could not keep up with him and sidelined him from the project, resulting in Ry≈´nosuke becoming wary of forming friendship with anyone (including everyone in Sakura Dormitory). However, after a call from Rita, he manages to get over his fear of friendship and help his friends prevent Sakura Dormitory from being demolished. ; : :Maid is Ry≈´nosuke's artificial intelligence program. Originally, Ry≈´nosuke designed Maid to filter and automatically reply to his cellphone messages and e-mails to save him time. However, Ry≈´nosuke keeps expanding Maid's AI ability. Maid is now capable of blocking and replying to a message or e-mail by her own preference, using new words she has recently learned from other messages, e-mails, or the Internet in the reply, anticipating people's emotions, writing computer or cellphone viruses and sending them out by herself, hacking into Suiko's computer network to steal information and even giving Sorata solid advice about his computer game program. The only way to distinguish Maid's messages from those of a human is that she replies too quickly. Ry≈´nosuke lets Maid enter a social networking service, with most people who meet her not realizing she is an AI program. According to Ry≈´nosuke, his ultimate goal is to give Maid an artificial body and become a real human. :As running the Maid program requires a lot of hard drive space and RAM, Ry≈´nosuke is forced to keep her working in the high standard server set in room 102 of the Sakura Dormitory, while giving orders and receiving the results via the Internet when he is absent from the room. On the computer, Maid is shown as a 3D model (designed by Misaki) on the bottom right corner of the screen, and will be shown using various tools and stationary depending on her current work. Maid appears to have a crush on Ry≈´nosuke, although it is unknown whether she has developed the feelings herself or if it is simply a part of her program design. After Rita falls in love with Ry≈´nosuke and kisses him, Maid starts a fight with her over the Internet since Ry≈´nosuke constantly lets Maid handle Rita's love letters and e-mails. Maid even asks Sorata to go to England and help her eliminate Rita. ; : :Chihiro is an art teacher at Suiko and the dorm supervisor of Sakurasou. She is Mashiro's cousin and arranged for her transfer to Suiko. She once wanted to become a professional artist and was a conscientious student while attending Suiko herself. Unfortunately her dreams did not come true for unknown reasons and she became an art teacher. Despite being a teacher, she often gives Sorata improper advice. Perhaps due to her disappointment, she has become cynical and lazy, often foisting undesired tasks, such as looking after Mashiro, on the unfortunate Sorata. She appears to only be interested in drinking and trying to find a man. ; : :Rita was Mashiro's roommate and caretaker when Mashiro lived in England. She became jealous of Mashiro's talent, and so advised Mashiro to draw manga hoping to see her fail, but later she regrets her actions and comes to Japan to bring Mashiro back to England. After realizing Mashiro's determination, she gives up and returns to England with Mashiro's father and starts studying art again. Even though he is cold to her, she falls in love with Ry≈´nosuke and kisses him on the cheek before leaving, which makes him pass out. Afterwards he ignores her and has his Maid AI handle all of her e-mails, which only fortifies her resolve. In the fifth novel, she visits Japan again to give Ry≈´nosuke Valentine's Day chocolate, and manages to kiss him on the lips, which makes him pass out again. She moves into Sakurasou after Nanami leaves. ; : :Iori is Saori Himemiya's little brother and also a first-year student who starts living in Sakura Dormitory after Jin and Misaki graduate. He moves to Sakura Dormitory because he was caught peeking on the girls' bath. He has feelings for Kanna. ; : :Kanna is a first-year student living in Sakura Dormitory after Jin and Misaki graduate. Despite having the highest score on the entrance exam, she moves to Sakura Dormitory because she could not stand sharing a room with another person, let alone a noisy one. This roommate was later revealed to be Y≈´ko. = Suiko students = ; : :Y≈´ko is Sorata's younger sister and is in her third year of junior high school; she later attends Suiko. She borders on having a brother complex and wants to be spoiled by Sorata. At first, she does not like any of the other girls because she thinks they are taking her brother away, but after spending time with them, she at least accepts Mashiro because she \\"has a few issues\\". However, she still dislikes Nanami because not only can she take care of herself, she also helped Sorata and Y≈´ko's mother with many of the household chores during her stay at their home, garnering praise from their mother. She is quite air-headed and has a tendency to jump to conclusions about her brother and the other girls, mostly ending in perverse ways. She enters Suiko as a first-year student during Sorata's third year. ; : :Daichi is Sorata's and Nanami's classmate. He has feelings for Nanami. ; : :Mayu is Sorata's and Nanami's classmate. ; : :Saori is a third-year student in the Music department who Misaki calls \\"Hauhau\\", and often produces music for Misaki's anime.

Founded in 1968, the museum is housed at the Wilan√≥w Palace complex in Warsaw, Poland. History The Poster Museum at Wilan√≥w is part of the National Museum in Warsaw. It was established through a grant of several thousand posters belonging to the National Museum, made by the Museum's Director, Stanislav Lorentz. The Poster Museum opened in June 1968, becoming the world's first museum dedicated to this art form. At its founding, the Museum had 13,000 items in its collection, including around 500 posters preserved from the World War II era. Its collection is continually growing, through gifts from Polish and international donors. During the mid-20th century, Polish interest in poster art, and poster collecting, grew substantially, influenced by the visual style of national filmmakers such as Andrzej Wajda. Collectors sought posters advertising films, plays, and musicals in particular. Warsaw's annual poster art competition gained a worldwide reputation, ultimately leading the founding of the Poster Museum in 1968. The Poster Museum is housed in a modern exhibition space erected behind the historic Wilan√≥w Palace, a 19th-century riding school located on the outskirts of Warsaw. Collections Poster for the Hygienic Exhibition in Lublin by Konstanty Kietlicz-Rayski from 1908 More than 55,000 posters are in the collections of the Poster Museum at Wilan√≥w. 30,000 items represent the history of poster art in Poland from 1892 to 2002. The Poster Museum houses one of the world's largest collections of posters. The Museum rotates its collection through permanent exhibits on Polish poster art and history, foreign poster art, and thematic exhibits.

He was born is a city known at the time as Yizhou, which is the present-day city of Linyi in the southern part of Shandong Province. Along with his fellow student Dahong Baoen, Daokai is considered to have returned the Caodong/S≈çt≈ç Zen lineage to prominence after its near extinction a generation earlier. He was so prominent, in fact, that an extensive biography appeared in the Xudeng lu, a compendium of biographies of prominent monks, in 1101, before he had even reached the height of his career, which was quite unusual for such biographies. The earliest full account of his life appears in Juefan Huihong's biographical compilation of 1119, the Chanlin sengbao zhuan (Chronicle of the Sangha Treasure in the Groves of Chan). This source speaks very highly of Daokai, despite the fact that its author was a member of the competing Rinzai school. According to his funerary inscription of 1127, he ordained 93 students during his life, and many of these went on to become prominent teachers themselves. Biography According to the Chanlin sengbao zhuan (Chronicle of the Sangha Treasure in the Groves of Chan) of 1119, Daokai's first spiritual practices were centered on Daoism, specifically those aimed at achieving immortality. To this end, he did not eat grain and went to live in the mountains as a hermit. Eventually, he gave this up and began practicing Zen at Shutai Temple outside the old capital city of Kaifeng, in modern Henan Province. He later became a student of Touzi Yiqing and received dharma transmission from him. He left Touzi in 1082 and took a position at a public monastery, but was later assigned to the well-known White Horse Temple and Longmen Temple. After this he served at Dayang Jingxuan's former monastery on Mount Dayang in Yingzhou. He again moved, this time to Dahong in Suizhou around 1103. In 1104, the Emperor Huizong ordered Daokai to become the abbot of Shifang Jingyin Temple in the capital, Kaifeng. In 1107 he moved to a different temple, Tianning Wanshou, in the same city. This temple was known as a Chongning temple, which were set up by the Emperor so that its residents would pray for his long life. While Daokai did not have a choice in the matter, he later refused to accept a purple robe given to him by the emperor in protest of this system, and he was exiled as a result to Zizhou near modern Jinan in his home province. Huihong's biography claims that crowds of people mourned as he left the city. The following year, however, the emperor ceased his punishment after Daokai sent a poem explaining his thoughts on the matter to an individual named Wang Songnian, who was in contact with the emperor. At this point, Daokai apparently wished to go to Zhejiang to spread his teaching, but decided to stay in his hometown after finding his father in old age. A wealthy government official named Liu Fengshi patronized the construction of a small monastery for Daokai at Lake Furong near his home village. In 1117, this monastery was give a plaque by the emperor giving it the name Huayan Chan Monastery, indicating the emperor's complete change of heart regarding him by that time. In 1118 Daokai died on the fourteenth day of the fifth month.

In the 1990s, during liberalization, the phenomenon became more pronounced and negative effects appeared in the rural female population. Afterwards, agricultural markets became gendered institutions, affecting men and women differently. In 2009 World Bank, FAO & IFAD found that over 80 per cent of rural smallholder farmers worldwide were women, this was caused by men migrating to find work in other sectors.World Bank, FAO & IFAD. 2009. Gender in agriculture sourcebook. Washington, DC. World Bank. Out of all the women in the labor sector, the UN found 45-80% of them to be working in agriculture The term has also been applied to other phenomena, including increasing shares of women in the agricultural workforce, male outmigration from rural areas, decreasing women's opportunities in agricultural productivity, and lower rural pay due to skill exclusions.Whitehead, 2009 p.45 Activists have argued that the trend is dangerous and leads to food insecurity.ActionAid 2010 Background Women's role in the agricultural sector increased during the 1960s and has continued to grow. Women have been increasingly counted as heads of household, running their own farms without male assistance. These households are often poorer than their male counterparts. Their plot sizes are usually smaller and have less access to other productive resources, like education, tools, and seeds, something termed ‚Äúinvestment poverty‚Äù.Reardon and Vosti 1995 Women agricultural workers are also less likely to have social connections, like credit and market networks. In the rural environments there are two types of crop orientations, subsistence and export. Female-headed households are more likely to be subsistence orientated, which are often poorer. Export farmers are more likely to have substantial land endowments and to be male-headed. After structural adjustments export farmers became more vulnerable to price shocks, and women within this category more so.Whitehead, 2009 p.43 Female- headed households also became more likely to change from high value export crops to subsistence. Women running their own farms is a historically new trend, as men have traditionally done the heavy farm work. The use of the plow has typically been only men, and in many regions men still dominate. Typically, a reliance on the plow has been associated with male-dominated farming, which leads to crop inefficiencies if they leave.Boserup, 1970 = Diversification = These policies taxed the then profitable agricultural sector while raising tariffs on imports. The revenue was used to support urban government-sponsored enterprises. This created higher paying jobs in the city, which in combination with high taxes on agriculture, started drawing men towards cities. This early migration period was the first attempt to diversify income, mainly in-country. Women remained behind to farm alone, and do wage work locally. With male migration, the amount of labor dedicated to farming fell, as women retained the child care responsibilities. This trend continued during liberalization, when the taxes (and subsidies) for agriculture were removed causing declines in agricultural incomes. These same structural adjustments removed support for the industries that held many jobs in the city, which further depressed incomes. = Discrimination = Social norms affect how men and women approach and are rewarded from the market. Men are seen as the bread-winners and thus are expected to be paid more and work year- round. Women are seen as secondary laborers, and thus tend to work in seasonal or otherwise temporary jobs. These positions are low wage and low skill. Women are not expected, nor encouraged to compete for higher wages or said jobs. Women who attempt to bargain for higher wages are seen as ‚Äúdistressed‚Äù, and viewed negatively.Whitehead, 2009 p. 50 Export oriented agro-business perpetuates these stereotypes. Often women work seasonal jobs and aren't considered for permanent positions. These low-skill entry level jobs have low wages with no raises. Sometimes these positions require literacy and women wouldn't be eligible, as rates of education and literacy are higher in men than in women. = Food insecurity = The feminization of agriculture has been associated with food insecurity through poverty and limited crop yields. Structural adjustment of the 1990s abolished fertilizer and seed subsidies to rural farmers.Razavi, 2009 p.4 This has decreased crop growing potential and profitability. With some household's being on the brink of food-insecurity. In an attempt to compensate for lack of fertilizer, some have switched to lower quality crops. Measurable effects on rural mortality rates have started to become apparent.Whitehead, 2009 p.39 Theoretical causes =Economic liberalization= Liberalization critics argue the phenomenon is a result of failed liberalization policies.Deere, 2009 p. 121 During the 1980s there was a shift away from the Import substitution policies towards economic liberalization. The aim was to cut the government deficits and increase revenue through export led growth. It was believed that free markets would encourage growth through privatization. Reductions of the budget deficits often required Austerity. Included in these policies was the disassembly of state entities, social support mechanisms, and various subsidies. The reduction of tariffs led to instability of farm income, due to market swings. Farmers have begun to grow more conservative crops and rely on wage labor, rather than farm income. When social subsidies on education and health were removed, women became responsible for supplementing the increased cost. This required an increase in their income, which led to diversification, and thus male out-migration. Women then remain on the farm, with the remainder of the family. In both Africa and Latin America male migration has been associated with feminization of the rural agricultural economy. Liberalization also removed governmental institutions beneficial to farmers. Before liberalization there existed public credit facilities, as well as input assistance (fertilizer and seeds etc.), and marketing. In the period after liberalization, these institutions were never replaced by private mechanisms. Smaller farmers who once benefited from these, now have reduced productivity. These reductions, have negatively affected rural populations.Whitehead, 2009 p.46 =Other causes= In Africa, regional issues affect the male rural population. The prevalence of disease (mainly HIV/AIDS) and warfare have reduced male populations. These effects can combine migration leading to substantial differences in gender. In the Congo there are as many as 170 women working for every 100 men in agriculture.  Criticism  The most common criticism is the lack of available data.Deere 2009, p. 107Whitehead 2009, p. 51 A prominent concern is how to interpret the available data. The increase in women's participation in agriculture can be interpreted several ways. One is that more women are working in agriculture than were previously. The second is that men are working less, and women have remained are constant, and thus the share of women is rising. A third possibility is that neither have changed and that recent data have only begun to capture the women already working in agriculture.Deere 2009, 108 Determining causation has also been controversial. Without better data it is difficult to differentiate the regional trends from the universal. The developing world is broad and poorly understood. It is likely that a trend affecting one region will not apply to another. Activism =Organizations= Several organizations have become concerned with the detrimental effects, and have sponsored projects. The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations works to improve food security. They stress increasing access to many necessary inputs to productive agriculture, including credit, education and training, and land.Food and Agriculture Organization (1995) ‚ÄúWomen, agriculture and rural development: a synthesis report of the Africa region‚Äù. http://www.fao.org/docrep/X0250E/X0250E00.htm They also promote the development of rural female farmers organizations. There has also been a move towards updating the legal codes of countries to give women the legal rights of property ownership and credit, which can allow for increased food security. ActionAid is also involved in activism towards the alleviation of poverty. Two of their main purposes is to argue for gender equality and women's rights. They are involved in adult literacy and other education projects. They argue for a gender approach to agricultural development.ActionAid (2010). Womens rights and access to land http://www.actionaid.it/filemanager/cms_actionaid/images/DOWNLOAD/Rapporti_DONNE_pdf/HerMile_AAItaly.pdf In 2008, the HungerFree Women project was created to address the issues facing rural women. The project was designed to enhance give media visibility to rural women, address discriminatory laws, prioritize women's rights and organize rural women. =Policies= With women as a large portion of agriculture workers, they are often denied power to make decisions about resources and access they have to land.. Advocates have argued for policy change to address concerns. Actionaid argues for increasing funding to the agricultural sector for rural development. The World Bank argued that development policy should increase access to the agricultural resources that men have (e.g. land, credit facilities, health care).Cornheil 2008 http://www- wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2007/11/08/000310607_20071108143621/Rendered/PDF/41367optmzd0Fe1Agriculture01PUBLIC1.pdf See also * Feminist economics * Feminization of poverty * Feminization of migration * Women and the environment through history * Women in agriculture in Afghanistan * Women in agriculture in India * Women in agriculture in Japan * Women in agriculture in the United Kingdom References =Sources= * Boserup, Ester (1970.)

In contrast to ATV, Fidesz-backed Origo.hu reported three days later that √Åder would remain as President despite such \\"serious candidates\\" as Balog and Barnab√°s Lenkovics, a former President of the Constitutional Court. The news portal added that re-election was a decision only for √Åder, who had asked for time to consider his candidature. ATV also referred to the government's dilemma: was it appropriate to elect a Calvinist President (Balog), with the incumbent Prime Minister (Viktor Orb√°n) and House Speaker (L√°szl√≥ K√∂v√©r) also belonging to that ecclesiastical community, despite Hungary's Catholic majority? Index.hu journalist Szabolcs Dull quoted views and opinions from the ruling party, which told, in addition to Balog's Calvinist religion, which indeed appeared to be a strong argument against his nomination in the eyes of the Prime Minister, who sought good relations with the Catholic Church in Hungary; removing Balog from his current position as Minister of Human Resources would have caused major problems in the ministry and the entire government structure, in contrast to an expected political benefit if Fidesz elected Balog president. Dull argued that √Åder had in the event not caused \\"big trouble\\" during his first term, and so his re-election \\"did not represent a significant political risk\\" to Orb√°n. On 5 January 2017, left-wing liberal portal 444.hu reported that several members of the Fidesz presidency, primarily L√°szl√≥ K√∂v√©r and Gergely Guly√°s, had succeeded in convincing Orb√°n at the Dobog√≥k≈ë meeting to choose √Åder rather than Balog. On 23 April 2018, Balog announced, he will step down as Minister of Human Resources, disagreeing with the prime minister over structural considerations, who intended to keep the type of superministry system. Balog was appointed managing director of the Fidesz's Foundation for Civic Hungary. Balog also resigned from his parliamentary seat on 12 September 2018, with the effect date of 17 October 2018. Retiring from daily politics, he continued his career as a Calvinist pastor. He was replaced by Gyula Budai. Personal life He is married. His second wife is Judit R√©v√©sz.

Furthermore Hurst had not received any assurances Sugong would teach him before he left. Hurst was allowed to train under Sugong and eventually wrote his book about him. This was an undertaking complicated by Sugong's temperamental character which saw Hurst and his translator suffer numerous verbal onslaughts.

Background  Foremen of Izhevsk weapon factory, 1880s Izhevsk and Votkinsk were important centers of military production in Russian Empire. Workers of the state military factories and members of their families were about 73-74% of the cities' populations, and many families had an old tradition of working in military industry. Workers at military factories had a good salary; many of them owned a pieces of land, used for agriculture. After the February Revolution of 1917, political life in Izhevsk and Votkinsk began to develop very fast. On 4 May, the Izhevsk committee of Russian Social Democratic Labour Party split into Bolshevik and Menshevik factions. In the summer, Izhevsk became one of the main centres of the Union of Socialists-Revolutionaries Maximalists. In the first half of 1918 in Izhevsk there were two political blocks: Bolsheviks and Socialists-Revolutionaries Maximalists against Mensheviks and right-wing Socialists-Revolutionaries. In May and June, the Bolsheviks and Maximalists lost elections in the city's Council; after that they used military force to disperse the City Council. The Union of the Veterans of World War I supported the right-wing Socialists. There were about 4,000 members of the Union in Izhevsk, many of them had firearms at home.  Uprising  On 6 August, Kazan was captured by the White Army. Most Bolsheviks and Maximalists from Izhevsk were sent to the front lines. On 7 August, the Bolsheviks organized a big meeting for drafting the workers into the Army. The workers said that they would go to the army if they would be organized together in groups (not dispersed through different units), and if the Bolsheviks organized aid for worker's families, etc. The Bolsheviks refused. On 8 August, the uprising began. Workers took firearms from the factory's stores, and officers from the Veterans' Union began to organize workers in military units (at the middle of September there were about 15,000 soldiers in the Izhevsk Army). At that time there were less than 100 Bolsheviks in the city; they understood that it would be impossible to defend the city and retreated. The rebels organized a new Izhevsk Soviet (city council). Workers from Votkinsk asked Izhevsk for help, because they had no firearms. Izhevsk sent a detachment; each soldier in this detachment carried two rifles. With the help from Izhevsk, Votkinsk was captured by rebels at 17 August. After this, the Izhevsk Soviet transferred power to the Kama region KOMUCH (named in accord with Samara's KOMUCH), headed by N. Yevseev. The Bolsheviks did not have enough troops for crushing the rebellion and fighting against the White Army at the same time, but they understood the necessity of preventing the connection of the People's Army of Komuch with the resources of Izhevsk's military factories. During August‚ÄìSeptember, the Red Army fought against the White Army near Kazan, and rebels used this time for spreading the rebellion. On 11 September, Kazan was captured by Red Army. After this, the Bolsheviks began to use more troops against rebels. Living conditions in rebel territory became worse, and workers didn't receive wages. Some rebel troops preferred to change sides. After organising a Provisional All-Russian Government on 23 September, the Kama region KOMUCH was dissolved, and N. Yevseev became a special commissar of the Provisional Government. At the beginning of the rebellion, the Izhevsk Army had been built up from volunteers; now it became a conscript army. At the beginning of October, the 2nd Red Army captured Sarapul and began to prepare for storming Izhevsk. The main battle took place on 7 November, to the south of the city. The rebels didn't have enough ammunition and organized so-called \\"psychological attack\\": they advanced by ceremonial march with music, with rifles but without shooting. Some red troops retreated, others came into hand-to-hand combat. Both sides had big losses. The rebels had to leave their fortified lines and retreat to the town of Izhevsk. They understood that there were not enough forces for defending the city, and retreated to Votkinsk during the night. On 8 November, the 2nd Red Army entered Izhevsk, and Votkinsk on 11 November.  Aftermath  Rebel troops forced the Kama river and became a part of the Western Army of White Movement as Izhevsk Division and Votkinsk Division. After losing the civil war, many White soldiers from Izhevsk and Votkinsk went to Manchuria and the United States.

The firm is located in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. Justason Market Intelligence polled regularly in the lead-up to the November 2011 municipal election. The firm accurately predicted that incumbent Mayor Gregor Robertson would be returned to office. In the race between Mayor Gregor Robertson and challenger, Suzanne Anton, the firm's prediction was validated by election results. Specializations =Civic affairs= Justason Market Intelligence may be best known for its work in civic issues, including municipal politics and quality of life evaluations. Municipal politics In September 2010, a little more than a year before the November 2011 municipal elections, Justason Market Intelligence released the first of a series of regular polls of City of Vancouver residents regarding the performance of the mayor and municipal party support. Justason Market Intelligence was the first polling firm to identify Non-partisan Association (NPA) Councillor Suzanne Anton as a potential candidate for mayor. Several months prior to announcing her candidacy and about a year prior to the November 2011 municipal elections, a Vancouver Courier story quotes the poll's written analysis: \\"In a scenario where Suzanne Anton is the NPA candidate for mayor, support for the NPA increases to 38 per cent while support for Vision, with Gregor Robertson the incumbent mayoral candidate, falls to 41 per cent-- creating a statistical dead heat.\\" Suzanne Anton declared her candidacy in May 2011. Quality of Life In September 2010, the firm released the first of several polls examining quality of life in Vancouver. The firm reported relatively high satisfaction among Vancouver residents, despite concerns about homelessness and housing affordability. The firm completed a larger scale quality-of-life study among Metro Vancouver residents in October 2011, which found 77% of residents satisfied with their local economy. The poll also found majorities of citizens satisfied with green space, schools and tap-water quality. Community recreation and fitness services In May 2011, Justason Market Intelligence completed a survey of Maple Ridge and Pitt Meadows residents about this region's parks and leisure services. The objectives of this research were to measure usage of and satisfaction with the parks and recreation programs and facilities provided by Maple Ridge and Pitt Meadows Department of Parks and Leisure Services. The research found that usage overall and overall performance assessments had remained stable since 2008; that volunteerism in the communities had increased. The firm has completed other studies of leisure and recreation services in Metro Vancouver, including the North Vancouver Recreation Commission in 2004 and 2007. =Energy sector= Barb Justason, the firm's principal, began evaluating public opinion regarding B.C.'s offshore oil and gas potential in 2001, when the provincial government, under Premier Gordon Campbell, began exploring this opportunity. In March 2012, Justason Market Intelligence released a poll demonstrating public opposition to tanker traffic through B.C.'s inside coastal waters, as proposed in the Enbridge Northern Gateway Pipelines proposal. =Waste management= Justason Market Intelligence completed qualitative and quantitative components of the Municipal Water and Waste Management Labour Market Study with ECO Canada.

It has been held in North America, Europe, Asia and Australia. The Delhi International Sanskrit Conference of 1972 is considered to be the first World Sanskrit Conference. So far it has been held in India four times (1972, 1981, 1997, 2012).http://www.sanskritassociation.org/conferences.php History Ancient Sanskrit on Hemp based Paper. Hemp Fiber was commonly used in the production of paper from 200 BCE to the late 1800s. According to the official web-site of the International Association of Sanskrit Studies (IASS), several Sanskrit scholars from major Indian universities perceived that the International Congress of Orientalists \\"did not allow sufficient scope for full discussion of Sanskrit and allied subjects\\". These scholars approached the Government of India, which arranged to convene the first International Sanskrit Conference at New Delhi in March 1972. The next year, at the 29th International Congress of Orientalists, Sanskrit scholars from all over the world got together to form the IASS. The main responsibility of the IASS was to organise World Sanskrit Conferences at various places around the world. The 1972 New Delhi conference was retrospectively recognised as the \\"First World Sanskrit Conference\\". The sixteenth conference in Bangkok, Thailand in 2015 received unprecedented support from the Indian government. In what some have called a \\"display of soft power\\", India sent a group of 250 Sanskrit scholars, led by External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj, who gave the inaugural address in Sanskrit. The conference was also supported by and held in honor of Maha Chakri Sirindhorn, Princess of Thailand, who has supported Sanskrit education, and had received a master's degree in Pali and Sanskrit from Chulalongkorn University. A few controversies surrounded the 2015 conference. It was opened by Rajiv Malhotra, an author of popular books who does not hold a PhD in Indology or any related field but has published a number of well-received books on Sanskrit and Indology. Malhotra has been accused of plagiarism and is well known for his ad hominem attacks on Indologists. The 2018 conference in Vancouver featured a session titled \\"The Story of Our Sanskrit,\\" where two female Sanskritists presented and a third female Sanskritist moderated. The session was plagued by sexist and casteist comments from an unruly audience. In an email sent to the INDOLOGY listserv, the lead conference organizer, Dr. Adheesh Sathaye, publicly apologized for the \\"hooliganistic behaviour of some members of the audience.\\" Dates and venues The first World Sanskrit Conference was held in Vigyan Bhavan, New Delhi, India between 26‚Äì31 March 1972. Dr. Ranganathan was its chairman. Thereafter, conferences have been held as follows: *Torino, Italy, in June 1975. *Paris, France, between 20‚Äì25 June 1977 *Weimar, German Democratic Republic, between 23‚Äì30 May 1979. *Varanasi, India in 1981. *Philadelphia, United States, in 1984. *Leiden, Netherlands, in 1987. *Vienna, Austria; 27 August‚Äì2 September 1990. *Melbourne, Australia, in January 1994. *Bangalore, India, in January 1997. *Turin, Italy, in April 2000. *Helsinki, Finland, in July 2003. *Edinburgh, United Kingdom, in July 2006. *Kyoto, Japan, from 1 to 6 September 2009. *New Delhi, India from 5 to 10 January 2012. *Bangkok, Thailand from 28 June to 2 July 2015.Conference Academic Program from Sanskrit Studies Centre, Bangkok: 16th World Sanskrit Conference June 28 to July 2, 2015, Bangkok (Academic Program) (accessed 29 July 2015 *Vancouver, Canada, from July 9 to July 13, 2018. =Future venues and dates= *The eighteenth conference is scheduled to be held in Canberra, Australia in 2022.

Reception Emily Ashby of Common Sense Media, which informs parents about media choices for their children, gave Crash & Bernstein a three star rating out of five, stating, \\"This is one of those case-by-case shows that needs you to be mindful of your child's response to what he or she sees on TV\\". She added, \\"Since much of the show's laughs result from the characters' misbehavior, it's important that viewers understand the difference between fantasy and reality. If your son and his brother decide to remedy a lack of space in their bedroom by knocking down a wall, that will have more serious consequences than what they see Wyatt and Crash suffer from the same action. If your kids do watch, be sure you talk about how the characters' actions would be received in the real world instead of the TV universe.\\" Interactivity In July 2013 on DisneyXD.com online, viewers could vote for their favorite nose for Crash.

Elena is portrayed by actress Jordana Brewster, and has appeared on the show since its pilot episode, which first aired on June 13, 2012. Dallas follows the trials and tribulations of the wealthy Ewing oil family living in Dallas, Texas. Casting and creation =Casting= \\"It's like you're a part of something so iconic. I just hope the fans of the original series like watching the new generation interact with Bobby and J.R. Ewing and Sue Ellen.\\" On January 29, 2011, Jordana Brewster was the first non-original cast member to sign on for the series continuation. Nellie Andreeva described the role: \\"The project ‚Äî written by Cynthia Cidre and Warner Horizon ‚Äî centres on feuding cousins John Ross Ewing III and Christopher Ewing, the offspring of brothers J.R. and Bobby Ewing, respectively, as they clash over the future of the Ewing dynasty. Brewster will play Elena, the daughter of the ranch‚Äôs cook, who is locked in a love triangle with Christopher and John\\". On February 1, 2011, it was announced that actor Josh Henderson had signed on to play Elena's love interest, John Ross Ewing III. When asked about both her character and the show, Brewster said: \\"You know, I'm on the third season now of the original Dallas. It's just so much fun to watch. When I saw our pilot, I got so emotional when the theme song came on. It's like you're a part of something so iconic. I just hope the fans of the original series like watching the new generation interact with Bobby and J.R. Ewing and Sue Ellen. It's kind of like what happens with Fast and the Furious, you get to pick up where characters left off and you get to see them evolve. There is still family drama playing out, there are those who still care about money more than anything and those who care about the family more than anything. There are those age-old themes that are so much fun to watch play out. I'm in a love triangle between John Ross Jr. (Josh Henderson) and Christopher (Jesse Metcalfe). I grew up with the boys on the ranch, so I'm very familiar with their antics. It's a really fun, juicy role to play. I'm also an engineer.\\" Storylines Elena Ramos grew up on Southfork Ranch with John Ross and Christopher. She is the cook's daughter and moved to Dallas from Mexico with her parents when she was 8 years old. The three children were close, but Christopher had her heart, and they became engaged after dating in graduate school. However, Pamela Rebecca Barnes (posing as Rebecca Sutter) ended their engagement by sending an email, pretending it was from Christopher, telling Elena not to show up at their wedding because he was done with her. Christopher, believing Elena has ditched him, is heartbroken and eventually seeks comfort in Pamela Rebecca, marrying her. Elena ends up dating Christopher's cousin and arch-enemy, John Ross. Based on information John Ross digs up, Elena and Christopher learn they were set up, but when Pamela announces she is pregnant with Christopher's twins, he decides to remain with her, and Elena chooses John Ross. However, it gets out that Pamela was lying about her identity and is an impostor of Rebecca Sutter, the actual sister of the con man posing as Pamela's brother. Pamela also admits she was behind the scheme to split up Elena and Christopher. Furious, Christopher files for divorce, swears to take the kids away from her, and reveals the truth to everyone. Meanwhile, Elena accepts John Ross's marriage proposal, after he and Christopher decide to bury the hatchet and work together, merging Ewing Oil and Christopher's methane energy business as Ewing Energies. However, she overhears John Ross' lies and schemes and breaks off their engagement. Elena and Christopher get engaged again, realizing they should never have split up. They end up having sex, which angers John Ross, and he schemes to ruin their lives. Elena and Christopher continue their relationship, and decide to have a church wedding once Christopher has annulled his marriage to Pamela. Elena's elder brother, Drew (short for Andres) comes back to town, no longer the criminal he once was. However, John Ross makes it look like he smuggled stolen Mexican goods into the US, and Drew is arrested. Because of this, Elena's shares of Ewing Energies are invalidated and given to Sue Ellen. Upset, Elena, Bobby, and Christopher decide to get revenge on the mother-son duo. Elena is also surprised to learn that Pamela is sleeping with John Ross. Reception American blogger and television personality Perez Hilton said, \\"Good casting choice! Patrick Duffy and Linda Gray will also reprise the roles they made famous on the '80s soap. Larry Hagman has verbally committed to the project, but has yet to sign a deal. This show already sounds scadalicious! Can't wait to check it out!\\" After the show aired, Ken Tucker of Entertainment Weekly wrote: \\"The new TNT version of Dallas that premiered on TNT on Wednesday night is a rare example of an artistically ‚Äì well, entertainingly, at least ‚Äî successful TV-classic update. It was all the more impressive for the way it combined members of the original cast with younger-demo-actor draws without quite seeming as cynical as a J.R. Ewing business deal.\\" Tucker concludes: \\"And overall, Dallas is a solidly constructed soap opera, with strong wooden dialogue and oily plot twists.\\" References Category:Television characters introduced in 2012 Category:Fictional characters from Texas Category:Dallas (TV franchise) characters Category:Fictional female engineers ","title":"Elena Ramos"},{"id":"35464846","text":"Amirabad-e Kolahchi (, also Romanized as Amƒ´rƒÅbƒÅd-e KolƒÅhchƒ´ and Amƒ´rƒÅbƒÅd-e KolƒÅchƒ´) is a village in Akhtarabad Rural District, in the Central District of Malard County, Tehran Province, Iran.

Mauti (born January 19, 1990) is a former American football linebacker. He played college football at Penn State and was drafted by the Minnesota Vikings in the seventh round of the 2013 NFL Draft. He has also played for the New Orleans Saints. Early years Mauti was born in New Orleans, Louisiana. He played high school football at Mandeville High School for Coach Guy LeCompte in Mandeville, Louisiana. He amassed 121 tackles, four quarterback sacks, two forced fumbles, and two interceptions returned for touchdowns his senior season. He was ranked as the No. 3 inside linebacker prospect in the nation and was among ESPN.com's Top 150 recruits, and was also a top 20 linebacker by Rivals.com. Mauti was invited to play in the 2008 U.S. Army All-American Bowl. In track & field, Mauti competed as a sprinter. At the 2007 Allstate Sugar Bowl T& Classic, he ran the 200 meters in 23.24 seconds and ran the fourth leg on the 4 √ó 100m squad, ending with a time of 45.96 seconds.http://www.sugarbowltrackclassic.com/forms/2007results.html He recorded a personal-best time of 6.93 seconds in the 55 meters at the LSU High School Qualifier and helped lead his 4 √ó 200m team to a twelfth-place finish with a time of 1:36.13 minutes.http://www.lsusports.net/fls/5200/trackstats/07hsqualify/070127F010.htm College career Mauti graduated from high school early and enrolled at Pennsylvania State University in January 2008, where he would play for the Penn State Nittany Lions football team from 2008 to 2012. His extra time with the team paid dividends, with Mauti contributing on defense and special teams right away. He was one of three true freshmen on the team to play in every game, and finished the 2008 season with 26 tackles and a forced fumble. He would make an appearance in the Nittany Lions' 2009 Rose Bowl loss, and received the team's Jim O'Hora Award, presented to the defense's most improved player during spring practice. Mauti tore the anterior cruciate ligament in his right knee during summer practice, forcing him to take a medical redshirt for the 2009 season. Mauti was highly productive in 2010, despite battling through nagging injuries. He finished the season with 67 tackles, two sacks, and a pass breakup. He was named Big Ten Conference Co-Defensive Player-of- the-Week on November 6, recording 11 tackles against Northwestern. Mauti left the game versus Ohio State in the second quarter with a shoulder injury, and was limited for the rest of the season until playing 59 snaps versus Florida in the 2011 Outback Bowl. Heading into the 2011 season, Mauti was poised for a breakout year. He was named to Athlon Sports' pre-season All-America team and Phil Steele's pre-season All-Big Ten teams, as well as the Bronko Nagurski Trophy and Butkus Award watch lists. But Mauti again tore an anterior cruciate ligament‚Äîthis time in his left knee‚Äîin Penn State's fourth game of the season against Eastern Michigan and was lost for the rest of the year. Mauti came back for the 2012 season and during the first four games, Mauti recorded a total of forty tackles. During Week 5 against Illinois, Mauti recorded two interceptions including one which he returned 99 yards, but was stopped at the one yard line with one second to play in the half. Despite missing the last game of the season, due to a third torn ACL, Mauti was named first team All- Big Ten, first team All-American, and won the Butkus-Fitzgerald Award for best Big Ten linebacker. Professional career =Minnesota Vikings= Mauti was drafted by the Minnesota Vikings in the seventh round, 213th overall of the 2013 NFL Draft. The Vikings also selected fellow Penn State linebacker Gerald Hodges in the fourth round, reuniting the teammates in the NFL. He played for the Vikings for two years, primarily on special teams, before being cut at the end of training camp in 2015. =New Orleans Saints= The Saints claimed Mauti off waivers after Minnesota released him. On October 15, 2015, in a Thursday Night Football game against the Atlanta Falcons, Mauti blocked a Matt Bosher punt and returned it for a touchdown. The block was widely compared to a famous punt block made by Saints safety Steve Gleason in a 2006 game against Atlanta, in the Saints' first home game after a year in exile in the wake of Hurricane Katrina. This was especially so because Gleason was present and received an award at the 2015 game, while Mauti himself had attended the 2006 game in person. Mauti had been dealing with the effects of ulcerative colitis and required surgery that would require him to miss the rest of the 2016 season. He was placed on the non-football injury list on November 15, 2016. On July 24, 2017, Mauti re-signed with the Saints on a one-year deal. He was released on September 2, 2017. He was re-signed on October 17, 2017. On April 5, 2018, Mauti re-signed with the Saints on a one-year contract. He was released on May 16, 2018. Personal life Mauti is the son of Rich Mauti, who played wide receiver at Penn State in 1975 and 1976, and in the National Football League for the New Orleans Saints (1977‚Äì1983) and Washington Redskins (1984). His brother Patrick was a wide receiver for the Nittany Lions from 2005 to 2009. Mauti earned his degree in crime, law and justice from Penn State in December 2011.

History The plaza seen in the bottom right corner on a map detail from 1772 Sankt Thomas Plads traces its history back to the years between 1700 and 1704 when Frederiksberg All√© was established as a driveway connecting the gardens at Frederiksberg Palace, the new royal summer retreat outside Copenhagen. For long the small plaza had no official name but it became Colloquially known as the Small Circle (Danish: Den Lille Runddel) as opposed to Frederiksberg Runddel, the Grand Circle, at the other end of the avenue. Etablissement Sankt Thomas.png Albert Heinrich Riise, the first pharmacist on Saint Thomas in the Danish West Indies, bought a country house at the site in around 1868, renaming it Sankt Thomas after the island where he had lived for the past thirty years. When the villa after Riise's death in 1882 was sold, it was transformed into an entertainment venue by the same name. This gave rise to the name Sankt Thomas Plads. The country house was demolished in 1903 but its name was transferred to the residential building which was built in its place in 1905. The name was officially adopted on 2 June 2003. Sankt Thomas has had its round shape ever since its establishment in the beginning of the 18th century. Its current design dates mostly from a refurbishment which took place in 1932 in connection with the 75-year anniversary of Frederiksberg Municipality. Memorial fountains Two memorial fountains were installed on the plaza in connection with the refurbishment in 1922. They were designed by the architect A.S.K. Lauritzen and bear various inscriptions which commemorate the history of Frederiksbeerg and are each topped by a bronze figure designed by the Hungarian-born sculptor Jen√∂ Meister. One of them depicts a Dutch woman, representing the Dutch farmers who were relocated to the area from Amager by King Frederick II in the middle of the 17th century. The other depicts a falconer to commemorate Falkonerg√•rden, the royal falconry farm which was in use until 1810 and is also heralded in the three falcons seen in Frederiksberg's coat of arms.

UNAIDS estimate there are 46,630 sex workers in the country. Many have turned to prostitution because of poverty. Some Nigerian prostitutes ply their trade on the Niger border as many prostitutes are persecuted in their homeland and Niger is perceived as being more amiable and less likely to prosecute them for their trade. Nigerian men prefer to cross the border to seek sex as the punishment in Islamic Nigeria is 50 lashes for \\"procuration of woman\\". In 2017 the government ordered a clampdown on prostitution throughout the country. HIV HIV is a problem in the country. Preventative measures, including distribution of condoms have seen prevalence rates fall in recent years. Sex workers are one of the high risk groups. In 2016 UNAIDS estimated there was a 17% prevalence rate amongst sex workers. Sex trafficking Niger is a source, transit, and destination country for women and children subjected to sex trafficking. Victims from Benin, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Ghana, Mali, Nigeria, and Togo are exploited in sex trafficking in Niger. Corrupt marabouts or loosely organised clandestine networks may also place Nigerien girls into commercial sex. Nigerien girls are subjected to sex trafficking along the border with Nigeria, sometimes with the complicity of their families. In the Tahoua region of Niger, some girls in forced marriages may be exploited in commercial sex after fleeing these nominal unions. In Algeria, Nigerien women and girls were vulnerable to sex trafficking. Nigerien women and children are recruited from Niger and transported to Nigeria, North Africa, the Middle East, and Europe where they are subjected to sex trafficking. Some migrants were suspected to be traffickers, particularly Nigerien migrants to Algeria. Traffickers operated primarily small, freelance operations in loosely organised networks of individuals, including some marabouts. There have been reports of freelance business people (both men and women) and informal travel agencies that recruit women to the Middle East or to northern Nigeria for sex trafficking. Niger is a transit country for women and children from West and Central Africa migrating to North Africa and Western Europe, where some are subjected to sex trafficking. In some instances, law enforcement and border officials have accepted bribes from traffickers to facilitate the transportation of victims through the country. The United States Department of State Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons ranks Niger as a 'Tier 2 Watch List' country.

Early life Oswald Short was born at Stanton by Dale, Ilkeston, Derbyshire, the son of mining engineer Samuel Short and his second wife Emma Robinson. In 1897, he took an intense interest in ballooning, after his brother Eustace Short had purchased, repaired and flown a second- hand gas balloon. The two brothers formed a partnership to design and manufacture balloons for fairground businesses, and made a joint visit to the 1900 Paris Exposition ('World's Fair'). There, they were inspired by the perfectly spherical balloons made by √âdouard Surcouf of Soci√©t√© Astra, and they then modified their own design accordingly. In 1901, the two brothers constructed their first balloon, capacity 33,000 cu.ft, in premises above the laboratory of their brother Horace Short, in Hove, Sussex. In 1902, the balloon made successful flights, and in the same year Oswald and Eustace moved their enterprise to London. The pair made and sold gas-filled observation balloons, for customers including the government of India. In 1906, they moved their business again, to railway arches at Battersea, and flew balloons from Battersea gas works, including some passenger-carrying flights over London. Via contacts in the War Office and in the Aero Club of Great Britain (later Royal Aero Club), they went on to produce balloons of various designs for many notable people and events, up to and including the First World War.Bruce 2004Barnes 1967, pp. 1-6 In 1908, Aero Club members including Charles Rolls, described accounts of the Wright Brothers' demonstrations of their aircraft at Le Mans in France. Oswald Short reportedly said to Eustace \\"This is the finish of ballooning: we must begin building aeroplanes at once, and we can't do that without Horace!\\" Oswald succeeded in persuading Horace to join them, and in November 1908 they registered their partnership under the name Short Brothers. They soon started building two aeroplanes, for Charles Rolls and for Francis McClean, then they established an additional factory at Leysdown, Isle of Sheppey, later relocated to Eastchurch. In early 1909, Short Brothers signed an agreement with the Wright brothers to manufacture copies of Wright Flyers for sale under licence, and thus became the World's first aircraft manufacturer.Barnes 1967, pp. 6-10 Oswald continued his interest in balloons and airships, and developed his own ideas about leak-tight inflatable envelopes for balloons, airships and the floats of seaplanes, particularly the use of goldbeater's skin. In 1913, he took charge of a new factory at Rochester, for the production of seaplanes and to enable them to fly from the River Medway. In 1916, he established another factory at Cardington, Bedfordshire, for the production of airships; in 1917, that was nationalised. In April 1917, Oswald assumed overall responsibility for the design of Short Brothers aircraft, following the death of Horace Short. In 1919, Oswald became chairman and managing director of the partnership then incorporated as Short Brothers (Rochester and Bedford) Ltd. He developed construction methods using aluminium alloys such as Duralumin, and in 1920 he patented monocoque and stressed skin aircraft construction techniques. In 1924, he applied the technology to flying boat designs to replace wooden structures that were prone to deterioration. His technology was licensed in the United States, France, and Japan. In the 1920s, Short Brothers manufactured thousands of lightweight bodies for omnibuses, until Oswald's monocoque and stressed skin methods became more widely acceptable to aircraft customers.Barnes 1967, pp. 9-19 In April 1932, Oswald became the sole survivor of the three founders of Short Brothers, after Eustace Short died of heart failure while landing the Short Mussel seaplane. In 1935, Oswald was made chairman and managing director of Short Brothers when it became a limited company. Also in 1935, Oswald married Violet Louise Blackburn.Barnes 1967, p. 21 Later life In 1943, and in poor health, he resigned his posts when the company was nationalised, but accepted the honorary title of life president. He then retired, and settled at Linchmere. He had not sought personal renown from the establishment or the public, but was recognised in the aerospace industry; he was made an honorary fellow of the RAeS (Royal Aeronautical Society), president of the Guild of Aviation Artists, a fellow of the Zoological Society of London and of the Royal Astronomical Society. He was also freeman of the City of London, and honorary freeman of the City of Rochester. On 4 December 1969, Oswald Short died at home at Linchmere, Sussex. In 1998, Short was inducted into the International Air & Space Hall of Fame at the San Diego Air & Space Museum.Sprekelmeyer, Linda, editor. These We Honor: The International Aerospace Hall of Fame.

Origins Haitian culture and French and Haitian Creole languages, first entered Cuba with the arrival of Haitian immigrants at the start of the 19th century. Haiti was a French colony, and the final years of the 1791-1804 Haitian Revolution brought a wave of French settlers fleeing with their Haitian slaves to Cuba. They came mainly to the east, and especially Guantanamo, where the French later introduced sugar cultivation, constructed sugar refineries and developed coffee plantations. By 1804, some 30,000 French were living in Baracoa and Mais√≠, the furthest eastern municipalities of the province. Haitian immigrant workers (1912-1939) Due to the United States occupation of Haiti, many Haitians left to find work as laborers in neighboring countries like Cuba. These immigrants lived a fine line trying to maintain their Haitian culture and assimilating enough to be able to work and live in a foreign society. In 1937, over 25,000 Haitians were forcibly removed from Cuba and sent back to Haiti.Marc C. McLeod, \\"Undesirable Aliens: Race, Ethnicity, and Nationalism in the Comparison of Haitian and British West Indian Workers in Cuba, 1912-1939.\\" Journal of Social History (1998): 599-614., 599 This different treatment of migrant laborers is due to several factors. Cuban racists beliefs combined with economic concerns were a direct catalyst for this drastic Haitian exodus.McLeod, 603 =Revolution= Cubans feared a reply of the Haitian Revolution, which was not quelled by the current guerrilla warfare in Haiti by the caco forces against the Americans. Similarly, black Haitians were stereotyped as being violent and rife with crime,McLeod, 601 as the subject of stereotypes wasn't uncommon in Cuba, as black Cubans are often stereotyped the same way. =Religion= Haitian practice of vodou, was often mistaken for \\"witchcraft.\\"McLeod, 602 =Language= The vast majority of Haitians spoke Haitian Creole, which created a language barrier forcing Haitians to remain in agricultural labor.McLeod, 607 =Housing practices= Haitians lived in small communities near the sugar cane plantations, very rural and removed from populous cities.McLeod, 609 =Education= Economic restraints amongst Haitians kept education informal and contained in their small communities, as such, very few of these Haitians had anything above a basic level of Creole literacy. This enabled Haitians to keep control over the cultural values their children received. =Haitian religion= Majority of Haitians are Catholic but vodou is also present behind the scenes. Vodou is decentralized and flexible. The rituals involved in vodou strengthen community ties and help the oppressed Haitians deal with their suffering.McLeod, 610 Recent years Haitians have continued to come to Cuba to work as braceros (hand workers, from the Spanish word brazo, meaning \\"arm\\") in the fields cutting cane. Their living and working conditions were not much better than slavery. Although they planned to return to Haiti, most stayed on in Cuba. For years, many Haitians and their descendants in Cuba did not identify themselves as such or speak Creole. In the eastern part of the island, many Haitians continued to suffer discrimination. But according to the Fidel Castro regime, since 1959, when he took over, this discrimination has stopped.\\"Haiti in Cuba\\", AfroCubanWeb After Spanish, Haitian Creole is the second most-spoken language in Cuba where over 300,000 recent Haitian immigrants speak it. It is recognized as a language in Cuba and a considerable number of Cubans speak it fluently. Most of these speakers have never been to Haiti and do not possess Haitian ancestry, but merely learned it in their communities. In addition to the eastern provinces, there are also communities in Ciego de √Åvila and Camag√ºey provinces where the population still maintains Creole, their mother tongue. Classes in Creole are offered in Guantanamo, Matanzas and the City of Havana. There is a Creole- language radio program.Haiti in Cuba.

More generally, one can define the Hessian pair of any triple of elements from a set that can be identified with a projective line, such as a rational curve, a pencil of divisors, a pencil of lines, and so on. Definition If {A, B, C} is a set of 3 distinct points of the projective line, then the Hessian pair is a set {P,Q} of two points that can be defined by any of the following properties: *P and Q are the roots of the Hessian of the binary cubic form with roots A, B, C. *P and Q are the two points fixed by the unique projective transformation taking A to B, B to C, and C to A. *P and Q are the two points that when added to A, B, C form an equianharmonic set (a set of 4 points with cross-ratio a cube root of 1). *P and Q are the images of 0 and ‚àû under the projective transformation taking the three cube roots of 1 to A, B, C.

The official name of the camp is Kyo-hwa-so No. 4 (Reeducation camp no. 4). The camp consists of a large prison compound situated between Samdung-ri and the Nam River, in Kangdong-gun, in South Pyongan province of North Korea, about east of downtown Pyongyang. The main section of the camp is around long and wide, surrounded by a high wall. The whole camp is roughly long by wide, surrounded by a barbed-wire fence. In 1997 there used to be around 7,000 prisoners. Most of them are either soldiers or residents of Pyongyang, sentenced from 5 to 20 years. Working facilities include a cement factory, a coal mine, a limestone quarry, a glass factory and some agriculture.  Human rights situation  According to a former prisoner, an average of 500 prisoners die annually, mostly due to waterborne illnesses. Another former prisoner reported high death rates due to work accidents, malnutrition, and disease. Seriously ill prisoners are sent home on sick leave to reduce the apparent number of deaths in detention. In the limestone quarries the prisoners have to do hard labor in hazardous conditions, with prisoners often receiving or sustaining chest ailments and lung diseases from limestone dust. Moreover, as the prisoners are rarely allowed to wash their faces, many suffer from skin abrasions and infections. Prisoners live in unsanitary conditions; they sleep on the floor in groups of 50 to 100 people, without bathing or changing their clothes. Food rations consist of only 50 g (2 oz) of corn and wheat and some cabbage soup per meal and all prisoners are seriously underweight. A former prisoner witnessed eight public executions during the eight months he was held in the camp. Rule violations are punished with reduced rations, extended sentences, and detainment in very small punishment cells. There is a criticism session every week, in which the prison officials criticize prisoners in front of a large group of prisoners.

History  Statue of La Rep√∫blica at El Capitolio, 15 metres high, sculpted in 1929 by Italian Angelo Zanelli After Cristoforo Colombo (Italian from Genoa), accidentally found Cuba in 1492, the first Italians arrived with the Spanish conquistadores. Some were sailors and soldiers of fortune but most were missionaries. In 1605 shipwrecked Italian sailors founded the city of Mantua, Cuba in the far west of the island.Mantua, an Italian footprint in Cuba (en ingles) These sailors came from the Genoa and Venice areas.En los registros de las parroquias de Mantua se encuentran los apellidos Ferrari, Pitaluga, Fiorenzana y otros.\\"Italianos en Mantua\\". Bohemia, a.87, n.10, 14 mayo 1995, pp.18-19. The Royal Decree of Graces (Real C√©dula de Gracias) which was originated August 10, 1815 by the Spanish Crown, was issued with the intention of attracting European settlers who were not of Spanish origin to populate what would be the two remaining colonies of the Spanish Empire: Puerto Rico and Cuba. Despite their small numbers, many Italian Cubans reached high positions in Cuban society. For example, Juan Bautista Spotorno (son of a lauded Italian family resident in Trinidad, Cuba) became a Cuban patriot and the president of the \\"Republic in Arms\\" in 1876. Italians fought and some of them died for Cuba in the first tentative for independence from Spain: in Las Tunas died in those years the Sicilian journalist Achille Aviles and later was killed the \\"garibaldino\\" Natalio Argenta. Only in the mid-19th century did there develop a small Italian community in Cuba: they were mostly people of culture, architects, engineers, painters and artists and their families. They were called to Cuba to work in the development of the churches, monuments and government buildings in Havana. In 1884 these first Italian Cubans (who were nearly 3,000) founded the \\"Sociedad de Socorro Mutuo\\" (Society of Mutual Aid) and in 1891 the \\"Sociedad de Beneficiencia\\" to help the neediest among them. At the beginning of the 20th century socialist associations were formed but these were strongly opposed with the Catholic-aligned authorities. Some Italian Cubans participated actively in the Cuban War of Independence, such as Oreste Ferrara editor of the national El Heraldo de Cuba newspaper.Biograf√≠a de Oreste Ferrara Black Political Activism and the Cuban Republic, Melina Pappademos, p.153 Indeed, in April 1898, a group of 75 Italian volunteers the most important volunteers were Oreste Ferrara, Alfonso Cancellieri, Francesco Lenci, Ugo Ricciand Francesco Pagliughi sailed to Cuba with some money obtained from subscription in Italy: their leader was coronel Francesco Federico Falco, who fought bravely under general Antonio Maceo and was named \\"commander\\" of the Health Corp in the Liberation Army of Cuba. Falco later founded the magazine ‚ÄúLa Cultura Latina‚Äù in la Habana, the first literary introduction of socialism in South America (it was widely popular in Venezuela and Argentina) and in Cuba. It was the first magazine that promoted in the Cuban society the philosophical ideals that were developed later in the Fidel Castro revolution. In the beginning years of the 20th century many Italians living in Cuba decided to move to the United States, because of the better economic situation, while someone returned to Italy and others decided to accept the \\"naturalization\\" offered by the Cuban authorities. In 1931, according to the Cuban census, there were only 1,178 people with an Italian passport in Cuba and to them must be added about 15,000 people of Italian origin, many of whom were illegitimate children of an Italian father and Cuban motherFrancesco Tamburini. \\"La colonia italiana di Cuba (1884-1902)\\"(en italiano) Of these Italians, 80 lived in Pinar del R√≠o Province, 129 in Oriente Province, 762 in Havana, 30 in Matanzas Province, 103 in Las Villas Province and 74 in Camag√ºey Province.Angela Oramas Camero. \\"Italianos en Cuba\\", Bohemia, a.89, n.11, 24 mayo 1997, pp.24-25 President Alberto Herrera Franchi In 1933 was President of Cuba for a brief period of time the general Alberto Herrera Franchi, whose mother was Italian. During World War II, Italy and Cuba broke off diplomatic relations and some Italian Cubans were jailed accused of sympathizing with Mussolini's Italy. In 1941, nine such Italians were jailed on Isla de Pinos (now called Isla de la Juventud; they were: Principe Camillo Ruspoli (rancher), Doctor Attilio di Gregorio (physician), Francesco Savonelli (businessman), Felice Siervo (jeweller), Erminio Tarditi (businessman), Bruni Pasquale (shoemaker), Doctor Pasquale Fontanella (physician), Francesco Grosso (tailor) y Piero Rosbochi (businessman).

Wunstorf Air Base is the home to Air Transport Wing 62 (Lufttransportgeschwader 62), a unit operating all German Airbus A400M Atlas. History The airfield was opened in 1936 for the German Luftwaffe reconstituted by the National Socialist government in 1935. During the Second World War, it was seized by the British Army on 7 April 1945, in a fierce battle by elements of the 5th Parachute Brigade, 6th Airborne Division. During the battle, in which the 13th Battalion was also engaged, the 7th (Light Infantry) Parachute Battalion lost six killed, and 21 wounded, most from the initial ambush of the four leading trucks of B Company. The airfield was captured with 19 Bf 109s, four Fw 190s, two Ju 88s, two Ju 52s and much other valuable equipment. After the battle, the base was taken over by the Royal Air Force, including Canadian (R.C.A.F.) Wing 126 of the British 2nd Tactical Air Force, and designated as Advanced Landing Ground B-116 Wunstorf. The airfield features heavily in the book \\"13 - Lucky For Some\\" which is about the history of the 13th (Lancashire) Parachute Battalion. There are many then and now photographs as well as maps and diagrams of battles that took place in the region. It was later designated RAF Station Wunstorf and used by Royal Air Force Germany. RAF units assigned were: * 1947-1950: 2 Sq with Spitfire F 14/PR 19 * 1950-1952: 4 Sq, 26 Sq with Vampire FB 5 * 1950-1955: 11 Sq with Vampire FB 5, later Venom FB 1, later FB 4 * 1952-1955: 5 Sq with Vampire FB 5, later Venom FB 1 * 1952-1955: 266 Sq with Vampire FB 5, later FB 9, later Venom FB 1 * 1954: 4 Sq * 1954: 93 Sq * 1955-1956: 79 Sq with Meteor FR 9 * 1955-1957: 541 Sq with Meteor PR 10 * 1956-1957: 5 Sq, 11 Sq, 266 Sq with Venom FB 4 Much of the 1951 novel Air Bridge by Hammond Innes is set in RAF Wunstorf at the time of the Berlin Airlift. The novel contains descriptions of how the airfield, rapidly expanded for the Airlift, looked at that time. The then-RAF Wunstorf also featured in the 1957 film \\"High Flight\\". Also in 1957, the airfield returned to the control of the German Air Force and became a NATO Air Base. Use by German Air Force A German Air Force Transall C-160D transport aircraft (s/n 50+38) of Air Transport Wing 62 (LTG 62) based at Wunstorf Air Base, in flight on 15 June 1983 German Air Force first stationed Nord Noratlas which by 1971 were replaced by C-160D Transall; those were disbanded from the local LTG62 in July 2015, now focussing on accepting and integrating Airbus A400M Atlas. Flight training for decades was executed using Dornier Do 28. Motorsport Between 1964 and 1998, a temporary motor racing circuit was laid out on the Wunstorf airbase. Races at the circuit were included in the German Touring Car Championship between 1984 and 1993,https://archive.fo/20130122054529/http://www.dtm.com/statistik- strecke.php?strecke=Wunstorf one of several temporary airfield tracks on the DTM calendar at the time. The series eventually began to move towards permanent racing facilities and the final DTM race at Wunstorf took place in 1993, where Nicola Larini set a lap record of 1:44.45 in his Alfa Romeo during qualifying. In 1977, the Wunstorf circuit was first used for a round of the Interserie sports car racing championship. Wunstorf hosted the Interserie between 1977 and 1979, and again between 1985 and 1990. Besides the big-name national championships, Wunstorf hosted a series of annual club racing meetings until 1999, when motor racing on the airbase premises was finally halted due to the cost of preparation and administration for the events. Expansion in 2010's As preparation for 40 Airbus A400M Atlas to be stationed at Wunstorf Air Base, the airbase underwent (and as of February 2016 still undergoes) major expansion. Runway 08/26 was lengthened from 1,877 m to 2,499 m (45 m wide) mainly to the east. Parking positions were expanded, one maintenance hangar has been erected, another one is under construction. A building to house the flight simulator has been added.

In general, electrospinning can be performed using either polymer melts or polymer solutions. However, melt electrospinning is distinct in that the collection of the fiber can very focused; combined with moving collectors, melt electrospinning writing is a way to perform 3D printing. Since volatile solvents are not used, there are benefits for some applications where solvent toxicity and accumulation during manufacturing are a concern.  History  The first description of melt electrospinning was by Charles Norton in a patent approved in 1936. After this first discovery, it wasn't until 1981 that melt electrospinning was described as part of a three-paper series. A meeting abstract on melt electrospinning in a vacuum was published by Reneker and Rangkupan 20 years later in 2001.R. Rangkupan, D. H. Reneker, in New Frontiers in Fiber-Based Products, The Fiber Society, Raleigh, NC, USA, 2001. Since this scientific publication in 2001, there have been regular articles on melt electrospinning, including reviews on the subject.Hutmacher DW & Dalton PD (2011) Melt Electrospinning. Chem Asian J, 6, 44-5. In 2011, melt electrospinning combined with a translating collector was with proposed as a new class of 3D printing.Brown TD, Dalton PD, Hutmacher DW. (2011) Direct Writing by Way of Melt Electrospinning. Advanced Materials, 23, 5651-57.  Principles  The same physics of electrostatic fiber drawing apply to melt electrospinning. What differs are the physical properties of the polymer melt, compared to a polymer solution. When comparing polymer melts and polymer solutions, the former are normally more viscous than polymer solutions, and elongated electrified jets have been reported.Dalton PD, Grafahrend D, Klinkhammer K, Klee D, M√∂ller M (2007) Electrospinning of polymer melts: phenomenological observations. Polymer, 48, 6823-6833. The molten electrified jet also requires cooling to solidify, while solution electrospinning relies on evaporation. While melt electrospinning typically results in micron diameter fibers, the path of the electrified jet in melt electrospinning can be predictable.Dalton PD, Vaquette C, Farrugia B, Dargaville TR, Brown TD, Hutmacher DW. (2013) Electrospinning and Additive manufacturing: converging technologies. Biomater Sci, 1, 171.  Parameters  = Temperature = A minimum temperature is needed to ensure a molten polymer, all the way to the tip of the spinneret. Spinnerets have a relatively short length, compared to solution electrospinning. = Flow Rate = The most significant parameter for controlling the fiber diameter is the flow rate of the polymer to the spinneret - in general, the higher the flow rate, the larger the fiber diameter. While reported flow rates are low, all of the fluid electrospun is collected, unlike solution electrospinning where a great part of the solvent is evaporated. = Molecular Weight = The molecular weight is important as to whether the polymer can be melt electrospun. For linear homogeneous polymers, a low molecular weight (below 30,000g/mol) can result in broken and poor quality fibers.Dalton PD, Calvet J-L, Mourran A, Klee D, M√∂ller M (2006) Melt Electrospinning of poly(ethylene oxide-block-Œµ-caprolactone). Biotechnol J, 1, 998-1006. For high molecular weights (above 100,000 g/mol), the polymer can be very difficult to flow through the spinneret. Many melt electrospun fibers reported use molecular weights between 40,000 and 80,000 g/mol or are blends of low and high molecular weight polymers.Dalton PD, J√∂rgensen N, Groll J, M√∂ller M (2008) Patterning of melt electrospun substrates for tissue engineering. Biomed Mater, 3, 034139. = Voltage = Modifying the voltage does not greatly effect the resulting fiber diameter, however it has been reported that an optimum voltage is needed to make high quality and consistent fibers. Voltages from as low as 0.7kV up to 60kV have been used to melt electrospin.C. S. Kong, K. J. Jo, N. K. Jo, H. S. Kim, Polymer Engineering and Science 2009, 49, 391R. J. Deng, Y. Liu, Y. M. Ding, P. C. Xie, L. Luo, W. M. Yang, Journal of Applied Polymer Science 2009, 114, 166.  Apparatus  Different melt electrospinning machines have been built, with some mounted vertically and some horizontally. The approach to heating the polymer does vary and includes electrical heaters, heated air and circulating heaters. One approach to melt electrospinning is pushing a solid polymer filament into a laser, which melts and is electrospun.  Polymers  Polymers exhibiting a melting point or glass transition temperature (Tg) are required for melt electrospinning, excluding thermosets (such as bakelite) and biologically derived polymers (such as collagen).

These polymers are examples of the most used polymers, and a more comprehensive list can be found elsewhere.  Uses  Potential applications of melt electrospinning mirror that of solution electrospinning. Not using solvents to process a polymer assists in tissue engineering applications where solvents are often toxic. Additionally, some polymers such as polypropylene or polyethylene are not readily dissolved, so melt electrospinning is one approach to electrospin them into fibrous material. = Tissue Engineering = Melt electrospinning is used to process biomedical materials for tissue engineering research. Volatile solvents are often toxic so avoiding solvents has benefits in this field. Melt electrospun fibers were used as part of a \\"bimodal tissue scaffold\\", where both micron-scale and nano- scale fibers were deposited simultaneously. Scaffolds made via melt electrospinning can be fully penetrated with cells, which in turn produce extracellular matrix within the scaffold.Farrugia B, Brown TD, Hutmacher DW, Upton Z, Dalton PD, Dargaville TR. (2013) Dermal fibroblast infiltration of poly(Œµ‚Äìcaprolactone) scaffolds fabricated by melt electrospinning in a direct writing mode. Biofabrication 5, 025001. = Drug Delivery = Melt electrospinning is also capable to formulate drug-loaded fibers for drug delivery. It is a promising new formulation technique in the field of pharmaceutical technology to prepare amorphous solid dispersions or solid solutions with enhanced or controlled drug dissolution because it can combine the advantages of melt extrusion (e.g. solvent-free, effective amorphization, continuous process) and solvent-based electrospinning (increased surface area). = Melt Electrospinning Writing = The electrified molten jet created via melt electrospinning has a more predictable path, and polymer fibers can be deposited accurately onto the collector. When the collector is moved at sufficient speed (referred to as the critical translation speed), straight melt electrospun fibers can be deposited in a layer upon layer approach. This enables for the fabrication of complex, well-ordered structures. In this respect melt electrospinning writing (MEW) can be considered a class of 3D printing. Melt electrospinning writing has been performed using either a translating flat surface or a rotating cylinder/mandrel . Most polymers that can be melt-electrospun can also be written assuming the parameters can be tuned in such a way as to produce a stable jet. Piezoelectric polymers such as polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) have also been shown to be processable via MEW, opening up potential applications in 3d printed sensors, soft robotics, and further applications in biofabrication .

Related activities such as soliciting and brothel keeping are illegal. Botswana has made proposals to make prostitution legal to prevent the spread of AIDS. However, there has been mass opposition to it by the Catholic Church. Prostitution is widespread and takes place on the street, bars, hotels, brothels and the cabs of long-distance trucks. Law enforcement is weak, inconsistent and corrupt. Sex workers report routine violence and extortion by the police. Police sometimes demand sex or bribes from foreign prostitutes under threat of deportation. Condoms are issued free from health centres, but are often confiscated from sex workers by the police. The Gaborone West shopping complex and the streets surrounding it, are the main area of prostitution in the capital, Gaborone. The Itekeng ward of Francistown (locally known as 'Doublers') is the main area of prostitution in the city. The majority of the prostitutes in both cities are from Zimbabwe. In 2013, the Botswana's Ministry of Health estimated there were more than 1,500 Zimbabwean sex workers in the country, mainly in Gaborone, Francistown and Kasane, out of a total of about 4,000 prostitutes in those three areas. Although homosexuality is stigmatised in the country, male prostitution is on the increase in Botswana, especially in Gaborone, Palapye, Francistown, Maun, Kasane and Kazungula. Legal situation The following items of the Penal Code of Botswana criminalises, or is used to criminalise, prostitution and related activities: * 90. Offensive conduct conducive to breaches of the peace * 136. Insult to religion of any class * 149. Procuration * 150. Procuring defilement of person by threats or fraud or administering drugs * 153. Detention of persons for immoral purposes * 155. Person living on earnings of prostitution or persistently soliciting * 156. Person aiding, etc. for gain, prostitution * 157.

Spreading infection Section 57 of the 2009 Children's Act makes it a crime to induce, coerce or encourage a child to engage in prostitution, subject to two to five years imprisonment and/or a fine of 50,000 pula ($4,685). The 2014 Anti-Human Trafficking Act criminalises all forms of trafficking, essentially tracking international law and making it a crime to use force, fraud or coercion for the purpose of exploitation. HIV Botswana is experiencing one of the most severe HIV/AIDS epidemics in the world. The national HIV prevalence rate among adults ages 15 to 49 is 24.8 percent, which is the third highest in the world, behind Lesotho and Swaziland. Sex workers are a high risk group. In 2012 it was reported sex workers have an HIV prevalence of 61.9%. Sex workers report that many clients are reluctant to use condoms. Some will pay more for unprotected sex, others use violence. Sex trafficking Botswana is a source, transit, and destination country for women and children subjected to sex trafficking. Residents of Botswana most vulnerable to trafficking are unemployed women, the rural poor, agricultural workers, and children. Botswana girls and women are possibly exploited in prostitution within the country, including in bars and by truck drivers along major highways. Some women may be subjected to trafficking internally or transported from neighbouring countries and subjected to sexual exploitation. Undocumented migrant Zimbabwean children might be vulnerable to trafficking in Botswana. There has been no comprehensive international or domestic study of trafficking trends within the country.

After World War, FIAT created in 1926 a subsidiary devoted exclusively to machine guns, that was the Societa Anonima Fabrica Armi Torino, or anonymous society Torino guns factory, mostly known as its abbreviated S.A.F.A.T designation. The first aircraft machine gun produced by S.A.F.A.T was the M1928, a scaled-up variant of the M1926 with a belt feed and increased rate of fire. However, its main change was the adoption of the 8 mm Fiat cartridge instead the usual M1891 6.5 mm ammunition. Worth to mention that the \\"8mm FIAT\\" designation was in fact a fancy name for the 7.7x56R cartridge (.303 British). Both types were completely interchangeable. The M1928 was installed in some biplane fighters of the late 1920s and early 1930s.

There were fears that the increased demand for prostitutes from the visiting fans would lead to a surge in human trafficking. An anti-trafficking law was passed, and a soccer-based public awareness campaign was run. The spread of STIs and HIV were a concern. The organising committee, LOC, initially tried to have all the prostitutes removed from the cities hosting games, but this did not prove to be practical. In conjunction with the Health Commission in Angola, they distributed 5 million free condoms to bars, hotels and other strategic locations. HIV Angola has a large HIV/AIDS infected population. However, it has one of the lowest prevalence rates in the Southern Africa zone. Sex workers are a high risk group. UNAIDS reported that there was a 4.7% prevalence amongst sex workers in 2016. (The figure amongst the general adult population was 1.9%) The reluctance to use condoms is a contributing factor. In 2016, UNAIDS reported 82.6% condom usage amongst sex workers. Some sex workers charge double for sex without a condom. Another factor is that the many prostitutes that are in the country illegally have no access to health services. Sex trafficking Human traffickers exploit domestic and foreign victims in Angola, and traffickers exploit victims from Angola abroad.Angolan girls as young as 13 years old are victims of sex trafficking. The provinces of Luanda, Benguela, and the border provinces of Cunene, Lunda Norte, Namibe, Uige, and Zaire are the most high-threat areas for trafficking activities. Traffickers exploit Angolan women and children in sex trafficking in South Africa, Namibia, and European countries, including the Netherlands and Portugal. Women from Brazil, Cuba, Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), Namibia, and Vietnam engaged in prostitution in Angola may be victims of sex trafficking. Undocumented Congolese migrants, including children, enter Angola for work in diamond-mining districts, where traffickers exploit some in sex trafficking in mining camps. Trafficking networks recruit and transport Congolese girls as young as 12 years old from Kasai Occidental in the DRC to Angola for sex trafficking. The United States Department of State Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons ranks Angola as a \\"Tier 2 Watch List\\" country.

History An example of a high-low skirt The high-low skirt has a full circle hem. However, the length varies from short in front to long in back. The style originates in Victorian era dresses and formal gowns, when the hem style became known as the \\"fishtail\\". During the 19th century, it became a trend in the mid-1870s, reappearing in the early 1880s, and later in women's formal gowns and evening dresses throughout the 20th century, particularly in the late 1920s and early 1930s, where lowering hemlines were a mask that would start off 1930s silhouettes. The recent high-low skirt hem trend began in late 2011. The high-low skirt became a trend in Europe and America in late 2011, eventually becoming a worldwide fashion in Spring and Summer 2012. It has received fashion press coverage in India, such as in the fashion labels Namrata Joshipura and Myoho, being praised for its \\"playfulness\\". It received widespread visibility outside of fashion circles after The Voice contestant Devyn DeLoera wore a peach-coloured high-low skirt for her audition in summer 2012. The skirt style has been given a variety of names by designers and the press, including asymmetrical and waterfall, with the most common and derisive term being \\"mullet skirt\\", used by Britain's Mirror newspaper in criticising a version worn by singer Cher Lloyd in April 2012, a mocking reference to the now unfashionable mullet hairstyle that was a brief men's fad in the 1980s. However, some high-low dress wearers have embraced the term, referring to their own dress as a mullet dress. Asymmetric peplum trend A related trend in 2011 and 2012 is the asymmetric peplum hem on shirts, sweaters and jackets for women. The peplum, a broad ruffled hem that is fitted at the waist and flares outward, has been a recurring fashion trend in Europe for centuries, and was last popular in Europe and North America during the 1940s and 1950s. An asymmetric version has been brought to women's fashion in 2012, but not all consumers find it flattering, with one American stating, \\"I do not believe it hides large hips and behinds, and the new asymmetrical peplums should only be worn by the tall and thin\\".

It is a joint-use civil- military facility, also being a civil airport. During 1968‚Äì1996, a temporary motor racing circuit was operated on the airfield. Overview Diepholz Air Base was home of 2nd Flying Group of Helicopter Transport Wing 64 from 1968 to 1971. It also housed various logistical units of the German Air Force. History The airfield was originally opened in 1936 for Nazi Germany's Luftwaffe. During World War II, it was seized by the British Army in April 1945. After the battle, the base was over by the Royal Air Force and designated as Advanced Landing Ground B-114 Diepholz. After the war, the airfield was closed. In 1957 the base was returned to the control of the German Air Force and became a NATO Air Base. In October 2011 the German Federal Ministry of Defence announced a reorganisation/reduction of the German Armed Forces. As a consequence, the number of personnel stationed at Diepholz Air Base was reduced from 1,020 to 110, with the airbase facilities being only used as a material storage site.Quoted from , PDF-file \\"Die Stationierung der Bundeswehr in Deutschland\\", passim =Racing circuit = German racing suffered from a lack of permanent circuits after the war, and airfield venues sprang up to bolster events at the N√ºrburgring and Hockenheim. Diepholz was among the most popular and long-lasting. In 1968, the local motorsport-club AMC Diepholz organized the first \\"ADAC-Flugplatzrennen Diepholz\\" on the airfield. The circuit utilised the airfield runways linked by fast chicanes, lined by water-filled oil barrels and tyre stacks. These races soon gathered momentum and in 1972 Diepholz was added to the prestigious DRM touring car championship. Throughout the rest of the 1970s, tin-top stars such as Frank Gardner, Hans Heyer, Toine Hezemans, Helmut Kelleners, Klaus Ludwig and Bob Wollek battled it out in BMWs, Porsches and Fords. In 1998 it was replaced by a new permanent circuit at Oschersleben. References Further reading * Johnson, David C.

He was the first governor of the national territory of Chubut (now Chubut Province) and founder of the city of Formosa. Fontana was born in Buenos Aires on April 19, 1846. His father was an official in the government of Juan Manuel de Rosas. When Fontana was young, his family moved to Carmen de Patagones. At age thirteen, Fontana entered the Military Command of R√≠o Negro as a trainee; he later fought in the Paraguayan War. After the war ended, he lived for a time in Buenos Aires, where he studied natural sciences, astronomy, and physics under Hermann Burmeister. He then returned to the army, and he was deployed on border expeditions exploring the Gran Chaco. During one expedition, he lost his left arm in a violent encounter with an indigenous group in the region. In 1879, Fontana founded the city of Formosa, and he was awarded the rank of lieutenant colonel. He then returned to Patagonia, which he had visited as a child, and in 1884 he was named the first governor of the national territory of Chubut. There he directed the expedition to the west with an exploratory group named the Chubut Riflement (Rifleros del Chubut), which discovered the October 16 Valley (Valle 16 de Octubre), a fertile area in the foothills that would later be the site of the Welsh colony of Trevelin.

Wildman (born 1961) is a contemporary Australian-American philosopher, theologian, and ethicist. Currently, he is a full professor at the Boston University School of Theology, founding member of the faculty of Computing and Data Sciences, and convener of the Religion and Science doctoral program in Boston University's Graduate School.http://people.bu.edu/wwildman/main_about.html He is executive director of The Center for Mind and Culture, founding co-director of the Institute for the Biocultural Study of Religion, and founding co-editor of the journal Religion, Brain & Behavior (published by Taylor & Francis). Wildman‚Äôs academic work has focused on interpreting religion and building theories of religious beliefs, behaviours, and experiences that acknowledge value in longstanding traditions while attempting to remain intellectually viable in light of the biological, cognitive, evolutionary, physical, and social sciences. He is an important figure in the religion and science field, along with scholars such as Robert John Russell, Nancey Murphy, and John Polkinghorne.http://www.issr.org.uk/meet-issr-members/member/?member_id=149 Background Wesley Wildman was born in Adelaide, South Australia, in 1961. He studied mathematics, computer science, and physics at Flinders University, receiving a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1980 and a first-class honours degree in pure mathematics in 1981. After studying divinity at the University of Sydney, he earned a PhD in philosophical theology and the philosophy of religion from the Graduate Theological Union in Berkeley, California, in 1993, at which point he took his current position at Boston University. Currently, he lives in suburban Boston. Career Wildman‚Äôs work initially focused on one religious tradition, Christianity, especially its beliefs. His first book, Fidelity with Plausibility (1998), analysed the plausibility of central Christian beliefs in the context of the contemporary physical and human sciences and the history of encounter with the other religions.Wildman, Wesley. 1998. Fidelity with Plausibility: Modest Christologies in the Twentieth Century. Albany: SUNY Press. Since then, Wildman‚Äôs philosophical and theological goals have broadened as he has attempted to interpret religion as a social, cultural, and evolutionary phenomenon. This broadening has included a longstanding interest in the comparative study of world religious traditions and involvement in a series of publications on interdisciplinary methodology and practice spanning the humanities and sciences as they relate to religion.Neville, Robert C. & Tu Weiming. 2000. Ultimate Realities: A Volume in the Comparative Religious Ideas Project. Albany: SUNY Press. The definitive expression of Wildman's philosophy is his six-volume Religious Philosophy series. The first volume, Religious Philosophy as Multidisciplinary Comparative Inquiry, outlines a program for revitalizing the philosophy of religion by making it consistently comparative‚Äîattending to all human religions rather than advocating on behalf of one favoured tradition‚Äîand massively multidisciplinary, drawing insights from the scientific, social scientific, and humanistic inquiries that bear upon questions in philosophy of religion. Volume two, In Our Own Image, provides a systematic comparative analysis of the relative strengths and weaknesses of three classes of ultimacy models: agential-being models that conceive God as a person with intentions and agency, subordinate-deity models like process theism that conceive God as less than ultimate, and ground-of-being models that eschew theological anthropomorphism and identify God with nature‚Äôs valuational depths. Not yet published, the third volume, Science and Ultimate Reality, will continue the second volume‚Äôs reverent competition between ultimacy models, now focusing on how fundamental physics and biology differentially impact the plausibility of these three ultimacy models. Volume four, Science and Religious Anthropology, considers the impact of contemporary physics and biology upon different religious conceptions of the human person and argues for a religious naturalist theological anthropology that affirms the reality, meaningfulness, and supreme value of human religious quests, while denying that supernatural entities are needed to understand human religiousness. The fifth volume, Religious and Spiritual Experiences, interprets religious and spiritual experiences as intense and profoundly meaningful yet naturalistically grounded in brains and bodies and capable of being enhanced and controlled with a variety of technologies, old and new. Volume six, Effing the Ineffable, explores how we use religious language to make sense of the most profound aspects of human experience and to plumb the mystical depths of reality, conceiving the inconceivable and saying the unsayable. Along with neurologist Patrick McNamara, also at Boston University, Wildman founded the Institute for the Biocultural Study of Religion, an independent scientific research institute that pursues research and public outreach on the scientific study of religious phenomena.http://ibcsr.org/index.php?option=com_content&view;=article&id;=33&Itemid;=71 In 2011, the Institute began publication of Religion, Brain, & Behavior, a peer-reviewed academic journal whose advisory board includes such figures as philosopher Daniel Dennett, religion scholar Ann Taves, sociologist of religion Nancy Ammerman, and many of the leading figures in the scientific study of religion and the cognitive science of religion.http://ibcsr.org/index.php?option=com_content&view;=article&id;=159&Itemid;=89 In 2016, Wildman founded The Center for Mind and Culture, a non-profit research institute that uses computer modelling and data analytics to tackle complex social problems such as child trafficking, religious radicalization, proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, social integration of immigrants and refugees, and many other critical issues arising out of the ‚Äúmind-culture nexus.‚Äù Wildman is also known for pastoral research into ideological differences in Christian denominations, particularly the meaning of the distinctions among liberal, evangelical, and moderate Protestants in the United States. His work has been influenced by such figures as Protestant theologians Friedrich Schleiermacher and Paul Tillich, comparative religion scholar Huston Smith, and philosophers John Searle and Robert Neville. Wildman is a founding member of the International Society for Science and Religion, and a longtime member of the American Theological Society, the American Academy of Religion, and the American Association for the Advancement of Science.

Since then their albums have been released by Sacred Bones Records. History Tres Warren (1978-2020) was born and raised in Texas, where he attended the University of Texas at Austin and met Elizabeth Hart. Formed by Tres Warren, the band made their debut on the Mental Violence label with the single \\"Killers\\" b/w \\"Vice\\" in November 2003. It was followed by the four-track EP Mental Violence II: Diamond City released through The Social Registry in November 2005. It included a remix of the title track by Sonic Boom. These two releases together with two tracks that appeared on separate compilations were collected on Early Violence. Warren later described the beginning of the band as \\"I had just gotten this Roland TR-707 drum machine, and I was getting into programming drums and writing songs.

In 2009 they released Mirror Eye preceded by the single \\"Mantis\\". In the same year they toured as support to the Butthole Surfers and collaborated with Gibby Haynes. Instead of recording a new album, the duo released four EPs of experimental material. The first, Telesthetic Tape, appeared on the Danish Skrot Up label and featured two untitled tracks. It was re-released in 2011 on vinyl. In June 2010 the band released the four-track Catoptric EP through The Social Registry. In the same month the Astral Occurrence EP appeared on the Australian label The Spring Press. Lastly, a remix EP entitled FRKWYS Vol. 4 included contributions by Juan Atkins, Gibby Haynes and Hans-Joachim Irmler. For 2011's Hazed Dream, the band moved to Sacred Bones Records and opted for a more song based approach. Warren explained that \\"it‚Äôs definitely been more writing songs and then recording them\\". In Spring 2013 the band released their fourth album One Track Mind and toured Europe afterwards. The album featured contributions by Neil Hagerty and artwork by Powell St. John. On June 3, 2016, they released their fifth album, a double LP titled Inner Journey Out featuring art by Jonah Freeman and Justin Lowe. Warren died on March 21, 2020, at the age of 41.  Collaborations  Members of Psychic Ills have been involved in various other projects. Elizabeth Hart played bass with Effi Briest and performed with the improvisational dance and music ensemble Skint. Tres Warren collaborated with visual artist Taketo Shimada as Messages and with Drew McDowall of Coil as Compound Eye. Former drummer Brian Tamborello participated in the Boredoms Boadrum projects and played drums on Mike Wexler's record Sun Wheel.

It was recorded inside the Taj Mahal in Agra, India on April 25, 1968 during Horn's visit to produce a documentary about Maharishi Mahesh Yogi and Transcendental Meditation. It features Horn playing solo flute with an unidentified guard of the tombs who provides Hindu chants. The album marks a major stylistic departure for Horn who achieved initial notoriety as a jazz musician, both solo and with his group, the Paul Horn Quintet. Inside became a commercial success, selling over one million copies worldwide and became one of the earliest examples of world fusion and New-age music. In the 1980s, the album was reissued with new artwork as Inside the Taj Mahal. In 1989, to commemorate the album's twentieth anniversary, Horn returned to the Taj Mahal and recorded a sequel, Inside the Taj Mahal II. Background Horn began his professional music career in the 1950s as a jazz flautist and saxophonist and released albums under his own name and his own group, the Paul Horn Quintet. Horn learned to play the flute at age 19, later than he had picked up other instruments. Towards the end of the 1960s, it became the primary instrument that Horn wanted to play. In 1967, Horn decided to pursue a \\"spiritual pilgrimage\\" and became one of the celebrity musicians to accompany The Beatles on their visit to India in February 1968 to complete a Transcendental Meditation course with Maharishi Mahesh Yogi at his ashram in Rishikesh. The trip included a visit to New Delhi where Horn recorded tracks for Paul Horn in Kashmir ‚Äì Cosmic Consciousness and Paul Horn in India ‚Äì Ragas for Flute, Veena, and Violin, two albums that marked a major stylistic departure from Horn's jazz origins. Horn's trip included a visit to the Taj Mahal in Agra. There, he encountered a guard \\"informally standing on duty\\" to protect the tombs. Horn wrote: \\"Quite unexpectedly he bursts forth a vocal 'call' every few minutes to demonstrate the remarkable acoustics emanating from the solid marble dome\\", which produced a 28-second unbroken echo. The sound captured Horn's interest and quickly had the \\"very faint hope that I might have a chance to play even one note in that remarkable chamber.\\" Horn maintained that it was never his intention to record or make an album inside the Taj Mahal, \\"it just happened\\". His original idea was to produce a tape of his flute playing inside the building and play it for himself and some friends. Production =Recording= Interior of the Taj Mahal Shortly after his return to the U.S., Horn became the producer of a documentary film on the Maharishi and Transcendental Meditation which saw him return to India in April 1968. On April 25, during a stop in Agra, he returned to the Taj Mahal assisted by a 14-year-old boy named Sankar, who Horn paid to translate and carry out odd jobs for the crew. Inside, the tomb guard granted Horn permission to return at 8:30 p.m. that evening, one hour before closing time, so he could play the flute when it was less busy. Horn arrived that evening with Sankar, audio engineer John Archer, and photographer Earl Barton. Horn approached the tomb guard, but realised it was not the same one he had previously met. Archer, not knowing this, proceeded to set up the recording equipment which included a microphone and a Nagra portable tape recorder. Initially, the guard told Horn not to play. Horn recalled: \\"'But you sing in here, don't you?' I said. 'I sing to God,' he answered very emphatically. 'Well I play my flute to God,' I said, just as emphatically, and to take [the flute] out of the case and put it together.\\" With his alto flute assembled Horn blew a low C note, which \\"filled the entire room and hung there\\" as the guard \\"stood there transfixed\\". He signalled Archer to start recording and for several minutes, played what ever came to his mind. Upon stopping, Horn found the guard smiling and signalled him to give one of his Hindi calls. At closing time the guard left to do one of his rounds of the building, but allowed Horn and the crew to stay. The opening track, \\"Prologue/Inside\\", features the guard's chants. Horn soon found his arms covered with mosquitoes, but he continued to play. Upon reviewing the recordings at his hotel room, he heard a mosquito fly by the microphone during one of his improvisations. It can be heard around 42 seconds in on \\"Agra\\". A fireworks display as part of a wedding celebration can be heard in the background of \\"Mumtaz Mahal\\". At around 11:00 p.m., all of the recording tape had been used and Horn left. =Signing with Epic= Horn did not consider to release a commercial album with his recordings until he had returned to Los Angeles and played the tape to his friends, who encouraged him to contact record labels and pitch it. The first contact was his friend Richard Bock, the founder of Pacific Jazz Records, who forwarded the album to the marketing man, Massey Lipton. The album was not picked up; Lipton considered its concept too difficult to gain enough radio airplay and suggested the addition of percussion instruments, which Horn refused to do. Bock sided with Lipton, and Horn ended his search for a label. Roughly a year later Horn reunited with his friend Chuck Gregory, by now a director of the A&R; team for Epic Records, and played the album to him. Gregory was immediately enthusiastic, and got head A&R; man David Kapralik in New York City involved, who also liked the album and secured Horn a record deal with Epic. Gregory asked Horn how much his advance for the album was to be. Horn asked for, and received, $5,000. Horn also received a \\"big break\\" on the publishing deal, receiving one hundred per cent of the share. He later noted that he had earned more money from his full share of the publishing rights than from royalties generated from album sales. =Packaging= Horn wished to detail the album's conception in the liner notes, but he could not fit the text on one inner surface. His request for the album to be packaged in a gatefold sleeve, which allowed two inner surfaces, initially caused problems, as the Epic's policy only granted gatefold sleeves for double albums which were sold for $4.99 instead of $3.99 for a standard record. Horn persisted, and avoided the business affairs department in favor of resolving the issue with the head of the label, who granted his request. Initially, Horn wanted a photograph of the Taj Mahal on the front cover, but \\"freaked out\\" when he saw what Epic had decided upon: a close up of his face from the top of his eyes to his chin. Horn expressed greater satisfaction with the design for the album's 1980s reissue by Kuckuck/Celestial Harmonies. Reception Inside earned positive reviews upon release in mid-1969. Bruce Temple for The Courier-Journal considered the Taj Mahal to be \\"one of the most intriguing recording studios in the world\\" because of the album. In a review published in the Pensacola News Journal, Cliff Smith wrote: \\"To hear this LP is to know why Horn was compelled to play in this acoustical wonderland. I've never heard such a sound in my life\\", and praised its \\"intrigue and beauty\\". Gene Lees of High Fidelity called the music \\"serene\\" in a recording that \\"has an incredible ambience, an otherworldly beauty that communicates itself with gentle insistence.\\" In a retrospective review for AllMusic, Jim Brenholts gave the album four-and-a-half stars out of five. He hailed it \\"a classic in the new age community\\" and a \\"masterpiece\\" with Horn's \\"marvelous melodies and deep improvs are matchless, seamless, and timeless\\". In 2001, the BBC reported that the album had sold over one million copies. Track listing All music by Paul Horn. Personnel Credits taken from the album's liner notes.

Lynching was used as a tool to repress African Americans. The anti-lynching movement reached its height between the 1890s and 1930s. The first recorded lynching in the United States was in 1835 in St. Louis, when an accused killer of a deputy sheriff was captured while being taken to jail. The black man named Macintosh was chained to a tree and burned to death. The movement was composed mainly of African Americans who tried to persuade politicians to put an end to the practice, but after the failure of this strategy, they pushed for anti-lynching legislation. African-American women helped in the formation of the movement, and a large part of the movement was composed of women's organizations. The first anti- lynching movement was characterized by black conventions, which were organized in the immediate aftermath of individual incidents. The movement gained wider national support in the 1890s. During this period, two organizations spearheaded the movement‚Äîthe Afro-American League (AAL) and the National Equal Rights Council (NERC). On January 4, 1935, Democratic Senators Edward P. Costigan and Robert F. Wagner together set out a new bill, the Costigan-Wagner Bill, that stated: \\"To assure to persons within the jurisdiction of every state the equal protection of the crime of lynching.\\" The bill had many protections from all types of lynching. As of 2020, neither this bill nor any other anti-lynching bill has passed both houses of Congress.  National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP)  In 1909, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) was established. The NAACP formed a special committee in 1916 in order to push for anti-lynching legislation and to enlighten the public about lynching. This organization's purpose was to ensure that African Americans got their economic, political, social, and educational rights. The NAACP used a combination of tactics such as illegal challenges, demonstrations, and economic boycotts. The NAACP youth were part of many rallies. They attended many protest against lynching and wore black in memory of all who had been murdered. They also sold anti-lynching buttons to raise money for the NAACP. The money they raised was to keep the fight against lynching going. They sold a huge number of buttons that said \\"Stop Lynching\\" and made about $869.25. The youth also contributed by having demonstrations to raise awareness about the horrors of lynching. They had these demonstrations in seventy-eight different cities all over the United States. According to Noralee Frankel, the anti- lynching movement had its origin in the Reformation period, just after the end of the Civil War. It cannot be described only as a result of the reforms during the Progressive Era.  Women's contributions  Many women contributed to the anti-lynching movement through the Dyer Bill, including Ida B. Wells, Mary Burnett Talbert and Angelina Grimk√©. The bill exposed both lynching and the effects it had on the people. = Ida B. Wells = Ida B. Wells was a significant figure in the anti-lynching movement. After the lynchings of her three friends, she condemned the lynchings in the newspapers Free Speech and Headlight, both owned by her. Wells wrote to reveal the abuse and race violence African Americans had to go through. She was a prominent member of many civil rights organizations, such as the NAACP, the Niagara Movement, and the Afro-American Council. Wells encouraged black women to work for anti- lynching laws to be passed. She was also part of the ‚ÄúFirst Suffrage Club for Black Women.\\" Ida B. Wells asked ‚ÄúIs Rape the ‚ÄòCause‚Äô of Lynching?‚Äù in their circular titled ‚ÄúThe Shame of America,‚Äù that emphasized the Dyer Anti-Lynching Bill, when they were in the Anti-Lynching Campaigns. Due to the number of 83 women being lynched in a time frame of 30 years plus 3,353 men that were also lynched. Because of her anti-lynching campaigning she received death threats from racist rioters. After having her children she got out of the organizations but she kept on protesting against lynching. In 1899 she protested the Sam Hose lynching in Georgia. = Mary Burnett Talbert = Mary B. Talbert was a civil rights and anti-lynching activist, preservationist, international human rights proponent, and educator. She was born and raised in ThOberlin, Ohio. She was the president of the National Association of Colored Women from 1916 to 1920. In 1923 she became vise president of the NAACP and her last contribution was leading the Anti- lynching Crusaders during the anti lynching movement . In 1922 Talbert and all the Negro women part of the anti- lynching crusaders raise $10,000 for the NAACP. = Angelina Weld Grimk√© = Angelina Weld Grimk√©, niece of the white Angelina Grimk√©, was a New Negro poet and often wrote about the effects of lynching. In one of her most famous plays, Rachel, she addressed both the lynching problem and the psychological affects that it had on African American people. This anti-lynching play was first performed before the NAACP's Anti-lynching Drama Committee. One of Grimk√©'s main goals was to get White women to empathize with the Black women who witnessed the lynching of their husbands and children. = Juanita Jackson Mitchell = Juanita Jackson was employed by the NAACP as their national youth director. Mitchell did everything she could to get young people involved in the NAACP and protesting against lynching. She got the young to campaign for anti-lynching legislation. She also got to send anti-lynching messages through a radio broadcast: in 1937 Juanita Jackson convinced the National Broadcasting Company to broadcast fifteen minutes on the need for anti-lynching laws.  Anti-Lynching Crusaders  The Anti-Lynching Crusaders were a group of strong, black, powerful women dedicated to stopping the lynching of African American men and women. Before the Anti-Lynching Crusaders was founded all these group of Crusaders were involved with churches that helped them learn how to lead with gender problems and power. The organization was under the guidance of the NAACP and was founded in 1922. The Crusaders women organization started with sixteen members but grew to nine hundred members within three months. This organization focused specifically on raising money to pass the Dyer Bill and stopping the killings of innocent people. Mary Talbert was the leader of the group; her objective was to unite 700 state workers, specifically women, but of no distinguishing color or race. Talbert was an active fundraiser for the Crusaders and affirmed the organizations desire \\"to raise at least one million dollars...to help us put over the Dyer Anti-Lynching Bill.\\" They raised over $10,800 by the spring of 1923.

Nike executives, however, did not view aerobics as a sport, and as a result, they did not immediately take advantage of the opportunity. Eventually, Reebok's strategic move to advertise towards women proved to be a success showing a 13% rise in market share, while Nike's market share was declining by 28%. Prior to 1987, there were no Nike advertisements directed toward women because it was believed that it would compromise Nike‚Äôs authentic and serious sports image. Finally in 1987, Nike slowly changed course with more women in its advertisements, but it was not really until the 1990s that it ramped up its focus on the woman as an athlete to compete with Reebok. Initially, ads in 1987 were too aggressive and they did not appeal to women. With that said, many people considered the 1987 ads to be a failure. Three years later Nike advertised in a different way this time creating ads that target women‚Äôs emotions and giving them a feeling of sense of community. According to Shelly Lucas, Nike created a team of \\"...about 40 female employees from various Nike and Wieden & Kennedy (Nike's advertising agency) departments and let the team work together on new women‚Äôs campaign.\\" The team of women eventually created advertising campaigns that revolved around three \\"big ideas\\": empowerment, entitlement, and product emphasis, which became influential to women throughout the nation according to Jean Grow and Joyce Wolburg.Grow, M.

The hem resembles a handkerchief that is held by the centre so that its corners hang down as points. A handkerchief hem skirt. History Handkerchief hems have been used in women's tops and skirt hems for centuries in many cultures, to add a flattering drape, especially over the hips. They can be seen in women's clothing in art from Ancient Greece, and appeared in Parisian fashions in the 1910s-1920s, such as the dresses of designer Madeleine Vionnet. Jean Patou followed Vionnet's lead, using the handkerchief hem to transition hemlines away from the shorter Flapper styles he had helped popularize, and towards the longer lengths that were fashionable during the 1930s. In the simplest design, a square of fabric is cut with an opening in the middle for the waistband. When the skirt is put on, the four corners hang down as points. More panels of material can be used to increase the number of corners, or points, along the hem. Revival In the first decade of the 21st century, handkerchief hems returned as a trend in women's clothing. Since the design involves pleats that drape, the effect is achieved with lightweight, flowing fabrics. In 2003, the trend was evident in bohemian styles such as designs by American clothing label Free People. In 2004, handkerchief hems were modelled at Milan fashion shows.

The results of multiple LCG algorithms are combined through the CLCG algorithm to create pseudo-random numbers with a longer period than is achievable with the LCG method by itself. The period of a CLCG is the least common multiple of the periods of the individual generators, which are one less than the moduli. Since all the moduli are odd primes, the periods are even and thus share at least a common divisor of 2, but if the moduli are chosen so that 2 is the greatest common divisor of each pair, this will result in a period of: : P= \\\\frac{(m_1-1)(m_2-1)\\\\cdots(m_k-1)}{2^{k-1}}  Example  The following is an example algorithm designed for use in 32-bit computers: : k=2 LCGs are used with the following properties: : \\\\begin{align} a_1 & =40014 & a_2 & =40692 \\\\\\\\\\\\ m_1 & =2147483563 & m_2 & =2147483399 \\\\\\\\\\\\ c_1 & =0 & c_2 & = 0 \\\\end{align} The CLCG algorithm is set up as follows: 1\\\\. The seed for the first LCG, Y_{0,1} , should be selected in the range of [1, 2147483562]. : The seed for the second LCG, Y_{0,2} , should be selected in the range of [1, 2147483398]. : Set: i=0 2\\\\. The two LCGs are evaluated as follows: : Y_{i+1, 1} = 40014 \\\\times Y_{i,1}\\\\pmod {2147483563} : Y_{i+1, 2} = 40692 \\\\times Y_{i,2}\\\\pmod {2147483399} 3\\\\. The CLCG equation is solved as shown below: : X_{i+1}= (Y_{i+1, 1} - Y_{i+1, 2})\\\\pmod{2147483563} 4\\\\. Calculate the random number: : R_{i+1} = \\\\begin{cases} X_{i+1}/2147483563 & \\\\text{for } X_{i+1} > 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ (X_{i+1}/2147483563) + 1 & \\\\text{for } X_{i+1} < 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 2147483562/2147483563 & \\\\text{for } X_{i+1}=0 \\\\end{cases} 5\\\\. Increment the counter (i = i + 1) then return to step 2 and repeat. The maximum period of the two LCGs used is calculated using the formula:. :(m-1) This equates to 2.1√ó109 for the two LCGs used. This CLCG shown in this example has a maximum period of: : (m_1-1)(m_2-1)/2 \\\\approx 2.3 \\\\times 10^{18} This represents a tremendous improvement over the period of the individual LCGs. It can be seen that the combined method increases the period by 9 orders of magnitude. Surprisingly the period of this CLCG may not be sufficient for all applications. Other algorithms using the CLCG method have been used to create pseudo-random number generators with periods as long as 3√ó1057.

Nicholls and Liebscher, Cambridge University Press, 2010. The culmination of the speculations and findings of German romantic philosophy in the first two-thirds of the 19th century, Philosophy of the Unconscious became famous. By 1882, it had appeared in nine editions. A three volume English translation appeared in 1884. The English translation is more than 1100 pages long. The work influenced Sigmund Freud's and Carl Jung's theories of the unconscious. Reception Philosophy of the Unconscious was translated from German into French and English, and went through many editions in all three languages, exerting a great influence on European culture and helping to make the idea of the unconscious familiar and accepted by the close of the 19th century. The work was widely read. Philosophy of the Unconscious received a critical discussion in the philosopher Franz Brentano's Psychology from an Empirical Standpoint (1874); Brentano commented that Hartmann's definition of consciousness perhaps referred to \\"something purely imaginary\\" and certainly did not agree with his definition of consciousness. The philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche described Hartmann's book as a \\"philosophy of unconscious irony\\", in his On the Use and Abuse of History for Life, one of the essays included in Untimely Meditations (1876). In Nietzsche's words: \\"Take a balance and put Hartmann's 'Unconscious' in one of the scales, and his 'World-process' in the other. There are some who believe they weigh equally; for in each scale there is an evil word‚Äîand a good joke.\\"Friedrich Nietzsche, On the Use and Abuse of History for Life, trans. (revised edition 2010) by Ian Johnston. Hartmann's work has been seen as preparing the way for Freud's later theory of the unconscious. Freud consulted Philosophy of the Unconscious while writing The Interpretation of Dreams (1899), in which he called Hartmann the firmest opponent of the theory that dreams are wish fulfillments. The philosopher Hans Vaihinger was influenced by Philosophy of the Unconscious, relating in his The Philosophy of 'As if' (1911) how it led him to Schopenhauer. The psychiatrist Henri Ellenberger writes in The Discovery of the Unconscious (1970) that the main interest of Hartmann's work is not its philosophical theories, but its wealth of supporting material. The psychologist Hans Eysenck writes in Decline and Fall of the Freudian Empire (1985) that Hartmann's version of the unconscious is very similar to Freud's. The philosopher Roger Scruton described Philosophy of the Unconscious as the \\"first major treatise\\" about the unconscious in Sexual Desire (1986). He credited Hartmann with offering a \\"canny and vigorous\\" description of sexual desire, but nevertheless considered him unsuccessful in explaining its intentionality. John Kerr writes that Hartmann's ideas about \\"destruction and transformation\\" parallel those of psychoanalyst Sabina Spielrein. The Italian poet Giovanni Pascoli was influenced by Philosophy of the Unconscious in his poetics program, \\"Il fanciullino\\" (\\"The child\\", 1897).Elio Gioanola, Giovanni Pascoli: sentimenti filiali di un parricida, Jaca Book, 2000, p.18.

It also reprints letters from Harold P. Blum, Marcia Cavell, Morris Eagle, Matthew Erdelyi, Allen Esterson, Robert R. Holt, James Hopkins, Lester Luborsky, David D. Olds, Mortimer Ostow, Bernard L. Pacella, Herbert S. Peyser, Charlotte Krause Prozan, Theresa Reid, James L. Rice, Jean Schimek, and Marian Tolpin. The book had a mixed reception. The articles by Crews it reprinted, including \\"The Unknown Freud\\", have been seen as turning points in the popular reception of Freud and psychoanalysis, and some commentators credited Crews with discrediting Freud's theories and convincingly criticizing recovered-memory therapy. However, others criticized him for failing to resolve the issues he explored and questioned his understanding of repression. He has been seen as presenting some of the most extreme criticism of Freud. Summary Sigmund Freud, the founder of psychoanalysis. Crews criticizes Freud. The Memory Wars reprints essays and letters about Sigmund Freud, psychoanalysis, and recovered-memory therapy that first appeared in The New York Review of Books, as well as an afterword by Crews that first appeared in The Times Higher Education Supplement. In addition to Crews, the contributors include Harold P. Blum, Marcia Cavell, Morris Eagle, Matthew Erdelyi, Allen Esterson, Robert R. Holt, James Hopkins, Lester Luborsky, David D. Olds, Mortimer Ostow, Bernard L. Pacella, Herbert S. Peyser, Charlotte Krause Prozan, Theresa Reid, James L. Rice, Jean Schimek, Marian Tolpin; another contributor was identified with the pseudonym \\"Penelope\\". Crews writes that his initial purpose in writing the book reviews included in the work was to explain how scholarly understanding of Freud and psychoanalysis has been changed by recent studies and \\"methodological critiques\\". He adds that he expected one of his articles would be controversial. The article was published under the title \\"The Unknown Freud\\", and was followed by \\"The Revenge of the Repressed\\". In \\"The Unknown Freud\\", Crews writes that psychoanalysis is in decline due to its limited effectiveness as a form of treatment. He discusses critiques of psychoanalysis such as the philosopher Adolf Gr√ºnbaum's The Foundations of Psychoanalysis (1984) and the psychologist Malcolm Macmillan's Freud Evaluated (1991); he maintains that no one has refuted Gr√ºnbaum's charge that clinical evidence cannot be used to validate \\"Freudian hypotheses\\" and that Macmillan convincingly criticizes Freud's theories of personality and neurosis. In \\"The Revenge of the Repressed\\", Crews criticizes recovered memory-therapy and discusses the case of Ross Cheit, arguing that while Cheit had \\"proved beyond question that his suddenly recalled 1968 molestation by a music camp administrator was real\\", it was questionable whether Cheit had ever repressed his memory of the incident. Crews suggests that Cheit \\"lost track of the incident\\" due to normal atrophy of memory and that his restored memory is therefore \\"useless as a proof of repression.\\" Publication history The Memory Wars was published in 1995 by The New York Review of Books. Reception =Reviews= The Memory Wars received positive reviews from the author Richard Webster in The Times Literary Supplement and the journalist Nicci Gerrard in New Statesman, mixed reviews from Vivian Dent in The New York Times Book Review, Laura Miller in Salon, and Elizabeth Gleick in Time, and negative reviews from the anthropologist Marilyn Ivy in The Nation and Brett Kahr in Psychoanalytic Studies. The book was also reviewed by Genevieve Stuttaford in Publishers Weekly, Sarah Boxer in The New York Times Book Review, the psychiatrist Anthony Storr in The Times, the biographer Paul Ferris in The Spectator, Peter L. Rudnytsky in American Imago, and by The Economist. Webster credited Crews with providing a useful overview of recent criticism of Freud and convincingly criticizing psychoanalysis and recovered- memory therapy. However, he considered Crews too quick to assume that Freud was deliberately dishonest rather than self-deluded. He also suggested that because Crews's articles had been published in The New York Review of Books, which had been considered a magazine sympathetic to psychoanalysis, they aroused anger from psychoanalysts. Gerrard wrote that Crews discredited Freud. Dent wrote that The Memory Wars \\"provides an example of how people can absorb volumes of identical evidence without changing utterly divergent opinions\\". While she wrote that the book raised important issues relevant to psychotherapy, such as the reliability of memory, the validity of the concept of repression, and the effects of therapies aimed at recovering memories, \\"true dialogue on these questions never emerges\\", and that the book \\"the book presents a mass of conflicting statements\\" from experts. Miller compared the book to \\"an online discussion\\". She described Crews's discussion of recovered- memory therapy as \\"scathing\\" and praised his style of writing. She credited Crews with supporting his objections to Freud's personal qualities and theories empirically with careful research, but also wrote that Crews's work could seem crankish and obsessive. She observed that scientific debate about repression could continue interminably, like an Internet \\"flame war\\". She wrote that while Crews argued that the major premises of psychoanalysis are unsupported by scientific data, it was debatable how \\"coolly quantifiable\\" study of the mind and the emotions could be. She suggested that Freud's view of memory made for a \\"better story\\" than that of Crews and argued that Crews did not explain why Freud's views often felt as though they were true. Gleick considered the book an \\"impressive dissection of Freud and the recovered memory movement\\". However, while she wrote that \\"Crews demolishes Freud neatly, and his insistence that we rely on empirical evidence is perfectly reasonable\\", she added that \\"such evidence often does not exist when it comes to the emotional realm\\" or where \\"long-ago child abuse\\" was concerned. She also suggested that because he considered Freud a charlatan and rejected psychoanalysis, Crews had to \\"dismiss the more interesting questions: What do our society's obsessions with child abuse, or Satanic rituals, or aliens, really mean?\\" Ivy described the New York Review essays that Crews reprinted as \\"cranky\\", and criticized Crews for oversimplifying the issues involved in the debates over recovered memory and sexual abuse, and failing to account for the social context that made the concern with ritual abuse possible. She considered Crews's claim that psychoanalysis is unscientific familiar and unoriginal and wrote that his, \\"valorization of science makes him uncomfortable indeed with ambiguity, not to mention undecidability.\\" Kahr called the book a \\"vicious piece of rhetoric\\" and argued that Crews's arguments against psychoanalysis were based on \\"scant solid data\\" and employed \\"the most purple prose I have read in many years\\". He also accused Crews of ignorance. =Other evaluations= Webster described The Memory Wars as one of the most trenchant and significant contributions to the debate on recovered- memory therapy. The psychologist Jennifer Freyd wrote that Crews made incorrect claims about Cheit's case and that Cheit himself had objected to Crews's account of how he remembered being sexually abused as a child. She also argued that Crews's understanding of repression was confused and that he was mistaken to claim that Cheit's case was irrelevant to the repressed memory debate. The philosopher John Forrester described Crews's article \\"The Unknown Freud\\" as a celebrated and widely-read article. He criticized Crews for discussing Gr√ºnbaum's criticisms of psychoanalysis in The Foundations of Psychoanalysis as though they were \\"already proven and widely accepted\\" and for presenting a \\"deeply personal\\" attack on Freud as though it were scholarly criticism. He noted that while Crews made criticisms of psychoanalysis similar to those already made by Gr√ºnbaum, he took them to extremes. He also accused Crews of having a \\"bizarre view\\" of \\"how scientists operate\\". The literature scholar Ritchie Robertson described The Memory Wars as representing \\"the more polemical version of anti-Freudian criticism\\". The psychologist Michael Billig described Crews as one of the most notable critics of Freud to have suggested that the memories reported by Freud's patients were suggested by Freud himself. He criticized Crews's view that repression must be understood as a completely unconscious process. The psychologist Louis Breger described Crews as one of Freud's most dismissive critics. He considered some of Crews' points valuable, but maintained that Crews, like other critics of Freud, too frequently jumps \\"from valid criticisms of some part of Freud's work to a condemnation of the whole.\\" The psychoanalyst Juliet Mitchell described \\"The Unknown Freud\\" as an important attack on Freud and psychoanalysis. However, she criticized it and Crews's other articles, arguing that Crews wrongly claimed that psychoanalysis was responsible for the recovered memory movement. She argued that the two are connected not by an emphasis on parental seduction or abuse, but by the fact that in both cases their patients use discussion of sexuality as \\"the main manifestation of their condition.\\" She also argued that Crews misunderstood Freud's view of memory, and that of psychoanalysis more generally, and incorrectly claimed that hysteria does not exist. The political scientist Jos√© Brunner described \\"The Unknown Freud\\" as the beginning of the \\"Freud Wars\\", a long-running debate over Freud's reputation, work and impact. The philosopher Todd Dufresne suggested that The Memory Wars may be the book for which Crews is best known, and that the articles it reprinted were turning points in the popular reception of Freud and psychoanalysis.

The series has been described as derivative of Neon Genesis Evangelion, but with more sexual content. Plot When aliens invade, the Earth's only effective defense is the giant robot Devadasy. Devadasy is piloted by male protagonist Kei and one of two female co-pilots, Misako and Naoki, and is powered by their \\"sexual energy\\". Release history De:vadasy was initially released in Japan marketed as an all-age appropriate title, but was soon changed to being classified as an adult-only title. Though the anime contains no explicit on- screen sexual content, the change to being classified as an adult title was made due to implied off-screen sex and significant innuendo, as well as changes in Japanese law around the time of its release. No edits were made to the content of the anime in the change from an all-age to adult title. De:vadasy has been released in the United States by Media Blasters under their non-adult Anime Works label. Reception De:vadasy has received a mostly negative response from critics, who criticised the series for being overly derivative of Neon Genesis Evangelion. Mike Toole, writing for Anime News Network, described the series as \\"cheap\\" and \\"shoddy\\", and not worthy of a purchase even at bargain prices. Carlos Ross, writing for THEM Anime, was particularly critical of the protagonist Kei, who he described as \\"completely unlikeable\\". Ross came to a similar conclusion about the series as Toole, saying that the anime is possibly not worth watching even for free.

A Japanese magazine, Idea, once listed him among the top fifteen designers in the United States. Early life George Elliott Olden was born in Birmingham, Alabama on November 13, 1920 as the grandson of a slave and the son of a Baptist preacher. In youth he attended Dunbar High School in Washington, D.C.,Graphic Design History 115-128 then Virginia State College, before dropping out shortly after the attack on Pearl Harbor to work as a graphic designer for the Office of Strategic Services (OSS), forerunner of the CIA.  Career  During his time at the OSS, Olden worked for some of America's leading artists, designers and writers and made contacts that opened significant professional opportunities after the war. When the war ended in 1945, the head of the OSS communications division, Colonel Lawrence W. Lowman, who in civilian life became Vice President of CBS's television division, was searching for someone who \\"had a full grasp of the whole range of commercial-art techniques.\\" He found Olden, and from a one-man operation involved with six programs a week, Olden eventually headed a staff of 14 in charge of 60 weekly shows. When he joined the network in 1945, there were 16,000 television sets in the entire nation. By the time he left the network in 1960, there were 85 million sets, one for every two Americans. From 1945 to 1960, Olden worked with William Golden, art director for CBS, and as such was one of the first African- Americans to work in television. At CBS, he was an ardent champion of contemporary art, commissioning on-air art and title cards by modern artists. ‚ÄúThe door is open for artists on TV,‚Äù he proclaimed in 1954. One example was the creation of the \\"To Tell the Truth man\\" icon that was used during the 1956-1978 seasons of that show. In 1960, he began to work in advertising and went on to design the Clio Award as well as receive seven of them. In 1960, he moved to BBDO as the TV group art supervisor. In 1963, he became the VP-senior art director at the major firm, McCann Erickson. In 1963, he was the first African-American to design a postage stamp for the United States Postal Service. The design commemorated the centennial of the declaration of the Emancipation Proclamation with a simple design of a broken chain in black on a blue background. He attended a White House ceremony where the stamp was introduced by President John F. Kennedy. In 1970, McCann Erickson laid him off with the reason being cited as the economic downturn of the time.  Personal life  Olden has been said to have a mixed legacy in terms of race. Despite his position at McCann Erickson, he tended to avoid pressing racial issues or pressing firms to hire blacks, saying acceptance into the industry is a matter of talent. His stance on race often earned him the description of being arrogant and standoffish. However, in 1970, he sued his former employer, McCann Erickson, for wrongful termination caused by discrimination. He cited the dissolution of the Professional Advisory Council (PAC), of which he was a member, was a conscious decision to not allow him to move up in the company thereby keeping him at the level in which he joined the company. McCann argued that Olden never requested a transfer out of PAC into a position that would lead to greater promotion within the company. In 1972, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission found reasonable cause that the company practiced discriminatory hiring, but did not find reasonable cause on behalf of Olden. After moving to Los Angeles, California, Olden started a class-action lawsuit against McCann Erickson for discrimination, but was shot to death, allegedly by a live-in girlfriend who was arrested and tried a few days before the class action lawsuit was scheduled to begin. She pleaded not guilty and was acquitted in court.Source: Graphic Design History 115-128; personal interviews: 2010-2013 Olden was the father of author Marc Olden and child actor/model Georg Olden, Jr.  Awards  * Art Directors Club of New York medal, 1953 * Art Directors Club of New York medal, 1956 * Cannes Film Festival, Advertising prize, 1967 * Seven Clio Awards, 1962-1970 * AIGA Medal, 2007  References  Category:1920 births Category:1975 deaths Category:Artists from Birmingham, Alabama Category:African-American graphic designers Category:American graphic designers Category:Advertising people Category:AIGA medalists Category:Clio Award winners Category:Murdered African- American people Category:Deaths by firearm in California Category:CBS people Category:American stamp designers Category:Dunbar High School (Washington, D.C.) alumni ","title":"Georg Olden (graphic designer)"},{"id":"35467108","text":"is a crossover tactical role-playing game for the Nintendo 3DS developed by Monolith Soft with assistance from Capcom and Red Entertainment and published by Namco Bandai Games.

Each friendly unit is made up of two characters (thus referred to as a Pair Unit), though a third character (or \\"Solo Unit\\") can be added for once-per- battle assistance. Unlike Namco √ó Capcom, units can move freely within their range on the field map, with no penalty for accessing treasure chests or destructible objects prior to attacking. The battle system is called the Cross Active Battle System, wherein pressing the A button in combination with the Circle Pad performs up to five basic attack combos. Additional gameplay elements include Support Attack, which allows the player to call in a nearby ally for assistance, and Cross Hit, which freezes the target in place during simultaneous attacks from multiple units. Also, the player can trigger Critical Hits by connecting their next attack just before the target hits the ground after the first. As the player's units deal damage, the player's Cross Power (XP) gauge fills up and can be used for special attacks and defensive moves on the map. Damage done via Cross Hits can fill this gauge up to 150%. Project X Zone has a total of 15 save game slots included in the game, which can be used for recording a save game file during intermissions with a quick save file and a soft reset command. Plot Development Namco Bandai came up with the idea of a \\"dream crossover\\" and brought on Capcom and Sega. The game was first revealed in a teaser by Bandai Namco on the official website until it was revealed in the May 2012 issue of Famitsu. The initial creation of the characters were done in 3D character models before they were converted to be SD pixel art. Notable attacks used by the characters had to be done in 2D space in order to preserve its source material origin. The game features two theme songs, with the opening song titled \\"Wing Wanderer\\" and the ending titled \\"GALAXY\\", which were both performed by Yoko Takahashi. The opening movie was created by the new animation studio Trigger, which was founded by former Gainax employees Hiroyuki Imaishi and others. On September 22, 2012, Katsuhiro Harada, producer of the Tekken series, had revealed on Twitter: \\"I proposed localization of Project X Zone.\\" He added that the company had \\"not decided yet, but it will be realized if I continue proposing.\\" Namco Bandai Games announced on January 21, 2013 that the game would be officially released in North America, Europe and Australasia during summer 2013. The English versions of the game retain the Japanese voices, like Otomedius Excellent, though the vocals for the opening theme music were removed for legal reasons. Some music tracks were removed or replaced for the same reasons. On May 1, 2016, the game was removed from the North American and European eShops. Reception The game sold more than 85,539 units in its first week in Japan. In the West, the game has sold over ten times more than what Bandai Namco had expected. The game was among the 20 best games sold in the United Kingdom after it made its debut. In the United States, the game has been among the best selling games sold for the 3DS. The game has sold over 400,000 copies worldwide, according to Bandai Namco. Project X Zone has received mixed to positive reviews from western critics. The game currently has a score of 70 out of 100 on Metacritic. IGN's Scott Thompson gave Project X Zone a score of 8 out of 10, saying, \\"Project X Zone is often funny and consistently frantic ‚Äì two traits not necessarily associated with tactical RPGs. Its story is confusing and the chapters slavishly follow the same repetitive formula, but the superb battle system makes repetition not just tolerable, but enjoyable.\\" Game Revolution gave it a 3.5 out of 5, saying, \\"Despite the lack of depth and the repetition of combat, Project X Zone follows through as a tactical, humorous, preposterous romp through the best hits of video games. Even if you find the combat system strange, the streak of character cameos and the ridiculous number of hits that rack up with every battle will make any hardcore fan smile with appreciation. And if you're anything like me, that's hard to do.\\" On a more negative note, GamesRadar gave Project X Zone a 2 out of 5, saying, \\"With the wealth of RPGs, and even great SRPGs, that have arrived on the 3DS in the last several months, it would almost be unconscionable not to recommend one of those games instead of Project X Zone. Fun combat and screaming Tekken characters can only take you so far.\\" Kotaku's Mike Fahey included Project X Zone in his top ten games of 2013. In 2014, Kotaku also included the game among \\"The 12 Best Games on the 3DS\\". Sequel A sequel was announced exclusively for the 3DS, titled Brave New World, and it was released in Japan in November 2015 and in North America and Europe in February 2016.

The ideas behind the Concert of Nations are rooted in seventeenth century political philosophy of harmonism, which included music, politics, religion, science, and the entire universe (physical and metaphysical). The Congress of Vienna enacted the principles of the Concert in both musical entertainment and political relations. The stability of Europe during the decades following the Congress of Vienna has led to widespread popularity of the idea of a Concert of Nations, though its (largely theoretical) application vary widely in their interpretations of what a Concert of Nations means for present-day international relations. Philosophical foundations The Concert of Nations emerged in the nineteenth century as the ideal for international relations in Europe. In order to understand its practical and theoretical uses, it is important to review the philosophical history behind its formation. By its historical definitions, concert can mean a musical performance event, or it can designate the act of cooperation between multiple parties pursuing a single enterprise. Which meaning is primary and which is secondary has varied through time, and to this day there is no consensus on the true origin of the word. The Great Chain of Being also provides much-needed context for understanding what the Concert of Nations meant to nineteenth century politicians. This philosophy declared that every being has its place under God's rule, and that harmony between all creatures is only achieved when each accepts the duties and joys to which it has been designated. Music served as an example for pieces working together, from the overtones of the planets‚Äô motion to the ordered motion of musical voices in an ensemble. Not everyone is a soloist, but everyone's part, in its own way, is essential to all the rest. Concert of Europe Since the Concert of Nations was conceptualized in such strongly musical terms, these competing definitions of the concert did not seem so far apart for citizens of the nineteenth century as they do for us today. The Congress of Vienna in 1815 is the seminal example of putting Concert ideologies to work. Not only did diplomats establish a system to maintain European political stability, but they did so in a way that emphasized harmony over power. Much of the significant negotiations happened around music or dancing rather than just formal meetings.Biba, Otto. \\"The Congress of Vienna and Music.\\" In Denmark and the Dancing Congress of Vienna: Playing for Denmark's Future, (Copenhagen: Den Kongelige Udstillingsfond, 2002), 200-214.Kraehe, Enno. \\"The Congress of Vienna.\\" In Schubert's Vienna, ed. Raymond Erickson, (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1997), 55-76. While every nation had its own agenda to pursue and many less-powerful voices were lost in the concert, diplomats worked to blend interests within the common goal of maintaining an imperialist structure. Historical uses Given the great success of the Congress of Vienna, many politicians have resurrected the idea of a Concert of Nations in order to support their contemporary agendas. Two excellent examples of this come from U.S. Senator France in 1921 and again from Senator Fulbright in 1961. Both of these cases face the difficulty of adapting concert politics to the twentieth century while disassociating themselves from its imperialist roots. =Post-World War I= In 1921, Senator France proposed a ‚ÄúConcert of Nations‚Äù to replace the League of Nations.France, Joseph Irwin. ‚ÄúThe Concert of Nations.‚Äù Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science 96, no. 4 (1921): 141-146, In his mind, this Concert would be more effective than both the Concert of Europe or the League of Nations because it would be rooted in democratic (and very American) values. His article demonstrates the way that politicians already looked up to the stability achieved by the Concert of Europe, but for the most part it bends concert ideology to match Senator France's existing political agenda. =Cold War= The same problem resurfaces in the Cold War, when Senator Fulbright proposes an ‚ÄúConcert of Free Nations\\".Fulbright, J.W. ‚ÄúFor a Concert of Free Nations.‚Äù Foreign Affairs 40, no. 1 (1961): 1-18, While Senator Fulbright does better research into the details of the Concert of Europe, he runs into similar trouble with how to make use of concert politics within a democratic sphere. He sees a contemporary concert including an inner circle of powerful democracies and an outer circle of less significant countries. In some ways, this strongly imitates the original Concert ideologies by allowing for differences in degree of influence in the concert. But it also leaves out very significant world powers who ascribe to communist values. Contemporary politics In contemporary politics, both first-world powers and developing nations use Concert of Nations as a tool to promote their political agenda on the international stage. =Concert of Democracies= The Concert of Democracies seems to follow closely on the heels of both Senator France and Senator Fulbright by proposing a concert limited to democratic countries that pursues democratic ideals like human rights and self-government. But in a similar vein, it also fails to address the significant ways in which it diverges from the Concert of Nations as understood by the Congress of Vienna: namely, its members are dependent on democratic support and it leaves out very powerful undemocratic nations. In practice, this means that the members of a Concert of Democracies would be subject to popular opinion for their continued participation, rather than on their imperialist good judgment. It also divides the world based on democratic or nondemocratic values rather than bringing differences together into balance.Economist. ‚ÄúConcert of Democracies: A seductive sound.‚Äù July 7, 2007. =Harmonious Society= From an entirely different tradition, China's Socialist Harmonious Society proposes similar values as the nineteenth century's Concert of Nations. A discourse balanced between international cooperation and pursuit of power in international relations make this policy seem the most similar to the nineteenth century conception of working ‚Äúin concert‚Äù.Zheng, yongnian, and Sow Keat Tok. ‚Äú‚ÄòHarmonious society‚Äô and ‚ÄòHarmonious World‚Äô: China‚Äôs Policy Discourse under Hu Jintao,‚Äù in Briefing Series 26, (Nottingham: China Policy Institute, October 2007). =Developing countries= Amidst developing countries, the Concert of Nations appears as a marker of identity, influence, and power in the international sphere. ASEAN, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, defines itself as a Concert of southeast Asian nations as a means to set the vision for their internal workings and to brand themselves for global relations.Association of Southeast Asian Nations. \\"ASEAN Vision 2020\\" Many African nations have also brought the Concert of Nations into their political rhetoric, most often in reference to taking their place or having their voice heard in the concert. Both of these contexts seem very aware of the power dynamics that surround use of the Concert as a political structure. As a rhetorical device, the concert provides a way to assert one's identity as a nation without claiming to do so at anyone's expense.Kendemeh, Emmanuel. ‚ÄúCameroon‚Äôs Voice Prominent in Concert of Nations.‚Äù Cameroon Tribune, August 25, 2010, .Embassy of the Republic of Angola Japan. ‚ÄúSpeech Delivered By His Excellency Jose Eduardo Dos Santos, President Of The Republic Of Angola, At The Opening Ceremony Of The National Assembly.‚Äù October 27, 2010, . Musical groups Finally, musical groups also continue to draw from the nineteenth-century concert ideas by bringing together musicians from different countries to pursue literal and figurative harmony. Two significant examples of this are the West-Eastern Divan and Le Concert des Nations. The West-Eastern Divan explicitly explores using music to cross boundaries of political conflict by bringing together young musicians from Israel, Palestine, and Spain on an orchestral tour every summer. Le Concert des Nations works with period instruments, but it also intentionally gathers a highly international group of performers. These groups demonstrate the sustained symbolic relationship between musical and political discourses, though they have somewhat diverged from their nineteenth century unity.

It has conical, grey to buff fruit bodies that grow up to tall and wide. Recent molecular and morphological studies have also shown M. tridentina to be conspecific to M. frustrata, M. quercus-ilicis, M. elatoides, M. elatoides var. elegans and M. conica var. pseudoeximia. Taxonomy Morchella tridentina was first described by Giacomo Bresadola in 1892 in a work on fungi found in the region of Trento in Italy, and it has retained the same name up to the present day. The species name derives from the Latin word for Trento, \\"Tridentum\\". The American species Morchella frustrata was described as new to science in a 2012 publication by Michael Kuo and colleagues. The report resulted from the Morel Data Collection Project, which aimed to clarify aspects of the biology, taxonomy and distribution of North American Morchella, and described 14 new morel species (without, however, checking in detail the correspondence with existing European names). The type locality was in Placer County, California. In a study the year before, this morel was referred to as \\"Mel-2\\", which was a phylogenetic species, defined by DNA sequence rather than morphological characteristics. It was given the common name \\"mountain blond morel\\". The specific epithet frustrata refers to the \\"frustrating combination of black and yellow morel features that characterize the species.\\" In two subsequent studies, however, Richard and colleagues (in 2014) and Loizides and colleagues (in 2015) used DNA analysis to determine that this species is identical to morels collected in southern Europe, matching the original 1892 description of Morchella tridentina by Bresadola. The latter name therefore takes precedence and M. frustrata is actually a synonym of M. tridentina. Description = Morphology = The fruit bodies are often rufescent and high. The conical cap is high and wide at the widest point. The cap surface features pits and ridges, which are formed from the intersection of 16‚Äì22 primary vertical ridges and few shorter, secondary vertical ridges, with frequent, sunken, horizontal ridges. The cap is attached to the stipe with a distinct sinus about 2‚Äì4 mm deep and 2‚Äì4 mm wide. The smooth, splitting ridges remain persistently pale throughout the maturity process, easily distinguishing this species from other species in section Elata, or black morels, which have ridges that typically darken with age. Pits are usually elongated vertically. They are smooth, dull grayish to pale yellowish or nearly whitish when young, later becoming pale tan to pale pinkish tan. The stipe is high by wide and is more or less equal in width throughout its length or sometimes thicker at the base. Its whitish surface is smooth or finely mealy with whitish granules. The flesh is whitish and measures 1‚Äì2 mm thick in the hollow cap and the sterile inner surface of the cap is whitish and pubescent (having soft, short and erect \\"hairs\\"). The spores are smooth and elliptical. The ascospores are smooth, elliptical, and measure 20‚Äì26 by 13‚Äì18 ¬µm. The asci (spore-bearing cells) measure 225‚Äì330 by 15‚Äì25 ¬µm and are cylindrical, eight-spored, and hyaline (translucent) when mounted in dilute (2%) potassium hydroxide (KOH). The paraphyses are cylindrical to capitate or moniliform, measuring 95‚Äì250 long by 10‚Äì25 ¬µm wide, and are septate. Their tips are rounded to somewhat club-shaped or infrequently somewhat fuse-shaped. Elements on the sterile ridges are 50‚Äì175 by 12.5‚Äì20 ¬µm, and septate. The terminal cells are club- shaped or nearly so. = Edibility = See the article on the genus Morchella for details of edible characteristics, which are presumed to be the similar in all morels. In general, morels should not be eaten raw, as they can trigger allergic reactions in susceptible individuals. Their flavor is enhanced after they are fried, stuffed, or dried, and so is their safety for eating. Beware of confusion with Gyromitra species. = Similar species = This species is very similar to Morchella rufobrunnea, another rufescent, cosmopolitan species with pale colours, which is nonetheless found in urban and suburban areas. The latter is distinguished by an adnate cap lacking a sinus and a distinct dark pruinescence on the stem, more pronounced in young fruit bodies. Due to its similar light coloration, M. tridentina may also be confused with Morchella esculentoides; as Kuo states, \\"it looks like a black morel with the colors of a yellow morel.\\" The vertically arranged pits and ridges, as well as the slight indentation where the cap meets the stem on M. tridentina, however, more closely resemble the black morels such as M. elata. M. snyderi is somewhat similar in appearance to young specimens of M. tridentina, but mature specimens of the former species can be distinguished by the brown to black ridges on the cap, and the ridged and pocketed stipe. Despite its light color, M. tridentina belongs to the Elata clade along with other black morels, including M. tomentosa and M. angusticeps. Habitat and distribution Morchella tridentina fruit bodies grow solitary, scattered, or in small groups in spring, in mountainous forests and maquis. The exact trophic status of the fungus is not yet known with certainty, but it is suspected to be facultatively mycorrhizal or biotrophic. Tree species associated with the fungus include pacific madrone (Arbutus menziesii), oaks (Quercus spp.), Douglas fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii), ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa), sugar pine (Pinus lambertiana), and white fir (Abies concolor). In Europe it is often found with holm oak (Quercus ilex), strawberry trees (Arbutus andrachne), olive trees (Olea europaea), Spanish fir (Abies pinsapo), Silver fir (Abies alba) and Scot's pine (Pinus sylvestris). Although it was originally hypothesized that collections of M. tridentina from Turkey might recently have been introduced from North America, numerous collections reported since from remote and undisturbed areas in the Mediterranean and the Alps (including Bresadola's original collection from Trentino), suggest a long-time and well-established presence of this species in Europe. Kuo suggests that it might be also widely distributed in western North America, but so far it has only been confirmed to be present in Oregon and California.

Described as new to science in 2012, it occurs in the non-burned montane forests of western North America, including California, Idaho, Montana, Oregon and Washington. It produces fruit bodies up to tall with ridged and pitted conical caps, and stipes that become pitted in maturity. The color of the morel is yellow to tan when young, but the cap ridges become brown to black in maturity or when dried. Taxonomy Morchella snyderi was described as new to science in 2012, along with 13 other morels from the United States and Canada. The study, published in the journal Mycologia, resulted from the Morel Data Collection Project, which aimed to help clarify the taxonomy, biology, and distribution of morel species in North America. The specific epithet honors Leon C. Snyder, who described similar morels in Washington state in the 1930s. According to Michael Kuo, who coauthored the species description, the morel should have been named Morchella crassistipa, as it was previously described by Snyder in 1938, from collections made in Washington. However, molecular analysis determined that Snyder's type collection contained two distinct species, rendering the validity of the taxon dubious. M. snyderi was also previously identified as phylogenetic species Mel-12 (i.e., defined by DNA sequence) in a 2011 study. Despite the light coloration of young fruit bodies, Morchella snyderi groups in the elata clade (named after the European black morel M. elata) along with other \\"black\\" morels such as M. angusticeps and M. tomentosa. Morphological characteristics of morels in this clade include pits on the cap that are usually elongated vertically in mature fruit bodies, and often the presence of a sinus (a space or indentation) where the cap attaches to the stipe. Description The stipe becomes pocketed (lacunose) in maturity. In this specimen, the cap ridges are tan where they were buried in the plant litter, and black where they were exposed. The fruit bodies are high. The conical cap is high and wide at the widest point. The cap surface features pits and ridges, formed by the intersection of 16‚Äì22 primary vertical ridges and frequent shorter, secondary vertical ridges, with occasional sunken, horizontal ridges. The cap is attached to the stipe with a sinus about 2‚Äì4 mm deep and 2‚Äì4 mm wide. The ridges are smooth or very finely tomentose (covered with densely matted filaments). They are initially pale yellowish, becoming pale tan, then grayish brown in maturity, eventually darkening to nearly black when dried. They are flattened when young but sometimes become sharpened or eroded in maturity. The pits are somewhat elongated vertically (particularly when mature). They are finely tomentose, yellowish when young, becoming pale tan to pale grayish brown. Fruit bodies are often found in a transitional stage where the upper part of the cap has turned dark while the lower part remains light. The whitish to pale brownish stipe is long by wide and is roughly equal in width throughout its length, or sometimes slightly thicker near the base. Its surface, initially covered with whitish granules, becomes more granulated as the mushroom ages, and typically develops prominent ridges and pits (i.e., becomes lacunose) with maturity. The flesh is whitish, measuring 1‚Äì2 mm thick in the hollow cap; it becomes layered and chambered, particularly in the base of the stipe. The sterile inner surface of the cap is whitish and pubescent (covered with short, soft \\"hair\\"). The smooth, elliptical spores measure up to 37 ¬µm. The ascospores of M. snyderi are elliptical and smooth, measuring 25‚Äì37 by 15‚Äì23 ¬µm. Asci (spore-bearing cells) are eight-spored, cylindrical, and measure 225‚Äì300 by 7.5‚Äì32.5 ¬µm. Paraphyses are cylindrical, septate, and measure 100‚Äì200 by 7.5‚Äì20 ¬µm. Their tips are variably shaped, from rounded to club-shaped, to fuse-shaped. The contents of the paraphyses are hyaline (translucent) to faintly brownish in dilute potassium hydroxide (KOH). Hyphae on the sterile cap ridges are septate and measure 75‚Äì175 by 10‚Äì20 ¬µm. The terminal cells are variably shaped (similar to the paraphyses), and have hyaline to brownish contents in KOH. North American Morchella are generally considered choice edibles, but the edibility of M. snyderi was not mentioned in its original description. =Similar species= Morchella snyderi can be distinguished from similar North American morels by differences in ecological and morphological features. M. frustrata resembles young specimens of M. snyderi, but the ridges of the caps of the former species do not darken in maturity, and it has smaller ascospores, measuring 20‚Äì29 by 14‚Äì19 ¬µm. Another potential lookalike, M. brunnea, has a browner fruit body color in young specimens, and a stipe that is not lacunose. Habitat, distribution, and ecology Morchella snyderi is suspected of being both saprobic and mycorrhizal at different stages in its life cycle. Fruit bodies grow singly, scattered, or in groups on the ground under conifers, particularly Douglas fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii), ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) and white fir (Abies concolor). Fruiting occurs from April to June. The fungus has been collected in California, Idaho, Montana, Oregon, Washington, New Mexico, and Arizona. M. snyderi, identified as phylogenetic species Mel-12, has been shown to colonize the non-native species Bromus tectorum (cheatgrass) as an endophyte. This is hypothesized to be a contributing factor in the success of cheatgrass as an invasive species in western North America.

It is considered a choice edible mushroom. The fruit bodies develop a distinctive ladder-like pattern of pits and ridges on the surface of their conical caps. Taxonomy Officially described in 2012, Morchella importuna was one of 14 new North American species that resulted from the Morel Data Collection Project. The type locality was in King County, Washington. It was previously identified as phylogenetic species Mel-10 in a 2011 publication, and erroneously as the \\"Classic North American Black Morel\\" in 2005, where it was lumped together with Morchella angusticeps, and what has since been described as M. brunnea.

As argued in a recent study by Richard et al. however, the name Morchella importuna is probably a later synonym of an old European taxon, such as Morchella elata, Morchella vaporaria or Morchella hortensis. Description In immature fruit bodies, the cap ridges are rounded and the color predominantly grayish. The fruit bodies of M. importuna are high. The cap is high and measures wide at its widest point. It is conical to widely conical or occasionally egg-shaped. Its surface has pits and ridges, with 12‚Äì20 primary vertical ridges and numerous transecting horizontal ridges, creating a laddered appearance. The cap is attached to stipe with a sinus about 2‚Äì5 mm both deep and wide. The ridges are smooth or finely velvety and colored pale to dark gray when young, becoming dark grayish brown to nearly black in age. They are bluntly rounded when young, but later become sharpened or eroded. Pits are vertically elongated in all stages of development. They have a smooth or finely velvety texture. The pits open and deepen with development, progressing from gray to dark gray when immature to grayish brown, grayish olive or brownish yellow at maturity. The stipe measures high and wide, and is often somewhat thicker near the base. Its whitish to pale brownish surface is smooth or finely mealy with whitish granules. It develops longitudinal ridges and grooves (particularly near the base) as the fruit body matures. The flesh is whitish to watery tan, measuring 1‚Äì3 mm thick in the hollow cap; in the stipe, this tissue is sometimes arranged as chambers or layers. The sterile inner surface of the cap is whitish and pubescent (covered with short soft \\"hair\\"). Morchella importuna is found in urban settings such as gardens and wood chip beds. The ascospores are elliptical, smooth, and measure 18‚Äì24 by 10‚Äì13 ¬µm. The cylindrical, hyaline (translucent), asci are eight-spored, measuring 220‚Äì300 by 12‚Äì25 ¬µm. Paraphyses are septate, measuring 150‚Äì250 by 7‚Äì15 ¬µm. They are cylindrical with variably shaped tips: rounded to roughly club-shaped, pointy, or fuse- shaped. Elements on the sterile ridges are septate and measure 25‚Äì300 by 10‚Äì30 ¬µm. Terminal cells are cylindrical with a rounded tip that is variably shaped similar to the paraphyses. Both the paraphyses and the terminal cells are hyaline or brownish in dilute (2%) potassium hydroxide. As a member of the Morchella elata group of black morels, M. importuna is sought after as a choice edible mushroom. Raw morels are poisonous and should always be cooked. =Similar species= The rare Pacific Northwest morel Morchella hotsonii, known only from its type collection, is quite similar in appearance to M. importuna. The former species is distinguished by its finely velvety surface. Habitat, distribution, and ecology A saprobic fungus, Morchella importuna fruit bodies grow in wood chips, gardens, and planters in urban areas. Kuo suggests that it has mycorrhizal tendencies when grown in an environment with trees. Known primarily from northern California and the Pacific Northwest region of the United States, it has been reported from British Columbia (Canada), California, Washington, Nevada, and Oregon, although there have been a few isolated reports of the morel from the Midwestern United States and from eastern North America. Fruiting occurs in the spring, from March until May. Identified as phylogenetic species \\"Mel-10\\", Morchella importuna has also been found in Turkey and China, but it remains unclear whether dispersal between these distant locations occurred naturally or through accidental introduction by humans.

Taxonomy Morchella sextelata was originally identified as phylogenetic species \\"Mel-6\\" in the species-rich Elata clade (brown morels) elucidated by microbiologist Kerry O'Donnell and colleagues in a 2011 publication. The specific epithet sextelata alludes to this preliminary name. Although M. sextelata is not distinguishable from Morchella septimelata on physical or ecological characteristics, they are clearly genetically distinct species, and can be differentiated by comparing DNA sequences or with restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis.

M. septimelata can be distinguished from these latter three lookalikes by habitat or distribution: M. brunnea is found in non-burned forests of western North America; M. angusticeps is found east of the Rocky Mountains; and M. septentrionalis is restricted to a northern distribution (about 44¬∞N northward) in eastern North America. M. septimelata, however, also grows in burn sites and so is both morphologically and ecologically indistinguishable from M. sextelata. Although there are subtle differences in the structure of the sterile ridges between the species, the authors were not confident that enough specimens had been examined to establish that these differences were consistent. Habitat, distribution, and ecology A group of fruit bodies in Yosemite National Park, California, in an area burned by the 2013 Rim Fire Morchella sextelata may be either saprobic or mycorrhizal at different times in its life cycle. Its fruit bodies grow in partially burned conifer forests, particularly those dominated by Douglas fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) and ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa). They tend to appear in great numbers the year immediately following fire and appear in decreasing frequency in successive years. Fruiting occurs from April through July, at elevations between . The distribution includes Washington, Idaho, Montana, Wyoming, and Yukon Territory. M. sextelata has also been found in China, but it remains unclear whether dispersal between these distant locations occurred naturally or through accidental introduction by humans. Morchella sextelata, identified as phylogenetic species \\"Mel-6\\", has been shown to colonize the non-native species Bromus tectorum (cheatgrass) as an endophyte, increasing the overall growth of the grass, as well as the abundance of seeds and their tolerance to extreme heat (). This has been hypothesized to be a contributing factor in the success of cheatgrass as an invasive species in western North America.

Described as new to science in 2012, its specific epithet refers to its association with black cottonwood (Populus trichocarpa). The morel used to be referred to as Morchella semilibera in western North American field guides until molecular analysis established that to be a strictly European species. M. populiphila occurs in California, Nevada and Oregon. Its fruit bodies grow up to tall with a ridged and pitted conical cap that attaches about halfway down the stipe. The cap ridges are dark brown to black in maturity, while the pits are yellowish to brownish. The fungus is edible, although not as highly valued as other morels. Morchella populiphila is one of three species of fungi commonly referred to as \\"half-free\\" morels, the others being Morchella punctipes in eastern North America and Morchella semilibera in Europe. Taxonomy Morchella populiphila was one of 14 new Morchella species described in 2012 by Michael Kuo and colleagues as a result of the Morel Data Collection Project, which was aimed at clarifying the biology, taxonomy, and distribution of morel species in the United States and Canada. The type locality is in Jackson County, Oregon. The fungus used to be referred to as Morchella semilibera (the \\"half-free morel\\") in western North American field guides until molecular analysis established that to be a strictly European species. It was previously referred to as phylogenetic species Mel-5 (i.e., identified based on DNA sequence) in a 2011 publication. The specific epithet populiphila refers to its association with the tree species Populus trichocarpa. Description Section of a fruit body showing cap attachment to the stipe and inner surfaces The fruit bodies are high with a conical cap that is tall and wide at the widest point. The cap surface has pits and ridges, formed by the intersection of 12‚Äì20 primary vertical ridges and infrequent shorter, secondary vertical ridges and transecting horizontal ridges. The cap is attached in a skirt-like manner to the stipe, roughly halfway from the top, with a sinus deep. The ridges are smooth and colored yellowish brown to honey brown when young, but darken in age to brown, dark brown or black. When young the ridges are up to 1 mm wide and flat with sharp edges but usually become rounded, sharp or eroded in age. The pits are smooth and vertically elongated. Initially whitish to pale brown when immature, they become brownish to yellowish or grayish brown at maturity. The fragile stipe measures tall by thick and is roughly the same width throughout its length, or tapered towards the top. It is often hidden by the cap when young but becomes longer as it matures, often developing shallow longitudinal furrows. In warm, wet conditions the stipe sometimes becomes inflated, especially near the base. White to whitish or watery brownish in color, its texture is occasionally nearly smooth but more commonly covered with mealy whitish granules that sometimes darken to brown. Orson K. Miller likened the stipe texture to that of a cow tongue. The fragile, whitish to watery tan flesh is 1‚Äì2 mm thick in the hollow cap, and sometimes forms chambers or layers near the base. The whitish to brownish sterile inner surface of the cap is covered in mealy granules. In deposit, the spores are bright yellowish orange. Ascospores are smooth, elliptical, and typically measure 20‚Äì25 by 12‚Äì16 ¬µm. Asci (spore- bearing cells) are eight-spored, cylindrical, hyaline (translucent), and measure 225‚Äì325 by 15‚Äì22.5 ¬µm. Paraphyses are septate, and cylindrical with tips that are rounded to club-shaped, and measure 150‚Äì275 by 7‚Äì15 ¬µm. Hyphal cells on sterile ridges are septate, measuring 100‚Äì175 by 10‚Äì25 ¬µm. They are tightly packed in an even layer. The terminal hyphae are club-shaped to somewhat rectangular with a flattened to broadly rounded tip. Although Morchella populiphila is an edible species, it is not as highly valued as other morels because of its fragile nature and its inferior flavor. =Similar species= Morchella populiphila is a distinct morel because of its cap attachment and its habitat, and it is unlikely to be mistaken for other species. Verpa bohemica is somewhat similar in appearance, but its cap hangs free from attachment to the stipe. The other North American half-free morel, Morchella punctipes, is very similar in appearance to M. populiphila, and they cannot be reliably distinguished on morphology alone. The distribution of M. punctipes extends from the Great Plains eastward. The widespread European species Morchella semilibera is morphologically indistinguishable from M. populiphila, in both macroscopic and microscopic characteristics. Habitat and distribution Like many morel species, the ecological mode of Morchella populiphila is not known with certainty, but it is suspected of being both saprobic (obtaining its nourishment from nonliving or decaying organic matter) and mycorrhizal (symbiotic with trees) at different stages in its life cycle. Fruit bodies grow singly, scattered, or in groups. It is found in Oregon to Nevada and northern California, where it grows on dried-out riverbeds. Fruiting, which occurs in the spring, tends to occur shortly after the emergence of Verpa mushrooms, and before the appearance of other morels. M. populiphila has been found in Europe, but is suspected to have been introduced with trees from North America.

It includes an individual's tone of voice in speech that is conveyed through changes in pitch, loudness, timbre, speech rate, and pauses. It can be isolated from semantic information, and interacts with verbal content (e.g. sarcasm). Emotional prosody in speech is perceived or decoded slightly worse than facial expressions but accuracy varies with emotions. Anger and sadness are perceived most easily, followed by fear and happiness, with disgust being the most poorly perceived. Production of vocal emotion Studies have found that some emotions, such as fear, joy and anger, are portrayed at a higher frequency than emotions such as sadness. *Anger: Anger can be divided into two types: \\"anger\\" and \\"hot anger\\". In comparison to neutral speech, anger is produced with a lower pitch, higher intensity, more energy (500 Hz) across the vocalization, higher first formant (first sound produced) and faster attack times at voice onset (the start of speech). \\"Hot anger\\", in contrast, is produced with a higher, more varied pitch, and even greater energy (2000 Hz). *Disgust: In comparison to neutral speech, disgust is produced with a lower, downward directed pitch, with energy (500 Hz), lower first formant, and fast attack times similar to anger. Less variation and shorter durations are also characteristics of disgust. *Fear: Fear can be divided into two types: \\"panic\\" and \\"anxiety\\". In comparison to neutral speech, fearful emotions have a higher pitch, little variation, lower energy, and a faster speech rate with more pauses. *Sadness: In comparison to neutral speech, sad emotions are produced with a higher pitch, less intensity but more vocal energy (2000 Hz), longer duration with more pauses, and a lower first formant. Perception of vocal emotion Decoding emotions in speech includes three (3) stages: determining acoustic features, creating meaningful connections with these features, and processing the acoustic patterns in relation to the connections established. In the processing stage, connections with basic emotional knowledge is stored separately in memory network specific to associations. These associations can be used to form a baseline for emotional expressions encountered in the future. Emotional meanings of speech are implicitly and automatically registered after the circumstances, importance and other surrounding details of an event have been analyzed. On average, listeners are able to perceive intended emotions exhibited to them at a rate significantly better than chance (chance=approximately 10%). However, error rates are also high. This is partly due to the observation that listeners are more accurate at emotional inference from particular voices and perceive some emotions better than others. Vocal expressions of anger and sadness are perceived most easily, fear and happiness are only moderately well-perceived, and disgust has low perceptibility. The brain in vocal emotions Language can be split into two components: the verbal and vocal channels. The verbal channel is the semantic content made by the speaker's chosen words. In the verbal channel, the semantic content of the speakers words determines the meaning of the sentence. The way a sentence is spoken however, can change its meaning which is the vocal channel. This channel of language conveys emotions felt by the speaker and gives us as listeners a better idea of the intended meaning. Nuances in this channel are expressed through intonation, intensity, a rhythm which combined for prosody. Usually these channels convey the same emotion, but sometimes they differ. Sarcasm and irony are two forms of humor based on this incongruent style. Neurological processes integrating verbal and vocal (prosodic) components are relatively unclear. However, it is assumed that verbal content and vocal are processed in different hemispheres of the brain. Verbal content composed of syntactic and semantic information is processed the left hemisphere. Syntactic information is processed primarily in the frontal regions and a small part of the temporal lobe of the brain while semantic information is processed primarily in the temporal regions with a smaller part of the frontal lobes incorporated. In contrast, prosody is processed primarily in the same pathway as verbal content, but in the right hemisphere. Neuroimaging studies using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) machines provide further support for this hemisphere lateralization and temporo-frontal activation. Some studies however show evidence that prosody perception is not exclusively lateralized to the right hemisphere and may be more bilateral. There is some evidence that the basal ganglia may also play an important role in the perception of prosody. Impairment of emotion recognition Deficits in expressing and understanding prosody, caused by right hemisphere lesions, are known as aprosodias. These can manifest in different forms and in various mental illnesses or diseases. Aprosodia can be caused by stroke and alcohol abuse as well. The types of aprosodia include: motor (the inability to produce vocal inflection), expressive (when brain limitations and not motor functions are the cause of this inability), and receptive (when a person cannot decipher the emotional speech). It has been found that it gets increasingly difficult to recognize vocal expressions of emotion with increasing age. Older adults have slightly more difficulty labeling vocal expressions of emotion, particularly sadness and anger than young adults but have a much greater difficulty integrating vocal emotions and corresponding facial expressions. A possible explanation for this difficulty is that combining two sources of emotion requires greater activation of emotion areas of the brain, in which adults show decreased volume and activity. Another possible explanation is that hearing loss could have led to a mishearing of vocal expressions. High frequency hearing loss is known to begin occurring around the age of 50, particularly in men. Because the right hemisphere of the brain is associated with prosody, patients with right hemisphere lesions have difficulty varying speech patterns to convey emotion. Their speech may therefore sound monotonous. In addition, people with right-hemisphere damage have been studied to be impaired when it comes to identifying the emotion in intoned sentences. Difficulty in decoding both syntactic and affective prosody is also found in people with autism spectrum disorder and schizophrenia, where \\"patients have deficits in a large number of functional domains, including social skills and social cognition. These social impairments consist of difficulties in perceiving, understanding, anticipating and reacting to social cues that are crucial for normal social interaction.\\" This has been determined in multiple studies, such as Hoekert et al.'s 2017 study on emotional prosody in schizophrenia, which illustrated that more research must be done to fully confirm the correlation between the illness and emotional prosody. However, people with schizophrenia have no problem deciphering non-emotional prosody. Non-linguistic emotional prosody Emotional states such as happiness, sadness, anger, and disgust can be determined solely based on the acoustic structure of a non-linguistic speech act. These acts can be grunts, sighs, exclamations, etc. There is some research that supports the notion that these non-linguistic acts are universal, eliciting the same assumptions even from speakers of different languages. In addition, it has been proven that emotion can be expressed in non-linguistic vocalizations differently than in speech. As Lauka et al. state: Speech requires highly precise and coordinated movement of the articulators (e.g., lips, tongue, and larynx) in order to transmit linguistic information, whereas non-linguistic vocalizations are not constrained by linguistic codes and thus do not require such precise articulations. This entails that non-linguistic vocalizations can exhibit larger ranges for many acoustic features than prosodic expressions. In their study, actors were instructed to vocalize an array of different emotions without words. The study showed that listeners could identify a wide range of positive and negative emotions above chance. However, emotions like guilt and pride were less easily recognized. In a 2015 study by Verena Kersken, Klaus Zuberb√ºhler and Juan-Carlos Gomez, non-linguistic vocalizations of infants were presented to adults to see if the adults could distinguish from infant vocalizations indicating requests for help, pointing to an object, or indicating an event. Infants show different prosodic elements in crying, depending on what they are crying for. They also have differing outbursts for positive and negative emotional states. Decipherment ability of this information was determined to be applicable across cultures and independent of the adult‚Äôs level of experience with infants. Sex differences Men and women differ in both how they use language and also how they understand it. It is known that there is a difference in the rate of speech, the range of pitch, and the duration of speech, and pitch slope (Fitzsimmons et al.). For example, \\"In a study of relationship of spectral and prosodic signs, it was established that the dependence of pitch and duration differed in men and women uttering the sentences in affirmative and inquisitive intonation. Tempo of speech, pitch range, and pitch steepness differ between the genders\\" (Nesic et al.). One such illustration is how women are more likely to speak faster, elongate the ends of words, and raise their pitch at the end of sentences. Women and men are also different in how they neurologically process emotional prosody. In an fMRI study, men showed a stronger activation in more cortical areas than female subjects when processing the meaning or manner of an emotional phrase. In the manner task, men had more activation in the bilateral middle temporal gyri. For women, the only area of significance was the right posterior cerebellar lobe. Male subjects in this study showed stronger activation in the prefrontal cortex, and on average needed a longer response time than female subjects. This result was interpreted to mean that men need to make conscious inferences about the acts and intentions of the speaker, while women may do this sub-consciously. Therefore, men needed to integrate linguistic semantics and emotional intent \\"at a higher stage than the semantic processing stage.\\" Considerations Most research regarding vocal expression of emotion has been studied through the use of synthetic speech or portrayals of emotion by professional actors. Little research has been done with spontaneous, \\"natural\\" speech samples. These artificial speech samples have been considered to be close to natural speech but specifically portrayals by actors may be influenced stereotypes of emotional vocal expression and may exhibit intensified characteristics of speech skewing listeners perceptions. Another consideration lies in listeners individual perceptions. Studies typically take the average of responses but few examine individual differences in great depth. This may provide a better insight into the vocal expressions of emotions.

Smith was born in Stockholm, New York. His father, Silas Sr., was a younger brother of Joseph Smith, Sr., which made Silas Jr. and Joseph Smith, Jr. first cousins. Silas Sr. was baptized into Smith's Church of the Latter Day Saints in 1835 and the family became followers of Smith. After Silas Sr.'s baptism, the family moved to Kirtland, Ohio. A few years later they joined the Mormon settlers in Missouri and in 1839 they were driven out and settled in Nauvoo, Illinois. In 1847, after Joseph Smith was killed, the family left Nauvoo and crossed the American plains as Mormon pioneers, settling in the Salt Lake Valley. In Utah Territory, Silas Jr. lived first in Salt Lake City and then in Farmington. In 1851, he married Clarinda Ricks, with whom he would have four children. Shortly after their marriage, Brigham Young asked the couple to settle in Parowan. Smith practiced plural marriage and in 1853 married Sarah Ann Ricks, his first wife's sister. Smith and Sarah Ricks would have five children. In 1854 to 1856, Smith was a missionary for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter- day Saints (LDS Church) in Hawaii, where he learned to speak the Hawaiian language. After he returned from Hawaii, Smith and his wives and children moved to Paragonah, Utah. Smith was a military leader in the Black Hawk War. In 1859, Smith was elected as a representative in the Utah Territorial Legislature, where he served until 1878. Smith was also a deputy U.S. Marshal, a probate judge, and a bishop of the LDS Church in Paragonah. After the death of both of his wives within months of each other, Smith married Martha Eliza Bennet in 1864. Smith and Bennet would have 12 children together. In 1879, Smith was asked by the LDS Church to become the president of the San Juan Mission of the church in southern Utah. In this capacity, he was asked to locate a suitable spot for a Mormon settlement on the San Juan River. Smith led the San Juan Expedition via the Hole in the Rock Trail, establishing the settlement of Bluff. Smith remained president of the San Juan Mission until 1882. In April 1880, Smith became a member of the LDS Church's Council of Fifty. After his term as president of the San Juan Mission, the LDS Church asked Smith to move to Colorado. From 1883 to 1892, he was the president of the San Luis Stake in Conejos, Colorado. He lived in Colorado until 1900, when he moved to Layton, Utah. Smith died in Layton of heart troubles.State of Utah Death Certificate . Smith was the father of a total of 21 children with three wives.

The book explains to children that people having different looks or different-sounding names does not mean they are terrorists (i.e., having the intention of blowing the reader up). I Don't Want To Blow You Up! depicts thirteen people (eleven real, two fictional), with biographical information, and a declaration that they do not want to blow up the reader. The book received mixed criticism, including the authors' receiving a cease-and-desist letter on behalf of Kareem Abdul-Jabbar for his unauthorized depiction. Background Hastie (left) and Cort√©s, as drawn by Cort√©s According to the authors, I Don't Want To Blow You Up! was written to teach children to not be afraid of people with names that may be similar to those of terrorists. When Cort√©s and Hastie began the book they intended to seek permission from everyone depicted in the book (eleven real people and two fictional). Keith Ellison (a Muslim Congressman) declined their request, claiming that as a Congressman he was not allowed to participate. On the advice of their lawyer Cort√©s and Hastie decided to move forward with the book without consent from the people they were depicting; in the end only four people were asked for consent to use their likeness. The authors believed that consent would not be required because the information is biographical in nature, and they are not introducing any information that is not already known. However, Cort√©s and Hastie received a \\"cease-and-desist letter\\" from Kareem Abdul-Jabbar's lawyers for unauthorized use of the basketball player's likeness. Cort√©s has illustrated other works including Go the Fuck to Sleep, and wrote and illustrated a children's book on marijuana, It's Just a Plant. Hastie's other works include a book about Tillamook Cheddar, his pet dog who has gained notoriety as an artist. Content 150px The book presents thirteen people who are not terrorists, even though people may assume they are either because of their name or what they look like. They include Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Nas (Nasir Bin Olu Dara Jones), Tariq Ramadan, Anousheh Ansari, and a child named Osama (who wants to become a judge for the Supreme Court of the United States, despite being frequently asked if he is a terrorist). The book also contains biographical information including confirmation that the subject \\"doesn't want to blow you up\\". Reception The New York Times referred to the illustrations as \\"graceful\\". University of Alberta political science professor Thomas Butko offered criticism, claiming the authors' belief that children stereotype Muslims as terrorists has an adverse effect on the good they are trying to do by publishing the book. The Ottawa Citizen wrote that it was sad that the authors \\"found it necessary to write a book reassuring children that people who look different are not going to blow them up\\", and \\"if the little reader wasn't afraid before, he or she probably is now\\".

This episode originally aired on ABC on April 11, 2012. It was written by Ben Karlin, and directed by Bryan Cranston. Plot The day of the council elections, for which Claire (Julie Bowen) is running, has come and everyone in the family is assigned a task to help her get as many votes as possible. Cameron (Eric Stonestreet) and Mitchell (Jesse Tyler Ferguson) campaign for Claire in a truck with a loud speaker from which they urge people to vote for Claire. They do really well till the moment Cameron sees someone tossing a tissue on the street instead of the garbage can that is right next to them. Cameron gets upset and shouts to the man via the speaker to pick it up. When the man does it, they realize the power of the microphone and they begin using it for reasons unrelated to Claire's campaign. When they see a friend named Sandy (Melinda Page Hamilton) on the street, they start commenting her fianc√© and saying that he is gay. The only problem is that the microphone is on and Sandy, along with everyone else on the street, hears the ‚Äúprivate‚Äù conversation. Now they have to convince Sandy that her fianc√© is not gay. Phil's (Ty Burrell) task is to drive 50 senior citizens to the polls to vote for Claire but he only manages to transport one, their neighbor and Luke's (Nolan Gould) best friend Walt (Philip Baker Hall). Walt first remembers that he needs his glasses to be able to vote and then his oxygen tank needs to be changed. Phil is willing to take him back home to change it, but Walt does not have a second one at home so they need to go and buy one. Later, Walt needs food to take his pills and he will not vote until he eats and has his pills. The result is that the polls close and Phil gets only one extra vote for Claire instead of fifty. Meanwhile, Alex (Ariel Winter) is in charge of the phone banks and she supervises everyone so they do their part right but no one seems to do it right. Luke promises that if they vote for Claire they will not have to pay taxes again and Alex tries to explain to him that he can not say that. Gloria (Sof√≠a Vergara) finds it difficult to convince people to vote for Claire via the phone when in person is much easier and Alex explains to her that that's exactly the reason; in person they can actually see her. Manny (Rico Rodriguez) is the only one who manages to get some people to vote for Claire while Haley (Sarah Hyland) is worried about other things since she has been rejected from all five colleges she applied to and she did not tell anyone. There is only one left for which she is afraid to open the letter. Jay (Ed O'Neill) does not really have a task, he just needs to vote. While going to the polls with Gloria and Manny, he sees that a woman he slept with is working the polls and he runs away. He later explains to Gloria why he left. Dottie (Stephanie Faracy) is the first woman he dated after his divorce and the way he ended it was not the best. He returns to the polls and tries to vote while Dottie is not there but he runs into her the moment he has to put his ballot in the box. Dottie takes the ballot and she refuses to put it in the box. As a result, Jay does not even vote for his daughter. In the meantime, Claire is being interviewed at the polls by a local newspaper reporter who does not even recognize her as the candidate. Before the reporter takes a picture of her, Alex notices a tag sticking out of Claire's suit. Claire bites it off but she loses her fake front tooth (due to an old ice-skating accident). The reporter takes the picture with Claire missing her tooth but that is not the only problem since without the tooth Claire sounds drunk when she talks something that also does not help with the radio interview she has later on. The night, despite the catastrophic day, everyone is gathered at the Dunphy house for the election results party while waiting for the outcome. Claire takes a moment to thank everyone for their help and what they did during the day to get her more votes since she does not know that they did not really help much. While speaking, she gets a phone call where they inform her that she lost the election. Everyone hugs her and Phil changes the ‚ÄúCongratulations Claire‚Äù sign to ‚ÄúCondolences Claire‚Äù. Claire goes to the kitchen to get a glass of wine and Haley follows her to tell her about the college letters and that she has only one last chance left. Haley is afraid to open it and Claire reassures her that no matter what the letter says they will still love her and she can always try the next year. The entire family is also there, they hear the conversation and they totally agree with Claire. Haley opens the letter and she finds out that she made the waiting list. Everyone is happy with that since it is better than nothing. At the end of the episode, despite her loss, we see that Claire finally gets the STOP sign she asked for (and was the reason she decided to run for town council after the council himself rejected her proposal). However, a car then drives past it without stopping, so she decides that the road needs speed bumps.

Often made of thick fabric, they are designed with either an unsewn seam over the buttocks and crotch or a hole over the central buttocks. Both allow children to urinate and defecate without the pants being lowered. The child simply squats, or is held by the parent, eliminating the need for diapers. The sight of the partially exposed buttocks of kaidangku-clad children in public places frequently astonishes foreign visitors, who often photograph them; they have been described as being \\"as much a sign of China as Chairman Mao's portrait looming over Tiananmen Square.\\" In China they are often seen as a relic of the country's rural past, with younger mothers, particularly in cities, preferring to diaper their children instead. However, Western advocates of the elimination communication method of toilet training have pointed to the advantages of their use, specifically that children complete their toilet training more quickly and at an earlier age. Other benefits claimed include the elimination of diaper rash and reduction of the environmental problems caused by disposable diapers. Some Western parents have even begun putting their own children in kaidangku. Use Toilet training begins very early in China, sometimes within days of birth and usually no later than a month. Frequently babies are held closely by parents, grandparents or other extended family members caring for them, sensitive to when they need to relieve themselves. A child who appears ready to urinate or defecate is held over the toilet or any other receptacle available if a commode cannot be reached in time. The adult makes a high- pitched soft whistle while holding the child in a b«é (), or bunched-up position, a term sometimes used for the whole process, imitating the sound of running water or urine, to get the child to relax the appropriate muscles. Open-crotch pants for 3- to 6-month-olds, for sale in alt=A set of children's pajamas lying on a bright surface with a price tag still attached. The top is white with blue decoration; the pants are light blue with white trim. They are open on both sides of the crotch Open-crotch pants are worn when the child is first taken out of the house. Mostly male children wear them; girls (and occasionally some boys) are put in infant-size sundresses. Their use continues even after wearers have gained some control over their bodily functions, since they may not have yet gained the stature or motor skills necessary to use a toilet. Instead, when outdoors, they use a wastebasket or large potted plant. If neither of those is available, caretakers often let the children use the sidewalk or any other available uncovered surface and clean it up themselves afterwards. History In 2003 The New York Times described open-crotch pants as having been in use in China for \\"decades\\". Seven years earlier, in her memoir Red China Blues, Chinese Canadian journalist Jan Wong speculates that their use evolved from chronic shortages of cloth, soap and water. While those items were in short supply, \\"people weren't\\" she wrote. \\"Someone was always available to ba a Chinese baby.\\" Their use continued during the 20th century as China modernized in other ways. During the later years of Mao Zedong's rule, brightly colored kaidangku on the streets of Beijing offered a sharp contrast to the austere blue and gray tones of adult clothing prescribed by the Cultural Revolution. Even after the economic liberalizations promoted by Deng Xiaoping in the subsequent decades and the ensuing introduction of more Western culture and ideas, they remained in use for the vast majority of children in the People's Republic of China. When Wong, then a Chinese correspondent for Toronto's The Globe and Mail, bore a son in Beijing in 1990, only one hotel in the city sold disposable diapers. Since they charged US$1 apiece, she decided to toilet-train him the traditional Chinese way. Western manufacturers of consumer products, including disposable diapers, continued to push for entry into the vast Chinese market. In 1998 the American company Procter & Gamble (P&G;) was able to introduce its popular Pampers brand to China; competitors soon followed. However, Chinese parents at first saw no reason to abandon kaidangku for diapers, and the company struggled to gain market share. After re-engineering its diapers to be softer and selling them at a lower price than it offered them for in the U.S., P&G; launched its \\"Golden Sleep\\" campaign in 2007 suggested by its market research, with advertisements claiming that babies slept better in diapers, which could in turn be better for their cognitive development. Even before that, attitudes had begun to change. Within five years of Pampers' introduction, about $200 million in disposable diapers were being sold in China annually, and many manufacturers reported their sales were growing by double-digit percentages. One of the foreign manufacturers, Japan's Unicharm, said in 2002 that its MamyPoko brand was so popular it was planning to build a plant in China to make them. The shift in attitudes had drastically reduced the use of open- crotch pants‚Äîupscale retailers no longer carried them, and Chinese parenting magazines depicted babies wearing diapers exclusively. Attitudes among Chinese had changed, as well. Mothers the Times talked to in 2003 dismissed kaidangku as out of step with the values of China's growing middle class. \\"Split pants? That's so old-fashioned!\\" one Shanghai woman said. \\"It's not hygienic. It's bad for the environment. Only poor people who live on farms wear them.\\" A Guangzhou woman quoted in China Daily a year later agreed, calling them \\"uncivilized\\". People who could afford to buy diapers for their children did so, she asserted, and a Beijing post-natal care center advised mothers to use diapers no matter what the cost. Zhao Zhongxin, an education professor at Beijing Normal University, said open-crotch pants had become an indicator of socioeconomic status in the new China. \\"Children in the cities do not wear kaidangku anymore. But children in the countryside still do,\\" he told China Daily. \\"This is the difference between the minds and living conditions of rural people and urban people,\\" who, the paper added, might also be more mindful of city-government campaigns for cleaner public spaces overall, especially prior to the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, which included exhortations to parents to diaper their children at least for the duration of the Games. A spokeswoman for domestic diaper maker Goodbaby admitted to the newspaper that it was harder to overcome resistance to diaper use outside cities. \\"Some people, especially farmers, may think they are too wasteful.\\" alt=A walking boy, seen from behind, with a diaper visible through the open seam in the buttocks area of his denim overalls Other mothers used both open- crotch pants and diapers depending on the situation. In 2003 the Times reported that they were still frequently seen on hot days in Shanghai, although they were no longer ubiquitous in those conditions. A Zhejiang woman who ran a fruit stand in the city told the newspaper that she dressed her son in them only in that weather, since it was more comfortable for him and reduced the risk of diaper rash. And one Beijing mother whom China Daily spoke to while she watched her kaidangku-clad son at a Beijing playground dismissed opposition to the pants. \\"Even if people don't think it looks good, that's a minority opinion,\\" she said. \\"This is a Chinese tradition.\\" By the end of the decade Pampers had become the top-selling diaper brand in China. Foreign and domestic observers alike confidently predicted the demise of kaidangku. In 2010 Brandchannel called them \\"a fading memory.\\" Yet reports from China early in the next decade suggested their use continued. Advantages and disadvantages Despite the increasing prevalence of diaper use, which became a $3-billion industry in the country by 2010, enough Chinese parents still use open-crotch pants, or consider doing so, for parenting websites in that language to list their benefits and detriments to better help parents make an informed decision. Among the former are that their use offsets the infant's inability to communicate, eliminates the need for scheduled toileting times and greatly reduces the need to wash soiled clothing. Most frequently cited is the ability to begin and finish toilet training earlier. It is not uncommon for infants in kaidangku to begin being toilet trained before their first birthday and be fully trained around that milestone or shortly afterwards, before most of their Western counterparts have even begun. During a 1981 visit to a Beijing preschool, Fox Butterfield, then a Chinese correspondent for The New York Times, reported that he expressed skepticism from his own contemporaneous parenting experience over the possibility that children that young could be successfully toilet trained, only to have it immediately dispelled by a 14-month-old girl's timely use of the spittoon provided for her. However, parents are cautioned that kaidangku can be dirtier, leading to a higher risk of problems like urethritis, cystitis and other complications of urinary tract infections. Children in them are also believed to face a higher risk of frostbite in winter, and 163.com warns that boys with easy access to their exposed genitals \\"can easily develop bad habits.\\" Goodbaby, the Shanghai-based diaper maker, lists some other problems with open-crotch pants on its website. In addition to the medical, sanitary and environmental drawbacks, it says that they show no respect for the child's privacy and that he may in the future be embarrassed by photographs of himself wearing them, particularly as they become less common. While it admits that kaidangku use results merely from different cultural values and not ignorance, it counsels, \\"we must admit foreign practices are more rigorous and show more respect for the child.\\" Wong, in her memoir, describes another negative side effect. In the early 1990s, she reported on China's leading penis-enlargement surgeon. Many of his patients were men who, as children on farms, suffered serious injury to their organs when they squatted in their open-crotch pants in areas where dogs or pigs ate their own feces and the animals bit the boys' penises in the confusion. Some had never married because of the injury. \\"China desperately needed a Pampers factory, or at least a dog-food industry,\\" she wrote.Wong, 505. Lastly, in his 1996 memoir The Attic, artist Guanlong Cao recalls an incidental benefit of kaidangku to his parents: Use in West As Chinese parents were migrating from kaidangku to diapers, some Western parents were going in the opposite direction, concerned about the environmental impact of used disposable diapers and the health effects on the child. In her 2006 book Diaper Free, Ingrid Bauer bemoaned the marketing success of diaper manufacturers in China. \\"The traditional kaidangku have rapidly disappeared from the major cities in the last half-decade and are rapidly being replaced by diapers ... Aggressive advertisers create an impression that consumer products are vastly superior to what mothers have practiced for eons and urge parents to buy what they can barely afford,\\" she wrote. Around that same time, inspired by the Chinese example, parents in the U.S. and other Western countries began forming \\"diaper-free\\" support groups and practicing elimination communication toilet training on younger babies, using the ba whistling sound to incite urination. Some that The New York Times talked to in 2005 suggested they had gone to that city's Chinatown to purchase open-crotch pants for their own children. Western parents working in China also saw the use of kaidangku up close, and in some cases decided to emulate Chinese methods in toilet training their own children.

History In 1849, the Quinta das Louras (or Quinta das Loureiras) was acquired by D. Ermelinda Allen de Almeida (then Viscountess of Regaleira) from Jo√£o Ver√≠ssimo de Barros Viana and his wife, D. Maria In√°cia dos Santos. The name of the quinta (estate) was within a short time changed to Beau-S√©jour; the house was constructed following purchase of the estate by the Viscountess, and featured a landscaped French formal garden. In 1859, the estate was sold by D. Isabel Allen Palmeiro, Baroness of Regaleira (niece and heiress to the Viscountess), to Ant√≥nio Jos√© Leite Guimar√£es, Baron of Gl√≥ria (1806-1876). The Baron ultimately proceeded to repair the azulejos tiles (using tile from the Roseira tile factory). Following his death (1876), Beau-S√©jour passed into the hands of his nephew and niece, Jos√© Leite Guimar√£es and Maria da Gl√≥ria Leite. The Baron had made his fortune in Rio de Janeiro before returning to Portugal. The next few years would see an investment and artistic enrichment of the pal√°cio‚Äîwith contributions by Francisco Vila√ßa, Columbano, Rafael and Maria Augusta Bordalo Pinheiro‚Äîby his heirs. In the 1930s, following the death of D. Maria da Gl√≥ria Leite, Beau-S√©jour passed into the hands of her goddaughter and her husband (Augusto Fernandes de Almeida). Ultimately, most of the contents were sold at auction, along with the estate, which came into the possession of the Marist Brothers, who established a college in the pal√°cio. This was a short-lived venture, after which the municipal council of Lisbon eventually acquired the estate in the 1980s. There were alterations to the interior of the house, conforming to the change in the function of the building: there was a subdivision of internal spaces, between the two towers on the first floor, including updated wallpaper on the walls. In addition, the azulejo tiles in the kitchen were replaced with adhesive plastic, and the garden's greenhouse was rebuilt, initially from wooden slats. Between 1989 and 1992, work was undertaken to restore the building by the municipal council of Lisbon, under the direction of architect Jorge Matos Alves, with the objective of adapting Beau-S√©jour for the municipal agency concerned with the study of Lisbon heritage, the GEO (Gabinete de Estudos Olisiponenses). This included the restoration of deteriorated elements of the architecture of the building: expanding the rooms, transforming the basement into a library/archive, and dividing the pantry space into two washrooms. On the first floor a metal staircase was installed in the east wing and the attic was expanded, particularly in the north section. Attempts were made to restore the ceiling paintings (in the gold hall, dining room, music room and gallery), in addition to ceramic panels and dining room light fixture, a work by Rafael Bordalo Pinheiro. Other repairs included painting the walls, doors and window frames and restoration of the decorative stucco on the ceilings and the crown moulding. Frames and awnings of the old games room were replaced and the patio around the pal√°cio was repaved. Meanwhile, landscape architect Luisa Ferraz (commissioned by the Lisbon city council) began to restore the plant species, and re-establish the paths and circulatory routes, based on the old photographs of Beau-S√©jour. At the same time, the small building constructed by the Marist Brothers was demolished (thereby leaving the small fern- encircled waterfall unrestricted), while the doorway to the Estrada de Benfica in the wall was unblocked. In 1992, the GEO occupied and installed their offices in the building following extensive renovation work. On 20 February 2014, the perimeter of the estate was altered, and it was classified to include only the residence and walled garden, which led to a change in the official designation; the classification was limited to the part of the estate consisting of around the house (Dispatch 132/2014; Di√°rio da Rep√∫blica, S√©rie II, 36). Architecture The estate with its longitudinal residence plan is composed of articulated volumes covered in roofing tile, that includes two- storey lateral wings and central single-storey main body decorated in blue azulejo tile. Along with the lateral wings, the two-storey high building is encircled by a patio and includes bow windows (semi-circular bay windows) on the second level. On the central rectangular portion are seven Gothic-style French doors, surmounted by a semi-circular pediment. The Baron of Gl√≥ria extensively remodelled the pal√°cio, in the Art Nouveau style that included the elaborate azulejo tiles over the facade, along with Moorish features. Various sculptures were scattered through the garden. The plan of the Beau S√©jour house is organized along two axes: the first, dominant, is the corridor that extends east to west, with two staircases to the first floor wings. The second axis (oriented north to south), front to rear, is created by two vestibules, the principal and posterior, connected by a corridor. The first floor of the wings comprise two connected spaces. On the ground floor the reception area for the Gabinete de Estudos Olisiponenses is in the former living room of the pal√°cio, and GEO workspaces are in the former library and in a dressing room connected to the former bedroom, within the bow window. The old gallery and painting rooms were transformed into the GEO library catalogue room (decorated by Francisco Vila√ßa in the Renaissance style that included the painted ceiling of the allegories of painting and sculpture). The former Golden Hall/Salon is the most notable space in the house, and includes the grand tapestry by Columbano Bordalo Pinheiro, \\"O Carnaval de Veneza\\", that is today used for the library reading rooms. The old music room (with decoration inspired by classical mythology) was also transformed into a reading room and decorated by Francisco Vila√ßa, who executed stuccos of musical instruments. A small vestibule that led to the old dining room is decorated by a grand ceramic panel created by Rafael Bordalo Pinheiro and executed by the F√°brica de Faian√ßas in Caldas da Rainha, that includes a small fountain. The former dining room was decorated by the three Bordalo Pinheiro brothers: Columbano (who covered the walls with tiles which were later sold at auction), Rafael (a ceramic lamp and crown moulding, decorated with vegetal forms); and Maria Augusta (an L-shaped panel painted in floral patterns in the ceiling corners). The former dining room has been converted into a conference and exposition hall, along with the window-lined former games room. The garden, that extends from the palace toward the Estrada de Benfica, is a miniature Romantic garden. This includes an irregular large reflecting pool, that is navigable and includes a small island connected by metal bridges.

He dragged her to a church's bathroom and knocked her unconcious when she struggled. Cho raped and beat Nayoung anally, vaginally, and sodomized her. He held her head under water to knock her out again. He left her on the floor with cold water running and left the scene. Nayoung was found by her parents and was taken to a hospital. She had injuries to her internal organs, but she survived the incident. Cho left evidence all over the scene and still had her blood on himself when he was arrested. He was sentenced to twelve years in prison. The case sparked outrage and protests involving Na-young's parents and many others. In 2011, R&B; singer ALi released a song based on Na-young's story, titled \\"Nayoungee.\\" The song attracted controversy after being widely criticized, and ALi chose to omit it from her upcoming album. She also subsequently issued an apology. ALi then went on to say that the song was also about her own battle with being a rape victim. The 2013 film Hope is based on this case.  Cho's Background  Cho Doo-soon was born October 18, 1952. He dropped out of middle school and in 1970, he committed his first crime, stealing a bicycle. He was given leniency because of his young age and because it was a small scale crime. In 1972 He was sentenced to 1 year and 6 months in a youth detention center for extorting money from a street stall. In 1977 he was sentenced to 8 months in prison for habitual theft. In 1983 at age 31 he raped a 19 year old woman who worked nearby where he lived, she needed 30 days of treatment to recover. He was sentenced to 3 years in prison for this crime. After his release he was fined several times for various violent crimes, including assaulting a bar hostess. In 1995 while drinking Cho assaulted a man in his 60s to death because he praised Chun Doo-hwan, a controversial president. Because he was deemed feeble-minded, he was sentenced to 2 years and admitted into a psychiatric hospital. Cho‚Äôs only family is his wife, who has nothing but praise for him. Cho‚Äôs wife said \\"Cooking rice and side dishes, cleaning the home and all the household work. ‚Ä¶ My husband has done it for 20 years...He has never vented his anger and he has been hailed as a polite person.\\" While married Cho committed 11 out of his 18 total crimes. For most of his crimes he was drunk and gave the excuse that he ‚Äúdoes not remember,‚Äù Cho‚Äôs wife said that he only committed crimes because of alcohol.  Aftermath  Nayoung was left with permanent damage to her lower abdomen and was told she would be permanently disabled, she needed 8 months of treatment and had to take trips to Seoul every weekend. She was told she would need to use a colostomy bag for the rest of her life but underwent a successful surgery to implement an artificial anus. Nayoung also suffered from depression and mental stress after the attack. Nayoung, then 8 years old, was made to sit upright with her colostomy bag while testifying in court and explaining the incident which caused more psychological stress. She received 13 million won in compensation because of violations against the interview policy for victims of sexual assault. A year after the assault after receiving psychiatric treatment she was said to have recovered 70 percent. She started attending school again and even attended a hagwon across the street from the place of incidence. According to her father from a report in 2020 she only watches cartoons and avoids news completely to avoid any possible chance of seeing something sexual assault related.  Reaction and influence  Politicians are introducing bills to try and prevent criminals from reoffending for sex crimes against minors. Kim Young-ho from the democratic party said, \\"The special bill on life imprisonment for criminals who recommit sexual crimes against minors, which I introduced, aims to isolate those who recommit the same crime after release permanently from society.\\" The Ministry of Justice attempted to pass the Protective Supervision Act, which would put more extreme criminals into a facility away from society after their term in prison ends. In 2014 and 2016 the ministry attempted to turn this bill into a law but received backlash for being a violation of human rights. Lawmaker Ko Young-in suggested a law that will restrict sex criminals from going farther than 200 meters from their home. Laws to keep sex criminals like Cho away from facilities with kids and to keep him from being able to drink alcohol have also been suggested in response to this case. In response to Cho's impending release, 2 petitions for getting rid of the laws that weaken prison sentences for crimes committed while drunk and crimes committed by mentally impaired people, have received 876,000 signatures. Both petitions were refused as they said they could not fill laws with passion. In response to the case a book, and movie titled Hope were made in 2013. It won several awards and reignited attention about the case. The film also received a lot of criticism for making profit out of someone's tragedy and bringing attention to someone who wants to live a quiet life.  Trial and controversy  Cho was originally sentenced to life in prison but after Nayoung testified that he smelled like alcohol his sentenced was reduced as he was not sound of mind while commiting the crime his sentence was reduced to 12 years in prison. Cho wrote over 300 times ‚ÄúI am not the type of a sick monster who rapes an 8-year- old girl,‚Äù to the judge. Na-young's parents filed a lawsuit against the prosecution for subjecting their daughter to physical and psychological distress. The prosecution questioned her right after she came out of surgery and made her sit upright and answer the same questions four times due to the prosecutors making mistakes while recording. They violated protocol in obtaining testimony from a minor by taping her in public. Prosecution also failed to show the arrest videotape of Cho which would have eliminated the need for her to take the witness stand. In 2011, the government payed 13 million won in compensation to Na-young for violations by the prosecution. After news of his sentencing was released many petitions were left on the Blue House's website calling for a retrial.  Release  Cho is set to be released on December 13, 2020. He will return to Ansan to live with his wife less than 1km away from the victim's house. Nayoung's father has said that he would be willing to take out a loan to give money to Cho so Cho can leave Ansan. Cho said \\"I am sorry for my crimes, and if I am released, I will live quietly without causing controversy.\\" He will have to wear an ankle monitor and will be under constant surveillance on probation for 7 years. His probation officer will also be able to make random visits to his home. Despite wearing an electronic ankle bracelet there have been cases of criminals in Korea who were able to escape the country. 71 security cameras will be placed around Ansan for the safety of residents who fear Cho's release.

The function of the \\"beehive\\" coke ovens was to purify coal and turn it into coke. The coke was burned in furnaces that produced iron and steel. The site, also known as Cherry Valley Coke Ovens Arboretum, was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1993. An Ohio Historical Marker was added in 1999. Outside of the Connellsville Coke District in Pennsylvania, this site represents one of the largest remaining site of intact beehive coke ovens in North America. History In the early 1860s, Irish businessman William Lee discovered rich deposits of coal, ore and lime under the soil of today's Leetonia. Lee began to buy the surrounding land and established the company \\"The Leetonia Coal & Iron Company\\" which consisted of a coal mine, coke ovens, and a blast furnace. This company jumped into the iron and coal industry and soon turned the area into a thriving company town. The area went from housing three families in 1864 to 1,800 people by 1869 when it was incorporated. The coke production was the main operation of the company. Leetonia Coal & Iron would mine the surrounding areas for coal and then cart coal by the tons into the coke ovens on rails above the ovens. The workers would then shovel the coal into the coke ovens to cook. This would purify the coal into a purer product of coal called coke which was then shipped off to the iron mills to be used in smelting iron. Coke has a much higher temperature point than regular coal so it was preferred for use in the mills. Each coke oven is about 12 feet in diameter and 6 to 7 feet in height with the capacity to hold two to three tons of coal each. While still using 100 ovens, Leetonia Coal & Iron would process 250 tons of coal into coke per day. However, in 1873, the company was bought out and renamed \\"The Cherry Valley Iron and Coal Company\\", who expanded operations and eventually had over 200 coke ovens and 4 blast furnaces; processing much more coal than ever before. Financial troubles hit the company during the Great Depression and the ovens were closed permanently. The site was donated to the village of Leetonia for a park in 1982, and, in 1986, the village council appointed a commission to transform the area into a park. Restoration and park The village of Leetonia developed the Cherry Valley Coke Ovens Park on the site. The area is heavily wooded area with hiking trails in and around the coke ovens and other sites of the former Cherry Valley Iron & Coal Co. The project was undertaken by the village of Leetonia to protect the site of a large part of the village's history.

It is one of 5 large contemporaneous village sites located in a section of the river. The site was a satellite village associated with the Coosa chiefdom centered on the Little Egypt Site located upstream. Site description The site is a village located on the eastern bank of the Coosa River at Foster Bend and dating from the mid-sixteenth century. The village is basically square in layout ( in length on each side) and surrounded by a ditch and palisade on three sides and the Coosa River to the north. At the center of the town was a large plaza, at the center of which was a post measuring almost in diameter at its base and probably to high. In between the plaza and the encircling palisade was a village area, with approximately 47 houses and a number of elevated maize storage facilities. The house structures were rectangular with rounded corners and dugout basin floors. These houses were built using single set-post constructions covered in wattle and daub. They probably had peaked, thatched roofs and averaged about in area. The floors were dug into the ground to , and the earth removed from the holes was piled onto the outside walls of the house. The insides of the houses had four roof- support posts set in a central square. Smaller interior walls of wattle and daub walls separated the interior areas beyond the central square into work, storage and sleeping areas. The entrance to these structures had low embanked walls, possibly designed to keep water, dirt and debris from washing into the dugout floors during rainy periods. The elevated corn cribs stood or so above ground level and would have been used to store food stuffs; they also created shaded areas for activities during the hot summer months. These two types of structures may represent summer and winter habitations, a situation known from ethnographic sources from the Southeast. Often two or three winter houses and their accompanying summer open-air structures were arranged around a central courtyard area, indicating a larger household unit and possibly depicting an extended family situation. This arrangement was similar to the larger pattern of plaza and village layout. Located inside the northeast quadrant of the plaza area (separated from the village area) were two special-use structures, probably used as public buildings. The first, labeled structure #17 by archaeologists, was square structure which measured on its sides and had benches inside. The remains of ten adult males were found buried beneath the floor of this structure. It was a probably a meeting or council house. The second, labeled structure #16, is smaller. Archaeologists have so far been unable to determine its exact function. Archaeologists estimate that between 277 to 517 people lived in the village. As the site was inhabited for 50 years or less, no monumental platform mounds were constructed there. If occupation had lasted longer, succeeding generations of inhabitants may have erected these kinds of structures over the council house or structure #16, as was the pattern in many larger Mississippian culture sites occupied for longer periods of time. Site history Proposed de Soto expedition route through Georgia The site was first inhabited during the first half of the sixteenth century when a half a dozen or so domestic structures were raised at the site. Over the next ten years as the town grew, the people delineated a defensive perimeter, plaza, and habitation zone. The site seems to have had a definite layout from its inception, a pattern followed by other similar settlements in the area. After about another 20 or 30 years the town was abandoned. During this time period, the Hernando de Soto (1540) and the Tristan de Luna (1560) expeditions visited the area, and it is extremely likely that one of the expeditions visited the site. Many items of European manufacture, such as iron tools, were found during excavations of the site. It is not known for sure if the Spaniards were the reason for the site's abandonment. Examination of the numerous graves found at the site provided evidence that an epidemic had the struck the population, although views on this in the archaeological community are divided. Excavations The site was excavated in 1992 and 1993 by David Hally of the University of Georgia and Patrick Garrow of Shorter University in Rome, Georgia.

Her work was influenced by Surrealism. She was the wife of painter Mikul√°≈° Medek.  Biography  Medkov√° was born in √öst√≠ nad Orlic√≠. Her father was a typographer and her mother was a seamstress. The family moved to Prague, where, in 1942, Emila began to attend the class of the landscape photographer Josef Ehm at a specialized photography school in the Sm√≠chov district of Prague. Her work has been directly linked to Surrealism. In the early period, she joined a circle of young artists centered around Karel Teige. From 1947 to 1951, she and Mikul√°≈° Medek created collections of staged photographs. She married him on 12 September 1951. From the early 1950s, she focused on creating several loosely overlapping thematic cycles that went through her whole career, up to her death. At the turn of the 1950s and 1960s, she became a leading exponent of the Czech Informel photography. Although she found inspiration mainly in Prague, she created extensive photographic cycles of Paris (1966) and Italy (1967). The life and work of Medkov√° were covered in a monograph designed by art historians Karel Srp and Lenka Byd≈æovsk√°, curators of her first comprehensive exhibition, held in 2001. Medkov√° gave only one interview in her life. It was initiated by the renowned art historian Anna F√°rov√° and published in 1976 in the magazine ƒåeskoslovensk√° fotografie (Czechoslovak Photography). After the death of her husband (Medek died in 1974), she suffered a stroke and was partially paralyzed.

She was also a teacher and philanthropic activist in England and Ireland. Hannah Kilham, silhouette portrait. Early life She was born at Sheffield on 12 August 1774, the seventh child of Peter and Hannah Spurr, in trade there. Brought up in the Church of England, she was permitted to attend John Wesley's early morning services. Her mother's death when she was twelve (1786) had placed her at the head of the household, which consisted of her father and five brothers. Two years later her father died, and she was sent to a boarding-school at Chesterfield. At the age of 20 she joined the Wesleyans. On 12 April 1798 Hannah Spurr became the second wife of Alexander Kilham, founder of the Methodist New Connexion, who died at Nottingham eight months later (20 December 1798). Hannah Kilham opened a day-school in Nottingham, spending her vacations at Epworth, her husband's early home. There she became acquainted with Quakers, and in 1802 joined the Society of Friends. Activist and missionary In Sheffield, while still teaching, Kilham became involved in philanthropic work. She started a Society for the Bettering of the Condition of the Poor, which was imitated elsewhere. In 1817 Kilham began work on unwritten languages of West Africa, with the aim of spreading Christianity. She produced an elementary grammar for the children in missionary schools at Sierra Leone. From two African sailors who were being educated at Tottenham, she acquired a knowledge of the Jaloof (Wolof) and Mandingo (Mandinka) languages, and in 1820 printed anonymously First Lessons in Jaloof. Kilham induced the Society of Friends to set up an unofficial African Instruction Fund Committee, in existence 1819 to 1825, with female representation. The committee, on which William Allen and Luke Howard sat, as a preliminary sent William Singleton to West Africa. =First African visit= In October 1823, under the auspices of the Friends' committee for promoting African instruction, she sailed with three Quaker missionaries and the two African sailors for St. Mary's, in the Gambia. Here she started a school, using her knowledge of Wolof. She taught also at Sierra Leone. Kilham had an Irish assistant in Sierra Leone, Ann Thompson of Cooladine, also a Quaker. In July 1824 she returned to England to report to the committee of Friends. In 1826 she was working in Spitalfields, on education, employment and health issues. She brought in Thomas Hodgkin to help with widespread disease, though there was little they could do. Kilham then went to Ireland, and spent some months with the British and Irish Ladies' Society for famine relief. Noted documentation of Hannah Kilham and other individuals that made heroic attempts to the spread of Christianity in the western sections of Africa can be further researched in the book, \\"West African Christianity ‚Äì the religious Impact, by author Lamin Sanneh, pg.66 =Second African visit= On 11 November 1827 Kilham once more sailed for Sierra Leone, taking with her a number of African School Tracts (London, 1827), which she had published. She visited Free Town and the villages around; and in two or three months compiled word lists in 25 languages.

He spent much of his time in Travancore. He was the first child of Gottlieb Ringeltaube, Vicar of Scheidelwitz (today Szydlowice), near Brzeg, in Silesia. He was born on 8 August 1770. The cause and date of his death are uncertain, but it is widely believed that he died of liver failure whilst on a voyage to Africa. Others believe that he was killed by the natives whilst on a mission to Jakarta (then called Batavia). Early life Five days after his birth he was baptized and given the name William Tobias Ringeltaube. For seven years Ringeltaube grew up in the quietness of a country home; after this his father went to Warsaw in Poland, and spent nine years in the city. During this time, William was educated by his father before attending the University of Halle. When he was 16, his father became a Court Preacher and General Superintendent at Oels, in Silesia. There, the young boy attended the Gymnaesium, but the boy was naturally shy and shunned all interaction with fellow students. In his 18th year he went on a walking tour, on which he made many friends. During this time, he made the decision to become a Christian missionary. Ordained in Wernigerode in 1796, he spent some time in Calcutta and England before he was invited by the London Missionary Society to join their 1803 mission to India. Ministry Maharasan Vedamanickam, the first Protestant Christian from Mylady, was baptized by Rev. Kohlhoff and he invited Ringeltaube. Once Ringeltaube reached Tharangam padi, Maharasan Vedamanickam took him to Travancore. His ministries are building schools, orphanages, job training and proclaiming the gospel. He opened many churches in Kanyakumari district. Mylady, Thamaraikulam, Puthalam, Koilvilai, Zionpuram, Perinbapuram and Ananthanadarkudy churches are the fruits of his ministry. One of these was Perinbapuram Church from Nagercoil on the way to Monday market. This church has a history of more than 200 years. Thamaraikulam church is 5 km from Kanyakumari. Ananthanadarkudy church is 7 km from Nagercoil. The first Protestant missionary to South Travancore was William Tobias Ringeltaube of the LMS in 1806. Ringeltaube, born in 1770, Pass on an invitation of Vedamanickam Maharasan of Mylaudy who had been converted in Tanjore by Rev. Kohlhoff, an SPCK (Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge) missionary. Ringeltaube was moved at the plight of the social out-castes of South Travancore. He worked among them and in May 1809 laid the foundation for a church in Mylaudy, the first Protestant Church of South Travancore. He visited ‚ÄòTrivandrum‚Äô in 1811. He left Travancore in 1816.

John Frederick mastered the French language. Between 1738 and 1742, John Frederick made a Grand Tour. He attended lectures on theology at the University of Strasbourg and lectures on mathematics and physics at the University of Utrecht. During his Grand Tour, he came into contact with the ideas of the Age of Enlightenment. He later tried to reconcile these ideas with his faith. In 1742, John Frederick represented his father at the coronation of Emperor Charles. The ceremony in Frankfurt Cathedral lasted several hours and John Frederick found it very impressive. In 1744, at the age of 23, he inherited the Principality of Schwarzburg-Rudolstadt. He continued the Heidecksburg construction project his father had begun. His father had built the exterior of the castle, John Frederick took up decorating the interior. He commissioned frescoed ceilings and overdoor ornaments.

The company has provided hallmarking services since The Goldsmiths Company was founded in the 14th century. The company received its royal charter in 1327 and ranks 5th in order of precedence of the 12 Great Livery Companies of the City of London. History Hallmarking dates back to the 14th century when Edward I of England passed a law requiring any item made of silver, which was offered for sale to be at least of equal quality as that of the coin of the realm (silver currency). The four wardens of The Goldsmiths‚Äô Company were tasked with visiting workshops in the City of London to assay (test) silver articles. If these articles were found to be below standard they were originally forfeit to the King, but if they passed, each article received the King's mark of authentication which was the mark of a leopard's head. By 1478, there were several hundred workshops and merchants manufacturing silver articles in the City of London. It was not possible for the wardens to visit them all so the merchants were ordered to bring their items to Goldsmiths‚Äô Hall for testing and marking and a permanent Assay Office was established in the building. This is the origin of the term hallmark ‚Äì struck with the King's mark at Goldsmiths‚Äô Hall. In 1544 the Goldsmith's Company adopted the King's mark as their town mark and the mark of the leopard's head is now internationally recognised as the mark of this assay office. The Leopard's head hallmark over time Precious metals are rarely used in their pure form, as they are too soft. Gold, silver, platinum and palladium are generally mixed (alloyed) with copper or other metals to create an alloy that is more suitable to the requirements of the jeweller or silversmith. The hallmark indicates the amount of precious metal in the alloy in parts per thousand (the millesimal fineness). In addition to indicating the town where the item was marked, a unique sponsor's or maker's mark identifies the item's origin and a date letter to represents the year of marking. Traditional hallmarks =Today= The Goldsmiths‚Äô Company Assay Office is still based at Goldsmiths‚Äô Hall and remains the oldest company in Britain to be continually trading from the same site. However, it also has two satellite offices; at Greville Street in Hatton Garden in the heart of the London jewellery quarter and within a high security complex at London's Heathrow airport, where it handles parcels imported from foreign manufacturers. In addition to hallmarking, the office has now expanded its range of services to support the jewellery trade and enforcement authorities. It offers a variety of specialist analytical services including nickel testing, antique silver dating, non-destructive compositional analysis, plating thickness measurement and a melt and assay service for scrap precious metal carried out in their fully independent on-site laboratory. Other services offered are a jewellery valuation service, laser marking, trading standards assistance, high quality photography and the provision of a comprehensive range of training and educational seminars, lectures and specialist events.

In 1686, ownership of the palace passed shortly to the Portuguese Crown, being passed over again in 1693 to D. Manuel Coutinho. The 1755 Lisbon earthquake caused no damage to the building which allowed improvements and remodeling to occur in the eighteenth century.

In the 20th century, it was acquired by the Spanish government and became the Embassy of Spain in Portugal. History A view along the Avenida da Liberdade, with corner of the Palacette Mayer (second from the left) The principal facade of the Mayer Palace/Embassy of Spain The project by Nicola Bigaglia, approved in 1899 (after its presentation to the municipal council of Lisbon) for Adolfo de Lima Mayer, began construction partially from existing funds. Bigaglia, an Italian architect who worked in Portugal at the turn of the century, situated the project along the Avenida da Liberdade. In 1902 the building received the Valmor Prize (its inaugural recipient); the sum of 1.802$850 reis was divided between the property-owner and architect, who donated his part of the prize to the municipal council of Lisbon, for public works to benefit the construction. In 1923, the Avenida Palace Clube was installed within the building by its owners, the firm of J√∫lio de Resende Lda., who expanded the terrace. A couple of years earlier the palace was landscaped and a garden installed: the Parque Mayer, along with the altering of the walls. Seven years later, the administrative services of the Spanish Embassy began to function from the palacette, after the building was acquired by the Spanish State: in 1945, there were changes internally to the former-residence, by architect Ant√≥nio de Mesa Ruiz Mateos. Changes and repairs to the building were carried out in 1950, 1965, 1971 and 1988. On 22 December 1989, the Secretary of State for Culture, opened a process (DR293) to classify the building. Architecture Detail of the sculpted form of a head of a woman, with mask of a lion, over one of the windows in the northeast of the building The rectangular building plan, consists of three floors separated by friezes and decorated by differing stonework. The main elevation in the east, consists of six bodies, separated by pilasters, characterized by the type of treatment: simulating a rustic ground floor and turning into double pilasters on the upper floor. With open spans and regular rhythm, the bodies are differentiated by different fenestration sculptures. The standard windows on the ground floor are framed by straight lintels, as are the bay windows on the 1st floor, with similar framing. The windows on the first floor are served by varandas, with balustrade, surmounted by triangular and rounded plinths. The two bodies to the northeast, include doorway with rounded arch, while some window plinths are decorated with a head of a woman, with the mask of a lion, while the royal arms of Spain appear on the extreme northeast body. These are surmounted, respectively, by windows decorated in founded frontispiece, supported by anthropomorphic ledges, and served by a varanda an balustrade with plinths. At the extreme body, the door is flanked by two narrow windows crowned and surmounted by two windows, with varanda and balustrade. The facade is surmounted by a cornice supported by corbels adorned with acanthus leaves, preceding a simple articulated parapet with balustrade. The internal spaces are partitioned and organized from two straight staircases (one main and one service), directly adjoining the rectangular compartments.

The adult beetle is black and around long. While they are usually harmless to humans, when squeezed or picked up, they produce a defensive phenolic secretion that causes skin burns. Luprops beetles have a notorious reputation since they can make life difficult when large populations invade farm houses, as reported in some parts of southern India, especially the state of Kerala, where they are called ‡¥Æ‡µÅ‡¥™‡µç‡¥≤‡¥ø ‡¥µ‡¥£‡µç‡¥ü‡µç or ‡¥ï‡µã‡¥ü‡µç‡¥ü‡µÜ‡¥∞‡µÅ‡¥Æ or ‡¥ï‡¥∞‡¥ø‡¥µ‡¥£‡µç‡¥ü‡µç in Malayalam. The name \\"Mupli beetle\\" comes from the region where the first major infestations of this beetle in Kerala were noted. A large group of Mupli beetles from Kalliad, Kannur, Kerala. Another large group of Mupli beetles from Kalliad, Kannur, Kerala. Description L. tristis goes through five larval instar stages and a pupal stage before the adult stage. The adult beetle is colored black. There is very little sexual dimorphism, and males and females overlap in size. After a month of active feeding in the adult form, they go into a lengthy dormant period in a suitable undisturbed dark location in response to the first summer rains before emerging again to feed and reproduce. Relationship to people In the rubber plantations of tropical southern India in Kerala, Mupli beetles are considered a major nuisance, to the point of infestations rendering some buildings uninhabitable. While these beetles do not deliberately attack people, they produce a defensive odoriferous phenolic secretion when provoked that causes skin blisters. This is most commonly triggered by accidentally squeezing a beetle. They invade homes and other buildings in very large numbers, estimates ranging up to 4.5 million individuals in a single building. They will then enter the dormant stage en masse, creating beehive-like masses under the roof. One effective and harmless way to kill these beetles is to spray kerosene in the infected areas. It will kill them instantly as long as the kerosene is physically there. Once vaporized it is of no use though. Nevertheless, spraying petrol is one of the best cost-effective ways for the instantaneous termination of beetles but the possibility for the fire must be preempted. A few Mupli beetles found hiding in a door hinge, having invaded a home, mid-April. References External links * Paper on the defensive glands of L. tristis. * On feeding habits.

His work explores the body in relation to sensuality, culture, and ideology, often creating cultural hybrids. Themes such as sexuality, HIV/AIDS, African culture, and the place of queerness within post-apartheid South Africa also permeate his work.  Early life and education  Athi-Patra Ruga was born on the 9th of March 1984 in Umtata in Eastern Cape, South Africa. He studied fashion history and design at the Gordon Flack Davison Design Academy in Johannesburg Ruga was recently included in the Phaidon book Younger Than Jesus, a directory of over 500 of the world‚Äôs best artists under the age of 33. In 2014 he presented in collaboration with Zanele Muholi and Nandipha Mntambo, facilitated by Hans Ulrich Obrist at Design Indaba Conference at Cape Town. Ruga has an exhibition done recently in London At 1‚Äì54 at London‚Äôs Somerset House, Of Gods, Rainbows and Omissions, also includes a collaboration of cohesive ideas for the exhibition with other South African Artists Emma Willemse, Faith47, and Thania Petersen. Ruga's work has been purchased by numerous public and private collections, including the Zeitz Museum of Contemporary Art Africa permanent collection, Iziko South African National Gallery, Museion ‚Äì Museum of Modern and Contemporary Art, in Bolzano Italy, and the CAAC ‚Äì Pigozzi Collection.  Style and philosophy  Ruga explores the notions of utopia and dystopia of a post apartheid South Africa. Working in printmaking, textiles, fashion, performance, and video, his work explores the body in relation to sensuality, culture, and ideology, often creating cultural hybrids. Themes such as sexuality, HIV/AIDS, African culture, and the place of queerness within post-apartheid South Africa also permeate his work. Ruga uses queerness to delineate appropriate symbols of apartheid‚Äôs power structure of strict binaries of gender and race and make them more ambiguous. To engage with his work the audiences need to be open, to experience and share. Ruga's performance pieces often raising questions about the public spaces being engaged with, exploring diverse levels of perceptions and reactions of the population encountered. Using fashion and body language in relation to the urban spaces provide a clash between legal and individual freedoms and social norms. Engaging in behaviors that lack a sense of ‚Äúnormalcy‚Äù or ‚Äúcommon sense‚Äù using parameters such as gender, ways of moving, dress and behavior, race and ethnicity in a hetero normative society.  Notable works  = Future White Women of Azania (FWWoA, 2010‚Äì2016) = FWWoA consists of several works, including performance, tapestry, sculpture, video, and photography creating a saga. FWWoA is an allegory of post apartheid nationalism, where Ruga then becomes the ‚Äúelder‚Äù or historian. Creating this constellationary history, drawing references from pre Xhosa history and post apartheid South Africa, tells the history of the non-dynastic line of queens who rule the lands of Azania. Ruga‚Äôs works are attentive to the demands for justice for his ancestors and the need for radical transformation in the future, to shatter the ideologies of ‚Äúrainbowism‚Äù. By using Azania as the framework for a critical history of South Africa, FWWoA reveals the silencing of black voices that extends back to the first moments of colonial contact, while also addressing the impossible and unrealized ideologies of forgiveness, reconciliation and redemption practiced in a post apartheid South African. Azania‚Äôs allegorical capacity derives from its status as a symbol of a liberated South Africa during the anti-apartheid struggle. However, the term has a specific history that complicates such dreams. The place name ‚ÄòAzania‚Äô first appears in The Periplus of the Erythraean Sea (40 AD) to refer to the lands of southern and eastern Africa. By designating the lands of Africa as ‚ÄòAzania,‚Äô Ruga understands the label as one example in a long history of constructing Africa as uninhabited until European colonial contact. Ruga‚Äôs tapestries in the FWWoA saga chronicles allegorical depictions of queens, maps, and other iconography of Azania. The struggles of the non-dynastic line of queens depicting signifiers of an Azanian national identity: national seal, crest, flower, maps, while also including Ruga‚Äôs long standing interest in popular culture. Taking inspirations from Gustave Eiffel‚Äôs ‚ÄòStatue of Liberty‚Äô or Eugene Delacroix‚Äôs ‚ÄòLiberty Leading the People', Ruga brings about the idea of objectifying the woman's body as the conflict, but in his own work creates them as powerful but passive. In his work ‚ÄòThe Lands of Azania‚Äô, Ruga reworks the map of Eastern Africa. Insetting a national animal, the saber-tooth zebra, the Azanian flag, and giving several countries new names. Throughout the geography of Azania he further explores the overlaps of exile and diaspora in the African and Jewish communities. A narrative with five characters, a national flower, crest and animal including the rainbow coloured balloon characters. One of Ahti-Patra's goals was to make a myth accessible even for children. A cute figure that has the capacity to be festive, create fanfare yet become disquieting when it violently pops and bleeds. = Performance Obscura = Performance Obscura, is a performance piece apart of the saga ‚Äò The Future White Women of Azania‚Äô (FWWoA, 2010‚Äì2016) in which an obscured figure in bright pink tights and red stiletto heels covered from the waist up in brightly colored balloons confronts everyday life. Ruga is confronting public memory, national identity, and history in post aparthied South Africa, while combining traditions like a funeral march and hybrid and festive Kaapse Klopse minstrel parade in Cape Town. The balloons representing lightness, flotation and childhood joy, while also referencing Desmond Tutu‚Äôs metaphor of rainbow nation. The performers actions of bursting the balloons and leaving dye on it undermines the authoritative powers of the statues there by disestablishing the authority of stone. Ruga terms these characters as ‚Äúavatars‚Äù and serves an apotropaic function by shielding the performer from trauma and empowering them. = The Naivete of Beiruth (2007) = This series of photographs are centered around Johannesburg Central Police Station, called John Vorster Square during apartheid, associated with interrogations, torture, and killing of political prisoners before 1994. Ruga dressed his subject in women's clothing along with a black helmet and long-haired wig. The extravagant garments and dramatic and glamorous poses evoke traditional fashion photography, contrasting with the racist crimes once committed in the building. Among other motivations to produce this work, the artist mentioned the xenophobic attacks that took place in May 2008 (called 5/11 in the vernacular) in townships all over South Africa as well as in the inner city of Johannesburg. =Ilulwane= Ilulwane was a synchronized-swimming performance inspired by Alvin Baltrop‚Äôs 1970s and 80s photographs, reflecting on the passage of time in both New York and in the artist‚Äôs own Xhosa culture. Ilulwane was performed in Cape Town at the Long Street Baths during the Infecting the City Public Arts Festival in 2012 { Infecting The City 2012, Ilulwane Infecting The City 2012, Ilulwane } =...elipsis in three parts= ‚Ä¶ellipsis in three parts is a performance that took place in the Michaelis Galleries at the University of Cape Town with three female performers on three separate days. The artist and performers were covered in body paint and as they wrestled across the gallery walls, they created the print as a record of the live performance.

Donna arrived in 1997 as a potential love interest for established character Rangi Heremaia (Blair Strang). What followed, became one of Shortland Street's most iconic storylines, with the happy couple discovering they were, in fact, related. The story arc carried on for 2 years when the two realised they were not related and married on the show's 2000th episode. Despite Rangi being killed off, Donna continued on the show and soon became one of the show's longest running characters. Storylines for Donna included being framed for murder, suffering a mental breakdown and kidnapping a baby, helping clear Victor (Calvin Tuteao) of murder and becoming Chris Warner's (Michael Galvin) mistress. The character departed in mid-2004 before returning in a two episode stint on Christmas the same year. The character's romance with Rangi is remembered as hugely iconic as well as the characters long duration. Creation and casting The character of Donna was created as a love interest for established character Rangi Heremaia. Stephanie Tauevihi was cast in the role after at first worrying the producers with the lack of chemistry towards Rangi's actor, Blair Strang. Despite the fast turnaround of the show, Tauevihi enjoyed the experience of working in the soap. After 7 years Tauevihi started to feel she had lost herself in the role and decided to leave. The character was written off as departing to Australia, something which disappointed Tauevihi, who had wished Donna was going to be killed off. In 2010 Angela Bloomfield jokingly suggested that she would bring Tauevihi back if the producers could afford it. Storylines Donna arrived to the clinic and soon started an affair with her paramedic partner Rangi Heremaia (Blair Strang). However, when Donna's family visited, the couple were shocked to learn Donna's father Joe (Tony Burton), was also Rangi's father, making the couple siblings. The two broke up and Donna fled Ferndale. She returned and became a medical assistant. After a failed attempt at a relationship with Frank Malone (Christopher Hobbs), Donna helped prove Rangi was innocent when he was accused of abusing elderly women and the two started another short lived controversial relationship. Donna briefly dated John Harlen (Matthew Chamberlain) and won a recording contract with her ex-husband Eddie Heka (Hori Ahipene). The two started an affair and Donna met Willy Whaia who she eventually suspected may be her true father. Donna had a DNA test done and was shocked to learn he was indeed her father and she was a result of an affair. However, when Willy died, his brother Te Wero confessed he was Donna's true father. Having broken up with Eddie, Donna looked forward to a future with Rangi but he had moved on and Donna rebounded with Paul Exley (Rory Williamson). Donna was framed by her neighbour for murder and Rangi helped clear her. The two finally reconciled and got married. Donna had a pregnancy scare and decided to have a family with Rangi but her low fertility forced to two to start IVF treatment. Rangi mysteriously went missing and weeks later his body was found. A devastated Donna refused to believe he had killed himself and eventually discovered he was having an affair and his mistress' husband Kim Tairoa (Patrick Kake) had drowned him when he had announced his devotion to Donna. An emotional Donna had a one- night stand with Victor Kahu (Calvin Tuteao) and suffered a mental breakdown leading her to kidnap Harry Warner (Joshua Thompson). Following her recovery, she got together with Harry's father Chris (Michael Galvin). Donna took in Rangi's daughter Tash (Michelle Stewart) and broke up with Chris when Dom (Shane Cortese) manipulated Tash into claiming Chris had molested her and revealed that Chris had cheated on her. Donna turned to Victor for support and the two started a relationship. Whilst Victor was in remand for murder, Donna bid her farewells to Ferndale and moved to Australia with Tash. She returned to attend Tama's (David Wikaira-Paul) wedding before she returned to Australia with a newly released Victor. Toni (Laura Hill) announced Donna was going to return to be her bridesmaid but she bailed several days before the ceremony. Donna and Victor sent Chris a card to express their sadness that they could not attend Toni's funeral. Character development =Relationship with Rangi= Donna was created as a love interest for the character of Rangi Initially the romance was meant to be straight forward but when an incestuous storyline was suggested, producers realized the large amount of content they could produce and a storyline where the happy couple would realize they are half siblings was conducted. The revelation caused Rangi to begin drinking and Donna to flee town. However the audience related well to the couple and when producers decided to make the two sleep again, there were no complaints from fans as were expected. Due to such high audience reaction, the paternity was unraveled in 1999, setting off a cliffhanger that saw the two possibly reconcile in the new millennium. When Donna was accused of murder, Rangi helped her through it and the two reconciled and married on the show's 2000th episode. Tauevihi enjoyed the couples marital bliss stating; \\"I had a huge storyline ... so it's nice to give that a bit of a flick, sit back and settle into post-marital domestic bliss. There are lots of soft, gentle moments between [Donna and Rangi] which is really nice to play out when you've been doing the angst-ridden, angry, pent-up, can't talk about it stuff.\\" The two decided to become parents but Donna was shocked to discover she was infertile, Tauevihi commented, \\"It's her natural desire as a woman to want to be a mother and to nurture and to reproduce, so when that's taken away from her she's totally devastated ... She feels as though she's failed Rangi. Even though he's doing his best to smooth it over and to reassure her, it's just not enough.\\"It's a very personal issue and Donna feels totally responsible.\\" The happiness didn't last for the couple, and Rangi went missing only to be discovered dead. Tauevihi enjoyed the storyline, stating, \\"It's a great storyline! It will knock everyones socks off and it's been a great challenge for me to play.\\" Donna discovered Rangi was cheating on her but had decided to stay with her only to be murdered by his mistress and her husband. Reception Tauevihi won the award for \\"Best Supporting Actress\\" in the 2000 TV Guide Television Awards. Her run of storylines have been described as \\"spectacular\\" and the character herself has been labelled, \\"iconic\\". The incestuous relationship between Rangi and Donna proved to be one of the soap's most iconic storylines, with the wedding episode being singled out as one of Shortland Street's best bits. In 2012, the character was named as one of the standout characters of the show's first 20 years.

The house, designed by Robin Boyd, was built between 1964 and 1966. Originally built as a family home for Dr. Michael Baker, the property is now used for private functions. The house, along with two other buildings on the site, was added to the Victorian Heritage Register in 2007, having remained relatively untouched since its construction. Description Floor plan of Baker House The house is square in plan, surrounded by twelve stone cylinders topped by a shallow pyramid roof, while at the centre lies a large courtyard beneath a flywire roof. Due to its remote location, the site was not originally connected to water or electricity. Because of this the house had to collect and store rainwater, so several of the stone cylinders house water tanks. The house also features a large schoolroom for the owner's homeschooled children. Internally, the private functions and services of the house line the walls of the courtyard with small windows onto the courtyard, leaving large open plan spaces along the perimeter of the building. The perimeter walls are fully glazed, opening onto deep verandas which allow for circulation inside the house. The main living space was originally heated by a large fireplace, however this proved to be ineffective, and the owners subsequently provided several extra wood burning heaters throughout the house. Key influences and design approach Boyd put much effort into considering the unique conditions of Australia and subsequently developed a style \\"related to Australian materials and conditions, to [the] light and its connection to Australian landscape\\". References to the work of Walter Burley Griffin are evident with large living spaces or courtyards becoming the centre of the house. The influence of Louis Kahn is also evident in the floor plan, where Boyd creates a sense of formality in the layout through the use of a perfect square. The use of such geometry also reflects the client‚Äôs profession as a mathematician and was described as \\"a plan of noughts and crosses\\". Originally planned to be constructed from concrete, the house instead utilised locally quarried stone, adding to the rustic qualities of the house, drawing on colonial influences in the design. Boyd described the process as \\"like designing a house for Robinson Crusoe.\\" At the time of construction there was a large emphasis on the texture, warmth and weathering of materials, influencing the use of stone both externally and internally, the straw ceilings and the bare concrete floors. These tough and low maintenance materials reflect the conditions of the surrounding Australian bushland. Dower House and Library After its completion in 1966, another house was commissioned for the owner‚Äôs mother-in- law, originally known as the Elizabeth Strickland house. Using the same local stone, Boyd designed a smaller house again with a square plan, although instead of the rigid geometry of the Baker House, the Dower House features a freeform stone wall running throughout. In 1979, the owners commissioned Roy Grounds, Boyd‚Äôs former partner, to design a small library on the site. His design complements those of Boyd through use of similar materials whilst contrasting with the formal style of the two houses.

It is now a popular tourist attraction with pedestrian shopping streets around the restored temple buildings.  History  In first year of Jianwu reign of Jin Dynasty (CE 317), Nanking Imperial University was founded, initially on northern bank of Qinhuai River, and in the 3rd year of Xiankang (CE 337) the campus extended to southern bank. Temple of Confucius was firstly constructed in the national school in the 9th year of Taiyuan (CE 384). The place was later destroyed. In the 1st year of Jingyou during Song Dynasty (CE 1034), Confucius Temple was newly constructed on former site of imperial university, and was called Fuzimiao area along with Nanking Fuxue.FuzimiaoNanjing Fuzimiao The place became Imperial University again in 1365 in the early year of Ming Dynasty, and sixteen years later recovered to be the campus of Fuxue. During Qing Dynasty, there were two Xianxue (county schools of Shangyuan and Jiangning) in Fuzimiao area. In the end of Qing a primary school jointly sponsored by counties of Nanjing (Jiangning Fu) was established there. The current buildings date from the 19th century, in Qing Dynasty, with additions made since then. The temple lost all financial support by the state as a result of the revolution of 1911. During the late 1920s to 1931 and again in 1932 it was used as army barracks for troops the KMT regime and left in a dilapidated state. Some halls were used as picture gallery.Krug, Hans Joachim (*1893); Wanderungen und Wandlungen in China; Berlin 1941 (Scherl), p. 44-5, 53 (based on a visits 1930-3) In 1985 Fuzimiao area was restored.

The primary function of these kings was as war leaders, but there were also ritual elements to kingship, evident in ceremonies of coronation. The Kingdom of Alba, which emerged from the unification of the Scots and Picts in the tenth century, retained some of these ritual aspects, most obviously in the coronation ceremony at Scone. While the Scottish monarchy remained a largely itinerant institution, Scone remained one of its most important locations, with royal castles at Stirling and Perth becoming significant in the later Middle Ages before Edinburgh developed as a capital in the second half of the fifteenth century. The Scottish crown grew in prestige throughout the era and adopted the conventional offices of western European courts and later elements of their ritual and grandeur. In the early period, the kings of the Scots depended on the great lords of the mormaers (later earls) and To√≠sechs (later thanes), but from the reign of David I, sheriffdoms were introduced, which allowed more direct control and gradually limited the power of the major lordships. While modern knowledge of early systems of law is limited, royal justice can be seen as developing from the twelfth century onwards with local sheriff, burgh, manorial and ecclesiastical courts and offices of the justicar to oversee administration. The Scots common law began to develop in this period, and there were attempts to systematise and codify the law and the beginnings of an educated professional body of lawyers. In the late Middle Ages, major institutions of government including the King's Council and Parliament developed. The Council emerged as a full-time body in the fifteenth century, increasingly dominated by laymen and critical to the administration of justice. Parliament also emerged as a major legal institution, gaining an oversight of taxation and policy. By the end of the era it was sitting almost every year, partly because of the frequent minorities and regencies of the period, which may have prevented it from being sidelined by the monarchy. Kingship Footprint used in king-making ceremonies at Dunadd In the early medieval period, with its many competing kingdoms within the modern boundaries of Scotland, kingship was not inherited in a direct line from the previous king. A candidate for kingship usually needed to be a member of a particular dynasty and to claim descent from a particular ancestor.A. Woolf, From Pictland to Alba: 789 ‚Äì 1070 (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2007), , p. 27. Kingship could be multi-layered and very fluid. The Pictish kings of Fortriu were probably acting as overlords of other Pictish kings for much of this period and occasionally were able to assert an overlordship over non- Pictish kings, but sometimes had to acknowledge the overlordship of external rulers, both Anglian and British. Such relationships may have included obligations to pay tribute or to supply armed forces. In victory subordinate rulers may have received rewards in return. Interaction and intermarriage into subject kingdoms may have opened the way to absorption of such sub-kingdoms and, although there might be later overturnings of such annexation, it is likely that kingship was being gradually monopolised by a handful of the most powerful dynasties.B. Yorke, \\"Kings and kingship\\", in P. Stafford, ed., A Companion to the Early Middle Ages: Britain and Ireland, c.500-c.1100 (Chichester: Wiley-Blackwell, 2009), , pp. 76‚Äì90. The primary role of a king was to act as a war leader, reflected in the very small number of minorities or female reigning monarchs in the period. Kings organised the defence of their people's lands, property and persons and negotiated with other kings to secure these things. If they failed to do so, the settlements might be raided, destroyed or annexed and the populations killed or taken into slavery. Kings also engaged in the low-level warfare of raiding and the more ambitious full- scale warfare that led to conflicts of large armies and alliances and which could be undertaken over relatively large distances, like the expedition to Orkney by D√°l Riata in 581 or the Northumbrian attack on Ireland in 684. Kingship had its ritual aspects. The Scottish kings of D√°l Riata were inaugurated by putting their foot in a footprint in stone, signifying that they would follow in the footsteps of their predecessors.J. Haywood, The Celts: Bronze Age to New Age (London: Pearson Education, 2004), , p. 125. The Kingdom of Alba, unified in the ninth century and which would develop into the kingdom of Scotland, had Scone and its sacred stone at the heart of its coronation ceremony, which historians presume was inherited from Pictish practice, but which was claimed to date back to the first arrival of the Scottish kings from Ireland. It was here that Scottish kings before the wars of independence were crowned, on the Stone of Scone, before its removal by Edward I in 1296. The first ceremony for which details survive is that for Alexander III in 1249. They describe a ceremony that combined elements of ancient heritage, the Church and secular lordship. He was consecrated by the Bishop of St Andrews and placed on the throne by the Mormaers of Strathearn and Fife and his genealogy recited in Gaelic back to his Dalriadric Scottish ancestors by a royal poet from the Highlands.J. Bannerman, \\"MacDuff of Fife,\\" in A. Grant & K. Stringer, eds., Medieval Scotland: Crown, Lordship and Community, Essays Presented to G. W. S. Barrow (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 1993), pp. 22‚Äì3. There was no anointment or crowning ceremony, as was common elsewhere in Europe. Later kings seem to have resented this omission and attempted to remedy it by appeals to the Pope. However, Scottish kings are usually depicted wearing crowns and carrying the normal regalia associated with kingship.B. Webster, Medieval Scotland: the Making of an Identity (St. Martin's Press, 1997), , pp. 45‚Äì7. Coronation of Alexander III on Moot Hill, Scone. Beside him are the Mormaers of Strathearn and Fife, while his genealogy is recited by a royal poet. For most of the medieval era, the king was itinerant and had no \\"capital\\" as such. David I (r. 1124‚Äì53) tried to build up Roxburgh as a royal centre, but in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, more charters were issued at Scone than any other location. Other popular locations in the early part of the era were nearby Perth, Stirling, Dunfermline and Edinburgh.P. G. B. McNeill and Hector L. MacQueen, eds, Atlas of Scottish History to 1707 (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 1996), pp. 159‚Äì63. In the later Middle Ages the king moved between royal castles, particularly Perth and Stirling, but also holding judicial sessions throughout the kingdom, with Edinburgh only beginning to emerge as the capital in the reign of James III at the cost of considerable unpopularity.J. Wormald, Court, Kirk, and Community: Scotland, 1470‚Äì1625 (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 1991), , pp. 14‚Äì15. The unification of the kingdom, the spread of Anglo-Norman custom, the development of a European trading economy and Robert I's success in achieving independence from England did much to build up the prestige of the institution.N. H. Reid, \\"Crown and Community under Robert I\\", in G. W. S. Barrow, A. Grant and K. J. Stringer, eds, Medieval Scotland: Crown, Lordship and Community (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 1998), , p. 221. Like most western European monarchies, the Scottish crown in the fifteenth century adopted the example of the Burgundian court, through formality and elegance putting itself at the centre of culture and political life, defined with display, ritual and pageantry, reflected in elaborate new palaces and patronage of the arts.Wormald (1991), p. 18. Renaissance ideas began to influence views on government, described as New or Renaissance monarchy, which emphasised the status and significance of the monarch. The Roman Law principle that \\"a king is emperor in his own kingdom\\" can be seen in Scotland from the mid-fifteenth century. In 1469 Parliament passed an act that declared that James III possessed \\"full jurisdiction and empire within his realm\\". From the 1480s the king's image on his silver groats showed him wearing a closed, arched, imperial crown, in place of the open circlet of medieval kings, probably the first coin image of its kind outside of Italy. It soon began to appear in heraldry, on royal seals, manuscripts, sculptures and the steeples of churches with royal connections, as at St. Giles Cathedral, Edinburgh. The first Scottish monarch to actually wear such a crown was James V, whose diadem was reworked to include arches in 1532. They were re-added when it was reconstructed in 1540 and this remains the Crown of Scotland. The idea of imperial monarchy emphasised the dignity of the crown and included its role as a unifying national force, defending national borders and interest, royal supremacy over the law and a distinctive national church within the Catholic communion.A. Thomas, The Renaissance, in T. M. Devine and J. Wormald, The Oxford Handbook of Modern Scottish History (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2012), , p. 188. New Monarchy can also be seen in the reliance of the crown on \\"new men\\" rather than the great magnates, the use of the clergy as a form of civil service, and the development of standing armed forces and a navy.J. D. Mackie, B. Lenman and G. Parker, A History of Scotland (London: Penguin, 1991), . Court The seal of Walter Fitzalan (1106‚Äì77), the first hereditary royal stewart Little is known about the structure of the Scottish royal court in the period before the reign of David I, but by the late thirteenth century, it had taken on a distinctly feudal character. The major offices were the steward or stewart, chamberlain, constable, marischal and chancellor. The office of stewart, responsible for management of the king's household, was created by David I and given as an hereditary office to Walter Fitzalan, whose descendants became the House of Stewart. The office was merged with the crown when Robert II inherited the throne. The other major secular posts also had a tendency to become hereditary, with the chamberlain responsible for royal finances and the constable for organising the crown's military forces, while the marishchal had a leadership role in battle. The chancellor, who was usually a clergyman, had charge of the king's chapel, which was also the major administrative centre of the crown, and had control of the letters, legal writs and seals. Under him were various posts, usually filled by clerics, including the custodian of the great seal. There were also lesser posts, some of which were Gaelic in origin, including senior clerks of the Provend and the Liverence, in charge of the distribution of food, and the Hostarius (later Usher or \\"Doorward\\"), who was in charge of the royal bodyguard.G. W. S. Barrow, Robert Bruce (Berkeley CA.: University of California Press, 1965), pp. 11‚Äì12. King's council After the crown, the most important government institution in the late Middle Ages was the king's council, composed of the king's closest advisers. Unlike its counterpart in England, the king's council in Scotland retained legislative and judicial powers. It was relatively small, with normally less than 10 members in a meeting, some of whom were nominated by parliament, particularly during the many minorities of the era, as a means of limiting the power of a regent.J. Wormald, Court, Kirk, and Community: Scotland, 1470‚Äì1625 (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 1991), , pp. 22‚Äì3. The council was a virtually full-time institution by the late fifteenth century, and surviving records from the period indicate it was critical in the working of royal justice. Nominally members of the council were some of the great magnates of the realm, but they rarely attended meetings. Most of the active members of the council for most of the late Medieval Period were career administrators and lawyers, almost exclusively university-educated clergy. The most successful of these moved on to occupy the major ecclesiastical positions in the realm as bishops and, towards the end of the period, archbishops. By the end of the fifteenth century, this group was being joined by increasing numbers of literate laymen, often secular lawyers, of which the most successful gained preferment in the judicial system and grants of lands and lordships. From the reign of James III onwards, the clerically dominated post of Lord Chancellor was increasingly taken by leading laymen. Parliament The Old Tolbooth, Edinburgh, usual location of Scottish parliaments from 1438 to 1560 After the council, the next most important body in the process of government at the end of the era was parliament, which had evolved by the late thirteenth century from the King's Council of Bishops and Earls into a 'colloquium' with a political and judicial role.K. M. Brown and R. J. Tanner, The History of the Scottish Parliament Volume 1: Parliament and Politics, 1235‚Äì1560 (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2004), , pp. 1‚Äì28. By the early fourteenth century, the attendance of knights and freeholders had become important, and probably from 1326 burgh commissioners joined them to form the Three Estates, meeting in a variety of major towns throughout the kingdom.A. R. MacDonald, The Burghs and Parliament in Scotland, c. 1550‚Äì1651 (Aldershot: Ashgate, 2007), , p. 14.Brown and Tanner (2004), p. 50. It acquired significant powers over particular issues, including consent for taxation, but it also had a strong influence over justice, foreign policy, war, and other legislation, whether political, ecclesiastical, social or economic. Under Robert I, the importance of the parliament grew as he called them more frequently and its composition shifted to include more representation from the burghs and lesser landowners.K. Reid and R. Zimmerman, A History of Private Law in Scotland: I. Introduction and Property (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2000), , p. 38. In 1399, a General Council established that the King should hold a parliament at least once a year for the next three years, so \\"that his subjects are served by the law\\".Legislation ‚Äì Records of the Parliaments of Scotland, 1399/1/13. translation. From the early 1450s, a great deal of the legislative business of the Scottish parliament was usually carried out by a parliamentary committee known as the 'Lords of the Articles', chosen by the three estates to draft legislation that was then presented to the full assembly to be confirmed.R. J. Tanner, 'The Lords of the Articles before 1540', in Scottish Historical Review, 79, (2000), pp. 189‚Äì212. Before the sixteenth century, parliamentary business was also carried out by 'sister' institutions, including the General Council and the Convention of Estates. These bodies could deal with taxation, legislation and policy-making, but lacked the ultimate authority of a full parliament.R. J. Tanner, The Late Medieval Scottish Parliament: Politics and the Three Estates, 1424‚Äì1488 (Edinburgh: Tuckwell, 2001), . In the fifteenth century, parliament was being called on an almost annual basis, more often than its English counterpart, and was willing to offer occasional resistance or criticism to the policies of the crown, particular in the unpopular reign of James III. However, from about 1494, after his success against the Stewarts and Douglases and over rebels in 1482 and 1488, James IV managed largely to dispense with the institution, and it might have declined, like many other systems of Estates in continental Europe, had it not been for his death in 1513 and another long minority.J. Wormald, Court, Kirk, and Community: Scotland, 1470‚Äì1625 (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 1991), , p. 21. Law The Regiam Majestatem is the oldest surviving written digest of Scots law. Present-day knowledge of the nature of Scots law before the eleventh century is largely speculative, with no surviving law codes from Scotland in this period,D. E.

Stafford, ed., A Companion to the Early Middle Ages: Britain and Ireland, c.500-c.1100 (Chichester: Wiley-Blackwell, 2009), , pp. 98. but it was probably a mixture of different legal traditions representing the different cultures inhabiting the land at the time, including British, Irish and Anglo-Saxon customs.Scottish Legal History: A Research Guide, Georgetown Law Library, retrieved 22 October 2011. The legal tract known as Laws of the Brets and Scots, probably compiled in the reign of David I, set out a system of compensation for injury and death based on ranks and the solidarity of kin groups.A.

There were popular courts, the comhdhail, indicated by dozens of place names throughout eastern Scotland.McNeill and MacQueen (1996), pp. 191‚Äì4. In Scandinavian-held areas Udal law formed the basis of the legal system and it is known that the Hebrides were taxed using the Ounceland measure.N. Sharples and R.

Althings were open-air governmental assemblies that met in the presence of the jarl, and the meetings were open to virtually all free men.

The introduction of feudalism in the reign of David I had a profound impact on the development of Scots law, establishing feudal land tenure over many parts of the south and east, which eventually spread northward.Reid and Zimmerman (2000), p. 20. Sheriffs‚Äîoriginally appointed by the King as royal administrators and tax collectors‚Äîdeveloped legal functions, and as early as 1214, they were holding court to hear a variety of cases.Reid and Zimmerman (2000), p. 23. Feudal lords were also normally permitted to hold court where disputes between their tenants, including criminal matters, were adjudicated. By the fourteenth century, some of these feudal courts had developed into \\"petty kingdoms\\" where the King's courts did not have authority, except for cases of treason.Stair, vol. 22, para. 509 (Online), Retrieved 26 October 2011. Burghs, towns which had been given this special status usually by the King, also had their own set of local laws dealing mostly with commercial and trade matters and may have become similar in function to sheriff's courts.Reid and Zimmerman (2000), p. 24. Ecclesiastical courts also played an important role in Scotland as they had exclusive jurisdiction over matters such as marriage, contracts made on oath, inheritance and legitimacy.Reid and Zimmerman (2000), p. 30. These courts, unlike their lay counterparts, were generally staffed by educated men who were trained in both Roman and Canon law and offered a more sophisticated form of justice. Judices were often royal officials who supervised baronial, abbatial and other lower-ranking \\"courts\\".G. W. S. Barrow, The Kingdom of the Scots (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2003). pp. 69‚Äì82. However, the main official of law in the post-Davidian Kingdom of the Scots was the Justiciar who held courts and reported to the king personally. Normally, there were two Justiciarships, organised by linguistic boundaries: the Justiciar of Scotia and the Justiciar of Lothian, but sometimes Galloway also had its own Justiciar. Scottish common law, the ius commune, began to take shape at the end of the period, assimilating Gaelic and Celtic law with practices from Anglo-Norman England and the Continent.D. H. S. Sellar, \\"Gaelic Laws and Institutions\\", in M. Lynch, ed., The Oxford Companion to Scottish History (Oxford, Oxford University Press, 2004), , pp. 381‚Äì82. During the period of English control over Scotland, there is some evidence to suggest that King Edward I attempted to abolish Scottish laws that were contrary to English law, as he had done in Wales.Reid and Zimmerman (2000), p. 36. Under Robert I in 1318, a parliament at Scone enacted a code of law that drew upon older practices, but it was also dominated by current events and focused on military matters and the conduct of the war.Reid and Zimmerman (2000), p. 40. Nevertheless, the Act also codified procedures for criminal trials and protections for vassals from ejection from the land.Reid and Zimmerman (2000), p. 41. From the fourteenth century, there are surviving examples of early Scottish legal literature, such as the Regiam Majestatem (on procedure at the royal courts) and the Quoniam Attachiamenta (on procedure at the baron courts), which drew on both common and Roman law.Reid and Zimmerman (2000), pp. 42 and 46. Robert II depicted enthroned as a lawgiver on his great seal The Stewart dynasty, founded by King Robert II in 1371, was defined by the growing authority and power of the Scottish Kings in matters of law and the development of existing legal institutions. In 1469, the parliament of Scotland affirmed the ultimate authority of James III and rejected the authority of imperial notaries in Scottish civil matters.Reid and Zimmerman (2000), p. 50. The recognition of the sovereign authority of the Scottish Kings was connected to the influence of the common law in Scots law. Customary laws, such as the Law of Clan MacDuff, came under attack from the Stewart Dynasty, which consequently extended the reach of Scots common law.Reid and Zimmerman (2000), p. 56. From the reign of King James I, the beginnings of a legal profession began to develop and the administration of criminal and civil justice was centralised.Reid and Zimmerman (2000), p. 52. The growing activity of the parliament and the centralisation of administration in Scotland called for the better dissemination of Acts of the parliament to the courts and other enforcers of the law.Reid and Zimmerman (2000), p. 65. Throughout the late fifteenth century, unsuccessful attempts were made to form commissions of experts to codify, update or define Scots law.Reid and Zimmerman (2000), p. 66. The legal uncertainty that this situation created prompted increased reliance on the common law found in Canon law, and there are a number of examples of statutes from this period that clearly drew from Roman law.Reid and Zimmerman (2000), p. 67. The general practice during this period, as evidenced from records of cases, seems to have been to defer to specific Scottish laws on a matter when available and to fill in any gaps with provisions from the common law embodied in Civil and Canon law, which had the advantage of being written.Reid and Zimmerman (2000), p. 73. The study of law was popular in Scotland, and many students travelled to Continental Europe to study canon law and civil law.Reid and Zimmerman (2000), p. 68. Scotland advanced markedly in educational terms during the fifteenth century with the founding of the University of St Andrews in 1413, the University of Glasgow in 1450 and the University of Aberdeen in 1495, and with the passing of the Education Act 1496, which required those who administered justice in Scotland to learn Latin and study law for at least three years at school.P. J. Bawcutt and J. H. Williams, A Companion to Medieval Scottish Poetry (DS Brewer, 2006), , pp. 29‚Äì30. Local government Map of mormaer and other lordships in Medieval Scotland, c. 1230 The relative poverty of the kingdom, difficult terrain and the lack of a system of regular taxation, helped to limit the scale of central administration and government by the Scottish crown. Before the twelfth century, the king \\"delegated\\" power to hereditary native \\"officers\\" such as the Mormaers/Earls and To√≠sechs/Thanes. In the Norman period, sheriffs and, to a lesser extent, bishops, became increasingly important. The former enabled the King to effectively administer royal demesne land. During David I's reign, royal sheriffs had been established in the king's core personal territories; at Roxburgh, Scone, Berwick-upon-Tweed, Stirling and Perth. By the reign of William I, there may have been about 30 royal sheriffdoms, including ones at Ayr and Dumfries, key locations on the borders of Galloway-Carrick. By the end of the thirteenth century, sheriffdoms had been established in westerly locations as far-flung as Wigtown, Kintyre, Skye and Lorne. This meant that, particularly in the lowlands, the crown was now able to administer government through the system of sheriffdoms and other appointed officers, rather than semi-independent lordships. Until the fifteenth century, the ancient pattern of major lordships survived largely intact, with the addition of two new \\"scattered earldoms\\" of Douglas and Crawford, thanks to royal patronage after the wars of independence, mainly in the borders and south-west. The Stewarts emerged as the dominant kindred and came to control many of the earldoms. Their acquisition of the crown, and a series of internal conflicts and confiscations, meant that by around the 1460s, the monarchy had transformed its position within the realm, gaining control of most of the \\"provincial\\" earldoms and lordships. Rather than running semi-independent lordships, the major magnates now had scattered estates and occasional regions of major influence. In the Highlands, James II created two new provincial earldoms for his favourites: Argyll for the Campbells and Huntly for the Gordons, which acted as a bulwark against the vast Lordship of the Isles built up by the Macdonalds. James IV largely resolved the Macdonald problem by annexing the estates and titles of John Macdonald II to the crown in 1493 after discovering his plans for an alliance with the English.McNeill and MacQueen (1996), p. 179.

On 20 April 2012, Evans was convicted and sentenced to five years imprisonment. McDonald was acquitted. Several people were later fined after naming the woman on Twitter and other social media websites. Evans served years in prison, being paroled on the Early Release Scheme. After this, his conviction was overturned on appeal in favour of a retrial. The appeal became a reported case by at least three sets of Law Reports as it confirmed only similar non-hearsay testimony of historic sexual encounters by a third party with a complainant, which is so similar that similarity cannot be reasonably explained by coincidence, can be admitted by the presiding judge, heard or written (adduced) in evidence and then considered by a jury. Such witnesses came forward who testified, with supporting evidence, to that effect. At retrial the jury found Evans not guilty, as McDonald had been found at the original trial. Background On 30 May 2011, Wales international and Sheffield United player Ched Evans and McDonald were arrested on suspicion of the sexual assault of a woman in Rhyl, Denbighshire in connection with what was later proven and admitted to have been sexual intercourse at a Premier Inn in Rhuddlan on the same day. On 26 July, the two were charged with rape, which they both denied. Criminal proceedings =Preliminary hearings= On 8 August 2011, McDonald and Evans appeared before Prestatyn Magistrates' Court charged with rape. The defendants were released on bail and did not comment on the matter, but McDonald told Port Vale's website that he \\"strongly refute[d]\\" the allegation. Evans also issued a statement on Sheffield United's website stating that he \\"strenuously denie[d] the charge\\". McDonald and Evans entered pleas of not guilty at the Crown Court at Caernarfon on 14 October, and were remanded on bail. =Trial= The trial took place at that court in April 2012. The woman, a 19-year-old waitress, said she had drunk two glasses of wine, four double vodkas with lemonade, and a shot of sambuca. As a result, she told police she \\"felt tipsy but not out of control\\". However, she woke up naked and confused in a hotel bed with no memory of anything since leaving a dancing session with friends the previous night. She suspected that her memory loss was due to a spiked drink. Samples taken the next day showed no alcohol, although the prosecution argued this was due to normal elimination over time. The samples did show traces of cocaine and cannabis, which she denied taking on the night of the incident. The prosecution argument was that the woman was too intoxicated to have consented. The defence agreed that McDonald met the woman on the street and took her back to the hotel, where they were later joined by Evans. However, they claimed that both men had sex with the woman separately and with her consent. They argued she was not too drunk to consent, and suggested that her claim of memory loss may be a lie. On 20 April 2012, the jury returned its verdicts. McDonald was acquitted. Evans was convicted of rape and sentenced to five years imprisonment. Judge Merfyn Hughes QC stated in his sentencing remarks that: \\"The complainant was 19 years of age and was extremely intoxicated. CCTV footage shows, in my view, the extent of her intoxication when she stumbled into your friend. As the jury have found, she was in no condition to have sexual intercourse. When you arrived at the hotel, you must have realised that.\\" =Appeals= On 24 April 2012, it was announced that Evans was seeking the leave of the Court of Appeal to appeal against his conviction. On 20 August 2012, leave to appeal was refused by a single judge of the Court of Appeal, and on 6 November 2012, a three-judge panel agreed with the refusal. By November 2013, Evans had recruited a new legal team headed by an ex-senior detective, Russ Whitfield, and higher courts specialist Criminal lawyer David Emanuel. In July 2014, he launched another appeal attempt via the Criminal Cases Review Commission. Evans was released from prison, reaching the date for release on the early release scheme, without misbehaviour nor an adverse Probation Service report, on 17 October 2014. Shortly afterwards, the Criminal Cases Review Commission announced that they were prioritising their review of his conviction. In October 2015, the CCRC, based on new material which was not considered by the jury at trial, decided to refer the case to the Court of Appeal. This obliged the court to reconsider the trial process and evidence admitted and excluded leading to the conviction. The appeal evidence was heard by Lord Justice Hallett, Mr Justice Flaux, and Sir David Maddison on 22 and 23 March 2016,Preview of Weekly Law Reports case [2016] 4 WLR 169; The Incorporated Council of Law Reporting and the decision pronounced on 21 April. Evans's conviction was quashed, and the court ordered a retrial. To avoid prejudicing the retrial, it prohibited the publication of details of the appeal until the retrial was complete. According to The Guardian, =Retrial= Evans' retrial began on 4 October 2016 at Cardiff Crown Court. The main new evidence included was from other men who had had consensual sex with the woman, who testified that her sexual behaviour was similar to that which Evans described. Details of a complainant's sexual history are not usually admissible, but there is an exception, reiterated (upheld) on appeal in the Law Reports, for evidence which is \\"so similar [to the defence's account] that the similarity cannot reasonably be explained as a coincidence\\". The prosecution's allegations of the witnesses of perhaps receiving this account from Evans' defence campaign, and being motivated by the ¬£50,000 reward offered for information were rejected by the jury. On 14 October, following two hours of deliberation, the jury of seven women and five men returned a verdict of not guilty. Naming of complainant on the internet North Wales Police investigated claims that the woman had been named and subjected to abuse on Twitter after the trial. Former Lord Chancellor, Lord Falconer of Thoroton, Holly Dustin, the director of End Violence Against Women, and Secretary of State for the Home Department Theresa May warned of the risks posed by discussing court cases on social media websites, and reiterated the need to protect the anonymity of complainants in cases concerning sexual offences. As of 6 October 2012, North Wales Police had arrested 23 people on suspicion of offences relating to the naming of the complainant. Police also investigated a mistake by Sky News which showed the name of the complainant on television. Sheffield United academy and reserve team player Connor Brown was suspended by his club after allegedly making offensive comments about the woman on Twitter, although he did not give her name. On 5 November 2012, nine people who had named the complainant on Twitter and Facebook, including a cousin of Evans, were each told to pay her ¬£624 after admitting the offence at Prestatyn magistrates' court. A tenth person pleaded not guilty, but later changed her plea to guilty on 21 January 2013.Ched Evans rape case: Tenth person fined for naming victim BBC News, 21 January 2013. Retrieved 8 March 2013. The complainant changed her identity as a result of having been named on social media; in October 2014, after Evans' release from prison, it was reported that her new identity had been illegally revealed on Twitter and blogs. The complainant continued to be identified online during Evans' retrial in 2016.

Jewel Flowers was born in 1923, in East Lumberton, North Carolina, in the part of the town known as a cotton mill village, to Calton and Leah Flowers. She was the youngest of three children. She had a sister, Evelyn Flowers, and a brother, C.F. Flowers. As a teenager, she was crowned \\"Miss Lumberton, North Carolina\\". She moved to New York City at 17 after graduating from high school, having been both invited there by a friend from Lumberton and sent by her parents to enroll in a business college in Manhattan. In March 1940, Flowers sent a picture of herself to pin-up artist Rolf Armstrong in response to an advert he had placed in the New York Times. Armstrong, 50 at the time, had been based at the Hotel des Artistes on West 67th Street in Manhattan since 1939, and was looking for new models. He invited Flowers for an interview. On March 25, 1940, Flowers started modeling for Armstrong. Their professional collaboration and friendship lasted for two decades. The first painting, titled \\"How am I doing?\\", reportedly because Flowers, unused to modeling, repeatedly asked Armstrong \\"How am I doing?\\" during the modeling session, was first published after World War II had started. It was Brown & Bigelow's best selling calendar for 1942 at a time when the company sold millions of calendars in America, and it became one of Armstrong's most reproduced pictures. Flowers was popular with American servicemen during World War II, some of whom sent her letters proposing marriage. Armstrong's calendars and silhouettes of Flowers were copied onto bombers and other planes as nose art and painted on tank turrets. She became so well known during the war, although more as a famous face than by name, that a serviceman's letter addressed simply as \\"Jewel Flowers, New York City\\" was delivered correctly. For many American servicemen abroad, she represented the \\"Why We Fight\\" spirit. U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt's government enlisted her to help promote war bonds. The January 1, 1945 edition of TIME magazine included Armstrong's \\"Toast of the Town\\" painting of Flowers in an article about Calendar Art. The article noted that calendars with \\"girl paintings\\" were \\"bought heavily by foundries, machine shops, auto-supply dealers.\\" Flowers married Frank Welch in California in 1946. They lived in several places while her husband tried a number of business ventures, including Laguna Beach, California, Greenville, South Carolina, Reno, Nevada, where she reportedly worked in as a card dealer for a time, and New York City. They had a son together, Woody Welch. According to Michael Wooldridge, coauthor of Pinup Dreams: The Glamour Art of Rolf Armstrong, Armstrong called her a number of times during the period she was following her husband from place to place, to try to persuade her to return to New York and modeling for him. Her modeling career ended with Armstrong's death in 1960. He left a large proportion of his personal wealth to Flowers. In total, Armstrong created around fifty to sixty works using Flowers as the model. She returned to Lumberton as a wealthy woman. Her marriage to Frank Welch ended in divorce and in 1961 she moved to Myrtle Beach, South Carolina. She married Jon Wesley Evans there in 1965, they worked together at his Certified Public Accounting firm, and were successful in real estate investment. Jon Evans died in 1995. Flowers died in 2006 of complications following surgery. Louis K. Meisel, coauthor of The Great American Pin-Up, said she was \\"the last of the great models\\" drawn by illustrators. South Carolina's The State newspaper described her as \\"probably the number one pin-up girl of all time\\".

Martand is another Sanskrit synonym for Surya. Now in ruins, the temple is located five miles from Anantnag in the Indian union territory of Jammu and Kashmir. The temple was destroyed on the orders of Sultan Sikandar Butshikan, as part of his efforts to forcibly convert Kashmiri people to Islam. History Ruins of the Surya Temple at Martand, photo taken by John Burke in 1868 The Martand Sun Temple was built by the third ruler of the Karkota Dynasty, Lalitaditya Muktapida, in the 8th century CE. It is said to have been built during 725-756 CE. The foundation of the temple is said to have been around since 370-500 CE, with some attributing the construction of the temple to have begun with Ranaditya.  The temple  Restored impression of temple from Letters from India and Kashmir by J. Duguid, 1870-73 The Martand temple was built on top of a plateau from where one can view whole of the Kashmir Valley. From the ruins and related archaeological findings, it can be said it was an excellent specimen of Kashmiri architecture, which had blended the Gandharan, Gupta, Chinese, Roman, Syrian-Byzantine and Greek forms of architecture. The temple has a colonnaded courtyard, with its primary shrine in its center and surrounded by 84 smaller shrines, stretching to be 220 feet long and 142 feet broad total and incorporating a smaller temple that was previously built.Encyclop√¶dia Britannica: a new survey of universal knowledge: Volume 12, pp:965 The temple turns out to be the largest example of a peristyle in Kashmir, and is complex due to its various chambers that are proportional in size and aligned with the overall perimeter of the temple. In accordance with Hindu temple architecture, the primary entrance to the temple is situated in the western side of the quadrangle and is the same width as the temple itself, creating grandeur. The entrance is highly reflective of the temple as a whole due to its elaborate decoration and allusion to the deities worshiped inside. The primary shrine is located in a centralised structure (the temple proper) that is thought to have had a pyramidal top - a common feature of the temples in Kashmir. Various wall carvings in the antechamber of the temple proper depict other gods, such as Vishnu, and river goddesses, such as Ganga and Yamuna, in addition to the sun-god Surya.

They are the emergent peaks of submarine volcanoes and are Australian external territory. Prior to 1992, there had not been an eruption in the previous 75,000 years. Morphology The McDonald Islands comprise three islands: McDonald Island, Flat Island (which later merged with McDonald Island) and Meyer Rock. The islands are mostly composed of phonolitic low-silica pumice, dikes and lava domes, and sit atop a submarine plateau, the Kerguelen Plateau. They are located about 75 km from Heard Island. McDonald Island is the largest of the islands, at around in area. It has been the main focus of volcanic activity in recent times. Prior to 1996, McDonald Island had been a flat green island whose pumice beaches provided a great nesting area for penguin breeding. The island now has two main peaks, Maxwell Hill and Samarang Hill - the highest is Maxwell Hill at . Eruptions Prior to 1992, no eruptions had taken place at the McDonald Islands volcano for 75,000 years. A series of eruptions started in 1992. =1992 eruption= The first recorded eruption from the McDonalds was from a submarine vent (a small VEI-0 eruption) in December 1992. The eruption was probably the cause of pumice that washed up on the shore of Heard Island. =1996‚Äì1997 eruption= Fresh eruptions were reported in December 1996 when a vapour plume was noticed by an aeroplane pilot. The plume was thought to have originated from Heard Island's Big Ben cone. However, on 18 March 1997 the crew of a passing ship heading for Heard Island reported that steam rose vigorously from a fissure on McDonald Island's steep north face; steam also vented from the island's north summit. Steam vented from a rubble-covered slope, indicating that a lava flow or pyroclastic flow had occurred. On 2 April 1997, the crew of another ship noted that steam continued to vent from the fissure, rising from the summit and flanks of the island. That crew also observed lava flows travelling down gullies; the lava flows covered a significant area of the north part of the island. Sulphur deposits were also discovered and fresh pumice washed up on Heard Island. The eruption is estimated to have ended sometime in January‚ÄìMarch 1997\\\\. =2001 eruption= Another eruption started at McDonald Island in 2001. The eruption was first sighted from a ship passing by the islands. Material was being ejected from the flanks of the island and also in the north and northwest of the island, and steam was issuing from near the summit crater. Work suggested that prior to the ship's visit, the volcano had been erupting, covering the island in dark, smooth material. Many features had been filled in, such as Williams Bay. The eruptions had also joined Flat Island to McDonald Island as of land had been added to windward point. A new volcanic cone had also been created. An observation made in November 2002 noted two new lava domes had been formed; their date of formation is unknown. =2005 eruption= Analysis of satellite imagery noted that an eruption took place on 12 July 2005 on the northwest shore of the island. The eruption may have added a small portion to the area of the island.

Difficulties in model specification  Like other forms of statistical analysis, badly specified econometric models may show a spurious correlation where two variables are correlated but causally unrelated. Economist Ronald Coase is widely reported to have said \\"if you torture the data long enough it will confess\\".Gordon Tullock, \\"A Comment on Daniel Klein's 'A Plea to Economists Who Favor Liberty'\\", Eastern Economic Journal, Spring 2001, note 2 (Text: \\"As Ronald Coase says, 'if you torture the data long enough it will confess'.\\" Note: \\"I have heard him say this several times. So far as I know he has never published it.\\") McCloskey argues that in published econometric work, economists tend to rely excessively on statistical techniques and often fail to use economic reasoning for including or excluding variables. Economic variables are not readily isolated for experimental testing, but Edward Leamer argues that there is no essential difference between econometric analysis and randomized trials or controlled trials provided judicious use of statistical techniques eliminates the effects of collinearity between the variables. Economists are often faced with a high number of often highly collinear potential explanatory variables, leaving researcher bias to play an important role in their selection. Leamer argues that economists can mitigate this by running statistical tests with different specified models and discarding any inferences which prove to be \\"fragile\\", concluding that \\"professionals ... properly withhold belief until an inference can be shown to be adequately insensitive to the choice of assumptions\\". However, as Sala-I-Martin showed, it is often the case that you can specify two models suggesting contrary relation between two variables. The phenomenon was labeled 'emerging recalcitrant result' phenomenon by Robert Goldfarb.  Lucas critique  Robert Lucas criticised the use of overly simplistic econometric models of the macroeconomy to predict the implications of economic policy, arguing that the structural relationships observed in historical models break down if decision makers adjust their preferences to reflect policy changes. Lucas argued that policy conclusions drawn from contemporary large-scale macroeconometric models were invalid as economic actors would change their expectations of the future and adjust their behaviour accordingly. Lucas argued a good macroeconometric model should incorporate microfoundations to model the effects of policy change, with equations representing economic representative agents responding to economic changes based on rational expectations of the future; implying their pattern of behaviour might be quite different if economic policy changed. Modern complex econometric models tend to be designed with the Lucas critique and rational expectations in mind, but Robert Solow argued that some of these modern dynamic stochastic general equilibrium models were no better as the assumptions they made about economic behaviour at the micro level were \\"generally phony\\".Solow, R. (2010) \\"Building a Science of Economics for the Real World\\" , Prepared Statement of Robert Solow, Professor Emeritus, MIT, to the House Committee on Science and Technology, Subcommittee on Investigations and Oversight: July 20, 2010  Other mainstream critiques  Looking primarily at macroeconomics, Lawrence Summers has criticized econometric formalism, arguing that \\"the empirical facts of which we are most confident and which provide the most secure basis for theory are those that require the least sophisticated statistical analysis to perceive.\\" He looks at two highly praised macroeconometric studies (Hansen & Singleton (1982, 1983), and Bernanke (1986)), and argues that while both make brilliant use of econometric methods, both papers do not really prove anything that future theory can build on. Noting that in the natural sciences, \\"investigators rush to check out the validity of claims made by rival laboratories and then build on them,\\" Summers points out that this rarely happen in economics, which to him is a result of the fact that \\"the results [of econometric studies] are rarely an important input to theory creation or the evolution of professional opinion more generally.\\" To Summers:  Austrian School critique  The current-day Austrian School of economics typically rejects econometrics, stating that historical mathematical data used to make econometric models represents past behaviour which may change in future and is ineffective at isolating causal relationships. In this they continue their belief that mathematics and statistical methods are mostly unsuited for the study of social sciences.Garrison, Roger - in The Meaning of Ludwig von Mises: Contributions is Economics, Sociology, Epistemology, and Political Philosophy, ed.

The technique consists in the destruction of the tissue by the insertion therein of optical fibers which convey the light energy, causing a complete and not reversible lesions necrosis. The therapeutic outcome is the reduction in volume of the nodule, and as a result of local symptoms, such as compression, and reduction or loss of visibility of nodular goiter. The goal of therapy is to destroy the lesion without removing the organ, thus preserving its normal anatomy. Once documented the benign nature of the nodule, the selection criteria for treatment with the laser concern injuries sufficiently massive to create cosmetic damages or local compressive symptoms and those patients who have contraindications at surgery or anesthesia or will not, for aesthetic reasons, to undergo surgery. Technique The laser ablation of thyroid nodules is performed in day hospital or day-surgery. The patient is placed under mild sedation (the same type of sedation used in an endoscopic examination). A local anesthetic is then applied, and one or two needles (depending on the size of the nodule) placed inside the nodule under ultrasound guidance. Through the lumen of the needles, extremely thin optical fibers are placed, which are connected to a laser light source. The total time of the procedure is about 30 minutes, with the laser energy applied for approximately 10‚Äì12 minutes. Advantages Compared to drug therapy laser ablation has the advantages of immediacy and efficacy in single nodules and especially when they have already reached a certain volume. In these cases, the percutaneous laser ablation not only prevents the growth of the nodules but it induces a reduction in short times and without having to perform a therapy protracted over many years. Compared to surgery laser ablation does not induce late hypothyroidism, does not involve the presence of scars or any other cosmetic damage, not painful, is a day hospital procedure, and does not require hospitalization, is a short-term treatment (about 30 minutes - including the patient preparation), takes place in a conscious sedation state of the patient, which avoids any risk related to general anesthesia, produces predictable and repeatable volumes of necrosis, and does not affect further therapeutic actions.

Both villages are today part of the municipality of Putbus. The monument near Neukamp was inaugurated on 15 October 1854 and the one near Gro√ü Stresow exactly one year later, on the 60th birthday of Frederick William IV. The drums and parts of the pedestal were carved from one of the largest glacial erratics in North Germany, the Great Rock near Nardevitz on R√ºgen's Jasmund peninsula. Most of the rock was destroyed as a result of being quarried for the columns. Nevertheless, it is still impressive today, and sticks 3 metres out of the ground. See also: Erratics on and around R√ºgen. The monuments were intended to commemorate the landings of the Brandenburg and later, Prussian troops on the island in the years 1678 and 1715 and to demonstrate Prussia's claim to power over the southern Baltic Sea region. The island of R√ºgen, which had belonged to Swedish Pomerania since the Treaty of Westphalia in 1648, was on each occasion briefly wrested from Swedish rule as a result of the invasions, but then returned to Sweden as a result of subsequent peace agreements.  Historic background  = Neukamp = Prussia Column near Gro√ü Stresow in July 1989 During the Swedish-Brandenburg War (1674‚Äì1679) Frederick William, the \\"Great Elector\\" of Brandenburg, allied with the Danish king, Christian V, conquered the island in September 1678 in the invasion of R√ºgen. The Danes landed under the command of Admiral Nils Juel on 13 September 1678 on the Wittow peninsula and, after driving off the weak Swedish garrison on Wittow to the Schaabe near present- day Juliusruh, erected earthworks that are still well preserved today (by the village sign and coming from the south). The Great Elector landed on the same day on the southeast shore of R√ºgen near Neukamp with the Brandenburg troops (7,000‚Äì8,000 men) under the command of General Field Marshal Derfflinger. He had approached from Greifswald through the Greifswalder Bodden with his fleet comprising 350 sailing ships and 150 rowing boats. The Swedes entrenched there were quickly forced back via Altef√§hr to Stralsund and Stralsund itself was also captured on 12 October 1678. The entrenchment near Neukamp is well preserved and is located just behind the monument. Following the Treaty of Saint-Germain on 29 June 1679 Brandenburg-Western Pomerania, including R√ºgen, was returned to Sweden. = Gro√ü Stresow = Pedestal of the Prussia Column of 1855 near Gro√ü Stresow - re-erected in October 2004 In the course of the Great Northern War (1700‚Äì1721), the Prussian king, Frederick William I, allied with the Danish king, Frederick IV, landed on 15 November 1715 with his forces (20,000‚Äì24,000 men) commanded by the Old Dessauer near Gro√ü Stresow. They drove the Swedes, led by their king, Charles XII, from the island of R√ºgen over the Strelasund to Stralsund, which had been besieged for a long time by the Danes and Prussians, but had hitherto received Swedish supplies through R√ºgen. After further siege operations the Swedes trapped in the town of Stralsund gave themselves up on 23 December 1715, Charles XII only escaping in a fishing boat across the Baltic Sea. Despite their victory, Prussia had to cede the island to Sweden as part of the peace treaty of 14 August 1719.  Erection of the monuments  The designs for the monuments ordained by Frederick William IV were produced by the architect, Friedrich August St√ºler. The sculptor, Wilhelm St√ºrmer, carved the statues on top of the columns. The statues are each about high and, like the capitals, are made of Saxon sandstone, standing atop the granite columns. The total cost was 6,815 Reichstalers.  Recent history to the present  Information board on the site of the original pieces of the Prussia Columns in Alleestra√üe in Putbus In 1985, i.e. 130 years after the erection of the monuments, experts from the Dresden Office for Monument Conservation (VEB Denkmalpflege Dresden) questioned the structural stability of the columns during an inspection. Five years later, following an emergency meeting on 11 September 1990 in Putbus, a Berlin master stonemason and restorer was contracted to remove both monuments. In late November 1991, the monuments were dismantled and their drums, capitals and statues transported to the master stonemason's workshop in Berlin-Pankow. Originally replicas of the drums, capitals and statues were to be made, because the advice had been not to repair them due to the severe damage to the original stone. The drums had once been joined together by means of iron pins. Serious corrosion of these jointing pins over many decades had caused the granite to split in places, which meant there had been a danger of the columns collapsing as result of the formation of cracks and fissures. The statues, too, were so badly eroded by weathering and lightning strikes, that their outline had been destroyed for ever. The material to be used for any replicas - i.e. Elbe Sandstone for the capitals and statues and Bornholm granite, of which the Nardevitz Erratic was also made, for the column drums weighing six and five tons respectively - would be readily obtainable. Further damage occurred during disassembly. The commissioned stonemason used percussion drills to get the iron pins out that held the pieces of the granite together. In doing so, large pieces at the respective ends of the drums were broken off. The drilling holes at each end of the drums show this clearly. The journey to Berlin was did not go smoothly either. The statue of Frederick William I from Great Stresow broke off at the legs. The head came off and was glued back by the master stonemason. Due to the continuing shortage of money in the district of R√ºgen, which was the owner of the monuments, little work was carried out in the following years, with the exception of the completion of a capital. One of the factors in this situation was, for example, the fact that in allocating funds, the making of replicas had a lower priority over the restoration of original monuments. Pieces of the pedestal near Neukamp in August 2006 A staged plan agreed in March 2003 by the Prussia Columns Working Group envisaged the following steps: First the pedestals of the two monuments should be returned to their rightful place, then the column drums and finally the statues by 2010. Because parts of the pedestals were and are still dotted randomly around the site of the monument in Neukamp (as at January 2007). The idea behind this phased plan was and is that a beginning must be made more visible to attract sponsors and increase donations. In seeking sponsors for this project, the President of the County Council even wrote, for example, to the royal houses of Denmark and Sweden. In April 2004 it was decided to return the original pieces of the first Prussia Column to the island by the time of the 150th anniversary of its inauguration, i.e. by 15 October 2004. Even this return journey failed thanks again to financial problems, because for the two monuments only a token amount of 500 euros was set aside in the county budget. Pedestal of the Prussia Column near Gro√ü Stresow In October 2004, the 3.30-metre-high pedestal of the Prussia Column at Gro√ü Stresow was restored. As was suspected from the results of earlier soil investigations, the stability of this monument had been reinforced by the use of stones laid to a depth of 5.80 metres and which had been taken from a megalithic tomb that had formerly lain on the site. This was re-confirmed during work on the foundation. The necessary ‚Ç¨20,000 were found from donations by the bank of Kreissparkasse R√ºgen and the German Foundation for Monument Conservation. Broken column drum on the storage site in Putbus in April 2006 On 2 September 2005, the original pieces were transported, unworked, from Berlin to Putbus and, since then have been displayed to the public in an open area on Alleestra√üe road, near the roundabout. Here, too, an accident happened for the master stonemason. The already broken statue of Frederick William I fell over in the workshop. The plaits, the nose, part of the brim of the hat and the arm broke off. After almost 15 years, all the pieces were now back at R√ºgen, in order to enable an independent assessment by experts. An information board here gives the story of the two monuments and appeals for donations for their reconstruction. On 28 April 2006, a symposium on the recovery and restoration of both monuments was held in Putbus. The organizer of the symposium was the Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania State Office for Culture and Heritage. They came up with the following option for rebuilding the monuments using the original parts: the original parts would first be pierced in the middle of their longitudinal axis. They would then be placed, piece by piece, on the column once the damage had been repaired, the loading on the individual sections being born by a solid stainless steel tube bored through them. Thuse, each part of the column would only be carrying its own weight, the internal, invisible stainless steel pipe, with a new foundation, would bear the overall load. Although this solution is controversial, it would cost (only) ‚Ç¨80,000 per column. But faced with a budget deficit of approximately ‚Ç¨9.5 million in the district of R√ºgen by the end of 2007, the money was still not available in 2008. In summer 2008, at least the pedestal in Neukamp was finally completed - without taking account of the solution proposed by the symposium.

It is implemented as a multi-threaded daemon, using a number of programming techniques and data structures to make the server very fastResponse rate benchmark of several OSS authoritative name servers, notably Read-copy-updateKnot DNS memory requirements or a special kind of a radix tree. Knot DNS uses a zone parser written in Ragel to achieve very fast loading of the zones at the startup. It is also able to add and remove zones on the fly by changing the configuration file and reloading the server using the 'knotc' utility. Since version 3.0.0, Knot DNS supports a high performance XDP mode in Linux, which can improve UDP response performance significantly.

In theoretical investigations, it is sometimes assumed that one of the two systems is the surroundings of the other. Then it is assumed that the work transferred is reversible within the surroundings, but in thermodynamics it is not assumed that the work transferred is reversible within the system. The assumption of reversibility in the surroundings has the consequence that the quantity of work transferred is well defined by macroscopic variables in the surroundings. Accordingly, the surroundings are sometimes said to have a reversible work reservoir. Along with the idea of an adiabatic wall is that of an adiabatic enclosure. It is easily possible that a system has some boundary walls that are adiabatic and others that are not. When some are not adiabatic, then the system is not adiabatically enclosed, though adiabatic transfer of energy as work can occur across the adiabatic walls. The adiabatic enclosure is important because, according to one widely cited author, Herbert Callen, \\"An essential prerequisite for the measurability of energy is the existence of walls that do not permit the transfer of energy in the form of heat.\\"Callen, H.B. (1960/1985), p. 16. In thermodynamics, it is customary to assume a priori the physical existence of adiabatic enclosures, though it is not customary to label this assumption separately as an axiom or numbered law. Construction of the concept of an adiabatic enclosure =Definitions of transfer of heat= In theoretical thermodynamics, respected authors vary in their approaches to the definition of quantity of heat transferred. There are two main streams of thinking. One is from a primarily empirical viewpoint (which will here be referred to as the thermodynamic stream), to define heat transfer as occurring only by specified macroscopic mechanisms; loosely speaking, this approach is historically older. The other (which will here be referred to as the mechanical stream) is from a primarily theoretical viewpoint, to define it as a residual quantity after transfers of energy as macroscopic work, between two bodies or closed systems, have been determined for a process, so as to conform with the principle of conservation of energy or the first law of thermodynamics for closed systems; this approach grew in the twentieth century, though was partly manifest in the nineteenth.Bailyn, M. (1994), p. 79. Thermodynamic stream of thinking In the thermodynamic stream of thinking, the specified mechanisms of heat transfer are conduction and radiation. These mechanisms presuppose recognition of temperature; empirical temperature is enough for this purpose, though absolute temperature can also serve. In this stream of thinking, quantity of heat is defined primarily through calorimetry.Maxwell, J.C. (1871), Chapter III.Planck, M. (1897/1903), p. 33.Kirkwood & Oppenheim (1961), p. 16.Beattie & Oppenheim (1979), Section 3.13. Though its definition of them differs from that of the mechanical stream of thinking, the empirical stream of thinking nevertheless presupposes the existence of adiabatic enclosures. It defines them through the concepts of heat and temperature. These two concepts are coordinately coherent in the sense that they arise jointly in the description of experiments of transfer of energy as heat. Mechanical stream of thinking In the mechanical stream of thinking about a process of transfer of energy between two bodies or closed systems, heat transferred is defined as a residual amount of energy transferred after the energy transferred as work has been determined, assuming for the calculation the law of conservation of energy, without reference to the concept of temperature.Bryan, G.H. (1907), p. 47.Carath√©odory, C. (1909).Born, M. (1921).Guggenheim, E.A. (1965), p. 10.Buchdahl, H.A. (1966), p. 43.Haase, R. (1971), p. 25. There are five main elements of the underlying theory. *The existence of states of thermodynamic equilibrium, determinable by precisely one (called the non-deformation variable) more variable of state than the number of independent work (deformation) variables. *That a state of internal thermodynamic equilibrium of a body have a well defined internal energy, that is postulated by the first law of thermodynamics. *The universality of the law of conservation of energy. *The recognition of work as a form of energy transfer. *The universal irreversibility of natural processes. *The existence of adiabatic enclosures. *The existence of walls permeable only to heat. Axiomatic presentations of this stream of thinking vary slightly, but they intend to avoid the notions of heat and of temperature in their axioms. It is essential to this stream of thinking that heat is not presupposed as being measurable by calorimetry. It is essential to this stream of thinking that, for the specification of the thermodynamic state of a body or closed system, in addition to the variables of state called deformation variables, there be precisely one extra real-number-valued variable of state, called the non-deformation variable, though it should not be axiomatically recognized as an empirical temperature, even though it satisfies the criteria for one. =Accounts of the adiabatic wall= The authors Buchdahl, Callen, and Haase make no mention of the passage of radiation, thermal or coherent, across their adiabatic walls. Carath√©odory explicitly discusses problems with respect to thermal radiation, which is incoherent, and he was probably unaware of the practical possibility of laser light, which is coherent. Carath√©odory in 1909 says that he leaves such questions unanswered. For the thermodynamic stream of thinking, the notion of empirical temperature is coordinately presupposed in the notion of heat transfer for the definition of an adiabatic wall.Planck. M. (1897/1903). For the mechanical stream of thinking, the exact way in which the adiabatic wall is defined is important. In the presentation of Carath√©odory, it is essential that the definition of the adiabatic wall should in no way depend upon the notions of heat or temperature. This is achieved by careful wording and reference to transfer of energy only as work. Buchdahl is careful in the same way. Nevertheless, Carath√©odory explicitly postulates the existence of walls that are permeable only to heat, that is to say impermeable to work and to matter, but still permeable to energy in some unspecified way. One might be forgiven for inferring from this that heat is energy in transfer across walls permeable only to heat, and that such exist as undefined postulated primitives. In the widely cited presentation of Callen, the notion of an adiabatic wall is introduced as a limit of a wall that is poorly conductive of heat. Although Callen does not here explicitly mention temperature, he considers the case of an experiment with melting ice, done on a summer's day, when, the reader may speculate, the temperature of the surrounds would be higher. Nevertheless, when it comes to a hard core definition, Callen does not use this introductory account. He eventually defines an adiabatic enclosure as does Carath√©odory, that it passes energy only as work, and does not pass matter. Accordingly, he defines heat, therefore, as energy that is transferred across the boundary of a closed system other than by work. As suggested for example by Carath√©odory and used for example by Callen, the favoured instance of an adiabatic wall is that of a Dewar flask. A Dewar flask has rigid walls. Nevertheless, Carath√©odory requires that his adiabatic walls shall be imagined to be flexible, and that the pressures on these flexible walls be adjusted and controlled externally so that the walls are not deformed, unless a process is undertaken in which work is transferred across the walls. The work considered by Carath√©odory is pressure-volume work. Another text considers asbestos and fiberglass as good examples of materials that constitute a practicable adiabatic wall.Reif, F. (1965), p. 68. The mechanical stream of thinking thus regards the adiabatic enclosure's property of not allowing the transfer of heat across itself as a deduction from the Carath√©odory axioms of thermodynamics.

It was the terminal station on the branch line of the Londonderry and Lough Swilly Railway Line that served the northern part of the Inishowen peninsula. This extension was known as the Buncrana to Carndonagh branch line, and measured 18.5 miles. The line was sometimes also known as the Carndonagh extension.  History  The first train arriving from Londonderry-July1, 1901 Construction of the extension line from Buncrana to Carndonagh started in May 1899. A ceremony marking the beginning of work was held in the Carndonagh on May 23, 1899. Lady Balfour, wife of the chief secretary of Ireland, \\"cut the first sod\\". Lord Balfour also attended the event, along with Mr Thomas Robertson, chairman of the Irish Board of Works. The previous night there was a torch light procession and bonfire celebration in the town. During the festivities, a tar barrel fell on two children, killing one and severely burning the other. In his opening remarks, Lord Balfour expressed his regret for the accident. The station opened on 1 July 1901. The Londonderry and Lough Swilly Railway provided passenger services and goods transportation from their Londonderry Graving Dock station to Buncrana and northwards to Clonmany, Ballyliffin and Carndonagh. During the Irish Civil War, the Free State Army used the Buncrana to Carndonagh extension to transport troops and gain control of the North Inishowen. Services to the station were temporarily suspended in early July 1922, but were eventually restored after Free State Forces gained control of Carndonagh. The Clonmany local councillor - John McCarron - was assaulted at the station. He was returning home from a District Board meeting held in Carndonagh on February 1, 1909. As he tried to enter a train carriage, McCarron was confronted by John Doherty (Roe) of Buncrana. Doherty wanted to prevent access to the carriage in order to play a card game with colleagues. Doherty hit McCarron in the face, causing McCarron's mouth to bleed and loosen a tooth. Doherty had previous convictions for drunkenness, using obscene language and obstruction. The local magistrate bound over Doherty to keep the peace. In April 1928, the midday Londonderry train collided with a horse and cart as it was traversing a level crossing about a mile from the railway station. The train destroyed the cart and severely mutilated the horse, which was subsequently put down. The rider, a boy called Neal Doherty, received minor injuries. In February 1933, a large barrel, containing 160 lbs of yeast was seized by the authorities at the station. The barrel was described in the manifest as \\"apples\\" while the delivery address was fictitious. The consignment was almost certainly destined to be used for the illicit production of Poit√≠n. At the time, ownership and use of yeast was highly regulated as part of the effort to clamp down on the illegal production of alcohol. The press described the seizure as the largest ever recorded in Inishowen. Throughout the 1930s, the station was used as a seed distribution point to local farmers by the Irish Free State Department of Agriculture. The station had a corn store to provide warehousing facilities for agricultural products. The building was demolished in 1935 to make way for an alcohol factory. As local road transportation improved, passengers and goods moved away from the railways and the line faced mounting financial pressures. The station was closed on 2 December 1935, along with all the other stations north of Buncrana. The rail tracks were torn up in February 1939.  Travel times and fares  When the line opened in 1901, the advertised fare from Londonderry to Carndonagh was four shillings, three shillings, and two shillings for first, second and third class respectively. The return fares from Buncrana to Carndonagh were three shillings, two shillings and three pence, and one shilling and sixpence for each of the three classes of travel. In 1930, the rail timetable indicated a travel time from Carndonagh to Buncrana of one hour and fifteen minutes. The journey from Carndonagh to Clonmany was scheduled to take 30 minutes. At that time, the day return 3rd class fare for that journey was advertised to be 2 shillings and sixpence.  Station buildings today  Former goods warehouse at Carndonagh station The railway station and station master's house are still largely intact and can be found in the Churchland Quarters district of the town. The station buildings were constructed in 1900-1. The main building comprises of a central three-bay two-storey block with attached four-bay single-storey block to east and single-bay single-storey block to west. When the line closed in 1935, the station master's house was converted into a residence. More recently, the main station building is used as commercial offices. The former railway goods sheds and former engine house to the north of site survive in relatively good condition, despite some alterations and modern additions. The buildings are listed in Ireland's National Inventory of Architectural Heritage on account of their social and historical importance.

They interact with the KASH domain proteins in the perinuclear (lumen) space between the two membranes. The KASH domain proteins cross the outer nuclear membrane and interact with actin filaments, microtubule filaments (through dynein and kinesin motors), intermediate filaments (through spectrin), centrosomes and cytoplasmic organelles. The number of SUN-domain and KASH-domain proteins increased in evolution.  Function  The function of the LINC complex appears to be in many cell activities. These include nuclear relocation/movement, moving meiotic chromosomes to find their homologues at leptotene/zygotene, attaching the centrosome to the outer nuclear membrane, formation of the nuclear pore complex, and responding to extracellular mechanical stimuli. LINC complex, by virtue of providing internal cell connectivity, is required for sensing of various mechanical stimuli including high frequency vibrations.

The station opened on 1 July 1901 on the Londonderry and Lough Swilly Railway line from Londonderry Graving Dock to Carndonagh. It closed for passengers on 2 December 1935. Routes  History  The station played an important role in transporting troops to several British Army bases that were situated in the vicinity of Clonmany. During the first world war, the Glenfield Training Camp was opened in Straid, just outside the village. Leenan and Dunree Forts were also nearby. During the War of Independence, in July 1921, railway workers refused to transport British Soldiers. The soldiers were removed from the train and sent back to Leenan fort. A man from Rooskey - Hugh O'Donnell - was convicted in January 1925 of stealing 9 stone of coal from the railway company. In his defence, O'Donnell said that he thought that the coal belonged to the British Military, who at the time, still occupied two forts nearby. O'Donnell was found guilty and sentenced to one month's hard labour. In January 1935, a man from the Isle of Doagh - William McLaughlin - was arrested at the railway station when he was found in possession of 3 1/2 pounds of yeast. At the time, illicit brewing of alcohol was a significant element of the local economy. In order to possess large quantities of yeast, one was required to have a permit. Otherwise, the presumption was that if an individual had a large amount of yeast then it was being used for the production of Poteen. McLaughlin was convicted and find ¬£20.  Accidents  On July 20th 1903, Michael Quigley - a porter at the Clonmany station broke his shin after his foot was caught between the platform and a train carriage footboard. Quigley sued the Londonderry and Lough Swilley Railway company for damages. In January 1904, he was awarded ¬£70 damages with costs by the Lifford Quarter Sessions. In August 1909, a carriage of train from Clonmany to Buncrana caught fire. The train was chartered for passengers returning from the Clonmany horse races. On arrival at Buncrana, passengers reported that the bottom of a carriage was burning freely. The train was quickly evacuated and moved to a siding and the fire was put out. In February 1928, a bull escaped after being loaded onto a wagon, where it was due to be transported from Clonmany to the Carndonagh fair. The animal ran along the platform, frightening passengers waiting to get on the train. It then ran along the railway track and escaped onto the main street running through the village, causing panic among school children. Despite efforts of the police and locals, the animal escaped deep into the countryside. On August 30, 1928 a train carriage jumped the rails, as it was being shunted through the station. The carriage was full of passengers who had just attended the Clonmany races. While no one was injured, the carriages were evacuated. In July 1933, a horse bolted as it was being used to load timber onto a railway carriage, causing planks to be scattered in all directions. The horse galloped into the village and was eventually caught by a local policeman.  Architecture  After the line was closed, the station building was converted into a house. In 2008, it was listed in the national inventory of architectural heritage. Remnants of the platform and the water tower are still visible.

Foundation The issue of political representation for workers had become increasingly important for the Trades Union Congress (TUC). At the 1885 congress, there was unanimous support for James Stafford Murchie's motion, introduced on behalf of the International Working Men's Association, that candidates who were members of trade unions should be welcomed, as should the establishment of Labour Associations in London and Birmingham, which aimed to support their election.G. D. H. Cole, British Working Class Politics, 1832‚Äì1914, pp.101‚Äì120 At the 1886 TUC congress, George Shipton called for the establishment of funds to support trade union candidates, and T. R. Threlfall, who had himself stood unsuccessfully for Parliament at that year's general election.W. W. Bean, The parliamentary representation of the six northern counties of England, p.1078 successfully proposed that a Labour Electoral Committee be established. The initial committee consisted of John Wilson (President), William Abraham and James M. Jack (Vice-Presidents), Stuart Uttley (Chairman), Edward Harford (Treasurer), and Threlfall (Secretary). Development The committee had some initial success, with \\"over a dozen\\" local associations established in its first year, these generally being linked to a trades council. However, it was hampered by a lack of any programme, disagreements over whether it should support candidates in local elections, and whether it could support Conservative Party or independent candidates, or only Liberal Party ones. Although this was not officially resolved, its local associations did start supporting local candidates. The committee frequently debated the merits of Liberal-Labour and independent labour candidacies; its position was generally to support only candidates who were thought to have widespread local backing, and never stand propaganda candidates in the hope of building support. Where trades councils had socialist majorities, independent candidates were sometimes given support, but elsewhere, only Liberals were endorsed. In 1887, the committee renamed itself as the \\"Labour Electoral Association\\" (LEA). It also described itself as \\"the centre of the National Labour Party\\", and its candidates sometimes described their affiliation as to the National Labour Party.Henry Pelling, The Origins of the Labour Party: 1880‚Äì1900, p.58 The TUC congress agreed to support the formation of further local associations, and (through an amendment of Robert Knight) to call for the payment of MPs. At the 1888 congress, Charles Fenwick, complained that the Association was working to discredit him and other existing Lib-Lab MPs, and an attempt by John Hodge to restrict its support to independent candidates failed. By 1889, Threlfall had moved from support for the independents to the Lib-Labs. The local associations had seen some success in local elections ‚Äì for example, four working men had been elected in Sheffield, while, by 1890, William Matkin claimed that more than seventy trade unionists had been elected at the local level. However, more trades councils were developing socialist majorities, and the local labour associations would then either leave the LEA, or split between supporters of the Lib-Lab movement and those who called for independent labour candidates. The LEA, therefore, became increasingly dominated by supporters of the Liberal Party. Decline In 1890, James MacDonald argued that the association should only support candidates who favoured nationalisation, but this policy was rejected by the TUC congress. However, the organisation's candidates were not particularly successful at the 1892 general election ‚Äì although eight of nine parliamentary seats were held, and Joseph Arch and Sam Woods gained seats, the majority were not elected. By 1893, the socialists who favoured independent candidatures had gained strength, and Ben Tillett and John Hodge successfully proposed that the TUC would set up a new fund to support independent labour candidates. Although they claimed that this would complement the LEA, it was generally seen as being an attempt to undermine its continued support for Lib-Lab candidates. The LEA declined rapidly in importance, held its final congress in 1895, and dissolved the following year.S. Maccoby, English Radicalism: 1886‚Äì1914, Volumes 5-1914, p.201 However, some of its former local associations remained in existence; for example, the Dublin Labour Electoral Association finally achieved some local electoral success in 1898.P√°draig Yeates, Lockout: Dublin 1913, p.86 See also *Labour Representation Committee (formed in 1900) *Labour Representation League (formed in 1869) References Category:Political parties established in 1886 Category:Political parties disestablished in 1896 Category:Liberal Party (UK) Category:Trades Union Congress Category:1886 establishments in the United Kingdom Category:1896 disestablishments in the United Kingdom ","title":"Labour Electoral Association"},{"id":"35470854","title":"Garden (Totally Enormous Extinct Dinosaurs song)"},{"id":"35470856","text":"Meendoran railway station served Meendoran in County Donegal, Ireland.

The shrine, which is considered to be important to the Buddhists in Sri Lanka, houses the relic of the tooth of the Buddha, and is a UNESCO designated World Heritage Site. It was attacked on 8 February 1989, allegedly by the armed cadres affiliated to Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP), a Marxist-Leninist Communist political party in Sri Lanka. Background In the late 1980s, the country was under a tense situation with two insurgencies ravaging Northern and Southern parts of Sri Lanka. First insurgency was initiated by Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) and several Tamil militant groups in 1983, seeking to create an independent Tamil state in Northern and Eastern parts of the country. In 1987, neighboring India intervened in the conflict to bring an end to the fighting between the insurgents and the Sri Lankan armed forces. That year, the Indo-Sri Lanka Accord was signed between the two countries and Indian Peace Keeping Force was deployed in Northern Sri Lanka to enforce disarmament of militant organizations and to watch over the regional council. JVP and other nationalist groups viewed this as a proliferation of Indian imperialism. This suspicion was fuelled by the perceived threat of North-Eastern autonomy, due to the presence of Indian Army in Sri Lankan soil. By this time, JVP was equipped with experiences of a failed insurrection in 1971, against the government of Sirimavo Bandaranaike. Under these circumstances, the party launched a second insurrection in 1987, seeking to overthrow the then United National Party government. Incident As the tension grew, JVP and its military wing, Patriotic People's Movement (Deshapremi Janatha Viyaparaya) launched attacks on various government and civilian targets. Many public places were vandalised, and people presumed to be supportive of the government were attacked. Temple of the Tooth, located in the heart of the Kandy city too came under attack on 8 February 1989. Eyewitness accounts, including a former JVP member who took part in the attack, describe the incident in detail. =Account of Adhikari= In 2001, The Sunday Leader, a Sri Lankan English- language weekly, interviewed a former JVP member, Adhikari alias Kosala, who participated in the attack. A fully-fledged member, Adhikari had received arms training, and participated in several operations on behalf of the party, including the Pallekele Army Camp attack, 1987 Bogambara prison attack and Digana bank heist. According to Adhikari, the first meeting to plan the attack was held at the house of a JVP co-ordinator named Sunanda, in Kandy. In that meeting, Sunanda explained the motivation behind the attack. He believed that taking away the relic of the tooth of the Buddha, which had been residing in the country for at least 1,700 years, would have made the people to rise up against the government which couldn't even protect the sacred property. This relic is traditionally considered as the symbol of the leadership and royalty in Sri Lanka. Next week, another meeting was held at the same place, with the presence of D.M. Ananda alias Kalu Ajith, the JVP leader of Western and Sabaragamuwa provinces, and Somawansa Amarasinghe alias Sanath, who became the leader of the JVP later and the last surviving politburo member of the party after the rebellion. In that meeting, Adhikari proposed a place in Medamahanuwara, to hide the relic after getting hold of it. On the next day, the 8 February, he was asked to be present near the Queen's Hotel, Kandy around 2.00 ‚Äì 2.30 pm. There he met Sarath, one of his colleagues in Digana bank heist, who introduced him to 4 boys and 2 girls. The girls, dressed in white lama saris were carrying two trays filled with flowers. Adhikari's task was to bring the group to the Makara Thorana (the entrance to the Temple), where he would meet two gentlemen, who carried pens attached to their pockets, as an aid to recognition. As instructed, after completing his job, he proceeded to the Kundasale town, about 5 km from Kandy. There he was waiting to receive the casket which contained the tooth relic. But the plan did not succeed. From what he learnt, two girls had gone past the checkpoint near the entrance, without being properly searched, and waited for the others to follow. This has aroused the suspicion of a guard, and he had come towards the girls. By this time, members of the group had arrived in the scene; snatched the guns hidden inside the flowers on the tray; and shot at the guards. Guards had returned fire. The following firefight left at least two attackers dead. =Account of K.G. Sisira= Sisira was employed as a labourer of the Kandy Municipal Council at the time the incident has happened. At that moment, he was travelling on a bus, near the temple. The driver stopped the bus amid the confusion, in front of the shrine. Then Sisira he saw a person wearing a blue T-shirt, chasing a guard, who came running into the bus and boarded. Then the pursuer, who was carrying a gun, shot randomly and hit Sisira in his right leg. In the subsequent shooting spree, the pursuer had died. Sisira was taken to a hospital, where 4 bullets were removed from his leg. His was hospitalised for 8 months and had his leg amputated. 2001 controversy In the run-up to the 2001 Sri Lankan parliamentary election, the issue of the responsibility of this attack surfaced again. The party leader Somawansa Amarasinghe and then JVP propaganda secretary Wimal Weerawansa, denied the involvement of JVP in the incident. The politburo of the party issued a statement denying that the attack ever took place. These statements were rejected by the then Diyawadana Nilame (the chief lay custodian of Temple of the Tooth), Neranjan Wijeyeratne, and Mahanayaka theros of Malwatte and Asgiriya chapters (chief Buddhist prelates of the country). Wijeyeratne said \\"There was blood-letting at the Sri Dalada Maligawa [Temple of the Tooth] as five persons were killed in the JVP attack\\". The controversy turned into a major political issue during the campaign.

The shrine, which is considered to be important to the Buddhists in Sri Lanka, houses the relic of the tooth of the Buddha, and is also a UNESCO designated World Heritage Site. In 1998, it was attacked by Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), a separatist militant organization which fought to create an independent Tamil state in Northern and Eastern parts of the country, from 1983 to 2009. Background During the latter part of the 1990s, Sri Lanka was at the height of a civil war. In 1995, Sri Lankan armed forces captured the Jaffna Peninsula at the country's Northern periphery, which was occupied by the LTTE for years. In 1996, the LTTE retaliated by taking the town of Mullaitivu, and inflicting heavy casualties to the government forces. The government launched the Operation Jayasikurui, and captured several LTTE held areas in 1997. Amid fighting, the LTTE carried out a number of suicide attacks on military, economic and civilian targets within the government held areas. In early 1998, Sri Lanka was ready to celebrate its 50th independence anniversary from Great Britain. Charles, Prince of Wales and a number of foreign dignitaries were scheduled to arrive in the following days. Kandy city, in the central highlands of Sri Lanka, was selected as the host for independence day activity on 4 February. Meanwhile, on 28 January, Jaffna city was going to hold its local government election, after a break of 16 years due to the conflict. Despite heavy clashes in Kilinochchi and surrounding areas, Sri Lankan government was eager to demonstrate that a normal life has returned to its people. Incident On 25 January 1998, the LTTE exploded a massive truck bomb inside the Temple of the Tooth premises, which was to be the centre the independence day celebrations. Three suicide LTTE Black Tigers drove an explosive laden truck along the King's street (Raja Veediya), firing at soldiers manning road blocks around the place, crashed through the entrance and detonated the bomb around 6:10 am, local time. Two explosions were heard. The truck contained of high explosives. 16 people, including the 3 attackers and a 2-year old infant were killed in the incident. Over 25 people, including 4 women, a monk and a police officer were injured. P. W. Withanage, a professor of geology also died due to shock after hearing the incident. The powerful attack left most of the buildings within a radius of damaged, and glass panes broken. Aftermath The bombing sparked a backlash among the public. Crowds gathered around the temple, and set fire to 3 vehicles and burned down a Hindu cultural center in Kandy. Police fired tear gas to disperse the crowd. In the end, no one was harmed and the violence did not spread. Community leaders, including the then Sri Lankan president Chandrika Kumaratunga urged the Sinhalese community not to retaliate against the Tamil community, which the LTTE claimed to represent. Next day, the Sri Lankan government officially banned LTTE for the first time, as a direct result of this attack. It had not been banned previously as the government claimed that it wanted to bring the LTTE to the democratic path. This ban formally ended public advocacy for negotiations by the Kumaratunga government. The then Sri Lanka's minister of defence Anuruddha Ratwatte handed over his resignation, taking responsibility for the security lapse which led to the bomb blast. Despite the violence, local government elections were held in Jaffna, and a high voter turnout was observed. Independence day celebrations were shifted to Colombo; but the foreign dignitaries including Prince Charles arrived in the capital. Coincidentally, Madras High Court issued execution warrants to the LTTE leader Velupillai Prabhakaran and 25 others on 28 January, in connection to the assassination of Rajiv Gandhi. moonstone (right). The attack left the original moonstone shattered into 43 pieces. But remains of the original carvings are reconstructed in a museum inside the temple. In October 2003, three LTTE cadres involved in the attack were convicted by the Kandy high court and sentenced to death. Two others were sentenced to 680 years of rigorous imprisonment and third to 490 years. According to the Mackenzie Institute, part of the LTTE's incentive for the attack was to spark widespread mob violence against the country's Tamil minority, by the Sinhalese majority, as it was in 1983. But it did not happen after this incident. Reaction The attack was condemned by various local and international organizations and individuals. =Local= Ven. Rambukwelle Sri Vipassi, the then mahanayake thero of the Malwatte chapter and Ven. Palipane Sri Chandananda, the then mahanayake thero of the Asgiriya chapter, the chief custodians of the relic of the tooth of the Buddha expressed their deep shock of the attack. Vipassi thero stated, \\"It is with immense pain of mind that I express my shock and profound sorrow on the extensive damage caused by terrorists to the sacred Sri Dalada Maligawa [Temple of the Tooth], which is held in deep veneration by the entirely of the Buddhist world.\\" President of the Hindu Council of Sri Lanka, Yogendra Duraiswamy stated that the Hindu Council is \\"deeply concerned at the cowardly attack perpetrated on the Dalada Maligawa, the holiest temple of the Buddhists in Sri Lanka.\\" The then Archbishop of Colombo, Nicholas Marcus Fernando stated that no one in their normal senses would have thought of perpetrating such a crime which is not only against the Buddhists but against every citizen of the country. The Sri Lanka Islamic Centre (SLIC) and the International Buddhist Foundation also condemned the attack. Leader of the opposition in Sri Lanka parliament Ranil Wickremasinghe said, \\"Not even in the darkest moments of Sri Lanka's 2,000-year history has such an act of destruction been perpetrated against the very symbol of our civilisation and history.\\" =International= Amnesty International ‚Äì Amnesty International issued a statement condemning the killing of civilians at the Temple of the Tooth bombing. It called on the LTTE to abide by basic principles of international humanitarian law, especially the common article 3 of the Geneva Conventions and the Protocol II. ‚Äì HRH Prince Charles, the Prince of Wales, addressing the 50th independence anniversary celebrations in Colombo on 4 February stated, \\"A proud consciousness of this richness of heritage must have made your pain all the more acute when a bomb was exploded at the Temple of the Tooth last month. It was a brutal and malign act, and one which we all join in condemning. The Temple of the Tooth is a part of the world's heritage; it is not just Sri Lankan nor just Buddhist. So all your foreign guests wish you well in the long and painstaking task of restoring the Temple to its original splendour.\\" UNESCO ‚Äì The then UNESCO Director General Federico Mayor Zaragoza, on 27 January stated, \\"I am deeply shocked by this act of blind violence perpetrated against a place of meditation, joy and peace. All religions are based on love and respect for life. Attacking a holy place means striking the very best in humanity, undermining its innocence and purity. Those who attack people through their faith can only be condemned. Religious differences can absolutely not be justification for conflict, and places of worship should in no case be used as targets.\\" ‚Äì The office of the then United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan stated \\"The Secretary General UN has learnt with outrage of the news of a bomb attack on a major Buddhist shrine in Kandy, Sri Lanka and the resulting loss of life and destruction. As he has done on many occasions, the Secretary General strongly condemns the use of terror tactics in all circumstances. He deplores attempts to divide human beings on religious and ethnic grounds.\\" ‚Äì The then United States ambassador to Sri Lanka, Shaun Donnelley condemned the attack saying that \\"the entire world leadership had condemned the bomb blast on the sacred place. We should condemn this type of destruction of ancient places of religious and archaeological value.\\" Damage and restoration Fully restored Temple of the Tooth in 2005. The attack caused severe damage to the temple; especially to its roof and the facade. But neither its inner chambers nor the tooth relic were harmed. Damaged parts of the temple include: Paththirippuwa (the octagon), Mahawahalkada (the grand entrance), the royal palace, sandakada pahana (the moonstone) at the entrance, the queen's bath, the library of the temple and some important sculptures in its exterior. Nearby Queen's Hotel, Natha devale and St. Paul's Church were also damaged. After clearing debris, the temple was opened for the public on 10 February. But complete restoration took more than one and a half years to complete. A presidential task force, headed by President Kumaratunga, and a Temple of the Tooth restoration committee, headed by the then Sri Lankan minister of cultural affairs Lakshman Jayakody, were formed to oversee the work. Department of Archaeology, Central Cultural Fund, State Engineering Corporation, Buildings Department, Sri Lanka Ports Authority, Water and Drainage Board and Ceylon Electricity Board were involved in restoration and conservation efforts. The badly damaged roofs were redone within 2 to 4 months, as a priority concern. Government initially granted 2 million Sri Lankan rupees for the restoration, following the attack. Public donations to the cause exceeded 100 million rupees, which was three times higher than the estimated cost. A number of local craftsmen and stone carvers were employed. This helped revival of the near-extinct profession of stone carving in Sri Lanka, which was confined to a few rural families at that time. In the end, all damaged sculptures were made new, and damaged paintings on lime plaster were reassembled and reintegrated with the existing pieces. The damage to the inner chambers revealed previously unknown paintings belonging to the Kirti Sri Rajasinha era. The restoration process was completed by August 1999.

Biography His parents were poor, and when a boy he worked in factories in the different villages to which they moved. He learned the machinist's trade, but early manifested a taste for mathematics, and entered Harvard in 1816, from where he graduated 1820. He then opened a school in Boston. In April 1823 he became superintendent of the Boston Manufacturing Company at Waltham, Massachusetts, and in August 1824 of the Merrimack Manufacturing Company at Lowell. In these capacities, he invented important improvements in machinery. In the Fall of 1825, he delivered a course of lectures on the natural history of animals, illustrated with the magic lantern. This he followed in later years with further popular lectures on light, the eye, the seasons, electricity, hydraulics, astronomy, commerce, etc. These lectures continued through many years. He was also superintendent of schools at Lowell, was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1827, and was for several years an examiner in mathematics at Harvard. Arithmetic book His reputation rests largely on his First Lessons in Intellectual Arithmetic (Boston, 1821), the plan of which he had carefully completed while yet an undergraduate at Harvard, where he was impressed by the necessity of such a work. He was accustomed to say that ‚Äúthe pupils who were under his tuition made his arithmetic for him,‚Äù that the questions they asked, and the necessary answers and explanations which he gave in reply, were embodied in the book. No other elementary work on arithmetic ever had such a sale. It had a large world-wide circulation, and was translated, not only into most of the languages of Europe, but also into several of the eastern tongues. He also published a ‚ÄúSequel‚Äù to his arithmetic (1824; revised ed., 1833), and an ‚ÄúAlgebra‚Äù (1827). Legacy The Colburn School in Lowell is named after him.

It was designed by the Derry architect Fitzgibbon Louch.The Buildings of Ireland, North West Ulster: The Counties of Londonderry, Donegal, Fermanagh And Tyrone. Alistar Rowan. Yale University Press The main station building was burned down in August 1903. A servant girl living the station accidentally upset oil lamp over the refreshment rooms, and in a few minutes the whole building was ablaze. The station master rescued his wife and family, and also got out some the railway papers. The damage to the station was estimated to be ¬£5,000 in 1903 prices. On September 4, 1905, the front axle of a train approaching the station suddenly broke. The train overran the station and the points were torn up for considerable distance. Although no one was injured in the accident, the station was forced to close until repairs were made. An 18 year old engine cleaner - Hugh McLaughlin from Londonderry - was found dead in the station pump room on December 9, 1909. He lit a fire in the room for warmth and then went to sleep. However there was no outlet for the smoke and McLaughlin died of smoke inhalation. On 30 July 1922, during the Irish Civil War, Buncrana was captured by the Free State forces from Anti-treaty forces. The Free State forces held the railway station and all the roads entering the town. Later that day, 100 Free State troops commandeered a train at Buncrana station and proceeded to take Clonmany, Carndonagh and other locations on the peninsula. The station closed for passengers on 6 September 1948. In December 1952, the Irish minister of industry and commerce signed an order authorizing the closure of rail services to Buncrana. Freight services were finally terminated on 10 August 1953. Post railway use The station buildings still exist. They were purchased in 1952 by Dan and Molly Porter and have been converted to a public house ‚Äì The Drift Inn. It is recorded on the Record of Protected Structures in the National Inventory of Architectural Heritage of Ireland.

The runway was closed in 2005 with the retirement of the F-4F Phantom II aircraft. History In 1939 works to build an airfield for the Luftwaffe began. These works were completed in 1940. =World War II= Hopsten airfield played only a secondary role as an operational base for the Luftwaffe in the opening stages of World War II. In the years between 1939 and 1944, the airfield was used only for short periods by different day and night fighter units as well as various bomber wings. As part of the \\"Defense of the Reich Campaign\\" begun in 1944 as Allied air attacks became more intense against Germany, Hopsten airfield became a hub for a multitude of Luftwaffe activity. Daily operations were conducted with the Bf 109. Bf 110, Heinkel He 111, He 219 and Focke Wulf 190 aircraft. Starting in September 1944, the Me 262 equipped Kampfgeschwader 51 (KG 51) \\"Edelwei√ü\\" was stationed at Hopsten. Known Luftwaffe units assigned to the airfield were: * II./Jagdgeschwader 1 Oesau from Drope near Lingen. * III./Jagdgeschwader 1 from Rheine-Bentlage AB. * Stab and I./Jagdgeschwader 26 Schlageter from Drope and F√ºrstenau, * II./Jagdgeschwader 26 from Nordhorn, * III./Jagdgeschwader 26 from Plantl√ºnne, * Stab and l./Jagdgeschwader 27 Afrika from Rheine-Bentlage, * II./ Jagdgeschwader 27 based locally at Hopsten, * III./Jagdgeschwader 27 from Hesepe, * IV./ Jagdgeschwader 27 from Achmer and * III./Jagdgeschwader 54 Gr√ºnherz with its JG 190D-9 from Varrelbusch, V√∂rden and F√ºrstenau. Towards the end of the war, Hopsten Airfield was a frequent target for allied air raids. But due to the extremely heavy air defence - with up to 500 AAA guns based in the vicinity of the airfield- and the fast repairs done to the runways, it remained relatively intact. Good camouflage and widely dispersed aircraft parking kept the airfield operational until the occupation by British troops. During the last days of the war, German units destroyed the infrastructure and made the airfield useless. =RAF Advanced Landing Ground B-112= British forces moved through the area in early April 1945 after their crossing of the Rhine (Operation Varsity) at Wesel. The RAF (Royal Air Force) established a temporary presence at the airfield and it was designated as Advanced Landing Ground B-112 Hopsten on 6 April 1945. After the war ended in May, the British decided it was not worth the effort to rehabilitate the airfield and it was abandoned. =Return to German military control= In 1956, only a few months after the establishment of the Bundeswehr, the new German Air Force began to set up new units and therefore needed airfields. In 1959, three years later, the German Defence Ministry decided to use the area of the former Hopsten airfield to build a new airfield from the ruins of the former World War II airfield . Paid with NATO funds, specialized companies from the region were tasked to build a completely new airfield to modern NATO Standards, the north to south runway was 3,000 meters long and 30 meters wide, was constructed between the villages of Dreierwalde and Hopsten in the North and H√∂rstel in the South. Ramp space, airfield infrastructure and roads, as well as a housing and administration complex in the city of Rheine eight kilometers away, were completed to new NATO standards for Western Europe. The old name of Hopsten was kept. It was the first new German airfield built to NATO standards. In 1961 the new Jagdbombergeschwader 36 (JG 36) was equipped with United States Republic F-84F Thunderstreak jet fighter-bomber aircraft. The Wing held its first Open House on 16 June 1962. A crowd of 150,000 visitors attended from the M√ºnster region, acknowledging the achievements of the wing personnel during the build-up phase. In 1965 JG 36 received Lockheed F-104G Starfighters. On 4 February 1975, the Wing Commander Oberst Winfried Schwenke would bring the first assigned F-4F Phantom II with the serial 37+97 to Hopsten. As the F-4F Phantom II was a multirole aircraft, JG 36, would gain the secondary task of air defence.

The project was built in two stages due to a capital cost and excess land was combined to provide communal open space. Houses are sited to relate with each other, to optimize privacy, solar orientation, views and physical conditions. Winter Park compromises of four groups of five houses that are located around communal car and pedestrian access ways, and each dwelling has a private garden in addition to a large central communal recreation space. The central idea was the free sitting of houses, private garden and communal open space to achieve an integration of the built environment within the most efficient use of land. Ellis Stones was the landscape architect for Winter Park, making it his last major project. The original design was recreated by over-planting species that were not considered in Stone‚Äôs intent.http://www.onmydoorstep.com.au/heritage- listing/5076/winter-park-cluster-housing =Key influences= Half the site was retained as open space. The balance was oriented to parkland through loop roads with vacant blocks on the park side, so that the streetscape could flow without visual interruption into the park.
